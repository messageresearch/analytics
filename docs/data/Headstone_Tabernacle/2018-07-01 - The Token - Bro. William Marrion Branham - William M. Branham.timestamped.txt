[50:11] thing no more we have a sad news and we
[50:15] have a budget of the proquest past the
[50:18] prime apparently he got a vein boost on
[50:23] his head and he's half a person today I
[50:25] believe it was that was yesterday and he
[50:28] in hospital and more Topsy wondering
[50:29] melamine in prayer this is due to high
[50:32] blood pressure so we want a ball heads
[50:34] at this point in time and we want to
[50:37] pray for brother it's not easy being a
[50:40] minister or pasta it is a very stressful
[50:44] thing do a different types of people and
[50:48] not just people but spirits different
[50:51] challenges and so on and sometimes
[50:53] people are so clueless and so
[50:55] unconcerned and such like a burden and
[50:59] you know just take things so much for
[51:01] granted and you know only when something
[51:04] strike you recognize you know what
[51:06] that's my brother that's my sister and
[51:08] you you tend to put your yourself in
[51:11] that person's shoes and feel for them
[51:13] and this is the junction that we are
[51:15] right now we we talking about going over
[51:18] yonder we're talking about a place
[51:20] prepared we're talking about missing the
[51:23] Lord Jesus we talking about believe me
[51:24] Lord lead you to where we have a
[51:27] destination this world is not our home
[51:29] we just fast and true whether we like it
[51:31] or not whether we have car house
[51:33] whatever we come here for perfection we
[51:36] come here
[51:37] to be like Jesus we come here to be more
[51:39] like him to reflect him that's the
[51:41] objective of receiving this word enough
[51:43] for argument enough for the beat but to
[51:45] reflect Christ so this time this ball
[51:47] has gonna bring our brother before the
[51:49] Lord Heavenly Father I bring your son in
[51:51] seven but we in praying before your Lord
[51:54] and I feel for him Lord Jesus life I
[51:57] pray their God that your angel of God
[52:00] will pass by and and minister to him and
[52:04] because every need Lord you know his
[52:06] heart's desire your no way he's act
[52:08] I'm the church and his wife and family
[52:10] God may love and mercy just reach them
[52:13] to them and and picked them up Lord and
[52:15] many times that believers themselves
[52:17] don't even know what the pastor go
[52:18] through and Lord they have complains
[52:21] they come for counsel they come for
[52:22] guidance but who does the possible for
[52:24] guidance and complain and and and lays
[52:26] burden down as such a lot but Lord when
[52:29] he has so few and and Sylvia with his
[52:31] heart Lord no he's dependent upon you
[52:34] Father and we are depend upon you to
[52:36] reach out that hospital father garden
[52:38] and deliver your son Lord and heal a man
[52:41] raise him up the name of Jesus we ask it

[57:00] said if you are remembered and he had
[57:02] the gun he was gonna shoot the bull and
[57:05] then pay for the ball but he didn't have
[57:07] the gun God allow him to forget the gun
[57:09] and when he was confronted with the bull
[57:11] and a bull started his ball run
[57:13] something came over him that was the
[57:15] token that was the love that was the
[57:19] bull language the speakable language
[57:21] that they bull can understand or glory
[57:24] to God that that that love could speak
[57:26] to the bees it could speak to the bird

[57:31] the tumor it can speed to missing limbs
[57:33] it could speak to what is missing
[57:35] they can speak to whatever their
[57:37] condition is that's the power of love or
[57:40] glory to God don't don't it don't
[57:42] question it it's power that's what make
[57:44] Christ come in the air it was the power
[57:47] of love for God so loved the world gave
[57:50] His only begotten Son
[57:51] it was the power of love he cannot give
[57:54] up a new array but his love constraining
[57:57] the hunters and refrained us and to
[58:00] redeem us and to pull us out and to pull
[58:02] us out thus in his love is what did that
[58:05] and we have to express that same love
[58:07] what manner of love is this that we
[58:11] could be called the sons of God or you
[58:14] have a right to shop this morning just
[58:17] to be called the sons of God what a
[58:20] privilege what our honor is not a right
[58:24] it's a privilege it's an honor to be
[58:27] called the sons of God hallelujah glory
[58:36] to God as we said already when no one
[58:40] would walk toward a woman at a well
[58:41] Jesus had the finer because her name is
[58:44] on the book love had to Redeemer law
[58:47] couldn't do it beating her up couldn't
[58:50] do it was a nine person can do it but
[58:53] when love came walking love did it and
[58:56] that songwriter so inspired said love
[58:58] lifted me when nothing else could help
[59:01] love lifted me I was sinking deep in sin
[59:06] from the peaceful sure Oh glory to God
[59:11] hallelujah but love lifted me may the
[59:15] love of Gordon lift you up this morning

[59:31] prophecy that's thought to be fulfilled

[1:00:08] token from Bakersfield the 8th of
[1:00:10] February 1964 praise the Lord amen
[1:00:26] as we read tonight from the 12th day
[1:00:30] right
[1:00:31] feed the word remember tomorrow can you
[1:00:36] that right but you know where I means 50
[1:00:39] miles of the road and the book of Exodus
[1:00:43] we read tonight from the 12th chapter of
[1:00:47] Exodus and the 12th verse and the 13th
[1:00:50] verse
[1:00:51] I'll be to be nice if we stood while we
[1:00:54] read the word and respects to go Exodus
[1:01:02] 12 12 or I will pass through the land of
[1:01:06] Egypt this night and I will smite all
[1:01:08] the firstborn in the land of Egypt both
[1:01:12] man and beast against all the gods of
[1:01:15] Egypt I will execute judgment I am the
[1:01:19] Lord and the blood shall be unto you for
[1:01:22] a token upon the house where you are and
[1:01:26] when I see the Blood I will pass over
[1:01:28] you and the plague shall not be upon you
[1:01:31] to destroy you
[1:01:32] when I smite the land of Egypt as far
[1:01:36] our heads father God we pray tonight
[1:01:39] we'll examine our self and see if the
[1:01:43] blood is sufficiently an insight as we
[1:01:46] speak on my word may the Holy Spirit
[1:01:48] guidance in Jesus name
[1:01:50] he may be sealed
[1:01:54] [Music]
[1:01:56] our scripture reading tonight takes us
[1:01:59] back in Exodus Exodus is a outgoing
[1:02:02] Anglet this we are all to play with the
[1:02:05] time and for the context I'm going to
[1:02:10] take the subject of the token a token
[1:02:14] what is a token a token is a sign of
[1:02:19] that a price has been paid like a
[1:02:23] railroad company or a bus fare when they
[1:02:27] run a bus line you go in many of the
[1:02:29] cities still haven't you can our ticket
[1:02:32] is a token if you go to a railroad
[1:02:35] company an airplane company and buy a
[1:02:37] ticket it isn't the money that you can
[1:02:40] give in when you go
[1:02:41] it's the token your ticket are you a
[1:02:43] little token that you have shows that
[1:02:46] you have purchased a required price they
[1:02:51] require a certain price and this price
[1:02:54] has been paid in a subject we're sinking
[1:02:58] overnight God's requirement for Israel
[1:03:01] requirement of Jehovah was the blood of
[1:03:05] the land that was his requirement and it
[1:03:08] was to be for a token the token shows
[1:03:11] that the requirement had been met that
[1:03:16] what God had required had been met what
[1:03:19] the railroad requires the token shows
[1:03:21] has been met your fare is paid you're
[1:03:24] ready to get on the train plane bus
[1:03:26] whatever it is but you must have the
[1:03:28] token you can't go on without the token
[1:03:31] maybe the companies will not receive
[1:03:33] your cash when you go out the airplane
[1:03:35] walk out there I want pay my ticket you
[1:03:37] go get your ticket first you must have
[1:03:39] the ticket and just the token is what
[1:03:41] you must hold the money itself will not
[1:03:43] work you must have the token the life
[1:03:46] was gone out from the sacrifice and now
[1:03:49] the blood was a token his orders had
[1:03:53] been carried out that's what it wasn't
[1:03:56] Egypt that dreadful night just before
[1:03:58] death struck the last play God had
[1:04:01] showed his great signs and wonders in
[1:04:03] Egypt long-suffering the kindness the
[1:04:06] favor on all these
[1:04:07] it sent many great signs through the
[1:04:09] land instead of a prophet showing signs
[1:04:12] and wonders of pillow fire all of you
[1:04:14] did and yet all the he did yet they
[1:04:18] would not repent it would not come to
[1:04:20] God they ignored all of his signs they
[1:04:24] ignored his prophet they ignored the
[1:04:26] message they wanted their own way so God
[1:04:30] had been fed up with him so he said I'm
[1:04:32] going to make a separation now between
[1:04:34] those who do believe in those who do not
[1:04:36] believe I think we're living in that
[1:04:38] time now where God's making a choice man
[1:04:42] will believe our they won't believe and
[1:04:44] God required a token this token was an
[1:04:47] innocent lamb that he had substituted
[1:04:49] for death in the Garden of Eden and now
[1:04:52] when the lamb was killed the blood was
[1:04:54] to be placed upon the doorpost and all
[1:04:56] the little and it was a to show that the
[1:04:59] requirement had been carried out oh I
[1:05:04] think that's a great lesson for us as we
[1:05:05] look at it seated leading worship as he
[1:05:09] was identified by the token of the blood
[1:05:13] he had there the believer had to get the
[1:05:16] lamb slay the lamb a lamb for a house
[1:05:18] take the blood with wasup which is just
[1:05:20] a little brush it grows up there in the
[1:05:22] country and a common weeds we'd call it
[1:05:26] and had to apply the blood it shows by
[1:05:29] the applying of the blood with this
[1:05:30] possum possum represents faith many
[1:05:35] times people think they have to have
[1:05:37] some supernatural faith to be a believer
[1:05:40] it isn't the hustle speaks for that this
[1:05:43] common weeds that you could get it
[1:05:45] anywhere pick it up dip it in the blood
[1:05:48] and apply the blood the blood tonight is
[1:05:50] applied by simple faith just not nothing
[1:05:53] supernatural it's right around you
[1:05:55] everywhere just simply like a child
[1:05:58] reach out to get a hold of it and apply
[1:05:59] the blood the hustle is just a simple
[1:06:03] childlike faith for the believer it
[1:06:05] isn't something how do you reach you
[1:06:07] don't have to reach very far to get it
[1:06:08] this hosta that grows in that country it
[1:06:11] grows out of the crack to the walls a
[1:06:12] little kind of a diamond shaped leaf you
[1:06:15] can pick it up anywhere justice as grass
[1:06:17] or weeds would be and in the
[1:06:19] country here now just pick it up why put
[1:06:22] it on the door that's the way faith is
[1:06:24] to be applied take faith I rather and
[1:06:27] apply the blood of Jesus Christ by faith
[1:06:29] to the heart's door this was going to
[1:06:32] separate and make the difference between
[1:06:34] those who were going out of Egypt and
[1:06:36] those who were going to stay in Egypt
[1:06:38] and perish with Egypt it made the
[1:06:40] difference
[1:06:41] strange how God always works through
[1:06:44] signs signals tokens and so forth he
[1:06:48] always has done it that's his way of
[1:06:50] doing anything he never does it outside
[1:06:53] of it God never makes a move until he
[1:06:56] does it and that way the way God starts
[1:06:58] that's the way God finishes
[1:07:00] he's infinite omnipotent omnipresent
[1:07:02] omniscient
[1:07:03] he needs nobody's help he doesn't need
[1:07:06] our interpretation I was said last night
[1:07:08] he doesn't need us to interpret the word
[1:07:09] and say what it means
[1:07:10] he speaks what it says it'll do that's
[1:07:13] the interpretation
[1:07:14] nobody has to interpret it when God says
[1:07:16] let it be it is that's his
[1:07:18] interpretation of it we might say the
[1:07:20] days of miracles is past there is no
[1:07:22] such a thing is about just the Holy
[1:07:24] Spirit a man who believes it God speaks
[1:07:26] to you in and that's the interpretation
[1:07:27] it got it that's they know they had that
[1:07:31] because God gives his own interpretation
[1:07:33] to his word that's what he was requiring
[1:07:35] that night to separate the believers
[1:07:37] from the unbelievers the believer
[1:07:40] worshiper was identified with his
[1:07:42] sacrifice he must apply the blood
[1:07:45] it wasn't taking till the lamb set the
[1:07:47] blood out there somewhere keep it in a
[1:07:49] charger take it down to the neighbors he
[1:07:51] had to apply the blood that's way it is
[1:07:54] tonight we could come and sympathize
[1:07:56] with everything God does that is what he
[1:07:58] requires you've got to apply it's not
[1:08:01] sufficient until you apply the blood
[1:08:04] must be applied that shows that you are
[1:08:06] identified a worshipper ladies hand upon
[1:08:09] the lamb and then kill it identify
[1:08:11] himself in the sacrifice the same thing
[1:08:13] we do to nicely our hand upon our
[1:08:15] sacrifice and identify herself with him
[1:08:18] and he is the word we have to be
[1:08:20] identified only through Christ as when
[1:08:22] we were identified by the word because
[1:08:24] he is the word always has been in the
[1:08:28] beginning was the word
[1:08:29] a Word was with God and the Word was God
[1:08:32] and the word was made flesh and dwelt
[1:08:33] among us the same yesterday today and
[1:08:35] forever so much word is lauded each
[1:08:38] generation God sent someone in there and
[1:08:40] identifies that word by his
[1:08:42] interpretation of himself Creed's and
[1:08:45] things has always had the churches such
[1:08:46] a term off everybody said with this is
[1:08:48] oil and this is a way and this is what
[1:08:50] you must do
[1:08:51] but God comes in steps on the scene and
[1:08:53] makes what he said come to pass that's
[1:08:55] the interpretation needs nobody to tell
[1:08:57] not sinful man our organizations are any
[1:09:00] great big denomination or anything else
[1:09:03] to interpret the word Sun Bishop
[1:09:04] Archbishop Pope or something that isn't
[1:09:07] it God does his own interpreted when he
[1:09:09] promised that he does it I've said many
[1:09:11] times when he said let there be light
[1:09:12] and there was life that's the
[1:09:14] interpretation it doesn't need any more
[1:09:16] to anything else to try to interpret it
[1:09:18] God it drips itself this blood being
[1:09:20] applied and identified worshipper
[1:09:23] identified himself with the blood by
[1:09:25] applying it in his own house over the
[1:09:27] door where he could not go out or come
[1:09:29] in without being recognized by the blood
[1:09:32] very perfect type of the day of the
[1:09:35] blood of Jesus Christ then the blood was
[1:09:38] a token of identification Christ is a
[1:09:41] token of the identification of a
[1:09:43] believer today animal life lamb days the
[1:09:47] reason they had to apply the chemical
[1:09:49] blood take it up on pasta place it up on
[1:09:51] the doorpost in the rental is because
[1:09:54] that animal the worshipper that put his
[1:09:57] hands and identified himself with the
[1:09:58] animal the life that was in the animal
[1:10:01] could not return back of all the worship
[1:10:03] because the animal doesn't have a soul
[1:10:06] he doesn't better he self at all we find
[1:10:09] out today that we man
[1:10:11] although fallen this fallen state we
[1:10:13] build our houses better we've got build
[1:10:15] a better car we take what God has
[1:10:18] created pervert it and turn it into
[1:10:19] something to help herself it goes to
[1:10:21] show that we are sons of God in our
[1:10:24] fallenness state yet we have a soul we
[1:10:27] cannot create like God did but we can
[1:10:29] take what he created and make a similar
[1:10:31] creation out of what he's already
[1:10:32] created an animal doesn't do that the
[1:10:35] dog still lives the same way you live
[1:10:37] that bird still builds a nest and a fish
[1:10:39] has his spawning grounds there's no
[1:10:40] difference there because why they
[1:10:42] doesn't don't have a soul but
[1:10:44] that man is in the image of his creator
[1:10:47] therefore that when that animal died and
[1:10:50] the blood was broken the cell was broken
[1:10:52] the life is in the blood cell and when
[1:10:55] the blood cell was broken the blood
[1:10:56] broken up the worshiper had to take the
[1:10:59] chemistry of the blood and put it up on
[1:11:01] the door so it could be seen with the
[1:11:03] little eye because a life that was in
[1:11:06] the animal could not come back up on the
[1:11:08] man not having a soul therefore it
[1:11:11] wouldn't mix with the soul of a man an
[1:11:13] animal's life won't come back upon the
[1:11:15] human being now our sacrifice today not
[1:11:19] only an ordinary human being but it was
[1:11:21] God himself that was identified and
[1:11:23] quest you're up on the earth that blood
[1:11:25] cell was broke not only to the soul the
[1:11:28] man or a spirit of a man but God himself
[1:11:31] who was identified in that man returns
[1:11:34] back upon the believer in the baptism of
[1:11:36] the Holy Spirit that's the token that
[1:11:38] God requires today they're talking out
[1:11:41] today that we have to have must be the
[1:11:43] Holy Spirit that's God's required token
[1:11:46] we prove it to you by the scriptures
[1:11:47] without the Holy Spirit you do not
[1:11:49] display the token that's the token shows
[1:11:52] that that that you have identified
[1:11:54] yourself with the sacrifice and God has
[1:11:56] sent you back the token the show that
[1:11:58] you've been accepted no that's done no
[1:12:01] matter how good you are how much you
[1:12:02] know I'm a college professor good person
[1:12:05] preacher whatever it might be you are
[1:12:08] absolutely not recognized until you can
[1:12:10] show the token Israel and that Exodus is
[1:12:13] they come out that time they have to
[1:12:15] have that token to prove that they was
[1:12:18] identified with their sacrifice if the
[1:12:20] night God requires the baptism of the
[1:12:22] Holy Ghost part proof that we've been
[1:12:24] identified in the resurrection of Jesus
[1:12:26] Christ
[1:12:27] there's nothing short of it the Bible
[1:12:29] teaches it plain and we must believe it
[1:12:31] it's God's Word God's requiring it we're
[1:12:34] having an exodus again we all know then
[1:12:36] Israel is marching to the promised land
[1:12:39] so love a bride go to her home pretty
[1:12:40] soon now we find out the block was a
[1:12:43] token and I it was identified everyone
[1:12:46] was identified by the blood the Holy
[1:12:48] Ghost is our token today to identify us
[1:12:50] by with Jesus Christ in his resurrection
[1:12:54] the blood being applied by faith
[1:12:57] the chemistry the blood cannot sprinkle
[1:12:59] Everhart we know that because it was
[1:13:02] shed on Calvary it bathed the ground but
[1:13:05] out when that blood cell was broke it
[1:13:07] released God through the sanctifying
[1:13:11] power that the blood had to come back to
[1:13:14] believers God in the beginning was God
[1:13:16] the Father who lived above all just like
[1:13:19] the pillar of fire that led the children
[1:13:21] of Israel through the wilderness you
[1:13:23] come down upon the mountain if anybody
[1:13:24] touches the mountain because he must be
[1:13:27] killed God's holy and he cannot condone
[1:13:29] sin in no manner the man that touched
[1:13:32] that mountain died even a beast
[1:13:34] EDB thrust through when God came down he
[1:13:36] was holy and God poncing come down and
[1:13:39] was made in the form of a man that we
[1:13:41] could hanley touching the Bible says in
[1:13:43] that teeny little blood cell many Jews
[1:13:45] wants to say he was a Jew many of us
[1:13:47] want to say was that you he was neither
[1:13:48] Jew nor Gentile he was gone he was a
[1:13:51] creative being by the hand of Almighty
[1:13:53] God he created a tabernacle he lived in
[1:13:56] which we know as a son of God that's
[1:13:58] right the deity supreme deity of Jesus
[1:14:00] Christ cause God dwelt in him Peter said
[1:14:03] the amount of Israel Jesus of Nazareth a
[1:14:05] man made known by God with signs and
[1:14:08] wonders you took with wicked hands of
[1:14:09] crucified he we were witnesses of his
[1:14:11] resurrection when the Holy Ghost has
[1:14:13] been poured out upon man now we find out
[1:14:15] that in this great thing that is God was
[1:14:18] identifying himself with Israel back
[1:14:20] there and requiring that identification
[1:14:22] now we find out you're the Jews could
[1:14:25] say they might say well now wait just a
[1:14:27] minute I am I'm a Jew I'm in the
[1:14:31] Covenant of Abraham I'm circumcised the
[1:14:33] kulluk head was annulled
[1:14:36] if the token wasn't displayed think of
[1:14:39] that I'm talking of a token of this day
[1:14:43] if that blood wasn't displayed that
[1:14:46] token I don't care how much you can show
[1:14:48] you was a Jew how much you said you
[1:14:50] believe you might been rabbi priest or
[1:14:53] anything but that token had to be
[1:14:54] applied
[1:14:57] no Inns are out yes or no until he saw
[1:15:00] the blood he would pass over some
[1:15:03] fellows might say come aside here I can
[1:15:04] prove I was circumcised at eight days
[1:15:06] the priest has record of it my name's on
[1:15:08] the book up there that didn't have one
[1:15:10] thing to do with it Tolkien was a if the
[1:15:14] Tolkien was not applied that covenant
[1:15:16] wasn't all it was an on effect we must
[1:15:19] remember that what God says he never
[1:15:21] takes back but he adds to them of old
[1:15:23] time to her say thou shalt not commit
[1:15:25] adultery but I say unto you whosoever
[1:15:27] looketh up on a woman to lust after her
[1:15:29] hath committed it off with her already
[1:15:31] he never takes back he adds to he
[1:15:34] magnifies that's what he does all these
[1:15:37] works he continually magnifies them
[1:15:39] that's where we're walking from one
[1:15:40] church age from the Lutheran the Weston
[1:15:42] the Pentecost and on and on as we go as
[1:15:44] we move on up God continually magnifies
[1:15:46] the same word just keep it going like
[1:15:48] that until finally the church will come
[1:15:50] into the image of Jesus Christ which
[1:15:52] will be his bride that he will take home
[1:15:54] thing that we're looking for today sure
[1:15:57] we realize that the church will go
[1:15:58] through the tribulation but the bride
[1:15:59] won't should be taken out from the
[1:16:01] church just as Israel is taken out of
[1:16:04] Egypt we find out now that the Holy
[1:16:07] Spirit was the one now that identifies
[1:16:09] us with Jesus Christ the Jews might say
[1:16:12] yes we're coming to Jews but if they did
[1:16:15] not have the token the Covenant was of
[1:16:17] no effect same thing now no matter how
[1:16:20] good we are doe matter you might say mom
[1:16:22] I did this knob done all these things
[1:16:25] knob paid by times I belong to the
[1:16:27] church I do all this God requires the
[1:16:30] token show that you have been identified
[1:16:33] for your sacrifice the one that you
[1:16:36] claim the hand the one that you believe
[1:16:38] that you had Peter said repeated every
[1:16:41] one of you and be baptized in the name
[1:16:42] of Jesus Christ for the remission of
[1:16:44] sins and you shall receive the gift of
[1:16:46] the Holy Ghost but of the promises of
[1:16:48] the UWE to your children and to them as
[1:16:50] far off as even as many as the Lord our
[1:16:52] God shall call who is that simple man
[1:16:55] that will change that and say the days
[1:16:56] of miracles has passed who will do that
[1:16:58] it said that God's Word was wrong when
[1:17:00] he said whosoever calls upon them
[1:17:02] Partha promises into unity or children
[1:17:05] that it's part off even as many as the
[1:17:08] Lord our God shall call he'll stack the
[1:17:10] token upon them this makes the
[1:17:12] difference between the believer and a
[1:17:14] non-believer it was all sealed by the
[1:17:15] kingdom of God in those marked by the
[1:17:17] mark of the beast and the ones that was
[1:17:19] marked by the mark of the beast could
[1:17:20] not take the seal of God the same things
[1:17:22] coming in today and we sit back before
[1:17:24] our own eyes no matter how good you are
[1:17:27] how much you say you're a believer God
[1:17:29] required the talk and he recorded in
[1:17:31] Egypt he requires it tonight he requires
[1:17:34] it tonight
[1:17:35] still
[1:17:38] I don't care if here's a Bible student
[1:17:40] how well you can explain the scriptures
[1:17:41] Satan can do the same thing but remember
[1:17:44] that has nothing to do with it God
[1:17:45] requires one thing that's the token the
[1:17:48] token shows that you are identified with
[1:17:50] your sacrifice that you claim that you
[1:17:52] worship hey that's it von Haase see the
[1:17:56] blood or the token the blood shall be a
[1:17:58] token and I see the blood I'll pass over
[1:18:01] you
[1:18:02] death was ready to strike Egypt still
[1:18:05] they desire not to repent and not turn
[1:18:08] back they didn't want anything like that
[1:18:11] they didn't believe it they didn't
[1:18:12] believe the message that was going on
[1:18:14] God has sent him a message
[1:18:16] they didn't believe it they still want
[1:18:17] to go right on the way they're just a
[1:18:19] perfect type of today they need every
[1:18:22] spiritual happening and every spiritual
[1:18:24] sign is a warning from God that
[1:18:26] something speaks to take place if that
[1:18:28] sign comes from God if it's man-made
[1:18:31] there's nothing to it
[1:18:33] but if it's God sent anyone knows
[1:18:35] everyone knows that God sends a sign if
[1:18:38] it's a supernatural sign he sends a
[1:18:40] message with that side always does he
[1:18:44] never fails to do that you see things
[1:18:47] it's not signs of God well then it won't
[1:18:49] be nothing cause God isn't in it but
[1:18:51] when God's in it a message is going to
[1:18:53] follow that in that message must be from
[1:18:55] the scripture that must be a scriptural
[1:18:57] message it must come thus saith the Lord
[1:18:59] ever spiritual happening is a sign from
[1:19:02] God like the message and the signs of
[1:19:04] following in this day like it was in the
[1:19:06] days of other days if we pass you in the
[1:19:08] Bible time and all other time could this
[1:19:12] ever be till now no other time can this
[1:19:15] message ever come forth till now jesus
[1:19:18] said as it was in the days of Sodom so
[1:19:21] shall it be in the coming of the Son of
[1:19:22] man the message could not be - now the
[1:19:25] world wasn't the condition is until it's
[1:19:27] in now this is the hour that Jesus could
[1:19:30] appear at any time the sleeping virgin
[1:19:33] coming in trying to buy oral that's at
[1:19:35] that time when the bride went in and the
[1:19:37] rest of them was left here did you ever
[1:19:40] think what happened they went right
[1:19:41] ahead preaching and thinking they were
[1:19:43] getting soul saved everything and did
[1:19:45] not know it they do nothing about it the
[1:19:48] Church of war on thinking souls are
[1:19:49] being say
[1:19:50] to everything else and the church is
[1:19:52] already the bride sealed away don't know
[1:19:55] it it's early that's exactly what
[1:19:58] description Noah went to the ark God
[1:20:00] seal it out truly and the time will come
[1:20:03] when men and women will cry to God and
[1:20:06] even think that they've got something
[1:20:07] when they haven't it's exactly right the
[1:20:10] Scriptures speak said likewise we must
[1:20:13] remember that God is long-suffering not
[1:20:15] willing that any should perish he always
[1:20:17] sends he signs his wonders and then when
[1:20:19] he gets ready to do anything he
[1:20:20] separates the believer from the
[1:20:22] unbeliever notice and how he provide for
[1:20:26] his promised land people look what he
[1:20:29] did for his promised land people there
[1:20:31] to be sure that they would not be mixed
[1:20:34] up in some kind of an ism what did he do
[1:20:37] he sent a prophet to them Moses with a
[1:20:40] message identify God's Word
[1:20:44] and to identify Moses he sent a pillar
[1:20:47] far that hung over a man then to give
[1:20:51] him the perfect assurance he required a
[1:20:54] token payment there's a messenger the
[1:20:58] message and the vindication and the
[1:21:01] token the perfect assurance that they
[1:21:04] have nothing to worry about matter of
[1:21:07] harmony plague strike what everybody
[1:21:09] else says they are sealed away Israel
[1:21:11] coming out of Egypt as I said a few
[1:21:13] minutes ago is a type of the bride
[1:21:15] coming out of the church when Moses
[1:21:18] begin his ministry Israel gathered
[1:21:20] together in one place in Goshen begin to
[1:21:23] pray because they know that the hour was
[1:21:25] at hand because they knew something was
[1:21:28] there the deliverer had already come God
[1:21:31] was working doing thing he's showing
[1:21:33] what he was going to do they come from
[1:21:35] all parts of Egypt
[1:21:36] just like they will at the day of his
[1:21:39] coming
[1:21:40] they'll take people out of the Methodist
[1:21:41] Baptist Luther all those who are
[1:21:43] identified in Christ by the token God
[1:21:46] will take them with him when he comes we
[1:21:49] read over here in Hebrews at in chapter
[1:21:50] 26 verse if we sin willfully after we
[1:21:54] have received the knowledge of the truth
[1:21:55] there remaineth no more sacrifice for
[1:21:57] sins but a fearful dreadful-looking for
[1:22:00] the fiery judgment rule and part of the
[1:22:02] adversary
[1:22:02] that is if we disbelieve willfully after
[1:22:06] we have a knowledge of the truth there
[1:22:08] is no more sacrifice for sin think of it
[1:22:11] no matter what you're thinking in your
[1:22:13] heart the token can never be applied if
[1:22:15] you reject it the last time then it
[1:22:17] cannot be applied before he that sins
[1:22:20] are displeased willfully as we see the
[1:22:23] great in signs and times of coming as we
[1:22:25] are now with the promise of the word
[1:22:27] every word that's been promised to us
[1:22:29] before the end time we're laying right
[1:22:31] in it now even to the marking of the
[1:22:32] beast and the denomination's getting
[1:22:34] together and the papal rain coming in
[1:22:36] everything just exactly the way it is
[1:22:38] the world's hanging honor the atomic
[1:22:41] bombs is in the hangers and God's
[1:22:43] speaking to his servants into the
[1:22:45] churches and pulling him out enjoying
[1:22:48] the silence that he promised he would do
[1:22:49] just before he's coming we're at the
[1:22:52] impound the token is required yes sir
[1:22:55] how we know that those things are true
[1:22:58] as it was there were only a type of what
[1:23:00] we were going through now as we see
[1:23:02] these great science coming at the end
[1:23:03] time warning us the time is at hand
[1:23:05] don't sin willfully don't disbelieve
[1:23:08] will flee if there's something in you
[1:23:09] say well now I don't see where I need
[1:23:11] the Holy Ghost I might not need it I
[1:23:13] believe when I believed I got it Paul
[1:23:15] said to the people that asked that
[1:23:17] question he said have you received the
[1:23:19] Holy Ghost since you had believed the
[1:23:21] Holy Ghost is a token a man believes God
[1:23:24] that is true enough but the Holy Ghost
[1:23:26] is a gift of God it's something
[1:23:28] different in your faith your faith
[1:23:29] applies that that's exactly right but
[1:23:32] the Holy Ghost is the witness we'll see
[1:23:35] just in a few minutes how it works and
[1:23:37] what takes place where we can be sure
[1:23:38] where we know where we're right or not
[1:23:40] it warns us that the time is at hand we
[1:23:42] should love one another doing this time
[1:23:44] the church the believers should be
[1:23:46] unseparable believers believers should
[1:23:48] separate themselves from all the things
[1:23:50] of the world everything is ungodly the
[1:23:53] believers should separate himself from
[1:23:55] it notice they were not just to come
[1:23:58] together to talk about it and say we
[1:24:00] believe it they were come together to a
[1:24:02] pot of ugh that comes to oh sure I
[1:24:05] believe that walk alone they had to come
[1:24:08] in a pod
[1:24:09] Kludd that the token might be seen get
[1:24:12] beneath it that's today we sit here the
[1:24:15] message preached we read it out of the
[1:24:16] Bible we say oh yes I believe that that
[1:24:19] is what God required no matter how much
[1:24:21] you believe it you've got to have it
[1:24:23] church wake up America this is your life
[1:24:26] our judgment lays in the balance under
[1:24:30] for this nation if God would let this
[1:24:32] nation get by with what it's done now
[1:24:33] he'd be obligated to raise up sodom and
[1:24:35] gomorrah and apologize for burning them
[1:24:37] up right we are going to pay for our
[1:24:40] sins we're doing the same thing they did
[1:24:43] in Sodom and God has set down message
[1:24:45] just exactly the way he did inside just
[1:24:48] exactly sent one to the church out there
[1:24:51] and a lot group into Sodom and he sent
[1:24:53] to the elect and so forth and proved it
[1:24:56] that the churches setting exactly in the
[1:24:58] condition it was in the days of lot and
[1:25:00] Jesus said it would be again transits on
[1:25:03] our hands what are we going to do with
[1:25:05] it say blood on your hands yes what do
[1:25:07] you think Oswald thought when he was
[1:25:09] staying in that room the other day but
[1:25:10] taking the blood of his
[1:25:13] you will you be judged anger - I get
[1:25:18] sons and daughters of God not some old
[1:25:20] salt grandfather let his kids get by
[1:25:22] grandchildren get baths anything he's
[1:25:24] not a grandfather he's a father and sir
[1:25:26] every child must be born Davi he's a
[1:25:29] father of Correction we know that this
[1:25:31] hour sure judgements is at hand what are
[1:25:33] we going to do with it I'd hate to have
[1:25:35] his blood upon me there's only one way
[1:25:37] you could ever get it off idea you can't
[1:25:38] wash it off Pilate tried that he tried
[1:25:41] to pass the buck onto somebody else and
[1:25:43] said send him on over to a seizure or
[1:25:45] someone else like that
[1:25:46] and if see what he throws it back ba
[1:25:48] he'll write back in his lap again right
[1:25:51] and today we try to say I would have my
[1:25:54] husband and I would have my wife I would
[1:25:56] have my church back bars might pack
[1:25:59] honey again when you say well well I
[1:26:02] church resist but when Jesus Christ
[1:26:04] comes down in these meetings and
[1:26:06] identifies himself in the scripture that
[1:26:08] he's the same yesterday today forever I
[1:26:10] don't care what your interpretation is
[1:26:12] cars out in your laughing it's
[1:26:14] underneath
[1:26:15] paying brothers and sisters you can do
[1:26:17] friends remember the issue of California

[1:26:30] can get the blood of Jesus Christ off
[1:26:32] your head just put it in your heart only
[1:26:34] one way it'll never work no other way so
[1:26:37] when I see the blood when it's applied
[1:26:39] in the right place they say I believe
[1:26:41] the blood wanted thrown it out in the
[1:26:42] backyard was it put it on the chicken
[1:26:44] house

[1:27:09] what can we do with this Jesus is called
[1:27:12] Christ why don't we go to do with it
[1:27:14] only one thing is display his blood by
[1:27:16] letting it be on our heart by the Holy
[1:27:18] Ghost we are responsible
[1:27:22] any of us that's not beneath that blood
[1:27:25] God is not responsible for it not even
[1:27:27] one

[1:27:36] to do with you you're an individual I
[1:27:38] belong to the Holy Church that church
[1:27:40] that church has nothing to do with you
[1:27:42] there is no such a thing as a Holy
[1:27:43] Church there's no such a thing as a holy
[1:27:46] person there's a Holy Ghost with the
[1:27:49] people the Holy Ghost in the church no

[1:28:01] responsible to him not to the church
[1:28:02] we're responsible to God into his word
[1:28:05] and God is the word the Bible said he
[1:28:07] was responsible to that that's Jesus
[1:28:10] Christ
[1:28:10] notice what he did then we find out to
[1:28:12] the whole family only was safe when the
[1:28:15] token was displayed when the token was
[1:28:17] displayed they were safe look in second
[1:28:20] chapter Joshua find out here that are
[1:28:23] believing harlot by the name of Rahab a
[1:28:25] Gentile harlot over across the river

[1:29:21] word and this is it no another can take
[1:29:24] anything for him in notice Jericho had
[1:29:26] the heard what God was doing
[1:29:29] Jericho had heard the words remember
[1:29:30] what the harlots said we have heard how
[1:29:32] God did great things I fear will you
[1:29:35] just spare me if I show kindness to

[1:30:27] they believe they must have believed
[1:30:28] they were safe in that great wall where
[1:30:30] were where they were at their great big
[1:30:32] finally their great big place many
[1:30:35] people today I say this through rivers
[1:30:37] and respect many people they say I
[1:30:39] belong to the biggest Church here is the
[1:30:40] city my mother belongs to that church is
[1:30:42] one of the oldest churches that don't
[1:30:43] have one thing to do with it the the
[1:30:45] token has got to be a plan they might
[1:30:49] have thought that big thing they lived
[1:30:51] in that big system that was go to saving
[1:30:53] but we find out everything that didn't
[1:30:55] show that token perished soul it be at
[1:30:59] the coming of the Son of Man he's done
[1:31:00] said so there must have been some of
[1:31:02] them hate boys or somebody slipped into
[1:31:04] the place down there and played some
[1:31:06] tapes to him or something you haven't
[1:31:07] found the predestinated she's coke all
[1:31:10] over a house and used it for a church
[1:31:11] and received the messengers then when
[1:31:13] they got all in the city that would come
[1:31:15] under and believe the token when she got
[1:31:17] all of it in there and the destruction
[1:31:20] come when God's wrath destroyed that big
[1:31:24] system they had down there the token
[1:31:26] sign help her house the token sign not
[1:31:32] nothing else no matter how much
[1:31:34] societies
[1:31:35] how many good Red Cross things ahead
[1:31:37] which is all good how much of this and
[1:31:39] how many charity organizations
[1:31:41] everything parish that wasn't under that
[1:31:44] token
[1:31:45] now think of it everything perished I
[1:31:49] don't care how bigger Church the head
[1:31:51] how bigger denomination they belong to
[1:31:53] was the king's palace
[1:31:55] everything perished and so did
[1:31:57] everything perish in Egypt it wasn't
[1:32:00] under that token that God doesn't change
[1:32:04] his ways he's got a token today my
[1:32:07] brother's sister you better receive it
[1:32:09] you better have it just remember it's a
[1:32:11] warning look the same life that the
[1:32:14] token did in his same thing that the
[1:32:17] token did in Egypt it spared everything
[1:32:20] was under everything without it perished
[1:32:22] Joshua is a type of Jesus which Joshua
[1:32:25] means Jehovah Savior
[1:32:26] so does Jesus means your holy Savior
[1:32:29] Joshua was true to the token sign that
[1:32:33] his messengers had preached so will
[1:32:35] Jesus be true to the token sign that his
[1:32:37] messengers preached when he comes all
[1:32:39] under it was saved in Egypt all under it
[1:32:42] was saved and Jericho what about today
[1:32:45] we find out the lambs blood was a type
[1:32:48] of Jesus Christ
[1:32:49] all right Hebrews 13 we find this it is
[1:32:52] Paul there the everlasting covenant God
[1:32:56] had a covenant with him but the blood
[1:32:58] now is an everlasting covenant the blood
[1:33:00] of Jesus Christ God's blood bound
[1:33:03] promises makes us free from sin and self
[1:33:06] makes us free from anything in the world
[1:33:08] no matter how much we try to fashion it
[1:33:11] the world it's all dead if we were in
[1:33:13] God's blood bound promises we see
[1:33:16] nothing but the blood how could they
[1:33:17] look out that door without seeing the
[1:33:19] blood how can you look out at anything
[1:33:21] without seeing first the blood of Jesus
[1:33:23] Cruz if you're in Christ you see that to
[1:33:27] worship a man to show forth his promises
[1:33:31] in power he promised these things to
[1:33:34] come his blood bound people are in him
[1:33:37] sealed in their by the Holy Spirit and
[1:33:39] are looking only at the blood and the
[1:33:42] promise they can't look at the world
[1:33:43] they're dead to the world the world's
[1:33:45] dead to them and to see Christians a day
[1:33:48] who can do anything at the rest the
[1:33:50] world does act like them swear like I'm
[1:33:53] drink like I'm smoke like them and rude
[1:33:55] pins of synod dance halls and things i
[1:33:58] can then still say they are christians
[1:34:02] you can't do that friend that's the
[1:34:04] reason people can't believe the power of
[1:34:06] god they can't believe the science
[1:34:07] mourners they done died to those things
[1:34:09] in a resurrected over here in the world
[1:34:12] but those who are dealt in or are raised
[1:34:14] in christ and are looking for his
[1:34:15] promise the new testament means new
[1:34:18] covenant the blood life the blood life
[1:34:21] itself is the token the life out of the
[1:34:24] blood is the token remember in the old
[1:34:27] testament the actual blood of the Lamb
[1:34:29] had to be applied here it's the token of
[1:34:33] the blood it is the life from the blood
[1:34:36] that's in the person for the token oh my
[1:34:40] the new token is the new light that
[1:34:42] comes through Jesus Christ when his
[1:34:44] blood was shed the sanctified Church and
[1:34:46] fill it with his presence that he might
[1:34:48] manifest his word and his promises to
[1:34:51] the people God in son John times and
[1:34:54] divers matters Hebrew ones said he spoke
[1:34:56] to the fathers to the prophets but in
[1:34:58] this last day through His Son Jesus
[1:34:59] Christ what is this on the word the Word
[1:35:03] was made flesh and dwelt among us and
[1:35:05] this is the revelation the completeness
[1:35:07] of Christ whoever will add one word
[1:35:09] tutor take one from it the same will be
[1:35:11] taking this part out of the book of life
[1:35:13] there is a revelation we only need the
[1:35:15] token with us to make that word live
[1:35:18] again that's what he sent the token part
[1:35:20] he'd give us the statement give us in
[1:35:22] that statement and we know it's the
[1:35:23] truth the new token shows Jesus has met
[1:35:26] every requirement for us and he's here
[1:35:29] the new token the token of the Holy
[1:35:32] Spirit shows that we know that Jesus
[1:35:36] died to free us from all the things of
[1:35:38] the world and the token that is up
[1:35:40] honest proves it by vindicating what he
[1:35:43] said now how can a man clean the whole
[1:35:47] that token in front of him and deny what
[1:35:50] this word says it isn't soul it can't be
[1:35:54] so God can't lie about his own word and
[1:35:56] because he is sure we have the other
[1:36:01] right to all that he purchased for us
[1:36:03] notice what was the token to do to
[1:36:06] purchase and surprises then pay
[1:36:09] when you had the token you have a right
[1:36:11] then to present that token to anything
[1:36:14] that he purchased for you and one can
[1:36:17] buy it without it it's only can be
[1:36:21] purchased by the token remember if you
[1:36:24] out here at the bus line stay here I'll
[1:36:26] tell you I got a I got a token it says
[1:36:28] another bus line that won't work I got a
[1:36:31] token it says it come from Maine from
[1:36:32] New Hampshire
[1:36:33] if won't work in California you've got
[1:36:35] the head of token of that bus line in
[1:36:39] order to purchase shows that you have
[1:36:41] purchased that bear on that bus and when
[1:36:46] we can display the token of the Holy
[1:36:48] Spirit shows that we have been accepted
[1:36:52] in Christ and that is our token that all
[1:36:55] that we have need of is already
[1:36:58] purchased I am we are identified with
[1:37:01] our token the token must be ready
[1:37:04] well covenant blood is not recognized
[1:37:07] without the token the word assures us of
[1:37:09] the promise that token is the sign the
[1:37:12] purchase has been made forests full
[1:37:15] obedience to the full word of God
[1:37:17] entitles us to the token no other way is
[1:37:22] there that you can ever be entitled to
[1:37:24] the token until you fully obey the word
[1:37:27] not what somebody's put into it and
[1:37:30] added to it but what God said about what
[1:37:34] he said you must be born again that
[1:37:35] don't mean jump up and down the altar
[1:37:37] that don't we walk back and shake hands
[1:37:39] for the pastor that don't mean all this
[1:37:40] foolishness that we've seen done it
[1:37:42] don't mean putting your name on a church
[1:37:44] book it means deaf to your first being
[1:37:47] and life to the second be it means that
[1:37:51] the blood has been a part and you're
[1:37:53] identified by the life of Jesus Christ
[1:37:55] and if he be the vine and we'd be the
[1:37:57] branches of life that's in the branch is
[1:38:00] in the also from the vine it'll bear the
[1:38:02] fruit if that first rains come forth
[1:38:05] that branch out of that vine the rule 2
[1:38:08] book of Acts behind it if that branch
[1:38:09] ever puts forth a vine puts forth
[1:38:11] another branch they'll write another
[1:38:13] book the ex behind it cause it's the
[1:38:14] same like if one of your grape vines I
[1:38:17] hear brings forth blue grace if it puts
[1:38:19] forth another branch they're running
[1:38:20] fourth blue grace
[1:38:21] I'll tell you today we got so many
[1:38:23] grafted behinds into it with
[1:38:25] denominations and crazy things and yet
[1:38:27] any citrus fruit grafted-in can male
[1:38:29] live in there fine but it's bearing the
[1:38:32] wrong proof what we needed a is an earth
[1:38:36] baptism of the Holy Spirit and have a
[1:38:39] real power of God that identifies the
[1:38:42] works of Jesus Christ promised for this
[1:38:44] thing not so much as that Dave this
[1:38:46] thing the promise that he made here that
[1:38:48] commissary pour out his spirit
[1:38:51] nice promise to get in the last days
[1:38:52] what do you do strange we can always
[1:38:55] look back but you never look ahead
[1:38:57] that's the way with man he's always
[1:38:59] saying glory find God for what he did do
[1:39:01] praise him for what he's going to do it
[1:39:03] and ignoring what he's doing that's
[1:39:05] always the way of man is still the same
[1:39:07] thing full obedience to the word brings
[1:39:10] God that word eternal in you and that is
[1:39:15] the token when the word is in you it's
[1:39:17] Christ in you now notice when then when
[1:39:23] we pray if we have the token and when we
[1:39:27] pray we had the token we our percent are
[1:39:31] talking with our prayer now if you're
[1:39:34] sick your sinner if your need when you
[1:39:38] have the token you have all right if I
[1:39:43] had the token to a bus line in my head
[1:39:45] they can't keep me off of that bus
[1:39:47] they've accepted my money I have the
[1:39:51] token in this case I could not pay my
[1:39:53] price you could not pay but he paid it
[1:39:55] for us and give us a token
[1:39:59] amen why to divine healing Jesus Christ
[1:40:03] I have a right to claim ever promise in
[1:40:07] that book when when you get it when you
[1:40:10] have the token and can rep present the
[1:40:13] token with your prayer if you haven't
[1:40:15] got it
[1:40:16] the sign of the fallopian severe is paid
[1:40:18] Paul tells us the blood speaks blood
[1:40:22] speaks did we say does the blood speak
[1:40:24] can it speak that token speak yes sir if
[1:40:27] we look in Genesis 14 the voice of the
[1:40:30] blood of Abel cried out against Cain we
[1:40:33] find out in Hebrews 12:22
[1:40:36] or that the blood of Jesus Christ speaks
[1:40:38] better things the blood speaks how can
[1:40:41] the chemistry speaks it's a life that's
[1:40:43] in the blood that does soul that was in
[1:40:46] cane that cried out before enabled it
[1:40:49] was the life it was in Christ that cries
[1:40:53] out there are things than anything it
[1:40:56] speaks that he speaks Thailand it's the
[1:40:58] Holy Spirit he speaks plane to tells us
[1:41:00] that the time is here when we see it
[1:41:02] where it said it would say it then we
[1:41:04] said come back and identify what it said
[1:41:06] it's there's nothing else that but to
[1:41:08] believe it that's trying to recede it
[1:41:10] leave herself and apply the token all it
[1:41:13] sold for the family like they did in
[1:41:14] Egypt and like they did at Jericho at
[1:41:16] 1631 we find out Paul told the the Roman
[1:41:19] to be baptized calling upon the name of
[1:41:21] the Lord
[1:41:22] him and his house could be saved by
[1:41:23] doing the same thing move out some
[1:41:26] people wants to apply the blood and stay

[1:43:45] clean out the cupboard clean out this
[1:43:48] house all we have a good old-fashioned
[1:43:50] housecleaning
[1:43:51] let the blood be applied and then the
[1:43:52] token will come in clean it out
[1:43:54] sanctified they had a pile of token and
[1:43:58] prayer with companies when you clean
[1:44:00] yourself up
[1:44:01] you've got away from the things of the
[1:44:02] world you dumped all the ugly but I
[1:44:04] don't care what the people says if the
[1:44:06] Word of God says it in promise it I
[1:44:08] believe it
[1:44:09] if the word says that that settles it
[1:44:12] now I don't care what anybody else says
[1:44:14] see and when you got all that done
[1:44:17] you've applied the blood and you believe
[1:44:19] every word
[1:44:20] then take your token in prayer be fully
[1:44:24] convinced we read in Ephesians
[1:44:27] 2nd chapter 12 first about what God said
[1:44:31] about when we applied this token notice
[1:44:33] serving the Living God with
[1:44:36] being works and with living signs with a
[1:44:39] living token not dead works in Carla not
[1:44:43] dead wears Hebrews 9:11 14 tells us
[1:44:45] again the same thing not dead Creed's
[1:44:48] but a little token they these Creed's
[1:44:52] deny that there is such a thing as a
[1:44:54] token they don't even believe there is
[1:44:56] such a thing as a token the baptism the
[1:44:57] Holy gold but we who believe the word
[1:45:00] know better know and it's just living
[1:45:04] presence for us in this day we separated
[1:45:06] from dead works and the Holy Ghost comes
[1:45:09] in to confirm the word and make it so
[1:45:11] Hebrews 13:8 proves that to us proves
[1:45:15] that God has raised him up for us
[1:45:19] according to his promise were thousands
[1:45:24] of years has passed 2,000 years almost
[1:45:27] as past but what is it that token still
[1:45:29] holds that God raised up on the third
[1:45:33] day if you just got the word that's all
[1:45:37] you got but when the talking is applied
[1:45:40] then Christ is reality to you and he
[1:45:44] does today like he did Dan so it throws
[1:45:47] it right back and earth up again they
[1:45:50] can't get around it God promised it and
[1:45:52] here it is but the tokens not to be
[1:45:54] applied
[1:45:55] you take the token event and we accept
[1:45:58] his sacrifice blood then he gives us
[1:46:01] life the life of the token and it is a
[1:46:04] promise seal Ephesians 4:30 grieve not
[1:46:07] the Holy Spirit of God whereby you are
[1:46:09] sealed unto the day of your Redemption
[1:46:11] then being baptized into him first
[1:46:14] Corinthians 12 we become part of his
[1:46:17] body and in him is the fullness in him

[1:50:20] the tokens the evidence that the way has
[1:50:23] been paid and we've accepted it and to
[1:50:25] prove it God gave us the token the sign
[1:50:28] that we was received minister said to me
[1:50:31] one time said brother BAM abraham
[1:50:33] believed God and it was imputed to him
[1:50:35] for righteousness that's true said what
[1:50:37] more can a man do but believe I said
[1:50:39] that's exactly right
[1:50:40] then more do you get this Holy Ghost
[1:50:41] outside of a bleeding
[1:50:42] I said but he give him the seal of
[1:50:44] circumcision as a confirmation of his
[1:50:46] failure hey man and if he's never give
[1:50:49] you the baptism the Holy Ghost then he
[1:50:52] hasn't confirms your faith that you say
[1:50:53] you had but the token is a confirmation
[1:50:56] I say I got the money I paid it in the
[1:50:59] office down there but you've got to show
[1:51:00] the token that's right when I shoulder
[1:51:03] token I got a right and when I can
[1:51:05] shoulder token of the Holy Spirit you've
[1:51:07] got the right to any purchase saying
[1:51:09] that Jesus Christ by part it's the token
[1:51:11] watch just a moment as we close hold a
[1:51:14] token over your unwavering faith in the
[1:51:19] promise word I believe that Jesus said
[1:51:22] ask the Father anything in money out of
[1:51:25] it hold your token over that promise
[1:51:28] word and walk right to I'm the Lord
[1:51:32] heals all that is easy he was wounded
[1:51:34] for our transgressions but his tribe
[1:51:35] sighs he'll take my token of the Holy
[1:51:38] Spirit this is me hold it over my prayer
[1:51:41] and say Lord God you promised it when I
[1:51:45] see the token I will reward you I
[1:51:49] promise to do it he can't do nothing
[1:51:51] else he look right through the blood of
[1:51:52] his own son there's a token aplanet
[1:51:55] he has to do it because he promised it
[1:51:57] he could not go into a house the death
[1:51:59] angel destroyer and take one out he
[1:52:01] couldn't do it because there was a blood
[1:52:03] of the Lamb the requirement of Jehovah
[1:52:05] and the requirement of in today is the
[1:52:07] blood of his own son Jesus Christ and a
[1:52:09] token of the Holy Ghost we haven't got
[1:52:13] it we might be Baptist Presbyterian
[1:52:15] Lutheran Pentecostals whatever we might
[1:52:18] be we might shop screen we might be also
[1:52:21] educated that has not one thing to do
[1:52:23] with it you must present the token then
[1:52:28] you're subject for the resurrection
[1:52:30] because of resurrecting powers already
[1:52:32] in you the token is the resurrection
[1:52:35] power showing that Jesus raised up from
[1:52:37] the dead
[1:52:38] and you're all right is from the dead
[1:52:40] the dead things of unbelief and have
[1:52:42] been all made alive in the word of Jesus
[1:52:44] Christ
[1:52:45] you believe it and the word lives to you
[1:52:48] if he abide me in my word in u.s. what
[1:52:50] you will st. John 14:12 he doesn't
[1:52:53] believe it in me the works that I do
[1:52:56] shall do also greater than shall he do
[1:52:59] because I go to the Father
[1:53:00] a little while the world sees me more
[1:53:02] yet you shall see me because I'll be
[1:53:05] with you even in you how did enough the
[1:53:08] body is sitting at the right hand of the
[1:53:10] man but the token that you have received
[1:53:12] it and he's giving back to you take that
[1:53:14] token it came anything you wish to I'm
[1:53:18] policy I've always said on that two
[1:53:21] classes of people the fundamentals in
[1:53:23] the Pentecostals the fun of those
[1:53:25] positionally studies the scriptures and
[1:53:27] figured out they say we're we're sons of
[1:53:29] God they believe that yes sir but they
[1:53:31] don't have any faith with it but the
[1:53:33] Pentecostals has a lot of faith and they
[1:53:35] don't know they're sons of God like a
[1:53:37] man money in a bank can't write a check
[1:53:39] the other garage check got no money
[1:53:40] tonight if you could just ever get the
[1:53:42] thing together two men and women could
[1:53:44] realize you there's been truly baptized
[1:53:46] into the Holy Spirit and you have the
[1:53:48] token in history you have a right to
[1:53:50] every dipti blessings of God from
[1:53:53] everything that he promised is yours
[1:53:55] hold your token over your unwavering
[1:53:58] faith as you pray and over his word
[1:54:00] faith in his word God once gave a token
[1:54:04] to the people and that was a rainbow
[1:54:06] look II listen close for closing God
[1:54:10] ever remained true to that token way
[1:54:14] back in the days of North the
[1:54:16] destruction of the andalusian world God
[1:54:18] gave this nation or give the world a
[1:54:20] rainbow sign for a token and God ever
[1:54:26] displays is talking as a thousands of
[1:54:29] years rolled by he never fails because
[1:54:32] he watches his tokens all these
[1:54:35] thousands of years these display twos
[1:54:37] shown us that he never fails to honor
[1:54:40] the token he never fails to honor he
[1:54:44] expects us now to display the token over
[1:54:47] our faith to Satan's group and the
[1:54:50] unbelievers and cults and so forth they
[1:54:52] don't believe in that we believing what
[1:54:56] he is said of his promises and that
[1:54:58] Jesus Christ has raised up from the dead
[1:55:00] showing himself alive and that is the
[1:55:03] badge the token of identification
[1:55:05] because it's price own
[1:55:08] five in you identifying the word it
[1:55:12] doesn't need anything yes
[1:55:14] that's the token without the token shows
[1:55:18] that there is paid shows that your
[1:55:21] subject for the resurrection that God
[1:55:23] that same power that raised up Jesus
[1:55:25] from the grave you're holding within
[1:55:28] yourself as a token the Holy Ghost in
[1:55:32] you is the token that brings you from
[1:55:35] the grave because the token is God the
[1:55:38] Holy Spirit which is eternal life coming
[1:55:41] from the Greek word Zoe
[1:55:43] which means God's own life in you that's
[1:55:48] the only thing that pays the price
[1:55:50] if that Tolkien isn't there how are you
[1:55:53] going to raise brother sister tonight

[2:22:12] under such great expectation for the
[2:22:14] words of your prophet Lord that you
[2:22:17] taught us through Scripture that voice
[2:22:20] of God comes through the prophets and
[2:22:23] Lord however the random labored for so
[2:22:26] many years to lay words seeds that
[2:22:29] somebody would come and a people would
[2:22:31] come and on the vm messenger would be
[2:22:34] the final voice that a finally it's so
[2:22:36] refreshing that in the year 2018 we can
[2:22:40] hear these words and it's so real to us
[2:22:42] that the law we have to apply the token
[2:22:45] and the token makes us act a certain way
[2:22:47] it makes us behave a certain way it
[2:22:49] gives us as brother Branham said our
[2:22:51] right to every redemptive blessing or
[2:22:54] right to healing a right to victory a
[2:22:56] writer overcome a right to access the
[2:22:59] heavenlies and and he brought such a
[2:23:01] beautiful type of how you would have to
[2:23:03] normally pay for the token and present

[2:35:10] believers are already on their way
[2:35:12] but the Solomon mechina is already
[2:35:14] honest we should be here tomorrow Lord
[2:35:17] willing from Ghana he and his wife and
[2:35:19] over the next couple these the believers
[2:35:22] begin to arrive so be under great
[2:35:24] expectation and there are a few things
[2:35:26] that need to be done to the end over the
[2:35:29] next couple days so if you're available
[2:35:31] to help and support certainly do let the
[2:35:33] trustees know and in what way you would
[2:35:36] give support
[2:35:38] there'll be no service this coming
[2:35:40] Thursday we like to ask maintenance
[2:35:43] group three please meet it by the Andy
[2:35:45] after the service there will also be a
[2:35:47] choir practice after the service and
[2:35:50] we'd like to remind you with respect to
[2:35:53] the lunches we'd like you to pee for the
[2:35:57] lunches to D and certainly check the
[2:36:00] menus that are on the notice board and
[2:36:04] comander great expectation we have three
[2:36:07] wonderful days in the presence of the
[2:36:09] Lord there will be three services on
[2:36:11] Friday the current schedule is 10:00
[2:36:14] a.m. Friday morning then 3:00 p.m. is
[2:36:18] our second service and then we're
[2:36:19] targeting a 6:00 p.m. start for the
[2:36:21] third service on Friday and then for the
[2:36:24] Saturday and Sunday we have two services
[2:36:27] each day 10 a.m. and which are getting 4
[2:36:30] p.m. on Saturday and same 10 a.m. and 4
[2:36:33] p.m. on Sunday evening and if the Lord
[2:36:37] allows us we will have a prayer line on
[2:36:40] the Sunday evening service but we looked
[2:36:43] to the Lord how he will take care of
[2:36:46] that because we are an expectation one
[2:36:48] day we wouldn't need to have a prayer
[2:36:50] line and as the word goes forth sick
[2:36:53] would be healed by the Branham promises
[2:36:54] just coming a time when right now he
[2:36:56] said we lay hands on the sick but at
[2:36:58] that time
[2:36:59] we command the Devils to leave and we
[2:37:01] are in a season where God does stuff
[2:37:04] unexpectedly they were there any upper
[2:37:06] room praising thee one expectation they
[2:37:09] didn't know how exactly didn't know when
[2:37:11] exactly but in the Bible said all of a
[2:37:14] sudden they came a sound from heaven and
[2:37:16] I love that all of a sudden because if
[2:37:18] you come under expectation and and and
[2:37:21] and as brother Branham said in the
[2:37:22] Silver City this has nothing to do with
[2:37:24] anybody else it's about you as an
[2:37:26] individual coming on the expectation for
[2:37:29] the token to be applied on your life and
[2:37:31] that's my expectation I believe it's
[2:37:34] your expectation and for those that are
[2:37:35] traveling from Ghana from Ivory Coast
[2:37:38] from South Africa from Europe from South
[2:37:40] America from the u.s. they are coming
[2:37:43] under expectation is not it's not just
[2:37:45] for us to come and on a pier it's for us
[2:37:47] to get something from the Lord for us to
[2:37:49] be drawn closer to Christ and to have a
[2:37:51] real experience because friends this
[2:37:53] will is finished this will is finished
[2:37:56] there's no more hope there's no out
[2:37:59] there is no solution there's no
[2:38:00] government there's no regime there's
[2:38:02] nothing this world can offer but there's
[2:38:05] only safety in Christ not in Church in
[2:38:07] Christ that's where the safety lies and
[2:38:10] the token that's the identification it's
[2:38:12] God identifying with you it's easy for
[2:38:15] us to see we're identified but when God
[2:38:18] identifies with you that's our
[2:38:20] expectation so may the Lord richly bless
[2:38:22] you be and pray this week make the
[2:38:25] sacrifice make the effort I can
[2:38:27] guarantee you whatever sacrifice you
[2:38:29] make for the kingdom of God God will
[2:38:32] give you returns abundantly more than
[2:38:34] you could ever expect or ask so may the
[2:38:36] Lord bless you brother Anthony a man you
[2:38:40] love him today please go get my hand a
[2:38:43] praise one more time give me key for
[2:38:45] that song through the blood as you get
[2:38:47] ready to leave amen ashes come forward

[2:39:11] we need some help with some chair
[2:39:13] adjustments right after service so if
[2:39:15] some of the brothers could just stay
[2:39:16] back for some help with the chairs you
[2:39:18] want to rearrange some of the chairs
