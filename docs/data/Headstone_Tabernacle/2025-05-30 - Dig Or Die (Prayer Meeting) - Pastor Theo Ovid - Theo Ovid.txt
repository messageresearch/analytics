May the word spoken tonight be inspiring to your children, that they will dash into your blessings, that they will dash into your presence, that they will connect with this risen, re resurrected Christ, ever present to fulfill your promised word, looking over your word, looking to confirm your word with signs, wonders, and miracles. We thank you for sending this end time message. We thank you for sending words of life, words in due season. We thank you that we are, oh God, feasting on this unfailing bodywood of the son of man. We appreciate all what you have done for us. We thank in advance for what you're about to do tonight. We thank you in advance what you're going to do on Sunday, Father God, and throughout the week. Granted, Lord, that your presence be with us this night in Jesus mighty I ask it. Amen. God bless you and welcome. And you have your Bibles. I'd like you to turn with me to 2 Kings chapter 3. We want to look into that scripture. Read a couple of verses. Second Kings chapter 3, reading from verse one. Now Jehoram, the son of Ahab, began to reign over Israel in Samaria, the 18th year of Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, reigned 12 years and reigned 12 years. And he wrote even in the sight of the Lord, but not like his father and like his mother. For he put away the image of Baal that his father had made. Note here that God made an actual comparison. This man is an evil man, not as evil as his father because he did this positive, that positive. Nevertheless, here we go. Verse three. He cleaved unto the sins of Jerobam, the son of Nebat, which made Israel to sin. He departed not there from. And Misha, king of Moab, was a sheep master, and rendered unto the king of Israel and 100,000 lambs and 100,000 rams with wool. And it came to pass when Ahab was dead, that the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel. And King Jaram went out of Samaria the same time, and numbered all Israel. He went and sent to Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah, saying, The king of Moab had rebelled against me. Will thou go with me against Moab to battle? He said, I will go up. I am as thou art. My people as I as thy people and my horses as thy horses. And he said, which way shall we go up? He said, the way through the wilderness of Edom. So the king of Israel went and the king of Judah, the king of Edom, and they fetched a compass of seven days journey, and there was no water for the host and for the cattle that followed them. And the king of Israel said, "Alas, that the Lord had called these three kings together to deliver them into the hand of Moab." But Jehoshaphat said, "Is there not here a prophet of the Lord, that we may inquire of the Lord by him?" And one of the king of Israel's servants answered and said, "Here is Elisha, the son of Chaffhat, which poured water on the hands of Elijah." And Jehoshaphat said, "The good word of the Lord is with him." So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to him. And Elisha said unto the king of Israel, "What have I to do with thee? Get thee to the prophets of thy father and to the prophets of thy mother." And the king of Israel said unto him, "Nay, for the Lord had called these three kings together to deliver them into the hand of Moab." Elijah said, "As the Lord of hosts livesth before whom I stand, surely wait not for I regard the presence of Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah, I will not look towards thee, nor see thee. Now bring me a minstrel." And it came to pass when the minstrel played that the hand of the Lord came upon him. Let's make a little pause right here. The prophet here is upset. He is completely lose it seeing this guy fooling around but he respected Jehoshaphat and to get in the spirit he asked for someone to come and play some music a minstrip and when the minstrel played the hand of the lord came upon him so prophecies and visions can't come dry it can't come you solidly in your flesh solidly in the humanistic realm and looking for vision and looking for this it doesn't come that way. This prophet who have a gift of catching God's mind and the intelligence of God, he has to get full in the spirit. Then he said, "Thus say the Lord." This is God speaking now, "Make the this valley full of ditches." Verse 17. For thus sayeth the Lord, he shall not see wind, neither shall ye see rain, yet that valley shall be filled with water, that you may drink both ye and your cattle and your beast. And this is about a light thing in the sight of the Lord. He will deliver the moit moabites also into their hand. Note here how God's encouragement to them is, don't look with your eyes. Don't look what you see, but there's going to be water. You shall not see wind, neither shall you see rain, yet water. So God actually put them on a high level of expectation in faith to believe that this thing is going to happen. Let's continue 19. and you shall smite every fence city, every choice city, and shall fell every good tree, and stop all the wells of water, and mar every good piece of land with stones. And it came to pass in the morning when the meat offering was offered, that behold, there came water by the way of Edom, and the country was filled with water. And when all the Moabites heard that the kings were come up to fight against them, they gathered all that they were able to put on armor and upward and stood at the border in the border. And they rose early in the morning and the sun shone upon the water. Get this. And they rose early in the morning, and the sun shone upon the water, and the Moabites saw the water on the other side as red as blood. And they said, "This is blood. The kings are surely slain, and they have smitten one another." Now therefore, Moab to the spoil. When they came to the camp of Israel, the Israel rose up and smoked the Moabites so that they fled before them and they went forward smiting the Moabites even in their country. And they beat down the cities and every good piece of land, cast every man stone, and filled it. They stopped all the wells of water and fell all the good trees. Only in Persette left there the stones thereof. How be it the slingers went about it and smoked it. May God bless his word. What a word tonight. whatever reason another thought I want to share with you. Dig or die. That's it. Dig or die. And brother Brandham talk about I believe it's time now that the Pentecostal church has recognized what is done. The real spiritfilled leaders, spiritfilled Christians, they recognize something happened. They have cooled off because everybody's trying to live on the mountaintop going off without God. What we need today is to get back to God. Get back to the experience. They recognize that they were out there without fruit, no love, fussing one another. your oneness, your triness, you belong to your assembly, your church of God, calling one another bad names and other bad names. You see how brother bring it? No fruit. And the world turns around and look and say, "What's the matter with them people? Both of them speaking in tongues, prophesying, and they don't even respect one another." We could say it this way. Look at them in the message. All them has spoken on books. All them say they believe Malachi 4 and look at the behavior. They haven't got any decency for each other. What we need today is back to the fruit of the spirit. Love, joy, peace, faith, longsuffering. God can send a gift among them and they will call it telepathy. They will call it the devil. They will call it something else. If one church is sponsoring it, the other one because this one has something to do with it, it is no good. What a pitiful condition. The thing of it is the church went off without God. They went off. They found the fruit of the spirit has left the church. Longsuffering. Some of them have enough temper to fight a bus. And you talk about the holy ghost. Now the fruit of the spirit is love, joy, suffering. So longsuffering's fruit all dried up. That's where the church has got till the fruit of the spirit is drying up everywhere. We see it everywhere. We know it is truth. Here we go. So when they came to this prophet, what a ri he got into. This might kindly hurt his sanctification a little bit, but he really got boiled up. He said to Jehoram, he said, "Why don't you go on to your own prophet? Why don't you get to your mommy prophet? Why don't you go to your daddy prophet? Go over to them formers now. You're in trouble. Why don't you go on to them?" But the Lord brought us out here. We are going to die. We are going to get killed. You are not only going to die. You're already dead. All the fruits are dried up and the spirit going on to the church has just become a religious organization. That's right. Something is wrong. If we can't get God back in the church somewhere, what are we going to do? They going to perish. And then this prophet, listen, after he got through balling him out, he said, "If it wasn't for that respected, I respected the presence of Jehoshaphat, that elected man, I wouldn't even look at you." Oh, he had to get his temper down a little bit, you know. He said, "Bring me a ministre." He got heat up. He said, "Bring me a ministre." And listen to what man interject here. What about some of you Church of Christ people so-called that don't believe in music in the church? After he got heat up, he needed a little music to bring the spirit on him. That's right. Yes, sir. Now, remember, God doesn't change. And if the good music brought the spirit on the prophet, then it will do the same thing today. He said, "Bring me a minstrel." Well, I ain't a prophet, but maybe you can be part of the minstrel. You can do something towards it. You got a testimony of something you can do. The Holy Spirit is run the church. So, when the spirit came on us, came on, what was the vision the spirit give to the prophet. What did he see? Now, take all your soldiers out and school them over. No, he said get to digging. And tonight, if you look closer, this is putting those same people to work. He didn't say go and get hammocks and swing. He didn't say go and pill your toes by the beach. He said don't don't just listen to spoken word and tapes and just relax yourself. It's relaxing time. You find that quote is relaxing time. Relax yourself. No, he said go and dig. In other words, there is something for you to do. He said go and dig. Get to digging. out in the desert. You people once crossed this desert. He said God gave it to them after grace was done. So I want to say tonight this grace thing, you know, God will work it out and you just dare in la line la land and taking things for granted and living an entitled life that supposed to work out and you don't want to do one thing. You're just waiting for the train to be moving to jump on. It's not going to work like that. He said, "You know what?" You say, "Listen, you know what it does to throw a log in a channel? What does it?" All kind of dirt hits against this log and washes up. So you have a river flowing and you throw a log in it, it blocks it. Then first thing you know, you got all kind of water backed up like beavers do and make a dam and they got nothing to go through it. He said, "We have got so much beaver preachers today trying to dam up the water and say this is ours. This is just us here. This belong to us. Then is the us preachers. He called them beaver preachers. And that's what happened because they limit God to their group, their tabernacle, their church, their ministry, their gift. They limit God to that. So they can't receive nobody else nor the church. They're on their own beat. That's what happened today. It become stagnated. That's what happened to a lot of organization. And you know stagnated water gets these wiggle tails in it. That's what the church get wiggle tail. these miracles pass and and and and and so on like that. So then the prophet said get down there and dig all them luggs out. I tell then prophet should we go back and have another mighty Russian win? Nope. Shall we start another latter rain? Nope. Just clean out the channel. That's all you got to do tonight church. Do you hear from the word? What God want is a cleaned out channel. Cleaned out channels. We got the people. Just clean out the channel. The people is all right. Get the channels cleaned out so the Holy Spirit can come in. All your fanatism isms, everything else that's in the church, clean the thing out. The rock is already smitten. The waters are fresh running, but our ecclesical systems have damned up the stream. He said, "Clean those things out. You won't have to have another rushing wind. You won't hear wind nor serene. But yet there'll be water. Oh brother, not a new system. Not a new system. We need what we need is a cleaned out system. We got not make another assemblies of God, another oneness. Get all the logs out of it. All the differences. You see about logs and you start to specify, get some specifics. Get all the differences, the fussing, the stewing. This is not only in church. This is in homes also. Husband and wife, father and son, mother and daughter, family stuff. Get with all the fussing, the stewing and thing like that away from them. The waters will go to flowing back again. There'll be love, joy, a joy like a river flowing over everybody. Just in love with one another. We are not divided. All one body. We one in hope and doctrine, one in charity. That is what we must do. That's the vision of today. That's what the prophet saw in the vision. The true prophet got the same vision today. not a new organization, not another group. You just fuss it out. One place he said is just taking people going from one church to church to next is like one corpse going to our next morg. It's just from morg to morg the shifting. I first start out a ministry many of them come to me and said well brother Brian you ought to start a little organization. I said organization but that is what I'm against. I said what we need is not an organization but clean up the things we have got. That's right. Clear this up. We need a revival. What we need is a digging time. So listen friends, if you think brother or the ministry will be digging for you, you you have to think again because each person have to dig. I have to dig. You have to dig. Every individual have to dig. This is not a Catholic church, a Catholic system where the priest doing the digging and you just doing the drinking and you just, you know, they leave it up to the ministry to dig water for you. It's not working like that. What we need is not an organization, but to clean up the things we've got. That's right. Fear, we need a revival. We need a digging time. Dig. Dig. The deeper you dig, the more water you're going to get. If you dig down and say, "Well, I just come out of oation and look all the stuff you got here. Malice, stripe, anything that clean out the ditch till you go plum down to solid rock. Get down to where the water can really come pouring out of Emanuel's vein. Dig out all the ditches. Get down in these valleys. You fellows have been trying to live on the housetop up there. This is interesting. I just love this here. He's addressing people who always trying to live on the housetop. And and this here affects their humility and their submission to God because they live in a world of pride where all the answers is I'm top of the mountain. on top of the day um um everything in order and you know they don't have this how should I say it at the cross experience Calvary experience the valley experience the humility experience they shun these kind of experiences because God would set things up in a way for us to be for lack of words humiliated or be humbled that we could have a humble heart humble mind humble thinking this is what God wants so trying to live on the housetop sometimes missing God's program. He say shouting, jumping, freezing, frying, everything else. Well, well, he said, "Don't do that. Get down here like where we are tonight and dig out these ditches down low here and get some fresh water. That's what we need." Almost done. Get down and get a hold of water. What we need tonight is the water of God. The vision absolutely interpret God's will to a dying perishing people. The vision tonight of the Lord is to clean out this thing. Clean out not start a new organization. Start a revival in organization. Start a new meeting. Start letting God come in. Dig out your old faultf finding backbiting stiff necks and superstition. Throw the thing out. Well, I tell you, brother Brandham, it would mean this. I don't care what it means. You either dig or die. That is where I get it from. Dig or die. All you Chicago Methodists get digging. Chicago Baptist get digging or perish. Chicago Pentecostal get digging. So, he's addressing all of them. Dig out the things. Throw it out. I will I tell you, thus sayeth the Lord, unless you dig out this corruption that's in there, you will perish. your fruit and church will dry up and die. Dig it out. So this word is as at it starts at a personal level at an individual level and it goes straight up to the church level. Dig out the corruption that is in your life, in your mind, in your spirit, in your behavior, in your attitude. He said you won't hear another latter rain, another former rain, whatever it is, but there will be water and peace like a river flowing through every heart. Yes, sir. You will see signs and wonders. There's not a if. You will see signs and wonders and miracles and the powers of God returning back into the church in a real flowing Pentecost just coming down. Yes, sir. The spirit's message we will start digging or start perishing. So, let me ask you a question tonight. What are you going to do tonight? What you going to do in your own heart, in your own mind, in your home? What are you going to do? Are you going to dig or you going to say well message you know what I mean hallelujah glory I ain't reaching nowhere after the hallelujah and glory you have to dig you have to dig I heard one time a brothers talking about the people in the church don't study the message they depend upon what come from the pulpit and whenever the man now after a while when he preaches how to twist things they don't even recognize what he's saying is not in the Bible what he's saying is not in the and they get twists a few degrees and after 10 years, 15 years, they plum off the beaten track, believe in all kind of crazy stuff. But that is not what we are here about. We're here for you to dig, dig for your own self. Yes, sir. The spirit message, we will start digging or start perishing. And there was already perishing so that to dig it out. Dig it out. Get cleaned up deeper. More you dig, the better off you'll be. Oh my. Hallelujah. They was out there one time perishing the same way that you are. But there's channels out there. There's plenty of channels where the rock will still lay in the wilderness yonder. That's the vision tonight, my brother. Here we go. It ain't starting your organization. He's saying back the same thing. Just dig out what's in it. The first thing that old rotten log of organization, throw it out the channel. The channel of God's blessing is all stuffed up tonight. Organization logs laying in there. You see, if you accept yourself as you are and how they say it to me, I'm only human. I want the worst excuse you can tell. You're not an animal. I'm only human. I'm just a man. What you talking about? Jesus died to release a spirit that we could get out of the humanist. Not to make an excuse. I'm only human. All of us are human. We're not animals, half, half monkey. We are humans. That God see sinners. And that God sent his love and Christ blood to save us. not to remain as sinners. But when you see you get religious and you believe that God have to accept you in your condition as you are and you remain as you are, that's a religious spirit. That's a demon. You have to understand that whatever kicking in you that's off he it has to go and you have to fight and you have to dig. You can't just see because when you see you accept things it come like you acceptable like you know you know we have an extension now we're kind of tall. So God lives with us now. You know what I mean? You you you you have extra meat and extra pork and extra thing feeding your golad instead of cutting his head off. You mining golad just raising house and giving him height to come in and whatn not you because you're not tall as him. You letting him rule you and the prophet talking about the sin that rule you. You have to come back to rule it. That's what we talking about. So you have to begin to see that you don't want to be comfortable because that is what people want. They want to get comfort in their sin. They want to be comfortable in their attitude and spirit. Nothing moves them. But when your pillow come hard like rock and go your bed come like bricks like like needles like nails sticking you then you say you know what enough is enough. That prodigal son he took a while before he came to himself. You he was bluffing his way. He was talking his way through. You know he was coming to the big house and people don't know he live in the band behind the house. He was doing all kind of fancy stuff and things. It's still wearing little treads, fancy clothes and whatnot. But he was eating pig food. That is what the that the revelation that the others did not have of him. He was eating pig food. And when he come to the spot where he get so fed up, he said this didn't make any sense. Let just reason this out. The people in my house, my father's house and servant getting good food, getting five course menu, six course menu, getting dessert, getting everything and I eating p food here. This make no sense. I going back home. I go and repent tonight and I want to encourage you tonight. If you find yourself eating big food, find yourself all messed up. Isn't it time to go back home? Isn't it time you can't go back home? You got to repent. He rehearsed it. I was sent to my father. I have sinned. You know what? What's happening there? He's coming down now. He's digging for Clarence. He's digging on the inside. He's searching himself. He recognized he made an out and he prepared to come back as a servant. That's the level of humility that he came down to. prepared to come as a servant and go and and his father was ready to receive him with fatted calf hooked and a robe ready to receive him as a son. Isn't God wonderful? Regardless of what you go through, God comes around ready to receive you as a son, ready to put a robe on you, ready to clothe you and feed you and bless you. Let's close tonight. Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord. I trust the Lord that this will be helpful to you. Just want to finish up one part here now. So they they say, "Isn't there a prophet to consult?" And they consulted Elijah and we know what happened. They got water and so on. But a brand Satan has got every gun in hell trained on it this tabernacle. He will cause one person to do something that is contrary to what another thinks. He's going to do that. He's up to it. That's his business. If he can get somebody to say something, somebody to talk about another and listen. Did you know so and so did so and so? Don't you listen to it. Don't you listen to it at all. That's the devil. Don't you believe it. But you know what you have? You have the gossip and spirit. I have the people who love to hear gossip. So that's a powerful combination. That's like the cap. That's like mechanics and dynamics. The gossiper can't wait to offload and the hearer can't wait to hear. And that is a winning combination for Satan to make that melee a whole canal inside of there. The gossiper. So once you start to checkmate the gossipers and say no no no stop it, hold it. You shut them down. You give them no room to move. They either straighten up or they take the gossip party somewhere else. We need to do that. We need to shut down people. We need to tell them that what you're speaking there doesn't edify, it doesn't build up, it doesn't strengthen, it doesn't help. In other words, it makes no sense. You may as well kill it and get something inspired from God. Oh, let's continue here. I want to finish off here. Brother Brandon, if there's anything that somebody has done wrong, pray for them. Don't pray for them in a selfish way. I know it's my duty. I've got to pray for that brother. No, you take it to your heart really down. across the nation will come. Those who are dead in Christ will rise first. The rapture will take place. The church will be taken home. Then the tribulation will set. Oh my. We don't want to be there during that time. I don't want to be there in the tribulation. No. God forbid that any of us would ever be there during that time because he that is filthy filty still. He is holy, holy still. He is righteous is righteous still. The lamb had come forth with his book of redemption. The bride has been taken out. Those who turn it down has to go through a tribulation period, both Jew and Gentile. What a time of tribulation. I don't want that. Lord, sanctify me now. That's good Nazarene doctrine, ain't it? An old caller brother said, "Sir, I got my ticket in my hand. It's already punched. When I come down to the river that morning, I don't want no trouble. That's about right. I don't want no trouble. Hold your ticket in your hand cuz we're going over. Just think the great time of redemption is at hand. And this is the final quote. Just keep praying like tonight. Keep digging. Yeah. Don't stop. Just like when Elijah told them, dig ditches out there. When you get down, here we go. And you hit an old tin can. say, "I'm too tired." Show it out of the way and keep digging. Just keep digging. Cuz you've got to dig. You have just got to dig. That's all. Cuz if you expect to miss the tribulation, you better start digging. Did you hear that, church? Brother Brandham said, if you expect to miss the tribulation, you better start digging. So, I want to encourage you tonight to pray and dig. Pray for your brothers. Pray for your sisters. Pray for the service. Pray for one another. Let's get down in prayer. Father God, I thank you tonight for your spirit, for your word. Couldn't wait to get to deliver this tonight and is delivered. Father, take it and write it in the hearts of your children that each individual here under the song of my voice will go to digging, Lord. And as they dig, as room is made, may your spirit fill that hole, fill that space, fill that gap. In Jesus name I ask it. Amen. And amen. And God bless you as we get on in prayer tonight.

Thank you for drawing us closer to you, Father. Thank you for the thirst you put in our hearts, the cry you put in our souls for more of you to long after you, Father. Lord, you said that the love of many in wax cold. The pro the prophet said that only love will be among the elect, oh God, because of iniquity. I would abound the love of many in wax cold. But Father God, may it cleans us all iniquity. Cleanse them all unbelief. Cleanse them pride, oh God. And to humble ourselves before you and begin to dig deeper and search our own hearts, oh Lord. search our own lives to wait and to cry into you once more. Lord, bless your people in a special way. Bless the sick in our midst. Bless the sick need a touch from you. May heaven come down and minister healing and minister virtue and strength. Blessed is this courage, Father God. And give them encouragement to press the battle, Father. We cannot give up now. We have a great work to do. You call us to do this work. You call us to be responsible for this end time message, Father God. You said that each one represent the kingdom of God. every Christian represent your kingdom. We want to represent it right. Oh God, may you come and shine upon us Lord to think right, to speak right, to do right, to act right, to live right, to walk right, oh God, and everything will come out right. Father God, I commit the Sunday service into your hands that there will be explosion of your righteousness, explosion of your holiness and the purity, oh God, that you would speak to our hearts, Lord, and convince us of your word, Lord, and and move us by your spirit, Father. Inspire us by the anointing of God. Grant it, Lord. I commit the church into your hands, the leadership, Father God, the the ministry, the elders, the deacons, oh God, the ushers, the entire body of believers, Father, I commit them into your hands that you would keep them and preserve them in Jesus name I ask it. Amen and amen. Decisions are choices and decisions have fruits. The fruits are the results or the consequences of our decisions. And if we decide not to act, that is also a decision. But I don't think you have a choice tonight. You dig or you die. I hope that will register in your spirits, in your mind that you either dig or die. God bless you. Thanks again for being here tonight. God be with you.
