[28:24] seated praise the name of the lord
[28:28] okay our title tonight and the title is
[28:32] for those who love his appearance
[28:36] that's the title tonight for those who
[28:37] love his appearance
[28:40] praise the lord i have an inspiration
[28:42] don't be wary the word manifested
[28:46] is the light of the hour oh praise the
[28:48] name of the lord
[28:50] and i want to share this with you
[28:52] tonight
[28:53] and uh god is my revelation
[28:56] my rock and the prophet shalom you're
[28:59] saying
[29:00] if you notice in the scripture the
[29:01] psalms it kept saying god is my rock
[29:04] do you know what a rock represent in the
[29:05] bible a rock in the bible represent the
[29:08] revelation of god
[29:09] god is my revelation the revelation of
[29:13] the word
[29:14] is the rock isn't that right goddess or
[29:18] rock and girls are a rock when god has
[29:20] been revealed to us
[29:22] that becomes a rock and we find out that
[29:25] god uh jesus told peter upon this rock
[29:27] i'll build my church
[29:28] and the gates of hell shall not reveal
[29:31] against it
[29:31] so not some man is iraq or the people is
[29:35] a rock or some headquarters in iraq
[29:37] god is the rock isn't that right
[29:40] and you say we are facing here uh
[29:44] arise and shine for the glory of god has
[29:45] come upon you the light is here
[29:47] and the very next verse he said gross
[29:49] darkness upon the people
[29:50] and when we are in a mixture of light
[29:53] and darkness
[29:55] and then my address to the church is
[29:57] shalom
[29:58] peace he said we are facing both
[30:00] darkness and light
[30:02] the world is in one of the most chaotic
[30:04] times of darkness
[30:06] that it ever stood in and yet it is
[30:08] standing and again
[30:09] the most blessed light that they ever
[30:11] shine in
[30:13] the difference is just like in the
[30:14] beginning and when there was gross
[30:15] darkness and upon the earth
[30:17] and the spirit of god moved upon the
[30:19] face of the water
[30:20] and god said let there be light and god
[30:23] separated the light from the darkness
[30:25] and i believe we are living in that hour
[30:27] again when god is separating light from
[30:30] darkness
[30:30] and he is pressing it to the other side
[30:33] of the world that the light
[30:34] might be made manifest oh glory to god
[30:38] and the reason i say shalom to them is
[30:40] because it is god's peace
[30:42] hallelujah we are looking forward to a
[30:44] break-in of a new day
[30:45] are you tonight or are you frustrated
[30:48] and fed up and you're
[30:49] amen you're tired you can't take it no
[30:51] more but we are looking forward
[30:53] hallelujah for a new day until there is
[30:56] something great laying ahead of us
[30:59] where the years has been the joy that we
[31:01] have looked forward to
[31:02] the pressing the coming of the great
[31:04] light oh glory to god my expectation is
[31:07] for that light
[31:08] not depressed that light hallelujah that
[31:10] power that presence isn't that something
[31:13] oh glory to god hallelujah now now we
[31:16] can see it breaking over the horizon
[31:18] the horizontal realm it is breaking
[31:20] between mortal and immortality
[31:22] we see it breaking between the heaven
[31:23] and the earth from earthbound sickness
[31:25] and trouble world
[31:26] onto a bright shining day of an immortal
[31:29] life
[31:29] an immortal body and immortal earth that
[31:32] shall never pass away
[31:34] oh glory it is shalom unto the church
[31:37] it's
[31:37] light coming to the believers but cross
[31:40] that is upon the people
[31:41] oh glory to god the people gonna be
[31:43] confused the people will be in
[31:45] frustration and fed up and they can't
[31:46] take it no more
[31:47] but light is promised to come upon you
[31:49] oh glory to god it will be seen upon you
[31:52] oh glory to god so don't be wary tonight
[31:55] no we find all the moon
[31:56] in this in the heavens is to reflect the
[31:58] light of the sun
[32:00] in the absence of the sun it's to give
[32:02] light around us it's not right
[32:04] it reflects it's not a perfect light
[32:06] because it's reflecting
[32:07] and the sun shine against the moon and
[32:09] the moon reflects its light
[32:11] in the absence of the sun but when the
[32:13] sun come up then the moon is not needed
[32:14] anymore
[32:15] and today the church is reflecting the
[32:18] light of the absent sun
[32:20] oh she says the church supposed to be
[32:22] reflecting the light
[32:24] isn't that right the church is the
[32:26] reflection of the light because he said
[32:28] a little while the will see it me no
[32:29] more but you want to see me and i'll be
[32:31] with you even in you to the end of the
[32:33] age
[32:33] and the works that i do hallelujah
[32:36] lights that he made manifest and no
[32:39] light
[32:39] you can't get no life except for light
[32:41] isn't that right and there is no light
[32:43] except through the word of god
[32:45] oh glory to god now the sun is the word
[32:48] of god
[32:48] in the beginning god said let there be
[32:50] light here we go and when the ma
[32:52] and when the manifested word of god when
[32:55] the word of god was manifested there was
[32:57] light
[32:58] but first god spoke it so when god said
[33:01] let there be light nothing move
[33:03] that was just spoken word you could
[33:05] write that down
[33:06] but when that light was manifested
[33:09] hallelujah
[33:10] praise god that was the light so when
[33:12] the word of god was manifested there was
[33:13] light
[33:14] first god spoke it what if he didn't
[33:16] what if it didn't manifest
[33:18] that it wasn't like yet but when he
[33:20] spoke it then it manifested
[33:22] vindicated his world was a vindicated
[33:25] light coming to existence
[33:26] so gross darkness blinding of israel was
[33:29] the lightning of the gentiles now the
[33:31] blind of the gentiles is the lighten up
[33:33] of israel
[33:34] oh glory to god forgot the light of
[33:35] israel gentle blindness and darkness of
[33:38] distract the gentiles
[33:39] do you believe that hallelujah and here
[33:42] we go now
[33:42] watch and the moon passing the way it
[33:44] did on the reflection of the darkness of
[33:46] the world blind and all this
[33:48] light is a reflection to us that the
[33:50] gentile church age is finished
[33:53] the church here we go is making the self
[33:55] ready
[33:56] he's been making herself ready for our
[33:58] time it's time for the rapture
[34:00] for darkness is fading upon the gentiles
[34:03] and the dawn
[34:04] will soon break upon the jews oh praise
[34:07] the name of the lord you love him
[34:08] tonight
[34:09] good people caught up in this thing good
[34:12] people sincere people
[34:13] like mary and joseph very sincere they
[34:16] went to the feast
[34:17] and jesus they were presuming he was
[34:19] with them but he wasn't
[34:21] good people today thinking the same
[34:23] thing they are organized
[34:24] in these churches and organization they
[34:26] think they're doing a good thing
[34:28] they are presuming he is with them when
[34:30] they are not see
[34:31] many people think he's with them they
[34:33] shook hands with the preacher
[34:34] put their name on the book but he wasn't
[34:36] oh glory to god they're good people mary
[34:39] and joseph
[34:39] good people but the facts was he wasn't
[34:42] there
[34:42] and here the bomb don't presume anything
[34:45] oh glory to god don't presume
[34:47] nothing that's what i said sunday i
[34:50] don't think i'm entitled to anything
[34:51] i'm only entitled to fight oh glory to
[34:54] god he tells joshua every place you put
[34:55] your foot is yours
[34:57] i am not here to take anything for
[34:58] granted church for granted
[35:00] people for granted amen believe us for
[35:03] granted praise god i
[35:04] have to stand here and preach to empty
[35:06] pews oh glory to god we're going to
[35:08] preach anyhow
[35:09] because there's an audience all day
[35:10] they'll have a heir to hear or what the
[35:12] spirit is saying
[35:14] oh glory to god as long as the spirit is
[35:16] speaking we want to be
[35:17] channels of communications for
[35:19] inspiration to flow right through
[35:21] oh hallelujah good people but the facts
[35:24] was he wasn't there with them
[35:26] don't resume anything oh glory to god
[35:28] what is like question
[35:30] the vindicated spoken word of god
[35:32] outside of that there is no light
[35:35] nothing what he says not spoken word
[35:39] vindicated spoken word outside of that
[35:42] there's no light
[35:43] you can't lighten the earth with
[35:44] flashlights it take god word made
[35:46] manifest
[35:47] they were good people notice the
[35:49] accuracy of the word
[35:50] now what about the light he said gross
[35:52] darkness would come upon the people
[35:54] and there would be light rise and shine
[35:56] for light just come how can there be
[35:58] darkness and light it's got to be
[35:59] separated
[36:01] and the only thing that separates it
[36:04] it's
[36:04] the word manifested separates
[36:08] so all this talk talk everybody talking
[36:10] everybody preaching everybody explaining
[36:12] and teaching
[36:12] right but there comes an hour when the
[36:15] world will be manifested
[36:17] and now go separate light from darkness
[36:20] because the word manifested oh give the
[36:22] lord a shout
[36:23] the word manifested is light hallelujah
[36:28] oh glory to god do you believe that the
[36:31] only one thing separates it
[36:34] the word manifested separates it presses
[36:37] it to the other side here
[36:39] there's darkness on the earth but when
[36:40] the manifested world the sun
[36:42] which was spoken in existence by the
[36:44] world shows itself darkness run to the
[36:46] other side
[36:47] another world has taken place now
[36:49] darkness separates itself
[36:50] from the light now to the elected church
[36:52] in the circle
[36:54] to the elected church in this dark hour
[36:56] in this corner of the vineyard
[36:58] in this while they press in every
[36:59] country every nation they're nothing
[37:01] against the bride and the pestilence
[37:02] come and take the whole will
[37:04] to try every man on the earth hallelujah
[37:06] with the attitude where they behave
[37:07] everything else
[37:08] and to see what your faith will do to
[37:10] see what you will anoint

[38:46] before day
[38:47] the blackout comes the moon failed to
[38:49] sign the tackle before there is because
[38:51] the light is present in the darkness
[38:54] oh glory to all them virus no the sons

[39:24] our names are on his book shalom good
[39:26] morning
[39:27] peace be unto you the darkness is
[39:29] separating some from the light
[39:31] god is causing it the light is doing it
[39:34] the light is pressing itself in such a
[39:36] way until the darkness have to
[39:38] congregate together
[39:39] they had a chance to accept it they
[39:41] wouldn't do it but isaiah 61 said i rise
[39:43] and shine
[39:44] for thy light has come that same light
[39:47] has come to what
[39:48] to manifest to make known to the people
[39:51] the promises he made for this day
[39:53] hallelujah
[39:54] glory to god when jesus come when he
[39:57] came he was the light of that day
[39:59] they were supposed to become a messiah
[40:00] he came just exactly like god said
[40:03] he was the light of the day he was
[40:06] the vindicated word that was spoken made
[40:10] manifest
[40:11] he was what the vindicated word that was
[40:14] spoken
[40:16] mean manifest oh glory to god for 50
[40:19] plus years
[40:20] we speak in vindicated word from a 20th
[40:22] century prophet
[40:24] the word already vindicated because he
[40:26] was vindicated
[40:27] hallelujah we were echoing a vindicated
[40:29] word now the same vindicated word had to
[40:31] become manifest
[40:33] oh give the lord a shout what manifest
[40:36] the vindicated word that was promised so
[40:39] what jesus
[40:40] said he was the light of the world the
[40:42] bible said he is the word
[40:44] and the manifested or
[40:47] the vindicated scripture is the light
[40:53] the manifested or the vindicated
[40:57] scripture
[40:58] is the light then he gonna say normal
[41:01] life
[41:02] can come outside of light light
[41:05] produces life there can be no
[41:09] life outside of light so the seas was
[41:12] laying in darkness in genesis
[41:14] but then when god said let there be
[41:16] light that produced
[41:18] life in the seed to comfort after it's
[41:21] kind
[41:22] the life couldn't comfort except the
[41:24] light comes
[41:25] oh glory to god so you need light to
[41:28] produce
[41:28] life are you with me now so there is no
[41:31] life outside of light
[41:33] natural or spiritual there must be and
[41:36] the only light can come by the word of
[41:38] god
[41:38] and god's word is light when it is
[41:41] manifested
[41:43] oh give the lord a shout wherever you
[41:45] are god's word is light
[41:46] when it is manifested it is just a
[41:50] seedling in here
[41:51] as god planted all the seeds oh glory to
[41:54] god
[41:54] god said in this dark gloomy dismal
[41:57] mercy world that stood here without
[41:59] light he said let there be light
[42:00] and it wasn't light until that world was
[42:02] manifested
[42:03] then it was light the gospel doesn't
[42:05] mean the past tracks
[42:07] that is fine the gospel is not going
[42:09] about teaching the bible that isn't the
[42:11] gospel
[42:11] it is written in the scriptures that the
[42:13] gospel didn't come true word only but
[42:16] through the power
[42:17] and demonstration of the holy spirit the
[42:20] gospel that is the word
[42:21] but the letter kill it but the spirit
[42:23] gave it life
[42:24] noah seed laying here on the pulpit it's
[42:27] just a seed
[42:28] until it dies and become dramatized it
[42:30] will never do anything
[42:31] so to see the word has to be manifest
[42:35] in order to be the gospel that is why
[42:37] you hear me over the years say i'm
[42:38] longing i'm waiting for the hour when
[42:40] i'm going to preach the gospel
[42:42] that is why i've been saying that
[42:44] because what we have a seed
[42:45] oh glory to god but this word manifest
[42:48] is the gospel
[42:49] oh give the lord a shout feel good
[42:51] tonight in the beginning was the word
[42:53] the word was with god and the word was
[42:55] god now depending upon the expression of
[42:57] thought
[42:58] now the word is the gospel is seed form
[43:03] oh let me just back up a little bit
[43:05] watch so god in the beginning
[43:07] give the thought of what it would be
[43:09] spoke the word of it
[43:10] to be we receive the word and it
[43:13] produces what god thought it was
[43:15] the word is the gospel in seed form
[43:18] so you say brother branham in our
[43:19] country you have acorn trees you would
[43:21] say
[43:21] would you give me a country i give you a
[43:23] acorn you have a country potentially
[43:26] but it is in seed form you can't say you
[43:30] absolutely got a tree until the seed
[43:33] produced the tree
[43:36] so regardless of what people claim
[43:38] that's just mo talking
[43:40] until it produced well preaching the
[43:42] word is the acorn
[43:44] but making it live is the gospel
[43:48] he promised the holy spirit that's the
[43:50] word and receiving the holy spirit
[43:52] will make it live and that is why he
[43:55] said no
[43:56] it pretends if these men if if they pick
[43:59] this up
[44:00] and go out they can make more sense to
[44:02] it to bring it to a place
[44:04] you would i just want to lay the seed
[44:07] and then i hope
[44:08] they make it come to life
[44:11] in other words he talked about men
[44:13] coming after him to make more sense to
[44:15] it not only to make more sense he said i
[44:18] hope
[44:21] they make it come to life hallelujah
[44:24] praise
[44:25] god let's continue the very next line is
[44:28] proof
[44:28] hallelujah that teaching the word
[44:31] wouldn't do it
[44:32] it said these signs shall follow them
[44:36] that believe
[44:39] you believe seven seals seven thunder
[44:41] seven mysteries seven what whatever
[44:43] steps you believe
[44:44] these signs shall follow them that
[44:47] believe
[44:48] these signs following you you have to be
[44:49] a little harder because this is the word
[44:51] here
[44:52] these signs shall follow them that
[44:54] believe that's a pentecostal there's a
[44:56] lie like the scriptures
[44:57] life of pentecost that's the word now
[45:00] who said that jesus said that
[45:02] now no man said that there's no
[45:03] explanation jesus said that
[45:05] these signs shall follow them that
[45:07] believe in my name they shall cast out
[45:10] devils
[45:10] evil spirits speak with new tongues take
[45:12] up serpents drink their bleedings
[45:14] it wouldn't harm them lions and the sick
[45:16] they shall recover
[45:17] oh glory to god and i believe we are
[45:19] living in a day when the holy spirit is
[45:21] moving upon the heart of people
[45:23] regardless of how much criticism how
[45:25] much fanaticism
[45:26] god is on the obligation to take that
[45:29] church
[45:30] out of the gentiles i'm convinced
[45:32] there's going to be a unity of the faith
[45:34] not unity of the message of the fate not
[45:36] once delivered to the saints
[45:38] oh glory to god hallelujah and the only
[45:41] way as god was jesus
[45:43] was the manifestation of god's spoken
[45:45] word the light of the hour
[45:47] am i so you walk in that light you
[45:49] baptist this is the light of the hour
[45:51] the light has come rise and shine the
[45:54] word light
[45:55] the manifested word of god identified is
[45:58] light
[45:59] oh glory to god so william branham that
[46:01] was the word made manifest
[46:03] of malachi 4. oh glory to god malachi 4
[46:06] prophesied
[46:06] for hundreds of years it was as lenient
[46:08] as a text but when william
[46:10] step out and connect with malachi for
[46:12] scripture then that word of malachi 4
[46:14] became flesh
[46:15] he elijah shall forerun the second
[46:17] coming of the messiah
[46:19] all glory to god he shall turn the
[46:20] hearts of the children back to the faith
[46:22] of the fathers
[46:23] oh glory to god hallelujah glory to god
[46:26] to all this world being scattered up
[46:28] all this loose has been tied up what's
[46:30] the layer platform
[46:31] of the conductor of the word that the
[46:33] spirit could feel freely
[46:35] oh glory to god there was no contingency
[46:37] of the word hallelujah all the pike was
[46:39] broken up so the spirit couldn't flow
[46:41] it was trapped by queens and dogmas
[46:43] every time the spirits had to do so it
[46:44] bunks are creed here it can't go
[46:46] it burns out interpretation here it
[46:48] can't go it bonks some man with
[46:50] some contrary life here it can't go but
[46:52] god promised in the last days
[46:54] that all the world will be tied up oh
[46:56] and tied back in the world
[46:57] to bring down the holy ghost and the
[46:59] entire holy ghost visited the church
[47:02] oh glory to god to make manifest luke's
[47:04] emptiness these son of man again
[47:06] come with the original seed to put it in
[47:08] a bride
[47:09] i'm excited tonight because this word
[47:11] gonna come to pass
[47:12] this word can return void oh hallelujah
[47:18] oh glory thank you lord jesus
[47:22] hallelujah don't worry a charge up here
[47:24] oh glory to
[47:25] god hallelujah thank you lord jesus
[47:30] i'm not turning on you page let's turn
[47:32] to the word see what the word promises
[47:34] for today

[47:37] supposed to be
[47:38] what we ought to do this year not go
[47:40] back to chris go back to our old
[47:42] nominations
[47:42] not go back to all denominations but
[47:44] turn to the world to see what kind of
[47:46] light supposed to shine today
[47:48] oh church turn to the word get back to
[47:51] the world
[47:51] flip the right switch which punching
[47:53] around electric lights and artificial
[47:55] man-made lights turn to this world
[47:57] and see the promise of today and then
[47:59] see the promise what the promise is
[48:01] and what's for his identification when
[48:04] it's vindicated you know whether in the
[48:06] light or not

[52:27] prostitute and so forth they will be
[52:29] surprised they won't be surprised
[52:31] they know what's coming to them but
[52:33] what's going to be a surprise is those
[52:35] fellows who
[52:35] think he's right and not when you see
[52:38] your name is not on the book that's when
[52:40] it's going to be hard
[52:41] when you think you are christian when
[52:43] you are not there's a way that seems
[52:46] right you believe intellectually that
[52:48] you are right
[52:49] you have done things you thought was
[52:50] right you have been good
[52:52] you have been kind that isn't it friends
[52:54] i'm trying to say it to the church today
[52:56] instead of while i'm wrong in
[52:58] justification and laying here on the
[53:00] altar the ought to be consecrated the
[53:02] time
[53:03] of miracles is at hand let me prophesy
[53:06] the time of miracles is at hand
[53:09] the time of healing the time of great
[53:12] things
[53:12] is at hand but where is the church to
[53:15] receive it
[53:16] hallelujah and i know that this brother
[53:18] branham prophesying about his own
[53:20] ministry and stuff and doing things and
[53:21] things like but that is also
[53:23] for the bride because the holy spirit
[53:25] already said i'll ride this trail once
[53:26] more there'll be one more ride
[53:28] oh glory to god i feel good tonight
[53:30] there'll be one more
[53:32] ride hallelujah oh brother a real
[53:35] predominating fate walks right in and
[53:37] takes its place right
[53:38] and if your heart isn't tender before
[53:40] the lord that's beautiful
[53:41] if it isn't something in your heart that
[53:44] just satisfied day and night
[53:46] no matter what goes what comes i am now
[53:48] ready to be offered up
[53:50] paul said hallelujah i fought a good
[53:52] fight i
[53:53] finished the course i have kept the fate
[53:55] and there's a crown of righteousness
[53:57] later to me
[53:58] that the lord the righteous judge will
[54:00] give me that that day not me only
[54:02] but for those who love his appearance
[54:04] did you ever think about that
[54:06] love his appearing oh glory to god you
[54:08] must love his appearance i want to see
[54:10] him oh i want to see him look upon his
[54:12] face
[54:12] i want to see him come among us i want
[54:14] to i want to love his appearance i can't
[54:16] wait to see my pee among us
[54:18] in healing and deliverance and casting
[54:20] out devils in revival i want to see his
[54:22] appearance i come in the church an
[54:24] expectation to his appearance
[54:26] oh glory to god is dead and empty to you
[54:28] anymore
[54:29] till they simply can't have any pleasure
[54:31] here nothing but just winning social
[54:33] christ is all you can get pleasure out
[54:34] of
[54:34] did you know a mocking angel was sent
[54:36] forth to seal with the holy ghost to
[54:38] seal only those who sigh and cry
[54:40] for the abominations done in the city
[54:41] ezekiel 9 did you ever read it
[54:44] i want to ask a question how many of
[54:46] your family many of members of your
[54:47] church tonight if that angel passed by
[54:49] and seen those people so consecrated to
[54:50] god
[54:51] that the lost souls was upon the heart
[54:53] day and night not television not movies
[54:55] not full around an idol on facebook and
[54:57] just wasting time
[54:58] and watching kind of coco pictures and
[55:00] fake news like all but the bible talk
[55:02] about in the last days they shall
[55:04] have itchiness they shall move from the
[55:06] truth they wouldn't enjoy
[55:08] song doctrine the age itching them for
[55:10] anything fables
[55:11] it's fake news fake promises people just
[55:15] write all kinds of internet is fake
[55:17] put pictures together fake hallelujah i
[55:19] got fake preachers
[55:20] fake men fake messages fake and god sent
[55:24] something real
[55:25] i don't want to fake nothing that's why
[55:27] i say the same holy ghost peter had that
[55:29] is the one i want
[55:30] same fire they had as you want to want i
[55:32] want a modern one i
[55:34] want a new one i want to explain in one
[55:36] i want the same one with the same
[55:37] emotions
[55:38] same signs same wonder same unction
[55:41] same inspiration oh glory to god
[55:44] hallelujah
[55:45] it's promised to the church oh blessed
[55:48] be name of the lord
[55:49] hallelujah same thing hallelujah
[55:54] now watch now remember we have already
[55:57] seen
[55:58] and are witnessing the appearing of the
[56:02] lord
[56:03] now remember appearing and coming is two
[56:05] different words
[56:07] to appear and then to come
[56:10] no is the appearance he has already
[56:13] appeared in these last days right here
[56:15] with us in the last few years
[56:17] no it's a sign of his coming
[56:20] or appearing is a sign of his coming
[56:23] that's right he's appearing in his
[56:25] church in the form of the holy spirit
[56:27] showing that it's him because people
[56:30] cannot do these things that you see the
[56:33] holy spirit
[56:34] doing oh glory to god no
[56:37] and and you see the holy spirit doing so
[56:39] that the appearance of the lord now
[56:40] remember in
[56:41] it it spoke in both places appearing
[56:44] and coming so if people are prepared in
[56:48] the wrong way
[56:49] what if soldiers went to the field not
[56:51] trained for the battle but to go there
[56:53] to dance
[56:54] though they would ever be good dancers
[56:56] they
[56:57] got to be trained to fight and what if
[56:59] they went and some kind of had a fear
[57:02] and know how not how to use the gun it
[57:04] would do a little good
[57:06] so i think that the workers in the
[57:08] harvest should be prepared to know
[57:11] how to train the people
[57:14] for the coming of the lord for there is
[57:16] none of us that wants to meet it
[57:18] now i believe here we go that we are
[57:20] living so close to the coming
[57:23] that these great miraculous things that
[57:26] we see appearing
[57:27] is the indication of his soon coming
[57:32] let me say it again he was saying i
[57:34] believe
[57:35] that we are living so close to the
[57:36] coming that these great
[57:38] miraculous things that we see appearing
[57:42] is the indication of his soon coming
[57:46] hallelujah oh glory to god so it was my
[57:50] desire
[57:51] to tell you many things happen that i
[57:53] don't speak
[57:55] but this was too outstanding for me to
[57:56] keep it from the church
[57:58] it must be told and before god who i
[58:00] stand is the truth
[58:01] i know that there is a god i know that
[58:03] jesus is the son of god emmanuel
[58:04] dwelling among his people today
[58:06] in the form of the holy spirit and i
[58:07] know that the coming
[58:09] of the lord is drawing nine when
[58:13] signs and wonders are appearing
[58:16] so we could preach to be blue in the
[58:18] face until
[58:19] the signs and the wonders and the
[58:22] miracles appear he's still coming
[58:25] but when those things begin to appear we
[58:27] know it's a sign of his coming
[58:30] and he said signs and wonders identify
[58:32] you are adult in christ
[58:34] that's a whole big thing by itself so we
[58:36] got just got through seven church ages
[58:39] and learning that we are in the last
[58:41] loud eastern age
[58:42] and the church would be indifferent get
[58:44] cold denominate be organized
[58:46] organization would take it over eat it
[58:49] up but a promise that there would be a
[58:51] little remnant left
[58:52] there would be a church watch scattered
[58:56] abroad
[58:56] everywhere but god would guard it
[58:59] together and erupted into glory
[59:01] a little sanctified group somewhere
[59:04] waiting on the lord
[59:05] oh hallelujah praise god hallelujah you
[59:09] love him tonight
[59:11] and here and when we he was on earth
[59:14] there were some greeks one time who came
[59:16] to say sirs we will see jesus
[59:18] and i believe that is the desire of
[59:19] every man and woman that ever heard of
[59:21] jesus want to see him
[59:23] and if he isn't the same we cannot see
[59:25] him but if he's the same we can see him
[59:27] he told oh he told us something wrong
[59:29] the other while the world won't see me
[59:31] no more but he shall see me
[59:32] even for i the personal pronoun i'll be
[59:35] with you
[59:36] even in you to the end of the age and
[59:39] here we go
[59:39] and then jesus promised to be in his
[59:42] church
[59:43] doing the same things he did then until
[59:46] the age end
[59:47] now he said this is important a little
[59:50] while the world see me no more
[59:52] well then how would we see him
[59:57] we have to see
[1:00:00] his spirit if you want to see jesus you
[1:00:03] have to see what
[1:00:05] his spirit if he's in us
[1:00:08] and that spirit would have
[1:00:11] to do the same that he did
[1:00:14] or it wouldn't be the same spirit so to
[1:00:17] see
[1:00:18] him you have to see the same works oh
[1:00:21] could i
[1:00:22] shout all you in the house shelter not
[1:00:24] one
[1:00:25] hallelujah i am the vine the other
[1:00:26] branches if the branch is in the vine
[1:00:28] the branch would be the kind of fruit
[1:00:30] that the vine produces to it
[1:00:32] and if that first branch that come out
[1:00:34] the divine was a pentecostal branch with
[1:00:36] visions powers healings
[1:00:38] baptism of the holy spirit great signs
[1:00:40] and wonders the next branch
[1:00:42] will have to be the same kind of branch
[1:00:43] oh glory to god so there's a big
[1:00:45] difference
[1:00:46] in the sign of jesus appearing and then
[1:00:49] jesus coming
[1:00:50] they are two different words
[1:00:53] mean two different things the appearing
[1:00:57] of the lord
[1:00:58] and the coming of the lord no the
[1:01:00] appearance of the lord is now
[1:01:01] when he's appearing in his people his
[1:01:04] spirit
[1:01:05] working among them proving it is him
[1:01:07] with them getting them ready
[1:01:09] for the rapture there's not no man
[1:01:11] getting it ready is the holy spirit
[1:01:13] is the lord himself descended with a
[1:01:15] shout appeared
[1:01:17] voice appearing trump is coming but the
[1:01:21] lord
[1:01:21] he sent himself oh glory to god he
[1:01:24] appeared in a prophet
[1:01:25] and he's going to appear himself in a
[1:01:26] bride do you believe that
[1:01:29] for to come the lord to catch away the
[1:01:30] bride they appearing and they're coming
[1:01:32] so the lord is now appearing among his
[1:01:34] people great signs
[1:01:36] and wonders raising the dead healing the
[1:01:38] sick
[1:01:39] doing the very same things that he did
[1:01:41] that hasn't been done for 2000 years see
[1:01:43] the
[1:01:43] church is horned through that and
[1:01:47] brought up till at the time the
[1:01:49] headstone
[1:01:50] is coming to meet the church then it all
[1:01:53] go
[1:01:54] together and be raptured this one fell
[1:01:56] asleep until it watched onto the seven
[1:01:58] watch the praying of the lord last night
[1:02:00] i touched it
[1:02:01] now if you can beat all the way you say
[1:02:02] lord god i believe exactly what you
[1:02:04] would say
[1:02:05] i believe that the appearance of the
[1:02:07] lord comes
[1:02:08] listen listen before the coming of the
[1:02:10] lord
[1:02:11] so we're talking about jesus coming the
[1:02:14] lord is coming
[1:02:15] we've reached preaching to the second
[1:02:16] coming of the lord and so on but before
[1:02:18] he comes
[1:02:19] he has to appear hallelujah isn't that
[1:02:22] right
[1:02:23] praise the lord so he said no that's the
[1:02:25] appearance of the lord before the coming
[1:02:27] of the lord
[1:02:27] for it's just two different words
[1:02:29] altogether no
[1:02:31] is the appearing as he promised in the
[1:02:33] last days that he be with us
[1:02:35] oh my hallelujah
[1:02:38] so the light that luther has neither the
[1:02:40] light was given to john wesley john
[1:02:42] wesley preached signification
[1:02:43] that luther passed over the light comes
[1:02:45] as we have need of light
[1:02:47] god says it and it isn't open up to us
[1:02:50] because it has hit to our eyes until the
[1:02:51] day that god is able to reveal it
[1:02:53] and i wonder he'll be after we leave ye
[1:02:56] he say i am persuaded
[1:02:58] glory let me back up that a little bit
[1:03:00] and the light comes
[1:03:02] as we have need of light god says it
[1:03:05] and it isn't open to us because it's hid
[1:03:08] to our eyes
[1:03:10] until the day that god is able to reveal
[1:03:13] it
[1:03:14] and i am persuaded here we go that there
[1:03:16] is
[1:03:17] very very much more that we know nothing
[1:03:20] about
[1:03:21] that is right there are seven seals
[1:03:24] if we just take the complete book of
[1:03:26] revelation that's seen in the back of
[1:03:27] the book
[1:03:28] it isn't even written in the book and
[1:03:30] them seeds are to be opened during this
[1:03:32] church age
[1:03:33] and the seven last mysteries of god will
[1:03:36] be made known
[1:03:38] oh glory i like that seven last not 27
[1:03:40] last
[1:03:41] seven last mysteries to be made known
[1:03:43] are you ready
[1:03:45] as daniel heard the seven thunders and
[1:03:46] forbidden john heard the voices and this
[1:03:49] book was sealed
[1:03:50] and the back of the book was sealed with
[1:03:53] seven seals
[1:03:54] but in the days of these seasons to be
[1:03:55] open the mystery of god
[1:03:57] would be finished in other words god
[1:03:59] would be known to his church
[1:04:01] not in three people but in one person
[1:04:04] the mystery of god would be revealed
[1:04:06] here we go oh god i feel inspired
[1:04:08] tonight and when that was completely
[1:04:10] revealed
[1:04:12] glory to god all the written mysteries
[1:04:14] all the loose ends
[1:04:15] completely revealed then the seven
[1:04:17] mysteries
[1:04:18] would be open to the church because
[1:04:20] indeed
[1:04:21] the church would be living under the
[1:04:24] inspiration of the holy spirit
[1:04:26] him moving in and out and showing his
[1:04:28] signs
[1:04:29] of being alive and among us living among
[1:04:31] us and then
[1:04:32] we are worshiping the living christ
[1:04:35] what is he saying here that would be the
[1:04:37] appearing of the lord
[1:04:39] that's what he said what we see should
[1:04:40] make a church that would make a revival
[1:04:42] that people would fly from everywhere
[1:04:44] and say the seven thunders are not even
[1:04:45] written
[1:04:46] are being made manifest all glory to god
[1:04:49] so then you can't hold back that worship
[1:04:51] then you're worshiping the living oh you
[1:04:52] hold back that when christ is among you
[1:04:55] oh glory to god and you joined the four
[1:04:57] beasts you're joining 24 elders your
[1:04:59] joint thousands time thousands saying
[1:05:00] blessing and honor
[1:05:01] might and power dominion not sit down
[1:05:03] like a morse back church member remember
[1:05:06] sitting on the pew just sitting on the
[1:05:07] pew it cannot be like that
[1:05:09] jesus said oh i come and always woman
[1:05:11] when the true worship was going to
[1:05:12] worship the father
[1:05:13] in spirit and truth for seven ages they
[1:05:16] couldn't do it we have a revelation of
[1:05:17] the truth
[1:05:18] oh and then the spirit has come we can
[1:05:20] correctly worship god
[1:05:22] oh glory to god he is our god he is my
[1:05:24] god he's got to be your god
[1:05:26] god is the object of worship he was lord
[1:05:28] for this kind of worship
[1:05:29] worshiped by revelation god is my rocky
[1:05:33] hallelujah god is my revelation
[1:05:38] i wonder if this word reading again when
[1:05:40] it was completely revealed
[1:05:41] then the seven mysteries would open to
[1:05:43] the church because
[1:05:44] india the church would be living under
[1:05:47] the inspiration of the holy spirit
[1:05:48] him moving in and out and showing his
[1:05:51] signs of
[1:05:52] what what i'll do at 5 00 ministry
[1:05:56] what what what a little bit preacher man
[1:05:57] pastor man why are you with him
[1:05:59] this is number six that paradigm beef
[1:06:02] and paradigm beef what do i do with him
[1:06:04] listen again the church will be living
[1:06:08] under the inspiration of the holy spirit
[1:06:09] not man not sex not nicoletan
[1:06:12] not under message popes or bishops
[1:06:16] the church will be living where under
[1:06:18] the inspiration of the holy spirit
[1:06:20] him move it in and out so he could move
[1:06:22] in tonight
[1:06:24] we are with five almost five six here oh

[1:06:27] where the truth and treats that god he
[1:06:28] could move into the night and heal you
[1:06:29] perform america in your life slam our
[1:06:31] door open that was formally closed
[1:06:33] oh glory to god and then we are
[1:06:35] worshiping the living christ
[1:06:37] him moving among us hallelujah
[1:06:40] then here we go again i know it's only
[1:06:42] repeating ourselves but it's to bring a
[1:06:44] certain emphasis this
[1:06:45] two different words the appearance of
[1:06:46] christ the coming of christ is two
[1:06:48] different words
[1:06:49] now christ is apparently different
[1:06:51] things he said while he's saying this
[1:06:53] that's why i'm bringing it back and
[1:06:54] christ is appearing his last days in his
[1:06:57] church
[1:06:57] bringing his church together in unity
[1:07:01] and faith and power in the word
[1:07:05] altogether
[1:07:06] that when he returns he would
[1:07:09] find the same church what the cancun
[1:07:12] left the caterpillar
[1:07:14] eaten that the caterpillar the look was
[1:07:15] eaten and i will restore he'll find back
[1:07:18] that same church
[1:07:19] oh glory to god that's why that's why
[1:07:21] when elohim came down even melchizedek
[1:07:24] and appeared to abraham i will return
[1:07:26] today according to the time of life was
[1:07:28] to bring a special consolation for a man
[1:07:30] who wait 25 years to tell him are coming
[1:07:32] to come again
[1:07:33] oh glory to god are coming appearing to
[1:07:35] you to come again but how are coming now

[1:08:30] lights the coming the holy spirit coming
[1:08:32] in so strong
[1:08:34] in upon his church till till the
[1:08:37] ministry of jesus christ is knowing
[1:08:40] among the people
[1:08:41] and that's why he said the ministry has
[1:08:43] reached its perfection
[1:08:45] when christ is reproduced again in
[1:08:48] natural let me say that again the
[1:08:51] ministry
[1:08:52] has reached its perfection not because
[1:08:55] of
[1:08:55] lord of ministry are mysteries a man
[1:08:57] could preach but when
[1:08:59] christ is reproduced in the natural
[1:09:02] hallelujah he said we see even lights
[1:09:06] coming
[1:09:06] and the holy spirit coming in so strong
[1:09:09] upon his people
[1:09:10] till the ministry of jesus christ is
[1:09:12] knowing among the people
[1:09:13] they sat there with fate bringing him
[1:09:15] down
[1:09:16] powers and gifts working among them
[1:09:19] speaking with tongues
[1:09:20] interpretation of tongues and signs and
[1:09:23] wonders
[1:09:24] and miracles what is it christ among his
[1:09:27] church
[1:09:27] getting ready to take her oh hallelujah
[1:09:32] oh glory to god notice this is a big one
[1:09:34] the end time messenger his job will be
[1:09:36] to get the scenes ready
[1:09:37] the bride ready for the break room isn't
[1:09:39] that right that will be his message
[1:09:41] how you want to learn abc when you and
[1:09:43] you can study algebra later
[1:09:45] when these other seals in the back is
[1:09:47] open they'll be only revealed to them
[1:09:50] who do what learn the abcs now watch
[1:09:52] something
[1:09:53] bring back the church to the word now
[1:09:55] what is this
[1:09:56] messenger of malachi for to do
[1:09:59] are you ready church believers out there
[1:10:02] are you ready to hear it
[1:10:03] what is this messenger of malachi fought
[1:10:05] to do
[1:10:06] restore back the original faith
[1:10:10] and then he he quantified the
[1:10:12] resurrection faith
[1:10:14] that they seen jesus after he was raised
[1:10:17] from the dead
[1:10:18] seeing him working among them that's his
[1:10:21] resurrection fate
[1:10:23] after buddha man i'm gone after sonoma
[1:10:26] no longer identify himself because the
[1:10:28] bodies that holding that son of man gone
[1:10:29] you have to see jesus
[1:10:31] back among the bride working among them
[1:10:34] working among us and that he identified
[1:10:37] that
[1:10:38] as resurrection faith because not the
[1:10:41] same fate it had when
[1:10:42] jesus was walking with them this is
[1:10:44] jesus racially dead now
[1:10:46] hallelujah appearing among them saying
[1:10:49] peace be unto you
[1:10:50] oh as my father sent me so son are you
[1:10:52] oh glory to god that's a different kind
[1:10:54] of faith now
[1:10:55] that is resurrection faith now oh
[1:10:57] hallelujah you mean that had to be among
[1:10:59] the bride
[1:11:00] before the rapture yes before it's
[1:11:02] coming
[1:11:03] yes you mean all is you have to be
[1:11:05] identified yes
[1:11:08] so what are you supposed to be written
[1:11:09] for my lord jesus
[1:11:12] let me continue here god is in man and
[1:11:15] he's identifying himself today in his
[1:11:17] church
[1:11:17] in the born-again christian god identify
[1:11:20] himself that he remains god
[1:11:22] and the outside world will only know god
[1:11:25] as they see god and you and i that's the
[1:11:28] only way they will know god
[1:11:29] is when we are written epistles epistle
[1:11:32] of the scripture
[1:11:33] we are rid of all men and the life that
[1:11:36] we live
[1:11:36] reflects what's on the inside of us a
[1:11:39] man is identified by the works that he
[1:11:41] does
[1:11:42] so our work should be good always
[1:11:45] because we are representing
[1:11:46] our lord jesus oh hallelujah and the
[1:11:49] scripture is god's symphony
[1:11:51] only the composer knows what it really
[1:11:53] means hallelujah and the composers is
[1:11:55] getting the spirit and they
[1:11:56] write the script and act that musician
[1:11:58] giving us here hallelujah all them
[1:12:00] little
[1:12:01] quavers and semiquavers anybody who's a
[1:12:04] musician any part of the world i could
[1:12:06] read music
[1:12:06] reading the same thing oh glory to god
[1:12:08] they can't interpret this thing
[1:12:09] different
[1:12:10] no it says so it says so ping-pong how
[1:12:12] hard to do it or where to stretch it
[1:12:14] where to put it where to fling it and
[1:12:16] what
[1:12:16] they know all about that hallelujah
[1:12:18] because they
[1:12:19] understand to read the sheet music i
[1:12:22] have the ministers carry the music
[1:12:24] you know what men they play in a wrong
[1:12:25] tune they play in their own tune
[1:12:27] so the scripture is called symphony
[1:12:30] isn't that right only the composer knows
[1:12:32] what it really means
[1:12:32] he reveals it to those who are listening
[1:12:35] who are interested in knowing what the
[1:12:37] drama is
[1:12:38] you have to have to know about the
[1:12:39] symphony first the changing
[1:12:41] the junctions of the world or the music
[1:12:44] sometimes it's going this way for a
[1:12:45] while a certain beat after while it
[1:12:47] changes around what is it
[1:12:48] to you who wouldn't understand it or
[1:12:50] know nothing about it not interested in
[1:12:52] it it's racket it's a fuss
[1:12:54] but to those who know about it they're
[1:12:55] watching for it they
[1:12:57] know it is coming so we have these times
[1:12:59] of symphonies
[1:13:00] of god's word that the whole drama
[1:13:02] changes
[1:13:04] you who are interested listen for that
[1:13:06] change you know it's getting close
[1:13:08] you hear the way the drums are beaten
[1:13:09] hallelujah you know something going to
[1:13:11] change
[1:13:12] something's going to burst out in a few
[1:13:13] minutes you are watching for it you can
[1:13:15] tell the way the drums are timing oh god
[1:13:17] if you can
[1:13:18] hear the drums of the finish now you can
[1:13:20] hear the echo of the music
[1:13:21] of the heavenly word singing it out
[1:13:24] hallelujah
[1:13:25] the composer and those who are
[1:13:26] interested listen for the change
[1:13:28] that's what all this stuff is to us we
[1:13:30] are listening we are watching
[1:13:32] every time he appears something happens
[1:13:34] we see the time getting close
[1:13:36] we see back here not long ago when the
[1:13:37] churches were being drawn
[1:13:39] we were listening we've seen it was
[1:13:41] right with the word
[1:13:42] and it was vindicated we hear in the
[1:13:44] days of the seventh angel
[1:13:46] hallelujah we find out in revelation 10
[1:13:48] in the days of the message
[1:13:49] of the seven angels the mystery of god
[1:13:51] shall be finished the seventh seal will
[1:13:53] be pulled back
[1:13:54] it should be there then all at once what
[1:13:56] happened a vision broke
[1:13:58] go to tucson great noise taking place
[1:14:00] hallelujah i'll shake up the earth
[1:14:02] then appeared in the sky shalom what is
[1:14:04] it a changing of beat
[1:14:05] it's a symphony remember the composer
[1:14:08] knows the end from the beginning
[1:14:09] he knows all about it and that's the
[1:14:11] reason you could write it now you must
[1:14:13] begin with him
[1:14:14] you must begin with him if you want to
[1:14:17] hear the symphony you begin with him
[1:14:19] like the music of the symphony you
[1:14:21] listen you know what it says
[1:14:22] it's going to be what the symphony is
[1:14:26] so if we preach our own interpretation
[1:14:28] and idea the people will never clue when
[1:14:29] they would begin the manifest
[1:14:31] you could find that force that off
[1:14:32] because that person that would be he not
[1:14:34] in the group
[1:14:34] he's nothing in his association he's not
[1:14:36] in this you know and that's what jesus
[1:14:38] that's
[1:14:38] all that's how describing fascists get
[1:14:39] blown out because they had their own
[1:14:42] interpretation of the scrolls
[1:14:44] and when the school itself come
[1:14:46] hallelujah which is jesus
[1:14:48] which are the scroll made flesh he was
[1:14:50] the odd man he was the admiral
[1:14:52] and he they expect messiah to come to
[1:14:54] them hallelujah
[1:14:56] and messiah was coming according to
[1:14:57] scripture
[1:14:59] and that same messiah promises over here
[1:15:01] will come according to scripture
[1:15:02] not according to no man's interpretation
[1:15:04] because god is suffering and he's a
[1:15:06] result and he's a revealer of the word
[1:15:07] itself
[1:15:08] so a man can't give you revelation and
[1:15:10] take the holy ghost to give revelation
[1:15:12] that why the devil is fight getting his
[1:15:13] spirit oh glory to god
[1:15:15] even in your house you have to be in
[1:15:16] your spirit you can't sit down like a
[1:15:18] lull off
[1:15:19] no no no you're better being your spirit
[1:15:20] inside your house i look how many
[1:15:22] spirits behind here
[1:15:23] i come here so i like to be in the
[1:15:24] spirit of minister to you minister
[1:15:26] angel's dropping here to give an
[1:15:28] option to minister to you inside the
[1:15:30] deal oh glory to god you can't sit down
[1:15:32] like a log
[1:15:33] like praise god you just take it then so
[1:15:35] it's not sure get in the spirit
[1:15:37] and if you get in the spirit god will
[1:15:38] reveal it to you like how god revealed
[1:15:40] it to me
[1:15:41] oh glory to god hallelujah no so anybody
[1:15:44] else that don't know nothing about what
[1:15:45] they're talking about they sit down it's
[1:15:47] just a bunch of nonsense rattling noise
[1:15:48] but the ones who know what it is it
[1:15:50] beats up with the music
[1:15:53] it's trumpets with the trumpets it is
[1:15:55] strong enough
[1:15:56] it is played with the violin it is beat
[1:15:58] on the bass
[1:15:59] it is strongly where the trumpet is
[1:16:01] beating the drums the whole thing is a
[1:16:02] rhythm
[1:16:03] and it makes the drama until they could
[1:16:05] close their eyes and live in it a man
[1:16:07] could close his eyes
[1:16:08] to earthly sight and live in the
[1:16:10] presence of jesus christ
[1:16:11] and you see his word being beat out in
[1:16:13] the great symphony
[1:16:14] that we are living in now you must begin
[1:16:17] with the symphony
[1:16:18] and the only thing you could do you you
[1:16:20] were in the symphony when you start you
[1:16:21] begin to get into rhythm
[1:16:23] i like that harlem you can't be out of
[1:16:25] timing you have to get in the rhythm of
[1:16:27] the thing
[1:16:28] oh you have to get any channel of the
[1:16:29] thing hallelujah
[1:16:31] and you don't stand there and look at it
[1:16:33] you're getting the rhythm of it
[1:16:34] how do you get there you are born into
[1:16:36] it it's the rhythm of the word
[1:16:39] and you become part of the word if you
[1:16:40] have to become in the path of a dance
[1:16:42] you have to get out there and dance
[1:16:43] you have to become the part of the ball
[1:16:45] game you're interested in you can talk
[1:16:46] to any bald game you have to become part
[1:16:48] of the word
[1:16:49] and the word know what the sympathy is
[1:16:51] it's plain for you to understand you're
[1:16:53] matching with the beat of time
[1:16:55] you are watching for it oh my
[1:16:58] hallelujah the works that i do shall do
[1:17:00] also oh praise god
[1:17:02] now they had the sheet in their hand but
[1:17:03] what did they do they take a portion
[1:17:05] that already played out
[1:17:06] back there so god controlling this
[1:17:08] infinity right paul
[1:17:09] martin lumber luther wesley and he
[1:17:11] played and they play in the symphony
[1:17:14] and then beats them gone already no it's
[1:17:16] over tuned
[1:17:17] ghost in a prophet isn't that right
[1:17:18] malachi 4
[1:17:20] he already played on his part and he
[1:17:22] prophesied about a bride
[1:17:24] he said i see a bride called she's
[1:17:26] sealed to the kingdom of god
[1:17:28] the dynamics of this church will be
[1:17:29] receiving of the holy ghost
[1:17:31] what we see manifested temporarily will
[1:17:33] be manifested in his fullness when the
[1:17:35] press come down he see prophesying about
[1:17:36] this bride i wish i could lift to see it
[1:17:38] oh lord
[1:17:39] hallelujah when a man walked on the road
[1:17:41] and said silvan gold have like none
[1:17:43] such as have i given unto you we have to
[1:17:46] get into rhythm
[1:17:47] march into the symphony of the word i'm
[1:17:50] finishing now
[1:18:00] many people ask why they ask sometimes
[1:18:03] why why why must these things happen
[1:18:06] why did this happen to me why did i
[1:18:09] start and this happened
[1:18:11] i had this trouble here this upset me
[1:18:13] here
[1:18:14] i lost this here sometimes i've asked
[1:18:16] why why when i was a young minister for
[1:18:18] started out
[1:18:19] did god take my wife right out from
[1:18:21] under me take my baby right from beneath
[1:18:23] me
[1:18:24] right beneath my heart why did he do
[1:18:26] that i didn't know
[1:18:28] i do know i just held my hand
[1:18:32] and kept trusting he knows every
[1:18:35] junction
[1:18:36] he knows the rhythm when it must take
[1:18:39] place
[1:18:40] he knows what it takes to mold you
[1:18:43] he knows what kind of material he's
[1:18:44] going to use
[1:18:46] hallelujah the back side of the desert
[1:18:49] where god molds righteous men to sages
[1:18:52] and prophets
[1:18:53] that's where men are beat out men are
[1:18:55] beat out in the world
[1:18:57] when they got all kind of creed and
[1:18:58] stuff in them let them go come to the
[1:19:00] word of god and
[1:19:01] beat it right out of them and mose them
[1:19:03] i don't know how it goes
[1:19:05] but he knows he knows how it goes i
[1:19:08] don't
[1:19:08] but i look at here and say well it's
[1:19:10] just coming many of the afflictions are
[1:19:12] righteous
[1:19:13] but god delivered them out of them all
[1:19:16] god has moved to history
[1:19:18] with the rhythm of the promise of his
[1:19:20] word in each age
[1:19:22] in the same rhythm making his word
[1:19:24] that's how god moved through history
[1:19:26] and all the way from genesis to
[1:19:28] revelation he has moved to history with
[1:19:29] his word
[1:19:30] that's right with the rhythm of the
[1:19:32] power of the holy spirit
[1:19:34] vindicating his word to the elected
[1:19:36] remember he has
[1:19:37] never been able to touch the outside
[1:19:39] church it is only the elected
[1:19:42] as i close
[1:19:45] he permit him permit crossroads
[1:19:48] he may permit crossroads to try us to
[1:19:51] perfect us for his service
[1:19:54] he remember but permit you that now
[1:19:56] church both here and on tape
[1:19:58] he may permit crossroads for our service
[1:20:01] like he did daniel
[1:20:02] daniel lacrosse crush one day you know
[1:20:04] he's a great man
[1:20:05] and he let the king turn against him and
[1:20:06] truman alliance them it only perfected
[1:20:09] him sure did
[1:20:10] hebrew boys fiery furnace he may permit
[1:20:13] crossroads let them laugh at you for
[1:20:14] having long hair let them laugh at you
[1:20:16] for saying
[1:20:17] why you become a holy ruler whatever
[1:20:18] more let them laugh that's a crossroad
[1:20:21] a little junction and sometimes it takes
[1:20:24] hard trials
[1:20:25] to break the bands of the world off of
[1:20:27] us
[1:20:28] let me repeat that to all of you out
[1:20:30] there and that's for me too
[1:20:32] sometimes it takes hard trials to break
[1:20:35] the
[1:20:35] bands of the world off of us sometimes
[1:20:38] god let us have a little trial you know
[1:20:40] to see what we will do
[1:20:42] to take you out of the world other words
[1:20:44] let you have a little trial and
[1:20:46] knock you out of the organization and
[1:20:48] that idea that methodist is the only one
[1:20:50] the baptist the pentecostal
[1:20:51] that's the only group how much people do
[1:20:53] they believe that they're the only group
[1:20:55] any group of rapture
[1:20:56] and those are lies just sit and tell
[1:20:58] them that
[1:20:59] and if a man turned out to satan be any
[1:21:01] man talking about nonsense
[1:21:03] it'd have to be in christ has to be
[1:21:05] according to the word
[1:21:07] hallelujah praise god the only group
[1:21:09] they got
[1:21:10] and if you don't believe it like my
[1:21:12] church believe it you don't believe it
[1:21:14] at all
[1:21:14] sometimes he'll let all them trials
[1:21:16] happen maybe you got a sick baby
[1:21:18] maybe something takes place right at the
[1:21:20] end of death maybe someone taking from
[1:21:22] you
[1:21:23] what's it to do to break you away to
[1:21:26] show you something
[1:21:27] open your eyes maybe you come to
[1:21:29] criticize sometimes maybe you'll listen
[1:21:31] to this tape and just to criticize
[1:21:33] maybe god is doing that to break down
[1:21:35] some worldly band that got you bombed on
[1:21:37] like a drunken man in a river you have
[1:21:38] to take the man out of the river before
[1:21:40] you can get the revolt of the man
[1:21:42] you have to get him out of the river
[1:21:43] first then you get the river out of him
[1:21:45] sometimes god has to do it and that way
[1:21:47] he permits junctions and crossroads
[1:21:50] and stand on his promises and the world
[1:21:51] will never fail
[1:21:53] abraham was at his crossroads he knew
[1:21:55] that god could raise up his son from the
[1:21:57] dead
[1:21:58] and when he received him at the
[1:21:59] crossroads abraham come to his crossword
[1:22:00] and after he trusted god had seen all
[1:22:03] the miracles of god
[1:22:03] 25 years he waited for this boy a
[1:22:05] promised son and go tell him off him up
[1:22:07] and we know what happened
[1:22:09] and this last quote you did well
[1:22:13] a great audience hallelujah
[1:22:16] this is the final quote moses being
[1:22:18] bought with that great gift of faith
[1:22:19] moses born
[1:22:20] gift of faith he was anointed with
[1:22:22] commissioner of the burning bush
[1:22:24] to deliver god's people now sees what
[1:22:27] the great qualities this man had
[1:22:29] he was born for a certain thing god had
[1:22:31] a purpose in it
[1:22:32] god has got a purpose of you being here
[1:22:34] if you can only
[1:22:35] get to that place use how much trouble
[1:22:37] you're safe guarding yourself to
[1:22:40] moses born and then he afterwards he
[1:22:43] he brought the place where he was
[1:22:44] anointed notice the sea leaning there
[1:22:46] with an intellectual conception with all
[1:22:49] the faith he was born with deliver the
[1:22:50] people yet it never come to life
[1:22:53] until the light from that burning bush
[1:22:57] flashed across it until you see not
[1:23:00] something you read about
[1:23:01] but something is seen with his eyes
[1:23:04] something that spoke to him and he spoke
[1:23:06] back to it
[1:23:07] and i think that any man woman boy or
[1:23:09] girl
[1:23:10] in an intellectual conception of what
[1:23:12] they think the word is
[1:23:14] can never have a full foundation stand
[1:23:18] until they met that light that brings
[1:23:20] that word
[1:23:21] to reality i think no church in its
[1:23:24] practice
[1:23:25] no matter how intellectual and
[1:23:26] fundamental it might be that church
[1:23:28] cannot strive
[1:23:29] until the supernatural is made known
[1:23:32] among the people
[1:23:34] and they see it something they can talk
[1:23:36] to i will talk back to them
[1:23:38] that vinnicate has written a word oh
[1:23:40] let's wherever you are in your home just
[1:23:42] stand
[1:23:43] let's stand and give god some praise
