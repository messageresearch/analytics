[16:30] and ephesians chapter one
[16:33] two portion scriptures this morning
[16:37] we would read ephesians
[16:40] first
[16:41] just verse 3-5
[16:43] and also return to switch to
[16:47] romans 9.
[16:52] for his tree of ephesians blessed be the
[16:54] god and father of our lord jesus christ
[16:55] who had blessed us
[16:57] with all
[16:59] spiritual blessings and heavenly places
[17:01] in christ ephesians 1 verse 3.
[17:04] according
[17:06] as he had chosen us in him
[17:09] when
[17:10] before the foundation of the world
[17:12] that we should be holy
[17:14] and without blame
[17:16] before him in love verse 5 having
[17:19] predestinated us unto the adoption of
[17:22] children by jesus christ
[17:24] to himself
[17:26] according
[17:28] to the good pleasure
[17:30] of his will
[17:32] romans chapter 9 i want to read from
[17:34] verse 6
[17:36] we read
[17:38] not as though the word of god had not
[17:39] have known effect for thee
[17:41] are not all israel which are of israel
[17:45] neither because they are the seed of
[17:47] abraham are they all children
[17:50] but in isaac shall i see be called
[17:54] that is they which are the children of
[17:56] the flesh these are not the children of
[17:59] god but the children
[18:01] of the promise
[18:03] accounted for the seed
[18:06] for this
[18:07] is the word of promise
[18:09] at this time will i come
[18:11] and say i shall have a son and not only
[18:14] this but when rebecca also had conceived
[18:16] by one even by her father isaac
[18:19] for the children being not yet born
[18:23] neither having done any good or evil
[18:26] that the purpose of god
[18:29] according to election might stand
[18:32] not of works
[18:34] but of him that call it
[18:35] it was said unto her the elder
[18:38] shall save the younger
[18:40] that is written jacob have i loved but
[18:43] esau have i hated let's pray father we
[18:46] thank you for your word and any man
[18:48] could read the word but to take the
[18:50] spirit to come and bring light
[18:52] and life to it father may your word
[18:54] truly be a lamp onto our feet and a
[18:56] light to our parts that we can
[18:58] see where to put our feet this morning
[19:00] our feet of faith
[19:01] father anoint your people anoint those
[19:04] everyone within our gates
[19:06] that they may have ears to hear your
[19:08] word
[19:09] your truth and be transformed by the
[19:11] very word itself
[19:13] come down in our midst and confirm the
[19:14] word with signs and wonders and miracles
[19:17] transform lives homes and families and
[19:20] we'll be careful to give her the
[19:21] underglory we ask in jesus name amen you
[19:25] may be seated
[19:40] well praise the lord
[19:42] blessed be the name of the lord i have a
[19:44] title this morning
[19:46] nothing can defeat
[19:48] the purpose of god
[19:50] according to election
[19:52] that's my title this morning nothing can
[19:54] defeat the purpose of god
[19:57] according to election
[19:59] i have a subject fate
[20:01] in the finished work
[20:03] and i have an inspiration from
[20:04] ecclesiastes chapter 3 1 to everything
[20:07] is a season and a time to every purpose
[20:09] under the heaven so i took inspiration
[20:10] from there there is a season
[20:12] and a time
[20:14] to every purpose
[20:16] there's a season and time
[20:18] to every purpose nothing can defeat the
[20:20] purpose of god
[20:22] is not right
[20:24] the bible tells us that the children not
[20:26] yet born neither haven't done any good
[20:28] or evil that the purpose of god
[20:31] according to election might stand not of
[20:34] works
[20:35] but of him
[20:36] that call it
[20:38] verse 18 therefore you have mercy on
[20:41] whom he will have mercy and whom he
[20:42] hardened he will harden it isn't that
[20:44] right verse 17 for the scripture say
[20:47] unto pharaoh even for this same purpose
[20:49] have i raised thee up that i might show
[20:51] my power indeed that my name might be
[20:54] declared throughout all the earth
[20:57] oh hallelujah raised up for a purpose
[21:01] hallelujah praise god do you believe
[21:03] that
[21:04] matthew 24 21 and then there shall be
[21:06] great tribulation and such was not since
[21:08] the beginning of the world to this time
[21:10] no ever shall be and accept those days
[21:12] shall be shortened there shall be no
[21:14] flesh be saved but for the elect sake
[21:19] those days shall be shortened
[21:21] so there is an elect on the earth
[21:24] in case you didn't know
[21:26] you're gonna know this morning
[21:28] there's an elect on the earth she is
[21:30] chosen in him
[21:32] not now since before the foundation of
[21:34] the world and all that dwell on the
[21:37] earth going to worship the beast except
[21:40] those whose names are written in the
[21:43] lamb's book of life before the
[21:45] foundation of the world so they got the
[21:47] common unfolding of the book to reveal
[21:50] to you that your name is on that book
[21:53] and when you see your name you cannot be
[21:56] the same
[21:57] when you know
[21:58] you are one in a million when you know
[22:00] millions were lost when you were called
[22:03] and you were called to his honor and his
[22:05] glory what he purposed in himself not
[22:08] what you choose but he chose you
[22:11] in himself and predestinated
[22:14] or predetermined that you'll be adopted
[22:18] not of your works not of your past not
[22:21] of your sins not of your failures but
[22:23] that election might stand and when god
[22:27] elect the people before the foundation
[22:29] of the world there is no devil could
[22:31] defeat the purpose that god raised you
[22:34] up for you are being raised up for a
[22:37] divine purpose and i want to tell you
[22:39] this morning
[22:40] nothing will stop it not your past not
[22:43] your sins not your failures not your
[22:46] problems not your condition not what
[22:49] family you come from
[22:51] nothing will defeat
[22:53] the purpose of god
[22:55] according to election
[22:57] give the lord a shout people
[23:00] i don't care if you're tired and you're
[23:01] half dead this morning nothing on the

[26:40] when he said name he's talking about
[26:41] thought attribute
[26:45] in other words nobody could be your
[26:46] thought
[26:48] therefore nobody could be your word
[26:51] and the word is a thought express
[26:53] so god was thinking about you in the
[26:56] back part of his mind before the
[26:57] foundation of the world and when he
[26:59] spoke the word he expressed you
[27:03] in the word
[27:06] so when you come to church you come to
[27:08] hear about your expression because you
[27:10] come to hear the word of what not what
[27:12] you are but what you are going to become
[27:15] because that is what the devil is afraid
[27:17] of the devil is not afraid of what you
[27:19] are the devil's afraid of what you are
[27:22] about to become
[27:28] you will be seated
[27:30] because the whole creation is groaning
[27:32] and travailing
[27:34] for the manifestation
[27:36] of the sons of god
[27:38] because the creation once had a ruler
[27:40] his name was adam the creation once had
[27:42] a god on the earth adam was a god on the
[27:45] earth ruled by a master the creation was
[27:48] but when man fell creation just let go
[27:51] but creation is waiting for the masters
[27:53] of the earth to step forward once again
[27:57] because god in the beginning
[27:59] let us make man
[28:01] oh in our image
[28:02] after our likeness and let that man have
[28:05] dominion
[28:07] oh glory to god could we give the lord
[28:09] some praises
[28:11] that's the kind of man that god made a
[28:14] man in authority
[28:15] a man in position
[28:17] a man with power
[28:18] a man having dominion over
[28:21] that's the kind of man that god
[28:28] made hallelujah
[28:31] my lord
[28:33] what does the thought express
[28:35] and when god once thought
[28:37] of how we make the plan of redemption
[28:40] how do we redeem man by foreknowledge
[28:42] knowing that someone desired and some
[28:44] would be redeemed
[28:46] he thought of the plan or when he spoke
[28:48] the word listen it was already a
[28:51] finished work in heaven
[28:53] when god spoke it
[28:58] your deliverance finish
[29:00] your victory finish
[29:02] your healing finish
[29:03] that's what the brother said by your
[29:04] stripe i was healed
[29:06] not will be was healed because it's
[29:09] already done
[29:13] hallelujah
[29:15] are you with me
[29:17] lord fine among christian american
[29:19] christians he said now is a fear it
[29:22] seems to be afraid that god won't keep
[29:24] his word
[29:25] it's nothing that you can do in the
[29:26] beginning
[29:27] it's what god has done
[29:29] you never sought god though you thought
[29:32] you did but the bible claims you didn't
[29:34] no man seeks god this nature from the
[29:37] gardener eden proves he's a coward and
[29:40] runs when he sins
[29:41] it wasn't adam calling god it was god
[29:44] calling adam and the bible says that
[29:46] your name was written on the book of
[29:49] life
[29:50] isn't that right before the foundation
[29:52] of the world the bible said that the the
[29:55] devil deceived all that dwell on the
[29:57] earth except those who names are not
[29:59] written deceive the popes the presidents
[30:01] the kings the potentials deceive the
[30:03] professors and the colleges the teachers
[30:06] lawyers doctors deceive all
[30:08] so if your name is in the book you could
[30:11] be
[30:11] mad i'm scraggly
[30:14] you could be madame same clothes every
[30:16] sunday same clothes every day washing
[30:19] the same clothes your name on that book
[30:21] you better shout
[30:23] you better rejoice
[30:24] you could have no money in your pocket
[30:26] that has nothing to do
[30:32] oh hallelujah
[30:34] everything of god is a finished work
[30:37] healing
[30:38] salvation
[30:40] it's done finish
[30:41] the only thing is our personal fate
[30:44] in that finished work
[30:46] it's our personal fate and we draw we we
[30:50] draw the renumerations we draw the
[30:52] reward we draw the compensation of his
[30:55] death at calvary for his personal faith
[30:58] what he died for
[30:59] isn't that right
[31:01] and every redemptive blessing belongs to
[31:02] you and i the only thing is the
[31:04] appropriate faith to receive it if not
[31:07] he was wounded for our transgression he
[31:09] was bruised our iniquity let's just type
[31:11] in our pieces upon him and with his
[31:13] stripe we were healed
[31:16] it's all past tense it's a finnish word
[31:19] it is something we just looked at
[31:20] calvary where the supreme sacrifice was
[31:23] made therefore oh hallelujah we have
[31:26] faith in this finished work nothing that
[31:28] i could do nothing that someone else can
[31:31] do is what god has done and we believe
[31:34] he has done therefore we take from the
[31:37] word and based upon it upon our finished
[31:39] work oh blessed be the name of the lord
[31:42] that's why i go on record and say the
[31:44] right mental attitude towards any divine
[31:47] promises of god will bring it to pass i
[31:49] don't care what it is if you have the
[31:51] right attitude which is to believe it
[31:54] that's just all you've got to do believe
[31:56] as though it is
[31:58] go glory to god
[32:01] excuse me
[32:05] look at the woman caught in a very
[32:06] accurate luxury
[32:08] they caught her
[32:09] they have the video now they have the
[32:11] evidence they
[32:13] there's a fresh act
[32:14] she's brought in the friends of jesus
[32:16] all of them have their stones like on my
[32:18] webpage on my facebook page there's a
[32:20] quote uh forgiveness is a good idea
[32:23] until you have something to forgive
[32:25] and somebody have rocks look at the belt
[32:27] everybody is a good idea but when you
[32:29] are challenged to forgive that is why
[32:30] you have a problem you have a serious
[32:33] problem forgiveness is a nice topic to
[32:35] talk about it's it's sweet to talk about
[32:37] forgive your brother forgive your sister
[32:39] until you have something to forgive that
[32:41] it doesn't feel so sweet anymore but
[32:43] this one was caught in very active
[32:45] adultery that all the stones according
[32:47] to the written word that the law that
[32:49] the stones and they call jesus jesus
[32:51] here we go
[32:52] here we go moses said so moses said so
[32:56] we have a quote for this we have a quote
[32:58] for that we have a quote for this we
[33:00] have a quote for that and he was a
[33:01] living quote
[33:04] he was the quota himself he was the
[33:06] living word
[33:07] and they have all the quotes written
[33:09] right there
[33:10] just said no big thing which one of you
[33:12] without sin cast the first stone let her
[33:14] have it
[33:18] let her have it
[33:20] and jesus turn this back to them right
[33:21] on the ground give him a chance to ease
[33:23] out
[33:25] scratch the head and ease out
[33:27] one by one the easing out some remember
[33:29] they have a bill to pay some remember
[33:31] the light might get cut some remember
[33:32] they have this to do and that to do and
[33:34] have this function to go to and jesus
[33:36] wait until everybody left
[33:40] he didn't want to embarrass them you got
[33:42] to tell them about all their life who
[33:43] they was with where they stole what they
[33:45] did he gotta tell every one of them
[33:47] hypocrites standing there with big stone
[33:49] to stone a woman
[33:52] because they were so self-righteous
[33:55] and jesus turned to woman he said woman
[33:59] case is called
[34:01] caught in session woman come forward
[34:04] where then accuse us
[34:06] woman didn't self see when they left
[34:09] she looked around she said there is
[34:10] nothing
[34:11] he said this case can't continue
[34:14] we must have witnesses we must have
[34:15] evidence we must have accusers they have
[34:17] no accusers neither do i condemn thee go
[34:22] and sin
[34:23] no more
[34:25] and who the son of man come on now set
[34:27] free
[34:29] is free
[34:31] indeed
[34:32] give the lord a shout
[34:35] if you are free this morning
[34:37] give the lord a shout
[34:40] who the son of man
[34:42] set free
[34:44] is free indeed
[34:46] oh hallelujah
[34:51] oh hello hallelujah
[34:53] praise god say if you ever well in one
[34:56] hill i never cropped burning on an
[34:58] exhale you could stand in boil water
[35:00] water come over here water water come
[35:02] over here the water will not listen to
[35:04] you you have to work with the law of
[35:06] gravitation and the law of gravitation
[35:08] can't fail so you have to work in the
[35:10] law to get the water to your burning
[35:12] crops isn't that right
[35:14] therefore therefore if you can't just
[35:17] say unless you light up the room light
[35:18] of the room you've got to work according
[35:20] to the laws of election city then it
[35:22] will light up to the room isn't that
[35:24] right but therefore just that way god
[35:27] doesn't heal people by going to church
[35:29] or making the confession he heals you on
[35:32] your faith in his finished work
[35:35] that is the condition in which he's
[35:36] healed you not because you're in the
[35:38] church you could raise up this morning
[35:41] walk on a hole
[35:43] healed
[35:45] in your body
[35:46] in your spirit
[35:48] and in your soul
[35:50] some people not only sick in the body
[35:52] the second spirit
[35:54] that's why i like the world would you
[35:56] remain whole
[35:58] oh i love that will you be made whole
[36:02] it means wholesome
[36:04] right thinking coming into divine order
[36:08] will you remain whole
[36:10] you want to walk up here out here
[36:12] thinking right
[36:13] walking right feeling right
[36:16] not feeling miserable not feeling like
[36:19] you have crack on your mental but being
[36:22] made whole
[36:24] oh glory to god hallelujah
[36:28] oh get the lord some precious people
[36:32] oh hallelujah
[36:34] glory to god
[36:36] no watch
[36:38] no man can come to me except my father
[36:39] draw him
[36:40] all that the father hat
[36:43] past tense
[36:45] given me
[36:46] welcome
[36:47] that's a guarantee all of the father had
[36:50] given me
[36:51] will come
[36:52] so you understand what jesus did he
[36:54] walked with peter come
[36:57] andrew will come
[36:58] because they were given to him
[37:00] so he wasn't making any mistake he
[37:02] wasn't casting a fish in it and hoping
[37:04] they come he said come follow me and
[37:07] something in them register
[37:08] the attribute inside of them connected
[37:11] to the word
[37:12] the attribute inside of them connected
[37:14] to the living word jesus had the names
[37:17] he was the book itself
[37:20] so when we begin to call their names
[37:22] they have to respond
[37:24] therefore if you hear your name
[37:27] this morning
[37:28] you've got to respond you cannot hear
[37:31] your name
[37:32] and there is no response
[37:34] come on same and somebody the goddess
[37:36] that deep deep calling there's got to be
[37:39] a deep
[37:40] to respond
[37:41] to that call
[37:43] oh hallelujah
[37:46] you understand now
[37:48] why jesus could say no man
[37:51] can come to me
[37:52] except
[37:54] the father draw him
[37:56] therefore you can come if you want to
[37:58] it's not him that will it or him that
[38:00] run it but a god that showed mercy
[38:05] that's why i'm shouting tonight
[38:07] because i know
[38:09] the grace of god has been so good
[38:12] to you and i
[38:14] what else can we do
[38:16] what manner of love is this
[38:18] that we can be called
[38:21] the sons of god
[38:23] wretched sinners
[38:24] and no
[38:25] and no
[38:27] it does not appear but we shall be
[38:30] but we know
[38:31] when we see him we shall be like him
[38:35] we shall be changed
[38:38] oh
[38:38] hallelujah
[38:40] oh are you with me
[38:42] oh blessed be the lord
[38:44] so watch how can you come to god without
[38:48] god calling you first
[38:49] all he forned you
[38:53] all
[38:54] all
[38:55] he phoned you
[38:56] he called
[38:58] or
[38:59] he call he justify and to justify as i
[39:03] said as if you never did it
[39:05] all
[39:06] he torn you oh let's say this way all he
[39:09] knew before
[39:13] did you hear what i said
[39:14] all
[39:15] he knew before
[39:17] he called oh
[39:19] he called he justified all he justified
[39:23] he had
[39:25] it's finished
[39:29] oh
[39:33] hallelujah
[39:35] so watch this
[39:36] even though the lamb
[39:38] had to be slain on earth it was slain
[39:40] and god's thinking because everything
[39:43] under heaven
[39:44] have a season
[39:46] and a time
[39:47] to every purpose
[39:49] so even though it is finished it have a
[39:51] season and time to come into its
[39:54] fulfillment or coming to its fruition so
[39:58] when you're looking for your season
[40:01] when your season comes
[40:03] your seasons come
[40:06] that's why jesus keeps saying my always
[40:09] not yet
[40:12] you may be seasoned
[40:13] they want to stone him they want to do
[40:15] this he will say my always thought she
[40:16] had come all of a sudden he changed he
[40:18] said my always come
[40:20] but the son of man be glorified
[40:22] but before that nothing could tap him
[40:25] nothing to defeat him nothing could trap
[40:27] him because you know he ever all in time
[40:29] to do a certain work
[40:31] and god predestinated you here we go for
[40:33] certain work
[40:35] no kind of bounce you down
[40:37] no building falling in your head
[40:39] this happening and forget about it
[40:42] nothing can defeat
[40:48] the purpose of god
[40:56] let me
[40:58] let me bring it to no real story for you
[40:59] maybe season
[41:00] look at samson
[41:01] what's the purpose
[41:03] to destroy the philistines that's the
[41:05] purpose god's gain some introductory
[41:07] behaviors

[41:12] everybody afraid samson samson's a big
[41:14] champion when they say samson get
[41:15] frightened

[41:26] now we handle them we lock them up
[41:29] something take up the gate by the post
[41:31] and park it on a hill
[41:33] in other words possess the gates of the
[41:35] enemy something it wasn't stopping
[41:37] samson philistine one time
[41:40] thousand men and samson had no weapon
[41:42] take up a jawbone i beat them a thousand
[41:44] men with with brass helmet
[41:46] what a report for that man they're going
[41:48] to report to his superiors
[41:50] they say okay all they get licked so
[41:51] they get blows and they get defeated by
[41:53] how much army
[41:54] by how many
[41:56] they say
[41:58] they they want to talk it
[42:00] they want to say so embarrassing
[42:04] no
[42:06] the king said you got to be joking she
[42:08] said no
[42:09] who samson
[42:11] someone's a drag named the caller they
[42:12] don't call you i have to get respect to
[42:13] their name
[42:15] sam's who you can't just call something
[42:16] like that you tremble fear and trembling
[42:19] when you hear that name god samson
[42:20] that man what the fear of god to the
[42:22] philistines
[42:25] hallelujah because they knew god was
[42:26] with samsa
[42:28] well those philistines don't just sit
[42:29] down and say well we're taking that
[42:30] blues they said the plot and plan they
[42:32] loosely lied at him but god had a bigger
[42:34] plan than that
[42:38] you're not here in me
[42:40] delilah we lived wheel his way into his
[42:41] life until she caught him
[42:44] and samson appeared
[42:46] to be fully comprehensively
[42:48] defeated
[42:51] stumps bold
[42:53] something grinding at the mill
[42:55] man without eyes
[42:57] weak as normal man see samson didn't
[43:00] know outside the anointing normal man
[43:02] a christian is not a normal man
[43:06] we are different
[43:10] no man we smoke and drink one woman we
[43:12] are different
[43:13] we call it a higher order
[43:15] don't bring that in here we are
[43:16] different
[43:18] come on same and somebody
[43:22] see the power the glory you underseated
[43:24] was not samsung's own
[43:27] was a higher order
[43:29] that was upon samsung
[43:30] amen samson grime but the philistines
[43:33] went too far
[43:35] they wanted entertainment
[43:37] they wanted to make fun god don't
[43:38] respect that they wanted to make fun of
[43:40] god's silver and that was broken that
[43:42] was defeated that was battered literally
[43:44] they realized that here was growing back
[43:46] the same hair that was cut the same
[43:48] virtues that were shaved off
[43:50] the same thunders that was roaring all
[43:51] along
[43:52] shaking the devil left and right and
[43:54] center now it was restored back and they
[43:56] brought samson blind boy a little boy
[43:58] leading him to the pillar he said leave
[44:00] me to the pillars where the whole
[44:01] building is at
[44:02] i like that samson have an understanding
[44:05] you can't call for fire you're not in
[44:06] position what if i were to burn you up
[44:10] he would just follow you with that
[44:12] shut up that can you go along
[44:14] samson didn't want that kind of thing
[44:16] sometimes they put me by the post
[44:18] because when this power comes got to do
[44:20] something so you got to be interested in
[44:24] being positionally placed
[44:27] i'm not hearing you
[44:29] because power coming
[44:31] fire coming
[44:33] revival it's coming
[44:35] oh yes
[44:36] but you want to be in position
[44:43] samsung parade
[44:44] philistine's looking for entertainment
[44:46] literally this is succulent size
[44:48] tears running down
[44:50] he said lord avenge me of my
[44:52] adversaries
[44:54] notice his prayer he will say lord
[44:56] i'm a sinner i deserve it
[45:00] if samson was praying that kind of
[45:01] prayer number one is sure he had no
[45:03] revelation
[45:04] number two he was going to remain a
[45:06] sinner
[45:07] because no faith was going to
[45:08] appropriate any power coming down
[45:11] and he was going to stay there and the
[45:13] philistine have a good laugh but samson
[45:14] wasn't connected to that
[45:16] samson reached back before he fell
[45:18] before delilah before there was a moon
[45:21] before there was a star before there was
[45:23] a molecule samson reached back before
[45:26] the foundational world where he was a
[45:28] son when he was a seed when he was a
[45:31] thought when he had his name written
[45:33] samson said avenge me
[45:35] your son
[45:37] of taking my eyes
[45:38] once more
[45:41] that the son
[45:43] talking to pharah
[45:46] i'm not hearing you
[45:48] i'm not hearing you
[45:50] that is not somebody outside that
[45:52] there's somebody inside somebody
[45:54] belonging to the kingdom that's a
[45:56] kingdom son
[45:58] saying father
[45:59] you give me eyes these rascals had no
[46:03] right
[46:07] samson was elected
[46:11] samson was obtained for a purpose
[46:13] once more lord
[46:15] and the power struck him and the bill
[46:17] began to shake and samson killed more
[46:20] philistines in his death than he did in
[46:23] his life his purpose was accomplished
[46:27] give the lord a shout
[46:29] nothing come in his feet
[46:33] let the haters hit on
[46:36] that can't stop it

[49:44] you're living under a privilege
[49:46] i want to read a private interview
[49:48] about a brand with a woman
[49:50] that i referred to
[49:53] a masterpiece
[49:55] the following is a personal interview
[49:56] but the branham height with her sister
[49:57] georgia bruce
[49:59] during the song service preceding the
[50:00] message
[50:02] the masterpiece
[50:04] he's speaking to the woman it's his
[50:05] sister
[50:07] i visited you in the hospital at that
[50:08] time and i prayed constantly god
[50:09] wouldn't let you die she was sick
[50:11] because you are value to the church
[50:13] now i know you
[50:14] i know you're going to be all right
[50:15] sister bruce i believe in all my heart
[50:18] this is just a bruce response
[50:20] but a branham most of all
[50:22] i want the experience
[50:24] that i've been sealed in the holy ghost
[50:26] and if god revealed it to your heart
[50:29] and brother branham speaking i believe
[50:31] with all my heart
[50:32] that you are a real born again believer
[50:34] sister bruce how could that spirit just
[50:36] leave when you get sick you get weary
[50:40] you're a nervous type person sister
[50:42] bruce said yes and you get things on
[50:44] your mind see little bitty things it
[50:46] just keeps building up both ways and you
[50:48] get somebody on your heart you want to
[50:50] pray for them get up and pray for it you
[50:51] can't rest till you get that person
[50:53] prayed for that's you then you take on
[50:55] the other side satan might present
[50:57] something to you out of this way then
[50:59] it's your nature and god works and satan
[51:02] works then when satan tries to make you
[51:04] believe that you are not you keep
[51:06] building this and building this don't
[51:09] look at yourself sister bruce
[51:11] remember i'm fixing to pray for you i'm
[51:13] not worthy of that what would i do if
[51:15] jesus christ was sitting here now what
[51:17] would he do if he was sitting here he
[51:19] would lay his hands upon you with his
[51:21] great faith see and you'll get well but
[51:22] i think i'm a sinner i am not him i come
[51:26] to represent him but remember me
[51:29] being a sinner and before god
[51:32] i am not a sinner
[51:34] and neither are you
[51:39] could i read that part again
[51:42] you think i'm a sinner i'm not him but i
[51:45] come to represent him but remember me
[51:47] being a sinner and before god i am not a
[51:50] sinner neither are you
[51:52] we have got a blood sacrifice laying
[51:55] there
[51:56] god don't even see us
[51:59] he hears our voice
[52:01] but he sees the blood of christ
[52:04] that's it he sees the blood of his own
[52:07] son
[52:08] it's our voice but it's christ's blood
[52:11] then it is christ that is talking to us
[52:14] to god so therefore we are not sinners
[52:16] no more we are christians
[52:19] and i believe you to be a genuine
[52:21] christian woman
[52:26] sister bruce says
[52:28] i have made so many mistakes
[52:31] and i feel so many times but abraham
[52:34] that's why christ had to die
[52:37] so you with your mistakes it wouldn't be
[52:39] lotted to you
[52:40] he took your mistakes your desire in
[52:44] your heart is to save him sister bruce
[52:46] says yes that's what he died for so you
[52:48] could serve him your mistakes are not
[52:50] looked
[52:52] it is not allotted to you
[52:55] he is your appropriation
[52:57] he is your sin offering
[52:59] you are not a sinner before god christ
[53:02] took your sins
[53:03] and became you
[53:05] because your desire is to serve him
[53:09] sister bruce says but i've never had an
[53:11] experience that have been filled with
[53:13] the holy ghost that i could put my foot
[53:15] on
[53:16] all right notice this ordinarily a human
[53:19] being is born in sin shape or inequity
[53:21] comes to the word speaking lies that's
[53:23] the nature of a human being since the
[53:24] bruce said yes that was your nature it's
[53:27] changed once uh but it what changed it
[53:30] she said christ there you are sister
[53:32] that's it he that heard my words and
[53:34] believing him that sent me out eternal
[53:35] life shall not come to judgment but pass
[53:37] on death unto life you are christian
[53:39] sister bruce here we go are you ready
[53:42] i have watched your life
[53:44] i have watched you on the vision
[53:47] and i know you're a christian
[53:53] now she said she makes so much of
[53:54] failures and so much mistake and he see
[53:57] her on the vision
[53:58] and he wasn't seeing the failures and
[54:00] the missing he said i know you're a
[54:02] christian i have seen your life i've
[54:04] seen it on the vision praise god watch
[54:07] there's not a speck i am your shepherd
[54:09] as it was she said yes somebody to help
[54:12] you if there was any doubt in my mind if
[54:14] i told there was something wrong i will
[54:16] tell you sister bruce and if there was
[54:18] anything wrong in your experience
[54:20] anything wrong between you and god as
[54:21] far as i know nothing about there is not
[54:23] a thing
[54:25] oh give the lord some praises
[54:28] oh
[54:29] hallelujah
[54:30] so i wonder what god's seeing this
[54:32] morning
[54:33] and what you seeing this morning
[54:35] your failures your short comments your
[54:37] mistakes and whatnot but under vision
[54:40] oh glory to god you are son and daughter
[54:42] of the living god give the lord a shout
[54:45] out
[54:50] well praise the lord
[54:52] so therefore god has tied for the end in
[54:54] mind
[54:59] the seed
[55:01] that can be planted
[55:02] has to be ripe and mature
[55:04] you don't plant a green corn seed
[55:07] so the seed is figurative and
[55:09] representative of the end product
[55:12] a dry
[55:13] grain a corn it's mature it's ripe but
[55:17] that is what is going to be buried
[55:19] to reproduce more of his same kind
[55:22] isn't that right
[55:23] hallelujah so you start with the end in
[55:25] mind
[55:26] you start with the mature seed
[55:28] that is the seed that can be sown and
[55:31] through the process of plant life you
[55:32] get the fruit at the end
[55:35] ecliesis 3 15 says that which had been
[55:38] is now
[55:40] and that which is to be had already
[55:44] that's like a parable and god required
[55:45] that which is passed
[55:48] that's a big scripture
[55:49] there is no light scripture that's a big
[55:51] one i really can't that which had been
[55:53] is known
[55:54] that it's just bee has already been
[55:57] and god require
[55:58] that which is past
[56:00] you start with the seed
[56:02] and the seed is the word
[56:04] jesus said the parable is the seed is
[56:07] the word the word is a seed for a
[56:10] villain of god notice all the glory that
[56:12] was in god is in the word
[56:17] because in the beginning was the word it
[56:18] was not with god
[56:19] and the word was god so all the glory is
[56:22] where
[56:23] in the word isn't that right
[56:26] so praise god so he emptied himself
[56:29] poured himself into christ and christ
[56:32] behind the veil
[56:34] therefore the christian life here we go
[56:37] is a daily struggle between our two
[56:39] natures
[56:42] the law of the flesh
[56:44] and the law of the spirit
[56:46] and paul identified the law of the flesh
[56:48] in romans 7.
[56:50] from verse 14 he said we know that the
[56:52] lord is spiritual
[56:53] but i am carnal soul unto sin verse 15.
[56:56] for that which i do i alone not on what
[56:58] i would that i i do i not
[57:01] what i hate that i do
[57:03] for if then i do
[57:04] that which i would not
[57:06] and consent unto the lord that is good
[57:09] then it is no more i that do it
[57:11] but sin
[57:12] that dwelleth in me
[57:14] for i know that in me that is in my
[57:17] flesh
[57:18] dwell at no good thing
[57:20] for to will is present with me but how
[57:23] to perform that which is good i find not
[57:25] for the good that i would i do not but
[57:28] the evil which i would not that i do
[57:30] now if i do that that i would not it is
[57:33] no more i that do it
[57:35] but sin that dwelleth in me
[57:37] i find them a law
[57:39] that when i would do good evil is
[57:41] present with me
[57:43] and i delight in the law of god after
[57:45] the inward man
[57:46] but i see another law
[57:49] in my members warren against the law of
[57:51] my mind
[57:52] and bringing me into captivity to the
[57:55] law of sin which is in my members all
[57:58] wretched man that i am
[58:00] who shall deliver me from the body of
[58:03] this debt
[58:04] but i thank god through jesus christ our
[58:07] lord
[58:08] then with the mind i myself serve the
[58:11] law of god but with the flesh
[58:13] the law of sin
[58:16] oh could we give the lord some praises
[58:18] that's just the scriptures
[58:20] but the scriptures is anointed
[58:22] the script is inspired it's been
[58:25] inspired to you
[58:27] that's the law of sin
[58:29] in your nature you may be seated
[58:31] then romans chapter 8
[58:33] the law of the spirit
[58:34] it won there is therefore no no
[58:36] condemnation
[58:38] to them who are in christ jesus who walk
[58:40] not after the flesh but after the spirit
[58:44] for the law of the spirit in christ
[58:46] jesus had made me free from the law of
[58:49] sin and death oh could we give the lord
[58:52] a praise offered
[58:53] oh
[58:55] hallelujah hallelujah
[58:57] glory
[58:58] hallelujah
[59:00] genesis 1 26 and god said
[59:03] let us make man
[59:05] in our image
[59:07] in all likeness john 4 god is a spirit
[59:10] did not worship him must worship him in
[59:13] spirit and in truth so god image and
[59:15] likeness is spirit so the first man god
[59:18] made genesis 1 was a spirit man that was
[59:22] the man that had dominion that was the
[59:24] man that had power that was a man like a
[59:27] spirit being isn't that right
[59:30] what about him say with a spirit man
[59:32] the order of god
[59:34] isn't that right
[59:35] and he said no the first man he give man
[59:38] to lead the animal life
[59:40] like the holy spirit leads the believer
[59:42] today
[59:44] and if we were in perfect submission to
[59:46] the holy spirit god would lead us by the
[59:48] holy spirit
[59:49] now watch
[59:50] then there was no man to till the soil
[59:53] man
[59:54] physical man so genesis one man was
[59:57] spirit man genesis 2 man there was no
[1:00:00] man to tell the soil no physical being
[1:00:04] so then he fought man out of the dust of
[1:00:07] the earth and put the spirit man into
[1:00:10] this dust man
[1:00:11] the bible said man become a living soul
[1:00:15] a living soul
[1:00:17] a living soul
[1:00:19] so this image you see
[1:00:20] today is the image of animal life this
[1:00:23] is not the image of the son of god what
[1:00:26] you see the physical is animal life the
[1:00:29] image of man image of dust is not the
[1:00:31] image of god god made two men spirit man
[1:00:34] and dust man and put the spirit man in
[1:00:36] the dust man and man become a living
[1:00:38] soul and that's the man that you see
[1:00:41] around you here this morning isn't that
[1:00:44] right
[1:00:45] so man
[1:00:46] made him out of the dust of the earth
[1:00:48] not his own image
[1:00:50] he already made the man but then he
[1:00:52] breathed into him the breath of life and
[1:00:55] he became a living soul
[1:00:57] so the soul
[1:00:58] of man
[1:01:00] is the nature of the spirit
[1:01:03] the soul
[1:01:05] of man
[1:01:06] is the nature of the spirit so when you
[1:01:10] are reborn you don't get a new spirit
[1:01:13] you get a new nature of that spirit it's
[1:01:16] the same spirit but a new nature of it
[1:01:19] you take two men stand them together
[1:01:21] both look alike one of them is a sinner
[1:01:23] one of them in a christian one man said
[1:01:25] i got a spirit the same as you have see
[1:01:27] but one is different his soul
[1:01:30] his nature is different
[1:01:32] he's been changed
[1:01:34] so then he breathe into this man
[1:01:36] and watch he put him in five senses so
[1:01:39] he could contact his earthly home
[1:01:41] see
[1:01:42] smell feel here he made him that way now
[1:01:45] those senses was not to contact god
[1:01:52] you like good food yeah i like good food
[1:01:54] too
[1:01:55] have taste to do that with
[1:01:57] right but that's not how to contact god
[1:01:59] that's for you to communicate here on
[1:02:01] the earth see feel smell and touch and
[1:02:03] so on that's what those senses are for
[1:02:05] isn't that right god have a bigger sense
[1:02:06] for you to contact him with that's a
[1:02:08] sense of faith it's a substance what you
[1:02:11] can't touch and feel and taste and smell
[1:02:13] and hear it's a supernatural substance
[1:02:16] that god put inside of you as a
[1:02:17] cornerstone inside your heart inside
[1:02:20] your soul a substance called faith that
[1:02:23] you can't even explain it it's
[1:02:24] supernatural you can't show anybody you
[1:02:26] just live it you just demonstrate it you
[1:02:28] just manifest it you just believe the
[1:02:30] word you don't even know how you just
[1:02:32] say amen to the word because that faith
[1:02:34] inside of you is agreeing with the word
[1:02:36] being spoken isn't that right hallelujah
[1:02:38] isn't that right
[1:02:40] so he said i have a picture of adam
[1:02:42] he was dead as he could be his toes like
[1:02:44] roots sticking on the ground and gossip
[1:02:45] let there be and breathe a breath of
[1:02:47] life into him and he jumped came to
[1:02:49] himself breathe a breath of life into
[1:02:51] him and he became a living soul
[1:02:54] now there are two elements
[1:02:56] that make up a human being one of them
[1:02:58] is your mind the other is your soul and
[1:03:01] the mind is your mental thinking your
[1:03:02] intellect your soul is a part of god
[1:03:05] that's in you now when you're born
[1:03:08] and as a child you go into a living soul
[1:03:10] at the age of choice you hear the gospel
[1:03:14] and there is something weird inside of
[1:03:15] you that until you receive christ and
[1:03:17] you say well i'm too young now i'll wait
[1:03:19] a little longer now that is why you make
[1:03:21] a first mistake right there you grieve
[1:03:23] this person inside god is not going to
[1:03:24] judge you by the man up here your
[1:03:26] intellect he's going to judge you by
[1:03:27] your soul
[1:03:29] now many people have faith in their
[1:03:30] intellect others have faith in their
[1:03:32] soul now the intellect will reason and
[1:03:35] say it's not reasonable and so forth but
[1:03:37] remember the soul just believes the word
[1:03:39] of god
[1:03:40] isn't that right
[1:03:42] from recognizing this message listen to
[1:03:43] this no
[1:03:45] why
[1:03:46] you talking about uh trump revelation 17
[1:03:49] 11
[1:03:50] appears in line with the sixth seal
[1:03:52] mostly elijah two witnesses this is the
[1:03:54] part i want to get to mostly last
[1:03:56] which the jews believe the prophets and
[1:03:58] they will come with the sign of the
[1:03:59] prophets and their work exactly
[1:04:02] now watch
[1:04:03] show one thing
[1:04:05] that man
[1:04:06] when you die
[1:04:08] whatever
[1:04:10] when you leave this world your nature
[1:04:12] doesn't change
[1:04:14] if you are liar now you'll be a liar
[1:04:17] there if you're hot headed here you'll
[1:04:19] be hunted a deer if your daughter here
[1:04:21] you'll be adopted there men and women
[1:04:23] it's time to shake yourselves and
[1:04:25] examine yourselves and see where we are
[1:04:27] standing for death does not change it
[1:04:32] that's why naked that came into this
[1:04:33] world but naked you will not leave
[1:04:35] you believe with your character or your
[1:04:37] nature
[1:04:38] death doesn't change who you are
[1:04:41] jet only changes your dwelling place
[1:04:45] are you with me
[1:04:47] so they have been gone for two thousand
[1:04:48] years moses is about 2500 years and 2500
[1:04:51] years has elijah been gone and moses and
[1:04:53] they return with the same nature and do
[1:04:55] the same thing
[1:04:56] debt doesn't do nothing to a man but
[1:04:59] change his dwelling place
[1:05:01] it doesn't change your nature it doesn't
[1:05:03] change your faith it doesn't change
[1:05:05] nothing but your dwelling place so if
[1:05:08] you're nature this morning you're doubt
[1:05:09] of god's word you'll be a doctor over
[1:05:11] there so i don't care whole you are how
[1:05:13] you live and how good you live it
[1:05:16] wouldn't change you a bit to die
[1:05:18] just your dwelling please
[1:05:20] and if you can't accept the whole word
[1:05:23] of god the way it's written you won't do
[1:05:25] it there don't worry you won't be there
[1:05:27] you have got to accept it in its
[1:05:29] fullness
[1:05:30] in the power of his vindication and the
[1:05:33] revelation of what it is then you become
[1:05:36] part of it
[1:05:37] are you with me
[1:05:39] so i've often said in the church he said
[1:05:42] live
[1:05:43] in a church
[1:05:45] live mortal beings each one is a great
[1:05:48] con commemoration of gaity and blackness
[1:05:50] and darkness mortals live here
[1:05:52] they are either influenced from this way
[1:05:55] or that way here we go you cannot be a
[1:05:57] spiritual being sin or saint without
[1:06:00] having the influence on the underworld
[1:06:02] or the above world
[1:06:04] if you are influenced from here you are
[1:06:07] from above
[1:06:08] your celestial body is waiting up there
[1:06:11] but if you are wicked and hypocritical
[1:06:12] and indifferent your celestial body is
[1:06:15] down here regardless of how much you
[1:06:17] think it's up there because the fruit
[1:06:19] here we go
[1:06:20] the fruit that you bear before people
[1:06:22] proves where you're from
[1:06:24] are you ready
[1:06:26] so you are here
[1:06:28] what you are somewhere else
[1:06:34] that's a big one
[1:06:36] that's a big
[1:06:37] big big one you are here
[1:06:40] what you are somewhere else
[1:06:43] your life that you have lived here is
[1:06:45] reflecting your what your inheritance is
[1:06:48] when you leave here
[1:06:51] that's why the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:06:53] is the earnest
[1:06:55] or the down payment
[1:06:56] of your inheritance
[1:06:58] is a reflection that you already raised
[1:07:00] up
[1:07:01] and you're on your way to the
[1:07:02] resurrection
[1:07:05] so god give you a little don't payment
[1:07:07] the whole
[1:07:08] say hold this virtue power
[1:07:10] but you have more coming
[1:07:12] you have knowledge and temperance and
[1:07:14] patience and godliness and public you
[1:07:16] have more virtues coming
[1:07:18] oh give the lord some praises people
[1:07:20] hallelujah
[1:07:22] here's a woman standing here
[1:07:24] i'm a young man waiting to get married
[1:07:26] she meets my specifications in every way
[1:07:29] she's a lovely christian she looks like
[1:07:30] one she's dressed like one she acts like
[1:07:32] one she lives like one i admit she'll
[1:07:34] make me a good wife but she isn't mine
[1:07:36] until i take off her mind
[1:07:39] and that's the way the message is you
[1:07:41] can sympathize with it say it's right
[1:07:43] but you've got to take it to yourself
[1:07:45] and
[1:07:46] for it to become part of it then you and
[1:07:49] the message become one
[1:07:51] then the anointing is with you
[1:07:54] as it with the others so the anointing
[1:07:56] is not just with the preacher but the
[1:07:58] anointed comes with you
[1:08:00] because you make the message a part of
[1:08:02] you and you are part of it then i will
[1:08:04] never leave you i'll never forsake you
[1:08:06] the anointing is with you wherever you
[1:08:08] go he is you don't have to feel him he
[1:08:10] is there
[1:08:12] all the time
[1:08:14] oh glory to god because he said so
[1:08:17] i'll never leave you
[1:08:18] i'll never forsake you i will be with
[1:08:21] you even in you to the end of the world
[1:08:24] oh could we give the lord some praises
[1:08:25] people
[1:08:27] glory
[1:08:29] hallelujah
[1:08:30] hallelujah
[1:08:32] blessed be the lord
[1:08:34] no brother branham
[1:08:36] is it true that every jew
[1:08:39] born since christ came will be saved
[1:08:41] who are the 144 thousand are they the
[1:08:44] predestinated ones to be sealed by the
[1:08:46] holy ghost and what is their mission
[1:08:48] there about three questions there
[1:08:50] is it true that every jew born since
[1:08:52] christ came in the world will be saved
[1:08:53] no
[1:08:55] here we go
[1:08:56] nothing will be saved
[1:08:58] only those whose names were put on the
[1:09:01] lamb's book of life before the
[1:09:03] foundation of the world jew or gentiles
[1:09:06] so when that book is concerned you are
[1:09:08] gentle your name have to be there
[1:09:10] that's why they say almost thousands of
[1:09:12] this tribe and that tribe and that tribe
[1:09:14] type of benjamin whatever it is specific
[1:09:17] after the tribe
[1:09:18] 144 tons is that right
[1:09:20] the book doesn't say leaving let's be
[1:09:22] saved in this time of this church or oh
[1:09:23] my never it doesn't say that it just
[1:09:26] shows the mystery
[1:09:27] or unfolds a mystery
[1:09:29] but we ourselves by faith believe it
[1:09:34] so the book doesn't say john jones and
[1:09:36] harry smith or whatever the book that
[1:09:38] shows the mystery and you by faith
[1:09:40] connect with it
[1:09:41] and you see your name you say that's me
[1:09:44] that's me
[1:09:45] i am not madam party that's me oh glory
[1:09:48] to god i am no cigarette sucker oh yeah
[1:09:50] man miniskirt wearer no i want the word
[1:09:53] i want something that thunders i am not
[1:09:55] going to be a photocopy of all the young
[1:09:57] people out there no i'm going to be
[1:09:58] original
[1:10:00] oh are you with me
[1:10:02] now oh watch then then he said we'll be
[1:10:05] one as i am the father one that kind of
[1:10:07] one then how will it be the word in us
[1:10:11] would be the anointed word and that is
[1:10:14] the oneness of god the oneness of god is
[1:10:16] the word anointed in you
[1:10:19] then you become a son
[1:10:21] a messiah of the age
[1:10:23] so in other words you come from taught
[1:10:26] and you bypass the word
[1:10:29] you came to the earth to be tempted and
[1:10:31] tested
[1:10:32] but you are going back to the world
[1:10:34] because you have to be a taught
[1:10:36] in order to be a word
[1:10:38] because a word is a taught express
[1:10:40] you think it and then speak it so god
[1:10:42] can't lose his thoughts
[1:10:44] what fine thoughts he is thinking
[1:10:47] oh hallelujah what beautiful thoughts
[1:10:50] he's thinking this morning so watch this
[1:10:52] the one at a well with her life
[1:10:55] on earth she looks black she looks dirty
[1:10:57] she looks filthy whatever it is but in
[1:10:58] heaven she's fine
[1:11:02] you understand that
[1:11:04] now the pharisees on earth they look
[1:11:05] fine with the long gong and they put on
[1:11:07] the beard look spiritual what not but
[1:11:09] they were black their name was not up
[1:11:10] there because they're called to crucify
[1:11:12] him so that woman that's looking this
[1:11:14] way and that way her name is up there
[1:11:16] and this one looking so spiritual the
[1:11:18] name not up there so you can't go by
[1:11:20] looks
[1:11:22] it's not look as though this
[1:11:24] is believers though this
[1:11:26] you can't go by lurks
[1:11:30] because the same thing samuel was going
[1:11:32] to do
[1:11:34] when he was told to anoint one of
[1:11:35] jesse's son when the first guy came tall
[1:11:38] and handsome he said this surely this is
[1:11:40] he
[1:11:41] and god say god i don't go by looks.
[1:11:44] god doesn't see the way man sees oh give
[1:11:47] the lord some praise god doesn't see
[1:11:51] hallelujah
[1:11:53] glory
[1:11:54] now you say adam died by the brahmana
[1:11:55] but remember before adam died he had a
[1:11:57] lamb that redeemed him those who he
[1:11:59] fiona he called he had a lamb that
[1:12:01] redeemed him is not right then the lamb
[1:12:03] provided for adam is not right then why
[1:12:05] would we strike of eternal life if that
[1:12:07] eternal sword breathes us by bread now
[1:12:09] someday the sons of god will again
[1:12:11] become gods
[1:12:13] jesus said it's not it written your law
[1:12:15] your gods if you call those who we call
[1:12:17] god who visited you how can you condemn
[1:12:19] me to say i'm a son of god no watch he
[1:12:23] is now a son of god he makes a mistake
[1:12:25] he knows he's not he's doing wrong adam
[1:12:27] was not deceived
[1:12:29] adam knew he was doing wrong adam walked
[1:12:31] with eve because it was his wife
[1:12:33] christ was not deceived by satan but he
[1:12:36] walked into his death with the bride he
[1:12:38] went to be with the bride so he could
[1:12:39] redeem the church so he could understand
[1:12:42] how man was fallen so god became man to
[1:12:44] redeem man he can't redeem man from up
[1:12:47] dear he had to come down here to redeem
[1:12:50] man so he subject himself to the law of
[1:12:52] sin and death
[1:12:53] that's why christ had to die
[1:12:55] hallelujah to reach us right where we
[1:12:58] are
[1:12:59] oh glory to god
[1:13:01] hallelujah
[1:13:03] in spirit he was god in flesh he was man
[1:13:06] my god why have god forsaken me
[1:13:11] oh hallelujah in other words he wept at
[1:13:14] the grave of lazarus as a man he wept
[1:13:17] but when he bought roll away the stone
[1:13:19] when he ball where have you laid him
[1:13:21] when he cried lazarus come forth that
[1:13:23] was more than a man so on this side you
[1:13:25] see the law of sin and death you see in
[1:13:27] tears you see and crying you're seeing
[1:13:30] depression and frustration but when you
[1:13:31] speak it thunders
[1:13:35] oh
[1:13:36] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[1:13:39] so don't mystic weakness hallelujah for
[1:13:42] weakness meekness or weakness no
[1:13:44] meekness is power in control
[1:13:47] oh hallelujah when he look and defeated
[1:13:49] the cross on his back they're beating
[1:13:50] him they're hitting him they're laughing
[1:13:52] at him when you're looking at his
[1:13:53] weakest point he was at his greatest
[1:13:55] conquering power because he's going on
[1:13:57] the hell to take the keys and the devil
[1:14:00] i've got the keys on hell and the grill
[1:14:03] oh glory to god hallelujah
[1:14:05] hell rejoicing because the messiah is
[1:14:08] crucified but then they heard unknocking
[1:14:11] i went to heard that knocking here the
[1:14:13] lamb jesus opened up that cape and he
[1:14:16] snatched the keys of death and hell and
[1:14:18] let captivity captive all who the devil

[1:14:37] victory paul lick up that paul game and
[1:14:40] make that look so small

[1:22:13] you may be seated praise god
[1:22:15] from the token no we're going to get
[1:22:17] under some heavy stuff oh glory to god
[1:22:20] the blood had to be applied and the
[1:22:22] blood meant animal died but the animal
[1:22:25] had no soul so the nature couldn't come
[1:22:27] back upon man to replace his own old
[1:22:30] nature isn't that right so then the
[1:22:32] blood which was the chemistry is what
[1:22:34] was represented
[1:22:36] as the token when i see the blood i'm
[1:22:39] going to pass over you because the
[1:22:41] animal life had no soul
[1:22:44] so there was no spirit from the animal
[1:22:45] to come back upon the worshipper but
[1:22:47] when jesus died he was god's lamb his
[1:22:50] soul was the holy ghost so when he died
[1:22:53] the life of that lamb could not come
[1:22:56] back upon the believer and that's the
[1:22:58] holy ghost that's the change of nature
[1:23:01] that's the soul
[1:23:02] oh glory to god are you seeing it
[1:23:05] hallelujah no more the chemistry but the
[1:23:08] life of god come back upon you the
[1:23:11] believer then it's not you no more it's
[1:23:13] the holy ghost upon you it's the holy
[1:23:15] ghost in you as the holy ghost through
[1:23:17] you
[1:23:26] so the talker now
[1:23:27] is the literal life of jesus christ
[1:23:29] we turn back upon the believer
[1:23:31] from so that a prisoner now the soul of
[1:23:33] man is not the body of man
[1:23:35] it's the soul and the soul is the nature
[1:23:37] of the spirit so when the nature of man
[1:23:40] we were dead because we were dead our
[1:23:42] lives are hidden god through christ
[1:23:43] sealed by the holy ghost that wasn't
[1:23:45] your body that died it wasn't your
[1:23:47] spirit you died it was your nature of
[1:23:49] your spirit that died and the nature
[1:23:51] which is the soul the nature of your
[1:23:53] soul god if you're born again it's not
[1:23:55] you oh hallelujah it's eternal life it's
[1:23:58] life that never a beginning life that
[1:24:00] never and then that's what's inside of
[1:24:01] you
[1:24:02] oh praise the name of the lord so all
[1:24:04] powers of hell might wage against it but
[1:24:06] it will never prevail we have god's
[1:24:08] eternal promise oprah is not up to me
[1:24:11] it's not up to you whether it will be
[1:24:12] destroyed or not it's up to god oh
[1:24:14] hallelujah you know we would think today
[1:24:16] upon destruction trying to destroy we
[1:24:18] have christ on the promise we think of
[1:24:20] the hebrew children god had purpose for
[1:24:22] them that they were done in babylon that
[1:24:24] the fullness was hot seven times hotter
[1:24:26] it was gonna heat it they destroyed the
[1:24:27] purpose of god all babylon was on a rage
[1:24:30] they were determined satan was
[1:24:31] determined to destroy the purpose of god
[1:24:33] for he knew those churches going to the
[1:24:34] fullness so he made the furnace and
[1:24:37] heated up seven times hotter to be sure
[1:24:39] the program of god would be destroyed
[1:24:41] but god wanted to displace power and all
[1:24:44] babylon and all hell could not defeat
[1:24:46] that purpose they could have hid this
[1:24:48] furnace a million times hotter it would
[1:24:50] have never destroyed the purpose of god
[1:24:52] god wanted to show that he was the god
[1:24:55] of deliverance and he would bring
[1:24:57] deliverance to whomsoever he desired to
[1:25:00] bring it and nothing could interfere
[1:25:02] with this program so i'm telling you

[1:25:05] believe god for the impossible believe
[1:25:08] god for the difficult believe god for

[1:29:33] glory to god
[1:29:35] watch this fire cannot defeat the
[1:29:37] purpose of god's plan
[1:29:39] all the explaining away all the
[1:29:41] mathematics all the intelligence world
[1:29:43] disguise cannot destroy the faith in
[1:29:45] god's children it live off forever they
[1:29:47] wanted to put daniel lions then but he
[1:29:49] purpose in his heart he put much in his
[1:29:50] heart the land couldn't defeat the
[1:29:52] promise of god it's not right so it goes
[1:29:54] to show that nothing can defeat his
[1:29:56] purpose not even death not defeat his
[1:29:59] purpose abraham was good as dead serious
[1:30:01] woman been dead for 45 years but nothing
[1:30:03] can defeat the purpose of god what a
[1:30:05] curveball god bowl at the devil and let
[1:30:08] abraham believe sarah
[1:30:10] gonna have her son
[1:30:11] and watch watch when you force
[1:30:14] and manufacture something
[1:30:16] sarah had an interpretation
[1:30:18] of how that was supposed to be
[1:30:20] she said look at my maid and today the
[1:30:22] fruit of that is what you see all around
[1:30:25] right now
[1:30:27] a whole bunch of abraham's seed
[1:30:30] on a different line altogether
[1:30:35] the bible said every man shall be
[1:30:37] against them and they shall be against
[1:30:38] every man
[1:30:41] all the cutting out head neck everything
[1:30:44] a kind of murderous generation
[1:30:47] that because abraham had see through
[1:30:49] higa and they form a whole lineage right
[1:30:52] now
[1:30:55] all because he went and manufactured
[1:30:56] something instead of waiting
[1:30:58] for the promise so don't try to
[1:30:59] manufacture something you produce a wild
[1:31:01] man
[1:31:03] you produce an ishmael
[1:31:05] no stigmatizer
[1:31:08] stick with what god promised
[1:31:10] because the children are promised i
[1:31:11] counted for seed
[1:31:14] because all israel is not israel
[1:31:16] come on now all in the message is not
[1:31:18] the message
[1:31:20] all who say i believe the prophet they
[1:31:22] don't believe
[1:31:28] hallelujah have to have something to
[1:31:30] separate
[1:31:31] to show who is who
[1:31:33] her body was old and wrinkled milk veins
[1:31:35] was dried up her heart was weak it could
[1:31:38] not have went to labor
[1:31:40] but god let us know that his purpose
[1:31:42] will not be defeated he changed syria
[1:31:44] and make a young woman again amen and
[1:31:47] turn back in on his youth god gave a
[1:31:49] promise on abraham stacked not at the
[1:31:51] promise of god to unbelief but was
[1:31:53] strong giving praise to god hallelujah
[1:31:55] first of all we know most assuredly that
[1:31:57] the purpose of god stands in election it
[1:32:00] was purpose in himself it was god's
[1:32:02] purpose to pray for the people like unto
[1:32:03] himself that would be a word bride she
[1:32:06] was chosen before the foundation of the
[1:32:07] world to be in him she was foreknown and
[1:32:10] beloved before she ever even brought
[1:32:13] forth
[1:32:13] she was redeemed by his blood and can
[1:32:16] never come into condemnation
[1:32:18] she can never be in the judgment because
[1:32:21] sin cannot be imputed unto her
[1:32:24] this elect
[1:32:31] i'm talking to the lady elect
[1:32:33] and she's watching me like if i'm not
[1:32:34] talking to you i'm talking to you
[1:32:38] that's not
[1:32:40] you got to believe it you know
[1:32:42] you have to appropriate your fear to
[1:32:43] believe
[1:32:44] that you are what the words say here
[1:32:47] oh glory to god
[1:32:49] oh my hallelujah praise god god purpose
[1:32:52] cannot be defeated how happy we ought to
[1:32:55] be resting on that beautiful revelation
[1:32:57] of the word of god the living god
[1:32:58] there's neither things present no things
[1:33:00] to come there's no sickness no sorrow no
[1:33:02] death no perils nothing can separate us
[1:33:04] from the love of god
[1:33:05] so then only one daughter healing jesus
[1:33:07] is that door
[1:33:08] one daughter peace isn't that right he's
[1:33:10] all healing isn't that right and if
[1:33:12] jesus is the door to all these things
[1:33:14] and faith is a key that unlocks the door
[1:33:17] and if jesus is a door to all these
[1:33:18] promises of god fate in his finished

[1:33:37] see what's inside that box and when it's
[1:33:38] properly packed in he sees it on his
[1:33:41] destination isn't that right the seven
[1:33:43] seals is a finish work seven seals on
[1:33:45] the back side is the finished work it's
[1:33:47] a complete
[1:33:48] that's what the seas is about every seal
[1:33:49] finish
[1:33:50] complete and god put the holy ghost upon
[1:33:52] your life
[1:33:53] isn't that right
[1:33:55] i was told in bastard field they call it
[1:33:57] where they have these big jet planes and
[1:33:59] a jet can travel it goes a certain speed
