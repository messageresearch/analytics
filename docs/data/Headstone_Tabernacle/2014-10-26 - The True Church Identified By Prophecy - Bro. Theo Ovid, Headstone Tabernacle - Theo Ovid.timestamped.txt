[10:02] Philip this morning B she's had amen
[10:04] welcome invited by
[10:08] rusin at this time I would like you to
[10:11] turn your Bibles with me we want to go
[10:13] straight into the word this morning to
[10:15] Matthew chapter 16 Colossians chapter 1
[10:19] and Mark 16 for scripture reading this
[10:21] morning Matthew
[10:23] 16 Colossians chapter
[10:26] 1 and Mark chapter 16 this morning
[10:46] Matthew 16 reading from verse 13 when
[10:48] Jesus came into the coast of cesaria
[10:51] Philippi he asked his disciples saying
[10:53] whom do men say that I the son of man am
[10:58] and they said some say that th John the
[11:01] Baptist some Elias others Jeremiah one
[11:04] of the prophets he said unto them but
[11:08] whom say ye that I am and Simon Peter
[11:12] answered and said Thou Art the Christ
[11:14] the son of the Living God and Jesus
[11:16] answered and said unto him blessed are
[11:19] thou Simon B Jonah for Flesh and Blood
[11:22] had not revealed it unto thee but my
[11:24] Father which is in heaven and I say unto
[11:26] thee that thou artart Peter and on this
[11:29] rock I will build my church and the
[11:32] Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against
[11:36] it praise the name of the Lord reading
[11:39] from Colossians chapter 1 reading from
[11:42] verse
[11:49] 16 for by him were all things created
[11:52] that in heaven that are in Earth visible
[11:55] and invisible whether they be Thrones or
[11:59] dominions or principalities or Powers
[12:03] all things were created by Him and for
[12:05] him and he is before all things and by
[12:09] him all things consist and he is the
[12:12] head of the body the
[12:13] church who is the beginning the
[12:16] firstborn from the dead that in all
[12:19] things he might have the preeminence for
[12:21] it pleased the father that in him should
[12:24] all fullness dwell and then we want to
[12:27] go to Mark 16 reading from verse
[12:40] 15 and he said unto them go into all the
[12:43] world and preach the gospel to Every
[12:46] Creature he that believeth and is
[12:48] baptized shall be saved but he that
[12:52] believeth not shall be damned and these
[12:55] signs shall follow them that believe in
[12:57] my name they shall cast out Devils they
[12:59] shall speak with new tongues they shall
[13:01] take up serpents and if they drink any
[13:04] deadly thing it shall not hurt them they
[13:07] shall lay hands on the sick and they
[13:09] shall recover so then after the Lord had
[13:12] spoken unto them he was received up into
[13:15] heaven and sat on the right hand of God
[13:19] and they went forth and preached
[13:22] everywhere the Lord working with them
[13:25] confirming the word with signs following
[13:28] let us pray one more more time father we
[13:29] thank you for the your blessed word and
[13:32] we pray that you would come down and
[13:33] speak to our hearts Lord feed us the

[14:00] yes sir The rain that's Fallen outside
[14:03] is is rain natural rain we want
[14:06] spiritual rain amen that spiritual reain
[14:09] is what is Promised amen so it's really
[14:11] good to be here and uh I close
[14:16] off last service with a scripture and it
[14:19] was Ezekiel chapter 34 powerful
[14:22] scripture maybe some of you don't even
[14:25] know that scripture is there where God
[14:30] was dealing with the pastors with the
[14:34] Shepherds and speaking to them just want
[14:37] to continue and the word of the Lord is
[14:39] from Ezekiel 34 and the word of the Lord
[14:41] came unto me saying son of man prophesy
[14:43] against the Shepherds of Israel prophesy
[14:47] say unto them thus sayeth the Lord God
[14:49] unto the Shepherds woe be to the
[14:51] Shepherds of Israel that do feed
[14:53] themselves should not the Shepherds feed
[14:55] the flocks he eat the fat he clothed
[14:57] with wool you kill them that were fed
[15:00] but you feed not the flock the diseased
[15:04] have you not strengthened neither have
[15:06] you healed that which was sick neither
[15:08] have you br bound up that which was
[15:10] broken neither have you brought again
[15:13] that which was driven away neither have
[15:16] you sought that which was lost but with
[15:19] force and with cruelty have you ruled
[15:22] them and they were scattered because
[15:25] there is no Shepherd and they became
[15:27] meat to all the Beast of the field when
[15:30] they were scattered my sheep wandered
[15:32] through all the mountains upon High Hill
[15:34] yeah my flock was scattered upon all the
[15:37] face of the Earth none did search or
[15:40] seek after them therefore ye Shepherds
[15:43] hear the word of the Lord as I live
[15:45] sayth the Lord God surely because my
[15:47] flock became a prey my flock became meat
[15:50] to every beast of the field because
[15:52] there was no Shepherd neither did my
[15:54] shepherd search notice God's emphasis
[15:58] neither did my shepherd search for my
[16:00] flock notice it's not the shepherd's
[16:02] flock it is God's flock that is how he
[16:05] is seeing it he's not seeing it as
[16:08] pastor and that is my church he's not
[16:10] seeing that no no no what he's going to
[16:12] ask of them is the responsibility of
[16:15] being a Shepherd over his flock are you
[16:18] with me watch he said I live say the
[16:21] Lord God because my flock became prey
[16:23] and my flock became meat to every beast
[16:25] of the field because there was no
[16:27] Shepherd neither than my shepherd search
[16:30] for my flock but the Shepherds fed
[16:32] themselves and fed not my flock
[16:34] therefore oh ye Shepherds hear the word
[16:36] of the Lord thus sayeth the Lord God
[16:39] behold I'm against the Shepherds and
[16:42] I'll require my flock at their hands and
[16:47] cause them to cease from feeding the
[16:49] flock neither shall the Shepherds feed
[16:51] themselves anymore and I will deliver my
[16:54] flock from their mouth that they may not
[16:56] be meat for them and th sayith the Lord
[16:59] God behold I even I will both search my
[17:04] sheep and seek them out so there's a
[17:07] promise in the word that God himself
[17:10] would come down so the one that is after
[17:12] you is not flesh and blood no no no if
[17:14] you are sheep of God the one is after
[17:16] you is God himself that's why first
[17:19] second Thessalonians 4:16 the Lord
[17:21] himself descend from heaven with a shout
[17:24] to seek his sheep out oh praise the name
[17:27] of the Lord that's what the shout is
[17:28] about
[17:29] Hallelujah the shout come to get his
[17:31] sheep do you believe that this morning
[17:34] oh Hallelujah as a Shepherd seeketh out
[17:38] his flock in the day that he that he is
[17:40] among his sheep that is scattered so
[17:42] will I seek out my sheep I will deliver
[17:45] them out of all places where they have
[17:47] been scattered in a Cloudy and dark day
[17:50] so what a promise we have this morning
[17:52] that the chief Shepherd himself Jesus
[17:55] said I am the Good Shepherd and the Good
[17:57] Shepherd been lay on his life for the
[17:59] sheep and the Good Shepherd went on
[18:01] Calvary and laid on his life for the
[18:03] sheep that his Spirit could be released
[18:07] to go after every predestinated seed
[18:11] therefore there is no way you could miss
[18:12] it you got to make it you got to be
[18:16] delivered he know his sheep going to be
[18:18] trapped yeah he know his sheep is going
[18:20] to be bound but you are going to be

[18:26] Daniel prophesy about your deliverance
[18:28] he said at that time there will be a
[18:30] time of trouble such as never was seen
[18:33] since the world began but at that time
[18:35] Michael shall stand up Hallelujah

[19:42] Lord oh Hallelujah blessed be the name
[19:46] of the Lord oh Hallelujah so this
[19:50] morning the title of this message this
[19:53] morning is the true church identified by
[19:56] prophecy amen last service Sunday we had
[20:00] the ministry of Jesus Christ identifi
[20:03] identified by prophecy this morning we
[20:06] speaking about the true church identify
[20:09] by prophecy and my inspiration is
[20:12] another book of Acts Hallelujah
[20:14] Discerning the two Spirits at work
[20:17] that's the inspiration another book of
[20:19] Acts Discerning the two Spirits at work
[20:24] now there is going to be another book of
[20:26] Acts yes sir make no mistake about it
[20:30] the son of man came back just like the
[20:32] son of man revealed himself in the days
[20:34] of Jesus he was the son of man isn't
[20:36] that right he came among them and
[20:38] released promises to them promises that
[20:40] their faith was not ready to grasp but
[20:43] promises he released anyhow amen he
[20:45] couldn't release the promise in spirit
[20:47] form while he was with them because he
[20:51] told them the comforter is with you amen
[20:53] but shall be in you amen I will not
[20:56] leave you comfortless but I'm going to
[20:58] come to you a little while the world see
[21:01] me no more but he are going to see me
[21:04] and because I live he shall live also so
[21:07] this holy ghost that was wit in the form
[21:11] of the comforter in the form of the
[21:13] promised word named Jesus Hallelujah it
[21:17] was all the same that was the comforter
[21:20] in the form of promised word he said
[21:23] this promised word that you are hearing
[21:26] now is going to be in you Spirit form
[21:30] not many days hence but I got to do
[21:33] something I've got a price to pay I have
[21:37] a cost to pay that this Spirit could be
[21:39] released to you oh Hallelujah are you
[21:43] with me oh praise the name of the Lord
[21:47] hallelujah so he walked with these men
[21:49] men with snakes in their heart men with
[21:52] jealousy men with Envy men who was
[21:55] backing men who were fishermen ordinary
[21:58] men
[21:59] many who were smoking and drinking and
[22:01] he released to them promises that their
[22:04] faith couldn't hold yet he knew they
[22:06] didn't have what it takes but that
[22:08] didn't stop it Hallelujah because he
[22:10] knew they would come to it he even told
[22:12] Peter the devil want to sift it like
[22:14] wheat but I prayed for you that your
[22:17] faith fail not he knew they would
[22:20] stumble hlu he knew what they would for
[22:23] but it's not what was going to happen to
[22:25] them it's what God promised going to
[22:27] happen to them
[22:29] oh say Amen somebody he knew they have a
[22:31] rough time he knew they would struggle
[22:34] but he knew power was coming power was
[22:37] always coming it's just they didn't know
[22:41] it oh give the Lord some Praises people
[22:44] oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[22:47] glory to God power was always coming
[22:52] because God had a plan God have a goal
[22:55] just as you have set goals God have a
[22:58] goal also he wanted to reveal himself
[23:01] Hallelujah it was one of his goals he
[23:03] was just too
[23:04] mysterious Hallelujah he was just too
[23:09] mysterious so this mysterious God want
[23:12] doesn't want to come and make himself
[23:14] more mysterious no he want to reveal
[23:17] himself he want to reveal himself in
[23:19] Simplicity Hallelujah because he was so
[23:22] mysterious that we wouldn't catch it so
[23:25] the Elohim who was so mysterious
[23:28] projected himself in the form of the
[23:31] Loos which was the word which projected
[23:34] itself to become flesh to dwell Among Us
[23:38] that we could handle him that we could
[23:40] touch him that he could be one like us
[23:44] and the Bible said the word became
[23:51] flesh thank you Lord thank you Lord
[23:54] thank you Lord so I want you to notice
[23:56] God there could not be any in between
[23:59] Ministry between the ministry of Christ
[24:01] and these guys they us to wait their
[24:05] understanding how us to be open yes the
[24:07] word had to be open to them amen their
[24:09] faith had to be anointed amen and the
[24:12] evidence of that Faith being anointed is
[24:14] the quality of worship that enveloped
[24:18] them in the upper room Hallelujah
[24:20] because Abraham staggered not at the
[24:22] promise through unbelief that's right
[24:24] but his faith was strong in Praise
[24:27] giving glory to God am so I will know
[24:30] when Revelation strike you I know when
[24:33] Revelation really strike you you cannot
[24:35] sit in church dead because Revelation is
[24:39] when he has revealed himself to you not
[24:43] your mother tell you something in your
[24:45] ear not the Elder Whispers something not
[24:48] somebody text you something but Flesh
[24:50] and Blood have not reveal it unto you
[24:54] but my father had revealed iten
[25:02] amen hallelujah oh glory to God now
[25:05] listen carefully list this is very
[25:08] important you cannot
[25:10] determine who would have Christ
[25:15] Ministry by the pre Ministry of Jesus
[25:18] Christ all right you can't say this
[25:20] looking like it's I go identify it
[25:22] because if you look at Peter denying
[25:25] Christ he was the last man you might
[25:27] think to say this is that that the
[25:30] prophet Joel speak of so you cannot look
[25:34] at what you see because what you think
[25:38] is going to be it may not be and what
[25:41] you think is not going to be God may
[25:43] make it to be because if you look like
[25:46] Apostle Paul he was Saul before he was
[25:48] Paul and he was fighting the Revelation
[25:51] he was fighting the inspiration he was
[25:54] against the Revelation he was against
[25:56] the inspiration amen he was coming to
[25:59] persecute real Believers but that didn't
[26:02] fight God Amen that didn't give God a
[26:05] problem that didn't give God a fight no
[26:09] Paul was always God's
[26:13] man
[26:17] Hallelujah so if you're judging
[26:20] ministers and
[26:22] Ministries before the Fulfillment in
[26:25] other words if you get presumptuous you

[30:32] that do you understand to whom much is
[30:36] given much is
[30:38] expected do you understand that God is
[30:41] expecting great things out of this last

[30:53] expecting great things from

[31:05] know their God sir shall be strong
[31:08] Hallelujah and do great
[31:12] exploits not
[31:14] small exploits but great exploits this
[31:19] is not taught much because people feel
[31:20] they have arrived so they are settled
[31:23] and they contented to be where they are
[31:26] so my God God my God my God but we are
[31:30] promised yes sir to do great
[31:33] exploit and brother bham said that the
[31:36] conditions going to be so bad that
[31:37] Divine Healing will be a great
[31:39] thing things going to come on the earth
[31:42] that doctors can't even know what to do
[31:44] that's right you say brother brandham
[31:46] okay let me just Pi up up a little bit
[31:48] he said what he said now he said now one
[31:50] of these days the angel ped his rra
[31:52] disease broke out men rotted in their
[31:54] flesh where they were standing and the
[31:56] fowl of the air came and eat off the
[31:58] shoulders and eat the Flesh of the chief
[31:59] captains great man presidents Warriors
[32:01] diplomats but said don't come near
[32:03] anyone that got the Seal of God in their
[32:06] forehead he said one of these days
[32:08] Divine Healing is going to be a great
[32:10] thing among the church so let's get in
[32:12] condition you say well brother brandham
[32:14] you say let us that that's that was that
[32:17] that's what God is waiting on we are
[32:20] waiting on Jesus to return and Jesus is
[32:23] waiting on
[32:25] us hallelujah what
[32:28] can we do about it the Bible said the
[32:31] hour has come where his bride had made
[32:33] herself ready had made herself ready so
[32:36] remember you think cancer is something
[32:38] the Bible said there's coming a time
[32:40] when men will rot right in their flesh
[32:42] and the buzzers will eat off the
[32:44] carcasses before they even die cancer is
[32:46] a twoot take to what's coming but
[32:48] remember that horrible thing was
[32:50] forbidden in that day to touch those who
[32:52] at the Seal of God that's listen here we
[32:56] go that's what we are striving for now
[32:59] Hallelujah to get in and be positionally
[33:02] placed into the kingdom of God before
[33:05] these horrible plagues strike oh praise
[33:08] the name of the Lord you love him this
[33:10] morning then
[33:12] strive fight struggle press your way
[33:17] don't ever give up remind God of his
[33:20] promises remind God he promised to fill
[33:22] you with the Holy Ghost remind God his
[33:25] promised to you of power remind god of
[33:27] seventh the Revival remind God that you
[33:30] are his child you are his son you are
[33:32] his daughter you remind God you had a
[33:36] purpose he died for he didn't die for
[33:38] not he died for you oh glory to God Amen
[33:42] you may be seated huah so I guess I'll
[33:44] do a teaching this morning let's go amen
[33:48] this is from the five definite
[33:49] identification of the true church for
[33:52] the brown the word church on each one of
[33:54] these subjects I have chosen tonight uh
[33:57] one of it is what is the church who set
[34:00] it up what is its message how to become
[34:03] a member of it can we get to heaven
[34:06] without being a member of it the word
[34:09] church means called out they were the
[34:12] people of God in Egypt but when they
[34:13] were called out they become the Church
[34:16] of God so the church means the call out
[34:18] ones people that are separated made
[34:21] different so if God called you out the
[34:23] world and you still look like the world
[34:24] you're not called out you have to be
[34:26] called out separated ated look different
[34:29] be different act different therefore the
[34:32] church is not an organization that's
[34:34] right that's right the church is not a
[34:36] gathering of people the church is the
[34:39] people of God that's been called out of
[34:42] the world to serve in another
[34:44] kingdom so you're not called to serve
[34:46] this particular Church the real church
[34:50] is the
[34:52] kingdom of God how many you understand
[34:56] that Hal ujah and that Kingdom of a
[35:00] king the pastor is not the king the
[35:04] prophet is not the king the Apostle is
[35:07] not the king Hallelujah the king is the
[35:10] king that's how you get a kingdom
[35:13] because the king is over a domain and
[35:16] his Dominion is the kingdom over which
[35:19] he
[35:21] reigns am I songing clear to you out
[35:24] there
[35:26] okay so therefore for the church is
[35:29] called out of every denomination out of
[35:32] every religious organization to work
[35:33] with God you're called out not being
[35:35] governed by a bishop but being governed
[35:37] by Christ in this Messiah Kingdom amen
[35:40] and now if Christ is the head and we
[35:42] read that he's the head of the church he
[35:44] is the head of the church not a man from
[35:47] America not a man from Europe he is the
[35:49] head of the church isn't that right and
[35:51] the church is his body Oh Glory to God
[35:55] so in other words if he connects with
[35:56] the body he moves the body
[35:58] whe he said move the body going to move
[36:01] that's why he said Mark 16 says the Lord
[36:04] himself went everywhere with them why
[36:07] that was the body and he was the head
[36:11] come on now say Amen somebody how many
[36:14] understand that this morning the Lord
[36:17] himself went everywhere with them the
[36:20] reason being they were the body and he
[36:23] was the head wherever the head go the
[36:26] body was going to Oh Glory that was
[36:30] another book of Acts it wasn't the Acts
[36:33] of the Apostles it was the acts of the
[36:36] Holy Ghost in the
[36:42] apostles and Christ is the head Christ
[36:45] is the head of this Messiah Kingdom and
[36:48] you cannot organize a kingdom of which
[36:52] Christ is the head amen you cannot
[36:56] denominate a Kingdom which Christ is the
[37:00] head because Christ is King and you
[37:03] cannot take the intellectuals of man and
[37:06] make an organization to which Christ
[37:08] will govern Hallelujah
[37:10] therefore that's a backdrop yeah he's
[37:14] going therefore any
[37:16] companies any peoples any groups of men
[37:20] that tries to organize the kingdom of
[37:24] God is going contrary to the king amen
[37:28] and if they're going to contrary to the
[37:29] king it would be against the king and if
[37:32] it's against the king it would be
[37:35] Antichrist that's pretty rough and if I
[37:38] got a more voice I'll make it clear it's
[37:40] Antichrist and if you bear with me I'll
[37:42] prove that an antichrist Spirit tries to
[37:46] take a people and call them from
[37:49] organization to organization organize
[37:52] them together which never was the will
[37:55] of God people has always fusted me
[37:59] because I struck so hard at organization
[38:02] it isn't the people in it I'm striking
[38:04] at it's that dominating spirit that
[38:08] makes the people think that we are the
[38:14] people you see once that exclusive
[38:17] anointing comes that the people feel
[38:20] that they are it and we are it and they
[38:23] are not it and we are better than them
[38:26] that is the spirit that brother was
[38:32] bosted oh Hallelujah are you with me so
[38:37] God's people is his called out people
[38:39] and I believe they in every denomination
[38:41] they could be Catholic they could be
[38:43] Protestant they could be Jewish they
[38:46] could be any kind of a church but the
[38:48] real church is the mystical body of
[38:51] Jesus Christ and you cannot organize the
[38:54] mystical Body of Christ and every person
[38:57] that comes to Christ comes out of the
[38:59] world comes into Christ into this
[39:01] mystical body so when Christ
[39:04] died here we go he send back the Holy
[39:07] Spirit to make up the mystical Body of
[39:12] Christ that is why one day the last drop
[39:16] of the Holy Ghost will be
[39:18] finished Hallelujah because everyone
[39:20] that's supposed to make up that body
[39:22] will take up that body there'll be no
[39:24] more remaining Hallelujah and the bride
[39:27] will to be on the earth preaching to the
[39:29] Eternal lost people that once had the
[39:34] opportunity to be delivered repent and
[39:38] be saved they still have to hear the
[39:41] gospel in power yes which signs wonders
[39:45] and miracles amen this is not a beauty
[39:47] contest friends this is not who you like
[39:49] and who you don't like this is behold I
[39:52] send you prophets men Sons pastors
[39:57] prophet he going to send out his men his
[40:00] men not a man men not a chosen men not a
[40:04] minister Association men when God sent
[40:07] out his man that is God sending out his
[40:10] man and that's why Paul expressed this
[40:13] way Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by
[40:16] the will of
[40:22] God oh Hallelujah do you get what I'm
[40:26] saying in other words not by the
[40:29] presy not by the ministers Association
[40:32] not by the group no by the will of God
[40:38] hallelujah praise the name of the Lord
[40:40] watch is the so watch who set this
[40:43] church up Jesus Christ no Bishop no
[40:46] group of men no Pope no man-made Powers
[40:48] at all what is the message of the church
[40:50] the first church they will teach is
[40:51] repentance yes sir he say show me the
[40:54] church that teaching it now they don't
[40:56] want to hear but repent repent is like a
[40:58] sinful word like a curse don't don't
[41:00] even use that word repent people not
[41:02] repenting they don't want to repent of
[41:05] anything if Christ here we go if Christ
[41:09] would not let a bunch of men who walk
[41:12] with him for three and a half years go
[41:14] preach the gospel could not preach any
[41:17] gospel until they waited for the Holy
[41:20] Ghost yes sir the church today has to do
[41:25] the same thing amen wait for the Holy
[41:30] Ghost the church today have to do
[41:33] what now if you're waiting for the Holy
[41:35] Ghost how could you be the Holy
[41:38] Ghost because that is what being taught
[41:40] now and preached now that bride is the
[41:42] Holy Ghost the bride is the third person
[41:44] of the Trinity
[41:48] Trinity the bride is the holy ghost that
[41:50] doesn't he make
[41:54] sense oh my
[41:58] so brother brandham from Jehovah Gyra
[42:01] 1961 he said now he have to go to
[42:03] Genesis because Genesis is original it
[42:05] means the beginning is where you get
[42:07] where the church started off is where
[42:09] you get a true understanding of the true
[42:11] church and the false church because
[42:13] there are two churches always has always
[42:16] will have there are two Spirits there
[42:18] are two seeds so when you go and trace
[42:20] it he I'm going to go back to the church
[42:22] the true church and before we could
[42:23] start revelation we got to see where the
[42:25] church it where it began
[42:27] and we could go all the way to Cain and
[42:29] Abel and that is exactly the beginning
[42:32] Cain religious Abel religious Abel and
[42:34] Cain both being Brothers came to the
[42:36] altar east of the Eden gate they both
[42:38] worshiped they both make sacrifices they
[42:41] both build churches altars both worship
[42:43] if Building a Church making sacrifice
[42:45] paying your tis everything else even
[42:46] worshiping God is counted for
[42:48] righteousness then and sacrifices to
[42:51] build a church then that's all right
[42:52] that's religion but God refused King
[42:55] what did God refuse he he refuses altar
[42:57] his sacrifice his labor all of that God
[43:00] refused King so it has to be more than
[43:02] worshiping it has to be more than going
[43:04] to church it has to be more than having
[43:05] an altar it has to be more than making a
[43:07] sacrifice it has to be more than that
[43:09] because if if if that is the case God
[43:11] shall have accepted
[43:13] Cain but God rejected K and accepted
[43:16] Abel's revelation of the blood a bloody
[43:19] lamb that gel cut and blood was bleeding
[43:21] upon the Altar and the Bible said Abel
[43:24] by faith or AEL by revelation or Abel by
[43:28] inspiration or Abel without man telling
[43:30] Abel what to do Abel did the right thing
[43:33] and God confirmed by fire the Revelation
[43:38] that Abel
[43:39] had Oh Oh
[43:42] Glory note note let's flip it now and
[43:46] come to Matthew 1716 where we read about
[43:48] Jesus uh ask the disciples who do men
[43:50] say I am now they know men don't know
[43:53] who he is you know who do you say I am
[43:54] you walk with me for 3 years tell me who
[43:56] I am this didn't know but Peter said
[43:58] thou are the Christ then Jesus said
[44:00] these words Flesh and Blood ha not
[44:03] revealed it to you note the words
[44:05] revealed
[44:06] it but my father had revealed it and
[44:10] Upon This Rock Oh Glory I will build the
[44:14] true church my church his church Jesus
[44:18] church is the true church so the church
[44:20] is built on what
[44:22] Revelation oh give the Lord some Praises
[44:25] people
[44:28] the church is not built on a
[44:31] personality the church is not built on a
[44:33] pastor or a man or a real anointed
[44:36] preacher that's not what the church is
[44:38] built on the church is not built because
[44:39] we have 10,000 people that's not what
[44:41] the church the church is not built on
[44:44] Bibles the church is not even built on
[44:48] doctrines that's strong that's a strong
[44:50] one I'll say it again the church is not
[44:52] even buil on doctrines amen amen
[44:59] so you can know all Mysteries
[45:01] H and have all knowledge the church is
[45:04] not built on that the church is built
[45:07] sovereignly upon Revelation and
[45:10] Revelation is Sovereign he reveal it to
[45:12] whom soever he
[45:17] will that is why you can't write anybody
[45:21] off you can't write Saul off because
[45:25] Saul was going to be changed to Paul and
[45:28] Paul was going to be Apostle to the
[45:30] Gentiles you can't do
[45:34] that because when the time come for God
[45:38] to positionally place his sons no man
[45:41] can touch
[45:43] that Oh Glory no group on Earth can
[45:47] touch
[45:53] that oh my so being religious worshiping
[45:57] God isn't that right so watch so there
[46:00] is a way that God comes Hallelujah and
[46:03] that's here we go that's the only way
[46:06] you're ever going to get in there is to
[46:10] come the way God provided for you yes
[46:14] sir and the whole Bible is built
[46:17] completely upon Revelation the church is
[46:19] on Revelation the revelation of the word
[46:22] oh hallelujah praise the name of the
[46:24] Lord so the spiritual revelation of the
[46:26] the Lord Jesus Christ when God has made
[46:29] him known to you as a person as your
[46:33] savior as your God as your Redeemer as
[46:36] your healer as your king that's how
[46:38] spiritual Revelation come Hallelujah so
[46:41] therefore may I say that the Church of
[46:43] the Living God is built upon divine
[46:46] revelation not upon denomination
[46:49] organization upon Creeds or doctrines on
[46:52] spiritual Revelation so when somebody
[46:54] preach an inspiration or come with some
[46:56] new doctrine or new thinking or new
[46:58] thoughts and people just say that back
[47:00] because they believe what is said that's
[47:01] not Revelation that is you or anybody
[47:05] believing what they say and saying what
[47:07] they say that has nothing to do with
[47:09] Revelation because that's what Jesus
[47:12] asks his disciples who do men say I am
[47:15] and they say some say you are this some
[47:17] say you were that but that was not what
[47:19] he was talking about because people have
[47:21] a right to say anything Hallelujah they
[47:24] are men
[47:27] that's what men say but when the spirit
[47:31] Elohim revealed to Peter that that's the
[47:34] Christ that was not men saying that was
[47:37] God saying and that's why I told the
[47:39] Pastors in India you've got to hear from
[47:44] God that's what I told the Pastors in
[47:47] India I've got to hear from God I told
[47:49] the Pastors in India as if you have the
[47:50] wait for some man from Europe or America
[47:52] to come and tell all all the promises
[47:53] and say you are are lazy amen amen they
[47:56] just watch me and I watch them right
[47:57] back I said and Joshua have a rebuke for
[48:00] you who are lazy how long are you so
[48:03] slack to go and possess your land you're
[48:06] waiting for somebody to give you your
[48:07] land or God give you the courage to go
[48:09] and possess your land when a old man
[48:11] like Caleb said I was 40 years now I'm
[48:14] 80 something years old and I'm just as
[48:16] strong as when I started out give me my
[48:19] Mountain if the Lord be with me I will
[48:21] be able to drive out the enemy that's
[48:23] what Caleb said hallelujah praise God
[48:26] you have to come to that spot where you
[48:28] have to begin to possess your Mountain
[48:31] God want mature Sons why you think this
[48:33] God leave you for the last age for you
[48:35] to be babied and petted and wearing
[48:37] diapers and and wearing Pampers and
[48:39] whatnot when I was a child I spake like
[48:41] a child I understood like a child but
[48:42] God expect you to grow from baby to
[48:45] young man isn't that right praise God
[48:47] young man into father that God could
[48:49] give you further Revelations further

[49:41] Hallelujah and Isaac shared a powerful
[49:43] thing with me he said if the people see
[49:45] the promises everybody should be forming
[49:47] a beine TOS what is Promised am you know
[49:51] what a beline is a straight line going
[49:54] to something you ever see b or an making
[49:57] a line just make a line towards where
[49:59] they going in everybody falling in line
[50:01] it's food down that way we are going
[50:03] come on fellas and everybody form a
[50:06] straight line you could follow that and
[50:07] look at them look at them look at them
[50:09] look where they going and they pick up
[50:11] the food and they come back on that line
[50:13] and they keep using that line that's how
[50:15] we supposed to be with
[50:17] Dynamics we are forming a b line we are
[50:21] this way Brethren this way Dynamics is
[50:24] that way
[50:29] oh hallelujah hallelujah glory to God so
[50:33] when you see Brethren going wrong when
[50:36] you see nice fine men fine Brethren
[50:38] going contrary to what the prophet said
[50:40] it is a disturbance to your spirit
[50:43] because they are fine Brethren but they
[50:45] off the word plum off the
[50:52] word
[50:55] hall hallelujah
[50:58] so brother B said when a man come to the
[51:00] church there's two ways he going to go
[51:02] formal
[51:04] fanatic formal or some sometimes
[51:07] fanatical but there's a middle ground
[51:09] and the true church will stay on that
[51:11] middle ground oh praise the name of the
[51:13] Lord are you with me no but brandham he
[51:17] was uh dealing with the church ages and
[51:19] it was a very serious study and he said
[51:21] I sought God for many days for the
[51:23] inspiration of the Holy Spirit and God
[51:24] did not fail to answer my prayer for
[51:26] while I read the word and the histories
[51:28] I was enabled by the Holy Spirit to see
[51:31] unfolded a pattern that run through the
[51:34] centuries right to the present day so he
[51:37] was praying he was seeking God and God
[51:40] open up him a key and he get a pattern
[51:43] that he could view that was that time
[51:45] straight on the key given to me of the
[51:48] Lord whereby I was able to determine the
[51:51] messenger of each age is a most
[51:53] scriptural one in fact it might be
[51:56] called the Keystone of the Bible it is
[52:00] the Revelation that God never
[52:04] changes and his ways are unchangeable as
[52:07] he is oh that's beautiful that is
[52:11] beautiful it's a key that God never
[52:13] changes Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[52:16] today and forever Hebrews 138 here it is
[52:19] an unchanging God with unchanging ways
[52:24] what he did at the first he will have to
[52:27] keep on doing until it's the last
[52:30] time God cannot change God is not
[52:35] learning and getting a new inspiration
[52:38] to take something new look Pope Francis
[52:40] the other day he said God God not afraid
[52:42] of new
[52:44] things that that Pope Francis he want
[52:47] the Bishops to confirm homosexuality and
[52:49] and because they fully confirmed he say
[52:50] you know God not afraid of new things
[52:52] almost appear like they have God in the
[52:53] pocket that's right and they could you
[52:55] know I mean God you had to learn this
[52:56] now you know because this thing changing
[52:59] right now and America becoming Sodom and
[53:01] gomorra that's right and if God do
[53:04] condemn that he have to apologize to
[53:06] Sodom and Gomorrah so America every
[53:09] nation has to be corrupt in the core
[53:11] before judgment strikes and right now I
[53:14] think there about 32 of them uh sign off
[53:16] for this gay marriage and I always I
[53:18] keep saying I wonder if this the same
[53:20] thing coming to close the churches down
[53:22] that they will have to do it or else
[53:24] close down but but B side it will be
[53:27] closed down oh hallelujah what time that
[53:30] going to be where the church going to be
[53:32] when that time comes everything is on a
[53:35] Tinder Box right now it have the Ebola

[55:31] him glory to God a messenger on the
[55:34] earth Hallelujah Mighty Elijah Prophet
[55:38] according to Malachi 4 oh
[55:41] Hallelujah so this is brother brandham
[55:44] if any man shall take away from the
[55:45] words of the prophecy of book let me
[55:48] back up if any man shall add is a
[55:50] dangerous thing to add to say what the
[55:52] Bible didn't say If any man shall add
[55:55] these things go God shall add unto him
[55:57] the plagues that are written in this
[55:58] book and if any man shall take away from
[56:01] the words of the prophecy of this book
[56:03] God shall take away his part out of the
[56:05] book of life out of the holy city and
[56:08] from the team that are written in this
[56:09] book amen thus what the church was at
[56:12] Pentecost is the
[56:16] standard can I hear a big Amen on that
[56:19] what the church was so therefore I have
[56:21] no authority to watch any other church
[56:23] as the
[56:24] standard that's right
[56:27] as I said last week there is no man on
[56:29] Earth I'm talking about the whole planet
[56:31] the whole big circle with the ministry
[56:33] of Jesus Christ so I don't have to
[56:34] worship no other man because they don't
[56:36] have that Ministry and and God open up
[56:38] some more things to me coning the
[56:40] fivefold ministry the fivefold ministry
[56:42] not no takeover
[56:43] artists the F for not corporate Raiders
[56:47] right you know have corporate takeovers
[56:48] that's right hostile takeover somebody
[56:51] buy more shares and bounce the company
[56:52] out and vote out the CEO and wrestle and
[56:55] take a company that's not the purpose of
[56:57] the fivefold ministry I'm the fivefold
[57:00] ministry I come for your church is that
[57:02] right get out of here you know fivefold
[57:05] you are a false Apostle you a liar I'm
[57:08] going to expose you do you come with
[57:10] that
[57:13] foolishness oh hallelujah hallelujah
[57:17] glory to God Amen oh I'm going to teach
[57:20] you you going to learn you may be
[57:22] seated God already identified by the
[57:27] purpose of the F4 Ministry it is for the
[57:30] perfecting not the taking over of the
[57:33] Saints for the edifying not the breaking
[57:36] up of the Saints for the building not
[57:39] the destroying not the disunity not the
[57:42] breaking of Brotherhood that is not any
[57:46] fivefold that is no F at
[57:53] all glory
[57:57] Hallelujah so I'm so glad that God
[58:00] bringing some more clarity to me to
[58:04] understand how it will work because the
[58:06] fivefold ministry is Jesus in the form
[58:09] of five
[58:13] offices not five
[58:24] politicians so you may be see said amen
[58:27] so before before a man can say 5old he
[58:30] in it show me Jesus first that's
[58:34] right no Jesus no fivefold show me Jesus
[58:39] in your
[58:47] life are you with me oh Hallelujah so
[58:51] let's say it again what the church was
[58:53] at Pentecost is the standard sir that is
[58:58] the pattern there is no other pattern no
[59:03] other no other this is the pattern so
[59:08] once we on the word we have the
[59:13] pattern God gave bam the key he say a
[59:17] scriptural key it's a definite
[59:19] scriptural key God cannot
[59:23] change hallah Hallelujah
[59:28] Hallelujah may be
[59:30] seated Hallelujah no matter what the
[59:32] scholar say God has not changed that
[59:37] pattern amen what God did at Pentecost
[59:40] he has to keep on doing until the church
[59:42] age closes what the church had at
[59:45] Pentecost was an inable right originally
[59:49] she had the pure word she had the power
[59:50] of the spirit manifested with signs and
[59:52] wonders the original church here we go
[59:54] was not organized by by men amen it was
[59:57] led by the Holy Ghost it wasn't very big
[1:00:01] it was hated that's right and
[1:00:04] despised it was oppressed so if you are
[1:00:07] original Church to pattern after
[1:00:10] Pentecost you will be hated not loved no
[1:00:14] no no hated you know where to be hated
[1:00:16] who likes to be hated nobody likes to be
[1:00:18] hated you think I like to be blasting
[1:00:20] and busting no I don't like to do that
[1:00:22] it's a tough thing to do you think I
[1:00:25] want to be different from what everybody
[1:00:26] else is saying it's a tough thing to be
[1:00:29] different it's a tough thing to speak
[1:00:31] different the people follow 400 prophets
[1:00:35] that were saying the same thing and all
[1:00:37] 400 were wrong only Mah was right
[1:00:41] because my heard from God hallelujah you
[1:00:45] don't go by the multitude you go by the
[1:00:48] word of God you call by the spirit
[1:00:58] brother colan you might be seated
[1:01:00] brother keman was right he had a
[1:01:02] discernment of me he said but over stand
[1:01:05] alone if you have to that is very true I
[1:01:08] was built that way Hallelujah built to
[1:01:10] stand alone let me give you a little
[1:01:12] testimony I got baptized February 15th I
[1:01:15] believe
[1:01:16] 1975 I was 17 years of age coming to
[1:01:20] this message brother K was coming May of
[1:01:24] 1975 in between we there I had an
[1:01:27] encounter with the pillar of fire and
[1:01:29] that is why I am how I am I had an
[1:01:33] encounter with God and when I had that
[1:01:35] encounter it left an anointing in my
[1:01:37] soul in my spirit that used to Quicken
[1:01:40] the word from the books into me after
[1:01:44] that encounter the experience of reading
[1:01:47] the books was different I remember when
[1:01:49] I got who is this man I kissed the book
[1:01:52] my God the word was so precious you
[1:01:55] almost feel you could eat the book I
[1:01:57] kiss the book who is this mzc when I
[1:01:59] read about the mystery of God and before
[1:02:02] the foundation of the world and before
[1:02:04] there was a thought and before there was
[1:02:05] a moon and before there was a
[1:02:10] star that's why I am how I
[1:02:16] am you may be seated but I want to go
[1:02:19] down
[1:02:20] deeper that Spirit on me when I went and
[1:02:24] he had the services D shagas shagas when
[1:02:28] brother keman came there I didn't know
[1:02:30] who he was I didn't know his name I
[1:02:32] didn't know nothing about him I just
[1:02:33] went because the churches were going
[1:02:35] down to that and when I heard him preach
[1:02:38] the spirit in me bought record that what
[1:02:42] he spoke was the
[1:02:46] truth so no man could tell me what I
[1:02:50] believe or what I don't believe you have
[1:02:53] to be out of your mind
[1:02:55] I was 17 years old you may be
[1:03:01] seated February March April May four
[1:03:06] months in a message just four months and
[1:03:09] when he finished the pastor that I had I
[1:03:12] went to him I said are you going to
[1:03:15] preach what didn't remember any name
[1:03:17] what that man
[1:03:20] preach Pastor said he had to call Billy
[1:03:22] Paul I said what Billy Paul has do with
[1:03:23] this that man that man was quoting from
[1:03:25] Brother Brown are you going to preach
[1:03:27] what that man preached 17 talking to a
[1:03:30] pastor who he in the message he said no
[1:03:32] I said then I'm
[1:03:36] leaving I wonder how much 17 could do
[1:03:40] that pres
[1:03:42] now I was 17 when I walked out of a
[1:03:46] church within 5 months of being in the
[1:03:49] message because my spirit bear record
[1:03:51] what was spoken was the truth and I
[1:03:53] wanted to hear more about that because I
[1:03:56] was hearing about the bride how seven
[1:03:57] Thunders gathered the bride seven
[1:03:59] Thunders show the bride how to be and
[1:04:01] seven Thunder would gather the bride
[1:04:03] together and seven Thunders give the
[1:04:05] bride fate and wait till them seven
[1:04:07] tunders UT the voices of that group they
[1:04:09] going to slice and cut I was hearing

[1:04:37] hallelujah glory to God glory to God
[1:04:42] glory to God I am part of that that's
[1:04:45] why I have connected since
[1:04:48] 1975 and next year going to be 40 years
[1:04:52] so I will not take no crap from any
[1:04:54] Minister from any Pastor from any So-Cal
[1:04:57] present Apostle now anyone I wouldn't
[1:05:00] take any crap from any man on Earth I'm
[1:05:03] too long in this race oh give the Lord
[1:05:06] some Praises people oh glory to God

[1:05:13] potato you're going to burn your hand if
[1:05:15] you try to hold me oh give the Lord some
[1:05:18] Praises people don't touch me you could
[1:05:22] watch but don't you dare touch oh oh the
[1:05:26] spirit of God is upon me the spirit of
[1:05:30] God led me all these
[1:05:34] years and he still leading
[1:05:41] me who are you sit down
[1:05:44] man you you can pick you can pick up
[1:05:47] your
[1:05:49] pen hold your pen right there see I
[1:05:52] could tell you who I am I wonder who he
[1:05:54] is GL I'm I'm a local Elder doing the
[1:05:57] work of a pastor since 1982 for 39 years
[1:06:00] waiting to be positionally placed by my
[1:06:03] father that is who I
[1:06:07] am let's say it again go don't way you
[1:06:10] miss it I am a local
[1:06:12] Elder doing the work of a
[1:06:16] pastor waiting to be positionally placed
[1:06:21] by my father and that is in his hands
[1:06:32] the issue for me is not fivefold whether
[1:06:34] fivefold or not because even if I'm not
[1:06:36] in that Ministry and I don't want to say
[1:06:38] fivefold I want to say Ministry for the
[1:06:41] perfecting which is to pour the virtues
[1:06:45] into the people which cannot be done by
[1:06:50] Revelation it has to be done by
[1:06:52] experience the man have to have it yes
[1:06:56] to give it if he don't have it he can't
[1:06:59] give it and if you think I am up there
[1:07:02] and I know I am down here and I don't
[1:07:04] let you know I am down here then you
[1:07:06] will be deceived to think that I am up
[1:07:08] there and I'll be a
[1:07:20] fooler where was Peter before Pentecost
[1:07:24] up where
[1:07:26] he was at the same height with Mary Mary
[1:07:29] Magdalene all of them was at the same
[1:07:31] level needing
[1:07:33] Dynamics Peter couldn't tell Mary Mary
[1:07:36] I'm more spiritual than you you know who
[1:07:38] I am I preach three and a half years she
[1:07:40] will say but you didn't I Christ what
[1:07:42] you're talking
[1:07:43] about and she was right and he was right

[1:08:38] souls in prison I'm talking about Lord
[1:08:40] we have so much faults and mistakes and
[1:08:41] forgive us and cleanse us th souls in
[1:08:43] prison that 1965 and brother I'm still
[1:08:45] asking for Mercy we come to the Altar
[1:08:46] for Mercy for the grace of God we come
[1:08:48] to confess our faults our sins that's
[1:08:50] why we come to repent we come to ask God
[1:08:52] for his grace that's why we come for as
[1:08:54] Christians oh Hallelujah I said already
[1:08:56] somebody said a minister preaching talk
[1:08:58] about we always thought that God is up
[1:09:00] there and we down here no we up there
[1:09:01] too we are Gods that's sound good tell
[1:09:04] at Isaiah Isaiah 6 when Isaiah saw the
[1:09:07] Lord hand lifted up St fill the temple
[1:09:09] and I tell God God we I up there to you
[1:09:11] know go say where your ladder how you
[1:09:14] coming up here Saras all around burners
[1:09:17] you can't come with that foolishness you
[1:09:19] have to confess who is me I'm undone and
[1:09:22] then the cleansers come you can't even
[1:09:24] go out with that we have no ladder to
[1:09:26] climb up God but tell a man God to take
[1:09:29] God to put a man in position up there
[1:09:31] you could climb in the humanistic realm
[1:09:33] wherever you want to climb you could
[1:09:34] climb in the intellectual realm wherever
[1:09:36] you want to climb but in that Spirit
[1:09:38] realm to be positionally placed it will
[1:09:40] take God to put a man up there and if
[1:09:43] God put a man up there no man could take
[1:09:45] that man up there you could lie you
[1:09:46] could criticize you could say what you
[1:09:48] want but I know who I am and I know
[1:09:51] whose I am and I know what God called me
[1:09:54] to do and I will do exactly what God
[1:09:57] called me to
[1:09:59] do oh hallelujah praise God oh glory to
[1:10:04] God Amen so when I wake up in the
[1:10:07] morning I wake up with that sense of
[1:10:08] purpose I wake up with a sense of
[1:10:11] determination that the purpose of God
[1:10:12] for my life will be
[1:10:14] fulfilled oh praise God so are you with
[1:10:17] me now so brother BR the true church
[1:10:20] would always try to be like the original
[1:10:22] at Pentecost the true church of today
[1:10:24] will try to approximate like the first
[1:10:26] one and The Messengers to the churches
[1:10:29] having the same spirit of God in them
[1:10:31] will try to approximate the Apostle Paul
[1:10:33] Hallelujah they won't be exactly like
[1:10:35] him but the true Messengers will be the
[1:10:37] ones that come closest to Paul who was
[1:10:40] here we go here here Paul credentials
[1:10:44] closest to Paul who was I call it one
[1:10:46] free from all men amen
[1:10:50] hallelujah so he's not obligated to ask
[1:10:52] brother this should I preach this should
[1:10:53] I go here should I go here here should I
[1:10:55] do this here should I open my church
[1:10:57] down here should I go and fast and pray
[1:10:59] do you think I should hold a convention
[1:11:01] no he was free from all men two he was
[1:11:05] sold out to God sold
[1:11:08] out sold out to God three watch he give
[1:11:12] for the word of God
[1:11:15] only and four he manifested the Holy
[1:11:19] Ghost in
[1:11:21] power that is what we have not seen yet
[1:11:25] that manifestation of the Holy Ghost in
[1:11:27] power isn't that right so bam said now
[1:11:30] with this key so simple so wonderful I
[1:11:33] was able by the help of the Holy Spirit
[1:11:35] to read the book Revelation and the
[1:11:36] histories and thereby in each age each
[1:11:39] messenger the duration of each age the
[1:11:41] part each played the purpose of God from
[1:11:43] Pentecost to the consummation of the
[1:11:45] ages since you now understand how we
[1:11:49] judge what the true church was like and
[1:11:53] what she was at Pentecost and what she
[1:11:55] was in the apostolic age are set forth
[1:11:57] in the word of God the book of Acts we
[1:11:59] can apply the same rule here we go to
[1:12:02] show how the church failed hallelujah
[1:12:04] amen the basic error or errors that
[1:12:07] crept into the first church and were
[1:12:09] revealed in the book of Acts and
[1:12:11] Revelation and also in the Epistles will
[1:12:13] become more and more visibly manifested
[1:12:16] in each in sub subsequent age yes the
[1:12:20] true church will always try to be like
[1:12:22] it was in the book of
[1:12:24] Acts aha we stri some book of Acts you
[1:12:27] know what happened in the book of Acts
[1:12:29] the Holy Spirit told Peter go to the
[1:12:31] house called Cornelius Peter didn't dial
[1:12:33] up the ministry's council the sing
[1:12:36] Council or the local Elders or the local
[1:12:39] ministers Association of God every month
[1:12:41] he didn't call them because they might
[1:12:43] have said you know it's not time to move
[1:12:45] that way you know Peter because there's
[1:12:47] Jews you know and um and you know Jesus
[1:12:50] really come to the Jews this his own
[1:12:52] their own people so we don't feel that
[1:12:54] um that's a way to go because uh the
[1:12:58] head of the council it doesn't feel led
[1:13:01] you should go because we wouldn't be
[1:13:02] sending you
[1:13:05] out Jesus Peter was free from all man so
[1:13:09] when when when when when Peter was told
[1:13:11] to go to the house of Cornelius God drop
[1:13:13] a vision God gave Cornelius a vision it
[1:13:16] was all the operation of God and you
[1:13:18] know what happened why Peter yet SP
[1:13:20] these word and then Peter understand
[1:13:23] that the spirit is not moving over to
[1:13:25] the Gentiles how the Gentiles who was
[1:13:29] the outcast people we didn't expect to
[1:13:31] come in this revival praise God was now
[1:13:34] getting the Revival people that we
[1:13:37] didn't expect to get fire now getting
[1:13:39] the fire the spirit in the bright say
[1:13:42] come whosoever will
[1:13:50] come
[1:13:51] hallu
[1:13:53] church now when did the CS come son of
[1:13:56] man reveal himself give them promises
[1:13:58] son of man come and die at Calvary isn't
[1:14:00] that right rose from the dead appear
[1:14:02] unto them I know I keep repeating but
[1:14:04] you have to get it appeared on them open
[1:14:06] your understanding isn't that right open
[1:14:07] up the word to them send them in the
[1:14:09] upper room and then what they wrote a
[1:14:11] book of Acts it wasn't the acts of the
[1:14:13] minister Association it wasn't Act of a
[1:14:15] group and a leader of the inspiration
[1:14:17] and the and and a man leading in the
[1:14:19] book of Acts who the leader the book of
[1:14:21] Acts philli was in a Revival B say
[1:14:24] Philip was in a big meeting and the
[1:14:26] spirit caught him
[1:14:28] up caught him up and take him to
[1:14:31] Ethiopian Uno on his way reading
[1:14:34] scriptures amen and Philip walked up to
[1:14:37] the man and said you understand what
[1:14:39] you're reading my god do you understand
[1:14:43] the spirit sent him there he didn't have
[1:14:45] to ask permission if to go if to go it
[1:14:50] was another book of Acts it was the acts
[1:14:53] of the Holy Ghost
[1:14:55] in these
[1:14:59] men that was the book of
[1:15:02] Acts know what the true church will
[1:15:04] always try to be like it was in the book
[1:15:06] of Acts that is exactly right we have
[1:15:09] discovered that the word also teaches
[1:15:11] watch an invasion of error until there's
[1:15:14] a complete back out of Truth when the
[1:15:16] last thing when the Lord is about to
[1:15:17] appear the question now arises in our
[1:15:20] minds and is important how this is
[1:15:23] phrased does God
[1:15:25] forsake his own and let them fall into a
[1:15:29] state of complete deception I I like how
[1:15:32] he pH it complete deception in other
[1:15:34] words the elect could get a little tired
[1:15:36] but not complete in other words God will
[1:15:39] not let the elect watch go in a state of
[1:15:42] complete deception on no account for the
[1:15:44] scripture says clearly in Matthew 24 the
[1:15:47] elect cannot be deceived but there shall
[1:15:50] arise false christs and false prophets
[1:15:52] that shall show signs and wonders if it
[1:15:54] were possible they shall deceive the
[1:15:56] very elect what then the answer is clear
[1:15:59] before us there's a true church and a
[1:16:02] false Church there's a True Vine and a
[1:16:05] false Vine of course the false Church
[1:16:08] false Vine body will always try to ur
[1:16:11] the position of the true church and
[1:16:13] contend that she and not the elect are
[1:16:16] the real and authentic the false will
[1:16:19] try to kill the true never the other way
[1:16:22] you will never find the true trying to
[1:16:24] kill the false you will always try the
[1:16:26] false trying to kill the true always
[1:16:29] that's a permanent Behavior kill kill
[1:16:31] kill kill kill Hallelujah that's what
[1:16:34] the false will do that is how it was in
[1:16:36] the book of Acts and that is how it set
[1:16:38] forth in all ages Paul founded the
[1:16:41] church in Ephesus about the middle of
[1:16:42] the first century and this uh enables us
[1:16:45] to see the date of the first church age
[1:16:47] 53 ad the very name Ephesus have a
[1:16:51] strange compound meaning aen at relaxed
[1:16:54] the aspiration of this age had begun
[1:16:56] with the fullness of the spirit the
[1:16:58] depth of God whereby they were aiming at
[1:17:00] a high calling of God began to give way
[1:17:02] to a less watchful attitude a less
[1:17:05] Ardent following of Jesus Christ begin
[1:17:06] to manifest itself as an omen that in
[1:17:09] the future ages the physical vehicle
[1:17:12] called The Church listen of God would
[1:17:15] sink to the awfulness of the depth of
[1:17:18] Satan it had become relaxed and was
[1:17:21] drifting the age was backsliding it had
[1:17:24] left its first love the tiny seed
[1:17:27] planted in the Ephesians age would one
[1:17:29] day grow in the spirit of
[1:17:32] error until the fowls of the air would
[1:17:35] Roost in his branches so inoffensive to
[1:17:39] human reasoning what that little plant
[1:17:42] appear that the new EVE the new church
[1:17:44] that again she would be deceived by
[1:17:46] Satan the Ephesians age had presented to
[1:17:50] her the opportunity for God's best and
[1:17:53] for a while she prevailed and then
[1:17:55] relaxed and in that unguarded moment
[1:17:58] Satan planted the seed of complete
[1:18:02] ruination so when God wants to restore
[1:18:04] he plants a seed when Satan want to
[1:18:07] destroy he plants a seed both our seeds
[1:18:12] planted that is why false Doctrine is
[1:18:14] worse than
[1:18:19] adultery that's
[1:18:21] right false Doctrine worse than that it
[1:18:24] L an unclean living because he
[1:18:26] introduced a seed that is contrary to
[1:18:29] the principles and the doctrines of the
[1:18:31] scriptures amen hallelujah so watch his
[1:18:35] manner of ministering talking about Paul
[1:18:37] set the pattern that all future
[1:18:40] Messengers were to Aspire to and
[1:18:42] actually sets the pattern for every true
[1:18:45] minister of God Amen Paul was the
[1:18:49] pattern for every messenger and for
[1:18:51] every true minister of God will follow
[1:18:53] Paul's pattern
[1:18:55] though he would not attain the such
[1:18:56] Heights in the prophetic realm as did
[1:18:58] Paul Paul had a three-fold quality first
[1:19:01] he was true to the word he never
[1:19:03] deviated from the word listen to the
[1:19:05] scripture Galatians 1: 18:9 though we or
[1:19:08] an angel from heaven preach any other
[1:19:10] gospel unto you that that which we have
[1:19:12] preached let him be a curse what is Paul
[1:19:15] saying here he's not saying if an angel
[1:19:17] come down you now he say if I come back
[1:19:21] and preach a different gospel than what
[1:19:23] I originally give you sign me off
[1:19:27] too that's how complete it was in what
[1:19:30] was delivered he said if we or a angel
[1:19:34] he put himself inside of there if I come
[1:19:37] back and deviate from what I originally
[1:19:39] said let me be a
[1:19:41] cursed that's how sure the gospel is
[1:19:45] that's how sure the word is don't
[1:19:48] compromise with
[1:19:52] it and brother Joy show me a beautiful
[1:19:55] there was a sister you know I guess she
[1:19:56] was well off and she used to write out
[1:19:58] checks for brother brandham for for the
[1:19:59] meetings if the meetings fall short she
[1:20:00] used to cover the checks and so on and
[1:20:02] day she came to see brother brandham and
[1:20:03] said brother brandham the ministers
[1:20:05] would like to you know open up and thing
[1:20:06] to you more and whatnot if you only
[1:20:08] compromise on water baptism in Jesus
[1:20:10] name and there woman right now check
[1:20:14] this is Brother BR but say sister if I
[1:20:16] compromise on the word then I'll no
[1:20:18] longer be a servant of
[1:20:22] Christ so then she comes with another
[1:20:25] she said will the minister say if you
[1:20:27] say the angel of the Lord tell you to
[1:20:32] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:20:33] something like that then they will
[1:20:35] believe it he say but they experienced
[1:20:37] tner than Branch
[1:20:40] water he said if them need that
[1:20:43] experience T and Branch water he said if
[1:20:45] the angel tell me something contrary to
[1:20:47] what the scripture say I wouldn't
[1:20:48] believe the
[1:20:52] angel what what is he saying he is
[1:20:54] saying you cannot put any manifestation
[1:20:56] above the
[1:20:57] word I'm not hearing you I am saying the
[1:21:01] word is first the angel can come with
[1:21:03] sweat back Wing tall colorful rainbow
[1:21:07] whatever it is is that angel speaking
[1:21:09] the word if that angel not speaking
[1:21:11] about let him take his wings his rainbow
[1:21:14] take whatever he has and take it back
[1:21:16] with
[1:21:18] him the word is God God is the word Give
[1:21:23] the Lord a sh I
[1:21:26] pray God first word
[1:21:32] first
[1:21:33] hallelujah
[1:21:36] hallelujah then Paul said again as we
[1:21:38] said before so now I again if any man
[1:21:42] preach any other gospel unto you than
[1:21:46] what you have received let him be a
[1:21:49] curse you can't bring a new gospel it
[1:21:51] too late for that it is too late for
[1:21:53] that we had 40 Years of the ministry of
[1:21:56] the word and it has not done what it
[1:21:59] should have done or could have done why
[1:22:01] God had it to be so I'm going to give a
[1:22:03] bum the ministry of the word come like
[1:22:05] the ministry of
[1:22:08] Moses It could only bring the people up
[1:22:10] to the promised
[1:22:12] land Hallelujah some ministers might
[1:22:15] dispute that with me the ministry of the
[1:22:17] word was like the ministry of Jesus
[1:22:19] could only bring them up to Pentecost
[1:22:21] reing the Holy Ghost but Joshua
[1:22:26] glory to God
[1:22:28] Joshua he represent another dispensation
[1:22:32] another phase from the ministry of the
[1:22:34] word to the ministry of the spirit so
[1:22:37] Christ only brought them up to the land
[1:22:39] but the Holy Ghost have to come down to
[1:22:41] take them into the land to possess the
[1:22:44] very land
[1:22:49] itself oh
[1:22:52] Hallelujah are you with me now
[1:22:55] you may be seated so Moses brought them
[1:22:57] up to the land but then Joshua took them
[1:22:59] over every place you put your foot is
[1:23:02] your Moses couldn't do that Moses
[1:23:05] Ministry couldn't do that but now with
[1:23:08] the ministry of the spirit you will have
[1:23:10] the authority you don't have the power
[1:23:13] because he said go you alter
[1:23:15] well and preach the gospel these signs
[1:23:20] shall follow them that believe
[1:23:27] hallelujah
[1:23:29] hallelujah wait a minute you may be
[1:23:31] seated wait a minute are you preaching
[1:23:34] signs to follow the Believers yes yes
[1:23:38] I'm preaching s Mark 16 the Lord himself
[1:23:42] will go with you you going to lay hands
[1:23:45] on the second and they shall recover you
[1:23:48] shall cast the demons
[1:23:52] out you believe that
[1:23:55] yeah yeah yeah I believe that I am
[1:23:57] preaching that we going to have that oh
[1:24:01] Hallelujah that's a sign of the true
[1:24:04] church Mark 16 in
[1:24:17] action
[1:24:19] Glory
[1:24:21] Hallelujah Hallelujah hallah Galatians
[1:24:26] two amen this is Paul amen and when
[1:24:29] Peter was came to Antioch I with stood
[1:24:32] him to the face because he was to be
[1:24:35] blamed Peter couldn't say no mistakes
[1:24:37] were made Paul said he was to be blamed
[1:24:40] and when I saw that they walked not
[1:24:44] uprightly according to the truth of the
[1:24:47] Gospel I said unto Peter before them all
[1:24:51] if thou being a Jew live after the man
[1:24:54] of the Gentiles and not do as the Jews
[1:24:57] why compel us the Gentiles to live as
[1:24:58] the Jews he busted Peter in front of
[1:25:01] them all Paul was
[1:25:04] uncompromising it was a life that had to
[1:25:06] be lived and Peter was living off the
[1:25:11] balance so Paul had to correct Peter and
[1:25:14] guess what Peter humbl himself because
[1:25:17] if a spirit is rebuked or corrected and
[1:25:20] not humble the word in you would humble
[1:25:22] because the word is God
[1:25:31] what if Peter said Paul you can't talk
[1:25:32] to me like
[1:25:34] that you should have talk to me
[1:25:36] privately and besides that I had the key
[1:25:38] to the
[1:25:39] kingdom Jesus Jesus told me to speak
[1:25:41] into day of
[1:25:45] Pentecost I didn't like that too much
[1:25:48] you going to call me aside no Paul
[1:25:50] rebuked Peter in front of them all let
[1:25:52] me read it again and when Peter was come
[1:25:55] to Antioch Paul waited for
[1:26:01] himall Paul was adopted and Peter was
[1:26:03] adopted these are man of
[1:26:06] godall not serpent seed and good one and
[1:26:09] good seed and Bad Seed these a man of
[1:26:12] God when Peter was coming Antioch I with
[1:26:15] stod him to the face now these days they
[1:26:17] don't even want to see your face the
[1:26:19] shooing behind your back
[1:26:24] I like to see people eyeball Hallelujah
[1:26:27] yeah yeah yeah I am a face to face man
[1:26:29] that's the kind of man I am Hallelujah
[1:26:32] that's why whatever I say like somebody
[1:26:34] some Minister want to find out what else
[1:26:36] but saying when he's not on the
[1:26:37] pulpit when he's overseas they could
[1:26:41] hear me and my messages but they want to
[1:26:43] know what else I'm saying behind the
[1:26:44] scenes but I don't say behind the scen
[1:26:46] that I can't see openly all right that's
[1:26:48] how I always am I would say whatever I
[1:26:51] say I could say on the on on the
[1:26:52] platform on the on on on the roof I
[1:26:56] don't like a time I spoke to a brother
[1:26:58] here I say if you leave this church
[1:27:00] every word I spoke to you still stands
[1:27:03] there was nobody could leave their CH
[1:27:04] and say um and I and I am saying I
[1:27:06] should not tell them this I should not
[1:27:07] tell them that no no no no everything I
[1:27:10] say I wanted to say I have said and I'm
[1:27:14] not taking back because I was speaking
[1:27:16] the truth and I believe in my heart if I
[1:27:19] cannot tell you the truth I cannot
[1:27:21] really be faithful to God
[1:27:24] honest if I can't be honest with you how
[1:27:26] could I be honest with God I am supposed
[1:27:28] to tell you the truth I'm supposed to
[1:27:30] commend myself to your conscience Amen

[1:32:52] true church amen
[1:32:55] under God by the spirit amen no brother
[1:32:59] Bram
[1:33:04] wow
[1:33:07] Hallelujah notice Paul was unorganized
[1:33:10] but Spirit Led and when God move upon
[1:33:12] Moses to lead Israel out of Egypt jwm
[1:33:15] Council never sent Paul out nor did any
[1:33:17] power or jurisdiction over him God and
[1:33:22] God Alone did the leading and the
[1:33:23] ascending and Paul in Galatians 1 said
[1:33:26] Paul an apostle not of men neither by
[1:33:29] man but by Jesus Christ and God the
[1:33:31] Father who raised him from the dead amen
[1:33:34] oh hallelujah praise the name of the
[1:33:37] Lord and Paul had power acts 148 to 10
[1:33:40] and there was certain man at listra
[1:33:41] importent in his feet watch Paul being
[1:33:44] crippled from his mother's womb amen so
[1:33:46] this is a no makeup case this is
[1:33:49] crippled from mother's womb who never
[1:33:51] had
[1:33:52] walked there same heard Paul speak who
[1:33:55] steadfastly beholding him watch and
[1:33:57] perceive he had fear to be healed said
[1:33:59] with a l voice stand upright on thy feet
[1:34:01] and he leaped and walked hallu
[1:34:04] Hallelujah that was Paul in power the
[1:34:08] gospel being demonstrated in power
[1:34:11] Hallelujah truly the signs of the
[1:34:13] apostle was wrought without patience and
[1:34:15] mighty Deeds isn't that right praise the
[1:34:18] name of the Lord and then Paul even said
[1:34:19] I preach the gospel in power and
[1:34:21] demonstration he the reason that your
[1:34:23] faith will not rest in the wisdom of man
[1:34:25] but in the power of God he wanted it not
[1:34:28] to be resting on the personality of Paul
[1:34:30] that could bring all these Mighty
[1:34:32] Revelations but he wanted their faith to
[1:34:34] rest on the power of God to reveal and
[1:34:36] to unfold the word so your faith is not
[1:34:39] on man personality man's ministry that's
[1:34:42] not what it is your faith have to be in
[1:34:45] God able to anoint and appoint able to
[1:34:47] inspire able to speak by direct
[1:34:50] inspiration Hallelujah that's where your
[1:34:52] faith after the rest
[1:34:54] isn't that right oh are you could you
[1:34:56] take some more all right but brandham he
[1:34:59] said let me show you another reason why
[1:35:01] Satan hates This Book of Revelation of
[1:35:03] Jesus Christ in the church he knows that
[1:35:05] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today
[1:35:07] and forever he changes not he knows a
[1:35:09] whole lot more than do 90% of the
[1:35:11] theologians he knows that since God is
[1:35:13] immutable in his nature then he's
[1:35:15] immutable in his ways meaning unchanging
[1:35:17] in his nature he's also unchanging in
[1:35:19] his ways watch watch he knows that since
[1:35:22] God right does here we go Satan knows
[1:35:25] assuredly that the original church at
[1:35:28] Pentecost with the power of God Mark 16
[1:35:33] in action not
[1:35:37] talking
[1:35:38] Mark
[1:35:40] 16 in action is the true church that
[1:35:45] Jesus claims as his own all else is
[1:35:48] false it has to be amen watch now
[1:35:51] remember this Christ in the true church
[1:35:54] ah is a continuation of the book of Acts
[1:35:58] now I just shared with you what the book
[1:36:00] of Acts was like Christ in the true
[1:36:02] church is a continuation of the book of
[1:36:05] Acts but the Book of Revelation shows
[1:36:07] how the Antichrist Spirit would come
[1:36:10] into the church and defile it making it
[1:36:12] lukewarm formal Hallelujah powerless
[1:36:16] amen it exposes Satan revealing his
[1:36:18] Works attempted destruction of God's
[1:36:20] people and the discrediting of God's
[1:36:22] word write down to the time he's cast
[1:36:24] into the Lake of Fire he fights that he
[1:36:27] cannot stand that now here we go he
[1:36:29] knows the devil knows if the people get
[1:36:33] a true
[1:36:35] revelation of the true church what she
[1:36:39] is what she stands for and that she can
[1:36:43] do the Greater Works she will be an
[1:36:45] invincible Army hallelujah hallelujah
[1:36:50] and that's what we identifying this
[1:36:51] morning what the churches is and we
[1:36:54] identifying it by prophecy because this
[1:36:57] is yet to come because the church must
[1:37:01] be rebuilt in the power of the
[1:37:05] spirit the preachers don't want to
[1:37:07] preach that hallu Hallelujah but Bram
[1:37:11] said that the message of Grace the
[1:37:13] church has to be rebuilt in the power of
[1:37:17] the spirit the church have been built by
[1:37:20] word but it has to be rebuilt there's
[1:37:22] going to come some Rebuilders not by
[1:37:25] might not by power The Headstone coming
[1:37:28] and The Headstone coming with shoutings
[1:37:31] not by might not by power but by my
[1:37:34] spirit so the spirit going to fall and
[1:37:37] the church going to be rebuilt Oh Glory
[1:37:40] to God I can see them screaming
[1:37:42] hallelujah hallelujah the Sheep of God
[1:37:44] will come screaming out that David
[1:37:48] Ministry going to come on the same it's
[1:37:50] going to be Christ in the bride another
[1:37:54] book of Acts the spirit anointing the
[1:37:56] bride giving the bride a voice the
[1:37:59] spirit and the bride when say come the
[1:38:02] pride will have a Ministry The Pride
[1:38:04] will have a voice The Pride will become
[1:38:06] the word the anointing going to strike
[1:38:08] the prde the bride will take up the book
[1:38:11] the spirit of God is upon me for he had
[1:38:13] anointed Me Oh Glory to God there'll be
[1:38:18] one more ride the world will hear direct
[1:38:22] from God
[1:38:26] oh
[1:38:28] hallelujah
[1:38:30] hallelujah oh give the Lord a shout the
[1:38:34] world will yet direct from
[1:38:40] God glory you will be seated Hallelujah
[1:38:44] so she so the people this is the people
[1:38:48] why the people must get a true
[1:38:49] Revelation because only the people amen
[1:38:52] will bring a Revival Hallelujah if all
[1:38:54] these big anointed teachers some of them
[1:38:56] gurus I know you have one train
[1:38:59] everybody look up to him a guru all the
[1:39:02] miss the
[1:39:03] turban have the people lives in their
[1:39:05] hands everybody he is the man he have
[1:39:07] all the F in them all five he's a onean
[1:39:11] fivefold oh my God so short of men he he
[1:39:15] just put everything in one man and the
[1:39:17] people people believe that in all planet
[1:39:19] Earth God so hand so short he just take
[1:39:22] one man and put all five inside of him I
[1:39:24] say hold that I I it blows your mind but
[1:39:28] what I'm saying is this the people have
[1:39:30] to get a revelation you see you have to
[1:39:32] become to know who you are listen
[1:39:34] without you there's no Revival because
[1:39:37] the people have to bring Revival if the
[1:39:39] ministers could have bring it why we
[1:39:40] don't have it
[1:39:44] yet oh this is good this is good it can
[1:39:49] only get better so watch if the people
[1:39:51] are manhandled if the people are
[1:39:53] mistreated how could they bring the
[1:39:54] Revival I know some Churches beat the
[1:39:56] people in subjection Beat the people in
[1:39:58] order some people love to be
[1:40:01] beaten because they can't discipline
[1:40:02] theel and they hoping somebody
[1:40:04] disciplined them I remember a brother
[1:40:05] came from my next Church to church he
[1:40:07] say he finally not rebuking him I said
[1:40:09] not rebuking for the wrong things you're
[1:40:10] doing I said I supposed to rebuke you
[1:40:12] for the wrong thing you're doing so you
[1:40:13] you you know your wrong thing you're
[1:40:15] doing but that's what they want some big
[1:40:18] stick preacher and I pledged to God when
[1:40:21] we had 12 people not to rule his people
[1:40:23] people with rigor with Force I pled to
[1:40:25] God I even went on an extreme with that
[1:40:27] leaving them alone and stuff just commit
[1:40:28] them to God I purpos to God I saw how
[1:40:30] ministers handle preach people with
[1:40:32] legalism how they enter their lives who
[1:40:34] to marry who not to marry to do this and
[1:40:36] that what car to buy what car not to buy
[1:40:38] all kind of stuff and I see was wrong
[1:40:41] just and I pledged that to God and by
[1:40:43] the grace of God I kept my
[1:40:47] pledge yeah by the grace of God I kept
[1:40:50] that pledge because see I see you as
[1:40:52] God's people
[1:40:54] I am not the important one you are
[1:40:57] that's why Jesus died to get
[1:41:01] you this fold thing is overblown because
[1:41:04] the five bringing final touches to the
[1:41:06] bride it'll be the ministry of Christ to
[1:41:08] edify to build up so I told a brother I
[1:41:10] said if a 5old minister you get a tape
[1:41:11] from a 5old minister or you play a
[1:41:14] message it will edify your church it
[1:41:15] will build up your church it will
[1:41:17] strengthen your church it doesn't mean
[1:41:18] that fightful man in charge of your
[1:41:20] church it doesn't mean fightful coming
[1:41:21] to take over your church it have a
[1:41:23] Ministry is Christ Ministry and they
[1:41:25] will be speaking the truth in love not
[1:41:27] just speaking lovely the truth the truth
[1:41:29] will come out of the inward Parts you
[1:41:30] see I share this with you I don't know
[1:41:33] how many you recall but the Joseph kman
[1:41:35] speaking about he want to get Joseph
[1:41:37] rainbow coat how many remember that he's
[1:41:39] looking for Joseph rainbow coat
[1:41:41] manifestation and so on I want to kind
[1:41:43] of break that down a little bit if I
[1:41:45] could do that in that kind of a way you
[1:41:46] don't wear a quot
[1:41:51] inside Hallelujah where do you wear code
[1:41:55] outside what is he saying seven Living
[1:41:57] Voices Joseph frow code what is he
[1:42:00] saying I want that on the outside you
[1:42:04] hear him testify this is what brother
[1:42:05] brandham had when you come up to brother
[1:42:07] brandham something sto you about 6t from
[1:42:10] Brother
[1:42:13] BR do you do you understand that now in
[1:42:16] other words that's the token on display
[1:42:20] Hallelujah that's the voices on display
[1:42:24] that is not the inside man that is what
[1:42:26] on the inside is now on the
[1:42:31] outside how many could shout on that
[1:42:38] one in other words the people know is
[1:42:41] Jesus the feeling Jesus The Experience
[1:42:45] around you Jesus when you talk to them
[1:42:47] it's Jesus it's Jesus on two
[1:42:51] feet ah
[1:42:54] listen to what the prophet said the
[1:42:56] ministry reach its Perfection when
[1:42:59] Christ is reproduced in the natural
[1:43:03] among human
[1:43:06] beings that has nothing to do with
[1:43:08] teaching
[1:43:09] mysteres that have nothing to do with
[1:43:11] knowledge that have to do with Christ
[1:43:14] and his love and his life butam got a re
[1:43:18] of Brotherly kindness he was tested on
[1:43:20] it two people come making love in church
[1:43:22] God give him options 1 2 3 you could say
[1:43:24] if you die they died you say blind they
[1:43:26] blind and all those were scriptural
[1:43:27] things somebody got blind under Paul
[1:43:30] somebody died and as Z fire died under
[1:43:32] Peter all those things were scriptural
[1:43:34] it wasn't that God G him unscriptural
[1:43:35] choices all were scripture and he said
[1:43:37] none of the above he choose himself to
[1:43:40] say I forgive you he say why because he
[1:43:42] did thing wrong too he had that Mercy he
[1:43:45] had that compassion it was Christ Living
[1:43:47] out
[1:43:51] something so so you could see how God
[1:43:54] going to release his PO
[1:43:56] sply because he have to do with hearts
[1:43:59] and
[1:44:00] men and men desires and lust so if a man
[1:44:04] have a wrong lust for power to wheel and
[1:44:06] say I am it I am somebody or my church
[1:44:09] is somebody God can't release power to
[1:44:11] that man he got to mess things up like
[1:44:13] how they messes up over the ages so in
[1:44:15] this age of maturity Christian maturity
[1:44:19] when the life is required not so much
[1:44:21] the meat the teaching the mystery where
[1:44:24] the life is
[1:44:25] required Oh Glory to God Hallelujah the
[1:44:30] Holy Ghost has to report not on
[1:44:31] teachings on life if it's teachings the
[1:44:34] sisters will stand a chance because
[1:44:36] sisters don't
[1:44:39] teach and there going to be some adopted
[1:44:44] daughters I'm not hearing them sister
[1:44:46] but and
[1:44:48] sisters the sisters in here believe that
[1:44:51] do you sisters in here believe that
[1:44:52] they're going to be adopted
[1:44:55] daughters
[1:44:58] hallah because some of them Sons get
[1:45:00] left back behind you
[1:45:01] know they don't behave themselves
[1:45:04] because God asking about Behavior
[1:45:07] behavior is what sets you on adoption
[1:45:10] your conduct your behavior your attitude
[1:45:13] your child training your tutorship these
[1:45:15] are words you're not hearing now but
[1:45:17] these are the thing you can't say you
[1:45:18] have arrived that is Guru business that
[1:45:21] new age business you're one with
[1:45:23] God my God I am
[1:45:26] God that's why Stone Jesus you know that
[1:45:29] is blasphemy if you can't approve
[1:45:32] it but Jesus could approve it but if you
[1:45:36] come and say you a God you can prove it
[1:45:37] it's Stone you know that's blasphemy you
[1:45:40] can't claim to be the Son of God and you
[1:45:42] can't prove it but Jesus said to prove
[1:45:44] that I could do this and I could do that
[1:45:45] I could do this I could do that I will
[1:45:47] do this and I will do that so that said
[1:45:50] that man let's leave him
[1:45:51] alone oh Hallelujah so let's go then he
[1:45:56] said if they get a true Revelation here
[1:45:57] we go of the two Spirits working in the
[1:46:01] framework of the Christian Church
[1:46:03] Hallelujah and by God's spirit
[1:46:07] discern and withstand the Antichrist
[1:46:11] Spirit Satan will be powerless before
[1:46:13] them so if we have to go forward we have
[1:46:16] to deser and withstand not just discern
[1:46:21] but withand challenge them challenge
[1:46:25] false teachings challenge false
[1:46:28] Doctrine oh
[1:46:30] hallelujah oh glory to God Satan hates
[1:46:33] Revelation but we love it with true
[1:46:35] Revelation in our lives the gates of
[1:46:37] hell can never Prevail against it amen
[1:46:40] so somewhere on this Earth there's got
[1:46:43] got a revelation of the two Spirits
[1:46:46] working in the framework of the
[1:46:49] Christian church somewhere on this Earth
[1:46:51] do you believe that
[1:46:53] oh blessed be the name of the Lord the
[1:46:56] two Spirits we want to find out about
[1:46:58] those two Spirits because there two
[1:46:59] Spirits oh hallelujah hallelujah blessed
[1:47:03] be the name of the Lord Glory Glory Give
[1:47:06] the Lord some praise His
[1:47:20] people hallelujah
[1:47:26] so I want to identify the two Spirits
[1:47:29] here not two teachings right now the two
[1:47:32] Spirits amen the life that come out your
[1:47:36] teachings and so on but the two Spirits
[1:47:39] turn your Bibles to 2 Timothy
[1:47:41] 3 if you have a mark you can put it to 2
[1:47:45] Peter 1 Also let's look at the two
[1:47:47] spirits in the church

[1:48:52] that are good
[1:48:54] traitors he highminded lovers of
[1:48:58] Pleasures more than lovers of God having
[1:49:01] a form of godliness but denying the
[1:49:04] power thereof from such turn away for of
[1:49:08] this sort are they which creep into
[1:49:11] houses and Lead captive silly women
[1:49:15] leading with sins LED away with divers
[1:49:18] lust ever learning never able to come to
[1:49:22] the knowledge of the truth I'll stop up
[1:49:25] there there for now okay let's just go a
[1:49:28] further now as Janis and jambes
[1:49:30] withstood Moses so do these also resist
[1:49:34] the truth men of corrupt Minds verse 8

[1:49:50] Doctrine manner of life
[1:49:54] purpose Faith Hallelujah longsuffering
[1:49:58] and charity and patience a and let's go
[1:50:01] to Second Peter 1 let's read 4-7 let's
[1:50:04] see the next spirit and these two
[1:50:07] Spirits going to be battling all what
[1:50:10] you just read is church people you know
[1:50:13] that is not people peating pan smoking
[1:50:15] marijuana and taking cocaine that is not
[1:50:18] the drunkards and the one that drinking
[1:50:21] liquor this is people this is church
[1:50:24] members Covetous proud love the self all
[1:50:29] of that having a form of godliness so
[1:50:32] they still going to church but look at
[1:50:34] the bright Spirit here now verse four of
[1:50:37] 2 Peter where I give unto us exceeding
[1:50:40] great and precious promises that by
[1:50:43] these you might be partakers of the
[1:50:44] divine
[1:50:46] nature having escaped the corruption
[1:50:48] that in the world true lust and besides
[1:50:50] this giving all diligence add to your
[1:50:53] faith virtue unto virtue knowledge unto
[1:50:56] knowledge Temperance andto Temperance
[1:50:58] patience andto patience godliness andto
[1:51:01] godliness brotherly kindness unto
[1:51:04] brotherly kindness
[1:51:06] charity that is the other Spirit
[1:51:10] Hallelujah that you have to actually
[1:51:12] discern oh praise God now the church
[1:51:16] what we just read there second Peter 2
[1:51:18] Timothy 3 that is the church members
[1:51:22] amen their ministers is Matthew
[1:51:25] 24:24 they are ministering to that
[1:51:27] church and Matthew 24:24 say there shall
[1:51:29] arise false Christ false prophets that
[1:51:32] shall show signs and wonders in so much
[1:51:35] they shall deceive the very elect if
[1:51:38] possible and second Peter 4 427 is the
[1:51:42] true church amen that is the true church
[1:51:45] and their Ministry is found in Ephesians
[1:51:47] 4 and he gives some Apostles some
[1:51:50] prophets some teachers some evangelists
[1:51:54] for the Perfection of the Saints the
[1:51:55] work of the ministry for theine body of
[1:51:58] Christ they be all come to un of the
[1:52:00] faith another Son of God unto a perfect
[1:52:02] man unto the measure of the stature of
[1:52:04] the fullness of Christ amen now this
[1:52:07] ministry for the bride is not an eternal
[1:52:10] Ministry it's until we all come amen
[1:52:13] until the unity of the faith not the Son
[1:52:15] of God in other words this is
[1:52:19] not
[1:52:21] uh when the people come to that maturity
[1:52:24] the 5old ministry Ministry is over
[1:52:26] that's right it's to bring you to a
[1:52:27] point where you have the unity of the
[1:52:29] faith n Son of God and to have your
[1:52:32] measure when you have your measure you
[1:52:34] need no man teach you but the Holy Ghost
[1:52:37] will teach you because you have Christ
[1:52:39] inside of you with the word in your
[1:52:42] measure isn't that right so therefore
[1:52:45] the faithful Ministry is not to take
[1:52:47] over churches manipulate and control
[1:52:51] churches that is
[1:52:53] human
[1:52:56] Unity
[1:52:57] cannot and must not break sovereignity
[1:53:01] now I got these words to speak this
[1:53:03] morning and this is very very important
[1:53:06] you see because if churches connect to
[1:53:09] one church after a while if that is not
[1:53:13] correct and correctly inspired it will
[1:53:16] bring a denominational spirit in which
[1:53:20] the sovereignity of the churches are
[1:53:21] destroyed
[1:53:23] and people individuals in the in the
[1:53:25] church begin to disrespect the local
[1:53:27] Elder because people start to say that
[1:53:30] church is their church and that Pastor
[1:53:33] is their pastor and they're getting
[1:53:34] their own Revelation and that will not
[1:53:36] be the will of
[1:53:38] God so when God talk about Unity it
[1:53:41] doesn't speak about Unity that contact
[1:53:45] or contradict sovereignity amen God will
[1:53:47] not have a Unity that breaks
[1:53:49] sovereignity because brother Bram said
[1:53:52] the Lord local church is
[1:53:53] Sovereign elects its own members directs
[1:53:57] what it has to do elects its own
[1:54:00] officers
[1:54:02] anytime some man trying to instruct
[1:54:05] pastors as to what they should listen to
[1:54:08] what inspiration they should have that
[1:54:10] is off the
[1:54:12] word that is a
[1:54:14] reintroduction of the nicolan spirit
[1:54:18] which was a deed in the early age and
[1:54:21] then become a
[1:54:23] and eventually it fulfilling a pope
[1:54:26] because you st you keep getting men over
[1:54:29] churches and men over areas and men over
[1:54:32] men until it reached to a hierarchy that
[1:54:35] you eventually get that
[1:54:36] Superman ill
[1:54:38] Papa the pope
[1:54:41] himself who is over
[1:54:43] all oh Hallelujah are you with
[1:54:46] me so therefore it cannot be a message
[1:54:51] Pope
[1:54:52] man of the hour pope of the hour Apostle
[1:54:56] of the hour or some Apostolic succession
[1:54:59] some man to follow after b as I told MP
[1:55:02] it do have such vacancy God don't have
[1:55:05] those application forms for anybody need
[1:55:08] not apply to take Brother Joseph Coleman
[1:55:11] Place he had a place in God that's right
[1:55:14] and he did what he was supposed to do
[1:55:16] the another book of Acts empowers the
[1:55:19] local churches to be who they are
[1:55:21] Hallelujah and what they have been sent
[1:55:23] to do isn't that right let's go a little
[1:55:25] further the f is that to please God W
[1:55:28] the passion to know the word the cry for
[1:55:30] reaching out in the spirit all begins to
[1:55:32] fade and instead of the church being on
[1:55:34] fire with the fire of God it has cooled
[1:55:36] off and become a bit formal that is what
[1:55:39] was happening back there to the
[1:55:40] Ephesians they were getting a bit formal
[1:55:42] the abandonment to God the dying out and
[1:55:45] the People weren Too careful about what
[1:55:47] God Tau of what watch the people weren't
[1:55:49] too careful about what God taught of
[1:55:51] them as they begin to be careful about
[1:55:53] what the world thought of them oh Hal
[1:55:55] one little deviation from the word was a
[1:55:58] step away from Christ people say they
[1:56:00] love God they go to church they shout
[1:56:02] Rejoice sing have an emotional time but
[1:56:05] when it's all over watch and see if they
[1:56:07] in the word walking in it living in it
[1:56:11] if they go through all the other and
[1:56:13] didn't walk in that word they say they
[1:56:15] love God but their lives tell another
[1:56:17] story keep your mind on the True Church
[1:56:21] the true church began on the day of
[1:56:23] Pentecost isn't that right the true
[1:56:26] church at Ephesus was not deceived by
[1:56:28] this polish intellectual speeches they
[1:56:30] wasn't deceived false Revelations that
[1:56:32] these fellow had called nians which did
[1:56:35] not cooperate with the word of God false
[1:56:38] Revelations not with the word but call
[1:56:40] them Liars they Ephesians now yes sir
[1:56:43] false Apostles false prophets but the
[1:56:45] true church held on to the original
[1:56:47] teaching of St Paul and the baptism of
[1:56:49] the Holy Ghost which signs following the
[1:56:52] way of God is
[1:56:54] Holiness let this be known to every
[1:56:56] member here in the body of christall
[1:56:59] until you live a holy life God refuses
[1:57:02] your sacrifice the sacrifice must be
[1:57:05] offered with holy hands the high priest
[1:57:07] before he could come to offer the
[1:57:09] sacrifice he had to be holy and
[1:57:11] dedicated and anointed and perfumed
[1:57:15] everything before he could even walk in
[1:57:16] the presence of God to offer the
[1:57:19] sacrifice is that right how can you go
[1:57:21] out here and cheat and steal and fuss
[1:57:25] and fight with your neighbors and
[1:57:26] everything else and carry on way you do
[1:57:28] and come here and B oh Lord Praise
[1:57:32] Jesus I see them speak in Tong people
[1:57:34] say I see them speak in Tong that don't
[1:57:36] mean they got the Holy Ghost I hear them
[1:57:38] shout that don't mean they got the Holy
[1:57:39] Ghost hear these words the Holy Ghost is
[1:57:43] alive could we give the Lord a praise
[1:57:45] offering on that
[1:57:50] one Hallelujah
[1:57:52] the Holy Ghost is what a life not a
[1:57:55] teaching a life a life Hallelujah but
[1:57:59] said the way started the nians watch the
[1:58:02] Deeds of the nicians began showing
[1:58:04] themselves then a group formed they
[1:58:06] drifted away from the pattern of the
[1:58:07] word just one word changed now the nians
[1:58:11] not deed as it was back there it become
[1:58:13] a Doctrine in this age High priests
[1:58:16] great fellows hadn't called themselves
[1:58:18] poops yet now they were like archbishops
[1:58:22] great fellows you know Renown their
[1:58:24] Doctrine was formal they were getting
[1:58:26] away from Spirit fill Holy Ghost LED
[1:58:28] Church they let them go off into
[1:58:29] minority call them Heretics but the
[1:58:32] church the real true church wanted to be
[1:58:34] free under the jurisdiction under the
[1:58:37] power of the Holy Spirit and Christ had
[1:58:39] promised to be with them he was their
[1:58:40] King the true church has never changed
[1:58:43] his attitude amen not to be ruled by
[1:58:46] some board I don't know what you call
[1:58:48] them now they are cardinals Bishops
[1:58:51] popes in
[1:58:53] ones that's I'm say right now that they
[1:58:55] right now Cardinals Bishop Pop's
[1:58:57] infallible ones and the word infallible
[1:58:59] means incapable of making mistakes
[1:59:02] incapable of being wrong oh my god when
[1:59:06] here we go when that Satan centered
[1:59:08] group was
[1:59:13] formed it began to hait and fight the
[1:59:17] True Believers insisting that they were
[1:59:20] the Church of God so this is being the
[1:59:23] church by enforcement and law and if you
[1:59:25] don't believe cut you off Smite isn't
[1:59:28] that right notice yeah we go how
[1:59:31] organization breaths hatred it destroys
[1:59:35] Fellowship it makes bitterness that is
[1:59:39] what SM that is what m means that is
[1:59:42] what sman means bitterness a root of
[1:59:44] bitterness defiles many so more more def
[1:59:47] was coming as the age feels it instead
[1:59:50] of the straight word of God instead of
[1:59:52] spirit filled men in the church who were
[1:59:54] led by Spirit given Revelation there
[1:59:58] were now Creeds bylaws educated guesses
[2:00:03] of educated men could it be could it be
[2:00:07] could it be and supp is not
[2:00:10] be educated guesses of educated men
[2:00:14] learning has taken the place of
[2:00:16] Revelation reason replace faith and
[2:00:20] program replace spontaneous PR in the
[2:00:22] Holy Ghost it had become a hybrid Church
[2:00:26] oh Hallelujah already the false Vine was
[2:00:30] turning loose his anger against the
[2:00:32] Living God by killing the
[2:00:34] elect you hear that touching the elect
[2:00:38] you're touching God that's why the
[2:00:40] pillar of fire tell Saul why thou
[2:00:42] persecuted me persecuting the church
[2:00:44] mean persecuting God allmighty Amen
[2:00:48] Hallelujah watch the true church tried
[2:00:53] I the true church kept trying to get the
[2:00:57] first church to
[2:00:58] repent but it would not do so it
[2:01:02] increase in size and influence and it
[2:01:06] Embark upon a constant campaign to
[2:01:08] discredit the true seed they claim that
[2:01:11] they alone are the true representative
[2:01:12] of the Lord Jesus Oh
[2:01:15] hallelujah hallelujah now let's be
[2:01:18] careful here this message to the angel
[2:01:21] of the church which is in Ephesus is not
[2:01:23] the message to the actual local
[2:01:25] Ephesians Church it is a message to the
[2:01:28] age and that age had in it the seed of
[2:01:31] truth and the seed of error exactly set
[2:01:34] forth in the parable of the weat and
[2:01:36] tears the false Church organized
[2:01:40] humanized the government and the word
[2:01:41] and fought the true Christian the third
[2:01:44] age revealed the spirit of Prophecy that
[2:01:47] the worldly Church would adopt nism as a
[2:01:50] Doctrine oh
[2:01:52] my Hallelujah listen to around the
[2:01:56] separation of the clergy from the lady
[2:01:58] group from the biblical truth of Elders
[2:02:00] Shepherds of local flocks this is it
[2:02:03] this is the biblical view Elders are
[2:02:05] Shepherds of local
[2:02:07] flocks ruling the flock by the world to
[2:02:10] the Deeds of the neans wherein the
[2:02:12] clergy set themselves in rank over one
[2:02:16] another like I went in India there and
[2:02:19] different pastors telling me that one
[2:02:20] brother I guess he was the Arch
[2:02:22] Bishop because somebody giving that
[2:02:24] brother instruction and this brother
[2:02:26] seemed to be taking the authority to be
[2:02:28] over churches and people asking him who
[2:02:30] who they should marry who they should
[2:02:32] not marry what they should preach and he
[2:02:34] controlling I said whoo whoa
[2:02:38] whoa I said brother I tell those
[2:02:40] brothers that guy no Arch Bishop over
[2:02:42] you all forget he your church is
[2:02:45] Sovereign listen I had 12 people in my
[2:02:47] church and my brother challenged me and
[2:02:48] I said that church in cywell is a
[2:02:50] sovereign church he said with 12 I say
[2:02:52] yes with 12 amen that's right what if
[2:02:55] they B to challenge me I B to challenge
[2:02:57] me right back that group is Sovereign so
[2:03:00] because we're 12 people we not sing is
[2:03:02] that right Margaret Tater former prime
[2:03:05] minister of England she said some
[2:03:06] powerful words many many years ago in a
[2:03:09] conference in England and that time
[2:03:10] Russia was doing bombs and and missiles
[2:03:13] and so on and she said very ladylike
[2:03:16] English way she said the weak tempts the
[2:03:21] strong
[2:03:24] so we have to get more powerful weapons
[2:03:26] so they wouldn't be
[2:03:30] tempted you you you understand what
[2:03:32] you're saying there when the strong see
[2:03:35] the weak this be tempted they feeling
[2:03:38] take over
[2:03:41] is they're feeling
[2:03:43] Domin they want to take over so God put
[2:03:47] rules and regulations by the spirit not
[2:03:51] to have that
[2:03:52] am because he knew once they start that
[2:03:54] it's po get in once they start that kind
[2:03:57] of thing where this over this and this
[2:03:59] over this and this over this you end up
[2:04:00] with a pope and the pope take the crown
[2:04:03] and he is God on Earth you know how he
[2:04:05] is you know how he
[2:04:07] moving he is infallible he is ill Papa
[2:04:11] and afterwards when they get up there
[2:04:12] you know they get a new name too change
[2:04:14] the name and so on so these guys are
[2:04:16] real imposters impersonators you name it
[2:04:18] they have it d p you know they have a
[2:04:20] triple CR you know from better that gold
[2:04:22] so heavy two men had to hold that Crown
[2:04:24] to just touch it in his head cuz say the
[2:04:26] L leg go that CR is break his head he
[2:04:28] power heaven and purgatory and someplace
[2:04:30] else that's right man are plenty power
[2:04:33] man you you you understand I'm saying
[2:04:35] that that's the pope and that is what a
[2:04:37] Pentecostal Church fell
[2:04:40] to be careful I'm not
[2:04:46] playing oh
[2:04:49] Hallelujah I saw another angel a horse
[2:04:52] riding a Pale Horse and death and Hell

[2:05:33] right and how much they going to get in
[2:05:35] paradise and them guys dying to go to
[2:05:38] paradise that's right so they blowing up
[2:05:40] theel killing theel they're going and
[2:05:41] fight they fighting to D they nothing to
[2:05:43] lose you that's right think about it

[2:05:53] house of God you pressing for that
[2:05:55] pillar you have to press towards to

[2:07:23] Bride of the
[2:07:26] spirit numbing the people with debt

[2:08:34] finished yet I know it's that kind of
[2:08:35] lengthy message a teaching message but

[2:08:54] virtue this is the land this is the land
[2:08:55] here that rainbow to be inside of you
[2:08:57] that rain listen the de Angels when I
[2:08:59] see the blood he can't see it on the
[2:09:01] inside it has to come on the outside the
[2:09:04] blood was seen that blood that token is
[2:09:07] the spirit the life have to come on the
[2:09:09] outside what's on the inside have to be
[2:09:12] manifest in other words you could say
[2:09:14] you a Christian but until you manifest
[2:09:17] your Christianity you're still saying
[2:09:19] you are a Christian the life have to
[2:09:22] come out and
[2:09:24] thunder then it becomes a live voice and
[2:09:28] that's the Thunder that shakes the
[2:09:36] devil voice has to live how many have to
[2:09:42] live how many believe the word must live
[2:09:44] in them how many understand coming to
[2:09:47] church doesn't make you a Christian
[2:09:51] Glory I feel your desire growing for a
[2:09:55] manifestation in your life you've got to
[2:09:59] have a desire to see the word manifested
[2:10:03] because you must be the word manifested
[2:10:05] to be the
[2:10:11] bride see that brother Bram said when
[2:10:15] the Holy Ghost fell in the upper room
[2:10:17] and the people said to carry on the
[2:10:19] devil turn over and back and sleep he
[2:10:21] said they excited that's right they're
[2:10:24] making noise they shouting they're
[2:10:27] screaming they acting like drunk men
[2:10:28] devil say I sleeping on that one call me
[2:10:31] when something serious happen but when
[2:10:34] the word start to ooze out to Peter when
[2:10:37] Peter went to the gate called beautiful
[2:10:39] and that man was there and he
[2:10:41] said Silver and Gold Have I None such as
[2:10:43] have I give unto you rise up and walk
[2:10:45] devil say this is serious this is
[2:10:47] serious this is word manifested now
[2:10:49] they're not excited no more
[2:10:51] this we have to stop this we have to
[2:10:54] arrest this must not continue but they
[2:10:57] are go we now getting started we are now
[2:11:00] about to write another book of
[2:11:04] Acts oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[2:11:09] glory to God
[2:11:11] Glory Glory Hallelujah Hallelujah we now
[2:11:16] about to write another book of
[2:11:19] Acts amen
[2:11:21] Hallelujah
[2:11:23] Glory sad to say you may be seated the
[2:11:27] True Vine was not exactly immune from
[2:11:29] this Doctrine but as I do not mean that
[2:11:32] the True Vine did establish nican idas
[2:11:34] as a Doctrine fa but a little worm of
[2:11:36] debt kept sucking at the True Vine
[2:11:39] hoping it might fall even within the
[2:11:41] true church men whom God had called as
[2:11:45] offers were holding that title to mean a
[2:11:48] little more than local responsibility
[2:11:52] this is when a man feel he's in charge
[2:11:54] of Africa charge of South America charge
[2:11:58] of Europe charge of here and there and
[2:12:00] he figure he could call up pastors and
[2:12:03] tell them this and tell them that he
[2:12:04] believe in other words he make himself a
[2:12:06] pope yes and they don't want to go out
[2:12:08] of line because the people are asking we
[2:12:11] want to be connected to this or we want
[2:12:13] that and want that so if the pastor take
[2:12:15] up the authority the people will Rebel
[2:12:17] and with the connection it have now
[2:12:19] where people could be connected to this
[2:12:20] and that the other people could stay
[2:12:21] home they could do what they want and
[2:12:22] people undermining churches and whatnot
[2:12:24] all of that now is a new age a new
[2:12:26] dimension of things but that is not the
[2:12:29] principle that is laid down in the Bible
[2:12:31] that's not a principle that is in the
[2:12:33] Bible with Paul so I want to tell the
[2:12:35] pastors even out there who may hear this
[2:12:36] message don't let no man tell you what
[2:12:38] to preach what inspiration you supposed
[2:12:40] to have don't let that happen at all to
[2:12:42] take control of your churches that is
[2:12:44] unscriptural because at the end of it
[2:12:46] all God will hold that man
[2:12:49] accountable for the flock that God plac
[2:12:52] In His Hands God will never ask another
[2:12:54] Minister about you God will ask me you
[2:12:57] responsibility of you in my
[2:13:01] hands so that is why I have to preach
[2:13:03] what I have to preach say what I have to
[2:13:05] say because at the end of the day I have
[2:13:07] to give an account and the kind of
[2:13:09] person I am I don't like
[2:13:13] excuses that's why I say if you feel it
[2:13:15] I have fail I'm supposed to provide
[2:13:17] leadership I'm supposed to present the
[2:13:19] word to you that we can make it is is
[2:13:21] not right all right let me see B wrap up
[2:13:23] here wo my God hallelujah it was not
[2:13:27] clear understanding of Paul that existed
[2:13:29] at his time watch watch and they
[2:13:32] glorified god in me no matter what
[2:13:34] Authority Paul had listen to this he
[2:13:36] kept the people looking to God from whom
[2:13:40] is all
[2:13:41] authority but the clergy watch was
[2:13:44] always looking to Divine leadership plus
[2:13:47] human and thus in giving honor where
[2:13:50] honor was not you we find the true
[2:13:53] church was spotted with humanism with
[2:13:56] nism establish Apostolic succession
[2:14:00] placed ministers pastors voted in it was
[2:14:04] only one step for the faler to proceed
[2:14:07] to bism the Second Step was to be the
[2:14:09] death of
[2:14:11] Satan so first a deed then a Doctrine
[2:14:14] then it go to all this Apostolic
[2:14:16] succession then go to B bism then it go
[2:14:19] to the depth of Satan oh Hallelujah he
[2:14:22] said this age started off in the first
[2:14:24] of 20th century this age here it was the
[2:14:26] age in which the true church would
[2:14:28] return being the bride like she was at
[2:14:30] Pentecost we know that there must have
[2:14:32] necessity to be a return of dynamic
[2:14:34] power the Believers sense this in their
[2:14:37] Spirits here we go and they begin to cry
[2:14:40] to God for a new outpouring as it was in
[2:14:43] the first century listen to this what
[2:14:45] seemed to be the answer came as many
[2:14:49] began to speak in tongues and manifest
[2:14:52] gifts of the Spirit it was then believed
[2:14:55] that this was indeed the long waited
[2:14:57] restoration he's talking about 1906 he's
[2:14:59] talking about the hungering and Theo of
[2:15:01] the spirit at the early age watch it was
[2:15:04] not for the lattering can only come
[2:15:08] after the former Reign which is the
[2:15:10] spring or teaching
[2:15:12] rign so for all these 40 plus years it
[2:15:15] has been a teaching rain to forerun the
[2:15:18] for the latter rain because the latter
[2:15:20] rain this inspiration reain to bring and
[2:15:23] make manifest what has been taught now
[2:15:26] you cannot change the seed in midterm
[2:15:28] whatever the seed is it going to come
[2:15:30] forth youve got to have the right seed
[2:15:34] because the rain only manifest what the
[2:15:36] seed is the rain doesn't change the seed
[2:15:40] the rain only manifests the seed and if
[2:15:42] we plant the perfect man it going to
[2:15:45] manifest the perfect
[2:15:48] man and that is the seed that was
[2:15:52] Ed second Peter 1
[2:15:56] 427 that's the seed in you that's the
[2:15:59] word in the bride that's the word in the
[2:16:02] bride that's the pyramid in you that's
[2:16:05] the Bible in
[2:16:08] you oh give the Lord a shout of
[2:16:13] Praise oh hallelujah hallu hallelujah
[2:16:17] hallelujah you may be seated I know we
[2:16:20] little lty but I've got to go right now
[2:16:22] got to continue right now now
[2:16:25] watch the prophet messenger who was sent
[2:16:29] to teach the people and turn the heart
[2:16:32] of the children back to the Pentecost
[2:16:33] had not yet come thus what was T to be
[2:16:37] the restoration and final quickening
[2:16:40] unto the Rapture love
[2:16:42] that had not yet
[2:16:45] come it was a mixture of the unrighteous
[2:16:49] partaking of spiritual blessing
[2:16:51] and manifesting in the Holy Ghost in it
[2:16:56] was the devil
[2:16:57] power as men were under the control of
[2:17:01] devils this is church realm yet no one
[2:17:05] seemed to realize it to prove it was not
[2:17:09] the real thing when the second
[2:17:11] generation appeared organized and wrote
[2:17:14] the unscriptural doctrine and build
[2:17:16] their own fences as every other group
[2:17:19] ahead of them did
[2:17:21] so fences organization is a confirmation
[2:17:25] that it is
[2:17:26] off because the spirit cannot be
[2:17:29] organized because you can't box in God
[2:17:32] you can't fence god with a Doctrine and
[2:17:35] a teaching he would sneak out he would
[2:17:37] walk out Hallelujah God is a spirit and
[2:17:41] they that worship Him must worship Him
[2:17:44] in spirit and in truth oh
[2:17:48] Hallelujah Glory
[2:17:51] listen to this what we have set forth is
[2:17:54] much easier to be understood if all
[2:17:56] believe the doctrine of the Wess of the
[2:17:58] godhead for there are not three persons
[2:18:01] in the godhead but one thus we are not
[2:18:04] born again by the spirit of life of
[2:18:05] Jesus coming in and then subsequent to
[2:18:07] that the holy spirit comeing in to give
[2:18:09] us power if that is true why are we
[2:18:12] dishonoring the father by not giving him
[2:18:14] part in our complete salvation he said
[2:18:17] if salvation is of the lord and there
[2:18:19] are three Lords then he father must have
[2:18:21] something to do too but surely it can be
[2:18:24] seen that Jesus made this very clear
[2:18:28] that it was he and he alone who is God
[2:18:31] and he alone who is coming into the
[2:18:34] believer s John 14:16 says that the
[2:18:38] father will send another comforter this
[2:18:41] is Brother Bram interpreting the
[2:18:42] scriptures SN 14 says 16 the father was
[2:18:46] a comforter but in verse 17 Jesus said
[2:18:50] he dwelleth with them and should be in
[2:18:52] them later amen yes Amen in verse 18 he
[2:18:58] says he will come to them in verse 23 he
[2:19:01] is speaking he said we father and son
[2:19:04] will come into him thus it is the father
[2:19:07] Son and Holy Ghost all coming in at what
[2:19:10] time all coming in at one time it's one
[2:19:16] person a man preach and say father son
[2:19:18] something missing who missing and
[2:19:23] man the bride missing father son and man
[2:19:27] father son and man man make up the
[2:19:29] godhead therefore man is God therefore
[2:19:31] the bride is God so father son miss out
[2:19:33] the spirit so therefore the bride is the
[2:19:36] spirit that is a real piece of
[2:19:38] intellectual reason there a a piece of
[2:19:40] high science that that real high that
[2:19:42] too high for me this year is very simple
[2:19:44] for me this is very simple father son
[2:19:48] Holy Ghost all coming in one time for it
[2:19:51] is one person comprising the godhead it
[2:19:54] don't have bride the third part of the
[2:19:56] Trinity what Trinity they talking about
[2:19:58] that's foolishness Hallelujah that's
[2:20:00] just corrupt Doctrine oh blessed be the
[2:20:03] name of the Lord that advent took place
[2:20:06] at at Pentecost there aren't two comings
[2:20:08] of his Spirit just one the trouble is
[2:20:11] that people don't know the real truth oh
[2:20:13] blessed be the name of the Lord here we
[2:20:16] go almost in the home stretch now praise
[2:20:19] God hallelujah we go The Seven Ages are
[2:20:23] set forth by Revelation chap 2 and 3
[2:20:25] take in the whole span of the fullness
[2:20:26] of the Gentiles or the whole time in
[2:20:29] which God is dealing with the Gentiles
[2:20:30] and the Salvation in every single age by
[2:20:33] none it says the very same thing in
[2:20:35] opening and closing in the message of
[2:20:36] each age unto the messenger of smna
[2:20:39] titra Philadelphia laia right these
[2:20:41] things say he he a let him here what the
[2:20:44] spirit said in the churches notice here
[2:20:47] that Jesus by the spirit amen in every
[2:20:51] age Hallelujah addresses himself to only
[2:20:54] one person relative to the word of that
[2:20:57] age only one messenger for each age
[2:21:02] receives what the spirit has to say to
[2:21:04] that age and that one messenger is the
[2:21:07] messenger to the true church amen he
[2:21:10] speaks here we go he's a messenger to
[2:21:13] what true church say true church true
[2:21:15] church he's a messenger of the what true
[2:21:17] church all right now here we go he
[2:21:19] speaks for God
[2:21:21] by Revelation to the churches both true
[2:21:25] and
[2:21:27] false so even though the prophet is a
[2:21:31] messenger to the true church he speaks
[2:21:33] to the
[2:21:34] churches both true and false the message
[2:21:39] is then broadcast to all here we go but
[2:21:43] though it is broadcast for all who come
[2:21:46] within the range of the
[2:21:48] message that message is received
[2:21:52] individually by only a certain qualified
[2:21:56] group in a certain
[2:22:00] way so they don't receive it just
[2:22:03] ordinary this message is received by a
[2:22:07] certain group this has to be the same
[2:22:09] group on page three or four wait till
[2:22:11] them seven Thunders UT the voices to
[2:22:13] that group who receive what who receive
[2:22:17] the message in a certain way
[2:22:23] oh are you ready this is good how many
[2:22:25] enjoying the word this
[2:22:29] morning Hallelujah here we go let's
[2:22:32] describe the individuals in that group
[2:22:34] because that's not a church that's not a
[2:22:35] place that's groups that's individual
[2:22:37] around the world listen to this each
[2:22:40] individual of that group are you ready
[2:22:43] yes everybody ready you ready sure
[2:22:45] you're ready all right each individual
[2:22:49] of that group
[2:22:51] is one who has the ability to hear what
[2:22:55] the spirit is saying by way of the
[2:23:00] messenger not by some Pastor the
[2:23:04] messenger have to say
[2:23:10] it here we go those who
[2:23:15] hear are not getting their own private
[2:23:18] Revelation all right nor or is the group
[2:23:22] getting a collective Revelation and
[2:23:24] that's what we have had groups getting
[2:23:27] Collective Revelation when one man say
[2:23:30] something everybody else parot the same
[2:23:32] thing yes
[2:23:34] yes so when things get messed up the
[2:23:36] whole group get messed up when things
[2:23:38] Falls the whole group
[2:23:41] Falls no genuine
[2:23:45] Revelation I told a minister he didn't
[2:23:47] hear from God when he preaching one of
[2:23:48] the conventions I said God didn't speak
[2:23:49] to you I told him that direct I said you
[2:23:52] did not hear from God because you wasn't
[2:23:55] speaking for God or by God you were
[2:23:57] backing up things that was
[2:24:00] false you see you see that brother over
[2:24:03] yes I said many other things
[2:24:07] too
[2:24:08] Hallelujah but each person is hearing
[2:24:13] and receiving what the messenger has
[2:24:15] already received from God that is why
[2:24:18] brother Bram said the messenger the
[2:24:20] prophet and the bride says the same
[2:24:22] thing the spirit the prophet and the
[2:24:25] bride says the same thing he said he
[2:24:27] will confounder by the prophet and the
[2:24:29] bride yes amen the conf is to confus to
[2:24:33] mess with their minds they can't even
[2:24:35] understand how the bride could move on
[2:24:36] the moving he will confounder confuse
[2:24:39] them oh Hallelujah Paul alone had the
[2:24:42] full Revelation and this is evidenced by
[2:24:45] his confrontation of the other apostles
[2:24:47] who admitted that Paul was a prophet
[2:24:48] messenger also note by actual
[2:24:51] illustration in the word when Paul
[2:24:53] desired to go to Asia God forbade him
[2:24:56] for the Sheep his children were in
[2:24:58] Macedonia and Macedonia would hear what
[2:25:00] the spirit have to say and in what Paul
[2:25:03] while Asia would not in every age
[2:25:06] exactly the same pattern mus come on
[2:25:08] please I think I'll close up here
[2:25:10] there's not def finish in the message
[2:25:12] actually this was a long message I have
[2:25:14] 19 pages I reached 13 so we we can get
[2:25:16] in close so in every age we have the
[2:25:19] same pattern that that is why the light
[2:25:21] comes through some god-given messenger
[2:25:24] in a certain area and then from that
[2:25:26] messenger there spreads the light
[2:25:28] through the ministry of others who have
[2:25:31] been Faithfully taught but of course all
[2:25:34] those who go out don't always learn how
[2:25:37] necessary it is to speak only what the
[2:25:39] messenger has spoken Hallelujah remember
[2:25:43] Paul wared the people only what he said
[2:25:46] If any man think himself to be a prophet
[2:25:48] of spiritual let him ack knowledge of
[2:25:50] the things that I write unto you are the
[2:25:52] Commandments of the Lord isn't that
[2:25:54] right how careful we must be to hear one
[2:25:56] voice for the spirit has one voice which
[2:26:00] is the voice of God the spirit only has
[2:26:04] one voice which is the voice of God
[2:26:06] which is the voice of the word
[2:26:08] hallelujah so anything off the word is
[2:26:10] not the spirit speaking isn't that right
[2:26:13] so Paul warned them to say what he said
[2:26:16] even as Peter did likewise he warned
[2:26:18] them that even he Paul couldn't change
[2:26:19] one word of what he have given by
[2:26:22] Revelation every messenger of every age
[2:26:24] will preach the word every fresh and
[2:26:27] true Revival will be
[2:26:31] because men have gotten back to the word
[2:26:33] of God hallelujah The Cry of every age
[2:26:35] is a rebuke you have left the word of
[2:26:37] God repent come back to the word from
[2:26:40] the first book of Genesis to the last
[2:26:42] book of Revelation there's only one
[2:26:44] reason for God's displeasure leaving the
[2:26:47] word there's only one remedy get back
[2:26:50] back on the word oh blessed be the name
[2:26:53] of the Lord hallelujah praise God 2
[2:26:57] Peter 2:12 and there were false prophets
[2:27:00] among them even as there will be false
[2:27:01] teachers among you who prively shall
[2:27:03] bring in damnable heresies even denying
[2:27:06] the Lord that brought them and bring
[2:27:08] upon themselves F destruction isn't that
[2:27:10] right second Timothy 4 3 to 4 for the
[2:27:14] time will come they will not endure song
[2:27:16] Doctrine but after their own lust shall
[2:27:19] have Heap teachers Hallelujah and
[2:27:21] themselves teachers having itching ears
[2:27:23] and shall turn from truth unto fables oh
[2:27:27] praise God 1 Timothy 4:1 for the spirit
[2:27:31] speaketh expressly that in the latter
[2:27:33] times some shall depart from the Fate
[2:27:36] giv heed to seducing spirits and
[2:27:39] doctrines of devils oh hallelujah oh
[2:27:43] it's a terrible time we living in we
[2:27:45] have to have discernment to discern the
[2:27:47] two Spirits working in the framework of
[2:27:49] the church now in every case you will
[2:27:52] notice that the false prophet is one who
[2:27:55] is outside the word and we showed you
[2:27:58] what the Antichrist means anti- word so
[2:28:01] these false prophets come perverting the
[2:28:03] word giving it a meaning that fits their
[2:28:06] own devilish ends have you noticed how
[2:28:09] the people who lead others astray bind
[2:28:12] closely to themselves by
[2:28:15] fear I want to repeat that have you
[2:28:18] noticed how people who lead others
[2:28:21] astray buying people closely to
[2:28:23] themselves by
[2:28:28] fear they say if the people don't do
[2:28:32] what they say destruction will follow
[2:28:34] they are false prophets for a true
[2:28:37] Prophet will always lead one to the word
[2:28:40] and bind the people to Jesus Christ oh
[2:28:43] give the Lord a shout of Praise he will
[2:28:46] not tell the people to fear
[2:28:48] Him or what says but to fear what the
[2:28:52] word
[2:28:52] says oh give the Lord a praise
[2:28:56] offering oh hallelujah hallelujah glory
[2:29:00] to God glory to God Amen
[2:29:05] Hallelujah here is prophecy I believe
[2:29:09] one of these glorious days when this
[2:29:11] United confir of churches goes together
[2:29:13] and the new pope is brought out of the
[2:29:15] United States and put over there
[2:29:18] according to prophecy then there will
[2:29:20] form an image unto the Beast and I tell
[2:29:22] you the True Church of God will be drove
[2:29:25] together and the True Believers out of
[2:29:28] Methodist Baptist Presbyterian whatever
[2:29:30] will go together cemented by the love of
[2:29:33] God that will make up the body of Jesus
[2:29:35] Christ oh hallelujah oh glory to God

[2:29:57] you see where the false and the
[2:29:59] counterfeit is trying to keep great men
[2:30:01] from places like that oh Hallelujah as
[2:30:04] Daniel heard the seven Thunders and was
[2:30:06] forbidden to write John heard the voices
[2:30:08] and this book was sealed and the back of
[2:30:11] the book was sealed with Seven Seals but
[2:30:13] in the days of these seals to be open
[2:30:15] the mystery of God will be finished in
[2:30:17] other words God would be known to his
[2:30:20] church not in three people but as one
[2:30:23] person the mystery of God would be
[2:30:26] revealed and when that was completely
[2:30:28] revealed then the seven Mysteries would
[2:30:30] open to the church because in there the
[2:30:33] church would be living under the
[2:30:35] inspiration of the Holy Spirit that's

[2:33:23] coming to end the Gentile dispensation
[2:33:25] here people don't know when Moses come
