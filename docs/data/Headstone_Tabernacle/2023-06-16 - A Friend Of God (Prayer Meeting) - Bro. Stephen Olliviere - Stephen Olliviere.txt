lifted up in this place in Jesus precious name with thanks given amen and amen praise God thank you Jesus amen God bless you one more time and we want to turn to two portions of scripture tonight uh since James James chapter 2 and Saint John chapter 14. praise God Glory record amen so Saint James chapter 2 verse 1 verse verse 23. amen and it says and the scripture was fulfilled which said Abraham which said Abraham believed God and it was imputed unto him for righteousness and he was called the friend of God amen and over in Saint John Chapter 14 verse 15. Saint John Chapter 14 verse 15. if you love me keep my Commandments amen praise God heavenly father bless your word one more time we pray in Jesus name with Thanksgiving amen amen praise God so tonight title of this short exhortation is a friend of God friend of course so I'm just talking a little bit first friendship it's a quality that is special to us as human beings as family members as Christian brothers and sisters true friendship enriches Our Lives it enriches our experiences in this journey of life it is an opportunity to share ourselves amen so just talk a little bit before I strike what I want to get at amen I can see please see that everyone in this room tonight has at least one friend or you had a friend at some point in time can we say Amen praise God a friend of all times a friend in laughter and it goes both ways a friend in pain a friend in sickness a friend in grief a friend in need a friend in Joy a friend in Celebration a friend to council a friend when everyone else has forsaken you he or she is still there praise God so a true friend is invaluable so precious that you cannot put a value to that friendship do you have a friend like that you have a friend like that you can trust that person you believe in that business the person is not perfect but you understand each other well and the Book of Proverbs speaks about friends Proverbs chapter 18 verse 24. it says a man that had friends must show himself friendly and there's a friend that sticker closer than a brother so this hints at being genuine and faithful and loyal and supportive even as our lord Jesus he said I will never leave you nor forsake you thank you Lord amen he is the ultimate true friend try to make him your friend tonight and keep him as a friend Hallelujah if you are not friendly or willing to extend yourself to others then no nobody may be inclined to reach out in Friendship to you I remember brother over saying sometime some people's circle of friends is just too small let me extend just to your family but tonight we want to launch out open up your heart to others and extend yourself to others can we say Amen tonight praise God we're still talking amen don't be a turtle in a shell don't be a pickery balled up closed in person suspicious of everyone scared of their own shadow but there is so much benefit to Le and things to learn from others and so much that others can learn and benefit from you so be nice be friendly be a friend praise God on the other hand some people have over 2 000 friends on social media that's cool but we are talking about real genuine friends now some people come around because you have money or or resources that they want to take advantage of and when the money is finished the friendship ends they hang around just to see what they can get Proverbs identify those that type Proverbs 19 Verse 6 he says many will entreat the favor of the prince and every man is a friend to him that giveth gifts right so you are in a position you want to be your friend you are well known they want to associate with you you are a giver they hung around you so there are those types and we look out for them but a true friend is with you through thick and thin always there for you amen still talking tonight amen and a true friend will tell you the truth even if it pains you he will tell you for example I know you may feel bad but I need to tell you that your behavior was off and that was not the way to speak to your wife go and apologize and come back and let me know how it was a true friend will tell you something like that you know he's there with you also and you appreciate the frankness and the straightforwardness of your friend because love is corrected at the same time amen Proverbs chapter 27 6. faithful are the wounds of a friend but the kisses of an enemy are deceitful amen so if you are doing foolish this and someone is encouraged it's encouraging you or not corrected you so they encouraging you any foolishness or they are not correcting you that person is not your friend he or she is not seeking your good interest move away from that ship that is not a friendship praise the Lord amen you want somebody to counsel you to advise you to look out for you and vice versa because friendship is a two-way street from verse chapter 27 9 it says ointment and perfume Rejoice the heart so does the sweetness of a man's Friend by hearty Council so be happy when you get good counsel from your friend all right your friend will speak the truth and love a nice rebook rebuke don't pull away just take it in good spirits amen can we see amen tonight so that was just a little encouragement for us to be genuine friends among ourselves but Jesus is our Lord Jesus Is Our Savior Jesus is our healer and tonight we know him as our God healer we know him as Our Redeemer we know him as our deliverer we know him as our strength Giver but tonight is he your friend that's a question to talk about friend before and are you his friend whose friendship is a two-way thing is he your friend and are you his friend we read him in James that Abraham was a friend of God so to be of to be in friendship to be in a relationship it requires two parties two persons in one ship two fellows in one ship two friends in one ship companionship Jesus is a friend that's ticket closer than a brother and in Saint John chapter 15 verse 13. Greater Love had no man than this than a man lay down his life for his friends he has been a true friend to us a real true friend to us he has gone over and beyond for us he gave his all for us and Isaac Isaiah he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and by his stripes we are healed he gave us life that we could live and he has never given up on us he's a real true friend tonight Hallelujah do we know him as a friend a true friend when you're down he picks you up what a friend we have in Jesus tonight praise God hallelujah he is always there with us and and you all are Christians you can relate to this tonight amen he's always there with us I can see you saying amen because this is your experience amen he is a father but he is a friend sometimes he picks us up and Carries us when the road gets too rough Hallelujah one songwriter says a friend when sickness lays low a friend when death draws near a friend asked through the veil I go a friend to help and chair another is a friend when other friendships cease a friend when others feel a friend who gives me joy and peace a friend when foes are sealed o praise God he sticks closer than a brother tonight can we say Amen can we thank him tonight for his friendship amen praise God blessed be the name of the Lord thank you Lord you may have a friend from childhood that has remained close to you over the years I have such a friend but things happen the person might migrate or pass on before you or there are times when you may be away from each other for a very long time but this friend he is with you all the time he promised never to leave you no I will be with you always always I will never leave you nor forsake you can somebody say hallelujah tonight glory to God what a friend we have in Jesus oh praise God praise God can you thank him tonight can you praise him tonight glory to God Amen just take a moment to appreciate the Lord tonight raise your hands in your home and just appreciate him tonight for his friendship for his love oh hallelujah hallelujah what a friend we have in Jesus or we can come David all our cares oh praise God nobody cares for me like Jesus hallelujah hallelujah we appreciate you tonight we love you tonight oh blessed be the name of the Lord oh praise God Amen amen one time brother said many many years ago he said a friend knows all about you and loves you still yes Lord Glory I thank Jesus for that because I messed up so many times but he didn't give up on me can we say Amen I fall I make mistakes I do wrong things from time to time but oh God you pick me right back up every time each and every time what a friend Hallelujah there's no one like my Jesus tonight amen many many men when others give up on me not my Lord not my friend amen glory hallelujah thank you Jesus stick cut closer than a brother and your brothers I mean you can't part from your brother I used to get closer to my brother another song I had to say what a friend we have in Jesus all our sins and griefs to bear what a privilege to carry everything To God In Prayer amen and tonight we came to take it to the Lord in prayer whatever ages take it to the Lord in prayer whatever burden that is weighing you down you could tell your friend tonight you know you don't want to tell everybody your business and tell everybody what's going on with you but you can tell your friend they pick up your food and talk to your friend and say this is what is happening and they would listen and talk to you but Jesus is our friend tonight whatever your burden is take it to the Lord tonight have we trials and temptations yes we do is there trouble in your family is there trouble in your life is there trouble in your home don't be discouraged take it to the Lord and pray can we see Hallelujah tonight so blessed be the name of the Lord thank you Jesus can we find a friend so faithful sometimes even your best friend could get fed up of you but not our Lord tonight not that friend not that friend who will all our sorrows share Jesus knows and tonight I say he knows he knows he knows your weakness he knows your problems he knows your struggles you don't have to hide them from the Lord you don't have to hide them when you come to pray you can talk to him Jesus knows praise God just take it to the Lord and pray you know sometimes a situation come up and you don't know how to tell somebody you don't know what to say you're afraid to say you don't have to do that with this friend just tell him all about your problem just cast all he cares upon Him praise God tonight so we're the right place and we're gonna we're gonna pray to our friend tonight Hallelujah just take you to the Lord and pray so I am so happy I feel so safe In the Arms of Jesus praise God I'm so glad that he is my friend tonight oh praise God nothing like him amen so make him a friend make him your personal friend says he wants to be your body and your body is your real real real good friend you talk about everything you share everything you know each other so well the relationship and friendship is so close that you understand each other so well you know each other so well the quality of friendship of Fellowship is so profound so rich when it's your body when it's a close friend and I remember one time listening to brother Billy Paul given a testimony and he said brother Brian I was praying in the room and he always respected when his father prayed in the room and he's and he was hearing his father prayed and he stopped outside the room and he listened to brother Brown and praying and he heard about him talking to the Lord as if he was his friend then when Billy entered the room very quietly but Ibraham said father excuse me please Billy just entered the room oh hallelujah what a friend what a relationship the prophet had with his Lord it was intimate it was as if he's right there a real friendship and and you know when we talked to God tonight don't do as if God is up there and we are down here he's right here with us he's a true friend making your friend tonight as a songwriter said just to be close to you is what I long to do praise God Amen Abraham was called the friend of God he was the father of feet and he believed God no matter what from a message who is this who is this Abraham Abraham knew the nature of God because he was a friend of God my hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah continues he knew how to take him because he knew that his promises no matter how foolish they looked how simple they looked how unreasonable they looked they were true because God said so and that settled it forever oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah praise God continues and that's the way every Seed of Abraham does today and he's talking about you and me that's the way the born-again Christian does today no matter what the world says what science is God's word stands above it all we keep our eyes on what he said can we say Amen tonight just keep your eyes on God's word keep your eyes on God's word amen Hallelujah and said John 15 do you love him yes we do then keep my word keep my word Saint John 14 15 if you love me keep my Commandments how do you sure you love him how do you show he's a friend if you love me keep my Commandments Oh Glory to God David said Thy Word have i hidden or hid in my heart so he hid the word of the Lord in his heart he hit he hid the precious words of his friend in his heart Hallelujah so that he wouldn't fail him Oh Glory David was a friend of God he was a man after God's Own Heart almost finished so since when we become when he becomes your true friend talk about a joy to pray a joy to come into His presence oh Hallelujah a joy to read his word you can't wait to read his word he can't wait to get to his presence you can't wait to tell others about Jesus about your friend because you know him personally he is your friend you're sharing your friend with somebody else amen the quality of your relationship with him gets deeper it gets richer we call it spiritual intimacy you and God you and your friend becoming closer said he made praying a habit or he just was he was at the love of Jesus he just wanted to talk to him every moment of the day he would make praying a habit Oh Glory to God just breathe the holy name in prayer every every moment of the day praise God every day you fall in love with Jesus over and over and over again hallelujah praise God God wants the church to love him he wants that amen and we've got to be on speaking terms with him before we can have spoken word power spoken with power is coming but brother Brian said we have to be on speaking terms with him before we can have spoken word power it will only come to those who have been speaking to him speaking with him who know him who know his nature praise God Amen so we have to become a friend of God we got to know him like Abraham did Abraham knew the nature of God because he was his friend Hallelujah Abraham was a friend of God he knew the nature of God hallelujah and Saint John 15 15. Jesus said henceforth I call you not servants for the servants knows not what his Lord doeth but I have called you friends for all things I have heard of my father I have made known unto you who glory to God Amen Hallelujah you only tell your friends your secret amen no glory you don't tell everybody a secret to tell your friends praise God Amen praise God hallelujah so the songwriter says friendship with Jesus Fellowship divine oh what blessed sweet communion Jesus is a friend of mine hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah amen and since as we pray tonight may your time of prayer be as sweet Fellowship divine sweet communion with Jesus Oh Hallelujah not a monologue a monologue is where one person is talking nobody answering that's not a fellowship and the other give God time to answer back you have to listen to what he's saying back to you not a monologue but a dialogue two people a fellowship with your friend praise God you can't wait to talk to him and hear what he has to say back to you it's a love relationship it's a love Fellowship friendship with Jesus tonight you are a friend of God so as you prayed tonight talk to your friend talk to your precious friend God bless
