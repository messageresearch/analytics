[1:33:25] only goes on sonification and so forth
[1:33:27] Paul did the same thing without
[1:33:28] consulting the church because it was the
[1:33:30] same guy didn't how can we beats a day
[1:33:32] when people deny these truths when Peter
[1:33:35] taught what he said about the church was
[1:33:37] to be put in order Paul had the same
[1:33:38] doctrine course they had the same guy
