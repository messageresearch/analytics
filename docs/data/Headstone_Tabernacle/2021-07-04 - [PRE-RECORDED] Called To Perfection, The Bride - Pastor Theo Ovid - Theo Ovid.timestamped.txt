[30:16] no comments we have matthew chapter 5 1
[30:18] verse
[30:19] 48 we are first corinthians chapter 13
[30:23] verse 9 and 10. hebrews chapter 6 one
[30:26] verse was one
[30:27] thank you musicians my what's singing
[30:30] this morning
[30:32] my mind is blown uh sometime when i'm
[30:34] speaking or talking about old-fashioned
[30:36] or home-cooked fire when everybody
[30:39] brings the fire from home
[30:41] then they put it together in the church
[30:43] we have a real bonfire
[30:45] and i feel that that that's what we have
[30:47] this morning
[30:48] amen and i'm so appreciative of that
[30:52] that you are applying the word i could
[30:54] feel it feel the anointing
[30:57] my goodness oh we are grateful to god
[31:01] so reading matthew chapter five to read
[31:04] verse 48 be there for perfect
[31:09] even as your father which is in heaven
[31:12] is perfect and from first corinthians
[31:16] chapter 13
[31:18] 9-10 for we know in part
[31:22] and we prophesy in part but when that
[31:26] which is perfect
[31:27] is come then that which is in part
[31:30] shall be done away we also go to hebrews
[31:34] chapter
[31:35] 6 verse 1.
[31:39] therefore leaving the principles of the
[31:42] doctrine of christ
[31:44] let us go on unto perfection amen
[31:47] not laying again the foundation of
[31:49] repentance from dead works and of faith
[31:51] towards god
[31:52] let us pray father we thank you for the
[31:54] reading of your word
[31:56] any man could read the scriptures we
[31:58] have had scriptures read for so many
[31:59] years
[32:00] but it will take the holy ghost to come
[32:03] and anoint the word and breed
[32:04] life and fire and presence and power
[32:08] and deliverance and quicken the word to
[32:11] the people father made a ministry of the
[32:13] spirit be
[32:14] effective today in jesus name we ask it
[32:18] amen on amen before you have your seats
[32:20] i want to turn around and shake
[32:21] somebody's hands
[32:22] and greet somebody in jesus name just
[32:24] before you have your seats
[32:40] so
[32:44] oh glory you may be seated when you
[32:48] give the lord some praise
[32:57] it's always a privilege to be in the
[32:59] presence of god
[33:00] amen amen to be under the anointing
[33:03] of the spirit
[33:06] just think without the spirit of god
[33:09] we're just another
[33:10] group of people on a sunday morning just
[33:12] gathering together and meeting each
[33:14] other and
[33:14] shaking each other's hands when the
[33:17] spirit of god is here
[33:19] makes a whole difference in the entire
[33:22] world praise the lord
[33:27] there are some who in life are called
[33:29] into different vocations
[33:32] careers positions examples to be a
[33:35] writer a doctor
[33:36] teacher mechanic farmer an engineer
[33:39] father
[33:39] minister but besides all of that
[33:44] or in addition to that there's another
[33:47] calling
[33:49] a higher calling this call
[33:52] differentiates them from others this is
[33:56] a call
[33:57] to perfection
[34:00] there are some who are great family
[34:02] persons
[34:03] they genuinely love and care about the
[34:05] family but besides that
[34:08] they still remain a higher calling
[34:12] they are those who are content and
[34:14] satisfied nothing moves them
[34:16] nothing really inspires or motivates
[34:19] them they have it all figured out
[34:21] how it should be how they want it
[34:25] how they see it and according to where
[34:27] they are in life
[34:28] they control everything around them
[34:30] especially if they have money
[34:32] power and position
[34:37] there are those who are not fortunate to
[34:38] be in money power opposition
[34:40] life just swirls around them things
[34:44] happen
[34:44] to them and around them
[34:48] they're those who somebody always do
[34:50] them
[34:53] hurt them affect them
[34:57] stumble them hinder them
[35:00] they're those who choose to be lazy have
[35:03] no ambition
[35:04] no desire for anything life is just so
[35:06] so for them
[35:07] life just happens they are no better off
[35:10] in spirit
[35:11] and attitude and behavior after 5 10 15
[35:14] years
[35:16] they are the same person they always was
[35:20] all types go to church all say amen
[35:24] but there's a bunch of individuals among
[35:26] those
[35:28] who are called to perfection
[35:33] something drives them a purpose
[35:37] a deep an unexplained something
[35:41] that drives them to dig deeper climb
[35:44] higher
[35:45] press further certain key words
[35:49] connect to these types i press towards
[35:52] the mark
[35:53] forgetting the things that are passed i
[35:56] can do all things through christ
[35:59] let us go on to perfection aimlessly
[36:02] contending for the fate
[36:04] these are actionable words things to
[36:08] apply
[36:09] and effect change in one's life
[36:13] a call to perfection only the bride will
[36:16] have that call
[36:17] some are called to follow the message
[36:19] come and call to follow a church
[36:21] some are called to follow family follow
[36:24] a preacher
[36:25] or minister or church or congregation
[36:27] that they love
[36:29] take them out of that congregation they
[36:30] are lost they can't find happiness
[36:33] for them it's church choosing the
[36:36] minister of their chosen
[36:38] they have a real struggle to struggle
[36:40] they have a problem to accept
[36:43] praise god hallelujah that all things
[36:46] work together for good to them that
[36:47] love god hallelujah they have a problem
[36:51] to accept that nothing takes god by
[36:53] surprise
[36:54] god doesn't wave his eye open his eyes
[36:57] big like
[36:58] something surprising they have trouble
[37:00] accepting that nothing takes god
[37:02] by surprise hallelujah they have
[37:04] problems accepting trials
[37:06] except intestines except in tribulation
[37:09] they really don't want any of that
[37:13] god is not at the center point
[37:16] god is not your center point god is
[37:20] oh hallelujah money is
[37:25] god is not their center point the family
[37:28] is
[37:29] god is not your center point self is
[37:33] i me i god the word is a reference point
[37:38] it's like a dictionary a book that you
[37:40] check the meaning of the word sometimes
[37:42] there is no real burden to see god to
[37:45] see his power
[37:46] to see his glory there is no daily
[37:49] the life is a daily judge
[37:55] but there are some who are
[37:58] called to perfection
[38:00] [Music]
[38:02] and the title of the message this
[38:03] morning is called to perfection
[38:06] the bride that's my title this morning
[38:10] call
[38:11] to perfection the bride and an
[38:14] inspiration
[38:15] when that which is perfect it's come
[38:18] on
[38:24] i'm feeling good to be here tonight oh
[38:27] blessed be the name of the lord
[38:30] hallelujah so now we come down where the
[38:33] tire hits the road
[38:37] come down to the real deal know in part
[38:41] prophesying part accept a lot of things
[38:45] in part
[38:46] but there comes all when part is no
[38:48] longer
[38:50] you know good enough you see when
[38:53] you know when when when better is
[38:55] expected god is not good enough
[38:57] when it reaches where it's a standard
[38:59] and a requirement
[39:01] where it comes to the higher calling all
[39:03] of a sudden you find yourself naked
[39:06] you find yourself undone you find
[39:08] yourself needing to come up to meet god
[39:09] requirement
[39:11] that is what this means let us go on to
[39:13] perfection the bride
[39:15] being called to that perfection so it
[39:18] would mean
[39:19] allowing christ to move in every era of
[39:22] yourself and life
[39:24] i'm going to change those words allow in
[39:26] christ to invade
[39:28] your self life
[39:31] your human spirit not just have christ
[39:34] on a sunday morning the anointing in the
[39:36] presence and you
[39:37] you get a quote and you read get a
[39:39] scripture no no no but but it becomes a
[39:41] daily
[39:42] inventory a daily connecting with
[39:46] a daily receiving of and from now you
[39:48] understand why the prophet said
[39:50] read your bible and pray every day and
[39:52] you're going to grow
[39:54] hallelujah not live in church some
[39:56] people who they feel they could live in
[39:57] church the wichita churches have rooms
[40:01] where they could stay away from the
[40:02] devil
[40:05] away from trials the only hearing songs
[40:09] and psalms
[40:10] like angels singing harp playing
[40:17] but the bible said the trial of your
[40:19] faith being more
[40:22] precious
[40:28] inside the church some people go to
[40:30] church and get a fight
[40:32] i don't understand that i'm not going
[40:33] there but the thing of it is
[40:37] is when you leave here when you get out
[40:40] there
[40:41] then give god the opportunity
[40:44] and give the devil an opportunity to see
[40:46] what you hear and what you really
[40:49] [Applause]
[40:50] believe
[40:54] as far as devil concern you went to
[40:55] you're going to you you're going to hear
[40:57] things
[41:00] he's not even sure you believe those
[41:01] things you were hearing
[41:03] and he have a right to investigate that
[41:08] but god using him
[41:12] to fix you right
[41:15] you don't hear what i'm saying you're
[41:18] not hearing what i'm saying
[41:20] if you understand that you will thank
[41:22] god that the devil is a good adversary
[41:25] [Applause]
[41:31] and god made you worthy of combat
[41:35] you don't hear what i'm saying qualified
[41:39] to lose you under your doors put the new
[41:41] recruit up
[41:42] new recruit on the battlefield you have
[41:44] to get trained
[41:46] they're going to put you on lives
[41:49] that fulfill so really and truly it have
[41:54] no room
[41:55] to be children be no more children
[41:58] get your boots get your clothes
[42:02] because we are going somewhere
[42:09] oh glory to god so some point in time
[42:13] that which is perfect must come and then
[42:16] we have to step up now
[42:17] to meet up with it oh glory to god god
[42:20] we give the lord a shout
[42:23] hallelujah
[42:24] [Applause]
[42:26] says allowing the holy spirit to come
[42:29] and
[42:30] influence your human personality
[42:34] you living and walking and moving and
[42:36] applying
[42:38] the presence of god
[42:41] there are too many who contend just to
[42:43] be saved
[42:44] just to be messaged babies and they're
[42:47] looking for pampers every service under
[42:48] our purse
[42:53] it's not something there are doors
[42:56] nobody could tell them anything
[42:59] not even the husband wife
[43:02] not even the pastor they are truly on
[43:05] their own
[43:07] they want to run their life their own
[43:10] way
[43:12] by their own emotions by their own
[43:15] fancies whatever come whatever they want
[43:18] they want
[43:19] and if they don't get that they get
[43:20] they're going to attract it to a tantrum
[43:23] as if that's what children do you know
[43:25] that's what children do
[43:27] they throw tensions and you see god god
[43:29] have no time with that
[43:32] god will leave you in your tantrum and
[43:34] when you finish you still god
[43:40] god will leave you in trouble and when
[43:41] you finish he is still god
[43:43] until you understand he has no time with
[43:45] that because the whole creation is
[43:47] groaning
[43:48] struggling travailing for the
[43:51] manifestation
[43:52] of not children of the sons of god
[43:55] when born sons mature sons responsible
[43:59] sons
[44:00] qualified sons anointed sons trained
[44:03] sons
[44:03] sons who fail and rise back up some who
[44:06] get knocked back down
[44:07] and knock up and come back up all rugged
[44:09] sons gutsy sons
[44:11] overcoming sons sons you're not afraid
[44:14] to fail
[44:15] because failure doesn't make you a
[44:16] failure
[44:18] feeling doesn't make you a failure
[44:22] healing doesn't make you a failure
[44:26] or give the lord a shout we have a word
[44:30] from the lord for you today
[44:35] [Applause]
[44:45] [Applause]
[44:45] [Music]
[44:47] i'll repeat that you must want
[44:51] an experience with god said so
[44:59] i don't care what your feelings tell you
[45:01] it's what god said
[45:03] you have to experience the word against
[45:05] your feelings
[45:07] the word against your emotions the word
[45:10] against your better judgment
[45:12] [Applause]
[45:16] did you get that if isaiah
[45:20] was studying his thinking and his mind
[45:22] when god said
[45:23] say of what he shall conceive as i would
[45:26] say
[45:27] as i was saying could you repeat that
[45:33] but isaiah was in that mood when god's
[45:36] approaching you conceived he shall force
[45:37] you to conceive
[45:39] how could that virgin could you did you
[45:42] show you
[45:42] me do you really want me to
[45:47] to say that no no these guys
[45:50] not using the head that this holy man
[45:53] moved
[45:54] but by the holy ghost the holy ghost by
[45:57] passing the head
[45:58] and striking the heart and the heart
[46:00] going to the mouth
[46:02] to speak the word right out so these
[46:04] guys was only speaking what god put
[46:07] upon the heart one time a man come and
[46:10] say speak
[46:11] speak what everybody else say and he
[46:12] said i want to speak what god put in my
[46:14] mouth
[46:15] i cannot speak what i feel to speak i
[46:18] gospe god not allowing me to do that
[46:20] because the word comes to me the word of
[46:22] the lord
[46:23] came to jeremiah the word of the lord
[46:25] came to ezekiel the word of the lord it
[46:28] comes to them
[46:29] bypass their mind dropping their heart
[46:31] as a thought
[46:32] and when they speak it it expresses a
[46:40] word
[46:42] [Music]
[46:48] are you ready for some more we talk
[46:51] about perfection and
[46:52] some people freeze but i'm not talking
[46:54] about sinless
[46:56] perfection let the word tell you
[46:59] about this thing called perfection
[47:03] from god's provided way no righteous man
[47:07] is not a sinless man
[47:14] for if you notice he said elijah was a
[47:17] man
[47:18] subject to like passions as we are
[47:22] he had his ups and downs his
[47:25] defaults differences and the scripture
[47:29] of his life proves
[47:30] he had his ups and downs like we do but
[47:33] he had times of wondering
[47:34] his times that his temper got away from
[47:36] him he had lots of things that went
[47:38] wrong
[47:39] but he was still a righteous man
[47:42] because he confessed his unworthiness
[47:46] and believed in god so that is what made
[47:50] him
[47:50] righteous
[47:57] we are not righteous within ourselves
[48:01] we are righteous through jesus christ
[48:04] i cannot be sanctified within myself
[48:08] i am sanctified through jesus christ who
[48:11] stands in the presence of god
[48:13] in my place
[48:16] it isn't my holiness it's his holiness
[48:20] my holiness won't work at all but his
[48:23] does
[48:23] because god done accepted him and in
[48:26] accepting him
[48:28] he had to accept me because i am in him
[48:34] and that's what make it real
[48:37] [Music]
[48:38] then we don't have to depend on
[48:40] ourselves now that doesn't make us to
[48:42] say we can sin brother if you sin
[48:44] you just gotta be from god that's all
[48:46] there's only one thing to do confess it
[48:48] get right with god as long as you desire
[48:51] to sin
[48:52] this desire of sin is still in your
[48:54] heart then it's time for you to stay
[48:56] at the altar till that thing is taken
[48:58] out now you will sin
[49:00] you are bound to sin cause you just
[49:01] can't help it not willful sin
[49:03] but he that sins willfully after receive
[49:05] the knowledge of truth they remain no
[49:07] sacrifice for sin
[49:08] but every day you're born to sin you are
[49:10] born to be backslidden constantly
[49:13] so it takes a constant prayer to god
[49:16] that's why paul said i die
[49:19] daily and if paul had to die daily
[49:22] how much more am i going to have to stay
[49:25] and dead
[49:26] all the time if paul had to die daily to
[49:29] stay right with god
[49:30] we all have to do that to die out to
[49:33] ourselves
[49:33] and that is getting god's way oh can we
[49:37] give the lord some praises people
[49:39] hallelujah and there's only two ways of
[49:41] doing anything
[49:42] that's the right way and the wrong way
[49:44] and them ways are your ways
[49:46] and god ways and you can't be in your
[49:48] way and god we at the same time
[49:50] you've got to forget your own way to get
[49:52] into god's way and you've got to get out
[49:54] of your own way to get in god's way
[49:56] as long as you're in your own way you're
[49:58] out of history
[49:59] so forsake your way forsake your
[50:01] thoughts forsake everything
[50:03] and rely on just say the lord and then
[50:05] you know you're right
[50:09] though you can't see it none of the
[50:12] sensibility is right
[50:14] every one of them will say it's wrong
[50:16] but you know what
[50:17] it's right because god said so
[50:20] amen so you are rejecting and denying
[50:23] and giving
[50:24] your senses trouble your sense is boring
[50:27] you know
[50:28] but you are saying god
[50:31] set you up god's provided way for
[50:35] humans is to live not by your senses
[50:38] but by his word because humans was given
[50:41] these five senses
[50:42] to contact them here but a different
[50:45] sense was given to contact
[50:47] up there god put man his own image and
[50:50] god is a supernatural being
[50:51] he was a supernatural man and none of
[50:53] those five senses declare his heavenly
[50:55] home
[50:56] so those five senses the food they said
[50:58] nice that does not mean
[50:59] they haven't really have any home you're
[51:01] touching this you're feeling this and
[51:02] your emotions
[51:03] don't do what you have only home or what
[51:05] you're feeling experience in these five
[51:07] senses it's for down here
[51:10] could we give the lord some praises are
[51:12] you with me
[51:13] so these five senses control the human
[51:15] body and two senses control the inside
[51:18] man
[51:18] faith and unbelief you've possessed one
[51:21] or the other
[51:23] oh my i think it's a good thing in
[51:25] florida
[51:26] somebody's death was three monkeys one
[51:28] of them had his hand over his eyes
[51:30] see no evil or the one on his fingers
[51:32] over his ears hear no evil
[51:34] the other one had it over his mouth
[51:35] speak no evil i think that's a good
[51:37] thing
[51:38] you keep your mind pure on christ no you
[51:40] see
[51:41] if you don't watch you will get yourself
[51:43] over into a place
[51:44] and thinking you would you you can't
[51:46] live listen
[51:47] you can't live so perfect till you don't
[51:51] make that mistake now
[51:53] don't you think you'll ever get that way
[51:55] you are not sinless
[51:57] and you are certainly you will certainly
[51:59] get off of the track
[52:00] on this side or that side but a man that
[52:03] wants knock down if he's a real sawyer
[52:05] he'll rise up again
[52:07] so don't ever talk about a man knock dog
[52:09] knock down
[52:10] oh you're not don't come yet
[52:14] maybe you still crawling yes i don't
[52:17] walk yet
[52:18] that's why you ain't full yet but once
[52:21] you are managed eight
[52:23] you'll get knocked down hear what the
[52:25] prophet said
[52:26] lord let me rise and try again but a
[52:28] coward
[52:29] as soon as he sees he make a little
[52:30] mistake like the bug on the water spider
[52:33] will go right back in the water again
[52:35] so that's why some people they don't
[52:37] ever get criticism
[52:39] because it doesn't they do nothing
[52:44] they try nothing they affect nothing
[52:47] they stand for nothing
[52:48] they're just like a dish rag everybody
[52:50] loves them
[52:52] they have trouble with no hope howdy
[52:54] they are very good and nice
[52:55] if they pre-see them you play spring
[52:57] with holy water
[52:58] they'll make them an acolyte in the
[53:00] church or whatever it is
[53:02] nobody troubles them nobody bothers them
[53:04] they bother nobody
[53:05] they're just nasty nicey
[53:09] but anytime you try to do something
[53:10] there's always going to be opposition
[53:12] always going to be criticism for the
[53:14] kingdom of god you think the devil just
[53:16] lays back and said oh
[53:17] go ahead uh god bless you the devil and
[53:20] god bless you
[53:22] god already bless you what a pronounced
[53:24] blessing on the devil

[53:33] recognize truly romans 8 28 apply
[53:36] and we know we know we know if others
[53:38] don't know we know
[53:39] that all things not some things all
[53:41] things do you believe that
[53:43] you could say amen to that but do you
[53:44] really believe that because when things
[53:46] happen
[53:47] you don't believe it
[53:48] [Applause]
[53:50] because your behavior demonstrates you
[53:52] don't believe it

[53:55] your commenting then go in hand and when
[53:56] you find single you'll take it back out

[55:08] that you believe that word
[55:11] [Applause]
[55:12] when you don't say amen the devil says
[55:15] in you
[55:17] amen it's you confirming the word to be
[55:21] god

[56:54] amen he doesn't see you no more than
[56:56] sinner
[56:58] he sees you as redeemed you're redeemed
[57:02] because he is always
[57:04] he always i miss that word he always
[57:07] sees you through christ
[57:09] that's the reason we can be perfect
[57:11] [Music]
[57:13] not perfect nose perfect mouth perfect
[57:16] teeth
[57:17] you will get perfect wrinkles perfect
[57:19] ball head perfect gray hair
[57:21] and you will go to a perfect grave so
[57:23] forget about it we are not talking about
[57:25] this physical
[57:26] thing this natural thing we're not
[57:29] talking about that
[57:42] not perfect in the sense of sinless
[57:46] we are perfect in the eyes of god
[57:50] when we are in christ that's the reason
[57:53] be there for perfect as your father miss
[57:55] perfect
[57:56] he doesn't mean walk with a long gun and
[57:59] a beard and do your hand like that
[58:01] he doesn't mean that
[58:04] it means you are gonna be in him
[58:21] when he died at calvary he made a win he
[58:24] gave up his spirit the holy spirit
[58:26] sent it back on the earth for you to
[58:28] live by that's what calvary means
[58:30] to us to follow him
[58:34] okay now we have got to accept it and to
[58:36] accept it is to accept his personal in
[58:39] our hearts
[58:40] then we are free from sin the perfect
[58:42] sacrifice made us perfect
[58:44] for jesus said be there for perfect even
[58:46] as your father is perfect
[58:48] there is no more to be done but we are
[58:51] made perfect in the presence of god
[58:55] now dear is where we lose our position
[58:58] if we don't watch we try to look back to
[59:01] what we was
[59:03] and as long as we look back to what we
[59:05] was the sacrifice means nothing to us
[59:08] you know i come like you're a smoker
[59:10] you're a drinker you're a real terrible
[59:11] person
[59:12] and god come in as mercy and love and
[59:13] they get saved they get baptized and you
[59:15] have oh simply wash my sins away
[59:17] and leave your burden down my riverside
[59:18] and so on carry them no more
[59:20] and you're feeling in love with christ
[59:22] all the birds all the birds looking
[59:24] fresh on you
[59:26] everybody's bred people hugging you and
[59:29] loving you and whatnot
[59:31] after a few tries and what time the fun
[59:32] thing you feel is so strong
[59:34] you start to make your point so they get
[59:36] arrogant and whatnot and afterwards
[59:38] afterwards something happens next inside
[59:39] look at yourself and you start to
[59:40] perfect yourself
[59:42] you start to think for yourself and
[59:43] carry them about yourself that's not
[59:45] what god wants
[59:46] he wants you dependent on him surrender
[59:48] to him
[59:50] heal it to him he'll love you just when
[59:52] you first come to the lord
[59:56] you know take a little baby and say baby
[59:57] walk
[59:59] people can talk
[1:00:03] god ain't taking no christian baby no
[1:00:05] small babe in christ and say walk
[1:00:07] speak the word you can't talk you don't
[1:00:09] even know what god say
[1:00:12] so as far as god is concerned it's
[1:00:14] bottle of milk for you
[1:00:15] the sincere milk of the world that's
[1:00:17] what you need until you grow in god
[1:00:19] that you can handle more stuff
[1:00:23] as you go is that less stuff is more
[1:00:26] amen because we want more from you we
[1:00:29] are at the end of the age
[1:00:31] at the end of time we want manifestation
[1:00:34] from you that means we have to become
[1:00:37] the word
[1:00:38] we have to become like christ you have
[1:00:40] to walk i can talk i can act like
[1:00:42] him we have to be perfect like him
[1:00:46] not sinless perfection oh give the lord
[1:00:56] so watch
[1:00:59] can you see a church i would not try the
[1:01:02] job
[1:01:03] there's no need of trying you're lost to
[1:01:05] begin with
[1:01:06] as long as you look at what you've done
[1:01:08] but don't look to what you've done
[1:01:10] look at what calvary did for you it paid
[1:01:13] your price
[1:01:14] it settled the question your sins be a
[1:01:17] scarlet
[1:01:17] they'll be white as snow red like
[1:01:19] crimson white like wool
[1:01:21] then you have no sin you're perfectly
[1:01:23] sinners no matter what you have done
[1:01:25] or what you do you're still sinless as
[1:01:28] long as you have accepted
[1:01:30] jesus christ as your savior your sins
[1:01:32] are forgiven
[1:01:33] anything that's forgiven is remitted and
[1:01:35] forgot about
[1:01:36] hallelujah what does it do
[1:01:40] it gives you after the condition his
[1:01:41] spirit to follow him
[1:01:43] and do as he did he was just one man
[1:01:47] a perfect man he gave his life he made
[1:01:50] an example for you
[1:01:51] that we must do the first i want to say
[1:01:53] is jesus here we go
[1:01:55] never live for himself so as we say this
[1:01:58] you have to examine you
[1:02:01] jesus never lived for himself his life
[1:02:03] was spent for others
[1:02:05] that's perfect eternal life when you
[1:02:09] say you go to church and you do good
[1:02:12] things that's fine
[1:02:13] but when you live your life to yourself
[1:02:15] you haven't eternal life
[1:02:17] eternal life is living for others
[1:02:26] husband love your wife that is for your
[1:02:27] wife
[1:02:29] wife or be a husband or respect your
[1:02:32] husband and reference your husband
[1:02:33] that is for your wife so i will salute
[1:02:36] all those sisters who
[1:02:37] find yourself their spirit in the bible
[1:02:43] your husband could testify about your
[1:02:45] subjection about your behavior
[1:02:47] on your attitude if god gave your
[1:02:49] husband to correct your papers he have

[1:05:00] by his sinless nature now look how let's
[1:05:02] go deep
[1:05:03] notice his sinless nature expressed what
[1:05:06] he was
[1:05:07] if his sinless nature god

[1:05:27] nature is evil
[1:05:29] in case you forget let me remind you
[1:05:32] that we were born in sin and
[1:05:36] i know sometimes we forget that because
[1:05:38] we we go to church and we are christians
[1:05:40] amen amen glory but i want to remind you
[1:05:42] that you were born in sin
[1:05:44] and shaped in iniquity and happened to
[1:05:47] come into the world
[1:05:48] without your mother teaching you
[1:05:49] speaking lies
[1:05:52] and that is because of a nature issue

[1:05:59] that nature issue
[1:06:01] that you can be transformed and and

[1:13:42] losing your eyes i'm making a jail
[1:13:44] sentence and coming out and save god and

[1:15:02] how much you try to i like this word
[1:15:04] indocumented with other things
[1:15:05] that's another word but there's the
[1:15:08] prophet word
[1:15:09] in documenting other things it's got to
[1:15:11] become sinless like he was
[1:15:14] then god's word can flow through it
[1:15:17] that's a big one he is saying we've got
[1:15:20] to become sinless like he was
[1:15:21] let's go down deeper that don't mean
[1:15:24] perfection in yourself
[1:15:26] you can't beat that
[1:15:27] [Music]

[1:15:50] do that
[1:15:51] you have to overcome you have to fight
[1:15:53] you have to get off your laziness and
[1:15:54] say you know what
[1:15:55] enough is enough deadness finish

[1:16:02] mind has to transform
[1:16:04] god transform my mind
[1:16:07] [Applause]
[1:16:10] hallelujah glory
[1:16:13] amen sinless need to express the word of
[1:16:16] god so much
[1:16:18] that he and the word was one he said i
[1:16:20] and my father are one
[1:16:21] i ordered that which pleases and my
[1:16:23] father one he was so perfect in the
[1:16:24] image of god
[1:16:25] until he and god was expressed the same
[1:16:28] thing he was the flesh the son
[1:16:30] expressed the deity of god so that made
[1:16:32] him deity and man
[1:16:33] in order to redeem man he and the word
[1:16:35] was one
[1:16:36] now i am not sinless but a random
[1:16:38] speaker
[1:16:40] i've got plenty hanging on me
[1:16:43] and every hour i confess it constantly
[1:16:47] now that has to do with all with
[1:16:48] relationship with god

[1:33:16] oh glory to god somebody give the lord a
[1:33:20] shelter praise
[1:33:31] [Applause]
[1:33:35] jesus
[1:33:36] [Music]
[1:33:39] he was the word in full the word of god
[1:33:43] flow to him so freely
[1:33:44] that he could speak the word it will
[1:33:46] create
[1:33:48] amen that's how powerful it was
[1:33:51] through jesus and he knew it when at
[1:33:54] lazarus did he said father i pray i know
[1:33:55] you always hear me
[1:33:57] but for those are wrong and so he knew
[1:34:01] he knew the power of his words when the
[1:34:04] lazarus is dead
[1:34:05] and he said he's sleeping i go wake him
[1:34:07] he he knew
[1:34:08] he knew the power of of the words in his
[1:34:11] mouth
[1:34:11] it was so powerful one day he said back
[1:34:14] and forth
[1:34:15] have not have not earth will pass away
[1:34:17] but my words will
[1:34:18] never pass but that's the power that was
[1:34:21] in his mouth
[1:34:22] and that coming to the sons of god in
[1:34:25] the last days
[1:34:26] so how would god entrust men with such
[1:34:30] power if they have no character
[1:34:36] some men don't like me you know what
[1:34:37] they will do speak me out of existence
[1:34:44] they will say i ain't like to you of it
[1:34:46] disappear
[1:34:49] it's only that right now when they speak
[1:34:50] them things it just their words just
[1:34:53] disappearing
[1:34:54] because there's a human god not even
[1:34:57] bothered with that
[1:34:58] god not even honoring that so i could
[1:35:00] see the burden of god
[1:35:02] all these years was to get his word
[1:35:05] in his people because he really want to
[1:35:08] entrust you with power

[1:35:25] god is getting excited
[1:35:28] [Applause]
[1:35:32] did you get that god himself
[1:35:35] is getting excited because the pleasure
[1:35:38] his pleasure
[1:35:39] is being fulfilled when is his sons
[1:35:42] coming into maturity
[1:35:45] sons coming in character sons with the
[1:35:48] burden of the word
[1:35:50] with the burden of god i always do that
[1:35:53] which pleases my father
[1:35:58] sometime i was preaching how could you
[1:36:00] please god if you don't know his will
[1:36:02] if your dog go into his word how will
[1:36:04] you know his will you need to get the
[1:36:06] word to know his will
[1:36:07] because his word reveals his will and
[1:36:09] that is how you please him
[1:36:11] you can say please and god lord that's
[1:36:13] the whole thing with with um abel and

[1:37:41] [Applause]
[1:37:46] hallelujah what did prophet say about
[1:37:49] adoption
[1:37:50] he wanted to say there is my
[1:37:54] spirit flowing freely

[1:38:28] love for truth allah for what is right
[1:38:31] allah for what is principle
[1:38:37] glory oh we are different
[1:38:40] amen you know that right
[1:38:45] so he was perfect in harmony with him
[1:38:48] and the word was so perfectly until he
[1:38:49] created
[1:38:50] whatever he done here and the word
[1:38:51] become one he
[1:38:53] the bridegroom took away your shame amen
[1:38:56] and put it in the sea of forgetfulness
[1:38:59] by the washing of the water of the word
[1:39:01] of god
[1:39:03] hallelujah listen so now we understand
[1:39:06] is not sinless perfection now we
[1:39:09] understand
[1:39:10] righteousness doesn't mean no sin in
[1:39:13] that sense because the confession is
[1:39:14] through the blood
[1:39:15] through christ now you're gonna get this
[1:39:18] quote let me see what they're gonna do
[1:39:19] for you
[1:39:20] this is from invisible unity bride he
[1:39:22] said you are standing
[1:39:24] completely justified as though you never
[1:39:27] did it at the beginning

[1:39:43] hear the comment of the combine
[1:39:45] you are standing complete justified not
[1:39:48] forgiven
[1:39:49] this is a bigger word than forgiven
[1:39:51] justify means you never did it
[1:39:57] so when satan bring up his his
[1:39:59] confirmation sheet
[1:40:01] and the evidence of all what he recorded
[1:40:03] you doing with his tape recorder
[1:40:04] because he videotaping and he's accusing

[1:48:29] we're not supposed to be we're not
[1:48:31] supposed to be addressing death
[1:48:33] we're not supposed to be preaching to

[1:49:10] amen to be blindsided
[1:49:13] you don't have full information that you
[1:49:16] could be sidetracked
[1:49:17] and knocked off the position that you're
[1:49:19] in if the devil could get you to believe
[1:49:21] your sword is a butter knife
[1:49:23] then they wouldn't use it as a sword you
[1:49:25] see that long thing you have there that
[1:49:26] could do a good button and look the
[1:49:28] badgering here look at the blue burning

[1:49:36] and button your bread quite here so use
[1:49:39] a butter knife for that
[1:49:41] but when you understand the word is a
[1:49:43] sword and when you pick it in the hand
[1:49:45] the hand of faith is what going to
[1:49:48] conquer that devil and recognize

[1:50:56] oh hallelujah praise god
[1:51:00] i'm going to try to wrap up here at home
[1:51:01] stretch
[1:51:03] sin john 16.
[1:51:06] 12 jesus speaks
[1:51:10] i have many things to say unto you but
[1:51:12] you cannot
[1:51:14] bear them now i like that
[1:51:18] in other words i wouldn't waste my time
[1:51:20] talking stuff
[1:51:21] to you now that you can't handle
[1:51:25] how be it when he he
[1:51:28] the spirit of truth is come he
[1:51:31] will guide you into all truth
[1:51:35] for he shall not speak of himself but
[1:51:39] whatsoever he shall hear
[1:51:41] that shall he speak and he will show you
[1:51:43] things to come
[1:51:45] he shall glorify me for he shall receive
[1:51:48] of mine
[1:51:49] and shall show it unto you all things
[1:51:52] that the father hath are mine
[1:51:53] therefore said i that he shall take of
[1:51:55] mine and shall show it
[1:51:57] unto you first corinthians 2 6
[1:52:01] to 8 how we do speak wisdom among them
[1:52:04] that are perfect
[1:52:05] yet not the wisdom of this world nor the
[1:52:07] princes of this world that come to know
[1:52:09] it
[1:52:09] but we speak wisdom of god in a mystery
[1:52:13] even the hidden wisdom which god
[1:52:15] ordained before the world unto her glory
[1:52:17] which none of the princes of this world
[1:52:19] knew for had they known it they would
[1:52:21] not have crucified the lord of glory
[1:52:23] if they knew it if they knew it they
[1:52:26] wouldn't crucify the effect of the word
[1:52:28] upon the people because we supposed to
[1:52:30] be looking for a seven thunderbird
[1:52:32] revival
[1:52:33] if they knew it they wouldn't crucify
[1:52:34] the effect of the seven seal upon the
[1:52:36] people if they knew it they wouldn't
[1:52:37] crucify this message the way they have
[1:52:39] and reduces the denominational
[1:52:41] denomination where you just have the
[1:52:43] books and the tips and the prophets and
[1:52:44] man just say a few things
[1:52:46] couldn't have done that listen to what
[1:52:49] abraham said marginally voice
[1:52:51] know that the seals are open
[1:52:54] amen the spirit of truth directs us to
[1:52:59] the word
[1:53:01] give the lord a praise did you hear that
[1:53:05] okay write with me for the home stretch
[1:53:06] now know that the seas are open
[1:53:09] what the spirit of truth because
[1:53:12] remember this image has come from
[1:53:13] trinity to gather the scattered word
[1:53:15] to tie it back into the word to bring
[1:53:17] down the holy ghost
[1:53:18] so the holy ghost is to open the seals
[1:53:20] which was the spirit of truth
[1:53:22] released to all the earth so he is
[1:53:24] saying now that the seas are open
[1:53:26] the spirit of truth directs us to the
[1:53:28] word that explain all the mystics made
[1:53:30] down to the ages
[1:53:34] god never did have any time a group of
[1:53:37] men to run his church
[1:53:39] it's always been the holy spirit amen
[1:53:41] the holy spirit that's the teacher
[1:53:44] when this prayer that you just come he
[1:53:46] will guide you
[1:53:47] into all truth the holy ghost alone
[1:53:50] is the divine revealer of the divine
[1:53:53] revelation of christ
[1:53:55] the holy ghost alone so therefore it
[1:53:58] disconnects this
[1:53:59] top man teacher man best man
[1:54:02] more educated man more limited man or
[1:54:05] more
[1:54:06] revelated man amen we know that's not a
[1:54:08] word but that is what he's talking about
[1:54:10] he is more revelated he has more
[1:54:12] revelation
[1:54:16] so he's the man of the hour
[1:54:19] yet the bible talk about doctrines of
[1:54:21] devils
[1:54:22] the devil's bringing doctrines to teach
[1:54:25] no more talking no more lies than
[1:54:26] manifest you believe this you
[1:54:27] don't really get out of it we believe we
[1:54:29] believe we believe
[1:54:32] like as if the detention when they shall
[1:54:33] come they just say we believe we believe
[1:54:41] we believe no all was commissioned is
[1:54:45] when i see the blood i'll pass over
[1:54:48] so all them were teaching and adopting
[1:54:50] and the the vets
[1:54:51] because because the vets because we're
[1:54:55] not riding with deduction and teachers
[1:54:56] it's foolishness could you live in
[1:54:59] london england
[1:55:00] tell them when imagine any businesses
[1:55:02] had the right and
[1:55:04] and and and they tighten up and whatnot
[1:55:05] somebody come with some coach somebody
[1:55:07] quoting a prophet in last days
[1:55:10] the beast will lick them up yeah man you
[1:55:13] can't go on with beast's
[1:55:14] system after 50 plus years and talk
[1:55:16] about ghosts look
[1:55:19] tell them in london you have to become
[1:55:20] the book by then
[1:55:23] it's beast power you know it's a force
[1:55:26] in you know
[1:55:27] understand this it wasn't easy for those
[1:55:29] two boys
[1:55:30] to say we will not bow down we still
[1:55:33] praying
[1:55:34] they took a stand they were working with
[1:55:36] the government and they took a stand and
[1:55:37] they take the penalty of it
[1:55:39] fiery furnace they don't care you can be
[1:55:41] the best worker the best this when
[1:55:43] pressure compression come laws come
[1:55:45] laws come america being wrapped up in
[1:55:47] laws they're creating the laws that they
[1:55:49] could shut down the churches
[1:55:50] they're creating the laws fixing up
[1:55:52] homosexuals freaking out transgender
[1:55:54] fixing up everybody else it's an agenda
[1:55:57] loose by the devil
[1:55:59] to ensure those christians are squeezed
[1:56:01] out
[1:56:02] according to prophecy that no man buy or
[1:56:05] sell unless they take the mark of the
[1:56:06] peace
[1:56:07] so they sit here and watch on me
[1:56:08] something is moving something is turning
[1:56:11] but when that bit is perfect is come we
[1:56:13] have a higher calling
[1:56:19] hallelujah it's easy to join the church
[1:56:22] you could leave this one and join that
[1:56:24] one and join that one that's easy
[1:56:27] but to answer the call to perfection
[1:56:30] that's different you got yourself that's
[1:56:33] mean you're gonna
[1:56:34] get your life shake up but ram said this
[1:56:37] way it means a lot of shaking down for
[1:56:39] me
[1:56:39] it means a lot of shaking down for you
[1:56:41] but together we gonna make it
[1:56:43] by the grace of god
[1:56:47] perfection means shake up hallelujah
[1:56:51] you cannot continue as you are oh my
[1:57:00] we are grateful to you to know we are
[1:57:02] living in the last days just before the
[1:57:03] coming of just one
[1:57:05] that wonderful glorious loving son of
[1:57:07] yours our lord and savior jesus christ
[1:57:09] who we love
[1:57:10] and we know the bible speaks of an
[1:57:12] appearing before
[1:57:14] the coming listen good this is good
[1:57:18] did you hear that the bible speaks of
[1:57:20] the appearance
[1:57:22] before they're coming and there's a
[1:57:25] difference in the word appearing and
[1:57:27] then coming
[1:57:28] now further we realize that the church
[1:57:31] has come through the stage of
[1:57:32] justification
[1:57:33] come to the stage of sanctification come
[1:57:35] to the stage of receiving the holy
[1:57:36] spirit now
[1:57:37] the stones are being owned for the
[1:57:39] fitting of the ministry of jesus christ
[1:57:44] so god has to cut men to fit that
[1:57:49] god had cut in the military to fit the
[1:57:51] man god cut into man
[1:57:54] to fit the ministry
[1:57:57] and every man i caught you good enough
[1:57:59] he can't fit
[1:58:03] because he had to be fitted in oh give
[1:58:05] the lord some praise people
[1:58:09] now remember appearing uncommon is two
[1:58:12] different words
[1:58:13] to appear and then to come no is the
[1:58:16] appearing
[1:58:18] he already appeared in these last days
[1:58:19] right here with us in the last few years
[1:58:21] no it's a sign of his coming he's
[1:58:24] appearing in his church
[1:58:26] so we could talk to him if he blew in
[1:58:27] the face we have to see jesus appear
[1:58:29] among us
[1:58:31] then we can talk about christ coming he
[1:58:34] has to appear
[1:58:35] so why all these years ministry of the
[1:58:38] word books and tapes and rules and
[1:58:40] and whatnot but now it has to turn
[1:58:44] into the spirit of god and you have to
[1:58:46] create the atmosphere
[1:58:47] you have to want it in your house you
[1:58:49] have to want this fire in your house
[1:58:51] you have to warn the anointing in your
[1:58:53] house praise god not hollywood the
[1:58:55] anointing
[1:58:56] the dove the pillar of fire the holy
[1:58:59] ghost
[1:59:00] you have to want that at your supper
[1:59:02] table at your dinner table
[1:59:04] in the bedroom in the join room in the
[1:59:06] kitchen behind the house
[1:59:07] all around you want to be walking with
[1:59:10] god
[1:59:10] [Applause]
[1:59:13] don't shake your head say amen
[1:59:18] [Applause]
[1:59:22] now christ is appearing in these last
[1:59:24] days in his church here we go
[1:59:26] bringing here the purpose of the
[1:59:28] appearance bringing his church together

[2:01:32] one time a woman feeling like the prefer
[2:01:34] baby next to her one other child
[2:01:36] was sick and then we become a prayer
[2:01:39] line something like that
[2:01:40] and brahma said the word woman uh she
[2:01:42] said woman the woman prayed for her
[2:01:45] because god know that women have more
[2:01:47] compassion than him
[2:01:48] the baby is healed watch it's not bad
[2:01:51] around healing the people
[2:01:52] is the holy spirit god put a burden on a
[2:01:55] woman to pray for that child
[2:01:57] and god use that burden to channel
[2:02:01] you see the word is a conductor of the
[2:02:03] spirit
[2:02:04] god has to have a channel to ride on
[2:02:07] right through
[2:02:09] god want your mouth god wants your eyes
[2:02:10] god wants your ears god wants your
[2:02:12] clothes god want you
[2:02:14] you you oh give the lord some praises
[2:02:19] god want to use you
[2:02:22] i'm not hearing you god really want to
[2:02:25] use you
[2:02:34] you see the true revelation too tight
[2:02:37] three women
[2:02:38] sarah higa
[2:02:42] and mary three women isn't that right
[2:02:46] mary brought the virgin but produce
[2:02:48] jesus christ
[2:02:49] three denominational ages carriers which
[2:02:52] must die
[2:02:53] and dry up just like the shock and so
[2:02:55] forth have to give room for the seed
[2:02:57] the seed cannot get ripe until the shock
[2:03:01] stalk leaves all dry
[2:03:03] it saps the very life of it out of them
[2:03:06] so that is why after a while the
[2:03:08] anointing began to drop everywhere
[2:03:10] because the bride started absorb the
[2:03:13] anointing
[2:03:14] because the bride becomes the word the
[2:03:16] seed
[2:03:18] that is why you're so well connected
[2:03:21] scripture connected
[2:03:22] bible connected because the pentecostals
[2:03:25] ah
[2:03:26] they couldn't come to perfection with
[2:03:27] the gifts they rejected the prophet who
[2:03:30] brought the word
[2:03:31] so the pentecostal couldn't go on to
[2:03:32] maturity so god leave them there with
[2:03:34] their gifts and they have big churches
[2:03:36] millionaire empires i'm going to leave
[2:03:38] them there with that so god decided to
[2:03:40] call it a bunch of people
[2:03:42] a bunch of people that couldn't be
[2:03:44] bribed
[2:03:45] he called it bite material that he
[2:03:47] wanted to cut out from
[2:03:50] glory to god hallelujah so god come like
[2:03:53] god wrote about the cloth
[2:03:55] i said this is the material i'm going to
[2:03:56] use i can't use neutrons
[2:03:59] i can use wesleyans archaic pentecostals
[2:04:02] and bring out a word message to roll out
[2:04:04] this ball to court
[2:04:06] and out of a group of the two seed of
[2:04:07] the world out of this court
[2:04:10] i'm going to cut out the bride a pyramid

[2:11:15] service
[2:11:16] we're coming to prepare for the wedding
[2:11:17] supper the world prepared for our
[2:11:19] funeral
[2:11:19] service the world going downhill we
[2:11:22] prepare for our wedding supper
[2:11:24] glory to god you might be seated whether
[2:11:26] or not john preached here
[2:11:27] he said when they grew up in the
[2:11:28] astronaut they have to rehearse down
[2:11:30] here
[2:11:31] never go in a tube with the witnesses
[2:11:33] and float on walker
[2:11:35] then i get trained to that because up
[2:11:37] they don't have uh gravity and so on
[2:11:39] so whenever when you have your milk or a
[2:11:40] bottle of juice it flying away from you
[2:11:43] floating in the air so if you never test
[2:11:45] that and experience that
[2:11:46] when you go up in space and you see your
[2:11:48] food flying
[2:11:50] say lord have mercy i will starve
[2:11:54] but they train them on earth in that
[2:11:57] weightless environment
[2:11:58] so when the food fallen around you have
[2:11:59] to know how to put your hand how to
[2:12:01] drink
[2:12:02] or when the water fell through in slow
[2:12:04] motion
[2:12:06] you have to know all of that when you
[2:12:08] get that skill then you're ready to go
[2:12:09] up
[2:12:10] so therefore your muscles are still down
[2:12:11] here before you go up
[2:12:14] you must cast off some devils you must
[2:12:16] heal some sick
[2:12:17] they must raise some death you must ah
[2:12:20] come on now come on now
[2:12:22] you must handle a beer you must deal
[2:12:25] with a lion
[2:12:26] then you can say good luck i'm coming
[2:12:28] for your head
[2:12:39] my mom

[2:12:53] time ago

[2:14:37] been formed
[2:14:40] after the test has been formed after the
[2:14:43] grain has come unto the cub
[2:14:45] then it has to come to perfection
[2:14:51] so you kind of took perfection until you
[2:14:54] see green
[2:14:58] perfection can be preached to stalk
[2:15:00] perfection can be piece of the
[2:15:02] hub it has to be the green once you come

[2:15:26] to the original grain
[2:15:28] it has to come back to the original
[2:15:31] laodicean
[2:15:32] notice this false vine come into full
[2:15:35] fruition in his age
[2:15:37] her fruit would mature and ripen
[2:15:40] that is correct this evil spirited
[2:15:42] church full of iniquity
[2:15:44] will be revealed as the mustard seed
[2:15:46] that grew into a tree wherein large the
[2:15:48] falls of the air
[2:15:49] at her head will be antichrist the
[2:15:52] mystery of iniquity
[2:15:53] all this is true and if this is true
[2:15:56] then it must also be true that the
[2:15:59] bright
[2:16:00] church will mature
[2:16:03] and her rightness shall be an
[2:16:06] identification
[2:16:07] with her lord by means of the word
[2:16:10] and her head who is a mystery of
[2:16:13] godliness
[2:16:14] which is christ hallelujah
[2:16:18] this false church with all cunning and
[2:16:21] diabolical power
[2:16:23] made up of political force
[2:16:26] physical force and demons of darkness
[2:16:30] that's a trinity that combines that
[2:16:32] false church
[2:16:34] political physical and demonic
[2:16:38] the true vine with the fullness of the
[2:16:41] spirit
[2:16:43] and the word will do the very acts and
[2:16:46] power
[2:16:47] that jesus did in england i preach about
[2:16:50] one
[2:16:50] body one spirit and one head
[2:16:54] there's only one body that jesus head of
[2:16:57] that's the body called the church
[2:16:59] that's not a physical body that's an
[2:17:01] international bright body
[2:17:03] and by one spirit you're baptized into
[2:17:05] that one body
[2:17:06] and when you get into that body nobody
[2:17:08] could pull you out so the key is to go
[2:17:10] into the body
[2:17:11] once you're in the body they could send
[2:17:13] you in australia new zealand they can
[2:17:15] send you to england china they can send

[2:17:48] they can't hold the light
[2:17:50] the light just continues on as they try
[2:17:53] to cut us out we pass the torch to
[2:17:54] somebody else hallelujah paul passes
[2:17:57] irenaeus and martin and columbus

[2:18:48] becoming like him through the word jesus
[2:18:51] will come
[2:18:52] that the bride and groom may be united
[2:18:54] together as one
[2:18:56] yet it is harvest time then they must
[2:18:59] come forward as seen in this age
[2:19:01] those who will bring the wheat and tears
[2:19:02] to maturity the tears already maturing
[2:19:06] very fast
[2:19:08] under corrupt teachers who turned people
[2:19:11] from the word
[2:19:13] but the wheat must also mature and to
[2:19:16] her
[2:19:17] god is telling the prophet messenger
[2:19:19] with the vindicated ministry
[2:19:21] that he might be accepted by the elect
[2:19:24] they the elect will hear him as the
[2:19:27] first church with paul
[2:19:29] and she will mature in the word
[2:19:33] here we go until becoming a world bride
[2:19:39] the mighty works will be found in her
[2:19:42] that are always
[2:19:43] attendant upon pure word and fate
[2:19:46] you're written epistles right of all men
[2:19:48] translate that
[2:19:50] turn it around you are epistles that
[2:19:52] have been written
[2:19:53] you can't add nothing to it that's rid
[2:19:56] of all men
[2:19:57] manifested word of god in other words
[2:19:59] peter and john
[2:20:01] jesus was manifesting himself
[2:20:04] through them christ veiled in their
[2:20:08] flesh
[2:20:09] manifested made alive like he was in
[2:20:12] moses
[2:20:13] oh hallelujah so the seed is the word
[2:20:17] and the god and the on every age have it
[2:20:20] seen on his time
[2:20:21] and the people that of that age that
[2:20:24] manifest that promised word
[2:20:26] is the seed of that age according to
[2:20:28] what jesus
[2:20:29] said they are the children of the
[2:20:31] kingdom the manifestation
[2:20:33] of the holy spirit operating through his
[2:20:37] children
[2:20:38] is though seed of the kingdom at that
[2:20:40] age notice
[2:20:41] he never talked about doctrine deduction
[2:20:44] the chairman teaching is the
[2:20:46] manifestation you see

[2:20:54] spirit operating to his children is the
[2:20:56] seed
[2:20:56] he said no we become tabernacles of that
[2:20:58] holy spirit
[2:20:59] which is christ that's the real seed
[2:21:02] then if the real holy spirit here we go
[2:21:05] gets into the real seed it won't take
[2:21:07] part of it

[2:22:15] you are getting into bright material
[2:22:18] you're getting into rapture and
[2:22:19] condition that means for each one of us
[2:22:21] not just the pastor the deacon or the
[2:22:23] trustees it means a laity

[2:22:43] children whatever not working with god
[2:22:44] but you walking with god

[2:22:56] faith perfect for people perfection that
[2:22:58] kind of feel
[2:22:59] that faith never feels he was a mistake
[2:23:02] mystic to the world oh my
[2:23:06] oh can we take a little more just a
[2:23:08] little more i'll be going good
[2:23:14] you enjoying the lord this morning how
[2:23:17] many
[2:23:18] how many times got there christian
[2:23:31] now remember there won't be any
[2:23:32] denomination
[2:23:34] watch okay the shark's pulling away
[2:23:38] no cooperation nothing with it always
[2:23:41] pulls away
[2:23:42] there can be no more it's weak now and
[2:23:45] we are plenty green for the branagh
[2:23:48] listen to the description we are plenty
[2:23:50] green
[2:23:51] we have to lay in the presence of the
[2:23:54] sun
[2:23:56] to be mellowed up aha
[2:23:59] so he's talking about coming into
[2:24:00] presence and staying there
[2:24:02] to get mellow plenty green we haven't
[2:24:04] got and he called him pen degree now
[2:24:06] he's interpreting it
[2:24:07] we haven't got the sincerity the
[2:24:10] sacredness
[2:24:11] the thing we ought to have in our midst
[2:24:15] so coming out of greenness is the coming
[2:24:17] into sincerity
[2:24:19] coming into sacredness coming into
[2:24:22] respects
[2:24:22] like i always wanted the church that i
[2:24:24] serve to be one noted by brotherly love
[2:24:27] and respect because i know people are
[2:24:29] going to be judged
[2:24:31] by blasphemy and what the spirit of god
[2:24:33] began to do
[2:24:34] and i was always scared and concerned by
[2:24:37] people seeing the wrong thing
[2:24:39] that's why i'm saying say something nice
[2:24:40] see something good
[2:24:42] say something loyal say something
[2:24:44] truthful don't just
[2:24:45] lose your tongue and say anything you
[2:24:47] would pay for that
[2:24:49] but say the right thing and train
[2:24:51] yourself to speak the right thing
[2:24:54] because one of these days you might just
[2:24:56] end up saying the wrong thing at the
[2:24:57] wrong time
[2:24:58] and god will judge you right there on
[2:24:59] the spot for that you don't want that
[2:25:02] amen be humble be gracious
[2:25:05] be grateful holla don't be arrogant and
[2:25:08] puffed up
[2:25:09] god looking for somebody the more he
[2:25:10] blessed the more humble becomes
[2:25:12] he said usually when people get blessed
[2:25:14] they get puffed up they get arrogant
[2:25:15] two little blessing and they like like
[2:25:19] they're drunken and blessed
[2:25:24] a full air of corn a full wheat balls
[2:25:28] empty head stick up stick up stick up
[2:25:30] sticker this is how i always know it
[2:25:33] you know always used to do it but i'm
[2:25:36] telling you
[2:25:37] not that way but pastor you know the
[2:25:39] lord show me
[2:25:40] i am telling you the lord and show you
[2:25:42] nothing is all puffed up in your mind
[2:25:45] it's a religious spirit upon your life
[2:25:47] that you need to repent of
[2:25:48] because if i am the pastor telling you
[2:25:50] you're supposed to listen to the pastor
[2:25:52] because he is god's mouthpiece servant
[2:25:54] speaking the word to you
[2:25:56] now if the pastor is a cuckoo man that's
[2:25:58] different
[2:25:59] but if the past is on the word that's
[2:26:01] something else
[2:26:03] [Applause]
[2:26:05] you can hardly find a man on the world
[2:26:07] that preaching pure word
[2:26:09] the preaching themselves the ministry
[2:26:10] the position of cutting life
[2:26:13] amen
[2:26:14] [Music]
[2:26:17] after preaching about suffering trouble
[2:26:19] trouble trouble
[2:26:20] to get in real trouble call them bishops
[2:26:23] and poops they have down there they
[2:26:24] don't want that
[2:26:25] they want to take over
[2:26:28] they feel their natural thing no no why
[2:26:31] why i want to rule somewhere church what
[2:26:34] why are you trying to rule some other
[2:26:35] country that is crazy
[2:26:37] shouldn't have enough trouble all by
[2:26:38] itself right inside your way amen
[2:26:41] at the end of the day i have to answer
[2:26:43] for you i have to answer for what i have
[2:26:45] done
[2:26:45] that's what i say i accept
[2:26:46] responsibility it's not you fail i have
[2:26:49] failed
[2:26:50] because i suppose it presents leadership
[2:26:51] by the holy ghost that will inspire you
[2:26:53] to press on
[2:26:55] that's what's supposed to be here
[2:27:00] i can come to this monitor could it be
[2:27:02] whatever it is
[2:27:03] [Laughter]
[2:27:05] but what if it's not
[2:27:08] could it be this could it be that could
[2:27:10] it be this
[2:27:11] and your head goes so could it be could
[2:27:13] it be could it be could it be
[2:27:15] and we don't even know what what what's
[2:27:16] going to be
[2:27:18] so i'm not here to preach could it be
[2:27:20] i'm here to tell you god save the lord
[2:27:24] just say the lord is the word
[2:27:28] i told his brothers in africa i don't
[2:27:29] study saturn and mars and moon and and
[2:27:31] i don't even bother with that no explain
[2:27:34] star
[2:27:35] falling this happening and whatnot i am
[2:27:37] not an astrologer i'm not looking up
[2:27:38] there at all
[2:27:39] i have seven stars to deal with in the
[2:27:41] right hand of almighty god
[2:27:42] i bring the word first to the rapture
[2:27:45] for me to wonder if mars
[2:27:47] i assign this line up this line up so
[2:27:49] could it be so could it be so
[2:27:51] i don't know my faith can handle that
[2:27:54] i want to know dossier the lord that i'm
[2:27:56] gonna have a revival
[2:27:58] i want to know just say the lord they
[2:28:00] know they're near breaking bands and
[2:28:01] wickedness and people leaving here
[2:28:03] transform those lepers
[2:28:05] they say lord have mercy upon us they
[2:28:07] are lepers
[2:28:09] you don't hook them up and say oh
[2:28:11] pressure slipper
[2:28:12] you stay far from those folks that is
[2:28:15] high contagious disease
[2:28:17] jesus and all and touch them
[2:28:20] he said go and show yourself to the
[2:28:23] priest
[2:28:24] these guys just walking they're just
[2:28:25] walking going going down to the priests
[2:28:27] obedience that's these are all just a
[2:28:29] little word just just a little word
[2:28:31] to obey and they're walking down all of
[2:28:33] a sudden they recognize they're healed
[2:28:34] they didn't read
[2:28:35] they reached the priests the obedience
[2:28:38] brought healing let me say it again
[2:28:40] obedience
[2:28:41] brought healing obedience will bring
[2:28:44] healing to your life
[2:28:45] your home your marriage your situation
[2:28:48] obedience is going to bring it
[2:28:51] warn him come back and worship jesus he
[2:28:53] said where he rest
[2:28:55] he knew all you amen where'd he rest he
[2:28:58] said your faith has made you whole
[2:29:00] so you see what happened the rest gets
[2:29:02] blessing of healing by obedience
[2:29:04] this one confirmed something more than
[2:29:06] what they had because this won't come
[2:29:08] back to worship
[2:29:13] music has come up please
[2:29:18] i believe the church is beginning to
[2:29:20] hear the message
[2:29:22] begin to understand it but friend we've
[2:29:24] got to lay in the presence of the sun
[2:29:26] we've got to be ripened our fate isn't
[2:29:28] right
[2:29:29] intellectually we're hearing the message
[2:29:31] that god gave us seeing the signs
[2:29:32] proven it by the bible hallelujah
[2:29:36] listen to this prophecy
[2:29:40] no there's some god being misunderstood
[2:29:41] this is the bible i'm speaking
[2:29:43] and he's speaking it i want to speak
[2:29:44] into your spirit into your heart into
[2:29:46] your mind
[2:29:48] now as your father in the gospel
[2:29:52] and as your pastor i would like a little
[2:29:56] later on
[2:29:57] when your spirits and gifts begin to
[2:30:01] come to perfection
[2:30:05] did you hear that he's prophesying
[2:30:09] it will come to perfection if
[2:30:12] you go to watching them flying loose and
[2:30:14] getting just watch that person
[2:30:17] let it go because it's not the spirit of
[2:30:19] god on them
[2:30:21] when they are sweet and meek
[2:30:24] and humble and ready and everything
[2:30:27] that's the spirit of god if somebody
[2:30:30] gets out of order and the pastor has to
[2:30:32] call it on
[2:30:33] and that spirit flies up it is not
[2:30:36] the spirit of god the spirit of god
[2:30:39] don't fly up
[2:30:40] the spirit of god always stands and
[2:30:42] comes to the word
[2:30:44] every time what is he saying the gifts
[2:30:48] order will come to perfection and any
[2:30:51] rebuke correction instruction the person
[2:30:53] will humble themselves to the world
[2:30:55] and they wouldn't keep their self and
[2:30:56] the way they think and what they feel
[2:30:57] and their feeling led
[2:30:58] which time we get deal with that people
[2:31:01] feeling led and there's no
[2:31:02] letter no lord you know there's a letter
[2:31:03] ahead
[2:31:12] imagine there is no more shock
[2:31:16] after the shack is gone it's seed god is
[2:31:19] ready
[2:31:20] are we ready if he isn't doing it now
[2:31:23] he's going to
[2:31:24] call a chase to perfection by his word
[2:31:27] jesus christ
[2:31:31] oh hallelujah if he is not doing it now
[2:31:34] he's gonna do it
[2:31:36] do what call a church to perfection
[2:31:39] by his word jesus christ so william
[2:31:42] branham message
[2:31:43] was designed to call a brighter
[2:31:45] perfection isn't that right
[2:31:47] the prophet word was to call us back to
[2:31:49] perfection oh blessed be the name of the
[2:31:52] lord
[2:31:52] hallelujah do you believe that oh praise
[2:31:55] the name of the lord
[2:31:57] oh hallelujah praise god praise god
[2:32:00] thank you jesus oh my i think i'll just
[2:32:03] push on here
[2:32:04] now this great last great step okay he's
[2:32:07] talking about
[2:32:08] three elements that constitute a birth
[2:32:10] adam had his bride taken from his body
[2:32:12] christ had the bright taking from the
[2:32:13] body when christ died there was three
[2:32:15] elements that came from his body water
[2:32:16] blood spirit
[2:32:17] justification true believing water
[2:32:20] sanification through the blood
[2:32:21] and then the bathroom holy spirit here
[2:32:22] we go now now this last
[2:32:24] great step must come into perfection
[2:32:28] that the holy spirit has to live in that
[2:32:32] church so perfectly
[2:32:33] so we're not talking about teaching and
[2:32:35] lecturing and no no we're talking about
[2:32:37] where it comes to the spot where the
[2:32:38] holy spirit begin to come down now

[2:32:58] united get a sea he is the head
[2:33:00] of the body now oh my hallelujah
[2:33:04] okay now the life that was in the stalk
[2:33:09] and in the tassel in the house all cars
[2:33:11] in the seed
[2:33:12] and the life that was in the store went
[2:33:13] to make another one just to make
[2:33:15] justification away from sanitification
[2:33:17] some vacationing away from the of baton
[2:33:19] hole he goes and the baptism holy ghost
[2:33:21] made a way for the holy ghost itself to
[2:33:22] come right down to perfection and back
[2:33:24] to the word again
[2:33:25] to manifest itself oh
