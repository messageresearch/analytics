victory this morning we thank you in advance that the anointing would come forth and break every yoke in Jesus we ask it amen and amen you have your seats amen go praise the [Music] [Music] Lord h amen H it's okay all that noise hallelujah praise God and son that's what we here to do we're not here to see each other we here to worship God praise God seeing each other as a side show but the real thing here is to come to worship God Bible talk about they that worship Him shall worship him in the spirit and in truth see some people they more caught up in religion than than God religion is what make people come to church go back home and live like Devils Rel ReliOn is what make people come to church and then they could cuss the neighbor and they could hate the brother and they could be disrespectful to their husband and they have a bad attitude at home and do anything and just come to church it's a ritual it's a it's a form it's a ceremony you know like how the Greeks will come and do things and this one come and do things and and every religion whether is the Indians in in America whether it's the Greeks whatever culture it is they do stuff whether they light candles whether they burn a feather whether they do or whatever it is I don't know all of it but they do rituals and stuff and they they think they worshiping God and people now worship I call it the god of their own imagination whatever they have in their head what the god is so God is I come to church on a Sunday and I get two hours Hallelujah and Glory go home that's God you worship and you do your own thing is God absent for the rest of the time then you know your the only time he's present is when you come to church and Hallelujah glory amen Shake take one G somebody hands and you shake somebody hands and so on and afterward that God is stoned dead that he is dead that that God you're serving there if that the god you talk about that God is Stone dead but the God we are talking about here he's alive he confirms his word he vindicates his word he declares himself he does Judge he does smite he does rebuke he doesn't give instructions he doesn't care praise God what people think of who he is praise God he decare who he is he like to show himself alive he like to show himself strong he like to show himself as a way maker that's the God we serve is not a god of a imagination or God of who you think he is no he's not a religious God it's a god of the word I am God and God Alone he look to the left there is none else he look to the right there is none else he said beside me there is none else oh give the Lord some Praises this morning that's the God we serve this morning hallelujah hallelujah so we not here come we we haven't come here for religious activity and just to be religious there are too many people are just playing religious and we will call that religious spirit out people living by their Dreams by their feeling and come to me and I seen it so you have seen nothing blind as a bat you have to see what God Said in his word to talk about God hallelujah do you get that now God and the word is one praise the name of the Lord like when David went and take basiba and he wasn't supposed to do that 500 wife he have and he's still gone and and the man her husband get that man to die in in and in in in battle and so on and and the prophet came and take give a little story David you know have a man who had so much of sheep and everything else this man had one sheep and he went and take that man sheep and whatnot David said that man shall die and then the prophecy you shall not die that's the grace of God coming to David you judge you judge you think you're in a position to judge and then it's falling right back on you the same judgment you using God useing back on you and say you are guilty the grace of God came to David you shall not die David but have a butt you know when you mess up with God's law have a butt that goes there yeah your children sing some Solomon you wouldn't see it but your children would see it so sometime when you see somebody lying on the street and somebody in vagrancy or what you don't know what happened back there yeah you feel sorry for them but you don't know what happened back there be careful God is not mocked what a man so he's going to reap it's better you never known the Lord than to play games with God because God a playing games nothing in this season here oh praise so we have some praises and prayer requests we'll take right after the service but this coming Saturday um would be our youth service at 5:00 try not to miss it and um by the grace of God Amen uh Stephen just play that song again fil me now fil me now just play this we want to switch to the word we want to welcome each and one of you here this morning and I pray that this morning service would be a help and blessing to you we preached something on Wednesday night very strange Heritage of the servant of the Lord and I didn't understand how I could get that why I would get that but now I know this morning and you would see from the word this morning amen praise the Lord [Music] now we were born in sin shape iniquity but God is not leaving us to remain in sin um when we receive Jesus and receive the applied blood to our hearts it means that God is working on us he's not finished but he's working on us and the Bible speak about he that began a good work is able to complete it am so it cannot be he's beginning a good work and you remain in sinner you have to come out of sin that he could continue the work inside of you he call you out not for you to remain stink and filthy and rotten in your own self but he call you out that something can happen on the inside now we not talking about you stop doing this and stop doing that you could stop whatever you want to stop that is you but when something happens within the desire changes this is what we talking about this is the operation of God where you as a human as a normal human being know this is a little more than you it's not you trying and failing and falling and getting back up this is something happening on the inside of you that changes your disposition changes your attitude that others could see a change in you amen not around you but in you and this is what you come here for tonight to ask God to fill you with his Spirit fill you with his presence fill you with his power just think his Spirit filling you means you'll be a better husband you'll be a better wife you'll be a better parent you'll a better son a better daughter a better person a better citizen of the country because now you are empowered with his Spirit outside of that you're just like any other Thug or any other person out there just going to church and going think about it this morning there are thousands of people going to the Catholic Church thousand going to the Pentecostal Church thousand going to all different churches but are they being changed are they being been transformed so you have to think for yourself what you come here for this morning oh glory to God I want you to think praise God we not here to study what dress you have on what tie you're wearing that is irrelevant what we he what we here to do is to see that you could apply the blood and apply what Jesus the price he paid to your life that something could happen on the inside of you that you could leave him more assured more full of Peace more full of his grace more full of his presence more full of his power oh give the Lord a shout in the meeting on Friday that exaltation from from Joseph being kicked out and betrayed by his brother to become the right hand of pharaoh there's a cost for promotion some people get promoted and they get demoted afterwards because they can't handle the promotion oh give the Lord some Praises you have to be ready for God to take you to the next step you have to prepare yourself to be taken to the next level if you want to remain as you are as a parent and stay stuck in your thinking mode and don't be uh looking for something higher you will stay Just As You Are Oh Glory to God till your children become more mature than you because you're not growing in knowledge you're not growing in information you're not growing in wisdom and understanding and you have a little baby Rock the Baby afterwards the baby tall like you and the baby know more than you and the baby have more understanding and more mature than you that's a shame God want you to grow God want you to mature God want you to ripen God want you to stuck praise God in how your was 15 20 80 years ago God you're stuck in that mode Oh Glory to God when you leave here praise prise God when you're about to leave here you going be able to call your children and say come let me bless you oh go because you have something to give because you have something on the inside oh give the Lord some praise you don't want to leave here and your children want to curse you and say what a wretched father what a wretched mother you don't want to leave her like that oh glory to God you want to leave it with something with footprints on the sons of time I don't know who I'm saying that for all this morning but we speak and praise God hallelujah you leave you want to leave with a trail behind you oh give the Lord a shout in the house you want to leave you anointed Oh Glory to God you want to see it come let me bless you oh glor what you bless is blessed oh hallelujah what what a position to be in Oh Glory to God some of you here because your grandmother prayed some of you here because your great grandmother prayed Somebody Prayed some great grandfather Somebody Prayed and they prayed for their grandchildren and know you are here they're dead and gone but their prayer is still holding on for you can't you hold on for somebody else come on can't you hold on for your brother for your sister for your family for some backslider out there can't you hold on and believe God that they will be delivered that they're going to come true oh give the Lord a shout this end time message is to go after the Lost go after the Fallen brother go after the Fallen sister don't just look at them in the pit get them out help them out raise them out we'll give the Lord some Praises this morning I don't know who I'm saying that for but there's somebody inside of here that this is for get out your rotten self get out your selfish self get out is all about you it's not about you it's about Jesus he's the same yesterday today and [Applause] [Music] forever wo Oh Glory Hallelujah [Music] Hallelujah Hall [Music] let be seated when you're selfish you can count your friends on your hands sometime one hand some fingers part of selfishness is that you don't like to give and you don't like to share part of selfishness is greedy you being greedy a greedy person you all one for yourself all for you and yours your little circle so cuz once you share once you give God is giving more to give and just get more friends and more connections Hallelujah when Jesus fed them with and and I know why I'm taking all these things today five those two fishes you know up to the crowd it was 3,000 next time was 5,000 5,000 next time is 7,000 he's all looking for bread and fish at least they come for something but as they come for the bread and fish he G them word because he know the seeds have to respond to word not bread and fish anybody can give up bread and fish but you have to be de to hear you have to show up oh give the Lord some Praises do you get that this morning if it don't show up you will not get it you have to show up Hallelujah however you show up you show up oh give the Lord some Praises then God could give you his word he said I sent his word and heal them sent his word and deliver them sent his word and free them send this word and break the tumor in your life break the sickness that the doctors can't deal with he can send his word this morning and curse that tumor by the word of God right inside your system reverse what the doctor say cannot be reversed oh give the Lord a shout either God made kidneys pancreas either God made eyes hands whatever what condition you in he could free you from your fears from your doubts from your hidden pain from your physical pain from your Oh Glory to God emotional pain [Applause] how do I start this morning may be seated over the years we encounter people who don't want to change that might sound crazy but we have we have dealt with that people who like how they are they feel they on Satan deceives them in the gay matter and in the mouth because when you see you for who you are you have to you're frightened the heart is desperately wicked you're not nice that's only in your head you're not good there's none good but God you're not own whatever you have have no currency in heaven if I take Trinidad money and go to America who wants that I could go with $60,000 TT $100,000 a million dollar and say this is money do would laugh I as well bur that it has no value de you have to convert that to US dollars so all your house land car andbody you look at your car what not you have no value dear you can have three story four story a swim pool on the top story it have no value de No Heaven not taken record tick of this tick you of this tick he was poor now he Rich tick have not taken all them ticks oh give the Lord a praise and if you catch that you'll free yourself from what man thinks you would free yourself from the opinion of others you would free yourself because a man life does not consist about the abundance of things that a man [Applause] possesses why you saying I'm over because that have to do with pride and pride have to do with lack of humility and if you have to get from God you have to humble yourself okay the Lord some praises and unless you're prepared to Humble you mess up you can't get nowhere because he that humble himself shall be exalted oh give the Lord I shout and God is looking for someone this morning that the more He blesses is the more humble he becomes why let me wrap this up here now why why because usually when we get stuff we get proud when you look deeper in the scriptures time and chance happen to all men a man living in a country and a man living in a city two different opportunities amen country man is harder yeah that's where they're located sometime I was going up talk over to my wife and understand Mar how much car coming none I said look look how much traffic up here none maybe one car pass direction and you look back none why Country go in city now you can't move because in the city and so are some experiences your experience might be country and next experience in the city there two different things time and chance happen to all men so because of where you are and what God provide and make a way and door you get blessed and but what I realize all the blessings all what God give you is to serve him [Applause] better that is not for you to parade your beef and show off all what God give you and bless you is to serve him better so let's sing this s and sing this song this chorus how we're going to go in the scriptures Come Oh Come and fill me now oh F me [Music] now fa Hallelujah [Music] come oh me with I [Music] pres my Lord oh God [Music] and God bless you we have a scripture in John 14 we want to read 12- 26 s John 16 6- 7 and St John 20 2122 reading from St John 14 verse 12 very verily I say unto you he that believeth on me the works that I do shall do also and Greater Works than the shall he do because I go unto my father and whatsoever you shall ask in my name that will I do that the father may be glorified in the son if you shall ask anything in my name I will do it if you love me keep my Commandments and I will pray the father he shall give you another comforter that that he may abide with you forever even the spirit of Truth whom the world can't receive because it sees him not NE an know him but he know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you I would not leave you comfortless I will come to you yet a little while and the world seeth me no more but ye see me because I live he shall live also and that day he shall know that I'm in the father he in me I knew he that had my commandment and keepeth them he is that loveth me and he that loveth me shall be loved of my father and I would love him I will manifest myself to him Judah said unto him not es scariot Lord how is it that thou will manifest thyself unto us and not unto the world Jesus answered and said unto him if a man love me he will keep my words and my father will love him and we will come unto him and make our board with him he that loveth me not keepeth not my sayings and the word which he hear is not mine but the father's which sent me these things things have I spoken unto you being yet present with you but the comforter which is the Holy Ghost whom the father will send in my name he shall teach you all things and bring all things to remembrance whatsoever I have said unto you St John chapter 16 to veres there 6 and 7 Jesus speaking to the disciples he's telling them he's going to die and everything else and so like that right and Jesus words he said but because I have said these things unto you sorrow had filled your heart nevertheless I tell you the truth in other words even though it's bad news from a human standpoint this is the truth it is expedient for you that I go away for if I go not away the comforter will not come unto you but if I depart I will send him unto you he promis to send him unto you and verse 21 of St John ch 20 then said Jesus unto them so this is the resurrection peace be unto you as my father had sent me so send I you and when he said this he breathed on them and sayth unto them receive ye the Holy Ghost let's pray father we thank you may you bless this word today and confirm it with your point of your spirit with signs wonders and miracles I ask in Jesus name amen you may be seated oh praise the Lord amen so a title he shall give you another comforter I have an inspiration receiveing the Holy Ghost amen Oh Glory Hallelujah so Wednesday night the heritage of the Servants of the Lord and God himself said he will bring that justification of righteousness this not impersonator something like that this is Servants of God all right now we have a great heritage a great sacred trust that's giv to us and you know we have a sacred trust you know what that trust is we have an inheritance a Heritage that we inherit as believing children so once you start to believe and come into God's plan and program automatically God gives you inheritance you know inheritance like somebody give you land house give you stuff and things like that not that you deserve it you know he did that for you you just have to accept it you can't work for this thing you know it's the grace of God right he said there therefore there's the reason I'm so dogmatic I would call it on standing on this word no matter what anything else says if it's not with the word I don't believe it if you want to believe it it's all right but to me it takes the word he said Heavenly will pass away but my word will never fail I live by the word because man shall a bread alone but by every word you see when you begin to understand that by Revelation that God is the word and the word is God you want to stay with that word now you have your own feelings you have your own emotions you have your own choices and whatnot and God allows that and God will not override that did you get that God will not override your will that's why Jesus asked a question will you be made whole I got Force Holiness on you you have to want it if you don't want it it would not be applied to you you you God will not override your will because like Adam God can't force Adam not to eat the tree he said eat everything he give man free will the choice is always you yours because thou has chosen you chose the right path or you chose the wrong path you chose the right friends or you chose the the amen the wrong friends you chose to delete people from your from your from from your phone book because they are bad for you it's not even worth having the phone number in in your phone delete them block them cut them off because they're not good for you they are bad influence they they playing to be friends but it's Lucifer putting on a friend mask don't say Amen now it's still true sometime it's family Lucifer you know that's why it's friend or no friend family or no family he said I come to being assured mother against daughter father against son I'm being assured for what the word Oh Glory to God not God want to bring confusion in family no he bringing the word to you to see if you going to stand for your family or the word sometime your family is wrong and the word is right oh give the Lord a shout in the house this is no blood ticket and water stuff this is the word is God no no blood ticket and water the word is God your family is dead wrong the word is right stay with the word oh give the Lord I shout make a stand for the word because the word is God [Applause] anas and saf came into the church anas is a liar he's a trickster he under he under all kind of corruption kind of thing he says one thing he all pay for it and he a different kind of thing like that his wife know better he died he dropped down dead Peter say you a light of a man you're light of the Holy Ghost afterwards people stop walking inside the church you

his church God gave his word to his church that sacred Heritage is ours yeah it's a gift from God many people would like to be here this morning but they tie up in hospital with strings and all kind of things attached to them Hallelujah brother talk about he SE so much lives people crying for Mercy too late and other people just rejoicing going home people going to hell still you know oh yes hell is not preach much in this message but people going to hell you know I don't care how much nice sermon they preach and the funeral service if they are right with God they go to hell they're going to

of God for your life the devil can't cancel that purpose the devil can't cancel what godain for you give the Lord some Praises [Applause] Hall God help me God help you as Christians never compromise one word of God the sacred trust that was handed to the church to preach this gospel without compromising and if we ever expect this word to ever come to pass if we ever expect God to keep his word we have got to stay with it just the way God wrote it that's the reason if you stay with it the way God wrote it there'll be all kind of things happening among you every word will be fulfilled we want people hungry for the word to be manifest Hallelujah tell your son about it tell your husband about it tell your neighbor about it anybody come in contact you tell them about it the word is God God promised a Revival God promised a Holy Ghost Church God promised a listen God never promised a defeated church God never promise a church that can't cast Devils out come on God promise a glorious Church [Applause] Without we lost our heritage when we compromise then we cannot expect God to keep his PR promise to us because we have broke upon the SEC trust we talk about it in Friday Jacob Jacob was a compromiser um a SC man a trickster he tricking mother anybody trick if you stay too long but he trick you too that's Jacob but God said Jacob I love what did God see in that man if you look at that man he's a terrible guy you don't want know you don't want to write him and don't be friends with him but God said that man I love that man why what God seeing he's saying what is going to become he seen Jacob being turned to Israel you don't see that you've seen Jacob you've seen his Rascal ways but you don't see he is on a trajectory for transformation he's on a trajectory for promotion he's a he's on a trajectory to be transitioning from that life to a new life and when he wrestling overcome God said the angel said your name shall no longer be called Jacob your name going to be called Israel and out of that we get the 12 Tri of Israel out of that we have a nation called Israel why because a man chose not to stay as he is he could say I rich I money I don't to care about what he to say no he said Lord I'm frightened and he's wealthy but he's afraid I'm scared and guess what when God finished with him and he meet his brother no fear they hug and wept in other words he was

[Music] you let's continue prophecy prophecy but but we have got one of the most Dreadful times to go through that ever laid before human beings that's a prophecy I keep bringing these things try to wake up these trinidadians here who in some of them in do mode and I always used to think about what how you going to feel as a teacher that in Ukraine that morning when bumps at the belt you're going to the bank to withdraw a salary or going to teach a class where you're going and bum start a pelt Russia is on move Russia is St yet you know it's almost like a holding B like just holding is waiting for us maybe they get in our position because you know all the wars have to hold back until things have to wait until the bride get in a certain position this this bride means a lot to God you know God has sent a prophet to waste time you know he sent Elijah the prophet before that great and terrible day oh you can look to the Future yes but it's a terrible day that's coming and we have to think and how we going to prepare for that day that is coming I ain't talking about weep waiting for that day you know I'm talking about the Dreadful time that lays ahead while the bride will be here that's why I brought that prophecy to you last Sunday where the Prophet talking about when where the spirit is talking about I'm going to Rapture my bride but before that the persecution will come you shall not face my wrath persecution and God's Wrath is two different things all together all right we are are got to one of the most Dreadful times to go through that ever laid before human beings I'm waiting for the hour everybody can get that chance to get off from work where we can set up somewhere I can speak on those plagues and things that is to fall in the last days and the bums and so on I'll skip that so Jesus knew that when he goes his disciples would be in sorrow there will be grief there will be despair he worked with them took them from fish fish as fishermen and so like that they saw Miracles they saw Lazarus he from the dead they saw the bread and fish multiplied and everything like that and he was a comfort to them they know if anybody sick called Jesus is a storm raging the the winds were contrary called Jesus Jesus CM the storm so they know now he's telling them he's going now he's going and he give them this promise of another comfort because he was a comforter being with them he was the word yet with flesh on it he was the word made flesh Noah and these other brothers just had the word now God promised God promised God promised hold to it Abraham held to the promise of Isaac and Noah held to the promise of rain and the Word was a comforter them even though he never saw rain before he's building the ark but he have God's word as a comfort to him but then all the word that they had now became flesh and this person called Jesus Christ the word became flesh and dwell Among Us in the beginning was the word in John 1 and the Word was with God the Word was God and the word become flesh and now we could handle him we could touch him that a woman of the blood is who she touch him If I Could Touch the Hem of His Garment she was made whole the word was made flesh there was healing coming out of there there was virtue coming out of there there was power coming out of there oh glory to God he was not just a man he was more than a man it was God becoming a man oh give the Lord a shout but here it is he said I will not leave you comfortless Hallelujah I will send another comforter Oh Glory to this one will abide with you forever this one the world can't receive it Oh Glory to God if you love the world you would not get it oh give the Lord a shout in the house hallelujah hallelujah St John 14:15 in the Amplified said if you really love me you will keep and obey my commands and I will ask the father and he will give you another comforter counsel helper intercessor Advocate strengthener and standby that he may remain with you forever the spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive or welcome or take to its heart because it does not see him or know and recognize him but you know and recognize him for he lives with you constantly and will be in you then he said I will not leave you as orphans comfortless desolate bereaved fall on helpless I will come back to you so when he said I will not leave you comfortless he said I wouldn't leave you as orphans as if you have no mother or father but I would come to you Hallelujah I wouldn't leave you desolate I wouldn't leave you comfortless I wouldn't leave you bereaved I wouldn't leave you forone or helpless I will come back to you oh give the Lord some Praises Hallelujah so isn't it plain who is this comforter then Jesus I pray the father you s you're not a comforter even the spirit of Truth isn't that right now this word for comforter in the Greek is a word called paracletos and this word is the word for comforter is called paracletus this term is used in the Gospel of John to refer to the Holy Spirit paralos and it's translated as helper it's translated as advocate in the legal sense a paralos is someone who pleads another case before a judge so we need him as an advocate because the the the the the accuser of the Brethren accusing us before God day and night look what he do look what he do look what look look look look look look he's he's a man pointing on all what you do and you have the advocate the def he Defending Your Case that's what the comforter is he is pleading for you I die for them I pay the price for them Satan is a liar oh give the Lord some Praises why he accusing you and pointing out your stuff there's an [Music] advocate a legal representative oh give the Lord some praises hallelujah hallelujah Give the Lord a shout in the house there's not no ordinary man there's a lawyer you have he's a Advocate he's your attorney he will ple your case before God and the judgment is not guilty case dismissed oh give the Lord I shout that's what he did that's what the advocate did he plead your case and the judge have no choice but to say not guilty because he say I died for them I pay the price for them that they could walk free I took their sins upon me oh give the Lord some Praises that's a comforter Advocate another one he's a helper this term signifies one who comes along to assist and support hallu Jesus promis to send another helper to be with his disciples comforter the aspect of comfort is integ to the meaning of paralos the Holy Spirit provides consolation and peace particularly in times of distress grief or difficulty when somebody lost a loved one who could really Comfort them money can Comfort them is a person that you lost a child a husband a wife or whatever it is but God is a comforter he give you peace in your heart peace in your soul you have signed up for that but you said Better or Worse richer or poorer and sickness on health sometimes sickness strike the left sickness strike the right sometimes sickness the husband or sickness stke the wife oh give the Lord a shout you would always be strong and have your strength sometimes the winds just blow contrary but he brings Comfort times of distress and grief oh give the Lord a shout in the house he's also a counselor as a counselor the Holy Spirit imparts wisdom guidance and understanding when he the spirit of TR has come he will teach you and get you bring wisdom to you and bring back to your mind the things that I spoken unto you oh glory to God he's not only an advocate he's not only a Helper but he's also a counselor Give the Lord some Praises hallelujah hallelujah glory to God when he the spirit of Truth has come he will bring these things that have taught to your memory the word oh give the Lord a shout so you have to be able to be in the word for the Holy Spirit to bring back to your memory the word I remember working in a school and they had a students they praying for the student before they going do the exam and the man was praying the prayer he said Lord bless those and bring back to the mind the thing they have studied and those who have not studied Lord have mercy because if you have not studied nothing come back to that green matter of yours if you study Things Are come back to your mind but you never touch it you never read it because you're on social media you're on Tik Tok you are so much of friends following you on Facebook some people looking for views right now I have no friends I do have time for that most people want to friend with me on the Facebook I don't have time who have time for that good luck to them I have time for those things click anding if that was prayer that was pinging there was praying praying I ping you adopted already you're going to away Glory but they're pinging and you can't get them to pray for half an hour but pinging I discover something my phone you know do not disturb in case you don't know it there's a number on your phone call do not disturb you have to know when to put that on you know if you can't get a balance press do not disturb no alerts no nothing nothing I put my my what'sapp on silent because brother if I said a ping ping ping I can't much have a way shut no noise do not disturb don't disturb me God don't need any interpreter the spirit itself which is the word interpret it to be the truth if a man will dare to stand out and take it he is his own interpreter amen so I'm just going to read something here now believest thou not not that I'm in the father and the father in me the words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself but the father that dwelleth in me he doth the works St John 14:10 here it is most evidently set forth that the perfect manifestation of God in the sun was by the indwelling spirit manifested in word and works that is exactly what we have been teaching all along when the bride will get back to being a word bride she will produce the very works that Jesus produced so a lot of word people talking about is just talk because the prophecy is when the Bride Comes Back To Be A word bride she will produce the very works that Jesus produced the word is God the spirit is God they are all one one cannot work apart from the other if one truly has the spirit of God he will have the word of God that is how it was with the prophets they had the indwelling spirit of God and the word came to them that is how it was with Jesus in him was the spirit without measure and the word came to him Jesus both began to teach and my Doctrine is not my own but the father that sent me now remember that John the Baptist was born was both the prophet and the messenger of his day he was filled with the holy ghost from his mother's womb when he was baptizing in Jordan the word of Jesus came to him the word here we go always comes to the truly Spirit fill Oh Glory to God so the word is connecting to the spirit fill that is the evidence of being filled with the Holy Ghost that is what Jesus said would be the evidence I will pray the father he will send you another comforter that he may abide with you forever even the spirit of Truth whom the world can't receive now we know what the truth is Thy word is truth isn't that right he said in John 8:43 why do you not understand my speech even because you cannot hear my word did you notice that Jesus said the world could not receive the Holy Ghost well in that verse neither could they receive the word Oh Glory to God so you sit here note all of Israel was hearing Moses but the Bible said all of them didn't mix the word with faith only Joshua and Caleb had the faith to hold the word do you get it now so you could sit here and this is like like somebody say by cast it on here for two hours right they could say 2 hours in a wedding they could stay 2 hours in a reception waiting for food that's staying long long long to come they could go somewhere else and stay 2 hours but for church ity ity ity ity sometime when he would come in hot so Daddy get up and take a walk in because they a ready for that yet but you have to take the word and when you take the word you begin to apply it even though you're not living it yet this is what God said I want this for [Applause] me you think I was always this patient I was one of the most impatient person you could think about very very low tolerance I learned this you know I grow into this you would like to see me in my younger form somebody to call me speedon house I a PA man going one two one two when I come what going [Music] on I couldn't understand that slow place so I had a nickname speed Gonzales so watch this now but the comforter which is the Holy Ghost whom the father will send in my name he shall teach you all things and bring things to remembrance whichever I read unto you right okay I want you to note carefully that Jesus did not say the evidence of being baptized with the Holy Ghost was speaking in tongues interpreting and shouting and dancing he said the evidence were that you would be in the truth you would be in the word of God for the age evidence has to do with receiving the word now some people take this and say interpret this mean they don't have to have an experience that is not true but the evidence of having the Holy Ghost is being ble to receive the word so if any man think himself to be a prophet Paul said let him acknowledge that the things that I write unto you are the Commandments of the Lord you see that the proof of the indwelling spirit was to acknowledge and follow what God's Prophet give for this age as he set the church in order amen praise the Lord so the evidence of a spiritual Christian believer is not to produce the truth word but to receive the truth word and to believe it and Obey it the prophet said now they're not interested in living it but arguing it the only weapon they have is argument that that is not the bride the bride is interested in living it because she will become the final voice to the final age do you get that now oh praise the name of the Lord so watch the body of Christ is one Spirit where every member from Pentecost to this time drink from the same new wine the same Holy Ghost bringing forth the same results how do we do it by one Spirit it is God's Open Door the Holy Spirit what is it it is God's open door it's a sign it's a seal it's a comforter it's an advocate it's an assurance it's a rest it is peace it is goodness it is healing it is life it is God's open door to all these things oh praise the name of the Lord that's the Holy Spirit it is peace it is life it is God's open door you don't have to go and go in a cinema to get a relief because you're uptight no he is peace he's a strong he is God's open door that is the Holy Ghost isn't that right hallelujah hallelujah glory to God notice Paul being a Bible teacher that's what we learned that he sat under a great teacher one of the greatest of his days gel and he was well vered in the Old Testament he knew it well he become a persecutor on the way that was Christ's way because he had been trained in the Old Testament under teachers but the teachers usually a caral I hope hope I don't say anything wrong he's still reading but usually if a man just the teaching the way of the schools is usually man-made see it isn't inspired because it becomes a doctrine of a school but in the Old Testament Paul being well trained knew the scriptures by the word but you see here we go the scriptures no matter how well you know them if the spirit doesn't Quicken them then letter kill it or the Mysteries teaching kill it there a big one this the letter kill it the spirit giveth life see it must be quickened or made life by the spirit and if the spirit doesn't lifen the word and make it a reality to you then the letter is just intellectual so this thing had to hit you oh glory to when it hit you so yeah look at the right note you're looking to get up and Hallelujah glory to God hey Hallelujah it inspires you you ever was in a dong mood and you hear some tap some tape or something so I think one of the brothers in uh the trusty chat or someone uh Deacon chat put a a picture of a

shoot it will spread it will grow it will mature it will put out a a air corn for you and you get 100 greens or 200 greens leave the grain there everybody every morning they wake up to see if it

crops you're not you're not lazy your plant you you have crops growing but you need rain you need water and he I send you rain in the name of Jesus Christ Hallelujah let's see if we could hit continue here now Jesus Matthew 8 78 chapter he said um be there for perfect even as your father which is Heaven is perfect you cannot be perfect in yourself if you are trusting in what you've done you're lost so be perfect even as your father is perfect oh you brandom Tabernacle you say we have healings that's wonderful we have visions that's fine your spiritual dreams sometimes they are not spiritual dreams let me read it again some people love the dreams this word reading again you have spiritual dreams and sometimes they're not spiritual dreams remember the other talking about some every time I sleep early in the morning get back get some crazy dreams those dreams are not spiritual at all I could guarantee you it's always some kind of foolishness I don't know why has come I could say it it's true I can't I can't spiritualize it a dream so and a dream so and a dream so no no he said there are dream some Are Spiritual dream some are not and sometime we try to help the poor we do what we can that's all right but that's not what we are talking about now we are entering into another phase leaving the doct of Christ believe in that let let us go to Perfection then he made a statement I oh my I wish I had the voice of an archangel to bring this to a place where you could see it so there is something here that the bride elect have to see and this have to do with the righteousness of faith that's an important message if you haven't listened to it go back and listen to it this is what God sees the righteousness of Faith because really and truly it is his faith in you and he is counting that faith for righteousness that has nothing to do with what you do or you don't do oh give the Lord some praises and he is attributing to your Faith which is his faith in you as righteousness to justify you as if you never did it as if you never failed as if you never sinned he attribute that Oh Glory Hallelujah and for the Servants of God no weapon form against thee shall prosper Oh Glory to God no weapon oh give the Lord a shout in the house it's all coming together full justification leav in the doctrines of Christ Paul said lean again the foundations of repentance on dead Works Faith towards God we believe do baptism We Believe laying on on hands and whatnot he said what and Resurrection he said now watch he says the law having shadow of good things to come could never make the worshipper perfect thou shall not kill th shall not steal all Thou shalt not can't make it perfect because as you shall it not amen is you not doing you're not stealing you're not lying that why the man come to Jesus a good Master what shall I do to inherit eternal life you just to keep the Commandments you just thr a ball to he said but I do this in my youth so I okay then but he knew he wasn't okay something wasn't clicking right and Jesus saw what was in his troubling him he was greedy he was selfish he said go and sell what you have not for him to have losses you know for him to get rid of that selfish demon that binding him from the Liberty to serve God he was buying to his money the money was controlling him his wealth was controlling him he says sell what you have and give to the poor and the Bible say Jesus loved him but he went they were grieved flip the script afterwards he in hell trying to tell Abraham go and tell my family do come down here you know my family are money too I leave them with money but down here terrible so watch you join the nazaran church will never make you perfect you join the Baptist Church Pentecostal it will never make you perfect you being a good loyal man will never make you perfect you can't Merit one thing keep the Sabbath Paul said lay aside all those things he said we could take it verse by verse now watch these s shall fall and believe if the landay of sick shall recover we believe that Paul said it is all dead works here why it is something that you do but let us go on to Perfection oh my we are coming into the Tabernacle not the foundation the Tabernacle itself what is he talking about this Tabernacle here with faith and virtue and knowledge praise God this is something God does in you God had to do that a man coming with character that is God that's why character is not a gift character is always a processed thing let's go to Perfection Hallelujah my he said my we coming into the Tabernacle not the foundation the Tabernacle itself that the Tabernacle the law the righteousness and the joining church and being baptized laying on our hands that's order of the church but now let us go into Perfection and there's only one that is perfected that is Jesus and how do you get in him through the Methodist no Catholic no through any church no through the message Church no Tabernacles no by one spirit you get into one body and God can't judge you because you Christ has already judged on your behalf so you are in Christ when he died you died when he rose you you Rose with him oh give the Lord some Praises let's go brother brandham when I can quit smoking when I can quit drinking when I can straighten this up I'll do it it will never be done right you will never be able to do it why just come the way you are right and by faith go to that stream I FL in wound Supply redeem and love to be your team and sh be till you die why take a substitude why do to try to get by your church why try to come in because you quit drinking or quit lying come by the way of perfection listen to these words for by one sacrifice he has perfected forever those that are Sanctified what is it God requires Perfection one two he requires your repentance he requires your loyalty to him and he's looking tonight here we here we go are you ready no matter how much you have sinned how little or how much you are still a sinner and cannot get in no other way but by Jesus Christ God's all sufficient sacrifice and in him you are perfected forever it is nothing you do it is not new pages you turn it is not a new life you start it's a confession of your wrong and God's grace to you that bring brings you to Perfection and then you are perfected in Jesus Christ good to give the Lord a shout glory to God hallelujah all right we're going good I'm on page 10 we have 17 Pages all right so watch Hallelujah we talking about perfection right yes so he said a character we want to look at and we know we just call his name his name is Joseph he was an elected son perfect type of Christ he was born a prophet I'm going to skip now notice what God had to do to him put him in prison put him straight to prison remember he was sold by his bre to an Egyptian they sold him to potifa pitifer gave him a little liberty first thing you know taken from him he sit in prison crying God had to strip it Oh you mean God doing this thing 30% say yes you mean God doing this thing s like 40% am you mean God doing this thing around your life amen so why you complaining Hall if you understand is God doing stuff around you you would stop complaining and start to praise Him in [Applause] Advance watch this notice all the time I believe he's in that prison he could remember the vision said he was going to sit on a throne and his brothers are going to bow to him because he knew the gift come from God he knew it had to come to pass and if you can only keep that in mind according to the word of God in these last days he's going to have a church he's going to have a people and these thing he promise he's going to do them he said he word and we are living in that time we are here he's just trying to get us to be real prisoners now to be locked in with him so Joseph was typing being in prison and God wanted us to be in prison to be prisoners of Love slave of the master oh give the Lord some praise God in his prison he constantly remembered he was born for a purpose do you speak that to yourself I'm born for a purpose I'm born for a purpose I'm born for a purpose I'm not wasting my time I'm not wasting my days I was raised for a purpose you are born for a purpose not to witness for the devil but to witness for God you are born for a purpose Joseph remember that he was going to sit by a king all the rest of them was going to Bow knee to him this Vision told him so isn't that right Hallelujah notice before he come out he had to be taken out and shaved a few had to be shaved off before he can meet the king and God sometimes take his people like that and shave here we go a few of their own Wills off because you feel you're a boss and because you get away all these years with having your own way you figure you going through life so and all of a sudden God bring a one big block in front of your face when you SC you recognizes will move down go something take people like that shave a few of their own Wills off shows them are you ready that they can't just do just what they wanted to do so some people go about to look them up you know what I mean they're not in Liberty to do what they want to do before they could come into full power let I take my time here now before before they could come into full power and be a love slave to Christ they had to be shaved off and then presented sometimes he takes them to the desert to do that to shave them off and then bring them out the anointed one to fulfill the purpose that he's ordained them to be I wonder where is your desert everybody have a desert whether you are going in you are in or you're coming out but everyone have a desert let me repeat that either you're on your way to it either you are in it or you are coming out some people only watching the word now they saying they watching it but I said let I see it say for a third time either you are in your desert you're going to watch your desert or you're coming out your desert but there's a desert for everyone where God do some shaving of your will that you can't just have your own way and carry on the way you have been carrying on glory to God watch election in abrahamu justification in Isaac Grace in Jacob and perfection in Joseph there's not one thing recorded against Jose jph that's the Perfection so this bright Perfection we're talking about has to be connected to Joseph in type Oh Glory to God three Earthly St of the pilgrim of the children of Israel the fourth was when they went in the promised land Hallelujah Joseph love of the father if you watch father

newspapers you know this better than Sunday Guardian expressing oh give the Lord some Praises this is the best thing you could hear this morning you know how you getting back into Perfection how you getting back into that place with God how you are become going to become perfect because they without us are not made perfect this church has got to come to Perfection to bring on a resurrection let's [Applause] go this great Forerunner has gone before us making our way he become from Spirit the great fountain of the rainbow of God who had no beginning or no end in other words he come from Elohim this ray of light went forth colors now it was a ray of love the main one red next color which was blue blue is tress the next followed after that was other colors through the seven perfect colors which is the seven spirits of God how a color could be a spirit but through these seven colors which is the seven spirits of God that went forth from that great fountain or that great Diamond that Jesus spoke of that great Diamond was chipped to reflect these colors God was made flesh dwell among us that he might reflect his goodness and his Mercy To Us by gifts and signs and wonders that whole big rainbow had become into a theophany of a made in an image like a man he wasn't a man he didn't have flesh yet he was a theophany God was this great spirit we pictured him the seven colors of the rainbow amen praise God God is eternal and he was the perfect love perfect peace perfect Joy perfect satisfaction all these seven spirits come out was made of God was Perfection the seven spirits was Perfection everything else outside of that has been something that was perverted from that and the only way shout out only way only way shout only way only way the only way we could ever come back to Perfection is back to come back to that Perfection which is God so to come to Perfection which Joseph was a type is to come back to the rainbows which is seven perfect spirits of God isn't that right hallelujah hallelujah glory to God so Perfection is not Jacob Grace Grace of God grace of God Lord God grace Lord forgive me Lord forgive me no you have to go to the next level Jacob Grace is one thing but the call is to do the Perfection you can't be sinning and repenting and sin and repenting you know God will forgive you and you keep repenting and keep repenting no no no no you can't stay Jacob Grace you have to go on to Perfection that is where the growth is at that where Christian growth is at not dealing with the sin question oh give the Lord some Praises hallelujah hallelujah so you Hebrews 11:39 that day without us not made perfect say you are to become to Perfection all right we home Str here now wow talking about being a Mill and they had a magnet Stone pick up all the the things that was magnetized it he said we have got to be magnetized to The Headstone so if you don't have the magnetism inside of you how would the magnet of God pick you up you in your own stinking flesh and the pillar of fire god magnetism come to pick up the bride one time I wanted to get some magnets here to show you you know and hide it in different containers and put a big magnet and see

wouldn't go they they wouldn't rebell and they wouldn't go They're not going anywhere you have to have the magnetism don't you want that you realize what you have now can't make it well get this thing Jesus said receive you the Holy Ghost it is something for you to receive have you received it if you haven't received it time for you to ask God for it you have not because you ask not and if your children fathers know to give you good things how much more father will give the Holy Ghost to them who ask him but the people in the message don't believe that they have to ask because they feel they get it already they have it again you're not asking you know when they go ask when they recognize water Mo and flowers we say and the lamp oil run out I say scratch the head and the pastor go say oh go we pray and ask for the Holy Ghost we need more power you know Rome coming down Russia coming down China coming down Z coming down everybody coming down sun coming down heat coming down Dr coming

to the moon out of space no gasoline engine you know no you know no lawn more engine using no if you see them things 24 engines inside of and when rest a big thing that the bright to go up it's fire power you know fire power you know not mystery power you know fire power you know not book power fire power know not I know this fire power Oh Glory to God hallelujah praise God people want Power people want influence remember the sorcer guy Simon he join to get baptized and when you see Power this so he say boy how much how much how much how much how much how much you could I I 20,000 I 20,000 that power thing I want to lay hands and people get the Holy Ghost I want to do that I want to do that Simon because he have money still a sorcerer he going to bring in church turn him back by

to boast God nothing in that things have to work for his honor and His glory no man and getting his glory oh give the Lord some Praises let me finish W here that Big Stone come by and pick up all the magnet Stone and pick it all up because it was the magneti it we have got to be magnetized to The Headstone that headstone is the Holy Ghost headstone is what ghost and every one of us that got the magism magnetism of the Holy Spirit when that stone strike the image jel Fleet to it now when Christ died there was three elements come out of his body water blood spirit justification believing water sanctification through through the blood then the baptism of Holy Spirit now this last great step talking about the baptism of the Holy Ghost must come into Perfection and he went deeper that the Holy Spirit has to live in that church so perfectly this have do with teaching and explanation and Mysteries Holy Spirit have to live in so perfectly it will make the head and body unit together so there's only four steps Luther Wesley Pentecostal and Joseph Joseph is the last step which is that Perfection that's what this message is this message that of perfection to take the bride home so that last great step has come to Perfection so luu preach justification and the people got in the atmosphere of justification and was justified Wesley preached sanctification the people got in the atmosphere of sanctification and they were Sanctified the Pentecostal brought the gifts and the baptism and they got in the spirit and they got filled with the Holy Ghost what about us our word isn't that right to a Perfection this word for the bride the Holy Ghost itself hear this prophecy now as Daniel heard the seven tunders and forbidden John heard the voices the book was sealed in other words the mystery of God will be finished in other words God would be known to his church not in three people but in one person the mystery of God will be revealed here we go and when that was completely reveal then the seven Mysteries would open to the church and those seven Mysteries what the seven Thunders right because India the church will be living under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit no Debt Service no intellectual gymnastics living under the inspiration when it's fully revealed him moving in and out showing his signs among us living among us and then we are worshiping the living Christ that is among us then you could say we know who we worship know what we worship oh give the Lord a shout in their house Hallelujah he told Daniel and John that in the last days these seven voices would be known by the real true church time shall be no more he announces that time is over what happens could that be so now Brethren seriously think if it is then the pyramid is kept by the seven Thunders therefore the pyramid kept by the seven Thunders and the Thunders is the Capstone and the Capstone is the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost Oh Glory to God Jo the Perfection that word inside of you God going to turn that word into power and the kingdom of God is within you when the Capstone word jully Perfection SE in you turns into Power you become a Powerhouse Oh Glory to God seriously think if it is then the peryer is kept by the seven tenders you remember the pyramid message it is the Capstone I'm going to go oh let me finish on page 15 mus get ready to come up Noah met God he heard God he had God's word didn't make a difference anyone said Noah had God's word it was a comfort to him when the critics come and criticize him how waterfall science test him no I forget them he had a comfort God's word isn't that right job he had a comfort the word God said as long as you offering a burnt offering you are fine so then his friends come and say a secret sinner he said but I offer I offer for my children he offer advented the sin to had a comfort the word of God but then one day one day this word all them follow the word each one of them was following God's word which was a comfort the word itself is a comfort because the word is a promise and once you have a promise you have a comfort if God say he's going to heal you there's a word there's a promise you a healed yet the manifestation a yet but God gave you a word that's a comfort to you Doctor say he gave you three more days to live that a lie because God gave you a word I shall not die but live God gave you a comfort you're holding on to God you can't hold on to the doctor doctor is limited by his eyes and his technology and all these equipment but God is God isn't that right so watch each one of them followed God's word but one day that word became flesh that word was made flesh in the form of a man the word of God that brought come from Was Made A man among us we could handle the word of God in our hands we could shake hands with the word of God he was the word in the beginning was the word the word was with God the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwell Among Us that word of God was made flesh the comforter Oh Glory to God so this word that was comforting all these prophets that word became a comforter when the word become flesh Oh Glory to God hallelujah are you with me that's why Jesus tell him I will send you another comforter because he knew that he was a comforter but this time was another comforter oh give the Lord a shout in the house hallelujah hallelujah glory to God he a little while the world seeth me no more but you are going to see me I'm going to die at the hands of sinful men and the hearts were broken they were depressed they were in Gloom but he made a promise I will not leave you comfortless I will not leave you comfortless I will pray the father he will send you another comforter which is the Holy Ghost and he will abide with you forever even the spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive but you know him you know him for he is with you and shall be in you oh give the Lord some Praises I feel the anointing here now then what is the word of God what is our comfort today it is when we receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the power of God living among us that is when the word of God is living word made flesh Among Us he is with you now but he shall be in you now that same word that the prophet spoke that same word I Was Made flesh that same word dwells in the church therefore if we don't compromise with the word and we stay right with it if we don't compromise it that same word living in you will produce the same thing he did that's the reason Visions can break to the song barrier that's the reason Vision can break through time barrier and say thus sayth the Lord It's the word coming forth from a spirit and the promise I'll be with you the comforter I'll send you the comforter and they gather in the upper room and they waited there until the day of Pentecost and when the Holy Ghost came it did exactly what the word said it will do prophecy are you ready and when it comes again when it comes again when it comes again and when it moves into a church that's born again it will come with the power and the demonstration of his being God's word a comforter in us bringing forth exactly the same thing begin to play something I'm done if we expect God to keep his word if we expect God to do the things for us that we are asking we will never be able to do it till we get back and Obey what God has said do we have got to go back where we left off at we have got to go back to Pentecost we have got to go back to the comforter we have got to go back to the Holy Spirit which is our comfort and when the Holy Spirit come it will not deny any word ever said it will stay right with the word for you let's all stand and give God some Praises father God father God we praise you today we thank you for your word
