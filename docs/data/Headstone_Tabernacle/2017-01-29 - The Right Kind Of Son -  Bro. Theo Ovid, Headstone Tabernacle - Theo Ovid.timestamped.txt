[1:00:00] Bibles to Matthew chapter 3 Galatians
[1:00:02] chapter 3 and we go over to Galatians
[1:00:04] chapter 4 and also Romans chapter 8 we
[1:00:07] want to read Matthew 3: 16 and 17
[1:00:11] Galatians 3 from: 26- 29 and we read
[1:00:14] Galatians 4 1-7 and Romans
[1:00:17] 8:14 to9 we go to Matthew chapter 3 16
[1:00:21] and 17 and
[1:00:23] Jesus
[1:00:25] when he was baptized went up straightway
[1:00:27] out of the water and lo the heavens were
[1:00:30] open unto him and he saw the spirit of
[1:00:34] God descending like a dove and lighting
[1:00:37] upon him and L a voice from Heaven
[1:00:40] saying this is my beloved Son in whom I
[1:00:44] am well pleased we go across to
[1:00:50] Galatians chapter
[1:00:53] 3 verse
[1:00:56] 26 for ye are all the children of God by
[1:00:59] faith in Christ Jesus for as many of you
[1:01:03] as have been baptized into Christ have
[1:01:06] put on Christ there is neither Jew nor
[1:01:10] Greek there is neither Bond nor free
[1:01:13] there is neither male nor female for ye
[1:01:17] are all one in Christ Jesus and if you
[1:01:22] be Christ then Abraham's seed Hallelujah
[1:01:26] and HS according to Promise chapter 4
[1:01:29] now I say that the heir as long as he's
[1:01:32] a child differ it nothing from a servant
[1:01:35] though he be Lord of all but is under
[1:01:37] tutors and governors until the time
[1:01:40] appointed of the father even so we when
[1:01:43] we were children were in bondage under
[1:01:45] the elements of the world but when the
[1:01:47] fullness of the time was come God sent
[1:01:50] forth his son made of a woman made under
[1:01:54] the Lord law to redeem them that were
[1:01:56] under the law that we might receive the
[1:01:58] adoption of sons and because he are Sons
[1:02:03] God has sent forth the spirit of his son
[1:02:06] into your hearts crying crying ABA
[1:02:09] father wherefore Thou Art no more a
[1:02:12] servant but a son yes sir and then and
[1:02:16] if a son then an heir of God through
[1:02:19] Christ we go to Romans 8 14- 19
[1:02:32] for as
[1:02:33] many as are led by the spirit of God
[1:02:37] they are the sons of Goden for you have
[1:02:40] not received the spirit of bondage again
[1:02:42] to fear but you have received the spirit
[1:02:45] of
[1:02:46] adoption whereby we cry AB father the
[1:02:50] spirit itself be the witness with our
[1:02:53] spirit that we are the children of God
[1:02:56] and if children then ears ears of God
[1:02:59] and Joint ears with Christ it so be that
[1:03:02] we suffer with him that we may be also
[1:03:04] glorified
[1:03:06] together for I reckon that the
[1:03:09] sufferings of this present time are not
[1:03:12] worthy to be compared with the glory
[1:03:14] which shall be revealed in us for the
[1:03:17] earnest expectation of the creature
[1:03:19] waited for the manifestation of the sons
[1:03:22] of God let's have a word of prayer
[1:03:23] father we thank you

[1:04:39] son that's the
[1:04:41] title the right kind of
[1:04:44] son I a
[1:04:46] subject the adoption of

[1:04:54] Mission the father's business it's your
[1:04:58] choice if you want to work in
[1:05:02] it but it's the father's
[1:05:10] business and that is Luke 2:49 and he
[1:05:13] said unto them how is it that you sought
[1:05:15] me was it not that I must be about my
[1:05:18] father's business age 12 all right and
[1:05:21] he's talking

[1:05:26] from adoption but the BR up bless us now
[1:05:29] as we approach the word and father thou
[1:05:31] knowest the reason that I'm approaching
[1:05:34] the word from this very scripture here

[1:05:39] do it this way it's your Divine will it
[1:05:42] is your order it's the order of the day
[1:05:45] to let the people positionally find
[1:05:48] their place and be ready for the hour of
[1:05:52] battle as our brother said in his prayer
[1:05:55] to you not long ago you have trained us
[1:05:58] so long Lord father give us our ranks
[1:06:02] put us out there so that we supposed to
[1:06:04] do what we supposed to do so we can be
[1:06:07] about our father's business for we ask
[1:06:10] it in Jesus name thy son amen
[1:06:14] amen now Galatians
[1:06:17] 4 it says that the heir as long as he a
[1:06:20] child differ nothing from a servant amen
[1:06:24] he's a son because he's born in the
[1:06:27] house he didn't join the house he was
[1:06:30] born in the house and there's an
[1:06:33] appointed time for the father to
[1:06:35] positionally place that
[1:06:37] son or that child but the child have to
[1:06:41] be
[1:06:42] trained
[1:06:44] trained
[1:06:45] tutored given special
[1:06:48] test to see if he could handle the
[1:06:50] father's
[1:06:52] business because if he does doesn't
[1:06:54] prove himself he will make a mess on the
[1:06:57] job right the father don't want mess on
[1:07:00] the job the father want a son train be
[1:07:04] before he put him in the position of
[1:07:07] authority and power are you with me
[1:07:12] Hallelujah
[1:07:15] today forgive me I'm just I'm just in my
[1:07:19] Hallelujah in my groove right
[1:07:22] now
[1:07:25] today I am not talking about a man's
[1:07:28] office
[1:07:30] Lord
[1:07:32] position I'm not talking about Elder
[1:07:34] Deacon trustee Pastor Bishop
[1:07:37] Pope I am talking about the
[1:07:41] man not the
[1:07:43] position amen so that covers all of us
[1:07:46] at the same
[1:07:47] level I'm not talking about principal
[1:07:49] teacher Taxi Driver whatever worker not
[1:07:52] not what you do
[1:07:54] not your job not your career I'm talking
[1:07:58] about who you
[1:07:59] [Applause]
[1:08:05] are it is not the office that will be
[1:08:09] [Music]
[1:08:13] adopted it is the
[1:08:15] man that's going to be
[1:08:18] adopted it's not the office that God
[1:08:21] said I am
[1:08:22] pleased it is the man that God said this
[1:08:26] is my son in whom I am well
[1:08:33] pleased it is not Pastor or teacher or
[1:08:38] Apostle being
[1:08:40] adopted it is the
[1:08:42] son the right kind of a son oh could we
[1:08:46] give the Lord some
[1:08:47] [Applause]
[1:08:50] Praises God has all kind of sons yes
[1:08:54] disobedient Sons rebellious Sons
[1:08:57] backsliding Sons he's not looking for
[1:08:59] pastor Bishop Elders he's looking for
[1:09:01] sons that he could positionally place as
[1:09:04] pastors Bishops Elders whatever whatever
[1:09:08] position he's looking for sons that he
[1:09:11] can place in a position of influence
[1:09:14] with power
[1:09:17] Hallelujah so this thing about
[1:09:20] son has to do with relationship with
[1:09:22] father
[1:09:24] am Hallelujah so new word comes in
[1:09:31] relationship the way in which two or
[1:09:34] more people or things are
[1:09:36] connected a state of being connected
[1:09:40] state of being connected by blood or
[1:09:42] marriage Hallelujah and we have to be
[1:09:44] connected by both by Jesus blood and by
[1:09:48] marrying to him blood and
[1:09:51] marriage so it was a Trill for me to
[1:09:55] see how much Jesus was connected to the
[1:10:00] father in every turn and as you go back
[1:10:04] to the Bible you begin to see Jesus was
[1:10:06] really into this relationship with his
[1:10:09] father the son can do nothing except the
[1:10:12] father show
[1:10:14] him first the father has given me all
[1:10:17] things into by power it's not me that do
[1:10:21] it the works it's the father in me that
[1:10:24] the works when you see me you see the
[1:10:27] Father the father is greater than I oh
[1:10:31] hallelujah praise God the son can do
[1:10:34] nothing except he see the so Jesus was
[1:10:36] into it
[1:10:38] Hallelujah this really no no notice

[1:10:42] all right all right all right there's no
[1:10:44] office inside of there I a pastor Mary

[1:10:49] there's nothing like that that there
[1:10:51] this is just
[1:10:52] father and Son but was praying he said
[1:10:56] oh heavenly father I thank thee tonight
[1:11:00] because we are living in the hour of

[1:22:58] for I reckon that the pressure and the
[1:23:00] charge of this present world is not
[1:23:03] worthy to be compared with the
[1:23:07] glory that God is about to unveil unfold
[1:23:10] reveal
[1:23:12] [Applause]
[1:23:21] manifest
[1:23:25] be
[1:23:26] seated we could say Amen how the Holy
[1:23:29] Spirit must dread to say that to the
[1:23:30] father hold he
[1:23:36] grunting God ask for report Holy Spirit
[1:23:39] say I'm next you know mean let me talk
[1:23:42] about she let me talk about he let me
[1:23:45] talk about the right kind of a son
[1:23:47] because that one only
[1:23:49] grunting that one only blinking the ey
[1:23:51] and watching so
[1:23:54] put that same person at carnival put
[1:23:55] them in a effect they watching so you
[1:23:57] know no they tapping dancing the TA in
[1:24:00] the foot and like that but in church
[1:24:02] it's
[1:24:04] stiff like if they got inoculation or
[1:24:06] something so inoculation hand stiff the
[1:24:09] hand stiff like they get some kind of
[1:24:10] injection or something so yes the devil
[1:24:12] inject you inject you with unbelief
[1:24:15] because you recognize that the devil
[1:24:16] deceive all all will worship the Beast
[1:24:20] all will worship Lucifer except those
[1:24:23] whose names on the book and if you see
[1:24:25] your name on the book you have to
[1:24:27] believe you have to behave like John
[1:24:30] when John saw his name John was filled
[1:24:33] with the Holy Ghost John could have
[1:24:34] behave himself and say I am John filled
[1:24:37] with the Holy Ghost let me take a seat
[1:24:39] and what who misbehaving said but John
[1:24:40] start to misbehave he was the first one
[1:24:42] he said all in heaven all under the
[1:24:45] earth I John he wanted to give his own
[1:24:49] testimony about the power of worship the
[1:24:52] power of praise when you see your
[1:24:56] [Applause]
[1:25:00] name that has nothing to do with your
[1:25:02] sins that has nothing to do with your
[1:25:05] sins that has nothing to do with your
[1:25:07] sins it has to do with you seeing your
[1:25:12] [Applause]
[1:25:19] name watch you may be seated but when we
[1:25:22] are obedient and love him and praise him
[1:25:27] and give him glory how the Holy Spirit
[1:25:30] must love to bring this to him how he
[1:25:32] say father you know what your son is
[1:25:34] just like you he say is a chip off the
[1:25:37] old block he loves you he's obedient now
[1:25:41] if that boy is no good yet he's a son
[1:25:44] he's never nothing but a son because
[1:25:46] he's born a son but if he's not obedient
[1:25:51] and the right kind of a son son he just
[1:25:53] continues a son without any
[1:25:56] [Music]
[1:25:58] reward so today
[1:26:04] choose your
[1:26:06] [Applause]
[1:26:10] choice once a son always a son but if
[1:26:14] you want to be a place son you have to
[1:26:16] be the right kind of a
[1:26:18] [Applause]
[1:26:21] son
[1:26:23] so we are not questioning your sunship
[1:26:25] we not questioning your salvation you're
[1:26:28] not questioning if you die you going to
[1:26:29] meet the Lord and so we're not
[1:26:30] questioning that you may be seated all
[1:26:33] right because this this end time Rapture
[1:26:36] promise is not for them who who die and
[1:26:37] went on to be the Lord we who are
[1:26:41] alive and
[1:26:43] remain we are the
[1:26:46] ones that have to get into that channel
[1:26:49] to bring the rest
[1:26:51] up
[1:26:53] [Applause]
[1:26:58] so every believer every brother that die
[1:27:00] and G on is more burden on the
[1:27:03] bride is more pressure for Perfection
[1:27:06] because you have to come to Perfection
[1:27:07] to bring a resurrection that why the
[1:27:09] devil don't want us to be perfect he
[1:27:11] want you to be
[1:27:13] good a cour
[1:27:16] here but Perfection is what promised not
[1:27:21] good God is the enemy of
[1:27:29] perfect Oh Glory to God in other words
[1:27:32] Perfection is his life in
[1:27:34] you it's not what you can do what you
[1:27:37] can do is very good but when his life
[1:27:40] come inside of you it's
[1:27:41] [Applause]
[1:27:45] perfect so that obedient
[1:27:48] son he had a placing of that son when he
[1:27:51] get in the age a certain age he's taken
[1:27:54] out into a public place and there a
[1:27:56] great ceremony is made out before the
[1:27:59] public now it's not the son parading
[1:28:01] himself is not the son of a flag say I
[1:28:04] am a son and you know who I am no no
[1:28:07] it's not that it's the father bringing
[1:28:10] the son in public is his father is
[1:28:13] identifying his son he don't want to
[1:28:15] hide him under no Bushell he bring on

[1:32:39] who you are
[1:32:41] [Applause]
[1:32:48] hallelu and that's what the matter with
[1:32:50] the church today you read reason we
[1:32:52] don't have many mighty great
[1:32:53] manifestations the great Church of the
[1:32:55] Living God in these last days should be
[1:32:57] far down the road with every Divine gift
[1:33:01] set in order a great beautiful church
[1:33:05] but we are broke up in denomination isms
[1:33:07] little fosses and everything else till
[1:33:09] God can no more with us until we come
[1:33:12] together and get our hearts right with
[1:33:15] God that's why our blessings are about
[1:33:18] to run out that's why in the churches is
[1:33:21] getting cold cooling off is because we
[1:33:23] have become indifferent towards God his
[1:33:26] spirit and his word and it is true we
[1:33:29] never welcome the Holy Spirit no
[1:33:33] more so when you come to church it's a
[1:33:36] great
[1:33:37] responsibility you see I want to get off
[1:33:39] a church and get into your position of
[1:33:41] sons Hallelujah when you come to church
[1:33:44] as a son forget church when you come to
[1:33:46] church as a son you come to worship you
[1:33:49] come to welcome the Holy Spirit you you
[1:33:51] you you I'm talking to it has nothing to
[1:33:53] do with nobody else you're not waiting
[1:33:55] in the group for somebody to worship to
[1:33:57] to whip you up everybody praying but you
[1:34:00] not praying you mind
[1:34:03] men you open your prayer L on
[1:34:08] you man you are to pray for your own
[1:34:11] self you got to take your own burden
[1:34:13] before God isn't that right that's when
[1:34:17] God going to see and come and bless
[1:34:19] second Timothy 3 all scripture is given
[1:34:22] by inspiration of God and is profitable
[1:34:26] for Doctrine for Repro for correction
[1:34:28] for instruction and righteousness that
[1:34:31] the man of God may be perfect thoroughly
[1:34:33] furnished unto all good works and the
[1:34:36] Amplified is every scripture is God
[1:34:39] breathed given by
[1:34:42] inspiration profitable for
[1:34:45] instruction
[1:34:46] reproof and conviction of sin correction
[1:34:51] of
[1:34:52] error and discipline in
[1:34:55] obedience and for training in
[1:34:59] righteousness which is in holy living in
[1:35:02] Conformity to God's word and with Will
[1:35:05] and in thought purpose and
[1:35:07] action so the scriptures itself that we
[1:35:10] bring is to bring correction is to bring
[1:35:13] reproof is to rebuke you is to instruct
[1:35:16] you and to bring guidance to you and if
[1:35:19] you don't want it that's
[1:35:22] that's your kind of
[1:35:24] son but if you want to be the right kind
[1:35:27] of a son you'll respond to this because
[1:35:30] all scriptures is God
[1:35:33] breathe all scriptures is inspired and
[1:35:36] there's a purpose behind the scriptures
[1:35:39] the scriptures by the Holy Spirit bring
[1:35:41] the tutorship upon your life so you're
[1:35:44] not fighting the pulpit you're not
[1:35:45] fighting the man of God you're fighting
[1:35:47] your own blessing your own inheritance
[1:35:50] by wrestling with what God is is
[1:35:51] speaking through the
[1:35:52] word oh
[1:35:56] Hallelujah so
[1:35:58] Abraham he help us to come into full
[1:36:02] obedience God said separate yourself
[1:36:04] from your brethren and that's what you
[1:36:06] have to do a lot of times separate
[1:36:09] yourself from a lot of unbelief and
[1:36:11] remember here we go are you ready until
[1:36:15] Abraham fully obeyed God the blessing
[1:36:20] never come until he fully obeyed God
[1:36:25] think about your blessing being locked
[1:36:26] up and stored up Hallelujah nobody can
[1:36:28] take it it's yours it Mark your name on
[1:36:31] it it's it's there yes but because of
[1:36:34] your actions because you're not
[1:36:36] separated you can only get dripping from
[1:36:39] it God can't open the full thing he can
[1:36:41] open a little creeks and something fall
[1:36:43] on you it's yours nobody can take it
[1:36:45] it's yours it's reserved but for that
[1:36:48] full window to open up you have to come
[1:36:52] into full
[1:36:54] [Music]
[1:36:56] obedience Hallelujah running out
[1:36:58] now amen hallelujah you right
[1:37:03] son now don't watch me say Amen if I
[1:37:06] preach any words amen watching me nobody
[1:37:10] say you
[1:37:14] know watch until Abraham fully obeyed
[1:37:18] God the blessings never come until he
[1:37:20] fully obeyed God he took his daddy along
[1:37:23] and he caused trouble then lot finally
[1:37:25] caused trouble hurs man God didn't tell
[1:37:27] him bring the people in he say separate
[1:37:29] yourself he said Daddy come BL come and
[1:37:32] they bring along tot along drag along
[1:37:34] all way people on the to along and it's
[1:37:36] trouble them same people to
[1:37:39] trouble he still had to get separated
[1:37:41] from
[1:37:43] [Applause]
[1:37:46] themall 30% say Amen on that you don't
[1:37:49] want to separate yet well that your
[1:37:52] choice Hallelujah that's your choice
[1:37:55] thank you Jesus I want my
[1:37:57] blessing Hallelujah if I to separate
[1:38:00] myself from you I go
[1:38:04] on I want my blessing do you want your
[1:38:08] blessing you'd have to have a burden for
[1:38:11] your father's
[1:38:15] business
[1:38:17] Hallelujah
[1:38:19] father's business
[1:38:23] and as soon as he got separated from
[1:38:25] everything when he fully obeyed then God
[1:38:28] brought the blessing then is when we see
[1:38:30] when full obedience come and when he was
[1:38:33] about to take the life of his own son
[1:38:35] the angel of the Lord called from
[1:38:36] disguise and held his hand there's a ram
[1:38:38] behind him he took the RAM and said
[1:38:40] where that Ram come from oh praise the
[1:38:42] name of the Lord I skip that but the RAM
[1:38:44] said the only way you're going to pay
[1:38:45] the price to talk about the token is
[1:38:47] accept it full obedience to the whole
[1:38:50] word of God in entitle you to the Token
[1:38:52] full obedience not part of it as far as
[1:38:54] denomination goes but all of it full OB
[1:38:57] to the word which is Christ brings you
[1:38:59] to Christ oh full obedience complete
[1:39:02] obedience is not right so when God
[1:39:05] expect you to do a certain thing he
[1:39:07] Demands a complete separation from any
[1:39:10] doubt you have got to come to full
[1:39:12] obedience to obey what he says God
[1:39:14] demands it you can't do it no other way
[1:39:16] now he set an example and this was the
[1:39:18] example complete separation from all of
[1:39:21] his own
[1:39:23] family Kindred and walk a new life so if
[1:39:28] you are the right kind a son you will
[1:39:30] stay with the word god going to chastise
[1:39:32] you God going to bring down the whip he
[1:39:35] going to bring down the blows but you're
[1:39:37] going to stay with the word but says God
[1:39:40] was doing here we call a plac of a son
[1:39:42] and before he fell a to the kingdom of
[1:39:44] his father possession the first that son
[1:39:46] had to be raised and tried he had to
[1:39:50] find out whether the son was a true son
[1:39:52] or just a rust about this son would
[1:39:55] never be air if he wasn't qualified to
[1:39:59] take the father's
[1:40:01] place so the God's objective is for the
[1:40:05] son to take his place so the test and
[1:40:09] the trial is to qualify you for position
[1:40:12] all right right listen if you being
[1:40:15] tested you have been considered worthy
[1:40:17] Hallelujah for the interview for this
[1:40:20] job
[1:40:22] [Applause]
[1:40:25] if you are not being tested I think you
[1:40:27] should be
[1:40:32] worried I think you should be concerned
[1:40:34] because the test and the try is because
[1:40:37] you have the potential Hallelujah you
[1:40:40] you don't waste time on people who don't
[1:40:41] want to learn nothing you leave them
[1:40:43] alone they're on their own but because
[1:40:45] the child is willing to give it a crack
[1:40:47] to give it a chance but Isaac spoke
[1:40:50] something
[1:40:51] he said as the head of the home or the
[1:40:53] house or you get a position or promotion
[1:40:55] you to do two things step up or step
[1:40:59] out the position is always higher than
[1:41:01] you if you get a promotion it is always
[1:41:04] higher than you it is always more
[1:41:07] responsibilities it will be always more
[1:41:09] pressure and stress but it will be more
[1:41:11] pay
[1:41:14] too so you want more pay but not more
[1:41:17] pressure well you don't even have no
[1:41:19] pressure at all just go for no pay
[1:41:22] go for low pay and you get a low job and
[1:41:25] you have no pressure you have nobody
[1:41:27] under you you have no responsibilities
[1:41:28] you don't to open the office close the
[1:41:30] office you do
[1:41:31] nothing
[1:41:33] Hallelujah but this father's business
[1:41:36] hallelujah it's a huge
[1:41:40] responsibility it's a tremendous
[1:41:42] responsibility and he can't give his
[1:41:45] business over to Rascals Ro about and
[1:41:48] people that just don't care
[1:41:53] so he has to have some kind of way to
[1:41:56] measure and to
[1:41:58] qualify and to strip by interview and by
[1:42:02] test the kind of person he want for the
[1:42:05] business you get the wrong person they
[1:42:07] ruin your business your business will
[1:42:10] burst God business is not going to
[1:42:13] burst come on say Amen somebody she said
[1:42:17] as my father send
[1:42:19] me so send that you hallelujah
[1:42:23] hallelujah I'm not sending you just to

[1:42:31] same way my father sent me I am sending
[1:42:34] you at that day you're going to know I'm

[1:43:02] okay so he want to know if he's
[1:43:04] qualified took the to take the Father's
[1:43:06] Place okay and then all the father heart
[1:43:09] was given to the son and there is where
[1:43:12] I think that many of us Pentecostal
[1:43:15] people has made a mistake Hallelujah we
[1:43:18] think as soon as we become Sons and
[1:43:21] Daughters of God that settle it all
[1:43:24] right we just come into a place of
[1:43:27] trying amen
[1:43:29] amen and I don't think people appreciate
[1:43:32] that too
[1:43:33] much because I hear complaints I hear
[1:43:36] mumins yeah people attitudes and whatnot
[1:43:39] they don't see
[1:43:40] God they see this one affect me that one
[1:43:45] affect me this one do me they're not
[1:43:48] seeing God permit this one God allow
[1:43:53] that one God permit this to happen and
[1:43:56] that to happen he's not testing them so
[1:43:59] don't Point your finger at them she and
[1:44:01] I and she caused me to act so and I
[1:44:03] didn't want to do it you know but
[1:44:04] because
[1:44:07] he I wasn't going to do it but when he
[1:44:09] said that that's I hit
[1:44:12] him no no no no no no no no you wanted
[1:44:15] to hit him you choose to hit him they
[1:44:19] have no excuses you have to make a
[1:44:21] choice because thou has chosen you have
[1:44:24] to choose the right action because
[1:44:27] you're no longer pleasing man come on
[1:44:30] now you're pleasing not the pastor

[1:47:30] which
[1:47:31] Heaven pul third heaven I don't know
[1:47:34] which
[1:47:35] one but when we all get to
[1:47:40] heaven what a day of rejoicing that will
[1:47:43] be the Bible said if we say we have no
[1:47:46] sin we deceive ourselves
[1:47:50] and the truth is not in us but if we
[1:47:54] confess our sins he is faithful and just
[1:47:59] to forgive us of all our sins and to
[1:48:02] cleanse us from all
[1:48:04] unrighteousness then when we do that we
[1:48:07] can have Fellowship one with another and
[1:48:10] the blood of Jesus cleanses us us us us
[1:48:15] us who born in sin and Sh iniquity us
[1:48:17] who come in the world speaking life the
[1:48:19] blood of Jesus cleans is us and we can
[1:48:22] have
[1:48:23] Fellowship one with another oh could we

[1:48:38] the truth may be
[1:48:42] seated
[1:48:49] Hall
[1:48:52] so no matter what kind of position God
[1:48:54] put you in yes sir you are still growing
[1:48:56] towards Perfection I will never reach
[1:48:59] that till Jesus comes now notice if God
[1:49:02] acted any Wan thing on a certain
[1:49:04] circumstance and that circumstance arise
[1:49:07] again he's got to act the second time
[1:49:09] like he did the first time or he's
[1:49:12] unjust so no matter how bad you are in
[1:49:15] sin how stupid you may become he has got
[1:49:18] to act to you like he did that Fallen
[1:49:22] woman or he acted wrong then Jes now
[1:49:25] hear the bum God's behavior is his
[1:49:30] person what he is in his behavior
[1:49:33] declares his person and that's the way
[1:49:36] you are in your behavior tells you what
[1:49:38] you are it doesn't tell you about your
[1:49:41] office somebody could be a prime
[1:49:42] minister and be
[1:49:43] adulterer somebody could be a CEO and be
[1:49:46] a hater somebody could be a manager and
[1:49:49] be a murderer it's not the office it's
[1:49:51] the man so God is not interested in in
[1:49:54] this position and that position he want
[1:49:56] to know you who you are tell me about
[1:50:02] yourself when they go to interview they
[1:50:04] ask that question tell me about
[1:50:08] yourself you mean you you mean you don't

[1:54:59] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah so now
[1:55:03] these guys had a higher thought a higher
[1:55:07] inspiration now these guys they still
[1:55:10] frighten but it's not a frighten that
[1:55:12] frighten without promise that promise a
[1:55:14] power now they just had to wait on it
[1:55:16] and they were in the upper room waiting
[1:55:18] and they were in the temple
[1:55:20] worshiping God continually Hall you see
[1:55:24] worship praise Express Faith because
[1:55:28] faith is like a check that you haven't
[1:55:30] to taken to the bank as yet oh somebody
[1:55:32] get a check Saturday where you going and
[1:55:34] cash that the bank is closed you got to
[1:55:37] wait till Monday so you you should be
[1:55:39] shouting on Saturday Saturday night you
[1:55:41] can't
[1:55:43] sleep Sunday morning you're happy happy
[1:55:47] happy you're watching the clocking on
[1:55:49] Sunday night because you know Monday
[1:55:51] morning that what on that paper there is
[1:55:52] yours right now it's piece of paper if
[1:55:55] you give a child with it they roll it
[1:55:57] they might spit on it they might put it
[1:55:58] in the mouth that's a
[1:56:00] check
[1:56:02] Hallelujah so because you have it it
[1:56:05] materialized to the content of the
[1:56:07] revelation of what it is but you can
[1:56:09] Rejoice that is what faith is that's why
[1:56:12] when you know you're healed you begin to
[1:56:14] praise God and rejoice you know God
[1:56:16] going to a break you you you rejoice in
[1:56:18] advance amen
[1:56:20] you thank Him in Advance you start a
[1:56:22] worship they were in the upper room
[1:56:25] worshiping a promise worshiping a
[1:56:27] revelation they didn't know when it was
[1:56:29] going to come which Sunday which
[1:56:33] Thursday which day it was going to come
[1:56:37] what if it come
[1:56:38] today are you ready what if it come now
[1:56:41] your promise come right now to you what
[1:56:43] if it come now I didn't promise it God
[1:56:46] promis it and God can't lie
[1:56:51] oh my my my my my my my you may be
[1:56:55] seated so the holy spirit will not
[1:56:58] misbehave itself in one person
[1:56:59] Hallelujah and behave itself in another
[1:57:02] it will make each person come into its
[1:57:07] character oh my so then this has nothing
[1:57:10] to do with
[1:57:12] Doctrine no it has nothing to do with
[1:57:15] doctrine that is why brother bam said I
[1:57:19] rather somebody right in their spirit
[1:57:22] and wrong in their Doctrine than
[1:57:26] somebody right in their Doctrine and
[1:57:28] wrong in their
[1:57:30] Spirit Hallelujah that's profound and
[1:57:33] that's very deep
[1:57:35] Hallelujah you see when somebody wrong
[1:57:38] in your spirit you can't correct that
[1:57:41] right that's right
[1:57:43] right when somebody WR in the spirit you
[1:57:46] can correct the wrong
[1:57:48] Doctrine
[1:57:50] [Applause]
[1:57:58] that's the truth so God is more
[1:58:01] concerned with your spirit than your
[1:58:03] teaching your spirit than your Doctrine
[1:58:07] God is more concerned about
[1:58:11] that when when the Bible say Jesus needs
[1:58:14] Pastor Samaria because he want to find
[1:58:16] his one well needs Pastor Samaria he got
[1:58:18] to reach out amen she's messed up she

[1:58:56] so she she she she could have get down
[1:58:57] inside of that but she didn't do that

[2:04:57] life now if the child was misbehaving
[2:04:59] itself the boy was not interested in the
[2:05:01] things of the Father's Farm or Kingdom
[2:05:03] how the Holy Spirit must feel today when
[2:05:05] it goes before God with the bow shame
[2:05:07] face and have to take a report of our
[2:05:10] indifferences in the churches today how
[2:05:12] we have laid aside all the baptism of
[2:05:13] the spirit how the churches are having a
[2:05:15] form of godliness n the power thereof
[2:05:17] how he blushed and say your daughters
[2:05:18] are dressing morally how you must blush
[2:05:20] and say your children can't even agree
[2:05:21] with one another long enough to have a
[2:05:25] meeting how they make fun of people
[2:05:28] that's called out and filled with the
[2:05:29] Holy Spirit how the Holy Ghost must feel
[2:05:32] to go before God with such a message as
[2:05:34] that coming back and saying they're
[2:05:35] having a form of godliness they don't
[2:05:37] believe in the Supernatural no more they
[2:05:38] won't even go to church on Wednesday
[2:05:40] night they want to stay and watch their
[2:05:41] favorite television
[2:05:43] program question the father will say
[2:05:46] listen there's a big one for me did you
[2:05:48] try did did did did you knock at the
[2:05:51] heart's
[2:05:52] door the father asking the holy did you

[2:06:12] your a
[2:06:13] word to see if you would change your
[2:06:15] ways change take
[2:06:17] heed how he must
[2:06:19] feel
[2:06:20] watch he trusted us like he did Adam and
[2:06:23] Eve to obey his word they fell and as
[2:06:26] soon as man gets things in his hand he
[2:06:27] will fall every time he cannot hold it
[2:06:29] himself it takes God to hold us but we
[2:06:31] notice what if the boy was a good boy
[2:06:34] how the teacher would shove out his
[2:06:35] chest walk up to the father and say I'm
[2:06:37] so glad sir to bring you the message of
[2:06:39] how your son is progressing he's just as
[2:06:41] smart as he can be he's just like you
[2:06:43] he's a chip of the old block he's just
[2:06:44] exactly like you he loves the thing you
[2:06:46] love he does the work exactly like You'
[2:06:49] done it when you was out there that's a
[2:06:52] report that's the kind of church that
[2:06:54] the Holy Ghost likes to witness before
[2:06:55] God and if that child did not obey oh
[2:06:58] my I was not an obedient child he was
[2:07:02] never was no more than a son it remained
[2:07:04] a son it had no inheritance that's right
[2:07:07] now we don't want to stay in that place
[2:07:10] you don't want to stay where you have no
[2:07:12] inheritance you want this
[2:07:14] inheritance I want to see a Church of
[2:07:18] God God in deep sincerity
[2:07:21] amen don't try to impress
[2:07:24] me hallelujah amen impress God Amen
[2:07:29] don't impress your sister or your
[2:07:30] brother or no no I want you to
[2:07:33] understand you have to get a
[2:07:34] relationship with your father Hallelujah
[2:07:37] if everybody doing a certain things you
[2:07:38] don't have to do everybody everybody
[2:07:39] doing you want to do what God wants you
[2:07:41] to do you're serving your
[2:07:44] father okay I want to see a Church of
[2:07:47] God in deep sincerity I want to see
[2:07:50] oldfashioned prayer
[2:07:51] meetings amen where the big Amen on that
[2:07:55] one Hallelujah I want to see the times
[2:07:58] when they can't leave church they just
[2:08:00] stay all night and pray and fast and
[2:08:02] call out until God answers Hallelujah
[2:08:04] instead of that it seemed like love has
[2:08:06] brindled away the love of God when this
[2:08:09] boy if he come up that way and did not
[2:08:11] become obedient didn't have the I like
[2:08:13] this one he did not have the action of
[2:08:16] his father did not try to carry his
[2:08:19] father's business on the way his father
[2:08:21] did then that child missed all his
[2:08:25] inheritance and another brother had to
[2:08:27] take his
[2:08:28] place oh that's a big one that's a big
[2:08:31] one you could miss your inheritance and
[2:08:34] then somebody pick up just where you
[2:08:35] left
[2:08:37] off I heard a statement there's no Miss
[2:08:39] opportunities you know somebody else
[2:08:41] stick up the ones you
[2:08:46] miss miss the opportunity you miss it
[2:08:50] the person who pick it up they go on and
[2:08:51] run with it am all right let's go so
[2:08:55] Jesus was always about the father's
[2:08:59] business doing that which was right in
[2:09:01] his sight not just about doing this and
[2:09:03] that and the church becomes to do that
[2:09:07] about the father's business I always do
[2:09:09] that which pleases my father now see and
[2:09:12] if the Pentecostals so if that child
[2:09:14] fails God raise up another child another
[2:09:16] son that's how we're doing right he not
[2:09:18] time if the Pentecostal fail God raise
[2:09:21] up the stones under Abraham God call God
[2:09:24] can call it from the Lutheran from the
[2:09:26] Baptist from the from the Presbyterian
[2:09:28] God is able of these stones to rise to
[2:09:30] Abraham somebody is going to see the
[2:09:33] vision and take it on God I hope to live
[2:09:37] to see that church when she rise in the
[2:09:40] power and the beauty of the Resurrection
[2:09:42] with the powers of God working through
[2:09:44] her signs and wonders following the
[2:09:46] Believers like it did in the New
[2:09:47] Testament
[2:09:49] not signs and wonders following the
[2:09:51] pastor signs and wonders
[2:09:53] follow say it out say it again the
[2:09:58] Believers these signs shall follow them
[2:10:01] that believe and the Lord himself went
[2:10:04] everywhere with them confirming the
[2:10:07] [Applause]
[2:10:10] word Oh Glory do you see that hallelujah
[2:10:14] hallelujah so now watch when the church
[2:10:17] now then if the church did obey how did
[2:10:19] you come and tell the father oh he's
[2:10:20] wonderful he's carrying out your work
[2:10:22] instructions letter by letter that's the
[2:10:25] kind of church that's the one the father
[2:10:27] says sure proud of that son you know
[2:10:28] what happens he's getting strained yet
[2:10:32] watch here we go this TI into last week
[2:10:35] message yet he might not be able to
[2:10:38] exercise all authority he hasn't got it
[2:10:41] yet he is still a son but he hasn't been
[2:10:45] placed so he's working like all the
[2:10:47] other Sons until God is ready at the
[2:10:51] appointed time and if he's a right kind
[2:10:53] of son then God could take him aside and
[2:10:56] place him in a position of full
[2:10:58] Authority Oh Glory to God know God
[2:11:00] longing for that oh Hallelujah here we
[2:11:03] go are you ready if that son proven to
[2:11:07] be a right kind of a son loved the
[2:11:10] father's business stayed right with his
[2:11:13] instructions the father then on a
[2:11:16] certain day took the son out before
[2:11:18] public set him up in a high place clothe
[2:11:20] him in a beautiful garment or what they
[2:11:22] call an adoption and positionally what
[2:11:24] he was oh Hallelujah you see
[2:11:28] Jesus had proven to God that he had been
[2:11:32] the right kind of son amen amen
[2:11:35] hallelujah and God took him up on the
[2:11:37] mountain and brought
[2:11:39] Witnesses that's the thing that God will
[2:11:41] do to his sons here on Earth someday he
[2:11:43] will call you a side church if you only
[2:11:45] obey him and stay on the word he will
[2:11:48] place into the church before the coming
[2:11:51] of Jesus all the powers that Christ had
[2:11:54] pour into the church all that and so on

[2:38:47] great among you let him serve put on the
[2:38:49] robe put on the plate come and
[2:38:52] serve serve now there's
[2:38:56] Kings butam says is up to me to work on
[2:39:00] my own salvation with God until these
[2:39:02] things are approved of God then sealed
[2:39:05] into the kingdom of God there is the
[2:39:07] holy spirit then you works of God but
[2:39:10] when these things are operating in You
[2:39:13] by God then you are sealed amen you see
[2:39:16] by Revelation you could operate it you
[2:39:18] could operate certain things somebody
[2:39:20] come in and you could be just be fing
[2:39:21] with your wife and door knock talk talk
[2:39:23] open door and God bless you God bless
[2:39:25] you but just just calling your wife it
[2:39:27] wasn't so much blessing inside but
[2:39:30] because of who come to the door you give
[2:39:32] a different face so you work anything
[2:39:34] real
[2:39:36] nice but then when it begin to operate
[2:39:38] in You by God it's not you no more it
[2:39:42] thunders it lives itself right out
[2:39:46] because it's that you is him in you oh
[2:39:49] praise the name of the Lord here is BM
[2:39:51] until these things from ordination 1962
[2:39:54] as scripturally proven and sealing to
[2:39:57] you as an individual then you are son
[2:39:59] and daughter of God it's the thing the
[2:40:01] fruit of the spirit that proves that
[2:40:02] you're in God oh hear this one almost
[2:40:06] done he said now watch Pentecost was
[2:40:09] born like a son but that same son was
[2:40:11] born in the family had to be adopted
[2:40:12] also that's right and there is where you
[2:40:14] miss your calling friend when the
[2:40:16] adoption time comes aha you mean there's
[2:40:20] a time for adoption yes when that time
[2:40:23] comes if the teure that raised that
[2:40:24] child found the child not worthy they
[2:40:26] remain a son but miss the
[2:40:28] adoption oh Hallelujah so Jesus was God
[2:40:33] example seed musicians come up please
[2:40:36] Hallelujah he was that example seed The
[2:40:38] Works will be manifested in him the same
[2:40:40] way that seed would of God he was
[2:40:42] example seed and when the Holy Ghost
[2:40:44] came upon him it was manif ested
[2:40:46] Hallelujah I just want to share with you
[2:40:48] a few thoughts
[2:40:50] scriptures to show you how much Jesus
[2:40:53] was connected to the father both in
[2:40:55] communion and in fellowship and in
[2:40:58] relating to the father this is from St
[2:41:00] John 5 so I wouldn't call all the
[2:41:01] scriptures I just want to read on Jesus
[2:41:03] answered and them said my father work
[2:41:05] hither to and I work therefore the Jews
[2:41:07] sought the more to kill him because he
[2:41:09] not only broken the Sabbath but said
[2:41:11] that God was his father making him equal
[2:41:14] with God
[2:41:17] I love that my father work and I work
[2:41:19] also by claiming God was his father they
[2:41:22] say he Mak himself equal with God and
[2:41:25] then answered Jesus said unto them
[2:41:26] verily I said unto you the son can do
[2:41:28] nothing of himself but what he see the
[2:41:31] father do for whatsoever things ever he
[2:41:33] doeth these also doeth the son likewise
[2:41:36] here we go for the Father loveth the Son
[2:41:40] and showeth him all things that himself
[2:41:43] doeth and he will show him great Works
[2:41:45] than these that you may Marvel for as
[2:41:47] the father raised up the dead and
[2:41:49] quickened them so the son quickeneth
[2:41:51] whom he
[2:41:52] willall so he was constantly plugging in
[2:41:55] to how the father operate I am operating
[2:41:58] Hallelujah isn't that right for the
[2:41:59] father judgeth no man but had committed
[2:42:02] all judgment unto the son that all men
[2:42:04] should honor the son even as they honor
[2:42:05] the father he that honth not the son
[2:42:07] honor not the Father which has sent him
[2:42:09] for as the father had life in himself so
[2:42:11] had he given it to his son to have life
[2:42:13] in himself then Jesus said unto them
[2:42:16] verily verily I say unto you Moses give
[2:42:18] you not that bread from heaven but my
[2:42:20] father giveth you the true bread from
[2:42:22] heaven and for the bread of God is he
[2:42:24] which cometh down from heaven which
[2:42:26] giveth life unto the world all the
[2:42:28] father given me shall come to me and him
[2:42:30] that cometh to me I will nowise cast out
[2:42:32] he sent me he that sent me is with me
[2:42:34] and the father had not left me alone for
[2:42:36] I do those things which please him at
[2:42:39] that day you shall know I'm in the
[2:42:40] father ye and me and I in you he that ha
[2:42:42] my commandment and keepeth them he that
[2:42:44] loveth me and and he that love me shall
[2:42:46] be loved of my father and I will love
[2:42:47] him I will manifest myself to him and
[2:42:50] Judah said unto him not as Sky Lord how
[2:42:52] is it that thou would manifest th unto
[2:42:53] us and not unto the world and Jesus
[2:42:55] answered and said unto him if a man love
[2:42:57] me he will keep my words and my father
[2:42:59] will love him and we will come unto him
[2:43:02] and make our board with him he said
[2:43:04] loveth me not keepeth not my sayings and
[2:43:06] the word which you hear is not mine but
[2:43:08] the Father which sent me these things
[2:43:10] have I spoken unto you that being yet
[2:43:12] present with you but the comforter which
[2:43:15] is the Holy Ghost whom the father will
[2:43:17] send in my name he shall teach you all
[2:43:19] things and bring all things to
[2:43:21] remembrance oh my do you love him this
[2:43:24] morning this even God take pleasure or
[2:43:28] Delight in his son Matthew 3 identify
[2:43:31] that this is my son I am delighted in
[2:43:33] him I am pleased with him Matthew 17
[2:43:36] this is my son I'm pleased hear him
[2:43:38] isn't that right isn't that right God
[2:43:41] was pleased to have the fullness dwell
[2:43:43] in him Colossians 1:9 it pleased the
[2:43:46] father that in him should all fullness
[2:43:48] dwell isn't that right Isaiah 53:10 God
[2:43:52] was pleased to bruise him yet it pleased
[2:43:55] the Lord to bruise him he had put him to
[2:43:57] grief and when thou has made thy Soul an
[2:43:59] offering for sin he shall see a seed he
[2:44:01] shall prolong his days and the pledge of
[2:44:03] the Lord shall prosper in his hand and
[2:44:04] the final one 1 Corinthians 1:21 God is
[2:44:08] pleased in the foolishness of preaching
[2:44:11] to save them that believe for after that
[2:44:14] in the wisdom of God the World by wisdom
[2:44:16] knew not God it pleased God by the
[2:44:19] foolishness of preaching to save them
[2:44:21] that believe are you going to be that
[2:44:24] bright kind of son Hallelujah not
[2:44:27] everything easy not everything smooth he
[2:44:30] learned obedience by what he suffered he
[2:44:32] was bruised God was pleased to bruise

[2:44:39] of us let's all stand and Worship the

[2:59:20] again no question about it amen
[2:59:25] amen glory so I just want to read uh we
[2:59:31] do have two prayer requests we want to
[2:59:33] approach the throne of grace before we
[2:59:36] close out in prayer and announcements
[2:59:39] and uh we have a prayer request uh from
[2:59:42] Sister Trisha asking to the Saints
[2:59:44] prayers for my grandmother who was wed
[2:59:47] at the
[2:59:48] hospital um the doctors have removed
[2:59:50] four of her toes and pray for God's
[2:59:52] grace to strengthen her at this
[2:59:55] time and uh from Sister Lydia Gil
[2:59:58] requesting prayer for severe pain in
[3:00:00] both legs and constant fever the cause
[3:00:03] cannot be determined by the
[3:00:06] doctors asking God for results of the
[3:00:09] test to be returned negative and for a
[3:00:11] complete healing and if there's any
[3:00:15] unspoken or Unwritten requests that you
[3:00:18] want to show by raise of hands as we
[3:00:20] approach the throne of grace this
[3:00:23] morning can we bow our heads in
[3:00:25] reverence and respect to the presence of
[3:00:27] deity in our midst because God says
[3:00:30] where there are two or three gathered in
[3:00:31] his name there he is in the midst of
[3:00:33] them and the word has already gone forth
[3:00:36] and the atmosphere is right for healing
[3:00:38] to take place healing not just physical
[3:00:41] healing but healing of your Soul healing
[3:00:44] of your mind is there not a bom in
[3:00:46] Gilead is there not a physician there
[3:00:48] he's here to heal broken hearts he's
[3:00:50] here to not just heal cancer and high
[3:00:53] blood pressure and tumor but if you're
[3:00:55] backslid he could heal you he could heal
[3:00:58] your trouble and you can't sleep at
[3:01:00] night he could heal you he could he
[3:01:02] could heal your family he could heal
[3:01:04] your marriage he could heal whatever you
[3:01:06] going through whatever the pain is he is
[3:01:09] he is a Healer He Is A Healer this
[3:01:11] morning can we bow our heads in a word
[3:01:13] of Prayer our gracious Heavenly Father
[3:01:15] Lord the word today was so rich so pure
[3:01:19] so real it was so tangible to us father
[3:01:22] we can't help ourselves but acknowledge
[3:01:25] that the season has changed and Lord God
[3:01:28] we know you are the god of Elijah you
[3:01:30] are the god of William Mariam brandom
[3:01:33] you are the same yesterday today and
[3:01:35] forever and Lord the Pastor said Lord
[3:01:38] when you read the quote that if the same
[3:01:40] conditions exist Lord you will have to
[3:01:42] do the same thing and Lord there's a
[3:01:45] change that has taken place father Lord
[3:01:48] because your word taught as if my people
[3:01:50] would humble themselves and pray and
[3:01:52] seek my face and turn from their Wicked
[3:01:55] Ways they will hear from Heaven how we
[3:01:57] thank you for the prayer meeting last
[3:01:59] night and how we thank you for the
[3:02:00] service today and Lord we feel the
[3:02:03] effects of that restoration of
[3:02:05] communication and that relationship with
[3:02:08] you and Lord your children have brought
[3:02:10] request to the throne of grace this
[3:02:12] morning Lord for sister Lydia Lord God
[3:02:16] may you touch her right now wherever she
[3:02:18] is from the crown of her head to the SS
[3:02:20] of her feet the doctors don't know what
[3:02:22] it is but you know what it is Father the
[3:02:25] doctors will never figure out what it is
[3:02:27] but you know what it is and father you
[3:02:29] said whatever we bind on Earth is bound
[3:02:31] in heaven whatever we loose on Earth is
[3:02:33] loosed in heaven don't me you loose her
[3:02:36] right now we bind the works of darkness
[3:02:39] we send that sickness that fever that
[3:02:42] pain we send it back to the pit of Hell
[3:02:45] Lord God may you touch your daughter may
[3:02:47] she go free right now and Lord God for
[3:02:51] sister Trisha and the situation with her

[3:03:32] kind of sons coming into
[3:03:35] position
[3:03:37] Hallelujah father we commit your people
[3:03:39] into your hands we pray a special
[3:03:42] blessing on the pastor Lord for the
[3:03:44] burden Lord he has for weeks he has been
[3:03:47] talking about this service and to see
[3:03:49] the Holy Ghost drop down and set your
[3:03:51] people free it's not about church it's
[3:03:54] not about being in the message but we
[3:03:56] are Sons and Daughters of the Living God
[3:04:00] and we could be the right kind of sons
[3:04:02] to have access to every Redemptive right
[3:04:05] that is given to us it belongs to us
[3:04:09] those things which are revealed they
[3:04:11] belong to us and to our chch children
[3:04:14] forever forever father may you bless
[3:04:18] your people Lord may you grant traveling
[3:04:20] mercies may you bring us back at the
[3:04:23] appointed time May Lord this never stop
[3:04:26] may we just keep growing in strength to
[3:04:29] strength may your people commit in their
[3:04:31] hearts to pray more to cry out more to
[3:04:35] study more and one of these days
[3:04:37] there'll be a service where the
[3:04:39] musicians cannot play and the song
[3:04:40] leader cannot sing and the minister
[3:04:43] cannot Minister because the Holy Ghost
[3:04:45] itself will drop down and take over
[3:04:48] father may you bless your people bless
[3:04:51] the remaining portion of the service
[3:04:54] Lord and what is to transpire next

[3:04:59] hands in the precious name of Jesus
[3:05:01] Christ and the church says amen and amen

[3:05:15] Lord service continues on Thursday at
[3:05:18] 7:30 p.m. come under great
[3:05:22] expectation this coming Sunday would be
[3:05:25] two services at 10:00 a.m. and our 3:00
[3:05:28] p.m. Lord supper it's the 1st for 2017
[3:05:32] and it's a sacred commandment of God do
[3:05:35] this in
[3:05:37] remembrance of me
[3:05:40] hallelujah it's not an option
[3:05:44] it's you signifying to God that you are
[3:05:48] remembering what he came to
[3:05:50] do you're kidding yourself as a
[3:05:53] Christian if you think it's just coming
[3:05:55] and attending a church service there are
[3:05:58] a number of things that God placed in
[3:06:00] Scripture that we must do to be
[3:06:03] identified and that Holy Communion that
[3:06:07] Lord's Supper is one of them so I
[3:06:10] challenge you for this week because you
[3:06:12] cannot take communion if you're living
[3:06:14] any kind of life so you are being
[3:06:16] challenged this week to reassess and
[3:06:19] look into the mirror of the word
[3:06:22] consecrate yourself sanctify
[3:06:24] yourself come to that service on
[3:06:26] Thursday night and on Sunday we will
[3:06:29] have two Services make it your business
[3:06:32] to have your life in order so when you
[3:06:34] come to that communion line you are
[3:06:36] standing knowing god I want to serve you
[3:06:40] I've never served you before as brother
[3:06:43] over it said it's not a question of if
[3:06:45] you are a son that's not the issue it's
[3:06:46] what kind of son what kind of daughter
[3:06:50] what kind of life so every day ignore
[3:06:54] the distractions ignore what's happening
[3:06:56] around you and focus on your destination
[3:07:00] because we are like an arrow just
[3:07:02] passing through time we are heading out
[3:07:04] of here this world is temporary this the
[3:07:07] pain is temporary the bills are
[3:07:09] temporary It's All Temporary so make
[3:07:12] that effort maintenance group two please
