[32:27] an apostle to the church who could
[32:30] figure it out where God bypassed the
[32:33] linen the well thought of people and get
[32:36] humble hearts that that he could use and

[53:32] during these times and I could not

[53:37] I looked at their little screen they got
[53:39] there a CNN or whatever it was and I had
[53:43] to mention to brother Colin when I said
[53:44] look at this
[53:45] I saw put in shaking hands with Donald
[53:48] Trump eyes right there on the screen I
[53:51] said to brother Colin banner if put in

[53:56] shake hands with anybody we must be at
[54:06] the end time man amen praise be to God
[54:11] so the Lord richly bless you shall we
[54:14] stand to our feet as we go for a short
[54:17] time in the Word of God I meant a little
[54:19] message I brought to my church last
[54:21] Sunday it just took me about it over an
[54:23] hour with translation so we shall be too
[54:26] long today but we want to speak on a
[54:28] great subject called representation by
[54:32] three destinations while I'm going into
[54:36] it if I do this that by the Isaac knows
[54:38] that means to go on to the next slide
[54:40] I brought some little pictures as well
[54:42] because some young people come to me
[54:44] they say you know pasta those little
[54:46] pictures help me to kind of understand
[54:49] when you a picture says a thousand words
[54:51] you know so are you fine right through
[54:54] our do little pictures to kind of bring
[54:56] it home to help our little fellas to
[54:58] kind of get them to grab the inspiration
[55:00] let's go over to the scriptures brother
[55:02] Isaac and I think I can just read them
[55:04] from here a few directional scriptures
[55:06] there and you will say to me yes they're
[55:08] well-known but sometimes you can do
[55:11] something you know it well but then some
[55:14] one day the fire strikes it amen and it
[55:17] just becomes alive so st. Luke 10
[55:19] remembering the subject representation
[55:23] by predestination Luke 2010 20 if you
[55:28] join me there notwithstanding in this
[55:32] rejoice not that that the spirits are
[55:34] subject
[55:35] to you I mean that's wonderful but
[55:38] rather rejoice because your names are
[55:42] written in heaven Romans 8:15 for ye
[55:49] have not received the spirit of bondage
[55:52] again to fear but you have received the
[55:56] spirit of adoption whereby we cry Abba
[56:02] Father amen and verse 29 of the same
[56:06] chapter goes on to say for whom he did
[56:10] foreknow also did he did predestinate to
[56:16] be conformed to the image of his son but
[56:21] he might be the firstborn among many
[56:23] brethren
[56:25] jumping to verse 30 moreover whom he did
[56:28] predestinate them he also caught whom he
[56:32] called he justified and whom he
[56:35] justified them he also glorified my and
[56:39] finally Ephesians 1:5 and in a beautiful
[56:42] scripture for today having predestinated
[56:46] us unto the adoption of children by
[56:52] Jesus Christ to himself according to the
[56:57] good pleasure of his will the church
[57:00] said a man
[57:01] let us bow our heads gracious Almighty
[57:05] God I just feel so happy today just to
[57:09] be gathered Lord as the pastor has
[57:11] mentioned that holy convocation Lord and
[57:15] how brother Branham has centered Lord
[57:17] this great promise right in our day
[57:20] their God that we may know what we have
[57:22] been called unto their God we thank you
[57:25] to be gathered in this way dear God
[57:27] Lord because you said where the carcass
[57:29] is the Eagles will be gathered there
[57:33] there God we give you glory and praise
[57:35] and may you bless every heart today
[57:37] those on line two may they be blessed as

[57:44] the the prophet has already brought you
[57:46] are living in the days of the voice of
[57:48] the seventh angel the Prophet himself
[57:51] may be gone but his voice is still here

[1:08:36] came to that bush it anointed what he
[1:08:38] believed what an anointing something on
[1:08:42] the inside came out something on the
[1:08:45] inside was stimulated hallelujah because

[1:09:37] sex marriage and all these things going
[1:09:39] on demoralization of the world and the
[1:09:42] women don't even let me talk about that
[1:09:44] the men and the churches and the nation
[1:09:48] oh how it depresses us how it depresses

[1:15:50] the way before Jesus comes it ain't
[1:15:52] gonna go all the way before Jesus comes

[1:16:15] here's something for you to look at he
[1:16:16] says you never tell a Pentecostal that's
[1:16:19] sanctification all of it because he's
[1:16:22] seen the restoration of the gifts he
[1:16:23] ain't gonna believe that he's got more
[1:16:26] than that and that's that last Church
[1:16:30] age that we had the Bible says there'll
[1:16:32] be no more Church ages we know there's
[1:16:36] not going to be another church age the
[1:16:38] scripture says this church age the seven
[1:16:41] church ages how many seven but this to
[1:16:46] be a gathering of the people there's to
[1:16:50] be a gathering of the people see and
[1:16:52] here we are how many thought that
[1:16:56] there's no more Church ages they make us

[1:17:39] convocation and somebody will say oh
[1:17:42] that's back in Leviticus that's back way
[1:17:45] back thousands of years ago but brother

[1:18:08] is going to be here who said so
[1:18:11] that prophecy says glory to God
[1:18:14] he says there's going to be a holy
[1:18:17] convocation and you shall offer an
[1:18:19] offering made by fire unto the Lord who
[1:18:22] wants to offer a hallelujah made by fire

[1:19:01] it it's a restoration back to the first
[1:19:03] day when you hit seven you have to go

[1:19:09] you've got to go right back to one back
[1:19:12] to the first day and the fathers and the
[1:19:15] restoration of the Pentecostal genuine
[1:19:17] not sensations he says the same light

[1:19:32] telling my title somebody tell me
[1:19:36] representation of if you are a
[1:19:39] representation up here in this attribute

[1:19:53] the book you're in you are represented
[1:19:56] here you you are in the eternal which
[1:20:01] explains why people can't understand you
[1:20:03] they can't understand you you are part
[1:20:06] of the eternal by the baptism of the
[1:20:10] Holy Ghost hallelujah you're included in
[1:20:14] this praise better gone

[1:20:17] getting so sweet here it says in fact
[1:20:20] let me tell you something else you stand
[1:20:22] as if you never sinned in the first
[1:20:26] place
[1:20:29] because when you enter eternity you go
[1:20:33] before you sing hallellujah hallellujah
[1:20:38] when you enter eternity you enter before
[1:20:41] you even committed the sin glory to God
[1:20:44] so you stand so you never sinned in the
[1:20:49] first place you the blood of Jesus
[1:20:55] Christ hallelujah Amen let's give God a

[1:21:08] what happens to the plant it says spoke
[1:21:11] what's next tassel what's next
[1:21:15] shucks there so that's one two three
[1:21:17] then grain comes out of that he says the
[1:21:22] three stages of it till it gets to the
[1:21:24] grain three stages of it till it gets to
[1:21:27] the grain praise God exactly God 4
[1:21:30] indicates that he says the predestinated
[1:21:32] is the only one that's considered in the
[1:21:36] redemption hallelujah
[1:21:39] because redemption means bring back
[1:21:43] hallelujah
[1:21:44] so when you get to the grain it's not
[1:21:46] something new it goes back to the
[1:21:48] original the Alpha becomes the Omega
[1:21:53] hallelujah the predestinated is
[1:21:56] considered in the in the the
[1:21:58] predestination in the Redemption next

[1:22:09] person of the Holy Ghost which is Christ
[1:22:12] coming down and dwelling in the human
[1:22:14] heart this is beyond Pentecost
[1:22:17] this is beyond the camp this is beyond
[1:22:20] speaking in tongues the fire is just yet
[1:22:23] too clean to make it clean let's go to
[1:22:27] the next one brother Isaac we're moving
[1:22:28] quickly now

[1:22:31] person not just an old one patched up
[1:22:35] by joining church and turning a new page

[1:23:33] peace you can be at peace you don't have
[1:23:37] to be worried hallelujah
[1:23:40] I heard a story just the other day a man
[1:23:43] a conversation between a wave and the
[1:23:46] sea and the wave you know the way it
[1:23:51] spoke to the sea and said oh you're so
[1:23:55] big
[1:23:55] I want to be like you I'm just a wave
[1:23:59] but you are the big sea advise me what
[1:24:04] must I do advise me what must I do I'm
[1:24:07] just a wave and the sea said wave if you
[1:24:12] want to be like me the first thing you
[1:24:15] have to do is calm down
[1:24:20] calm down and we can combat it I'm
[1:24:24] predestinated my life is in the book
[1:24:28] Satan you card you can't stop me
[1:24:31] hallelujah we're not running here and
[1:24:34] running there we are stable we are
[1:24:37] several shouting in somebody you like
[1:24:40] that one amen
[1:24:41] praise God let's go on to the next one
[1:24:44] brother Isaac praise be to God I mean
[1:24:46] let's go into somebody tell me the title
[1:24:48] there what's it called let's go back now
[1:24:52] to Adam because Adam caused this whole
[1:24:55] thing were you there when Adam sinned
[1:24:58] you see he did it he did it you know you
[1:25:02] but you were affected you came under
[1:25:05] that representation and through
[1:25:08] condemnation if that's all right shout
[1:25:11] Amen to me Amen many times I've heard
[1:25:14] people say listen brother branham Adam
[1:25:16] and Eve did the evil and that's just
[1:25:19] true the hybrid the Word of God that's
[1:25:22] true they reasoned and calls us to get
[1:25:24] into this condition it's good God is
[1:25:27] unjust if he condemns me I never did
[1:25:29] that brother better it was Adam not
[1:25:31] sinned I was born in shape a shape in
[1:25:34] iniquity somebody represented me amen
[1:25:38] and here's a thought he says you're
[1:25:40] condemned because Adam condemned you and
[1:25:45] condemned the world that's fair comment
[1:25:48] that is condemnation by representing
[1:25:51] thank God it doesn't stop there let's go
[1:25:54] one more brother Isaac amen
[1:25:56] he says you are a sinner by
[1:25:58] representation amen you're a sinner by
[1:26:02] representation he hold but he says he
[1:26:05] does he doesn't hold you responsible for
[1:26:07] being a sinner but he holds you
[1:26:10] responsible because you don't help
[1:26:12] yourself
[1:26:14] because there's a way being made for you
[1:26:19] and if you reject that way then God
[1:26:23] condemns you let's go on brother Isaac
[1:26:25] there's a way May sorry this is a shock
[1:26:28] of a picture but let's be shot that
[1:26:30] Christ has died for us he says Adam and
[1:26:33] Eve represented me as a sinner but Jesus
[1:26:38] came to represent us also they are under
[1:26:43] another representation the
[1:26:45] representation of the last Adam which is
[1:26:48] Jesus Christ hallelujah
[1:26:50] he came to represent us - amen
[1:26:53] let's go on brother Isaac hallelujah he
[1:26:55] says he says now you that says it's
[1:26:58] wrong to be represented by Adam as a
[1:27:01] sinner what about representation we have
[1:27:04] salvation the same way Adam condemned us
[1:27:09] Christ has justified us if we accept the
[1:27:13] way that's been made God's only provided
[1:27:16] way how are we ever gonna be saved one
[1:27:20] come to represent us and his name is G
[1:27:25] he came to represent us before God as
[1:27:28] sons and daughters of God he sent His
[1:27:31] Holy Spirit hallelujah but if you don't
[1:27:34] help yourself then he then God condemns
[1:27:36] you but if you receive this way he will
[1:27:39] bless you let's go on brother Isaac he
[1:27:42] says now he says you talk about a
[1:27:44] Jubilee you talk about a time when that
[1:27:48] lamb walked forth because he is our
[1:27:51] representative everybody was waiting
[1:27:54] John was weeping because there was no
[1:27:56] representative but then his
[1:27:59] representative came out let's go there
[1:28:01] Eliza amen he says the first thing that
[1:28:04] represented Kamisha represented
[1:28:07] that Redemption was the lamb that had
[1:28:11] been slain from the foundation of the
[1:28:13] world he was the kinsman redeemer can we
[1:28:17] all shout kinsman redeemer he was not
[1:28:21] the kinsman reformer he was up a king's
[1:28:25] man legalist hey man he was not the
[1:28:28] Kings man preacher he was the kinsman
[1:28:31] redeemer and he's going to redeem her
[1:28:34] young people he's gonna redeem you let's
[1:28:37] clap those hands and shout amen he's
[1:28:39] trying to redeem you hallelujah
[1:28:42] hey man and joy he took the book glory a
[1:28:46] man and he opened the book and he tore
[1:28:49] off the seals amen and sent it down to
[1:28:52] the earth to his seventh angel to reveal
[1:28:54] it to his people
[1:28:55] hallelujah he was how representation no
[1:28:59] man was worthy no man was worthy to read
[1:29:01] the book no man was worthy to even touch
[1:29:04] the book but Jesus was our
[1:29:06] representation by predestination
[1:29:10] hallelujah hallelujah let's go fellows
[1:29:13] like a man came in and brother when we
[1:29:16] get up there I tell you I thought I put
[1:29:17] this in brother over it is so sweet over
[1:29:19] here every minister will stand on his
[1:29:21] ministry with his congregation and the
[1:29:24] question will be asked a man they say
[1:29:27] that the angel that was speaking said
[1:29:28] whirlpool after stand - said yes
[1:29:31] he said I know I'm all right because
[1:29:33] I've preached the same word that Paul
[1:29:34] has preached
[1:29:36] and when I did that millions screamed
[1:29:40] out that's where we're resting that's
[1:29:43] where we're resting and church let me
[1:29:45] tell you I'm arresting in the
[1:29:49] representation of predestination
[1:29:52] provided by Jesus Christ and that is the
[1:29:55] word of God whenever that prophet said I
[1:29:58] believe it
[1:29:59] hallelujah with all of my heart amen
[1:30:02] amen
[1:30:03] let's move on praise be to God let's see
[1:30:05] a man he says God don't hold you
[1:30:07] responsible for being a sinner he won't
[1:30:10] hold you responsible from now on but he
[1:30:13] holds you responsible if you reject this
[1:30:17] when these guys start to criticize the
[1:30:19] cloud criticize the Prophet I feel sorry
[1:30:22] because they're playing with fire
[1:30:25] hallelujah this is God's provided way
[1:30:28] this is God's provided representation
[1:30:31] through this message you can make it
[1:30:33] this message can take all of Adam out of
[1:30:36] your life but if you reject it you are
[1:30:40] finished brother I'm gonna stand with
[1:30:43] this message I'm gonna stand right here
[1:30:45] I'm resting on this the Prophet said it
[1:30:49] I believe it that settles it amen praise
[1:30:53] be to God
[1:30:54] [Applause]
[1:30:56] hallelujah let's go up on Isaac praise
[1:30:58] be to God hallelujah it takes something
[1:31:01] to flash across that in 1975 somebody
[1:31:05] gave me serpent seed something flash
[1:31:08] tomorrow the deepest message you can
