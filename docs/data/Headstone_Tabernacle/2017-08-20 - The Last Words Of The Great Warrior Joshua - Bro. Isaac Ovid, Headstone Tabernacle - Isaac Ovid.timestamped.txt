[50:39] well the team of the meetings in Nigeria
[50:41] was the hour of God deliverance and what
[50:43] a tremendous time that we had for me it
[50:46] was a defining meeting and it all come
[50:49] together it was every single service was
[50:52] so anointed in other supernatural level
[50:55] from the very start of the very food
[50:57] service and it's impressive to see the
[51:01] sacrifices some of these believers make
[51:03] to come to meetings you know and I
[51:06] quickly put because I mean but their
[51:08] group just had two meals and but but
[51:10] that's what they could do one song like
[51:11] that and and the believers dear and to
[51:14] see Power Plus before service they'll be
[51:16] singing waiting for the doors to be open
[51:18] and I don't know who this hold it in
[51:20] front day but a half I put a clip of my
[51:22] Facebook page and another sample of it
[51:24] but I was something else to be hearing
[51:26] the moving and the singing and the just
[51:27] waitin for the doors to be open and the
[51:30] atmosphere was just Rocking
[51:32] praise God so each minister delivered to
[51:34] the people the wood and seasoned food
[51:36] for the Soul strength for the journey
[51:37] and moisten and power that was
[51:40] throughout their meetings the believers
[51:42] would line up up before all those
[51:45] Auckland singing wait and what
[51:47] atmosphere it was an experience to be
[51:49] there and the host pastor but our
[51:51] culture we did a tremendous job because
[51:54] what Shri services the D I wonder how
[51:57] that could be accomplished but my
[51:59] goodness when Gordon Han is something
[52:01] it's done perfectly
[52:03] I couldn't believe it could have been
[52:05] executed in Africa with such efficiency
[52:07] and and whatever but they got really
[52:09] really bless it but a key but a
[52:11] channeler myself but a Jessie Robledo
[52:14] but a daily but I Isaac but every month
[52:16] Thompson butter Olu and brother
[52:18] this morning before what I succumb and
[52:21] speak I want you to understand the Bible
[52:25] speaks about being Suba tomorrow
[52:28] supposed to have a solar eclipse amazing
[52:31] solar eclipse that people talking about
[52:33] a lot because they know we'll have big
[52:35] significance that God said before he
[52:37] does anything on earth you're going to
[52:39] give a signal of it in heaven and I
[52:42] believe America is already judged
[52:44] already judged they are just waited for
[52:47] sentences then you know how they operate
[52:50] in the court the judge you and this is
[52:52] sentences next six months or next year
[52:54] or next two months you have to come back
[52:56] for these sentences after the penalty
[52:57] that goes without judgment neither vivo
[53:00] America is already judge just waitin for
[53:03] the sentences so we ought not to be
[53:06] unaware or taking on our ways or be
[53:10] surprised of what is yet to come because
[53:12] it's coming whether you're ready or not
[53:14] is - coming it doesn't matter where you
[53:16] think or what you feel or what you have
[53:18] it ready or not it's so common are you
[53:20] with me so therefore this is a major one
[53:23] for last
[53:24] last one was about 58 years ago so we
[53:27] know that will bring its own drama with
[53:32] people or the doomsday is coming out
[53:34] everybody come another state would they
[53:36] waive any she is watch this
[53:37] this is a moon get that out amen and the
[53:41] Isaiah prophesy groans doctors covered
[53:44] is it rock doesn't suffer the people but
[53:46] God went to sunlight
[53:47] upon his pride upon his people but this
[53:51] would be sober it means be serious be
[53:55] thoughtful be steady be level-headed the
[54:00] businesslike be strained don't act like
[54:03] a junkman those that drunk this junk in
[54:06] the night be sober because of what is
[54:09] coming up on the face of the earth
[54:10] remember in the day of Sodom and so on
[54:13] when the power the waterfall they were
[54:15] going to work normal he was going to
[54:17] withdraw their monthly pee normal
[54:19] there's going to the groceries I pick up
[54:20] some butter and some sugar or whatever
[54:23] normal but far on the waterfall but but
[54:26] besides those people were not aware
[54:27] there was a elected Bunch
[54:29] that was called out that bunch was
[54:32] represented by the man called Abraham
[54:34] when God was speaking he said shall I
[54:36] hide from Abraham what I'm about to do
[54:38] something was about to happen so God had
[54:42] to make sure he got a word to his people
[54:43] before it happened
[54:45] and once something went to take place
[54:47] God must get a word to his people and I
[54:50] believe they're gonna get a word from
[54:51] the Lord this morning praise be to Jesus
[54:55] that one was done along with you
[54:57] but brother Brandon said this on what is
[54:59] the Holy Ghost he said no it's grieve
[55:02] not the Holy Spirit whereby you are
[55:04] filled until you dare Redemption that's
[55:07] a new word you must be sealed so if not
[55:09] there's no word for you to come and join
[55:11] just joint church and shake somebody
[55:12] hands you come to be sealed sealed with
[55:17] God or get his Mack because in the last
[55:20] days there be two marks not 10 not 15 or

[55:25] and the Mac of the beasts all those who
[55:28] don't get the Mac of God will take the
[55:29] mark of the beast so what you want is
[55:31] the mask of God what you come for is to
[55:34] be marked by God and the mark of God
[55:37] upon your life means devil you could
[55:38] watch but you can't touch that is what
[55:40] the mark of God means that mark is the
[55:44] same as the blood over the doorpost when
[55:46] I see the blood I'm going to pass over
[55:49] you that is what that map represents you

[1:09:25] greetings and introductions reading from
[1:09:27] the book of Joshua Joshua chapter 24 and
[1:09:34] reading
[1:09:36] from verse 14 Joshua 24 and verse 14 now
[1:09:46] therefore fear the Lord and serve Him in
[1:09:50] sincerity and in truth and put away the

[1:10:13] day whom you will serve whether the gods

[1:10:33] his word you may be seated
[1:10:35] so I greet you this morning in the
[1:10:38] precious and wonderful name of the Lord
[1:10:41] Jesus Christ is certainly good to be
[1:10:43] home and to be in a presence of the Lord
[1:10:45] on Sunday morning there are so many
[1:10:48] people don't have this privilege and it
[1:10:51] will be a privilege we will not have
[1:10:54] always there will come a time and we
[1:10:56] will not be able to meet like this and
[1:10:59] the comforts of church will no longer
[1:11:02] exist and there will be no more
[1:11:04] opportunity to pretend and to play
[1:11:06] Church it will either be that you are
[1:11:08] real or you are not real so we are
[1:11:11] looking forward for a day that's coming
[1:11:14] like no other day a time is coming like
[1:11:16] no other time because this is not our
[1:11:18] home we are just passing through and
[1:11:20] every day we come closer to
[1:11:24] transitioning from time into eternity
[1:11:26] and we long for the day when we will see
[1:11:29] David and see Abraham and see no one and
[1:11:32] see the Prophet and because we are not
[1:11:34] creatures of time we are creatures of
[1:11:36] eternity and but overed you were
[1:11:39] speaking about the great convention that
[1:11:41] we had in Enugu Nigeria was really a
[1:11:44] tremendous meeting and the inspiration
[1:11:47] and he said was the arrow of God's
[1:11:49] deliverance and I just want to touch
[1:11:51] that just briefly before I get to my
[1:11:53] text this morning because it provided
[1:11:56] for me the foundation for how I even got
[1:11:59] this message this morning now you could
[1:12:02] look through your Bibles you can have a
[1:12:04] little Sunday School this morning
[1:12:05] second Kings 13 and reading verse 14
[1:12:13] second Kings 13 and reading verse 14 and
[1:12:16] the Bible says now Elisha was fallen
[1:12:19] sick of his sickness whereof he died so
[1:12:23] it was not it was not like a common call
[1:12:26] it was a sickness for which they knew he
[1:12:28] was about to go and joash the king of
[1:12:32] Israel came down unto Him and wept over
[1:12:34] his feet and that all my father my
[1:12:36] father the chariot of Israel and the
[1:12:39] horsemen thereof so josh is actually
[1:12:42] saying what Elijah would have said when
[1:12:45] Elijah was leaving when the mantle was
[1:12:48] passed on Elijah this was the word that
[1:12:51] Elijah would have said and here it is
[1:12:53] Elijah now is on his deathbed as it were
[1:12:56] and joash is coming to him with the same
[1:12:59] declaration my father my father the
[1:13:04] chariot Israel and the horseman thereof
[1:13:06] and at this time the children of Israel
[1:13:09] were under oppression from the Syrians
[1:13:12] so Elijah in verse 15 said unto Him take
[1:13:15] bow and arrows and he took unto Him bow
[1:13:17] and arrows and he said to the king of
[1:13:19] Israel put down hand upon the bow and he
[1:13:23] put his hand upon it and he lies so put
[1:13:25] his hands upon the Kings hand and he
[1:13:28] that opened a window east when he opened
[1:13:30] it and Elijah said shoot and he shot and
[1:13:34] he said the arrow of the laws
[1:13:35] deliverance and the arrow of deliverance
[1:13:38] from Syria for those out smite the
[1:13:41] Syrians and affect till thou have
[1:13:44] consumed them but it didn't end there he
[1:13:47] said take the arrows and he took them
[1:13:49] and he said unto the king of Israel
[1:13:51] smite upon the ground and he smote
[1:13:55] thrice three times and Steve he stopped
[1:13:58] and the man of God was rock with him
[1:14:01] angry and said thou
[1:14:03] sort of spittin five or six times then
[1:14:06] had his doubts mitten cereal
[1:14:08] till thou has consumed it whereas now
[1:14:12] thou shalt smite Syria but thrice and
[1:14:15] Elijah died and they buried him and I'll
[1:14:19] pause there for a minute
[1:14:21] so for the entire convention the
[1:14:24] ministers were speaking around the hour
[1:14:25] of God's deliverance and the Prophet
[1:14:27] said the hour of God's deliverance is
[1:14:30] the Holy Ghost it is the Holy Spirit and
[1:14:32] in the Memphis the error of God's
[1:14:34] deliverance shot from a boat but the
[1:14:36] random said God shut that arrow into the
[1:14:39] early church on the day of Pentecost and
[1:14:41] in every age in every time when they
[1:14:44] needed deliverance God would send the
[1:14:46] arrow of deliverance into the situation
[1:14:49] as a sign that the power of God was
[1:14:51] there but when we read the situation
[1:14:54] with Elijah Elijah told him to shoot
[1:14:56] pick up the air Owen and strike the
[1:14:59] ground he didn't tell the King how much
[1:15:02] time to strike and by the venom said
[1:15:04] that joão's was back slidden of the king
[1:15:06] he was back slidden as a leader that's
[1:15:09] why you only struck three times and the
[1:15:12] prophet of God did if you are struck
[1:15:13] five or six you would have completely
[1:15:16] finished the enemy but because you only
[1:15:19] struck three times you will only have
[1:15:22] three victories so the scripture was
[1:15:25] bringing a connection between activity
[1:15:28] and results the more you do the more you
[1:15:30] get out of it if you strike once you
[1:15:33] have one victory you have strike two you
[1:15:35] get two victories you psyche three you
[1:15:37] get three victories but if you go beyond
[1:15:40] your limitations go beyond your ideas so
[1:15:44] aim to us and pushed and hit four times
[1:15:46] and hit and the Prophet said five or six
[1:15:49] and I said to them in enugu the Prophet
[1:15:52] didn't tell him exactly how much was
[1:15:54] necessary so if he says five or six five
[1:15:57] I believe would have been enough six
[1:16:00] would have been extra he was telling to
[1:16:03] us if you are done extra you would have
[1:16:05] made sure and wiped the enemy out and
[1:16:08] that's what we have come to do this
[1:16:10] morning
[1:16:12] some extra three times is not enough
[1:16:17] Jeff lifting your hands is not enough
[1:16:20] praying once in the morning is not
[1:16:23] enough have you prayed three times four
[1:16:26] times five times up he would have a
[1:16:29] different result because the arrow of
[1:16:31] God's deliverance has already been shot
[1:16:34] can the church team and everybody with
[1:16:39] me this morning so as I was meditating
[1:16:46] on this Scripture and this inspiration
[1:16:49] was so powerful and we'll get to more of
[1:16:52] that I started to wonder here was Elijah
[1:16:59] leaving and his last words the last word
[1:17:05] that Elijah would speak was words of
[1:17:11] anger because after that verse the Bible
[1:17:15] says the next verse and Elijah died
[1:17:18] Elijah died with the words just before
[1:17:21] him saying those should have done more
[1:17:26] the last word Eliezer spoke was you did
[1:17:30] not do enough I told you to do something
[1:17:36] but instead of going all the way you
[1:17:40] struck three times when if you were done
[1:17:42] more you would have totally wiped out
[1:17:45] the enemy and the Bible says Elijah died
[1:17:52] and I started away who is you know that
[1:17:56] stuff that you would see in different
[1:17:58] situation there are times you're having
[1:17:59] fun and you will see whatever come to
[1:18:02] your Mountain you comment on politics
[1:18:05] you comment on the news you comment on
[1:18:07] where you went to school and maybe you
[1:18:10] tell your friends what trouble you're
[1:18:12] having at home and maybe you share this
[1:18:14] with this one and but there's something
[1:18:17] else when you are at the end of your
[1:18:20] road you see when someone is lying on
[1:18:25] deathbed words take on a different
[1:18:31] meaning because when you are the end of
[1:18:35] the world
[1:18:36] the end of the world or the end of your
[1:18:37] life all of a sudden the joke store any
[1:18:42] matter too much and your words have a
[1:18:47] whole different width and I have a
[1:18:50] question this morning if you knew that
[1:18:56] you would be speaking to someone for the
[1:18:58] very last time you would never see them
[1:19:02] again
[1:19:02] there'd be nothing more you could ever
[1:19:04] tell him again what would would you see
[1:19:09] if it was the last time that he would
[1:19:13] speak to some money what would your last
[1:19:17] words be and I go back to the thief on
[1:19:20] the cross he got anything he could have
[1:19:24] said but his last words were remember me
[1:19:29] and jesus said to him today you will be
[1:19:33] with me in paradise even Jesus had a
[1:19:38] choice of what his last words would be
[1:19:40] I'm in the last moment the last chapter
[1:19:43] of his life he said Father forgive them
[1:19:45] for they know not what they're doing and
[1:19:50] he ended it just earthly life with it is
[1:19:54] finished Joseph in his closing remarks
[1:20:00] said whatever you do take my bones with
[1:20:03] you because resurrection is coming don't
[1:20:08] leave me here in Egypt
[1:20:10] [Applause]
[1:20:18] Samson last words let me die with the
[1:20:23] Philistines last words that's what I
[1:20:32] want to speak about this morning so for
[1:20:37] a few minutes of this Bible study I have
[1:20:40] a tighter the last words of the great
[1:20:43] warrior Joshua the last words of the
[1:20:50] great warrior Joshua now Joshua was not
[1:20:55] a preacher the Branum said in the
[1:21:00] message great warrior Joshua he said
[1:21:02] that there was never a military leader
[1:21:04] in the past future present at any time
[1:21:08] like Joshua just so was a man in a class
[1:21:13] a category all by himself
[1:21:16] he was a warrior of warrior he was a
[1:21:19] soldier but to the end of just was
[1:21:23] ministry his ministry changed another
[1:21:27] fighting anymore but for some reasons us
[1:21:30] were found himself speaking a lot Joshua
[1:21:34] has 24 chapters the book of Joshua and
[1:21:38] just what 22 Joshua 23 and just what 24
[1:21:44] is all about Josh was speaking in just
[1:21:49] what 22 he is speaking to the
[1:21:51] two-and-a-half tribes who were given
[1:21:53] their portion on the other side of
[1:21:56] Jordan in just what parent III is
[1:22:01] because of the leaders of Israel and
[1:22:04] he's reminding them to stay with the
[1:22:06] Covenant to stay with the word to pay
[1:22:10] with the promise here is a mammoth of
[1:22:13] fighter but he is turning to an orator
[1:22:15] he's turned into a speaker I mean just
[1:22:21] what 24 the scripture that we read
[1:22:25] just will find themselves speaking to
[1:22:28] everybody he summoned the whole of
[1:22:31] Israel can the church see me Joshua is
[1:22:37] at the end of his Road he knows is over
[1:22:40] since just were 13 the Bible says and
[1:22:44] Justin was all and stricken in age and
[1:22:46] the Lord said you are all in chicadini
[1:22:49] dozen 15 reign chapter 24 and the Bible
[1:22:58] says and just were gathered all the
[1:23:00] tribes of Israel the second and called
[1:23:03] for the elders of Israel and for their
[1:23:07] heads and for their judges and for their
[1:23:10] officers and they presented themselves
[1:23:12] before God just was ministry is over he
[1:23:18] has come to the end of his Road he has
[1:23:21] done the job that God had called him to
[1:23:23] do he has been faithful
[1:23:25] he has took the test of time but there's
[1:23:28] something going on that causes Joshua to
[1:23:31] stop and call an assembly you don't want
[1:23:35] to meet them because you want to call a
[1:23:36] meeting we are here in charge because we
[1:23:39] we steal in to have Church this is an
[1:23:42] assembly has been called by God because
[1:23:45] there's a word that the Lord has for his
[1:23:47] people
[1:23:48] [Applause]
[1:23:52] the book of Joshua is a book of a
[1:23:55] soldier coming into being here with this
[1:23:58] many things have seen Moses in action
[1:24:01] and when Moses died here it was God's
[1:24:04] focus of the Joshua get up Moses my
[1:24:08] servant is dead he gives people over
[1:24:12] meditate on the word their night every
[1:24:15] place you put your foot is yours you do
[1:24:18] nothing you get nothing you step you get
[1:24:22] something what Prince means possession
[1:24:25] and just was stepped up to the plate he
[1:24:29] had no example before him he was the
[1:24:31] first of his kind there was no
[1:24:34] before him like he wants there will be
[1:24:37] none after him that he was the random
[1:24:48] teaches us Joshua parallels Ephesians
[1:24:50] the other that just with a type of
[1:24:53] Christ also did that just was a type of
[1:24:55] the Holy Ghost so then starts for that
[1:24:57] we are speaking about is a powerful text
[1:24:59] that we are in this morning Joshua has
[1:25:07] seen a lot and I can imagine when you
[1:25:09] know you are coming to the end of your
[1:25:11] road because just ways at the end of his
[1:25:15] journey where the Clarence I'm not doubt
[1:25:17] he's anointed he's inspired to bring the
[1:25:20] people together to share with them
[1:25:23] something profound just we're supposed
[1:25:29] to give the last words the last words of
[1:25:32] the great prophet great warrior Joshua
[1:25:38] if you know where the last time you will
[1:25:42] ever speak to a crowd of people what
[1:25:45] would it be it was the last service you
[1:25:48] will ever preach what pets would you
[1:25:51] take what scripture would you read what
[1:25:53] title would you use and this was the
[1:25:56] dilemma that just were found himself in
[1:25:58] and he stood before the entire host of
[1:26:00] Israel he had finished dealing with it
[1:26:04] two and a half tribe yet finished
[1:26:06] speaking to the leaders of Israel but
[1:26:08] now he stood before all the tribes of
[1:26:11] Israel and he had to say something to
[1:26:14] them I can imagine any for us tonight
[1:26:17] Joe I preached about Jericho the victory
[1:26:21] that I had when I was there all alone
[1:26:23] preparing for that clean selling I was
[1:26:25] there meditating sharpening my sword and
[1:26:28] oh I could imagine as as US was too dear
[1:26:32] all these memories are coming back to
[1:26:34] him to share with the peoples and chorus
[1:26:37] of people because he was about to leave
[1:26:39] them
[1:26:42] I can imagine Joshua remember the battle
[1:26:46] that he fought when he had held Moses
[1:26:48] hands up because the Lord pet was Moses
[1:26:52] hands was up he would win the battle and
[1:26:54] Joshua was Moses Minister he was there
[1:26:57] with Aaron given Moses support he have
[1:27:00] seen a lot but what would he share for
[1:27:04] the people at the last words of the
[1:27:08] great warrior Joshua would also remind
[1:27:15] them of when they took out haricots and
[1:27:19] he told them let us leave and don't
[1:27:22] touch anything in Jericho because
[1:27:25] everything in Jericho is cursed and when
[1:27:30] we walked out at Jericho just what
[1:27:33] didn't know that there was one man in
[1:27:35] the camp who had taken gold and taken
[1:27:39] stuff from Jericho and hid it among his
[1:27:41] things when they went to the Battle of
[1:27:44] Eid lost men it still pains us what does
[1:27:49] that be the fact that they lost men
[1:27:51] because the men who died it was not
[1:27:53] their fault it was Ekans force because
[1:27:57] Joseph was very clear do not touch the
[1:28:00] unclean thing so just well had a
[1:28:02] decision to make
[1:28:03] when he comes before the whole horse of
[1:28:06] Israel what what his last words be
[1:28:11] anybody with me this morning so let's
[1:28:15] read a scripture a little bit and just
[1:28:18] what said unto all the people don't say
[1:28:21] it the Lord God of Israel your fathers
[1:28:25] dwelt on the other side of the flood in
[1:28:27] all time even Tara the father of Abraham
[1:28:31] and a part of Nicole and deceived other
[1:28:34] gods but just one now in species on a
[1:28:37] preacher but he goes back to the
[1:28:38] beginning
[1:28:40] and he begins to encourage the people
[1:28:43] and remind them of where they came from
[1:28:46] remind them of what they went through
[1:28:48] remind them of how they were found in
[1:28:51] sin and God took them out of sin remind
[1:28:54] them that they were born left up to
[1:28:56] begin with but if it wasn't with the
[1:28:58] grace of God they wouldn't be standing
[1:29:00] in front of him he reminded them of the
[1:29:04] history verse 3 and I took your father
[1:29:10] Abraham from the other side of the flood
[1:29:14] and let him throw all the land of Canaan
[1:29:17] and multiply his seed and give him Isaac
[1:29:20] in other words Abraham didn't do it on
[1:29:22] his own it was I who gave him Isaac
[1:29:25] Joshua is speaking and he's speaking on
[1:29:28] behalf of his father he said an eye gave
[1:29:30] unto Isaac Jacob and Esau and I gave
[1:29:34] unto Esau mounts here to possess it but
[1:29:37] Jacob and his children went down into
[1:29:40] Egypt
[1:29:40] I send Moses also an errand and I take
[1:29:44] Egypt
[1:29:45] this is Gore taking credit for what he
[1:29:47] did according but that which I did among
[1:29:52] them and after what I brought you out
[1:29:54] did he bring you out did he pick your
[1:29:57] turtle marry clay did he take you out of
[1:30:00] the world did he take you out of sin did
[1:30:03] he find you where you are hiding on the
[1:30:05] other side of the flood because you know
[1:30:08] anything about him he is a fine young he
[1:30:12] called you he predestinated you you may
[1:30:19] be seated listen God is not now saving
[1:30:22] he's not now delivering what God is it's
[1:30:27] already done he has already done it you
[1:30:29] don't get what I'm saying right now but
[1:30:31] the Bible says who he foreknew he calls
[1:30:33] it that call is past tense he is not
[1:30:36] calling who he foreknew he calls who we
[1:30:39] call he hath already justified
[1:30:41] [Applause]
[1:30:44] who is certifying yet already glorified
[1:30:50] that's already passed and that's not to

[1:31:09] perfect in the back path of God mighty
[1:31:13] sees you in power and it's not your
[1:31:20] strength
[1:31:21] it is not by might nor by power but is
[1:31:23] that I have done it I took you out of
[1:31:27] Egypt I delivered you i preserved you I
[1:31:31] woke you up this morning I put food on
[1:31:35] your table it's not your job that put
[1:31:38] food on your table I put food on your
[1:31:40] table your whole company exists because
[1:31:43] I put it there to make sure there's food

[1:31:51] this morning
[1:31:52] [Applause]
[1:31:59] you may be seated
[1:32:01] so trust saw the green warrior he is
[1:32:05] speaking and he is preaching his
[1:32:07] greatness message because it's the last
[1:32:11] words of the great warrior Joshua and he
[1:32:15] said I sent Moses also and Aaron and I
[1:32:19] predict Egypt according to that which I
[1:32:23] did among them and after what I brought
[1:32:25] you out it didn't stop there and I
[1:32:27] brought your father's out of Egypt and
[1:32:30] he came unto the sea so just was going
[1:32:33] through their whole history and the
[1:32:36] Egyptians pursued after your father's
[1:32:38] with chariots and horsemen unto the Red
[1:32:41] Sea and when they cried unto the Lord
[1:32:44] he put darkness between you and the
[1:32:47] Egyptians and brought the sea upon them
[1:32:50] and covered them and your eyes have seen
[1:32:53] what I have done in Egypt anybody with
[1:32:57] me this morning and you dwelt in the
[1:33:00] wilderness a long season but I'm not
[1:33:03] done yet say I brought you into the land
[1:33:06] of the AMA writes which dwelt on the
[1:33:09] other side of Jordan and they fought
[1:33:11] with you and I gave them into your hand
[1:33:14] that you might possess their land
[1:33:17] and I destroyed them from before you so
[1:33:21] when you walk you're doing the fighting
[1:33:23] just to remind you just to bring back to
[1:33:26] your memory I was the one who destroyed
[1:33:29] them from before you when you drew your
[1:33:33] sword I was the one holding is that when
[1:33:36] you raise your shield I was the one
[1:33:38] behind you
[1:33:40] [Applause]
[1:33:53] what a message just was Priscilla just
[1:34:02] was going in anything and then after
[1:34:05] that then balak the son of zippor king
[1:34:09] of moab rules and war against israel and
[1:34:13] sent and called Balaam the son of Beor
[1:34:16] to kiss you but I was not hearken unto
[1:34:19] balaam Oh
[1:34:20] therefore he blessed you still so when
[1:34:23] he was trying to curse you the curse
[1:34:25] became a blessing so I delivered you out
[1:34:28] of his hand and just was that done it
[1:34:34] and he said and he went over Jordan and
[1:34:36] came out at Eriko and the men of Jericho
[1:34:39] fought against you
[1:34:40] the amorite and the parasites and the
[1:34:44] Canaanite and the headlights and the
[1:34:46] girgashites the hivite and the jebusite
[1:34:49] and I deliver them into your hand
[1:34:51] and I send the Hornet before you let's
[1:34:55] drag them out from before you even the
[1:34:58] two kings of the amorite but not with
[1:35:01] dice order nor with typos and I given

[1:35:38] he is the way makeup he is the restorer
[1:35:41] he is the deliverer he is the one who

[1:36:15] today me yesterday he is the world he is
[1:36:18] there he is mechanic he is dynamic and
[1:36:22] it has been him all along leading us
[1:36:29] you could not be here this morning
[1:36:31] unless he called you unless he picked
[1:36:35] you unless he chose you
[1:36:37] that's only review kapinas house this
[1:36:40] morning you could not save yourself you
[1:36:43] couldn't wake up yourself you can heal
[1:36:46] yourself
[1:36:47] [Applause]
[1:36:58] you may be seated now this is where
[1:37:26] Joshua gets down to the main part of his
[1:37:30] message everything he said thus far was
[1:37:34] laying a foundation it spoke of where
[1:37:37] they had come from it spoke of God
[1:37:39] taking him out
[1:37:40] God fighting for them what court had
[1:37:43] done for them but no he's a boat to
[1:37:46] deliver the most important part of his
[1:37:48] message he was bringing it personal to
[1:37:51] the individual now and he was now
[1:37:54] switching from what God has done what
[1:37:58] God is doing to the individual listen
[1:38:01] carefully now therefore and this is a
[1:38:05] ship that I read fear the Lord and the
[1:38:09] Bible tells us that the fear of the Lord
[1:38:11] is the beginning of wisdom it's a scary
[1:38:17] thing when people don't fear the Lord
[1:38:25] people walk into the church anyway they
[1:38:29] want to walk through life any way they
[1:38:32] want to without even an acknowledgment
[1:38:35] of God far less for a fear of God so
[1:38:41] just was now delivering the most
[1:38:43] important part of his message and I want
[1:38:46] everybody to get this now now therefore
[1:38:49] fear the Lord and serve Him in sincerity
[1:38:51] and in truth and put away the gods now
[1:38:56] the fact that Joshua has to be saying
[1:38:59] this meant there was an issue in the
[1:39:02] campus
[1:39:03] that he was trying to address put away
[1:39:06] the gods with your father spilled on the
[1:39:09] other side of the flood and in Egypt and
[1:39:13] Sylvie the Lord now verse 15 a lot of
[1:39:18] people read the scripture incorrectly
[1:39:23] listen carefully to what justice is and
[1:39:27] if it seems evil to you young people
[1:39:33] mother father message believer if it
[1:39:38] seem evil to you to serve the Lord if
[1:39:41] you have a problem to serve the Lord if
[1:39:44] you take offense when we tell you to
[1:39:46] serve the Lord he gives them a choice
[1:39:49] and the choice contrary to popular
[1:39:54] belief in this verse is not a choice
[1:39:56] between God and the devil listen to the
[1:40:00] choice that gives and if it seem evil
[1:40:04] unto you to serve the Lord choose ye
[1:40:07] this day whom you will serve whether the
[1:40:11] gods which your father's served that
[1:40:15] were on the other side of the flood or
[1:40:17] the gods of the amorite in whose land
[1:40:22] eat well and then Joshua put his
[1:40:25] testimony on this but as for me and my
[1:40:28] house we will serve the Lord
[1:40:34] I want you to listen carefully Church
[1:40:40] because this is where many of us mr.
[1:40:43] mark just why synonym if you have a
[1:40:46] problem with serving God these are your
[1:40:50] two choices either you serve the God of
[1:40:53] your past or you serve the God of the
[1:40:56] present so Joshua was drilling down into
[1:41:11] what I call the real issue because if
[1:41:16] you say you don't serve the gods of your
[1:41:19] past but you don't want to serve the god
[1:41:23] the king of kings and Lord of lords then
[1:41:25] there's another option there's another
[1:41:29] God to serve the god of the land in
[1:41:32] which you live you left Egypt but you in
[1:41:38] the land of the amorite it's a
[1:41:40] battleground it's a fight and there
[1:41:43] people who say when I left the world I
[1:41:45] don't smoke I don't drink I don't go to
[1:41:47] parties but they have new gods the god
[1:41:52] of the amorite the god of the land in
[1:41:56] which they live now so they feel
[1:41:58] comfortable seeing I'm in the tribe of
[1:42:02] Israel I'm not in Egypt we cross Jordan
[1:42:06] we cross we came over the Red Sea we're
[1:42:10] in the land but they have not served the
[1:42:16] true God
[1:42:18] so just what in his last words were
[1:42:21] saying friends make up your mind because
[1:42:28] the devil has traps and lead for you and
[1:42:30] many of you are falling into the traps
[1:42:33] that's why we're having this service
[1:42:36] that's why we have in this message this
[1:42:39] morning because I don't want you feel
[1:42:42] like you're right because you're not in
[1:42:43] Egypt when there are new gods that you
[1:42:46] are
[1:42:47] but the Brennan 20 to make anything of
[1:42:49] God and the true an appeaser will not in
[1:42:52] Egypt but they have found new gods in
[1:42:55] the land of the amorite what God are you
[1:43:02] worshiping but the Branham speaks of a
[1:43:05] man was beating up preachers I'll give
[1:43:06] you an example and everywhere he went he
[1:43:09] was beating up peaches and when they
[1:43:12] found themselves in the place where the
[1:43:13] Prophet wizard was and the Prophet was
[1:43:15] on the platform as it were and when they
[1:43:18] saw the man coming all the ministers
[1:43:20] left and left the puppet standing by
[1:43:22] himself and as that man was coming
[1:43:25] saying whatever you were saying coming
[1:43:27] to the Prophet the Prophet said you will
[1:43:30] fall out over my feet you remember then
[1:43:32] I went a man fell over the prophets feet
[1:43:37] the police came and they asked the
[1:43:41] Prophet will this man be all right but
[1:43:45] the madam said no he will not why
[1:43:47] because he worships the spirit that is
[1:43:52] upon him and there are many people who
[1:43:56] have left the visible Egypt as it were
[1:44:01] but in sip in church and they worship
[1:44:04] the God of the ammonites the spirits
[1:44:08] they worshipped social media because
[1:44:13] whatever you spend your time is is what
[1:44:17] your God is sort of the choose you this
[1:44:20] day whom you will serve
[1:44:24] who you will serve who you will spend
[1:44:27] time worshiping what you will spend time
[1:44:30] doing choose you this day the God that
[1:44:35] you will worship because two three hours
[1:44:38] or four hours and a Sunday is a small
[1:44:41] fraction of your time you claim to be
[1:44:44] out of Egypt what are you doing on a
[1:44:47] Monday you claim to be out of Egypt but
[1:44:51] what are you doing on a Tuesday you told
[1:44:53] me you loved Egypt but what are you
[1:44:56] doing on a Wednesday
[1:44:58] choose you this day whom you will serve
[1:45:01] do you want to go back to the gods of
[1:45:03] Egypt do you want to serve these clothes
[1:45:06] of the other eyes but as for me and my
[1:45:08] house we will serve the Lord I want to
[1:45:19] go on in the scripture because Russia
[1:45:21] was probing at the people so the 16th
[1:45:25] said and the people answered and said
[1:45:27] god forbid that we should forsake the
[1:45:29] law to serve other gods so I'm just like
[1:45:33] what is one of the most God forbid we
[1:45:34] will not do that and then give the
[1:45:39] reason why in verse 17 for the Lord our
[1:45:41] good he it is that brought us up and our
[1:45:44] fathers out of the land of Egypt from
[1:45:47] the house of bondage and with did these
[1:45:49] great signs and our sight and preserved
[1:45:52] us in all the way when we went and among
[1:45:55] all the people through whom we have
[1:45:56] passed and the Lord's reward from before
[1:45:59] all the people this is the people
[1:46:01] talking now from even the amorite which
[1:46:04] dwell in the land therefore will we also
[1:46:07] serve the Lord for he is our God listen
[1:46:11] the trust was response and just was said
[1:46:14] unto the people he cannot serve the Lord
[1:46:17] for he is a holy God he's a jealous God
[1:46:22] he will not forgive your transgressions
[1:46:25] nor your sins if he for seek the Lord
[1:46:30] and serve strange Goods then he will
[1:46:33] turn and do you hurt and consume you
[1:46:35] after that he had done you good and the
[1:46:39] people senator doesn't name but we will
[1:46:41] serve the Lord
[1:46:42] in other words Joshua wanted to make
[1:46:45] sure that the people really was serious
[1:46:47] about this thing and he said God is a
[1:46:52] jealous good he's a holy God he doesn't
[1:46:56] want to be shared with anybody else he
[1:46:58] is supposed to be number one at all
[1:47:00] times he doesn't want to be a part time
[1:47:02] got to you he wants to be God all the
[1:47:05] time
[1:47:05] somebody shame
[1:47:07] [Applause]
[1:47:10] and just what some of the people here
[1:47:13] witnesses against yourselves that you
[1:47:16] have chosen the Lord to suited and they
[1:47:18] said we are witnesses
[1:47:20] now therefore put away instead heat
[1:47:23] estranged goods which are among you and
[1:47:25] incline your heart unto the Lord God of
[1:47:29] Israel and the people said of the judge
[1:47:31] with a Lord our God will receive and his
[1:47:34] voice will we o be so it sorts for made
[1:47:37] a covenant with the peoples that be and
[1:47:39] said them a statute and an ordinance in
[1:47:42] Shechem and just we'll wrote these words
[1:47:44] in the book of the law and God took a
[1:47:48] great stone and set it up there under an
[1:47:51] oak that was by the sanctuary of the
[1:47:53] Lord and just what said unto all the
[1:47:56] people behold this stone shall be a
[1:47:58] witness unto us for it has heard all the
[1:48:02] words of the Lord which he spake unto us
[1:48:04] it shall be there for a witness unto you
[1:48:07] lest he deny your God so just well let
[1:48:10] the people depart every man unto his
[1:48:13] inheritance and they came to pass after
[1:48:16] these things that just were the son of
[1:48:18] nun the cylinder the Lord died being a
[1:48:21] hundred and ten years old the last words
[1:48:25] of the great warrior Joshua friends many
[1:48:34] of us we make excuses we make excuses
[1:48:40] for why we act the way we act we make
[1:48:43] excuses for why we can live up to
[1:48:45] certain expectations we make excuses for
[1:48:49] why we don't have time to pray why we
[1:48:52] didn't come to service why we spoke that
[1:48:54] way to somebody else you make excuses
[1:48:56] all of these things and many times we
[1:49:00] speak and the brother branham's talk
[1:49:02] about what the Holy Ghost is given for
[1:49:03] how it comes to change your speech and
[1:49:06] change your walk and change your talk
[1:49:08] and change your behavior and that is
[1:49:10] true
[1:49:11] no question about it but for many of the
[1:49:16] things that we go through it comes down
[1:49:18] to making a decision
[1:49:21] in other words with all the only goals
[1:49:24] there's some decisions that you have the
[1:49:25] power to make you don't need to have the
[1:49:33] Holy Ghost to tell the devil no you
[1:49:35] don't want to smoke the only ghost gives
[1:49:38] you power but you have the ability to
[1:49:40] choose because every day we make
[1:49:42] decisions and our life is the total of
[1:49:45] the decision that we make so Joshua
[1:49:49] standing in front of the people on scene
[1:49:51] today choose who you will serve make a
[1:49:54] choice do you really want to be a
[1:49:57] Christian do you really want to serve
[1:50:00] God do you really want to have a
[1:50:02] testimony or do you want to go to the
[1:50:04] world don't win tomorrow today choose
[1:50:08] the day whom you will serve
[1:50:11] the problem is many of us we have not
[1:50:14] made a firm decision knowing something
[1:50:19] is right it's not a decision to do what
[1:50:21] is right there are many people with high
[1:50:25] blood pressure who know they're not
[1:50:26] supposed to eat salt in or not was it
[1:50:28] salt but I'll tell you this you mean to
[1:50:33] tell me you need to get some anointing
[1:50:35] to not eat sauce
[1:50:41] so I'm going to pray for you to tell you
[1:50:44] what is a soul spirit it's down to
[1:50:55] decisions and that's really what this
[1:50:58] message is about this morning being in
[1:51:00] the valley of decision all about this
[1:51:02] morning we are at a crossroads just what
[1:51:06] had brought the true level to a
[1:51:08] crossroads in the ending of his ministry
[1:51:10] you have to make a choice and it has to
[1:51:14] be your choice to be a Christian and to
[1:51:17] serve God God is not deciding for you
[1:51:22] he's not choosing for you you have to
[1:51:25] make a choice a choice to stand a choice
[1:51:30] to pray a trying to forgive a trifle of
[1:51:33] a choice to worship a choice a choice to
[1:51:39] listen to only music but it through and
[1:51:42] out of your music collection a choice to
[1:51:46] read the Bible or to read books that
[1:51:48] will take you away from God friends
[1:51:50] there are only two influences and the
[1:51:54] eject that influences you have a choice
[1:51:57] with which influence you will listen to
[1:52:01] somebody helped me this morning choose
[1:52:06] you this day whom you will serve
[1:52:09] there are people sitting in the message
[1:52:12] that have not made a choice to serve the
[1:52:15] Lord the novices right and notice is the
[1:52:19] truth but what is it choice that you
[1:52:22] have it because go to all the profit
[1:52:24] because thou has chosen it's the hard
[1:52:29] way
[1:52:30] it's a tough away a huge portion of
[1:52:35] heaven who waits you young people you
[1:52:40] have to make the choice your father
[1:52:42] cannot make the choice the path that can
[1:52:44] make you even Jesus how to labor and get
[1:52:48] some money and he had a choice to make
[1:52:50] and he was praying he was in agony
[1:52:54] is their father if it is possible let
[1:52:57] this cup pass he had a choice you had a
[1:53:00] choice this morning whether you will
[1:53:03] come to church or stay home you have a
[1:53:05] choice tomorrow whether you're about to
[1:53:07] work or not you have a choice if you
[1:53:09] will pray before you go to work you are
[1:53:11] a choice if you will read the Bible if
[1:53:13] before you go to work that's your choice
[1:53:16] if it is important to you you will make
[1:53:19] the correct choice but how important is
[1:53:21] this kingdom of God to you you have to
[1:53:26] choose today not tomorrow tomorrow will
[1:53:28] be too late
[1:53:29] choose the day whom you will serve you
[1:53:33] have to choose to clean your life out
[1:53:37] absolutely and turn those Falls goes out
[1:53:41] throw them out of your house
[1:53:44] turn them out of your life that's the
[1:53:48] choice you have to make it just reminded
[1:53:52] them of what God had done but they still
[1:53:54] had to make the choice
[1:53:55] why are you until it's on you heavy
[1:54:01] can't worship no joy you know why you
[1:54:07] made choices that attacked your joy you
[1:54:13] made choices that attacked your victory
[1:54:16] when if you make the correct choices the
[1:54:19] devil could have no grip on you has no
[1:54:22] power over you have no hole on you
[1:54:25] because it devil could never reach you
[1:54:27] once you are under the blood once you
[1:54:29] repent on you under the blood the devil
[1:54:31] cannot get through the blood but the
[1:54:33] brand impressed for him to get under the
[1:54:35] blood is the confessed he needs to be
[1:54:37] like you and get anger he can do it so
[1:54:40] what devil you talking about we need to
[1:54:45] accept responsibility for our choices
[1:54:48] the devil cannot break down your door
[1:54:53] even he said behold I am in a door knock
[1:54:57] you have a choice to open the door
[1:54:59] [Applause]
[1:55:01] behold I stand at the door I'm not going
[1:55:03] if any man here nope now come in and sup
[1:55:06] with him Jesus not breaking down the
[1:55:09] door of your heart breaking down the
[1:55:12] door of your life I'm gonna force you to
[1:55:14] do anything you have to choose because
[1:55:23] one day the Bible said he who is filthy
[1:55:26] be filthy still he was righteous
[1:55:30] righteous still that righteousness of
[1:55:34] filthiness is not God
[1:55:36] senioritis your filthy that's decisions
[1:55:40] that decisions so this service is not
[1:55:44] about your children then about your wife
[1:55:47] your husband not about your boss or your
[1:55:49] neighbor is that what you choose them to
[1:55:51] be a Christian Susan to dress like a
[1:55:55] Christian choose it to speak like a
[1:55:58] Christian choosing have a testimony like
[1:56:01] a Christian choose you this day whom you
[1:56:08] will serve
[1:56:08] do you want to go back into the past or
[1:56:11] you want to just dwell where you at now
[1:56:13] in the land of the MRIs or do you want
[1:56:15] to serve the one and true Living God the
[1:56:22] average person today spends so much time
[1:56:25] on their cell phone the cell phone has
[1:56:28] become a good it doesn't sound like the
[1:56:32] most spiritual thing but it is the truth
[1:56:35] because when you have to give an account
[1:56:37] of a versus the bible Spotswood
[1:56:41] redeeming the time anybody know that
[1:56:43] scripture time is just going in and
[1:56:46] you're not doing anything for the
[1:56:47] kingdom no choice to testify no choice
[1:56:53] the to spread the gospel do you know
[1:56:58] you're forgiven account for how you
[1:57:00] spend every minute of your life from the
[1:57:05] moment you wake up in the morning the
[1:57:07] recording is going on of your life what
[1:57:10] is your excuse what is your story
[1:57:13] and this is what trust was plannin dear
[1:57:15] God already took you out of the world he
[1:57:18] made a way for you you have to make a
[1:57:25] choice I know it's not the kind of
[1:57:29] method people love to hear but I know
[1:57:32] what's on my heart because your choice
[1:57:36] will reflect itself in your testimony
[1:57:39] your choices will reflect itself in how
[1:57:44] you smile your choices at the student
[1:57:47] you ever tries to study you have a
[1:57:51] choice I cannot understand how people go
[1:57:55] to school for five years and leave with
[1:57:56] nothing
[1:58:00] five years that's a choice a choice was
[1:58:07] made is to have fun and I study a choice
[1:58:10] was made to go with friends and not
[1:58:12] study a choice was made to break school
[1:58:15] and not study a choice was made to do
[1:58:18] all kinds of stuff except what was most
[1:58:20] important how many of us are guilty this
[1:58:23] morning of making choices that against
[1:58:26] our progress spiritually it's a choice
[1:58:32] an evening to put on a movie or to put
[1:58:36] on a team it's a choice to pick up a
[1:58:39] Bible or to pick up a newspaper
[1:58:45] but the problem is there's no say of the
[1:58:47] Lord because if people come back to fear
[1:58:51] in God then every decision would be
[1:58:54] weighed how will God
[1:58:56] see this what does God think about this
[1:59:01] how will God feel about where I'm going
[1:59:05] this morning but people have lost a fear
[1:59:09] of God so they walk wherever they want
[1:59:12] to walk they go every want to go to eat
[1:59:15] whatever I want to eat it drink whatever
[1:59:18] they want to drink because they still
[1:59:19] say of God husband speak to wives
[1:59:22] however you want to because there is no
[1:59:25] fear of God why we sponsor husbands
[1:59:28] anywhere you want to because there's no
[1:59:30] fear of God children ain't about the
[1:59:34] parents anywhere they want to because
[1:59:36] there's no fear of God the interest and
[1:59:39] the father the mother the child issue is
[1:59:42] about God I am the Lord I change not and
[1:59:46] I'm a jealous good I don't want no other
[1:59:49] copy for me
[1:59:50] don't shall have no other gods before me
[1:59:57] if God is going to serve Him serve him
[2:00:02] on a Monday serve him on a Tuesday serve
[2:00:05] him on a Wednesday serve him on a
[2:00:07] Thursday serve him on a Friday silverman
[2:00:11] and Saturday sell him on your job sell
[2:00:13] them in your neighborhood sell them in
[2:00:15] your house sell them when you go down
[2:00:17] the street serving when you're driving
[2:00:19] sell them when you're in the maxi summer
[2:00:22] when people make jokes filthy jokes love
[2:00:26] him by walking away that's how you serve
[2:00:30] Him don't you know your party's at a
[2:00:32] temple of the Holy Ghost
[2:00:34] [Applause]
[2:00:39] choose you this day whom you will serve
[2:00:44] I challenge you to they don't leave this
[2:00:48] house without making a real choice
[2:00:51] friends young people your parents have
[2:00:54] to answer as much as you have to answer
[2:00:59] it's a tragedy
[2:01:00] when young people think that's not
[2:01:03] coming to church it's written their
[2:01:05] parents what foolishness is the same
[2:01:11] like a transient I not study enough
[2:01:12] because my parents want me to do well
[2:01:14] and I just want the Isaacs with them is
[2:01:16] I not studying does that make sense
[2:01:21] choice it's a choice to fight or a
[2:01:26] choice is to walk away the choice they
[2:01:30] hit for choice is to love it's your
[2:01:33] choice you need to have somebody lay
[2:01:36] hands on you you need to make the right
[2:01:39] choices your blessing is a result of
[2:01:43] your choice kings wash when he likes a
[2:01:48] tool him hit the ground it was his
[2:01:49] choice the Prophet never told him hit
[2:01:52] five is six he left it up to him it was
[2:01:56] his choice and he did it three times and
[2:01:58] he likes heard I'm angry you should have
[2:02:02] done it five or six times because if
[2:02:04] there if I was six time you would have
[2:02:05] destroyed the enemy but because the only
[2:02:08] hit three times you will have three
[2:02:09] victories why can't we make a choice to
[2:02:13] do extra why can't you make a choice to
[2:02:17] do more for the kingdom when can you
[2:02:19] make a choice to pray longer why don't
[2:02:22] we catch oi Cecile or my brothers in
[2:02:24] trouble Lord touch him help him that's a
[2:02:27] choice that we make instead of
[2:02:29] criticizing and watching I don't know
[2:02:30] what he doing I don't know what she
[2:02:32] doing make a choice to catch a burden
[2:02:35] for your brother capture prayer and for
[2:02:38] your sister you don't know what they are
[2:02:39] going through
[2:02:44] there is no excuse it's a choice it's a
[2:02:50] good morning as a pass somebody street
[2:02:53] it's an embarrassment it's an
[2:02:57] embarrassment when brothers can't greet
[2:02:59] brothers sisters can greet sisters when
[2:03:01] the property I respect the garbageman I
[2:03:04] respect everybody and believers make a
[2:03:08] choice to hold stuff against you and not
[2:03:12] greet you because you believe something
[2:03:13] different
[2:03:14] that's the choice go and help us this
[2:03:22] morning I'm not going to be too long

[2:05:14] young sisters you have a choice to wear
[2:05:18] your clothes height height height or the
[2:05:20] just wanna Spencer your choice every
[2:05:27] action you take you have an opportunity
[2:05:29] you know what the balance said there's a
[2:05:30] conscience that speaks to you and
[2:05:33] believe Adam said as you're going
[2:05:35] through life the voice says you don't do
[2:05:38] this every time you ignore the voice it
[2:05:42] gets quieter until you become you lose
[2:05:46] the sensitivity you become numb to the
[2:05:50] voice and right now there's a voice
[2:05:53] speaking to every heart in here right
[2:05:55] now because you know how you live you
[2:06:00] know the choices you make and there's a
[2:06:02] voice whispering you need to change that
[2:06:03] if you can fix that I don't they come
[2:06:05] and tell you in the video what it is you
[2:06:06] know what we to fix friends listen to
[2:06:09] that voice just wouldn't speak to
[2:06:12] individuals you through this get rid of
[2:06:14] that that that he spoke to the entire
[2:06:16] group and he said you get rid of you of
[2:06:19] Osgood's get rid of what you spend time
[2:06:22] doing that doesn't bring you closer to
[2:06:25] the kingdom of God you have to do it you
[2:06:30] must do it
[2:06:31] it's life or death it's life or death
[2:06:42] these services will not exist all the
[2:06:44] time it's alright to jump and shout and
[2:06:47] people have all kind of great revelation
[2:06:49] and mystery and annoying tynin and then
[2:06:53] by Tuesday Wednesday your willpower is
[2:06:59] under pressure because your Norrington
[2:07:02] has worn off from Sunday and now you are
[2:07:05] faced with a choice we go in after work
[2:07:08] they just hang out nothing we're not
[2:07:10] doing anything with one hang out and you
[2:07:13] have to ask yourself the question what's
[2:07:14] the influence because there are only two
[2:07:19] influences so we're going to make it
[2:07:21] simple because a lot of people hear
[2:07:23] stuff and it wasn't only how so this one
[2:07:25] I want to give you the whole ask
[2:07:27] yourself what the influence who is
[2:07:33] influencing the action what the
[2:07:36] objectives of the action what usually
[2:07:39] happens when people go to places it says
[2:07:42] us were claim is it doesn't work if
[2:07:45] there is nothing we're going to have it
[2:07:46] it's just we just talking about sports
[2:07:50] the question is is that gonna take it
[2:07:53] closer to the kingdom or away from the
[2:07:54] kingdom and it's any path any chance but
[2:07:58] the Branum said if shunned a theory
[2:08:00] appearance you don't even have to be
[2:08:03] evil and give it up here evil walk away
[2:08:05] from it
[2:08:10] this very appearance if it might be able
[2:08:14] see away from it you have a choice with
[2:08:18] the what you weigh what you watch do you
[2:08:22] know the eyes is the key to the soul
[2:08:24] I was sharing but over this these demons
[2:08:29] in Hollywood have gone so far that it
[2:08:33] now is a TV show called Lucifer and by
[2:08:37] the Branum said that when the plagues
[2:08:39] come the plagues would be torments that
[2:08:42] are connected to what people would have
[2:08:44] watched in TV shows and Hollywood has
[2:08:48] had a concerted effort to desensitize
[2:08:50] people to the spirit realm
[2:08:51] so there is a comfortable comfortable to
[2:08:56] accept these evil devil programs until
[2:09:00] it doesn't bother you anymore
[2:09:02] setting people up for the judgments
[2:09:06] setting people are / torment and you
[2:09:09] want to walk around understanding that
[2:09:10] his spirits that are at work and you
[2:09:13] want to open yourself up to the music to
[2:09:17] the styles to the fashion not even
[2:09:20] knowing what caused the style what demon
[2:09:23] was upon somebody you have a choice son
[2:09:27] the very appearance of evil why would a
[2:09:32] Christian listen to music like that
[2:09:34] where you whatever whirly hairstyle why
[2:09:39] do you want to have a worldly boyfriend
[2:09:41] will he go for why
[2:09:48] you know what the Prophet said under no
[2:09:51] circumstances should I believe I marry
[2:09:54] an unbeliever I'm not no circumstances I
[2:10:01] don't care what it is so people do that
[2:10:04] it's their choice to make
[2:10:07] listen you can't blame anybody
[2:10:10] you can't even blame people for not
[2:10:13] knowing the wood because you could read

[2:14:38] or people talking is it the way but it's
[2:14:42] a choice it doesn't matter when you read
[2:14:46] stories of success and people who made
[2:14:48] it people went to all kind of and put
[2:14:50] there people who study with candlelight
[2:14:52] and got scholarships without electricity
[2:14:55] by candlelight because they made a
[2:14:57] decision they made a choice that it did
[2:15:00] not want to live the way they grew up
[2:15:02] and the Berenstain time and Chavez give
[2:15:07] it to every man you ever try 15 but what
[2:15:11] happens this week and what happens
[2:15:13] tomorrow at any point in time you can be
[2:15:19] like the prodigal son he made a choice
[2:15:20] is it wait a minute
[2:15:21] even the servants in my father's house
[2:15:24] even better than this I am making a
[2:15:28] choice
[2:15:28] I will arise I will go to my father and
[2:15:33] say I have sinned but you know what
[2:15:36] before that the Bible said when he came
[2:15:38] their senses
[2:15:39] another problem in many ways we have yet
[2:15:42] to come to our senses so I pray that
[2:15:46] this morning we come to our senses to
[2:15:49] realize that this pigsty that we might
[2:15:52] be living in it's not the mansion that
[2:15:54] our Father has and there's food that's
[2:15:57] stored for us that the craft that has
[2:15:59] been growing for many many years that is
[2:16:01] waiting to be killed for when we come
[2:16:03] back home there's a robe with our name
[2:16:06] written on it there's a ring of power a
[2:16:09] sign of adoption as we develop if you
[2:16:12] could just come to our senses and make a
[2:16:14] choice I will arise and go back to my
[2:16:17] son and say Lord I'm I'm coming home I'm
[2:16:22] coming to my senses I'm coming to a
[2:16:25] realization that I have the power to
[2:16:28] make a choice the Holy Ghost comes to
[2:16:31] take you further the Holy Ghost comes to
[2:16:33] lead you into all truth the Holy Ghost
[2:16:36] comma number the brand said after you
[2:16:37] receive the world goes you make yourself
[2:16:39] a question so there's still more choices
[2:16:42] after that because every journey for the
[2:16:44] pranam a prophet had a choice there were
[2:16:48] two people in the church making of and
[2:16:51] God said whatever you see what happened
[2:16:53] he had a choice maybe say blindly
[2:16:57] applying him dead they are dead and he
[2:17:00] said I forgive you he had a choice you
[2:17:05] have a choice when there's our author
[2:17:07] calls to come up you have a choice when
[2:17:09] there's stuff in your life that you feel
[2:17:11] is overwhelming
[2:17:12] to bring it to the ministry or you can
[2:17:14] keep it to yourself what's the sense
[2:17:16] there's a doctor to go to and you don't
[2:17:19] want to go to the doctor you have a
[2:17:21] choice there people who sit home sick
[2:17:23] you don't want to go end up there that's
[2:17:24] a choice we have choices this morning
[2:17:28] the choice when a song leader and
[2:17:30] singing to free to enter in and sing and
[2:17:33] if nobody is next to you that your
[2:17:35] choice or you make a choice under it's
[2:17:40] your choice you can make a choice when I
[2:17:44] say with us over to Terry and the Lord
[2:17:46] I'm not leaving here like that man who
[2:17:47] said in the time of the prophets Lord if
[2:17:49] you come back here you
[2:17:52] I find my bones right here because I'm
[2:17:54] not leaving here until I get the Holy
[2:17:56] Ghost that's a choice the musician can
[2:18:00] get ready choose you this day whom you
[2:18:09] will serve
[2:18:10] I pray that in some way this has stirred
[2:18:14] your heart that you can blame the pasta
[2:18:18] the elder Deacon your mother your father
[2:18:20] the church didn't use the government the
[2:18:23] school system that you have a choice you
[2:18:27] have a choice in the spiritual evil
[2:18:29] choice in the natural your choice to
[2:18:31] have a testimony you have a choice with
[2:18:33] what you put on Facebook you have a
[2:18:37] choice for what type of selfie you take
[2:18:40] you have a choice with how you reflect
[2:18:43] this name because but the pranam said we
[2:18:45] ought to be God's advertisement board
[2:18:47] now God is looking for somebody
[2:18:50] the sake is his glory and he has no
[2:18:54] hands but your hands
[2:18:55] he has no feet but your feet he said it
[2:18:58] was somebody look at this pray that God
[2:19:01] is still real he's the same yesterday
[2:19:04] today and forever

[2:19:07] child you can still worship that's how
[2:19:10] you are good advertisement boy the Lord
[2:19:14] gives the Lord taketh away blessed be
[2:19:16] the name of the Lord
[2:19:17] that's cause advertisement for
[2:19:20] [Applause]
[2:19:22] choose you this day whom you will serve
[2:19:27] friends we need to make the business of
[2:19:31] the kingdom the most important thing in
[2:19:34] our lives to many of us we are choosing
[2:19:37] the world we are choosing our ideas we
[2:19:40] are choosing our ambitions we're
[2:19:41] choosing our family we are choosing what
[2:19:43] we want to do and God is saying I'm a
[2:19:46] jealous good when will you choose me the
[2:19:51] Bible says seek ye first the kingdom of
[2:19:53] God and His righteousness and all other
[2:19:57] things will be added unto you
[2:20:00] can we put him first can we choose to
[2:20:04] put emphasis
[2:20:05] can we choose to put the words verse the
[2:20:08] word above church the word above group
[2:20:11] the word above your family that's the
[2:20:15] choice that we must make your choices
[2:20:22] you could choose to live
[2:20:26] but the Branham I believe give the story
[2:20:28] of the man who was imprisoned and I
[2:20:34] believe it's General or the president as
[2:20:35] it were was under battlefield and he
[2:20:39] couldn't get to the presidential office
[2:20:41] to put your official seal and the
[2:20:44] official left ahead and everything but
[2:20:47] he wrote when he heard about the man
[2:20:49] you're pardoned and he sent a messenger
[2:20:54] with the friend or whatever to the manor
[2:20:57] with a prison did send a message to him
[2:21:00] and when he brought that paper that a
[2:21:02] man who was in prison he looked at it to
[2:21:04] say I don't think this is justice from
[2:21:07] the president see but it's a plan and
[2:21:11] you can come out of prison he made a
[2:21:18] choice
[2:21:21] when it went to the court to review tea
[2:21:23] they said a pardon is not a pardon
[2:21:27] unless it's accepted and to accept
[2:21:31] anything it's a choice to accept or
[2:21:35] reject that man in his condition based
[2:21:39] on his own perspective of how he thought
[2:21:41] help would come how he thought his
[2:21:44] deliverance would come he rejected it
[2:21:46] it didn't come the way he thought it was
[2:21:48] it wasn't the kind of service he came
[2:21:50] for that day so he said you know what
[2:21:52] that I'll stay in prison and he missed
[2:21:56] his opportunity for pardon he missed his
[2:21:59] opportunity for redemption he misses
[2:22:01] opportunity for healing you mrs.
[2:22:02] opportunity to step out of the prison
[2:22:04] and be a free man friends don't make
[2:22:09] that mistake you have a choice if you
[2:22:13] don't have the Holy Ghost loafer choice
[2:22:15] to make that your prayer Mick is it Lord
[2:22:18] I need the Holy Ghost that's your choice
[2:22:22] you have a choice with what you asked
[2:22:24] for
[2:22:25] but the Branham was speaking about what
[2:22:27] happened to squirrel then he's sharing
[2:22:29] it and since the heart you're right is a
[2:22:32] witness of the conversation she says
[2:22:35] that's nothing but the truth
[2:22:36] I'm gonna Brennan turns to her he
[2:22:39] doesn't just give her somebody say
[2:22:40] you're the choice what what do you want
[2:22:43] you want money you want to be healed and
[2:22:47] she made her choice she said I want the
[2:22:50] salvation of my two boys
[2:22:53] throughout every step of your Christian
[2:22:56] journey you will be confronted with
[2:22:58] choices and decisions and the measure of
[2:23:01] a man or woman is those choices and
[2:23:04] decisions that you make some will be
[2:23:06] good some will be bad because we are not
[2:23:09] yet perfect profession as promised but
[2:23:12] as you walk along the journey we try our
[2:23:14] very best to make the best decisions
[2:23:17] that will bring us closer to him because
[2:23:22] that's the girl friends to be closer to
[2:23:24] him until one day we look in the mirror
[2:23:26] and we don't see ourselves but we see
[2:23:29] Jesus and he can say who are you you are
[2:23:32] born of my bone you are flesh of my
[2:23:35] flesh you are spirit of my skirt running
[2:23:39] upon line precept upon precept because
[2:23:41] you have been formed into the wood image
[2:23:43] and your character has been formed I
[2:23:47] said some time ago about that Jesus
[2:23:50] learned obedience it was not a gift to
[2:23:54] him he learned obedience by the thing
[2:23:56] that he suffered the Bible doesn't tell
[2:23:58] us what he suffered but he must have
[2:24:01] suffered a lot just learned obedience
[2:24:05] friends it's your choice with how much
[2:24:08] you must suffer to learn obedience or
[2:24:12] you can choose the Lord I'm ready today
[2:24:16] to come home I'm ready to leave a
[2:24:19] worldly high number to leave church
[2:24:21] behind leave my ideas behind and say
[2:24:25] Lord as Jesus I don't get some did not
[2:24:27] my will but thine be done
[2:24:30] I choose you I choose life and for me
[2:24:33] and my house we will serve the Lord when

[2:25:10] of what to do and examples of what not

[2:25:17] individuals who have gone before us who
[2:25:20] God allow the past that way so we could
[2:25:23] learn and testimonies of victory
