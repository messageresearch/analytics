[1:18:04] 2019 hallelujah let's talk about that
[1:18:08] because it seems like the world has
[1:18:10] forgotten about that seemed like America
[1:18:14] kicked God out of their hands
[1:18:17] and of the schools and of the nation
[1:18:20] almost all together it seemed like they
[1:18:23] kick him out of everywhere that's a
[1:18:25] prophecy because he'd be standing on the
[1:18:27] door knocking say let me in and I'll
[1:18:30] come in and stop with you and manifest
[1:18:33] myself to you he's telling on the
[1:18:34] outside knocking this morning looking
[1:18:38] for hearts looking for souls looking for
[1:18:42] willing servants looking for a willing
[1:18:46] host it's not because as the Prophet
[1:18:51] taught us a spirit is useless unless it
[1:18:54] has a body to be to use any search
[1:18:57] whether it's a foul spirit whatever
[1:19:00] spirit from God it is useless this
[1:19:02] morning unless it has someone that it
[1:19:05] can use to fulfill its purpose to do its
[1:19:08] bidding here on earth oh and this
[1:19:12] morning we want to be willing servants
[1:19:15] willing servants to be used of God the
[1:19:19] devil has found a way through technology
[1:19:22] and through the media and to television
[1:19:25] and to music to influence the minds of
[1:19:28] young people to make them willing host
[1:19:31] for Lucifer an activity for demonic
[1:19:35] activity for a cult activity
[1:19:37] I love to music and to the media the
[1:19:40] devil is able to do that then what can
[1:19:43] God do this morning under the influence
[1:19:46] of the voice of God what to go through
[1:19:49] with people who are willing to surrender
[1:19:52] themselves to the power of the Most High
[1:19:55] God
[1:19:55] we don't come at all
[1:19:57] we don't come in on name but blessed is
[1:20:00] he this morning that comes in the name
[1:20:03] of the Lord blessed is the man that
[1:20:12] walketh not in the counsel of the
[1:20:14] ungodly not standing away of the sinner
[1:20:16] nor sit in the seat of the scornful but
[1:20:19] his delight is in the law of God
[1:20:22] I mean law he meditate day and night the
[1:20:43] blessed man the righteous man many
[1:20:47] plates upon that law and his law is his
[1:20:52] word man shall not live by bread alone
[1:20:56] but by every word that proceedeth from
[1:21:01] the mouth of God that is what we were
[1:21:05] meant to live by is to live under the
[1:21:10] law to be blessed by that law to be
[1:21:14] covered by that law to be protected by
[1:21:16] our law but some hour man come out from
[1:21:19] under an law because the devil slip in
[1:21:22] and it is juice introduce something to
[1:21:24] Eve that was not below it was not what
[1:21:28] God said and God had already proclaimed

[1:21:36] that the day you eat thereof not there
[1:21:39] you die is not he had already spoken it
[1:21:44] and he couldn't take it back so I'm

[1:23:42] now same as somebody
[1:23:50] isn't that right caught today is that
[1:23:54] absolute authority
[1:23:55] once he speaks holiday that's the law
[1:23:59] that is his decree hallelujah what's a
[1:24:03] lot daughter smoking it so Shannon P
[1:24:05] it's not it's not right he has a power
[1:24:09] as unto a king Halle is nine there's a
[1:24:14] king of Syria the king of Russia the
[1:24:15] king of this the king of that but God is
[1:24:17] a king of the earth hallelujah
[1:24:22] hallelujah
[1:24:23] a man is only in authority because he's
[1:24:28] under authority but sometimes man forget
[1:24:31] the authority sometimes man forget who
[1:24:33] they're supposed to answer to right but
[1:24:37] why don't you forget or not whether you
[1:24:39] know it or not the law is still the law
[1:24:43] hallelujah you still have the answer to
[1:24:46] it you are still subject to it it's not
[1:24:55] God's Word is his law what word is this
[1:24:59] decree what word is hallelujah whatever
[1:25:02] it is it's shuttle in heaven forever
[1:25:04] whatever he speaks his trunk
[1:25:07] whatever he speaks is as good as
[1:25:08] finished or you can hang your soul on it
[1:25:12] it's not
[1:25:15] Ecclesiastes chapter 8 and verse 4 says
[1:25:20] where the word of a king is there is
[1:25:23] power and who may say unto Him what do
[1:25:28] is done in other words who is going to
[1:25:30] tell the King what are you doing why are
[1:25:33] you doing it you can't do that he is the
[1:25:37] absolute authority whatever he choose to
[1:25:39] - he could do it if the King choose to
[1:25:43] let you go he can let you go and of
[1:25:46] course he'll be with you I'll be in you
[1:25:49] who is minor the question not

[1:26:38] against it
[1:26:38] we'll stay right with it until he prove
[1:26:42] his word because God can only prove his

[1:35:17] hallelujah for testimony that poor is
[1:35:21] still the same
[1:35:24] [Music]
[1:35:30] oh it's not right okay so let me read a
[1:35:34] city sovereign amen that's what he wants
[1:35:38] no question it's not right
[1:35:41] hallelujah he's and you know what
[1:35:44] prophet said something very interesting
[1:35:45] him let's just zoom in on it he said
[1:35:48] people think that God can just do
[1:35:50] anything
[1:35:51] . very interesting i read this real slow
[1:35:55] so you can catch it people think that
[1:35:58] god can just do anything free really a
[1:36:03] man but no that's not that's not it he
[1:36:06] does what he wants to do he is he the
[1:36:10] only thing people think that god could
[1:36:12] do just anything he wants to see but god
[1:36:14] he said god cannot do anything he said
[1:36:18] god is obligated to his word did we get
[1:36:27] it now so he dropped from thought to an
[1:36:31] expression would so before he even
[1:36:33] created a world we are taught that the
[1:36:36] logos is what comfort food is now
[1:36:38] because it was the expression of his
[1:36:41] flock
[1:36:41] you can't bypass that process it's not
[1:36:45] right you can't jump the creation or not
[1:36:47] having the word first because he's
[1:36:50] obligated to that you understand the
[1:36:53] logos word is the expression image of
[1:36:57] the invisible god that you couldn't see
[1:37:00] for eons and eons of time do we don't
[1:37:05] know how long he was in existence
[1:37:06] there's no measure to that time only
[1:37:09] came into creation from in the beginning
[1:37:11] it's not right but before that he was
[1:37:15] caught forever he was an even call call
[1:37:18] but we call him that it's not right but
[1:37:20] he was Elohim the self-existent spirit
[1:37:24] entity from before there was ever time
[1:37:28] your mind cannot even stretch that far
[1:37:32] but that is what it was I'm not gonna
[1:37:36] tell you anything else because that is
[1:37:37] what it was he was called Almighty all
[1:37:40] alone by himself is now arrived but an
[1:37:43] out of this what you couldn't see spirit
[1:37:46] then came logos image and then out of
[1:37:51] that logos was spoken the word let there
[1:37:53] be
[1:37:53] let there be let there be it's not so
[1:37:58] the spirit now created something now
[1:38:00] channeling he the work through called a
[1:38:02] local school and then from that came
[1:38:04] creation came in the beginning God
[1:38:07] created the heavens and over no that's
[1:38:11] how we get Genesis 1 it's 900 that is
[1:38:15] God's process that is his modus operandi
[1:38:19] a man that's the way he operates that's
[1:38:23] a way he does it's not a man see so he
[1:38:27] sees he said God cannot just do anything
[1:38:29] he is obligated to his word he is
[1:38:35] compelled to it he has an agreement with
[1:38:39] that with his word he may not have an
[1:38:43] agreement with your thoughts with your
[1:38:45] ideas or what man is thinking or with
[1:38:48] man's way of doing things the only thing
[1:38:50] he can agree with is with his word
[1:39:06] so he said my prophet said now God
[1:39:08] cannot lie the Bible says he can't so
[1:39:13] there's one thing that God cannot do
[1:39:17] it's like there's one thing that he
[1:39:23] can't do this morning is he cannot lie
[1:39:27] he says is the truth it's the truth it's
[1:39:32] the truth
[1:39:33] and if he says you're gonna make it
[1:39:35] that's the truth if he says you're going
[1:39:37] to be filled with the Holy Ghost that's
[1:39:40] the truth if he says he's coming back
[1:39:42] for you and that's the truth and you say
[1:39:48] [Music]
[1:39:54] if there's one thing he can do he can
[1:39:57] lies glory to God a man wonderful Wow
[1:40:08] okay
[1:40:09] Amen hallelujah oh my he said no he says
[1:40:13] you can't do it see there's one thing I
[1:40:15] can't do and when God says anything and
[1:40:18] makes a promise God God cannot take that
[1:40:25] promise back because he's God
[1:40:28] I'll read that again one more time so
[1:40:31] when God says anything because he is the
[1:40:35] absolute authority because he is
[1:40:37] covering up all things when he says
[1:40:40] anything when God makes a promise to you
[1:40:44] God cannot take that promise back hello
[1:40:50] he's already spoken it Florida
[1:40:59] it's a Word of God it's like an our data
[1:41:04] shot from the bow once you pull it it
[1:41:08] have no grabbing it back it's already
[1:41:10] spoken it's got to reach especially the
[1:41:15] Word of God shall not return unto me
[1:41:18] void but it shall accomplish that which
[1:41:22] I sent it on to shuffle pill that's
[1:41:28] which I please shake hello hallelujah
[1:41:40] that's why the most powerful thing is
[1:41:43] his word because once he speaketh the
[1:41:47] miraculous trust take place once God
[1:41:51] says something the devil all know that
[1:41:55] his time is up because once the King has
[1:41:59] spoken it once it is declared
[1:42:01] once it is decreed then it's brought to
[1:42:04] take place and listen it does not matter
[1:42:09] at a time that word could have been
[1:42:13] spoken a hundred years it might have
[1:42:16] lost its juice so to speak man I might
[1:42:20] have forgotten about it it might be
[1:42:22] laying there may be on Scrolls may be on
[1:42:25] books on tapes but one scroll spoke
[1:42:29] something it's got to take place
[1:42:32] hallelujah
[1:42:40] because that word has got a German and
[1:42:44] it's got a life in it and it's got a
[1:42:48] prophecy in it that when it finds good
[1:42:51] ground it's gonna take on life of its
[1:42:54] own
[1:42:56] hallelujah so nCore eternal God spoke in
[1:43:02] the beginning I have thoughts in his
[1:43:05] mind thoughts of what you are going to
[1:43:07] be thought about where you're going to
[1:43:09] live thoughts about how you are going to
[1:43:11] grow up how you were gonna find Jesus oh
[1:43:14] you are gonna find the gospel and he
[1:43:17] spoke it that word went out from his
[1:43:21] mouth and it went I don't care for
[1:43:25] thousands of years your word I've been
[1:43:28] circling but you are here this morning
[1:43:31] and the word concerning you is going
[1:43:36] take on life we are gonna find
[1:43:49] hallelujah hallelujah the word
[1:43:52] concerning you oh my god hallelujah so
[1:44:04] we're just kind of building something
[1:44:05] now he said now when God says anything
[1:44:09] he cannot take it back see because he's
[1:44:12] God and he's sovereign hallelujah even
[1:44:17] the Devils are subject to him it's nice
[1:44:22] hallelujah
[1:44:23] when the sons of God came to worship
[1:44:26] hallelujah is now right even the devil
[1:44:29] came also to worship and God called him
[1:44:31] to I said have you considered my servant
[1:44:35] children he is suffering he can say
[1:44:38] whatever you want to he drew that there
[1:44:40] was attention to his own son why for
[1:44:45] purpose because he felt that job needed
[1:44:47] some trials because they felt some
[1:44:50] scriptures needed to be fulfilled that
[1:44:52] though he slay me and I trust him if
[1:44:55] that some scriptures needed to be
[1:44:56] fulfilled
[1:44:57] some scriptures needed to be written and
[1:45:00] the only way you can write it is through
[1:45:02] the righteousness of job so God in truth
[1:45:05] was tried this way
[1:45:08] we tried that swing it's nice and that
[1:45:14] is how we get the scripture I know my
[1:45:17] redeemer liveth though the skin worms
[1:45:19] destroy this body yet in my flesh will I
[1:45:23] see clawed for myself it had to be that
[1:45:27] way but trials had to come the boyars
[1:45:31] had to come so that we could get that
[1:45:33] blessed holy scripture do you see it now
[1:45:45] do you see it now that's why things had
[1:45:48] to happen to you
[1:45:51] and brought out so beautifully the
[1:45:54] continuation of the book of the
[1:45:56] generation of Jesus Christ and then that
[1:45:59] book had all kind of faults it had
[1:46:01] people affairs failures mistakes all
[1:46:05] kinds of short comments they had their
[1:46:07] stories but God crafted into that story
[1:46:11] all kinds of isms and schisms but he was
[1:46:15] coming down to a perfect one a sinless
[1:46:18] one that would redeem them all even come
[1:46:34] to redeem people who was perfect think

[1:47:12] hallelujah waters some to the flood some
[1:47:16] to great trials but all through the plan
[1:47:19] when Christ Saddam was slain upon that
[1:47:22] cross and he said it is finished brother
[1:47:26] I could imagine in a supernatural
[1:47:28] what a shockwave that sent out
[1:47:30] throughout all yet hallelujah hallelujah
[1:47:33] finish all the temples flange all of the
[1:47:36] temples ideas all of the gravels traps
[1:47:39] all that the devil tried to do the
[1:47:42] Pirates had the grave shook loose and
[1:47:45] people who are bound in sin came up and
[1:47:50] was seen of many walking around the
[1:47:53] streets God set them free instantly oh
[1:48:08] my I'm going this way and that
[1:48:12] pray for me this morning I'm a man okay
[1:48:16] so he said he said he can't go back on
[1:48:18] that promise
[1:48:19] he said now how many believes that's
[1:48:21] true he says so he says he says
[1:48:25] therefore there should be no more
[1:48:26] arguing he said which can prove it and
[1:48:28] he minister and the gospel can prove is
[1:48:30] that the divine healing was included in
[1:48:32] the atonement is no promise that he was
[1:48:36] wounded for our transgressions with His
[1:48:39] stripes we were healed is that right
[1:48:41] oh he said that just settles it on one
[1:48:49] line
[1:48:50] he said if it wasn't in the atonement if
[1:48:52] it he said then if it wasn't in your
[1:48:54] tone men and God's Word says so he said
[1:48:57] then it's right anyhow he said cause God
[1:48:59] is obligated to his word he's obligated
[1:49:03] to it man it's not but about tells the
[1:49:06] story I said brother Baxter the other
[1:49:08] day in a discussion he said give the
[1:49:10] most beautiful illustration illustration
[1:49:13] he said that in a certain land listen to
[1:49:16] the story he said it was a righteous
[1:49:18] King he said on a king was going to
[1:49:21] execute a slave he said on the laws of
[1:49:24] the land said that this King must kill
[1:49:27] the slave and the slaves standing before
[1:49:30] the king
[1:49:31] was trembling a new verse and the king
[1:49:34] said now don't he said he said what do
[1:49:37] you require before I kill you what do
[1:49:40] you require before I have your life
[1:49:41] taker and he said the sleep said a glass
[1:49:44] of water and so the King K game gave the
[1:49:48] slave a glass of water and he was
[1:49:50] standing and he said and he was so
[1:49:53] nervous that he couldn't get it into his
[1:49:55] mouth because he's gonna die see so he
[1:49:57] was just it was just spilling out all
[1:49:59] out like that and the King said now look
[1:50:02] straighten up said I'm going to take
[1:50:04] your life he said no the King said I'm
[1:50:07] not going to take your life until you
[1:50:09] drink that water and the King looked up
[1:50:14] at him the King the slave looked up at
[1:50:16] him rather and throw the water out and
[1:50:19] the King had to let him go for it was
[1:50:23] his word the Prophet said he was a
[1:50:26] righteous king he was a good man and a
[1:50:29] prophet said and God is more than just a
[1:50:32] good man he is soft operator saying this
[1:50:41] morning he operates by a certain law a
[1:50:44] certain framework it's not all like Eva
[1:50:47] he's operating my sitting law is not
[1:50:50] right that's why when you were lost in
[1:50:54] sin he had to come a certain way in
[1:50:57] order to redeem you he had to subject
[1:51:03] himself to his own law in order to
[1:51:08] redeem you he had to bring himself into
[1:51:11] a state like yours into a condition is
[1:51:16] not a flashlight condition in order to
[1:51:20] redeem him he was without sin yet he
[1:51:23] took sin upon himself and went on the
[1:51:28] cross and died like a sinner
[1:51:32] hallelujah because it was the only way
[1:51:35] to redeem you back the great mighty King
[1:51:41] surrender himself brought himself to a
[1:51:44] lowly stage
[1:51:55] you
[1:52:00] he rode into Jerusalem so symbolic
[1:52:03] riding upon a donkey showing his
[1:52:06] humility
[1:52:07] while they cried Hosanna Hosanna blessed
[1:52:10] is he who comes in the name of the Lord
[1:52:13] they worshiped they sang and the
[1:52:16] Pharisees didn't understand it the
[1:52:18] scribes didn't understand it they said
[1:52:20] tell those people stop making so much
[1:52:23] noise
[1:52:23] stop worshipping so much stop praising
[1:52:27] so much stop thanking so much sounds a
[1:52:30] lot like the devil but jesus said if
[1:52:33] these people don't worship if these
[1:52:36] people don't make this noise the rocks
[1:52:39] themselves will begin to cry out because
[1:52:43] they recognize who this man is and when
[1:52:47] you recognize who God is in your life

[1:58:33] happened when Jesus was in the boat he
[1:58:36] was there sleeping and the waves were
[1:58:39] blowing contrary at that point the
[1:58:42] disciples are scared but just imagine
[1:58:44] trying to be a tiny little dinghy in a
[1:58:47] sea or ocean of roaring waves waves
[1:58:51] going back and forth to create this of
[1:58:53] the ocean roaring how deep below them
[1:58:57] they don't know hallelujah some of them
[1:58:59] can't swim is now they fear for their
[1:59:02] lives in that moment they seem to be in
[1:59:05] the hands of something monstrous
[1:59:07] something deadly something that seemed
[1:59:10] to consume them something I was
[1:59:12] flattered powerful that they could even
[1:59:14] understand or fathom the rain was
[1:59:16] falling the lightning was flashing the
[1:59:19] Thunder was worried the sea was walking
[1:59:22] back and forth like a great time Norma's
[1:59:25] body of water you can imagine that they
[1:59:28] were frightened but they said go away
[1:59:30] Jesus
[1:59:31] I went Jesus woke up he rubbed his eyes
[1:59:33] and he looked around holidays night and
[1:59:38] he spoke to her in and he said peace be
[1:59:40] still it's not and somehow another all
[1:59:46] of that great wind all of that lightning
[1:59:49] all of that fun
[1:59:51] all of that great cloud but here was
[1:59:54] someone what the power another wind high
[1:59:58] wind
[1:59:59] something that blows away too strong
[2:00:01] don't you worry this morning there's
[2:00:04] something greater than you could see
[2:00:06] greater than you greater than I that
[2:00:10] voices creature greater than your touts
[2:00:13] greater than your fears that voice goes
[2:00:16] to pass your feelings
[2:00:18] wash your shortcomings hallelujah
[2:00:21] hallelujah hallelujah so here's the
[2:00:33] thing what we have to do is to anoint or
[2:00:37] faith enough to see only God's Word and
[2:00:43] to encourage your faith enough to see
[2:00:46] God's Word only and no other word
[2:00:49] concerning your life because if you see
[2:00:53] anything else it will distract you it'll
[2:00:57] shake you from your purpose that's why
[2:01:00] you've got to remain single life and
[2:01:02] single motive and single purpose on the
[2:01:06] word concerning your life if you keep
[2:01:12] your eye on the prize if you know God is
[2:01:14] going to deliver your family keep your
[2:01:17] eyes fixed on that word don't care what
[2:01:20] condition don't care what happens on the
[2:01:23] Left what happens on the right keep your
[2:01:26] eye on possible and what he said hello
[2:01:34] the devil cannot shake you once you're
[2:01:38] dead eye on that word hallelujah
[2:01:42] I don't would have never fallen he would
[2:01:45] have never fallen if they kept eyes on
[2:01:47] the road but it first had to lay down
[2:01:49] the world in order to take up the
[2:01:51] enemy's interpretation it's not and when
[2:01:55] they did that then they fell but as long
[2:01:58] as they were in our word they could
[2:01:59] never be defeated
[2:02:01] hallelujah because they were covered by
[2:02:02] his law by his decree by His Word and
[2:02:06] what he said isn't keep that word ever
[2:02:16] before you it's now I shall not be moved
[2:02:22] David said go ten thousand fall on my
[2:02:25] left hand ten thousand of my right
[2:02:28] whatever doesn't matter like the pastor
[2:02:32] says step over the bodies
[2:02:33] don't let them dis wait you it's not
[2:02:38] right be fully persuaded this morning
[2:02:41] the Bible is a book of the stories of
[2:02:45] men and women who are fully persuaded by
[2:02:49] the things that they have seen and heard
[2:02:51] they were fully persuaded by it
[2:02:54] hallelujah so persuaded with him but
[2:02:58] they feared not their lives unto death
[2:03:00] but they swore hallelujah that what God
[2:03:04] said it would bring it to pass and they
[2:03:06] stood with it isn't that right glory to
[2:03:10] God a partisan Abrams Telenor the
[2:03:12] promise of cloth or a little to unbelief
[2:03:15] what was strong giving praise to God
[2:03:18] though his feet was trying though he was
[2:03:21] wearing though he was slain this way and
[2:03:24] that way his freaking standing because
[2:03:27] Karl had spoken and revealed to him he
[2:03:31] didn't speak to Sarah but he's fooled
[2:03:32] Abraham and Abraham's faith stood for 25
[2:03:36] years believing believing hallelujah
[2:03:39] that God would send that promised son Oh
[2:03:41] hallelujah is now so it's time for a
[2:03:49] faint to begin to rise up in the wood of
[2:03:52] God to be anointed towards the wood of
[2:03:54] God I know it sounds common it's not
[2:03:58] like somebody we say all the time
[2:03:59] but there's a real result there's a real
[2:04:03] genuine results when you remain focused
[2:04:06] to your objectives
[2:04:08] to what you are trying to achieve people
[2:04:12] in the natural to amazing things when
[2:04:15] they remain focused and what they're
[2:04:17] trying to achieve it's not right when
[2:04:22] Thomas Edison is now right was making it
[2:04:24] a lightbulb it's now right
[2:04:26] they found a hundred ways how not to do
[2:04:30] it but what was he doing trying and
[2:04:33] trying again why because they believed
[2:04:36] that it could be done and they kept on
[2:04:39] pursuing pursuing they kept on persuaded
[2:04:42] that they could somehow harness the
[2:04:45] power of electricity and because one man
[2:04:48] sacrificed and tried and tried and tried
[2:04:52] again we have lightbulbs in this
[2:04:55] building right now as a progression of
[2:04:57] the original technology that they
[2:04:59] created back there in the beginning all
[2:05:01] right but many early times and if man
[2:05:04] could achieve so much in a natural how
[2:05:06] much could you achieve this morning when
[2:05:09] we treat the road with diligence Harlan
[2:05:13] when we treat the world with industry I
[2:05:15] love with motives with objectives on a
[2:05:19] single eye single motive Oh swim in on
[2:05:24] your prayer focus in with your prayer
[2:05:26] and with your face this morning on the
[2:05:30] promised Word of God if you focus enough
[2:05:35] what we're saying this morning is God is
[2:05:37] obligated to fulfill Halloween his
[2:05:40] promise on the basis of his promise to
[2:05:43] fulfill upward this morning that's right
[2:05:51] no matter what comes or goes it's got to
[2:05:54] happen got to happen he said oh can you
[2:05:58] see the infallibility of the world
[2:05:59] Amen oh my he had blinded their eyes he
[2:06:03] had hardened their hearts that they
[2:06:05] should not see with their eyes nor
[2:06:08] understand with their hearts and be
[2:06:10] converted and I should heal them he said
[2:06:13] look God through his prophet Isaiah a
[2:06:16] man who had his ups and downs like we do
[2:06:21] hallelujah they were men of like
[2:06:22] passions you think you have trials they
[2:06:26] lived in a time where there was famine
[2:06:28] and pestilence and soared while we drive
[2:06:32] an air-conditioned cars it's not right
[2:06:35] a man see there are trials see a man the
[2:06:40] ups and downs like we do had his

[2:07:08] thought God's thought through word and
[2:07:12] no matter what they done Isaiah's words
[2:07:15] had to be fulfilled for it was God's
[2:07:22] thought expressed through Isaiah that's
[2:07:30] powerful isn't it so hail Isaiah

[2:22:01] connected to this very daily promises
[2:22:04] that he has made concerning you so
[2:22:07] connected as he that if you cut you if
[2:22:10] you pull this up away from his promises
[2:22:11] you cut yourself off from him because
[2:22:15] he's not obligated to anything else but
[2:22:18] his promises but his word what is law
[2:22:20] and what he said he would do
[2:22:23] because if he's big enough to speak it

[2:29:12] boy and and so on that was Moses his
[2:29:16] plan but I wasn't God's plan God's plan
[2:29:20] is different from your plan sometimes I
[2:29:23] think God even laughs at our plans
[2:29:25] because we think this somebody think
[2:29:27] that and we imagine a very different
[2:29:30] future for ourselves and for children
[2:29:32] and for all life and I'll walk but God
[2:29:36] has something better in store for us
[2:29:38] hallelujah that be without us are not
[2:29:41] made perfect Oh hallelujah so here was
[2:29:43] Moses was out tending to the fields when
[2:29:47] he saw what it was a burning bush and he
[2:29:50] said I'll turn aside to look and see
[2:29:51] what this attraction is upon the
[2:29:53] mountain I went Moses drew closer and
[2:29:56] when he drew closer to this attraction a
[2:29:58] voice spoke from the bush and said take
[2:30:01] your shoes from off your feet hallelujah
[2:30:03] our Moses did it I'm glad this voice
[2:30:05] began to speak to him
[2:30:07] how do you I'll tell him some things
[2:30:08] that he had never heard before
[2:30:10] challah is nice and he said Moses I am
[2:30:14] calm down
[2:30:15] I have heard the cries of my people I
[2:30:17] have come down Moses and I'm sending you
[2:30:20] to go and deliver them hallelujah
[2:30:24] hallelujah someone to represent me I
[2:30:26] need somebody to speak for me and I've
[2:30:29] chosen a man and I've chosen you to do
[2:30:31] it and Moses had every written excuse in
[2:30:36] the book
[2:30:37] hallelujah isn't that right I couldn't
[2:30:40] talk stutter oh I didn't have a
[2:30:42] confidence you know he didn't have the
[2:30:44] wherewithal and God said go on go on
[2:30:46] with the excuses continue let me know
[2:30:49] when you're finished already was
[2:30:52] finished God said you still going
[2:30:55] hallelujah because I've chosen you I've
[2:30:58] already spoken it I can't take it back
[2:31:01] when I look to the book I see that you
[2:31:04] didn't want to have to go down and do
[2:31:05] this thing so I don't care what your
[2:31:08] human spirit says I don't care what your
[2:31:10] thought says I don't care how much doubt
[2:31:12] you have in your mind but what if God
[2:31:14] has already spoken but what I've got
[2:31:16] declares and I'm gonna send deliverance
[2:31:18] for my people therefore you go down
[2:31:21] there hallelujah hallelujah when God has
[2:31:27] finished with Moses Moses countenance
[2:31:30] was changed his walk was changed his
[2:31:33] talk was changed how after a burning
[2:31:36] bush experience and that's what we need
[2:31:38] this morning to meet that burning bush
[2:31:41] to meet that pillar fire to meet that
[2:31:44] Holy Ghost anointing that's annoying
[2:31:47] thing that changes that anointing that
[2:31:49] rearranges and removes your doubts that
[2:31:52] removes your fears that dispels the
[2:31:54] darkness and the chaos in your mind to
[2:31:57] give you a clearer picture let you know
[2:32:00] who you are and who you are who you are
[2:32:21] okay so Hebrews chapter 2 and if you if
[2:32:25] you witnessed anything he said now let
[2:32:27] me read some things pull these things
[2:32:28] out
[2:32:29] I said now if you witnessed anything
[2:32:31] you're just as guilty as being a
[2:32:33] partaker of it irena again if you are
[2:32:37] witness to anything you are just as
[2:32:39] guilty as being a partaker of it he said
[2:32:44] so if we witness and say oh yes they
[2:32:48] ought not to have done this and so on
[2:32:49] and so on he said be careful what you
[2:32:52] say because you're guilty the way or
[2:32:57] judgment goes
[2:33:04] that's what I Bible says if we should
[2:33:06] judge ourselves we should not be judged
[2:33:08] but when we are judged we are chastened
[2:33:10] of the Lord it's now right and to show
[2:33:13] his debt till he come he said the way of
[2:33:15] judgment goes on all right he said if
[2:33:16] you can't decide don't say nothing
[2:33:19] he said just leave it alone he said but
[2:33:22] then many when you testify that you are
[2:33:25] a Christian he said then you are guilty
[2:33:28] see he said you're guilty of being a
[2:33:31] Christian and he said you must live to
[2:33:34] that professor with your mouth you say I
[2:33:40] am this then you have to prove what you
[2:33:42] are your life proves what you are that
[2:33:45] man will see Alleluia a my what your
[2:33:48] works are because your work to tell
[2:33:49] praise God your fruits will tell of what
[2:33:52] you are is now right by your food Jesus
[2:33:55] said you shall know them isn't that
[2:33:57] right no please he tell everybody I'm a
[2:34:03] Christian he threw out the hatchet first
[2:34:07] amen so people knew what to expect of
[2:34:10] him it's not right I don't do this I
[2:34:13] don't do that right now people looking
[2:34:15] at you see you already professor with
[2:34:17] your mouth so you can go back on that
[2:34:19] now let's do something else you've got
[2:34:21] to live up to that expectation
[2:34:23] it's not right Amen that's the way it is
[2:34:26] he he said you're guilty of being a
[2:34:27] Christian if you profess you claim to be
[2:34:29] a Christian he said you're guilty of
[2:34:31] that because you claimed it you
[2:34:33] professed it isn't right he said you
[2:34:35] must lift it up he said and when God
[2:34:36] makes a promise here Islam in the Bible
[2:34:39] he said he said I see men here no
[2:34:42] wheelchair he said but when God makes a
[2:34:44] promise he said he is guilty of that
[2:34:47] promise unless he brings it to pass the
[2:34:54] Prophet here said God is guilty when he
[2:34:57] makes a promise so just as you are held
[2:35:00] accountable for your words God is held
[2:35:02] accountable for his words and for his
[2:35:06] promises and he is guilty of that
[2:35:09] promise until he brings it to pass God
[2:35:11] is guilty when he makes a promise he
[2:35:13] said and the Scriptures are guilty until
[2:35:15] they
[2:35:17] 4/5 he said see there there right best
[2:35:20] there as a statement at quarters made
[2:35:22] its got to be fulfilled he said or God
[2:35:25] is guilty something else my mine said
[2:35:29] see you listen to this he said listeners
[2:35:31] also he said if God doesn't at the scene
[2:35:35] no we just expressing what God operation
[2:35:37] is right he said listen this if God
[2:35:40] doesn't act the same when the same
[2:35:42] circumstances arise he says then God is
[2:35:45] guilty of being partial to his people
[2:35:51] no God serenity demands of him to work
[2:35:57] in every case like he did in the first
[2:36:00] case oh he was wrong when he worked in
[2:36:05] the first case and we know that God is
[2:36:07] not wrong so if he did it once before
[2:36:10] he's got to do it again hallelujah
[2:36:15] that's why we know the Holy Ghost is
[2:36:17] gonna pour out because if your faith
[2:36:20] it's just like what the early church had
[2:36:22] then crawl we'll do it again if you've
[2:36:27] got faith for your healing
[2:36:28] hallelujah like what he said then caught
[2:36:31] scrunch it to it again hallelujah once
[2:36:37] your feet meets the same condition it's
[2:36:40] got to have the same reaction we're
[2:36:57] proving God by the scriptures here my
[2:36:59] heat many man hallelujah see but God is
[2:37:02] a judge and he's not wrong so when he
[2:37:05] makes the case it's gonna be that way
[2:37:07] it's now oh my he said if God is not
[2:37:10] this way the same way he did in the
[2:37:11] first case then he if he will not
[2:37:14] different to the second case then he
[2:37:16] acted wrong when he acted on the first
[2:37:18] case so he said if God healed the sick
[2:37:21] in the Old Testament the Prophet said he
[2:37:23] has got to do it in the New Testament
[2:37:26] and today
[2:37:28] hallelujah that's why right now you can
[2:37:32] claim your healing to the shed blood of
[2:37:34] Jesus Christ because if you heal them
[2:37:36] back then he could do it for you today
[2:37:38] what he did for them back here he'll do
[2:37:42] for you the shame oh I'm glad that I
[2:37:45] could say I'm one of them
[2:37:47] Oh hallelujah hallelujah oh he can heal
[2:37:51] the sick he'll do it today if he raised
[2:37:54] the dead up he'll do it today if he
[2:37:56] delivered a captive you to it today if
[2:37:58] he opened a blind eyes he could do it
[2:38:00] today if he open the Deaf here he could
[2:38:02] do it today if he make the lame walk if
[2:38:05] he made the plans here if he did it in
[2:38:08] time posh he can do the same for you if
[2:38:11] he's safe back there he could save you
[2:38:14] this morning if he delivered back there
[2:38:16] he can deliver you this morning the Word
[2:38:18] of God is the same yesterday today and
[2:38:21] forever
[2:38:27] he has to do the New Testament today or
[2:38:30] he did wrong when He healed him back
[2:38:32] there he's got to do the act the same
[2:38:34] every time and he will do it when when
[2:38:38] the same faith meets the condition the
[2:38:47] Lord but over all possible of its last
[2:38:51] Sunday he mentioned this quote here and
[2:38:55] it struck me while I was sitting there
[2:38:57] listen to it
[2:38:58] amen and I want to read it back for you
[2:39:01] in the third seal he said now that's the
[2:39:03] reason today

[2:39:06] have denominational revivals we haven't
[2:39:09] had a real stirring no no no no no sir
[2:39:11] don't think we've got revivals we have
[2:39:15] not yet prophet said or they've got
[2:39:18] millions and millions of church members
[2:39:19] but not a revival no way no no the pride
[2:39:24] hasn't had a revival yet see there's
[2:39:27] been no revival there no manifestation
[2:39:29] of God to stir the bride yet he said see
[2:39:32] but we're looking for it now it'll take
[2:39:35] those seven unknown thunders back
[2:39:37] to wit to wake up again see
[2:39:40] yeah he said you send it he promised it
[2:39:43] now watch
[2:39:44] he said no she was there he said and now
[2:39:48] here's the party's talking about
[2:39:49] he said now if the churches would forget
[2:39:52] their Creed's and forget their dogmas
[2:39:55] and just take the Bible and plead the
[2:39:59] promise then it would come effective to
[2:40:03] them take the promises he said he said
[2:40:09] he'll deliver
[2:40:10] he said he's party spirit upon all flesh
[2:40:13] he said you shall receive power after
[2:40:16] the Holy Ghost come upon you
[2:40:17] hallelujah he said he said plead the
[2:40:20] promises this morning Oh God is still
[2:40:23] the same and he promised to deliver he
[2:40:26] promised to restore he promised to open
[2:40:28] a plan eyes he promised a fiver ojala we
[2:40:32] promised my people shall humble
[2:40:34] themselves and pray i'm turn from their
[2:40:37] wicked ways that they were here from
[2:40:39] heaven he promises and therefore we live
[2:40:42] upon God's altar the Lord sent a fire
[2:40:46] notch and the power lots and the
[2:40:49] anointing you promised that my people
[2:40:52] shall sojourn in a change land but you
[2:40:55] bring them out when I'm mighty
[2:40:58] hallelujah God I made a promise he is
[2:41:02] able to fulfill his promise this morning
[2:41:04] he is able to keep his promise word to
[2:41:08] fulfill it let the caller answer my fire
[2:41:11] let my court because this morning I let
[2:41:14] him burn evil eyes creation me revival

[2:41:44] dogmas and just take the Bible and plead
[2:41:48] the promise then it would come effective
[2:41:50] today but you see Jesus said you were
[2:41:53] taught traditions make the Word of God
[2:41:57] non-affected to you he said well that's
[2:42:00] the same thing today with spiritual ease
[2:42:03] see the spiritual bride today the
[2:42:06] so-called church that she takes a word
[2:42:08] of God but she won't accept it and she
[2:42:11] accepts dogmas instead and therefore the
[2:42:14] word is not effective to her because she
[2:42:17] tries to inject her Creed with the word
[2:42:20] and it won't work anything else don't
[2:42:28] take anything else don't accept anything
[2:42:30] else but what God said but what God's
[2:42:33] Word says who is now right amen amen

[2:57:39] dead beasts he said only take on oath
[2:57:41] over the dead beasts that if they break
[2:57:42] this covenant that may their body be as
[2:57:44] dead as this piece and they gave each
[2:57:47] one a piece and it was sent away and

[3:11:27] crying out if the people could only
[3:11:29] realize that what is given right unto
[3:11:33] them anything you ask for will be given
[3:11:37] if you can appropriate the faith to
[3:11:40] believe it for God's Word is true and he
[3:11:45] said on now God's Word will defeat Satan
[3:11:49] anywhere any place any time and now when
[3:11:54] Jesus was here on earth he said I

[3:11:58] in Christ he said all the great
[3:12:01] qualities of the father was in Christ
[3:12:02] Jesus
[3:12:03] the son when he was here on earth and
[3:12:05] all the father was his has was his and
[3:12:09] all the fine gifts that's in God and all
[3:12:12] I was in Christ and when he made Satan
[3:12:15] he never used any of those gifts he said
[3:12:19] just be like he just meant you bigger
[3:12:21] example he just told the devil it is
[3:12:23] written it is written it's not right
[3:12:26] he brought it what the prophet said he
[3:12:28] brought it to where the very weakest of
[3:12:32] sinners this morning though he said he
[3:12:34] said if he had the power right then to
[3:12:37] rebuke Satan and send him away what he
[3:12:40] did he never referred to any gifts the
[3:12:43] prophets that he brought it down to the
[3:12:44] point where any weakness of Christians
[3:12:46] if you feel like the weakness of
[3:12:48] Christians this morning all you have to
