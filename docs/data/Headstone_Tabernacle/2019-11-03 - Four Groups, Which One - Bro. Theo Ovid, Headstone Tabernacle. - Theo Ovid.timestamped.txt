[48:50] time and I know what Isaac and Ghana had
[48:54] a tremendous time also when it's time
[48:57] come he will share with you but we had a
[48:58] real tremendous time in Argentina
[49:02] I want to thank on Brunton II I didn't
[49:04] get to get a message for the last Sunday
[49:07] service true seed of the world last
[49:08] Sunday and I thought you were really
[49:11] blessed inspiration the Lord look upon
[49:14] the heart and in Argentina I have no
[49:17] words and the testimonies were so very
[49:19] encouraging just want to read maybe just
[49:22] two for you but it's you I want to give
[49:25] you my personal testimony of the
[49:27] meetings in Argentina I hope this
[49:29] message to my brother last night I could
[49:31] hardly sleep because I was meditating on
[49:33] the messages that Holy Spirit brought
[49:35] this weekend and certainly what is
[49:37] mature we have received power in our
[49:39] souls our understanding was open to see
[49:42] the world in the present tense and God
[49:45] wants us to take us deeper into
[49:47] revelation but God has placed in my
[49:49] heart that we should give the importance
[49:51] to life and the right spirit I my
[49:55] brother met the Lord and I will never be
[49:58] the same
[49:58] I believe it out a doubt that your
[50:01] ministry will be powerfully occupied in
[50:03] this last ride the Holy Spirit has
[50:06] focused me to stand firm on the world in
[50:08] these meetings we could see a channel
[50:11] flowing free of anointed and Commission
[50:13] interpretation I encourage you to move
[50:16] forward looking only to Jesus we must
[50:18] give the true importance to our Lord
[50:20] Jesus Christ
[50:21] I appreciate you much of a servant of
[50:23] Christ for the building of us as
[50:25] Hispanics I think I will see you very
[50:27] soon I'll be praying for a ministry the

[1:08:09] we have sinned we have done wickedly Oh
[1:08:11] Lord according to all I righteousness I
[1:08:13] beseech thee let her hunger and I fear
[1:08:16] we turn away from thy city Jerusalem a
[1:08:18] holy mountain because of our sins and

[1:08:38] whole our desolations on the city which
[1:08:40] is called by thy name for we do not

[1:08:50] Lord Hockman Duke defer not for their
[1:08:52] own sake o my god
[1:08:53] for a city and
[1:08:55] people have a call by name and while I
[1:08:57] was speaking and praying and confessing
[1:09:01] my sin and the sin of my people Israel
[1:09:03] and presenting my supplication before
[1:09:06] the Lord my God for the holy mountain of
[1:09:08] my god here while I was speaking in
[1:09:10] prayer even a man Gabriel whom I had
[1:09:12] seen in the vision at the beginning
[1:09:13] being caused to fly swiftly touched me
[1:09:16] about a time of the evil ablation and
[1:09:18] inform me and talk of me say no Daniel I
[1:09:21] am NOT comfort to give this skill and
[1:09:23] understanding at the beginning of ice
[1:09:26] application the commandment came forth
[1:09:28] and I have come to show thee for thy
[1:09:30] word greatly beloved
[1:09:31] therefore understand the matter and
[1:09:33] consider the vision or praising in the
[1:09:36] Lord after Daniel had that burden a
[1:09:38] prayer oh my the Spirit came upon Daniel
[1:09:41] praise God to speak to Daniel to reveal
[1:09:44] things the Daniel you have to get into
[1:09:46] that spirit of Prayer you must want that
[1:09:48] spirit of prayer amen the tip that we
[1:09:50] have isn't long but I want to have a
[1:09:52] time a prayer a small time a prayer I
[1:09:54] just want it you should connect the body
[1:09:55] I believe that connect with what
[1:09:56] happened on Friday night cause something
[1:09:58] took place on Friday night oh praise it
[1:10:00] listen Oliver Graham says and remember
[1:10:02] at that great day of judgment your
[1:10:04] prayers will be counted just as much in
[1:10:08] that revival as my efforts would be to
[1:10:11] bring them there are people like free
[1:10:16] things everything free long-stem
[1:10:20] mentions may be your motive free free
[1:10:21] things yeah Calvary cost Jesus a revival
[1:10:26] cost there's a price for Brit truth
[1:10:29] there's a price to victory that is why
[1:10:32] character is not a gift it's a victory
[1:10:34] it's not so free so don't come
[1:10:37] philosopher no free ride don't look for
[1:10:39] anybody else to make the effort and you
[1:10:41] wait in the ride and jump in the
[1:10:43] anointing but you're praying you're not
[1:10:45] seeking God then that is why your will
[1:10:47] be able to take it with you in your know
[1:10:51] the Old Testament on the law when you
[1:10:53] pass through a cornfield
[1:10:54] you can pick off the corn is not your
[1:10:56] field if you're hungry you can pick and
[1:10:57] there's no sin to that no the court
[1:11:00] opinion last any but I said funny thing
[1:11:04] when the revivals begin to break out
[1:11:08] if you didn't put in you can't get it
[1:11:10] out you know oh you mean daddy issue
[1:11:16] with the foolish virgins that's right
[1:11:17] they didn't take the enough will to turn
[1:11:20] the spirit to be the extra oil in them
[1:11:23] because the world is spirit and life and
[1:11:26] the extra oil is what the wise virgin
[1:11:29] have received and when that would turn
[1:11:32] inside of you the fluids really could
[1:11:34] never get it because they never had it
[1:11:37] you have to have it inside of you
[1:11:39] because the rapture is not outside in
[1:11:41] raptures inside out
[1:11:43] cuttlefish Maxima compared to me
[1:11:45] somebody I will say again the rapture is
[1:11:48] not outside in it is inside out you have
[1:11:52] to have the laptop to go into the
[1:11:54] rapture come on give the Lord a show

[1:39:01] chapter when the Son of man shall come
[1:39:02] in his glory and all the holy angels
[1:39:04] with him then shall he sit upon the tool
[1:39:08] of his glory and before him shall be
[1:39:10] gathered all nations and he shall
[1:39:12] separate them one from another as a
[1:39:15] shepherd as a shepherd divideth his
[1:39:17] sheep from the goats he shall set the
[1:39:19] sheep on his right hand the goats on the
[1:39:22] left then shall the King say unto them
[1:39:26] on his right hand come ye blessed of my
[1:39:28] father inherit the kingdom prepared for
[1:39:31] you from the foundation of the world for
[1:39:33] I was a hungered and you gave me meat I

[1:39:38] stranger you took me in naked and he
[1:39:40] clothed me I was sick you visited me I
[1:39:43] was in prison you came unto me then
[1:39:46] shall the righteous answer him saying
[1:39:48] Lord when saw we thee an hungred and fed
[1:39:52] thee or thirsty or give thee drink when
[1:39:56] so he a stranger and took me in and
[1:39:58] naked and clothed he or when saw he sick
[1:40:01] or in prison and came unto thee and the
[1:40:04] King shall answer and say unto them
[1:40:06] verily I say unto you and as much as you
[1:40:08] have done it unto one of the least of
[1:40:11] these my brethren you have done it unto
[1:40:14] me
[1:40:15] then shall ye see unto them on the left
[1:40:17] hand depart from me ye cursed into
[1:40:20] everlasting fire prepared for the devil
[1:40:23] and his angels if I was hunger than you

[1:40:38] thee and hunger and a strange and naked
[1:40:41] sick o in prison did not minister the
[1:40:43] deep then shall he answered saying

[1:40:49] these you did it not to me and these
[1:40:52] shall go away into everlasting
[1:40:53] punishment but the righteous under life
[1:40:56] eternal
[1:40:57] our script final scripture Revelation
[1:41:00] chapter 13 verse 8 and all dwell upon
[1:41:02] the earth shall worship Him
[1:41:03] whose names are not written in the book
[1:41:05] of the life of the lamb slain from the
[1:41:07] foundation of the world may God bless
[1:41:09] his word you may be seated
[1:41:10] praise the Lord I really wish I fishes
[1:41:27] on a Sunday I don't know why I'm
[1:41:29] purchase tonight but this really feels
[1:41:32] like a Sunday message this is not heavy
[1:41:38] but with but Branagh so this is a title
[1:41:44] for groups which one to be really
[1:41:48] identifying for groups so I want you to
[1:41:51] coffee huge masks you're not in
[1:41:54] headstone tabernacle
[1:41:55] take out your message mask yeah no
[1:41:58] message you're a believer take up holy
[1:42:04] religious mastic take it off and just
[1:42:07] come and see what they would say tonight
[1:42:08] and receive what it would see tonight so
[1:42:11] it's not groups it's not it's not
[1:42:13] churches there's not any message and I
[1:42:15] believe on a brand no is not that is
[1:42:17] what God said in this hour Jana remember
[1:42:21] the kingdom of heaven is like none to
[1:42:24] these virgins five were wise five were
[1:42:26] foolish which group you in the wise got
[1:42:31] oil the foolish did not get oil what
[1:42:36] in what group you want to be
[1:42:39] because some point two times somebody
[1:42:41] had to get people are get desperate you
[1:42:44] must want to know that they line up with
[1:42:46] the scriptures the people either say
[1:42:49] what side you're on
[1:42:50] what good hook you in what church you in
[1:42:52] this is not this is different a bit
[1:42:55] different now he said you know if we
[1:42:57] live in the land time is the age that
[1:42:58] the churches are going to come together
[1:43:00] and as even now controlling world
[1:43:02] politics they will soon control the
[1:43:06] finances of the world
[1:43:08] then if you don't belong to the World
[1:43:10] Organization of Churches you won't be
[1:43:13] able to buy or to sell you would lose
[1:43:15] all now these are weighted words tonight
[1:43:20] they say you would lose all those who
[1:43:24] stay true to God and keep their garments
[1:43:27] clean from the file manure of church
[1:43:30] orders will be physically bereft there
[1:43:34] will be presented to them a great
[1:43:36] temptation to give him preachers will
[1:43:40] give in with the excuse that they will
[1:43:42] serve God within the framework of the
[1:43:45] Antichrist be system they will give into
[1:43:49] the flatteries and the blandishments of
[1:43:51] the hierarchy but the people will follow
[1:43:53] these false shepherds right into the
[1:43:55] slaughter but in the Judgment Day they
[1:43:58] will be found naked they will not be
[1:44:00] given microbes neither will they walk
[1:44:02] with him you can't walk in spotted
[1:44:05] garments of the world holding their
[1:44:07] hands with the devil here and then
[1:44:09] expect to be with God it is time to wake
[1:44:12] up and hear the voice of God crying come
[1:44:15] out of her organization religion and my
[1:44:18] people that you be not partakers of her
[1:44:20] sins God is speaking son the religions
[1:44:24] of this world like a Sunday plague leave
[1:44:27] off walking with the world and make a
[1:44:30] garments white by repentance and the
[1:44:32] better than do it no for tomorrow might
[1:44:35] be too late
[1:44:36] Oh glory to God he that overcometh I
[1:44:40] will not blot out his name out of the
[1:44:42] book of life hallelujah let's continue
[1:44:46] the possibility of the removal of a name
[1:44:50] from the records of God deserves more
[1:44:53] than a casual study for up until now
[1:44:56] most students have nearly drawn a
[1:44:59] conclusion that God places the names of
[1:45:03] those born again within the Lamb's Book
[1:45:05] of Life at the time of the ribbet and if
[1:45:08] for any reason that may must be removed
[1:45:10] the space on the record will simply be
[1:45:14] blank as it was before a name will be
[1:45:16] placed there this is 100% opposite
[1:45:21] what the wood actually teaches at the
[1:45:23] very start of our study let it be known
[1:45:26] that there is not one scripture that
[1:45:29] teaches that God is presently compiling
[1:45:32] a record of names this was all done
[1:45:35] before the foundation of the world
[1:45:37] after we pointed out shortly it's not a
[1:45:40] question of simply involving ourselves
[1:45:42] with two groups of people both of whom
[1:45:44] had the opportunity to receive it in a
[1:45:46] life where when one group received it
[1:45:48] and had their names placed on record and
[1:45:51] the others who refused it did not have
[1:45:53] their names replaced we will actually
[1:45:55] show by scripture that multi-tools were
[1:45:59] not even born again will point it in a
[1:46:01] life aha that's a big one
[1:46:07] multitude will go on that are not even
[1:46:12] born again and get eternal life always a
[1:46:16] big thing tonight this is not schemer
[1:46:19] tonight right we will also show that
[1:46:22] there's a group of people whose me
[1:46:25] haven't been placed on that record
[1:46:28] before the phone in the world cannot
[1:46:31] under any circumstances have those name
[1:46:34] removed and we will also show that
[1:46:41] another group whose names are on that
[1:46:43] record before the foundation of the
[1:46:44] world will have their name removed to
[1:46:47] begin with there's no basis for the
[1:46:49] claim that the Lamb's Book of Life is
[1:46:51] not the same as the book of life the
[1:46:52] book of life might be called the Lance
[1:46:54] book of life or Christ book of life or
[1:46:56] even died book or the book of the living
[1:46:57] only names are written on it and the
[1:47:00] scripture he says quote revelation 13:8
[1:47:02] all that dwell upon the earth shall
[1:47:04] worship Him the Beast whose names were
[1:47:06] not written in the book of life of the
[1:47:08] lamb slain from the foundation of the
[1:47:10] world revelation 20:12 2:15 I saw the
[1:47:14] dead small and great stand before God
[1:47:16] and the books were opened and another
[1:47:18] book was opened which is the book of
[1:47:19] life and the dead were judged out of
[1:47:21] those things which are written in the
[1:47:23] books according to their works and the
[1:47:25] sea gave up the Dead which were in it
[1:47:27] and death and he'll but delivered up the
[1:47:28] Dead which were in them and they were
[1:47:30] judged every man according to
[1:47:32] works and death and he'll were cast into
[1:47:34] the lake of fire this is the second
[1:47:36] death many people don't even know
[1:47:38] there's a second death the first that is
[1:47:41] easy but every man that has died will be
[1:47:44] resurrected to be judged Oh hallelujah
[1:47:48] oh yeah tango tonight for the blood you
[1:47:52] thank God for Jesus pin and accept in
[1:47:55] your judgment and my judgment and take
[1:47:57] upon himself dying on the cross that we
[1:48:00] could go free tonight
[1:48:01] that's why you should worship Him that's
[1:48:04] why you should give Him praise that's
[1:48:06] why you should never come in the hopes
[1:48:08] of God with herself but the frong with
[1:48:11] any bad attitude or glory to God
[1:48:14] hallelujah you can see that door there
[1:48:20] are other books mentioned there is
[1:48:22] always the reference to one book
[1:48:24] container names it has caused the Lamb
[1:48:26] book of life or the book of life then
[1:48:30] where is this book located scripture
[1:48:33] looks ten seventeen to twenty four
[1:48:35] hundred centimeters with Joyce in Lord
[1:48:38] even the Devils are subject unto us
[1:48:40] should I name he selling them I beheld
[1:48:42] Satan as lightning fall from heaven
[1:48:44] behold I give you power to tread on
[1:48:46] serpents and scorpions and over all the
[1:48:48] power of the enemy and nothing shall by
[1:48:50] any means hurt you
[1:48:51] notwithstanding and this rejoice not
[1:48:53] that the spirits are subject unto you
[1:48:56] but rather rejoice because your name are
[1:48:59] written in heaven or glory the Gordon
[1:49:01] that always Jesus rejoice in the spirit
[1:49:04] and said I thank thee O Father Lord of
[1:49:06] Heaven and Earth that I was hid these
[1:49:08] things from the wise and the prudent and
[1:49:11] as we filled them unto babes such as
[1:49:14] well Alleluia
[1:49:15] even so father it seemed good in thy
[1:49:18] sight or give the Lord a shout
[1:49:20] hallelujah so this book of life is
[1:49:24] located in heaven and will appear the
[1:49:27] white throne judgment in these verses
[1:49:29] jesus said the names were written in
[1:49:31] heaven they were written in the book
[1:49:33] don't rejoice because they were subject
[1:49:35] unto you but rejoice because your name
[1:49:38] is in heaven that's why if you know your
[1:49:40] name is in heaven if you know your name
[1:49:42] as written
[1:49:43] every survey should be rejoicing just to
[1:49:46] have the opportunity do not worship in
[1:49:49] the beasts you're not worshipping some
[1:49:51] false prophet
[1:49:52] you're not worship in this world system
[1:49:54] or give the Lord a shout no wonder he
[1:49:57] said random seven thunders come forth
[1:50:00] then you'll be worshiping the Living
[1:50:01] Christ you're moving in and out among us

[1:50:14] God hallelujah praise God praise God no
[1:50:19] notice hallelujah
[1:50:21] Childress was one of those who were cast
[1:50:23] no Devils in Jesus name and we know that
[1:50:26] he was a devil son of perdition and
[1:50:28] Jesus said he that watcheth need not
[1:50:30] wash his feet but it's clean every whit
[1:50:32] but you are crema not all but you who
[1:50:35] would betray him therefore he said you

[1:50:46] up his heel him against me now if
[1:50:49] language means anything we must admit
[1:50:52] that Judas was chosen by Jesus yet he
[1:50:56] was not clean Oh glory to God hallelujah
[1:50:59] Judas was also given to Jesus by the
[1:51:03] father hallelujah notice that given is
[1:51:07] the exact parallel as the illustration
[1:51:10] of Moses and Pharaoh Jacob and Esau the
[1:51:12] east on Pharaoh a buzz for known they
[1:51:15] were predestinated a rat portable repres
[1:51:19] hallelujah and elect even to them but
[1:51:22] stumble at the word being disobedient

[1:51:29] ministry previous the Pentecost or glory

[1:52:15] numbered with us and an obtained part of
[1:52:17] this ministry

[1:52:21] twelve and then lost was neither
[1:52:23] inferior to the ministry of the other
[1:52:26] level no was it a devilish foreign
[1:52:29] ministry interjected among the ministry
[1:52:32] of the others so he was anointed and
[1:52:38] commissioned okay the Lord I shall do
[1:52:42] you feel like moving on tonight that he
[1:52:45] may take part in this ministry and
[1:52:47] Apostleship from which Judas by
[1:52:50] transgression fell that he might go to
[1:52:52] his own place
[1:52:52] Judas had ever lost a court given Holy
[1:52:57] Ghost ministry and kill themselves and
[1:52:59] went his own place his name was even in
[1:53:02] the book of life his name was blotted
[1:53:04] out there are four groups or glory the
[1:53:08] God you have to be identified with one
[1:53:10] you have to be connected at one there's
[1:53:12] a word pride that is wise version or
[1:53:15] glory to God as the foolish virgins
[1:53:17] second resurrection for that there are
[1:53:19] the people that are good that will get
[1:53:21] it to the life at the white throne
[1:53:22] judgment or glory to God and there are
[1:53:24] those names who was never in the book

[1:53:39] was put there I will get a lot of soap

[1:53:46] condition before your felon soon before

[1:54:11] great stand before God think about it on
[1:54:15] my you unholy gongs tonight you are
[1:54:19] privileged tonight all them people who
[1:54:22] never stand a chance some of them gone
[1:54:24] some of them wish they could reboot and
[1:54:25] kick and get out the hell and sit in
[1:54:28] church to say give me one more chance
[1:54:30] just one more chance give me another
[1:54:33] chance
[1:54:34] [Applause]
[1:54:38] just continue there will be both the
[1:54:46] righteous and the unrighteous in this
[1:54:49] judgment these righteous will not be the
[1:54:52] bride for the bride system and judgment
[1:54:57] stop rewind but over the mean the bride
[1:55:01] will be part of the judgment yes he have
[1:55:05] a scripted faith first corinthians 6:2
[1:55:07] two and three
[1:55:07] do you know the scenes adjust the world
[1:55:09] and if the world shall be judged by you
[1:55:12] are you unworthy to judge the smallest
[1:55:14] matters know you not that you shall
[1:55:17] judge angels how much more things that
[1:55:19] pertain to this life mother scripture
[1:55:23] relation 321 table overcometh will I
[1:55:25] grant to sit with me in my throne even
[1:55:27] as I overcame an Isetta what my father
[1:55:29] is strong see the bride is written in
[1:55:33] and strong and she is to judge the world
[1:55:36] she wants to be sitting in judgment
[1:55:39] that's what Daniel saw
[1:55:41] or glory to God hallelujah and he caught
[1:55:45] descriptively red I beheld until the
[1:55:48] trauma cast down and the angels of these
[1:55:50] did sit whose garment was white as snow
[1:55:53] or glory to God hallelujah so you are a
[1:55:58] big statement to make now only the bride
[1:56:01] alone qualifies for the first
[1:56:04] resurrection or glory of God bless her
[1:56:07] that day that comfort in the first
[1:56:09] resurrection only the bride all the
[1:56:14] bride electors go along in the ground
[1:56:16] they come into the first resurrection
[1:56:18] everybody has have to wait for the
[1:56:20] second resurrection but there's to be a
[1:56:22] little bride coming forth in the first
[1:56:25] resurrection all glory to God on you
[1:56:32] asleep
[1:56:33] okay the Lord a show he's not excited
[1:56:35] tonight is another exciting tonight
[1:56:38] there is going to be a resurrection oh
[1:56:43] Lord I want to be in that number when
[1:56:46] the saints call my champion or give the
[1:56:51] Lord a shout when the saints go marching
[1:56:54] in hallelujah hallelujah was continued
[1:56:59] the question now arises why are these
[1:57:04] righteous ones in judgment there is no
[1:57:07] other place they can come in but they
[1:57:09] are not - they are just for two
[1:57:11] resurrections and since they could not
[1:57:14] qualify for the first resurrection they
[1:57:18] must come in the second resurrection on
[1:57:20] the judgment so the second resurrection
[1:57:25] is a resurrection of the judgment not
[1:57:29] the first one because the bride already
[1:57:31] judged in Christ Jesus the bride will
[1:57:34] not be judged the bride cannot be judge
[1:57:37] she will be with the judge okay the Lord
[1:57:39] a shout
[1:57:41] is justified did you hear that
[1:57:46] the bride is justified as if she never
[1:57:50] did it in the first place hallelujah
[1:58:01] study Muslim beliefs and resurrection
[1:58:03] the ones who qualify for the first
[1:58:05] resurrection is the bride and I'm not in
[1:58:08] judgment and he could have scripted for
[1:58:10] at the back that up change and 524 fairy
[1:58:12] lights unto you he that heareth my voice
[1:58:14] i believe on him that sent me hath
[1:58:15] everlasting life which is I believe a
[1:58:18] recipient of eternal life he is a
[1:58:20] possession of it right now and shall not
[1:58:23] come into judgment hallelujah but is
[1:58:26] passed from death unto life
[1:58:28] so Jesus must have yet another in mind a
[1:58:32] certain resurrection will receive
[1:58:35] eternal life they will receive it at
[1:58:37] that resurrection not having previously
[1:58:40] as a member of the bride and to prove
[1:58:44] that he ever scripture for that John
[1:58:46] 5:22 29 marvel at this for the hour is
[1:58:51] coming this is Jesus in which all data
[1:58:54] in the graves shall hear his voice all
[1:58:57] all and shall come forth
[1:59:01] neither have done good unto the
[1:59:03] resurrection of life and they that have
[1:59:06] done evil unto the resurrection of
[1:59:07] damnation but all putting it at voice
[1:59:10] and to thankful to God tonight that you
[1:59:14] hearing the voice of God in the last
[1:59:16] days or glories of God you hear in his
[1:59:19] voice no you hear in a word of the
[1:59:21] Spirit
[1:59:22] no God speaking to you no because the
[1:59:25] electrons the ability to hear
[1:59:30] from Cork give the Lord a shout you I
[1:59:40] see you have the ability here from God
[1:59:45] or plural of God you are hearing from
[1:59:48] God tonight because God is the word
[1:59:51] unless you hear the word and receive the
[1:59:53] way again from God
[1:59:55] that's the ability like what put in the
[1:59:58] lake Alleluia
[2:00:00] we all know that John 5:20 that 29 is
[2:00:05] not the rapture I just have to be just
[2:00:07] read for only the dead in Christ shall
[2:00:10] arise on the graves at the time along
[2:00:12] with the Living bride who still sits on
[2:00:15] the earth let's read back the script
[2:00:16] that we just read Marvel not that this
[2:00:18] for the always coming which all that are
[2:00:21] in the graves shall hear his voice and
[2:00:23] shall come for deal of good on the
[2:00:25] resurrection of life till have done evil
[2:00:28] unto the resident damnation that's not a
[2:00:29] rupture the know the rapture the rapture
[2:00:32] is 1st Thessalonians 4 for the Lord
[2:00:35] Himself shuts in for me with a shout and
[2:00:38] the voice of the Archangel and with the
[2:00:41] Trump of God and the dead in Christ
[2:00:44] shall rise first and we wish our life
[2:00:47] and remain shall be caught up together
[2:00:50] with them in the clouds to meet the Lord
[2:00:53] in the air
[2:00:53] Oh hallelujah Amen hallelujah let me get
[2:01:03] a shot again because you wanna be caught
[2:01:07] up to meet him
[2:01:08] you are gonna be changed in a moment and
[2:01:12] I I believe that I'm gonna preach that
[2:01:16] oh praise God praise God hallelujah you
[2:01:22] may be seated we now face the question
[2:01:27] as to why this should be given eternal
[2:01:30] life at the judgment since the epistles
[2:01:35] seen the conclusively point out that one
[2:01:38] must possess the Spirit of Christ or
[2:01:41] perish though it seemed us we must not
[2:01:45] discredit the words of Jesus who most
[2:01:48] pointedly says forth that there are some
[2:01:51] found in the book of life who will
[2:01:54] either receive eternal life before the
[2:01:57] general direction or after it Paul does
[2:02:00] not evade this truth for it clearly says
[2:02:03] in Philippians 3 level it by any means I
[2:02:05] might attain the resurrection of the
[2:02:08] dead now this statement is very peculiar
[2:02:11] we all know and we are all going to be
[2:02:15] in a resurrection whether we want to be
[2:02:17] or not all will be resurrected
[2:02:20] so Paul could hardly be seen if by any
[2:02:24] means I might attain a resurrection of
[2:02:27] the dead the truth of the matter is he's
[2:02:29] not seeing that the literal realness if
[2:02:32] by any means I might attain to the out
[2:02:36] resurrection from among the dead this is
[2:02:40] not the opinion to the general or
[2:02:42] several second resurrection but attend
[2:02:44] to the first resurrection and which he
[2:02:46] said blessed and holy is he who had part
[2:02:49] in the first resurrection on such the
[2:02:51] second death no power or glory to God
[2:02:55] hallelujah praise God
[2:02:57] don't you feel inspired tonight all
[2:03:00] glory to God hallelujah
[2:03:02] hallelujah oh praise God let's continue
[2:03:05] he said no but they should I be like
[2:03:07] priests of God and Christ shall reign
[2:03:09] with him a thousand years the first
[2:03:11] resurrection has nothing to do with the
[2:03:13] second death that is at the end of a
[2:03:15] thousand years when all the rest of the
[2:03:17] Dead live again and in that day there
[2:03:19] will be those who come forward to
[2:03:20] eternal life and those others who are
[2:03:22] caught in the second death no we do not
[2:03:25] need to guess about those who were in
[2:03:27] the second resurrection are given life
[2:03:28] we are told it is given to them on the
[2:03:32] grounds that they are being kind and
[2:03:35] good to the Brethren this is something
[2:03:40] worthwhile noting a long time I've heard
[2:03:44] this but this is sometimes something
[2:03:45] with Van Noten we are told it is given
[2:03:49] to them underground they have been kind
[2:03:51] and good to the Brethren those who are
[2:03:53] raised and cast a lake of fire will be
[2:03:56] so treated because of their mistreatment
[2:03:58] of the bedroom or test the Lord I show
[2:04:01] which group are you in which group you
[2:04:05] will because um everybody's gonna be in
[2:04:07] a group everybody gets on a group Oh
[2:04:12] give the Lord a shout if you never heard
[2:04:14] that before just having it now Oh glory
[2:04:19] to God Amen hallelujah since this is the
[2:04:27] word of the Lord we simply accepted
[2:04:29] there is no argument here just a simple
[2:04:33] statement of fact we read the scripture
[2:04:36] when Jesus fasted eternal life he said
[2:04:39] when I was hungry you feed me when I was
[2:04:41] naked they clawed me and they said but
[2:04:43] when we do that he said when you do did
[2:04:45] little to little Lisa them you tease it
[2:04:47] on to me Oh hallelujah or glory to God
[2:04:52] hallelujah praise God the rest was the
[2:04:54] direct opposite let's continue the
[2:04:58] further clarify notice specifically go
[2:05:05] on I like that porn
[2:05:09] the words as Matthew 25:31 246 which is
[2:05:12] what we read it does not see that a
[2:05:15] shepherd is literally separating sheep
[2:05:17] from goats but it is as a shepherd
[2:05:20] dividing sheep from goats these are not
[2:05:23] sheep in this particular area of time
[2:05:25] why turn judgment the sheep are already
[2:05:27] in his fold they heard his voice they
[2:05:31] followed him they already have eternal
[2:05:33] life and he are not come into judgment
[2:05:35] but these do not have eternal life
[2:05:41] they are in judgment they are allowed to
[2:05:44] go into eternal life but upon what
[2:05:46] grounds to the enter into life eternal
[2:05:48] certainly not upon the fact that they
[2:05:50] already have this life as does the bride
[2:05:52] but they receive it because it was time
[2:05:55] to his brethren they are not his
[2:05:58] brethren that will make them join us
[2:06:00] with Jesus they are not asking anything
[2:06:03] but life they share not role except over
[2:06:07] him their names must have been in the
[2:06:10] book of life are not removed but because
[2:06:13] of the love of the people of God they
[2:06:16] are recognized and saved oh man so no
[2:06:21] you know who you are I know you know
[2:06:24] people gonna treat you based upon who
[2:06:25] you are I will be saved and receive
[2:06:28] eternal life because of who you are okay
[2:06:31] the Lord a shout it's the death know who
[2:06:33] you ask
[2:06:34] you better know who you are tonight Oh
[2:06:36] glory to God you are mrs. Jesus Christ
[2:06:39] okay the Lord I show scallywags in her
[2:06:42] somewhere he put your name on the book
[2:06:45] he said mark I thought to call you out
[2:06:47] [Applause]
[2:06:51] let's continue because of their love of
[2:06:55] the people of God they are recognized
[2:06:57] and save no doubt these save that help
[2:07:00] the chin of God perhaps like Nicodemus
[2:07:02] and Gamaliel they stood for the cheer in
[2:07:04] a time of trouble it's this seem smack
[2:07:07] of restoration watch carefully now for
[2:07:09] the wicked and not restored but tuned
[2:07:12] into the lake of fire the names of many
[2:07:15] of those destroyed within the book of
[2:07:17] life also but they were blotted out
[2:07:19] because they fail to honor the people of
[2:07:22] God who are the Living manifested word
[2:07:26] living epistle for their day oh you mean
[2:07:30] the bride could be the living manifested
[2:07:32] blood for this day your meal is that
[2:07:34] walking wrong with a book and escape and
[2:07:36] say what you believe but it has to be
[2:07:38] the winner
[2:07:39] living in the individual or give the
[2:07:42] Lord a shout seven living voices my god
[2:07:57] I believe that you know or you have to
[2:08:00] accept the other group if you don't want
[2:08:06] to accept that you have to become the
[2:08:08] Word made flesh then you have to find
[2:08:11] the next group you never said I know my
[2:08:12] group keeps spinning and see if you find
[2:08:14] a group it's only four it's not 24 you
[2:08:19] know just for so you could pick which
[2:08:22] one that's what they want I like that so
[2:08:25] which one now let's be clear here these
[2:08:30] are not Nations being judged and going
[2:08:32] to the Millennium because they have
[2:08:33] habit and at the Jews this is very clear
[2:08:36] because of the conclusion of these
[2:08:38] verses that these the wicked shall go
[2:08:40] into everlasting punishment but the
[2:08:42] righteous into everlasting life there is
[2:08:44] no record of two judgments set whether
[2:08:46] we get a cast on a lake of fire only the
[2:08:48] beast and the false prophet at the judge
[2:08:52] at the end of the Great Tribulation this
[2:08:55] is the white throne judgment and they
[2:08:58] are judged according to what's written
[2:09:00] in the book
[2:09:01] in the second recollection that's the
[2:09:03] souls under the altar that's in the
[2:09:06] fifth seal them coming second
[2:09:07] resurrection the carbonyl Lord voice how
[2:09:10] long Lord how long does not judge and
[2:09:12] avenge our blood these Jews under this
[2:09:13] altar we know that note particularly
[2:09:16] that none of these under the altar were
[2:09:18] killed for the testimony of Jesus they
[2:09:20] were not like Antipas who were slain for
[2:09:21] holiness fascist name these are not born
[2:09:23] again one but it's in life as their
[2:09:25] possession they come in the resurrection
[2:09:26] and receive life because of their stand
[2:09:29] on the word notice how these are crying
[2:09:32] for vengeance they cannot be bright
[2:09:34] material that speaks volume nail them
[2:09:45] Jewish Canon for vengeance
[2:09:46] he said Tecna back material so any
[2:09:48] person in this message sign of a
[2:09:50] vengeance you know we're on it you know
[2:09:51] who being right they're not in this
[2:09:54] bright group because the bride don't
[2:09:56] call for vengeance is mine saith the
[2:10:00] Lord I will repair the break Oh contact
[2:10:03] the bride will turn the other cheek give
[2:10:07] the Lord a show
[2:10:11] [Applause]
[2:10:15] [Music]
[2:10:25] the bright the bright
[2:10:28] turn-the-other-cheek they have to
[2:10:30] because they are they have to watch so
[2:10:33] these Jews aren't born of the Spirit
[2:10:35] they don't even believe that Jesus is
[2:10:36] Messiah but they were blinded by God for
[2:10:39] the Gentiles seek God gives them eternal
[2:10:41] life on the grounds that though they
[2:10:43] could not come to him they were truly
[2:10:45] faithful to all the world
[2:10:48] the new and died under Stalin and Hitler
[2:10:53] and yet they will die it is the second
[2:10:55] resurrection where in the five foolish
[2:10:57] virgins to come up oh my goodness this
[2:11:03] five foolish virgin immunization they
[2:11:09] not denomination let's continue they
[2:11:14] they did not have the Holy Spirit so
[2:11:17] they miss being the bride
[2:11:19] while the five wise who had oil became a
[2:11:22] part of that bride but these people
[2:11:25] being separated God loving people trying
[2:11:27] to abide in the world according to what
[2:11:29] they knew of it and I help in the work
[2:11:31] of the Lord will come at the end of time
[2:11:34] they will miss the millennium which you
[2:11:36] can begin to see by these truths is more
[2:11:39] important and wonderful than we ever
[2:11:41] taught I believe though that they here
[2:11:44] at this all I want to miss it that
[2:11:46] cumulative a big banking downstairs and
[2:11:48] you go at home to drink water and tom
[2:11:52] says have all seven course menu layout

[2:12:04] millennium honeymoon
[2:12:06] this is more wonderful he said then we
[2:12:09] could think or imagine you don't want to
[2:12:12] miss it
[2:12:12] which group pool in there or give the
[2:12:15] Lord a shot in the house
[2:12:17] hallelujah hallelujah don't be afraid
[2:12:21] that's an alligator
[2:12:22] glory to God you could imagine no when
[2:12:26] you hit that scripture his wife a kid is

[2:12:42] your worship oh my let's continue
[2:12:45] Oh glory to God hallelujah listen all
[2:12:50] these people are their names in the book
[2:12:52] of life and their names remain but whose
[2:12:54] names did not remain those of the world
[2:12:57] system churches who fought the bride
[2:13:01] will be tools whose names are removed
[2:13:04] that is who will lose out they will be
[2:13:07] cast into the lake of fire so let's go
[2:13:10] to another step
[2:13:11] he said let's review our case thus far
[2:13:13] let's review these four groups one first
[2:13:17] of all we know assuredly that the
[2:13:19] purpose of God stands in the election it
[2:13:21] was purposed in himself it was God's
[2:13:25] purpose to prefer to people like unto
[2:13:28] himself that would be a word bright so
[2:13:31] that break a missive for nothing because
[2:13:33] God purpose it that is God intent to
[2:13:37] have a word bright no Bishop could stop

[2:18:58] the book of life and their works written
[2:19:00] in the books these haven't failed to
[2:19:02] obey God being void of the Spirit - even
[2:19:06] the signs and wonders among them will
[2:19:07] have their names removed from the book
[2:19:10] of life among them could you find us
[2:19:12] entirely void of the Spirit religious
[2:19:14] will have manifestation in their lives

[2:20:59] [Applause]
[2:21:02] somebody must be wrong hallelujah maybe

[2:23:02] to good hallelujah yes a little more
[2:23:05] since this portion of the word is hard
[2:23:08] for the human matter grass all this
[2:23:14] profit is good oh my goodness is this
[2:23:17] this is good it must be accepted and
[2:23:20] believed by feet some will be offended
[2:23:23] by what I have set forth because they
[2:23:25] fail to understand the sovereignty of
[2:23:28] God which sets forth that God is God and
[2:23:31] because He is God one cannot defeat his
[2:23:34] concerts or thwart his will and purpose
[2:23:37] but he being omnipotent
[2:23:39] is ruling in all our fears and is doing
[2:23:42] whatever he will with all his creation
[2:23:45] because all were created for his good
[2:23:48] pleasure therefore Paul said if God
[2:23:51] should take one lump of P and make that
[2:23:54] seem love one vessel unto honor and
[2:23:56] another vessel unto dishonour who can be
[2:23:59] offended and cry against him that he has
[2:24:02] the right to do on the crumbs of
[2:24:05] creation alone we cannot deny yet he
[2:24:08] went even further according to Roman's
[2:24:10] 14 sin 9 we have the irrefutable proof
[2:24:13] that Jesus paid the purchase price of
[2:24:15] the whole world therefore you can do as
[2:24:18] you will with his own hallelujah and
[2:24:22] none of us liveth to himself
[2:24:24] Norman died himself but whether we live
[2:24:27] we live unto the Lord whether we die we
[2:24:29] die unto the Lord whether we live
[2:24:30] therefore or die we are the Lord's okay
[2:24:35] the Lord I show you are being purchased
[2:24:37] you are being bought with a price do you
[2:24:42] get that tonight you are not your own
[2:24:45] he paid for you listen listen when the
[2:24:53] angel crowd who is worthy who is worthy
[2:24:56] and no man was from worthy and the
[2:24:58] landscape thawed bloody bleeding he said
[2:25:00] I died for them I come for the book I
[2:25:02] pay the price I come to bring back this
[2:25:05] inheritance from the earth from my wife
[2:25:08] all glory of God you don't like a show
[2:25:10] tonight
[2:25:11] I can't restaurant tonight I can't
[2:25:13] worship tonight when the lamp broke the
[2:25:16] book no wonder John says all in heaven
[2:25:19] on the earth
[2:25:20] [Applause]
[2:25:22] Oh glory to God hallelujah
[2:25:25] we have enough crazy Wednesday night
[2:25:27] service tonight Oh Gloria tell somebody
[2:25:33] about it so listen is that this M Christ
[2:25:47] both died and rose and revived but he
[2:25:50] might be the Lord pour out the dead and
[2:25:53] the living
[2:25:54] yes yes revolution yeah he said
[2:25:57] ownership not relationship is meant Ian
[2:26:00] he is Lord over the river and the dead
[2:26:02] not relationship relationship with his
[2:26:05] bride
[2:26:05] but ownership over all that's all any
[2:26:08] speak every man-jack coming up all go be
[2:26:11] raised from the dead to be judged what
[2:26:14] proof I will be in or give the Lord a
[2:26:20] shout hallelujah hallelujah I'm almost
[2:26:25] done the quote Ephesians that's in the
[2:26:32] dispensation of the fullness of times he
[2:26:34] by Kara together in one all things in
[2:26:36] Christ both which have done even him in
[2:26:38] whom we are obtained inheritance being
[2:26:41] predestinated according to the purpose
[2:26:43] of him who worketh all things after the
[2:26:46] counsel of his own will thus if God so
[2:26:49] designed that there are those whose
[2:26:52] names are pleased in the section of the
[2:26:54] book of life that cannot be raised for
[2:26:57] the other names of his bride then we
[2:26:59] must accept it also states that there
[2:27:02] are those whose names are placed in the
[2:27:03] record but in the foreknowledge of God
[2:27:05] they were to fail and have those name
[2:27:07] removed we must accept that and if there
[2:27:10] are those who name up there was those
[2:27:12] whole names with never placed
[2:27:15] on the record we must accept that also
[2:27:19] Oh hallelujah
[2:27:21] or glory dub God my God my God
[2:27:33] let's continue to understand this
[2:27:36] subject raise a cup of it
[2:27:41] even more clearly it will be wise to
[2:27:46] approach it from the standpoint of the
[2:27:48] church through the ages remember
[2:27:50] sometime I'll talk about conversion and
[2:27:53] people do want to convert and digest
[2:27:55] again things literally if you go to
[2:27:57] Mexico you can't use TT dollars the
[2:28:00] other converted to pieces so if you want
[2:28:03] to build the house the materials called
[2:28:07] building materials but around call them
[2:28:10] virtues building materials if you want
[2:28:13] to go into the King's presence they
[2:28:15] become steps you're not building
[2:28:18] material on meet the king you have seven
[2:28:21] steps to go up to the king because he's
[2:28:23] only seven step isn't that right
[2:28:26] if you want to see to the edges you need
[2:28:28] eyes so all of a sudden you have seven
[2:28:30] eyes everyone changes here one seven
[2:28:33] horns so is the currency of the
[2:28:37] conversion to what effect that you want
[2:28:40] now you can't preach spirit to preach
[2:28:42] the world and it would tell in the
[2:28:44] spirit now there are three Bibles the
[2:28:47] zodiac this physical Bible in the
[2:28:48] pyramid but you're capricious Oriya you
[2:28:51] can't preach pyramid but you can preach
[2:28:52] it with and if this will come into you
[2:28:55] you have the pyramidal you you have to
[2:28:57] Bible or glory love God so brother
[2:29:01] Branham taking the book of life now and
[2:29:03] he bringing a different reference on a
[2:29:05] point to bring clarity for all what I
[2:29:07] said of these four groups are you ready
[2:29:10] just a little more again another finish
[2:29:12] let's go that's what yeah what is he now
[2:29:17] to understand this now we want to
[2:29:19] consider not even Fisher now but the
[2:29:21] groups represented in the church to do
[2:29:25] this we would like the church through
[2:29:27] the ages told
[2:29:28] plant a grain of wheat is planted to the
[2:29:31] end that a single grain of wheat will
[2:29:33] reproduce and multiply itself to a
[2:29:35] certain process and during a certain
[2:29:38] period of time that single seed will die
[2:29:39] and in time the light that was in it
[2:29:42] will come up into a plant which in turn
[2:29:44] will be the bearer or they carry of that
[2:29:46] life which is to come back to
[2:29:47] originality and multiplied form Jesus
[2:29:51] the great warrior see he died the
[2:29:53] massless one who is the life of the
[2:29:55] church stands in the midst of the church
[2:29:58] of all seven Church ages given his life
[2:30:01] to the church the carrier or the bearer
[2:30:04] to the end that this very life will be
[2:30:06] repetition bodies like unto his in the
[2:30:09] resurrection it is active resurrection
[2:30:11] that the Royall seed will see many royal
[2:30:14] seas that contain self so this is not
[2:30:16] really it the real glory will be ready
[2:30:19] at the resurrection where we shall see
[2:30:22] him like he is and we shall be like him
[2:30:24] okay the Lord I show this miserable
[2:30:28] fresh body I like him but in that
[2:30:30] resurrection we are going to be like him
[2:30:33] or give the Lord a shout glory to God
[2:30:38] this man put on immortality this
[2:30:41] corruption put on interruption and be a
[2:30:43] change or glory of God
[2:30:46] let's continue we shall be like him no
[2:30:49] that is what John the Baptist was
[2:30:52] referring to that Jesus will gather the
[2:30:54] wheat into his gonna that was the
[2:30:57] resurrection where the reteamed who had
[2:31:00] been elected to life came in know the
[2:31:04] record of this wheat plant here we go
[2:31:06] whose end is to reproduce the original
[2:31:08] seed in multi-platform is the book of
[2:31:11] life so he is converting it be holy
[2:31:15] plant
[2:31:15] gijin are you getting it is the book of
[2:31:18] life are you with me
[2:31:20] I repeat the history all record of this
[2:31:24] wheat plant is the book of life of which
[2:31:26] a path of the book of life is the record
[2:31:29] of eternal life
[2:31:29] a section of the book of life this is
[2:31:33] conventionally seen by examining the
[2:31:35] wheat plant a seed is sown
[2:31:38] sunna play the scene that is
[2:31:40] not to eat yet it grows into a stalk
[2:31:42] that is not a week yet life is dear but
[2:31:45] not to eat then at the end of the stalk
[2:31:47] is a little spike
[2:31:48] that's another tassel still our wheat
[2:31:50] plant but no bit yet
[2:31:52] then the plant is pollen eyes we see the
[2:31:54] child grow it looks mighty and the wheat
[2:31:57] but has not yet seed then forms a wheat
[2:31:59] in the husk it is now back to what is
[2:32:01] all originally know the ripen wheat is
[2:32:03] harvested Jesus died almost finish to
[2:32:06] bear with me and anybody sleeping just
[2:32:09] gave a big shock there's just no
[2:32:11] sleeping right now we're almost done all
[2:32:13] right
[2:32:13] so Jesus Christ died he give his life
[2:32:16] that life was to come back upon the
[2:32:18] church here we go and bring many sons
[2:32:20] like unto himself unto the glory in the
[2:32:23] resurrection but as the wheat seed have
[2:32:26] to have a carrier to bring forth
[2:32:29] multiplied with seed even so it had to
[2:32:31] be a church which would be a carrier of
[2:32:34] the life of Christ the blade stop tassel
[2:32:39] husk were the carriers for the seed but
[2:32:42] not to see the self so the church
[2:32:44] cooperate truly ages have been at area
[2:32:47] of the true seed told not to see the
[2:32:50] self that is why we can say the book of
[2:32:52] life is the whole wheat plant or just a
[2:32:56] lot of show till you catch it tonight
[2:32:59] let's go over it again here is the
[2:33:02] original seed that was planted it
[2:33:03] produces a bleed that wasn't it if it is
[2:33:05] a store not at either he had come husk
[2:33:07] we to form the tassel appears then the
[2:33:10] pollen falls on something on those
[2:33:12] pistols part of that plant is quickened
[2:33:14] something of the original seed came to
[2:33:17] the rest of the plant turns in the seed
[2:33:18] why didn't the whole pan go into seed
[2:33:22] because it was created to that end just
[2:33:26] part of that plant can go back to being
[2:33:29] seed because that path of the wheat
[2:33:32] plant is eternal life wheat
[2:33:39] do you see it all the other processes
[2:33:43] carriers but that part of come back to
[2:33:45] eat is the original grill that's the bad
[2:33:50] old Chloe don't cut
[2:33:53] he sent the Prophet the timer's back
[2:33:56] original faith the original seed the
[2:34:01] original light all let's finish off you
[2:34:04] know all glory to God he said you have a
[2:34:07] perfect type Israel even Egypt they came
[2:34:09] out two million strong all escaped the
[2:34:12] sacrificial blood all about ties on the
[2:34:14] Red Sea all came out of the water and
[2:34:15] join holy Smith manifestations all angel
[2:34:18] food all drunk of the rock yeah except
[2:34:20] for few they were not but carriers all
[2:34:26] Israel is not Israel all but a tiny
[2:34:29] minority and their names are blotted out
[2:34:31] of the book of life we have the same
[2:34:33] thing right in the church names are
[2:34:36] going to be blotted out of the book of
[2:34:38] life
[2:34:38] no names will be blood another book of
[2:34:41] the eternal life for that is another
[2:34:43] record that contained in the book this
[2:34:46] is the record God had given us eternal
[2:34:48] life and that life is in his son he's
[2:34:51] hot the Sun hot the life oh my god
[2:34:54] breaking you could come oh my you're
[2:34:57] being a tremendous audience tonight you
[2:35:00] applaud my mind I thought this might be
[2:35:03] too much for tonight but praise God
[2:35:06] praise God praise God hallelujah
[2:35:09] in concluding in concluding this for
[2:35:12] this time let me put the statement that
[2:35:15] I made in the beginning when I said that
[2:35:18] not one scripture spoke of the Lord
[2:35:19] presently compiling a record of names
[2:35:22] that is indeed so Oh hallelujah
[2:35:26] oh my talk about a roll call he said the
[2:35:29] rapture is not the only roll call the
[2:35:31] rapture will be a roll call
[2:35:33] Oh glory to God I waitin to hear that
[2:35:36] voice Oh glory
[2:35:38] when he speaks you can take their advice
[2:35:42] or glory no good be shocked about Oh
[2:35:47] hallelujah
[2:35:49] Oh glory to God a man or my mind my mind
[2:35:54] the rapture is not the only world called
[2:35:56] there's a second resurrection of the
[2:35:58] white throne judgment will namesti
[2:36:00] confess before the fallen angels and
[2:36:01] I've been told by those who know that
[2:36:04] the sweetest song to a human ear is the
[2:36:07] song of that person's name how people
[2:36:09] love to have their names before the
[2:36:11] public how they love a clean but no
[2:36:13] earthly voice will ever strong your name
[2:36:15] as sweetly as well the voice of God if
[2:36:18] your name is in the book of life and
[2:36:21] remains there to be revealed before
[2:36:24] these holy angels what a day that will
[2:36:27] be when we are Jesus a father they
[2:36:30] confess my name before men in the days
[2:36:32] of the earthly pilgrimage no I will
[2:36:35] confess their names before thee and all
[2:36:37] the heavenly angels he that hath an ear
[2:36:39] let him hear what the Spirit says to the
[2:36:42] churches
[2:36:42] once more the Spirit has spoken once
[2:36:46] again we have reviewed a record of what
[2:36:48] the Spirit set another age and we have
[2:36:50] found the record correct another age has
[2:36:53] gone by it must fulfill exactly as he
[2:36:55] said it would be what a consolation that
[2:36:57] is to us who hope to be in the last day
[2:36:59] bright for it causes our hearts to leap
[2:37:02] for joy that he is faithful and will
[2:37:04] perform every promise if he was faithful
[2:37:07] and true the toes in his audition age
[2:37:09] then he will be just as true now age if
[2:37:12] they're by His grace and power will
[2:37:13] receive the commandment by him so will
[2:37:15] we let us go therefore to perfection and
[2:37:17] meet the Lord in the air and we forever
[2:37:19] be with him let's all stand
