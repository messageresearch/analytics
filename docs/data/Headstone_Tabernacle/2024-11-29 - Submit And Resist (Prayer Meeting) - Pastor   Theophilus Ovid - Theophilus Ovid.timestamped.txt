[12:20] prayer welcome tonight Heavenly Father
[12:22] we thank you for your presence and we
[12:24] thank you for this tremendous
[12:25] opportunity that we in this age of
[12:28] overload of knowledge overload of
[12:30] information we could still find this
[12:32] space of rest this place where we could
[12:35] come and hide in the Cliff of the rock
[12:37] where we could be covered in your shadow
[12:39] of under the shadow of the almighty and
[12:41] we could get peace with you and a
[12:43] connection with you and a relation with
[12:45] you father God speak to us tonight this
[12:48] exaltation and as the people get on in
[12:50] prayer may the anointing be with them to
[12:52] inspire them and direct them granted God
[12:55] I commit this session into your hands in
[12:58] jesm I ask it amen and amen God bless
[13:01] you and it's a blessing to be here
[13:04] tonight now if you have your Bibles I
[13:06] like you to turn to James chapter 4 we
[13:10] want to read from 7 to 10 James chapter
[13:13] 4 reading from 7 to 10 the title that I
[13:17] have for tonight's exaltation is submit
[13:20] and resist and it comes right out of
[13:22] James chapter 4 now remember I've said
[13:25] it before many years over the years we
[13:28] don't throw words for people if we have
[13:30] to tell you something that you need to
[13:31] know we will tell you it personally we
[13:34] don't ever use a Pulpit to throw words
[13:36] like we don't know what to say and we're
[13:37] waiting to get the pulpit to beat you in
[13:39] a corner or to say and through things we
[13:42] have never been into that if I have to
[13:44] tell you something I'll tell it to your
[13:45] face I'll tell you direct we don't have
[13:47] to beat around and use the pulpit as a
[13:49] Pulpit a bully pulpit to bully anyone
[13:51] the pulpit as far as I see and this time
[13:54] session is to exal and to speak on the
[13:56] word because the word have life I don't
[13:58] have life the word have life Jesus have
[14:01] life so when we hear the word we could
[14:02] draw from the word and get strength if
[14:04] you are weak tonight the word could give
[14:06] you strength if you're low tonight
[14:08] you're sick tonight the word could heal
[14:10] you the word itself is what God released
[14:12] unto us to have power so James 4 and
[14:15] this is what we're about to read is the
[14:17] word verse seven said submit yourselves
[14:21] therefore to God so I have a one under
[14:24] submit resist the devil and he will flee
[14:27] to you that would resist that comes
[14:30] number two draw nigh to God and He will
[14:33] draw nigh to you draw nigh becomes
[14:35] number three cleanse your hands ye
[14:39] Sinners and purify your hearts he
[14:41] double-minded we have a for and cleanse
[14:43] your hands be afflicted five and mourn
[14:48] six and weep seven let your laughter be
[14:52] turned into mourning and your joy to
[14:56] heaviness and you have up to eight
[14:58] humble yourselves in the sight of the
[15:01] Lord and He Shall lift you up so if you
[15:03] reason in the order that we stated you
[15:05] have submit resist draw nigh cleanse
[15:08] your hands be afflicted mourn weep
[15:12] humble
[15:14] yourselves now in the Amplified it says
[15:17] this be subject to God resist the devil
[15:20] stand firm against him and he will flee
[15:22] from you come close to God and he will
[15:25] come close to you recognize that you are
[15:28] sinners
[15:29] get your so Hands Clean realize that you
[15:33] have been disloyal wavering individuals
[15:36] with divided interest and purify your
[15:39] hearts of your spiritual adultery as you
[15:42] drain near To God Be deeply penitent and
[15:45] grieve even weep over your disloyalty
[15:48] let your laughter be turned to grief and
[15:50] your merth to dejection and heartfelt
[15:53] shame for your sins humble yourselves
[15:57] feeling very and this humbly yourself is
[16:00] feeling very insignificant in the
[16:02] presence of the Lord and He will exalt
[16:05] you he will lift you up and make your
[16:08] lives
[16:09] significant okay let's go a question and
[16:12] answers here but Bram I am saved I've
[16:16] been baptized in the name of Jesus
[16:18] Christ but how do I get away from a
[16:22] stolen spirit that I can't seem to break
[16:25] away from answer well my Christian
[16:29] brother or sister whoever it may be now
[16:33] most times when you find people that got
[16:36] stubborn Spirits it is usually a complex
[16:40] that causes this either they have
[16:42] inherited from father mother Uncle an
[16:45] grandmother grandfather somebody like
[16:47] that and if you trace back down to your
[16:50] life you I have taken this by experience
[16:53] and the discernment because I have met
[16:55] cases on the platform thousands of those
[16:58] that had that Spirit and the first thing
[17:00] you know I will chase that Spirit right
[17:04] back by discernment and find that
[17:08] there's a granddaddy or there was a
[17:10] grandmother there was somebody else back
[17:12] down there and you inherit that by
[17:16] Nature stubborn stubbornness is not of
[17:20] God and now the only way to get away
[17:25] from that is to have you have to have
[17:28] faith
[17:29] to overcome that let me repeat that
[17:32] stubbornness is not of God and now the
[17:36] only way to get away from that you have
[17:40] to have faith to overcome that you are a
[17:44] Christian you are son and daughter of
[17:47] God whichever you may be and you will
[17:51] never be able just to stand and rebuke
[17:54] it and rebuke it and rebuke it it is
[17:57] just like tent in a rattlesnake he is
[18:00] laying there ready to bite you and if
[18:03] you just ignore him and walk away from
[18:07] him he can't hurt you so when you feel
[18:12] that you got a stubborn Spirit lay the
[18:15] thing on the Altar and
[18:19] believe God that the thing is dead and
[18:23] you will never have it no more and go on
[18:26] and don't even pay any attention to it
[18:29] no more and the thing will leave you
[18:33] resist the devil he will flee from you
[18:37] that is get away quickly so that would
[18:40] be my advice how to overcome it we
[18:45] overcome the Devil by faith that is what
[18:49] we overcome all all evil by is by faith
[18:53] so I hope that that question and answer
[18:55] would help you tonight and realize there
[18:58] are more depth in the word and more
[19:02] depth by the spirit of discernment that
[19:04] we think of and this is a good example
[19:07] because brother BR himself he dealt with
[19:09] these cases by the thousands and could
[19:12] trace them back and see the effect upon
[19:14] the lives of the people so sometime you
[19:16] may be in stuff or whatever and it's
[19:19] something that is dear but you have to
[19:21] know to lay things down you have to know
[19:23] how to walk away from stuff if you
[19:25] haven't listened to the message from
[19:26] Wednesday night I want to encourage you
[19:27] to do so the high priest of your
[19:30] confession because the prophet clearly
[19:32] states you cannot live about above your
[19:35] confession so if you're talking negative
[19:37] talking a set of foolishness about your
[19:38] own self you can't get very far if you
[19:41] say a low a d I ain't going good and
[19:44] whatnot you're talking a devil's
[19:46] language you have to begin to apply and
[19:49] get stronger you have to begin to apply
[19:51] your faith and get muscles you have to
[19:55] begin to do that because God want us to
[19:58] exit ex our fa that we could be built up
[20:01] God don't want with baby Fai you know it
[20:03] come like um a parent was saying you
[20:06] know the child in a lower form form one
[20:08] or standard one um will make small
[20:11] sentences but as they get older you
[20:14] don't want to make those baby sentences
[20:16] they have to begin to grow to make more
[20:18] complex sentences and they have to get
[20:20] the help necessary they have to get the
[20:22] books to read they have to get the
[20:24] understanding that you cannot make come
[20:26] John come and and you know here go Jane
[20:29] and whatnot that could work in standard
[20:31] one but standard four and standard five
[20:34] those baby sentences can no longer work
[20:36] so you have to be able to expand so the
[20:38] the Christian experien is what we had in
[20:41] the early years we have to be stronger
[20:44] now and the only way it could be done is
[20:46] if we get into the practice into the
[20:49] exercise into the push-ups into the
[20:51] lifting the bar which have to be
[20:53] stronger than you to put some pressure
[20:54] on your muscles that's the only way in
[20:56] other words pressure and stress is he
[20:58] help us to exercise our faith what is
[21:01] happening people are not exercising
[21:03] their faith they're letting you know the
[21:05] pressure just take them and crush on it
[21:07] so I trust and that is with help you
[21:08] tonight I want to encourage you to
[21:10] listen back to that message on Wednesday
[21:12] night okay let's continue what you can't
[21:15] have life only to Christ so time going
[21:18] there you can't have life only to Christ
[21:21] but now what does his word do here we go
[21:25] it builds up our spiritual body
[21:30] strong as we commune with him to resist
[21:34] the devil so what is he saying here we
[21:37] have to actually learn and become strong
[21:41] in order to resist the devil now I like
[21:44] how the words were phrased in the
[21:46] scripture the first thing the Bible exal
[21:49] is to submit
[21:51] yourself what is this going
[21:54] in okay here what it says here first
[21:57] thing submit yourselves therefore to God
[22:01] and then it said resist the devil
[22:03] because if you want to resist the devil
[22:05] and I read the scripture for you some
[22:07] guys trying to cast out devils and do
[22:08] their own stuff and they not submitted
[22:10] to God we call them jokers and devil
[22:13] jump on them so you cannot try to
[22:17] pulverize the devil overcome the devil
[22:20] and do whatever you think with that
[22:21] devil and you're not in submission to
[22:23] God so the first thing is to ask
[22:26] yourself am I submitted
[22:28] do you know what submission is because
[22:31] you have to be able to submit yourself
[22:33] and humble yourself all right let's
[22:35] continue so brother Bram says here now
[22:37] yes he's the
[22:39] word communion in the beginning was the
[22:42] word the word was with God the Word was
[22:44] God then his body is his word because
[22:46] he's the word and if you abide in me and
[22:49] my communion my word abides in you so in
[22:51] other words your connection with the
[22:53] word give you the strength to build up a
[22:56] strong spiritual body you see how we
[22:59] take tablets zinc and magnesium and and
[23:02] and one a day and and iron and and
[23:05] whatever we take we taking those things
[23:07] to help our body our Natural Body our
[23:10] physical body especially as we get older
[23:12] we want to know that we you know have
[23:14] all the right nutrients and stuff well
[23:16] same similarly in the spiritual realm we
[23:19] have to have the nutrients that give us
[23:21] the strength to stand in this hour so
[23:23] you say we are taught brother Bram to
[23:25] resist the devil he will free from us
[23:28] not to resist is just simply to turn him
[23:30] down just resist him just walk away from
[23:33] it God said a certain thing no matter
[23:36] what he's trying to tell you don't even
[23:38] listen to him you have cars that you are
[23:41] ears that are death to anything else but
[23:42] what the spirit says amen so praise God
[23:45] so listen to submit means to
[23:49] yield to surrender something for
[23:53] consideration Authority or judgment so
[23:56] depend depending upon what is you get a
[23:59] different context of submission so to
[24:04] Authority willing to yield to authority
[24:07] of
[24:08] another to present something which is to
[24:10] submit is a submit like a presentation
[24:13] for approval or submit a document for
[24:16] approval right so therefore in submit
[24:19] means to acknowledge superiority or
[24:21] decision of another that is what is to
[24:23] submit to submit is also to surrender
[24:26] One Life to divine power God's power to
[24:30] Divine Authority now to resist means to
[24:34] oppose to withstand to strive against
[24:38] something it it means pushing back
[24:40] against like a force pushing back
[24:43] against influence pushing back against
[24:45] Temptation if you are not pushing back
[24:48] you're not resisting I repeat if you are
[24:52] not pushing back you are not resisting
[24:55] if you are not pushing back on
[24:57] influences whether family worthy friends
[24:59] workers or whatever it is you are not
[25:02] resisting you're just playing slide
[25:05] you're just going with the crowd you
[25:07] don't want to hurt nobody you don't want
[25:08] to offend nobody it come like if the the
[25:11] office says we having a small drink and
[25:13] you're not resisting and say I'm a
[25:14] Christian I don't drink if you say that
[25:16] all right they know you have a clear
[25:18] stand if he says nothing they will pass
[25:21] you a glass and you may just sip it you
[25:23] know and whatnot you're not resisting so
[25:27] again like submit that have context so
[25:31] so to fight against something physically
[25:34] or mentally to fight against Temptation
[25:37] or influences to fight against Authority
[25:41] or rules that resistant to withstand
[25:44] something that is harmful that is
[25:45] resistance but and this is a scripture I
[25:48] have here and this is where they were
[25:51] trying to get stuff without submission
[25:52] these guys and this from Acts 19 11 to
[25:55] 17 we're going to read how much time and
[25:58] and God wrot special Miracles by the
[26:03] hands of Paul so that his body were
[26:06] brought into the with unto the sick unto
[26:09] the sick hand cchs or aprons and the
[26:11] diseases departed from them and the evil
[26:14] spirits went out of them then certain of
[26:17] the vagabon Jews exorsist took upon them
[26:21] to call over them which had evil spirits
[26:23] in the name of the Lord Jesus so they
[26:25] want Power they want influence they want
[26:27] show off they want to play theel so they
[26:31] had they start to call on evil spirits
[26:34] in the name of the Lord Jesus saying we
[26:36] are JY by Jesus whom Paul preaching they
[26:39] not
[26:40] preaching is what Paul preaching they
[26:42] want to work something there and there
[26:45] were seven sons of one ska a Jew and
[26:50] chief of the priest which did so and the
[26:53] evil spirit answered and said Jesus I
[26:57] know
[26:58] Paul I know but who are ye and the man
[27:03] in whom the evil spirit was leaped on
[27:07] them overcame them and prevailed against
[27:10] them so they fled out of that house
[27:12] naked and wounded so the spirit get them
[27:15] a good licking the spirit they trying to
[27:18] cast out jump on them and handle them
[27:21] and the verse 17 says and this was known
[27:24] to all the Jews and Greeks also dwelling
[27:26] at Ephesus and fear fell on them all and
[27:31] the name of the Lord Jesus was married
[27:33] oh let's continue almost done Hebrews
[27:36] 13:17 says obey them that have the rule
[27:40] over you and submit yourselves there are
[27:44] so many Christian and so many people
[27:46] don't want to submit theirself they
[27:48] don't want to submit yourself to order
[27:50] to church order they don't want to sub
[27:53] to the pulpit to the ministry they
[27:56] running their own show they are private
[28:00] operators with their own Revelations and
[28:02] so on they will get burned you you will
[28:05] get burned not they you inside of here
[28:06] who want to operate like that you'll get
[28:08] burned because the ministry is not
[28:11] opposed go didn't put a minister or a
[28:13] pastor there as just like a decoration
[28:16] or like a picture on a wall you put him
[28:19] there as a Watchman to watch over your
[28:21] souls and the Bible speak that listen to
[28:23] this obey them that have the rule over
[28:26] you and
[28:29] yourselves not just to obey but to
[28:32] submit for they watch for your souls as
[28:37] they that must give account that they
[28:41] may do it with joy and not with grief
[28:44] for that is unprofitable for you so in
[28:47] other words when God is to call the
[28:50] ministry to give an account of
[28:52] you trust is a good one it's a good
[28:55] report let's read that in the amplifier
[28:58] obey your spiritual
[29:01] leaders and submit to
[29:03] them and this is what they have in the
[29:05] applified
[29:07] continually recognizing their authority
[29:11] over you you see this here this is
[29:14] problematic there are so many Christians
[29:17] don't want to recognize
[29:19] authority authority over them and I
[29:22] could read for you where the Bible exort
[29:25] us to submit to the author ities natural
[29:29] authorities judges you watch your red
[29:31] light and says I feeling led to stop no
[29:34] red light who put that red light day is
[29:36] man put that red light and I obeying man
[29:39] and yeah you break the red light and you
[29:41] get in an accident you got a ticket
[29:42] charge you might even kill somebody in a
[29:44] car accident and whatnot because of your
[29:45] foolishness but the Bible said to submit
[29:48] why there are rules and orders to
[29:50] protect Christians that judges the there
[29:52] for until Ro make the move until the
[29:55] Press come down until all the dramas had
[29:57] to take place that a different thing
[29:58] then we have to resist but as for now
[30:01] what the Bible put over us is to submit
[30:04] ourselves even to the authorities so
[30:06] obey your spiritual leaders submit to
[30:09] them continually recognizing the
[30:11] authority over you this appli to wise
[30:13] too wise who bullheaded and don't want
[30:15] to listen to their husband and figure
[30:16] but they running their own show or
[30:18] whatnot God asking you no question you
[30:20] know God will ask the man or the husband
[30:23] the questions so he have to know what he
[30:25] will give an answer over on a bullhead
[30:28] or a wife who don't want to submit or
[30:30] take the husband leadership and you
[30:32] husbands you have to know where you're
[30:34] taking your wies but if you're not a
[30:35] leader or you don't get empowerment to
[30:38] lead what you're leading them onto all
[30:40] right so I don't mean to go there
[30:41] tonight but just going about Authority
[30:44] so recognizing the authority over you
[30:46] for they are constantly keeping watch
[30:47] over your souls and guarding your
[30:51] spiritual welfare as men who will have
[30:54] to render an account of their trust do
[30:57] your part let them do this with gladness
[31:01] and not with sign and groaning for that
[31:03] would not be Prof for you you ask some
[31:05] that question about this person oh God
[31:07] you're grown because a report not so
[31:11] good Titus 31 says put them in mind to
[31:14] be subject to principalities and powers
[31:16] to OB magistrates and to be ready for
[31:19] every good work and the last scripture I
[31:22] have here wow almost that scripture big
[31:26] scripture it says this here
[31:29] 1 Peter
[31:30] 55 likewise he
[31:33] younger submit yourselves unto the Elder
[31:36] see the spirit quality not a young
[31:38] person carrying on and their resp no
[31:40] senior person that is that is not right
[31:44] y all of you be subject one to another
[31:48] be clothed with humility for God or God
[31:52] has resist to you know he resist the
[31:54] proud and give grace to the humble so
[31:57] God do actually push back be proud you
[31:59] proud he will fight you he will push you
[32:02] back he will disappoint you he will
[32:04] shame you because of your
[32:07] pride I wish I could hear some amens I
[32:09] can't hear no amens I can't hear
[32:11] anything is a one traffic a one way
[32:13] thing here tonight God do resist the
[32:16] proud and give grace to the humble
[32:19] humble yourself therefore under the
[32:22] mighty hand of God that he may exalt you
[32:25] in due time and this in the this is the
[32:28] last quote we have here likewise you who
[32:30] are younger and of lesser rank be
[32:34] subject to the elders you see this so
[32:38] when you want to compete or there are
[32:40] competitors who figure you're at the
[32:41] same level and whatnot you're deceiving
[32:43] your own self that is a level of
[32:44] self-deception God have Rank and God
[32:47] have order and structure he doesn't have
[32:50] the moon Fe left to be the brightest
[32:52] thing in in the sky the sun will St in
[32:56] the day the moon had to St in the night
[32:58] God have things set up that way and we
[33:00] can't change that so he said likewise
[33:02] you are younger and of lesser rank be
[33:06] subject to the elders the ministers the
[33:09] spiritual Guides of the church giv them
[33:12] due respect and yielding to their
[33:16] counsel clothe or apron yourselves all
[33:20] of you with humility as the G of a
[33:23] servant so that its covering cannot
[33:26] possibly be stripped from you with
[33:29] freedom from Pride oh I feel good about
[33:30] that tonight with freedom from pride and
[33:33] arrogance towards one another but God
[33:36] sets himself against the proud the
[33:39] insolent the overbearing the disdainful
[33:41] the presumptuous the boastful he opposes
[33:45] frustrates and defeats them but gives
[33:48] grace and favor to the humble therefore
[33:51] humble yourselves demote lower
[33:54] yourselves in your own estimation under
[33:57] the might hand of God that in due time
[34:01] he may exalt you so God call us to
[34:03] submit and to resist you will be a weak
[34:07] Christian and stay a weak Christian if
[34:09] you find yourself devil beating you up
[34:12] there's no resisting power and is
[34:15] because you're not really submitting you
[34:17] are saying pray for me but you are not
[34:20] willing to submit yourself what you need
[34:22] is a inoculation of the Holy Ghost when
[34:25] the nurse come in the needle or the
[34:27] doctor come with the needle or the
[34:29] pastor come with the needle you fly out
[34:30] the room because the needle get you
[34:33] frightened but what the needle has is a
[34:35] inoculation against sin and to
[34:38] strengthen whatever white Capel or
[34:41] whatever blood cells to fight the
[34:42] disease that is what that is for so the
[34:45] holy ghost or the baptism of the Holy
[34:47] Ghost is supposed to be a inoculation
[34:50] that gives you a greater sense of
[34:51] resistance against the enemy now we all
[34:53] born in CIP iniquity we are finished to
[34:56] begin with we don't stand a chance
[34:58] but God rich in Mercy give us this
[35:00] opportunity to say by I'm heal let the
[35:02] we say I'm strong to be empowered to be
[35:05] effective ow you have to clear grounds
[35:08] you cannot say I am weak you cannot say
[35:11] I'm struggling what is that what is that
[35:14] if people in Ukraine under bombs and
[35:17] right now I hear over a million people
[35:19] have no current do you Trinidad because
[35:21] Russia P some missil on them and and
[35:23] blow up the all the what leg thing and
[35:26] they have no current and right it's win
[35:28] time across the just in case you don't
[35:30] know it's win time you we have rain a
[35:32] rainfall and people B like going drunk
[35:34] but they have winter time across it real
[35:36] cold so I'm saying then in the world
[35:38] today from another perspective people
[35:41] seeing great Horrors we don't have that
[35:44] we have ly laziness laia have need of
[35:48] nothing throw and all of that and go
[35:51] trying to knock that off in order you
[35:53] could access him draw nigh unto me I
[35:56] will draw nigh onto you you resist the
[35:58] devil and he not going to walk away he
[36:01] will flee flee is the bolt but if he not
[36:05] getting no resistance he figure he could
[36:06] come nearer he could figure you could
[36:08] you could give him a cup of coffee and
[36:09] all if he ask to make one because you
[36:11] not resisting him you an encouraging him
[36:14] just now his his coffee and
[36:16] cake so so so so you have to show God
[36:20] that you mean business you have to show
[36:22] God that you really want this reality
[36:24] you not want to say God help me now oh
[36:27] God help you can't pray because you're
[36:29] lazy you can't pray because you don't
[36:30] want to repent you can't pray because
[36:31] you're proud it take humility to say I
[36:34] need help I want to repeat that it it
[36:38] takes humility to say I'm sorry it takes
[36:42] humility to say help me it takes
[36:45] humility to say I really don't know what
[36:47] I'm supposed to do would you pray that
[36:51] God send get his mind that I could know
[36:53] it it takes humility to admit that
[36:56] you're wrong and you're off
[36:59] people don't talk that they like to talk
[37:01] Mountain Top talk on top the mountain uh
[37:04] to bless to be stressed all the
[37:06] catchphrases and whatnot and that is
[37:07] irrelevant into the kingdom of the devil
[37:09] working day laughing at all of that
[37:12] because you're
[37:13] stressed you're stressed because you're
[37:15] not submitting you're stressed because
[37:17] you're not overcoming but overcoming
[37:19] keeps life in you and I'm no big of
[37:22] drama you know you have to overcome in
[37:23] Little Things the big things coming to
[37:25] overcome but you have to start somewhere
[37:28] start on new stop criticizing others
[37:31] stop trying to pull down others stop
[37:33] blaming others and begin to deal with
[37:35] you look in the mirror of the word and
[37:37] ask yourself am I seeing the writing to
[37:40] my husband to my children to the worker
[37:42] to my neighbor to Brethren am I being
[37:45] negative there are some people are
[37:47] negative Bas so they will always see
[37:49] half empty next person positive Bas say
[37:51] the class are full and you'll always get
[37:53] that coming out of the lips of the mouth
[37:55] what are you saying what are you telling
[37:57] yourself what are you asking yourself
[38:00] you trying to hurt you or trying to help
[38:01] you you trying to bring you down or you
[38:03] trying to pull you off trying to beat
[38:05] you or we trying to take authority over
[38:06] you what is our objective what is our
[38:10] motive what is my motive tonight of
[38:12] sharing these things with you submit and
[38:14] resist resist the devil he shall flee if
[38:16] he flee it he may come back you know but
[38:18] he flee might take off like a bullet you
[38:20] got
[38:21] space but some of you not
[38:24] resisting you need to submit you need to
[38:27] surrender you need to put up your hand
[38:29] and say I surrender you see when you're
[38:31] under war and pressure and you prob the
[38:33] White Flag it means you give up you have
[38:36] to put up the white flag and say Lord I
[38:38] commit my life into their hands I give
[38:39] up I try I fail I fail miserably but now
[38:43] I'm surrendering to you lead me and
[38:45] guide me let's bow our heads heavenly
[38:46] father I thank you
[38:48] tonight God for this word your word is
[38:51] real you said cleanse your hands you
[38:54] said submit yourself you said resist to
[38:56] death you said cry you said weep mourn
[39:01] humble yourself God may this be us
[39:03] tonight nobody else in our room in all
[39:07] space we want to apply this word to our
[39:09] hearts and and may it come out right we
[39:12] want to admit how much we need you we
[39:14] need your leadership we need your
[39:15] guidance we need Humble Hearts Lord
[39:18] strip us of ourselves I commit this time
[39:21] of prayer into your hands May the
[39:23] anointing fill the homes of your people
[39:26] may anointing fill their minds and their
[39:28] lives God I shared with them concerning
[39:31] stubbornness and certain traits that we
[39:33] have and brother BR he said you can't
[39:36] rebuke it rebuke it rebuke it it's not
[39:38] going to work that way so some some of
[39:41] the stuff we have to deal with takes a
[39:43] different approach help us Lord to have
[39:45] that mindset that will adjust our
[39:48] thinking and submit what has been
[39:50] revealed this last day as to how to deal
[39:53] with our own individual cases bless them
[39:56] open up to Minds give them Revelation
[39:59] vision and inspiration that this word is
[40:01] true this word is real and this would
[40:03] have power granted God in Jesus I ask it
[40:06] heal the sick in our midst strengthen
[40:08] the feeble needes those that need to
[40:10] speak right Inspire them tonight in
[40:12] their prayer that they will say the
[40:14] right thing don't talk about they weak
[40:16] don't talk about their struggles but say

[40:19] going to make a way I'm going to be
[40:21] strengthened I'm going to exercise my
[40:23] faith May begin tonight to the hearts

[40:27] ask it amen and amen so God bless you
[40:29] Saints I trust them that these few words
[40:31] would be an encouragement to you and
[40:34] that it will inspire you as they get
[40:35] down in prayer that God will truly speak
[40:37] to your heart so God bless you as we get
[40:40] down in prayer praise the Lord
