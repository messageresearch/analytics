[39:43] [Music]
[39:44] we do search in the name of the Lord
[39:46] Jesus Christ a little bit please for
[39:49] time the pastor wanted to come up at a
[39:51] certain time
[39:52] and we know we're expecting some load
[39:54] shedding so we just want to try and
[39:56] manage that transition uh
[39:59] maybe ever see it before before we call
[40:02] up the special Minister today
[40:10] we want to thank God just for for this
[40:12] privilege and honor that we are able to
[40:14] be gathered in this fashion
[40:16] and just before the pastor comes up
[40:19] we've got a list of visitors here that
[40:21] the deacons gave me
[40:22] so we just want to welcome I think it
[40:25] feels like a convention
[40:27] because we've got people from far and
[40:30] white yes
[40:35] amen
[40:36] so we know the way from Durban South
[40:39] Africa

[48:14] second Peter 1 4 2 7.
[48:21] I'll explain you this nice suit I got on
[48:24] what happened

[48:31] the suit I'm sending Jesus gave it to me
[48:35] wow
[48:38] x18
[48:40] but he shall receive power after the
[48:43] Holy Ghost has come upon you and he
[48:45] shall be Witnesses unto me both in
[48:47] Jerusalem and in all Judea in Samaria
[48:50] and unto the utmost parts of the earth
[48:52] that means our router Park clipped down
[48:55] Kimberly all over I mean it never
[48:59] stopped and then First Corinthians 2
[49:04] uh from verse 1 in Britain when I came
[49:06] to you came not with Excellency of
[49:08] speech or wisdom declaring unto you the
[49:11] destiny of God for I determined not to
[49:14] know anything among you save Jesus
[49:16] Christ and him crucified and was with
[49:19] you in weakness and in fear and in much
[49:21] trembling in my speech and my preaching
[49:25] was not for the enticing words of man's
[49:27] Wisdom but in demonstration of the
[49:30] spirit and of power wow and then our
[49:35] favorite scripture
[49:37] second video on
[49:39] according as from verse 3 according as
[49:42] this divine power was given unto us all
[49:44] things that pertain
[49:46] unto life

[49:52] virtue whereby given unto our succeeding
[49:55] great and precious promises thereby
[49:58] these he might be partakers of the

[50:24] may be seated
[50:30] and uh
[50:33] by the days in your wife nice to see you
[50:35] also and everyone that I if I must we
[50:38] just want to say God bless you and good
[50:41] to see you Church wow thanks for those
[50:43] praise me follow up nice thanks
[50:47] and you know what's so beautiful when
[50:49] you have people praying for you but the
[50:51] very you know all across the world
[50:53] people sending encouraging messages
[50:56] phone calls and uh okay so I want to
[51:00] keep that for
[51:01] maybe after or another time
[51:04] so he didn't let the devil win just
[51:05] remember that
[51:07] so I got a special title today and
[51:10] you'll have to listen
[51:11] can I get some more on the stage
[51:13] monitorium my title this morning is
[51:15] God's powers
[51:23] subject is he shall receive power after
[51:25] the Holy Ghost has come upon you my
[51:27] inspiration is the gospel is in power
[51:30] and demonstration
[51:33] can we say amen amen hallelujah now it
[51:37] says young world is again falling apart
[51:39] the church cannot run without the power
[51:42] of God through the word and the Holy
[51:45] Ghost will only confirm the word of God
[51:48] for that what it is to do then he turns
[51:52] around and says the anointing is to
[51:55] confirm the word so the anointing comes
[51:58] white to confirm the word to back up the
[52:00] word to manifest it so you can have word
[52:03] word word but it says word without the
[52:05] spirit is nothing it must be spirit and
[52:08] word some is the word no Spirit
[52:11] somewhere is the spirit no word but when
[52:13] you get the two together then there's a
[52:16] manifestation of the power of God so
[52:19] unquote so we see the church cannot run
[52:21] without the power of God the prophet
[52:23] said the anointing is confirmed the word
[52:26] and it is the anointing that breaks the
[52:29] Yoke so that breaks the Yoke so we need
[52:32] to have the anointing here we can have
[52:34] the word and preach word and the Bible
[52:35] says one scripture says the word is dead
[52:38] the letter is dead but you need the
[52:41] spirit to bring that word to life and
[52:44] many people don't preach the spirit
[52:47] so by God's grace we want to get down
[52:50] the anointing that's what we need to get
[52:52] back in the church because that will
[52:55] bring the world to pass because you can
[52:57] walk with the word the word and it means
[52:59] absolutely nothing but brother when an
[53:01] anointing come when you're going to see
[53:02] as we go along that makes the difference
[53:04] that shakes the demon because now he
[53:07] sees the Life coming walking with
[53:09] anointing of God and manifests itself
[53:11] and it breaks the Yoke the Yoke of wrong
[53:14] habits the Yoke of bondage the Yoke of
[53:16] sin the Yoke of unbelief and he says
[53:19] here will falling apart he says and so
[53:22] does the word of God you can't now
[53:24] brother Luke said there were 14 the
[53:26] speakers and we want to thank them until
[53:28] 11 o'clock so he says hey it the
[53:30] speakers must be floating for the past
[53:33] because he's going to float on the boats
[53:35] so I'm going to float on the course
[53:39] so you might bring members by the
[53:41] millions but you'll never bring down the
[53:43] power of God until you get back to the
[53:46] original word again back to a
[53:48] foundational word back to the blood back
[53:51] to Jesus Christ back to the
[53:52] old-fashioned family that would be the
[53:55] powerful so you can't bring the church a
[53:58] true life on the Dogma or an
[54:00] interpretation of the message you need
[54:02] to bring the church it only comes to
[54:04] life by the spirit that will bring it
[54:07] back to life again so we're going to get
[54:10] back to the world and once we get back
[54:12] to the within the anointing comes upon
[54:14] it and then it's manifested so not by
[54:17] traditional Dogma but by the blood of
[54:19] Jesus Christ and back to the vision word
[54:21] of God Stephen in the book of Acts
[54:23] repealed them Pharisees said you just
[54:26] like your fathers you always resist the
[54:28] Holy Ghost so people don't want that
[54:31] yeah
[54:33] but I know you want it I know that's why
[54:37] you are here
[54:38] but these people drove hundreds of miles
[54:40] to be here they want the Holy Ghost we
[54:42] want the spirit Hallelujah and even
[54:45] Stephen when he was stoning him he says
[54:47] you always resist the Holy Spirit but
[54:51] the chorus writer said yeah thanks
[54:53] because the writer said uh yes the holy
[54:57] ghost power that's keeping me alive
[55:00] and he says it will save you when you
[55:03] die it will stop you lying it will stop
[55:07] the devil's flying
[55:09] Hallelujah that's what the Holy Ghost
[55:11] does so you need to get in the spirit
[55:13] otherwise she's not going to get nothing
[55:15] no matter what you do I you can be a hoe
[55:18] you're gonna need the spirit you're
[55:20] gonna find out
[55:23] so you stiff neck and you show it your
[55:25] action speaks and he chose it
[55:27] uncircumcised of us they don't want the
[55:29] holy ghost power in the church but it
[55:31] will be there because it's a promise now
[55:34] that sucks that I mean that's just the
[55:36] Devils out because you know he said no
[55:39] you're happy because it's a promise
[55:41] brother it's hanging over you you
[55:44] climbing a taxi it's there brother
[55:45] you're on the job that promise is
[55:47] hanging over you and one day it will
[55:49] manifest itself now listen what he says
[55:52] here in deceived Church by the world the
[55:55] power of the Holy Ghost that's the
[55:56] secret place in the church
[55:59] come on man the Holy Ghost is the secret
[56:03] place in the church
[56:05] members
[56:07] nothing we need the Holy Ghost that's
[56:10] the secret of place in the church
[56:20] mine and when the church adopts educated
[56:23] preachers and big buildings and finally
[56:25] in the state of the whole old-fashioned
[56:28] Holy Ghost they better be in the Mission
[56:31] Again amen how are you gonna have a
[56:33] Revival of the Holy Ghost and people
[56:36] cringy amen
[56:42] they cringe it and bind it and are
[56:46] afraid of it there's where the trouble
[56:48] lies but brother we must get three men
[56:52] you must get loose you must get to an
[56:55] individual experience with God and don't
[56:58] be used don't you'll be the one that
[57:01] binds the spirit
[57:07] they try to bind the Holy Spirit they
[57:09] try to bind everything that will set
[57:11] them free
[57:13] if anything that will set them really
[57:15] bright that will save them free that's
[57:17] why so many are dying spiritually yep
[57:20] it's a Lifeline in the church it's going
[57:23] to help you young people so don't reject
[57:25] it it's gonna set you free it's gonna
[57:28] break the Yoke Hallelujah
[57:31] if your name is on that Lamb's Book of
[57:34] Life the Holy Ghost is on your track
[57:36] you're not going to escape the power of
[57:39] God is here to set you free
[57:41] Hallelujah
[57:43] he says here the fish of the trumpets
[57:45] the Holy Spirit has been bound by these
[57:48] denomination Rivers for almost 2 000
[57:50] years but it is to be loose listen in
[57:54] the evening time

[58:05] this releases the Holy Spirit yes the
[58:09] Holy Spirit back in the church Christ
[58:11] himself revealing human flesh in the
[58:14] evening time he said it and he promised
[58:16] him so what releases the Holy Spirit the
[58:19] message
[58:22] it's been bound by this denomination
[58:25] rivers and false interpretations but
[58:27] they are too late the evening time
[58:30] message releases the Holy Spirit oh I am

[1:09:34] I'm here to tell you church he didn't
[1:09:37] let the devil win
[1:09:39] [Applause]
[1:09:46] unquote he says all this power is laying
[1:09:49] dormant
[1:09:50] is laying in the church just waiting for
[1:09:52] someone in the church to anoint the
[1:09:55] power because it's a promise he says
[1:09:58] you're drawing he says here the deity of
[1:10:00] Jesus Christ the coming of the Son of
[1:10:02] God is throwing eye that's right and
[1:10:04] only those who are charged
[1:10:07] uh he says by the Holy Spirit Holy Ghost
[1:10:10] who have Immortal Life living in them
[1:10:12] Immortal Life
[1:10:14] living in them the Holy Ghost that's the
[1:10:18] type that's going to be drawn from here
[1:10:20] just as certain as anything so you can
[1:10:23] be full of the full of the word and not
[1:10:25] be drawn
[1:10:26] full of that Holy Ghost one Buddhist
[1:10:31] said he's coming for his Holy Ghost and
[1:10:32] those that have it will go with him
[1:10:35] so you can never over emphasize the
[1:10:38] importance of the Holy Spirit you I
[1:10:40] never over preach it
[1:10:42] the theme of every person was have you
[1:10:44] received the Holy Ghost since you
[1:10:45] believe
[1:10:46] [Music]
[1:10:47] and when you receive it then you act
[1:10:49] different you live different you can
[1:10:51] drop your own chicken forgive the worst
[1:10:53] enemy
[1:10:56] and you know that's where you already
[1:10:58] says that's a trouble in the church
[1:11:05] he says here there was something about
[1:11:07] the little old Ark in the days of Noah
[1:11:10] that floated on top of the water it was
[1:11:12] a drawing power from above there was a
[1:11:15] light on the top that the glory of God
[1:11:17] Shone from Heaven down upon the upper
[1:11:19] room and I tell you today friends
[1:11:22] hear my word
[1:11:24] he says hear my word
[1:11:28] uh
[1:11:30] there is a drawing power not from the
[1:11:32] church not from the pastor but from
[1:11:36] Glory he says what is it the baptism of
[1:11:40] the holy ghost moving down right in
[1:11:43] right in that right Channel
[1:11:46] so you see you have to be in the right
[1:11:48] channel you can't be sitting here in the
[1:11:50] wrong Channel
[1:11:51] oh so yeah you know what you know I
[1:11:56] and I don't want to go that way but
[1:11:58] somehow it must be said
[1:12:00] I'll be in the church in the wrong
[1:12:02] Channel
[1:12:04] you're not going to get nothing
[1:12:06] Jesus asked him who do men say I am then
[1:12:09] they say liar is Prophet today he said
[1:12:11] but who do you say and brothers says
[1:12:14] Peter was in the right channel
[1:12:16] among all the ones there he was in the
[1:12:19] right Channel all of a sudden you come a
[1:12:21] revelation and he said all the Christ
[1:12:23] the son of the Living God he says Peter
[1:12:25] flesh and blood didn't reveal that you
[1:12:28] but my Father in Heaven because you're
[1:12:31] in the right Channel
[1:12:35] bluffing yourself speaking you can sit
[1:12:38] that way and not no man you go out
[1:12:40] towards you ever brother Juma said you
[1:12:43] every time you come to service you go
[1:12:45] out worse or you go out better
[1:12:47] it's just a matter of time it plays out
[1:12:51] [Applause]
[1:12:54] a drawing power not from the pastor but
[1:12:56] for he says from Glory the baptism of
[1:12:58] the holy ghost moving down in that right
[1:13:01] channel to throw up a church what is it
[1:13:04] the power of God the excess
[1:13:07] to his life this name Zoe
[1:13:15] now I had this before I even came here
[1:13:18] but when I was reading last night I
[1:13:20] thought wow yeah we're dedicating Zone
[1:13:22] he says it's access to the life
[1:13:24] God's life you have exists
[1:13:28] now if God was here I mean we treat our
[1:13:30] boss with more respect than what we do
[1:13:32] God
[1:13:33] so who must come here with such
[1:13:35] reverence and humility and humbleness
[1:13:38] knowing God gave you a job he gave you
[1:13:40] food to eat you were dying that one time
[1:13:43] he's made your life your children
[1:13:44] different things
[1:13:46] and I you think I'm gonna come in here
[1:13:48] and waste my time brother I come in as
[1:13:50] humble as I can be seeking favor
[1:13:54] and for as you get to this age
[1:13:57] politics and next thing program says I'm
[1:13:59] not here for Deacon and bylaws he says
[1:14:02] I'm here for one reason the baptism of
[1:14:04] the Holy Spirit that's why I'm here
[1:14:07] brother the people need it more in the
[1:14:09] message than what whoever this we spoke
[1:14:11] about but now it's so needful and you're
[1:14:14] going to find what the foolish versions
[1:14:15] went all the way to the way this up and
[1:14:17] then found out
[1:14:18] they didn't have oil
[1:14:21] we could say they weren't in the message
[1:14:24] they want the message they put the same
[1:14:26] quotes and everything but you found out
[1:14:28] they ran out of oil when rubita right by
[1:14:30] the wedding
[1:14:32] but then it was too late amen now I say
[1:14:36] that's funny because all of them was in
[1:14:38] the same service
[1:14:41] what was it all of them was at the same
[1:14:43] conventions
[1:14:47] exposition of the seventh Church Jesus
[1:14:50] he says I was a Revelations 110 I was in
[1:14:53] the spirit on the Lord's day and I heard
[1:14:55] behind me a great voice as they were
[1:14:57] trumpet I was in the spirit isn't that
[1:14:59] just beautiful my I love that you could
[1:15:01] just call those words the whole of the
[1:15:04] Christian Life he says you can call that
[1:15:06] words the whole of the Christian Life if
[1:15:08] I were going to live as a Christian I
[1:15:10] have to be in his spirit
[1:15:14] so yeah yeah there was is very different
[1:15:16] he says I was in the spirit
[1:15:19] on the Lord's day but he says here if
[1:15:22] you're going to live a Christian Life we
[1:15:24] have to be in his spirit
[1:15:27] so you come in here with your spirit
[1:15:29] amen and I expect everyone to bow to
[1:15:32] your spirit but you mustn't be in your
[1:15:35] spirit your spirit is enmity with God
[1:15:38] his Spirit you find favor with God so
[1:15:42] you have to be in his Spirit
[1:15:47] not how strong and how so you can't show
[1:15:51] nobody nothing you got to deal with God

[1:16:40] [Applause]
[1:16:42] the whole of the Christian Life
[1:16:45] if I was going to live he says we have
[1:16:48] to have
[1:16:49] to have to be in his Spirit John was not
[1:16:52] talking about being in his own spirit
[1:16:55] that would not have brought these
[1:16:57] Visions
[1:16:58] so John was in his own Spirit he says it
[1:17:02] wouldn't bring all those Visions in and
[1:17:04] John had to come up higher
[1:17:06] he said John you two EarthBound
[1:17:09] see investing you're seeing that and you
[1:17:10] seen all that he says no John come up
[1:17:12] higher and when John came upaya he heard
[1:17:15] the trumpet voice of God then he showed
[1:17:17] him things to come you're not going to
[1:17:19] see the vision of God when you hear come
[1:17:22] up higher come in your spirit brother
[1:17:24] get her away from yourself
[1:17:27] then God begin to speak to him and show
[1:17:30] him what is to come
[1:17:33] Paul said I will pray in the spirit
[1:17:35] he says here it has to be the spirit of
[1:17:38] God With Us to all our efforts are in
[1:17:42] vain
[1:17:43] so all your own efforts are in vain yes
[1:17:45] be ye spirit all said I will pray in the
[1:17:48] spirit I will sing in the spirit I will
[1:17:49] live in the spirit if there is anything
[1:17:51] good that I will come to me it has to be
[1:17:54] revealed by the spirit confirmed by the
[1:17:56] word made manifest by the results it
[1:17:59] bears as surely as John needed to be in
[1:18:02] the spirit to receive these tremendous
[1:18:04] Revelations from Jesus we need to be in
[1:18:07] the spirit to understand the revelations
[1:18:10] that God has given to us to Love by his
[1:18:14] word what is the same spirit so
[1:18:16] Hallelujah I have to get rid of my
[1:18:19] spirit I must decrease and he must

[1:19:41] the power of the Resurrection we walk by
[1:19:43] the power of the spirit who is our true
[1:19:46] seal our true Advocate our true
[1:19:49] comforter our true sign that we have
[1:19:51] been born from above peculiar people

[1:20:16] must be thirsty blessed are those that
[1:20:18] hunger at first of the righteousness
[1:20:22] they shall be found
[1:20:24] [Applause]
[1:20:31] I almost said something some people
[1:20:34] Emily last week right till in my house
[1:20:42] when the holster come upon him at the
[1:20:44] baptism no he has something just to show
[1:20:46] you are important this is
[1:20:47] when the Holy Spirit come upon him at
[1:20:49] the baptism of John he become the
[1:20:52] anointed Messiah
[1:20:54] now remember he was the son of God when
[1:20:58] he was born he was God's virgin born son
[1:21:01] but
[1:21:04] when he became
[1:21:06] the Holy Ghost came upon him because
[1:21:10] Messiah means anointed one and he was
[1:21:12] anointed when when the Holy Ghost came
[1:21:15] upon him now in Jesus Christ born the
[1:21:18] Virgin son he is the word
[1:21:21] and yet he had to go to Jordan that's a
[1:21:25] man to receive what the Holy Ghost
[1:21:28] now who are you and me to say I don't
[1:21:31] need it I'm all right you know the right
[1:21:33] you need the Holy Spirit man to come
[1:21:37] upon you and there'll be a Vindication
[1:21:39] because a voice spoke from heaven and
[1:21:42] said this is my beloved Son in whom I
[1:21:45] miss to dwell in there was a Vindication
[1:21:48] though he was the word you
[1:21:59] who are you and me
[1:22:06] wow
[1:22:09] so we need the Holy Spirit and only when
[1:22:11] he became baptized with the Holy Ghost
[1:22:14] then he was the Messiah yes
[1:22:19] wow that's say the prophet and Paul
[1:22:22] Jesus was always the Son of God he was a
[1:22:25] virgin born son but when the spirit Came
[1:22:27] Upon him and the baptism he become God's
[1:22:29] anointed Messiah a man approved of God
[1:22:33] was signed in wonders the anointed one
[1:22:36] so when Stephen rebuked him for
[1:22:38] resisting the Holy Ghost says you want
[1:22:40] your wickedness crucified the Prince of
[1:22:42] Peace man and he was a man approved not
[1:22:46] of men of God of God Amen which signs
[1:22:51] and wonders he said if you don't believe
[1:22:53] me then believe the world because the
[1:22:56] works I'm doing justify of me amen
[1:22:59] what's wrong with the people today man
[1:23:01] you can see this message is right you
[1:23:04] can see the anointing is right it goes
[1:23:06] with word is manifested it's backed up
[1:23:09] by the Holy Spirit and yet they will
[1:23:11] resist it
[1:23:13] [Applause]
[1:23:18] said in Messiah Jesus said himself if I
[1:23:22] do know the works of my father then
[1:23:23] believe me not if I claim to have the
[1:23:25] anointing and do not the works of God
[1:23:27] because I am anointed of him he says
[1:23:29] it's not me that do the works the father
[1:23:31] dwelleth in me he do with the works and
[1:23:34] if I do not them works then don't
[1:23:36] believe me but if I do then believe him
[1:23:39] now that was the Messiah now it is a
[1:23:44] former science The church here comes he
[1:23:47] says are you ready
[1:23:48] John 12 14 uh John 14 12 Jesus said he
[1:23:53] that believeth me the works that he do
[1:23:55] shall he do also amen now he says
[1:23:57] Messiah yes

[1:25:36] the Earth
[1:25:39] when I fell when he fell upon Luther it
[1:25:42] manifested the promise of that hour when
[1:25:44] the fell upon Wesley it manifests the
[1:25:45] promise of that hour when he falls in
[1:25:48] this day it manifests the promise of
[1:25:49] this hour it's the Holy Spirit coming
[1:25:51] down to Quicken
[1:25:53] and make alive those that are for
[1:25:56] ordained of God to be in the Rapture
[1:25:59] now how can you resist you can't even go
[1:26:02] in the Rapture without it
[1:26:04] but it's here to Quicken and make a life
[1:26:10] now the word Quicken you know what it
[1:26:12] means to make a life
[1:26:15] those that are folding to go in the
[1:26:17] Rapture now the Holy Spirit comes to
[1:26:19] Quicken and make your life
[1:26:22] God help us what for brother and to go
[1:26:24] in the Rapture that is if you are a true
[1:26:27] ego
[1:26:30] now what's the prophet's word that's a
[1:26:32] few three a true Eagle you will
[1:26:34] understand the message
[1:26:38] you will understand the message of the
[1:26:42] hour if it's a true Eagle not the eagle
[1:26:44] little Eagle probably in the barnyard
[1:26:46] was eating all right but he knowed it
[1:26:48] wasn't just exactly right but when he
[1:26:51] heard the truth then you receive the
[1:26:53] truth now a true ego a true ego
[1:27:01] so the Holy Spirit Falls in this day
[1:27:03] manifest the word of the hour and he
[1:27:06] says that's because you have to pick in
[1:27:07] and make those alive that's for the
[1:27:09] Indigo in the Rapture the angel of the
[1:27:11] Lord is on the Earth moving around
[1:27:13] fixing everything for the coming of the
[1:27:15] Lord
[1:27:18] we're doing well
[1:27:20] in the church but God's just now
[1:27:22] loosening up the church everywhere
[1:27:24] getting in order now so he can get into
[1:27:28] the Rapture yes
[1:27:30] so now you stumble at me but meantime
[1:27:33] you don't see the Holy Spirit loosening
[1:27:34] you
[1:27:42] the past is called higher no one can
[1:27:44] live higher than the person I don't care
[1:27:46] how you study what you can't live ahead
[1:27:48] in the past that's God's Lord's works
[1:27:52] yeah and you won't believe I pick up
[1:27:54] things in the spirit day at home
[1:27:57] so I I can come here I had a different
[1:27:59] message but I thought no I want to
[1:28:01] encourage you my first time back
[1:28:05] write it down
[1:28:07] I'm not here but
[1:28:09] shows me things
[1:28:12] I'm gonna just drop something quickly
[1:28:14] that's what the Bible says obey yes them
[1:28:18] did what
[1:28:19] has the room over you so don't treat me
[1:28:23] like nothing
[1:28:26] I have the rule of you
[1:28:30] and the past is a suspicious man not a
[1:28:34] congregation he says the pasties
[1:28:37] so when I see you not in the service hey
[1:28:39] I'm suspicious
[1:28:41] I see you in the church you don't like
[1:28:43] me but outside you're talking I'm
[1:28:45] suspicious I see you clicking and
[1:28:48] cleaning
[1:28:49] I see you parcel
[1:28:51] yes I become suspicious
[1:28:54] maybe that's what made me sick because
[1:28:57] he meant to slap makes lovely
[1:29:01] yes worry nobody else
[1:29:05] man
[1:29:06] so where's the way the word obey yes the
[1:29:10] Pastor said not even me progress is half
[1:29:12] an hour early we walk in here
[1:29:17] the Pastor said how many times in a nice
[1:29:21] early
[1:29:24] [Applause]
[1:29:27] we stay with my message is there another
[1:29:30] church but God says not loosen up the
[1:29:32] church so he's loosening up so don't
[1:29:33] look at this I'm getting it no he's
[1:29:36] loosening you up then you must see the
[1:29:38] Uncle you miss it yes Mother Father you
[1:29:40] miss it
[1:29:42] he says here obey the voice of God God
[1:29:44] deliver the children of Israel when they
[1:29:46] were in bondage and they couldn't help
[1:29:47] themselves but today
[1:29:50] God's people are not in bondage
[1:29:51] spiritually
[1:29:52] for they are delivered by the power of
[1:29:55] the Holy Spirit no man has to stay in
[1:29:58] bondage
[1:30:05] no you are set free by the power of the
[1:30:09] Holy Spirit if you in bondage you want
[1:30:12] to save in bondage you understand your
[1:30:14] sin you understand your own Spirit oh
[1:30:17] this is your man has to stay in bondage
[1:30:20] of sun any longer because the Holy
[1:30:23] Spirit brings him from the bondage of
[1:30:26] sun
[1:30:27] so if you want to stay bound you want to
[1:30:30] be like that
[1:30:32] there's more oh

[1:30:45] will hear your prayer he will set you
[1:30:47] free he'll give you the results of your
[1:30:49] heart he will touch you by his spirit
[1:30:53] amen we're not prison for popularity

[1:32:26] because you know what he said I was the
[1:32:28] king I can do what I want to and then he
[1:32:30] offered up yasi when Samuel came
[1:32:32] erupted he says your kingdom is not the
[1:32:35] part he says because God don't work

[1:33:03] church to you you know what I'm looking
[1:33:04] for at this age

[1:33:14] took me so by surprising you know I was
[1:33:16] coming in I was gonna make an
[1:33:18] announcement and then this thing hit me
[1:33:20] righteous yes and then somebody took it
[1:33:23] out and it went like wildfire couldn't
[1:33:27] wait on the past to come that's all you
[1:33:28] had to do wait until the pastor comes
[1:33:31] back now you preempting stories running
[1:33:34] all over
[1:33:35] sad on you man we're supposed to be a
[1:33:39] scripturally trained Church where's your
[1:33:42] train in all those years I've been I

[1:33:55] I expect people to pick up that example
[1:33:58] dress properly come right
[1:34:00] but you people don't pick up that they
[1:34:02] don't see
[1:34:04] and you still find people walking in
[1:34:06] your half past 10 half pasting
[1:34:09] Now where's your obedience to the word
[1:34:11] now it's not even me saying that you say
[1:34:14] you love the Lord but where's your
[1:34:16] obedience yes

[1:34:53] way his voice he says so you don't need

[1:34:59] blood was offered so you you yield you

[1:44:39] him
[1:44:46] [Music]
[1:45:07] well buddy that's what Believers believe
[1:45:11] we believe in the rapture we believe in
[1:45:14] the seven Thunders
[1:45:15] [Applause]
[1:45:16] no one is going to make us change that's
[1:45:18] the powerhouse
[1:45:21] so don't go out of the powerhouse
[1:45:24] with the Lord shed in your life oh
[1:45:27] goodness that would be very sad man do
[1:45:30] you think you were in the PowerHouse
[1:45:32] when God was pouring it out
[1:45:34] and still you have uh low cherry
[1:45:38] yeah
[1:45:41] promise Lord help us you got to be
[1:45:44] convinced now this is my closing quote
[1:45:46] convincing concerned he said destroy it
[1:45:50] I'll raise it up again
[1:45:52] thoroughly convinced now that's a
[1:45:55] problem also I think in the message
[1:45:56] people are not convinced
[1:45:58] because if you convince then you'll be
[1:46:00] on time you all must serve as you be at
[1:46:02] every service yeah we're begging the
[1:46:05] people just to come to church and the
[1:46:06] sun we want to open Wednesdays
[1:46:08] but you get them to get them on a Sunday
[1:46:10] now is your experience genuine I got a
[1:46:14] question even the people are sitting at
[1:46:16] home and watching on live stream when
[1:46:18] the power of God is here
[1:46:20] there's no live stream that you can uh
[1:46:23] compare with being in a live service no
[1:46:26] way
[1:46:29] [Applause]
[1:46:31] a word you might be paying your tithes
[1:46:34] and offering he said but moral support
[1:46:37] being in church makes you a true member
[1:46:43] I am paying my ties so I'm okay no
[1:46:45] you're not okay why are you not in
[1:46:47] church
[1:46:49] sure
[1:46:52] I'll raise it up again he says
[1:46:53] hallelujah
[1:46:55] scriptures can't fail I'm convinced that
[1:46:57] he's the same yesterday today
[1:47:00] in the ministry that the message that
[1:47:02] I'm preaching just what's a prophet I'm
[1:47:05] convinced
[1:47:06] in the ministry and the message I'm
[1:47:08] preaching I'm convinced is the truth
[1:47:12] now you want to question this or people
[1:47:15] walking away
[1:47:16] when the prophet said I believe this one
[1:47:19] I'm convinced
[1:47:22] I'm convinced that it's the truth I'm
[1:47:24] convinced that these Visions come from
[1:47:26] God I'm convinced we're living in the
[1:47:28] last days my we can stand man while I
[1:47:31] read this quote how
[1:47:33] old man just rejoice and give God praise
[1:47:36] he says we're living in the last days
[1:47:38] I'm convinced that the spirit that's on
[1:47:41] me now is the Holy Spirit and I'm
[1:47:44] convinced that that's on me now is the
[1:47:46] holy spirit brother
[1:47:49] next time we come from here to here and
[1:47:51] there amen not always point to them but
[1:47:54] they say me me I feel like a Powerhouse
[1:47:57] I feel I'm passing with the power of God
[1:48:00] who said I'm going out anointed I'm
[1:48:03] going out different amen yeah I always
[1:48:05] say you say you so where's your show me
[1:48:08] yourself amen show me your zero
[1:48:12] what's up
[1:48:15] I'm confused that that's only the Holy
[1:48:18] Ghost Glory
[1:48:19] I'm thoroughly convinced I'm convinced
[1:48:21] that the Holy Ghost why is the right way
[1:48:24] I'm convinced that the Bible weighs the
[1:48:26] truth I'm convinced that this is Jesus
[1:48:29] Christ here now I'm convinced if we
[1:48:31] believe him at this minute I'm convinced
[1:48:34] that he would heal every sick person in
[1:48:36] a moment in a twinkling of an eye I
[1:48:39] convinced he would pour out the Holy
[1:48:41] Ghost upon you till there would be such
[1:48:44] a shout till it will be hard to tell
[1:48:47] what would take place so you have to be
[1:48:49] convinced
[1:48:54] speaking like this and a love spirit
[1:48:56] will drop down
[1:48:58] listen to this quote he says you are in
[1:49:01] of all the wrongs in the church he says
[1:49:03] all the wrongs will be made right
[1:49:04] [Music]
[1:49:07] so it's not going to take any man to
[1:49:08] make the wrongs right that long
[1:49:10] spiritual drop down make all the wrongs
[1:49:13] right and he says the sick will be
[1:49:15] healed without even hands laid upon me
[1:49:18] [Music]
[1:49:19] wow he said it I thought it would be
[1:49:23] hard to tell what will take a race I
[1:49:25] believe from my heart not because I'm an
[1:49:27] old man
[1:49:29] I preached this when I was a kid and I
[1:49:31] just told you
[1:49:33] 61 years
[1:49:35] I was 16 17 years
[1:49:38] and I still feel the same way
[1:49:41] so you think anything is going to change
[1:49:43] me
[1:49:44] ah
[1:49:46] sin too much man and when I was a kid
[1:49:50] not over 20 years old I've been
[1:49:52] convinced since that day he met me on
[1:49:53] the river Hallelujah and convinced that
[1:49:56] he's here now you must be convinced
[1:50:00] that the pillow fire is the same full of
[1:50:02] fire that was with Israel in the
[1:50:04] wilderness is the same pool of fire with
[1:50:07] a church today
[1:50:08] so yes we're bringing the church the
[1:50:11] same pool of Fire
[1:50:12] he's here
[1:50:16] my that was with the inner Israel and
[1:50:19] wholeness is the same qualified with the
[1:50:21] church today Glory says I'm convinced
[1:50:24] that it's right I'll give my life for it
[1:50:26] I left home and everything else give
[1:50:28] everything over I'm convinced it's the
[1:50:31] truth I'm convinced he's here now and
[1:50:34] I'm convinced that this Spirit that's
[1:50:36] here now is the holy spirit
[1:50:38] oh I'm convinced that we baptize into
[1:50:41] his Spirit right now
[1:50:43] I know it's the truth and fairly
[1:50:47] convinced that Jesus Christ is the same
[1:50:49] yesterday today in favor I'm convinced
[1:50:51] perfectly convinced that the angel met
[1:50:53] me up there and told me what he did I
[1:50:56] stood before heathens before thousands
[1:50:58] and tens of thousands say aren't you
[1:51:00] afraid so he says no I'm convinced it
[1:51:02] come from God I'm convinced because it
[1:51:05] was scriptural now I preached this way
[1:51:07] because this message is already
[1:51:08] Vindicated I don't have to vindicate it
[1:51:10] was Vindicated by an Angel it was
[1:51:12] Vindicated by the power of fire all we
[1:51:14] gotta do is preach it he will back it up
[1:51:17] and you can't set the time limit on God
[1:51:21] [Music]
[1:51:24] I'm convinced that it comes from God I'm
[1:51:26] convinced because it was scripture
[1:51:29] my
[1:51:31] I'm convinced that it is the angel of
[1:51:33] God I believe it with all my heart amen
[1:51:36] I'm convinced if he would if we would
[1:51:38] ask God for anything he'd give it to us
[1:51:41] just scared don't be scared Jesus is
[1:51:45] here
[1:51:46] man let's borrow it
[1:51:49] and I want you if you have a situation

[1:53:26] powerhouses wherever they went be the
[1:53:29] shadow fell upon the people he was a
[1:53:31] Powerhouse and they would jump up God
