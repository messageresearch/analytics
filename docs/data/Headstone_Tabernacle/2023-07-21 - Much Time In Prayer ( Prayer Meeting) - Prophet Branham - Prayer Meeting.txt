time in worship the praise God God bless his sins and it's a privilege to be here tonight and tonight whatever special something for you tonight and something that I discovered and I want to share with you much time in prayer for the randomly spoke about Jesus having much time in prayer and he focus on it in a message call Jairus healing of Jairus daughter so we want to play on this except tonight and uh pray God that will be a very blessing to you as you listen and absorb and it gives the focus in this age of so much distraction how much we should find out space to get much time in prayer so we want to go straight into the night by the grace of God so God bless you and then after this we go straight into prayer praise the Lord now shall we just a moment for a word of prayer how they will raise your hands and say brother remember me in prayer as you're praying would you put up your hands O Lord Jesus can see you God bless you every word that's fine he sees every hand our heavenly father as we come upon the grounds of the shed blood of Jesus oh God give us the vision tonight of seeing what that was Wayne Manuel's veins were plucked and drawn out the blood cell of the dying Lamb of God do there to sin breaking the blood cell freeing the life inside okay but now the worshiper coming to God comes through the shed glove all the innocent Lamb of God entering in to Zoe the life of God himself becoming then a son and daughter of God upon the basis of the shed blood then we go forward to carry on the work of reconciliation that Christ died for a Calvary teaching Sinners that they can be reconciled to God to the shedding of his blood and if any Stripes was included in this marvelous atonement that the Holy Ghost himself is here out of the blood cell to witness it to be truth that by his stripes we are healed oh how we thank thee father now thou to see the hands of these people you know everything they have need of in the very desire of their heart I pray father God that you'll yield to every one year especially this blessing tonight everlasting life heal all the sick and afflicted call back-to-back sliders get Glory into their own self as we present ourselves as empty vessels that the Holy Spirit would fill now for the service of God this we present to you in the name of the Lord Jesus the son of God Amen just for a few moments to approach God of all the bases of his word if the engineer would maybe be a good idea this step this up just a little bit if you want because the more people it makes the volume cuts down in the book of Saint Luke the eighth chapter and beginning about the 50th verse that's fine engineer who's doing it hear me all right way back in the back now that's good up for balconies that's fine all right now listen close for a few moments but when Jesus heard it he answered and said fear not only believe she shall be made whole and may the Lord add His blessings to this word reading of the word we're speaking tonight of America taking place in the Bible will be able to walk again without his braces your lace cops use a couple of wheelchairs setting here tonight two or three on them we pray that God will empty these up tonight only believe my dear beloved friends now remember I could not hear you I have nothing to heal with but God perhaps is the only one can heal you I don't know what your troubles is but surely if God will come down in the word and then come down to the spirit and prove to you that each year in the very principle that we're preaching that the holy spirit is here and will come and show you the same and prove to you by the Bible it's a diet that you can be made whole accepted just believe it with all your life don't make a difference how you feel just one down in your heart you know that you're going to get well don't be afraid move right now that's God speaking to you that's where that line come out of the animals are not the animal but out of the Son of God coming back witness into are that he has accepted your faith in glory and you've got to get well now we're speaking of a miracle of taking place in the New Testament the healing of giraffe's daughter A Little Priest at the temple wonderful lesson if we just had the time to speak on it a while just previous to this chapter we find one place there where the Son of God spent so much time in prayer and if Jesus had to spend much time and prayer to stay in fellowship with the spirit that presenting how much more do you and I have to spend in prayer much time and prayer if you only knew what time and prayer then but sometimes when you're in prayer God changes the the complete destination of different things that's going to happen do you believe that something fixing to happen and your prayer to change the whole situation what do you say if God knows it's going to happen what will my prayer do you remember when he stood there looking out upon the Harvest he said he was the owner of the Harvest he said the hardest is right and labors are of the few praise ye the lord of the Harvest of heal sand labors into his heart in other words pray to me that I will send laborers into my Harvest which I'm just telling you it's such a needy thing but part of the ways in human beings do you believe that the kingdom of God lays within the human beings now Jesus said to our place I am divine ye are the greatest Divine Cave Bear fruit the branches in the vine bears fruit God cannot bear fruit on himself it's got to take the church is that right he's got to take you branches to bear fruit and when you branches are yielded to the Vine then proof comes forth see what I mean God wants your hands you want your talent want your lips watch your ears watch your hands and feet so he can bring forth fruit through you now despite much time in prayer one day there he told his disciples he said uh come to the other side he sent him away while he went up in the mountains of rain while he was up there alone really a storm coming up I believe I don't know but I believe if I've been the disciples I said I know he told us to go over but I believe I'll just wait till he comes and goes along I like for him to be alone in these cases don't you so we see him now going up into the mountain the disciples thrust down to the scene picked up their horse and their little ship sail went up and away they started oring across to the other side where Jesus was to need him on the other side in the absence of the Holy Spirit on Christ then invisible Farm on the road over trouble setting and usually if you start anywhere without the troubles on its own just as soon as the devil sees you out of fellowship with Christ right then he'll set out as hard as he can just as soon as he sees you away from prayer away from consecration as he possibly can you know what one night when Billy Paul you're my boy he's a little bitty thought we'd leave a little two-room cabinet my wife had put this uh floor wax all the linoleum on the floor is real slick on the floor we had an old bucket out of the other room the kitchen had two rooms and we were sleeping in the front room and the next room was the kitchen and the bucket of water set out there they're different and so he woke up and he said Daddy and I said what little bitty fella he said I want a drink and I said oh I'm so tired in my head walked up patrolling I said honey could you go get a drink there it's just your chest inside the door he said Daddy come go with me and I said oh there's no there's never hurt you honey just go inside the door he said Daddy I'm afraid You're Gonna Let You Go With Me that's right God I'm afraid to go to unless you go with me father I know it's all right you are again ministers to go preach the gospel but if you don't go with me I'm parade little [Music] rugs laying in there and a little fella slipped it with a picture on Farmers on his face if I didn't have a hold of his hands and I haven't even when I get to keep it from smashing right down on his face and I thought truly God that's right you throw my hand in these slippery dark places and things while I'm searching for the water alive you just hold on my hand as I move along [Music] just across the other side him being the king of all Prophets the Son of God virgin born knowing what to follow and having to do he knew felt the pressure that battle coming so he got up in the mountain alone to pray that's the way and as he was a supreme he looked down upon the sea as the sun was going down the winds the contrary and the little old boat twisting and flipping around just about to go they were scared little ship coming up they were ordering with all they had enough and they happened to look long and you're coming walking on the waters going on a past them he can get over all right so you're a cop walking a passing and they got scared and thought they seen something a Spirit uh what we would say today something spooky here comes the man walking on the water walking by him and they were scared and were troubled here's the point the only thing that could help them they were scared of it and that's about the way it is today and holy spirit God sent Revival people were born together the spirit of God and people are being healed and signs and wonders the Holy Ghost comes in Missouri Supernatural signs the people God said relief that's mental television that's the devil I'm free to that the only thing that can help India they become scared so Jesus said don't be afraid it's ah it's me just open up your heart tonight while he begins to move over the audience to see if you don't say don't be afraid this is me I'm your savior I come to you you just believe it I'll have him stick to you amen see it yeah just believe it'll only believe is the only thing you have to do now we've seen crossing the waters that just left another side for free Bible put a tough place over in Galleria but instead of the Revival taking place the people didn't want no Revival see if you don't walk right he won't push himself on you you certainly won is that you have to warn him first blessed are they that hunger and his first acting righteousness for a day shall be filled yeah yeah that's it when you hunger even a blessing to hunt anger and thirst for righteousness now watch what he did he crossed that Empire sea to go over on the other side to say one man that really was wanting to see him come and he was a maniac of Galleria darmania acronym being demon possessed here come all the preachers outlooked of the house we can't have any Revival while they fell forceful with the gambling homes that did Jesus and that's right they wanted their homes they would appreciate that man being delivered from that evil power you know that man when he received his right mind he wanted more to follow Jesus Jesus told him to go back in the city and testify when I get to glory after see how much pressure his testing his Galleria from then on there we are the maniac recognizing quickly a demon for sale their Devil's Crown out of him and said We Know Who You Are yeah the holy the holy Son of God why do you come to turn and as Jesus said hold your peace and come out of him and they said if we come off you'll ask he said take your pleasured one and a home shot down the river drowned about two thousand people come out through all miles can't have the meeting so all the preachers I've sat around said now you just fall back out the one side we don't want them seriously that's spooky we don't want that we just rather stay here our creatures and so forth we don't want that that's that's not the thing that we wanted we thought it would be different from that you know things don't change too much and the times goes wrong especially that that's real they don't fly there's many revivals has been preached across the country this off to be one big house to the West in the North to the South that's right but people don't
