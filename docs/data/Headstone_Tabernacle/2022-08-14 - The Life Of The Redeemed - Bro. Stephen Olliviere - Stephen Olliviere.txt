flesh shall i see god whom i shall see for myself and my eyes shall behold and not another my eyes amen though my reigns be consumed within me praise god and hebrews chapter 9 verses 11 and 12. praise god amen but christ being come and high priest of good things to come by a greater and more perfect tabernacle not made with hands that is to see not of this building neither by the blood of goats and calves but by his by his own blood he entered into once into the holy place having obtained eternal redemption for us amen amen let's just bow our heads one more time heavenly father this morning we are needy people lord we need more of you lord we need more of your love we need more of your spirit come and baptize your people lord fill and refill lord lord draw us closer to you father hide me behind calvary's cross lord and may your words be spoken to your people this morning words of life father have your perfect way we we give you all the glory on our praise in jesus name and thanksgiving amen and amen praise god god bless you amen let me be seated praise god amen praise god so from the message fellowship by redemption brother branham says many times we see that we the mortal beings of this earth how that we become tossed about and strayed around across the world i don't believe there's anybody that's got a christian spirit could look upon the world today that wouldn't groan in their spirit i often wondered how people today take this life so lightly but it's nothing to be taken lightly can we say amen can we say amen the very reason that we put here on earth is to worship god amen to come to god and to come into his fellowship can we say amen hallelujah he says and to see men wandering about around as if they have no god as if there was no god oh my man has driven himself out into that kind of a condition and so i believe that the most essential thing that i could think of any minister speaking of is to get the people back to the general principles of the gospel can we say amen amen coming back to a place coming back to god amen can we say amen praise god and says what is the use of building upon a foundation that's already been condemned what's the use of paint in an old building that the government has already condemned and that's what many people are trying to do today they're trying to reform you see we'll start a church we'll turn a new page we'll try to do a little different from what we used to do before listen he said you will never get anywhere like that you're just wasting your time so we didn't come this morning to turn a new page amen hallelujah i would quit my line and i would quit my stealing all those things are good as they are but you are still a million miles off of that road see so what should i do then he says you've got to start back to the foundation you got to build a new place don't patch up the old one build a brand new one you've got to come back and start right can we say amen hallelujah that's the reason you see so many faulty mystics so many people indifferent people who profess christianity my it sounds hard he says but you are the only bible that many people will ever read your life is the only bible that men and women will ever read just the way you act just the way you do and behave so christians are supposed to be living examples of what christ is can we say amen and if christ is in the human heart then he will certainly live his own life for christ is in you can we say amen hallelujah and if the spirit of christ be in you then you become a new preacher give the lord a hand of praise thank you jesus glory glory glory amen i just wanted to share that before we got started amen so this morning my title is the life of the redeemed and my inspiration is claim your redemptive blessings and my subject is the plan and process of redemption praise the name of the lord amen glory to god amen and this morning you are the redeemed you are part of the redeemed of the bride of christ can we say amen just turn around and tell your brother you are the redeemed you are the redeemed this morning amen glory to god amen redeemed by the blood of the lamb amen give the lord a hand of praise you are the redeemed brother joel glory thank you lord amen amen amen so let's try to get started now to redeem history purchase to buy back something that was lost by the payment of a ransom to regain possession of something in exchange for a payment can we say amen to bring back to make amends for to restore back to an original estate i will restore saith the lord amen amen amen so it means that if we are redeemed then we had to be lost or we had lost possession of something that rightfully belonged to us something some inheritance something of great value amen hallelujah [Applause] why would we need a redeemer if we were in our rightful position come on now amen let's see when god placed adam and eve in the garden after he had made everything genesis 1 31 he said it was good he divided the light from the darkness he divided the sea from the land he made the trees and the fruits he made the animals the fowls of the air the fishes of the sea the beasts of the field every creature upon the face of the earth and he saw that it was good amen hallelujah [Applause] then god made man in his image and likeness and give him dominion over every creature every living thing and god blessed him god blessed him amen man was blessed praise god amen god bless them hallelujah be fruitful and multiply and replenish it and subdue it and have dominion over everything god said it was very good hallelujah thank you jesus amen give the lord a hand of praise amen amen and this is the place that man had before the fall amen he was created in the image and likeness of god a place of dominion can we say amen glory to god amen and my purpose today is to show you what we fell from and what we are going back to amen say amen this morning glory to god this world is not my home i'm just passing through praise god this customer's world system that we know is not our home praise god don't get accustomed to this world this world is not your home this morning praise god amen hallelujah and when we look back at this world we groan in our spirit amen this world is not our home praise god we don't belong here praise god i am in this world but not of this world give the lord a shout amen amen amen glory to god hallelujah amen amen [Applause] but what adam and eve had back there that is the earth we were called to live in yes lord can we say amen amen notice there was no mention of sickness no sin no death no crime no wickedness that was not there hallelujah and god said it was very good glory instead what was there there was eternal life it was the land of perfect health we had they had joy and speakable they had peace sweet peace glory to god amen alleluia there was perfect fellowship and perfect love oh glory to god amen hallelujah praise god amen adam and eve were living in perfect harmony the animals and perfect peace praise god and anima and adam was god of the earth common g.a man god of the earth the earth was his domain can we say amen hallelujah glory from the message fellowship when god was fellowshipping with adam in the garden of eden adam had nothing to worry about everything was smooth and running right he didn't have to worry about clothes about death about sorrow he knew nothing about those things can we say man this morning glory he just had the freedom like a child he had a heavenly father who watched over him and fellowship with him daily praise god amen hallelujah oh how the father loves our daily fellowship daily fellowship daily fellowship praise god amen every day sweet fellowship with your father somebody say amen glory to god brother branham says wouldn't it be marvelous if we could be back like that again if we could be back like that again say amen praise god hallelujah glory to god amen from the message i will restore berbram said i can see even her beauty as she sets there they did not know what sin was this is what man fell from saints can we say amen glory and adam takes her by the hand and walks down the garden and the wind blows and eve says oh dear that wind adam says peace and the wind stops oh glory to god amen hallelujah amen amen amen eve says adam if this tree was sitting over here instead it would look prettier adam says be plucked up and cast over here and it did give the lord a hand of praise amen amen amen praise god do you see what man fell from do you see what man fell from amen why do we need a redeemer glory to restore us back to bring us back to our rightful place yes lord can we say amen peace be still peace beast telling man of glory does that sound familiar hallelujah one time the disciples were in a boat and the winds became rough and the boat began to shake contrary winds winds of destruction but jesus was in the boat hallelujah glory go away jesus lest we perish and jesus awoke and he said peace be still and there was a calm glory to god and the disciples said what manner of man is this that even the winds and the waves obey him hallelujah he was the second adam demonstrating what we are going to do he was the man that had dominion over the very elements he was a man that controlled all nature can we say man glory to god but abraham said the second adam proved that it could be done oh glory to god amen hallelujah it could be done he was the example seed son it could be done greater works than thee shall you do he is saying it could be done you could do it you could do it he's he's the example seed son praise god hallelujah i'm tired seeing christians defeated you can do it this morning you were born to overcome you were born to conk up you can do it this morning praise god you can give the lord a shout give the lord a shout hallelujah glory to god amen and from a message i will stop by abraham said and when adam is redeemed back to god the way he should be for redemption and have faith in god he will do it again also he's talking about you this morning praise god he's talking about you you are going to do it also amen he says because it lays in adam's hands and christ was the link that linked man together amen the second adam proved that it could be done give the lord a hand of praise glory glory glory [Applause] so listen when the devil blows contrary winds of fussing and arguments and fighting in the home recognize as the enemy and say peace be still you can do it give the lord a hand of praise amen the holy spirit does that like fussing and carrying on with one another that's the devil peace be still can we say amen you can do it somebody say amen this morning glory to god amen let's practice it let's speak a day man praise god adam had the spoken word power and he fell from that he fell from that what a perfect life perfect love perfect faith perfect fellowship that adam had that's what man fell from amen but the devil came and interject injected his filthy life sin came in and man fell from the perfect image of god he fell into this human life from eternal life into mortal man one who could die we weren't supposed to die man from perfect health to a body of sickness and sorrow a pest house from knowing no sin to a perverted carnal life of sin from dominion power to bondage and subject to the dominion of sin from spoken word power to powerless weak man oh my god from she was tripped from faith to fear and doubt oh my god man was lost what a horrible sight oh my god hallelujah from fellowship and with god to hiding from god to man-made religion oh my god my hallelujah can you see the separation can you see the chasm between god and man it was a big divide man and man fell from his position as heir of the earth to fallen man driven out of his very home into a fallen estate no longer did he have it in her life nor his inheritance in life can you see it this morning can you see it man formed in the image of god air of the earth but stripped of his sonship stripped of his courtship now powerless the same man that god placed in a position of authority the same man with the power to speak and to rule the earth oh god can you see it this morning can you see where man fell from praise god oh my god not only was adam lost but every other human being after him would be lost as well every human being would now be born in sin and shaped in iniquity and had to die man was not supposed to die oh praise god so all of humanity was lost lost lost hallelujah no wonder john wept bitterly he wept bitterly amen can you see the magnitude of the loss can you see it this morning all right so there exists a conflict between god and satan and it looked as if satan had the upper hand in the battle satan take god took god's word and twisted it and then tried to use god's judgment against his own children you shall not surely die they ate it but god cannot break his word they had to die god is constrained by his own word the day you eat you shall surely die oh my god i can see satan snickering in the garden yes i got him this time you kicked me out of heavenly places well i will make you kick your very children out of their home out of the place to fellowship with you oh my god hallelujah hallelujah there's a conflict between god and satan there's a war going on between god and satan they are just two forces at war god pulling up what and satan pulling downward i don't care what it is they're just two forces whose side are you on this morning which side are you on this morning who is on the lord's side who is on the lord's side praise god hallelujah praise god praise god thank you jesus glory to god hallelujah glory listen there are two things that god don't play with you see his worship he's a jealous god he hates idolatry he's a jealous god don't play with his worship how he dwells in the praises of his people don't play with his worship hallelujah praise god amen so you better worship god this morning hallelujah he's a jealous court he loves worship praise god amen thank you jesus and the second thing you see fellowship with his children don't ever interfere with that fellowship god loves fellowship hallelujah he's jehovah father papa god he came to fellowship with his children praise god jehovah god amen hallelujah hallelujah glory amen glory hallelujah so adam had to walk out of the garden stripped no title deed to his home no power no fellowship no super sense of faith i can see satan and his imps for that short moment rejoicing it looked as if they were finished as if somebody say i said praise god amen hallelujah reminds me of when the children of israel left egypt happily and rejoicing oh no more pharaoh no more taskmaster but after a while they heard the sound of horses coming behind them oh bye and they were cornered mountains on the left mountains on the right red sea in front of them and all dreadful pharaoh and his army behind someone said your god is a poor general is this where he led you to a dead end yes so it seems right here is where god led us righteous where god wants us praise god amen hallelujah oh my so don't despair trust him he's a god of armies stand still and see the salvation of your god thank you jesus glory yes lord glory to god amen amen amen so there they are leaving their home mere mortals now no longer in the image of god humans adam is no longer legally the owner of the property so he loses the deed to the property but satan's dirty hands could not touch it he never paid for the property it was never given to him so legally the property goes back into the hands of the original owner hallelujah amen and the original owner once again has the deed for the property which is the earth can we give god a hand of praise hallelujah oh praise god amen from the message the breach when adam forfeited it then satan's dirty hands could not take it so it went back to the original owner which is god himself hallelujah there he sits on his throne with his hand the title deed the abstract title d to eternal life in his hands oh man what is it doing in god's hands waiting for redemption claims hallelujah waiting for redemption claims praise god he made a way of redemption and someday the redeemer is to take it back hallelujah a glory to god tell me something you mean to say that god knew that this would happen that man would fall are you saying he had already made a plan of redemption to restore fallen man oh my oh my if so when did he make that plan after the devil beguiled eve in the garden when from the message desperation jesus came to save those who in the book of redemption before somebody said before before the foundation of the world give the lord a shout give the lord a shout praise god so god is not now saving you god is not now redeeming you god is not now wondering if to redeem you hallelujah but there are some names to be redeemed in the book of redemption i don't know who those names are the pastor does not know whose name is in the book but if today by divine revelation you know that your name is in that book begin to rejoice hallelujah give the lord a shout give the lord a shock hallelujah praise god glory to god amen if your name is in the book give him praise give him praise give him praise hallelujah don't rejoice because you can cast out devils don't rejoice because you're a preacher don't rejoice because you heal the sick but rejoice rejoice because your name is in the book of redemption give the lord a shout this morning give the lord a shout o hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh and once your name is in that book no devil no sin praise god nothing can blot it out it's written in red in the eternal section praise god brother you are going to be redeemed give the lord a shout give the lord a sharp total and complete redemption this morning praise god [Applause] hallelujah i am redeemed redeemed by the blood of the lamb already redeemed in god's mind before the foundation of the world give the lord a hand of praise give the lord a hand of praise thank you jesus glory to god thank you jesus glory can we say amen but over in revelation 5 and i saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the back side sealed with seven seals what book is that what book is that verse two and i saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof what book is this this book seems to have something extremely important and valuable because one you have to be worthy to open it and two the book itself is sealed up not with two seals but seven seals praise god amen it's properly sealed up amen must be valuable must be important amen and john is in the vision looking at the whole scene and john observes that no man in heaven no man in earth not even under there was able to open the book neither to look there on and john webb much oh man surely john understood the importance of this book and the contents of the book oh my he knew it was important he knew it was very important what is this book and why did john weep my and said from the breach here is what i think john wept for john wept because if no one was worthy and could open this book of redemption then the whole creation was lost so we know what a book is it's a book of redemption the prophet answers the two questions the book in the right hand of him that sat upon the throne was the book of redemption can we say amen the same book that adam forfeited the same abstract title deed book that went back into the original hands of the original owner god himself that same book hallelujah praise god amen my hallelujah praise god grace and peace be unto you for him from him which is which was and which is to come he is present he's past his future all at the same time praise god that's the god we serve this morning amen amen amen glory to god hallelujah amen so when man fell god he didn't just make the plan he activated the plan ah hallelujah he was not now making the plan he activated it glory brother this bible is god in print form in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god can we say amen hallelujah glory from genesis to revelation has been god jehovah god extending his love reaching out in grace to redeem adam's fallen race can we say amen can we say amen every scripture every book you can see the types and antitypes of the general theme of redemption every mystery every revelation points to the redeemer christ can we say amen one time abram said if you can't see christ in every scripture in every revelation then you have read it the wrong way glory i challenge you find me one scripture in the bible one story that does not connect to redemption in some way the redemption of adam's fallen race my christ is the central theme of the scripture christ the redeemer can we say amen can we say amen in the old testament we see the blood of bulls and goats we see offerings and sacrifices and laws and priests and the ark of the covenant what was that glimpses of redemption hints of redemption types and shadows but never full redemption just yet my the book was still sealed as it were amen oh but god was still unfolding his mystery god was unfolding his plan step by step unknown to the devil praise god amen hallelujah thank you jesus amen in front of the devil and he was clueless building back his masterpiece in his people through his people abraham faith isaac love jacob grace and joseph perfection every one of those characteristics speaks of god's redemption hallelujah glory to god amen looking throughout the old testament praise god the story of boaz and ruth it was the story of redemption amen can we say that amen david said he will know he will not suffer my holy one to seek corruption he was prophesying that the redeemer would pay the price of debt for redemption praise god amen can we say amen hallelujah daniel seal it up until the end don't say nothing yet about my plan i'm not ready to expose the full thing yet leave it until the time of the end praise god hallelujah amen moses the children of israel coming out of egypt had to be baptized in the red sea praise god it speaks to redemption
