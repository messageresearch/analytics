I've been greetings from the brethren in kinasa Congo and we had such a mighty time in the presence of God and um I would say a few words before but Anthony ministered to us this morning what a meeting what a meeting what a glorious meeting that we had um the Lord really worked mightily but just to kind of give a a summary um I shared something about the the church being set in order but country preach about him blessing now bless the but Paul and then Jacob preach about uh this Gospel of the Kingdom shall be preached for witness I preach about uh the sovereignity of the local church and the F Ministry but all preach about uh the work of the ministry and then brother cont p a message I call war in heaven and what a war it was it was really really something and um that was the last service and actually well you would know that by looking at the tapes what time we start what time we finish so the morning service does start in the morning start maybe after 1 or so so we had almost two Services back to back but so brother count had to take the last service and that last service while he was talking of course I I guess was tired whatnot he was laboring and whatnot and during that service people from other churches I guess other groups who had their morning service begin to come into the building and as they were coming into the building it's like everything was drying up just it was an unbelievable thing it came to the spot where brother J had to say how many believe that raise your hands because amen wasn't even coming out but before he went into his thing he had a dream and he shared the dream that this man looking like I guess some Demon some tall guy was looking to capture two sisters who were like Christians and he had a discernment that he trying to catch them or something like that and he put cut a long story short he end up at a fight with this guy I had to beat him out beat him completely out the building all together right out until the sister were free so when I heard the dream I tell myself something like that going to happen but so said so done well brother cont stood there and he stood there and beat that Spirit Plum out the building it was a sight to behold you talk about a labor he did labor when the spirits had a breakthrough he said look we start we start start and then I got a breakthrough again he start and and it just lit the place of fire till the people were just sitting down watching like judges all them had to stick their hand up and whatnot it was really really something else the service went on for hours after we've left the place after all that set of time there's a guy there who we had testimony afterwards which he knew all the messages churches across there when he saw how the whole convention progressed he said he want to get baptized he he's supposed to be a prophet uh in this denominational realm he want to get baptized and so on he had 11 almost I think 16 baptisms and so on the guy who came to do the videotaping for them just imagine that unbeliever and when he finished he want to get baptized in jesus' name it was such a dynamic witness of the spirit and I want you to be encouraged amen be encouraged we are living in difficult times but take great courage in your heart you have to do that get strengthening your own self don't quit don't give up take a stand amen so before but Anthony come I just want you to stand I just want to read even don't find it just stand for respect for the word revelation CH 12 I would just want to read two verses there and there was a war in heaven Michael and his angels fought against the dragon this is verse seven of revation and the dragon fought and his angels and Prevail not neither was their pleas found anymore in heaven and the Great Dragon was cast out that old serpent calling the devil and Satan which deceived the whole world he was cast out into the Earth and his Angel were cast out with him may God bless his word you may be seated amen amen hallelujah Glory so as I said I spoke about the church to be set in order for the coming of the Lord lot of people don't know that that's a promise church is not halfhazard God is not running a halfhazard business amen you have a certain order and this is what I shared part of what I shared in Africa a chain of events is now unfolding beyond the control of man all these events and things is being done that the scriptures might be fulfilled am the angel of the Lord is on earth now fixing things around for the coming of the Lord amen the church is to be set in order the bride body amen the local body or the church local church holds portions of the universal bright body the local body or church represents or reflects the universal bright body there will be a true fivefold ministry as revealed by the prophet of Malachi 4 amen they the true fivefold will be given to speak to the universal bride body God will bring them for they will be properly Vindicated by God the fivefold ministry will not be hand selected man selected self-appointed or voted in this fivefold ministry will be God's mechanics on the earth that he can work true to the bride body at large it will be there is my spirit flowing freely not there is my explanation interpretation or Revelation the fivefold ministry will be adopted Sons yes sir amen adopted Sons Ministry or adopted Sons given the ministry of Jesus Christ for the Perfection of the Saints God promis it and he will send it the fold ministry will not serve the fold Ministry would serve the Bride of around the world with the word it will not be a private Ministry am or a local Ministry God will send it out amen and I told the brethren we are all local ministers I told them that I will not answer for any church in Nigeria any part of the world but this church but the F for Ministry is a local Minister that has been placed in a position to effectively minister to the bride around the world Amen are you with me am okay this is a prayer from brother brandham don't sleep now don't get weary this is an important service our heavenly father I'm so happy today to be here at Cleveland this great City one of the major cities our beloved nation and to give a testimony of thy son Jesus who has died to redeem this lost race of people throughout all the world and now as you have gathered us here together this afternoon to pour out your spirit upon us may every man woman boy or girl from every church every Creed denomination race color forget all about the past now listen to this prayer let's look to the Future amen let's look to the continuing city that is to come Cleveland is home to many thousands millions over a million people here God we pray that men and women will never be satisfied until they have met peace with you so that we can go to that continuing City looking upon the giant SK scraper in the city looking upon the fine buildings and structures but there will be a time when there won't won't be one stone left upon another we believe that these cities in this great major conflict that's coming will be rocked with atomic powers and millions will die in hours blowed to bits even the Earth shook from its orbit going into the sun great heat shall Scorch men as the scripture says in the book of Revelation I felt led to bring that to you this morning that Millions will die am but help us God to get our mind on you settled down to go into this bloody Trail I review it Lord the best of my knowledge you help me as I start back in the beginning when you put your hand on your poor humble servant I may all my mistakes today May others and young boys and girls who come in may they be stepping stones to bring them to thee may they profit for my errors of suffering that they might know you in the power of the Resurrection for we ask it in Jesus name amen amen another message the resurrection of Lazarus notice before God does anything on Earth he always sends a message warning getting things ready he said I kind of feel religious right now I believe there's something moving going on now God warning as it was the days of Noah get to the people ready something is about to happen the atomic powers and things are ready to burst Upon Us Millions will die in a split second but oh my God is getting his church ready for the Rapture the coming of the Lord then before God send something to the Earth he always sends his message and God sends his angels to vindicate or verify certain things so the angel of the Lord is on earth now yes sir fixing things around for his coming he will move governments he will move ministers he will move preachers he will move pastors he will move neighbors he will move businesses he'll move whatever he has to move and shift around for the coming of the Lord hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah praise the name of the Lord and when Daniel saw the Gentile Kingdom coming to a close notice what was unfolded every kingdom was inferior to the one before that every kingdom was inferior to the one PR priority it'll get worse isn't that right now but Bram says this one more this only seven seal if them others is perfectly in the D with the word so is this perfectly in the D with the word we are here wow we are the end friend soon it shall time run out Millions would lose their lives now I believe that they are saved they will be counted as a father for the atomic age he call them Father that just material to make that that prophecy come to pass making that up we don't want to be Atomic father we want to be raptured Saints and there's not two groups taking one group taking one left it's two one taken one left it's who is going to be that one that going to be taken that going to be walking like Enoch walked with the word we are living at the last hour by the grace of almighty God by his help to his people that might look forward to the soon appearing of Christ how long but brandham maybe 20 years maybe in 50 years maybe in a 100 years I don't know but maybe in the morning maybe tonight I don't know anybody that says they do know they're wrong they won't know God only knows H could we say amen amen so he said now from a little group of the true seed of the word God will present Christ a beloved bride oh blessed be the name of the Lord am praise His wonderful name from a true seed of his word glory to godes Hallelujah God will present Christ a beloved bride a version of his word and through them and by them will be fulfilled all that have been promised isn't that right the Word of Promise in himself like it was in Mary okay here we go God himself made manifest that was the promise the promise as what God to be made manifest he will act himself by his own Word of Promise no man have to make himself God God will act himself to fulfill his very promise so so watch watch he will act himself by his own Word of Promise so to fulfill what has been written of him oh blessed be the name of of the Lord blessed be the His holy name so you don't have to worry and fuss God will act himself you don't have to work up anything manufacture anything God will act himself oh praise the name of the Lord hallelujah so this is some TS from the meetings praise God but the country brother SP Enoch walked with God he walked with the word he walked with the mechanics and then the mechanics turn dynamics that means that we can walk with the mechanics and walk with God Amen while waiting on the spirit which is the Dynamics we have authority to walk with the mechanics there's a word for you to walk with isn't that right hallelujah praise God and bu read a scripture considering the Good Shepherd feeding the sheep and so on and we have a charge as pastors to Serve and Protect the Sheep yes not not not govern them and rule them and and be like the Gentile toing over them no Serve and Protect isn't that right God want pastors to trade his children in the way of God that's what the people come to church for to be trained I am not here to confirm your dream I'm not here to confirm your thoughts I'm not here to yeah boy you Pastor say that and there a confirmation to me like you are the object of what the pastor come to do that's not what it's about that's what we have in trining that bunch of disrespectful people looking there for for the pastor to confirm them that's not what it is about that is foolishness that is off the word we're not here for that we're here to bring the word that that you could benefit from that I don't care what you dream what Vision what inspiration I have nothing to do with that all I have to do is to bring the word to you amen oh pray could somebody say amen hallelujah so God did not tell the pastors to put their Spirit on the people the ministers the pastors the elders are to point the people to the Holy Ghost to receiving the Holy Ghost what has taken place in this message is that pastors and ministers put their fights and personal Warfare on the people so the people now car the fight and behavior and the people now have become evil bad behav bad attitudes hateful and you can't even talk about the life you no longer need a life all you need is a confession of what the church believe oh praise the G of the Lord look how dangerous has become one brother in Africa there he with his false Doctrine you are the Holy Ghost reach so far as to tell the people is either you make a choice either you are the holy ghost or you're the devil pick one that's a sticky one not for me but that's all foolish it that they come what what are you the holy ghost or a devil so what was Peter before he got the Holy Ghost Peter was a Believer just like you and I believ in the promise of God waiting on the promise of God isn't that right isn't that right so what was okay okay so let let's go a little bit now but Bram as I speaking about Peter this is what I shared in the message about set in order for faith in the substance this was a BMB B said look at Peter when he was walking by he was Mortal he was born of sinful flesh just like you and I but the people here we go had need of a Healer so they sent God sent Peter to do that specific work uhhuh John was love Peter didn't have the love in his heart that John had John was God agency of love that's a bomb they were both adopted Apostle hear this look here he taking Peter James and John hope faith and charity do you see it those gifted people them Tre hope faith and charity Hope was in James he was the one who set theis in order Faith was in Peter and charity was in John hope faith and charity and they were God's representative on the earth and the people laid in Peter's Shadow and were healed amen so that is why you can't judge and compare this ministry with that Ministry with that Ministry and that Ministry and you pre for this one than that one because God have their gifts that will find their places and their position in the word and all together will glorify God could we give a lord a shout in the house so God knew the people need healing and Peter had a big kind of faith and you could see it in his track record even before he had the Holy Ghost because when Jesus was walking in the Water Peter said Lord if there is you bid me to come only Peter could talk like that because Peter had that kind of faith and Peter begin to walk without the Holy Ghost you're not hearing what I'm saying praise the name of the Lord hallelujah so now in these offices okay now okay let's continue uh they are chosen these offices they are chosen by God apostles prophets to so if God pick somebody who is not who could unpick them Dev voted in Matias and Matias did nothing there's no book of Matias writing of Matias Epistle of Matias Matias was just picked voted in but God picks Paul a hook know Jew that wasn't among the bunch and he had to come and say if all you think all yourself is a spiritual acknowledge I am a prophet and if all you don't know that all all on your own all you ignorant stay ignorant but I have been sent Paul an apostle to the Gentiles an apostle of Jesus Christ Fearless even Peter to back down when Paul Come Hallelujah Paul is God's man on the earth God's star in his right hand hallelujah oh glory to God Amen okay so watch teachers evangelist pastors five spiritual offices in the church to set the church in order Apostles prophets teachers evangelists those those are called offices of God then in the local congregation there are nine spiritual gifts that work among the people now in these offices places in the offices you hear from the Apostle like in India they ask me if we're going to get a universal Pastor I said no then you get a universal pontiff or Pope and that's what people want them Pol them politicians in the message these um these these political spiritual politicians right so so God not going to have that the perfecting will come where you hear from the pastor yes you hear from the Apostle you hear from the prophet that you hearing and what they teaching and preaching because brotheru CT it off that right now we are doing the work we doing the work of the ministry until we are approved in that work we have to be doing the work right now is not man perfecting you when they said the fightful ministry is for the Perfection of the it's not men perfecting you you have to be with this man you have to be in this church you have to be this particular group it's not that it's the word doing the Perfection it's Christ doing the Perfection isn't that right and the prophet even say going to hand those love gifts even just before the wedding supper each has a separate Ministry and their ministries of God and God has set them in the church for this purpose and I'm about to close but in obedience he's speaking about God of the evil age this little fith woman that lives by faith the bride the person here what she believes the word obedient here we go waiting in love amen not waiting frustrated grumpy angry messed up no waiting in love for the promise of the age to be confirmed she is watching for it she is part of that word she is watching for her life to manifest that word brethren can't you see that I hope that didn't go for you the body is waiting for which is the word waiting for the life which is the spirit to confirm or make it alive and that's what she is waiting for no other life will work in her she can come to life any other way by telling her she's the Holy Ghost she can't come to life with that amen she can't come to life any other way yet she feels it out there she knows it's going to happen then it happens she wakes up God said let there be and she come forth like the first one come forth I'm finished just play Oh How He Loves You and Me Oh prayers we stand brother Anthony come and minister to us the word of God and when scripture he said why in heaven he said and he said it Satan has been down here a long time he's an expert in what he does we can't find this battle on our own we can't fight is a Angelic Warfare we need angels to be with us hallelujah we need the angel of the Lord to be with us we need somebody to fight with us we need Michael to be assisting Us hall you need protection you can't just fight on your own this Supernatural demon was kicked out Heaven no and that's why Seven Angels Came From eternity to bring Angelic beings on the earth to give the bride a

I want to read a portion of scripture there and we also want to read Ezekiel 9 and Revelation 7 okay but uh we read from Exodus chapter 23 firstly amen hallelujah Exodus chap 23 and verse 20 Hallelujah says behold I sent an angel before thee to keep thee in the way and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared beware of him and obey his voice provoke him not for he will not pardon your transgressions for my name is in him but if Thou shalt indeed obey his voice and do all that I speak then I will be an enemy unto thine enemy and an adversary unto thine adversaries for my angel shall go before thee and bring thee in unto the amorites and the hites and the perizzites and the Canaanites uh the uh the the the hites and the jebusites and I will cut them off hey amen now turning over to Ezekiel 9 and then we go to Revelation 7 afterward praise God so Ezekiel 9 amen hallelujah okay Ezekiel 9 reading from veres 1 to verse 6 amen he said and it says he cried also in my ears with a loud voice saying cause them that have charge over the city to draw near even every man with his destroying weapon in his hand and behold six men came from the way of the higher gate which lie towards the North and every man a Slaughter weapon in his hand and one man among them was clothed with linen with an incor right a writers incor by his side and they went in and Stood Beside the bracing Altar and the glory of the of of the god of Israel was gone up from the Cherub where upon he was to the threshold of the house and he called to the man clothed with linen which had the ink on writer uh writers ink on by his side and the Lord said unto him go through the midst of the city through the midst of Jerusalem and set a mark upon the foreheads of men that sigh and cry for the for all the Abominations that be done in the midst thereof that's Mercy going forth first isn't that right and then verse 5 says unto the others he said in my hearing go ye after him through the city and smite let not your eye spare neither have ye pity slay utterly old and young both maids and little children and women but come not near any man upon whom is the mark and begin at My Sanctuary then they began at the ancient men which were before the house and turning over now to Revelation chapter 7 uh we just read the first three verses there praise God and then we'll uh say a word of prayer amen Revelation chapter 7 verse one it says and after these things I saw four Angels standing on the four corners of the Earth holding the Four Winds of the earth that the wind should not blow on the earth nor on the sea nor on any tree and I saw another Angel ascending from the East having the Seal of the Living God and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels to whom it was given to hurt the sea to HT to hurt the earth and the Sea saying hurt not the Earth neither the sea nor the trees till we have sealed the Servants of God in their foreheads amen amen may God have blessing to the

said if they ever lost that Pillar of Fire in the New Testament he said uh I mean in our age he said through 1500 years of Dark Ages he said they failed to see it but there was a fellow One Day by the name of Martin Luther and he saw the pillar of fire and away he went on the First Reformation you see you have to follow this Pillar of Fire wherever it's leading you've got to go praise God we are in

Martin Luther says he saw a pill of fire and away he went on the First Reformation he said but you know what he organized his church so tight it begin to be it was only the Lutheran Church you was

moved away from the Lutheran Church Luther couldn't go because he had all of his rituals and everything wrote up and then there was a little fellow by name of John Wesley in England and he saw it and away he went and he had a Revival that saved England us and the United States and the and English Known World in that day isn't that right praise God hallelujah they had a great Revival but then the

that same time but the Bible says at that time when things get messed up at that time when it seems like there's no hope for the world when it seems like Satan's got everything covered under his thumb when he's got everything under his power under his control when it seem like the devil is sitting pretty at that time is when Michael shall stand up listen the word stand doesn't just mean physically stand I'm not talking about physically is standing up but that word stand means to take up a position that word stand means to take up an authority on the matter that word stand glory to God hallelujah oh stand there having done all to stand this morning glory to God hallelujah oh you catch what I'm saying this morning so in the beginning when we were fighting with Michael Michael recognized that we took our stand with him we took up our position in the matter we resisted the devil's lie we resisted the devil's confusion we resisted the devil's interpretation we took the word and we fought the devil out and Michael recognized your stand and Michael is here this morning to stand for you you're all confused I don't know if I got the Holy Ghost but Michael is here to stand

point Bible says she laughed within herself I'm not talking about it the loud laugh there's a loud laugh everybody knows a loud laugh you're happy he excited but this was a cynical laugh isn't that right this was a didn't laugh not even Abraham heard this laugh he was talking with the man in the tent and she laughed within herself her servants didn't hear it the people around didn't hear it this was her silent interpretation of what that man was saying and while she laughed the Holy Spirit picked it up and the man spoke and said why therefore did Sarah laugh Hallelujah and I could believe at that moment her eyes popped open she was surprised she didn't think that anyone had heard her she run outside she said no no no it wasn't me she tried to deny it but God said I know that you left I heard it when you left praise God isn't that right the Bible talks about a father which seeth in secret isn't that right he can see the secret things amen the things that we tried to hide the things that you tried to cover up he sees it he knows it he knows what you're going through this morning he knows what is in your mind this morning he knows that you have doubts he knows that you have fears Sarah doubted herself that she could have pleasure with her Lord after that she was old and Barren but God had a different plan God have a different thing and it didn't matter how much unbelief Sarah had in her heart God said that he would bring through Sarah the promise of Isaac and through you God will fulfill all that was promised you are the one that God has been looking for all this time you might doubt yourself but don't you worry God is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all you can ask oh Hallelujah he knows the secrets this morning hallelujah hallelujah is not [Music] right hallelujah hallelujah isn't that right look at Daniel Daniel is there and King Nebuchadnezzar has a dream a terrifying dream but he forgets it and he calls his wise men and his and his his sages prophets and asks them to reveal to him the dream and they can't do it and he gets frustrated and he goes to Daniel Daniel says go King give me some time because I know a god that is the revealer of all secrets he knows the secrets that you cannot tell the secrets that you cannot see the secrets oh H you cannot explain he knows every secret every mystery isn't that rightall isn't that right the devil when he came into the Garden of Eden Adam was not aware his back was turned he slipping subtly and begin to beguile Eve and begin to tell her a different thing I begin to talk to Eve and ask her what did God say and then he begin to attack the word and when he got the word he got Thro off the word he caught her right there and entertained her mind isn't that right he slipped down in secret and when God's back was turned Adam's back was turned and didn't know what was going on the devil was slipping into the picture Hall when God came back to the Garden of Eden he found a big mess that was was there he found a big corruption that was there in so much that he cried out Adam Adam where are you why are you not in your position why are you not in your place that I left you at before I came isn't that right oh Hallelujah and God purose in his heart that just that the devil the devil think he knows about Secrets but just as the devil came down in secret and mess up God's Eden God is now ready to come down in secret and mess up the devil's oh Hallelujah say Amen somebody the serpent thought he was slippery the serpent thought he was subtle but here's a bride she don't even know her own fullest potential but one day you're going to know as you are known and the great secret of God's heart will be revealed upon you oh Hallelujah in secret you slip past the devil in secret you slip past the enemy oh H the devil don't even know who you are if thou be if thou be but every day we're getting stronger every day we're proving something to the devil though that we fail though we may fall there's a part of us in this morning that comes from immortality that is going back to immortality oh hallelujah oh we are here as a witness of a true and living God isn't that right look even Mary she's pregnant and she and Joseph actually passed through Jerusalem on their way with the Messiah praise God isn't that right didn't even know that Messiah was among them while the scribes was looking and looking uh for the for the prophecy of this Manchild and so forth and they didn't know what was going on some of them didn't was so 400 years caught up in the thing and caught up in their religious realm they didn't even were aware that this little woman with a baby in her stomach the Messiah was p through Jerusalem on her way to Bethlehem isn't that right going to give birth to the Messiah and Jerusalem was looking for him Jerusalem was praise God looking for him to come in their own interpretation and here was a humble little woman riding on a little donkey Joseph by her side oh hallelujah how the days are getting shorter and she's about to have that baby and Jerusalem don't even know the urgency of the hour oh not even Herod knows the urgency of the hour that the stars are beginning to line up and that star Bethlehem was going to lead those wise men onto the Messiah oh what are you saying this morning the devil doesn't know who you are this morning the devil doesn't know that you are the greatest secret oh you are so secret that God slip you under the seven seal and drop silence under there oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh hallelujah hallelujah oh and then what happened Michael dropped down Revelation 10 with a cloud closed oh a rainbow upon his head feet as it would the Sun Pillars of fire Hallelujah feet as pillars of fire isn't that right what he come down with he come down with the book of names he didn't come down with a closed book but he came down with an open book an open book with names names of people on the Earth that were to be called in their season and in their time oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah isn't that right and your name was in there and my name was in there and when that angel dropped down he come down to a prophet isn't that right when that cloud appeared in Arizona God told the prophet are you looking at the picture right the the prophet saw the a cloud and formation and the angels all isn't that right but God told the prophet ask the prophet a question are you looking at the picture right he said turn the picture to the right and when he turn it to the right seven angels consolation become one picture which was Jesus Christ oh Hallelujah seven angels become one voice the voice of the [Applause] Archangel hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah isn't that right now God takes his man but not his Spirit God took the prophet but not that angel that angel is still on the earth this morning he's already used a prophet in the fullness of his capacity all of the Mysteries are revealed he has going on there's nothing more for the prophet to do but God is waiting now for a bride to come on the earth to be the Fulfillment of the prophecy that that Prophet spoke that is why you are here this morning that is why judgment has to wait until the sons of God find their position then the Rapture could go then the Earth could move then the sun could be blotted out then all these things can happen but not before you rece receive your cealing of the Holy Spirit not before you become a witness of his resurrection oh Hallelujah God will have a bride on the earth once more we will hear direct from Goden amen wow praise God time is fast spent praise God Amen but um hallelujah praise God okay let me skip down here now okay want to read this here Covenant he said I heard a radio broadcast recently here's a prophet talking he said where the majority of the great scientists of the world give the world 10 years before total Annihilation 10 more years he said now that's just guesswork that was in 1954 amen he said but uh but here's the the hydrogen or oxygen he said if they ever start in a battle with that he said brother he said one burst in here one day and there he said I don't know what will take place just probably sweep the whole world over and that will be it it won't be even a mountain or a tree or a green thing or anything left on the earth just exactly what the Bible said isn't that right here's the prophet says here's an encouragement he said but we'll be gone at that time yes sir he said there's a part of us that's Immortal hallu isn't that right come from God going back to God it's Immortal he said no atom no hydrogen or nothing come on now is needed for that its spirit will be caught up in a moment in the twinkling of an eye to meet the Lord in the air oh Hallelujah isn't that right oh my okay let me read this quick here know uh second come of the Lord he said the church better be examining their by the word now he said our Purity our loyalty our devotion he said we become tattlers tail bearers cigarette smokers back biters painted up Jess Bells everything in the calendar that the Wilders the Christian church is associating in those things till today you can hardly tell one from the other he said it's time we took inventory it's getting late he said now in order he said it's so late that she had to light a candle and she got a candle not only did she get a candle but she got a broom and she went to house cleaning oh how many want to do some house cleaning this morning praise God oh Hallelujah your spiritual house isn't that right he said oh brother if there's ever needed time of lighting a candle the sending forth of the Gospel Light the Holy Ghost back into the church not so much for an emotion not for some Fantastics not for some emotional workup or for a jump of Joy Jump for Joy but a heart searching experience when men and women get right with God he said we are right we are at the end time oh Hallelujah people want to jump for joy people want to worship and the shouts but it comes as a sacrifice it's got to come at a cost there's no Revival that ever broke out that didn't come with a labor that didn't come at a cost that didn't come at a cost of prayer that they didn't come at a cost Hallelujah to being at the altar oh to searching yourself oh Hallelujah something that you've got to do before God does his thing you've got to do your thing before God pours out the Holy Spirit you've got to live right you've got to do it praise God you've got to do the house cleaning amen is that right and she L her can to give her light and brother he said every little candle in here ought to be lit tonight not only that but she got the broom Hall and the neighbors could see the dust flying she had a real house cleaning time oh hallelujah hallelujah oh she was praying she was crying she was crying out Hallelujah in the spirit house cleaning time isn't that right for her husband was about to come isn't that right and we say the bridegroom is about to come and if he caught her with that one coin out she was a holl at brother we the Church of the Living God in these great hours that we're now living in he said it behooves us to check up go before God light the candle of the word of the gospel and examine ourselves and find out if we're not falling short and especially when we see all these things coming we are at the end time the coming of Christ is at hand there's not another hope in the world for the church oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah isn't that right he said and look the church is loling the church has no conscience anymore you can hardly wake them up the Bible said they would come in that condition when they would say low or law delays is coming and they'll be devouring and biting one another and so forth and fighting around it's just exactly that hour everything's ready he said the pages are turned and as it was like that it's ready for the coming of the Lord oh Hallelujah isn't that right and down in maraval I was preaching and we was talking about Ezekiel 8 and how God had seen the the secret things that Jerusalem was doing isn't that right and if you go through it I may not have time to go through it but the Holy Spirit took Ezekiel up into another realm into a vision realm it was between Heaven and Earth Ezekiel said where he could see all that God was seeing and God took him up into a place and showed him a hole and told Ezekiel dig the hole and he will see a door and when he saw the door the God told Ezekiel open the door and you will see all the Abominations and I began to think to myself look at what God had to do to show Ezekiel all the hidden things that were being done in the city God had to take him through a hole take him through a door to see things that God had already seen amen isn't that right so people coming to church and hiding but they don't know that God has already seen you God is seeing what you are doing praise God he's seeing your attitude he's seeing what approach you having to the gospel he's seeing how you're praying he's seeing if you are searching for God he is seeing if you are really genuine about this gospel that we are preaching he wants to know what is in your heart he wants to know that you are making things right that you are doing all that you could do to be ready when he comes isn't that right he said oh while I come quickly and my reward is with me to do what to give every man as his work shall be isn't that right oh hallelujah hallelujah amen so you'll be rewarded according to your work isn't that right okay amen going to wrongs up said now when I was here the other time I tried to tell you um God's confirming the word with signs wonders and miracles and so forth okay I'll skip back back here now he said um he said now look at the age we're living in you know he said now to my opinion this is the age of the Turning time it's a time when men are either will come into the kingdom of God or be sealed out of the kingdom of God Amen he said and I believe that the Antichrist seals a person he said we're taught in the scriptures in the Book of Revelation If any man receives his seal or his Mark or the letter of his name and so forth is doomed is sealed out of the kingdom of God and the spirit of Christ come on now when Once sealed with that you are sealed into the kingdom of God Amen oh that's what I want this morning not to be sealed out but to be sealed in to the kingdom of God Hallelujah isn't that right when Noah and all of his family went into the ark the door was shut at the shutting of the door they were sealed in the world and everything else outside was sealed out the animals were in everything were packed in and ready there was no more names to be called that was it judgment was set Hallelujah and all who were in was in and all who was out was out isn't that right what does that mean filthy filthy still holy holy still there is coming that time friends where the tide will turn over to the Jews and where there no more blood left for the Gentiles but before that time make sure this morning that you are sealed in oh H make sure that you are sealed into the kingdom of God by the baptism of the Holy Ghost and Fire in your heart and in your life that you are applying this token that you are living praise God as life of Jesus Christ oh Hallelujah that we are so earnestly contending for this morning amen hallelujah hallelujah it's not about playing Church Hallelujah but it's being being real with God Hal being real sincere in your heart one time one a man came up to brother brandham and he said brother brandham they told me to come and talk to you brother Bram said what's what's wrong so the man said well I wanted to receive Christ in my heart he said and I used to go to church with my wife and so on and he said but I wanted to receive God in my heart and I didn't know how he said and I saw a piece of paper written somewhere about uh where will you spend eternity and he said right there the man he got a conviction and he decided he wanted to serve the Lord and he said he was wealthy he had money he said he started to sell out his business and his cars and he just wanted to know God's will for his life and he said he went to them Beth his church and the Methodist Church told him do this thing and you'll be all right and he did it but he wasn't satisfied he went to the Baptist Church he went to this church he went to that church and he still wasn't satisfying and the brother brother said I come to you brother Brandon because I don't have an answer I want to find Christ and and brother brandham said listen let's go back to the story let's go back to the beginning of the story he said what made you want to serve God he said well I looked at a piece of paper he said that was it he said right there something in your heart begin to ask a question hallah and right there you started searching for God he said it doesn't matter what church you go to it doesn't matter how much you jump doesn't matter how much you shout praise God but it's the life it's the it's the praise God it's that thing in your heart that's crying out for a reality he said that's the thing that is connecting to God not the tithes you pay come on now that's fine that's all right all that is church order Hallelujah but more than that there's a deeper desire within to want to know God to want to be with God to want to have that seal that Mark of the Holy Ghost in your life to want to have that witness of his Spirit oh H where he go you go where he lead you follow that's what we want this morning Enoch walked with God and was not but God took him and he had a testimony that he pleased God not his mother not his father but it was about God what he was doing for the kingdom isn't that right oh my my my Hallelujah GL amen praise God he said now if you come tonight uh this is on manifestation of the spirit okay um he said uh he said no if I come to you tonight listen closely if I come to you tonight and said I had the spirit of a criminal John Dillinger and John Dillinger spirit is on me he said you'd expect me to have big guns and be a big Outlaw like he was and if I had his Spirit that's what I would do he said you know God never takes his Spirit from the earth God takes his man but never his Spirit he said do you know what say for he took Elijah a double portion of Elijah's Spirit come upon Elisha is that right and several hundred years later he come out in John the Baptist Same Spirit isn't that right and it's predicted to come out in the last day is that right God takes his man but not his Spirit his Spirit remains here and when his when the spirit's gone the church is gone then he said then there be no more salvation no more care Mercy's over then the spirit's gone he said the Holy Spirit was upon the apostles that was upon the apostles is here tonight that same Holy Spirit God takes his man but never his spirit amen musicians could begin to come now if I told you I had the spirit of this famous Outlaw uh you'd expect me to act like him to be anointed like him and if I told you I had the spirit of some famous artist you'd expect me to stretch the canas out here and catch waves of the ocean and things like that he said if I had a spirit and if I confess to have the spirit of Jesus on us then we should do the things that Jesus did Jesus said he could do nothing but what the father showed him amen isn't that he said now when the angel of the Lord appeared to Moses it wasn't Moses it was the angel of God and when he when he appeared uh what was he when he appeared a pill of fire isn't that right and he led the children of Israel and any scholar knows that that was the angel of the Covenant which is Christ isn't that right and he's the same yesterday today and forever and as he read uh and as he read the lead uh the lead church back there in the Natural Body he's leading us today in the spiritual body amen amen isn't that right a few more quotes I'm closing here praise God they love him this morning amen so the angel of the Covenant is here to lead us out lead you into your ceiling lead you into your filling lead you into the Holy Ghost amen amen lead you into your place in Christ don't stay where you are this morning oh Hallelujah to stand still is death oh but keep on moving keep on moving into the presence of God keep on moving into the atmosphere of God Hall hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh amen okay question and answers on Genesis said what is what is Remnant what is Remnant he said the piece that's cut left same kind of goods isn't that right he say you go to cut a dress out of calco or pattern or something he said and you spread out a big piece of calco and cut it out he said it's your business where you lay the pattern and it's God's business where he lays the pattern he cuts her right out is that right and now this rest of this Cal is left here it's just as good is uh it's just as good a Calico as in in the in the dress isn't that right but it's God's election God elects his church God predestinate his church God foreordained that ordains his church and he takes his church out and a Remnant is left to go through the tribulation period isn't that right hallelujah hallelujah isn't that right oh my my my praise God looking to close out here now he said uh praise God he said uh now we come to that Mark of God he say I got 30 minutes remember the mark of the beast is not communism mark of the beast comes from Rome throughout the world Catholicism with protestantism Protestant uh protestantism joined into it organized religion they're going to unionize the churches till every church will have to bow to that thing or inter denominations are or kick to the sideline isn't that right Revelation 9th chapter he said and it was commanded that it should not hurt the grass or the trees neither any green thing neither any tree but those men which have not the Seal of God in their forehead he said when the plagues was coming only thing that was protected was those who were sealed away into the kingdom of God he said this is the investigating judgment when men and if God help me he said uh with the word of the Lord that is at the time of the sealing of the plagues and those things who rejected there's nothing left but Eternal punishment amen amen hallelujah do you love him begin to play something softly Hallelujah I'll end this off here with this quote the Seal of God you love him this morning let's talk about that seal and we closed he said well did he ever see a railroad or loading cars he said he'll go out and set so much here and so much there the inspector comes by he looks in he said and if this is a little loose it shakes nope he said I won't seal it got to tear it out and do it over again next thing he'll do is try to load it again he'll get this wrong the in Spector will come by wrong do it over again and that's what God has been doing with his church for a long time you load up and you're going to heaven you're taking everything with you your card games huh every other thing that you can load into the church you're trying to take it with you God just condemns it ain't ready for sealing but when God sees a man contr broken Spirit sincere in heart down at the altar God closes the door of the world to him and seals him in there by the baptism of the Holy Ghost Hallelujah and it lasts until Jesus comes not from one Revival to another but until the day of your Redemption hey let's stand this morning amen hallelujah I'm finished amen but the even could come amen hallelujah oh let's give him praise let's give him worship this morning oh hallelujah
