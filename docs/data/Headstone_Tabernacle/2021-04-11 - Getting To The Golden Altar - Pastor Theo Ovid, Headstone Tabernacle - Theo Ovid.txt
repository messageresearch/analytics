this morning it's good to have you here in the presence of god we uh we strive and we guard this atmosphere and when a man was driven out of the garden of the eden he was driven out of presence he was driven out of presence this presence of god was at the altar and all this gospel and messages to bring us back in the presence if we just just talking word and and talking a letter and talking mysteries and talking and we don't get into presence then we're not getting it right we have to come back in the presence thank you brother steven for the service this morning some services [Music] very strange i um uh the last message i preached was uh the book written with in on the backside sealed with seven seals and an inspiration with about the spoken word the written word and the living word and yesterday preparing for today i just went back to see the scriptures that that that i read in in that in that message and the scene i read was version 5127 and version 10 1 to 8 and version eight one strange enough descriptions i have today is almost like a continuation version five verse eight russian eight one to six and there's just two scripts we're gonna read this morning and um i just believe that somehow it's all connected and it's it's just something that god maybe have in his mind for to share with us this morning but before i get into what i want to get to this morning i want to reflect back on something i shared in a prayer meeting about the brass altar i want to get to that uh i think yes the spirit of burning i that this was the 19th of march and i permitting i read from isaiah 4 1 and 4 when the lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughters of zion and shall have purged the blood of jerusalem from the midst thereof by the spirit of judgment and by the spirit of burning and we're identifying that the spirit of judgment is the spirit of burning that's how god really cleansed by that spirit of burning that come by the fire of god exodus chapter four to be ready scripture i think i put a text out that you could have read it yourself um i came to pass in the first month in the second year on the first day of the month that the timeline was read up and moses read up the tabernacle fasten his sockets and set up the balls the boards thereof and put the bars thereof and raid up his pillars and he spread abroad a tent over the tabernacle and put the covering of the tent above it as the lord commanded moses he he took and put the testimony into the ark set the staves on the ark and put the mercy seat above the ark and he brought the ark into the tabernacle and set up the veil of the covering of the act of testimony so he sets it in order what moses did he put the act and he put the veil he's coming down now because he saw a vision and god telling what you see in heaven put it on earth as a sample of it right and he brought the ark into the tabernacle set up the veil for the covering and cover the ark of the testimony in the law as the lord commanded moses and he put the table in the tent of the congregation upon the side of the tabernacle northward without the veil that table which is the shoe bread schubert table on one side he set the bread on it in order upon it before the lord as the lord had commanded moses and he put the candlesticks in the tent of the congregation over against the table so on this side is the table of shoe bread and that side is the candle six i think the juice called the menorah that is what they have on the other side all right and he lighted the lamps before the lord as the lord commanded moses and he put the golden altar in the tent of the congregation before the veil so before you're going to the inner veil you have this golden altar that is represented right there just before the veil you can't go into the veil without passing this golden altar and watch he put the golden oats in the tent of the congregation before the veil and he burns sweet incense thereon as the lord commanded moses and he set up a hanging at the door of the tabernacle and he put the altar of burnt offering by the door of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation and offered upon it the burnt offering and the meat offering as the lord commanded moses so as soon as you open the door of the tabernacle you see the altar there that's the burnt offering altar otherwise known as the brisbane altar all that type in jesus christ so the first you can't miss it it is right in front of you you can't get around it you can't squeeze around it the first thing as they open the door is a brazen altar where you have to bring your sacrifice oh hallelujah praise the lord and the brazen altar was like the key element of the timeline in the wilderness a place where the israelites brought the animals to offer as an atonement for their sins and it reminded them that they were not worthy to approach a holy god without first offering blood sacrifice for sins or give the lord some praises leviticus chapter one and the lord call unto moses and speak unto him out of the tabernacle of the congregation saying speak unto the chair of israel and say unto them if any man of you bring an offering unto the lord you shall bring your offering of cattle even of the herd of the flock it is an offering to be burnt it to be burnt sacrifice of the hood let him offer a meal with our blemish he say what to bring not bring anything he's given specifics until that day we're going to see how god is very specific he specifies what he wants and how he wanted not what we think or what we feel you know is what he specifies you say a male watch he said without blemish he shall offer it of his own voluntary will at the door of the tabernacle nobody forcing you voluntarily watch and he shall put his hand upon the head of the burnt offering so he can't watch it and kill it that daddy bundle friend you know no no you have to put your hand you have to be identified with the burnt offering you can't be disturbed from it you can't watch it you can't say there's a good offering you know there's a good bull no no no you have to put your hand on it because that bull represent you you was the one that was supposed to die you was the one that worthy of debt and now you're going to feel the life leave this animal that's as you that you were supposed to die and this animal took your place and you have to get the experience of that life leaving the animal and the animal quiver and you know the life and that was supposed to be you and you leave there thankful and grateful and appreciative glory to god glory to god amen he shall put his hand upon the head of the burnt offering it shall be accepted for him to make an atonement for him oh my hallelujah and by laying his hands upon the head of the offering the person was identifying with the sacrifice his sin and guilt was being moved from himself to the animal that is what that represented oh glory to god that's why all these prophets could be considered righteous because they was able to go and make an offering and they burnt sacrifice and when god accepted that they were as if they were righteous oh glory that's why the bible talked about righteous evil well give the lord a shout god making you righteous because he accepted the offering that was presented on your behalf and when christ this man oh glory to this man when this man offered his blood once for a sacrifice he has perfected forever them that are sanctified we have so much to praise god for so much to be grateful to god fought this morning oh hallelujah hallelujah glory to god glory to god but ram says you identified in your life by your sacrifice that makes you what you are oh glory to god do you believe that oh we're just running too quickly now oh my so this is the prophet now so the high priest stands at the altar the priest here the high priest under the altar and he takes the lamb he examine it over here snatch a lamb and take it or he go into the lamb because they have to have no blemish if you have a blemish i'll take that back when i want that keep that keep that keep that keep to have your perfect sacrifice because that lamb represents jesus christ come on now come on preach back to me somebody that lamb represent christ perfect sacrifice no beaufort lamb don't have blind lamb no ben up lamb no crazy looking lamb oh glory to god it has to be a perfect lamb but when you bring that lamb it was represented christ because he was the perfect lamb that was to come to atone for your sin oh glory to god hallelujah and the worshipper puts his hands upon the lamb and says i confess my sins i broke the sabbath i've done this that the other i have sinned i've done something wrong and the priest kills the lamb catches the blood and pushes over here and burns it at a sacrifice on the brass altar which means divine judgment and as the smoke went up oh glory to god you know it burnt in the smoke we have to go up and as the smoke go up israel fell on his knees and give their prayers as it's bent up the smoke of this blood oh glory to god you must know fire is there because he has smoke oh glory to god as sacrifices being offered and as the smoke go up israel fell on their knees hallelujah hallelujah glory to god i'm going to wrap up here with this just making a bridge with this uh perseverance that we had and we exhorted here um but i'm talking about it doesn't mean to a new page he says that doesn't mean nothing not turn a new page but actually die and be born again you say you've got to feel so guilty when you stand in his presence whether you go to the methodist way or baptist way whatever way you go you've got to be so guilty and feel so guilty till it kill you you know some people don't like to feel bad they're not feeling bad you know they feeling guilty that should have been media god i'm not worthy oh god i come and seek in your grace i seek in your lover seeking your kindness you've got to be so guilty if you're so guilty instead of kill you kill you your worthy life will die right there you got to reckon yourself so guilty in the presence of god your worldly life right there closing this part our souls are placed by faith on his brass altar god's judgment and our offering is consumed when our souls are placed on his divine judgment that is brass when our soldiers placed upon an altar of divine judgment what was the penalty debt so when you put your soul on the altar is to kill you that you will be dead yourself and alive in christ jesus and when you lay yourself up on the altar of god which is pronounced debt upon the sinner how can you raise someday alive in sin if god accepted the sacrifice and i want to say this how could a man claim to have been on that brass altar and still have a heart it is impossible to be burnt at that bass altar and come out with one heart against anybody because when that fire burned you so you know that god forgive you and if god forgive you you mean you can't forgive your brother you can forgive your sister you can't drop your hearts when this alters brotherly kindness in the altar of this age of brotherly kindness and the spirit the holy spirit coming on top brotherly kindness and your whole english and ought and evil and malice and wickedness fire have to get that [Applause] [Music] you maybe said oh minnesota claim you're adopted with oats and grudge all kind of evil foolishness and seedlings congregation with negative and nasty business go go and end up that that's not the word here you know god break mega offering god must accept it you could show whatever often god must accept it and when god accepted fire this fall oh glory to god when god accept your offering and you got to present your body you got to act you got to present your body as a living sacrifice you become the sacrifice upon god's presulta what give the lord a shout because i have a time this morning this is a special service praise god you'll never forget it oh hallelujah but i might say when your sacrifice has been received you are dead when that when that sacrifice is received by fire it goes up like that and the smoke goes up and you rise with the sacrifice into the heavenlies you are sealed away from the things of the world and then you are conceived anew you were conceived on you you once was conceived in iniquity know your conceiva knew oh praise the name of the lord then you become the living word and then he read the scripture here from the future home and he said when the lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughter of zion remember that's the bride and shall have purified the blood of jerusalem that's the remnant of the jews plus the bride in the midst thereof with the spirit of judgment fire that is always cause judgment when he makes his final judgment he calls you he justifies you and he brings you to redemption then his judgment pray for upon you and the holy ghost and fire cleanses away sin oh glory to god oh give the lord a shout hallelujah and when king uzziah died and isaiah went into the temple and he saw the vision of the lord he was high and lifted up and the trail filled the temple and isaiah said woe is me i'm undone i have a man on clean lips and then there comes some seraphs they take calls of the altar there's an altar in heaven oh glory to god that's why you're also on the earth because there's a whole day in heaven and they took the cause above the altar and then touch his lips he said the surfings are the burners the burners oh hallelujah not the explainers not the talkers these airframes are dependent you hear much about writing a message but there's still a burners it's still a fire instead of god's confirmation when you present your sacrifice oh my hallelujah the seraphim she says that this this seraphim was angelic beings and they are the very one next to god right at the altar and they receive the sacrifice it shows the justice of god that sin cannot come in the presence of god unless it has been atoned for oh my oh blessed be the name of the lord so what that tells us friends we can't just go to god empty-handed we have to go to god with the sacrifice oh let's all stand o blessed be the name of the lord take me past the yard accord into the holy place past the praise an altar lord i want to see your face [Music] take me past the crowds of people where the priest sings your prayer lord i hunger first for righteousness [Music] [Music] [Applause] lips amen god bless you we want to tune to the scriptures revelation chapter 5 verse 8 revelation 8 we read 1-6 version 5 verse 8 and when you are taking the book the four beasts and the 4 20 elders fell down before the lamb have had every one of them harps and golden vials full of odors which are the prayers of the saints version 8 11 1 and when he had opened the seventh seal there was silence in heaven about a space of half an hour and i saw the seven angels which stood before god and to them was given seven trumpets and another angel came and stood at the altar having a golden censer and there was given unto him much incense that he should offer it with the prayers of all saints upon the golden altar which is before the throne and the smoke of the incense which came with the prayers of the saints ascended up before god out of the angel's hand and the angel took the censer and fill it with fire off the altar and cast it unto the earth and there were voices and thunderings and lightnings and an earthquake and the seven angels which had seven trumpets prepared themselves to song let's pray father we thank you for your word and lord there's no way i know how to present this it will take you and i ask you to take me out of the way and speak to your people today jesus if there's one time we need to hear from you is today speak to us as we wait on you in jesus name we ask it amen you won't be seated the last message i preached about the seven seals and so on like that i closed with this if jesus had to spend much time in prayer to stay in fellowship with the spirit that was in him how much more do you and i have to spend in prayer much time in prayer if you only knew what time in prayer meant sometimes when you were in prayer god changes the complete destination of different things that is going to happen do you believe that might be something fixing to happen and your prayer could change the whole situation and it's as if god subject himself to the law of prayer and god can't work except you pray there are certain things that he will do but when you pray and intervene that changes everything i'll give you an example when sarah abraham lied to the king and say sarah was his sister and god shot up the womans of everybody in that house and god told the man the king restored to my prophetess wife he said i didn't do no wrong is the man telling me that your sister he said i know that go and let him pray for you in other words god god couldn't undo that until abraham prayed that's the power prayer we're talking about that's the power god put in your hands and that's the power the devil don't want you to see and don't want you to get and i hope today a fresh revelation that will give you a different viewpoint of praying altogether oh glory to god hallelujah could you give the lord a shout this morning oh praise god praise god so the title this morning is getting to the golden altar that's the title this morning get into the golden altar i have an inspiration the only way back to eden is by the altar and through the altar o blessed be the name of the lord do you love him this morning hallelujah exodus chapter 25 and the lord spake under moses saying speak unto the chair of israel that they bring me an offering of every man that giveth it willingly with his heart you shall take my offering yeah just want to offer you know willingly from the heart and this is the offering which you shall take of them gold and silver and brass and you ever wonder where they get all this material from it was the spoils of egypt they didn't leave egypt empty you know they rarely treasury house they take out gold and silver that is why they make gold and calf in the wilderness because they came out with wealth out of egypt are you with me now so god said this is the offering that he shall take of them gold silver brass blue and purple and scarlet fine linen goats here ram skins dyed red pass your skins wood oil for the light spices for anointing oil and for sweet incense ornix stones stones to be set in the effort and in the press plate let them make me a sanctuary that i may dwell among them according to all i show thee after the pattern of the tabernacle and the pattern of all the instruments thereof even so shall he make it and they shall make an act of wood two cubits and a half shall be the elect thereof look how specific god gave him instructions because he wants to come down among them yeah there's coming long show he wants order he wants a system he wants certain things built he wants certain things set up because he wants to come among them people they don't know who he is what glory to god give the lord some praises hallelujah and thou shalt overlay it with pure gold within and without shall thou overlay it and shall make upon it a crown of gold wronged about those shall cast four rings of gold for it and put them in the four corners thereof two rings shall be on one side two rings on the other side oh glory to god because this has to be a portable ack so you tell them put rings on it oh glory to god and put it cold inside and out let's continue and don't shall make styles of and wood and overlay them with gold so it's gold rods going in these rings that they could carry it because they were in the wilderness and god had to move with them and they have to move with god wherever god going they have to go okay the lord has shout and the bible said the lord himself went everywhere with them confirming the word you mean that god will go with us yes he promised it oh give the lord a shout the lord went everywhere confirming the word with signs with wonders with miracles [Music] the staff shall be the ring of the act and they shall not be taken from it and thou shalt put into the act the testimony which i will give thee thou shalt make mercy seat of pure gold two cubits and a half shall be the length thereof and the cuba then i have to break thereof and those shall make two cherubims of gold of beaten work shalt thou make them in the two ends of the mercy seat and make one cherub on one end and the other chair by the other end of the mercy seat and you shall make the terms of the two wing ends thereof and the cherubim shall stretch forth their wings on high covering the mercy seat with their wings and their faces shall look one to another towards the mercy seat shall the faces of the cherubim be and thou shalt put the mercy seat above the ark and in the act thou shall put the testimony that i shall give thee and there i will meet with thee and i will commune with thee from above the mercy seat and between the two trevor beams which are upon the

and saw the altar of god and he went up in the presence of god and whenever he sent one of the presence god told moses make everything on earth as patterned after heaven and when he did he made the act of the covenant put two cherubims to god the act what is it it was the temple was on the altar the throne gods when john was in the spirit he saw the throne gaze he saw the seraphims moses had a physical representation of two gold cherubims which rings touching each other covering the mercy seats they were represented of the throne gods oh glory that presence is guarded that throne is guarded oh glory to god are you with me and when he did he made the anchor the covenant and put two cherubims to guard the throne he told molemoto brass and put their wings touching like this that's exactly what john saw the guard on mercy seat oh my hallelujah you say you must be prepared before you can come into the presence of it let me back up a little bit he said where was it she kind of glory at

is that right well if a sacrifice is an altar is all god wants came was justified then god also he built an altar and he worshiped he put a sacrifice on it and he long and worshipped god but god was displeased because he didn't come the right way so it's not an altar god wanted you know he won the writing on the altar oh give the lord a shout glory to god so cain did what he did but it was not enough cain was jealous of abel because god accepted abel's sacrifice and unable to despise faith by revelation abram take a rock able to take a rock and cut the throat of the lamb able to knew all glories continue seeing that the two boys trying to find favor with god to come back because they know that they were just fresh from the garden of life and they had fell on the other side by the

tabernacle of the congregation and came out and blessed the people and the glory of the lord appeared unto all the people and there came a fire out from before the lord and consumed upon the altar the burnt orphan and the fat when all the people saw they shouted and fell on their face so the first fire that started came from god god started the fire and the priest's ministry was to maintain that fire with wood oh glory to god would clean all the dust that fire is what lit the seven lampstand the coals from that fire is what they burn the incense upon the golden altar the blood that was sacrificed on the brazen altar is what they sanctified the horns on the golden altar once a year oh glory to god hallelujah but god started the fire it was man's fire it was god's fire and when the

their tents and their wives and their sons their little children and moses said hereby he shall know that the lord has sent me to do all these works for i have not done them of my own mind if these men die a common death of all men or if they be visited after the vision of all men then god has not sent me so moses tell them their judgment would not be normal them can't die normal if they die normal god has sent me because they're doing this wickedness let's continue he said watch where we are and the lord but if the lord make a new thing and the earth this is moses now open her mouth and swallow them up with all that are pertained to them and they go down quick into the pit then he shall understand that these men have provoked the lord and it came to pass as he made an end of speaking

israel murmured against moses you know that was good we couldn't that wasn't right know that's why moses asked god who shall send me because their father is troubled i can't go and say god sent me they go beat him they can't come and say he said he said who shall he send me he says tell them i am that i am saying all right let's continue and on the moral the congregation 41 of the children of israel muhammad against the moses and against aaron saying you have killed the people of the lord that's what they said to me all these all you i came to pass when the congregation was gathered against moses and against aaron that they looked towards the tabernacle of the congregation and behold a cloud cover so when them talking to talk here come a cloud the glory of the lord appeared and moses and aaron came before the time of the congregation and the lord speaking the most saying get you up from among this congregation that i may consume them as in a moment and they fell on their face dizzy powder i want to get to and moses said unto iran take a sensor put fire therein off the altar put on incense and go quickly unto congregation and make an atonement for them for dear israel going on from the lord the plague is begun look at moses he's still interceding he's still praying for them wicked people he said aaron take a sense of quick put some incense in it and go in front of the congregation and make an atonement because the rat is already begun you talk about the power of the golden altar the power of the incense the power of prayer what it could do god pronounce judgment and moses get the air and run take a sensor put some incense light it up and go and make an atonement for the congregation oh hallelujah verse 47 and aaron took as moses commanded and ran in the midst of the call now he'll walk his run and miss the congregation isn't that right and behold the plague was begun among the people and he put on incense and millionaire tournament for the people and he stood between the dead and the living oh glory to god hallelujah and he stood between the dead and the living oh could we give the lord a praise offering my god my god my god my god a bride will come to perfection to bring the resurrection a private time between the dead and the living i bribe understand all day without us are not made perfect we who are alive and remain shall not hear not them oh glory to god hallelujah praise god my jesus [Music] and aaron took as moses commanded and ran in the midst of the congregation and you know the plague was begun among the people and he put on the incense and made that one for the people of his 48 and he stood between the dead and the living and the plague stayed and they that died in the plague were 14 700 besides them that died in the matter of korra and aaron returning the moses unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation and the plague state so if he didn't do that more than 14 000 is going to die it's already started but one man come off the golden altar oh glory to god one man was able to break into the golden altar to offer incense at that altar that wasn't prison alternate there was golden altar or give the lord a shout saints bride people headstone tamaracas sons and daughters you have to get to the golden altar you can be insincere and go there you can be hypocritical and go there you could be hypocritical and pray catholic prayers but you can't be hypocritical and go there you're not even getting there oh glory to god because you have to go to the prison order first and that does take up hypocrisy over you you go fire jealousy envy lying evil all of that is judged at the prison altar all glory to god does the judgment alter hallelujah and the incense is offered prayer brother branham he said but christ becoming a high priest of good things to come by a greater and more perfect tabernacle not made with hands neither by the blood of goats and by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place having obtained eternal redemption for us no man can't call jesus by the holy ghost he said now take the old tabernacle first thing they do they enter into the courts the gentile the next was the brazen altar there they washed the sacrifice of the golden lava next was the killing of the sacrifice to sprinkle the blood upon the altar once a year aaron anointed with the rules of sharon perfume and and on the and the oil coming down to his skirts and so on like that and so on like that he said no watch what i'm saying yeah brad i'm tabernacle you had your chance when a man once is anointed with the holy ghost to be adopted into the family of god to be positionally placed by the father and set into a service out there into his purpose of life what god called him to do his walk must be holy holy holy unto the lord so this is no game this is no gimmick this is the truth this is the world and i trust by doing the visuals and little video clips that it will edify you and strengthen you to understand how real this god is and how these things apply to us today you must turn aside and see this no holy holy unto the lord you must believe all of this holy holy unto the lord oh you must you must come over here no holy holy unto the lord isn't that right praise god so moses and elijah they have got the call he said now watch those two prophets remember the gentile bride is have a prophet elijah that's to call them out of their transition the bride just the same as these prophets called the jews or the judaism the christ the atonement the gentile already knows the atonement but it is called the bride back to the original atonement that is what we are called to not the atonement the original atonement that is what applied on the day of pentecost that was the original oh praise god amen hallelujah after the bride is raptured will any foolish voice be saved or will they be lost will the fuller be saved no whatever happens happens now after the time she is in a state now she will have to go through the tribulation period and the reason for it is is because she has rejected the atonement in its fullness she is a believer a professed believer but she will have to go through the tribulation period why because they have not accepted their two minutes fullness because to accept the atonement the atonement take your place you were supposed to die the atonement pay your price so that frees you to serve god that frees you to love god that frees you to become justified as you can never did sin that frees you from holding oughts and grudges and because of what people do to you you go free because of what the blood did oh hallelujah praise god praise god amen brother branham said your daily walk your daily behavior your heart your soul all yours no root of bitterness no nothing else holy holy unto the lord as you begin to approach on behalf of our brother holy holy unto the lord oh praise the name of the lord i beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of god that you present your bodies a living sacrifice muslim come up please holy acceptable unto god which is your reasonable service and be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of god hallelujah so friends there's no way after this service we're going to have unanswered prayer if we just say in prayers and they're saying words that's not content you have to come to god's provided way as you open the door there's a brazen altar oh god i'm sorry i come to lay hands upon that sacrifice i come to repent i come to cry out i come to call upon your name jesus oh hallelujah you love him today praise god hallelujah you can't go to the order of incense without coming to the brazen altar you can't jump and offer prayers to god and god hearing your prayer and you haven't passed through that blood sacrifice that sacrifice is there for you your car passed through each step even after the sacrifice you have to wash your hands wash your feet to get into the holy place and that represent the outer court the body holy place represent the spirit and the

stand before you lord and thank you for today and i pray that you would speak to the hearts of your children and your people and guide them into this walk with you father it's a walk with god all what happened with the time lapse in the wilderness was to come down to the individual where it will address our body our spirits our souls where we could go from the outer courts to the holy place to the most holy place but just before the most holy place is this golden altar father where there's no blood sacrifice to be placed there there's no other offering to go there just incense not strange in sense but the incense that you require from the heart lord jesus father god i pray that the people understand that the calls that burn the incense came from that prison altar the blood that's once a year came from outside lord is all connected together father we need both to approach you lord there was no way we could approach you lord but you made a way for us to approach you lord abel by
