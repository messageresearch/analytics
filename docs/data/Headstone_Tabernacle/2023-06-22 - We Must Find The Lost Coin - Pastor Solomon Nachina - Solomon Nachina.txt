come back for communion because it the rains were so heavy last Sunday we couldn't have communion so we'll be coming back at five amen so let us go straight to the word Luke chapters chapter 5 18 in Acts chapter 2 so let's take Acts chapter 2 verse 37 to 41. this was when the Holy Ghost had fallen and the the manifestation of the spirit was with the apostles the people gathered around what mean is this these are drunk amen then Peter Peter then explained to them what that was all about verse 37 said now when they heard this when they had older Peter had to say when they heard this they were pricked in their hearts and said unto Peter and to the rest of the Apostles men and Brethren what shall we do then Peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for the promise is unto you and to your children and to all that are far off even as many as the Lord Our God shall call and with many other words did he testify save yourself from this untoward generation then they gladly received his word and were baptized and the same day were added unto them about 3 000 Souls that's what the power of the Holy Ghost does to the church amen and then the Book of Luke chapter 15 verse 7 to 10. 7 and I say unto you that likewise Joy shall be in heaven over one sin that repented amen more than over 99 just persons which need no repentance I don't want women having 10 pieces of silver if he is one thus not light a candle shoot the house and seek the little she'll find it and where she has found it she called her friends and her neighbors together saying Rejoice with me for I have found the peace which I had lost likewise I say unto you there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner that repented may the Lord add a blessing to the novice word amen [Music] you may be seated praise the Lord amen so what can we say about Wednesday and Friday services amen praise God oh man listening back to the tapes I don't even believe I free those messages but God is good amen we're going to cut that headstone don't make no mistake about there's a bride on the head there's a people in the land that God has ordained to The Headstone and nothing will stop it praise God and thank God I am in that number I am part of that headstone I'm part of that bright age I shall beware praise glory amen no matter what flood the enemy is raising the spirit of God will raise the standard against the enemy today so for a title I pray we don't keep long I'm sure by maybe 12 o'clock amen so my title is we must find the lost coin that's all that mattered praise God check this your sound is breaking up amen we must find the lost amen so let us see I want to read from Proverbs chapter 8 verse 13. as a background we read them in Sunday school but for the rest of those that were not here I just want to bring a little background to that amen Proverbs 8 13 to 40 said the fear of the Lord is to meet evil we want we won the Lost coin right amen but we just can't have the Lost coin in our own way we must have the law scoring in his way praise God the Lost coin might be in his way not in our way you believe that Hallelujah we must have that lost coin in God's way not in our way praise God so he says that the fear of the Lord is to make evil right we must get evil and we must hate what Pride praise God proud in heart God hates it God wants a humble heart that is the heart that God can work through God cannot wait to a proud Heart A Heart That resents the word God cannot work through that when they heard what Peter has said the Bible said they were pricked in their heart they said men embedding what shall we do they didn't stay in their own idea they were put in their heart and said what shall we do we must come to that today we must humble ourselves to the word we must come prostrate at his feet with the fear of God in our heart what is the fear of God is to wait evil it the fear of the Lord is to hit evil pride and arrogancy and the evil way and the forward forward mouth do I hate you say counsel is mine and sound wisdom I am understanding I have strength so God is understanding God is wisdom God is understanding and God has strength because there is waiting the power to give you strength that you can stay alive in the world that you can live for what you have lost praise God because until we find the lost coin we cannot call unto the neighbors to come and rejoice with us but we must find the lost coin you with me tonight praise God you may be receive it and Proverbs 11 verse 30 he said the fruit of righteous the fruit of the righteous is a tree of life and he that winning Souls is wise are you with me now so we must bring forth fruit and that fruit is the tree of life which is these things if they are in you and are bound so you come down the victims you cannot trade Veterinary temper you cannot Dodge it you've got to have it for the hairstone to come upon it are you with me now we must come to The Headstone we can't budget praise God oh blessed be the name of the Lord amen amen the fruit of righteous is the fruit of the righteous is a tree of life and Christ is the Tree of Life Jesus is the Tree of Life these things are the Tree of Life they are the fruits of the free of God they must be in you and if you have the that's the life that become the fruit of the righteous is a tree of life and he that winneth Souls is wise praise God by Russ said Don't Preach me in sermon leave me a sermon let your life be a living sermon let your life be a living message that the one will see that and glorify God they will say over to you are a son of God of a true you are a daughter of God oh glory to God a thousand only voices walking the streets of tamale praise God that the people can say that seven Thunders is being manifested is being Vindicated oh when your life does that it win souls to the Lord then you become Wise Wise in the word wise in the spirit oh blessed be the name of the Living God oh glory be to the Lord amen you may be seated amen but Abraham said In the Beginning Church age he said one night I was seeking the Lord I wanted to listen very carefully but rather one night I was seeking the Lord the Holy Spirit told me to pick up my pen and write amen as I grab the pen to write his Spirit gave me a message for the church do you want to hear that message do you want to hear what the spirit told him to write to the church okay brother said I want to bring you to you it has to do with the word and the bride another word in the church not aware in the system it has to do with the word and what the bride so our message is to the word of the word and to the bride here it is in quotes here it is what I am trying to say to you this is God talking to the prophet oh aren't you privilege to hear what God Said direct to God's prophet and it was meant for you you never see that here is what I am trying to say to you the law of reproduction is that a specie must bring forth after his own kind every specie must bring forth after his own kind [Applause] so God brings after his kind Satan brings after his kind the things of the world bring after their kind are you following me now so and we must preach it don't tell me I can't preach it I will preach it I would say the things of God and I will show you the things of the devil because everything brings one after his kind but remember praise God the fruit of the righteous is the Tree of Life so we must bring it now for you to bring up the fruits the fruit of the unrighteous is the way of death you get it now oh glory to be to the Living God Hallelujah the law of reproduction is that each species brings forth after its own can be seated and according to Genesis 1 11 and God said let the Earth bring forth grass this is what God is telling the prophet to write Oh Glory to God and the help she you see even God had to bring back the word to the prophet because whatever he said must be in the world so God is quoting back himself he said and God said let the Earth bring forth grass and help yielding seed and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind whose seed is in itself upon the Earth and it was soon whatever life was in the sea came forth into a plant and then into a fruit so whatever you see brings forth a tree then the three now brings for the word fruits so we must produce that thing the structure of a perfect man that is God's tree of life it must bring forth fruits praise him he's not just coming to church this church is not a tree but that is the tree of life that is the tree of God the touch of a perfect man you must be a tree before you can bring forth fruits [Applause] glory to God oh glory be to the Living God and the believer shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of waters for whose leaves are not wider praise God and whatsoever you do it shall prosper you've got to be a tree to bring forth fruits glory to God oh you never see that praise God and the brothers at the very God told the prophet the very same law applies to the church today whatever seeds started the church WIll comfort and be like the Original Seed because it is the same seed in these last days are you ready the two bright Church Christ seed will come to The Headstone oh we're going to come to The Headstone the true bright seed the true bright church we must come which is Christ's seed we must come to The Headstone oh glory be to the Living God so these verses must be rare Faith must be there virtue must be there knowledge must be there tempers must be there because we are a tree of God we are the statue of a perfect man we must produce these fruits oh glory be to the Living God are they too happy today to be the true bright Church to be Christ seed will come to The Headstone and she will be the Super Church oh come on now you will be the Super Church in super ways as she nears him because what you have the world cannot stop it there's going to be power from Heaven not power from the church the power from the body not power from a group but it's going to be power from Heaven that will be in the bride oh come on charge you'll be a super Church you will be a super Church a super race as you near The Headstone oh I thank God today for the promise of his word that promise is not to be is to my children and my children's children today oh glory to God you may be seated hallelujah amen is a day in the bride will be so much like him so much like him we will be in his very image and in his very likeness praise God let us make man in our image and after our likeness say my place for us today praise God they in the bride will be so much like him that they will even be in his very image it is very image praise God that is why it comes back to charity it comes back to the love of God it comes back to the cup Stone because though I speak with tons of men of an angels without that image of God capping me up filling me up brother I am nothing though I have no need to understand every mystery and preach every mystery without the Capstone the very image of God pumping that praise God those vertices in me I am nothing because knowledge shall vanish away but what are they the prophecies they shall fail but whether it's charity charity shall never never fail though you believe that today oh for day that are in the bride you will do so much like him that they will even be in his very image praise God you may be seated why will we be in this image why must we come through that amen this is in order to be United with him do you get it now we've got to be United with twice Oh Glory to God the head must come upon the body we are the body we need the head to be United with him as king of kings a lot of laws his coming praise God and he's coming as king of kings and Lord of lords and we shall reign with him as king and praise Oh Glory to God why must we be in his own image that we can be United with him you never see that this is in order to be United with him they will be one oh you will be one with him I and Christ will be one oh we there will be one they will be the very manifestation of the word of the Living God they the bride the bride the bride will be the very manifestation or of the Living Word of God in other words whatever the word says that is what you are going to live out you are going to be a tree of life oh come on Church the righteous shall be a tree of life we're gonna be a tree of life there's going to be faith and virtue and knowledge living living fear of life oh glory god they will be the very manifestation of the Living Word of God denominations cannot produce this that's the wrong seed they can't produce his life they can't prove that's why they don't even know what this is but it's in the world but it takes a prophet to bring forth the word to the bread that can receive the word oh and plead the promise plead the promise make that your confession make that your confession today I shall have faith I shall have the faith you sealed in me and your body will obey your confession not by might not by power but God promises it to the bride and God cannot fall on his promise every promise there is yours today oh play The Promise today oh denominations cannot produce this they will produce their own Creed and Dogma mixed with the word the mongolization the mongolizing brings forth a hybrid product Hallelujah but thank God we are in the original sin we can be hybrid that is where we are staying in the world because in the beginning was the word the word was with God the Word was God the word was made flesh praise God and today we are made flesh the word in you is made flesh the world made first today is the Bride of Jesus Christ praise God this word must be living out in you thousands of live voices the Thunder that shakes the devil you may be seated Oh Glory to God Amen I'm continuing with what he was writing to the prophet for the other Prophet to write he said the first son Adam was the spoken word seed of God he was given a break to reproduce himself that is why the bread was given to him the bride was not given to Adam For Pleasure he was given for Adam to reproduce after himself because every seed must breathe out after his kind let this be sink down into your soul today that's why your life is not your own you must produce a Life of Christ praise God and whatever way you want to come you better come by the word young people you better come by the word marriage is an institution of God you don't come in otherwise than God's way because any other way is not God's way because it must produce after its kind I hear me now so the word is not for jokes now the word is the word praise be the name of the Lord amen the bride was given to him to reproduce himself that is why the Bible was given to him to reproduce himself to produce another Son of God that is why he was given to Adam to produce another son like Adam so set was to come by Spoken Word Abel was to come by Spoken Word praise God but she fell he fell by accepting another way which is what we all came through that is why we are born in sin and shaped in iniquity but he had to take God to come down himself shed the blood pray the prize to Pardon that way that we came in that we can pick up the stature of God we can pick up the nature of God that we cannot be condemned with the world oh blessed be the name of the Living God blessed be the name of a living God I hope you'll see you tonight then God made a way a way of righteousness with the righteous must walk in there's a Highway to Heaven none can walk up there except the pure in heart except those that take the pure word and walk by the word for you walk by the word you are walking the righteous way because it is only the word that is righteous praise God so God made a way out of no way that we can be brought back into Fellowship again oh blessed be the name of the Lord that what we're coming to finish with him he says there's therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus so no condemnation the sin of Adam cannot get you the sin of him cannot get you now are we the sons of God now we are the sons of God we are the Blackboard Church of the redeemed the Seed of Abraham another sea praise God in the likeness and image of God you may be seated Amen to produce another Son of God but she fell she fell by hybridization she caused him to Die the second son Jesus also a spoken seed word of God was given a bread like us was or Adam but before he could marry her she had also Fallen see she like Adam's wife was put to the tests whether she will believe the word of God and live or doubt the word and die she doubted she left the word she died you get it now please call but I was coming for another one Hallelujah that was coming for another one amen after Christ had paid the price amen he said I go away but I'll send the promise of the father that promise of the father is coming he's going to look for another bride but when that when he gets that bread that bread can never fall because there is no longer man now is now God dwelling in them and God cannot fail God cannot change God cannot lie God cannot be defeated so he comes back as the holy spirit that was the Lost coin that was lost in ages but he said I will restore on the day of Pentacles He restored and they found it and Peter said this is that oh come on church this is that that will lost through all the ages this is that that made a blind for us is to bring indoctrination into the world but we have found that coin that was lost this is that praise God be seated amen so Jesus bride also fell let the word and died then God told the prophetess from a little group of the true seed of the word there's a little group of the true seed of the word God will present Christ with a beloved bride not the pastor represent Christ God will present Christ God will present Christ with a beloved bride she will be a virgin of his work she will that's God talking to the prophet to write I am reading what God Said to the prophet she will she is invasion of his word she is a virgin because she knows no man-made Creed and Dogma ah praise God Oh Glory to God it is written what is written that is what belongs to me knows no man Dogma praise God he said bye and to the members of the Bride will be fulfilled all that was promised of God to be made manifest in the virgin are you with me now this is not better brahm's way this is what God was talking and he was writing The Word of Promise came to the Virgin Mary but that Word of Promise was he who was the Word of Promise Christ was a Word of Promise that what I promise was he himself to be made manifest God was made manifest he himself acted at that time God himself acted right at that time oh and God is acting at this time in some born Sons some few Daughters of God God himself is

acting in the womb of Mary brought forth the manifestation a virgin shall conceive Hallelujah no man man had nothing to do with it praise God so this virtue is nothing you have nothing to do with them God is going to act at that time faith is going to be the best in there that you know the temper and patient goodness God is going to do his own act at that time seal this verses In You by the Holy Spirit oh blessed be the name of our living God hallelujah he himself acted at that time and fulfilled his own his own Word of Promise in the Virgin it was an angel that had brought her the message oh and as an angel brought you the message that you shall be adopted that you shall you shall be perfect that you shall receive the very image of Christ in you that you shall come to The Headstone the angel brought had the message and thank God and Angel has brought us the message of perfection the message of the Holy Ghost itself an angel brought us the message but the angel message was the word of God you get it now but the Brown's message is the word of God but the Angel's message was the word of God Isaiah 9 6 he fulfilled at that time all that was written in of him because she accepted his word to her that's what it is we've got to accept this word to us Mary said bit unto me according to praise God be unto me according to what Thy Word praise God amen be unto me according to that

land is coming in sight even as dears did now Joshua means Jehovah Savior and he represents the end time leader that will come to the church those shall represent the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost today let us stand like Joshua and Caleb even as Paul came to as the original leader Caleb represents those that stayed with the two Joshua oh am I hearing you Caleb represents those that stood through Joshua remember God has started Israel as a virgin with his word but they wanted something different so did the Church of the last day notice how God did not move Israel or let her go into the promised land until it was in his own appointed time none the people might have put pressure on Joshua the leader and said the land is ours let us go and take it Joshua you are all true he said you are all true you must have lost your commission they would have told you sure you are all true you are finished or you have lots of commission you have lost your anointed now the people might have put pressure on him the leader said This Land Is Ours amen Joshua you are all true you must have lost your commission you don't have the power you used to have you need to hear from God and know the will of God and act quickly [Applause] some are adopted already in the message and covered they are taking inauguration for Kobe adopted ah peace something is wrong with you that people said but Joshua was a God sent prophet and he knew the promise of God so he waited for them the bride is waiting we are coming to the headstone [Music] [Applause] seven Thunder seven Thunder we are coming to the headstone whether they believe you they don't believe you we are coming to The Headstone we are waiting on the promise there shall be a seven Thunder manifestation Revival praise God Amen oh you love him you love the love letter of God to the church amen he waited for a clear-cut decision from God and when the time came to move God placed the full leadership in Joshua's hand because he has stayed with the word God could trust Joshua but not the others so will it repeat in this end day [Applause] God must trust the bride not the church so we repeat today [Music] we are saying we are one day there's going to be a manifestation in your midst and you will see Power in the church power in the bride and the Czech member will still stay dead because they fail to take that clear-cut decision God brought to them by the word why because he stayed with the word God could trust Joshua not the others so will he repeat in this end day the same problem the same pressures young people are hearing oh and our time is is so difficult to conform what who like all these boys those these vast cars in the message and ministers are joining them too if you love the world sit down and the things of the world say the love of God is not even in you I don't care who it is called his Vasquez in the message today you see them and you wonder whether they are baboons or gorillas keep the beard you don't even know what that is it's a spirit fashion of the world upon them ministers are caught in that Tommy rot but not here man praise God you either stay clean other stay decent or pack out with the world praise God find the lost Point stay with the word men want to be cecified and want to look like some some sissies your Prophet was clean shaven I will nail it down every time the bunch of

pay with sons and daughters of God [Applause] oh tell me tell me in pleasure today and the pressure is to know God is looking for something that will take him at his word stay with the word the word

27. if the eternal life brought them signs in that day to those who had it the same eternal life will do the same thing today eternal life in them in Peter produce silver and gold I don't have eternal life in William Brown little fish I give you a life huh if that same eternal life was in them doing those signs it has to be in in us today doing the same thing if there's still a bomb in Gilead or is there has those days passed are they gone the god ran out of inauguration for the church God hasn't run out we don't want it the education is there people don't want it and they didn't catch you then now people wake up this thing is true Antichrist they say it's Antichrist injection new people start dying they receive the Antichrist by force because they don't want to die praise God did God run out of inoculation for his church did he do it if he did it woe unto the church but on the day of Pentecost while they were shouting while they were quiet while they were shouting warned to the passage that come again shouting while they were shouting praising God the question came up men and breading what shall we do to become inoculated the question came the question must come from you today men embroidery what shall we do to become inoculated oh church and Dr Simon Peter wrote out the prescription and said this scription is going to be good for you amen and for your children and for every generation and as many as the Lord Our God shall call you can use this prescription repent every everything in the name the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and you shall be inoculated you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit which is God's inoculation for the promises unto you and to your children and to them that are far off even as the Lord Our God shall call today we must get that inoculation why is the virgins not there because we have lost the Lost coin we must find it in order for God to come in him we must find a the Lost coin and as we close up praise God Oh Glory to God we must find that lost coin sure what is the Lost coin the Lost coin was a covenant you see that between the husband and the wife they have to be 10 tablets she wore it on her head to signify ah like the Muslim way the mayafi on the head let a Muslim woman forget this Veil she would run like she's going to die the next second or let that will be falling because you believe that's the husband she's wearing covering over her head so this woman was required by law to wear that 10 tablets not nine and if the husband came and found one lost by law pack out of my house because she would have committed adultery are you following it didn't matter the excuse it didn't matter the circumstances that made that coin to be lost you will be seen as having committed what adultery and therefore you don't deserve to live in a man's place so here was the woman the husband had traveled get it to evening time she found out that one of the coins was not there she was honest she was chased she was pure she was diligent she was sincere she was committed to her husband she hadn't gone out of the house but the coin was lost the husband will not take an excuse for why the coin was lost are you getting me now and so once you realize that the coin was lost she needed to find that coin where I can't find it today if it is today owns Brian throw the rest I can't find it when the husband look by you you let me do you know what I was doing today to be argument you will have your way but she needed to find that coin because the Covenant the law was that without one of those coins you got to go amen and so she had to go searching the second coming of Christ said it was getting to evening time he said she lighted the candle desperation setting she pulled down the cobwebs it was house cleaning time [Applause] she had to clean the house in other words to find the coin because the husband was coming well Christ is coming the Raptor is coming the bridegroom is coming he must find Seven Virtues reflecting out he's coming the head is coming and when it comes fed all the way to broadly kindness charity must be there if it is not there it's evening time it's time to light up the candle it's time to have a house cleaning time it's time to look for that lost coin because when it comes with one coin missing will be counted as adulterers we can't go in with him we can't be in that Kingdom we must find a lost coin praise God amen and so when the husband came but tell your husband came around said the neighbors could see the dust flying this woman is a dirty woman who look at her cleaning power but they didn't know what was going inside they were outside that was flying through the window through everywhere they were complaining and condemning but they did not know why the reason why the dust was flying out so what do you care about somebody criticizing you wanting to dress right wanting to live right wanting to reject the well reject the case of the world what do you care you know why you are doing that you know that you are having a house cleaning don't care what the neighbor says because when he comes it is you and him not you not here and the neighbor not here one criticize it is you and Christ the word what do I care about what somebody will say what some church will say once a minister will say once some people will say it is me and Christ I am having a house cleaning let the dust fly out let the Cowboys praise God let the rubbish be packed out in his eye a Christ Alone [Music] I better look for that lost coin I have lost a coin I must find that coin because when he comes when The Headstone comes he must find out all these virtues are there then we can cement them with Charity I must find the lost corn [Music] you may be seated [Applause] praise God amen Hallelujah praise God oh bird Abraham let me read and get out of here praise God amen the second coming of the Lord paragraph 59. my brother if you want to look it up look in Galatians fight you will find out that woman represented the church and the church is a spouse wife to Christ and the tablet that the church is supposed to wear is found in Galatians 5 which is love joy brings no suffering goodness meekness gentler patience that is the tablet that is supposed to be war in the church broadly love broadly kindness Fellowship [Music] [Applause] [Music] it's time to find bodily love broadly kindness and fellowship that is the tablet the church is supposed to wear foreign people will come and they are going to heaven ah what heaven are you going to that is the tablet that the church must wear are you getting me now and this woman it must have been a long about dark that she realized she had lost one of those coins oh if there was ever a time that the church ought to take inventory to find out if we've got all the coins on it should be now is getting dark the very hands and clouds of destroying civilization is hanging over the Earth is it not happening today a destroying civilization we're talking about this morning artificial intelligence what they are trying to do a prophet is saying that in 1957 the very hounds and clouds of destroying civilization is hanging over the head sin and debunk on every hand we are living in a tremendous time when there's wickedness wickedness look life means nothing to people anymore you can look at your fellow human being take a gun and point him in the chest pain pain yeah I popped him like some balloon no conscience no more feeling wickedness everywhere people who go to church just for a sham people go to church for a sham you know sham fake sham people go to church just for sham is happening today people who go to church to try to hide from their meanness people always go to church and profess Christianity and live like the rest of the world drinking smoking gambling women immorally dressed wearing clothes that they ought not to wear in their own dressing room out on the streets before the public ah beard let me add beard tight skimping trousers ah and Burning Love is a thing that is passing almost probably love is no more there we have not lost one coin but we have lost practically every one of them God have mercy church we need to find this coin message we need to find these lost coins and is getting night my brother and he's getting night remember her husband will return if he found out with one of those coins out it showed that she has been she has been a marked a harlot and if you are defied or defile yourself in any way it was seen by the people they brought it before the priest and brought witness that is found that's that she's been found such and the priest seen that she was a married woman took the coin out of her tablet that she's been doing wrong amen shall be much she has mad her virtue they took that out if she's been flirting showing that she wasn't true to her husband they took the coin out whatever it was they took it out and when the husband returned he found that she had been marked he would divorce her immediately and have nothing to do with such a woman she did not want he did not want such a woman so it was getting along towards dark when she realized that she had lost something time for her husband to come and it's getting late is he getting late on us is he getting late it's time for Christ to return the church better be examining herself by the word of God our purity number one our what purity certification our purity number two our loyalty our Purity to who to God number two our loyalty to rule to

the Church of the Living God in this great hour that we are living now it beholds on us to check up go before God light the candle of the word of the gospel and examine ourselves and find out if we
