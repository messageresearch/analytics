[13:55] opportunity in this Modern Age where oh
[13:58] there's so much distraction there is so
[14:00] much things to try to catch our
[14:02] attention that we could still be caught
[14:04] by fasting and praying we can still be
[14:06] caught by commentary throne and seeking
[14:09] your face father I pray tonight that you
[14:10] would so Inspire word and bless tonight
[14:13] and a special great touch sister Vivian
[14:16] touched wife in a special we visit them
[14:19] with your hidden virtue and strength in
[14:21] Jesus
[14:22] amen amen God bless you and welcome to
[14:26] be here tonight in our
[14:29] I'll try to make this one parameter and
[14:32] I want you to turn the Bibles to Romans
[14:34] chapter 4.
[14:36] the title of what I want to exhort you
[14:37] tonight is becoming more positive
[14:41] this is the thought I want to share with
[14:42] you tonight becoming more positive and
[14:46] we want to look at Romans chapter 4
[14:48] which of your Bible books and just to be
[14:50] sure before we get on into prayer
[14:53] Paul speaks what shall receive them
[14:56] that Abraham or father has put him into
[14:58] the flesh had found for If Abraham was
[15:00] justified by works yet were of the glory
[15:02] but not before God but what said the
[15:06] scripture Abraham believed God it was
[15:08] counted unto him for righteousness now
[15:11] to him that Wicked
[15:15] is the reward not reckon of Greece but
[15:18] to him that we get not but believe it on
[15:21] him
[15:22] here we go that justified the ungodly
[15:26] his fate is counted for righteousness
[15:30] even as David also described the
[15:32] blessedness of the man unto whom God
[15:35] imputed righteousness without work
[15:37] saying blessed are they whose iniquities
[15:41] are forgiven
[15:42] the Muslims are covered blessed is the
[15:45] man whom the Lord will not impute sin
[15:47] Commit This blessedness Then according
[15:50] circumcision only
[15:52] or upon the uncircumcision also
[15:56] for we say that Faith was reckoned to
[15:58] Abraham for righteousness or was it then
[16:01] reckon when he was in circumcision or in
[16:03] consecration not in circumcision but in
[16:07] uncircumcision and he received the sign
[16:10] of circumcision a seal of the
[16:14] righteousness of defeat which he had yet
[16:17] been uncircumcised
[16:20] that he might be the father of all them
[16:22] that believe do they be not circumcised
[16:26] that righteousness might be imputed to
[16:28] them also let's read that verse again
[16:32] and he received
[16:34] the sign of circumcision
[16:37] and Paul went on to identify what that
[16:39] is a seal
[16:41] of the righteousness of the feet when
[16:44] did he have his feet
[16:47] which he had
[16:49] get being uncircumcised
[16:52] that he might be the father
[16:55] of all them that believe though they've
[16:58] been not circumcised that the
[17:00] righteousness might be imputed unto them
[17:03] also and the father of circumcision to
[17:06] them who are not obviously causation
[17:07] only but who also walk in the steps of
[17:11] that fate of our Father Abraham which he
[17:15] had
[17:16] been yet uncircumcised note all is
[17:19] emphasized the position that Abraham was
[17:21] him the fact that he was uncircumcised
[17:24] and he had the sweet
[17:25] for the promise here we go that he
[17:28] should be heir of the world was not to
[17:30] Abraham or to receive through the law
[17:33] but to the righteousness of faith for if
[17:36] they which of the law be is Faith is
[17:38] made void promised made of non-effect
[17:41] because the law will get right and where
[17:43] they know where no law is there is no
[17:46] transgression
[17:47] therefore
[17:49] this is the crooks of it it is a fate
[17:53] why that it might be by grace
[17:56] to the end the promise might be sure to
[18:00] all the seed not for that only which is
[18:05] of the law but that also which is the
[18:08] feet of Abraham with the father of Allah
[18:11] so this is the part I want to get to
[18:12] who's 17. as it is written I am needy a
[18:17] father of many nations
[18:19] before him whom he believed even God
[18:22] who quick met the Dead
[18:24] I'm calling those things which be not as
[18:26] though they were who
[18:29] against hope
[18:30] believed in Hope
[18:32] that he might become the father of many
[18:34] nations according to that which was
[18:36] spoken so shall I see be and be not weak
[18:40] in faith this is a pattern of in faith
[18:42] he considered not his own body now dead
[18:46] when he when he was about 100 years old
[18:48] neither yet the deadness of serious
[18:50] woman
[18:51] he's Target not but the promise of God
[18:55] through unbelief what was strong in feet
[18:58] giving glory to God
[19:01] and this is our anchor point tonight and
[19:04] being fully persuaded that
[19:07] what he had promised he was able to
[19:10] perform because three that God promised
[19:12] you Deliverance healing Breakthrough
[19:15] Revival Holy Ghost Dynamics adoption
[19:20] being fully persuaded that what he had
[19:23] promised he was able also to perform
[19:26] and therefore it was imputed to him for
[19:28] righteousness no it was not written for
[19:30] his sake alone but it was important to
[19:32] him but for us so you're taking it to
[19:35] yourself now for us also to whom it was
[19:37] imputed if we believe on him that raise
[19:40] up Jesus our lord from the dead who was
[19:43] delivered for our offenses and was
[19:46] raised up for justification like God
[19:48] bless his word
[19:49] I'm going to bring
[19:52] when Jesus of Nazareth was here on Earth
[19:54] he never used his power yet
[19:58] he was God manifested in flesh
[20:02] he never uses power when Satan come
[20:05] against him
[20:06] he said it is written
[20:07] he had to do that because he broke down
[20:10] on that and what he lost Christ with him
[20:14] where evil had done Christ fortified
[20:17] again it is written man shall live by
[20:21] bread alone it is written Thou shalt not
[20:23] tempt the Lord thy God it is written it
[20:25] is written what is it he stayed with the
[20:28] original artillery but Eve let down she
[20:32] began to listen to reason
[20:33] you know there are people today who can
[20:36] almost reason you write down and prove
[20:38] to you that the thing is wrong
[20:41] Satan was very successful with Eve what
[20:45] does reasoning do
[20:46] it makes it appealing
[20:49] now please don't get me wrong now sorry
[20:51] a man come to a place he wants religion
[20:54] he wants to be safe he doesn't want to
[20:56] go to hell no human being wants to put
[20:58] that up please it wasn't made for human
[21:00] beings it was made for the devil and his
[21:02] angels it wasn't meant for human beings
[21:04] but the human being sends himself there
[21:07] go through every red light he can across
[21:10] it and the people fight right on Beyond
[21:12] it before you can become an unbeliever
[21:15] you have to bypass fate and God's word
[21:17] fist before you can become an unbeliever
[21:20] you have to run the red light of god
[21:22] notice
[21:23] Satan needed appealing and sin is
[21:27] appealing so sin is not just but I said
[21:30] no no it's a pillar it's attractive it
[21:32] draws you it pulls up to you it's
[21:34] appealing he makes it educational
[21:37] intellectual and then the prophets that
[21:40] did not the Holy Ghost tell us II
[21:41] Timothy 2 chapter that there will come
[21:43] an intellectual group in the church
[21:46] heavy
[21:47] I mind it love lovers of Pleasures more
[21:50] than lovers of God in the church Jewish
[21:53] Breakers in the church false accusers in
[21:55] the church in continent despite of those
[21:57] that are good you see them as Communists
[21:59] who know them is so-called Christians
[22:02] having a form of godliness but denying
[22:05] the power thereof and the power is the
[22:08] word made manifest the power is what the
[22:12] word made manifest one more time the
[22:14] power is what the word need manifest he
[22:18] said the gospel come to us not two word
[22:20] only but to power and demonstration of
[22:23] the spirit
[22:24] Satan makes it appeal and certainly it's
[22:27] appealing sin is appealand but the enemy
[22:29] keeps finding a better deed he will
[22:32] powerful woman do this do that don't
[22:35] worry he will never make a completely
[22:37] naked but he'll be horrible then he
[22:39] knows just what to do but Satan keeps
[22:42] bringing sin in and that was the
[22:44] original sin now watch here we go
[22:46] there's a part we want to get to know
[22:48] but God doesn't have to do anything more
[22:52] to his to make it any more appeal the
[22:55] only thing he has to do is just raise up
[22:59] a standard of his own word against the
[23:02] enemy
[23:03] when the Bible said when the enemy come
[23:05] like a flood the spirit of God raises
[23:08] the standard against it what does he do
[23:10] he he makes here we go the same word
[23:14] that he already said more positive
[23:19] taken his same word
[23:21] and making it more positive
[23:23] and I will interject here
[23:25] when the time is not yet
[23:28] so in other words
[23:31] when uh Elohim came up here to Abraham
[23:36] he didn't come to change Imam body there
[23:39] and then
[23:40] he came to make the same word Abraham 25
[23:44] years ago more positive
[23:46] by telling Abraham I was certainly
[23:50] return unto D now think about you know
[23:51] you're waiting for 20 something years
[23:54] for this world to be manifested that God
[23:56] promised and here the angel come down
[24:00] and speaks to you and said you know what
[24:02] I will return unto thee according to the
[24:05] time of life so in other words he run
[24:07] you down 25 years and introduced time of
[24:10] life because a God we serve is declared
[24:13] by time and season on the under this one
[24:16] for everything
[24:17] season and time I I said that to fulfill
[24:21] my word so I hope you get out tonight so
[24:23] watch this now he take the same word and
[24:26] make it more positive because the time
[24:28] is not here another scripture it
[24:31] connects pretty fast in today and what
[24:33] Daniel saw and and this is Daniel
[24:36] chapter 9 you don't have to find it I'll
[24:37] read it in the year of Darius the son of
[24:39] persuas of the seed of the meats which
[24:41] were the king over the realm of the
[24:42] challenges in the first year of his
[24:44] Reign I Daniel understood by books the
[24:49] number of years where of the word of the
[24:51] Lord in the Jeremiah the prophet that he
[24:53] should accomplish 70 years in the
[24:55] desolation of Jerusalem and I set my
[24:58] face under the Lord God to seek like
[25:01] prayer
[25:02] and supplication with fasting and
[25:07] Lord and Ashes so to seek the Lord it it
[25:12] takes some stuff it takes other things
[25:14] and Daniel was seeking the Lord because
[25:16] he saw something written by Jeremiah the
[25:19] prophet that stood him and motivated him
[25:22] that drove him to pray in that season
[25:24] was nearing the end for that time
[25:27] it was full and I pray unto the Lord
[25:29] my God and made my confession I said oh
[25:32] Lord I wouldn't read all the great and
[25:34] Dreadful God keeping the Covenant and
[25:36] mercy to them that love him and them
[25:38] that keep his Commandments we have
[25:40] sinned committed iniquity I've done
[25:43] wickedly and I've rebelled evenly
[25:45] passing from the perception from the
[25:47] judgments leader have we happened unto
[25:49] thyself of the prophets I'll stop right
[25:51] here through six if you have time
[25:54] that I need chapter nine you can read
[25:56] the whole thing okay so he went long and
[25:58] Saturday notice he didn't say I'm Union
[26:00] right just one Lord I go to church and
[26:02] I'm this and I am that no no he was
[26:04] pleading for God's people
[26:06] no chapter 10
[26:09] of them Daniel in the year of Cyrus King
[26:12] of Prussia a thing was revealed unto
[26:15] Daniel whose name was dirty father
[26:17] and the thing was true
[26:20] but the time
[26:21] appointed was long
[26:24] and he understood the thing
[26:27] and had
[26:28] understanding of the vision you know
[26:30] brother Brown didn't present like topics
[26:34] like people tried to present it as if he
[26:35] read about Supreme
[26:38] what he brought was a vision what a
[26:41] prophet sees is a vision
[26:44] and all the historical mysteries that we
[26:48] wasn't clear about but that wasn't his
[26:50] message that was just something to be
[26:51] done as prophesied and promised but he
[26:54] says you will be given a message that
[26:56] would for run my coming that message
[26:58] have to do with preparation getting a
[27:00] people prepared that message is not
[27:02] about joining Church the investment
[27:04] about staying in church that message
[27:05] about getting prepared for the community
[27:07] lord ifura said the angel of God is on
[27:10] it now fixing things are wrong for his
[27:13] coming so when the thing is true
[27:15] and the time is long
[27:18] let me go again Daniel says a thing was
[27:20] revealed
[27:21] and the appointed time was long he
[27:25] understood the thing and he understood
[27:27] the vision now if we understand this
[27:30] thing that was revealed by this market
[27:32] for Prophet because he said when you see
[27:34] the mean thing the rest will just fill
[27:36] the material it's kind of like a gift
[27:37] and you have a watch or or some perfume
[27:40] or cologne in a box and have all kind of
[27:43] free things around it the fruity things
[27:45] is part of the gift packaging but the
[27:47] thing is the cologne or the watch or
[27:49] whatever it is that's the real thing so
[27:51] when you see that thing everything else
[27:52] is full of material it's just like
[27:54] Cyclones so when the thing is true and
[27:57] the time is long God raises the standard
[27:59] by making
[28:01] the same word and making it more
[28:04] positive
[28:05] oh is the vision is always from the
[28:09] point of time then you have to wait for
[28:11] it you should write division sneak it
[28:12] clean that he had readers have been run
[28:14] for the vision is for an appointed time
[28:16] declaration ten people like to step up
[28:19] so it's seven in the days of the 47th
[28:22] Angel when he shall begin the song the
[28:24] mission of God will be finished but the
[28:26] scripture doesn't end there in verse 8
[28:28] it says I'm the voice which I heard from
[28:31] him speaking to me again said go take
[28:33] the little book which is open the hand
[28:35] of the Angel which stands it up on the
[28:37] Sea on the earth and I went under the
[28:39] angel and said unto him give me the
[28:42] little book he said unto me take it eat
[28:44] it up it shall make thy belly bitter but
[28:47] it shall be in thy emotionless honey and
[28:49] in this scripture here John was tight
[28:51] and bright it was typing you and I
[28:53] there's not Pastor Prophet teacher
[28:55] evangelist and who up there who calls
[28:58] so-called up there this is for all of us
[28:59] to take the book and eat it up not eat
[29:02] some that that uses that chewing gum and
[29:05] and both instead take what you want and
[29:07] leave up wait no eat the whole book is
[29:09] it it shall make that very bitter it
[29:11] shall be like most honey I took the
[29:13] little book out of the Angel's hand eat
[29:16] it up in my mouth sweet as honey as soon
[29:18] as I've eaten it my belly was bitter
[29:20] here we go and he said unto me what thou
[29:23] must prophesy again before many nations
[29:26] peoples Nations tongues and kings and he
[29:30] Amplified that verse 11 says then they
[29:32] said unto me you are to make a fresh
[29:34] prophecy concerning many peoples and
[29:37] reasons Admissions and language and
[29:40] kicks so now with all these years by
[29:43] echoing what the prophet brought the
[29:46] prophetic utterance that was released by
[29:48] this prophet of Malachi 4 we were
[29:49] prophesied that that Dynamics to the
[29:52] mechanics they're going to be a 700
[29:53] Revival they're gonna be a perfect
[29:55] Church there could be a faithful
[29:56] Ministry all these things are prophecies
[29:58] because the time is not yet because
[30:00] there is a standard by making it more
[30:03] positive especially after the thing has
[30:06] been revealed and the time has been
[30:08] known for people get wary because they
[30:10] get tired they can't afford to get very
[30:12] untied right now we are nearing the
[30:14] corner he's taking the same word the
[30:16] same word in the spoken books the same
[30:18] word in the Bible and making it more
[30:21] positive now he was talking about job
[30:23] here Joe had no bible to read in this
[30:25] day he only went by inspiration he was a
[30:28] prophet For Whom the word of Lord comes
[30:30] to he had only to be inspired because he
[30:34] knewed his position
[30:36] he was God's Prophet the only thing had
[30:38] to happen was for the inspiration to
[30:40] strike him then he knew what he said
[30:42] would happen because it was by
[30:44] inspiration
[30:45] they said what do you drop here drop a
[30:47] bomb right here and he said that is what
[30:48] the church if it is in order settled
[30:52] order
[30:52] it's got the mechanics ready it only
[30:55] needs the Dynamics tonight if
[30:58] we will get the mechanics ready
[31:00] and the first thing he said is not about
[31:03] vials and wolves a woman in his son and
[31:06] they see you let me come there's no he
[31:08] said get our hearts right the things
[31:11] that we can do follow every word follow
[31:14] me baptism follow him in every order he
[31:16] told us to do get every mechanic ready
[31:19] and stand there then we are ready for
[31:21] Dynamics to be lit off and only God can
[31:24] do that that's to drop into your heart
[31:26] that faith that says I am now healed
[31:28] okay
[31:29] question tonight have you done
[31:32] all that you can do
[31:35] if there are still things outstanding
[31:38] you are actually falling short
[31:41] you have to know that you have done
[31:45] all that you can do with what God has
[31:49] given you
[31:50] let me say that again we've seen again
[31:52] you have to be clear in your heart that
[31:55] you have done all what you can do and
[31:58] you could not wait
[31:59] and if God doesn't respond you can still
[32:03] read
[32:04] in confidence
[32:06] and in feet knowing that God can't lie
[32:09] because it had to have something in
[32:11] Abraham's that brought him to the spot
[32:13] where he was fully persuaded and the
[32:16] words expressed in the scriptures it's
[32:17] not by chance uh you know as a term that
[32:21] I love very much they probably said well
[32:23] Abram came into the fullness of
[32:25] believing
[32:26] so there are stages of believing we grow
[32:29] in feet we grow in believing we grow in
[32:32] that World Cup we grow in maturity we
[32:35] have to grow and as we really learn we
[32:38] grow the growth we really learn if
[32:40] you're not growing you're not learning
[32:42] anything you're just stagnant so Abraham
[32:45] had to come to that place where he was
[32:48] extremely positive that God was going to
[32:52] fulfill what he promised and that is
[32:54] where I get the inspiration from tonight
[32:56] to share with you becoming more positive
[32:59] some people are negative beasts and God
[33:01] help them the first thing they see is
[33:03] the glasses half empty as opposed to the
[33:05] glass half full they just see people
[33:08] Negative they see tush Negative they see
[33:10] Minister Negative they always have
[33:12] something to pick up find fold with and
[33:15] God help them because that's not how
[33:17] we're gonna get in channel of your
[33:19] confidence but the band said that job
[33:21] had a Channel of communication to God
[33:23] and required by inspiration he had a way
[33:26] of moving himself out and letting God
[33:29] move in he know he was justified it was
[33:33] a gift it was a gift for the people not
[33:34] virtual for the people and that's all
[33:37] Divine gifts are the three of God's
[33:39] people Everyone is not ordered to be a
[33:41] prophet all is in order to pray for the
[33:43] sick all are not ordered to be pastors
[33:45] and so forth but it's the channel that
[33:48] God has opened to them and even as we
[33:51] had this morning no man has no business
[33:53] deviating in the next man's Channel no
[33:56] matter how inspired it seems like David
[33:59] was inspired all the people shouting and
[34:01] glorifying God for a reason that
[34:04] seemingly exactly scripture but he was
[34:05] the wrong person that inspiration should
[34:07] have come to Nathan not David and the
[34:09] devotional Prophet with inspiration it's
[34:12] not books it's on tips and we have to
[34:14] get of the same anointing and fire and
[34:17] presence and Holy Ghost I was upon that
[34:19] Prophet to see on the kitchen and work
[34:21] with it let's continue I want to keep it
[34:23] too long all right so what he says now
[34:27] watch Joe was the product for his day
[34:29] the only thing God had done to you was
[34:32] to give him he gave him wisdom and his
[34:34] word and inspiration he could get no
[34:36] inspiration so there's this position
[34:38] towards him but he node all his
[34:41] mechanics he had offered the boat
[34:42] offering he had done everything he know
[34:44] to do was right but he couldn't get a
[34:46] word from God get his part but the devil
[34:49] couldn't move him
[34:50] you can't hear from God
[34:52] you want to go to our party a career
[34:55] from God
[34:56] you stop reading your Bible and stop
[34:58] praying you can't hear from God yes yes
[35:05] you're weak
[35:07] you're kind of a hot water plant you
[35:10] need some water and we just drink some
[35:11] water and something like that he said he
[35:13] couldn't get away from God but the devil
[35:15] could move him there you are now there
[35:18] you are when you prayed for you don't
[35:19] have to run back to a line or get
[35:21] somebody else pray for you when you know
[35:24] you have done exactly what God told you
[35:26] to do then wait for that child of
[35:28] inspiration to open up to you and now
[35:31] I'm Healed when it drops in there it's
[35:34] all over you don't need no prayer line
[35:35] nothing else praise the Lord so friends
[35:38] I I was excited to come to share this
[35:40] with you today tonight because I got
[35:42] this morning but after four or after
[35:43] three or whatever and I got this thing
[35:45] to share with you so that's why I want
[35:47] to see what the Lord will do with it
[35:48] what the law will do it in your heart
[35:50] and I trust him that God will write
[35:51] something in your soul that will draw
[35:53] close to him and I read this quote and I
[35:54] read it again a minister trying to bring
[35:56] a Revival that's why you here tonight is
[35:58] so important there's no preacher on
[36:00] breaking Revival he doesn't attack it
[36:02] with him the only thing he can do is
[36:04] just to be loyal to God and his word and
[36:07] the Revival has to come by the people in
[36:09] your home in your life your Revival is
[36:12] not new members it should revive means
[36:14] to bring back all right let's go
[36:16] the hope is wanting and feet is another
[36:19] faith is a positive sense
[36:22] it is not guesswork you don't imagine it
[36:26] it's just as real as any other sense of
[36:29] your body just the same as sight is
[36:31] sight is real hearing is real see teeth
[36:35] smell feel here the five senses of body
[36:38] that control the body they are real
[36:40] faculties to you if none of them is
[36:42] injured then feet here we go is just as
[36:45] real as any of those other five senses
[36:48] and more real because it will go in and
[36:51] above those five senses praise God do
[36:54] you believe that tonight but about you
[36:56] continue now I Believe In All My Life by
[36:59] God's grace he brought me to
[37:01] confirmative
[37:02] deep call into the deep I have found two
[37:05] wires
[37:06] it's not carefully since I have found
[37:09] two wires that will bring the visible
[37:13] power of God
[37:15] for Divine Healing into the individual
[37:19] the two things I find one of them is
[37:22] love
[37:23] the other is feet
[37:25] and they are sweethearts When Love gets
[37:28] married to feet love always accompanies
[37:32] feet
[37:33] when you love God enough
[37:36] to know that he can't lie to you glory
[37:40] it will create a fate and dear that will
[37:42] make you believe his word and every word
[37:45] he said is positive truth
[37:49] and you accept it with unadulterated
[37:53] feet and you won't say no it will
[37:55] produce exactly what he said it would do
[37:57] the Deep call to a deep forget not all
[38:00] his benefits who forgive thine
[38:02] iniquities who heal it all like diseases
[38:04] and if you expect him to get help from
[38:07] God and that's what we're here tonight
[38:08] God will meet your expectancy he always
[38:11] does whether you go whatever you do will
[38:15] you will expect what you expect brings
[38:18] your feet if you come say well there's
[38:20] nothing to it that's just the way you
[38:22] will go back home with nothing to eat if
[38:24] you come tonight and say well if I don't
[38:25] get prayed for a gum and I won't be
[38:27] healed that's just the way you will go
[38:29] if you come in tonight and say I come
[38:31] for one Soul Purpose that is to contact
[38:33] Christ for my body or my soul he will go
[38:36] home just as happy as you can be for you
[38:38] will contact him now no matter what the
[38:40] opposition looks like Christ is the
[38:42] answer oh glory to God faith brings
[38:45] Christ notice 80 years old white beard
[38:48] right here yet the old man went around
[38:50] telling people he wasn't going to die
[38:52] until he seems the Lord's Christ talk
[38:54] much Simian what a beautiful picture of
[38:57] the Fate knows no defeat fate is perfect
[39:00] fate brings things when there is no
[39:02] things to be brought Faith creates Faith
[39:05] takes doubt away takes negative and make
[39:07] positive oh it's a bit Dreadful thing to
[39:10] hear the levers talk negatively and when
[39:12] they talk negative and their negative
[39:14] beings they create an atmosphere around
[39:16] them that you don't feel comfortable
[39:18] with and you do not like to be around
[39:19] that person you do not want that person
[39:21] to be around you because they generate
[39:23] we will see this with negative Vibes but
[39:26] so that means that person is really
[39:27] short of feet they are talk they are
[39:29] talk they are complaints and complaints
[39:31] and they will bear you or whatnot but
[39:34] they don't have it because what happened
[39:35] faith is positive they takes doubt we
[39:39] takes negative and makes it positive how
[39:41] beautiful the old man had a basis for
[39:44] faith faith is not mythical something
[39:46] mentally worked up it's an absolutely
[39:49] fundamental result that happens in
[39:52] person's heart when feet is appropriated
[39:54] then it is something in the person's
[39:56] heart it can't be based on well and 133
[39:59] or while pray to our post is got to have
[40:02] a foundation or praise God hallelujah
[40:05] how much more Foundation could you
[40:08] please your feet on in any level than
[40:10] the word of God Jesus said heaven to
[40:12] pass away but my word will never pass
[40:14] away then it is a fact that God's word
[40:18] is eternal and the Very world that we
[40:21] are sitting on on top tonight is nothing
[40:22] more than the word of God materialized
[40:25] he spoke the words that let there be and
[40:27] the world came into existence all things
[40:29] that you see was made by faith in the
[40:31] spoken word of God let there be and they
[40:33] believe his own word well after
[40:35] Redemption and a taste of God in our
[40:38] souls and heart how much more are we to
[40:40] be through our feet on what God give us
[40:42] the promise for and send Jesus to die
[40:46] and redeem us to that promise here this
[40:48] big one here
[40:50] there's some Dr Moses for the ground
[40:53] no my work for the Lord
[40:56] is to try
[40:58] to bring that person up to this level
[41:01] where their faith becomes not negative
[41:04] but positive oh this is the language so
[41:07] you can finish here tonight he says work
[41:10] is to bring the person up to the level
[41:13] where their feet becomes not negative
[41:16] but positive
[41:18] I have seen people come on the platform
[41:19] say hi do you believe I've got all Faith
[41:21] by the problem no I don't mean to be
[41:23] belittling them I respect that but
[41:25] they're supposed to be up here and here
[41:28] they are way down here but do you know
[41:30] what it is it's hope instead of faith
[41:32] state does the job right now hopes hope
[41:35] for it but fit is the product Faith
[41:38] really does it we have lots of Hope but
[41:40] not much Faith so we want to change from
[41:43] Hope to day positive feet and there's
[41:47] only one way we can get positive defeat
[41:50] that is by positive thinking
[41:54] of positive things can I read it again
[41:57] for you
[41:58] so we want to change
[42:00] from Hope to day
[42:02] to positive fate
[42:04] and there's only one way we can get
[42:07] positive feet that is by positive
[42:11] thinking of positive things
[42:14] when that intellectual feat comes down
[42:17] in an intellectual in a little
[42:19] compartment here it becomes positive
[42:21] so you remember you remember sometime
[42:23] you hear he said most of our feet is
[42:25] intellectual feet heavy mental
[42:27] conception of God God is good God is
[42:29] right God is love and everything else
[42:30] but until it drops from the head to the
[42:34] heart
[42:35] it's kind of problematic somebody could
[42:37] all talk you somebody could tell you
[42:38] something and convince you and set you
[42:41] off way it was what you thought you were
[42:43] strong on and the least so there wasn't
[42:45] really a real Uncle deal that's why
[42:47] Jesus could say Upon This Rock I'll
[42:49] build my church and the geese effect
[42:50] cannot reveal against it because he knew
[42:52] when that rock or Revelation strikes in
[42:55] the human heart even though devil could
[42:57] take that out it is Uncle it is
[43:00] permanent it is fixed no church nobody
[43:03] no pastoral talk no negative no gossip
[43:07] nothing could shake that because if the
[43:09] father has revealed this unto you that's
[43:12] what the Revelation is not you read in a
[43:14] book or your study or you have the
[43:15] information but you have what they call
[43:17] Divine Revelation on the line that would
[43:19] divine all right so let's see how we
[43:22] could just wrap here quickly
[43:24] so you talk about the intellectual feat
[43:26] and he said if you're really sure that
[43:29] what God does he moves right in and
[43:31] takes that intellectual feet and speaks
[43:33] it down into the human heart and when it
[43:35] comes into the heart here we go it
[43:37] becomes positive
[43:39] a way that is God himself moves into the
[43:41] human heart and makes that a positive
[43:43] fact when that faith comes out of the
[43:45] Mind
[43:46] into the human heart you see what I mean
[43:48] and then he said like Abraham we call
[43:50] the things that were not as though they
[43:52] were he took God at his word the reason
[43:55] he was able to perform what he had
[43:57] promised the trouble of it is with the
[43:58] church today we come with hope instead
[44:01] of feet feet is positive here this big
[44:04] one Faith needs no booster fate lose
[44:07] what he's talking about faith is strong
[44:10] faith has hairs on the chest it speaks
[44:12] and the rest of them shut up symptoms
[44:14] can't even speak at all when real God if
[44:16] it speaks it's it knows where it's at
[44:20] hold on
[44:22] about a thing about finishing up
[44:26] but your feet
[44:27] when feet is positive
[44:31] here is what you cannot
[44:34] you cannot be too positive
[44:38] I think I think that's the ending
[44:42] believe it or not
[44:43] you you cannot be too positive
[44:46] you know there are some people
[44:48] the a problem come up and you if you
[44:51] listen carefully you're only talking
[44:52] about the problem
[44:54] they're only talking about the situation
[44:56] only talking about the conditions they
[44:58] are not speaking Solutions
[45:01] I mean I mean corporate free to my soul
[45:03] and I just thank him for that I'm
[45:04] grateful to God and I'm a person that
[45:07] always looking for what's the solution
[45:08] okay this happened that happened what do
[45:10] we do how do you get out of this what is
[45:13] the next move I cannot just stay with
[45:15] all all negative negative oh this is so
[45:18] dread it's so black the sky is black
[45:20] there's no ring there's no sound there's
[45:21] no this there's not that right but when
[45:24] you get through all the negative where
[45:25] is the Positive Vibes that that
[45:28] identifies that you trust God you know
[45:31] come like but I'm talking about the man
[45:33] with the horse horse and buggy riding
[45:34] riding he said he had feet until he he
[45:36] will break he said that he turned down
[45:38] feet when things go wrong this is what
[45:41] show what kind of feed that you have so
[45:43] this is it tonight I trust that it was
[45:45] and you find it helpful to you that you
[45:47] have to become more positive if you're a
[45:49] negative person and say God take that
[45:51] negativity over me and help me to see
[45:54] the right pictures and then you see
[45:56] Regina's bedroom you will see people who
[45:59] not strong as you or weaker than you as
[46:02] your brother and sister and there's not
[46:04] to beat them up and rough them up they
[46:06] haven't got that whole effect like you
[46:08] have and that's why the Bible institutes
[46:11] it on a summer's compassion making a
[46:13] difference making a difference between
[46:14] brute peace and bad attitude and bad
[46:16] spirit and those are the weak and
[46:18] struggling and they really love the Lord
[46:19] and they just can't seem to master that
[46:22] kind of faith that they need to have in
[46:23] this hour we need God's strength people
[46:27] are getting weary tired Fed Up why
[46:30] because the promise is true but the time
[46:32] is long we have been prophesying of
[46:34] these things for so many years we have
[46:36] gone from black here to gray here and
[46:38] the promise is still true God can't lie
[46:41] Abram who is the father of Faith he
[46:44] proved to us that we could be have that
[46:46] seed of the righteousness of the
[46:48] circumcision of God by the Holy Ghost by
[46:49] the living and trusting God and I
[46:51] believe about all my heart you could
[46:53] stand there as a Christian and the other
[46:55] son rain come Sunshine whatever it is if
[46:58] you think your tongue is a soldier he
[47:00] said dying on the hospital bed is still
[47:02] going on as a soldier you're not going
[47:04] on at somebody who is you know I mean
[47:07] you never believe all you never had an
[47:10] experience with God but you come to the
[47:12] place where you could trust the Lord so
[47:14] don't be wary don't be tired don't give
[47:17] up don't let go right now let your feet
[47:19] grow
[47:20] take that that if it become positive you
[47:23] become more positive you have to become
[47:26] more positive because you want the
[47:27] people that is fully persuaded when they
[47:30] come to the church when they come to the
[47:31] provision that God is set this meeting
[47:34] up tonight god Set this time a prayer
[47:36] tonight if you pray for 10 minutes five
[47:38] minutes three minutes may it be a
[47:40] faithful prayer may it be a positive
[47:43] prayer say God I'll be negative on my
[47:45] life it's almost like if you expect
[47:47] things not to work for you you have had
[47:48] so much negative experiences that you
[47:50] believe that your life is like a living
[47:52] blight a living negativity that you
[47:54] haven't seen nothing positive nothing
[47:55] you're working out and as long as you
[47:57] keep saying that talking that nothing
[47:58] will work out but if we could just
[48:01] change your spiritual tonight and say
[48:02] God I'm not going to work or become
[48:04] trusting me I know I'm going to work out
[48:05] because your word that by positive
[48:08] attitude positive thinking positive a
[48:11] reaction everything else I will get a
[48:13] positive foot from god let's borrowhead
[48:14] heavenly father thank you tonight for
[48:17] all these Believers gathered here to
[48:19] hear this exhortation that I believe you
[48:20] give me to give them and I did what you
[48:23] give me I give it to them Lord to become
[48:25] more positive Lord made me forget the
[48:28] past all the negativity may they drop it
[48:31] tonight it's a night be a night of
[48:32] dropping pass dropping their fears
[48:35] dropping their weakness dropping
[48:37] everything behind and say God I come to
[48:39] you we hear the word and I believe in
[48:41] barakati so testimony a couple of weeks
[48:42] ago he shared what the Lord told him in
[48:44] his weak and low hour and father your
[48:46] Prophet identified as long as we are on
[48:49] the earth sinner drunkard prostitute
[48:51] doesn't matter the blood as a bumper
[48:54] covers Us it's only when we cross the
