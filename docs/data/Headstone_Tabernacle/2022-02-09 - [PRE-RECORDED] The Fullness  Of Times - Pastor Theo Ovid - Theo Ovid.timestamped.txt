[27:58] we want to look at first corinthians
[28:00] chapter 10 want to read 1-11
[28:03] ephesians chapter 1
[28:05] when the word read from verse 3-10
[28:09] thank you musicians
[28:12] greetings in jesus name to you all
[28:14] welcome
[28:15] written to all those connected to us on

[28:18] welcome you to our
[28:20] sunday morning worship fellowship
[28:24] unto god
[28:29] daniel chapter 12
[28:31] relevance one to four
[28:35] and at that time shall michael stand up
[28:38] the great prince
[28:39] which standeth for the children of thy
[28:41] people
[28:43] and that there shall be a time of
[28:45] trouble
[28:46] such as never was since there was a
[28:48] nation
[28:49] even to that same time
[28:51] and at that time
[28:53] thy people shall be delivered
[28:56] everyone that shall be found written in
[28:58] the book
[29:00] many of them that sleep in the dust of
[29:02] the earth shall awake
[29:04] some
[29:05] to everlasting life
[29:07] and some
[29:09] to shame
[29:10] and everlasting contempt
[29:12] but they that be wise
[29:14] shall shine as the brightness of the
[29:16] filament
[29:17] and leader turn many to righteousness
[29:20] as the stars forever and ever but thou o
[29:23] daniel
[29:24] shut up the words and seal the book
[29:27] even to the time of the end
[29:30] many shall run to and fro
[29:32] knowledge shall be increased
[29:34] reading from first corinthians chapter
[29:36] 10
[29:37] i want to read from verse 1.
[29:41] moreover brethren and i would not that
[29:43] he should be ignorant
[29:45] how that all our fathers were under the
[29:48] cloud
[29:49] and all pass through the sea
[29:52] we're all baptized unto moses in the
[29:54] cloud and in the sea they'd all eat the
[29:56] same spiritual meat they'd all drink the
[29:58] same spiritual drink for the drunk of
[30:01] that spiritual rock that followed them
[30:03] that rock was christ
[30:05] but with many of them god was not well
[30:10] pleased
[30:11] for they were overthrown in the
[30:13] wilderness
[30:14] now these things
[30:16] were our examples
[30:19] to the intent
[30:21] we should not lust after evil things
[30:25] as they also lusted
[30:27] neither be idolaters as was some of them
[30:31] as it is written the people sat down to
[30:33] eat
[30:34] and drink and rose up to play
[30:38] neither let us commit fornication as
[30:40] some of them committed and fell in one
[30:42] day three and twenty thousand
[30:45] neither let us tell christ
[30:47] some of them also tempted
[30:49] and were destroyed of the supers neither
[30:51] murmur ye some of them also murmured and
[30:54] were destroyed of the destroyer
[30:57] now all these things
[31:00] happen
[31:01] unto them
[31:03] four
[31:04] examples
[31:06] and they are written
[31:08] for our admonition
[31:10] upon whom the ends of the world
[31:13] are come
[31:14] final scripture ephesians chapter 3 1 we
[31:18] want to read from verse 3.
[31:22] blessed be the god and father of our
[31:24] lord jesus christ what blesses with all
[31:26] spiritual blessings that heavenly places
[31:28] in christ
[31:29] according
[31:30] as he had chosen us in him
[31:33] before the foundation of the world
[31:35] that we should be holy without blame
[31:37] before him in love
[31:39] having predestinated us unto the
[31:41] adoption of children
[31:42] by jesus christ himself according to the
[31:44] good pleasure
[31:45] of his will
[31:47] to the praise of the glory of his grace
[31:48] wherein he had made us accepted in the
[31:50] beloved in whom we have redemption to
[31:52] his blood the forgiveness of sins
[31:54] according to the riches
[31:55] of his grace wherein he had a boundary
[31:57] towards us in all wisdom
[31:59] and prudence
[32:00] having made known unto us the mystery of
[32:03] his will
[32:04] according to his good pleasure which he
[32:07] had purposed in himself
[32:09] that in the dispensation of the fullness
[32:12] of times
[32:13] he might gather together in one
[32:16] all things in christ
[32:19] both which are in heaven
[32:20] and which are on earth
[32:22] even in him may god bless his word you
[32:25] may be seated
[32:34] you love him this morning
[32:36] it's always good to come into the house
[32:39] of god it's always good

[33:14] i have an inspiration
[33:16] waiting
[33:18] for the manifestation
[33:20] of the sons of god
[33:22] amen that's the inspiration waiting for
[33:23] the manifestation of the sons of god and
[33:25] this scripture this inspiration
[33:27] is from romans 8 19 it says for the
[33:30] earnest expectation of the creature
[33:33] waited for the manifestation of the
[33:35] money of the sons of god amen and in the
[33:38] amplified it says for the even the whole
[33:40] creation all nature waits expectantly
[33:44] and longs earnestly
[33:46] for god's sons to be made known
[33:50] it's waiting for the revealing or the
[33:53] disclosing of their sonship
[33:56] that's not toxic
[33:57] that is sonship
[33:59] so the creation itself is waiting for
[34:01] the revealing or the unfolding of their
[34:05] sanchi
[34:06] oh this is tremendous
[34:08] just imagine the whole creation is
[34:09] groaning for the manifestation of the
[34:11] sons of god when god will pull the veil
[34:14] off of his sons now these are sons of
[34:16] god

[34:20] sons of god and sons of god express god
[34:24] bible said he came unto his own his own

[35:03] have god's german side of them

[35:12] devil
[35:13] god chose you right in satan's face he
[35:15] pick you up right in your condition he
[35:18] chose you because who he found he called
[35:21] who he called sons of god

[46:36] america is struggling with with a man in
[46:38] power in a position where the question
[46:41] is correct at the whole office
[46:45] how did he get there
[46:47] god will not have that
[46:49] goal not have a bunch of jokers
[46:54] that's why the troll have guards
[46:59] fire all around the throne serve us
[47:01] around the throne that's why he said no
[47:03] scary one could just go and sit on that
[47:05] troll or take from that troll you have
[47:07] to be presented
[47:09] fire have to come offering by fire fire
[47:12] to take a man inside the deal fire to
[47:14] take a woman inside a deal
[47:16] [Applause]
[47:19] talk is talk but approaching that throne
[47:21] that's different
[47:26] the cleansers the burners the seraph's
[47:28] idea to cleanse the worshiper
[47:30] hallelujah coming to being offering to
[47:32] god
[47:33] you want to offer something to god he
[47:34] said before you could even offer it go
[47:36] to a brother and make it right
[47:38] don't come and play a bigger offering
[47:39] offering and doing what
[47:41] i never ought against your brother we're
[47:42] doing that ought
[47:44] it's faith virtue knowledge temperance
[47:45] patience godliness on the top broadly
[47:47] kindness that's the spirit of
[47:49] forgiveness that's the fullness
[47:52] the seven steps that's as far as you can
[47:54] go because the spirit has got himself to
[47:56] come down upon you
[47:58] hallelujah and the spirit of god
[48:00] descending like a dove
[48:02] you can't operate that god does
[48:04] but you could get up on the seventh step
[48:06] and that's seven step is forgiveness
[48:08] that seven stuff is when you could drop
[48:10] your odds and the whole look grudging
[48:11] excuses and blame somebody and somebody
[48:15] and somebody you're still aiming down
[48:17] somewhere inside the deal you have to
[48:20] get out of that
[48:21] get in the real spirit of forgiveness
[48:24] look at jesus he said father forgive
[48:25] them they know not what they do and they
[48:27] will crucify him christian for him but
[48:29] he was higher than that
[48:30] he encouraged them he had swear against
[48:32] them he stood there and said i forgive
[48:33] them
[48:34] they don't even know what they're doing
[48:36] they don't know what they're killing
[48:37] they don't know what they're unfolding
[48:39] inside of there satan don't even know if
[48:41] satan only understood he was going to
[48:43] leave jesus alone but when he died he
[48:45] shed his blood he released a spirit now
[48:47] we are here and satan can hold us back
[48:50] nothing nothing nothing but to stop the
[48:52] sons of god from coming forth in this
[48:54] hour
[48:55] this is what the whole creation is
[48:57] groaning for not have a nice church and
[48:59] nice church members and so on and suit
[49:01] and tie that's not what the creation
[49:02] grown in four
[49:04] oh hallelujah we're going to rip the
[49:06] veil off for who he is you're going to
[49:08] see who he is and as you behold him you
[49:10] will become like him
[49:14] may be seated
[49:17] on the second hand the robe
[49:19] with branham god
[49:21] seeing for seeing elijah's day
[49:24] were numbered
[49:25] he had so long he could stay here on it
[49:27] so long as everybody has
[49:32] got to put boundaries you can't pass
[49:35] so don't worry god know where to find
[49:37] everybody
[49:43] there's a good one
[49:47] go ahead and knock on door you know
[49:48] where she wants to live
[49:51] no when a man overcomers are welcome
[49:58] so he's going to have a success of
[49:59] elijah
[50:00] when he did god called this man
[50:03] listen
[50:04] he wasn't in no
[50:06] seminary when he called him amen he was
[50:09] plowing a field with the yoke of ox
[50:11] doing the service
[50:12] taking care of his mother and father
[50:15] god called him
[50:17] to be the successor of elisha or elijah
[50:20] perhaps many up at the school thought
[50:22] they were sure to do going to be his
[50:25] successor they were going to wear his
[50:27] robe as soon as he was finished
[50:29] but god does the calling amen
[50:33] god does the choosing
[50:37] god does the
[50:38] electing and god does the setting in
[50:42] order
[50:43] [Music]
[50:46] do you love him
[50:48] god has set in the church
[50:51] some apostles some prophets some
[50:53] teachers some evangelists and pastors
[50:55] god does that himself
[50:57] we cannot make one here black or white
[51:01] neither can we add one thing to our
[51:03] stature by taking thought
[51:06] god in his infinite grace
[51:08] and by his election and for knowledge
[51:12] sets
[51:13] these things in order
[51:17] and every wheel works just right
[51:20] i like that i would be a discouraged man
[51:23] this morning if i didn't believe in the
[51:26] election and calling of god
[51:29] if i thought that this world was left to
[51:32] the outcome of it by the power of man
[51:35] and by the wisdom of man and by the
[51:37] united nations who never mentioned god's
[51:39] name i'd be a discouraged person
[51:41] but i'm not looking to that for the
[51:43] outcome i looked to the pages of this
[51:45] old book here where god wrote it out and
[51:49] everything will come just exactly the
[51:52] way he said it
[51:54] so you're not looking for man for your
[51:55] outcome
[51:56] you're not looking for uncle and auntie
[51:58] and tanty and this bishop and this
[52:00] minister's association you're not
[52:01] looking for that for your outcome you're
[52:03] looking to the word
[52:04] for your outcome
[52:06] because once that word is spoken over
[52:07] you nothing will not stop it
[52:09] oh jesus had to find that woman of the
[52:11] world
[52:12] you have to find bartimaeus you have to
[52:13] find peter and john and james and all of
[52:16] them you have to find them because the
[52:17] names was in that book and every name on
[52:19] the book shall be must be have to be
[52:22] delivered
[52:23] oh give the lord a shout praise god god
[52:26] not asking him what you hear your
[52:28] complexion your height your color your
[52:30] race where your country come from or the
[52:32] language you speak all you're looking
[52:34] for is the names on the book that time
[52:36] michael shall stand up and every name
[52:38] song written in that book
[52:40] [Applause]
[52:43] that's why the mighty angel came with
[52:44] the book open in revelation 10 to call
[52:47] your name the seven thunders is what
[52:50] called your name that was christ your
[52:52] husband

[53:07] your husband dropped in revelation 10
[53:10] to call you with a shout it was the
[53:12] covenant angel because he swore by
[53:14] himself what did he swear that time
[53:17] shall be no longer even time itself runs
[53:20] out shall we come into the fullness of
[53:22] time when time itself runs out that may
[53:25] be breaking into eternity breaking into
[53:27] the eighth day breaking into a holy
[53:29] convocation or give the lord some
[53:31] precious people

[53:50] rotten selfish being we're not talking
[53:52] about that

[1:06:15] tonight
[1:06:18] [Music]
[1:06:23] so you're not looking for a man for the
[1:06:24] outcome i'm looking on the page of this
[1:06:26] old book where god wrote it out
[1:06:27] everything will come exactly the way he
[1:06:28] said it that's all so the only thing for
[1:06:30] me to do is to line up with them but not
[1:06:32] line up with them
[1:06:34] but line up with calvary
[1:06:36] line up with god
[1:06:37] line up with his word stay with this
[1:06:39] word no matter how much it looks like
[1:06:41] it's going to be that way it's going to
[1:06:42] be the way god intends it to be
[1:06:45] it can't be nothing else for him being
[1:06:47] infinite know the end from the beginning
[1:06:50] and he makes everything come to his
[1:06:52] praises
[1:06:53] everything come to give god praise
[1:06:56] and honor my if that wouldn't take make
[1:06:59] the courage in a christian nothing can
[1:07:01] go wrong
[1:07:03] amen
[1:07:05] that's ten percent saying amen i heard
[1:07:07] you
[1:07:09] i heard your silence
[1:07:11] on that one day you heard it
[1:07:15] [Applause]
[1:07:17] nothing can go wrong after all it's not
[1:07:19] our bible it's his
[1:07:21] it's not our wisdom it is his and the
[1:07:24] only one thing we have to do is to put
[1:07:26] our faith and trust there and set still
[1:07:29] and see the glory of god and see how it
[1:07:31] moves around to its place and every
[1:07:34] wheel move in it it may be scattered
[1:07:36] from side to side it will move right
[1:07:38] into its place when god speaks the word
[1:07:41] he knew the end from the beginning he
[1:07:43] knew who he who he was going to choose
[1:07:46] he knew elisha would take a larger place
[1:07:48] before the world was ever formed
[1:07:50] everything had to work exactly right and
[1:07:53] we are worried about our loved ones and
[1:07:55] so forth will they ever come in their
[1:07:57] names if they were written in the lamb's
[1:08:00] book of life before the whole day of the
[1:08:02] world they will walk right in there

[1:14:19] the entire holy ghost and the prophet

[1:14:33] spoke of prophetic words spirit spoken
[1:14:35] words to go and anoint a bride so when
[1:14:38] you intruded that you could be wherever
[1:14:41] the weather define you that's why you're
[1:14:43] in church today
[1:14:44] something inside of you is what the word
[1:14:46] connect with
[1:14:48] oh give the lord a shout in the house
[1:14:50] because it's spirit given words
[1:14:53] hallelujah that means is that word going
[1:14:55] out it means it going to catch you
[1:14:58] to pull you in
[1:15:00] to wheel you in because the world has
[1:15:02] you have to become the sons of god
[1:15:04] that's what power was given for that was
[1:15:06] the word was given for not to become a
[1:15:08] church member
[1:15:09] but for you to be a reproduction of god
[1:15:13] so church supposed to be an avenue in
[1:15:15] which you get connect back to your god
[1:15:18] they come like a cell phone activated
[1:15:21] share supposedly place where you get the
[1:15:22] activation then
[1:15:24] well you could call him for yourself
[1:15:26] not through some priests not to some
[1:15:28] bishop but you have your own line
[1:15:31] back to your father
[1:15:33] come on say amen somebody
[1:15:38] [Applause]
[1:15:41] but this part is incredible
[1:15:43] after
[1:15:44] the doors
[1:15:45] [Music]
[1:15:46] of the gentiles is closed
[1:15:49] god will anoint
[1:15:51] a church
[1:15:53] then
[1:15:54] what does that mean
[1:15:56] the doors of the gentiles is closed
[1:15:59] the bible called
[1:16:00] the jews the
[1:16:02] olive tree olive branch and god cut them
[1:16:04] off
[1:16:05] to put this wild olive branch in
[1:16:08] called the gentiles
[1:16:09] and the bibles talk about the times of
[1:16:11] the gentiles
[1:16:12] until the fullness of the gentiles come
[1:16:14] in
[1:16:14] so therefore the gentiles have a
[1:16:16] specific time
[1:16:17] not a specific time but call it the
[1:16:18] fullness of the gentiles until the time
[1:16:20] was gentile coming in so it means that
[1:16:22] when that time come in not one more name
[1:16:25] person going to be saved
[1:16:30] so don't wait for the door to shut
[1:16:33] because nowhere 120 years where people
[1:16:35] had the opportunity to receive it to
[1:16:37] receive the message
[1:16:38] and then when god said they tell noah
[1:16:40] listen time up
[1:16:41] your fullness of time has come
[1:16:43] so you started getting animals in two by
[1:16:45] two
[1:16:45] people see that and thought like
[1:16:47] having a farm inside of there with that
[1:16:49] making fun of noah
[1:16:51] but afterwards god shut the door
[1:16:53] seven days into account
[1:16:56] preaching to doomed people
[1:16:59] the act sat
[1:17:00] preaching to people who could not be
[1:17:02] saved
[1:17:04] oh yeah
[1:17:05] would that repeat again yes
[1:17:07] in church yes
[1:17:09] people have the conversation here and
[1:17:10] can't be saved
[1:17:12] because they were already rejected
[1:17:14] you mean those people that act was
[1:17:15] preaching to no one foreign yes for
[1:17:17] seven days
[1:17:18] until the rain started fall
[1:17:20] then people say noah no i i see it now
[1:17:24] but the only problem is no i didn't shut
[1:17:26] the door amen god did
[1:17:29] and what gorge dog got shot
[1:17:32] no man
[1:17:34] cut open amen and what god thought man
[1:17:37] oh god open no man could shut
[1:17:39] so when god shut the door the door shut
[1:17:41] oh hallelujah so while you have a chance
[1:17:44] to make things right why you have a
[1:17:46] chance to be reconciled to god please do
[1:17:54] i couldn't wait for my family to save
[1:17:56] the lord you know that was a personal
[1:17:58] choice
[1:17:59] that's i choose that
[1:18:01] i choose this is the harder way this
[1:18:02] isn't our way either smoke and drink and
[1:18:04] run around but this is the harder way
[1:18:06] this is christian soldier
[1:18:10] there's no natural soldier this is
[1:18:11] christian
[1:18:12] soldiers
[1:18:14] where your life is there before
[1:18:17] a christian life is a public life you
[1:18:18] know
[1:18:23] oh it was a private life no it's a
[1:18:25] public life
[1:18:26] it's a public life it's a public
[1:18:27] testimony you know you live in a private
[1:18:30] you're a christian i want you to know
[1:18:32] him
[1:18:33] you're not a christian
[1:18:35] you might be imprisoned a christian is a
[1:18:37] public servant that's why god said take
[1:18:39] the blood and put it in your doorpost
[1:18:41] don't put it behind the door well i
[1:18:43] don't like how they're looking they call
[1:18:44] it not blending no you don't have that
[1:18:46] you know the teacher will take you out
[1:18:47] put it on your doorpost because you want
[1:18:49] to see it your neighbors could see it
[1:18:51] anybody walk and see blood blood no
[1:18:53] blood no blood no blood blood blood
[1:18:55] blood everybody could see it that's how
[1:18:58] god wants your testimony
[1:19:00] on your job your book as i see it
[1:19:06] [Applause]
[1:19:10] after the doors of the gentiles closed
[1:19:12] glory another church then
[1:19:14] he was filthy filthy still
[1:19:16] he is righteous righteous still
[1:19:18] he is holy let him be holy still
[1:19:21] god will anoint the church with the
[1:19:23] power of god and things will be taken
[1:19:26] place
[1:19:27] not only then that's prophecy you do not
[1:19:30] know there's a brother um
[1:19:32] recognizing his message but iran says
[1:19:34] now the church has not recognized a day
[1:19:36] like israel back in the whole palestine
[1:19:38] she's going to be forced to work on the
[1:19:40] churches why she didn't recognize the
[1:19:42] hour
[1:19:42] he said let him that fail to be very
[1:19:44] still let him not holy be holy still
[1:19:47] now a bobby a woman she can't be
[1:19:50] because god said woman look at you here
[1:19:53] he said bobby a woman she can't be no
[1:19:55] that sounds very flat that's the
[1:19:57] scripture the bible says she is under
[1:20:00] her head her head is a husband his head
[1:20:02] is christ so she dishonest christ how
[1:20:05] can she be this honorable and not be
[1:20:07] filthy
[1:20:08] let's see that got bob here let her keep
[1:20:10] it
[1:20:12] so in other words when that time come
[1:20:14] it sets your condition
[1:20:18] it's like a snapshot that snaps you and
[1:20:20] that's your picture
[1:20:21] you can't change it
[1:20:24] that's what that means
[1:20:26] so the time the changes now
[1:20:34] you must want change
[1:20:36] you must desire transformation
[1:20:38] you must hate yourself
[1:20:41] you must want god's will
[1:20:43] you have to ask god you want a
[1:20:45] revelation of his will for your life
[1:20:47] you can't just go no you have to drift
[1:20:49] you know
[1:20:50] like a driftwood
[1:20:52] let the stream of life just take you the
[1:20:54] current carrier wherever it hit whatever
[1:20:56] it bumps that's the stream of life and
[1:20:58] you go in with life everybody's doing
[1:21:00] that
[1:21:01] but that same driftwood could be carved
[1:21:04] out into a boat
[1:21:05] and put the power of an engine to power
[1:21:07] it
[1:21:08] to guide it to direct it this is what
[1:21:11] you want you don't want to be drifting
[1:21:14] because if you drift your head that was
[1:21:15] the falls
[1:21:17] i want to say if you drift you will head
[1:21:19] towards the falls
[1:21:21] don't drift let your wife be guided
[1:21:24] let your life be directed by the spirit
[1:21:27] of god
[1:21:29] oh hallelujah
[1:21:31] she that wears shorts
[1:21:32] keep on wearing them
[1:21:34] let he deny the word keep on denying it
[1:21:37] you cannot change
[1:21:38] fixed condition
[1:21:40] you will not be able to change oh
[1:21:42] hallelujah but let him not holy be holy
[1:21:44] still let him that righteous be
[1:21:46] righteous still isn't that right like
[1:21:49] israel back in the homeland national
[1:21:50] force but israel in the home
[1:21:52] must not force put israel in a homeland
[1:21:55] national force will put the work on the
[1:21:57] churches but the power of god will put
[1:21:59] the people in the bride
[1:22:01] and that's why i love that song oh lord
[1:22:02] send the power just now
[1:22:04] baptize everyone
[1:22:06] many people ask will the bride will this
[1:22:08] will this
[1:22:09] what the bride is the elected of god
[1:22:14] period
[1:22:15] so nobody could own the bible and said
[1:22:17] our church have the bride
[1:22:20] that's not the word
[1:22:22] the bride is the
[1:22:24] elected of god
[1:22:26] the church goes through
[1:22:28] that's the one who says whosoever will
[1:22:30] let him come
[1:22:34] but the bride is elected of god
[1:22:36] so you don't want to be part of whoever
[1:22:37] will like comment you know because
[1:22:38] whosoever will come i hear that no be
[1:22:40] elected
[1:22:41] be the bride that's what you must desire
[1:22:43] to be isn't that right
[1:22:44] watch there are five oh god let's keep
[1:22:46] that praise god but abraham each night
[1:22:49] we want every person that's not a
[1:22:50] christian hope something will be said or
[1:22:52] done that you'll become a christian and
[1:22:54] if you're not and if you have already
[1:22:56] believed in the lord jesus and accept
[1:22:58] him and be baptized and you haven't
[1:23:00] received the holy ghost as yet don't let
[1:23:02] this get by
[1:23:03] let this be your night remember here we
[1:23:06] go
[1:23:06] remember there will be just so many
[1:23:09] names on that book
[1:23:12] and when the last name is added that's
[1:23:14] all of it
[1:23:15] yours
[1:23:16] might complete it
[1:23:20] let's go a little further are you with
[1:23:21] me
[1:23:22] when the lamb come and took the book out
[1:23:24] of the right hand of him that sat upon
[1:23:26] the throne that was the book of
[1:23:28] redemption
[1:23:29] those names was put in there before the
[1:23:32] foundation of the world and when that
[1:23:34] last name was called the book
[1:23:37] the plan everything else was revealed
[1:23:40] then the seventh seed was opened by the
[1:23:41] lamb the mystery of the whole bible was
[1:23:43] hidden there
[1:23:44] and the last name that goes on the book
[1:23:48] then he changes a little bit or
[1:23:50] the last name that's redeemed that was
[1:23:53] put on that book
[1:23:55] that settles it
[1:23:57] he comes to claim what he has redeemed
[1:24:01] so before the rapture comes you have to
[1:24:03] be redeemed
[1:24:05] because he's coming for what he has
[1:24:06] redeemed
[1:24:08] redeemed by the blood and redeemed by
[1:24:10] power
[1:24:11] oh hallelujah but you are going to be
[1:24:14] redeemed
[1:24:15] and redeemed means to go back to where i
[1:24:17] was before

[1:24:20] i am saving jesus and we're not talking
[1:24:22] about that we're talking about redeemed

[1:32:07] and you will make it that's a lie from a
[1:32:09] better hell

[1:39:23] something about it if we are not right
[1:39:25] with god let get right with god
[1:39:30] my
[1:39:31] and this south side church needs today
[1:39:33] is a humble itself back again it got to
[1:39:35] a place there's no confession there's no
[1:39:37] love among the people it seems like
[1:39:38] dying daily churches cooling off
[1:39:41] everywhere your final revival is over
[1:39:42] you find it cool enough we need a
[1:39:43] humiliating
[1:39:45] they asked for a general and got a lamb
[1:39:47] god knew what they needed that's what
[1:39:49] the world needs today is a savior a
[1:39:51] savior to this condition something i
[1:39:52] could hold it together not an educated
[1:39:54] regime
[1:39:55] not some mechanical system not some
[1:39:57] educational system what we need is the
[1:40:00] power of the lord jesus christ and
[1:40:02] saving grace back in the church where
[1:40:04] men and women and girls can be saved
[1:40:07] not not you go to church you are saved
[1:40:10] so you can tell somebody no i'm not
[1:40:11] going there i am saved
[1:40:13] i'm not going with you to smoke to drink
[1:40:14] the party i am a safe person jesus saved
[1:40:17] me and i'm grateful to god
[1:40:18] and the life that i live are not living
[1:40:20] that life anymore if anyone in christ is
[1:40:23] a new creature it's a new creation i am
[1:40:25] change i am changing i want something
[1:40:27] better for my life
[1:40:28] [Applause]
[1:40:35] oh glory hallelujah
[1:40:38] could we take some more
[1:40:40] get this one it may be almost past
[1:40:43] feeling time
[1:40:46] almost
[1:40:48] past
[1:40:49] feeling time
[1:40:51] because there will come a time like that
[1:40:53] when the spirit of god will be taken
[1:40:55] from the earth
[1:40:58] so people can feel like how they want to
[1:41:00] feel
[1:41:01] past
[1:41:02] feeling time there will be no more
[1:41:05] the church will remain a while preaching
[1:41:08] because it has
[1:41:11] to preach to the eternal lost
[1:41:15] that is just part of the church ministry
[1:41:18] oh hallelujah
[1:41:20] has to preach
[1:41:21] to the eternal loss are you with me this
[1:41:22] morning
[1:41:24] and if he doesn't cut the work short for
[1:41:26] elected sake there is some that's
[1:41:28] elected to eat in life we all know that
[1:41:29] they got eternal life and if we don't
[1:41:31] cut it short for their sake no flesh
[1:41:33] shall be saved
[1:41:34] the world met a doom every two thousand
[1:41:36] years we know systems that fall apart in
[1:41:38] the days of noah and these are christ
[1:41:41] and so on now the spirit
[1:41:43] the dynamics of the promised word to
[1:41:45] drive
[1:41:46] to get into the church and drive them to
[1:41:49] calvary under and then to the rapture
[1:41:51] so he prophesied that the spirit will
[1:41:53] come to drive us to calvary where we
[1:41:55] have a crucifixion with christ isn't
[1:41:57] that right
[1:41:58] praise god now you say wait a minute
[1:42:01] know what the prophets rebuke those
[1:42:02] women in them days they call them woman
[1:42:04] haters now wait a minute you're writing
[1:42:06] the scriptures down a woman that lives
[1:42:08] in worldly pleasure
[1:42:09] can't be the pleasures of god so the
[1:42:11] woman that lives in worldly pleasure is
[1:42:13] dead while she's living
[1:42:15] and that's what the prophet said said
[1:42:16] paul the woman that lives in this
[1:42:18] worldly condition is dead while she's
[1:42:20] living and if she rejects mercy she can
[1:42:22] cross the separating line where there is
[1:42:24] no place for no more and then where is
[1:42:27] she at with her painted eyes her cut
[1:42:29] here she crossed the line with no way to
[1:42:31] come back there's got to be listen
[1:42:34] listen there's got to be a ministry
[1:42:36] preached to her but remember
[1:42:39] it's all over
[1:42:40] it is done it's just a haunting there
[1:42:43] will be a ministry that will show great
[1:42:45] signs and wonders joe has said so there
[1:42:47] will be no time for redemption it's all
[1:42:49] over the lambda took his book his
[1:42:51] redeemed is over as jesus first preached
[1:42:53] and was rejected and then went and
[1:42:55] haunted those that were there preached
[1:42:58] to them that were in prison could not
[1:42:59] repent no time for salvation that same
[1:43:01] ministry will have to repeat again
[1:43:05] what if that could be the third pole to
[1:43:07] return or lost what if it is there i
[1:43:10] hope it's not what if it is think of it
[1:43:12] in a minute now what if it is god forbid
[1:43:14] i got children but it looks
[1:43:16] pretty close
[1:43:18] oh hallelujah
[1:43:20] noah's ministry
[1:43:21] all ministry done the same noah preached
[1:43:24] exactly went into the ark and when he
[1:43:26] went into the ark there were seven days
[1:43:28] nothing happened and the testimony
[1:43:30] preached to the doom
[1:43:31] not by speaking in tongues not by
[1:43:34] dancing in the spirit not by joining
[1:43:36] church not at the fruit of the spirit
[1:43:38] watch
[1:43:39] but it's the word living
[1:43:42] there it is if they only have looked he
[1:43:43] was messiah he was the living word
[1:43:46] made manifest
[1:43:48] you say the church they'll go right on
[1:43:49] just the same but remember all this time
[1:43:51] noah's and the ark the bride is
[1:43:53] comparing it now the brightest ceiling
[1:43:55] with christ the last member has been
[1:43:57] redeemed
[1:43:58] the sixth seal produced itself and we
[1:44:00] know that the earthquake we lose like
[1:44:02] judgment isn't that right the seventh
[1:44:04] seal brings him to the earth tree is
[1:44:06] perfection the ministry comes to
[1:44:08] perfection when it's reproduced christ
[1:44:10] again in natural among human beings he
[1:44:14] did not say the ministry of the
[1:44:15] perfection when the ministry could
[1:44:16] preach mysteries
[1:44:18] he said when christ is reproduced so
[1:44:21] somewhere along that line we've got to
[1:44:23] see christ oozing on all flesh
[1:44:25] we got to see this word become flesh
[1:44:27] not talk
[1:44:28] not doctrine we had that for 50 years it
[1:44:31] has to be something more than that it
[1:44:33] has to be alive
[1:44:35] because that's the thunder that shakes
[1:44:37] the devil
[1:44:38] oh glory to god
[1:44:40] could you imagine you on your job
[1:44:42] testifying about the love of god
[1:44:44] [Music]

[1:45:19] know woman money and popularity just
[1:45:20] three that not a hundred of them
[1:45:23] amen and all of them compared to the
[1:45:25] lust of the eyes that's the definition
[1:45:26] of the pride of life it's just three
[1:45:27] things

[1:45:30] three things
[1:45:31] woman money and popularity
[1:45:36] they're gonna catch a money kitchen

[1:45:58] to stay with the world you're going to
[1:45:59] say with a word you're not be popular
[1:46:01] because to be popular you have to
[1:46:02] compromise you got to please everybody
[1:46:06] and then you become a dishrag
[1:46:08] everybody can wipe the floor with you
[1:46:10] because you're not making no stand but
[1:46:12] when you make a stand people respect you
[1:46:15] not what you're giving to people respect
[1:46:17] you for what you stand for

[1:46:41] still the devil
[1:46:43] keep permanently the devil he can't
[1:46:45] change
[1:46:46] but you are not permanent
[1:46:49] sinner permanent
[1:46:50] just remember no you're growing in grace
[1:46:53] and the knowledge

[1:47:18] give the lord some praises
[1:47:24] glory
[1:47:26] glory
[1:47:32] hallelujah
[1:47:34] what branham said when the holy was
[1:47:36] coming to you it comes like a little
[1:47:37] light
[1:47:38] like a button
[1:47:39] and as you die out
[1:47:41] as you give up this and give it back
[1:47:42] that button light expands
[1:47:45] to fill your entire being
[1:47:46] so the more you give up this let go this
[1:47:49] that light begin to expand
[1:47:51] take over your mind take over your
[1:47:53] spirit take over your desires take over
[1:47:56] your motives take over your objectives
[1:47:58] you have the objectives of god you have
[1:48:00] the motives of god you have the purpose
[1:48:02] of god you're becoming the image of god
[1:48:04] because that light is expanding
[1:48:06] so much
[1:48:08] till the blood began to ooze out then
[1:48:10] not like us a shadow our people were
[1:48:12] healed in peter's shadow because that

[2:02:14] [Music]
[2:02:17] let's read on
[2:02:19] now this may choke you to death
[2:02:21] but did you know that all men
[2:02:24] that are sons of god are amateur gods
[2:02:30] [Applause]

[2:02:44] amateur god
[2:02:47] a small one of the big one
[2:02:49] [Music]
[2:02:51] that's what adam was supposed to be
[2:02:53] a small one so when you pray you're
[2:02:55] supposed to pray with confidence
[2:02:57] you're supposed to pray with target
[2:03:01] i thank the father for that you always
[2:03:03] hear me
[2:03:05] but i pray enough for my sake but for
[2:03:06] jesse
[2:03:07] [Applause]
[2:03:12] glory
[2:03:14] disciples even asked jesus teach us how
[2:03:16] to pray
[2:03:18] they ain't going to pray holy oh no this
[2:03:20] fisherman waiting on my brain
[2:03:22] then nobody fires his brain
[2:03:24] god he finds your repeating prayers
[2:03:26] praise our moses and what are them
[2:03:28] saying they're one thing but when jesus
[2:03:30] comes and said he said teach them how to
[2:03:31] pray our father what in heaven hallowed
[2:03:33] be thy name and to worship and
[2:03:34] tactically come and whatnot and he run
[2:03:36] them through the whole prayer and on top
[2:03:37] that he said i give us this day or daily
[2:03:39] bread
[2:03:40] yesterday
[2:03:48] adoration and worship and everything
[2:03:50] else and then he cap it off with
[2:03:52] forgiveness
[2:03:53] forgive us our trespasses as we forgive
[2:03:55] those who trespass against us
[2:03:57] [Music]
[2:03:59] everything inside the prayer you know
[2:04:02] faith in their virtue in their knowledge
[2:04:04] everything inside that prayer
[2:04:05] right after forgiveness and then thy
[2:04:07] kingdom come
[2:04:12] ready for the kingdom to come
[2:04:13] [Applause]
[2:04:18] [Music]
[2:04:20] that's right
[2:04:21] when you're ready to forgive
[2:04:23] they're ready for the kingdom to come
[2:04:26] [Applause]
[2:04:29] how many ever know how many know jesus
[2:04:30] said so the bible said do you not look
[2:04:32] do you
[2:04:33] did not your law say that you are gods
[2:04:37] and you call them gods which god said in
[2:04:38] genesis 2 that they were gods had fooled
[2:04:40] them in over the dominion of the world
[2:04:42] he gave him dominion over all things he
[2:04:45] lost his got you speaking with adam he
[2:04:47] lost his sonship he lost his domain and
[2:04:49] satan took it over but brother
[2:04:52] we are waiting
[2:04:54] for
[2:04:55] the manifestation of the sons of god who
[2:04:58] will come back
[2:04:59] and take it over again

[2:12:58] christ there's a disposition of church
[2:13:00] organization there's a dispensation of
[2:13:02] the of the holy spirit now is the

[2:14:05] fighting this pastor this church
[2:14:06] fighting this first jesus christ which
[2:14:08] is foolishness which is all over the
[2:14:10] message we're not talking about that
[2:14:11] we're talking about the ministry
[2:14:13] becoming so much like christ
[2:14:15] not so much like a politician
[2:14:17] not so much evil
[2:14:18] and so among the people with nasty seeds
[2:14:20] not that that's not christ
[2:14:23] that's human
[2:14:25] that is natural
[2:14:27] okay the spirit of god commented these
[2:14:30] men so perfectly until their ministry

[2:14:43] time before the
[2:14:44] convention are we have no communion
[2:14:45] service next
[2:14:46] this evening so there's one service
[2:14:49] so we're making a combine
[2:14:51] all right the church
[2:14:53] the church is supposed to be
[2:14:54] predestinated
[2:14:55] into the adoption of children where god
[2:14:57] can take a man and adopt him into the
[2:15:00] family and give him something
[2:15:04] do you believe that
[2:15:05] god could have a man and give him
[2:15:13] [Music]
[2:15:16] what's the first thing you do not the
[2:15:18] second or two the first thing to do he
[2:15:19] said the first thing try that
[2:15:24] see if it's right
[2:15:26] so my brother gets some kind of power
[2:15:27] whatnot and he come and my job is to
[2:15:30] try that
[2:15:31] and if you don't want me to try it we
[2:15:33] know something little wrong
[2:15:38] i said come bring it bring it bring it
[2:15:39] bring it
[2:15:41] bring it and come back
[2:15:43] bring it to the pastor and come
[2:15:45] you say i'm not bringing it
[2:15:46] go with it
[2:15:49] wherever it comes from go back with it
[2:15:52] because if you have it and it's right
[2:15:53] you're not afraid to bring it
[2:15:54] uncomfortable
[2:15:55] but your lord tell me don't tell nobody
[2:15:56] about it
[2:15:58] go back with it
[2:16:00] lord and tell me that brother he said
[2:16:01] bring it and come
[2:16:02] that's the authority to try it first
[2:16:06] let's continue
[2:16:07] see if it is right
[2:16:09] if it is right we thank god for it move
[2:16:11] right with it
[2:16:12] but we have to try it
[2:16:14] so any minister say you have to take it
[2:16:17] rebuke you because
[2:16:19] you're questioning me you're questioning
[2:16:20] me yes i'm questioning you
[2:16:22] don't question me don't question me
[2:16:24] don't even question me is it a word
[2:16:25] though
[2:16:26] do you not panic because you know
[2:16:28] this is sharp like a reason you know i
[2:16:30] am here not only the question but to
[2:16:31] challenge you
[2:16:33] because paul said if an angel comes from
[2:16:35] heaven much is on the pulpit
[2:16:38] if my angel come from heaven and preach
[2:16:40] any other gospel
[2:16:42] crack the bookshot and shoot you know
[2:16:47] [Applause]
[2:16:52] because that demon want to destroy you
[2:16:55] because that word is destructive
[2:16:58] a forced teaching force structure is
[2:16:59] destructive
[2:17:01] that's what the devil introduced in the
[2:17:02] garden of eden yeah god said you shall
[2:17:05] not surely die god did not say that
[2:17:07] god said you shall surely die
[2:17:09] devil twist it don't let the devil twist
[2:17:11] no word we come too far to turn back now
[2:17:14] [Applause]
[2:17:17] we come too far to bring strange fires
[2:17:20] [Applause]
[2:17:24] too fast to bring some offering of
[2:17:26] strange fire
[2:17:28] oh my
[2:17:30] so watch the whole a watch this man
[2:17:32] claims a certain thing try it see if
[2:17:33] it's right if it's right move right with
[2:17:35] it and say lord send us something else
[2:17:37] keep moving on watch until everything
[2:17:39] takes place every fellow takes place
[2:17:40] that is when the philistines go to
[2:17:42] backing up shorts will go off here will
[2:17:44] go down face will be washed single will
[2:17:46] be missing that's right when the church
[2:17:48] begins to get into his mighty power when
[2:17:51] they have a nasty sapphire few of them
[2:17:53] you will see that holy church stand
[2:17:55] together in its power positionally
[2:17:57] placed as sons of god adopted into the
[2:18:00] family of god powerful truth standing
[2:18:02] there
[2:18:03] that is what he's coming for
[2:18:06] what's going for a powerful church
[2:18:08] not no flimsy church not no whimpers
[2:18:10] church not no fight church a
[2:18:12] powerful church
[2:18:13] man and woman know how to pray
[2:18:15] not to call upon god not to shake
[2:18:17] themselves and get out of the way that's
[2:18:19] a real gift when you could get out of
[2:18:21] the way
[2:18:21] oh my he said look i'm going to skip
[2:18:24] here we shall be so on fire for god we

[2:21:28] could deliver you you had testimony

[2:21:48] it takes an everyday life to have this
[2:21:51] kind of life not a sunday life or
[2:21:53] everyday life you're pressing your way
[2:21:54] as a christian
[2:21:55] god
[2:21:56] is calling his children aside
[2:21:59] by manifestation
[2:22:01] they don't have to say one word about it
[2:22:04] no paper testimony necessary
[2:22:10] so kind
[2:22:12] so christ-like
[2:22:13] god calls children aside by
[2:22:15] manifestation they don't have to say one
[2:22:17] word about it you see something happen
[2:22:19] positionally placed sons of god god
[2:22:21] getting into him into order exactly with
[2:22:24] the same thing and he just has as much
[2:22:26] authority his word is just as good as an
[2:22:28] archangel even better the son was
[2:22:31] adopted put on a high place set out
[2:22:33] there change his robes change his colors
[2:22:35] the father's ceremony this is my son
[2:22:37] from henceforth he's governor he's ruler
[2:22:40] he's over all my heritage all i have
[2:22:42] belongs to him
[2:22:44] oh praise god that's the reason the
[2:22:45] coming of the seals
[2:22:47] at the finishing of the seventh seal the
[2:22:50] mystery of god should be finished to
[2:22:52] know who god is what he is how he lives
[2:22:55] his nature his being you are supposed to
[2:22:58] be all the way up there by that time
[2:23:02] to bring us into the full stature of the
[2:23:04] sons of daughter of god
[2:23:05] here you come right back to the mystery
[2:23:07] of the seventh seal and under the
[2:23:09] seventh sea of seven thunders and he's
[2:23:11] saying we supposed to be all the way up
[2:23:13] there by that time all the unfortunately
[2:23:15] supposed to be in there by that time
[2:23:17] what time the fullness of time

[2:23:36] this seal
[2:23:37] he revealed all the six seals but he
[2:23:39] don't say nothing about the seventh
[2:23:41] so the seventh seal is for the
[2:23:44] anti-message
[2:23:47] first four seals history also fifth
[2:23:50] field on the altar fourth seal the b
[2:23:52] system and so on six year

[2:24:03] will be a total secret
[2:24:05] only when it starts but at the finishing
[2:24:08] we just read that you're supposed to be

[2:24:30] jesus came being the one without sin he
[2:24:32] proved it when the winds blowed he said
[2:24:34] peace be still
[2:24:36] so it was more than talk he proved it by
[2:24:37] manifestation isn't that right then he
[2:24:40] said if you shall say this mountain be
[2:24:42] moved don't doubt you shall have what
[2:24:43] you said so go back to genesis now the
[2:24:45] world and nature is growing moving for

[2:26:25] message born to all the world
[2:26:28] and the only way
[2:26:30] that god can preach the gospel today is
[2:26:33] through that lump of clay
[2:26:38] so god can't preach god put your
[2:26:39] mechanical tape
[2:26:40] he has to appreciate two lumps of clay
[2:26:42] thus men
[2:26:43] and that's the reason you sick people
[2:26:44] have the right to come and say lord
[2:26:46] jesus if you only heal me now i may not
[2:26:48] be a preacher i'll talk about it i'll do
[2:26:49] everything i can you are the vine i'm
[2:26:51] one of the branches and so forth okay
[2:26:53] now let's go let's work for them in
[2:26:56] order to preach the gospel
[2:26:58] before you can make it a gospel preach
[2:27:01] you have got to have power and
[2:27:03] demonstration
[2:27:04] of the holy spirit amen to prove the
[2:27:07] gospel the letter kill it
[2:27:10] and the spirit make it alive
