[1:42] Winds of life that blow contrary oh
[1:47] Hallelujah this is the moment where the
[1:48] story changes now the changing of the
[1:50] tide isn't that right they chose the
[1:52] wrong day they chose a wrong man to mess
[1:54] with David put on his prayer garments
[1:57] David clothes himself in God's humility
[1:59] clothe himself in God's righteousness oh
[2:02] H his faith was counted as righteousness
[2:04] and he come into the presence of God
[2:06] with the right comment on on the right
[2:08] time on the right day in the right
[2:10] season and he said Lord shall I pursue
[2:13] oh brother if you ever discover that
[2:16] there's power in prayer there's power in
[2:18] that EA tonight oh whenever you are in
[2:21] trouble go and get your EA tonight if
[2:24] the devil is attacking your children if
[2:26] the devil is attacking your home if you
[2:28] end up in an unprovoked War tonight go
[2:32] get your ephod oh Hallelujah and get
[2:34] down into prayer and see what God will
[2:37] do tonight oh there is power in prayer
[2:41] when you recognize your divine right as
[2:44] a Son of God then you put on your ephod
[2:47] and you call upon God and he will answer
[2:51] tonight what we need is no neology we
[2:54] don't need no more theology but what we
[2:57] need tonight is neology some sons and
[3:00] some daughters tonight who know how to
[3:02] get down on their knees and pray pray
[3:05] until God answer pray until God hears us
[3:09] cry until God hears our cry and say I've
[3:12] heard the cries of my people and I have
[3:15] come down to deliver themall oh
[3:21] Hallelujah theology has failed for a
[3:23] thousand years what we need is neology
[3:26] tonight to bring back the Holy Ghost
[3:29] into the church oh Hallelujah isn't that
[3:33] rightall expectation what God calls
[3:35] great or what man calls great God calls
[3:37] foolish and what man called foolish God
[3:39] called great that's what we have to do
[3:41] is get back into the program of God the
[3:43] prophet said and find out after all what
[3:46] God wants us to do Hallelujah and the
[3:49] only way I know to do it the prophet
[3:51] said is prayer prayer is the key oh can
[3:56] we say Amen tonight I'm almost finished
[3:58] not a little while longer amen oh and
[4:00] that's the answer Prayer Changes Things
[4:02] prayer is the most powerful weapon that
[4:03] was ever put in the control of human
[4:06] beings he said there's no atomic bomb no
[4:08] hydrogen bomb as powerful as prayer
[4:11] prayer will change the mind of God did
[4:14] you know that he said he said it will do
[4:16] it it did it one time amen and then he
[4:19] went down into Hezekiah isn't that right
[4:21] talking about that Prophet praise God he
[4:22] said thus day the Lord he's not coming
[4:23] off the bed he's going to die right
[4:25] there and he he said I can imagine all
[4:27] the celebrities saying oh the he good
[4:29] King is going to die the king is going
[4:30] to die thus say the Lord he's going to
[4:32] die but the prophet said Hezekiah turned
[4:34] his face to the wall and wept bitterly
[4:38] and the Lord said I said I Lord I
[4:39] beseech the he said you to consider me
[4:42] he said I walk before you with a perfect
[4:44] heart he said I need 15 years longer to
[4:47] get my kingdom in a condition and he
[4:49] said you know it looks like God would
[4:51] have wanted to say something he said but
[4:53] he he he'd have told him while he was
[4:54] talking to him but he said God has a way
[4:57] of doing things he said you have to come
[4:59] God's way and God's means of doing
[5:02] things and as long as we try to get it
[5:04] in ourselves it won't work we just can't
[5:07] pattern after another he said but we've
[5:09] got to live IND individually before God
[5:13] he said and the greatest man of the land
[5:14] isn't that right praise God was a king
[5:16] and there was the greatest man on Earth
[5:17] talking to the greatest man in heaven
[5:19] and yet the great powers of Heaven
[5:21] couldn't talk back to the king because
[5:23] he wasn't meant to be that he was just a
[5:25] king so he then he talked to Isaiah and
[5:28] that was his Prophet amen that was his
[5:31] mouthpiece and he said go tell him I've
[5:34] heard his prayers and tell him I'm going
[5:37] to spare him 15 more years and if prayer
[5:41] could do that tonight then prayer could
[5:43] change your situation tonight prayer
[5:46] could change your circumstance tonight
[5:48] oh seek the Lord while he may be found
[5:52] and call upon him while he is near isn't
[5:55] that right oh Lord the prophet said
[5:57] let's just ask God tonight just don't
[5:59] spare nothing he said but pour out to
[6:02] the powers of Heaven if he has to shake
[6:04] us and tear us to pieces and go down to
[6:07] The Potter's House and be remolded again
[6:09] if that's what it takes the prophet said
[6:12] that's what I want and I think that's
[6:14] what every honest hearted believer wants
[6:17] no matter what it takes isn't that right
[6:21] we pray until we get an answer tonight
[6:23] oh amen almost ready to close David
[6:26] inquired of the Lord sh shall I pursue
[6:28] this troop shall I overtake him
[6:30] and God said don't worry you're going to
[6:32] get everything back what an
[6:35] encouragement from the Lord tonight oh
[6:37] that you are going to recover all that
[6:40] you have lost oh hallelujah hallelujah
[6:43] the Bible says even young men shall
[6:46] faint and utterly fall but they that
[6:48] wait upon the Lord shall renew their
[6:51] strength shall be restored unto you all
[6:55] the years that the cankerworm and the
[6:58] caterpillar and the Locust and the
[7:01] Palmer worm had taken away from you
[7:03] there is a promise tonight of
[7:06] restoration when you wait upon Him
[7:08] musician could come Hallelujah there is
[7:10] a promise of restoration there is a
[7:13] promise of redemption when you wait upon
[7:17] him when you seek his face when you turn
[7:20] from your Wicked Ways then you're going
[7:22] to hear from Heaven he's going to
[7:24] forgive your sins he will heal your land
[7:28] he will heal your son he will heal your
[7:31] daughter he will fix your circumstance
[7:34] he will do what he promised to do cuz
[7:37] only he can do it and we just surrender
[7:40] to his will and say Lord God I've done
[7:43] all I know I can do here is thy faithful
[7:47] servant Lord all things are ready send
[7:50] the fire lord send the anointing father
[7:54] send a cold from off the altar Here I Am
[7:57] Lord Jesus I'm in your
[8:00] hands oh Hallelujah and David went and
[8:02] got 600 men isn't that right went to the
[8:05] brook and David pursued he and 400 men
[8:08] and 200 men with him and so forth
[8:10] like that isn't that right I'll
[8:12] paraphrase I'm skipping along they met
[8:13] an Egyptian in the field and they fed
[8:15] him and so forth and they say uhhh where
[8:17] did you come from and he said I'm a
[8:19] young man of Egypt I'm an I'm a servant
[8:21] of the amalekite my master left me
[8:23] because he was Tre I was three days gone
[8:25] and sick isn't that right and and David
[8:28] said show me where these people are
[8:30] isn't that right and David when he was
[8:32] brought them down behold they will
[8:34] spread abroad all the Earth all the
[8:37] amalekites was eating they was drinking
[8:40] they was having a party because they
[8:42] thought they had got all the spoil they
[8:44] don't need no more spoil no more time
[8:46] for party time for drink up time for
[8:50] festivities oh Hallelujah and right in
[8:52] the middle of their party right in the
[8:54] middle of Satan's Eden God's going to
[8:56] raise up a crop tonight who knows that
[8:59] under them messenger they're going to be
[9:01] the final voice to the final age God
[9:04] already give them a word to pursue after
[9:07] their Revival tonight to pursue after
[9:10] all that the enemy has taken all the
[9:12] enemy has robbed the church he robbed

[9:24] be like Eve oh there are more for us
[9:28] than against us tonight and if God be
[9:31] with us then we shall be able to drive
[9:34] out the enemy to pursue our enemy as the

[9:51] and drink and David Came Upon them just
[9:55] as they came upon Him unprovoked David

[9:59] oh the devil is not looking for this
[10:01] bride he thinks you're defeated but
[10:03] we're going to come at him brother one
[10:05] of these days he's going to wake up to
[10:06] realize that there's a God in you the
[10:09] same God that was in Peter that healed a
[10:11] lame man at the gate called beautiful

[10:16] these days and she will say Silver and
[10:18] Gold Have I None but such as I have give
[10:22] I unto thee and hell is going to shake

[10:40] it oh a mighty bride in the last day
[10:43] we're looking for it to happen tonight
[10:45] isn't that right oh one more point
[10:47] before we close it took work it took
[10:50] work to get back what they had lost

[10:54] evening of that day to the evening of
[10:56] the very next day they fought for a full
[10:58] 24 hours period they had to fight it
[11:02] took work to get it back it wasn't easy
[11:05] but what David had was a word from the
[11:08] Lord and that is what he held on to in
[11:11] the midst of the clanging Shields and
[11:13] the swords in the midst of the burning
[11:15] fires he had a promise from God he had
[11:18] already conquered on his knees when God
[11:20] told him pursue and just like the Lamb
[11:23] of God conquered on his knees and said
[11:25] not my will but thy will be done in the
[11:29] midst of the battle there was a word
[11:31] from the Lord that word will endure it
