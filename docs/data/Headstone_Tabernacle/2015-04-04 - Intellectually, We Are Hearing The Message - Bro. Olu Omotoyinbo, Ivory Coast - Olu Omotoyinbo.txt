been in the meetings and he will yet be in the meetings because the promised that where two or three are gathered together in my name it's very important now it's got to be in his name which means the focus has got to lift up the name of Jesus when you when you gather together there should be no other purpose but to lift up the name name of Jesus whether in your assemblies in church or in a convention like when the Lord God sees the purpose is to lift up the name of Jesus Christ he has promised he will be there in our midst we don't have to beg him we don't have to bleed we don't have to

that group that has an a that can hear what the spirit said the churches you have the air you the ability to hear glory to God Amen God richly bless you if you have your Bibles this morning i' like to invite attention to a few of scripture joh 2 First Corinthians and Ephesians 4 you got to pray for me this morning because I came here to a coast to preach on the call to the resurrection but but hearing brother the over yesterday morning and remember Journey last night I began to have second thoughts because they spoke about things I've been speaking about in our church in recent times [Music] so I thought maybe the holy spirit will have me speak on a few things also this morning when Johnny was speaking last night about the emotions and I've been speaking a lot about that in Lagos in recent times about the emotions because brother bam said intellectually we hearing the word of God the message the message that God has given us and he L up for us and he said but we've got to lay in the Pres of the song to let it B down in other words intellectually hearing the word not enough amen so I thought I would just speak along the same lines this morning amen so this morning I to put a few notes together um on some loose shet here brother over you got to teach me I've been begging you you got to teach me how to use that that tablet thing to preach teach me so if you have your Bibles I'll just pray for me this morning I just I'm not preaching I'm just going to talk to you amen from my heart I like to do it that way John 21 this talking about Peter's denial you know many Christians brother brother preached one time message why do many Christians find it hard or difficult to live a Christian Life and he tried to show us because friends it's not about talking Mysteries it's not about believing the Mysteries it's about the Mysteries coming down from God as the word of God and your soul grabbing that word and that what mixing up with the elements of your life and outcomes a life like Jesus Christ because this is the age of personal life your own life cannot make it your father's life cannot make it your mother's life cannot make it the life in your family cannot make it it's got to be his personal life the personal life of Jesus Christ why do so many Christians find it hard even basic Christianity and you take a look you know that's a that's a that's a Christian that's a saved man said boy or girl or woman so why they find it hard and here is Peter here here he was but always spoke about them yesterday morning they were disciples at this time they not yet been commissioned as Apostles yet but Peter had had a revelation the keys had been given to him and even though he did not know it God had a future ahead of him an important part in the kingdom of God but here is Peter at the at the at the at the crucifixion of Jesus and this is Easter weekend right about this time 2,000 years ago Peter was warned by Jesus by Jesus you're going to deny me three times and Peter said they can all deny you see that self there they cannot they can all deny you but I will not I will follow you to the death intellectually he know the right thing to do but when Peter was called but when Peter was called to put into practice what he knew intellectually he failed he lied a cursed your intellect will fail you it failed the great Peter it tell Peter even with a spiritual revelation of the seven Thunders the seven voices of the of the future coming seven Church ages amen St John 21 I read from verse 15 so when they had died Jesus said to Simon Peter Simon son of Jonas lovest thou me more than this he said unto him yeah Lord thou knowest that I love thee he said unto him feed my Lambs to him again the second time Shon son of Jonas lovest thou me he said unto him yeah Lord thou knowest that I love thee he said unto him feed my sheep he said unto him the third time Simon son of Jonas lovest thou me Peter was grieved because he has said unto him the third time lovest thou me and you know you you know the story Jesus asked him the first two times in a gapper a gapper love because when you have a spiritual Revelation like Peter heard in Matthew 16 part of the the package comes with a gap of Lord love to God with all your heart with all your soul with all your might with all your strength and the second commandment love your neighbor as thyself AAP love the love of God Amen is packaged with a spiritual Revelation and that's why Jesus in AAP do you love me do you love me with AAP love because if you really do AAP Love Never Fails because that's charity never fails you love MEAP Peter said yes Lord I love you he wasn't very sure because the thoughts came on his mind that if he really loved him he swore love to him but he denied him and Peter was grieved this third time because Jesus changed the words the English language says love but the Greek let you understand he said Peter do you like me are you fond of me like you are fond of a friend you just like me don't talk love Peter because if you loved me you would not have denied me that way Peter understood those things that's why he was grieved he wasn't grieved at the Lord he was griefed at himself Jesus was probing Peter's love Jesus was was trying to get Peter to understand a is the only thing that God requires in Christian service that's the only acceptable motive in Christian service feel your love will fail you it will lie Peter it will steal it will cheat it will curse it will commit fornication it will commit adultery it will do drugs Peter was grieved at himself at the life he had lived failing the Lord the way he failed the Lord he wasn't gried another man he wasn't blaming some other man Peter Peter was not in that game of blaming the Lord or some other man for his failings for what he did wrong Peter was man enough to say I did it I'm griefed at myself I am sorry Lord he said yeah Lord thou knowest all things you know my weakness you know my weak spots I need your help thou knowest all things can you say that this morning Hallelujah hallu glory to God Amen verse 17 he said unto him the third time Simon son of Jonas lovest thou me like do you like me Peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time lovest thou me and he said unto him Lord thou knowest all things thou knowest that I love thee J Jesus said unto him feed my sheep verily verily I say unto thee when thou was young thou Gest thyself and walkest with thou wouldest but when thou shalt be old he's talking about maturity now when you were child now you're coming to maturity and when you old when you are old thou shall stretch forth thine hands and another shall gu thee and carry the whether thou wouldest not you ready you are ready to submit then take my hands precious Lord you're tired of leading yourself you want another to lead you to a death to the death of a car weight amen amen this SP he signifying by what you should glorify God and when he had spoken this he said unto Peter follow me amen First Corinthians chter 13 May though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels and I have no charity I am become a son Andra or a tingin symbol and though I have the gift of Prophecy and hon understand all Mysteries and all knowledge and though I have all Propet so that I could remove mountains and have no charity I am nothing and though I be sure all my goods to fear the poor and though I give my body to be born and have not charity he profited me nothing charity is a Greatful love only motive in Christian in Christian service verse four charity suffers long and is kind Char EnV not Char not itself is not puffed up does not behave itself unly she not her own is not easily provoked think of No Evil re rejoiceth not in iniquity but rejoiceth in the truth beareth all things hopeth all things endureth all things charity never faileth but whether there be prophecies they shall fail whether there be tongues they shall seize whether there be knowledge it shall vanish away for we know in part and we prophesy in part but when that which is perfect is come then that which is in part shall be drawn away here this again Jesus told Peter when you were young you could do whatever but I'm calling you for a higher level of existence a growth a growing up into him in All Things Christian maturity when I was a child I spake as a child I understood as a child I thought as a child but when I became a man I put away childish things for now we see through a glass Darkly but then face to face now I know in part but then I know even as also I am known and now abide faith hope charity these three but the greatest of these is Charity amen amen my scripture here Ephesians 4 verse 26 be ye angry and sin not let not the son go down upon your wrath neither neither give place to the devil [Music] let him that steal steal no more but rather let him labor walk with his hands the things which is good that he may have to give to him the needed let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth but that which is good to the use of edine that may Minister Grace unto the her and grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby you sailed onto the day of redemption let all be and I get to your emotions let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamour and evil speaking be put away from you with all malice and replace those evil emotions with these other emotions here vers 32 and be ye kind one to another tenderhearted forgiving one another even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you amen amen may the Lord his his hly bless you intellectually we're hearing the message is is a quote from B I'll get it the quot later but if you know the Bible in Old Testament times tells us about the Jews God's people how God how God in his Covenant with them that they would kill a lamb to atone for their sins year and year out there was a day of atonement where the people led by the high priest would come before God and take a lamb and slay the lamb to take their sins away and they release the lamb and the lamb will car the sin far away from them but it was only question of time before those same sins that the lamb took away from them ENT lamb it was only a question of time before they were back doing the same things again or even worse and that was the Dilemma that God's people the Jews were in in the in the Old Testament days and brother explained to us like many Bible scholars know that what it was man's nature is inherently evil there's no good thing in our flesh in our nature and Paul said that what I would I would not and sin taking advantage of my weak nature deceive my nature because I know in my flesh there lies not one good thing so in the Old Testament jaring year out they kept coming back the lamb will take their sins away and they will come back before they knew it they were doing the same sins all over again that was the Old Testament but strangely many Believers are still in that same spot it's as though is the lamb lamb in the Old Testament that took their sins away it's like they don't have the power they haven't found the spot to live a Victorious Christian life but brother Bram he explained to us that the lamb the natural lamb in the Old Testament could not take away sins could not really atone for sins because the lamb was an animal that had no soul it had a spirit and a flesh and man the Jews that were placing their sins on that animal why a three four being they had a spirit and a flesh like lamb but they also had a soul which is where the nature is hiding at so the the the lamb could not really take away their sins the lamb paid the P paid the price for their sins because lamb was slain but to give them the power to live about that sin the innocent lamb could not do it because even though the lamb was innocent it was sinless the life of that lamb could not come upon human beings because the life of human beings hid in their souls that's where the nature hides so the lamb the natural lamb can only take sins away for a short while and that's why year after year they had to come to make an atonement for their sins but one day one day another lamb came thank God for Easter thank God for Easter another lamb came it wasn't a fleed animal but he was the Lamb of God John said Behold the Lamb of God we taketh away the sins of the world he has carried your sins so far away you don't have to carry them no more did you hear me the Lamb of God has carried your sins you don't have to carry them again you don't have to be a slave to your sin to your evil nature to sex to drugs to Habit the Lamb of God has carried your sins away that's what Easter was about that's why he went to Calvary so one time not year after year one to take your sins nail them to the tree every habit every sin yesterday sin today sin future sins to the tree and you are free how many are free say I am free the Lamb of God Jesus Christ he set you free amen you be seated amen with us so when Jesus died God finally had the answer the solution to man's constant sin problem because Jesus Christ being the Lamb of God was a man he was fully God and he was fully man Hallelujah he went through everything you went through he suffered everything you suffered he was tempted in every point he was not pretending he was tempted he was tempted to do wrong things like you were tempted but he found the spot he found the spot to overcome Glory Hallelujah Hallelujah and what he did the power that L within him in his life within his soul this was a lamb that had a soul that life in his soul to come back upon us and come into our souls and give us the power within us the power of an unending life the power to overcome that's why Paul cried out who shall deliver me from this body of death I thank my God Hallelujah for Jesus Christ who gives me who gives all of us always the victory through Jesus Christ say that to yourself God gives me always the victory not today Victory tomorrow you are down you have the victory always hallelujah hallelujah you are just got to change your thinking about it brother spoke last night you got to take Lucifer and squeeze him out because you know who you are you know that you know that you know you going begin to wave your sins you can begin to wave your habits no matter how powerful they are they are coming off of you this morning whatever was left from yesterday morning yesterday night they are coming out this morning because he who the son of man Jesus Christ the Lamb of God I set free is free indeed say it say I am free indeed [Applause] this is not the pastor setting you free this is not the bishop setting you free there is not the king set fre there is not any reverence any evangelist no Apostle no preacher no Prophet setting you free for the son of man Jesus Christ God himself setting you free his life coming to you sets you free you have Elbow Room you say brotheru but I'm not free I'm not free I still do wrong things because the devil is deceiving you the devil is taking advantage of you of your ignorance on the world but not anymore these meetings these meetings are out more than a conqueror more than a conqueror more than an overcomer you might as well Rejoice might as well shout shout it from the rooftops Glory Glory see that so and see brother con was speaking last night speaking to his young people and the church about life about life how life is important many times we forget the pro said we're two two four beings one on the earth to die want one in heaven to live this life here is with death that's why Jesus said Peter when you were young you did what you wanted you but now you are old one going to take you by the hand and you're going to mature you was telling Peter because the Bible said he was telling him by what death he should die to glorify God in other words when you are maturing is a death process in there you got to die you and I can't stay in the same shape and think because and think because intellectually we are hearing the message that makes us Christians that makes us example Believers no don't let no man deceive you brother let no man lead you to error the Mysteries is no words the Mysteries hanging in the heavens but brother Pam said Seven Angels Came From eternity came down with the Mysteries the Mysteries come down from God the Mysteries don't stay up they come down [Applause] if I preach and your head is all scattered you don't even what I'm talking about most likely the Mysteries I'm not bringing them down to you as the word of God because the Bible said Jesus Christ is the mystery of God Christ himself been the mystery of God it should be the one that people will hear and say wow such great Mysteries wow but that was how the Pharisees spoke that was how the sades spoke because they fail they thought that by speaking such great great great sounding words that's going to maintain their position that's going to make the people respect them but Jesus the greatest mystery the mystery of God itself he brought the mystery down the Bible said the common people had him gladly in other words the common people have Jesus Christ speaking the mystery of God breaking it down at their level understanding and they were happy they rejoiced because the Mysteries broken down to them as the word of God give them hope give them a hope give them a confidence they can live this life and they were happy the Common People heard him gladly they cried out never a man spake like this man never a man did the things on this Earth that this man and his words were as beautiful as his miracle he didn't speak as the scribes and Pharisees with their High sanding Mysteries brought the Mysteries down as the word of God the Mysteries come down to us at our intellectual level let me say that again the Mysteries come down to us at our intellectual level as the world of God that's where it starts from because intellectually Mal said we hearing the word of God somebody shout [Applause] hallelujah amen [Applause] GL are you happy glory to God Amen so the proof the proof is not in speaking words that people don't understand or in speaking Mysteries that Mal is not even speak about that's humanistic but the secret seven angels come down to Malachi and brought the Mysteries down to him Hallelujah and brother bam said those Seven Angels Came From eternity and brought the Mysteries down to me as the word of God hallelujah and he said what those angels pick him up into the Pyramid of themselves the mystery word that those angels brought those mystery words that those angels brought were broken down to the prophet and the effect of it was it lifted him up above the Earth above his weaknesses above his failures above his Temptations the Mysteries come down to us as the word of God [Applause] Glory so personally I'm so focused like brother was speaking last night on my young people in particular understanding that this gospel here is no Fable is no fair you can leave this life oh yes you can oh yes you can say to yourself say to yourself I can live this life hallelujah hallelujah no matter your weaknesses no matter your Temptations because the Lamb of God that takes the sins of the world away has appeared to you already take away your sins your weaknesses your habits the loss of the flesh the loss of eyes the pr of Life the where you will overcome them constantly even as by the spirit of the Lord glory to God Amen because that's how God intended it to be glory glory to God Amen Hallelujah Hallelujah because because know what happened just quickly what happened when God created man in his own image after his likess amen Genesis 126 that was God creating man and when he created Adam he created you the same way he created Adam directly Out of the Dust of the ground in Eden and he he creates you the same way out of the Dust of the ground and I hide you in your mother's womb because life is precious to God so God hides you in your mother's bosom and you grow up under her heart under her heart her heart her lungs her vital organs who are protecting you you are created a creation of God from the dust of the ground like Adam was and in in Genesis 126 God he took his own image let us make man in our image so God created man his own image it took his own image seven perfect Spirits because before the beginning Elohim seven spirits and he had a desire to make M His Image so he formed himself into the theophany the logos word that will have an image and off of that logos word which was seven spirits he created an image so the image he put in Adam in Genesis 126 was the image of the logos was the image of seven spirits it was a word image was a word SE was Adam's theop that he bypassed that God put into him in seed form Adam's seed was in Genesis 126 let us make man in our image and that image was seven perfect spirits a seed in Adam's soul and that's why your theop as a seed of God Amen your soul is your theophany SE form God condescended the seven spirits of the theop that you byass God sended it into your soul as a little button and that's where Victory lays that's where your victory too late Satan the seat of God is in me and if you understand if you ever understand that the seat of God rests in you you will know that he that is B of God does not commit sin because he cannot sin why the Bible provides the answer because the seat of God in so the devil has been lying to you that's why you struggle with sin that's why you struggle so much with sin because Lucifer has been lying to you he's a liar he's the father of Lies every time he opens his mouth he is telling a lie but you shall know the truth and the truth set you free you are free this [Applause] [Music] morning amen amen so God he created Adam and put the image of the theophany not the theophany he byass his theophany but was an image of the theop an image of the word the theop it was the word image Adam Soul hallelujah [Music] hallelujah and that's the same thing you have in you if you are a seed of God that's what you mean when you say I'm a seed of God Seven Perfect spirits seven perfect Spirits is in you that's all once that's in you you shall overcome oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah those are the same seven spirits in the logos that overcame Lucifer in heaven it could not fall for his lies it could not fall for his tals it could not fall for his errors it could not fall for his false teachings it could not fall for his false doctrines it could not fall for his manipulations it could not fall for his tals that the in heaven the seven spirits that overcome in heaven is on the inside of you that's why you overcome false PRS false prophets false teachings false teachers false doctor hallelujah hallelujah that's why you overcome them all they cannot touch you hallelujah hallelujah provid teachers they cannot touch you glory glory because the seat of God the sit that overcame Lucifer's tales in [Music] heav and so God before he ever got in the flesh before form the Flesh and his creation what did God say what did God do he began to speak to this soul to speak to the soul be fruitful multiply subdue replenish began to speak to it God didn't speak to it maybe maybe not it was a no soul it was a positive assurance be e be an overcomer be fruitful multiply the Earth overcome be absolutely Total Control in your soul that's in your soul to sub Hallelujah to overcome to be fruitful to be productive glory to God every single day of your life am amen amen that's the real you and then after God had spoken and put all the Victory Secrets in the theop in Adam's Soul it formed the body of Flesh around Adam so why should any real believer who follow brother who follows brother br's message have a struggle with their flesh the flesh was not even in the picture God never spoke to your flesh God never spoke to Adam's flesh he spoke into his soul spoke seven spirits seven voices seven Thunders into his soul as a little seed of the world and then he formed the flesh around Adam and Adam became a living soul and in Adam in the Garden of Eden we saw the effects of that Soul living out of Adam Hallelujah soul to subdue to multiply to reproduce was in the Garden of Eden he was in absolute total control of the earth it could speak it could name it could control all nature he could do whatever he wanted to do because in his soul was a seat of almighty God Seven Perfect Spirits Hallelujah because notice notice when Adam was formed Adam was Adam was first created and then formed and you are also created as a little BR in your mother's womb and then the flesh is formed around [Applause] that because when Adam the creation God don't have anything to do with form he a Creator he's not a he's not a former of things he's not for reformation with his creation and his creation his creation what lucier could not create Lucifer can form things but the creation was a seed in the soul Lucifer could not touch that and God deals with his creation and if you know if you understand you are a creation of God your flesh is only a formation of God but your soul is a creation of God in other words only God Only God can create that not your father not your mother not Lucifer could create your soul [Applause] so what happened that Soul became a living Soul that's what lived it wasn't the flesh the flesh just followed where the soul gaed it to go to Hallelujah the soul the seven spirits on the inside was the controlled Tower to control the soul because when God Genesis 2:7 breath into Adam the Breath of Life the Bible says Man became a living Soul the seven spirits began to live it only needed the body to carry out its functions and Mal explained to us when Man became a living Soul at the same time a spirit and a and a soul of this world a nature of this world also came into Adam hallelujah hallelujah Glory Hallelujah because you have to have a nature of the world to pick up his Cutlas and Ste the garden and make things right in the garden to be a husband to Eve and what ever need to do as a human being he needed a nature of the world Earthly human nature to do all that but that human nature was in absolute subjection to the nature of God in his soul which was a seven perfect spirits and Man became a living Soul his soul lived out seven spirits lived out it was perfection it was Authority it was signs wonders Miracles it was spoken what power it was th sayth the Lord or keep still a tree never died before Adam Adam could name Adam could speak Adam could do whatever I wanted to do why the nature of God Seven Perfect Spirit the word image have been anointed into his flesh in Genesis 2:7 Hallelujah and that was the original Son of God on the face of the Earth [Applause] Hallelujah we live beneath our privileges we let this flesh this flesh controls us so much whereas in God's program whereas in God's program this flesh is only a s to the seed on the inside but I'll but I'll show you what happened glory to God Amen and that's how Adam and Eve lived they had instructions from God to subdue the Earth to be fruitful to multiply to go about their normal duties prove to Every Creature around that there were the Pinnacle of God's creation and those instructions were given to his soul and the flesh only carried out the instructions hallelujah hallelujah the flesh was [Applause] [Music] bound maybe she catch some breath she [Applause] are you understanding about the seven spirits the seven voices the seven Thunders it's more than a Doctrine it's more than it's not it's not any man's Revelation it's not even brother bram's Revelation is a revelation right stra from the man of Elohim so you have got to preach them seven voices them seven spirits there is no other way to overcome glory to God Amen So Adam amen he went about the garden overcoming and the devil didn't like didn't like that he had been kicked out he understood enough to know that in Adam in Eve was the same theophany that King out of heaven but he felt he had a chance here because he could sense they had a human nature to do things on the face of the Earth so the devil knew he couldn't mess around with their souls so he was going to come some other way and try to see if we could get them to fall what he tried in heaven he did not succeed here he was trying to see if he could succeed this time around so he came he came again a test of the word hallelujah hallu it wasn't Adam Adam could not be deceived but Eve was a byproduct Hallelujah and while men slept while Adam men slept it didn't mean was physically sleeping it means why you are not on your toes for a minute when you're a little slack when you let your discipline go down when you let down the bars when you go Carill us for a split second when you're not on your toes when you're not watching like you ought to watch the enemy comes in and it came to e watch watch the way he came to Eve that's the way he comes to you that's the way he makes many of you to fall down and bat your nails and feel you never had an experience and make the young people to feel this gospel doesn't work but Malachi for cried out let these virtues let them work in me oh lord is my prayer because the virtues work these virtues work the seven fund virtues they work Hallelujah they work in Adam and Eve before the fall and they work in you if you can only recognize Hallelujah [Applause] glory to God Amen so Lucifer came to Eve and said have God said it is not equal the scriptures so don't tell me it's quoting the scriptures or quoting the quot Lucifer in the serpent quoted the scriptures even Lucifer the Bible says has appeared as an angel of Light he appeared as an angel of of light in Eden like a friend Eve had God said going about going into homes and houses and churches to leave silly women astray Hallelujah told Eve God said and he said God said she quoted it was a quote War if quoted exactly said Malachi first said this is the quote so and so Hallelujah God said of every tree in the garden we should eat we should eat butn that one in the middle we should not eat so the devil that's right Prophet quote truth man he told he said but you know but you know he was getting to her he was working on her emotions he was working on her [Applause] emotions the devil if you're a SE of God he will never get you on the world he will have to manipulate you in your emotions that's who he is he's a liar he's a manipulator he takes the word of God and manipulat it manipulates your mind getting your [Applause] emotions got in our emotions and said God knows you'll be a Creator God knows you know it's true God doesn't want you to take the fruit or that tree in the middle but you know one thing God did not show you one thing God did not show you let me go with Mysteries above what he not show you let me show you what God did not show you he's a liar and the father of lies don't you believe it say what the prophet said Glory say what the prophet said be dogmatic be fanatical say only what the prophet said don't let no man no Pastor no minister no Sleek talking person take off of that word death L on that on that road spiritual death place on that road if the prophet did not say it don't you receive it don't use 10 for it don't use stand for these crazy interpretations hear me real good I said don't you stand for these crazy interpretations and I'm watching my words here I'm conscious of my words exactly this interpretations do nobody any good that just talize your mind and put an arrogant Spirit on you to cancel people out to validate Yourself by pushing other people [Music] down to valid so so Lucifer the serpent told Eve this is one thing God kept away from you that one thing is what you are going to be a creator he said God told us that but said we should wait until the seven their voices yes you've been waiting you have been waiting for so long this is how it is done and began to touch her her emotions and the Bible said when she saw she saw her eyes the lust of the eyes the emotions it made her feel good she saw it was a tree good for food he felt good about it her emotions was all over say wow this feels good whatever controls your emotions controls you and the devil knows that if you can only get your emotions he will control you how amen amen how about all the boys all the young girls all the Believers that do wrong things take for example fornication people you know it's wrong you know you should not do that but the boy touches the girl she feels good in her mind she knows I should not be doing this but her emotions is under the control of another man's touch and whatever controls your emotions controls you you'll tell the word of God to wait a little bit I will repent later but this feels too good this PR to good whatever controls your emotions controls you hallelujah hallelujah but you shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free so after the fall what happened if took the fruit her emotions what God said not to do intellectually she knew the right thing to do but what her emotions were compromised she let down the bars and took the fruit and that's why we're in this problem till today and the Bible said she gave also to her husband and he took the fruit with her and the Bible father said Adam was not deceived intellectually Adam knew what was right to do he knew it was wrong to take the fruit yet he still did it oh hallelujah hallelujah let somebody shout hallelujah me Hallelujah glory amen what happened right away right away when they committed that sin the Bible said the day you eat of that fruit that day you die instantly they died death enter the human race and that nature of the world became a nature of death and from that time there was a war of two Natures in Adam and Eve in every man woman boy and girl the G of Eden Hallelujah Glory you may be seated [Applause] glory amen so after the four another nature is activated in Eve now brother con was talking yesterday activating the spiritual pathway another pathway an evil nature pathway was activated in the human race then hallelujah hallelujah and you saw in Eden that pathway of human nature operates mostly through the emotions to get you off of the wrong to get you to get you into the wrong rather it comes at the at your emotions and that's why the Bible has a lot to say about your emotions you and I can't really can't really Define what emotions really are nobody has been really able to Define emotions perly but we all experience emotions and the Bible talks about a lot of emotions anger jealousy Las feel the leing feel the leaving L of the eyes L of the Flesh of life our emotions things that we feel once the devil can get us on that rout he'll get us to do anything to God Amen sure amen when you and I when we behave badly when we be badly if we're only going by human reasoning because the devil going into our emotions and going into our mind to reason the word of God by her mind what she intellectually to get her to understand intellectually we hear the word just to understand the word so he can drop into your soul the devil got her to be reasoning the word so it gets your emotions first and then you reason it away the boy or girl the boy or girl that commits fornication knows it's wrong but when our emotions is all through [Music] it she begins to reason the word she tells herself or he tells himself after all I'm going to marry her I will marry her so it's all right he tells himself God will forgive me God understands I didn't want to do it but I just fell it begins to reason this brother so and so that big Minister that big brother he also fail so it doesn't matter if little me Falls God understands God will forgive me also the devil gets your emotions and it binds up your reasoning he winds you up in your your reasoning but he who the son of man sets free is free indeed glory to God [Applause] Amen so what are you saying here what they saying here the devil amen guess our emotions first and guess our reason that's how this evil nature Works God nature in the God's nature and the Soul works by being in absolute control over your emotions and over your reasoning faculties hear me real good God's wording the soul the control tower controls your mind controls your emotions in your mind controls your reason in your mind controls your affection imagination reasoning powers Hallelujah God's word in the soul for Lucifer that snake that sa in the soul that evil nature of the world it comes at your emotions and through that it makes you reasing the world Hallelujah hallu and that's the war of the two Natures hallelujah hallelujah glory to God Amen you are in Romans 7 what I would I would not I know I shouldn't do this so why do I keep doing this things why do I what's wrong what's wrong with me you ever feel that way how many ever feel that way Raise Your Hands Up hallelujah oh come on we all feel that way every now and then but here is a secret Jesus Christ the Lamb of God which takes away the sins of the world already t for you and you don't have to be in that dilemma you don't have to be in that confusion God Amen Christ already delivered you but you need to understand what's going on so you can squeeze Satan out like you were told last night to squeeze the devil out because the devil gets out your emotions and your reasoning Powers but God's word bypasses your emotions byes your reasoning and get into the soul and the Soul controls your emotions controls your reasoning Powers Lin them up behind the world hallelujah hallelujah amen amen glory to God amen glory so here's what you need to understand that intellectually we hearing the word of God intellectually we hearing the word the message you let see a while let's CL a bit here [Applause] Glory brother bham said intellectually we he the message that God has given us so we understand from that that we human beings we operate at an intellectual level to understand any at all as I'm speaking to you now if you're a little baby your intellect is not ripe enough understand what I'm saying as I'm speaking now even if you're an adult if your intellect hasn't been trained in the English language you cannot understand what I'm saying you have to listen to the French to understand what I'm saying and if you don't understand French you listen to the English understand what I'm saying so intellectually we are hearing the message that God has given us simply means intellectually our intellect our human Spirit our brains our minds we understand words and things in this world hallelujah hallelujah we understand the mystery the message intellectually so you can understand intellectually and you can think that is a spiritual Revelation no it is not because intellectually first you have to understand before it will become a spiritual Revelation intellectual understanding mental Faith mental faith [Applause] GL to God Amen I feel religious but too many people feel because intellectually they understand the message that spiritual Faith said no that's mental Faith mental Faith brings you to a recognition that you a sinner you you need Christ but that won't get you saved just recognize it a spiritual faith that can push you beyond the Realms of mental Faith mental faith can only go so far but spiritual faith is what takes into the Realms of God into the ramps of the Overcomer Hallelujah so don't think church because you understand intellectually that means you are the message a Muslim a Muslim will understand what I'm saying what yesterday morning what last night because it's spoken in a language that he understands there are words and human beings that we are we live in a world of words that's how we communicate words are the medium of exchange the medium of expression speak words that's how we understand one another so if a Muslim hears me this morning he understands what I'm saying or does he make him be in the message does that put him in the message intellectually we're hearing the message does not put us in the message intellectually we understand the Mysteries does not mean we have the Mysteries that's only the intellect to help you understand can somebody shout [Applause] hallelujah so we operate at an intellectual level and any word at all not just the message we understand at an intellectual level I can put it this way intellectually we are hearing words from school watch from our parents watch from our jobs watch from our subjects in school intellectually we understand those things and intellectually we understand school work the was in school every word in every field of human endeav we have to understand intellectually first and you students that go to school and you want to be a doctor and they begin to teach you about the things of a doctor about the anatomy of the human body and the physiology of the human body intellectually you understand it but does that make you a doctor right away no it does not it just giving you an understanding to help you to become a doctor so intellectually understanding the message doesn't give us a revelation it's just mental Faith to help us on our journey to a spiritual revelation [Applause] how many you understand say Amen oh let's try and wind down here glory to God Amen and when you live at that intellectual realm you will think because I understand intellectually the Bible said thou shal not steal thou shall not lie that shall not commit fornication that shall not commit adultery that shall not bear false witness thou shall not cover thy brother's Goods thou sh not take the name of the Lord th God in vain and all those instructions in the Bible intellectually we understand it and you will think automatically we should just comply and do what we know to be the right because intellectually we know what is right to do because intellectually we have understood thou sh not steal we know it is not good to steal it is not right to do these things is not right to hate your brother it's right to cover another man's Goods we know all these things so why don't we do them why when it gets to their actions what we know to do when it's time to act and do them we do them it's very simple the Garden of Eden because when you are that intellectual realm your intellect and your emotions what you know to be the right thing and your emotions are fighting for control is the war of your evil nature your evil nature is at war with the S what you know the young boy is telling himself I should not do drugs I should not commit adult I should not commit fornication I should not steal your emotions is telling you never mind never mind so there's a war your emotions passes what you know your emotions your reasoning poers and because human beings the way we are made the way we are constructed and Lucifer knew that science tells you that I don't want to get into that but the way we are wired the way we are constructed and Lucifer knew that that's why he went for the emotions Lucifer knows that the way we are wired we experience things emotionally first before we reason them out we experience things emotionally first before our reasoning kicks into place many times you're going to a restaurant or you young children you come back from school you you get get in the house you smell your mother's cooking once you smell the food you feel like [Music] you haven't even Reen yet what food is that your all Factory senses your taste senses start feeling the saliva in your mouth spoking to your mother at all because your emotions are aroused before you know what food it is the devil knows our emotions will always almost all the time overpower our reasoning that's why intellectually knowing the word is not enough because most of the time your emotions will overpower the reasoning will overpower your intellect if emotions overpowered Reon overpowered what she need to be the truth so it's not enough to intellectually know the truth you have to go beyond that when you are that realm of intellect you are the humanistic realm and what happens you in a war what is right to do your emotions F your intellect back and forth and back and forth example I just told you about Peter we read about I'm fix the cloth Peter in the Bible Jesus told him you'll deny me Peter before the crows no he said he said one of one of you is going to deny me three times before theup Peter said you know Peter was very self-sufficient very of himself I love the Lord I love the message nobody can tell me I know what's right to do he won't even take it from the word Jesus said he said Lord and he was the one Jesus didn't mention his name if they all all of us I know they don't love you like I do they don't love the message like I do they're not loving their Apostle like I do they're not loving all your ministers like I do if they deny you I will not deny you Jesus knew Peter was oscillating between an intellectual understanding and a spiritual Revelation even though he had a spiritual revelation so having a spiritual Revelation doesn't keep you immune from the devil's attempts to pull you out of there how much less if all you have is an intellectual understanding so Peter said if they deny you I won't deny you and you said Peter you the man before the crosss you shall Den me three times me Lord not me if I will have to I will die for you that was Peter's desire he wasn't lying that's what he wanted to do hallelujah hallelujah Peter intellectually knew he should not deny the Lord intellectually knew that it was wrong for him to deny the Lord Peter was warned that you are warned not to do the wrong things that you do sometimes Peter was warn before they wrong ever confronted him and yet when they wrong confronted him watch what happened his emotions kicked in his emotions kicked in the young M said aren't you one of them Peter was faced with death he was faced with death his emotions fear the fear of [Applause] death and his emotions overpowered his intellectual understanding and his emotions control his behavior his emotions him to lie emotion him to tell a lie to curse to deny Jesus Christ to commit fornication whatever it is you atted to do and Peter said me I don't know that man a young girl a young girl and he had the Keys of the Kingdom a young girl could make him lie to make him curse to make him deny the Lord how many times you deny the Lord and you feel it doesn't matter how many times we let the fear of friends the fear of our boys and girls in school on the job in the neighborhood overpowers our emotions and we deny the Lord we curse we lie we do things we shouldn't do because we are afraid to be different the Lord another saw him and immediately Peter knew I Den the Lord he had warned me Peter fa next time I'm going to stand I going to stand intellectually he had heard the words his his intellectual Powers when play now when you operate realm you will always lose because your emotions will always over overow your intellectual understanding hear me real good your emotions will always overpower your intellectual understanding so right away another G I know you you are one of them fear fear shame of been a Gile been identified with Jesus intellectually he knew what was right intellectually he knew I should die for him I should say yes I'm one of them intellectually knew that but intellectual Powers were no match for his emotional Powers again Peter said no I don't know that man Jesus that man to him he wanted no identification your emotions will always overpower your intellectual understanding youve got to go beyond [Applause] that and Peter said it will not happen the third time isn't that how you are you do wrong nobody needs to tell you intellectually you know it's wrong to do those things you have been too well taught by the seven series and seven message of Malachi 4 to know the right thing to know how to think how to be how to speak how to behave yourself how you sisters to dress what company should keep you brother how you should be in the neighborhood and Peter fail is not going to happen again but while the emotions were not taken care of it happened the third time and when it happened the third time felt such a hopelessness it felt so useless I feel the Lord I feel the Lord let him down he saw Jesus walking up calvary's Mountain 2,000 years ago this Weekender WEP he said look at me that my is carry up carrying up the mountain and just to stand for him he wanted me he told me and I couldn't stand for me what's wrong with me what is wrong with me and P we bitly Peter was grieved at himself he was grieved at himself but being grieved at himself will not solve the problem being gried at yourself will not solve the problem because Jesus already solved the problem and Jesus the resurrected Lord Jesus Christ on Easter Sunday morning Easter Sunday morning up from the gravey AR with a magic triumph over his Force he arose a Victor from the dark domain to raise Peter up to raise Peter up hallelujah hallelujah and when he rose from the dead he knew Peter he knew Peter loved him he knew Peter didn't want to do the wrong he knew Peter needed an understanding of how to overcome of how to overcome so when he rose from the dead he said go tell Peter and my disciples that I will meet them in Galilee he's given Peter here's your lord is the god of the Second Chance is the god of the second chance he's going to give Peter a second chance he's going to try him again he's going to try him again if you have failed if you have failed the Lord don't be mad at yourself Joseph Joseph told his brothers don't be mad at yourself he said come near to me I am Joseph your brother I am Joseph Perfection your brother don't be M yourself come near to me and Jesus the reason resurrected Lord Jesus Christ the lord of isas said this morning Easter again it's Easter again is a resurrection morning in your soul a resurrection is here for you and you and you is is [Applause] again the reason resurrected Lord came to Peter to show him the victory how to overcome his emotions how to keep emotions under to get rid of the sex of the fornication of the L the Hallelujah again again tell your neighbor again tell your neighbor the resurrection morning is here [Applause] is it's sh again the resurrected Lord Jesus Christ the reason reason resurrected Lord Jesus Christ came to Peter and the same way he comes to you this morning he wants Peter to understand it's going to take more than your intellectual understanding that's only mental Faith this goes for the minister and the pulpit goes for the pastor go for the evangelist go for everybody go for the young Bo go for the young girl int is to help you on your way spiritual understanding because the victory the victory is hidden it is spiritual understanding spiritual Revelation which is real faith that recognizes only the word your intellectual understanding recognizes your emotions your intellectual understanding recognizes how you feel you like this one you don't like this one you feel good this one don't like me your intellectual understanding recognizes that but your spiritual Revelation your spiritual understanding recognizes only the word of God the word says and the word of God holds your emotions captive hold your reasoning Powers captive and your emotions line up behind the world your reasoning Powers line up behind the world oh hallelujah oh Hallelujah so Jesus he came to Peter and told him in the words that a spiritual understanding gives you because Peter in s Luke 16 Matthew 16 had a spiritual Revelation but here was Peter living like one who have no spiritual Revelation so even though you have a spiritual Revelation you still got to be on your toes it doesn't automatically make whatever you do to be right or whatever you say or whatever you preach spiritual Revelation recognizes only the word of God hallelujah it makes your emotions to shut up and recognize the word of God spiritual Revelation changes your thinking because as a man think in his help so is here spiritual Revelation aligns your thinking behind the word of God the word of God behind becomes your thinking not your emotions not what you feel not what you think somebody does to you but from the inside in your soul spiritual Revelation takes over from your control tower Hallelujah glory to God Amen so Jesus he told Peter when you were young when you were young you could do anything you want to do your intellect all the intellectual understanding thing is a lack of maturity because it only help you to understand that's not the end Insight the end Insight is the spiritual Revelation that recognize only the word of God and controls your life you live a life that measures up with the Statue of a perfect man and by spiritual Revelation theone you overcome the loss of the eyes the L of the Flesh and the pr of Life Jesus is telling Peter Peter there's a growing up to do here you get a grow you got to die and need understanding it's just intellect little children have that babies have that they got to grow to grow you to die I'm mature in Christ I'm mature in Grace you submit to another which is the word in the soul the control tower not an intellectual understanding but a spiritual revelation to take you by the hand and lead you where you would not go your natural self will go where your emotions want to go and make your intellect to follow it for a spiritual revelation will lead you where the word of God wants you to go a spiritual Revelation changes your thinking a spiritual Revelation changes your perspective a spiritual Revelation changes your world view it turns you around it goes way deep down on the inside it changes your perspective the way you see things the way you view things it changes your thinking patter it changes your words it changes what you think of yourself where you feel I could not spiritual Revelation let you understand I can I will I can live this life because Jesus Christ is the Lamb of God that has returned to me as a revelation of the word of God of the seven spirits from the back of the Bible as my soul and is guiding me leading me to a death leading me to where I would not normally want to go but leading me into the statue of a perfect man Hallelujah Jesus was trying to show Peter feel your love feel your love will fail you when you with intellectual understanding F your love you love those in your group you can't stand those who are not in your group you love those in your church you don't like that other Church your church is better than that other Church Lord that's what many of us Ser god with your love for the love of God he makes his son to shine on the just and the unjust he loves every man he loves everybody whether they in your group or they're not in your group whether they in the Thunders or they are not in the Thunders you love everybody the love of God that's maturity that's maturity GR in Grace when your reasoning tells you this man spoke evil about you you should not love him you should avoid him the Holy Ghost love just F Your Love reasoning and emotions to shut up your God your father loves the just and the unjust your father tells you as much as he lies within you to live a peace with all men Hallelujah Hallelujah Jesus was showing Peter here because the third time Jesus asked him in feel your love do you like me because that's the life you leing Peter but want you come up either into aapa Lord charity that never fails Peter you've got to come up feel your love will always faill you love will only love those who love you and hate those who don't love you but will love those who hate you will love those who desp hate you feel your love will sin feel your love will rationalize love will give excuses but love a spiritual Revelation gives no excuses because it recognizes only the word of God and whatever is going to take is going to die that death of Glory to God Amen Oh Glory GL let me let me close this quot here H glory to God amen Amen brother bam is said here excuse me let me find this here uh Glory the message God provide a place of worship Lana 11265 I believe the church is beginning to hear the message and begin to understand it but friend listen we've got to lay in the presence of the son intellectual understanding lay that's that's to bring you in go further lay in the pr of the song nobody can do that for you you got to do that yourself we've got to be ripened maturity what Jesus was telling Peter our faith isn't ripe your mental Faith isn't ripe our faith isn't ripe we've got to lay in the Pres of the S we've got to be ripen our faith isn't ripe intellectually we hearing the message intellectually we are hearing the message that God has and seeing the signs that he showed us I'm proving it by the Bible it's there but oh how the church needs to lay in his presence till it tenders up you know and get sweet in the spirit so that he can B down sometimes in speaking the message you'll get H how to break in like that how's it breaking like that because you got to clch your nail to make it whole for once the church once gets it once the church once gets it that your intellect will faill you all the time because your emotions will always override it once you know that from here on out your emotions need to understand the word of God also your emotions to be under the control of the word of God and that happens by changing your thinking to begin to think from your soul from the word of God not from here whatever the word says that's what it is the word says sin shall not have dominion over you your emotion says that's not possible but the word says oh yes that is possible and that's what you say hallelujah and God will make your body obey your confession because when you say it once you say it your intellect lines up your emotions line up and you obey the word that's how it starts that's how it works you change your thinking of the matter where the devil tells you you cannot do it you cannot live above sin what does the word say the word says sin shall not have dominion over you you confess what the word says and when you say that God will make your emotions obey your confession God will make your intellect obey your confession and your body will line up where your emotions doesn't want to go your spiritual Revelation on the word of God gues it to go where the word wants you to go the statue of a perfect man oh Hallelujah we got a king's message is a king's message friends let's recognize it we have been called together together for the sign of the trumpet Glory God Amen hallelujah hallelujah said here hallelujah hallelujah amen is said too much of our faith is on Blasphemous names and the biggest part of our faith of all these Revelations we are talking about is mental faith and intellectual understanding you can explain all the Thunders all the seven Spirit from the back of the Bible the prophet said a lot of it mental Faith by hearing the word of God it brings us to a mental recognition of God same thing intellectually we understanding the word but but if this coming from above coming from charity above that se in the soul seven perfect a spiritual Revelation Glory father if that re ever strikes this there a Godly spiritual Faith then what does that Faith do what does that spiritual Faith do that Faith recognizes only the word of God no matter what anything else says it only recognizes the word because in the beginning was the word and the word his God and the Word was God and the word is still God and the Word was made flesh and dwell Among Us and when the word itself when the word itself when the word itself is pouring into a spiritual Faith like it was pouring into Adam's spiritual faith in Genesis 126 and mental Faith becomes a spiritual Revelation so understanding the word by mental faith is to bring you to this spot to where your mental Faith changes into a spiritual Revelation and a spiritual Revelation only recognizes the word you don't stand for no falsehood it don't stand for no false teachings it don't stand for yourself doing wrong stuff either and Jesus said Upon This Rock upon this I'll build my church see not upon a mental conception of church joining not upon a mental conception of that but upon the Revelation when them streams of Grace are SP into that mental faith that intellectual understanding that you've got upon this when the spiritual Revelation takes over your mental faith Hallelujah and the word of God hallelujah amen then upon this spiritual Revelation I will build my church and the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against it loss of the eyes loss of the flesh the pr of life will never Prevail against you that's not your pastor's words that's the words of the Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world fornication adultery evil suing habits drugs never Prevail against a spiritual revelation God Amen oh Hallelujah glory to God amen glory now coming from the Holy Spirit he will give you Supernatural Faith spiritual Faith at the bottom then that real spiritual faith recognize only the word you fish out the false word you don't stand for it no matter what anybody else says it don't do no good that only knows the word somebody says there Miracles is passed thi only knows the word somebody says there's no such a thing as the power of the Holy Ghost th Faith only knows the word that's the real spiritual Faith that's right it only knows the Hallelujah hallu glory to God am let's recognize it friends Oh Glory to God amen amen amen am amen so amen am your your your your mental Faith amen is powered it's powered by feel your love but your spiritual faith is and your mental Faith Fe Your Love Will
