[29:12] brother so the scripture that is most
[29:15] convenient tonight is Ephesians
[29:18] 4:11 and he gave some Apostles and some
[29:22] pastors and some
[29:25] evangelists uh some Prophets
[29:28] he gave some Apostles some prophets some
[29:30] evangelists some pastors and teachers
[29:33] that the most for the perfecting of the
[29:36] Saints everybody that is the scripture
[29:38] that we are gathered here
[29:40] under
[29:42] so I came to the Lord in I was baptized
[29:47] in 1974
[29:50] November and in
[29:54] 1975 October brother Carl the pastor was
[29:57] asking for some young Brothers to give
[29:59] an exhortation who feel they have a call
[30:02] on their lives and so Brothers went up
[30:04] and I was the last one I went up October
[30:07] the 10th 1975 so that's less than a year
[30:09] in the message went and give a little
[30:12] exhortation and they found it was the
[30:14] Lord had helped me by God's grace and
[30:17] then another one in December
[30:20] there and uh in January I can't remember
[30:23] the date of 76 that just a year and a
[30:27] couple months in the message I came we
[30:30] had five Services a week in them days
[30:32] all right Saturday was a a prayer night
[30:35] for who wants to come Saturday evening
[30:37] we had Tuesday Thursday Friday Sunday
[30:41] and Saturday so Friday night I came into
[30:45] the service and uh when I came into the
[30:49] service I realized that bral wasn't
[30:52] there the pastor wasn't there and they
[30:54] said that he has uh he left the church
[30:57] with in my hands oh my I Minister twice
[31:00] I exalt a year and something in the
[31:03] message he left the church in my
[31:05] hands so I had to carry on that night by
[31:09] Grace by God's grace and we were
[31:11] studying now because one of the nights
[31:14] Thursday night was like tape study so we
[31:18] were studying blasphemer names right so
[31:22] I had to carry home the tape now in them
[31:24] days a tape is a big player player is a
[31:27] big thing that you had to live LIF up
[31:29] and you have big reels on it everybody
[31:31] know the big reel that in them
[31:34] days January 76 so I carried it home to
[31:39] study blasphemer names because I had to
[31:42] continue from where Bara left off he
[31:45] will play a portion and then explain
[31:47] give some light on it and so I for me
[31:50] have to try and do follow
[31:52] suit so I carried it home and when I put
[31:55] it on it had a a I don't know if it's a
[31:59] interpretation of tongues or some
[32:00] prophetic utterance but there was
[32:03] something in the beginning of
[32:04] Blasphemous names on that old big reel
[32:08] that is not on the present day one and
[32:11] it was a
[32:12] commission and with my with with my
[32:16] little where I was there it was like
[32:18] something talking to me calling me now
[32:20] into the
[32:22] ministry now brother da on Saturday
[32:26] night ministered a
[32:29] masterpiece for those who were there it
[32:31] was a
[32:35] masterpiece and the title was the title
[32:37] was the shepherd's
[32:40] business and and that is why I was

[45:42] add his Blessing to the reading of his
[45:44] holy word God bless you you may please
[45:47] be seated all right so tonight if the
[45:50] Lord will be our he which I trust to him
[45:53] a
[45:54] will I just want to uh encourage us on
[45:59] something the Lord impressed strongly
[46:01] upon my heart and uh the prophet in one
[46:05] of the messages call it the beautiful
[46:07] revelation of the word of the Living
[46:11] God yeah when it was describing it he
[46:14] said the purpose of God can never be
[46:19] defeated and they call it the beautiful
[46:22] revelation of the word of the Living God
[46:25] so I want to speak on the purpose of God
[46:28] tonight I know many years ago I spoke on
[46:30] a subject I'm sure maybe it will be at
[46:33] Bethlehem Tabernacle on that the purpose
[46:35] of God might stand but tonight we want
[46:39] to speak on the purpose of God itself
[46:42] amen and I trust that the Lord will
[46:44] bless us all right uh
[46:48] before I start jumping or running I want
[46:53] to patiently read one or two quotations
[46:56] here for a background uh in the message
[47:00] Expressions 62-
[47:03] 0313 62-
[47:06] 0313 paragraph 10 if it's the
[47:10] same the prophet said and everything is
[47:14] here to serve a
[47:17] purpose everything amen even in this
[47:20] room tonight everything you are seeing
[47:23] here they weren put here for a
[47:25] decoration
[47:27] amen they are put here because they have
[47:30] a purpose they are serving they have a
[47:33] function they are performing from the
[47:36] mic to the pulpit to the speakers to the
[47:39] pianos to the instruments to the uh what
[47:42] you call it the technology here
[47:45] everything is here to serve a purpose
[47:49] even the air conditioners it serving the
[47:51] purpose cooling us just as we are here
[47:55] to serve a a
[47:57] purpose
[47:59] amen we are all here for a purpose of
[48:04] God we are all here for a purpose of God
[48:09] now I want you to watch the language of
[48:11] the Prophet here he said if we can find
[48:15] what that purpose
[48:17] is and then serve it
[48:22] well you and I are not going to invent a
[48:25] purpose for ourselves
[48:29] we are not going to design a purpose for
[48:32] our
[48:34] lives purpose is beyond you the reason
[48:38] we burn energy and we waste our time and
[48:42] life becomes frustration is because we
[48:45] are trying to do what God has already
[48:48] done the domain of God is developing or
[48:53] designing a purpose for every life
[48:57] please underline it in your heart and to
[49:00] make it simple for you I will make it
[49:02] easy
[49:04] now this mic that I'm holding in my
[49:09] hand is not the one that created or
[49:12] manufactured
[49:14] itself are you with me
[49:17] sir a producer produced this
[49:20] mic now what informed the
[49:23] production is a need to be met
[49:29] somebody sat down and say if we can make
[49:34] create something or produce something
[49:37] that can amplify the voice of a speaker
[49:41] it will make a large audience to hear
[49:43] him without straining his
[49:46] [Applause]
[49:47] voice I want to make it as simple
[49:50] because I've got friends here who must
[49:51] get it they've been encouraging me since
[49:54] we came they will come and tell me I
[49:56] enjoy that service you made it so simple
[49:59] so I'm conscious of them I'm now our
[50:02] reviv is under 20s so if you are above
[50:07] 20 you would need to come down to our
[50:10] level all right okay God bless you all
[50:14] right but I hope you are getting it now
[50:18] they said let's make something that we
[50:20] amplify people's voice now when they
[50:23] were conceiving this this has not been
[50:25] made
[50:28] but it was that
[50:30] conception that fashioned
[50:34] this it was that conception that
[50:37] invented the production of
[50:40] this so the purpose of these existed
[50:44] before it was
[50:49] made are you with me and if I bring it
[50:53] to you because all I'm saying tonight is
[50:55] a story of your life
[50:57] life if I bring it to you amen God who
[51:02] created you and
[51:04] I found a gap or a void to be
[51:11] filled and he looked in his eternal
[51:14] touch because brother Braham said
[51:17] purpose is an eternal
[51:20] plan and you will agree with the prophet
[51:22] because we also thought that everything
[51:26] God wanted to think
[51:29] about he
[51:31] thought before it started
[51:34] time in other word before Genesis 1 that
[51:37] says in the
[51:39] beginning God created heaven and earth
[51:43] in the beginning shows the beginning of
[51:45] time are you catching it before that
[51:49] beginning everything God wanted to have
[51:53] he already had
[51:56] [Applause]
[51:57] God is not presently
[51:59] thinking and the thought he has had
[52:02] cannot be improved upon cannot be
[52:06] adicted cannot
[52:08] be cannot be Abed or
[52:12] upgraded amen if it's suceptible to
[52:15] death then God will not be
[52:18] God it is those who know better that
[52:21] upgrades their
[52:22] thinking God does not know better he is
[52:26] the Ancient of Days so before he started
[52:31] time all the thinking he wanted to have
[52:34] he already
[52:36] had so each day is an expression of his
[52:40] eternal thoughts and I'm so happy to
[52:43] tell you tonight that you were part of
[52:45] that
[52:49] thought but God doesn't think God
[52:52] doesn't think for
[52:53] nothing he thought of you because he has
[52:56] the purpose for you to
[53:00] serve your purpose was the reason you
[53:03] were
[53:05] here when God looks he said okay there
[53:09] must be somebody to F this gap for me
[53:14] and you see each person is unique in its
[53:17] own
[53:18] purpose that is why I don't believe in
[53:21] accidental
[53:22] birth or a conception by mistake
[53:26] that is the thought of a man those
[53:30] things don't come by mistake they comes
[53:33] by God's
[53:35] [Applause]
[53:38] predestination you did not happen by
[53:41] accident you came because God wanted you
[53:44] to
[53:45] come there couldn't have been enough
[53:47] contraceptives of Family Planning that
[53:50] will have prevented your birth because
[53:53] God has a purpose for you to come and
[53:58] [Applause]
[54:04] serve so your purpose was the reason
[54:08] that you were created your purpose
[54:11] existed before you exist you were only
[54:15] brought to fill in that purpose and
[54:17] don't just think about it
[54:20] spiritually even
[54:22] physically in all your daily work of
[54:25] life amen the Reason God brought you is
[54:29] because there's a purpose that you must
[54:35] serve now if you agree with that then it
[54:40] follows that I am not responsible for my
[54:46] purpose somebody is responsible for it
[54:50] so I Will Not Waste My Time designing
[54:52] one or trying to invent one
[54:56] what I need to do is to
[54:59] find let's bring that quotation and see
[55:02] what the prophet
[55:04] said you must discover your purpose it
[55:09] will make life a lot easier for you okay
[55:12] bring the quotation my brother God bless
[55:14] you it said we are all here for a
[55:17] purpose of God yeah if we can find what
[55:21] that purpose it not if we can design one
[55:26] not if we can develop one you don't make
[55:30] yourself who you are the one who brought
[55:33] you made you who you
[55:36] are and he made you
[55:38] uniquely amen and let me tell you it
[55:41] doesn't have replacement for
[55:49] you it doesn't have he doesn't have an
[55:52] alternative I'm not fantasizing you I
[55:54] mean every word of that
[55:59] you know it is human being the concept
[56:02] of
[56:03] Alternatives shows human
[56:06] limitations because we are not in charge
[56:09] of every factors of life but we are
[56:13] dealing with somebody who knows the hen
[56:17] from the beginning we are dealing with
[56:19] somebody who has the length and breadth
[56:23] of all situations so if it takes a
[56:26] decision it is
[56:29] permanent that is why King Solomon said
[56:32] whatsoever the Lord has done it shall be
[56:35] forever no man can Hur to it no man can
[56:39] take away from it but God has done it
[56:42] that made me fear before
[56:43] [Applause]
[56:48] him so if we can find what that
[56:53] purposes and serve it well
[56:59] that is always a challenge of
[57:01] mankind brother Braham spoke of Daniel
[57:04] he said Daniel had only one purpose he
[57:06] said he purposed to do the purpose of
[57:09] God that's a
[57:12] quotation he proposed to do the purpose
[57:16] of God that whatever God has ordained me
[57:19] for whatever he brought me here for
[57:22] brother brah said somebody is
[57:24] responsible for your in
[57:27] [Applause]
[57:28] [Music]
[57:30] here so what you and I need to do is to
[57:34] go back to him if times are blurry if
[57:38] the road is not clear why am I
[57:42] here and brother brah said in the in the
[57:45] message I have Sinister star he said for
[57:48] an act that will be honest sincere and
[57:51] will believe God has a way of revealing
[57:55] his mind
[57:56] [Music]
[57:57] [Applause]
[57:58] oh what peace we often forfeit oh what
[58:01] needless pain we bear oh what struggles
[58:04] we make because we did not find our
[58:09] purpose we are just we are just
[58:12] working let me tell you when God give
[58:15] rest he gives rest he said come unto me
[58:19] all you that labor and a Heavenly Laden
[58:22] and I will give you rest he said for my
[58:25] yoke is easy and my burden is light if
[58:30] you want an easy Yol if you want a light
[58:33] burden you must come to Jesus to find
[58:37] out the reason that he brought you
[58:40] [Applause]
[58:49] [Music]
[58:52] here you love him
[58:56] all right I will hang it here
[58:58] first I will hang it here first but
[59:01] don't take it
[59:02] away if we can find that
[59:05] purpose and serve it
[59:08] well now every creation under
[59:14] Heaven God brought them for either of
[59:18] these two
[59:19] things you are either brought for the
[59:23] purpose of God
[59:26] or brought for a purpose for
[59:33] [Applause]
[59:35] God all is
[59:40] purpose you are either brought for a
[59:42] purpose for the purpose of God or for a
[59:46] purpose for God don't worry I will prove
[59:48] my
[59:52] case in the message Christ is the
[59:55] mystery of God God
[59:57] revealed the prophet said God has a
[59:59] three-fold purpose is that right he
[1:00:03] wants to reveal
[1:00:06] himself he wants to have
[1:00:08] preeminence in the body of those who
[1:00:11] accepted the revelation of
[1:00:13] himself and by that preeminence he will
[1:00:16] restore them back to
[1:00:18] Hidden are you C it threefold purpose so
[1:00:23] if you enjoyed all the three
[1:00:27] lessons you are not enjoying it by
[1:00:30] chance you are enjoying it by
[1:00:33] predestination you are in the purpose of
[1:00:37] God because God is using you to express
[1:00:41] and to tell the story of his Redemption
[1:00:45] [Applause]
[1:00:46] plan is that clear enough but
[1:00:50] now there are those who will make this
[1:00:54] expression
[1:00:56] these manifestations
[1:01:00] necessary because God in the
[1:01:03] beginning the prophet taught us that
[1:01:06] before we could even call him
[1:01:08] God he had at the back part of his mind
[1:01:12] a desire to be
[1:01:14] God then he wasn't he didn't have people
[1:01:17] to worship him neither Angel no people
[1:01:20] like me and you amen but he also desire
[1:01:24] them to be known Beyond being
[1:01:29] God because when you know him as God
[1:01:32] Alone the relationship will be a bit
[1:01:38] formal but he wants something
[1:01:41] personal something Beyond
[1:01:44] formal something that you can relate
[1:01:48] [Applause]
[1:01:50] with so this is why he decided that
[1:01:54] apart from being known before be be as
[1:01:56] God I also want to be known in all my
[1:02:01] abilities which in spiritual language we
[1:02:03] call
[1:02:05] attributes what are his abilities he has
[1:02:08] the ability to save he can heal it can
[1:02:12] redeem it can deliver and many more it
[1:02:15] can
[1:02:18] provide but you see God is a god of
[1:02:22] perfection amen and it takes
[1:02:24] imperfection
[1:02:26] to make those ability
[1:02:29] [Applause]
[1:02:33] necessary are you catching it it takes
[1:02:36] imperfection to make those abilities
[1:02:39] attributes necessary so what will God do
[1:02:42] he must design a
[1:02:44] creator for a purpose of bringing
[1:02:48] imperfection to make the expression of
[1:02:51] his attribute necessary now the Creator
[1:02:54] that will make it necess necessary will
[1:02:56] not be a
[1:02:57] partaker of the blessings of it amen but
[1:03:01] those who are in the purpose of God will
[1:03:04] be the
[1:03:05] beneficiaries of every attribute from
[1:03:08] their soul to their Spirit to their
[1:03:11] body are you catching it so that was
[1:03:15] God's Divine Design and that is why you
[1:03:17] will hear the prophet say and when Satan
[1:03:20] has brought to pass that which is
[1:03:23] necessary to the purpose of God
[1:03:26] Satan bringing to pass that which is
[1:03:28] necessary to God's Own purpose but Satan
[1:03:31] will not be a partaker he will not be a
[1:03:35] beneficiary but it will make it
[1:03:37] necessary so Satan is designed for a
[1:03:40] purpose for
[1:03:42] [Applause]
[1:03:48] God okay let me bring it let me bring it
[1:03:51] a little home to you again you remember
[1:03:55] in the first
[1:03:58] Exodus God was going to bring
[1:04:01] Redemption the prophet said he going to
[1:04:03] bring Redemption by power he going to he
[1:04:06] going to bring Redemption by Blood and
[1:04:09] by power but here was a people dwelling
[1:04:12] so much at peace and do not feel the
[1:04:15] need for a
[1:04:16] redeemer because life was good economy
[1:04:20] was prospering there was no time they
[1:04:22] were crying up onto God then the Bible
[1:04:25] said for this cause I raised
[1:04:30] Pharaoh a pharaoh was raised to not know
[1:04:34] the blessings of Joseph and he started
[1:04:38] afflicting afflicting the people of
[1:04:41] their
[1:04:42] benefactor and that made Israel to start
[1:04:45] crying brother brah said it started from
[1:04:48] the house of amam and jobed and I trust
[1:04:51] to God that we will be proper
[1:04:54] influences somebody had a burden for the
[1:04:57] entire church and he started praying the
[1:05:00] prophet said his wife was saying why
[1:05:02] does it have to be you alone and he said
[1:05:05] but it's got to start with
[1:05:07] somebody I want that kind of
[1:05:10] Revival a a Revival that start with
[1:05:13] somebody a Revival of prayer a Revival
[1:05:17] of holy living a Revival of having
[1:05:19] burden for lost souls committing to
[1:05:22] spiritual things it started from the
[1:05:25] house of hram and brother Braham said it
[1:05:28] began to spread from family to family
[1:05:31] and as it was spreading the power of
[1:05:34] prayer were gathering momentum and
[1:05:36] Defying Gravity and Defying Gravity
[1:05:40] until God said in Exodus chapter 3 or
[1:05:42] chapter 12 that I have had the
[1:05:44] [Applause]
[1:05:47] Cry of my people and I am come
[1:05:52] down he came down to bring Redemption
[1:05:56] because Pharaoh
[1:05:58] upset so Pharaoh was in the purpose for
[1:06:01] God to make the purpose of God
[1:06:04] fulfilled in the life of Exodus
[1:06:07] [Applause]
[1:06:09] people you see when you understand this
[1:06:12] as a Believer you don't even have
[1:06:13] problem with anybody you know why no
[1:06:16] matter what they do amen is just pushing
[1:06:20] you to your
[1:06:22] blessings if you want the virtues of God
[1:06:25] God will bring certain people in your
[1:06:27] life to try you to give you a push to
[1:06:31] give you an Affliction and in the
[1:06:33] process you are developing attitude for
[1:06:35] prayer you are cultivating attitude for
[1:06:38] patience you are becoming more
[1:06:40] temperate Hallelujah they are designed
[1:06:43] for a purpose for God so that the
[1:06:46] purpose of God could be done in your
[1:06:49] life

[1:06:59] it because you must know the side you

[1:07:16] purpose for
[1:07:18] God

[1:07:23] him all right amen so I'm talking to
[1:07:27] those who are in the purpose of God
[1:07:29] tonight let's leave the other guys
[1:07:32] because their life does not give us more
[1:07:35] virtues but the life of the believer
[1:07:37] will provoke us unto good work Holiness
[1:07:42] and
[1:07:43] righteousness now in this
[1:07:47] design God also design your
[1:07:52] abilities this is why all of us will not
[1:07:55] be the
[1:07:57] same but guess what our reward is the
[1:08:01] [Applause]
[1:08:06] same you know why in your unique
[1:08:11] design your job your function your
[1:08:15] purpose is as
[1:08:16] important as the other
[1:08:19] fellow let me take it back to physical
[1:08:22] again so you can
[1:08:24] relate when they designed vehicles for
[1:08:27] horse they had the purpose that we need
[1:08:30] to get something mechanically they can
[1:08:33] move people from one point to the other
[1:08:35] isn't it all right then they began to
[1:08:38] look at it we need to move five
[1:08:42] people with their little luggages we
[1:08:45] don't need more than a four-cylinder
[1:08:53] engine okay if we we want to move
[1:08:56] something more maybe not necessarily H
[1:08:59] more passengers but more load or we want
[1:09:02] it to be a bit balanc and faster six
[1:09:07] cylinder then it came to 8 cylinder for
[1:09:11] those who like to tow their what do you
[1:09:13] call it doing Towing you know the all
[1:09:17] those mobile houses and everything you
[1:09:19] tow it says start from eight cylinders
[1:09:22] then you have the ones that are 24 verbs
[1:09:24] 12
[1:09:26] cylinders and he could even go as far as
[1:09:28] 26 28 30 something
[1:09:32] cylinders each of them is unique in
[1:09:36] their own way and they are brought to
[1:09:39] serve different
[1:09:42] purposes no one is much more important
[1:09:45] than the
[1:09:47] other
[1:09:49] amen the one you get is the one that
[1:09:52] suits your purpose
[1:09:56] are you catching it that is the way it
[1:09:59] is also in the kingdom when you
[1:10:02] understand that there will be no
[1:10:04] competition you will
[1:10:06] realize that that transmission gear is
[1:10:10] as important as the O2 sensor or the O2
[1:10:13] sensor that may sound
[1:10:15] insignificant it can stop your vehicle
[1:10:18] on the road and you will need a
[1:10:20] specialist to move
[1:10:22] it because it's as important as the
[1:10:26] other
[1:10:29] one this is the way it is also in the
[1:10:32] body of
[1:10:34] Christ no one is
[1:10:36] insignificant brother brah said there is
[1:10:38] no useless part in God's body if you are
[1:10:43] not a preacher maybe you our prayer
[1:10:48] [Applause]
[1:10:50] Warrior when King David when David
[1:10:54] received the revelation of this he said
[1:10:56] Lord I'm even pleased to be a door match
[1:11:00] if that is my purpose let everybody step
[1:11:03] on me to come into the house of the Lord
[1:11:06] that's a man who understood the
[1:11:09] revelation of
[1:11:10] [Applause]
[1:11:21] purpose don't forget
[1:11:23] also when made those
[1:11:27] Vehicles they make them to have
[1:11:31] endurance
[1:11:33] capacities because that is why some are
[1:11:36] designed for rough terrains you will
[1:11:39] call them 4
[1:11:41] by4 with propensity to even lift up when
[1:11:45] the terrain gets so bad it's a design
[1:11:48] for its own
[1:11:49] purpose each of us as we're here tonight
[1:11:53] we have gra capacities
[1:11:55] to manage successes of our purpose and
[1:11:59] endurance capacity to manage challenges
[1:12:03] and temptations and trials that come
[1:12:07] with our
[1:12:15] purpose so this is why when certain
[1:12:19] things are happening to you and is not
[1:12:21] happening to the other person tell your
[1:12:24] soul right it's because of my
[1:12:27] purpose hallah did you hear me did you
[1:12:31] hear me liberate your heart tonight let
[1:12:35] the word set you free tonight in the
[1:12:38] body of Christ there's no pity
[1:12:40] party whatever comes your way is because
[1:12:44] of the purpose that you are designed
[1:12:50] for some through the waters some through
[1:12:54] the fire some through the
[1:12:57] flood but all through the
[1:13:00] blood it's all about
[1:13:03] [Applause]
[1:13:13] purpose your
[1:13:15] challenges do not come because it is you
[1:13:18] my brother they come to attack your
[1:13:21] purpose
[1:13:23] [Applause]
[1:13:27] when
[1:13:29] God
[1:13:32] rearranged oh
[1:13:34] man
[1:13:36] okay when he
[1:13:38] arranged the blessings of the first
[1:13:42] born in the matter of
[1:13:45] Reuben I mean know Reuben was the first
[1:13:47] born of
[1:13:48] Israel but because of immoral
[1:13:51] living oh don't be immoral Brothers
[1:13:55] don't be Mar sister there's direct
[1:13:57] warnings from the scripture he said do
[1:14:00] not be a profane person or a
[1:14:03] fornicator like Esau we should still
[1:14:06] preach
[1:14:09] that
[1:14:17] uhhuh
[1:14:19] hujjah we should still preach that
[1:14:23] because in the body of
[1:14:25] Christ don't worry about my throwing
[1:14:28] jacket I'm not going to I'm fighting the
[1:14:35] devil we should still preach that
[1:14:39] because in that body of Christ Holiness
[1:14:42] will not be a
[1:14:44] phrase in their mouth it will be their
[1:14:47] way of life and it is the word that
[1:14:50] purifies it is the word that
[1:14:53] cleanses amen let's keep our vessels
[1:14:57] pure unto the
[1:15:00] Lord he said do not be a profane person
[1:15:04] or a
[1:15:05] fornicator like Esau now Esau did not
[1:15:09] commit fornication but he was very
[1:15:12] profane profanity is taking Divine
[1:15:15] instructions lightly it say it doesn't
[1:15:18] matter and a lot of us are on that lane
[1:15:22] and that is why we turn more to the word
[1:15:25] than to the to the world than to the
[1:15:30] word there's a difference in
[1:15:32] there the hell that makes the difference
[1:15:35] is the
[1:15:36] life the life you live this way tells if
[1:15:39] you are in the world or in in the world
[1:15:43] are you following all right we must take
[1:15:46] Divine instruction strictly we must
[1:15:49] embrace it even if your life is not
[1:15:52] matching on
[1:15:55] meet truth first brother brah said when
[1:15:58] the Lord spoke about that coporation
[1:16:00] woman he said she said true Lord he said
[1:16:04] Faith admit the word is the truth it is
[1:16:08] the admittance of truth that will set
[1:16:11] you free so even if your life is not
[1:16:14] right admit the word is true you are
[1:16:18] wrong you on your road to
[1:16:21] recovery God bless you God bless you God
[1:16:25] bless
[1:16:29] you but Reuben was guilty of
[1:16:33] fornication and when he became guilty of
[1:16:35] that being the first born God took all
[1:16:38] the three blessings away from
[1:16:41] him a firstborn in Israel by the law of
[1:16:44] God had three inheritances the
[1:16:47] birthright the priesthood and the
[1:16:50] rulership is got those three things the
[1:16:53] birthright will make him to be the
[1:16:55] provider and the soer for the entire
[1:16:59] family are you getting it so but Reuben
[1:17:02] lost the three according to the
[1:17:04] scriptures first or 2 Chronicles chapter
[1:17:06] 5 you will find it there if God help us
[1:17:09] along the line we could dwell more that
[1:17:11] now he lost the birthright to Joseph he
[1:17:16] lost the priesthood to Levi and he lost
[1:17:19] the rulership to
[1:17:21] Judah at the end of the day he had
[1:17:24] nothing
[1:17:25] this is why you must sh the wrong and do
[1:17:28] the right some things may not tamper
[1:17:30] with your eternity listen to me church
[1:17:34] but they will cost
[1:17:35] you a great deal in
[1:17:38] [Applause]
[1:17:43] life all
[1:17:45] right so when God announced the
[1:17:48] reassignment of birth
[1:17:51] right that announcement was the reason
[1:17:54] for Joseph seeing the
[1:17:56] dreams that he saw because if you read
[1:18:01] in the blessings of the birth right that
[1:18:03] Isaac placed upon Jacob he said let all
[1:18:08] the your brethren your de the the
[1:18:11] children of your parents bow down to
[1:18:13] thee be thou their soer be th their
[1:18:17] provider that was what God was simply
[1:18:19] announcing and that thing alone the
[1:18:22] purpose that Joseph will serve exposed
[1:18:25] him to
[1:18:27] Danger all the problems that Joseph went
[1:18:30] through in life was because of that
[1:18:33] purpose all the challenges that you will
[1:18:36] go through is because of your purpose
[1:18:40] that is why yours may be peculiar from
[1:18:42] mine but I want to give you this Comfort
[1:18:45] all of us are under the blood as long as
[1:18:49] remain under the blood we are covered
[1:18:54] how come how come it was when Moses was
[1:18:58] born that Pharaoh suddenly said go and
[1:19:01] kill all the male
[1:19:03] children he had an idea that his Nemesis
[1:19:07] has been born but he's not a good
[1:19:11] sniper Satan is too dull for my
[1:19:14] liking if he was a good sniper you know
[1:19:17] what he should have narrowed it to the
[1:19:19] person but he killed several children in
[1:19:23] the hope of getting Moses and he never
[1:19:25] called
[1:19:27] Moses but why was that challenge coming
[1:19:30] simply because of his
[1:19:34] purpose I'm saying it again the reason
[1:19:37] you go through things you go through is
[1:19:40] because of your purpose but I have a
[1:19:42] good news for you the one who created
[1:19:45] you for that purpose has also put it in
[1:19:49] you the endurance capacity the rugged
[1:19:54] capacity
[1:19:55] the great
[1:19:56] [Applause]
[1:20:03] capacity you see you see the
[1:20:05] faithfulness of the scripture when Paul
[1:20:08] was talking to the church he said
[1:20:10] there's no temptation that comes unto
[1:20:11] you that is uncommon he said but God is
[1:20:15] faithful how many say God is faithful
[1:20:17] tonight how many say God is faithful God
[1:20:21] is God is faithful who will not allow
[1:20:26] you to be tempted above what you are
[1:20:29] able to
[1:20:30] [Applause]
[1:20:32] Bear did you catch something there you
[1:20:35] already
[1:20:36] won before the Temptation came because
[1:20:40] God allowed it because he knows you can
[1:20:43] handle it when he created you he knew
[1:20:46] what he put in you the enduring capacity
[1:20:50] the grace for it God will not design you
[1:20:53] for a purpose without God giving you the
[1:20:55] ability to handle the
[1:21:02] purpose is that the Scripture it will
[1:21:05] not allow you to be
[1:21:07] tempted above what you can bear that is
[1:21:10] why Christians will laugh in the face of
[1:21:13] their adversary they will laugh in the
[1:21:16] face of their Temptation they are bold
[1:21:19] to say Satan bring it on if God I permit
[1:21:23] you it's because it's in me and he that
[1:21:27] is in you is greater than he is greater
[1:21:30] than that sin is greater than that
[1:21:33] besetting sin is greater than that trial
[1:21:36] is greater than that
[1:21:40] trouble I'm just trying to make you see
[1:21:42] your
[1:21:44] [Applause]
[1:21:48] inheritance don't you see how positive
[1:21:51] Mo Joseph was throughout his trouble
[1:21:55] nothing could break him they they threw
[1:21:58] him in the dungeon when they F him out
[1:22:01] it was still the vibrant Joseph that was
[1:22:04] why wherever he went the Seal of God the
[1:22:08] beauty of God the Excellency of God was
[1:22:11] going with him if he has become a pity
[1:22:14] party a degenerate he will not be
[1:22:17] attractive for potifa no his wife
[1:22:30] but he looked at his problem in the face
[1:22:33] I said Lord I may not know why I may not
[1:22:36] know how but I know one thing all things
[1:22:40] work
[1:22:41] together this is why Paul said and we
[1:22:44] know it's a revelation it's a knowing
[1:22:48] that all things must work together for
[1:22:51] your good
[1:22:58] look let me tell you
[1:22:59] friends when you when you show a
[1:23:02] positive attitude to God he will reveal
[1:23:05] your purpose and he will give you
[1:23:08] strength he will give you Grace look
[1:23:12] when the Brethren of Joseph
[1:23:14] came come
[1:23:17] on God with tell their
[1:23:20] eyes but God opened the eyes of Joseph
[1:23:24] he could recognize them is that right
[1:23:27] and the word of the Lord began to
[1:23:29] fulfill they began to Bow as God said he
[1:23:32] will amen now you will say maybe it was
[1:23:37] because they didn't know him that was
[1:23:39] why they did that amen but after their
[1:23:42] father
[1:23:43] died and they buried their father and
[1:23:47] they came back they formed an
[1:23:49] association of guilty
[1:23:53] brothers who found it out to accept
[1:23:56] their forgiveness it's in your Bible
[1:23:59] they said now that the common
[1:24:00] denominator the common thing between us
[1:24:04] and Joseph is dead he will not visit us
[1:24:07] over our over what we did and they
[1:24:10] formed an association of guilty Brothers
[1:24:13] walking softly and humbly and knowing
[1:24:16] Joseph was Joseph they still
[1:24:20] bow because do here the Lord can never f
[1:24:25] the purpose of God can never be
[1:24:29] defeated there are many devices in the
[1:24:32] heart of man but the counsel of God it
[1:24:35] shall
[1:24:42] stand and here is a beautiful one you
[1:24:45] know what Joseph told them Joseph told
[1:24:48] them he said Brethren you are taking
[1:24:49] this thing too
[1:24:51] far you are taking it too far I have
[1:24:54] long forgotten about this matter how
[1:24:57] long will you hold yourself in guilt God
[1:25:01] has long forgotten you forgiven you stop
[1:25:04] holding yourself in guilt those of you
[1:25:07] who are waiting for Audible Voice you
[1:25:10] will be difficult to accept your
[1:25:12] forgiveness you know why because what
[1:25:14] God wanted to do for you he has already
[1:25:17] done brother Braham said if he came here
[1:25:21] tonight and you will walk up to him and
[1:25:24] say Lord Heal Me or Lord forgive me he
[1:25:27] will not mind you and if he Minds you at
[1:25:30] all he will say what you want me to do I
[1:25:33] have already
[1:25:35] done what you need to do is to
[1:25:39] accept accept tonight
[1:25:45] accept Hallelujah accept your
[1:25:48] forgiveness accept your pardon so you
[1:25:51] can serve your purpose let me tell you
[1:25:56] if God designed you for anything that
[1:25:59] thing is
[1:26:01] undefeatable your ignorance your
[1:26:04] ignorance May afflict
[1:26:06] you your target missing may suffer you
[1:26:10] but you will still do
[1:26:13] it Hallelujah Joseph told his Brethren I
[1:26:18] understand what was happening you
[1:26:20] thought you persecuted me but guess what
[1:26:23] all that you did
[1:26:24] come on was the way of God sending
[1:26:29] me it was the Lord sending me to come
[1:26:32] and preserve your lives and those of
[1:26:35] your family once you have that
[1:26:38] Revelation you will have no problem with
[1:26:41] any man it will be easy to forgive and
[1:26:45] difficult to be
[1:26:51] bitter can we begin to look at the
[1:26:53] benefits
[1:26:55] in our
[1:26:56] adversaries can we begin to look at it
[1:27:00] because God may allow somebody to do
[1:27:01] something to you just to watch how you
[1:27:04] are going to react and your reaction
[1:27:06] will tell the father is growing or he
[1:27:09] hasn't learned his lesson don't stunt
[1:27:12] your growth because there are grounds to
[1:27:15] possess
[1:27:24] so we'll have

[1:32:57] there in the court of God there is no
[1:33:01] appeal find Grace to hand it in don't
[1:33:04] struggle with God he will do what he has
[1:33:07] to do it's a
[1:33:19] promise are you worried about your life
[1:33:22] let me tell you
[1:33:24] it is your purpose that purifies
[1:33:30] you did you hear me I mean every word of
[1:33:34] that God brought you here to serve a
[1:33:38] purpose what did Jesus spoke about the
[1:33:40] tree he said let us PCH the tree that he
[1:33:43] may bear more fruit is that
[1:33:46] scripture because the purpose of the
[1:33:48] tree is to bear fruit for whatever
[1:33:52] purpose God has for you he is ready to
[1:33:55] clean you he's ready to keep you holy
[1:33:59] and in the
[1:34:01] shape to serve that purpose if you dress
[1:34:05] right your dressing right is not what
[1:34:08] makes you holy it is the purpose that
[1:34:10] dressing right is
[1:34:12] serving to show to the people of the
[1:34:14] world that there's a generation that
[1:34:17] will not defile themselves that will not
[1:34:20] be vulgar your life preaches to your
[1:34:23] environment
[1:34:24] and the prophet said through your
[1:34:26] testimony your environment will be
[1:34:28] brought to
[1:34:29] judgment the Judgment of God is your own
[1:34:32] word against the
[1:34:36] [Applause]
[1:34:37] [Music]
[1:34:40] unbeliever oh God have you and
[1:34:43] I God help you and I amen
[1:34:47] GL now God was taking
[1:34:51] Moses all the crocodile in
[1:34:55] River went
[1:34:58] asleep they went into
[1:35:00] coma even
[1:35:02] Miriam a young lady perhaps
[1:35:06] barefooted in the water they a crocodile
[1:35:10] should have smell a passive her and say
[1:35:13] Here Comes our food free of charge but
[1:35:17] let me tell you tonight both of them are
[1:35:20] not crocodiles meat
[1:35:28] they are a carrier of
[1:35:30] purpose and they must accomplish
[1:35:33] it otherwise no
[1:35:36] way and guess what we we get we God let
[1:35:42] Hallelujah this God is too how do we
[1:35:45] describe him now he L the creep straight
[1:35:49] to the enemy's camp
[1:35:53] and he made sure he made sure it was the
[1:35:57] daughter of the
[1:35:58] enemy that discovered the crib and God
[1:36:01] went further he did not hide the
[1:36:04] identity of that boy he revealed to that
[1:36:07] woman he said this is an Hebrew
[1:36:12] child an Hebrew child so how come she
[1:36:15] did not strangle her how come she did
[1:36:18] not suffocate her how come she did not
[1:36:21] order her to be cut into pieces because
[1:36:24] that is a child that is an enemy of the
[1:36:27] Kingdom but because of purpose that can
[1:36:32] never be
[1:36:37] defeated instead instead of killing the
[1:36:40] boy the Lord sent a spirit of love he
[1:36:43] said this one won't die he's my own
[1:36:53] [Music]
[1:36:56] let the beauty of Jesus be seen in me
[1:36:59] his wonderful passion and Purity oh thou
[1:37:02] Spirit divine all my nature
[1:37:08] refine your purpose will preserve you
[1:37:13] nothing can take you until what God
[1:37:16] brought you here for is
[1:37:19] accomplished I'll have le you I have m
[1:37:24] you are precious in the sight of the
[1:37:27] Lord and like I said God is not going to
[1:37:30] replace you you say prove that did he
[1:37:33] replace Moses
[1:37:37] No Moses started it and he started it
[1:37:41] wrong is that the scripture because what
[1:37:45] Moses wanted to do will have broken the
[1:37:48] word of God I call your attention to
[1:37:50] this in Genesis chapter 15
[1:37:54] when God was conventing entering into
[1:37:56] convenant with Abraham he told him your
[1:37:59] children will sojourn in a land that is
[1:38:03] not theirs for 400 years did he say so
[1:38:08] then he said after words in other words
[1:38:11] 400 years must be
[1:38:13] complete then maybe
[1:38:15] 41 402 or 400 years and 6 months or even
[1:38:20] 500 years that is afterwards
[1:38:23] I must clear that because some people
[1:38:26] are preaching that there's a possibility
[1:38:28] for do the Lord to fail to me that is
[1:38:33] [Music]
[1:38:35] Blasphemous they said because God said
[1:38:38] he will deliver them 400 years but they
[1:38:41] spend
[1:38:43] [Music]
[1:38:44] 430 God didn't say we deliver them on
[1:38:47] 400 years he said they will soj for okay
[1:38:50] God bless you is it this and he said
[1:38:53] unto them uhhuh and they shall afflict
[1:38:56] them how many years did he say so all
[1:38:59] right bring it up again give us the next
[1:39:03] let's continue and also that Nation whom
[1:39:06] they Shall Serve will I judge and
[1:39:10] what
[1:39:12] and shall they come out with great
[1:39:16] substance so 400 years will be fully
[1:39:19] right anything can now happen after 400
[1:39:23] 100
[1:39:25] years is that the
[1:39:27] scripture but now when Moses
[1:39:30] failed is that right and it went away
[1:39:35] for how many years0 40 years if you take
[1:39:38] 40 years out of 430 what will you have
[1:39:42] 390 so Moses wanted to deliver Israel
[1:39:46] before the appointed Covenant time
[1:39:53] God watches over his word to perform it
[1:39:57] that will have broken the
[1:39:59] scriptures that will have broken the
[1:40:01] Covenant and that was why God said Cal
[1:40:05] down you see you can never love the
[1:40:08] people of God more than God loves
[1:40:12] them to Moses to Moses God was too
[1:40:16] insensitive how could he be seeing
[1:40:18] what's going on and and not do anything
[1:40:21] about it he will do it he will do do it
[1:40:24] he's watching his word everything must
[1:40:26] come in order hallelujah amen so when
[1:40:32] Moses left for 400 years for 40 years
[1:40:36] the matter
[1:40:38] passed God could have found
[1:40:43] somebody he never found
[1:40:45] nobody amen who was taking care of
[1:40:48] Israel in those length of time the same
[1:40:51] God
[1:40:53] because in God's touch the plan he
[1:40:55] designed for it was Moses and he must
[1:40:59] come back to do that job you will do
[1:41:03] your
[1:41:03] job I don't care how long some of you
[1:41:06] stray out let me tell you young people
[1:41:10] your destiny lays in this
[1:41:13] [Music]
[1:41:16] message did you hear me your destiny
[1:41:20] your success Your Glory
[1:41:24] your fulfillment lays in this message
[1:41:27] you were not brought into heat either by
[1:41:30] bet or by strin inside for nothing I
[1:41:34] don't care how many years you wonder
[1:41:36] when the Lord is ready he will bring you
[1:41:40] back and perhaps it's ready for some of
[1:41:43] you tonight come home son come home
[1:41:49] daughter because you are only wasting
[1:41:51] time you are only afflicting yourself
[1:41:55] amen the purpose of God for your life
[1:41:59] can never be
[1:42:02] [Music]
[1:42:02] [Applause]
[1:42:04] [Music]
[1:42:09] [Applause]
[1:42:12] [Music]
[1:42:15] defeated I think we've got to some
[1:42:17] climax let me be winding
[1:42:19] down GL Glory Glory Glory don't tempt me
[1:42:22] brother
[1:42:27] I can preach till the next
[1:42:29] morning this is the only thing I do in
[1:42:31] my life and I enjoy it so
[1:42:41] much you love
[1:42:46] him
[1:42:48] sometimes sometimes listen to this God
[1:42:52] finds on you usual
[1:42:54] part God use unusual method I'm going to
[1:42:58] startle you
[1:43:00] now to bring his purpose to
[1:43:07] pass when God was sending
[1:43:11] Jonah to
[1:43:15] ninev the purpose of God in God's
[1:43:20] mind was for Nev to be saved right right
[1:43:25] right he only wanted Jonah to go and
[1:43:28] give them a message of
[1:43:30] shaking to bring them to
[1:43:33] awareness look at the body language
[1:43:36] tongue language of God he wasn't
[1:43:39] interested in the destruction of
[1:43:44] ninev but he was using dealing with a
[1:43:48] servant who had problem with that
[1:43:55] you say how do you know read your Bible
[1:43:57] Jonah said
[1:44:00] so Jonah was a man of God who wanted to
[1:44:04] preach Hellfire Brimstone and judgment
[1:44:07] and see it happen right
[1:44:09] there to him it should be the
[1:44:14] Vindication God said okay that's fine
[1:44:18] that's
[1:44:19] fine so that was why when God when he
[1:44:26] repented Jonah was not happy is it not
[1:44:30] in your Bible he said I know this is
[1:44:32] what was going to
[1:44:38] happen oh God help us Servants of God
[1:44:41] now we must preach with the love of God
[1:44:44] in our
[1:44:47] heart you know brother Braham said it
[1:44:50] can be
[1:44:51] frustrating when you preach and do all
[1:44:54] you can and people are not
[1:44:57] changing it's a quotation it said it can
[1:45:00] be
[1:45:01] frustrating but you see God has called
[1:45:04] you into the ministry because he knows
[1:45:07] you have the capacity to deal with the
[1:45:12] frustration open yourself open yourself
[1:45:14] to Grace and everything will be all
[1:45:16] right these were the frustrations that
[1:45:18] made the prophet to call some of those
[1:45:21] children rickes and Rickers shut up and
[1:45:24] God had to come and say ah please I beg
[1:45:26] of you they are my children don't call
[1:45:28] them Ricky and Rick find a better
[1:45:31] language brother said I was getting into
[1:45:35] complex you see if the great prophet of
[1:45:39] God would experience that I need to ask
[1:45:42] for Grace every
[1:45:43] [Applause]
[1:45:44] [Music]
[1:45:46] day
[1:45:48] anyway
[1:45:50] anyway God's purpose Hallelujah cannot
[1:45:53] be defeated and cannot change so here is
[1:45:57] God sending
[1:45:59] Jonah but as a gods to the B
[1:46:08] off now you will say Jonah
[1:46:14] disobeyed or went out of the will of
[1:46:17] God it is you saying like that there's
[1:46:20] no quotation from that no the message as
[1:46:24] a matter of fact the prophet presented
[1:46:26] it very rudely to us he said it was
[1:46:28] never out of the will of
[1:46:30] [Applause]
[1:46:31] God and I kept following that statement
[1:46:34] until I saw where the Prophet said it
[1:46:36] was God that told him to enter the ship
[1:46:38] to
[1:46:39] [Applause]
[1:46:46] tou yeah I will show you if you want he
[1:46:51] told him to enter the ship
[1:46:55] [Music]
[1:46:58] so Jonah felt pleased he was in the ship
[1:47:00] to Tes but do you know what God wanted
[1:47:02] to do because he was
[1:47:04] determined to save the people of nin
[1:47:07] brother Brown made a powerful statement
[1:47:09] he says sometimes you do
[1:47:11] things and you are wondering why did I
[1:47:14] do such a thing you even think maybe is
[1:47:16] wrong and yet it is God
[1:47:19] working come on
[1:47:23] now the way God knew Nev will get the
[1:47:27] message to bring
[1:47:28] repentance is the way God was
[1:47:31] fashioning if Jonah entered the ship to
[1:47:35] Nev direct and he got there the wish of
[1:47:39] Jonah will come to pass because Nev will
[1:47:42] never accept the
[1:47:51] gospel so God said go to Tes and the man
[1:47:55] was
[1:47:56] pleased enjoying rejoicing in himself
[1:48:00] that
[1:48:02] last what nonsense I won't go waste my
[1:48:06] time but as they go the Lord who told
[1:48:09] him to enter the ship to
[1:48:12] tou allow the wind and storm to be
[1:48:15] released because the real transport that
[1:48:18] will make the job effective
[1:48:35] so when the storm was going
[1:48:38] on everybody was doing all they can the
[1:48:41] Man For Whom the storm was happening was
[1:48:43] as cool as
[1:48:45] cucumber he was even
[1:48:48] sleeping until they say who is this
[1:48:51] unusual passenger
[1:48:54] you mean this storm is not your own
[1:48:56] headache say it's not my
[1:48:58] headache being prophet in knew what was
[1:49:01] happening and he gave them solution they
[1:49:04] felt more spiritual than the solution he
[1:49:07] said if you want this storm to come
[1:49:09] throw me into the water they say God
[1:49:11] forbid you better do what the prophet
[1:49:15] says to be spiritual is to be scriptural
[1:49:20] [Music]
[1:49:23] and they kept suffering until they said
[1:49:26] Lord it is the man who said we should
[1:49:28] put him there don't require his Blow
[1:49:31] from our hand and when they throw him
[1:49:34] the prepared
[1:49:35] vehicle to take him to where God wants
[1:49:39] to make the ministry effective just
[1:49:42] [Applause]
[1:49:46] came if you think the mouth of a whale
[1:49:48] is too small it's a special wh amen
[1:49:53] if you think it's a sharkk it's a
[1:49:55] special one whichever way you call it
[1:49:58] all I know is that God sent a
[1:50:01] fish and he swallowed Jonah when he
[1:50:05] swallowed Jonah God was working on him
[1:50:09] for three days and three
[1:50:13] nights mellowing him with the me with
[1:50:17] the grace the
[1:50:19] compartment to handle the sermon with a
[1:50:21] passion
[1:50:23] now in the land of
[1:50:25] Nev what they worship is fish
[1:50:28] God the prophet does the
[1:50:32] story are you with me what they worship
[1:50:35] is fish God so as they saw a big God of
[1:50:39] theirs
[1:50:40] approaching majority of them gathered to
[1:50:43] hear what the God will
[1:50:46] say and when the god came small small
[1:50:50] god brother brah said he opened his
[1:50:53] mouth and released his
[1:50:55] tongue for a breach and Jonah walked
[1:50:59] out and started preaching
[1:51:03] repent
[1:51:05] repent hey it's a Cas the God had spoken
[1:51:10] God had spoken God has spoken and
[1:51:13] everything and everybody repented
[1:51:17] Hallelujah was the purpose of God not
[1:51:20] accomplished he was in unusual way in
[1:51:24] mysterious ways is wonders to
[1:51:28] perform that explains sometimes the
[1:51:31] unusual things in your life that brings
[1:51:33] you to a point you said I did not know
[1:51:36] how I got here it is God working all the
[1:51:41] [Applause]
[1:51:46] time anything that serve the
[1:51:49] purpose Glory will have a resurrection
[1:51:53] amen I say this as I
[1:51:56] close whether you serve the purpose of
[1:51:59] God or a purpose for God you will be
[1:52:07] resurrected
[1:52:10] amen it's scripture
[1:52:12] now the good and the bad will also be
[1:52:15] resurrected but the question is in what
[1:52:20] Resurrection uhhuh
[1:52:23] because the Bible in Hebrews 11 told me
[1:52:27] that those who serve the purpose of God
[1:52:30] those who repented tasted Redemption and
[1:52:34] God through their life expressed himself
