All We Are So Unworthy of this great grace and love that you have towards us could have turned your back you could have started all over again but you choose to redeem a people and bring a people back into Saving Grace saving knowledge back to inheritance Back to Eden help us this evening this today as we get into your word may your presence be with us in a special way in Jesus name I ask it amen God bless you and thanks for coming out if you have your Bibles I turn to Genesis chter 12 you want to read verse 1-5 Genesis chapter 50 going to read vers 20- 26 Joel chapter 2 verse 28 to 29 thank you musicians thank you brother Anthony thank you for the atmosphere we feel in the church this morning reading Genesis chapter 12 God speaks the word we read now the Lord had said unto Abraham get thee out of thy country and from thy Kindred and from thy father's house and to a land that I will show thee and I will make of thee a great nation I Will Bless thee and make thy name Great Thou shalt be a blessing I will bless them that bless thee curse them that cursed thee and inde the shall all the families of the earth be blessed so Abraham was 75 years old when he departed out of Heron and Abraham took Sarai his wife and lot his brother's son and all their substance and they had gathered and the souls that they had gotten in Haron and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan and into the land of Canaan they came Genesis 50 reading from verse 20 this is Joseph speaking to his brothers after he revealed himself to them but as for you he taught evil against me but God meant it unto good to bring to pass as it is this day to save much people alive now therefore fear ye not I will nourish you and your little ones and he comforted them and spake kindly unto them and Joseph dwelt in Egypt he and his father's house and Joseph live 110 years and Joseph saw ephraim's Children of the third generation the children also of Mair the son of manace were brought up upon Joseph knees and Joseph said unto his Brethren I die and God will surely visit you and bring you out of this land into the land which he swear to Abraham to Isaac and to Jacob and Joseph took an oat of the children of Israel saying surely God will visit you he shall carry up my bones from hence so Joseph died being 110 years old and they embalm him and he was put in a coffin in Egypt I reading from Joel 2:28 and 29 it shall come to pass afterwards that I will Port my spirit upon All Flesh your sons and your daughters shall prophesy your old men shall dream dreams your young men shall see Visions also upon them servants and upon my handmaids in those days will I pour out my spirit may God bless his word you may be seated blessed be the name of the lord it's a blessing to be here this morning amen so let's go our title this morning the return to the land of promise that's a title The Return to the land of promise I want you to notice what God gave Abraham a promise to get to King that was always the land so when Joseph and they found themselves in Egypt Joseph told them God going to bring him back to that land because that is what God promised so God will not change his mind about the original land of promise that he promises people there is no way God going to change his mind about that promise that God promised you brother Bram I've been Anointed with this spirit for the last two or three hours and I know he wants me to say this and dear Christians as long as you do that and ministers you're are going to stay in the kindergarten where you are right now you will never know no more than fuss and fight with one another that's all until you get big enough to walk out there and shake hands with your brother and have Fellowship God will bring you up and restore all Theus back to the church and take the church home so it's only Lucifer himself breaks Fellowship is only Lucifer himself Cuts people off only Lucifer himself behind that because God knows something out to break until you get big enough to get out of the traditional denominational barrier politics you talk about our nation just look at the disunity of a nation is doing it's more than a Grace to Jesus Christ the church in the disunity it is just before the coming of the Lord and the loosening of the Antichrist on the earth and here we are separated with nomal barriers I'm a Methodist praise God you couldn't shake me I'm a Baptist I'm Assembly of God I'm a Church of God I'm United Pentecostal we can fit that to any message group what are any of you anyhow what of any of us nothing but what God would let us be and it's all in the grace of God let's look to him and praise him and associate with our brother oh give the Lord a praise Hallelujah so all these are are keys to unlock the pathway that you have of life you have to cross the road you see somebody cross the what see all right but BR we read this over and over but I'm reading again tonight and I hope that it strike you a little different this morning watch this the this AE started just at the turn of the 20th century it was to be the age in which the true church would return to being the bright she was at Pentecost in other words Pentecost was the original God can't change that every church have to how do I say it line up to that then go back to that then but Bram came to turn our hearts back to that then yes that's the commission turn our hearts back to the faith of the fathers because the faith of the fathers is the original Faith they didn't live long enough to go in the Rapture but it was still the original faith that was delivered to the saints that Faith was Jesus Christ and that faith is what promised to be in you and I oh praise the name of how many understand that now so it was to be return to being the bride she was at Pentecost we know that there must have necessity be a return of Dynamic power if that was so much then how much more now it must have necessity return to Dynamic power because we coming down to a time you know we coming down to an intersection you know with technology with the car without stearing wheel with the woman coming forward in America with Russia preparing the bums Russia already told NATO and USA if they allow those missiles to strike us we are coming for you and the Russ and and and and and and and Israel still fighting up with Hamas and the whole drama down in the Middle East it hasn't stopped you know it's just a Kindle of a fire because they're waiting for us to get into our position before this drama start to move on drama coming you know so if you're sleeping you're going to wake up one of these days because it coming to a theater near you oh give the Lord sh shout in the house Hallelujah and that this going be no movie you know that's going to be the real deal the real thing it will take glory and presence and power and Grace and blood to preserve our people during a time like this oh give the Lord I shout in the house glory to God hallelujah glory to God one day you go hear this is not a drill you need a fire drill and and to go which part you stand up and in case of a fire that's a drill but then you're going to hear this another a drill this is really happening oh give the Lord some praise es remember 911 when those plan hit that Tower and for days people just gazing can't believe this happening America can't believe it's happening it happened it happened and more things are going to happen but God S A prophit before the terrority of the Lord so you sit here like if your head have air in it all a go leave here people get sober I expect people to run into church Cry Oh Lord Oh Lord Oh Lord Oh Lord you better Lord now oh give the Lord some Praises a rocking shaking time but we have a promise to return to the land of promise we have a promise that God will take us back we have a promise that shall come to pass afterwards say I will P my spirit and the spirit of God has never been defeated the spirit of God can meet that challenge of the devil anywhere any time any place under any condition oh give the Lord a praise in the house glory to God more powerful than any atomic bomb Oh Glory to God no more powerful than all them drones they flying all up and down Hallelujah glory to God glory to God how War have changed now send up a drone I was thinking about it you know I think I'll take I get a drone in church a small one and fly over people head let Buzz over you and to understand the Holy Ghost does fly like a drone but over you and brother I see that woman down here she have cancer I see that person across here praise God I see that one Divine as all who have Act Right This spirit all who have deaf all who dumb praise praise God [Applause] [Music] hallelujah this Holy Ghost is a real thing you know man taking science and trying to impersonate God and everything else you know because them fellas and them in some screen like there a video game shooting people and killing people you know they not you know the battlefield could be how much miles away and they controlling and seen this man I've seen this on the internet dropping bums one man he didn't catch a drone and S out the hand he blow him up so close this is real people are dying every day you know people are being wounded every day you know you come to church normal normal coming late sometimes you know come any house sometimes and what normal normal normal but people are fighting for their lives both in the Middle East and in Ukraine and Russia Ordinary People not involved in the Demonic activity of principalities and Powers but caught up in it they have no intercession for the world or for any country the world itself is finished America is already sentenced they waiting for the senten in rather and God not cancel because a prophet saw it he saw America blow up and bummed up and what he saw it they will pay for their sins sin had to be paid for you know that why Jesus died you know because was a cost to him you it wasn't free you know you go free but he paid for it I give me a shout on that one sin cost Jesus his life that is why he will judge with Fierce anger because he pay the price that any man whosoever will can go free you could go free today you don't have to continue the way you're living you could break out you could bus out I don't care what prison you in you could break out of that and bust out and be free this [Applause] morning Hallelujah the gospel come to change lives not for you to remain as you are that is Reformation but the gospel come to for transformation and that transformation comes from the inside out oh give the Lord some Praises glory to God the Believers sense in their spirits and begin crying to God for a new outpouring such as was in the first century what seemed to be an answer came as many begin to speak in tongues and manifest gifts of the Spirit it was then believed that this was indeed a long awaited restoration it was not for the latter rain this is our prophecy now the latter rain can only come after the former rain which is the spring or teaching rain the latter rain then is the Harvest rain so when the Harvest rain come you can't change who you are when the latter rain come the seed is the seed and the rain falls to manifest whatever your seed is so the most important thing for you to get is the seed the secret is the word is in the brain or your flesh may act up your human Spirit May whatever but the secret is the word is in the brain God know the word have to come inside of you we have to hammer it inside of you sometime it's a big F hammer and bang slam it inside of you because the word is God hallelujah hallelujah Abram AB wasn't a saga man and Saga boy and a special man and a rich man he was ordinary man but God called him come out of your country and I will give you a land Oh Glory to God I will take you to a land that's the land I want you to be in that's the promised land it's promised because you get it yet it's promised because it's coming it's promised because God said so God give you promises for you to press okay the Lord I shout in the house you have to press glory to God when God gave Abraham the promise of Isaac he had to press his way 25 years he believed in This Promise of God and the Bible said he's tager under the promise of God through unbelief but was strong in why are you staggering this morning he's staging under the promise of God through unbelief but was strong in faith giving glory to God why are you shaken this morning he stagger at the promise of God through unbelief but was strong in faith given glory to God and he was fully persuaded that's the problem right there are you fully persuaded that what he promised I look how your husband is acting up what he promised God is able to perform oh give the Lord a shout in the house what he [Applause] promised let's go how could this be the real thing when the teaching Reign has not come so teaching comes by a rain call it the teaching rain and ministers Revel in that yes all the mighty teachers all around the world teaching teaching teaching teaching teaching but the teaching rain is to forun the Harvest rain or the l r do you get that all the great teachers in this message for the last 50 60 years was to forun what was coming as the Harvest rain if they saw the wrong seed rainf falling on that whatever seed they s that rain falling than that if they say worship me seed the rain falling on that get the worship and the glory and the man and what not and the pope hat but but that is the ring going to fall on that if they show the statue of a perfect man seen rain falling and that if they s Perfection seed rain falling on that if they saw seven Thunder seed rain falling on that if they saw super Church super race headstone power coming into the church rain falling on that oh glory to God hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah understand this rain is not going to fall and manifest anything on what they Pastor create and think for yourself because the spoken word that came out the mouth of the Prophet is the Original Seed not my words not some man words not some man revealing the word sit down and shut up will you the Holy Ghost alone is the revealer of the revelation of Jesus Christ not some man in trinida some man some special man sit down and shut up they need to shut up a little bit and God will shut them out of the critics when that Dynamic power begin to strike the church of living God the whole world will know it God is doing this in a little corner it going be no under no no no covering under no tent somewhere under covering somewhere God going to lift his Veil off that bride and said this is my beloved Son this is my daughter here this is another son here look another one here oh glory to God and just as Satan went in God's Eden and he stand up like a big man and let Eve fall and let Adam fall God will let them Sons come back in this last day and they're going to stand up like a big man and stand up like a big man and stand up like a statue of a perfect man and overcome the devil overcome the world overcome the things of the world overcome the cares of Life overcome pornography

Lutheran age did not restore the church started the Reformation the W age did not restore the P the Pentecostal age did not restore but God has to restore for he cannot deny his word this is not the resurrection of the church it is the restoration and I am so convinced of this what I'm about to read right now God will take the church right back to Pentecost of the beginning I will consider every minister to be a liar if they deny that I don't want nothing less than that he said we have to go back to Pentecost as in the beginning what is he saying we have to go back to the land land the promised land no matter how high you stray you have to get back to that land Oh Glory to God Joseph knew he was going to die and Joseph said I die but God will surely visit you when you're leaving

here now we just get press out press press down and press out go and a bunch of Rascals go and adoption upon men that do have character it do make no sense I I can give them power and I'm human you

years old his wife of 30 years and he with some woman 30 something years and he used to be conducting prayer meeting on the house every week and he want divorce now and she said well you know she want reconciliation she prayer and everything like that and he said she said people people don't she said women some of them wives don't even know the attack that the husband being attacked out there just the devil and you have to fight but let's go all right God isn't going to plant a new church but he's going to bring his original planting back to Original Seed brother brandom God never blesses Israel till she gets to her Homeland God will never bless you Methodist Baptist Presbyterian Catholic prolist nazarine Church of Christ oral organization he will never bless you that way come back to the Homeland to the beginning back here we go to the Pentecostal experience like that happened on the day of Pentecost when the power of the Living God changed those thousands of people and set their heart of flame with the fire of God that showed genuine signs not impersonated signs he warns us back to the truth amen back to the spirit yes sir back to the life he said the right life amen back to the highway in Christ oh praise God hallelujah praise God so Canan this promised land is where Joseph's story began where we know the story and I just want to get back to so I want to just slide in here now talk a little bit about this young man called Joseph now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children because he was the son of his old age and he made him a coat of many colors yes sir so Joseph listen was favored by the father it represented favor this coat of many colors and this favor caused jealousy among his brothers favor glows favor shows God's favor it is evident when God's favor is upon someone he called David a man after my own heart God is Sovereign and he has a right to favor he has a right to say Jacob I love Esau I hate and they do nothing yet because God is Sovereign Hallelujah God love shows Joseph was 17 years old when he received a quat from his father this is the Bible Genesis 37:2 these are the generations of Jacob Joseph being 17 years old was feeding the fluck with his Brethren and the lad was with the sons of Bah and with the sons of zilpa his father's wife and Joseph brought themto his father their evil report Joseph was 30 years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt this is Genesis 41:46 and Joseph was 30 years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt and Joseph went out from the presence of pharaoh and went throughout all the land of Egypt so from 17 to 30 is just 13 years 13 years and God have a plan God knew that there going to be seven years of plenty amen and seven years of famine and God knew he had to get a man on the inside let's call Joseph the Inside Man the only man God could get on the inside how does God choose to get this man on the inside to save the world Hallelujah by having this man to be blessed to be favored Hallelujah to have a rainbow coat and his brothers to hait him that hatred by jealousy caused his brother to sell him out Joseph in pain Joseph under stress but God the big picture seeing a man about to come into position true suffering you amen that one true suffering that he be positionally placed to save the world not just his family but the world oh give the Lord some Praises Hallelujah this had to be a special man this had to be a different man this is a young man who kept the Fate 17 years old no song leader no Brethren no Elder no Pastor he's speaking he had to learn their language and he had 13 years to get into position This Man Called Joseph what a man what a young man he's not moving with friends he's not Ling with friends he's not moving with this one and that one he's not smoking because that one is smoking he's not drinking because that one is drinking no he is standing he's keeping in the faith because he know his father Jacob he know his grandfather was Abraham oh give the Lord a shout his great-grandfather was Abraham his grandfather was Isaac and he knew the god of Jacob the god of Isaac the god of Abraham he is not dead he give him the vision and God has given you a vision you can't give yourself a vision oh give it the Lord some Praises this [Applause] [Music] [Applause] morning may be SE so we could learn from Joseph's story think about it young people Joseph kept the Fate despite the Betrayal of his Brethren despite being in a slave slavery despite being falsely imprisoned notice his false imprisonment didn't make him not be cancel his Christian card and you no longer sering the Lord because I prison if God was was with me I never going to be in prison how come I going through all this thing and I Church your wimp you spineless you have no spine this false imprisonment was absolutely necessary because God had to arrange an intersection where Joseph could connect to [Applause] Pharaoh Joseph Integrity is what get him into prison he could have given to potis a wife but he's a woman no and he ran for his life his Integrity is what kept him it's what preserved him is what got him into prison in the first place but there God wanted him because he have two men he wanted Joseph to meet I am telling you wherever you go Oh Glory to God God will make a way for you God will still bless you I don't care how much betray you how much lie on you how much despise you how much hate you and the jealous of you God himself will make a way for you give the Lord some Praises this [Applause] [Music] [Applause] morning we could learn a lot from Joseph you because Joseph is the one who demonstrated true forgiveness the Brethren that wronged him are I he people who get wronged maybe 20 years ago and they still talking about how wrong they have been wrong and it was wrong for them to wrong them and they still wrong Genesis 4547 that time Joseph cry in backround and what not right Joseph and his Breen come near to me I pray you and they came near to him and he said to him I am Joseph your brother whom you sold into Egypt now therefore be not grieved no angry with yourselves that you sold me hither for God you know people always blaming somebody they're blaming this one and they're blaming that one is she is he always somebody to blame Joseph said for God did send me before you to Pres deserve [Applause] life not only that these are two years at the family in the Land There are five more years in which there shall neither be airing nor Harvest and God sent me before you to preserve you a posterity in the earth and to save your lives by a great Deliverance this is Joseph he's seen the bigger picture do you see the bigger picture or are you still caught up with selfish you me I I myself and myself you can't pray for nobody because you still caught up in you so your prayer stunted you have no growth because it's just you and God in little cocon some people walk with a bubble around them you know then church but have a bubble around them they the Own Zone they zone out God can use suffering that can work for your good and His glory nobody wants to suffer but God sometimes chooses that works that uses that for your own good and I don't want you to just hear this as a sermon or a text I want you to see it as a reality in your own life because you go through stuff that you cannot understand you go through stuff that you don't even ask the question why am I going through this but God set it up a way there's something inside of there for you [Music] it may seem like a misfortune it may seem like a terrible tragedy oh God the brothers had more love and compassion they was in church all time shaking my hand but as soon I got a chance look at them they P me car let take away it's not worthy how Joseph kept his Christianity amidst his situation amen it's noteworthy how Joseph choose not to be Vengeance to take vengeance upon his brother but choose to overcome his bitterness and resentment expressing forgiveness there are some people have bitterness and resentment but you have to overcome that by forgiveness and seeking reconciliation Joseph had the power to really rough up his brethren yeah and that's where you see the character of a person when they have the power and they don't do it Joseph choose not to seek Vengeance but to have forgiveness and to heal those wounds and this type of pardoning and forgiveness changes two people it changes Joseph and it changes the one who he forgives this forgiveness changes you you can be changed if you're ready to let things go you can be changed it not only changes the person who know they wrong you know they Wicked and everything else they know that and you say I forgive you you strip them but it also does something to you it release you from the grip what they do to you have on you because that holds [Applause] you a terrible thing is to be rejected it's a piece of trauma that is people get hardly explained if a if a wife reject a husband or husband reject his wife or reject their parents and reject this one and reject and you know and there's a spirit comes behind that and how do you manage rejection they say people don't reject you they're not accepting you not receiving you but you have to learn that you could overcome all of that Jesus the Bible talk about he came on his own his home receive him not Jesus was rejected he was the rejected King they rejected him and he came with love he came with compassion he came with mercy and he was rejected you have to understand you are sharing also in his sufferings Joseph also demonstrated and a PR brother Isaac was he preaching it about the working with the spirit of excellence and diligence and I have here he who is faithful little is faithful in little will be faithful in much because Joseph started with the first minial task given to him and he did so well Excel so well he got a promotion no Christian should have a Boney about a job no Christian cheating on the job ratting on the job it shouldn't be like that so Joseph operated with Integrity this wrot here and Excellence with a menial task at ptis for house he do it so well that he was given a himy that he earned a prom a promotion integrity and I said Joseph Integrity led him to force in prison Integrity the quality of being honest and having strong moral principle and I want to read this from Genesis 39: 7-12 how Joseph the story with Joseph here he came to pass after these things that his master's Wife cast her eyes upon Joseph she said lie with me but he refused and said unto his master's wife behold this is just Joseph now my master whated not what is with me in the house he had committed all that he had to my hand there is none greater in his house than I neither had he kept back anything from me but thee because thou his wife then how then can I do this great wickedness and sin against God so Joseph wasn't seeing the woman wasn't seeing the Temptation no he was seeing Wick wickedness and sin against God do you see it that way that you could live in wickedness and sin against God and you fear God and you will please God and you will no longer continue in wickedness and [Music] sin came the past she spake to Joseph day by day wasn't stopping the devil wouldn't stop give my pause now he no paing came to pass she speak Jose day by day and he hack nothingto her to lie by her to be with her and it came to pass about this time Joseph went to the house to do his business and there was none of the men of the house there within so the devil is working at time in that time nobody is around he Ain even recognize that he a have a clue with that and watch and she caught him by His Garment and said lie with me and he left the Garment in his hand and fled and got him out that is man who really is man who know when to run take off like a bullet so he showed where integrity and staying with God's word staying in the channel it will pay sin could never come out right wickedness could never come out right I have seen over the years people with all kind of foolishness and see how God deal with them it could never come out right you come to God stay with righteousness glory to God Amen isn't that right Hallelujah another great highlight about Joseph is his patience in God's timing could you imagine a mcka send some postcard to say what was your dream boy and he in jail hey a dream Joseph interpreted the bacon the butler he tell the butler when you go up remember me remember you know he say yeah I remember the man walk out and forget soon as he walk he done that you know that jail bird thing that that jail thing I want to remember that I want I don't want to remember no part of that experience but God I forget and God have a timing Joseph in prison it wasn't a one day prison know it wasn't a 4 hours and he come out you no he spend some time inside of there until God give the Pharaoh a dream and then he want somebody to interpret it then the butler ah hey really had somebody in prison you know his name is Joseph s for Joseph that's the intersection right there that's what God waiting for pharaoh and Joseph how we going to arrange this meeting how we going to arrange this this word how you going to set up these Thunders these voices Oh Glory to go how you going to set up this Pride to become a super church or super race how are we going to set up the bright to catch the headstone how she going to be a super as The Headstone coming how we going to bring this intersection when are we going to started what year what time are we going to break into the Jubilee of the seventh seal where you can be released from your fears when can be released from your past when it can be released from your sickness [Applause] [Music] [Applause] so Joseph you see even tell man remember me he wasn't ready yet and you can't say ready man CLA to be adopted liar know they line to the tongue whe tongue whatever tongue anybody World they line to the tongue misrepresented truth is correct me but the Bible call him lies the Bible didn't say all those who Miss trth go to hell I'm going to L A Fire know Liars so I'll use misrepresent Truth for now when we come back to the word Liars who said so God call them that oh give the Lord a shout but for decency misrepresenting the truth so so Joseph did not get frustrated while waiting because he knew God's time would be perfect you long we talking about Revival are we not frustrated because we know God said said so yes because baram said God said he will send it if the if the people will forget their Crees and dogmas and plead the promises it will become effective to them he said they have no manifestation of God to stir the bride he will send it not too will bring it he will send it well waiting on he not he a man in Trinidad he can only bring talk and more talk but this we're talking about coming is a Revival a Revival is a move of God in power a Revival has get all the drust out of you all the staleness out of you all the tness out of you a Revival is bring something called new wine not old wine new wine and wine does bring simulation of Revelation minders bring old people old people when they hear wine hit them out so the I start they get glassy and get all stimulated Oh Glory that's what Revelation does to you you sit down there all droopy droopy droopy but when that wine hit your soul is the wine of Revelation it brings stimulation is a mystery being revealed and when that love came in the upper room Oh Glory to God there was wine coming on in the upper room the upper room was too small for them just now this Tabernacle too small for us we could be running all over the building we could be running downstairs come back upstairs God have mercy those downstairs will be running upstairs hallelujah hallelujah simil by the wine oh give the Lord some Praises so he did not get frustrated he waited for God's perfect time and brother brandham praise God he said Joseph was a perfect man loved of the father hated of his brother look at Joseph the perfect one we could spend weeks on him love of the father see all this I'm talking here we getting somewhere you this Joseph was an Egyptian this is how Jacob come out of Canaan land This Is How They comeing into Egypt to get food and we remain there for over 400 years do you understand that they were in the land brother George and because famine coming God s an inside man to deal with that famine he said watch the father give him a robe many colors if you watch that robe without seam which here we go represented the holy spirit that covered his being and today it's the holy spirit that covers the church the robe of Many Colors and we have seven colors of the rainbow it is seven colors all we have a rainbow a covenant that God made through Abraham through Isaac through Christ through the church by the baptism of the Holy ghostory that Covenant is made by the baptism Holy Ghost then he said the robe of seven colors that was upon Joseph that was Upon Jesus is upon the church today so we supposed to be highly favored that God can give us the robe of Many Colors let's say it again the robe of seven colors that was upon Joseph that was Upon Jesus is upon the church today Pro protected the body was covered by a robe and the church is not you it's the holy ghost that got you covered with the blood you are not the church the word in you that's the secret isn't that right okay yes sir so Joseph Jacob Jacob lived this is Genesis 47:28 Jacob lived in the land of Egypt 17 years so the whole age of Jacob was 100 147 years wish we had them kind of time now to live but but that KFC and all them modern comfort and what not we not we not clocking this this 147 years talking about here Jacob and his family stayed in Egypt for what 17 years isn't that right and then of course they they begin to multiply and then they raise of pharaoh Joseph of course the Pharaoh start get HS in his mind then people multiplying so fast that they afraid that they go and join up with the Enemy and fight them tell the midwives and them kill all the boys and whatnot and think they didn't do that so they become a threat and the only way to bind them was to enslave them and be taskmasters over them praise God so this Promised Land we read and Jacob dwelt in a land wherein his father was a stranger in the land of Canaan so how did Jacob get dear it was through Abraham scripture you read God promised them this land isn't that right to get out and then Isaac went there and then Jacob and so on and then they got some problems Genesis 31:3 and the Lord said to Jacob return into the land of thy fathers unto thy Kindred and I will be with thee so that is how Jacob come back to the land and Joseph is who pop up there now is that right I'll skip down here now so then in Genesis I think we read here all right I'll read it this is Genesis 15 after these things the word of the Lord came unto Abraham in a vision saying fear not Abraham I'm thy Shield thy exceeding great reward do you think God speaks again just like that he could speak to you and Abraham said Lord God what will thou give me see I go childes and the Ste of my house is this El of Damascus and Abraham said behold to me thou has given no seed and L one born in my house is my ear behold the word of the Lord came unto him saying this shall not be thine ear but he he shall come forth out of thy own Bor tra and ear he brought him forth and said look now towards the heaven tell the Stars if thou be able to number them and he said so shall thy seed be and verse six said he believe in the Lord and he counted him righteousness and then God asked him now how and then he said how shall I know I shall inherit it take me a heer who n three years old she go three years and then he took all this the birds advised not verse 11 when the fs Came Upon the carcass he drove them away and then the son was going down a deep sleep fell upon Abraham a horror of great Darkness fell upon him this is the prophecy that hanging over those children of Israel he said unto Abraham know of assurity that thy seed shall be Stranger in a land that is not dears this land we in right now is not ours this world we in right now is not ours thy sea shall be a stranger in the land is not theirs and Shall Serve them and they shall afflict them 400 years and also that Nation whom they Shall Serve will I judge amen goh shall judge them yes and afterwards shall they come out with great substance but thou shal go to thy fathers in peace and shall be buried in good old age Glory Hallelujah you love him this morning are you enjoying the word so after 400 years pressure actually 430 Here Come Baby Moses because God promised after 400 years Deliverance coming amen Pharaoh wise men and them suiters and as we say them OB men and them wish doctors and Wizard and whoever they see a star and they say kill all the babies two years and under and we know the story Moses was sailed down into the hands of the Pharaoh Camp to be educated and raised up by Pharaoh isn't that right but this is the promise that God made to bring them back now to the land so here they drift out 400 years and I'm saying this to say that the church left Pentecost way back God sent a prophet to turn our hearts back to that am and the message stumbling and fumbling nobody want to talk about Pentecost nobody want to about the Pentecostal experience nobody talking about the fire of God they want to talk about seals trumpets vials woes woman in his son mystery Babylon and everything else all the mysteries in between but the purpose of the church he said the even time message is to loose the holy ghost seven angels come from eternity to tie up the scattered word to tie it back into the word to bring down the Holy Ghost because the Holy Ghost the word is the conduct of the spirit so the full Spirit could move because the word was broken up through Seven Ages God sent a prophet like a plumber like an electrician to connect the dcks together to pull the whole line that the bride will be connected I am the vine you are the branches to pull the whole line that the spirit can flow freely there is my spirit flowing freely Oh Glory to God are we going to see an another Mighty book of Acts yes because he said if that tree put forth another original branch it will bring forth un original Fruit Oh Glory to God we have seen enough grafted in grafted in who playing Prophet mini Prophet who playing that they Min son man and and if if wasn't but BR God choose them all kind of foolishness we had enough of that but God promised that there will be another original branch and that original Branch will bring back original Fruit oh God I'll ride this Trail once more there'll be one more ride Oh Glory to God the White Horse Ride of the Holy Ghost there'll be one more ride hallel ljah Hallelujah glory to God thank you Lord thank you Lord Brother I wonder tonight if I'm speaking to people who wants me to start to go through with God and when the testing time come you choose rather to go back into the world and do the things of the world or did you take the rugged way of Salvation did you do like Moses when he was under testing when he had his foot on the throne of Egypt eypt but he esteemed The Riches of Christ greater Treasures than all the riches of Egypt he forsook Egypt did not care how much gold how many popular he took God at his word he forsook the things of Egypt counting the reproach of Christ greater riches what do we do Under the testing when the hard Trials Come not trials you know and you're boarding like a cow with tri you will Fe out right Bo when you heart Trials come we have to be stronger than that you what do we do Under the testing when the hard Trials come when they say because that you separate yourself from the things of the world you are religious fanatic does the strain come it's got to come and you got to make the choice so you're a Christian not because you say amen and Glory Hallelujah here you're Christian when the test come when the orange is squeezed when you are squeezed or you are pressed that is when it it it comes up to you God has one way of bringing light to you one that's when you are ready to separate yourself from all the things of the world all the cares of the world and cling only to God's promised word Paul was a Nazarite Aon was a Nazarite it's a total separation we are not to go back into the world no more or have anything to do with the world but to cleave only to God Jesus is coming for a bride a woman of church that is separated from the things of the world now you hearing this and if the world say t to you you know that you're bright one to be this bride is separated from things of the world the cares of the life isn't that right she's separated from the cares and traditions of churches she's separated only to God and God is the word and as husband and wife is one so does the bride and the word becomes one for the word is living through the bride that's her credentials that's the identification oh pra God so Moses commission give him in Exodus 378 the Lord said I've surely seen the Affliction of my people which are in Egypt and I've heard their Cry by reason of the task Masters F know their sorrows it's amazing how God already prophesied to Abraham that his people has than 400 years and if somebody had read that prophecy during the time but Andrew and say you go say Deliver us know so I as well take the licks with ease take the pressure with ease I have to pray I do have to cry I just sit down and relax because God will surely do it watch this God say he deliver them God say he send a deliverer but the people had to cry God's confession was that I heard the cries of my people and he said I know their sorrows verse 8 and I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians and to bring up them up out of that land into a good large land flowing in milk and honey onto the place of the Canaanites and the hivites and the amorites and the parasites and the Hittites and the jeites and God I over here seeing all them ites all around here the people down here in bondage right here in Pharaoh they come out yet and he now talking to Moses on the mountain I comeing to deliver them to bring from here to Dear he didn't hold back and said is a land it empty it flat like a plane you just had a drive on it and what not and this blow on your grass and and build your house you didn't say that you know land of Hittites jebusites amorites you have a lot of i in it but it's your land I bring it to that land handle them deal with them strip them beat them run them out your land it's the promised land go take it it is your jurisdiction I can't take it for you I could give it to you but I can't take it for you you have to possess it I can't put my foot on it for you you got the place oh give the Lord a shout in the house because as man I give you jurisdiction on the earth to possess to rule to Reign to conquer to overcome oh give the Lord some Praises hallelujah hallelujah so Moses was given instruction by God to go to fa Pho and get the people out and lead them back to Canaan this promised land and there's a promised land for the bride Oh Glory to God and God sent a prophet and he God he said God will raise up his joshuas that will take the people over to the promised land to get them over there you have to cross Jordan glory to God you can't just talk Mysteries you have to cross Jordan there's a depth of a corner wheat death to self death to Pride death to who you think you are Oh Glory death to how you see yourself yeah Oh Glory to God hallelujah Exodus 3:10 it says come now therefore and I will send thee unto Pharaoh that D bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt not Comfort them in Egypt bring them out of Egypt God want you out of Egypt say it God want you out of Egypt Jesus prayed a prayer he said father they in the world but not of the world you in but not of in but not of because I chose you before the foundation of the world isn't that right glory of God so the purpose of the commission for Moses was to bring them back to Canaan the ultimate purpose was to fulfill what God promised to Abraham Isaac and Jacob Exodus 66 and 8 wherefore say unto the children of Israel listen I am the lordu and I will bring you out from under the burden of the Egyptians I will rid you out of their bondage I will redeem you with a stretched out arm and with great judgments I will take you to me for a people and I will be to you a god you shall know that I am the Lord your God which bringeth you out of under the burdens of the Egyptians I will bring you into the land concerning which I did swear to give to Abraham and to Isaac and to Jacob I will give it to you for Heritage I am the Lord Oh Glory to God oh give the Lord some Praises now Moses himself did not enter isn't that something else the man that brought him out the Ender God leave that commission to Joshua after moses' death but Moses was the one that laid the platform for them to come up to the land isn't that something else Hallelujah Exodus 12:40 says now the souring of the children of Israel who dwelt in Egypt was 430 years it came to pass at the end of 430 years even the self same day it came to pass that all of the host of the Lord went out from the land of Egypt Exodus 2:23 25 and it came to pass in the process of time that the king of Egypt died and the children of Israel sigh by the reason of bondage and they cried and their Cry came came up before God you mean your cry can come up before God yes you think that and the devil don't want you to cry no did you get that the devil don't want you to pray he don't want you to cry you don't want you to plead you don't want you to ask but we are encouraging you this morning God want you to cry he want you to plead he wanted to ask deliver me Deliver Me free me bless me help me bless my family deliver my family Oh Glory to God God want you to seek his face verse 24 and God heard their

Open Heavens they could do whatever they want to do oh praise I I've heard their groaning and God remember his Covenant with Abraham with Isaac and with Jacob and God looked upon the children of Israel and God had respect unto them oh hallelujah hallelujah praise God but brandham I rather abide under the shadows of the Almighty I rather take my way with Jacob a of a pillow for a stone pillow of a stone i' rather be considered by the world a crank than to have all the rich riches and blessings that this world could offer to give C greater is the blessings of God that all the riches and gold and silver of this world the end of the pran on Friday I told you that your job is not permanent so you better connect to the one who give you the job Who provided a job for you because your job is not permanent either you leave the job or the job leave you but praise God all you go partway some point in time hallelujah praise God believe it or not almost there oh almost finished imagine that he never blessed Israel until they come back to the promised land and when they got back to the promised land signs and wonders begin to happen and whenever we come to our Junction there's going to be signs and wonders omnipotent speaking the miraculous taking place and we are coming to a junction 2024 Oh Glory to God hallelujah hallelujah Sint we such a critical condition Junction I don't know how else to say it it's just three stages one was leading of Egypt one stage next stage is Wilderness next stage Canaan Canaan does not represent the age of the Millennium it only represent the age of the

God love them you know is love make him send Moses his love make him plague Pharaoh with flies and frogs and is love make him do all of that you know is God love for this people you know and these people going to perish because of unbelief right at the junction right when the promise is at the door to go and possess it these people decide to go and pause I'm going to wonder because any pause

Holy Ghost is this and and you have it already no no don't don't the promise is the holy spirit for and then he quote this for it shall come to pass in the last days Joel 2:28 I will Port my spirit All Flesh that wasn't just for acts too that's for us here too scripture compound meaning Oh Glory to God that work on Pentecost and not working right here that's why I read that scripture it shall

sanctify yourselves let no man come at his wife for within three days you will see the glory of God it is a process of getting ready to inherit the promise then he said this here today the church has come through justification through Luther Sanic through the Methodist now up to the time of the promise look how he placing it the promise is the baptism of the spirit which is Promised all through the Old Testament and New too then he given it from Jesus now the promise is behold I send the promise of my father upon you that is the promise the promised land is to live in the land of the holy spirit that is God's promise for the church is to live in the power of the spirit it's another world it's another land you have to come out of the condition that you have been in to come out to live in this promised land to receive your promise you shall receive power from on high oh give the Lord a shout my God my God my God I am convinced that we're going back to Pentecost I am convinced there will to be a mighty outpouring of the Holy Ghost I am convinced that there going to be a super church or super race I am convinced that there going to be another book of Acts that's why I'm preaching like this that's why I am believing like this that's why I am pumping like this I am convinced oh give the Lord some Praises this morning hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory to God hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah One Time Mary and Joseph they miss Jesus they gone without him see where did you leave him at the Feast of Pentecost that's exactly where the J left him but Abraham they left him at Pentecost the only way they will get the real message is to go back to Pentecost not just press and play go back to Pentecost you can press play till now till the you can put it you can put the play in your head and all stay on top of your head play day and night the only way they will get the real message is to go back to Pentecost where they left him at go back here to where the Holy Ghost came like a rushing Mighty Wind and and fell on the church no mystery have fallen on the church the Holy Ghost has fall we can preach the Mysteries but the Holy Ghost had to fall fall on the church glory to God they can't close us down until we get at Pentecost they cannot shut down this church until the power of God hit it from the pulpit to the back pen no body can close it [Applause] down no man could close this down he said there will be a church with Jesus walking in it and the shout of the king will be in the camp oh give the chur Give the Lord some Praises that's the [Applause] prophecy glory to God hallelujah glory to God glory to God glory to God hallelujah hallelujah go back to where the Holy Ghost came in like a Russian Mighty Wind and fell in the church the hearts were a fire and burnt with the power of God they went forth Healing The Sick casting out evil spirit and prophesying speaking with tongues and showing signs and wonders that's the only way brother sister that we ever be able to get find back God back in the church is to go back where we left him at the beginning Oh Glory to God mus come please Hallelujah if we expect God to keep his word if we expect God to do the things that he for us that we are asking we will never be able to do it until we get back and Obey what God said we have got to go back where we left off at we have got to go back to Pentecost we have got to go back to the comforter we have got to go back to the Holy Spirit which is our comforter Oh Glory to God hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah [Applause] [Music] [Applause] hallelujah there's a quote where he said all the mysteries of god father may be revealed that we can know how to behave ourselves not argue not to go on a podcast and say well I I know all the Mysteries I have head of the hour but Brown talk about John the Apostle of Love would certainly see when the church begin to lose his first love of God they love the pastor but they don't love God they love the church but they don't love God because God is the word there people who love to go to church you know they in love with the music and the clap and the thing they in love love with the atmosphere but when it come to obey God they have nothing to do with that when they look in the mirror they forget what they look at 1 John 53 say for this is the love of God that we keep his Commandments his word this is what the love of God one little deviation from the word was a step away from Christ people say they love God they go to church they even shout Rejoice sing have a great emotional time when it is all over watch and see if they are in that word walking in it living in it if they go through all the other and then don't walk in the word they can say they love God but their lives tell a different story hallelujah hallelujah praise God get back to God repent before it's too late see the handwriting on the wall it is writing judgment as the sacred vessels were desecrated and dust brought the wrath of God now the sacred word has been desecrated and the spirit is grieved and the judgment is here even at the door repent repent go back to Pentecost back to the Legion of the Holy Ghost back to the word of God for why will you die final quote two quotes brother Bram from True sign Overlook he said raise up this one that you're speaking of in the scriptures to about Elijah of Malachi 4 anoint him Lord I call for him send him Lord our hungry hearts are crying send him Lord that will return the people back to the F of the fathers again listen that will get them away from this denominational puppets into a real experience with God like they did on Pentecost a real Church burning with the same message the same Faith the same Doctrine the same Bible the same God with the same signs raise us up our Propet Lord and the final quote I begin to play something and we are going to the end time right now by saying this the end time message is to get the bride ready and prepared for the Rapture what can it do according to Malachi 4 is to bring them back to the fith that was once delivered to the Saints bring them back to the fate of the fathers the Pentecostal part in the restoration time oh glory to God did you get that bring them back to the page of the fathers the Pentecostal part in the restoration time so he is saying and in this message there's a Pentecostal path in the time of restoration we have to go back to the promised land returning to the land of promise I will restore sayth the Lord that's the real event God bless you thanks

coming Wednesday 8:00 p.m. here at the Tabernacle we are under great expectation for what God will do this Wednesday night this coming Friday there will be no Zoom prayer meeting this coming Friday there will be no Zoom prayer meeting however this coming Saturday at 5:00 p.m. there will be a life and godliness Focus service it is targeted to the young people but all are welcome that's 5:00 p.m. this coming Saturday live and God in your service at 5:00 p.m. so once again service continues this Wednesday 8:00 p.m. here at the Tabernacle this Saturday at 5:00 p.m. life and God in the service uh Target it to the young people but certainly all are welcome there will be no Friday Zoom prayer meeting this week service continues next Sunday and next Sunday is going to be a special restoration and deliverance service our restoration and deliverance service so we encourage you to invite somebody out there are many who have lost Joy lost Zeal life has given them a punch in the face as it were and we want to create an opening a space of grace before time runs out to get our loved ones in so this coming Sunday a special restoration and deliverance service and we're looking for God to do something tremendous in our midst by the grace of God next Tuesday is Republic day it is is a public holiday and brother ID would like me to announce that we want to have a special Fellowship day so it's a Republic Day cookout and fellowship day all right cookout and fellowship day from is it 9:00 a.m. we said from 9 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. will be will be the timing on that day and uh it's a time of Fellowship a time of different activities but specifically to the cookout there will be four teams that will go head-to-head to present a payow menu and juice so you get to present a payow menu and your choice of juice or juices I guess and there'll be it's a competition and the team will consist of a minimum the teams rather will consist of a minimum of 10 members including a captain and a Vice Captain and the pillow rice and meat pillow rice and peas are to be cooked separate from the meat to allow for vegetarian option the menu structure would look something like pilow with the meat cold SLO potato macaroni salad the juice is a mixture of natural and you could spice it up with different things the the paow and Juice will be judged separately but based on taste and flavors creativity Innovation presentation and overall teamwork and the teams will be furnished with the main ingredients and we'll be allowed two hours to deliver the final product on that day so we have four teams and we have appointed four team captains and we will encourage you to tie yourself to a captain and in similar fashion the captains will tie themselves to you to create some formidable teams so one team will be led by Brother Steven Kangley one team led by Sister Abigail Nicholas one team led by Brother Andy Henry and one team led by Sister Ronda Williams so we will see what the Lord will do um appetizer plates are to be made available uh for what will be a cocktail type meal setup there'll also be some games uh so that people could play different games and stuff and of course the dress code is casual and comfortable there's no plan for having physical Sports in that day but it's really a time for Fellowship fun some friendly competition some time to eat and spend some time with the Believers can a church say amen amen so I know there's a lot to un pack there but I think you get a general idea and certainly we'll keep in communication during this week and by next Sunday we should have a clear plan but for those who are very spiritually competitive I would encourage you to start to get yourself sorted out so final announcement there next Sunday after the service as well next Sunday we'd like to speak to all the parents of the Sunday School students so if your child is in Sunday school we want to have a brief conversation with all of the parents of the Sunday school class after the service next week Lord willing so very quickly again service continues this Wednesday here at the Tabernacle no Friday Zoom prayer meeting we have our youth service life and godliness this coming Saturday at 5:00 p.m. service continues next Sunday next Sunday special restoration and deliverance service after that service we will have a conversation with the parents of the Sunday School and then next Tuesday which is a public holiday will be a special day of fellowship and cookout four teams identified and there are some other rules in there so we will circulate those via the WhatsApp group Etc but for team Sister Abigail Nicholas brother Steven Kangley Brother Andy Henry and sister Ronda Williams we encourage you to align with the team and don't be surprised if one of these captains reach out to align themselves with you and may the Lord richly bless you have a wonderful full week in the presence of the Lord be conscious of his presence there's something brother said during his service about that drone that hope is over you and I hope it's a natural type to a spiritual truth because the reality is the Holy Ghost is watching you every move there's an eye watching you so be very sensitive that in your daily walk your daily talk your daily Administration that you are you know cognizant of the fact that the Holy Ghost is watching you as a tutor and based on your behavior he could say that there's one over there and there's one over there and this trial didn't derail you and this situation didn't have you do any wrong thing but your behavior and your conduct was worthy of a son even though you had a trial even though you had a situation so may the Lord Rich you bless you Lord glory to God you appreciate that today amen amen praise God hallelujah
