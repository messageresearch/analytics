[41:37] chapter 5 1-7
[41:40] we want to look at revelation 10 1-4 and
[41:42] revelation 8 verse 1
[41:44] first scripture reading we appreciate
[41:47] the messages going past
[41:49] anthony to the door but isaac to know
[41:51] him his life we certainly appreciate
[41:53] amen brethren standing in the gap
[41:56] and sharing this burden and work of the
[41:58] ministry
[42:00] chapter 5 of revelation i saw in the
[42:02] writing of him that sat on the throne
[42:04] a book written within and on the
[42:07] backside
[42:07] sealed with seven seals i saw a strong
[42:11] angel proclaiming a lord voice
[42:13] who is worthy to open the book and to
[42:15] loose the seals thereof
[42:18] no man in heaven not in earth neither
[42:20] under the earth was able to
[42:22] open the book near to look there on and
[42:24] i went much
[42:25] because no one was found worthy to open
[42:28] and to read a book needed to look there
[42:31] on and one of the elders said unto me
[42:32] weep not
[42:33] behold the land of the tribe of judah
[42:35] the root of david had prevailed
[42:38] to open the book until lucie seven cease
[42:39] thereof and i be held in lieu in the
[42:41] midst of the throne
[42:42] of the forbeas in the midst of the
[42:43] elders to the lamb
[42:45] it has been slain having seven owns and
[42:48] seven eyes which are
[42:49] the seven spirits of god sent forth into
[42:52] all the earth
[42:53] and he came and took the book out of the
[42:55] right hand
[42:56] of him that sat on the throne reading
[42:59] version 10
[43:00] verse 1 so the lamb took the book
[43:04] on version 10 and i saw another mighty
[43:06] angel come down from heaven
[43:08] through with the cloud rainbow was upon
[43:10] his head his face as it were the sun
[43:13] his feet are still as the fire and he
[43:15] had in his hand
[43:16] a little book open so the book is no
[43:18] longer in heaven but come down to the
[43:20] earth
[43:21] he said his right foot upon the sea his
[43:22] left foot on the earth carried a lord
[43:24] voices when he
[43:26] land wrought and when he had cried seven
[43:28] thunders after the voices
[43:30] and when the seven turners had uttered
[43:31] the voices i was about to write and i
[43:33] heard a voice
[43:34] from heaven saying unto me seal up those
[43:36] things which attempt on this uttered
[43:38] and write them not last scripture
[43:40] revelation 8 verse 1 and when he had
[43:42] opened the seventh seal
[43:43] there was silence in heaven about his
[43:45] peace of hafer now let's pray father we
[43:47] thank you
[43:48] for your will this morning and we pray
[43:49] come and interpret it to our hearts lord

[43:57] by the operation of the holy ghost
[43:58] by the spirit and the probe of the
[44:00] spirit and by you having a preeminence

[44:04] ask it amen you will be seated
[44:07] we'll praise god thanks for coming out
[44:10] uh
[44:11] praise god so now that you are here
[44:14] you want to benefit from being here in
[44:16] the service of the lord
[44:18] and you want to apply the word and feet
[44:22] amen because many people uh in israel
[44:25] the word that they heard wasn't mixed
[44:27] with feet and it did not profit them
[44:30] so i said this way to you two thousand
[44:33] two million people
[44:34] heard books and tapes heard moses
[44:37] message

[44:44] men from what they hear
[44:46] it's not even the word seed is the kind
[44:48] of heart that receives the word
[44:50] seed because some fell on the wayside
[44:53] same for
[44:53] same fall and among among thorns and so
[44:56] on some fell upon rocks and so on but
[44:58] some fell on good ground
[45:00] so there's nothing wrong with the seed
[45:02] the seed is fine
[45:03] hallelujah is the soil and the soil is
[45:06] the environment
[45:07] soil is the atmosphere the soil is where
[45:10] make the difference
[45:11] what happens and the effect of that seed
[45:14] upon your life
[45:15] every service that comes they get come
[45:17] they get seed and it's up to you to
[45:19] receive it

[1:03:10] he not was walking with god you know and
[1:03:12] then after what he was not it unfolded
[1:03:15] all of a sudden he get light and he just
[1:03:16] took off oh glory to god hallelujah
[1:03:20] and if you are seed of god it has to
[1:03:22] unfold so when it was in music when he
[1:03:24] was in the party when he was in a dance
[1:03:26] and god flipped you around and turned
[1:03:27] around
[1:03:28] and you get baptized in jesus name it
[1:03:29] was you it was him
[1:03:31] because all that the father had given
[1:03:33] him shall come
[1:03:35] so you can you send your baptist church
[1:03:36] methodist church pentecostal church you
[1:03:38] have to come out
[1:03:39] so god released a message to call you
[1:03:41] out
[1:03:43] but not just to call you out to bring
[1:03:44] you in
[1:03:47] oh glory to god hallelujah hallelujah
[1:03:51] and this to bring you in now is to bring
[1:03:53] him to be a manifested son
[1:03:55] and to be a manifested son you have to
[1:03:56] get back to the book that adam lost
[1:03:59] because that book had the authority you
[1:04:01] see everybody had to be authorized
[1:04:03] they have laws and rules and regulation
[1:04:05] by which they give the policeman
[1:04:06] authority
[1:04:07] to the locker people and always a man
[1:04:09] can come and say i'm police because i'll
[1:04:10] pull uniform
[1:04:13] and he said i'm a police are coming to
[1:04:14] the lock you up way about
[1:04:16] be authority well you know i'm my
[1:04:18] brother my brother is a real policeman
[1:04:21] and i borrow his uniform and you know i
[1:04:24] was acting it doesn't have that
[1:04:27] that's like paula and peter i know who
[1:04:29] are you you see you can't come and act
[1:04:31] that
[1:04:31] it has to be authorized so that is when
[1:04:35] you have the
[1:04:36] legal authority of what is written
[1:04:39] hallelujah so that is why it was written
[1:04:43] to give sons the legal authority so the
[1:04:45] devil had a right to be the chief
[1:04:47] squatter because no son
[1:04:49] produced the deed to challenge the devil
[1:04:51] from his squatting position on the earth
[1:04:54] did you hear that well adam felt the
[1:04:57] devil had full rain you know
[1:04:58] he said good i have full clearance i do
[1:05:01] what i want to do
[1:05:02] start to go with the torah babel he's
[1:05:04] had to do all kind of thing
[1:05:05] science and technology start that'll go
[1:05:07] down the road so and god only signed
[1:05:09] mystery after mystery abraham fate
[1:05:11] isaac love jacob grace prophet after
[1:05:14] prophet god laying up a platform
[1:05:16] to bring back the sons all his objective
[1:05:18] was to bring back the sons
[1:05:19] the killing bulls and goats and bullocks
[1:05:22] trying to
[1:05:22] make an atonement until the perfect lamb
[1:05:25] had to come and when the lamb come the
[1:05:27] devil
[1:05:27] know this man was a little different if
[1:05:29] though be if toby
[1:05:31] know you're who you are if dolby if toby
[1:05:34] if toby and all jesus
[1:05:36] has written this written it is also
[1:05:37] written so when jesus go on now jesus
[1:05:40] had to pepper them and cast out devils
[1:05:42] and the first time they seen devils
[1:05:43] being cast out oh glory to god he
[1:05:45] started rebuke devils so glory to god
[1:05:47] heal the sick all kind of miracles the
[1:05:50] only ones what man or man is this
[1:05:52] he's had to call some men he said well
[1:05:53] you always wanted them to you know or
[1:05:55] or they would be just like me you know
[1:05:56] or only the little one on me you know
[1:05:58] i'm only a small version of what i am
[1:06:01] praise god this is what you're going to
[1:06:02] be
[1:06:03] i'm going to reflect on what you have to
[1:06:05] become because i call you to make
[1:06:07] disciples
[1:06:08] oh glory to god and before you can make
[1:06:09] disciples you have to become a disciple
[1:06:12] oh glory to god come on preach back to
[1:06:13] me somebody and i call you to make it so
[1:06:15] you show them the end game
[1:06:17] that you are going to be these the
[1:06:18] fishes of men or give the lord a shout
[1:06:21] or if the devil only knew he never let
[1:06:24] jesus go to calvary
[1:06:26] if the devil only knew even the lord
[1:06:28] jesus died of all age
[1:06:29] but when jesus died and he shed his
[1:06:32] blood
[1:06:33] and he paid the price i see nobody at
[1:06:37] the stable
[1:06:38] nobody have to say bongo stay tied up
[1:06:41] still you could go free this morning
[1:06:48] glory glory you you may be seated
[1:06:52] not the final offer the devil for jesus
[1:06:54] he said all this kingdom on his mind
[1:06:56] correct as a squatter and and and all
[1:06:59] you have to do
[1:07:00] is to you know you rather go take the
[1:07:01] car he's trying to get into the calvary
[1:07:04] because calvary is where the price was
[1:07:06] paid
[1:07:07] for what for the book
[1:07:14] because when the lamb when the one sat
[1:07:16] on the throne with the book sealed
[1:07:19] no man was found worthy john began to
[1:07:22] weep
[1:07:23] who was worthy who is worthy
[1:07:27] all the years since adam fell
[1:07:30] waiting for somebody to get to that book
[1:07:35] that little book that is written within
[1:07:38] and sealed with seven seals if we can't

[1:11:06] foolishness
[1:11:07] though i have no part of that the lord a
[1:11:09] delay is not coming
[1:11:10] he is waiting on a bride that would step
[1:11:13] forward
[1:11:14] to produce a revival to get to know who
[1:11:17] she is
[1:11:18] who where she come from and who the
[1:11:20] devil is
[1:11:27] let me say this to you one thing the
[1:11:29] devil hates
[1:11:30] is individual revelation he hates
[1:11:34] when god could you could get revelation
[1:11:37] and the reason god could give revelation
[1:11:38] to the literate you don't need to have
[1:11:40] head
[1:11:40] read and write to get revelation
[1:11:42] revelation is god speaking to your heart
[1:11:44] direct
[1:11:47] the word pumping spoken word the man
[1:11:50] preaching from the written word
[1:11:52] but the living word which is the logo
[1:11:54] still of fire
[1:11:55] god himself he coming and reveal himself
[1:11:58] to you
[1:11:59] he asked them who do men say i am some
[1:12:01] say this
[1:12:02] some say that some people like to talk
[1:12:05] about others
[1:12:06] they can't say nothing about their self
[1:12:08] they can't give no personal testimony
[1:12:10] they like to report on what others
[1:12:11] saying and whatever is doing
[1:12:13] but jesus calling him give him a
[1:12:16] question but isaac
[1:12:17] who do you say i
[1:12:21] son of man oh glory i have a question
[1:12:24] for you
[1:12:25] tell me tell me tell me oh glory to god
[1:12:28] in the scots in the head because they
[1:12:29] didn't know
[1:12:30] they were following without revelation
[1:12:32] when peter said though i the christ
[1:12:34] the son of the living god jesus said
[1:12:36] flesh and blood
[1:12:38] and we need to hear more of that we need
[1:12:40] to hear people who break past flesh and
[1:12:42] blood
[1:12:43] heart not reveal it unto you but my
[1:12:46] father
[1:12:47] hath revealed it upon us unto you and i
[1:12:49] say lord pete and upon this rock
[1:12:51] i will build my church and the gates of
[1:12:54] hell
[1:12:55] so don't tell me hell beating you up you
[1:12:58] need revelation
[1:12:59] he said upon this rock we need to cry
[1:13:02] for revelation
[1:13:03] upon this rock we need to get in the
[1:13:05] spirit to get revelation
[1:13:07] wrote don't come and look for me and
[1:13:08] what brother you're trying to say i
[1:13:10] ain't trying to say nothing
[1:13:11] i call the minister the word i come to
[1:13:14] bring the word and the word delivers you
[1:13:16] the word will bust through your mind
[1:13:17] bless your human spirit
[1:13:19] you have to get out your own self
[1:13:21] hallelujah praise god hallelujah praise
[1:13:24] god praise god
[1:13:26] amen for the life was manifested
[1:13:31] that means the life could be manifested
[1:13:34] think about it watch age 12 to 30
[1:13:39] silence jesus is saying nothing
[1:13:42] you're going to template and hear them
[1:13:44] preaching open interpretation all kind
[1:13:46] of coco revelation
[1:13:47] and he's saying a word that is control
[1:13:50] that is temperance the living word
[1:13:53] sitting in service
[1:13:55] and here in scribe and pharisees sunday
[1:13:57] sabbath day after sabbath
[1:13:58] given contrary conclusions
[1:14:02] revelations and inspiration when jesus
[1:14:06] when jesus received his blessing from
[1:14:08] above
[1:14:10] fully holy ghost in his fullness i
[1:14:13] overcome the devil in the wilderness
[1:14:15] without showing a clue of his power that
[1:14:18] was resident
[1:14:19] because you see you see on the outside
[1:14:22] but you don't know what is hidden on the
[1:14:23] inside
[1:14:25] so jesus was given the devil spoken word
[1:14:28] about the written word so he said it is
[1:14:31] written
[1:14:32] man's channel he was quoting the written
[1:14:35] word
[1:14:36] he was speaking the word to the devil
[1:14:38] and he was the living word
[1:14:40] so the living word was quoting back the
[1:14:43] written word
[1:14:44] to lucifer without one display of power
[1:14:48] he said it is written it wasn't a man
[1:14:51] called in that you know
[1:14:52] it was the living word the word made
[1:14:55] flesh
[1:14:56] the word of life oh glory to god
[1:15:00] because god was so mysterious this print
[1:15:03] form
[1:15:05] is this a veil this print form
[1:15:09] is hidden stuff inside the deer you have
[1:15:11] to seal it up
[1:15:14] and even with revelation there still
[1:15:16] remains a supernatural element
[1:15:19] because god still wants to reveal
[1:15:20] himself so jesus
[1:15:23] when he overcome the devil the first
[1:15:25] thing he did was to hit the temple
[1:15:28] and when they call up who want to read
[1:15:30] he
[1:15:31] he said i want to read
[1:15:35] they keep calling who want to come and
[1:15:36] read scripture jesus raised them yes sir
[1:15:39] first time in many years he came to read
[1:15:40] scripture and he found the place where
[1:15:42] it was written
[1:15:43] because you had to feel read the script
[1:15:44] they want to read the spirit is upon me
[1:15:46] that wasn't talk that wasn't prophecy
[1:15:49] that was present tense
[1:15:51] he was quoting the written word and it
[1:15:53] was fulfilling
[1:15:55] he was fulfilling the written word
[1:15:56] quoting the word itself the spirit is
[1:15:58] upon me where he anointed me to do this
[1:16:00] that that that that and afterwards he
[1:16:03] said this day
[1:16:04] you see what you see written here talk
[1:16:07] over
[1:16:09] this was spoken by the prophet isaiah
[1:16:11] 61.
[1:16:13] this year is not history this is not
[1:16:15] texas exhort
[1:16:16] this is a life today so i could say it's
[1:16:19] fulfilled
[1:16:21] because i am here and the spirit is upon
[1:16:23] me to fulfill
[1:16:25] what about the bride the spirit and the
[1:16:28] bride
[1:16:30] say come that means the bride have to
[1:16:33] come into her position
[1:16:34] to fight her scriptures to be anointed
[1:16:37] with the spirit
[1:16:38] and then you become the spirit's voice
[1:16:41] spoken word once more
[1:16:43] the world will get direct from god
[1:16:45] there's no book on tape thing
[1:16:46] this is direct from god god coming out
[1:16:49] your mouth
[1:16:50] could we give the lord a shout
[1:17:04] not the definition of logos
[1:17:08] of speech a word uttered
[1:17:12] by a living voice a living voice
[1:17:16] i like that to speak
[1:17:19] the word so when peter received the holy
[1:17:21] ghost
[1:17:22] he was in god's kingdom as a son
[1:17:25] and he become a channel of god so god
[1:17:28] could not be released
[1:17:30] through the lips of a son by spoken word
[1:17:33] oh glory to god so peter was in the body
[1:17:36] so for cornelius to get a breakthrough
[1:17:38] god had to send the anoint cornelius to
[1:17:41] send for peter
[1:17:42] for peter to get a breakthrough gotta
[1:17:44] give it a vision to rise kill and eat
[1:17:46] something that he knows he don't touch
[1:17:47] at all and god of the show peter
[1:17:50] you can't call what you call unclean i
[1:17:52] call clean
[1:17:53] so we're talking two different languages
[1:17:54] here gotta show him you have to change
[1:17:56] your thinking
[1:17:57] because he's sending it to a people you
[1:17:58] don't know about i just understood where
[1:18:01] you don't even think you have to go
[1:18:02] you're going
[1:18:03] so guarded to prepare peter's heart mind
[1:18:05] and spirit to adjust his thinking
[1:18:08] what about your thinking where are you
[1:18:10] going with your thinking
[1:18:12] your thinking limits you god had to
[1:18:14] adjust your thinking
[1:18:15] if you received a different picture
[1:18:17] altogether so when peter was getting the
[1:18:19] call
[1:18:20] a man named come here send for you
[1:18:22] that's gentile you're talking about
[1:18:24] cornelius
[1:18:27] and why peter speak the words what the
[1:18:30] words
[1:18:31] what words the words spoken word coming
[1:18:34] out of his mouth
[1:18:35] holy ghost glory to god the word
[1:18:38] written word spoken word and now the
[1:18:42] seals oh the holy ghost you know the
[1:18:44] holy ghost is the seals
[1:18:46] you know the season the back of the book
[1:18:48] is the holy ghost
[1:18:49] you know the holy ghost is the seal of
[1:18:51] the living god and that's used in seven
[1:18:53] parts
[1:18:54] you know when god's healed you we see it
[1:18:56] with seven spirits
[1:18:58] all on them seven spirits would overcome
[1:19:00] the devil in every age
[1:19:02] all glory licked them up in every age
[1:19:04] red orange red white horse
[1:19:06] every ears the believers overcome
[1:19:09] oh give the lord a shout god release the

[1:19:25] that there's going to be a super church
[1:19:26] come on now it's going to be a super
[1:19:28] race
[1:19:29] wait till we get to the back of the book
[1:19:32] them back seals them thunders all glory
[1:19:36] the dempseys and the blackest thunders
[1:19:39] them voices themselves in the back of
[1:19:41] the book as thunders

[1:19:46] [Applause]
[1:19:48] shout
[1:19:51] [Applause]
[1:19:54] a word uttered by a living voice
[1:19:58] a living voice not just scripture texts
[1:20:02] but a living voice some of these texts
[1:20:04] have to come alive
[1:20:06] how to become a living voice so it'll be
[1:20:08] a living word
[1:20:09] spoken word remember those brothers have
[1:20:11] no scriptures
[1:20:13] their words will become in scripture oh
[1:20:16] glory to god do you get that
[1:20:18] when the holy ghost hit them there they
[1:20:20] were the living word

[1:26:06] spoken word so you're not born by flesh
[1:26:08] and blood
[1:26:09] but as many have received him the damn
[1:26:11] give you power
[1:26:12] that were born not the flesh and blood
[1:26:17] [Applause]
[1:26:20] born by the incorruptible seed
[1:26:24] of the word of god whose son are your
[1:26:26] mom
[1:26:27] whose daughter you know is that your
[1:26:29] mother and father

[1:26:49] god you're not making of you to preach
[1:26:51] you know making me feel to preach you're
[1:26:53] getting away
[1:26:55] where the devil can't touch you but you
[1:26:57] can tie up yourself
[1:26:59] you can bind yourself you can trap your
[1:27:01] own self
[1:27:04] [Applause]
[1:27:07] [Music]
[1:27:07] [Applause]
[1:27:08] [Music]
[1:27:10] [Applause]
[1:27:14] you mean you can yes how's somebody give
[1:27:18] a story
[1:27:19] another real story but it's something
[1:27:20] that you gained from it alaina man
[1:27:23] walking in the jungle
[1:27:25] i demanded the lion are you stronger
[1:27:28] than you
[1:27:29] can i said no you're not different
[1:27:31] things they're arguing back and forth
[1:27:34] i can't have a big picture of a man
[1:27:36] conquering a lion
[1:27:38] and the man tell the lion you see that
[1:27:42] i tell you i'm stronger than you look at
[1:27:44] that picture you rely on us
[1:27:46] who draw that
[1:27:55] who draw that
[1:28:00] when the twelve spies went into the land
[1:28:03] they say in our own eyes we like
[1:28:06] grasshoppers
[1:28:07] it's a giant who draw that
[1:28:14] in their own eyes this they
[1:28:18] oh they dismodify themselves
[1:28:21] i know another word they belittle
[1:28:24] themselves
[1:28:26] they bring the self to grasshoppers
[1:28:31] it's not the temptation is the issue is
[1:28:33] that
[1:28:36] is the power because if you recognize
[1:28:40] you have access to that
[1:28:42] and you focus on that you walk on top

[1:28:55] ghost don't come with that
[1:28:57] don't tell me you can't do that we have
[1:28:58] a lot of things we could do
[1:29:01] even without the holy ghost they had joy
[1:29:03] without the holy ghost
[1:29:04] they were praising god without the holy
[1:29:06] ghost they were worshiping with all the
[1:29:07] holy ghost
[1:29:08] come on now they were standing for the
[1:29:10] world without the holy ghost but the
[1:29:11] holy ghost was coming
[1:29:13] oh give the lord some glory
[1:29:18] now watch voice of the throne voice of
[1:29:21] the stars voices there was more in
[1:29:23] version four here five
[1:29:25] out of the two and proceeded light and
[1:29:26] turn the voices not one voice voices
[1:29:28] what was it god speaking to the church
[1:29:32] reflecting himself through the seven
[1:29:34] spirits
[1:29:36] when the true anointing of god speaks
[1:29:38] it's the voice of god
[1:29:39] to reject it is to remove the
[1:29:41] candlesticks see voices the voice of the
[1:29:43] seven church edges
[1:29:44] over here in the corner the voices
[1:29:46] speaking with ton and lightning
[1:29:48] nowadays they say oh we don't believe in
[1:29:50] seeing hell in the pulpit oh mercy
[1:29:52] we need men of god men who won't hold
[1:29:54] back now everybody can't be a preacher
[1:29:57] but you got a voice and if you can't
[1:30:00] preach the people assuming
[1:30:02] he said if you're a preacher you're
[1:30:04] called to the pulpit to preach
[1:30:05] if you are not you're still a preacher
[1:30:07] so all of you here today we are
[1:30:09] preachers
[1:30:10] all you're a preacher all right
[1:30:14] watch if you're not you're still a
[1:30:16] preacher but live the people of sermon
[1:30:19] let your sermon be lived and it's the
[1:30:21] voice of god
[1:30:23] wait a minute a live sermon is a voice
[1:30:29] a torx man is stuck
[1:30:34] it's the written word but is not yet the
[1:30:37] living word
[1:30:38] until until it lives and that becomes
[1:30:42] the voice
[1:30:46] so speaking spoken word a written word
[1:30:51] living word when it comes into your
[1:30:53] faith and your flesh
[1:30:55] then the word is living hallelujah
[1:30:59] praise god it was beautiful in the bible
[1:31:02] study last
[1:31:03] but isaac brought out that joseph
[1:31:05] himself didn't understand
[1:31:08] the trajectory of his life in egypt
[1:31:11] just dictating the grain history of
[1:31:14] pharaoh so he thought
[1:31:17] he was blessed to be in the managerial
[1:31:18] ceo position
[1:31:20] to be assistant to pharaoh to run the
[1:31:23] show
[1:31:24] but when his brothers came he recognized
[1:31:26] it was a little more than that
[1:31:28] that all this brain storing stuff is to
[1:31:32] preserve his family's life
[1:31:34] that god have seen on the earth so all
[1:31:36] the trial and testing you go through
[1:31:39] you don't know god has been in labor
[1:31:41] pain for you
[1:31:42] what stuff you're talking about god
[1:31:45] was in labor pains when he was bringing
[1:31:48] you forward
[1:31:52] that's why i have confidence that you're
[1:31:54] gonna make it
[1:31:57] i have confidence that we're not
[1:31:59] preaching in vain
[1:32:00] and the word going on there's nothing
[1:32:02] there glory to god

[1:33:06] oh my hallelujah hallelujah
[1:33:10] hallelujah glory to god

[1:33:16] something for joseph

[1:52:22] when he takes your word what you are let
[1:52:25] me back up a little bit

[1:53:06] everybody will know you got it

[1:53:13] itself he god
[1:53:16] will let it be known among men
[1:53:20] not even you he will point you out
[1:53:24] this is my son you know
[1:53:26] [Music]
[1:53:27] [Applause]
[1:53:33] i escaped
[1:53:41] let me just one or two things i'll just
[1:53:43] wrap up here
[1:53:44] god's person if god acted any one time
[1:53:48] on a certain circumstance
[1:53:49] if that same circumstance arises again
[1:53:51] he's got to act the same way
[1:53:53] god's behavior is his person
[1:53:57] what he is in his behavior declares his
[1:54:00] person
[1:54:02] that's why the holy ghost can't be
[1:54:03] behaving one person and misbehaving
[1:54:05] another person
[1:54:06] because god's behavior is his person
[1:54:10] so when we talk about the person of
[1:54:11] christ we're talking about christ's
[1:54:13] own behavior in that person
[1:54:17] oh hallelujah thank you lord jesus
[1:54:20] all right i want to skip all of that
[1:54:24] noah was a sign of deliverances people a
[1:54:26] sign of judgment to the lost world
[1:54:28] the very water that choked the world
[1:54:30] drawn the world was the only means of
[1:54:32] saving noah
[1:54:33] say something softly the only thing that
[1:54:34] could save him was the judgment
[1:54:36] the only thing i'll receive the church
[1:54:38] today
[1:54:39] is the judgment i'm closing here
[1:54:43] but i believe the church is beginning to
[1:54:45] hear the message beginning to understand
[1:54:47] we have got to lay in the presence of
[1:54:49] the sun we have got to be ripened
[1:54:52] our fate isn't ripe
[1:54:55] so you can have hate but your feet could
[1:54:57] be green your feet want to be mature
[1:54:59] your feet need to be ripened
[1:55:01] you said no we are hearing the message
[1:55:04] of god give us
[1:55:05] and seeing the signs that he showed us
[1:55:07] and proven it by the bible in here
[1:55:09] but how the church needs to lay in his
[1:55:11] presence to lay and stay in his presence
[1:55:14] he said till it tenders up you know gets
[1:55:16] sweet in the spirit
[1:55:18] so it can be done sometimes speaking a
[1:55:20] message you got to get harsh
[1:55:22] but when the church once gets it the
[1:55:24] elected is called and separated then in
[1:55:26] the presence of god
[1:55:27] i know it'll be something like that the
[1:55:30] people was there when it takes the
[1:55:31] rapture
[1:55:32] final quote i skipped a lot of stuff
[1:55:35] this morning
[1:55:36] he said well if jesus had to spend much
[1:55:39] time in prayer
[1:55:40] to stay in fellowship with the spirit
[1:55:43] that was in him
[1:55:45] how much more do you and i have to spend
[1:55:48] in prayer
[1:55:49] much time in prayer if you only knew
[1:55:52] what time in prayer meant sometimes when
[1:55:55] you were in prayer god changes
[1:55:57] the complete destination of different
[1:55:59] things
[1:56:00] that's going to happen this boy has
[1:56:03] close eyes
