[14:31] How great thou art. Psalms 118 [music]
[14:35] uh on verse 14 says, "The Lord is my
[14:37] strength and song and has become my
[14:42] salvation.
[14:43] The voice of rejoicing and salvation
[14:46] [music] is in the tabernacles of the
[14:48] righteous. The right hand of the Lord
[14:51] doeth valiantly. The right hand of the
[14:54] Lord is exalted. The right hand of the
[14:57] Lord doeth valiantly.
[14:59] I shall not die but live and declare the
[15:03] works of the Lord. [music]
[15:05] The Lord hath chastened me soul. But he
[15:08] had not given me over unto death.
[15:11] [music]
[15:12] Open to me the gates of righteousness,
[15:14] and I will go into them, and I will
[15:18] praise [music] the Lord. This gate of
[15:20] the Lord into which the righteous shall
[15:22] enter. I will praise thee for thou has
[15:26] heard me [music] and I become my
[15:28] salvation. The stone which the builders
[15:31] refused [music] is become the headstone
[15:33] of the corner. This is the Lord's doing
[15:36] and it is marvelous in our eyes. This is
[15:38] a day which the Lord had made and we
[15:40] will rejoice and be glad [music] in it.
[15:43] May God add blessing to the reading of
[15:45] his word. Let us bow our heads
[15:49] as we pray. Almighty God, we thank you

[16:37] pray that you have your own way, Father.
[16:38] We pray pray that you come down, Lord,
[16:41] and may you bless your people [music] as
[16:42] we sing songs of praise and worship
[16:45] tonight. As we, Lord, forget about

[16:49] behind us, [music] Lord. Stepping into
[16:51] the new year as it will, Lord, with a
[16:54] newness of life, Lord, with a [music] a

[34:07] mostly my son's testimony. So I would
[34:10] just read what it is he wanted to say
[34:14] and then I would you know add to it in
[34:17] that sense. So it is
[34:20] this is the the words of son Andrew. He
[34:25] recently got baptized and this is his
[34:28] testimony of
[34:31] the events leading up to
[34:34] his baptism and even afterwards. So it
[34:37] goes like this. Greetings Jesus name
[34:40] brothers and sisters. This is my little
[34:42] testimony of how the Lord spoke to my
[34:45] heart and helped me to make the decision
[34:48] to serve him.
[34:50] Coming to church as a young boy
[34:54] that's all it was at the time going to
[34:57] church. My parents always encouraged me
[35:00] to sit upstairs and listen to the
[35:02] service. Sometimes I did some other
[35:05] times not so much.
[35:08] Several services passed where I felt
[35:13] a strange feeling during and after the
[35:16] service that almost always brought me to
[35:19] tears.
[35:21] There was an altar call after service
[35:24] one Sunday and I felt an urge like God
[35:27] telling me to go up, but I was scared
[35:30] because I didn't know what was happening
[35:33] or how to react.
[35:36] I broke down in tears and explained this
[35:39] to my dad. He said, "That was God
[35:42] speaking to my heart." And when you get
[35:45] that feeling again, go up. Don't
[35:47] hesitate.
[35:49] My mom said, "If you want me to go with
[35:51] you, I will. Next time there was an
[35:53] alter call, I told mom I wanted to go up
[35:56] and she immediately went up with me."
[35:59] I had many experiences after that where
[36:02] I felt convicted and started to pray
[36:05] more.
[36:07] A few weeks after an outer call was made
[36:09] again. I was downstairs at the time and
[36:13] the thought came to me to get baptized
[36:16] before this year ends.
[36:18] To my surprise, I never thought about
[36:21] this because I already had it in my mind
[36:24] that I'm getting baptized at the age of
[36:26] 12 and I'm 11.
[36:29] I mentioned this to my mom. She said,
[36:31] "We'll speak to the ministry. We'll
[36:33] arrange it and whatnot." Before I knew
[36:35] it, I was in the office with brother
[36:36] Isaac and he had a little talk with me.
[36:40] After the meeting, my dad asked me how
[36:42] soon I wanted to get baptized. I didn't
[36:44] know, but then I realized the faster I
[36:47] got baptized, the better.
[36:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:50] &gt;&gt; So then I chose the following week, the
[36:53] following week. And yes, ever since
[36:56] then, the Lord has been leading me in my
[37:00] life, speaking to me when I'm not too
[37:04] sure about things or should not too sure
[37:09] about things I should or shouldn't do.
[37:12] This has also helped me to pray more and
[37:15] seek God's help. And he has always
[37:18] helped me. Little by little, I am
[37:21] understanding
[37:22] how to live this Christian life. That
[37:25] God has called me to live because I
[37:28] believe that he has a purpose for my
[37:31] life. And by his grace, I know he will
[37:34] keep me. I hope this small testimony
[37:37] will be an encouragement to you to keep
[37:40] pressing the battle. God bless you,
[37:42] Andrew Henry.
[37:45] [applause]
[37:49] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[37:51] &gt;&gt; So brothers and sisters, it is
[37:56] a a a wonderful feeling when speaking as
[38:00] a father,
[38:01] &gt;&gt; your children comes to the Lord,
[38:04] &gt;&gt; makes that decision to
[38:07] serve him. And
[38:10] sometimes as parents
[38:14] uh we might feel that we keep praying
[38:18] for our kids and you know things not
[38:21] really looking
[38:23] or shaping or going the way that we
[38:26] would want it to go. But I am here
[38:28] tonight just to encourage you all that
[38:31] continue praying for your children.
[38:33] continue covering your family,
[38:36] your spouse, everyone with the blood
[38:38] because you don't know when God will
[38:42] actually speak to their heart and turn
[38:44] things around.
[38:46] Continue. Don't give up. God is awesome.
[38:50] He promised that he will bring all our
[38:55] children, those who we love. And if we
[39:00] give up now, then
[39:03] I mean our prayers won't fall to the
[39:06] ground. But as parents, as guardians, as
[39:09] stewards, we are entrusted
[39:12] to keep lifting them up. Lift keep
[39:17] covering them with the blood.
[39:18] &gt;&gt; You understand? Because at the end of it
[39:20] all, we have to give account for our
[39:22] children what it is we do for them. So,
[39:24] I didn't really want to stay too long,
[39:26] but I just wanted to share this and
[39:28] encourage you all that God is real. He
[39:30] is still working among the lives of our
[39:33] young people and keep holding on. All
[39:36] right. God bless you.

[40:36] God blessings.
[40:39] Uh
[40:41] before I see this testimony, I just like
[40:43] to read two portions of scripture
[40:46] please.
[40:49] Taken from book of Acts
[40:56] 1
[40:58] from verse 10 and 11.
[41:03] And while they looked steadfastly
[41:07] towards heaven,
[41:09] as he went up,
[41:17] as he went up, behold, two men stood by
[41:21] him in white apparel,
[41:24] which also said, "Ye men of Galilee,
[41:30] why stand the
[41:33] gay gazing up into heaven.
[41:36] The same Jesus
[41:39] who is taken up from you into heaven
[41:44] &gt;&gt; shall so come in like manner as ye have
[41:50] seen him go into heaven.
[41:54] &gt;&gt; Next scripture is 1 John 3.
[42:01] Behold,
[42:04] what manner of love the Father had shown
[42:07] upon us,
[42:09] that we should be called the sons of
[42:11] God. Therefore, the world knoweth us
[42:17] not,
[42:18] because it knew him not. Beloved,
[42:24] now are we the sons of God, and it does
[42:29] not yet appear what we shall be, but we
[42:34] know
[42:35] that when he shall appear,
[42:38] we shall be like him.
[42:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. For we shall see him as he is.
[42:46] And every man
[42:48] that had this hope in him purified
[42:51] himself even as he is pure.
[43:03] uh take these two scriptures because at
[43:06] the end of it
[43:09] um all glory have to be to Jesus Christ.
[43:14] some months ago.
[43:17] I
[43:20] I I normally call my testings tri um and
[43:26] trials training.
[43:29] So some months ago
[43:31] I end up in hospital.
[43:35] Now I was home
[43:39] and
[43:40] I got up, went to the bathroom.
[43:44] I knew I went to the bathroom
[43:48] and the next thing I was conscious of is
[43:53] I find myself waking up between my
[43:56] bathtub
[43:58] and the toilet bowl and I want to know
[44:01] well what really happened here. I know I
[44:05] went to the and that's now I find myself
[44:07] waking up. So I got up. I know. I got up
[44:14] and the next thing you know
[44:20] I was conscious that my face on the
[44:23] ground
[44:25] and like a drooling
[44:28] and a fighting to breathe. And I say but
[44:32] what it is happening here?
[44:36] Now the first thing you know the devil
[44:37] has tried to give you a kind of thing
[44:39] where they going on dead and all them
[44:40] kind of thing but saints no fear came at
[44:44] that point in time no fear
[44:47] and I started to say Lord what is
[44:49] happening here God help me God fighting
[44:52] to breed
[44:53] a car breed I said well look let me come
[44:57] out because it's a master bedroom so
[45:00] from the toilet to go back into the so I
[45:03] said well let me try and see if I could
[45:04] get to the phone.
[45:06] I realized I can move
[45:09] hard to move. And I started to try to
[45:12] crawl from just the bathroom. I couldn't
[45:17] even reach the door. I I said, I don't
[45:20] know what happened me.
[45:23] And the next thing you know, I don't
[45:25] know how long I was on the ground. I
[45:27] don't know what happened,
[45:29] but maybe all I recognized after it was
[45:33] brother Popwell in [clears throat]
[45:36] the house in upstairs
[45:40] in the bathroom talking to me. Now, it
[45:45] was a strange thing because
[45:49] all my all my gates lock up mean my
[45:53] house.
[45:55] So
[45:56] he had to climb the gate to come
[46:00] upstairs, go over a banister
[46:04] and enter my bedroom and then come in.
[46:06] Now I maybe he could tell you I don't
[46:10] know why he came [laughter]
[46:14] because it's a Sunday and normally I
[46:16] know brother Pel in service
[46:19] and at the end of it
[46:22] brother Poppel called the ambulance he
[46:24] prayed and I fighting to breathe and I
[46:28] can't I don't know what happening
[46:30] because I don't know what happening now
[46:34] when you look back at it. I realized
[46:38] that
[46:40] his steps were ordered.
[46:44] &gt;&gt; You understand? He didn't just come by
[46:46] chance.
[46:47] That was ordered steps that come. I went
[46:52] to the I was taken to the hospital
[46:55] and fighting for bread. They end up
[46:57] telling me that you know something with
[46:59] my heart. I don't have no heart. No, I
[47:01] have no heart problem. You understand?
[47:04] So at the end of it they inject me and
[47:09] they had us to strap me down because I
[47:11] fighted to breathe and they telling me
[47:14] you know relax. How you going to relax
[47:16] and you can't breathe? It don't make
[47:18] sense.
[47:20] So here was I fighting to breathe. They
[47:24] eventually well whatever injection the
[47:27] thing this they start a thing and
[47:31] before I know it well brother papel was
[47:33] with me in the you know he was in the
[47:35] hospital
[47:37] and
[47:39] some of my children came and then the
[47:42] next thing you know I two of my
[47:44] daughters who live in Tobago
[47:48] I see them appear now I don't know it
[47:51] appears that well brother
[47:54] called them immediately.
[47:56] Now I don't know how they reach down so
[47:58] fast because during the um Christmas
[48:03] season it's difficult to get uh aircraft
[48:07] to come down to Trinidad but both of
[48:10] them was downhill and they came in
[48:15] one of them well you know she's in uh
[48:18] you know in the uh medical field she
[48:22] came in check talked to me And the next
[48:27] thing you know at the end of it they end
[48:31] up putting me in a certain ward to eat
[48:35] and then the rest of the children was
[48:38] there. So it take me about two weeks I
[48:41] was in the hospital
[48:44] and at the end of it I said I look back
[48:47] at the
[48:49] I look back at this I just say training
[48:54] and I wanted to know well Lord what is
[48:56] happening what why can't figure out now
[49:00] but I in respect in in in going back to
[49:04] all these things I realized that
[49:08] during my lifetime is about about four
[49:11] or five times
[49:13] Satan tried to kill me.
[49:16] I thought I was gone but it at times I I
[49:20] remember distinct um
[49:24] I thought I was drowning. I I was with
[49:26] some brethren and I was under the water
[49:29] for a while and I it is a strange thing.
[49:34] I was conscious under the water
[49:37] conscious that
[49:40] a day a long time
[49:42] but I am fully conscious and I thinking
[49:46] well this wave is dead or something and
[49:49] when I did come up because that wave end
[49:51] up pushing me up the brother was
[49:54] panicking and they want to know well how
[49:56] can I stay and I and all don't know so
[50:01] is a few times the devil tried to take
[50:03] me No, he can't.
[50:06] &gt;&gt; He just can't,
[50:08] &gt;&gt; you know. And when I look back,
[50:10] especially for this last
[50:12] um occasion here
[50:16] after
[50:18] coming out of the hospital,
[50:21] you know, I'll say um
[50:24] my one of my daughters, that's Chanel.
[50:27] Um
[50:29] I don't know what I don't know if it's a
[50:30] conspiracy. I don't want to say it's an
[50:32] arrangement she she probably made with
[50:35] the doctor because
[50:37] the day she came the sometimes after
[50:40] because she stayed here she said daddy
[50:43] um
[50:44] you will you'll be be you are being
[50:46] discharged to the I say okay no problem
[50:51] she came
[50:53] change my clothes she take the pillow
[50:54] everything
[50:56] and she jump in she was driving jump in
[51:00] the
[51:02] She came straight down the highway.
[51:05] She passed Mosa road.
[51:09] She passed Maloney.
[51:13] She passed Pia Junction. So I said,
[51:17] "What are you going?" She said, "Relax
[51:19] yourself. Relax yourself."
[51:21] She drive me straight on a boat and it's
[51:24] the big where I was.
[51:26] I I I don't know how that fix
[51:29] now.
[51:30] You know when I look at it I say boy
[51:34] like these people kidnapped me here like
[51:37] you know but you know there's a syndrome
[51:40] I can't quite remember the there's a
[51:43] syndrome where the kidnappy
[51:46] just fall in love with the kidnapper
[51:49] and I am saying I fell more in love with
[51:52] my kidnappers
[51:53] you understand and I I I could be
[51:56] kidnapped by them anytime you know
[51:59] during that period I I couldn't I was a
[52:04] bit taken back because I couldn't
[52:07] understand
[52:10] where and when I give up my authority
[52:14] because I thought I was the parent but I
[52:19] realized it was taken away from me and I
[52:23] have to do what they say.
[52:26] So I just had to be obedient
[52:30] you know and it take me a while to take
[52:32] me some months but I say all this to say
[52:35] that God is the one who control all this
[52:41] thing.
[52:43] Now many times we have troubles as far
[52:46] as I concerned that was a trouble that
[52:48] came and many time we have troubles
[52:52] cancer wherever wherever trouble but our
[52:55] prophet taught us that God
[52:59] he put a bit in troubled mouth
[53:02] &gt;&gt; you know what is a bit is something to
[53:05] control a horse
[53:07] &gt;&gt; pull it here
[53:08] &gt;&gt; so any trouble that you come is not a
[53:10] runaway trouble
[53:12] &gt;&gt; it is a controlled trouble. Always
[53:15] remember that
[53:16] &gt;&gt; these are the things that help me
[53:19] &gt;&gt; to to survive and to come up because
[53:22] when I realize that hey this is a
[53:24] control trouble. So sit on the highway
[53:28] in the first place. He do not have the
[53:32] keys of hell and death because that was
[53:33] the trump card debt.
[53:36] &gt;&gt; But he no longer have the keys of hell
[53:37] and death
[53:39] &gt;&gt; and all the bars. You know sometime you
[53:42] you you find yourself in a trouble and
[53:45] things happening to you and like you b
[53:47] you know like you have bars you know
[53:49] like a gate you cage up
[53:54] &gt;&gt; push the gate
[53:56] &gt;&gt; it don't have no key it don't have no
[53:59] lock be lying [applause and cheering]
[54:02] &gt;&gt; understand what I say now you see we and
[54:05] this is why I say I look at all my thing
[54:08] as a training
[54:10] Because the devil have been pushing us
[54:13] so long that we we have that fear.
[54:17] &gt;&gt; But the thing is we have to say what the
[54:19] word says. Stick with what the word say.
[54:21] The word say listen to me
[54:24] &gt;&gt; first to begin. He don't have no keys.
[54:27] &gt;&gt; He's a liar.
[54:29] &gt;&gt; Two trouble is controlled.
[54:34] &gt;&gt; So whatever happening with you at this
[54:36] point in time it is controlled. Amen.
[54:39] &gt;&gt; It is not run away. Sometime we think
[54:41] well, oh God, this thing going to kill
[54:42] me. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[54:46] &gt;&gt; God just testing for reaction.
[54:49] &gt;&gt; He testing to see how he will behave.
[54:52] &gt;&gt; How you will adapt.
[54:54] &gt;&gt; You understand what I'm saying? First
[54:56] again remember not only he don't have no
[55:02] keys and hell and death. Remember our
[55:04] prophet taught us that listen there is a
[55:08] time that is here and coming.
[55:11] &gt;&gt; We will stop cancer.
[55:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:13] &gt;&gt; We will stop diseases.
[55:16] &gt;&gt; Now if we have to stop it then he can't
[55:19] really have no real authority over it.
[55:22] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[55:23] &gt;&gt; He lying. Yeah,
[55:25] &gt;&gt; he just using effects and and and using
[55:28] the five senses and trying to make make
[55:32] that but he lying because we have to
[55:34] stop that
[55:38] &gt;&gt; and once we have to stop it then it
[55:40] means then we have control over it for
[55:44] so he lying. So I want you to understand
[55:47] that regardless of what happening to
[55:50] you,
[55:50] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[55:51] &gt;&gt; remember
[55:54] he is a liar, remember who you are.
[55:58] &gt;&gt; You understand? Remember not only is is
[56:01] is that is that um
[56:05] he he he he don't have keys at hella
[56:08] debt or uh we have to stop cancer.
[56:13] Remember we are we are sons and
[56:17] daughters of God that a promise is made
[56:19] to us.
[56:20] &gt;&gt; I believe this message.
[56:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:23] &gt;&gt; You know we had to understand that this
[56:25] message is real.
[56:28] &gt;&gt; You know sometime we we people go to
[56:30] church for years. You understand? You go
[56:34] to church for years. Please no. This is
[56:37] not church thing. Is God trying to bring
[56:40] his children, his sons and daughters to
[56:42] recognize who they are? All right. And
[56:45] just think about it. Who do you say this
[56:49] message is?
[56:51] &gt;&gt; Not what,
[56:54] but who do you say this message is?
[56:58] &gt;&gt; This message is not just talk. No, no,
[57:01] no.
[57:02] &gt;&gt; When you get the answer to who you say
[57:04] this message is, you're going to know
[57:06] who you are.
[57:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because I'll give you a little
[57:09] hint. The whole family in heaven and the
[57:12] whole family on earth named Jesus
[57:15] Christ.

[59:21] No turning back. Oh, no turning
[59:25] [music and singing] back. One more time.
[59:27] Well, I have decided

[59:45] No [singing] turning back.
[59:48] [music] No turning back.
[59:54] Oh Lord.
[59:57] Amen. God bless you. You may have a
[59:59] seat. Amen.
[1:00:31] Lord, you know [singing]
[1:00:33] I need [music] a brand new touch.
[1:00:37] [singing]
[1:00:39] My [music] strength from yesterday
[1:00:42] is gone. [singing]
[1:00:48] But [music] if you give me Lord, I'm not
[1:00:51] [singing] attached.
[1:00:54] [music]
[1:00:56] I'll have the strength to carry on.
[1:01:00] [singing and music]
[1:01:04] Yesterday has
[1:01:06] come and gone, [singing]
[1:01:11] [music]
[1:01:11] and now [singing] a new day is coming.
[1:01:15] on.
[1:01:17] [singing]
[1:01:19] I do not know what it may bring.
[1:01:27] My [singing] heart may cry instead
[1:01:30] [music] of sing.
[1:01:35] It [singing] matters not what comes
[1:01:38] [music] my way. Lord,
[1:01:43] if [singing and music] you just touch
[1:01:45] me, you'll betray.
[1:01:48] [music]
[1:01:50] Your loving [singing] touches all my
[1:01:54] tears away.
[1:01:58] [music] Close by your side. [singing] I
[1:02:01] want to stay.
[1:02:06] &gt;&gt; Lord, you [singing] know I need a brand
[1:02:10] new touch.
[1:02:12] [singing]
[1:02:13] [music]
[1:02:14] My strength from yesterday
[1:02:17] is gone.
[1:02:19] [singing]
[1:02:20] [music]
[1:02:22] But if you give me Lord another touch,
[1:02:27] [singing]
[1:02:29] I'll have the strength to carry on.
[1:02:37] I thought the sun had come to stay,
[1:02:40] [singing]
[1:02:44] but not too soon [singing] it went
[1:02:47] [music] away.
[1:02:50] came
[1:02:52] and in its place the storm clouds came.
[1:02:56] [singing]
[1:02:59] Then with the clouds [singing] there
[1:03:02] came the [music] rain.
[1:03:07] [singing] It rained so hard it all so
[1:03:10] long.
[1:03:13] [singing]
[1:03:14] I missed the storm. I felt a calm.
[1:03:21] [music]
[1:03:22] It [singing] was your touch that brought
[1:03:25] me through it all.
[1:03:29] [music] Without your [singing] help,
[1:03:31] I'll surely fall.
[1:03:37] [music] Lord, [singing] you know I need
[1:03:40] a brand new touch.
[1:03:44] My [singing] strength from yesterday
[1:03:47] is gone.
[1:03:52] But if [singing and music] you give me
[1:03:54] Lord another touch,
[1:03:59] [singing] I'll have the strength to
[1:04:02] carry on.
[1:04:06] &gt;&gt; [music]
[1:04:07] &gt;&gt; Lord, you know how weak [singing] I
[1:04:10] really am.
[1:04:14] [music]
[1:04:15] Even [singing] better than myself.
[1:04:22] But [singing] with your help, I know I
[1:04:25] really can [music]
[1:04:29] make it through [singing] the darkest
[1:04:31] night.
[1:04:33] Everything's going to be all right.
[1:04:41] Lord, [singing] you know I need a brand
[1:04:44] new time.
[1:04:47] [singing]
[1:04:48] &gt;&gt; My strength from yesterday [music]
[1:04:51] is gone.
[1:04:56] But if [singing and music] you give me
[1:04:58] Lord another touch,
[1:05:03] [music] I'll have the [singing] strength
[1:05:05] to carry on.
[1:05:08] Won't you touch me, Lord? Give [music]
[1:05:11] me the strength to carry [singing] on.
[1:05:14] &gt;&gt; I need your touch, Lord. [music]
[1:05:18] I need your strength [singing] to carry.
[1:05:24] Oh. [singing]
[1:05:28] [music]
[1:05:30] [singing]

[1:05:40] Amen. You appreciate it tonight. Give
[1:05:42] the Lord a shout of praise. Hallelujah.
[1:05:44] How many want a brand new touch tonight?
[1:05:48] Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. Glory to
[1:05:51] God. Oh, he can give that to you
[1:05:53] tonight. Amen. He's here to touch you
[1:05:56] tonight that you'll never be the same.
[1:05:59] [music] How many appreciate the sisters
[1:06:01] tonight? God bless you, Sister Pton. God
[1:06:03] bless you, Sister J. Thank you so much
[1:06:05] for that special. [applause and music]
[1:06:07] Amen. As you get ready for the spirit of
[1:06:09] change in the order of this service, we
[1:06:11] bow down and worship Yahweh. Amen. I
[1:06:15] feel like singing that tonight. Let's
[1:06:16] lift our hands and worship God tonight.
[1:06:18] [music]
[1:06:19] He is the greater I am, the way, the
[1:06:21] truth. He's the life tonight. [music] He
[1:06:24] is Jehovah.

[1:08:36] Give him all the glory for Yah. [music]
[1:08:41] [singing]
[1:08:47] &gt;&gt; [singing and music]
[1:08:49] &gt;&gt; One more time worship.
[1:08:55] [music]
[1:08:58] [singing]
[1:09:00] [music]
[1:09:04] Hallelujah. Yes.
[1:09:07] [music]
[1:09:14] [music]
[1:09:14] [singing]
[1:09:16] Yeah.
[1:09:21] Heat.
[1:09:24] [music]
[1:09:29] [singing and music]
[1:09:33] Hallelujah. [singing]
[1:09:36] [music]
[1:09:40] Hallelujah.
[1:09:42] [music]
[1:09:49] [music]
[1:09:54] We bless your name Lord and before us
[1:09:56] Lord. May your presence come renewed
[1:09:59] Lord among your people. Pour out your
[1:10:01] spirit. The latter [music] raining the
[1:10:03] dynamics of the mechanics. Granted God
[1:10:06] in Jesus name we ask it. Amen. And God
[1:10:08] bless you. [music]
[1:10:10] I don't know what to say but the
[1:10:12] atmosphere. Thanks [music] for the
[1:10:14] special testimonies.
[1:10:16] Very encouraging. So I believe I'll go
[1:10:19] straight to the word. Time is ticking on
[1:10:20] us. Genesis chapter 26, we want to read
[1:10:24] verse 1-6 and 12-4,
[1:10:26] Ecclesiastes 11, reading 4-6 and Acts 18
[1:10:32] for scripture reading this night.
[1:10:35] &gt;&gt; Reading Genesis 26, and there was a
[1:10:37] famine in the land
[1:10:39] &gt;&gt; besides the first famine that was in the
[1:10:42] days of Abraham.
[1:10:44] And Isaac went unto Aimilec, king of the
[1:10:46] Philistines, unto Jira.
[1:10:49] And the Lord appeared unto him, and
[1:10:50] said, "Go not down unto Egypt. Dwell in
[1:10:53] the land which I shall tell thee of.
[1:10:56] Sojourn in this land, and I will be with
[1:10:58] thee, and will bless thee. For unto
[1:11:00] thee, and unto thy seed I will give all
[1:11:02] these countries,
[1:11:04] &gt;&gt; and I will perform my oath, which I
[1:11:06] swear unto Abraham thy father,
[1:11:09] &gt;&gt; and I will make thy seed to multiply as
[1:11:11] the stars of the heaven. I will give
[1:11:12] unto thy seed all these countries and in
[1:11:15] thy seed shall all the nations of the
[1:11:17] earth be blessed because that that
[1:11:20] Abraham obeyed my voice and kept my
[1:11:24] charge, my commandments, my statutes,
[1:11:26] and my laws. And Isaac dwelt in Jira.
[1:11:30] Verse 12.
[1:11:35] Then Isaac sowed in that land and
[1:11:38] received
[1:11:40] in the same year a hundfold.
[1:11:43] &gt;&gt; And the Lord blessed him.
[1:11:46] &gt;&gt; And the man waxed great and went forward
[1:11:49] and grew until he became very great.
[1:11:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:53] &gt;&gt; For he had possessions of flocks,
[1:11:56] possessions of herds, and a great store
[1:11:58] of servants. And the Philistines envied
[1:12:01] him. Ecclesiastes chapter 11 reading
[1:12:05] from verse 4.
[1:12:07] He that observeth the wind shall not
[1:12:09] sow,
[1:12:11] and he that regardeth the clouds shall
[1:12:13] not reap. For thou knowest not what is
[1:12:16] in the way of the spirit, nor how the
[1:12:19] bones do grow in the womb of her that is
[1:12:22] with child. Even so thou knowest not the
[1:12:25] works of God who make it all. In the
[1:12:29] morning sow thy seed, and in the evening
[1:12:32] withhold not thine hand, for thou
[1:12:35] knowest not whether shall prosper either
[1:12:38] this or that, or whether they be shall
[1:12:40] be alike or good. Last scripture, Acts
[1:12:43] 18. But he shall receive power
[1:12:46] &gt;&gt; after that the Holy Ghost has come upon
[1:12:48] you
[1:12:49] &gt;&gt; and you shall be witnesses unto me both
[1:12:51] in Jerusalem and in all Judea, in
[1:12:53] Samaria, and in the uttermost part of
[1:12:55] the earth. Let's pray. Father, we thank
[1:12:56] you for your word. We thank you for the
[1:12:58] testimonies, the specials, the singing,
[1:13:00] the worship, the atmosphere and your
[1:13:02] people gathered here. Father, we pray as
[1:13:04] your blessing come down tonight that you
[1:13:06] would forgive their past and bless their
[1:13:08] future. I pray dear God that this will
[1:13:10] be a special year being birthed Lord
[1:13:13] that we will see the dynamics in the
[1:13:14] mechanics
[1:13:15] &gt;&gt; and the letter rain spirit of the
[1:13:17] promise to Paul upon the bride seed
[1:13:19] &gt;&gt; and the secret is the word is in that
[1:13:21] bride.
[1:13:22] &gt;&gt; You have we have been seated on for
[1:13:24] years waiting upon God. Father God, come
[1:13:27] down tonight and confirm your word with
[1:13:29] signs, wonders, and miracles. We await
[1:13:32] you in Jesus name we ask it. Amen. You
[1:13:34] will be seated. As you sit down, give
[1:13:36] the Lord a shout of praise of worship
[1:13:38] unto God.
[1:13:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:46] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:13:48] My God. We are nearer than when we first
[1:13:50] believe.
[1:13:51] &gt;&gt; Be narrower when we first believe. You
[1:13:53] have been holding for all these years.
[1:13:55] But one day the God that made that
[1:13:57] promise will fulfill that promise
[1:13:59] &gt;&gt; in your life, in your heart, in your
[1:14:00] mind, among your family, in your own
[1:14:02] body.
[1:14:03] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise. We were already blessed on
[1:14:05] Sunday with the message.
[1:14:07] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord. [applause]
[1:14:12] And God said in Micah uh um Malachi
[1:14:15] rather, I love thee and you say, I have
[1:14:17] not loved thee. But as I brought it out
[1:14:19] so tremendous, God showed in answering
[1:14:22] about love, he said, "Let me show you
[1:14:24] what hate looks like."
[1:14:26] &gt;&gt; And the opposite of hate is love.
[1:14:28] &gt;&gt; If I hated you, I was going to show you
[1:14:30] how I'm going to treat you. But I want
[1:14:32] to bring a scripture just to fall in
[1:14:34] line with that. It's from Proverbs
[1:14:35] chapter 6 verse 16 says, "And six things
[1:14:38] that God hate.
[1:14:42] &gt;&gt; Seven is an abomination to him. One, a
[1:14:45] proud look,
[1:14:47] a lying tongue,
[1:14:49] &gt;&gt; hands that shed innocent blood,
[1:14:51] &gt;&gt; a heart that devisth wicked
[1:14:53] imaginations, feet that be swift in
[1:14:56] running mischief, a false witness that
[1:14:59] speaketh lies,
[1:15:00] &gt;&gt; and he that sweth discord, watch that
[1:15:02] one now,
[1:15:03] &gt;&gt; among brethren. God hate that.
[1:15:06] &gt;&gt; If you want God to hate you,
[1:15:09] &gt;&gt; this is things that God hate.
[1:15:11] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the name of the Lord. All
[1:15:13] right, let's go.
[1:15:14] So the prophet said there'll be form and
[1:15:16] latter rain and in the latter rain will
[1:15:18] both be form and latter rain together.
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; A great church universal that would
[1:15:23] sweep from one side to the other of the
[1:15:25] world. A great message, great signs and
[1:15:28] wonders would be accomplished by this
[1:15:30] church.
[1:15:31] &gt;&gt; Daniel said the people that know their
[1:15:32] God shall do great exploits.
[1:15:34] &gt;&gt; So we can't leave here dry.
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; We can't leave here dead. We can't leave
[1:15:38] here like an ordinary church. If this is
[1:15:41] what the Bible said, the people that
[1:15:43] know their God shall do great exploits.
[1:15:46] That must happen because one thing we
[1:15:48] know that God can't do, he can't lie.
[1:15:51] &gt;&gt; If God said that, he said that
[1:15:53] &gt;&gt; and he means that. A good reading is a
[1:15:55] Lord of praises.
[1:15:56] &gt;&gt; The title tonight is under the power of
[1:15:59] the spirit. Amen. That's the title.
[1:16:01] Under the power of the spirit and have
[1:16:03] an inspiration, the latter rain. Amen.
[1:16:04] Praise God. So the latter rain, you're
[1:16:07] talking about Sarah. When Sarah when the
[1:16:09] Abra when the Elohim came to visit
[1:16:11] Sarah, he said, "I'm going to visit you
[1:16:13] according to the time of life.
[1:16:15] &gt;&gt; And you're going to have that baby that
[1:16:17] you're waiting on. The latter rain is
[1:16:19] fixing to fall. You have held that seed
[1:16:22] in there long enough now. Believe him.
[1:16:24] But we are looking for a coming son. He
[1:16:26] is coming."
[1:16:27] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God. They're trying to
[1:16:29] manufacture a latter rain. Nonsense. The
[1:16:31] latter rain will sweep the world. Praise
[1:16:34] God. Then you will see what the rain
[1:16:35] produces. There'll be an affiliation and
[1:16:38] the groups will come together and they
[1:16:40] will shut the doors of those guys that
[1:16:42] wouldn't listen to it and you won't be
[1:16:43] able to open your mouth and then he will
[1:16:46] come.
[1:16:47] &gt;&gt; That is when you will see a rain just
[1:16:49] lay still and be quiet.
[1:16:51] &gt;&gt; Let it go.
[1:16:52] &gt;&gt; In other words, shut up. Keep quiet.
[1:16:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. When your rain come, your
[1:16:56] rain come.
[1:16:57] &gt;&gt; And nobody can stop your rain.
[1:16:59] &gt;&gt; You can't stop the rain. What you have
[1:17:01] to make sure is what seed is inside of
[1:17:03] you. And once you have the right seed
[1:17:05] inside of you, the rain will produce
[1:17:07] itself.
[1:17:08] &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? Praise God. Praise
[1:17:10] God. So then the latter rain can only
[1:17:13] come after the teaching rain.
[1:17:15] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:17:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:16] &gt;&gt; So I read a very strange scripture
[1:17:18] tonight speaking about famine in the
[1:17:20] land
[1:17:21] &gt;&gt; where Isaac went into this land. And God
[1:17:24] told Isaac to sjourn day and I'll bless
[1:17:27] you.
[1:17:28] &gt;&gt; And guess what? Isaac obeyed. The key
[1:17:31] here is watch Isaac's obedience.
[1:17:34] &gt;&gt; God reminded him that his father Abraham
[1:17:38] kept the word,
[1:17:40] &gt;&gt; kept the commandments.
[1:17:41] &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? But the part I want to
[1:17:42] get to is that Isaac swed in that land
[1:17:46] and received in the same year 100fold
[1:17:50] &gt;&gt; and the Lord blessed him.
[1:17:52] &gt;&gt; Isaac swed in a time of famine.
[1:17:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:00] Praise God.
[1:18:01] &gt;&gt; What was the next chapter we read? Let
[1:18:03] me just get it here quickly.
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:11] &gt;&gt; He that observeth the wind shall not
[1:18:14] sow.
[1:18:16] &gt;&gt; He that regardeth the clouds shall not
[1:18:18] weep. So what is he saying there? You
[1:18:20] don't have to wait for the conditions to
[1:18:23] be favorable
[1:18:26] &gt;&gt; to find favor with God.
[1:18:28] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[1:18:31] &gt;&gt; Now, I like this seed reference because
[1:18:34] it takes God to produce a crop.
[1:18:37] &gt;&gt; Man not making the seeds grow. Not God
[1:18:40] to do that.
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; So, Isaac didn't just operate on a level
[1:18:43] of faith, but it shows that heaven
[1:18:46] honored his faith.
[1:18:49] &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord some praises.
[1:18:52] &gt;&gt; And I want you to see that is how you
[1:18:53] have to be for 2026. Yes.
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; You're not looking for everything to be
[1:18:57] fine. You look everything and to be in
[1:19:00] order. All the clouds in place and the
[1:19:02] this in place. Forget all about that.
[1:19:04] &gt;&gt; Put whatever you got. Put your hands
[1:19:06] with Put your hands and sew. Put your
[1:19:08] hands and press whatever you want to do.
[1:19:11] Do it. [applause]
[1:19:14] God can't bless what you have not done.
[1:19:17] [cheering]
[1:19:18] &gt;&gt; Give the Lord a shout. [screaming]
[1:19:20] Give the Lord some praises. Hallelujah.
[1:19:23] God can't bless emptiness.
[1:19:28] &gt;&gt; God can't multiply what you don't have.
[1:19:31] &gt;&gt; He have to take what you have
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; and multiply it. Oh, give the Lord some
[1:19:36] praises.
[1:19:37] [applause]
[1:19:39] &gt;&gt; So, I want to bring a faith attention to
[1:19:41] you,
[1:19:42] &gt;&gt; a picture in your mind and heart what
[1:19:45] you have to do.
[1:19:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Come like somebody praying
[1:19:50] to God, praying for God for a blessing
[1:19:52] and they have no cup to get it.
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; They have no vessel to receive. God,
[1:19:55] bless me, Lord. Bless me, Lord. Where's
[1:19:57] the room for it? God say, "Where to pour
[1:19:59] it?" Um, you clear your throat. You
[1:20:02] ain't ready for no blessing yet.
[1:20:05] &gt;&gt; If you want a better job, you have to
[1:20:07] get better skills
[1:20:08] &gt;&gt; or get more education to get a better
[1:20:10] job.
[1:20:10] &gt;&gt; I want a better job, more pay, more pay,
[1:20:12] more pay, more pay.
[1:20:16] &gt;&gt; God will bless your effort in studies.
[1:20:19] for you to get the qualifications, get a
[1:20:20] better job and get a better pay.
[1:20:23] &gt;&gt; God will bless your effort to get the
[1:20:25] skills
[1:20:26] &gt;&gt; to get a better job to get a better pay.
[1:20:28] &gt;&gt; God blessing you sitting at home say pay
[1:20:30] pay.
[1:20:32] &gt;&gt; You will pay
[1:20:33] &gt;&gt; with your laziness.
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; You have no work to get come inside your
[1:20:38] house. You're looking for a work not
[1:20:39] come to the house. Work doesn't come to
[1:20:41] the house. Sorry.
[1:20:49] pastor
[1:20:51] like a trouble man.
[1:20:54] But God
[1:20:56] would honor the fate. Here we go. I
[1:20:59] wrote this down. That acts when the
[1:21:02] conditions are not favorable.
[1:21:07] &gt;&gt; I challenge you tonight [applause]
[1:21:10] &gt;&gt; to act when the conditions are not
[1:21:13] favorable.
[1:21:15] Too many of you want to fail. Too many
[1:21:17] of you, you don't want to fail, so you
[1:21:19] don't try. Too many of you don't want to
[1:21:20] do because you don't want to embarrass.
[1:21:22] You don't want this to happen, that
[1:21:23] happen. Forget that.
[1:21:25] &gt;&gt; You don't know how things going to do.
[1:21:28] So you sew in the morning. You sew in
[1:21:30] the evening. Let God bless.
[1:21:34] Hallelujah. But if you don't sow, you
[1:21:36] have nothing to get. Oh, give the Lord
[1:21:38] some praises. Do a shout in the house.
[1:21:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:21:45] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Amen.
[1:21:49] &gt;&gt; Have a next one for you. I ain't getting
[1:21:51] the message yet.
[1:21:52] &gt;&gt; No, you know I'm not going 3 hours. I
[1:21:54] could go two and a half but not three.
[1:21:56] &gt;&gt; See?
[1:21:58] All right. Just have midnight across.
[1:22:00] Right. All right. So, Isaac obeyed and
[1:22:04] God blessed him. And watch. I like how
[1:22:06] the words were phrased. The man waxed
[1:22:08] great and went forward. Some people
[1:22:11] could ask great and go backward. You
[1:22:12] know
[1:22:13] &gt;&gt; that what I shown here know he went
[1:22:14] forward and grew. He grew again
[1:22:17] &gt;&gt; until he became very great for he had
[1:22:19] possession of flocks, possession of
[1:22:21] herds and great store of servants and
[1:22:23] the fullest had ever envy him. Remember
[1:22:24] that ah didn't have the scripture but
[1:22:27] remember that man who buried the talent.
[1:22:30] &gt;&gt; You see what God said about him?
[1:22:31] &gt;&gt; He's wicked.
[1:22:33] &gt;&gt; Now we in our human self might think
[1:22:35] it's so at least he get back you know he
[1:22:37] lose it.
[1:22:39] God not this unproductive thing you know
[1:22:42] &gt;&gt; he say add to your faith virtue unto
[1:22:43] virtue knowledge and God want God in the
[1:22:45] multiplying business in the adding
[1:22:47] business God into business you know
[1:22:49] &gt;&gt; God is a serious businessman you know
[1:22:51] &gt;&gt; when he come and see the man buried he
[1:22:53] say you wicked servant why didn't take
[1:22:54] it to the bank and get some interest on
[1:22:55] that just plain bad behavior when he
[1:22:58] said take that from that man and give it
[1:23:00] to the man who make multiply and so on
[1:23:03] he said to him that hath
[1:23:05] &gt;&gt; more shall be given
[1:23:07] &gt;&gt; and to him that hath Not even what he
[1:23:10] had shall be taken away from.
[1:23:12] &gt;&gt; You not hearing me tonight?
[1:23:14] &gt;&gt; Oh, you have to start somewhere.
[1:23:16] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. The first parable
[1:23:19] Jesus gave was the parable of the seed
[1:23:22] because that is where you start from.
[1:23:24] &gt;&gt; A seed of attitude,
[1:23:25] &gt;&gt; a seed of thinking, a seed of behavior,
[1:23:28] a seed that reframes your mind, how you
[1:23:31] think and why you think. And I'm going
[1:23:33] to show you this here right now.
[1:23:35] &gt;&gt; So Isaac swed during a time of famine.
[1:23:38] This blow my mind when I saw it. I
[1:23:39] couldn't believe it. It was famine. You
[1:23:41] know in famine you don't s you know you
[1:23:44] complain you had the fan because no rain
[1:23:47] falling. You know what I mean? You're
[1:23:49] fing your blowing and whatnot but I
[1:23:50] accident that rain falling yet but I s
[1:23:53] in the ground because you're having
[1:23:54] faith that the God that you serve
[1:23:58] will send you rain. When when brother
[1:24:01] Isaac was preaching last Sunday, he said
[1:24:02] I was home with a with a pop rail. The
[1:24:04] maxi will stop here and pick up this one
[1:24:06] as this one come up on next because God
[1:24:08] making a way. He will handle all the
[1:24:09] traffic lights, all the traffic just to
[1:24:11] make sure you get the passengers to get
[1:24:14] your bills paid. Oh, give the Lord some
[1:24:15] praises. That's when God making a way.
[1:24:18] Can we give the Lord a shout? [applause]
[1:24:21] So in a time of famine when there is no
[1:24:23] rain, this man planting Isaac planting
[1:24:26] Isaac planting. He's under expectation.
[1:24:28] Isaac of revelation. The God he serve is
[1:24:30] a God of his fathers. The God of
[1:24:32] Abraham. Oh God, he's the God
[1:24:33] [screaming] of Isaac. Hallelujah. He's
[1:24:35] swinging in faith. The conditions are
[1:24:37] unfavorable. It is dusty. It is
[1:24:39] [laughter] like desert. But he is still
[1:24:40] pulling the seed. He can't control the
[1:24:43] rain. God does. Oh, come give the Lord a
[1:24:46] shout. No man can control latter rain.
[1:24:49] God does.
[1:24:51] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. The [screaming]
[1:24:53] real rain is fixing to fall.
[1:24:57] But make sure you get the seed in.
[1:25:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:04] &gt;&gt; So the fact here we go that the Bible
[1:25:07] call and says he got a hundfold
[1:25:10] blessing.
[1:25:12] &gt;&gt; It means it's a little more than just
[1:25:13] his showing.
[1:25:16] &gt;&gt; So it wasn't just the physical act. I
[1:25:18] want to share something with you. Lots
[1:25:21] of times things we do in the natural
[1:25:23] have a a spiritual effect to it. Amen.
[1:25:28] &gt;&gt; What you seen as ordinary is not
[1:25:30] ordinary.
[1:25:32] &gt;&gt; Example, woman come to Jesus say I have
[1:25:34] a daughter of sex with the devil. She
[1:25:36] has said it's not fake to take bread
[1:25:38] casting a dog that's supposed to throw
[1:25:39] that woman off. Said she off go to
[1:25:41] Facebook and WhatsApp and Tik Tok and
[1:25:44] blow herself out and blow out the church
[1:25:45] and blow out the Jesus and blow out
[1:25:46] everybody else. She stood her grounds
[1:25:49] &gt;&gt; and say if that man called me a dog,
[1:25:51] there must be a reason behind that.
[1:25:53] &gt;&gt; Maybe God want me to see something. and
[1:25:55] she enter into what a dog sees.
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; That's what she did. You know,
[1:25:59] &gt;&gt; she said, "But Lord, even the dog get
[1:26:01] crumbs."
[1:26:02] &gt;&gt; In other words, I'm willing to take
[1:26:04] crumbs.
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; And Jesus said, "For this,
[1:26:07] &gt;&gt; your daughter [applause and cheering]
[1:26:10] is delivered."
[1:26:11] Her words affect something in the
[1:26:13] heavenly realm.
[1:26:15] [applause]
[1:26:17] Come on now. So words are not just
[1:26:19] words. There's power behind words.
[1:26:22] Hallelujah. If you can't make it and you
[1:26:24] say I can't make it, you can't make it
[1:26:26] because you said that. If you said I can
[1:26:28] make it, you can make it because you
[1:26:30] said that. Give the Lord a shout. What
[1:26:33] are you saying tonight? Tonight will be
[1:26:35] different. Oh, glory to God. Because you
[1:26:38] can get delivered tonight. You can get
[1:26:40] healed tonight. You can get free
[1:26:42] tonight. God can heal your case, heal
[1:26:45] your mind, heal your spirit, set you
[1:26:48] free tonight.
[1:26:52] All right.
[1:26:53] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[1:26:54] &gt;&gt; 2 Kings 4,
[1:26:56] &gt;&gt; we want to read 1-7.
[1:26:58] And I saw something this I never saw
[1:27:00] before. That's why I'm reading it.
[1:27:03] &gt;&gt; That there are certain woman of the
[1:27:04] wives of the sons of the prophet of unto
[1:27:07] Elijah, saying, "Thy servant th my
[1:27:10] husband is dead, and thou knowest that
[1:27:13] thy servant did fear the Lord." This is
[1:27:15] 2 Kings 4. And the creditor has come to
[1:27:17] take away him my two sons to be born.
[1:27:20] This fine sister lost her husband. The
[1:27:24] creditors is after her. The banks is
[1:27:26] after her. They come in to take her
[1:27:28] husband. In those days, if you can't
[1:27:29] pay, you take a turn into slavery or
[1:27:32] whatever.
[1:27:33] &gt;&gt; And Elijah said unto her, "What
[1:27:36] shall I do for thee? Tell me, what has
[1:27:42] thou in the house?"
[1:27:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:44] &gt;&gt; God have to have something to start
[1:27:46] with.
[1:27:47] The prophet said you had to do something
[1:27:49] for something to take place.
[1:27:51] &gt;&gt; He took up a rock and he threw it up in
[1:27:53] the air and dunk come a whirlwind
[1:27:55] &gt;&gt; and the voice of God thunder through
[1:27:56] that. He said you got to do something
[1:27:59] for something to happen.
[1:28:01] &gt;&gt; You did something tonight to come to
[1:28:02] service tonight.
[1:28:07] [cheering]
[1:28:08] [applause]
[1:28:09] &gt;&gt; The first thing the prophet asked her is
[1:28:11] what has thou in the house? She said,
[1:28:13] "Thy handmade hath not anything in the
[1:28:15] house, save a pot of oil."
[1:28:19] &gt;&gt; Just a pot.
[1:28:21] &gt;&gt; He said, "Go
[1:28:23] borrow thee vessels abroad
[1:28:26] &gt;&gt; of all thy neighbors, even empty
[1:28:28] vessels." Watch that word empty.
[1:28:31] &gt;&gt; Borrow, not a few.
[1:28:35] &gt;&gt; You know, I don't talk to their
[1:28:37] neighbors. Now,
[1:28:40] &gt;&gt; you know how long me say good morning.
[1:28:43] Hallelujah.
[1:28:44] &gt;&gt; You see how your behavior
[1:28:46] &gt;&gt; could affect your blessing?
[1:28:49] &gt;&gt; I private.
[1:28:53] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:28:53] &gt;&gt; I want to ask.
[1:28:56] &gt;&gt; You going to lose your sons. You know
[1:28:59] &gt;&gt; because the critiques coming f
[1:29:02] &gt;&gt; the prophet began an answer.
[1:29:04] &gt;&gt; He said, "What in your house?"
[1:29:07] She said, "A pot of oil. Go get some
[1:29:09] vessels.
[1:29:11] &gt;&gt; What you going to do with that?" then
[1:29:12] not your business.
[1:29:14] &gt;&gt; Your business is to hear
[1:29:16] &gt;&gt; and obey.
[1:29:18] &gt;&gt; And he said, "Not of you." In other
[1:29:20] words, get them sister.
[1:29:22] &gt;&gt; Go get them.
[1:29:23] &gt;&gt; That sister had to be a sister that was
[1:29:25] a connector.
[1:29:27] &gt;&gt; Neighbor, you know, neighbor.
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; Empty [snorts] vessels. And she going
[1:29:32] down the street, empty vessels. You have
[1:29:33] any empty vessels. They don't know what
[1:29:35] she want that for.
[1:29:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:42] The prophet continues, "And when thou
[1:29:43] art come in, thou shalt shut the door
[1:29:46] upon thee, upon thy sons, and shall pour
[1:29:49] out into all those vessels, and thou
[1:29:54] shalt set aside that which is full."
[1:29:57] Amen.
[1:29:58] &gt;&gt; So she went from him, shut the door upon
[1:30:00] her, upon her sons, who brought the
[1:30:02] vessels to her, and she poured out. And
[1:30:05] it came to pass, when the vessels were
[1:30:06] full, she said unto son, "Bring me yet
[1:30:08] another vessel." So this one potter of
[1:30:11] vessel of oil was pouring fulling. Once
[1:30:15] that vessel empty it full it
[1:30:17] &gt;&gt; what she now empty full
[1:30:20] &gt;&gt; empty full
[1:30:21] &gt;&gt; and she keeps pouring this one pot of
[1:30:24] oil filling buckets of oil.
[1:30:29] &gt;&gt; Get the point I want to get that.
[1:30:32] &gt;&gt; It came to pass when the vessels were
[1:30:35] full she said unto son bring me yet
[1:30:38] another vessel. He said unto her, "There
[1:30:40] is not a vessel more."
[1:30:43] &gt;&gt; And the oil stayed.
[1:30:45] &gt;&gt; What about Isaac? This blow me out.
[1:30:48] &gt;&gt; Oil was coming as long as there was
[1:30:51] enough empty vessels there to collect
[1:30:54] it.
[1:30:55] &gt;&gt; You cannot expect God to pour where the
[1:30:58] vessels are not empty.
[1:31:00] &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord a shout in the house.
[1:31:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [cheering] In the amplified,
[1:31:06] this verse says, "When the vessels were
[1:31:08] full, she said to her son, bring me
[1:31:10] another vessel." And he said to her,
[1:31:12] "There's none left." Then the oil
[1:31:14] stopped multiplying.
[1:31:17] &gt;&gt; The oil was multiplying based on vessels
[1:31:21] being empty.
[1:31:23] &gt;&gt; Do you want to be an empty vessel
[1:31:24] tonight?
[1:31:26] &gt;&gt; Or you're full of yourself. Or you're
[1:31:28] full of your ego. Or you're full of you
[1:31:30] have to prove a point. Or do you want to
[1:31:32] empty that out tonight? Give the Lord a
[1:31:35] shout. There must too much people full
[1:31:38] of the self. God want that self empty
[1:31:40] out. God want you to be the empty vessel
[1:31:44] that he could pour out into [screaming]
[1:31:45] you. The oil of God. You have been
[1:31:48] hindered yourself. Don't blame the
[1:31:51] pastor. Don't blame the elder. Don't
[1:31:53] blame some cousin, uncle, aunt or
[1:31:55] father, mother. You have nobody to
[1:31:56] blame.
[1:31:57] &gt;&gt; Get it [screaming] out of you.
[1:32:00] become an empty vessel. Blessed are they
[1:32:03] that hunger and thirst for
[1:32:04] righteousness. They shall be filled. Oh,
[1:32:07] give the Lord a shout in the house. Too
[1:32:10] much of blaming. Cut it out. [cheering]
[1:32:13] You are immature when you're blaming.
[1:32:16] Accept responsibility for your actions
[1:32:18] and your attitude.
[1:32:24] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Isaac didn't curse the
[1:32:25] famine. Isaac didn't curse the dryness.
[1:32:28] And there's no rain. What Isaac did, he
[1:32:30] cut the corn, he got the seeds, and he
[1:32:32] put it in the ground. Because you know
[1:32:34] God is responsible for rain. I am
[1:32:36] responsible to put the seed
[1:32:39] in the ground. [cheering]
[1:32:41] [applause]
[1:32:44] &gt;&gt; Some of you stunned. [cheering] You
[1:32:46] didn't expect on the oldest night.
[1:32:50] &gt;&gt; So you expect God to take the seed and
[1:32:52] plant it for you?
[1:32:53] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:32:54] &gt;&gt; You really expect that? Even you may be
[1:32:57] seated.
[1:33:00] &gt;&gt; Even the parable with Jesus and SW seed,
[1:33:02] he says some fell on the way side,
[1:33:04] &gt;&gt; boys come and take it. You come home.
[1:33:07] God again. They going to throw seeds.
[1:33:11] There some people know they're so
[1:33:12] negative. They throw it and it flop and
[1:33:15] birds take it and you're done.
[1:33:18] &gt;&gt; The birds must take some. They can't
[1:33:20] take all.
[1:33:21] &gt;&gt; Some fell on rocks.
[1:33:23] &gt;&gt; Some fell among thorns. But some fell on
[1:33:25] good ground.
[1:33:27] &gt;&gt; Don't bother with the birds take. The
[1:33:28] bird must take some. [cheering]
[1:33:31] &gt;&gt; You're planting. I had teeth and you
[1:33:33] want the teeth to thief. The chief must
[1:33:34] leave some.
[1:33:37] &gt;&gt; You have 10 acres. If the teeth one
[1:33:39] acre, you have 9 acres remaining.
[1:33:43] [applause]
[1:33:44] &gt;&gt; I planting the teeth.
[1:33:47] &gt;&gt; You're a fool.
[1:33:49] &gt;&gt; I'm telling you.
[1:33:51] Amen.
[1:33:52] &gt;&gt; See, preacher, preacher, don't be so
[1:33:54] rough now.
[1:33:55] &gt;&gt; Why you getting the message home now?
[1:33:57] &gt;&gt; Some fell on the way side.
[1:33:59] &gt;&gt; Jesus preached that. Some fell among the
[1:34:02] rocks. The jumpy jumpy jump fast. After
[1:34:04] two services, they gone.
[1:34:06] &gt;&gt; It's rock. They have no anchor.
[1:34:08] &gt;&gt; Some fell among thorns. Oh god, it's the
[1:34:11] work. It's the job. It's my husband and
[1:34:13] the vine up. So,
[1:34:14] &gt;&gt; you know what? Bubble corn. You corn
[1:34:16] with one grain in it. You plant one
[1:34:17] grain to get one grain.
[1:34:19] The cares of life choke you.
[1:34:21] &gt;&gt; So instead of you come blossoming and
[1:34:23] strong and anchored as a vine, you
[1:34:26] complaining and you're vexed and
[1:34:28] somebody triggering you and you're off
[1:34:29] key and what vines you know tie you up,
[1:34:31] you know.
[1:34:33] &gt;&gt; But some fell among good ground
[1:34:36] &gt;&gt; bringing forth 60fold,
[1:34:38] &gt;&gt; 80fold, 100fold. You [screaming] are
[1:34:41] good ground tonight.
[1:34:45] [applause]
[1:34:46] Empty
[1:34:51] vessels,
[1:34:52] &gt;&gt; empty of self,
[1:34:54] &gt;&gt; empty of the insecurities, empty of all
[1:34:57] what you want to do to get validation
[1:35:00] &gt;&gt; to prove your worthow.
[1:35:02] I go show them wait. Come on, get out of
[1:35:07] that. Okay.
[1:35:10] All right.
[1:35:12] Let's go.
[1:35:13] So, brother Brandon was very zealous of
[1:35:16] the kind of seed he had to sw because
[1:35:18] orus was there to sew the Pentecostal
[1:35:21] seed. Billy Graham was there to sw the
[1:35:23] denominational seed and he was there to
[1:35:26] bring a seed to catch a bride.
[1:35:29] &gt;&gt; So, we are not brandites. We are not a
[1:35:32] denomination. We are sons of God
[1:35:35] &gt;&gt; that going to be birthed out of the word
[1:35:37] of God. Because man shall not by bread
[1:35:40] alone, but by every word that come out
[1:35:42] the mouth of God.
[1:35:44] If God's mouth speak to you tonight of
[1:35:46] your healing, of your deliverance and
[1:35:48] breakthrough, there's not devils in hell
[1:35:49] to stop that.
[1:35:53] &gt;&gt; This power goes through time space, goes
[1:35:57] through barriers. This is what we
[1:35:59] talking about. The power of God by the
[1:36:01] word of God. I'm here to preach the
[1:36:03] word. God is here to confirm the word
[1:36:05] that I'm preaching. And God will confirm
[1:36:07] it to you because he's the same
[1:36:09] yesterday, today, and forever. Go give
[1:36:11] the Lord some praises. Let's [cheering]
[1:36:13] go. God never intended the church to be
[1:36:16] run by men.
[1:36:18] &gt;&gt; God runs his church and he runs it
[1:36:20] through the gifts of the spirit. The
[1:36:22] gifts of the spirit in the church is to
[1:36:24] correct the spirit.
[1:36:25] &gt;&gt; He got five ministerial offices in the
[1:36:28] church. Apostles,
[1:36:32] teachers, prophets, evangelists,
[1:36:34] pastors. That's the elected officers of
[1:36:37] the church. And in each local church,
[1:36:40] there's nine spiritual gifts that's come
[1:36:42] among the people, which is knowledge,
[1:36:44] wisdoms, gifts of healing, working of
[1:36:46] miracles, speaking with tongues,
[1:36:47] interpretation of tongues. All these
[1:36:49] things go in a local body and every
[1:36:51] person in the church has an individual
[1:36:54] ministry and that individual ministry
[1:36:56] goes individual ministry goes together
[1:36:57] with the rest of the ministry to edify
[1:37:00] the body of Christ.
[1:37:01] &gt;&gt; So you are not here for yourself. You
[1:37:03] are here to be part of this glorious
[1:37:05] body of Christ to edify the body of
[1:37:07] Christ. This here is a fellowship where
[1:37:10] we come to. But the body of Christ is a
[1:37:12] universal body because by one spirit God
[1:37:15] put you into that body called the body
[1:37:17] of Jesus Christ. Isn't that right?
[1:37:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:37:21] &gt;&gt; There is a woman touched his garment and
[1:37:23] she was healed with a blood issue. A
[1:37:25] soldier spit in his face but a crown of
[1:37:27] his thorns in his head felt no virtue.
[1:37:29] It's your approach. The attitude is what
[1:37:32] it takes. And that's what it is tonight
[1:37:34] dear friend. It takes the attitude. We
[1:37:37] are and believe that we are in the
[1:37:39] presence of Jesus Christ. It's your
[1:37:40] attitude that brings the results.
[1:37:43] &gt;&gt; The mechanics is here and so is the
[1:37:46] dynamics.
[1:37:47] &gt;&gt; But hear the fine print. If you can get
[1:37:49] started,
[1:37:51] &gt;&gt; God will do the rest.
[1:37:53] Give the Lord a shout.
[1:37:56] If you could get started,
[1:37:58] God will do the rest. When David
[1:38:01] challenged when Goliath challenged
[1:38:03] David, David said, "I'll go fight him."
[1:38:04] He said, "I'm a dog. You bring a little
[1:38:06] boy to me." David start to wing up his
[1:38:08] his sling. Run to me, Goliath. And each
[1:38:11] one of us have our own Goliath to deal
[1:38:13] with. You can't you can't defeat what
[1:38:15] you're not prepared to confront. You
[1:38:17] have to confront your own Goliath. You
[1:38:18] have to confront your own demons. You
[1:38:20] have to confront your own issues. Stop
[1:38:23] blaming everyone.
[1:38:28] If you could get started,
[1:38:30] start it tonight with the right
[1:38:32] attitude. Start tonight to change your
[1:38:34] thinking. The whole world is against you
[1:38:36] and like God vex with you and you're
[1:38:37] angry with God. God say I love you.
[1:38:41] &gt;&gt; That's why you're here. That's why
[1:38:43] you're alive. He going to kill you a
[1:38:44] long time ago. He said, "But I love
[1:38:46] you."
[1:38:47] &gt;&gt; His love is elective love. He can send
[1:38:49] you through the waters. He can send you
[1:38:51] through the flood. He can send you
[1:38:52] through the fire. But all come through
[1:38:53] the blood. Oh, give the Lord a shout.
[1:38:57] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. It don't have to work out
[1:38:58] how you think it going to work out. But
[1:39:00] it's going to work out fine because
[1:39:01] Romans 8:28 teaches us all things work
[1:39:04] together for good. To them that love
[1:39:06] God. To them who are the called accord
[1:39:09] to his purpose. Oh, give the Lord a
[1:39:12] shout. Oh, we know God. God kill you for
[1:39:15] your first sin, but they're still here
[1:39:17] because God put blood there. Oh, give
[1:39:18] the Lord a shout because the judgment
[1:39:21] seat have blood in it. It's a mercy
[1:39:23] seat.
[1:39:26] Do I hear a shout inside of here? It's a
[1:39:29] judgment seat, you know, but God put
[1:39:31] blood in it and that makes it a mercy
[1:39:34] seat.
[1:39:40] [applause]
[1:39:41] Let me drop a bomb here one time. And
[1:39:44] the mercy seat of the blood for this is
[1:39:46] brotherly kindness.
[1:39:47] &gt;&gt; Without that is judgment.
[1:39:49] &gt;&gt; Jesus prayed a prayer. Father, forgive
[1:39:51] us as we forgive those that trespass
[1:39:53] against us. You have no forgiveness if
[1:39:56] you don't want to forgive somebody else.
[1:39:58] Give the Lord a shout in the house.
[1:40:01] [cheering]
[1:40:03] [applause]
[1:40:07] &gt;&gt; Faith is based upon forgiveness, not
[1:40:10] anger,
[1:40:12] &gt;&gt; not temper,
[1:40:13] &gt;&gt; not bad behavior and bad as you. Faith
[1:40:16] &gt;&gt; is based upon forgiveness. Even Jesus on
[1:40:19] the cross, them wicked people saying
[1:40:21] crucify, he said, "Father, forgive them.
[1:40:24] They don't know what they're doing.
[1:40:28] &gt;&gt; The old crooked thief on the side of him
[1:40:30] too said why you don't save us and save
[1:40:32] yourself. So
[1:40:35] &gt;&gt; he dying
[1:40:36] &gt;&gt; but your mouth hot.
[1:40:40] &gt;&gt; He dying but he still don't care. The
[1:40:43] other thief said oh God we are old man.
[1:40:47] This man different.
[1:40:50] &gt;&gt; He reframed things. Lord remember me.
[1:40:55] That man never opened a Bible, never
[1:40:56] went to a church, never again baptized,
[1:40:58] never hold hallelujah glory or sing some
[1:41:00] special or sing some church song. Jesus
[1:41:02] said today
[1:41:04] &gt;&gt; you will be with me. [cheering]
[1:41:07] &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord a shout in the house.
[1:41:12] [applause]
[1:41:15] [cheering]
[1:41:18] Let me see that. I shared in Africa,
[1:41:21] shared other places about the woman
[1:41:23] caught in actry.
[1:41:25] &gt;&gt; How that went to public to private.
[1:41:27] &gt;&gt; How all them had their big stone to
[1:41:28] stone tree
[1:41:29] &gt;&gt; because she got she caught in the very
[1:41:31] act. And Jesus said okay.
[1:41:34] The act Moses lost it a stone. He said
[1:41:36] okay. He said yeah. Amen. Glory.
[1:41:39] &gt;&gt; All have stone. Good.
[1:41:42] &gt;&gt; Which one of you without sin? Loose that
[1:41:45] stone. And he turned his back to them,
[1:41:47] not to embrace them, not to shame them,
[1:41:49] but to get them the opportunity to
[1:41:50] examine their hearts to walk away
[1:41:51] because they were hypocrites.
[1:41:55] &gt;&gt; And when all of them walk away, he said,
[1:41:56] "Woman, where are your accusers?"
[1:41:59] &gt;&gt; She said, she she she herself didn't
[1:42:01] even know when they left.
[1:42:02] &gt;&gt; She said, "None, my Lord." He said,
[1:42:04] "Neither
[1:42:05] &gt;&gt; do I condemn thee.
[1:42:08] &gt;&gt; Go and sin no more. You could live
[1:42:10] harder than that. You could be better
[1:42:12] than that." He point out where she could
[1:42:14] go.
[1:42:16] in terms of life
[1:42:18] &gt;&gt; freed her from that.
[1:42:19] &gt;&gt; But you know something about that story?
[1:42:22] &gt;&gt; Nobody was there to hear Jesus said that
[1:42:24] to her.
[1:42:27] &gt;&gt; Nobody was [screaming] there. It might
[1:42:28] have be good if them hypocrit was there
[1:42:30] to hear Jesus forgive me. Everybody know
[1:42:33] but was she and Jesus alone.
[1:42:36] &gt;&gt; So she had to walk
[1:42:38] &gt;&gt; with faith
[1:42:39] &gt;&gt; with revelation knowing everybody know
[1:42:42] what she did. But God
[1:42:45] Rich in mercy, [cheering]
[1:42:47] set her free. That is why you should be
[1:42:50] shouted tonight. And don't sit there
[1:42:53] like some dumb dog in Israel. Oh, give
[1:42:55] the Lord a shout. Give the Lord a
[1:42:57] praise. [cheering]
[1:42:59] Praise God. Praise God. Praise God.
[1:43:02] Hallelujah. Jesus saved me. There's a
[1:43:04] song we sing. The Lord save me. Why
[1:43:07] should [screaming] I be bound? I've been
[1:43:08] baptized in [music] Jesus name.
[1:43:10] [cheering]
[1:43:16] &gt;&gt; [cheering]
[1:43:18] &gt;&gt; Watch this. [applause]
[1:43:20] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:43:23] &gt;&gt; Job had no Bible to read. He went by
[1:43:26] inspiration
[1:43:27] &gt;&gt; with inspired.
[1:43:28] &gt;&gt; That's it. It's got the mechanics ready.
[1:43:31] The church if only dynamics tonight. If
[1:43:34] we get the mechanics ready,
[1:43:35] &gt;&gt; get our hearts right.
[1:43:37] &gt;&gt; The things that we can do.
[1:43:40] &gt;&gt; What's the mechanics? The car. The
[1:43:42] dynamics come like the battery. So if
[1:43:44] you have a car and there's no battery
[1:43:46] inside the car and you're taking
[1:43:47] pictures on Instagram and you're telling
[1:43:49] people, boy, you have a brand new ride,
[1:43:52] but you see that right car drives. A
[1:43:54] little boy with a three tricycle passing
[1:43:56] you straight. He more power than you.
[1:43:59] You understand? Because you a fancy car.
[1:44:01] You had the rims and you and you polish
[1:44:02] it and whatn not. Let us go. No, not not
[1:44:05] today. Not today.
[1:44:07] You want [laughter] to move today? You
[1:44:08] only taking pictures today
[1:44:10] &gt;&gt; because all you have is mechanic. you
[1:44:11] have nothing. If you have dynamics, you
[1:44:14] could turn the key and let the engine
[1:44:15] tumble,
[1:44:16] &gt;&gt; let the engine rumble. I don't want to
[1:44:18] know mechanics. I want to be able to
[1:44:20] turn the key and press gas and drive.
[1:44:23] &gt;&gt; Well, that is what the church needs,
[1:44:26] &gt;&gt; the power to press gas and drive. But we
[1:44:30] have a [screaming] promise. You shall
[1:44:33] receive power
[1:44:35] after the Holy Ghost comes upon you. Oh,
[1:44:39] give the Lord a shout in the house.
[1:44:41] [cheering]
[1:44:42] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. So you getting into 2026
[1:44:45] under a power, under an expectation,
[1:44:48] under a [screaming] promise. Well, give
[1:44:51] the Lord a shout in the house. That is
[1:44:53] where we at. [cheering]
[1:44:59] Glory.
[1:45:01] Hallelujah.
[1:45:02] If you get the mechanics ready, get our
[1:45:05] hearts right. the things we can do.
[1:45:07] Follow every word, follow him in
[1:45:09] baptism, follow him in every order he
[1:45:12] told us to do. Get every mechanic ready
[1:45:15] and stand there. Then we are ready for
[1:45:17] the dynamics to be lit off. And only God
[1:45:20] can do that.
[1:45:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:23] &gt;&gt; My God.
[1:45:25] &gt;&gt; So we know Jesus from age 12 to 30, he
[1:45:29] was under silence.
[1:45:31] &gt;&gt; He said nothing.
[1:45:33] &gt;&gt; He was just working in the carpenter
[1:45:34] shop. He was normal living.
[1:45:37] &gt;&gt; But then John the Baptist came
[1:45:39] &gt;&gt; and cause a rock in the island.
[1:45:41] &gt;&gt; So to rock the place. He said there is
[1:45:43] one standing among you.
[1:45:45] &gt;&gt; You see the man yet?
[1:45:46] &gt;&gt; By faith he is preaching
[1:45:48] &gt;&gt; because he know he was forced sent to
[1:45:50] forrun the Messiah.
[1:45:52] &gt;&gt; One day Jesus come down the water. Stand
[1:45:54] up in line to get baptized. And John
[1:45:56] baptized this one and baptized that one.
[1:45:58] Here come Jesus. He said I have need for
[1:46:00] you to baptize me. And Jesus said that
[1:46:02] might be so but behoo us to fulfill our
[1:46:04] righteousness. And and John baptized
[1:46:06] Jesus and the dove came upon Jesus. And
[1:46:09] the Lord told John the one that you see
[1:46:12] the dove come down
[1:46:13] &gt;&gt; and remain
[1:46:15] &gt;&gt; because sometime the dove has come down
[1:46:16] and go.
[1:46:17] &gt;&gt; When the dove come down thinking is an
[1:46:18] alarm is a wolf.
[1:46:19] &gt;&gt; But when that dove come upon Jesus, it
[1:46:22] stayed there.
[1:46:23] &gt;&gt; And John said, "Behold the lamb of God."
[1:46:26] &gt;&gt; It changed from the prophet to the
[1:46:28] prophecy. Oh give the Lord a shout.
[1:46:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It changed from the prophet
[1:46:34] to the prophecy.
[1:46:36] &gt;&gt; And Jesus now led by the spirit
[1:46:40] &gt;&gt; gone into the wilderness. No elder, no
[1:46:43] deacon,
[1:46:44] &gt;&gt; no song tape.
[1:46:48] &gt;&gt; And he beat that devil.
[1:46:49] &gt;&gt; It is written.
[1:46:51] &gt;&gt; It is written. It is also written. And
[1:46:54] when he come back, the Bible said he
[1:46:56] came back in the power
[1:46:58] &gt;&gt; of the spirit.
[1:47:00] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Hallelujah. [cheering]
[1:47:03] &gt;&gt; But he he went into the temple and they
[1:47:06] said somebody I want somebody to read
[1:47:07] this morning. Was not Bible like this
[1:47:09] was scrolls.
[1:47:10] &gt;&gt; And Jesus went and find Isaiah scrolled
[1:47:12] down to Isaiah 61. And he begin to read.
[1:47:15] Hallelujah. The spirit is upon me
[1:47:19] &gt;&gt; because he has anointed me
[1:47:21] &gt;&gt; to preach to God. Now they think he
[1:47:22] reading text you
[1:47:25] &gt;&gt; they think that was a text that night
[1:47:27] you know
[1:47:27] &gt;&gt; but he was reading a living word
[1:47:30] &gt;&gt; he knew it anointed him
[1:47:32] &gt;&gt; he knew God is with him it's a present
[1:47:35] tense reality but they think it's just
[1:47:37] an text
[1:47:40] [applause and cheering]
[1:47:41] he sent me to heal the brokenhearted to
[1:47:44] preach deliverance to the captive and
[1:47:46] the recover of sight to the blind to set
[1:47:48] at liberty them that are bruised and to
[1:47:51] preach is the acceptable year of the
[1:47:52] Lord. And then Jesus closed the book.
[1:47:55] And then he sat down and said, "This day
[1:47:58] this scripture is fulfilled
[1:48:00] &gt;&gt; in your ear."
[1:48:02] &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord a shout. What are we
[1:48:05] going to say this year? Hallelujah. One
[1:48:07] of these days, Revelation 20:17,
[1:48:11] the spirit and the bride say, "Come."
[1:48:15] &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord a shout.
[1:48:17] &gt;&gt; The bride will have a voice. The voice
[1:48:20] of God will be in her. Every devil will
[1:48:23] know it. Hell will know it. The message
[1:48:26] world will know it. Those false anointed
[1:48:29] going to know it. Or give the Lord a
[1:48:31] shout because the manifestation will be
[1:48:34] the interpretation.
[1:48:36] Praise God. Praise God. Hallelujah.
[1:48:39] Hallelujah.
[1:48:41] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:48:43] Hallelujah.
[1:48:45] My God. Paul to Timothy. For the time
[1:48:48] will come when they will not endure
[1:48:50] sound doctrine, but will heap to
[1:48:53] themselves teachers having itching ears
[1:48:56] and will turn from the truth to fables.
[1:49:00] &gt;&gt; Oh my. So Jesus told his own disciples,
[1:49:03] don't preach anymore until they went in
[1:49:06] the power of the spirit,
[1:49:07] &gt;&gt; waiting in the seat of Jerusalem until
[1:49:09] you endure with power from on high.
[1:49:11] &gt;&gt; You are not to go out until it's not you
[1:49:13] but God. Here it is. That the people can
[1:49:16] see. Here we go. Brother Angley. The
[1:49:18] reflection of Christ in you.
[1:49:22] &gt;&gt; Not not not I have a gift I could
[1:49:24] preach. Anybody could preach.
[1:49:26] &gt;&gt; Anybody could take the scripture give
[1:49:28] without repentance. But what he's
[1:49:30] talking about is a life
[1:49:33] &gt;&gt; because that's the thunder that's going
[1:49:34] to shake the devil.
[1:49:39] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[1:49:40] &gt;&gt; How much ministers and pastors crack
[1:49:43] because there's no life there.
[1:49:45] &gt;&gt; You ever knock a piece of wood and it's
[1:49:47] empty?
[1:49:49] &gt;&gt; You're knocking. So yeah, afterward
[1:49:52] chilly BB they call it a lot of finding
[1:49:54] coming out there. You know the worms
[1:49:56] eating out on the inside then
[1:49:58] &gt;&gt; it looking good on the outside. And
[1:50:00] Jesus told them Pharisees he said your
[1:50:01] white is the fulcers outside looking
[1:50:03] white and clean be like inside of you
[1:50:04] dead men bones. Amen.
[1:50:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:50:09] &gt;&gt; Am I frightening you?
[1:50:11] &gt;&gt; Hell, hell hotter than this, you know.
[1:50:12] &gt;&gt; So, this is not frightening you at all.
[1:50:15] &gt;&gt; This is just trying to get the word to
[1:50:16] you
[1:50:17] &gt;&gt; because the word is God.
[1:50:19] &gt;&gt; Don't blame me and don't shoot me, you
[1:50:20] know.
[1:50:21] &gt;&gt; Don't wait to beat me up in the corner
[1:50:22] when I leave the church. You know, not
[1:50:24] this not my message, you know. This is
[1:50:25] his message, you know.
[1:50:27] &gt;&gt; He said every mountain shall be made
[1:50:29] low.
[1:50:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:50:31] &gt;&gt; Because the Messiah is coming. Anytime
[1:50:33] Jesus coming, you got to make a way. You
[1:50:36] can't just ordinary. Listen, you may be
[1:50:38] seated.
[1:50:39] &gt;&gt; We just come through Christmas there.
[1:50:41] &gt;&gt; It's power washing.
[1:50:43] &gt;&gt; It's lights.
[1:50:44] &gt;&gt; It's is all kind of thing the people pay
[1:50:48] &gt;&gt; for Santa.
[1:50:50] &gt;&gt; Santa coming to town.
[1:50:52] &gt;&gt; You better do go by them when the
[1:50:54] Christmas season over that anointing way
[1:50:56] off.
[1:50:58] They want to know what you're doing in
[1:50:59] front of the see all now. So it might
[1:51:00] still get end up a little small a little
[1:51:03] cake and thing. But you going out the
[1:51:05] season, you want the water on you from
[1:51:07] my house. What that Christmas atmosphere
[1:51:10] go on, you know.
[1:51:11] &gt;&gt; This is just a spirit atmosphere, you
[1:51:13] know.
[1:51:15] &gt;&gt; So Jesus come back with the power of the
[1:51:17] spirit.
[1:51:18] &gt;&gt; And when he said it's fulfilled, they
[1:51:19] kick him out.
[1:51:21] &gt;&gt; It's not this Joseph's son.
[1:51:22] &gt;&gt; Are you talking?
[1:51:24] &gt;&gt; And when he walk out, he said heal the
[1:51:25] sick, cast out devils, rock Jerusalem,
[1:51:29] &gt;&gt; scribes, Pharisees, Herodians, Esenes,
[1:51:33] all of them. They're in trouble
[1:51:35] &gt;&gt; because this young man rocking the
[1:51:37] place.
[1:51:38] &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord a [screaming] shout.
[1:51:40] Wait till this bride strike the latter
[1:51:43] rain. She going to rock this place.
[1:51:46] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Devils cast out.
[1:51:49] Blind seeing cripples walking. Oh, give
[1:51:52] the Lord a shouting house. Power feel
[1:51:55] it. It is promised. I'm expecting it.
[1:51:59] Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:52:01] Are you expecting it? Are you looking
[1:52:04] for him?
[1:52:11] &gt;&gt; Paul Paul was unorganized but led by the
[1:52:15] spirit.
[1:52:17] &gt;&gt; All right. He said Paul an apostle not
[1:52:19] of men neither of man but by Jesus
[1:52:21] Christ.
[1:52:22] &gt;&gt; Galatians Paul says he said um that that
[1:52:25] many false brethren unawares brought in
[1:52:27] who came privy to spout our liberty.
[1:52:30] For brethren,
[1:52:31] &gt;&gt; they find you making much of noise.
[1:52:33] &gt;&gt; They call us the exercising church. We
[1:52:34] get up not become migrants.
[1:52:37] &gt;&gt; This the place exercise shout and jump
[1:52:41] &gt;&gt; but they sit down
[1:52:42] &gt;&gt; like most back church members dead as a
[1:52:44] doornail
[1:52:48] &gt;&gt; rocking in the arms of Morpheus
[1:52:51] &gt;&gt; killing sleep in church. man even saying
[1:52:54] it going on his subconscious men snoring
[1:52:56] [snorts]
[1:52:58] and a man will say it going on your
[1:53:00] subconscious what what foolishness is
[1:53:01] that
[1:53:03] you understand what the devil does why
[1:53:05] you get people on cigarette and smoking
[1:53:07] and gi whatnot to mess their mind up
[1:53:09] that they receive Christ
[1:53:10] &gt;&gt; when they boozing they can't be sober
[1:53:12] enough keep them drunk keep them
[1:53:14] stupified
[1:53:15] [applause]
[1:53:18] &gt;&gt; what devil make Tik Tok on them thing
[1:53:19] for
[1:53:20] &gt;&gt; keep them busy
[1:53:22] &gt;&gt; everywhere You go man selling thing and
[1:53:24] they watching where they selling you
[1:53:25] know
[1:53:28] they have things to sell. I seen them on
[1:53:29] the side of the road, but they doing so
[1:53:33] now. If it wasn't before, hey, coconut
[1:53:37] this they calling people for to to buy,
[1:53:39] but no, they doing so. You have to stop
[1:53:42] them is big shots.
[1:53:43] &gt;&gt; If you don't stop, they going to say and
[1:53:45] they don't mind because
[1:53:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:54] &gt;&gt; Once you have something going, you have
[1:53:56] to make preparation. That's why God was
[1:53:59] so angry when the king invited the
[1:54:00] people to the wedding supper. He said,
[1:54:02] "Come, come." I said, "Ah, let's buy a
[1:54:04] cow. They have this excuse. Just get
[1:54:07] married." He say, "Listen, go to the
[1:54:09] highways and get the byways and go and
[1:54:12] get them because I already killed the
[1:54:14] meat. It have curry goat. It have curry
[1:54:16] chicken. It have roti. It have what? All
[1:54:19] the meals you're talking about, it is
[1:54:21] there. Get them and let them sit down
[1:54:23] there."
[1:54:24] &gt;&gt; The man come and said there was moon. He
[1:54:26] said, "Go, go, compel them.
[1:54:30] &gt;&gt; Compel them."
[1:54:32] &gt;&gt; So if you sit here in your arrogance, if
[1:54:34] you sit here in your pomposity, there's
[1:54:36] a big word. Never used that word here
[1:54:37] before. If you sit here and you're big
[1:54:39] shot, God will bring people in.
[1:54:42] &gt;&gt; Halt, lame, [screaming] blind,
[1:54:45] prostitute, you name them. They will
[1:54:47] come in here and God will free them and
[1:54:49] they're going to shout and dance. And
[1:54:51] you will stay with your stiff hand that
[1:54:53] can't go off. Go give the Lord a shout.
[1:54:55] I'm going to dance tonight. I'm going to
[1:54:57] shout tonight. I'm going to praise God
[1:54:59] tonight. Oh, glory to God. I am not now.
[1:55:03] So, God coming at 17 years old. I was on
[1:55:06] fire 1975 and I am still on fire now.
[1:55:12] [cheering]
[1:55:15] Give the [screaming] Lord a shout. If I
[1:55:18] die and I'm in a box, you be be careful
[1:55:20] if you pass by that box. If you touch
[1:55:22] that body, you may get fired through.
[1:55:24] Look at the Lord. I shout. [screaming]
[1:55:25] There's fire in my [laughter]
[1:55:28] There's fire in my feet. There's fire in
[1:55:30] my bones. It is all over me. It is
[1:55:32] keeping me alive. It is the Holy Ghost
[1:55:35] and fire. [cheering]
[1:55:39] [applause]
[1:55:41] &gt;&gt; My Lord.
[1:55:42] Hallelujah.
[1:55:44] Paul is the one that said, "I came unto
[1:55:47] you not with excellency of speech, but I
[1:55:51] watch but I was in weakness and my
[1:55:53] speech and my preaching was not with
[1:55:54] enticing words of man's wisdom, but in
[1:55:57] the demonstration of the spirit and of
[1:55:59] power."
[1:56:00] &gt;&gt; Why? That your faith should have stand
[1:56:02] in the wisdom of men, but in the power
[1:56:04] of God.
[1:56:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:56:07] &gt;&gt; And there sat Acts 14:8. And they sack a
[1:56:11] certain man at Lististra, impotent in
[1:56:13] his feet, being a from his
[1:56:14] mother's womb, who never had walked. The
[1:56:18] same heard Paul speak, who steadfastly
[1:56:20] beholden him, and perceiving him to have
[1:56:22] faith to be healed, he said with a loud
[1:56:24] voice, stand upright on thy feet,
[1:56:26] &gt;&gt; and he leaped and walked.
[1:56:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:29] &gt;&gt; That was Paul.
[1:56:30] &gt;&gt; That is under the power of the spirit.
[1:56:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:56:35] There sat a widow, a certain young man
[1:56:37] named Eruus, being fallen into deep
[1:56:40] sleep. And Paul was preaching long, he
[1:56:42] sung down with sleep, and fell down from
[1:56:44] the third loft and taken up dead. And
[1:56:46] Paul went down and fell on him,
[1:56:48] embracing him. Trouble not yourselves,
[1:56:50] for his life is in him. And when the
[1:56:52] devil was come up again and broken bread
[1:56:54] and eaten, and talked a long while till
[1:56:56] the break of day, so he departed, and he
[1:56:58] brought the young man alive, and they
[1:57:00] were a little comforted. Oh, praise the
[1:57:02] name of the Lord. right away. If they
[1:57:04] are held in his hands, they are
[1:57:05] associated with his power. That is what
[1:57:08] the hand signifies. It signifies the
[1:57:10] power of God and the authority of God.
[1:57:13] Not one of them came in his own power
[1:57:15] and authority. That is what Paul said.
[1:57:17] No man would dare to. It takes the
[1:57:19] authority of God and the power of the
[1:57:21] Holy Ghost. The gospel is preached by
[1:57:23] the authority of God and the in the
[1:57:26] power of the spirit. These men were all
[1:57:29] empowered by the Holy Ghost. They all
[1:57:31] stood up to the world. They could not do
[1:57:33] that. They were full of God. They were
[1:57:35] sent or authorized by God, not by self
[1:57:38] or another man.
[1:57:40] &gt;&gt; So it goes to show men could be
[1:57:42] authorized by another man
[1:57:44] &gt;&gt; or by self.
[1:57:45] &gt;&gt; How about the close as the time just
[1:57:47] picks on us? My
[1:57:50] message of grace. The prophet said this.
[1:57:52] He said, I want you to notice he shall
[1:57:54] never say shall bring forth the
[1:57:55] cornerstone. He shall bring forth the
[1:57:57] headstone. And we know that the
[1:57:58] scriptures say that Jesus Christ in the
[1:58:00] f chief chief cornerstone. Therefore,
[1:58:02] this end time 78 messenger was to
[1:58:05] restore the faith of the children back
[1:58:07] to the fathers. In other words, rebuild
[1:58:10] the church again under the power of the
[1:58:12] spirit. And that is what I'm looking for
[1:58:15] in 2026 to see the church built and all
[1:58:18] the flesh pots and the fleshly people.
[1:58:19] You lost your flesh and you come out the
[1:58:21] flesh and come out the spirit and you
[1:58:23] walk by faith and you talk by faith and
[1:58:25] you live by faith and you do like Isaac.
[1:58:28] You're putting seeds when it's time of
[1:58:30] famine because you know rain is coming.
[1:58:32] Oh, give the Lord a shout.
[1:58:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. One man look on the ground
[1:58:37] and say famine, I can't plant because
[1:58:39] there is no rain. Another [screaming]
[1:58:40] man look at the same ground as I
[1:58:42] planting. Yes.
[1:58:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:43] &gt;&gt; Because rain coming.
[1:58:45] &gt;&gt; Oh the Lord I shout rain is coming. All
[1:58:48] right, let's go. The promised land.
[1:58:51] Music. Come on, please. The promised
[1:58:53] land. Oh, let me read it back here a
[1:58:54] little bit now. The promise is the
[1:58:55] baptism of the spirit,
[1:58:57] &gt;&gt; which is promised in the Old Testament
[1:58:58] and the new. The promise is, "Behold, I
[1:59:01] send the promise of my father upon you."
[1:59:04] That is the promise.
[1:59:06] &gt;&gt; The promised land is to live in this
[1:59:08] land of the Holy Spirit
[1:59:10] &gt;&gt; that God promised for the church. Is to
[1:59:12] live, Here we go, in the power of the
[1:59:14] spirit.
[1:59:15] &gt;&gt; It's another world. It's another land.
[1:59:19] &gt;&gt; Hear this. Hear this. You have to come
[1:59:20] out of the condition that you have been
[1:59:21] in to come to live in this land.
[1:59:26] &gt;&gt; And as we close, as we hear the
[1:59:29] explosions and money literally go up in
[1:59:32] smoke,
[1:59:34] &gt;&gt; literally
[1:59:35] all these explosions, money literally
[1:59:39] exploding in smoke.
[1:59:40] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon prayed. Heavenly Father,
[1:59:43] as we stand here, as many torches dying
[1:59:45] out in the hearts of the mistakes of the
[1:59:48] last year and we approaching the debt of
[1:59:50] we say 2025 and the birth of 2026, God
[1:59:54] may we be one step higher up the ladder
[1:59:57] until we can see Jesus on his program.
[2:00:00] May everyone here Lord in prayer while
[2:00:01] the old year is dying and the new birth
[2:00:04] of the new year is coming in. May the
[2:00:06] old man of sin and unbelief doubt in our
[2:00:08] heart and the new birth come in with
[2:00:11] 2026 like a rushing mighty wind. Make us
[2:00:14] fit servants. Forgive our past. Bless
[2:00:17] our future. Guide us, oh Lord, with thy
[2:00:20] mighty hand. Bless these ministers here.
[2:00:23] Bless all the ley, all the visitors. Be
[2:00:26] thou with us, Lord. We are your
[2:00:28] servants. We give ourselves holy to you
[2:00:31] for 2026.
[2:00:33] that the power of your spirit might have
[2:00:36] more preeminences in our life, in our
[2:00:38] being. Help us God. Forgive us and help
[2:00:41] us. We pray. Raise up mighty men. Raise
[2:00:44] up mighty wires of the faith. Open this
[2:00:46] year Lord that hidden manner that rock
[2:00:49] beneath the rock that we might see the
[2:00:51] program of God. Cap off the pyramids of
[2:00:53] our life. Put on the capstone Christ
[2:00:56] Jesus. May each and everyone upon us,
[2:00:58] each and every one of us. May his great
[2:01:00] magnificent holy blessing come upon us.
[2:01:02] May the fire of the Holy Ghost come upon
[2:01:04] us. May the power of the resurrection be
[2:01:05] manifested. How we thank thee tonight.
[2:01:08] We are yours. We give ourselves holy to
[2:01:10] you. May God bless you richly,
