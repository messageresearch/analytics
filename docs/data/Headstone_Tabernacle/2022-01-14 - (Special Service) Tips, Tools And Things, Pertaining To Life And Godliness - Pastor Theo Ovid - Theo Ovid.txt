something with you tonight and um if you have your bibles i'd like to return to genesis chapter 41 we want to read from verse 14. but isaac uh you're hearing me i see something pop up here about restarting my computer but um so in case uh it trips you will know what to do just hold on okay so genesis chapter 41 verse 14 to 46. and the title of what i want to share tonight is tips tools and things pertaining to life and godliness tip tips tools and things pertaining to life and godliness um let's read genesis 41 verse 14 then pharaoh sent them called joseph they brought him history out of the dungeon and he shaved himself changed his arraignment and came in onto fear and pharaoh said unto joseph i have dreamed a dream and there is none that can interpret it i have heard say of thee that dark hands understand a dream to interpret it and joseph answered pharaoh saying it is not in me god shall give fear an answer of peace and pharaoh said unto joseph in my dream behold i stood upon the back of the river and behold they came up out of the river seven kind fat fleshed and well favored and they said in the middle and behold some of the time came after them poor very ill-favored and lean fleshed such as i have never saw in the land of egypt for bald for badness and the lean and ill-favored kind they eat up the first seven fat kind and when they're eaten up it could not be known that they're eating them but they were still ill-favored at as at the beginning so i awoke and i saw in my dream and behold seven ears which came up in one stalk full and good and the old seven ears withered thin and blasted with the east winds sprung up after them and the thin ears devoured the seven good ears and i told this unto the magicians but there was none that could declare to me and joseph said on the fear the dream of pharaoh is one god had showed pharaoh what he is about to do the seven good kind are seven years and the seven good years are seven years the dream is one the seventeen and your favorite kind that came up after them are seven years and the seven empty ears blasted with the east wind shall be seven years of famine this is the thing which i have spoken unto pharaoh what god is about to do is show it on the field behold there come seven years of great plenty toward all the land of egypt and they shall arise on them after them seven years of famine and all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of egypt and famine shall consume the land and the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of that family following for it shall be very grievous look at this verse 32 here fourth and fourth that the dream was doubled onto pharaoh twice it is because the thing is established by god and god will surely shortly bring it to pass now therefore let pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise and set him over the land of egypt let pharaoh do this let him appoint officers over the land and take up the fifth part of the land of egypt in the seven plenteous years and let them gather all the food of those good years that come and lay up corn under the hand of pharaoh and let them keep food in the cities and that food shall be for store to the land against the seven years of famine which shall be in the land of egypt that the land perished not through the famine and the thing was good in the eyes of pharaoh and the eyes of all his servants and pharaoh said unto his servants can we find such a one as this a man in whom the spirit of god is and theory said unto jesus for as much as god that showed thee all this there is none so discreet and wise as god though shall be over my house and according unto thy word shall all my people be ruled only in the throne will i be greater than thou and pharaoh said unto joseph see i have set thee over all the land of egypt and pharaoh took of his ring from his hand put it upon joseph's hand i read him investors of fine linen and put a gold chain about his neck and he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had and they cried before him bowed the knee and he made him ruler over all the land of egypt and pharaoh said unto joseph i am fair and without thee shall no man lift up his hand or foot in all the land of egypt and pharaoh called joseph's name that patanaya and he gave him to wife asanas the daughter of potiphara priest of on and joseph went out all the land of egypt and joseph was 30 years old when he stood before fear rooking of egypt and joseph went out from the presence of pharaoh and went throughout all the land may god bless his word so i think this is a special night we just said nothing in special service for special service but i see a sort of see a opening that we could share things that we will not usually or normally share uh written a service for regular service even though tonight will be sold as scripturally based and this night is like a set of foundation for where we want to go uh similar to what isaac did on as a tuesday by the study i want to draw from this tips tools and things pertaining to life and godless as a broad canvas of the opportunities that we have to share things pertaining to god's kingdom to put in our lives and as we are hearing it here now this word established um the definition of established is accepted and recognized or followed by many people like established rules customs and traditions and i use this word because this is what was used in the scriptures that this double dream this double vision as it was he said because it is established by god so god sent it twice see and this established means having existed for a long time therefore recognized as good or successful like you say all established family successful for a long period of time widely known so this is what establishes growing or flourishing successfully as an established plant to establish flower garden the synonyms for establishes changeless constant determinate set settled stable steadfast steady and i see that as a backdrop to show marriage and the family was established by god and marriage is the oldest institution in the world marriage was performed first and instituted in the garden of eden now i know it's a queer approach to start with jesus and start with pharaoh and start with this dream but is a very interesting thing to know that when something is established when a news is fixed or you know what is going to come to pass or who are going to unfold what do you do what unfolds out of something that is established and this is where i want to bring your attention like almost like a microscope to zoom in and to look again that this man joseph he came out of prison street interferes presence interpreted a dream and was placed into a position of power including the ring from pharaoh and including the chariot second in command in the land of egypt but i want you to notice something that when the dream was made known or god's counsel or god's mind was made known then the wisdom of god that came upon joseph brought not just the knowledge was an understanding a clean understanding of what is to take place not only that but how to prepare for it because the vision was clean seven years of plenty followed by seven years of famine in the seven years of plenty you prepare for seven years of famine and then joseph begin to give direct word of advice to pharaoh as to how to approach it so what i want to get tonight as a platform is that even with visions revelations dreams inspiration that brings a overview a picture a picture that is painted of what is to be but from where we are to get to there there is process there is planning there is knowledge there is an unfolding of what is to be done and you know the thing about family life and marriage and all these i wouldn't say some institutions but all these institutions there is no school of learning of life then the the school teach biology and chemistry and physics and mathematics and english and social science and all these helping and intellectual stuff but in terms of marriage it's blank in terms of life in terms of well-being in terms of how to operate and conduct yourself and so on there's no school of that and to this end we could look to the word to help us address some of that and if we take it as an open canvas then it's not a matter of like they're trying to preach preach this or or teach teach this but it's the share share this course of life and solomon was endured wisdom to share a lot of things that we're going to look at tonight and help us a long life journey that give us tools and give us tips of of this abundant life over the years i have encountered my wife and i we have encountered what i will call religious people not spiritual people we have encountered many religious people who appear to be spiritual but the reality is that they are just religious now what do i mean by that what do i mean is that religious people they really enjoy the atmosphere the environment of church the environment of other people and so on but what they're short of is really subjecting themselves to god's plan god's program god's knowledge god's mind and when you live like that you are not really allowing him to be your lord because for jesus to be your lord you must allow him to be your ruler and he must be able to go in any one of your rooms in your heart in other words you don't say lord why are bless me here with a car i want to bless me here but i don't want to deal with where i go and who i i i i go out with i don't want you to deal with my private life i don't want you to deal with my personal i don't want you to go inside of there i want you to just bless me in other words you want a circumferential uh blessing a circumferential god a circumferential religion where is what you want it's what you desire and you know how you see it and there is no calvary there's no cross there's no death that is religious and you can quote scripture quote text quote quote and god share this and watch you that but when come to the real core of the word which is truth you you're not connecting with it and i want you to see truth as original word not truth not modern truth not not people interpreting it to be true you know like all spoken word is original seed i want you to see and i hope paul said that he paul said if i come back and preach another gospel let me be a christian in other words the original word is truth what god said in this world oh blessed be the name of the lord so i want to get out tonight and and get as a background tonight and proverbs 3. you'll have to find it you just listen because i just go through some stuff here and we see how it goes okay for proverbs 3 i want to read from this one we just go through my son forget not my law i let that heart keep my commandments hear why for length of days and long life and peace shall they mercy and truth for safety bind them about thy neck write them upon the table of their heart so shall they find fever and good understanding in the sight of god and man trust in the lord with all thy heart and lean not unto thy own understanding in all thy ways acknowledge him and he shall direct thy parts be not wise in thine own eyes fear the lord apart from evil it shall be held to thy neighbor and marrow to thy bones honor the lord with thy substance are with the firstfruits of thine increase reason so shall thy bands be filled with plenty and thy presses shall boost up with new wine my son despise not the chastening of the lord now this is solid stuff this is no play games thing this is solomon bringing wisdom okay despise not the chasing of the lord neither be wary of his correction you might have people that don't like nobody to talk to them tell them anything when i say talk to them i'm talking about to correct them you could preach to them laugh with them sing with them but when it comes to correction it's like you know what i'm talking about the cat when you pack when you pack the back of the cart this way one way they can't give me around me out when you're doing the other way once you go down the road a correction is a it's a frog face a bad attitude is a bad way and here it is you see and the thing of it is and you know it's something that i keep sharing with you that when israel came out of egypt they did not know god all they had was a promise a promise of deliverer being handed down from grandfather to grandchild grandfather grandchild father to son and for 400 years was being channeled as a promise deliver a common deliverable coming i mean men expecting it this year and then this year after 10 30 years men drop down and die and he was always coming and this was handed on from generation to generation when moses came it wasn't a question of just bringing him out he was bringing them out to the mountain of god that they could get a knowledge of god they could get an understanding of god they could get to know this god and i want you to understand that when god called us a sinner from save us he wanted to bring us into acknowledge his knowledge and understand of him not church what people fall is at the stop at church that is where they were ministers and pastors and bishops and message popes lock people down after the church level and the people feel when they reach church they reach god but but we're talking about not going beyond church this is beyond the church pew and beyond these specials and singing and so on and he preaching this is you and your life and your family and because you know before there was church there was that family that thing that was instituted by god and even for before the exodus the bible talk about take a lamb for a house and if the house is too small join up with somebody else so god is concerned about you god is concerned about the family god is concerned and is is not the concept of of of ordinary families and families out there we talking about we're talking about god's mind and god's concept of family like colgate imam and to thee all the family of the earth shall be blessed and blessed and i will bless tea and then multiply not multiplied by feed and so on so so so it's not as if god doesn't know or god doesn't be concerned about or god is not interested in he himself instituted this thing called family man and his wife man wife children man white children not a house a house is a building there are people living one on a dead face in one direction one face and east one facing west and it's a house it's not a home the cherry in this way and everything out of order and it's it's a building it's walls that people communicate in and talk with but it's not really a home do you have a house or do you have a home a home is where you feel comfort is where you feel rested is where you feel you belong that is what god did for his family before his family come at the scene he made a place called eden and in there he made a garden and in deer he praised adam he actually prepared a place where it will be their home and if you notice what we talk about that we are going back to eden and i'm not talking about eden as a physical place but even as a as a place in the spirit as a place of god as a place you know not not not not like you're going to france or germany or america or anything like that but getting back to the place that we belong now notice that the very beginning the very in genesis what the devil attacked was the family because adam and eve was one they were one god made them dust adam had a revelation that eve came out of him eve was a byproduct adam was original god did not tell eve the word god told adam the word so adam had the word and adam shared it with eve that is why eve could relate to this serpent and tell his husband this is what god said because he didn't know what was the messaging that was given out in the garden he didn't know adam didn't talk to this with him god didn't talk to disciple so the first thing he had was to do was to find out what is the message and the purpose was to push it and he made a switch he made a switch to say you know what god knows that if you break this thing here you'll be right that's why there's only reason why you know you could either have all the trees but that tree you know you should you just think about this you know because that is there's some reason he is holding back that she bought into his offer and man fell when that man fell right there no rom no whiskey no bar no no no man fell the family was broken that is right there in the beginning and right now we have broken homes broken families about relationships and everything else and the reasons for that is because of sin but i'm going to show you more than that there are issues that we have to deal with you know i i know i'm kind of jumping here jumping here but we're using this as our broadcast tonight as to where we could go and what we could share but you hear me say already i don't believe man and wife is 50 50. i i don't believe that man looking for wife to to to complete his life like if he is half or she oh he's 75 and she's 25. i believe two whole people is who's supposed to get married whole people i remember a brother one time years ago tell me about his girlfriend he had and he had to be careful how would he go to eat because she she she she picked you lovely food and and and i set up issues and things like that i said brother i see you walking around with that with a bit of suitcase because you had to watch this and watch it i said gently rest on that suitcase and keep walking brother i said you're not qualified to do better you have to keep all this some people that are picky buddha i said brother god equally to be a psychologist a psychiatrist that is not what you see her problems and it's your problems yeah they get sorted out because that will just mess you up and this is the problem we have problems and we have to get sorted out in our own hearts in our own minds in our own lives i remember when i got a certificate to get married i mean i remember telling the words that i didn't even know the politics was still later on say ma i say angry i marry you because i love you and i accept you as you are i love my wife i still am in love with my wife let's tell her i'll marry her again she doesn't appreciate that and it's true if i don't marry again simple samaritan okay but you know what love doesn't wash the words and love cannot pay the bills love can't clean the house you have to clean it i have to do it somebody has to do it so then you realize that this thing called marriage and this thing's called a relationship is a little more than the feeling of love it is a little more i should i should i see i shouldn't say a little more it is much more than that i remember ana marie was some time you get this years ago the early part of our minds we got in some fuss and i was upset really upset i was hungry i was upset and she's smiling to me you love me but yeah this statement itself was a shock to me i was blown out of the water because why would she do me that in other words it was better for me that if she was vex like me and she said you love me i said yes i love you i know i don't think that story but that was a junction for me by speaking it out without the feeling of it because i recognize that love is a commitment not a feeling and i recognize i will still love her even though i was upset and i was angry and not playing god and you know my mind just flash on how god could be so upset with us but he still loves us he could be upset with us he could be angry with us but he still loves us because he know we're gonna come true we're gonna come true so um so i don't build i believe as a family as a marriage it's two whole people supposed to get together hole in mind not some psychological problem and they need some kind of doctor to scrub your mind and whatnot nice problems you know you want to be made whole and you want to know how to approach these things so i'm not jumping here jumping here forgive me but we will share as we go along okay so we said for the lord my son despised not the chastening of the lord neither be weary of his correction for whom the lord loveth he corrected he must have fathered his son in whom he delighted happy is the man that finded wisdom and the man that get it understanding not not these words happy is the man that find that wisdom one and a man that gets understanding four the merchandise of it is better than the merchandise of silver and the gain thereof and find gold she is more precious than ruby and all things that god can't desire are not to be compared with her length of days in his hand he's talking wisdom understanding length of these is in her right hand in the left hand rich is an honor her ways are ways of pleasantness and all her parts have peace she's a tree of life to them that lay a hole upon her and happy is everyone that retained her this is the verse i want to get to verse 19. the lord by wisdom had founded the earth by understanding had he established the heavens by his knowledge the depths are broken up and the clouds drop down the dew three words i want to pull out of that wisdom understanding of knowledge let me read it again the lord by wisdom had founded the earth by understanding how to establish the heavens and by his knowledge the depths are broken up and the clouds drop down the jew but here what i want to do i want to reverse the order of how it is in school so i want to put knowledge first understanding second and wisdom to it because knowledge is information now if you have the knowledge but you do have the understanding or the comprehension you still can't go forward as to what to do so if you have to get it done or get the task accomplished you must have the knowledge you must have the understanding and then wisdom is applied knowledge wisdom is not knowledge wisdom is knowledge applied i call the prophet said hearing recognizing and acting upon the word of god oh like all the bible can have a for the vision make it plain that he that readeth it may run for example jesus he opened the word to them which was the knowledge and then he did what he opened the understanding because if the word is open and you don't have the understanding is that you know nothing so you have to have understanding that is why the vision has to be made clean it applies to business it applies to marriage it applies to your own life what is the vision and with the vision you have to apply knowledge and understanding what was the vision and joseph time seven years of plenty seven years of famine what do you apply them you have the knowledge then you have to apply you'll be understanding what do i do so i realize that you can't be really effective like oh but said you can't have faith if you're not sure of what you're doing so that is why the word after coming clarity that we could know exactly where we are at and where we are going that is why even though the disciples they were followers of jesus yet jesus post-resurrection ministry wrote clarity of the word and clarity of the purpose that they were reasoned for it brought clarity all of them had to hear it all of them had to hear it receive it and then go in the upper room to act on it because the word is now made plain and when the word is made plain to you then it's revealed to you what you must do understand this no one else can do it for you so stop looking at ministry and pastor and church and believers and this one and your brother and uncle and no that stop it understand that there are certain things only you can do nobody else the decisions are yours the choice is yours you know what i'm telling myself something what if it was the kind of religious cuckoo people could have now wrong in those days and hearing this vision of seven years of plenty and seven years of famine i wonder how they would present it to their people how would they share it uh i could imagine saw them say don't worry man god is god what is a good chord um some of them might ignore it and say i don't really know seven years of famine coming all this bountiful thing and you know people go in their own slant in their own way they lean on their own understanding not understanding this this mind of god you know he says thoughts is hard on our thoughts so we really can't present our thoughts we have to sort of embrace his thoughts his thoughts about his family his thoughts and and this is where i brought up this thing about and i had it in my nose here what love has to do with it the whole thing is cleaning whatever you do with that i love you i love you because if you like the cook i love you love that putting food in the butter or on a plate as something unless it is food prep and prepared and planned out and what not i mean love not cooking food somebody there could be food and this is where i think people don't cater for uh the how should i say it the the whole package that embraces this thing called family you know i remember years ago brother thought his wife was pregnant he was so in a such a state because he said he was you know what he pampers did he did he crying and he was cool and now i look back he's so funny he was just in such a typical he's not ready for next childhood who we you see so it's a package of god and if we can embrace and really enjoy how god's reflection of god in his people and how he wanted to express himself in this family and the earth and who we want to express himself through you you would see that god have a greater interest of expressing himself through you that you have an interest in making yourself available and if you see what we are sharing tonight you would want to make yourself available that the kingdom of god reflected on earth through you let's continue now all right praise the lord amen all right i want to read from saturn chronicles no this is not a bible study i'll just go into a line i'm still getting into where i want to i'll still head down that road this is second chronicles 1 seven to twelve in that night god appeared to son of man and said unto him ask what i shall give thee i find this is a very very interesting scripture and god knows what solomon need and yet he didn't just give him because he knew he needs it he wants to hear what solomon would ask for and solomon said unto god with it thou has shown great muslim to david my father and has made me to reign in his stead now o lord god let thy promise unto david my father be established for thou has made me king over a people like the dust of the earth and multitude give me now wisdom and knowledge that i may go out and come in before these people for who can judge this by people that is so great stop here a minute solomon end up to go out with a question who could judge our people that is so great you know there are some people don't like to ask questions because they don't want people to know they don't know they want to give the impression that they are knowledgeable and then something comes up instead of asking questions to get more knowledge or to get clarity or to get a greater understanding they kind of do like you know yeah yeah yeah yeah but they're clueless they don't know sometimes i don't know why they wouldn't ask questions and um maybe it's pride and sometimes you get us in church people do things without even asking a question there's a word for that that word is presuming as human authority assuming that you know assuming that it is okay to do this act this way and whatever it is i don't need to find out it's not really so and i think um you know you come like people calling about you i don't mean to bother you i saying that because people say that and i want you to stop that because that's not bothering that is what you're supposed to do if you don't know you find out you ask the elders that they cruiser you know the ministry and so on and find out and ask don't assume anything because i know you don't know i miss it again good that you'll get it i know you don't know and i know you don't know because i don't know i have to get from him so i know when you're praying you say hey toity when you're praying like you know it all you know that you know and let me just drop this in one time you know whatever statement um that's not true you know a young fool gets older he's an old folder you have people who the old but they're not wise at all so age is not has nothing to do with wisdom you know some old fools okay so wisdom because when joseph stand before pharaoh he was 30 not 60 he was a 30 year old man wisdom has nothing to do with age so forget it you could be 17 and wise 14 and wise 20 unwise 30 unwise do you want to be wise because we go in there and i'm going to read the scripture to get wisdom it is the principal thing but to get to wisdom you have to pass through the street of knowledge and understanding and then you could go on to wisdom road okay so praise the lord trust tonight would be uh helpful to you so let's continue now so solomon asks god give me now wisdom and knowledge that i may go out and come in before this people for who can judge this thy people that is so great and water to set a solomon because this was in thine heart and thou has not arcs riches wealth or honor nor the life of thy enemies that's a good one some people when they hit that show and through aya yaya is vengeance they make a sock salt if they gotcha they make it you know they really grow he said god even noted that that he didn't even ask for the life of his enemies neither yet has thou asked for long life but has asked for wisdom and knowledge for thyself wisdom and knowledge for who for thyself that thou must judge my people over whom i have made the king and look at this pronouncement in verse 12 wisdom and knowledge is granted unto thee oh give the lord a shout in the house wisdom just like that because he asked that is almost against an anointing just drop upon him and not enough wisdom and knowledge that is why you could write the book of proverbs that is why you could write all those books have you written solomon because wisdom and knowledge was granted unto him right there and there because your wisdom and knowledge is granted unto thee okay and i will give you riches and wealth and honor such as none of the kings have had that have been before thee neither shall there any after thee have the like okay oh my oh blessed be the name of the lord father i thank you now we come now to the scripture which is like around the boat okay proverbs 24 3 and 4. it says this here true wisdom is a house builded and by understanding it is established and by knowledge shall the chambers be filled with all precious and pleasant riches all blessed be the name of the lord this here is a cornerstone scripture about building a house home family whatever and the three words are right there true wisdom is a house builder by understanding it is established and by knowledge shall the chambers be filled with all precious and pleasant riches a wise man is surely a man of knowledge increasing strength for by wise counsel thou shalt make thy war and in multitude of counselors their safety wisdom is too high for a fool he opened it not his mouth in the gate he that devises to do evil shall be called a mischievous person the thought of foolishness is sin and the corner is an abomination to men if they'll faint in the day of adversity that strength is small but let me really amplify this verse 3 and 4. true skillful and godly wisdom is a house and having practice here a life a home a family is built and by understanding it is established on song and good foundation and by knowledge and its chambers of every area be filled with precious as pleasant riches so a house is established by treating you know those three things tonight knowledge understanding and wisdom the bible talk about a foolish woman were plucked in a house with her own hands a woman that lacked knowledge a woman that lacks understanding a woman that lacks wisdom the bible speaks of how to dwell with your wife with knowledge and with wisdom why would the scriptures put that in there i thought oh i could say this to me i don't believe that what love have to do with this i love he he loves me here but you still need knowledge you still need understanding you still need wisdom you know when you talk to your spouse male or female and they say i hear you they're listening ain't let me hear that i don't know if anybody overseas will understand that yeah yeah right yeah there is a vision you know they pass through this air and fly spiritually what they're acknowledging your mouth speaks something they are not dealing with the fact that they have not received it and i have my own experience myself i remember when i stuck with the baby i think three or four just walking and stuff and my wife was get tired and whatnot and i had a tape i went to one play or any message for somebody and she asked me if i could take take him with me and i said no but i didn't she tell her what you know what i was gonna do as such you know when i i left like you're in glory's program and you're doing things for the law or anything like that so going with the tape and please be taped and whatnot before you get blessed listen to me message come home life on the stage he's crying and stuff and as far as i concern i i totally lost business come back you know things that are supposed to be so i want to understand what is happening here so i say angering i said um i began to talk with her so this is where now communication okay we haven't touched that that's a major major thing so this is where now i'm beginning to communicate with her i didn't approach it as this where she cried here and she oh yes i wasn't able to load it she had to find she's selfish no i'm communicating with them see anri i said i i went to to to to play this tape and what i did not share with you where i go had modern might be slippery and someone to get up there to play this team and i don't think it was might be wisely isaac true to dear i said if i cheered up with you would have made a difference she said yes now i was foolish not to communicate to her what i was dealing with if i had done so i saved that whole atmosphere saved that whole drama because it means that i would have been sharing the story and some of us men i don't think men know we do that because we fail and the minority house you know explanation might also have to repent him that is not how love is church you see that's how we are to love our wives not as a model of your father but as christ love the church and give himself forth so then that taught me to be how to communicate fully and i remember you know telling me things and i come from i hear you and you know i just going through my motion and then one day i said could you say that again you know what's happening there i begin to pay attention and sometimes and i can say this to you why is that husband you see if you're talking to your husband and he do you need phone so yeah yeah and you have to be phonics doing so he's not listening to you tell him put down that phone you want his undivided attention and when and when i began to listen i realized that fear of a self was not clearly communicated and sometimes women feel men are mind readers just sometimes and um i don't have the gift of written light unless your thoughts come to your mouth i don't know what you're thinking i do have that gift and sometimes men may feel women may feel men you know when vice versa but the thing i want to get to is this you are only talking talk and communication is not this ending when you talk that's your word when you communicate the person you are communicating to understands i think i'll say it again you could talk and you're talking is your words so when you are talking to your husband or you're talking to your child or cousin or sister or brother and you want to communicate to them ask god to give you the right words to give you how to say it to them that they will understand what you are saying because sometimes we are speaking but it has not been communicated and when it's being communicated because i see it i see clearly what you're saying so the burden is now shared the burden is understood because it has been communicated do you get what i'm sharing tonight will blessed be the name of the lord i hope that this helps someone here all right blessed be the name of the lord so our lives are shaped by who raised us our parents we ourselves we are part of this thing called relationships that's what we are we we function we we this is what connects us to others and so on and in that deer sometimes relationships becomes difficult and challenging sometimes it's communication issues we are not sharing what we're supposed to share and we assume things and presumed things and it is not what we presume and assumed and because of that we react i remember i don't know why you gotta forgive me in doing this sleep and doing this session to be i have to talk from my own experience i'm not trying to talk about me perceive but i could only speak from my own experience and i remember the time when i turned it something and i i gave him some licks and my wife was very upset she was very upset and she called my side in the bedroom she said don't you ever pull up like that again with them you know don't do that like that and i felt bad um how i did it something something happened something broken and something like that and after that i never did that i always postpone let's say discipline i wish i would deal with that tomorrow so now when i said that i will be out of the emotions of the moment so i can manage it from a sober clean unemotional state put your hands out get put to lakshmi's hand instead of reacting in the emotions and many times we react in our emotions and and that is not right that is not how it's supposed to be i should say it is more okay i will say right and wrong but i feel this way you know paul see i'll show you a more excellent way the better way is to get out of that atmosphere wait till it cool off and everything else and then from a sober you know balanced position you could deal with issues and challenges this is how god wants it to be real to be original to be authentic you know to be a son you see not all songs are the same in disposition and spirit and from what we see from our own parents and parent we learn you know i never saw my father hit my mother i never saw my father mistreat my mother i i i had a great experience um you know with with the family arrangement that i was born into and grew up into it was a big family a family of 12 and i'm the ninth of a family of 12. and it was quite i can't remember lovey-dovey for my father by time i come it's everybody in front you know and um you know you just have to run your run and do your do and press on but here we are all adults you know people some have gone on and different things but this is life and it comes to our tool and what we will do and many times you hear stories of people's behavior connected to something rainy past uncle aunt or the tree team and all this psychological trash that you don't want to get rid of you want it you want to hold on to it and some of you need to get rid of it you want to hold on and this is what i want to challenge you tonight and if if you get anything over this tonight i want to challenge you to be knowledge understanding and wisdom if you don't have knowledge get it if you don't have understanding ask god get it if you do have wisdom get it you want knowledge you want the information not misinformation like i see one of these senators in america they have a video on him now talking years ago of um he never teached it in school but he was he used to spread misinformation he used to tell them things that he knew not coming to send his opponents the wrong way so i guess if the teacher is going to teach on chicken he might tell them the teachers are going to bring an exam on frogs so when i'm studying frogs he's studying chicken you see so that they wouldn't study teaching supposed study and i say that as a backdrop of if ever there was a time of misinformation this information is now with facebook with the internet and everything else but here we have the word crystal clear there is no misinformation or disinformation this is the word this is god and i want you to see it by god's grace oh blessed be the name of the lord wow so therefore all this thing about relationship and marriage is not taught in school you see so now we are starting with husbands who don't know how to respond to the complaint of their wives and because they don't know or not taught how they remain silent and ignore the complaints or deal with the issues and the wife expecting a certain response and this is not dear i remember brother telling me his wife's not responding and this and that i said oh say i said what to do i said um share with us things this week don't expect any response just share things as seeds share things to her and by the end of the week he called me backstroke fighters he said he seems like a like a reap i say exactly i said you as a male as a soul she is a female is like a soil a prompter so i remember when my wife wrote over to get down in trouble saying all this but um with isaac nursing exactly and so on and i would she wanted to stop on a different thing and i would get articles and sort of read for and share with her the value of breastfeeding and different things and different things young or 21 22 and afterwards it struck me but if i could share these things i could share these scriptures i could share the word and i would come and say angry listen to this here hear the scripture here here what this is just rebuild things and stop these things and when she would go down to sport spain or so wooden tongue she would go in a bookstore and read something and say you know what i read so and so and so up to now i'm talking about up to tonight we are still sharing things we still are sharing things she reads she has no time for television and movies and stuff she reads she listens something everything is to edify to build up to strengthen knowledge understanding because you are preparing yourself you want to have wisdom wisdom how to use this knowledge the secret is what the word is in the bride and she has one the mind of christ what is that god's wisdom to know what to do with the word so i hope tonight that you would get a grasp this is an overview this is more like i say we make it a broad canvas um we could go into other areas um tips and tools and things are splitting into marriage just pretend the finances that's presented whatever but tonight we we talk about life and godliness just sharing some stuff with you and hope that it is edifying to you these things i wouldn't preach these things i wouldn't say try to teach it but i'm trying to bring a picture to you that you would have a clear understanding that these three ingredients is needed in our marriage is needed in a relationship if the wife don't have knowledge problems if the husband don't have knowledge problems if the wife don't have understanding problems if the wife don't have the this problem if there's no wisdom there it is problems one of the hardest things for me as a pastor in dealing with marriage and counseling and so on is to see two people in a relationship in a marriage and none that help the other that is a nightmare a nightmare nobody want to give in everybody want to hold their position nobody want to say you know what i'm sorry you know and start from there everybody want to be the man or the woman and you know i mean present me and personally when they check it out no the person comes from a rebellious kind of atmosphere and they bring that same rebellion to their house and you know i what about them is correct thank god for selling that 20 or 20 prophet he said that don't change you just only change the dwelling place whenever you are here you'll be across me and it's true you know people come from different backgrounds and so on come together and you know you expect it to work instantly you expect everything to do quite smoothly it's not like that and this is where a lot of things are caught and not taught so as we share our stories as we share our lives it makes such a huge difference in how we communicate how we love how we serve how we encourage how we care for others how we care for people i have never seen it any time that we help others that we don't get back help ourselves never every single time this is amir and i our experience when we help others we get help our own selves unless if you have never done that try it don't just look out for your own your own self no help somebody else encourage somebody okay all right time is running down and i have some stuff here okay first peter tree i want to read here likewise first one likewise he wise being subjection to your own husbands that if any obeying on the word they also may not without the word be won by the conversation of their wives not talk that's the life of the wife so therefore if a husband is not really in the faith you gotta be more spiritual to say well yeah body would heal listen to he and no no no no no you know as long as you're intelligence god and carrying away the foolishness what while they behold your chaste conversation or life covered with fear whose adorning let it not be the outward adornment of platinum here of wearing of gold and putting on power but let it be the hidden man of the heart in that which is not corruptable even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit which is the sight of god is the great price for after this manner in the old time the holy woman who trusted in god or dawned themselves being in subjection unto their own husbands even as cyril b abraham calling him lord whose daughter's here as long as you do well i'm not afraid with any amazement but this is the verse i want to get to all these other voices that apply yes so i'm not going there tonight there's other verses but this is what i want to get to likewise he husbands dwell with them according to knowledge knowledge of what i remember dealing with a couple of years ago and the wife was saying he will you want me to say forgive um you want me to say sorry and i don't want to say sorry and uh if i say sorry you go make him feel like if he's somebody and something like that so i asked a question i said have you ever studied about the male a man i said have you ever read a book about men she says no so begin to talk a little further i said you know god made man man woman woman and sometimes a woman want the man to think like a woman i said you know in her mind she believes he is supposed to think like her and sometimes the man think the wife's supposed to be like a man because he want her to think like him he's not accepting the fact that in female and designation and feminist and spirit she has her own way of processing things and thinking so when i'm gonna talk to her i recognize she was void of the knowledge of what makes this male tick i was very unfortunate because when i begin to share you know she tells me i should write a book actually write a book but to me that is information or knowledge she should have had and there are many ways without knowledge and they go back they go to the instinct and they just do what they'll do but they never take time off to know what makes this little thick you could beat the cockroach up and kill the cockpit you could beat the lizard up and kill the wizard and play champion but if you leave the man to do it he feel like a more champion so let him do certain things you know and and and and and let him feel that certain kind of a way but of course some people are you waiting for him a group for himself a year can you do it for yourself and he feel less than you know a lot of things that i'm not going there tonight tonight is not a night for that i just make enough point but the point about it is this we have to be able to operate with knowledge and if we don't have the knowledge we find ourselves operating short in understanding our wives understanding the children understanding what's happening in school because we don't have the knowledge so we say do that and you know an appearance says why you say because i say so you use imports because you say the child asks why because a child wants an understanding because you're presenting things that they don't understand and you're making pronouncement to them and their lives and the environment and you're trying to get understanding and instead and because you don't know how to explain it or share it or give it you say because i say so they try to say okay and in the child mind you said he only owned because you know what i mean they reject that they don't understand that they're trying to comprehend where they're coming from but if you ever say you know why son here's the reason why okay because such and such and such and such and you can try to say daddy i know understand and that is how you bring that kind of understanding let me see how i could wrap up here oh praise the lord blessed be the name of the lord okay so likewise you husband dwell with them according to knowledge in the amplified speak about in like money you married women be submissive to your own husbands subordinate yourselves as being secondary to and dependent on them and adapt yourselves to them so that even if they do not obey the word of god they may be won over by not by discussion but by godly lies of their movies and when they observe the pure and modest way in which you conduct yourself together with your reverence for your husband you are to feel for him all that reverence includes to respect refer to revere him to honor esteem appreciate prize and in human sense to adore him that is to admire praise be devoted to deeply love and enjoy your husband let not yours be merely an external adorning uh with elaborate interweaving and nothing of the year there were enough jewelry or change of clothes but let it be the inward adorning and beauty of the hidden prison of the heart with the incorruptible and unfeeding charm of a gentle and peaceful spirit which is not anxious or wrought up but is very precious in the sight of god for it was thus that the pious woman of all who hoped in god were accustomed to beautify themselves and was submissive to their husbands adapting themselves to them as themselves secondary and dependent upon them it was thus that sarah obeyed abraham following his guidance and acknowledging his head shape over her by calling him lord master leader authority and you are now her two doctors if you do right and let nothing terrify you not given with hysterical fears or letting anxieties annuive you in the same way you married men should live considerately with your wives with an intelligent recognition or marriage relation honoring the woman as physically the weaker but realizing that you are joint ears of the grace of god god's unmerited faith and life finally all of you should be of one of the same mind okay no sorry on puerto meridian fever in order that your prayers may not be hindered and cut off so therefore husbands imagine god put the treatment of your wife in connection with your prayer life and if you don't do it right or get it right your prayer would actually be hindered and if anything satan won is your prayer to be hindered because the prayer is what give god the opportunity to work and to do on your behalf that is why it's very interesting what god asked solomon ask me what you want me to give you and solomon asks the right thing god can't just give things he wants you to ask this is what this is about when you hear the word what do you ask god when you hear truth what do you ask god what do you tell god let's head to home stretch here are we going to wrap up finally all of you should be of one of the same mind united in spirit sympathizing with one another loving each other's brethren of one household compassionate and courteous and tenderhearted and humble never return evil for evil insults for insult scolding tongue lashing be written but on the contrary blessed praying for their welfare happiness and protection true repeating and loving them for know that this you have been called you are yourself inherit the blessings of god oh blessed be the lord oh hallelujah so listen proverbs 4 5 1 unknown says get wisdom get understanding forget it not need a decline from the words of my mouth first they cannot she shall preserve thee lover she shall keep the
