appreciate all the specialists even the ones that sang tonight my beautiful all the college leaders the musicians everyone so may God richly bless you playful brother a man he needs you tonight so I got a little subject here tonight so if it you why are you standing I normally read from the Old Testament to the new but I'm gonna start from the new ending up to the old so we're gonna read 1st John 1 second Corinthians 6 and Micah verse 6 so if you have your Bibles we're gonna read 1st John first John one and breathe verse three to seven that which we have seen an earth declare we unto you that he also may have fellowship with us and through our fellowship is with the father there's a little feedback someone is what the father and with his son Jesus Christ and these things right we unto you that your joy may be full this then is the message which we have heard of him and declare unto you that God is light and in him is no darkness at all if we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lie and do not the truth but if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have fellowship one with another and the blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanses us from all sin isn't that beautiful didn't we have some wonderful fellowship this weekend my water place meets being and then we turn to second Corinthians from verse 66 verse 16 and what agreement they had the temple of God with idols for ye are the Temple of the Living God as God has said I will dwell in them and walk in them so I'm emphasizing that walk in them and I will be their God and they shall be my people wherefore come out from among them and be separate saith the LORD touch not the unclean thing and I will receive you and and will be a father unto you and ye shall be my sons and daughters saith the Lord God Almighty and then Michael chapter six and we read from verse seven and eight with the Lord we please were thousands of rams over ten thousands of rivers of oil shall I give my firstborn for my transgression the fruit of my body for the son of my soul years show thee O man what is good and what does the Lord require of thee watch what he requires but just to do justly to love mercy and to walk humbly with thy God make order replacing the word you may be seated [Music] so tonight I want the enemy to know it's a prayer line but I want him to know brother brems is the weakest christian the weakest we're not even speaking of the eros yet but the weakest christian can defeat satan any way any time and under any circumstances so tonight I know he's in trouble brother because the weakest Christian is going to drive him out tonight hallelujah so tonight I like to take a title walking with God amen and I'd like to take a subject fellowship that was broken but fellowship restored and I got inspiration restored to an Eden condition so tonight I don't know this is such a well although two hours seven but I hope I can speak like you and everything so we will have to watch with the perspiration when it yields two hours he said okay so he says here now we we got you got to travel with me and we go to the Garden of Eden and we looking from the outside in and we see this beautiful picture and then I can hear a speaking our God of Adam telling Eve and then I can hear him say dear do you see the Sun is setting it's time that we talk to the father so they went up to the Cathedral a great tree as they knelt down all of a sudden a heavenly growing light came down the logos the holy spirit that had brewed them out of the earth came down father God and he said children have you enjoyed yourself today [Music] my so father's having fellowship with his son with his children and then Adam says yes father and then he says I've come down to kiss you goodnight and to lay you down to to rest tonight so he kissed him on the cheeks laid him down nothing good on them he was right in the bushes with him the lion and he laid the lion down and he laid the chips are down and the tiger down and laid them all down to rest and father was so pleased so you can mention while they laying their fathers walking around the man is looking in his oh my so beautiful he's so pleased and he's so happy and we're looking at this beautiful picture and in the beginning when God came down in the evening and talked to Adam and Eve in the cool of the day and his great voice whispered to them and they had fellowship so brother Lou you you spoke on the net the three things fellowship eternal life and inheritance but I want to dwell tonight mostly on fellowship because fellowship always brings results it gives birth to something I mean so he says here and there fellowship loves one another all the moving of the Spirit went through the bushes the Lions come up the Tigers and all of them and they worship the Lord man was conscious at all time that the presence was with him hallelujah then he says here he says and in the beginning when man used to walk in the early age with God in the Garden of Eden when the first man was created in that Greek great Cathedral under the palms he and his wife when the cool of the evening come along they come out and worship God had a perfect fellowship God longs for fellowship and by the overdue you said God wanna save us more than what we want to be saved well he says now he small fellowship than what we were at one fellowship tonight Wow you came in here tonight to worship me you're not going to get anything if you sit in their own data you're gonna have to worship Him and travel soup with him and show him that you love him that's how you get something from God you conscious of his presence hallelujah and the process and even his wife and the cool of the evening come along they came out worship God and perfect fellowship God longs for fellowship and I'm here tonight if that was in the beginning we had the end again now so now we at the end is the spirit day in the beginning God loved fellowship now we are the last sage the climate's God still loves fellowship and he's coming down the game in the so mega prime to do what to have fellowship so if you know in the fellowship parties were raised up somebody to take your place and they go they gonna worship Him hallelujah he says he is he wants people to speak with him to talk with him he says you you might sing too much or you might preach too much sometime but they've there's one thing you'll never be able to overdo and that is to pray he says here he says I'm gonna leave the books arches going quickly now that the beginning of man that what God gave him power over everything on the earth now through the fall he lost the power now we watching at this picture something went wrong and then through the fall he lost that power then he become unconscious of the fact after losing his relationship so fellowship brings relationship so he lost that and friendship fellowship with the father he lost that and all these channels become clogged up and he couldn't get through and then losses are reaching in the count in his relationship and fellowship means communion with God was cut off right there because of sin and unbelief and unbelief is what in the world of Almighty God and so this picture was painted and out back there through our first father and mother they fell and that broke of fellowship with God and man was thrown from the Garden of Eden from that hour and began to scream and God came down Adam Adam we are though he was hunting for his lost child now I like the swing element he felt God even sent an angel hallelujah he didn't send an angel in each sent David no car came down himself because it was his child that was lost and God didn't it wasn't against God knew he's gonna fall God knew this gonna something is gonna go wrong but you see man always runs from God there's no man that seeks God there's no man that says eyes like I saw God and I know God so you owe tonight to you the voice of God calling you and the way loud when are you hiding what are you hiding behind now what what more what made you realize you make it so there's a voice calling out my opinion why is lost child now it was striking it's not that God didn't know because God created his only enemy come on you must grease back to me it was breeze back to me this God we serve created his own enemy so because now there's a challenge going on it took God six thousand years to create the Eden and his own enemy came right into God's Eden after six thousand years and corrupted Eve and took them out of Eden so God see I must be just and give my enemy the same time so he gave him another six thousand years and he creates that Satan's even so now you mustn't be shocked what we hear and what we see versus Satan's even this is not the one that God prepared now we go into a city brother a plan you wanna where there's no Sunna with his no sorrow with his legs and pain so we mustn't be shocked when we this happened and that happened versus Saint in Ceylon but brother you have to tell you I always hear God's voice and ammmm when avow God comes like it's a third season hallelujah God comes right in second season you know what's he doing he's calling out the second Eve ladies say concede and God comes right back and he says come on come on my child you don't belong to the Satan's Eden you come from another dimension you come from another place you mock Nigerian you're not South African you're not Trinidadian you're not German you're not American you come from my heavenly place that's where you were original and that's where you're going back to my so God knew what was going to happen because any was attributes and he couldn't do it if there was no for you are the same how could he be a same as there was in the sinner how could it be a healer if it there's no one's sick so we allowed that to prove to the enemy listen man I'm greater than you you can make them sick but I can heal them Oh hallelujah you can make them son in you can make him do the most vodka but you see my blood is gonna forgive them and look at them standing here tonight you know where you come from El sudden comes short of the glory of God but the power God pulled us from the gutters of Al and he saved us hallelujah and any changes so he's here this contest is between God and Lucifer but this power is made manifest in the church you would me that's what I say we have to walk with God but the scripture says I'll walk with you so it's a it's a two-way street this I'll be their God they will be my people I'll walk in them and he says all I ask for you is just to walk humbly don't bring me a thousand dreams don't give me a rivers of oil now I don't one bit just be humble and show mercy and walk humbly before me God hates a proud spill it man we all know thunder will take short of the glory of God how can I feel I'm bigger than you make me small you know we all see that in heavenly places in Christ Jesus there's no big you in Smoky no we are all the same [Applause] Wow so he says you know notice in his glory back there when he had sinned God lived he also sorry for the poor fellow seaman Eve going away going out of the fellowship they would have to shop for themselves what could they do they had a loving father who would take care of them but now through disobedience got old fellowship no more fellowship they had to make it for themselves they had to tell the soil there to earn a living by the sweat of their brow they had to get sick and dying in all kinds of troubles holidays and disappointments why sever fellowship no more fellowship with God it couldn't be so now the guy must shop for himself oh he says he never had to be sick he never had to die he never had a worry he never had a headache he never had fear he just climbed up in the arms of the Father and just like a child everything was his and whatever he asked he just got it why everything Oh baby because he was God's child and the child is an heir of all things that's why in Dominion he was God's child but when it was 7 all of that was lost now we had to hear to fend for himself and son son broke that fellowship man has been tossed from he says about from every wind of doctrine and he still tossed about you are turned out of the Garden of Eden to shift for himself and then this in the next great time he's still talking about God kills some animal took the skins innocent blood of an animal brought the skins and wrapped them around Adam and Eve and there was some fellowship with them again what so God realizes look I can't leave them completely cut off so he makes a tempura he's a temporal condition okay I strained the lamb that would be the condition the blood and are covered in skins and promises as he walked out to the Garden of Eden you could hear the sheep skin eating against their brow and God felt so sorry and the blood running down dishes but that was a temporal position for them to come back into fellowship and speak again with God and the Fellowship again why through the shed blood of the Lamb hallelujah oh brother I feel a song coming on me he says denomination barriers will never work because you've got two eases you go to this church and modeski nomination education science God made one preparation for man to be restored back to fellowship nothing else he offered to the human race but the blood was the way back to fellowship and I say tonight in 2018 there's only one way back to fellowship brother he's not real Church is not real group it's not real pastor it's not through your church you manage

like the Son of God then the father came down what was it I'd like to hear that conversation can you imagine what they were speaking about hallelujah maybe say congratulations making every second gratulations congratulations he saluted them maybe I don't know what to do my brother says they maintained in the face of their tribe they maintained their fellowship you see I see no trial we give up

in our trials you don't pray we don't we become angry with God we don't even our don't because you don't answer praise with things don't go our way we stay away from fellowship drugs should make you better and not butter the past I don't see for a whole month and is wondering where you are because you going through a trial but you became better now you almost hate the children of God and you angry with him because God did not super shame on you - shame on you not one person here not even the pastor has got anything to do with your soul when it comes to salvation is that way so you can end with any person young you don't want to speak with them there's something wrong with your experience you need to be at the altar hallelujah my there was Daniel I'm skipping up when you're pretty as usual not because the king now put out the law that anyone train will be someone so find no you went to play as usual I like that we only play when we need God promises we make him a mascot Lord my child is sick please come but he played is usually opened the windows even but the princess he wasn't ashamed he opened the windows so they could he ain't brain and they set the trap for him and what did you think hallelujah my they threw me to a like a lion's den and the next one when he came the angle was lame my relaxing on a lion why the pull of fire came down brother you see when you stand for God God's things for you I wrote here brother Isaac that you know when you you have a child and a child is learning to walk and he fall he says you don't be the child because it's trying to walk you help him up and you say this is how you do it my boy come so you are and your oldest hands you begin to guide him he said well that's what God does when we form and make mistakes he don't beat us he says come on child I know you can walk I know you can overcome that trial I know you can deliver now I know you can be set free many hold hands and he guides you oh we need to walk with Jesus we need to stop walking with one another we become klemish in the church I'm only with this group and I'm only with that group but there shouldn't be no clinician asleep it's a spirit man because now we clannish me only with that group and we leave the poor ones out they not in our circle they don't foot shame on you you must go to their poor bring it in bring them in your fellowship in your circle and a fellowship for them give them a phone call and says come on come over to my house and have a cup of tea but we become clannish we only ended up with that group [Applause] right brothers we have our circle friends and only them but the downline outs we don't worry brother it's time we go to the down-and-out they the ones that love God they the ones that has an experience and you are knowing them positively you don't speak about the church you don't speak about the part you speak about that God they change your life and the miracle that happened that's what we do brother hallelujah then he says now Christ did you ever stop to think what Christ has redeemed us for he gave us everlasting life and brought us back to eternal fellowship now the picture change yes the second Adam now but now he dies for a purpose because man was out of fellowship but now he brings him back into fellowship and because the eternal fellowship and relationship to God to be sons and daughters again to restore back all that Adam lost in the for now the picture changes the second enemies on the other hallelujah the same logos that breed Adam brutally and they fell then God so men can't come back so this God he said someone similar he says so many men wants to be a God like Buddha and conscience can you can read all about them they want to because I know someone in Johannesburg they want to be God but listen there was only one God that wanna be man there was only one man one God that wannabe like you and me and he became our kinsman redeemer that's why he understands we can ever hit it he understands when you break through your trial we understand you're burning in your heartaches and you'll swallow one God becoming man you know one of the purposes the funeral of name remember when the lady was coming in thus only son I died but my says he was standing at the well he said about that day and I headache Christ so he knows what it is they were addict he became human flesh she became like you and I chose so he understands our pain he bears with you because you his son he's not gonna throw your way it's like but all who said even if that son is a drunkard is thrown your son I can't this only miss my son if I have to go pick him up with atropine I go because it's my son oh you know the story makes me so emotional to think that God came down to our level who don't scheme become like you and me so he could suffer in and feel the pain of death and the agony and what he went through because he was God becoming man when I think of all the men that want to be God oh man forget it I don't want the God of flesh like that man I want the God of heaven that bears with me that understands me when I'm bringing through my trial in my test when I'm at my lowest she knows how to encourage me he knows how to lift me up he knows how do they look at me and set me free when I'm bound by alcohol and my habits and I'm bound by pornography and lust and all the world I don't like you might be the lowest man might become my pain the toughest oh I send this in from the dead my god DZ skirt metal yeah scrap metal brother and he removes it and he melts it and he makes a beautiful masterpiece and you say said the same guy yes you wrote him over you demote but God comes back to us and look top [Applause] [Music] [Applause] now I lived this one I wanted to keep it for first but I wanted to bring forth before this first guy there was one guy in the Old Testament that found the secret and if you support us so you know whom I'm talking about and the Bible says he walked with God he walked with God every morning he caught up you walked with God he loved in the days of Noah but the fear I was right reading brother and says his name is Enoch and Enoch was Noah's grandfather can you imagine so we knew when anak was raptured they know I begin with a hug and he says Noah was a type of the Jews but anak he found the secret and when he found the secret how to walk with God God says I better take him I better take this man because if more people is going to find out more people will be raptured but you see here that type because he was a seven from oh my goodness he was a seven from anima and he walked with God he found the secret how to walk with God and God says one day Riley was walking he see the Kings Highway and he just kept walking and he walked up into clothing God says come on come on you know come come come come I don't want em to find them I don't want them to find the secret and in the perimeter come on in up on the pyramid so it was every secret every month we eat there so he knocked new in your how to walk with God oh yes something beautiful man and in a walk with God and his feet he the keys our way and it just took him home you know he's the type of the pride and he was raptured and so will this right be raptured one of these mornings between 6:00 and 9:00 they say about Enoch they say you know he was he says you know he was for God and God took him Genesis 5:24 that's why I didn't wanna read it because I kept it the original Hebrew meaning for walk implies of Enoch went to and fro with God continually conferencing with him and growing constantly now we always think you know when I have you know the picture in my mind I almost thought he was in the armored some whether it's easy then if he's living in a cave on the mountain someone then it's easy but here what they say they say he continually confess with him coming closer to enemy we see a new kind of believer he walked arm-in-arm every day with the Lord the Lord was his very life so much so that the end of his life he did not taste death but he was translated out of this life Hebrews 11:5 inoculant to walk pleasingly before God in the mass of a wicked society so Enoch wasn't separated he was my defines the people and the Bible says it was in the days of Noah so that maybe knock loved in the days of Noah when they were eating drinking keeping in marriage that's a time he loved tea but he found the secret how to offer God he'd wake up in the morning said good morning father I'm ready to take a walk with you and but they say I mean on they soothed what a beautiful picture man come on give us cried he's gonna be like you know we're gonna walk I mean our God you better find the secret your consciousness is coming back how can get to that level I feel a shot on me man you know to Bella come over before someone else finds that secret and brother Theo says that that vision is for a time so take him home and then in the end time after many many years yet comes Malachi for and it gives us the revelation how to walk with God how do we change it would make those second unknown thunders to keep the bride rapture in free will show up to go people say what's happening now to read to be faith is preparing you for the manchild come on young people I don't want you something I'm watching you I want in your feet now I'm speaking of the bride I'm speaking about you you better be on fire for God man [Music] [Applause] you know every pastors burden is for the young people and you think we waste time to come here and preach we tired we really lots of money to get here but every time we come here we want to say something that will help you set you free and pull it out to the world hallelujah so he found a way he says ordered man with all the same problems same burdens we carry not the Hermit hidden away in the wilderness cave he was involved in life with a wife children obligations and Anna took all his responsibilities so he wasn't a man apart he loves like that one day a wife children all these responsibilities and obligations he undertook he cared for his family he worked in monastery occupied but he was not earthbound come on now he coming home too many of us he said Bomba though we eat you know ten packs too deep we want this and once we wear that we want that and once you have that we know you put in your pegs too deep don't become a volume of promises this journey you don't back in you back out back out man back on the damage back out that that burdens all those troubles that cotton trouble backing out you don't need that there's already prepared hallelujah there's a whole ready for you but oh but they need to see my house yet hallelujah you must see mine on the other side you might have seen the street I'm gonna love it yeah you better get there man brother and sister I'll go with you brother over and by the Holy Fellowship for 10,000 years and he looked like he was gone just a second me to my father's house [Applause] [Music] hallelujah none of the demands of his life could keep him from his walk with God in this spirit so that's beautiful nothing kept him bound though he was the earth man with all the obligations we have yet he knew our how to get lighter Enoch was was not a part of this wicked world each day as he walked with the Lord he became less attached to the things below like Berlin tied daily to this earthly life and he was taken up in his spirit to a heavenly realm and all around it not mankind grew increasingly ungodly yet this man changed into wild beasts full of lust hardness and sensuality Enoch became more and more like the one with me he walked oh don't you wanna walk with him all right you're the voice speaking don't you wanna walk with me instead of walking with those friends that's leading you away from God you beginning to dress like them you beginning to look like them you begin to smell like the world Egyptian air style Egyptian clothing the world is slowly kill opinion and you cooling off and you don't even know it but you see in okay the revelation the more he was living like that the more later he became so that's easy for you to be rapture but lighter you become brother sister and you have less of the Seas of the world sisters are you yummy you have less of the things of the world you don't want to look like your friend at work no I want to look like Jesus I'm a daughter of God I wanna be a son of God I don't want this Egyptian in science no you know became more like the one that whom evil walked that we had no Bible no songbook no fellow member no teacher no heed well in Holy Spirit yet Enoch knew God we have so many people around us we have wonderful pastors it manases the word every week in okay nobody nobody and yet he became untouched but you see there to be one in the Old Testament to type the bride in the new to say so then I realize but though there was someone they found the secret of how to get out of here and when God saw no he says no you know come come come you you better come home and it took him home one of these mornings we need 609 you're gonna eat the keys away or maybe fall in why aren't you at work between 6:00 and 9:00 that is not that working but it's not an awesome and I'm trying him on his cell phone now his cell phone is in the car he just disappeared no he didn't disappear he was raptured she was raptured and the Baptist's coming for you with me there's a promise of God and you know you and you going to be raptured well the vehm says a man can so silver caught they don't tell the devil don't know what to do with it you know when you've gone your knees up the devil is in trouble he way you wake up in the morning you're on your knees is always a wake up a oh he's playing again the devil the devil shakes when he sees that he's shaking unite I'm telling you because spirits have been exposed and he's got the people bound but tonight they're gonna be set free do you ever stop to think what Christ redeemed us for he gave us everlasting life he brought us back brother Olu to the eternal fellowship watch now this time it's eternal fellowship so God can't lose you we can't save you today they know he's gonna lose you know he can't so it's eternal fellowship and you might backslide and be in the world and make the stake you find it goes right after you in the Sabinas right after you hallelujah you find out you something next to the kinda guy say but aren't you in the message what are you doing here right let's go come on man you can run but you can't hide where's the Holy Spirit that's on your track and he's gonna get you oh I don't go to home there's so much there that I got you on Christ how we try to cleanse the church that he might live in and a fellowship with his heart is greater for fellowship than ours so God is closer than your right arm you think God is all from you brother says these like closer then you're right down it's right in your heart don't get tired I'm going to close you know I'm gonna skip a lot of things and I want to wind up I will show you here that we going back to Eden and we had I eaten conditioned on the earth and God had to demonstrate it before we leave to show there's a harvest coming and they will be the same I want you to stand I want everyone to stand I want you to listen to this please young people do me a favor you're not doing it for moving God sees us and I'm skipping a lot of things and I'm going to write to the right to that to an even condition because Romans 8:26 for the creature was made subject to vanity God knew you can afford the creature was made such a brother to fall there's nothing you can do God knew it but he knew in your heart is the same term that's why when it comes to predestination this is not even your own choosing no man can come to the Father unless my father draws him so it's not even your own choice I have the code there okay then he says how there's something beyond the veil yonder that pulls a Christian he can't explain it he doesn't understand it himself but there is something in that fellowship that he was with Christ that's why Christ in John 7 is his father he says I want them to be where we are that was his desire you wanted fellowship with you he says Lord can't it be with I am and let them be one like you on Iowa you see so God wants fellowship and you don't give him enough fellowship and that's why we have less prayers answered the law we're gonna yield ourselves he said sister do the dishes quickly and once it's done go back to

tell them around thought is able to deliver them what to make a lady out of a gentleman bring him in also card and you'll be worshiping God and praising God brother basis you know these people in Hell

threefold purpose brizola you quoted it and it says the thirdly is to restore the kingdom to its rightful position they fell by son by the first element back to where he walked in the cool of the evening with his people have talked with him fellowshipped what wouldn't today God hasn't promised the fellowship through the Methodists or through the Baptist's through the Pentecost he promised fellowship in Christ Jesus that's where your fellowship ease hallelujah and brother man says God was lonely lonely but it'll never be lonely again because his attributes are made manifest now he has fellowship and these are some mixed audience my son Luke was in annoyance but I couldn't fellowship with him until he was expressed then he came and I held him as a baby who and I could and I spoke

just hook me out but I moved like that to show him I'm alive I'm alive tonight I worship Him I worship Him I worship Him I'm alive so you've ever make love back to the logos or his brooding oh I'm coming through this night I'm gonna come just to show you where ever even condition [Music] Oh hallelujah he says the doctor say you're gonna die he says walk with God the doctor said you got cancer he says walk with God he says the doctor says you got diseases is what he says I'll never leave you nor forsake you I'll be with you even to the end of the world he says yeah yeah he says you don't have to you do he says you will have your ups and downs listen now I'm closing but don't worry you've got to go through briar patches over sharp rocks over the bluffs down over the youth side up through the mountains over the waters but walk with God hallelujah no they come they knock on your door yes such a smile but your veins are not pain they don't even know it because you're going through dry patches up the mountain Bluffs sharp rocks he says but I walk with God yes sir there's so many hills to climb upward you've heard the whole song but now it will seem so little when I get to the end of the way my hallelujah now young come to something I'm close enough are you tired will you stand for this please god bless you thank you mother's I want you to get this if you must everything get this you remember brother Branham was on the mountain and there was a blizzard and he told the brothers when the blizzard heat heat run for the camp because he says you can't even see a foot in front of you I'm going to show you eaten conditioned yes sir oh I love this and you know what all your admin do Gloria those seven sons of sceva that wanted to drive all those Devils in the name of Jesus whom you pour a preach port so he says but Jesus I know and Paul and I warned you but you see the devil's knows William Brennan he tormented Satan's Kingdom so the blizzard starts eating and and everyone starts and brother Ben begins to run down himself and he told them heat for the camp because once it starts it's gonna wipe us out watch he's a man now and this is in God's codes for a total separation from unbelief he says and while I was doing that I heard a voice say that said I am the God of heaven who created the heavens in the earth so he's running now but he has a voice I'm the I'm the one that created heaven than Earth and he says here and I chopped off my head my cap and I just said stew now listen again and I thought that was in the wind oh it was brewing and making a noise and I heard it again I am the one that stilled the winds upon the mighty sea watching hallelujah oh yes yes an adopted son on the air and God could speak to him anytime Oh God and I heard it again it said and the one who stole the wings upon the mighty sea I'm the one that creator watches the next words I created the squirrels in your presence [Applause] yo others voices telling him so in other words it wasn't you that spoke it I'm the one that creates if I count the stones I create that occur squirrels you spoke you asked me oh god this is gonna finish the enemy man this is the death ball to show this will not be another even he's taking us back to another even condition brother he's bringing sons and daughters of God to the stature of a perfect man where they have faith and virtue and knowledge and temples and patience and godliness and broadly kind of a challenge himself so the brightest green up she's not gonna stay mature she's not meet you there come on she's coming through instead of a perfect man she's growing transformation isn't just over one night he brought honey years from Luther to restore that three thousands of years but now with this bride brother oh he's bringing up oh no now listen to this please remain standing he says I created squirrels in your presence I did those things I said yes Lord I believe you he said stand on your feet and I stood up now you see why we ask you to stand God demands respect I can say then my gloomy old spirit and expect God to press me give up and I don't even stand to worship him he told the Prophet staying to your feet told Moses take off the shoes man don't holy ground he tells the Prophet stand to your feet [Applause] he said now speak to the stone and it will do what you tell it to do now God could have done that but you see stop that Sun on the air God could've done it himself but he had a son on the mountain Oh hallelujah come on Satan take this I'm chuckling in his face man there was a man on the air that was like God and there's men coming behind me that's gonna be like God they will have the same spirit the same anointing the same power the same Holy Ghost a member of the launch so its method may not give up oh I got there many walked away when he said when you eat the flesh of the Son of Man he said what if I tell you the Son of Man ascend to a it was before he said no no no no we can't go and many walked away and then he told the twelve disciples do you also wanna go God will beg you don't you also want to go then Peter said those blessed words brother Channel where can we go Lord this message alone is the words of eternal life where can we go more we can't go to no Pentecostal Church to no man but this message is the words of eternal life and then it says here watching ah so he said now that is true and when I meet you at the judgment I have all this to answer for he said and I say stone you go to your place stop and Sun you shine normally for four days now it has a man like you and me you know the thing about the Brennan he you know Adam I can understand he was created flesh Jesus I can understand he was called flesh but he has a man that creeped through a holy wedlock and we are mixed orders via sex but college people do men like you and me now showing he can dwell in these bodies that came as son so don't another car tonight don't limit him even we must be to a donkey you speak to a donkey man he said Nana said said stone go to your place stop son you shine normally for four days and no more then I said that the sweet and the Heylin which was about to blow me down just stopped and within a moment or two the Sun was shining right down through upon me and I looked down across the mountain and I could see the east wing come and I could see the wind was coming from the west and east wind coming and it was coming this way and I could see the clouds just mysteriously where they went and whether it I don't know so he saw the wheat covered by the sweet returnee he saw the clouds but all of a sudden it's reversing and it's going back and now he already spoke the women here comes the Sun out I want you to hear this this is what I'm coming to and I stood there whew [Music] she is running only through my beard then grain I thought god I don't know what to do man this make me so emotional when I read it and I spoke I started walking down the mountain and the snow was drying up the hot Sun steam coming out of my shirt just a moment or two difference and I started walking down the mountain and and when I did not yeah I'm coming he says I had a voice and say why don't you walk with me oh god that messy man but only the God of heaven asking a human being why don't you walk with me he forgot about this foam is on his way back he's not walking back and he had the voice says look how God wants fellowship it says don't you want to look at me and tonight I can almost hear the voice of God thundering out don't you want to walk at me I'm listen young man mother father you walked on your own you walked in your own way but don't you want to walk with me even condition he said the voice said why don't you walk with me I said Lord that greatest privilege I ever had he says and I turn and I started back down through the big deer trailers down through the virgin forest this isn't a walk down way we're always pay a salute to meter my wife and I was going along there son about a half an hour three quarters later snow was all dried up watch and it was gone standing aside this tree and the tears drop my eyes and I thought God just think the same God that said peace be still to the waves and the wings of bathing Easter the same Jesus and it's right here in the woods with us and I say he's here in the meeting tonight the same Jesus that can speak to your stone in two ways into your situation he can say please bestow let there be no more disappointments in disparagement he no storm but you must say Lord it will be a privilege to walk with you oh my he spelled the same Jesus right in the woods with us his thought the word the word all nature has to pay his word for he's the creator of nature and I stood there and tears was running down my cheeks and I had something going brother Brennan knocks on the pool per day and I look standing right before me watch watch now don't you want to walk with me so he says the same Jesus that said peace be still was right in the woods he says in the next best thing when I opened my eyes he says yo there was two or three deers right before me standing right before me he was two or three deer and they were looking at me now when them deer ever was shot so much it in the last week they there was hunters in there and and they were all dressed in red anyone knows where brother ben says snaps his finger that they'd gone just that quick by looking at me along they would be gone because they don't write any others coming up like that falls fullfil full-grown male and female and mother deer and they come up walking looking around great big fat fellows I stupid a little bit and I thought this is unusual for a deer and me with this way and unlike that I thought are scaling I said you in my hands you couldn't get away if you wanted to but I'm not gonna hurt you go on and they just looked at one another and they kept coming watching remember the first coat ready needed when they went to sleep now the Tigers came the lion and all the name put him to sleep here comes the dealer he says and he thought they'd run it says but they kept coming he says and I just looked at one another and they kept coming and they got real close to me looking at me they stood a little while and walked up even closer to eat out of my end not brother if a deer so near and he said this year that's how the other came now you tell me what's it eaten brother man nobody's gonna tell me that yeah we have an even older brother and I'm gonna prove it here no further he says and it came so near and he says they looked and he says he walked off he says in a they kept looking back he says the oh and he says they could eat out my hand almost and turned around and looked at me old him like that and I walk on off and I stand and I look back to gain they look back and walk right on out in the woods and I was saying then I thought yes it no that's unusual for a deer I wonder if it's because that the Lord Jesus is here this presence oh oh I can hear the voice of God saying tonight don't you wanna work with me why would they come so yes because his presence is here and tonight you feel his presence you feeling speaking to right young people you feel the conviction of God and tonight I hear the voice of God say but you wanna walk was what is your answer I don't be

speak to his family but he was walking with God [Music] may the Lord bless you we do have one prayer requests good these things I'm addressing prayer for an infection from sister Juliette Utley and if
