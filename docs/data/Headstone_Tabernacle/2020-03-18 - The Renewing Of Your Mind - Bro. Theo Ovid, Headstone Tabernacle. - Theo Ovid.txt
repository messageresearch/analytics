bless you and welcome so good for you guys to be out here tonight amen all is bad whether somebody even call to find out if he's alive in service but God is good we're so glad to be here we are not trying we're of Christians amen so Romans 12:1 Ori two verses verse one and two it's familiar Scripture thing but Isaac redditor and Sunday I beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of God that you present your bodies a living sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service and be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God that's pretty father we thank you for your word now we read it bless it any man could read it well it takes you to come down and bring life and shine light on it granted father Jesus and we ask it shine your light on your word today and become alive in Jesus name we ask it amen and amen god bless you may be seated our title the renewing of your mind that's a title tonight the renewing of your mind I was so blessed on Sunday I don't have words to describe how I felt about Sunday service it was such a tremendous blessing to me and now and something the Holy Spirit was speaking about thinking and when Isaac and afterwards I was telling myself no that wasn't on your notes that no he didn't write that that just come my pure inspiration he was the cap for me was when he's talking about Joshua and Caleb and here the ten spies is the same line seen groups same God sent him out and they had no interaction with the Giants so therefore it wasn't as if they were intimidated by the Giants is a matter of what they told themselves so they told themselves we not able to take it they told themselves that the Giants to greet the totems of jazz until supposedly answers walking with Heartfilia bad hat suppose they was behind one by one group they interviewed Giants is saying well you have had condition you're bigger ready you know how long you will last doctor and the Giants in well I quit I couldn't just no you know the instructor chance all they tell themselves we cannot take it and what they thought affect the people what they preach affect the people what they thought affect the people because when Joshua new killer came back to the camp there was a bet anointing that was there a depressive anointing that was there and it was over the whole people because they bought a report now I bring industry sharing the power of words and the power of influence over lines and Vava - hallelujah so if a negative word that came from a negative thought could producers and oppressive atmosphere what would a positive world that come from the intelligence what kind of atmosphere is that supposed to produce then that could produce some affect and influence upon your life that will do make you do great things for the kingdom because that's the most important thing if you're big you can see it you will come out of your selfishness and you will see the kingdom of God is at hand what are you doing about God's kingdom because what I want purposed to promote his kingdom not do you miss kingdom he's blessing you for the kingdom he's adding to you for the kingdom doing here amen tonight he is making a way for you that you could be used for the kingdom or glory of God hallelujah we preach a kingdom message because our king is coming Oh glory my king must have a domain he must have a Dominion you yet about the Saudi or what not and they talk about the Prince of Sunday I'll talk about the kingdom say and the kingdom say I always smile when I hear about how they stop by the Saudis what they see is a kingdom never King the kingdom see this on the kingdom say that what about the kingdom of God do we do know your name and Birmingham taught us that the Hebrew word for former is mori isn't that right there's teaching Reem and there is inspiration rain and he taught us that they will have former and latter in in the first at the same time for marine and latter rain we have been under teaching green and hardly people looking for the latter mean some people feel they have it already because what we've enlisted him and opened this to them and Irena what that but that is not what the Prophet taught us he pauses the Lateran is coming our promise is coming I mean it's so boring but it's still the truth they come like Abraham after ten years Abraham preaching Isaac coming it's on in borås but that was coming it's just 15 more years later after 20 years you see Isaac preaching is a measure the people said repeatedly same day over and over it's like boil an egg frying egg poach an egg assuming the same charity same dynamics simply because feel on a half of the Chinese ticket how they wanna flip it is the same promise is dynamics is Lateran it's all work in a bridge I've seen you want read the preaching water under under sacrifice you're looking for fire or glory of God Alleluia or glory not going to give a transforming power because God promises we not afraid to confess it praise God because we are not in the me I'm not delivering it got one deliver it he has bring his own with the bath water getting a fight tonight got a little problem stuff the manufacture listing he has people would you see when man had to deliver is one thing but when wanna deliver as another thing when he said a virgin shall conceive it take for the years it wasn't bought Idol and what we same time the everything on season is a time for everything under the heaven there's a time I see you everything so if you get excited and the Tigers not yet you gotta wait till your change come wait in your transformation come if God choose tonight is your night tonight is your night look terrible stop you I'm cutting your bridge of the night and I so you do connect it to us tonight you listening that's for you tonight also you have to believe that God will do it you know what I said if nothing happens to a miracle working God what do you think the rest you open up that was a miracle but I see more disclose the Flies that was a miracle that was a miracle [Music] hallelujah praise God praise God it wasn't just nothing to say that Pharaoh died no miracle he could not his head but when he said let there be flies fly stuff that comes over myself package Apollo flier inch had a promo flying you said one flight to fly and that was a pop fly inch or whatever it is let me figure out know what this thing is is no new normal thing then frogs flies will attend to blood the cat drink water so I didn't come I miss the point what already covered it in the blood hallelujah many men so what are you saying below me after the teaching ring it's gonna have green laughter real because the teacher in Mori is to sow the seed so corner to put the seed in you so here I come from North did not yet tonight or not you know just here in here don't mind is a channel of your spirit so there's a big teacher in one for a national teachin dream communism suits among the nation a room and revival and then he prophesied he said if they give the eastern part of Berlin back which didn't know that means the Roman Empire is exactly in the old cycle it was any time of Jesus that already done when they break down the eastern wall and Germany become one the Roman Empire is set that is known history because the power that is to come is wrong that's the last force that the believers at the deal with not Russia not communism God raised up Russia to be with America and Rome but Rome is the enemy it has always been the enemy Roman kills 68 million Christians do need a cages Rome is who change papal Rome taken on become papal Rome Rome who had morality is not right who has brought as Rome spirit is what called the breaking of bread room spirit of denomination room and anointing denominational spirit but what a mother heart mother prostitute have daughters live in the same way but he call a bride to be virgin not have a not prostitute not fooling here and fool they're a virgin bride that would stay with the word regardless of what the mother say brother say since a big enough family thing they supporting this is a

here Sunday we wouldn't be coming to service every week every Sunday no we believe in here we are preaching to leave here we are leaving here thoughtful William you are a message that will forerun the second coming the Lord a shout to you understand the message that the top judges are on the world is to run before the world has been sold what is it denomination will reap denomination so therefore everybody will Gary sodomites denomination every man every seed have to get green to be manifested for there to be a manifest every seed we call the rain that just fall that bring the seeds the life

fire falls because it will bring alive this see that the man was show him if he was showing himself he go read that if he was swimming his own ideas he gonna read that but if he was suing Jesus Christ he will read that because the secret is the word is in the brag that means somebody somewhere has been so in the word line of Lorraine yeah little by little the Prophet and the bride and the tenth will say the same thing or give the Lord a shout we are convinced tonight that we are preaching the my message we are convinced tonight this is the word of God it can't fail the book is now open we

Oh chlorine or corny man human be seasoned John the Baptist for someone carnival is nobody can knowing that all the time a man wrapped up in seven organic or huge Anabaptist with the message I you know I just knowing I just acai figure at my script two years I didn't let a spring last night and I read a scripture and I feel like me that's an impersonation when John Gotti anointing in nineteen seventies because you're the commodity wilderness there 1970 I packed because when you see people and your compromise and your human spirit upon what you're getting connect with emotions you can really behave or you want to behave go to Freud emotions go to cut that off and all the conscience and affection yes because they just turn Freddie would why you think gotta send a trial so hot and

from the love of God that's in Christ Jesus where they are money or not that doesn't change who you are as we said job had what he had because of who he is who he was God bless him God no God didn't bless him and because He blessed the Lord because God bless me what she should be of everything would you say yes yeah because when you get a lot of stuff sometime I get over thick with pride I get overtaken because he bless you so much no yank here you get insensitive pride puffed up and then what this petitions off on your own moving through life on your own and join your own life until God

the whole thing and such a move the whole thing the world kid can be boss I like that not just ticket and be posed to they take the whole thing as paternal hill when when you see them people wake up the next morning so they get gone I hear Samson pass through afterwards you ain't touching a man like that I mean it you've got think once or twice about touching a man like that you know there is

of God unto a perfect man unto your measure you have a measure come on church you have a measure you can accommodate your measure what did he lie to tell the woman bake me a cake first are you ready the miracle will happen after you take God's would face you begin to believe God's Word then the miracle takes based on the word because the word is the seed that brings forth the miracle but there's a lot of salt on that one oil even know that you're gonna know it tonight the bird is the seed that brings forth America since you wanna miracle in your home I'm moving for your marriage American you like take the word first you see the miracle God take the word first the Holy Spirit gives it life like water falling in heaven we know the Holy Spirit represent the water represent Holy Spirit Christ is that rock that was smitten and out of him come the water of life our Persian people you must believe it and act upon it Christ was born to redeem ah one who could stand between the living and the dead and British the way and brought the resurrection why it was the Word of God now he spoke the word and the word was with all the seed a listen to this bomb and it matured in its season so Jesus grew the Bible said increase our knowledge and found favor with God and man so the word in him was growing maturing right now one time he know the word know he's in the word Jesus in word he said destroy this body and chilies and raise it up he was convinced this word has power in it so we can actually take it and tear it destroy this body a treatise a mind several visitor I have quickly ah it's in the world the prophecy surface Elijah no think about it something [Music] stored in another dimension and these guys as words and when they're connecting it break you into another dimension altogether did you hear that the word itself is alive because the word itself is caught disguise himself scriptures so this word is time can't stop it I'll give an example what what Isaiah drop-down with Joseph got job from heaven Street his heart out of a small of wood shall conceive that was the words now that word is a control all the eight it was not dying he was going out burns it's a science scientists will be able to pick up your words what spoken and get back would some people because fruit in the air its waves were twins a virgin shall conceive for hundred years both waves going out looking for destination that destination is Mary it has to be Mary it can be Lydia or this name or that live Mary so that would have to secure the earth until it finds Mary Mary know about to be born hallelujah praise God that would see the target isn't that right villager conceived then the angel connected at word had to go on he loved Mary to anoint that would promise a finish I can see you had a one Mary be it done unto me according tonight will that word became flesh inside of her Jesus on his way now hallelujah Elizabeth her baby a movie that's Charlie Saturday and she come Mary no and waited for know Saint Mary just run to get past the money of what the angel said angel and his name shall be called Jesus and when John heard Jesus in the womb John's had a shout because Johnsville his name John where Jesus turns out to show he was written that that baby was brought alive that's written power in the world yes quick tempo ahead and I the critical part is upon me that quitting power is upon you tonight be afflicted come down with the blues but there is no more blues no more you can equip the power take over that data tossed a but equipment power pull you right out to that this is your spirit this is your atmosphere this is where you want to live this is the human spirit did let me posture trying to check himself on his thoughts an idea of a dream last night I'm telling about the dream last night did not talk about a dream last night this is the Word of God when the Pharisees they caught up in pots and pans this all along Oh Teddy would ya off-key I'm gonna

get fight who would win the choice of what you accept and what you reject isn't that right the human mind was chosen for the place of the battle I cannot fight in my mind the ground you don't understand what going on but that is the Conqueror chosen you suppose the girl fight every day suppose be fighting fighting like a mushroom is just like some teddy bear yesterday we've in some ways the been yourself life it just show you so why you not fighting you not press in you'll overcome in because overcoming keeps life in you all my unity who does unity jumps yes any obstacles you catch a crime and I catch a active [Music] Oh glory to God amen Humana was chosen for the peace of the battle because we're that way it was begin that is because decisions are made from the mind the head they never started from some organization praise God and there was a woman who was sick and a pallet dear in about a ramp we should message the great battle before and I keep reaching and looking at her we should not look another bite I'm finished she what she could become ready on the ground no you could see what you want you seen on your seat you had that nut but in you because he only grown and she

seat Oh glory to God nothing changes the decision you decide to save God Almighty not because of your husband not because they are children not because their mother father whatever it is but because of him he called you equality for a purpose and that purpose is about everything else all glory to God amen we are body soul and spirit the outside the body the shell inside of the conscience of art and then it's the soul soul the spirit and spirit governs the other you can accept doubt or you can accept feet either one you want to work on therefore system began at the principle part that caused the spirit of man the doll God's Word that's what Seaton did and God begin at the principle part the lay his would in that spirit so she a time job is a convinced her to bring down so first he asked Eve what did God say what are you going so become God not talking to me and she innocently saying God say we should eat to the tree but I shall not sure I wish I shall not eat because a day we eat we shall die then says you shall not surely time God knows you know when you eat that tree you shall be you know both sides which was information and knowledge and moving either way from feet because all she knows to do was believer God said as usual test it and God's a visually dying so talks focused Teddy story walking I'm not accepting a different test concerning what God said if God said it I may not understand it but I believe it and as long as coming out of perfect smoke I believe it because my prophet doesn't speak his own thoughts save a property speak it it has to come to pass I don't need a full explanation of it if I got a revelation that's fine but if I still wanna start it I believe it and what he was supposed to say if this church right now can be put together knitted together I was such that everyone would be in one Accord not one shuttle or anywhere there would not be a feeble please enormous in another five minutes there would not be nobody a desiring the Holy Ghost but what we receive it if we could get a certain thing fixed now there is where the battle begins right in your own mind it's not christian science mind over matter the main accepts the life which is the word of god and dear brings the life just your thought doesn't do it but the word of god brought into the channel of your thought so when the wood slipped onto the channel you thought my life freedom your mind accepted it grasp it what is your mind controlled by your spirit and your spirit catches the Word of God and that is what that got life in it it brings life to you when your spirit catch the Word of God then you receive it not open the informally but inwardly unwillingly you receive the Word of God you welcomed the Word of God you embrace the Word of God you receive it as God and you

the soul it goes what feed in the V channel the trouble of it is we're standing in there with a lot of doubt trying to act supported out there you've gotta stop that come down that channel with the children of God and then it goes on automatically it's only inside it's the inside that counts you said I thought the Bible says out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks it's what in your hand if you're rude and I'm saying that it's in your heart get it out and okay your mouth will come the right words so instead of accelerating forces on Coral you will cool it down because there is no virtue in putting an accelerant to quarrel and fasten your label crime of passion somebody gets so angry they do something under necessary and jvd rested life because of a wrong attitude and decision and think in an atmosphere what is up wasn't thinking through is it worth it of course not it wanted are in a story about a woman Jeff some dominating bore some boss always talking about not really a

when God gets a man in his hands till he can get the senses the conscience and everything in doubt until it stands with God behind it in the spirit there is not a parallel world kombucha when court could get a man not even your conscience even going out the food is so clear it shows Alleluia the Auckland Blues are whistling glory to God it shines out just clean and clear it's the park on the main is the gate to the soul the gate to the spirit rather your mind opens up and accept the spirit or reject the spirit you can have these consciousness and little feelings and sensations all these things that has not agree with it that's just sensation but when it comes to reality your mind opens it up your mind either accept it or reject it he said Oh God may not miss it it's your mind that open up the door or closes the door and listen to your conscience listens to your memory listens to your affection but when your mind closes itself to these things and let God the spirit of God the

buckle against that or somebody completely blue no there is a woman a physical and there's a woman for this spirit did you believe that there's a spiritual womb and there's a physical womb the mind is the womb to the Spirit how adultery is committed spiritually when you knowing better by the Word of God by the intercourse of your mind take a lie of the devil and again and that's what I'm saying when Eve receives the devil line her nature changed immediately it was instant when Adam forsake the word he lost the earth immediately because God no longer control of him he had no more control of the earth as long as globodyne control of america control the earth once he lost the control he lost the book lost the authority lost dominion when the restoration of the book come the restoration of the control of God over your life that's why he said the bride will have the mind of Christ the intelligence that means the control combat over which is ship to govern the body so when the headship comes to govern the body then God have control over you then you will have dominion over others and other things about you Oh glory to God hallelujah praise be to Jesus so we are sown with the word someday it will bring the life into the earth it'll replenish the earth where he failed Mary did she took the word if top sitting like Mary took God's Word and to Mary seed replenishes it again to his pride true the word will bring up the Millennium therefore on the same thesis she could take God's Word and said God said not to do it get away from here not what I mean all right but instead she's
