you and welcome to our sunday morning feasts and uh we want to go straight into the message uh won't we too long with you this morning but we want to go to luke chapter two and also matty chapter two so what we'll do we're gonna read luke chapter 2 115 and then you're going to sit down and we're going to read matthew chapter 2 1-15 oh praise god i said enjoy i appreciate our christmas message this is my christmas message this morning to share something which you want to know will be a defined to you luke chapter two we want to read from verse one and it came to pass that they went out as decree of caesar augustus that all the world should be taxed and this toxin was first made when sarinius was governor of syria and all went to be taxed everyone into his own city joseph also went up from galilee out of the city of nazareth unto judea under the city of david which is called bethlehem because he was the house of the lineage of david to be taxed with mary his exposed wife being great with child and so it was that while they were there the days were accomplished that she should be delivered and she brought forth her firstborn son and wrapped him in smothering clothes and laid him in a manger because there was no room for them in the inn and they were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field keeping watch over their flock by night and lo the angel of the lord came upon them the glory of the lord shone around them and they were so afraid and the angel said unto them fear not for behold i bring good tidings of great joy which shall be to all people for the you is born this day in the city of david a savior which is christ the lord and this shall be a sign unto you you shall find the beep wrapped in swaddling clothes lying in the mange and suddenly there were with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising god saying glory to god and the highest and an earth peace goodwill towards men and it came to pass as the angels were gone away from them into heaven the shepherds said one to another let us now go even to bethlehem and see these things which has come to pass which the lord had made known unto us you may be seated and we want to go straight to matthew chapter 2 for a fuller context of this story and it applies to us today so we're not talking christmas just to christmas okay matthew chapter two verse one and now when jesus was born in bethlehem and judea in the days of herod the king behold they came wise men from the east to jerusalem saying where is he that is born king of the jews for we have seen a star in the east and we come to worship him and whenever the king heard these things he was troubled and all jerusalem with him so not only he was troubled jerusalem with him too and when he had gathered all the chief priests scribes of the people together he demanded of them where christ should be born so he heard someone like a believer right and they said unto him in bethlehem of judea for this is written by the prophet and though bethlehem in the land of judah at that the least among the princes of judah for out of thee shall come a governor that shall rule my people israel then herod when he had previously called the wise men inquired of them diligently what time the start appeared and he sent them to bethlehem and said go search diligently for the young child and when you have found him bring me word again that i may come and worship him also do we know that spirit behind that right and when they had heard the king they departed and low the star which they saw in the east went before them till it came and stood over where the young child was and when they saw the star they rejoiced with exceeded great joy and when they were coming to the house they saw the young child with mary's mother and fell down and worshipped him and when they had opened their treasures they presented unto him gifts gold frankincense and myrrh and being warned of god in a dream that they should not return to herod they departed into their own country another way and when they were departed behold the angels of the lord appeared to joseph in a dream saying arise take the young child and his mother and flee to egypt and beat out here until i bring the word for herod will seek the young child to destroy him and when he arose he took the young child and his mother by night departed to egypt and was dear until the death of herod that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the lord by the prophet saying out of egypt have i called my son my god blesses would you love him this morning he's always a blessing and a privilege to be in the house of god and to serve him isn't that right oh blessed be the name of the lord thank you jesus hallelujah glory thank you lord give him some praises give him some worship oh glory hallelujah you know unwind nothing infinite dead church they know what that sill is no dead people we bury the dead let the dead bury the dead but we come here to amen to live jesus higher oh blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah glory thank you lord jesus oh glory so this morning i have a title god's gift package wrapped you know people like gifts and you when you get a gift people just choose something and say hold that no it normally is wrapped god gift package wrapped oh blessed be the name of the lord so uh the prophet is talking about christmas in our hearts we are so glad for this so happy to know that we are living on the nd when we see the signs coming again as it was and in that day of his approach and we humble our hearts and our presence let thy spirit read him supremely in our hearts and in our lives and you know when your joy is connected to something external you need something external to keep you happy and joyful but when you have joy on the inside there's nothing you don't need on the outside to give your joy on the inside they can put you anywhere anytime any place it's what's inside of you oh my that's when you know something beginning to work in your life when the external doesn't affect the internal amen praise god you have joy on the inside you could give it on the outside oh praise god you show it onto your side isn't that right oh praise the name of the lord so batman bethlehem prophet was a small tongue and there's a reason why god choose bethlehem because bethel bethlehem means house of god's bread and many people are guarded from all over galilee to come into the booth place where the bethlehem and trudeau province to be taxed of the roman government so number one god managed to make their move oh glory to god hallelujah the government had to issue the orders and it's not the government doing thing and doing that and doing that it's not that you know is god going and make a plan god has to get jesus in position to be born in the right place if jesus leave mary where she is the scripture will be broken and the scriptures cannot be broken and the only way to get joseph and mary in position is to extend the law to force them to come into position oh glory to god i would believe the lord shout so we're not here to fight the law he said national force will put to the the churches and the world cups the churches but the power of god will put the people in the pride so even if we dock national force we still need the power of god not some man of the or not some pastor man the power of god to put you in the pride you're not entitled to be in the bride you have to get the power to go in to be the bride oh give the lord a shout glory to god no entitlement god cut israel off because they believe they were entitled and god said not a bit of it we'll give the lord some praises hallelujah so they want to be taxed no matter what conditions they had to stroll along the road sick needy bedridden the leper the cancer the poor the lame the whole the blind all had to come because it was a government order and herod was behind it and it must be done oh glory to god isn't that right and we're in the east so a lot of things moving right now herod make his law joseph will marry trash and dunk to go into position and way in the east some wise men trusting away they on their way already took them a couple of years to reach but they underwear because they didn't meet that new baby the young and young child so all glory to god to their men packing up to to go to follow this star oh glory to god and planets line up and they're following it and when you follow that style it must lead you to where the messiah is at oh gloria and god had seven stars to seven ages and god put a malachi 4 stand any time you get it from that style you're in trouble any time a man can interpret what he starts saying that is trouble he said one star all glory to god to reflect the light of the uncommon sun and we only echoing what that sound speaks so the spirit the bride and the prophet say what the tapes say and what they say will already be said in the word oh glory to god so what you're getting this morning is direct prophecy oh hallelujah we're here to find it and tie it up that you can't miss it for nothing because jesus had messiah you're gonna have your messiah just as jesus says mary pack that gift you're going to pack that gift god will wrap it for you god will wrap you with it oh give the lord a shout glory to god hallelujah hallelujah praise god my god hallelujah are when you're giving somebody a gift they can't tell you what people to wrap it in i put in that blue rapper than a silver representative pink you wrap it however you want to wrap it it's your gift is you giving it you could choose a wrapping paper and when god wanted to choose this gif he choose you i know i'll catch you now you didn't think about that right that you are the rapping that goku wrapped his gift or wrong oh glory to god hallelujah oh glory who me filter me you hallelujah trouble zombie yeah let's continue so these these eyes maggies or what they call them and they say the first little christmas package that was ever wrapped in all the world god wrapped it up god wrapped it up hallelujah and i want to break in on my thought and say the greatest thing that ever wrapped in human flesh was wrapped in it god himself wrapped his own self in a christmas package and sent it to the world oh glory to god did you hear that god himself wrapped himself in a christmas package and sent it to the world hallelujah hallelujah praise god why did they refuse it why couldn't they see it why didn't they turn off dinner down why is they didn't want it the same reason they don't want it tonight it wasn't handed to them in the custom that they were used of gifts being handed and that's the reason we checked it tonight is because it's not handed to the people in the custom they've been used to receiving gifts but god wrapped his own package he's got a right to do it he's the one that has given it he has a right to wrap it any way he wants to wrap it it doesn't make any difference how it is he's got a right to do it because he's the one that is giving it oh glory to god so nobody can tell you you can't make it don't let nobody write your picture for you or give the lord a shout in the house don't let nobody write your story you write your story yourself give the lord a shout [Music] [Applause] go read oh god amen let me send you a little bit is wanting for somebody to write your story you know is when you write and choose to write your picture you want to see but when them 10 spies come back you know what they say in our eyes we would like grasshoppers now when people talk and say you're small you're smart you're small but when you see yourself small you're tiny you're real small a little short my name caleb said we are let's go up at once because we are well able to take it he was looking at something different and so help me god you have to look at something different something bigger than you more powerful than you greater than you i'm convinced that god almighty is in the affairs of men when herod think you don't but taxes taxes taxes god's seeing everything coming into place and position oh give the lord a shout my god mary coming into position hallelujah the the the three wise men coming in position and the shepherds already in position i'll give the lord some praises oh glory to god hallelujah hallelujah and everything will come at an intersection where it all makes sense oh hallelujah sometimes it looks like this here not connected with this here not connected with this here but we know that all things work together for good to them that love god the damn who are the call you can't stop that you cannot change that you cannot cancel that he told the disciples you have not chosen me come on now but i have chosen you it is chosen oh glory to god he chose you to give you a gift this morning would you receive it oh glory to god he chose you to bless you this morning oh glory to god hallelujah so they had their own interpretation of angel becoming fairy horses and when it come as a little baby being born a manger literally didn't know the scripture said i'll give the world a super sign not a sign you know a super sign a virgin shall conceive and be a child they wanted a general and god drop a baby upon them they wanted big dynamics to speak the world and flashlight like them and god dropped my little boot a little baptism of the holy ghost where people could shout and praise god they said i'm dead in the message so long they can't join the heavenly chorus john see the book openers have to carry on all under mystery and scripture and word and all kind of thing oh glory to god hallelujah praise god praise god oh glory to god people come fight from india oh glory to god he said we have seen his days and we come to worship him people come with excitement they come with expectation and the most holy place most holy people gets the doornail clueless all kind of things taken place hallelujah is coming wise men coming jerusalem clueless herod here have a clue what's going on and here comes some wise men shaking up the country shaking up the place with our testimony we have seen something we come to see the sign we see the sign got the hung mechanics dynamics to the mechanics oh glory to god we come looking for a messiah where is he go hide him where is he [Applause] glory to god your 50 years in the message william william show me the love show me the charity show me dynamics show me the holy ghost show me the fire itself [Applause] they say who because you see the full world has to be born under manifestation did you hear that he said according to luke 17 30. revelation 10 the full word is to be born into not talking asian into manifestation where is he and they both who king of the jews when he would hear that because when they're king here king is troubling them the one who can challenge them you know everyone say king carrots get shook up and jehovah jerusalem because not these men are no mad men they come from a journey far off another one that they bring gifts with them they have the revelation of what to identify what they come to identify they knew by revelation what they come to identify they know gloria bring them by chance they know they're not there by chance they don't know not journeys by chance god make no mistake this time nothing they this die is something oh give the lord a shout and you're not here by chance this morning glory to god you have come to this message by no chance you have seen this shine inside by no chance and have to lead it to something not to some church not to some man you have to leave the messiah all glory to god hallelujah glory to god what was the shepherd's message what was the shepherd's testimony the prophet said the shepherds got the greatest message any man could get that the messiah is on earth now for years prophecy after prophecy after prophecy but to know that this day the scripture is fulfilled you know what i'm feeling it just to know you're sick you're sick you're sick and god come and heal you and you say my god this day the scripture is fulfilling my life i am healed i am delivered i am free the bands are breaking off from me god are you healing because you're long in the message god god heal it because of your faith oh tell the lord i shout [Applause] gray hair don't impress god give him faith not go rock heaven give him faith i hear you hanging on you say it does make you praise god abraham staggered knock at the promise of god sarah was grumpy sarah was all but abram was still praising god as they say was a young woman that is faith your eyes don't declare faith your feelings only give it money in your pocket or no money in your pocket that doesn't declare what faith is [Applause] [Music] [Applause] that's the final secure doesn't declare faith faith will be on feelings emotions oh glory to god where have you laid him oh god he's stinking always thinking i just actually lay lame where put him it's a roller winning stone oh god multiplayer's gonna stink roll away the stone you can you can expect me to bring forth if you do something you've got to do something yourself roll away that stone and stink in your life but roll away that stone resurrections come and roll away that stone my god nobody will kill me dead in this message my god i will stay home and shout and leave you if you want to stay dead but you wouldn't kill me oh glory to god hallelujah god called me to have life and have it more abundantly this message is too precious i have seen a star i come to worship oh glory to god hallelujah and i say messiah is on what no god took the prophet he didn't take the angel god took the prophet he didn't do the pill of fire god took the prophet he didn't get divine healing he didn't get the supernatural he didn't take away miracles he didn't take away sin mark 16 he didn't take a message on 14 12. didn't take away sin mark 11 23. glory glory i hope you believe it like me go go god only work to believe us not you know champions believers and you could believe from your heart i would have shake up the devil oh glory that god the devil could never understand you because god chose you to wrap the gift wrong oh glory to god he didn't understand jesus he said if though be because he couldn't understand the rapping but the word was made flesh and well among us so glory to god don't let the rapping fool you glory to god help me jesus this morning don't let this package fool you glory look god wherever god choose to wrap the package issues a rabbit oh hallelujah someone the package a certain way you know or they're receiving it he came onto his own hallelujah and his own receiver not but as many as receive this package to them only to them only to them give the power power to become what church members come on sons all sons act like the father not like church like the father or give the lord some praises oh glory to god hallelujah when this great gift of the church the holy spirit jesus christ no no ministerial gift i'm not talking about that all right when this great gift of the church the holy spirit falls nothing quick in my mind when you open up not that false people don't even know that this fall it could fall on you like all demons has fallen people holy ghosts could fall on you holy ghost let me say that again holy course you see spirits of fallen people holy ghosts could fall on you you saw demons that annoying people holy ghost could anoint you do you believe that i didn't hear you i want a bigger human than that you believe god could heal you this morning [Applause] [Music] [Applause] when the holy spirit falls among the poor and humble the rich don't want it they want they don't want to humble themselves they want it but class they don't want it the way god sends it the way god sends it i don't have to interpret how god ascended like the old colored man got a rich boss he got the holy ghost and the boss fan he's so happy and joyfully so i want that too you know our money still not happy i wanna kind of join two he said he said could i get it here he boys man can't say come on i'll show

you whatever and you say hey believe a prophet and nothing changing you you need fire not another minister fire not one more mystery let me see it good you don't need not one more mystery [Applause] you need fire let me say that again you find that outer order let me tell you what john said john says in me i'm not even worried and lose that man she was not coming but he won't come in after me he shall baptize you with the holy ghost and with fire you see people cutting out the scriptures they could quote william branham from home no till never worry from naughty tribulation that is in the scriptures and the prophet came to read the scriptures whatever we have we have to go back in the scriptures it have to have a fire to power us out of here [Applause] courts can't do it tax can't do it nice bastard can't do that you and your pastor will go straight into tribulation and you can solve another contribution saying i'm not with that tenant i going up i want the oil because the oil has to get fired up yes yes yes yes yes you see you see when you have the oil water is depleting oil and set your hat on fire so then you burn in and you dip inside the oil that light can't come out because it's coming from the oil the oil coming up every service oil coming up or to leave here you have to go to fire you up light the match and put fire under there and say take that satan you're going to leave smoke in the devil's face oh will you have a good time this morning hallelujah my listen let's continue he wasn't wrapped in fine little in jesus this almighty god swap then cloth where they put the racks around the oak neck and keep it from rubbing blisters on his neck she has no diapers no pampers i forget what these what is it called a long time pampers and pampers on campus the soft things no diapers no armed them will take nice fluffy black blanket no swaddling clothes hallelujah and they could not receive it because they taught more of the crease than they did of the gift and that is the way today people can't accept divine speaking with tongues in their church they will ruin their creed the context of divine healing the baptism holy ghost such greater evangelical doctrines are possible truths because their creeds condemn it how foolish to take the paper the package is wrapped in and threw away the gift like the take your band and toward the gift and pull it up man because it's springy no wonder there was no room for many inn it wasn't wrap rights wasn't wrapping the classical people around it it was wrapped as a gift as a gift from god sent from god a god that they didn't know nothing about see that is the problem israel didn't know god a man named moses come and drop fleas and flies and frogs on pharaoh they saw miracles but they didn't know where it come from they saw miracles but they don't know who was behind the miracles who was behind that man called moses and moses god tell moses bring them to the mountain i like to teach them who i am that they can learn my ways and learn my laws you are born with this thing you will grow up in this thing you have to be taught baptized firebombed that were the only believers on fire fasting praying every week all kinds of that afterwards people have booked i remember the early days i couldn't wait to get the book you couldn't wait to get that tape a new book come out oh my god your whole life you're kissing that you can't finish read the book know everything there and people just you know this day any message no room in our religious circles for holy ghost meeting when last year message because holy ghost meeting that's the quotient that's the quotient holy ghost meeting no man raring for us because you have a mouth i'm not talking about that i'm talking about holy ghost meeting when people come and cry at the altar tell me lord see me lord baptize me lord change me lord jacob money couldn't change him he was very wealthy after ripping off everybody had everybody could rip off his report he's a ripoff artist and yet god says jacob i love because jacob god knew what was inside that man when he showed uncommon jacob say with him and my brother you could kill me but you're richer than me and you had to change it god catch jacob alone and that's the problem with some of you can't get caught alone yet they're still talking friends and family and this one and down where i talk to this one go there catch you by yourself here where you could deal with you when you could see you and ask yourself if you want to continue as you are because some people like how they are they have religious spirits upon them they in church they need message but it's religious spirits upon them it's demons make them feel they're okay jacobs had a wrestling touch angel hold on angel that didn't change anymore is when the angels had a we would go want to go he said not letting you go try to change me you know all this wrestling holding i was representing the angel that is nothing you know another man went to all kind of presently come back and see him all foolish we're not counting like that you know so it's not a matter [Music] yeah all that is good but after that you're better than you walk you're better when you talk [Applause] when jacob's had to lock that angel leg and foot and hand he's had to go he said you can't go until they change me then the angel pulling away he said you're not going serious you see what is test shield to see if you really mean business guess what when the angel touch him so he everybody can see some men oh god how are you looking silver looking but name change broken but inside change he can face anything but he walking broken people can laugh at him he's okay keep on laughing people can mock him oh glory to god doesn't matter who hate him hallelujah you're free on the inside a transform walk a transformed talk a transformed life oh glory to god amen jacob was six after that why he wrestled all night with the angel no preachers put something in his head oh hallelujah there's no room for holy ghost meeting they don't want it it belittles them in the sight of the classes of the country it belittles them to think here we go that they have to humble themselves to come down to the altar and cry and to tarry dear until they are filled with power from on high to rise up with the newness of life to let their hair grow out to act like a woman ought to mend through the cigarettes away and so on instead of receiving god's gift god's christmas gift they say i'd rather have a creed than with the gift they'd rather have the paper than the gift he was wrapped in a dirty cloth a swaddling cloth and he was wrapped today here we go he's wrapped today in the same thing which they call holy ruler fanaticism a bunch of heretics it is wrapped up in swaddling clothes that's why how could they handle that peter numbers ignorant and on a limb and them staggering in the upper room so like that like junkman if peter come back drunk man they go on who's he you know in this message they put this sat down pillow fire knocked down moses you know hit moses and gave moses revelation of genesis same pillar fire came down over israel same pillar fire knocked down paul they're giving revolution in the new testament same pillar fire to hit william branham trivial every mystery and we are called into that same pillar of fire [Applause] not a man you know that's the pillar of fire are we talking about there's a high calling oh glory to god christmas present is because they know what what they said watch he said they don't want it it will make woman act different it's a main what be christmas present it will make men act different you'll have to bear the name of a fanatic you'll have to take the way with the lord's despised you you'll have to clean up your life you'll have to quit your meanest you have to stop doing wrong cheating stealing line commitment adultery you have to stop these things and the people don't want it although they may know it's right they don't want it it brings too much truth to them it uncovers their sin it's going to cost you you're going to cost people anything they don't want nothing to do with that's the way it is today they're going to cost you your bunker parties big times cigars duty jokes all the feel things of the world but i'll give you a name written in the lamb book of life that faded not away when they refused the holy ghost here we go when he refused the holy ghost they refuse christ they refuse god's program they refuse the messenger when they see the holy ghost they refuse the messenger watch they refuse everything so therefore they have they are left in their sins there is nothing left but judgment he said they have refused christ they refuse this program they refuse a spirit he tried for 50 years and that's the holy ghost to fall in america and they refuse it for 50 years another particular thing i think one of the most pathetic words that jesus ever said he said father i sanctify myself that they might be sanctified in other words he had a right as a man you had a right to a home you're the writer of family you as a man as much man as you are or i am as much human and as mannered as we are he had a right to it but he had trained 12 men that was going to take the gospel to all the world so he sanctify himself watch i signify myself for their sake he say a gift of god keeping himself sanctified then cry out all gifts of god you people who claim that you receive his spirit keep yourself sanctified keep away from the things of the world be sanctified oh my the love of god how god unfolded himself and come in a christmas package was laid on straw the first thing oh my he was later in straw the last thing he was a torn crown on a with a dirty rag wrap over his eyes hit on the head saying if you're a prophet tell us who hit you and he was attacked to the cross love reaching out when his own children is crying for his blood father forgive them they don't even know what they're doing the church don't want it they want a creed we need love the church is dying by creeds glory to god here brother kangaroo the church is dying by creeds if it can only live by love and and yet people want to force you to believe what they believe doctrine could never bring love it takes the holy ghost to bring love [Applause] people dying in this message because of doctrine and all kind of petty ministers foolishness he said what we need is love he said we need love the church is dying by creeds it can only live by love because love is eternal love overcomes all things love is the most powerful force there is they didn't want him because they know what was in that gift oh glory to god hallelujah if that gift fall along in all the churches you know ministers had a backup sharpener and said don you know because they can't go and talk while i get going on when the holy ghost pouring out what are they gonna do will you go see got a shot man out when that vision hit brother branham he said he was packed in the corner numb for hours he said you're not but blessing but there's the power of god you can't talk what happened to daniel daniel couldn't talk what i'm good john john couldn't talk when it hit him so he fell as one dead there is power that he's got to talk and explain in a way and you see her with ears and hope these words is a blessing to you that's not that oh that's the lord himself oh glory to god oh glory to god that's what i'm saying all the foolishness we can overcome let that feel if i come out one more time all the foolish with israel when that pill of fire come down on the mountain they say don't let god speak you know let me speak you know because we didn't use that kind of gold you know then my customers all them told things pharaoh had and saying this is the god and mountain god and goat god and all kind of old head they had that they built their own god for the self this was no god at

she found there was forgiveness oh my i wonder tonight in this building at this christmas time in commemoration nearly two thousand years ago when god gave his first christmas gift i wanted a night if you would like to look on the inside of that package and see if there's somebody in here who loves you somebody who died for you somebody who gave their life for you who would you willing tonight to take a sweating cloth off of him that dirty clothe that call him fanatic and holy rule and wrap yourself in it and take the way with the lord and this fight you say what does that have to do with us this christmas story i'm almost finished here now listen to this here now this one with cena stand in the east and come to worship him when christ jesus was being formed in mary that is when the persecution set in uh-huh so now we can tie it to us here now all right and it's the same thing in you galatians 4 19 says when christ the hope of glory is being formed in you christ is being formed in you when you are dying and christ is coming to life watch the persecution second trouble is that on every hand watch the devil go in a rampage certainly when christ is being formed in you so no minutes that could fool us no man can't fool us we under no persecution we are not pressure we are not timer lingering to get right with god die out and let christ start to form in you then watch the laws begin to move in watch everything begin to change let's continue and when christ was being formed in mary quickly come the king's commandment all you people she said the christ was becoming a full baby ready to be delivered right then the great persecution here come the prophecy now now the baby had been formed for a long time in the womb but this has come in the last days when the completeness when the fullness of the godhead when the fullness of christ is to be manifested among his people that's the reason our great social lives and things can understand that it is foolishness to them now watch they are forming the congress of churches just the time when the church is beginning to get to his feet where the supernatural is beginning to work now they're going to try to stop stop this stuff remember one summer telling you the government got closer it's done for having books and tape and preaching the message that's foolishness that makes no sense you're not enough man people are wrong with all kind of crazy stuff the only time you press came down is that when they're stuck in the upper room bomb said the devil said leave them they're only having a great time you know when the press comes on them when peter says silver and gold have i none such as i have and that was peter said only kill jesus but the package that jesus had he gave me and i received that christmas gift and now he is in me and what i have in me i could give you so i'd have to actually want it i could give it because i have it i can't give what i don't have such as i have i give rise up and walk in the name of jesus christ [Music] wait wait till that didn't happen this message you can see who's your friend when that to jump and leap and wait and carry on mom said the devil get up and said we had to stop this you know yeah so the devil jumped on them pharisees and scribe and said put some legs on them and then stop that because they think likes could stop them they take licks could beat all the holy ghosts they think the legs go stop the anointing they take blows and pressure when them fellas went back into the prayer meeting they are missing this after that you know they say lord god send the power one more time give us strength that we could go back out and testify and the bible said they were refilled with the holy ghost refilled refilled yes yes you heard me he said the dynamics of this church will be a refilling of the holy ghost no press can't come no no nobody can close the church are they gonna do that with no power we goose [Music] if they close that we go scoop not even coroner my rescue closes down the church open right through who is the church upon this rock come on now i'll build my church [Applause] [Music] it's the rock inside of you come on can preach back to me somebody it's the faith that's inside of you so upon this rock i'll build my church and the case of hell never prevail against it glory says only when the supernatural begin to manifest itself then that could cause the laws to change that they will do something about it because what would be manifested is beyond what pentecostal have and all them crazy charlatans and hypocrites and false prophets that have all ruled today if we don't know like that we are bright in action you say what means who is this who is this oh god is this this is that that the prophet william branham speak of who is this kind of people who are we we are the hearts of the children we are the children who have hearts have returned literally back to the fate of the father that's why you say what we need is thousands of live voices the thunder of god walking in sweetness and humility the devil don't care about a nice message i said god they adopted a sermon their only only men would only possibly adopted them god adopted our life you hear what i say nothing money you know go on adopting a good message a man preacher good message oh good word but good good good word never see it through died up that that god adopted never see it so it has to be a life that god could report holy son behaving why i think god allowed them two people to come to make love in church and brahma says stop it please beg them somebody please stop there please stop it please the senior man the senior human they don't take an honor don't compel her father anointing come change everything he said whatever you say to them people that's it if they say blind they are blind if they say dead they are dead whatever you say that's going to happen you know what kind of test that is you see why god can't get manpower they can misuse it and abuse it always studies i forgive you what made him do that oh glory to god what made him express the virtue for the age what made him express the blood of god oh hallelujah i forgive you i forgive you i forgive you and this holy ghost was pleased oh give the lord i shall god wonder if she forgive this on top of brotherly kindness is the gift of holy spirit okay the lord when you stand praying for charity forgive if you want against any [Applause] glory to god yeah god allows people to do you stuff hate your evil lie all kind of thing like that pain some nasty pictures people paint some pictures about this church too you think i'd bother with them did that people leave the church i'm not burdened with that or somebody say when it church when a building build the cut the scaffolding is removed so some people are spotted scaffolding never part of the building never part of the program so that that's not going to stop if i dead in the morning this church is not going to stop because i am the lit and i ain't keeping it the one who started to finish it the one who started working you're able to complete it you have no man to hold on to except the man christ jesus oh he is our rock he's our shield museum come up please oh glory give the lord some praises hallelujah glory to god come on please you might be seated god was always

jesus to do the work of redemption he couldn't die in the spirit so he had to die as a man he couldn't die as he turned on spirit all glory to god so the world became flesh to pay the price it was a blood currency it was a bad price to pay for us satan had us in bondage but he came to loose us and to free us from the bondage of sin from the power of satan and only blood could do that so when jesus died and paid a price that blood price oh that songs i would not be denied oh glory to god till jesus came and bring me i will not be denied oh give the lord a shout in the house oh hallelujah hallelujah oh glory to god i'm almost done here he said brother sis are you catching it he said it's been veiled through the ages god said it will be open his last days those seven seasons will be

for the message thank you for the service thank you for the season and the time we're living in oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh you appreciate the law this morning to think that was reading the prophet speaking about how the world didn't like how that gift was wrapped that gift of jesus christ your wrapping the way he came how he lived how he grew up it was not the expectation and i thought it was so powerful that this gift of the holy ghost that he has promised to pause in the last days has its own rapping i'll be wrapped in you and i how a powerful testimony that god could overlook this one and overlook that one and overlook your neighbor and overlook somebody else to put that gift inside of individual sons and daughters of god that's something to give god praise and thanks for this morning amen what a season what a time we're living in so may the lord bless you we before we get to the prayer request we have some notes or praises i want to read this know the praise this is from sister christine see torah i'd like to give god all the praise on and glory he is real and answers prayer since the beginning of this year i have been praying for god to speak to me and show me if i'm doing anything wrong if i'm not doing what i'm supposed to in the way that i'm supposed to do it and let me know what changes i had to make in my life as i did not want anything to keep me from receiving the holy spirit and being adopted into his kingdom i also prayed for him to teach me how to pray and what to pray for i cannot say that kovit is a blessing but i believe all things work together for good to them that love god and are called according to his purpose during this time the bible studies have been shown me what i should do how i should behave how i should speak and more it is amazing to actually be part of the prayer meeting when god is speaking to his servant during the exhortation teaching me how to pray with fate desperation and so much more and to feel the presence of god in our home i would like to thank god for using his servants in such a mighty way to answer my prayer my god is real and answers prayer god bless you i love you sister christine you appreciate that this morning amen and another note of praise from sister susan rajkumar there seems i want to thank god for his mercies and grace thus far uh for the past two weeks i've been wrestling to give this testimony that all lying devil kept telling me don't do it about two months ago i lost a bag of keys for a building in san diego spare keys and all i searched the entire house repacked all the drawers and vehicles no keys i kept that bag in the vehicle in a particular draw i prayed about it but no definite answer a sister was testifying how the neighbor found her keys immediately i mentioned about the bag of keys and i believe that i threw it away in the garbage and that i'm in big trouble i told i'm going to ask god to create the same bag of keys and place it in the same drawer as a matter of fact it's already done three days later in sleep i heard a voice telling me go to the drawer i forgot all about it a few days passed as i pulled the draw it fell down tilled over and out came the same bag of keys given god answers prayer sister suzanne rashford amen you believe he's a prayer answering god you believe he's a god of the impossible if thou canst believe he said it's anything too hard for the lord all things are possible and i believe that amen so last note of praise before i switch over to the prayer requests i have another priest i'm giving god thanks for making it to 40 years old today is my birthday so i thank god i turbed over i'm officially a caleb [Applause] this is the mark where caleb said 40 years old was i when moses showed me what mountain was my mountain so i am i'm happy to be in the land of the living and to be at my post of duty and thanking god for all the greetings and the salutations and all the prayers and the well wishes and looking forward for what god will do so now let's switch you can play something to the prayer requests uh prayer requests from brother kelly south uh his sister he had sent a prayer request
