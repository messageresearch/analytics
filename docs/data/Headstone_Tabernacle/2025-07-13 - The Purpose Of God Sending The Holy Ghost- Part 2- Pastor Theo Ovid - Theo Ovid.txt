TRANSCRIPT
========================================
ahead. Son stand still. His son's talking. Oh, glory to God. Hallelujah. Elijah take the mantle and strike the river and the Jordan open up his son's walking. Son's talking. Oh, glory to God. Red Sea have to open up because sun's moving. It's God's people moving. And it's time for that Red Sea to open up. It's time for your mountain to move. It's time for your cancer to dissolve. It's time for your blind eye to pop open. Oh, glory to God. It is time for the anointing to strike the church of the living God. We are under prophecy. We are walking into the vision to provide a vision, but we walking into the reality of the vision to fulfill the vision that was prophesied of us. Oh, hallelujah. Oh my power. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Your testimony today will bring judgment. Hallelujah. Against the city. Our testimony of the baptism of the Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; and the power of God, a holy life. Don't leave that one out. Will bring judgment against the city. Power of prayer. Are you with me? Power of speech. Are you saying amen out there? Power for a holy life. That is what the Holy Ghost is to do. Some people say, "I can't quit drinking. I can't quit this." The Holy Ghost come to live in you to make all these cans get away from you. To make you a holy life. It will make you follow the instructions of the Bible every time. It's to make you turn your head from them half naked women. Amen, brothers. Quit lusting after them and church members. It's to quit making you smoke and drink and want to be a big shot. Oh, glory to God. Holy Ghost take all the big shot thing out of you. It takes that out of you. It takes that lust to be a big shot out of you. It make you quit gossiping. Make you quit qu playing cards. Hallelujah. make you quit carrying on the way you do living untrue to your wife. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It will make you set your affections and things above. You say, "I can't do it. I can't do it." He said, "But the Holy Spirit come for that purpose." That's what it come for. To take it out of you. All of them old habits and things you're doing, the old backbiting, separating yourself. Say, "Bless God, I'm a Methodist." I would have nothing to do with them. Holy rulers. The Holy Ghost come to take that over to you. Hallelujah. I'm a Baptist. I'm a Presbyterian. I wouldn't go to that little old holy roller church. The Holy Ghost come to take all that starch out of you. Oh, it washes you with the blood. It irons you out. It come to straighten you up. It makes the crooked places straight. That is what it come to do. All this is what the Holy Ghost was sent for. Hallelujah. It's to give uncction to the preacher. Oh, glory to God. Say the preacher have no uncction. You notice the Holy Ghost not there. It's to give uncction to the preacher. It's to give holiness to the group. It's to set the church in order. It's to bring unity of spirit. It's to unite us together with power. It's to unite us together with love, brother love. And if the Holy Spirit is in you, it will lead you right to the word. There'll be no excuses. Oh my. You'll make it to the line every time. What's the Holy Ghost is to make you a citizen of the kingdom of God. And what does God do in his kingdom? It's holiness, righteousness, purity of thought, purity of mind, power and love, going to the lost, healing the sick, performing miracles, doing great things. In closing remark, brother Brian, then it is absolutely now to you people, it is absolutely essential and necessary and compelling and compulsory that you receive the Holy Ghost now. For if you don't, you cannot come in the resurrection. Now watch, God cannot break his laws. We know that he follow his laws. I want to read it again. He says, "Now to you people, it is absolutely essential and necessary. It might be essential you shake the pastor hand. It might be necessary. You have to believe all the teachings and and all them. You know that might be the thing. But this year it is essential, necessary, compelling, compulsory that you receive the Holy Ghost now. For if you don't, you can't come in the resurrection. Now watch, God cannot bring his laws. We know that he follow his laws. What is the Holy Ghost? God in you. What's it for? to continue his work among his people to bring his church together to bring the church to a place in this day far beyond Lutheran, Methodist, Pentecostal into a place of adoption and rapturing grace and when this part of the church when the spirit moves into this church here it will just raise it bring it forth and all the redeemed that touch that spirit. So actually the bride will have the capstone spirit. I like to bring it as a magnet. &gt;&gt; That magnet anointing. Then &gt;&gt; all them in the grave who are elected, &gt;&gt; they are already magnetized. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So once this bright magnet is activated, it will pull them right up out of the grave. Hallelujah. Praise God. You must receive the Holy Ghost by one spirit. We are baptized into one body. Oh, glory to God. What is it? It's the spirit of God. What's this for? To lead you, to guide you, to fill you, to sanctify you, to call you out. Oh, glory to God. Thank you, Lord Jesus. And after the seals was open and the prophet preached the token, he said that was the message to cap the seals. That was the capping message. After all the mysteries, after all the revelations, after all the history, the messages were capped off by this particular message, the token. And the token is not doctrine. The token is not teaching. The token is the blood on display. And the blood display like how the blood was on the doorpost in Moses time, but in this time it is the literal life of Jesus, Jesus Christ on display. We're not talking about token applied to the heart now. We're talking about token on the outside. So the life on the inside begin to ooze on the outside. And that's why he said the ministry has reached perfection when Christ is reproduced in the natural. Oh, glory to God. Do you see it now? Hallelujah. So minister can say what they want and say they've adopted and say that ministry and this and that and you're not seeing Jesus. You know something is dead wrong. He said the ministry has come to perfection when Christ is reproduced in natural. Hallelujah. Now we talking about pulpit thing. We're not talking about message thing, a nice message, a nice teacher. We're not talking about that. We're talking about the reproduction of Christ. Oh hallelujah. A life thundering. Oh my. Oh hallelujah. The law and the prophets were until John. Almost finished. Since that time, the kingdom is preached and and every man press into it. He say every man pressed into it, not just simply walk into it easily. It's got to be pressed into. &gt;&gt; It's got to be &gt;&gt; pressed into. Say pressed into wherever you are. &gt;&gt; Pressed into. Not shake hand. Not you love your pastor and he he sounding good and he's preaching good and preaching nice. Not that. Forget that. You have to press into the kingdom. Your pastor is not the kingdom. He doesn't control the kingdom. He doesn't have the kingdom. You have to press into the kingdom of God. Hallelujah. Almost finished. Usually it takes a state of emergency to throw us into desperation. It's too bad it has to do that. But human beings are so slothful in their mind. It takes emergency. Something arises. And when they do, it throws them into a desperation. And really in doing that desperation, it brings out the real thing that you are. It shows &gt;&gt; what you are made up of. Hallelujah. Oh, praise the Lord. Thank you, Lord. In Egypt time, it was a real tough hour, you know. Was tough because you're hearing the screams, hearing people holling, people balling night because the death angel moving &gt;&gt; and hearing it coming from a distance &gt;&gt; and what you think about it now from a distance crying going on. A mother wailing because her son is dead in a house. That angel just moved through. &gt;&gt; And the prophet dramatized the children asking the father, "Daddy, are you sure? &gt;&gt; Are you sure we are safe? I hear cries down the road." And the cry is getting nearer and nearer. That's a shaking time. &gt;&gt; You can't eat. &gt;&gt; You can't sleep. &gt;&gt; That's a dreadful night. Actually, that night they wasn't sleeping and rocking that chair. I going to sleep. I going to take a No, no, no. They had the staff in their hand. &gt;&gt; Oh, shoes on the feet. It wasn't sleep time, you know. It was time to move out. I wonder if that time coming back again. &gt;&gt; A desperate time. Time to leave this place. Time to leave this world. I wonder if we coming back to that again. Hallelujah. A midnight time. A midnight cry. A midnight hour. People lay back in the message. They relaxing. &gt;&gt; Bible say, "Yeah, you're relaxing." But then something going to happen that changes everything. Oh my. Hallelujah. It was a shaking time. The daddy are you short time? You see, when we have genuine love, what does it do? It pushes our faith out to the battle for God. Genuine godly love for God and for his word and for his people will push faith out there. Love just takes a hold of faith. That is why it's important to understand that this faith to pull long charity is based upon forgiveness. If we can love the brethren, if we can have genuine forgiveness and dropping odds, how could we access this presence and power? And I was sharing how we need the Lord. We really need the Lord. &gt;&gt; All this corona virus, the Corona virus, I respect if any message you believe have books, it will knock you out, will kill you &gt;&gt; because it's a judgment. &gt;&gt; That's what it really is. Is debt. &gt;&gt; Are you following me now? &gt;&gt; No. We need the Lord. We need his spirit. We need his power. It is promised. We cannot say send it now. We want it now. We would like to have it now. We are not in charge of that. Like Peter, he was just speaking. But the Holy Ghost fell &gt;&gt; on them. The word seed was going out and the spirit was there to water that seed and make the word spoken made manifest and b them into the kingdom of God. Word turned to spirit in their life. They receive it spirit word into their hearts out of Peter's mouth because Peter is in the body. So he's a dramatized son. He's a channel of God. Hallelujah. Life is flowing through Peter. Eternal life. Oh, glory to God. Zoe, God's own life. Fire from off the altar. Oh, glory to God. The man a even baptized in Jesus name yet. The man never went to one service. The man listened to one book, one tape, but he had testimony from a living witness. That is no dead scripture. That is a living witness. Those b those brothers was written epistles. Hallelujah. That was a living word talking to them. That was a living word preaching to Cornelius's house. The text of what Peter was preaching wasn't written yet. He was living it out. Hallelujah. And the devil had to move out. Oh, glory to God. Isn't this wonderful tonight? Hallelujah. But I'm say God will always meet a desperate soul. He says usually it takes something to drive us into that to that despair to that desperation. It takes something to do. James 5:15, the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availth much. The effectual fervent prayer. He said that is desperation. What is desperation? Effectual fervent prayer. It's similar to he that committed God must believe that he is and he's a reward of them that diligently, energetically, fervently seek him. So there's a way to seek God. Father, oh I love you, Lord. And you know it is not no desperation. That just talk a Trinidad hiding under the the breath of prayer. We're not talking about that kind of thing. You know, when you're desperate, it reflects in your action, your attitude. It reflects in your desires and everything else. Oh, glory to God. The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man. &gt;&gt; Fervent prayer. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God. And as in the Bible teaching when Elijah Elisha didn't know what is wrong with the child, God didn't tell him everything. He started to pace the floor. He started to pace the floor. Start to what happening? He's desperation. He want to know what happening. The child fall dead. This can't work. I give the woman a promise and this can't happen. And hallelujah. They put the child in the room getting desperate. Hallelujah. He paced on the floor. But I'm saying he paced on the floor. Why? Something moving in him. &gt;&gt; He said, "Lord, is your will. If God if it be your will, Lord. Um if the child live, will he live? Die, die. We bury him." No, it wasn't. That wasn't it. That what we have now. Lord, if it's your will and people just accept the condition, accept the diabetes, accept cancer, accept tumor, accept whatever they want to accept because if God be for us, we are the miracles. Hallelujah. Where's the desperation to see the miracle? Now, if we don't say this, if we don't preach, people wouldn't expect miracles. They expect to be dead and buried. They expect to sick and die. Where are the miracles if God before us? Oh, glory to God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Listen to this. Jacob, we find out, we know Jacob, he he he had to meet his brother, Esau. He sent his wives one way, children one way and everything else. But Jacob falling on his knees and then he get desperate. Hallelujah. says and to that the that's the only way you'll able to get to achieve the thing that you're wanting is to desperately come. I must have it tonight. I get it now or I'm finished. Tomorrow is too late. I have to have now. And I read this because I want to bring this next part. When you pray for the baptism of the Holy Spirit, the token, &gt;&gt; here we call it. When you pray for the baptism of the Holy Spirit, the token, don't say, "Well, now I'll go up and try. Lord, I'm a little tired." He say, "Oh, mercy." Stay in your seat. Don't even make an attempt. If you come and say, "I'll pass through the prayer line. Put oil in my head. I'll see if it does me any good. You might as well sit where you are until you get to that place until the whole church here we go. until the whole church gets to a place that is between life and death. Then you you you have it have it now a perish then God will move on the scene. It takes desperation to bring God on the scene. We know Jacob got desperate and then Jacob holding on and so on and some people say I see a light. He said glory to God. He said there you are you deceived. Somebody said I feel so good brother Brandham. I went down there and prayed. Shivers run over me. That might have been God. I saw a light that still might have been God, but that ain't what I'm talking about. He's talking about Jacob stayed there until something happened that make him walk different, made him a different person because he stayed until something happened. Not until he hear a good message. You find I will be beating that and I will keep beating it until it strike home. Not until you hear another sermon. We are people who sit and hear a sermon and say amen. And they live they live in rotten. They are terrible people people terrible behave but they're doing a duty. Amen. Amen. That's the word. Nothing happened to them. Nothing happened to them. They are ameners of word. Hallelujah. The amen in word and when they leave they forget what what the word they amen. Oh hallelujah. My God. But here this bomb here now. Jacob stayed here until something happened that made him walk different. made him a different person because he stayed until that happened. The Bible said he held until he prevailed. How can a man prevail over God? But you can do it. You can do it. A man can prevail over God. But you can't be desperate till God speaks to you. So you have to hear direct from God. You say, "Oh church, rise, shake yourself, pinch your conscience, wake yourself up in this hour. We must be desperate or perish." There is coming forth something from the Lord. I know it as dust, say the Lord. There is coming forth something and we better be desperate is between life and death. It will pass through us and we won't see it. Blind Batimus when he cried out to Jesus they tell him you're making shut up. It made too much a noise but he was desperate and he what you do he screamed out he say oh Jesus no matter they told him to stop he cried out just the same that more louder when they told him to shut up it made him get louder because he was desperate. &gt;&gt; Nobody could stop him. He said, "Lord have mercy upon me." That was enough. Oh, glory to God. Hallelujah. And Christ left what he was doing to minister to him because God always respond to a desperate soul. Musician come please. Desperation calls for a subject. And when the subject, no matter how faint it is, it's received. It is believed right then. Oh my. Peter, we know Peter, he fell in the water and so on. And he said, "Christians, tonight if you're in a line of duty trying to follow the leading of the Holy Spirit and a cancer grab you, death grabs you, a cancer tub or what whatever it is." He said, "Scream out and said, "Lord, save me." Hallelujah. God heard him in the line of duty. He started to sink. He failed. No matter if you fail, that don't have nothing to do with it. I think worth reading again. God heard him. He said in the line of duty he started to sink. He failed. No matter if you fail that don't have nothing to do with it. We all fail. We are failed to begin with. But we got somebody standing now with a strong hand who can reach us and take us above the water. And if you make a mistake, some woman make a mistake, some man made a mistake, some boy or girl made a mistake, don't sink. Scream out in despair, "Lord, save me or I'll perish. Get desperate about it." God will hear you. He always hears a desperate soul. Oh my. And Jesus is humility. He said, "Not my will but thine be done." He prayed earnestly. He said, "Brother, sister, if Jesus had to pray earnestly, how much more have we got to pray earnestly?" If God of heaven made flesh had to pray earnestly, then how much more we are sinners saved by grace. So where are we putting all the arrogance that we see in this message? All the hostile behavior, all the proud and and so on like that. And people believe that because they have a book or tape or believe this message that everything is fine. They just made it over already. They are deceived. Devil deceived them. Fully deceived. They failed to understand that those two million people that came out of Egypt wasn't going to make it to the promised land. Yeah. Yeah. Two million people come out under Moses tapes, books and tapes and Moses message. They all say we going. Hallelujah. We're going to the Red Sea. Hallelujah. But they couldn't see the carcass fall in the wilderness. They couldn't see the time begin to unfold and reveal the unbelief in their system. They couldn't see the God that sees the end from the beginning saw the next generation moving in. &gt;&gt; They couldn't see their children is who going to cross over with Joshua and Caleb. They couldn't see that &gt;&gt; their attitudes and their mindset was so difficult and tough that God say you know what not one of them going over their children will go over their children will cross over. Hallelujah is God we serve. I think the last message we preach on talk about Ezekiel 9 about the inorn writer and you know what the Bible says start in my sanctuary and then they begin at the ancient men before the house before destruction strike the city before destruction strike Los Angeles before destruction strikes the world he will start in his house to the very people who claim to believe him, love him and serve him. &gt;&gt; He said, "Begin at my sanctuary." &gt;&gt; Judgment actually begins right there and from there it goes out. &gt;&gt; Begin at my sanctuary. This is not a game. This message is not a play thing. This is the word from the Lord. And the word of the Lord came unto me saying, "Oh, glory to God. When that word come, that word can't fail because that word is God." Oh, hallelujah. Thank you Jesus. But Brandham says the people had their own camp but they had to change their campgrounds in order to see the supernatural. &gt;&gt; When God deal with the people for many years, God is not in the camp anymore because they made theelves a self-made camp, &gt;&gt; not God's camp of his word, a camp of their own. He had to leave them for he is the word. And he cannot stay where people are taught out of the word. Every group that off the word God can't stay there. Yes, they acknowledging this and God prophet he move out already because God and the word is the same. That's why he say what the tape say. Don't say with no cuckoo revelation, no new revelation. Some revelation the prophet did not bring and it's sing good but it's not the scriptures. It can't match all from Genesis to revelation. Hallelujah. So I to stay with this. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Who vex loss? Glory to God. I'm going to close. If you are not in the kingdom of God, press into it. Surely I would have knowledge of what I'm speaking of. God would never honor my prayer to do what he does and you are outside the kingdom. Seek Christ as your refuge now. Oh my. You say, "Man, press into it." You don't just stand around and say, "Pick me up by the color, Lord. Push me in." You press into it. You get desperate between life and death. Oh my. You begin to play something. I'm done tonight. And this is what I had to share with you tonight. Oh, glory to God. The purpose that God sent the Holy Ghost. He says he's waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God. When God will make himself known. Oh my. For 50 years, God has made himself known by scriptures, by text, by revelation, by the word since the prophet have left. But we're talking about waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God. When God will make himself known when they will stop sickness, they will stop cancer. They will stop diseases. You think cancer is something? The Bible said there will come a time when men will rot right in their flesh and the buzzers will eat off the carcasses before they even die. Cancer is a two take to what's coming. But remember that horrible thing was forbidden in that day to touch those who are the seat of God. That's what we are striving for now to get in and be positionally placed into the kingdom of God before these horrible plagues strike. Corona virus that is not the end. It have more plagues coming. It have worse coming. That is just a tip of the iceberg that the Lord could show what he can do, what he can allow, what he can permit, what he can show to man with all his intelligence and in all his science and all his technology. He can show that something that your eyes can't see. Hallelujah. Is affecting people, affecting lives. And all around you seeing mask all over the world because people don't want to get this virus as he says. Oh, glory to God. But there is another there's a inoculation of the Holy Ghost that God want to give oh to whosoever will. Who wants it? Who wants the Holy Ghost tonight? Who wants to reach out tonight? Oh, glory to God. Would you sing that, brother? Reach out. You hear the word, &gt;&gt; but where's the time to reach out and touch the Lord? Where's the time to say, "Lord, I need you. I want more of you." We want to give it that time. He's passing by. Very moment your needs to supply. reach out and touch the Lord as we he passes by. I hope you're not dull. I hope you're not just numb that you can't reach out. I hope that in your heart, in your spirit, you could say, "Lord, I I don't know what other church members are doing. I don't know what other believers doing, but I'm going to reach out tonight. I'm going to reach out and say, Lord, help me tonight. Put that desperation in me, Lord. Put that thirst in me, Lord. Create a revival in me, Lord. Oh, God. I'm here. I'm I'm I'm in need, Lord. I'm in need of you, Father. I need your spirit. Oh, hallelujah. Won't you reach out tonight right where you are in your homes? Would you raise your hands and just give God a a wave offering and reach out to him as you talk to him a little bit? Hallelujah. Father God, I pray tonight that your Holy Spirit will go into the homes, hands raised, Lord, and visit them, Lord. Those that needed healing under those hands, heal them, Lord.

Where you be buried, I'll be buried. A clay cut decision, Father, to serve with all their hearts. Lord, you send the Holy Ghost for a purpose. And that purpose is here, Father God, to be made manifest in the lives of your people. You want to come down that you could say the but we could say the Lord himself is here confirming the word with signs following. Father anoint your people with a cry to get in the spirit. A fervent desire to please you Lord. Grant it father in Jesus name I ask it. Hallelujah. Praise the name of the Lord. Oh thank you Lord Jesus. Yes Lord.

Do you appreciate the word this morning? Oh, we appreciate the team. My God. So, let's get ready. We want to take the tithe offering. Offer with a prayer for it this morning. We are basking in the presence of God this morning. Amen. And cognizant of his presence with us today, let's just bow our heads as we ask God's blessings. Amen. Almighty God, Lord, our hearts are full. Lord, we we thank you Lord. You have poured out grace upon us today. Father, we thank you for your presence, Lord Jesus. Thank you for your hand in our lives, your hand of provision. Lord, now as we just pause to bring the offerings and tithes before you, Lord God, we pray that you bless it as it would be picked up. Lord, bless each one as they give. May you provide for them, Father, in a special way. Bless the ministry there, God, as we continue to labor in the vineyard, Lord. Lord, for the ministry there, God, and putting all these natural things, substances, Lord, towards the glory of God. We pray bless these things in Jesus name. Amen. &gt;&gt; And amen.

Oh, in my heart. Oh Lord, I want to be a Christian in my heart. Amen. Can we give the Lord a hand of praise? We appreciate the Lord this morning. &gt;&gt; What a service. &gt;&gt; What a word in due season. &gt;&gt; To think that that message was preached. I believe there was nobody in the building at the time during the co and that was torred up grain. It's as if it was preached out of season just for today. and to see the Holy Spirit follow the word to confirm the word with a visitation to you that he is still real. He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. And this is just an appetizer of what God has in store. Because I believe in this week, spiritual history is about to be made. Not by the work of man, but the Lord himself just completing the word that he promised to pour out the Holy Ghost to bring deliverance to the captives, to break chains and shackles. &gt;&gt; Amen. Can we give the Lord one more hand of praise? [Applause] &gt;&gt; We do have two notes of praise. I want to thank God and the scenes for prayers. In less than a week, they are both home. God is great. This is from Sister Janice. I believe her sister and her uncle, they were both in the hospital, I believe, but now they are they are back at home. So, we thank God that he's a prayer answering God. and Sister Grace Knight thanking God for 67 years he has given me last Thursday. Thank you for your love and blessings on my birthday. God bless you. Happy birthday, Sister Grace. May God grant you many more years in the service of the Lord. We do have one prayer request from brother Robert for his cousin Wendel Lal for healing from Jon this and also for the salvation of his soul. And if there's any request this morning, you could play something softly as we approach the throne of grace this morning. You want to show by raising hands as we approach the Lord. There are many needs all over the building downstairs. those that are connected, those who may hear the tape as we approach the throne of grace this morning. Heavenly Father, we thank you for your love, for your mercy, Lord, for what you have done, what you are doing, and Lord, what you're about to do. Lord, we have stood behind this sacred desk, Lord, many times and seen prayer requests, Lord, brought before your people in agreement, Lord, as your word declares, if two shall agree, touching anything, we can have whatever we ask for. And we have stood in agreement many times, Lord, and brought these requests before you. And you have seen it fit, Father, to answer prayer. So this morning father we bring Lord Wendel Lal Lord for healing of Jaundice and for the salvation of his soul that even now the angel of the Lord will visit him father that he will know that you are real father and you are the same yesterday today and forever and Lord for every hand that was raised all over the building that the angel of the Lord who knows the thoughts of the heart Lord not just of the mind but of the hearts of the people father for the desires of the people for Lord mothers and fathers fathers, Lord, with a burden for their young people and their children. And Lord, for those that are burdened with family situations, Lord, those that are burdened with financial challenges, those that are burdened with health challenges and issues, those that are burdened with, Lord, all kind of diverse conditions, but Father, you are still the great way maker. You are still the great miracle worker. You are still the great physician. You are still the great way maker, Father. So we come this morning bringing every need before you, every prayer, every situation, every supplication, Lord. Everything that may be overwhelming to your people, knowing that they can cast all their cares upon you this morning, Father, we pray that you would touch your people, you would strengthen your people one more time, Father. And Lord, as we prepare for the convention this week, may you strengthen your church. May you grant traveling mercies to those that are flying in for the meeting. May you bless the local churches that would support the convention. May you bless the local church here, Father. Lord, may you strengthen the ranks of the deacons, Lord. May you strengthen the ushers, Father. May you bless the musicians, Father. May you touch the technical team, Lord. those that in the parking lot, Lord. Those that are in the nursery and the choir room, those that will be in the kitchen, Father. Lord, may you touch the song leaders and the worshippers, the singers, Lord, and those that will take a part, Father. Lord, may you bless the ministers that would bring greetings, Father. May they be like flaming swords uh fresh from the presence of Almighty God. Lord, may nothing be said that you don't once said, and may only what you once said be said. May spirit spoken words utter from each son of God, those that would minister the words, Father, from behind the fire, the altar of fire. Lord, may this island shake under the power and impact of the Holy Ghost. Lord, may the world shake under the power of the Holy Ghost. We know this message is real. We know that you are real, Lord. We know there's no problem you cannot solve. And we believe that for such a time as this, Father, Lord, all things are ready. Let the fire fall. May you anoint each brother, every sister. May the backsliders be restored. May the sick be healed. Uh may the blind eyes pop open. May those that have been hanging on. Uh may they be brought to strength. Father, you promise there'll be one more ride. You promise there'll be a last great kill. You promise we leap over walls. You promise Joel's army will rise again. You promise a restoration. You promise a super churchuh. You promise a seventh and a revival. You promise that the promise of the Holy Ghost uh is just as real uh as it was in the day of Pentecost uh and we claim and identify every single promise uh not one shall be left behind. Lord, as Moses uh was preparing to leave Egypt, uh he said not one uh shall be left behind, uh Lord, in this season. We pray for our families. Uh we pray for our loved ones. Uh we pray for the weaker ones. Uh your prophet taught us the third Pope is for the weaker ones. Uh Father, may the faith banks rise. Uh even the Lord Jesus said, "I prayed for you that your faith don't fail." So father we approach this week with faith. We approach this week with confidence. The devil could do what he wants to do. But we have a revelation of who we are, who's we are, what our promise is, what your purpose is. Lord, you have inspired our pastor with a vision for this meeting. Father, it's no longer about man, but we are walking in the heavenly vision. Father, for sir, is this the time for the manifestation of the sons of God? So may you have your way. May everything be done in order in decency. Lord, may your spirit be pleased to move into the camp, Lord. We are a needy people. We are not a perfect people, but you promise a ministry of perfection, Lord. We come with our cups empty, Lord. And to see how you have shown yourself alive to us this morning to remind us that it's not a work of man. It's not our natural effort. You said if except the Lord build a house, they labor in vain that build it. Father, Lord, we could only do what we could do. But you said we got to do something for something to happen. So, Father, it's your convention. Lord, it's not our convention. It's your convention. Have your way. If you need to break us, break us. If you need to change us, change us. Whatever you want to do, we open every door. The prophet beats doors in doors. Uh we open every door this morning. the doors to our cars, the doors to our homes, the doors to our hearts, the doors into our situations. Have the liberty, have your perfect way. Lord, you are the potter. We are the clay. Father, may you touch your people. May you bless the services, Lord. Seven services. Go look seven times, seven voices, seven thunders, seven church ages. the ministry of that seventh messenger to our final people who will be the final voice to the final age. Father, may every service go higher and higher. Lord, may the ministers be hardly able to minister because you would step down. Lord, you promise a pillar of fire will rest on the shoulders of the adopted sons. Uh may this be that season, Lord. We have not been this way before, but we have been here for a long time. Uh Lord, you said we don't need to know the mechanics. But we need the dynamics, Father. So, Father, let the dynamics fall. Strengthen your people one more time. We give it over to you, Lord. Bless every service. Bless the efforts. May you give us strength that we don't even know. Father, may you be with us, Father. Strengthen us in the inner man. Those that are on the edge, may this be their season. We commit your people into your hands. And may you grant traveling mercies as we prepare to leave this place, but not from your presence. in the mighty precious name of Jesus Christ. And the church says, &gt;&gt; And the church says, &gt;&gt; "Amen." &gt;&gt; Amen. You may be seated for a few announcements. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; The devil is in trouble. &gt;&gt; Sickness is in trouble. &gt;&gt; Diabetes is in trouble. &gt;&gt; Female condition in trouble. &gt;&gt; High blood pressure in trouble. &gt;&gt; Low blood pressure in trouble. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And for the Eagles, those that are battle scarred, your scars are part of your testimony. &gt;&gt; Time to knock your head against the wall and as only the eagle could renew his strength. &gt;&gt; So, we're looking for renewal of strength &gt;&gt; as we go into this week. So, may the Lord richly bless you. We want to welcome Beverly Pikton, invited by Sister Meen. God bless you. Welcome. Thank you so much for coming. We trust that you are blessed. God bless you. So service continues for the convention. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So this coming Friday, we have two services. The service times have been published. But just to remind you, this coming Friday service at 2:00 p.m. and at 700 p.m. This coming Saturday, three services, 10:00 a.m., 300 p.m. and 700 p.m. And this coming Sunday, two services, 10:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. We want to encourage the church, make every effort to be on time, to be available to provide whatever support is required. We will have our final full meeting of those who have a part to play in the convention and those who are offering their service to support. We'll have it at the back of the church after service just to align on a few things uh for a number of different areas that we just want to make sure we are all on the same page on. Maintainance team group one, please meet with brother Pockwell after the service and during the convention. We welcome any support with maintainance during the services. With respect to the convention meals, we want today to be the final day to close off registration for our church. I want you to appreciate that there are quite a number of different logistics from our local church to those that are flying in to manage how we take care of those as well as the dynamics of the various local churches that would visit that would visit the convention. So for our local church, we want to encourage you to get any orders you have in today so that we could have a very clear picture as we go into this week. And uh I think that should be it. All right. So may the Lord bless you. Am I forgetting anything, brothers? Okay, cool. So, uh I'm hearing that brother Pwell, today is your birthday. I know that you have been getting birthday greetings on random days, but I think today we finally got it right. So, brother Popp, may God bless you on your birthday and I believe it's sister Donna K's birthday as well. Is it true today as well? So, happy birthday and may God give you both a birthday gift this week &gt;&gt; by a new birth and a experience with the Holy Ghost. Okay. Wonderful. So, may the Lord richly bless you. Musicians, you could play something. And church, be under expectation. &gt;&gt; Be under great expectation. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said, "You get what you expect." Amen. &gt;&gt; And if you come expecting great things, I have never seen God fail yet. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, "Dig a valley full of ditches." Because if you expect rain to fall, the more of a valley you dig is the more water you could hold. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Brother wants me to remind you, don't run off like a speeding bullet. I think he used that phrase last week as well. He said, "There's a lot of work to be done. We appreciate every hand that's available to support as today is the last major day we are all here. So if you could lend your support we would appreciate that. May the Lord bless you. &gt;&gt; It's a new day. A fresh anointing is coming my way. A season of power, season of and authority. Amen.
