========================================

hallelujah I'm gonna start I turn away you put the devil heat upside down you don't know what to think about you you see you want to come back noises in the streets at zero [Applause] three of the guardsmen how many want to deal with the issues there's a lot of shout I'm not hearing that so you have to deal with it I'll sit and see it again and again until under it stick you can't defeat me cannot be better consent [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] w otherwise you may be seated praise Micah Rafi under them started the double turn attached all nine years as a same old devil but we can [Applause] smokin the rose [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] we've been anointed God Jesus use the words of spirit is upon me he hunted me all right and the background I was chosen of human mind because a human mind is where decisions are made friends dad forgive me but I love decisions I love the truth I love from my choice because I choose that choice is there something in house because you [Applause] let me see them Sam C is presented as a mallet big muscles and big activity nihilism but the truth was something with a smaller fella them right [Applause] Oh mr. Taylor didn't miss nothing [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] what she says although real Oh glory see what you feel is what Samson's feel came upon him he had no books you have no church leader even you come on now I'm gonna be anointed I'm dragging [Applause] a man cannot sing until the first cast aside godswood until she gets rid of the word of God the presence of God cannot sing though I've ever said the Lord is at my right hand I shall not be moved I'm still again but he said the Lord is on my right hand I shall not be moved in all ways they both used to be practicing the presence of God at the glories with him because when people feel the Lord not be the one that did this they want to do that but they want to do that they want to do that because the Lord he's not they cannot see him but if he said the Lord is of mine shall not be moved hallelujah that's why the Bible says in the mount of torchi witnesses learn everything they establish so you can't just a report about someone and there's no evidence or witnesses you'll be receiving a report isn't that right that's why if somebody offend you or something we won't tell somebody good to that person with them I give a reference one time you can see somebody calls about some water or something some bottle and that's when a report come he wasn't about drinking you didn't see him drinking that's a report but a car broke down when I got some water tap on a radiator but because it was seeing that we and instead of verifying information somebody won with that an estimate he was drinking evil figures in Curitiba that's assumption that's come saying like everything in a garage that car but suppose they learn more the four wheels it was in the guard things like that love for truth not gossip not personnel not just talk for truth because they cheated what sets people free but I can t give a testimony about a woman with five boys and he didn't finish it off finish it off in London you just got the tip and we gonna put it on your website Charlie got it but he was telling a woman listen if the doctors take off your wing I think you do I don't see you happy feet yeah if you kind of feed for the fibers to be healed how you are faithfully sorry going to be restored the other long story short the woman was healed and completely decided probably this sucks this sucks I have five boys such as right 1390 facts but what is right what is akela you see I wanted to rise to the challenge - it was us leave the life of the people they'll put in a box because they might have feit that you go ahead are you going higher you went further they were kinder you they will box you in say can't bother with people trying to put boxes around me they have to study what God want unfolding your very life amen you love him if this church know what something imma see if Satan can get you here in these conch shells and all these things if he gets right down and the soul in the mind you will never look at one of them things until first you let him in there you have to listen in I when it gets in he got control he'd be got to use of conscience he began to use your outlet which is your feel your tears your imagination your memory and what he began to use these different channels see and he will back to you and it can't get to you until you accepted so come like this if if the if the if the arm pulls lady bring a package for you and your see sent from a lot of snakes and a ton the other save it and you know it snakes inside the day do not decipher that I am NOT saying for that package whoever said it ticket back besides a coil fever called disease sickness this sign sign for that I'm seal the Saturn be something different okay let me sign for that raise god-killer sounds just such the Lord be with me I shall be able to type [Applause] you wanna summer Caleb day there he has set down with a more young people wanna go God how strong he is yes their muscles in the gym every day I can't fight them on my side calf like a muscle gain we can we go [Music] [Music] expanded the tree signs are there now turn to what Gary Coxe every influencer that come negatively to your life we're gonna throw it out I'm not already done destroy them out the Bible said in my name - I don't ever start out the preachers when do not you know visit these things come on oh yeah sit down sit down sit down sit down damn talk to you the Lord of shoot in the house and there's no select the bodies that our Lord Himself everywhere in the kitchen don't tongue in the brush where ever you go you are escorts the angel of the lord encamps around will be afraid I want to get to fill out your system please God this is you could be seeing a wrong group and you're looking for the right group but I read for you there is no real group and B sends them that God has said not Church of there's no certain organization not Google say we have it yes Aaron doesn't have it that's a spirit you know it's a superior agency okay if this church right now could be put together and knitted together with such that every person would be one accord with not one shadow of doubt anywhere there would not be a feeble person in our midst in another five minutes there will be nobody here design the Holy Ghost but pop would receive it you can get that certain thing fixed it if I could change America changer behavior if the worker change our mind if you change your life but you have to wonder change be transformed by the renewing of your mind you're mine have to change before you have to change that's why God started writing some new heart I'll give you and you stir it and then I put my spirit inside your spirit what it is changing your mind changing the torch changing desires we said court invading your very life all right when Jesus came on the scene what always been against the truth that's the reason today we can't have faith faith is not based upon man's theology feet is based upon the solid rock of God's eternal world before continue I want to see back something we talked about right spirit wrong doctrine better than right doctrine done wrong spirit that's true but God didn't send a prophet for staff right spirit on wrong doctrine he's on a profit of you have the right spirit unlike doctrine I want a meal that dog so I'm not advocating this right spirit right spending on those on a profit Natasia the Lord and that profits that the spirit the bride and the Prophet will be saying the same thing and what they say will have already been said in the world it can take away from it it stops here the Lord so watch so jesus a carpenter's son physically speaking when it came to this here he was known of the data John baptized him God vindicated him God spoke from the heavens John so I'm coming on in the form of a dove and said this is my beloved Son in whom I am pleased to dwell the right translation here is in whom I am pleased to dwell in Jesus immediately anointed with God he was just a man till that time no he becomes a god man so the anointing of God brings you to become a god man you see God is a spirit and Christ means The Anointed One a man anointed with God or give the Lord some praises people and just as a man could be anointed with God a man could be anointed with the devil listen to this Jesus was God yet a big job he went over to the mimic in Dodaro who has been a wild man for years a young fellow we were told had lost his human reasoning lived in trillions with an evil spirit what a place for a man to live in a great job is very fitting for the devil to the among dead things so he lived out there and was so terribly afflicted with these demons he proteins his trait was super strength did he ever see a man that had been stricken by the evil spirit like that is several times of strength I have noticed them in the meetings when groups of police could maybe heal them they would tear them produce the pieces and carry on because why he is fully surrendered to the evil one took possession of him and had not a stone understanding he only did what the evil spirit put in him to do then I taught but complete surrender to the devil a man can be five times of strength what could complete surrender to God to a man that's weakened the body that can't walk if we could complete the yield to the Holy Ghost God will give us a super strength to rise in the name of Jesus Rasulullah is in the world center chorus in you is greater than any infection that can come upon you there is nothing can overtake you but usually superseded because you are foolish and that super is the holy spirit that dominates your life if you are Christian meaning everybody that could be here every sick person to get a punch on their own you could shake it off yes [Applause] oh Jesus he was not Pat God he was all gone he created the winds of waves other things have to obey Him he was the creator notice let us remember he also created our bodies he create wings to create waves if it sees you officials and he created our bodies let man come for the dust of the earth and God for man fruits of the spirit man Genesis 1 then a dustman Genesis 2 and God put the spirit man in the dust man that's you and I here this morning moon and stars and everything else to obey Him so now he's coming out the poet was safe that's why I'm understood Jesus he was he went into the wilderness overcome the loss of the eyes become the lusts of the flesh we welcome the pride of life because before born empowers a man but full power he has to be able to himself that's nothing that's gospel that's nothing but the truth people power and have no character no power for them I think on rolling back power no because what stingy and what paying hard to get hard to give his ruling back power lucky you know you seen characters no no power to behold it isn't much is it kept on top of that maybe Ruth Oh hallelujah the Prime Minister's president time in opposition to one week so they call it power did to change a different cap fit the head the poor the struggle in the Scranton and someplace in London they on top the world every and folded round it moves up in here I'm God looking for somebody to mow God blesses in more humble they become the more you can power my God because there was so creative humble himself and came to us and God want you to look that out please God you believe that so watch here in our bodies winter bodies will be him you surrender your thoughts to him you surrender your life to Him you surrender your feet to him and watch that buddy will be what he says if you're a drunkard and you can't quit drinkin surrender their life to him and what you will drink no more if you are habitual smoke and try to give it up and cab do it just surrender that to him and what what happens he will make that body come in subjection to the word but you have got to surrender it to him ship the spirit upon them praise God somebody believe your prayer because they want to continue what they're doing so they'd already won no deliverance you ready don't want to break you they know it's right the no church nice to vote I never come and get blessed but already want

omnipotent and omnipresent speaks the miraculous please omnipotent speak take a man death how many tears always right what about I'm said one time on a challenge of feet that's a great statement for

after Limbaugh's men die why the plot the kingdom oh it's many people think we too know it you know it's good to hear from God hear this wait till the voyage coming here I knew that this God is dusted a lord if it isn't dust is the Lord then it's your impression it's what somebody else thinks they request people see this for me do this for me how can you do it if you're not if you're honest with God until God first tells you how can I tell you dost hear Jack Moe and Jack hasn't said nothing to me it has to come from God not impress it's got to be God then it will happen for it is dasya the Lord woman came to brother Branham and she couldn't have a child and so and she could get pregnant and so on and belong to us alone you have a big only thought she could have a lot of women are they talking talking she told her what neither what that some time later on she came back to Bella Branham and she said Brown you know when time or not a woman and a dog and I a believer and I shower them he said what did he see she said he said thus says the Lord he said wearing a believe it'll be just us alone no witness doesn't know it a us and upon a woman and not even resting upon a future nor has decayed and that's the same as as I will restore gotta ask if you were to restore anything all you wanna know is that I will restore to you or they yes [Applause] and the Holy Spirit if a man is anointed of God will direct you to follow the Holy Spirit and the Bible for he is the one who do these things Jesus Christ in the form of the Holy Spirit or my praise God so for my resume my other two teachers is a duster the Lord during 2:30 itself be glad if cherubs and rejoice in the Lord for giving us a marine moderately I will course a comment for you to rain the formal arena in the first month and the floor shall be full of wheat and the faction were heard when an oil and I restore to you the years Lucas eaten the concubine the caterpillar family my great army shall eaten plenty and my people shall not be ashamed now it says God will restore the neutron is to know restore the church it starts at the Reformation Israel right watch now this very moment we are in the complete fulfillment of Matthew 24:24 and so much if it possible deceive the very elect and who is it that they attempt to deceive the very elect this print of the antichrist and the false waiting one the last is these false one already come in Jesus name claiming that they've made an idol of God for this last day the affairs massage anointed ones they claim their profits what they are one with the world never we have added or taken from it no one denies the spell of God manifested ins dis upon them but like Balaam the all of the programs made up even money exercise gives the deny the word and bypass it for fear that a controversy might diminish their chances for it again yep it's our vision on deliverance through the power of God like Judas with a ministry and patted by Christ but because they are wrong seed consequently they have the wrong spirit motivate in them and watch this part of a negative the outshine elect an effort and zeal but it is now addition not of Christ for it looks for big crowds big programs signs among them the preacher second coming and so forth but deny the advent of a prophet passenger though in power and signs and true revelation eclipse in them all yes it is part this falls through the last days is so close to real can be distinguished here we go only by its deviation from the word not by an region that by shouts that might jump in my singing not by specialist not by worship but by deviating from the world that's why we said the prophet and the bride and the Spirit sees the same thing and what they say will be already in the world are you with me much they can distinguish only by its division from the world and whenever it is caught in the ant world it falls back on one argument we already are shown to be forced we get results don't we we have to be of God how we get results oh my my are you with me watch watch what he didn't want to go those prophets had things it was hard thing to do didn't want to be going out and this corner they want enough fellowship and go the rest of them I don't want to do this but God has spoken and I must have it what is it like it was it they crucified Him but it is told him whatever it is God has put his heart or pigeons is better than sacrifice watch it was in his heart you must do it it was his life he couldn't hold it there was something I'll see son that push them they couldn't bless opposite God had so much complete control of them till he was their voice diction these prophets so look at Elijah Elijah said not even rain or Dew will fall till I confer the heavens imagine a mandala I never not even do or renal for tonight over these guys wanted but God the Word was God member one promised I'd give me a church that's so completely anointed that God till their every action of movers duster the Lord work and uh Chicana glory I will show you a messiah Anointed One of God standing upon the earth today Oh give me a church goer get one year when all the alleged feels to do in two thousand years you wait till the anointing of the church strikes home did that feels a little remnant after the doors of the Gentiles close call with a anointest juice them he was full to be filthy still he's right to the register all mine at a time so praise God so G Joseph must get my coat of many colors and the pressured hated him he who came to bring them peace but the misunderstood him the hated him with all the coins they didn't try to stop to see what he was trying to achieve they just judge him because listen he didn't agree with them said you agree damn they judge you he makes himself swan song song so the composes it couldn't help trill himself there he didn't dude hypocritically when God tells Moses get away their mother destroys people no just put in Stephanie kept us in Lord before I destroy them destroy me he was genuine spirit of Christ in them so before you take the people take me first there was a spirit of Christ and Moses hallelujah are you with me he never did it for SAP glory watch if they would have looked to the word Buddhist in his purpose he will always do that to glorify the father neither will any servant of God take glory you know what any servant take the gift of God and try to verify himself I want to read it again a servant of God will not take glory Nina what any sort of God take a gift of God and try to glorify himself the Spirit of God working in men make men like God no wonder jesus said is not it with ear gods that is small Gina the G and if they are poor cord doesn't the Spirit of God came to how can you condemn me when I say I'm the son of God they were God's command G because they would hell yeah all right all right because they had completely surrendered themselves to the Spirit of God and they were working for the glory of God David said you come with me and she longs fear but I come to you the name of the Lord he had the right objective here like milk earth isn't that right so when a man is anointed with the spirit now let us go real deep under the fifth rib on the left side when a man are you ready everybody alive is so anointed with the spirit when a man is anointing of the Spirit of God his habits his actions and everything is moving in him some time he's misjudged look at the difference my God might go wild or forsake me that was a spirit of Christ indeed it I went to reason with Sam who could ever see that it was the spirit seen my caught my god somebody said this lets the bucket up there who hands his peers who features peers that's the intellectual but one word is limit of spirit would know that was the Spirit of God in him crying out when a man is anointed here we go again of the Spirit of God he has got the action of God are you ready and the action of God is never to break us up the action of God is to draw us together so we are one in Christ Jesus God's purpose is to bring us together to love one another did you get that the actual employer is not to break up pick up husband and wife pick up families break up churches pick up this book uh back then of the action of God the actions ones that bring together he's making a bride he is hewn the chips no chopping off the world watch he's cutting you don't know cut you down to his word only cutting all the crease and drachmas and everything away from you trying to get back a bride for the son another masterpiece part of the world hopefully become bright cut cheese shape you to be his bride you got already all to himself he wants the Christ with his taking a bride for his son Jesus Christ not a church of his son a bride for his son and that bride is made up of members who are part of him who is part of that world so you could never get fight with the word because you are going to be the wood itself so when the word hit you you could let me say Amen what is you you are part of that word isn't that right so therefore you get boot to the tree on the day of Pentecost isn't that right move twenty for 39 and do a performant hi and here you can eat to the tree the holy ghost Pentecost justification sonification the path only goes and then Christ come to dwell in it to bring forth the proofs fruits justification summer vacation back to the Holy Ghost then the person of the Holy Ghost comes in that to bring forth the fruits oh my so all to the ages all these organizational vines or branches rather and what God keep doing cutting them off they produce a Baptist branch Methodist branch pentecostal budget-cutting at all because I fled original branch gordon make a chemical structure Baptist Church Methodist Church pictures it'll make those things men set up those things so as the vines and branches push out because Baptist after Stein Catholic up this kind Methodist after style everybody up this time but what of attend to every scene after print or not this time - hallelujah watch they are dead and the Unruh come in the presents we will cover the fish resurrection with the fine fruit of organization watch the reporter or a reserve group and they would come with the food of the vine so we cannot point you to this church or point it's an organization or point you to a system you have three points of Jesus Christ because he's the vine and you are the branch unexpected for to talk to you a mannequin our wife is to produce children it's the producer is the produce food you want the pump is right to produce signs of Christ Messiah will be on the air oh my god other suns I'm dropping a comfort because I'm proud my will be happy and I make it hallelujah as a son plays positionally he fell and got some other reboot with some new to process a dime a piece on a Dutch Sun but your son as it was please Nick a marine for don't Boone God said I want to bring them to children know that I'm gradually good process and listen God Himself didn't bypass it because ice was born our future and so he went through the process social crisis a teenager Christ as a young man crisis a carpenter had a witness

[Applause] [Music] [Applause] no watch watching much I am the vine or caps Kabaddi watch now how do we get to tell everybody by one spirit first coming James 12 and by one spirit we were baptized into one body and the spirit is the life of Christ is that right the life of Christ and the life of any seed which he was the root seed brings the seed to leave if that life is lean in the seed the seed is the word and this baptism of the Holy Spirit comes upon it it wants to bring that seed so the 7-inches message is not the seven seals quality left our gentile workers to receive the same p the food's our receive the even time message restore back that same thing again if that tree puts another branch it repaired original fruit and there's got to be a restoration of all these things at the end of the vine so what this is a branch this is a pant here this is stem and have all kind of branches the right to the top original back gonna pick up and that's is they gonna get oranges out what there's capsicum for a restoration and even light to light up and make it right it will come out of the vine not a denomination that grafted into it but the original production of the world and it constructed the ethan time and watch no matter how much you preach here we go whatever you do it cannot be ripened it cannot be manifested it cannot be vindicated only my image that i am the light of the world so

so I cap please nothing apply anybody or say I'm better this one no I'm with them it was power become a secret is power the power we're gonna get always we are waiting upon that and the power is not the thing really is the seed is the main thing and the seed is that right what will happen for the clothes so many says if the Lord routine is useful for me from drinking from gambling from lying or stealing I serve him but that's up to you we've got something to do overcomes shall inherit all things Co prior to get when it's up to you shocker I said and I said lordy on your on his mind Lord sensorless tripping bashing Cutlass and trim clean for me look back on how you print good for your horse to get clean it all star get clean with a broom are you thinking with paper and you slip in here and you cleanly and that's all that was get clean dr. shrinky Holmes but if you expect I enjoy the calm down type system what you are sleeping keep on with you keep it on three it's just that prayer is not the answer you're wasting time I can get it clean up anybody that's up to you something you got to do did overcome linear All Things D that you become your power to do it but you must be willing to Liat now she has made herself ready you see God could not push you to a pipe put you all on the other side and say blessed he said / comment you had nothing to overcome he just push you true but you have got to make decisions for yourself I have my decisions for myself and then twin des we show our faith and respects to God oh praise God but God is the creature living in you giving

which strike in real support come away from it for it takes him from your heart oh how the dear brother sister if you haven't got the baton twirlers this morning run is it a kingdom of God as quick as you can Oh hallelujah disciples had power but enough heat to move the power and that's what the matter with a church today the people that they like a power know there's a lot of shittim is a power what is it you have got to get the word and what you have got to get with the word and get yourself killed out I am persuaded that many of us friends there we go I've received the Holy Ghost but we received enough Holy Ghost to make us the place or we don't want to lie we don't want to steal we don't want to do anything but God wants to fill every fiber of his church he wants to fill your thinking he wants to fill your mind he wants to fill a bit of you so if you watching movies movies movies what chance would have to put anything in your mind because you caught up in that movie world you caught up in that magazine or the columns in that nother world and God have no place to inject himself but as you die out and all the nervous side up move this way the movies had to move out there and go at a moving movies move out this presence in the individual with the personal vindication of himself expressing himself the living world that is promised itself through you it's not a group I'll take one I'll live one it's a nonce indication of a pragmatic child of God I'm longing for the Honorable to meet you and and create you and God bless you and they know your Christian they don't know what church you go into your Christian because of your life you're not a Christian or I go to church Christian because you have a testimony of Christ in fact in your life [Music] so filled with the Holy Ghost but live in itself watch personal vindication it's an individual one person all hell is against this teaching all hell is like in this truth I own that musician talk please thank you
