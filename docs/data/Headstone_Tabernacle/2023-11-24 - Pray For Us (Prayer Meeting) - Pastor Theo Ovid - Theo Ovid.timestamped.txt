[13:29] prayer session tonight in Jesus name we
[13:31] ask it amen and amen God bless you and
[13:34] welcome to each and every one of you
[13:36] tonight and um tonight I have an thought
[13:41] to share with you and the title of it is
[13:43] pray for us and um I need your prayer
[13:48] Wednesday night I I I was very in lots
[13:52] of pain and I thought that it was a back
[13:55] back problems and stuff but then it was
[13:58] my kidneys acing up and it was the pain
[14:01] was just you know was terrible so much
[14:04] that my wife told me it's best to send
[14:06] up a tape that they play I said no I I
[14:08] have to be there so I craw into the
[14:11] church but by the time I got by in the
[14:13] Pulpit it was different and then I'm
[14:15] still under some uh some little
[14:18] difficulties but God is good so I want
[14:20] you to pray but that is not uh I just so
[14:24] happened that I sort of present a pray
[14:26] request tonight for me but I really want
[14:28] you to pray for us meaning the ministry
[14:32] I want to share something about that
[14:33] tonight so uh I want to go straight into
[14:36] it tonight but I have a Psalm I like to
[14:39] read from Psalms
[14:41] 34:1 and it reads
[14:43] th Come Ye children haen unto me I will
[14:48] teach you the fear of the
[14:51] Lord what man is he that desireth life
[14:55] and loveth many days that he may see
[14:57] good keep thy tongue from evil thy lips
[15:01] from speaking Gile depart from Evil and
[15:04] do good seek peace pursue it here we go
[15:07] the eyes of the Lord are upon the
[15:10] righteous and his ears are open unto
[15:14] their cry so what that tells us the
[15:17] righteous will cry the face of the Lord
[15:20] is against them that do evil to cut off
[15:24] the remembrance of them from the earth
[15:27] verse 17 this of Psalms 34 the righteous
[15:31] cry and the Lord Hearth and deliver them
[15:36] out of all their troubles the Lord is
[15:40] nigh unto them that have a broken heart
[15:44] and saveth such as be of a contrite
[15:47] spirit I find this a powerful Psalm
[15:49] tonight it tells us what the righteous
[15:52] will do the righteous would cry and
[15:54] Ezekiel 9:4 says the Lord said unto him
[15:57] go to the midst of the city through the
[15:59] midst of Jerusalem and set a mark upon
[16:01] the foreheads of the men that sigh and
[16:04] cry for all the Abominations that be
[16:08] done in the midst thereof so these two
[16:10] scriptures I give you for your
[16:12] consideration you can M on it I want to
[16:15] turn to 1 Thessalonians 5 reading from
[16:18] verse 12 1 Thessalonians
[16:21] 5 reading from verse2 it
[16:24] reads and we beseech you Brethren to
[16:28] know know them which labor among
[16:31] you I want to drive slow on these
[16:34] scriptures because in this age of where
[16:39] the spirit of
[16:40] entitlement is so
[16:42] prevalent that people take things for
[16:45] granted sometime ago I saw a son killed
[16:50] his father that's in the States because
[16:53] he didn't want to work and the father
[16:56] was breaking down his allowance from for
[16:58] 4,000 a month or 3,000 or 2,000 and he
[17:00] was so unhappy he killed his father and
[17:05] it's a a testament of this entitled
[17:09] generation that feel
[17:12] like they deserve this uh they ow this
[17:17] they should have this they demand this
[17:20] and they want
[17:21] this but Paul saying here I beseech you
[17:25] Brethren to know them which Le among you
[17:30] and are over you in the Lord and
[17:35] admonish you so you have to know who is
[17:39] over you who is laboring among you who
[17:43] admonish you verse 13 and to esteem them
[17:48] very highly in love for their work's
[17:51] sake and be at peace among yourselves so
[17:55] he's talking about respects talking
[17:58] about
[17:59] order verse 14 and we exalt you
[18:03] Brethren warn them that are unruly and
[18:07] in going forward this headstone
[18:09] Tabernacle this we will do warn them
[18:12] that are
[18:13] unruly Comfort the
[18:16] feeble-minded support the weak be
[18:19] patient towards all men see that none
[18:23] render evil for evil unto any man but
[18:26] ever follow that which is good
[18:29] both among yourselves and all men
[18:32] Rejoice ever more one two pray without
[18:36] ceasing in everything give thanks for
[18:39] this is the will of God in Christ Jesus
[18:40] concerning you quench not the spirit
[18:44] despise not
[18:45] prophesying prove all things hold fast
[18:49] to that which is good the Bible exalts
[18:51] the church to prove all things we're not
[18:53] supposed to take crap on anything
[18:55] somebody say and claim as a fact prove
[18:58] all all things hold fast to that which
[19:01] is good abstain from all appearance of
[19:06] evil not some all just the appearance
[19:10] and the Very God of Peace sanctify you
[19:13] holy and I pray God your whole
[19:17] Spirit soul and body be preserved
[19:22] blameless un the coming of our Lord
[19:24] Jesus Christ Faithful Is He that calleth
[19:27] you
[19:28] who also will do it and verse 25 is
[19:32] where I get the thought from Brethren
[19:34] pray for us and I want you to pray
[19:36] sincerely for the ministry as you
[19:38] realize that now I'm emphasizing about
[19:41] this 54 Ministry about leadership about
[19:44] God plac and his sons and where it have
[19:47] to start it has to start it has to start
[19:51] acts 4 this is after um the beat
[19:56] disciples after Peter raised that CP man
[19:58] and so like that and they went into a
[20:00] prayer meeting and they gathered
[20:02] together because they want them to stop
[20:04] preaching in Jesus name and verse 29 of
[20:07] Acts 4 says and now Lord to the pr
[20:10] behold your threatment Grant unto thy
[20:13] servants that with all boldness they may
[20:16] speak Thy Word by stretching forth thine
[20:19] hand to heal and that signs and wonders
[20:22] may be done by the name of thy holy
[20:25] Child Jesus and when they had prayed now
[20:28] these are men that are filled with the
[20:30] Holy Ghost these are Apostles these are
[20:32] God's Warriors of the faith at that time
[20:35] when they had prayed the place was
[20:39] shaken where they were assembled
[20:42] together and they were all filled with
[20:44] the Holy Ghost which is a refilling is
[20:46] acts for and they spake the word of God
[20:50] with boldness and the multitude of them
[20:53] that believed were of one heart of one
[20:56] Soul neither said any of them that ought
[21:00] of the things which he possessed was his
[21:01] own but they had all things in common
[21:04] there was no selfishness among them it
[21:07] was a selflessness verse 33 and with
[21:10] great power give the Apostle witness not
[21:15] text not teachings not Revelations not
[21:20] Mysteries but with great power this is
[21:23] scripture give the Apostle witness of
[21:27] the resurrection of the Lord Jesus and
[21:29] great grace was upon them all okay
[21:33] brother BR I'm toal Deliverance if our
[21:37] heart condemn us we want complete
[21:39] deliverance we don't want to be halfway
[21:41] church now he's not talking to Sinners
[21:43] here he's not talking to unbelievers
[21:45] here he's talking to church folks okay
[21:48] we don't want to be halfway we want to
[21:51] be a real church or no church at all he
[21:54] says this this way God will make halfway
[21:56] Christians but Christians can be halfway
[21:58] go don't make halfway preachers but
[21:59] preachers can be halfway so here where
[22:01] we go now we want to be real Christians
[22:04] or no Christians at all we want Total
[22:07] deliverance from our habits our sins
[22:10] from our evil thinking from our evil
[22:13] doing from our negligence whatever we
[22:16] have done we want Total Deliverance so
[22:21] why why so that when people come into
[22:25] this church to be prayed for
[22:28] there will be just this little group
[22:31] maybe not over 100 or two sitting here
[22:34] but they'll be completely in the hands
[22:36] of God and when we pray then God will
[22:40] hear from Heaven God wants somebody that
[22:44] he can hold in his hands somebody that
[22:48] he can say I got confidence in I can
[22:51] send my sick servant of brandham
[22:53] Tabernacle jonville and that group of
[22:56] people are in one Accord
[22:58] something will happen well look at what
[23:01] he does for us in the condition we're in
[23:04] and I say this to you when my wife told
[23:07] me maybe I had to send a tape I was in
[23:10] such pain and I told her to come it was
[23:13] very strenuous and painful but I knew
[23:16] that the Lord give me certain things to
[23:19] say the message about rejection the
[23:23] rejection of the Holy Ghost if you
[23:25] haven't listened to it go back and
[23:26] listen to it it is
[23:28] and that other message um gets into the
[23:30] person Christ Jesus two important
[23:33] Junction message and people don't
[23:36] understand and if you go over the story
[23:38] with Saul how in Simplicity just by
[23:42] simple instructions wait seven days and
[23:45] I'll come and I'll offer up and that
[23:48] what Samuel told Saul and Saul couldn't
[23:49] do it he went and do it himself and then
[23:52] do not himself he kick out the Holy
[23:54] Ghost and he begin to govern and Rule
[23:58] and many ministers they find themselves
[24:00] in that gear of governing ruling
[24:03] manipulating controlling influencing and
[24:07] they are in charge they are the chief
[24:09] they are the chief in charge God is
[24:10] outside somewhere but God doesn't want
[24:13] that so God wants us to be under the
[24:17] direction of the Holy Ghost and he's
[24:19] saying here in verse 78 in in paragraph
[24:22] well look what he does for us in the
[24:25] condition we're in what would he do if
[24:28] we were in one heart and one Accord the
[24:31] only way we can do that here we go the
[24:35] only way we can do that is to unify our
[24:39] hearts together with brly love that's
[24:42] the core brothery love Spirit of
[24:44] forgiveness brothery love putting
[24:47] yourself in your brother's place under
[24:49] the matter brothery love taking off your
[24:52] shoes and putting your foot in your
[24:54] brother's shoes before you criticized
[24:56] and condemn him so with BR love and then
[24:59] next step Next Step BR love obey the
[25:03] officers of the
[25:05] church and the pastor and the pastor
[25:10] obey God that's how it's supposed to
[25:13] flow then he get it right here now then
[25:17] God works through the pastor through the
[25:20] board down into the church and all
[25:23] together one unit to the kingdom of God
[25:26] then God will hear when we have a
[25:30] unified group let nothing bother you
[25:34] don't be dismayed of anything
[25:38] now what's the kind of person that God
[25:40] ordained to take the land Moses was
[25:42] complete he was a man that wouldn't
[25:44] compromise if there were stews and fers
[25:46] and so forth he wouldn't compromise that
[25:48] is what God wants us now Pharaoh War are
[25:51] agree and said Moses you can go but
[25:53] leave your children behind leave some of
[25:55] your cattle back there and then how
[25:57] brother types this that's the way the
[26:01] devil wants a Christian to come so the
[26:04] devil don't mind you go to church that's
[26:07] not a problem devil be message not a
[26:10] problem here's theion it'll be all right
[26:12] for you to join the church but don't you
[26:14] never forgive Jones it'll be all right
[26:17] if you can bring if you don't have to
[26:19] give up smoking drinking lying stealing
[26:22] F finding backbiting you don't have to
[26:23] give that up just join the church but
[26:26] Moses wasn't a compromise
[26:28] he wanted complete deliverance he said
[26:30] we will not leave a ho behind we will
[26:33] take everything that belongs to us and
[26:35] we go and Worship the Lord that's the
[26:37] way the church ought to be we will take
[26:40] righteousness we will take Holiness we
[26:43] will take the Holy Spirit we will take a
[26:45] unified group when we go to the Altar
[26:48] and hear this now we will leave nothing
[26:49] behind you know people can pray in such
[26:52] a way till the devil will have to give
[26:54] in and that's the way Moses and his
[26:57] group did
[26:58] they got over there and they got under
[27:01] the blood you notice until they got
[27:04] under the blood there was no total
[27:06] Deliverance Moses himself he was unified
[27:09] with God but Israel wasn't there was
[27:11] still sin and they mured against Moses
[27:15] they said why do you do this you bring
[27:16] more trouble Upon Us Moses he was
[27:20] totally delivered himself but the people
[27:23] wasn't delivered because there were
[27:26] still murmuring among them
[27:28] one night when God ordained that a lamb
[27:30] should be killed a type of Christ and
[27:32] the blood was dipped in his up just weed
[27:35] and put over the lindle of the door and
[27:37] on the post that is when Israel become
[27:40] completely delivered and that is when
[27:43] the church shall be completely delivered
[27:45] when everything comes under the blood
[27:47] when your sins come under the blood when
[27:49] you're smoking when you're gambling when
[27:51] you're cheating when you're stealing
[27:53] when you're lying when everything is
[27:54] brought under the blood there'll be a
[27:56] total Deliverance yeah we
[27:58] you have wronged somebody make it right
[28:01] you can't bring that under the blood it
[28:03] won't stay you can't bring it something
[28:05] won't let you do it here we go now when
[28:11] yourself is completely and totally under
[28:14] the blood there'll be a total
[28:16] Deliverance then you'll have a freedom
[28:19] like you have never known before when
[28:22] everything is brought under the blood
[28:24] brought in submissive to the kingdom of
[28:27] God
[28:28] then there'll be real Deliverance so
[28:30] friends says you have to have a heart
[28:33] for the kingdom the kingdom of God
[28:36] that's what you want to submit yourself
[28:37] to we're almost
[28:39] done God wants his people to pray when
[28:42] Israel got so taxed in such a condition
[28:45] that they could not go any further their
[28:47] time was fulfilled their burdens was
[28:49] laid further than they thought then they
[28:52] begin to pray and when the people begin
[28:54] to pray then God begin to hear it was
[28:57] time for God's word to be
[28:59] fulfilled after isn't this now after
[29:04] Moses had been
[29:06] recognized and then he switch after the
[29:09] people rather know that they needed a
[29:13] leader they begin to pray so now there
[29:17] are those who try to annal the F4
[29:19] Ministry and say play tapes like the men
[29:21] is irrelevant they just watching a
[29:23] prophet and that's a prophet they're not
[29:25] even concerned about the prophet's
[29:26] prophecy but that's what
[29:28] hop on and stick with Prophet prophecy
[29:30] but watch this the
[29:33] people had to know they needed a leader
[29:37] to begin with and then they begin to
[29:40] pray then to begin to pray to God to
[29:43] send them a leader or someone to bring
[29:46] them out and he sent them a man a
[29:48] prophet that was his sign now you know I
[29:52] beat number six I beat number man but
[29:54] I'm I'm changing now to present to you
[29:57] you that there's going to be a genuine
[29:59] fightful that the bride body have to see
[30:03] the need for these men that God has that
[30:07] ordained to be placed positionally step
[30:09] forward in other words it will take God
[30:13] to empower them with the ministry of
[30:15] Jesus Christ to step forward to take the
[30:17] bride over let me just
[30:19] continue brother isn't it
[30:23] strange that God wants the people to
[30:25] have pattern to it when Jesus looked out
[30:29] upon the Harvest he said the Harvest is
[30:31] ripe the laborers are few you pray the
[30:36] Lord of the Harvest that was him you
[30:39] pray to me that I will send laborers
[30:42] when I say a fold Ministry into my
[30:45] Harvest it is some part you have to do
[30:49] God is waiting for his church to call on
[30:52] him he always did it God is waiting
[30:56] today
[30:58] for the people to call his servant into
[31:00] action I know we read this many times
[31:03] but I trust at this time it is different
[31:06] because of our point of emphasis now
[31:09] concerning the
[31:11] ministry God is waiting for the people
[31:15] to call his servant into action and the
[31:19] servant can't get into action till the
[31:23] people pray so in other words the
[31:26] ministers could preach till all the
[31:28] black hair turn gray and all the gray
[31:29] hair fall off the head he's not talking
[31:32] about preaching talking about getting
[31:34] into action and the servant can't get
[31:38] into
[31:39] action until the people prays Israel
[31:44] could not get into action down there
[31:47] with signs and wonders until they fell
[31:49] on their face and prayed for a deliverer
[31:51] God had his deliverer God had a prophet
[31:54] hanging up in the wilderness kept him
[31:56] there for 4 years waiting for them to
[32:00] get right to pray but when they got
[32:03] right and start praying then God sent
[32:07] the deliverer God will do the same thing
[32:09] today if the people will just get
[32:11] together get to praying all right I'm
[32:15] closing 2 Thessalonians 3 1-3 Paul
[32:18] speaks finally Brethren pray for us that
[32:23] the word of the Lord may have free cuse
[32:26] and be glorious
[32:28] even as it is with you and that we may
[32:31] be delivered from
[32:33] unreasonable and wicked men for all men
[32:37] have not Fai but the Lord is faithful
[32:40] who shall establish you and keep you
[32:42] from evil big Apostle Paul saying pray
[32:46] pray for us and that we may be delivered
[32:49] from unreasonable and wicked
[32:52] men for all men have not Fai brother
[32:56] brandom as we close final
[32:58] quote he said I don't want Justice I
[33:01] don't want the Lord I want his Mercy he
[33:02] said oh Lord Don't Judge Me by no law
[33:05] I'll be condemned I can't stand I I I
[33:08] don't give don't give me Justice I I I
[33:11] ought to go to hell because I'm a sinner
[33:14] but Lord Give Me Your Mercy Your Love
[33:16] Your Grace God said this is my beloved
[33:19] Son here him not Moses not Justice not
[33:22] the law but he him he's got Mercy he's
[33:24] got gifts for you he has said on high
[33:28] he's quoting part of Ephesians 4 and
[33:30] give gifts to men and God did just
[33:32] exactly what he did with his son when he
[33:35] adopted him there now and otherwise
[33:37] don't hear me no more I'm God but I've
[33:40] adopted my son no man can come to the
[33:43] father but by my son he him oh my how
[33:47] God wants to take his church today and
[33:51] adopt it he gave it birth now he wants
[33:54] to adopt it but we just won't stand and
[33:57] still if it raises up among the
[33:59] methodists the Baptist will have nothing
[34:01] to do with it it raises up among One
[34:03] Church the other one have nothing to do
[34:05] with it it's a Twist and a twirl why a
[34:07] mixed multitude the same thing today and
[34:11] this is the last quote we have what we
[34:14] need
[34:15] today is a coming together and a prayer
[34:19] meeting and to stay there until God
[34:24] sends the adoption of the Holy Spirit
[34:28] brings the Holy Ghost down and places in
[34:32] the church Apostles prophets teachers
[34:38] evangelists pastors that is what we need
[34:42] now I know many ministers now think that
[34:44] they are place and that is the position
[34:46] and all of that they on drama that is
[34:49] not what the prophet taught what he
[34:51] thought when they born and positionally
[34:54] born then God sets in his church
[34:57] yeah he is saying we need a prayer
[35:00] meeting to stay there until God sends
[35:04] the adoption of the Holy Ghost brings
[35:07] the Holy Ghost down and places in the
[35:10] church these five offices and the Bible
[35:13] self teaches for God sets in the church
[35:16] not a man voted in not a man the people
[35:19] fig he's the best man to talk and preach
[35:21] and or whatever it is not that not
[35:23] somebody appoint a man or say he's the
[35:25] man no when go God sets God sets and God
[35:29] promises sets he said that is what the
[35:32] church needs it won't compromise it will
[35:34] stay with the word a church that won't
[35:36] flirt with the world a church that will
[35:38] have nothing to do with sin that will
[35:40] turn its back on sin that will walk in
[35:42] Holiness and beauty of God living for
[35:44] God live or die what different does it
[35:46] make as long I'm for God what different
[35:48] does it make let us bow our heads
[35:50] tonight heavenly father I thank you for
[35:53] this is what you lay upon my heart to
[35:54] share with your people father oh God
[35:56] that they will pray for us that they
[35:58] will pray for the ministry that they
[36:00] will pray that God would send down the
[36:01] holy ghost that pray that go would
[36:03] positionally place his sons that we
[36:05] could be channel of communications for
[36:07] inspiration to flow through father God
[36:10] it is getting to where that we say the
[36:12] tire hits the road and all those
[36:15] disrespectful and grumbling and bad
[36:18] attitude people in the church Lord that
[36:20] have fought the ministry for years they

[36:25] way you will work and father some of
[36:27] them Lord they bad talk they Grumble

[36:33] their children and their whole lives and
[36:36] they fail to recognize it father you
[36:39] demand respects for your servants God
[36:42] and the prophet taught us if we cannot
[36:45] respect the man respect the office that
[36:47] he holds father you put each one of us
[36:49] in different positions that you could
[36:51] use us For Your Glory it was not one
[36:53] nose or one eye or one mouth or or just
