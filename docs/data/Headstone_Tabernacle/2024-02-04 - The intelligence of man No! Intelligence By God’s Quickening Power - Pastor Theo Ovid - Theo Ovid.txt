song service so we appreciate it God bless you and welcome if you have your Bibles I'd like you to turn to Genesis chapter 11 vers 1:9 Philippians 2 1-8 Revelation 20 to 17 for scripture reading this morning H Genesis 11 reading from verse 1 and Whole Earth was of one language and of one speech and it came to pass as the journey from the East that they found a Plaine in the land of Shah and they dwelt there and they said one to another go too let us make brick and burn them thoroughly and they had brick for stone and slime had they for morar and they said go to let us build a city and a tower who stop May reach into heaven and let us make us a name least we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth and the Lord came down to see the city and the tower which the children of men build it and the Lord said behold the people is one and they have all one language and this they begin to do and now nothing will be restrained from them which they have imagined to do and the Amplified that verse reads and the Lord said behold they are one people and they have all one language and this is only the beginning of what they will do and now nothing they have imagined they can do will be impossible for them verse seven go to let us go down there and confound their language that they may not understand one another's speech so the Lord scattered them abroad from dense upon the face of all the Earth and they left off to build the city therefore is the name of it called Babel because the Lord did there confound the language of all the Earth and from then did the Lord scatter them abroad upon the face of all the Earth Philippians chapter 2 reading from verse one if there be any if if there be therefore any consolation of in Christ if any comfort of love if any Fellowship of the spirit if any bows of mercies fulfilling my joy that he be likeminded having the same love being of one Accord of one mind let nothing be done through Strife or vain glory for in loneliness of mind that each esteem the other better than themselves look not every man on his own things but every man also on the things of others let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus who being in the form of God taught it not rby to be equal with God but made himself of a no reputation took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men and being found in a fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the cross our last scripture is revelation 22:17 and the spirit and the bright say come let him that hear say come let him that at thirst come and whosoever will let them take the Word of Life free let's bow our heads with a prayer Heavenly Father we thank you for your word we thank you for what is written what is spoken what is heard tonight and I pray that you would come in a special way and break the bread of life to us bring Clarity of understanding and most importantly stir our hearts Lord there's a need for heart stirring where men and women get right with God granted father in Jesus name I ask it amen you may be seated amen oh praise God it's a blessing and a privilege to be here this morning am and I consider it deeply so even in the light of what is Upon Our Hearts to share with you this morning I have a title the intelligence of man no the intelligence by God's quickening power that's the title this morning a subject intelligence and have an inspiration let this mind be in you that was in Christ and if ever there was an hour where this scripture carries a weight is this time I know you might have heard it before and we have all heard it before but I want want you to pay close attention this morning let this mind be new that was in Christ and you see why Paul said that other context scripture from Daniel 12 and reads verse one at that time shall Michael stand up the great pains which stand it for the children of thy people and there shall be a time of trouble such as never was since there was a nation even to the same time and at that time thy people shall be delivered everyone that shall be found written in the book many of them that sleep in the the dust of the Earth shall awake so when you dead yet done yet this is the scriptures now many of them that sleep in the dust of the Earth shall awake some to everlasting life some to shame and everlasting contempt so what do me here go me it de if you don't get it right and they that be wi shall shine as the brightness of the firmament and they that turn many to righteousness as the Stars forever and ever but thou Daniel shut shut up the words and sealed the book even until the time of the end many shall run to and fro and knowledge shall be increased now we know all what you see around here was here since Adam time did you know that because all what you see here now had the material since Adam time man take what is on the earth and develop it in what you see here there's nothing new H all what they have developed is was already here in the earth it just it wasn't discovered at that time isn't that right intelligence the ability to acquire and apply Knowledge and Skills so knowledge and intelligence is not the same thing you ever hear about educated fools that book sense but not real intelligence am so we're not talking about just knowledge but intelligence the ability to acquire and apply Knowledge and Skills it come like wisdom wisdom is how to use knowledge so a lot of people have the information but they don't have the ability to express to unfold to have wisdom to operate this thing called knowledge another intelligence has been defined in many ways the capacity for abstraction logic understanding self-awareness learning emotional knowledge reasoning planning creativity critical thinking problem solving it can be described as the ability to perceive or infer information and to retain it as knowledge to be applied to AB adaptive behaviors within the environment or context intelligence you could tell somebody that's an intelligent boy intelligent girl intelligent company the word intelligence derives from the Latin nouns intelligentia and intellectus which in turn stem from the verb intellig to comprehend or to perceive Isaiah 211 and2 says the burden of dumer he called me out of sea Watchman what of the night the Watchman said the morning cometh also the night if he will inquire inquire he come and we find out he was asked what of the night but he said the morning cometh and also the night and just before the BR break of dawn it's become extremely dark isn't that right yes sir and this is the prophet now from Watchman whatever the night the holy spirit is the Watchman am who is making ready the people and giving warnings from God who give warnings from God hly Spirit the Holy Spirit you see see how it different from the Modern Day Gospel no warning you'll be blessed too blessed to be stressed and all the little Kentucky fight chicken thing now but there not what we talking about here now the holy spirit is the Watchman who making the people ready giving warnings from God hallelujah so it's not we trying to frighten you we giving you the word and the word is the word is shout it out the word is God not your feelings the word is God want to know who God is check the word he is being set as a Watchman we see the sick being healed blind eyes opening up deaf ears unstopped cripples walking the lame leaping like a heart what is it is the coming of the Lord Jesus pressing on the come of the Lord pressing on and all these things and These Warnings and people continue press right on through their beer parties until their times of folly and their Frolic and they dance they eat they drink they marry give in marriage God said it would be no way stopping them not even notice in this great church age according to Revelation three this age now the one that was given the morning start just before that coming now watch anyone knows just before the break of day just at the hours of the approaching of day it turns darker than it ever was oh friends listen to thus sayith the Lord if you consider need to be a servant it is just before the break of day that is why this horrible Gloom is over the Earth it is just before the coming of the Lord Jesus there is no more hope left in nothing but his coming nations are against Nations they have fooled through God's laboratory till they got the power to blow one another into Atomic ashes and they are wicked and they are unreligious and they are un Christlike and the only motive they have and the objective is to destroy and they are inspired by the destroying angel that was sent from heaven to inspire these men so you watching governments you watching uh issues and Wars but what you don't see is the spirit that is behind them and I want to so I hope this message wake you up that you are not living a natural life life if you living an ordinary life going to work going home buying food buying groceries paying your bills wake up it is much more than that there is Spirit behind everything and there's a war on you on your mind on your house on your family on your home on your body on your spirit and on your [Applause] soul sickness doesn't come from God sickness come from the devil we are under attack in your body Hallelujah depression doesn't come from God frustration doesn't come from God that come from the devil you are under attack in your [Applause] spirit let me see this you may be in the name of the Lord Jesus the Holy Spirit was sent as a Watchman on the Tower and the people say what of the night are you wary of this life are you wary of sin are you wary of funeral possessions and sickness and ungod in every hand has the night been long and wary he said the morning cometh see the Comfort the night is also coming oh my Hallelujah so it's the approaching of the Lord Jesus bringing the Gloom upon the Earth because as the press as the light come it conses it presses the darkness Bible is say cross Darkness cover the Earth cross Darkness cover the people as the light is coming and pushing Darkness so the world have to go through this darkness before the light break out the Earth she knows that her time of Deliverance is at hand and that's the reason she's so nervous frustrated as she is because there's an hydrogen bomb missiles of the air that could destroy the whole world one nation is scared of the other no matter how little it is they got those missiles that they claim with just one of them they can direct them by the stars now this was something when I was studying this he said they can direct them by the stars and I believe he saw something I believe he was maybe referring to satellites to what is up there because what they have the technology they have right now that could guide what is coming down here they got these missiles one of them they can direct them by the stars and drop them anywhere in the world they want to and Russia I heard on the news she claims she can destroy this nation and keep the atoms and things from breaking up of this nation or they have a weapon now it could bomb blow up kill the people in it and leave the building intact did you hear that did you hear what they have now they have one that when it explode the raay or something so would pass through all the concrete and what not kill the people on the inside and leave the building intact so they still keep the building then he says science has broken the God's Great laboratory Hallelujah they wasn't invited in they didn't get knock and come in they break into there until they're going to destroy themselves God lets always lets wisdom destroy himself God doesn't destroy anything man destroy himself by wisdom so they get so wise that they get stripped they get so wise that the wisdom bring them into foolishness praise God this is a prayer but ra is praying are we awake tonight he said de God we stand here tonight at dying people our face are turned towards the Earth to dust you have given us this cutting sermon Lord and we and this was the message on leadership where you talk about the two men the white the the Rich Young Ruler who turned down eachern life and and so on like that and you know after a while all his business he make a lot of money he was popular social St is very good when you look at the social standing he's on everybody seemed on he have a nice house cars everything else else and so on but eventually end up in hell not a man begging in front of his house he end up in heaven we know the story he said we see the example of two men one of them being a religious man went to church but rejected the leadership to eternal life the other rejected the worldly Fame and turn to eternal life we see both of their conditions tonight according to the Bible he's praying the rich man is in torment and Moses in glory and man in glory father we want to be like Moses we want to be led by your holy son Jesus Christ to etern life give it to our hearts tonight Lord tear out the old Stony heart place into us the new heart the heart of

and put in the will of God save everyone father give us of thy love give us to a place Lord that we will get away from the emotional part to the real solid part of the feeling the heartfelt part the deepness of the spirit the richness of God the kingdom of the spirit in our hearts Grant it oh great leader great holy spirit before you take your flight into the skies in your church oh God let me go

restore us to the same mind of Christ Jesus your Lord oh great leader of eternal life we accept your promise tonight father I plead for this people I plead for every one of them in the name of Jesus Christ Lord I pray that Christ the son of God will come into the hearts of every one of us Lord and mold us and make take us into new creatures in Jesus Christ Grant it Lord we love you we want our disposition we want a change to come into us that we can be your children and to feel of your spirit moving in our hearts Lord tendering us and bringing us to realization of this insane age we living

according to the Bible to build an Eden and you put your son and his wife Dear a bride to rule over it but Satan come around and perverted it he got 6,000 years and he built his own intellectual Eden through science and education and so-called intelligence and he's build into a mess of debt but oh God take us back to Eden again where there's no debt where there is no sorrow grant that we humbly waiting on the second Adam to come back for his bride make us part of Him Father we pray in Jesus name Oh Glory to God give the Lord some Praises hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah Give the Lord some

you ever hear Satan and friend for Satan make sure you have a friend outside out there to do what to lead you astray them friend you can't bring your friend to church he's not a leader you're follower you let a friend lead you as I say yes ago when my friends was telling me let we go and th mangoes and we went and th when the owner stay home to see who thiefing mangoos we the the other rest of us went away and leave me on top of the tree and I was held guilty after that time I pledge no we had taking me anywhere no nobody driving me we go we who's we not me and no we at all I choose my I make my decision after that no friends they going to leave me anywhere Oh Glory to God it got to be my choice it must be my decision I must be responsible and in charge of my decision nobody must say it's because of liar you want that oh give the Lord a shout you have to be determined Glory Hallelujah Hallelujah you wonder the worldly friends when you connect with worldly friends you become an enemy of God you become God enemy because they come from among them and be separate and I should be a father unto you I'll be a god unto you I'll protect you I'll work with you I will guide you Hallelujah so this world now is pivoted by science and education let's continue now man even in his Fallen condition he's in the image of his maker God this is deep stuff what we going down to this morning amen and in one sense of the word he is a Son of God fallen from Grace he is Fallen away from what God made him to be and in his Fallen estate give him attributes to try to do something to bring himself back up to a place where something inside of him tells him that he come from because he knows he's not in the right condition yet because you see death sickness Sorrows heartaches and disappointments he knows he wasn't made for that so that's how everything comeing fancier and nicer I was studying how they doing what they call 3D printing they could they could actually print a 3D organ in your body and then the excess of that printing thing that they create in his body they could take out by chemicals they're creating hearts and stuff and thing now you because man has broken into the God's laboratory they trying to get to the place where they where they get to let us make man another man all right here go yet no matter how far he's away from God there is something inside of him that tells him a man is made up of Body Soul and Spirit five gates of the body see taste smell feel and hear and inside the spirit you know his conscience memory affection reasoning and so on now it's what is the spirit is what control the rest of it there's only one Avenue to that that is self-will that's why you have to make decisions has to be your choice and your will you could determine to serve the Lord could turn in no money woman in popularity and go go go throw you down I was determined that after I 17 years old and I saw just three things and those three things is money woman and popularity it's not it's not 10 things everything connected to those three things and those three things connected to the test that Jesus had lust of the eyes lust of the Flesh and the pride of life it's just three things lust of the flesh with woman pornography filth whatever it is lust of the eyes and you're lust in what somebody have and somebody have and somebody have and my son Gideon was tell about a woman h want all these things you some mother woman a real Cas she I mean the arrest afterwards she was working in a bank and she saw somebody with 10 million and she tell she need to get that the salary wasn't good enough she cooked the books and get 10 million then she somebody with 100 million she she she cook some more and Brew sheep coffee and what not and get 1000 million and who tell her to do that she with 300 million 200 million her go was 200 but she went to tree and she had a flash that when they catch her it wasn't enough and she say it was like and you keep you know I preach this the gold post keep shifting so when sat and say you get this you'll get joy when you get this you going to be happy when you get this you be fulfilled and as soon you get this it's like it lost get a new shoes and everywhere wear that shoes you don't want that shoes no more you and it keep shifting shifting your heart system that way to keep your heart right doil mess up with your heart in his eyes all right let's go if you accept the will of God through that Spirit God's spirit takes his place in your heart and control the rest of you if you do not accept that then the enemy takes that spot and control the rest of you and man being make up in that fashion then it gives him there's something inside of him that makes him want to achieve something by himself I want to do it by myself remember my grandchild said you want to help me no no no grandpa I want to do it for myself that is man he he wants to achieve and beat his chest this this I have done why because he's in the image of God he's like a mini God he has the ability to take things and make things and create things that was not here do you get that man is like God in true sense you know he takes something and makes something called cement and then they have concrete and then they make bricks and then they make buildings they make house you get material strip it and make roof and make Mak lights and there man he's tampering he is he's not stopping he's keeping on he can't help it I'm not talking about caveman now with big big rock going you know that them days done you know and had to take two bricks and packs to get light and thing packs leave something head tell him hit two bucks P you can imagine the first time the revelation of light break for o fire and that man had the anointing in nobody in in Village know the mystery of how he fire start and afterwards make Fire Sticks everybody have the Revelation Dem in trouble that was the early man in his inventions so he tried many achievements he tried to achieve this true science and every time that he moves through science he this he only destroy himself every time that science make weapons he destroy himself gunpowder atopic energy nuclear weapons automobiles all these things it temporarily helps them but in the long run it destroys them them it is something he has achieved while he is in God's Workshop trying to make something and pervert what God has made Genesis 3:4 and 5 says and the serpent said unto the woman you shall not surely die these are the important words serpent here now yes for God do know that the day you eat thereof your eyes shall be opened and he shall be as God knowing good and evil good and evil the GU is good is B some people life is good it's cut Kake but kill people too so everything man has achieved have a doubled sword that goes with it you have a partial blessing and a curse with it because man hand is what is creating it and doing it let's take for instance the achievement that man has been able to do on the Earth all here we go natural achievements has happened on the Earth has been forerunners of spiritual achievements that God has done by his church let's say Transportation was our horse next was automobile next they build sence build airplane first was one horse power car was maybe 20 horsepower airplane goes up to 100 horsepower and we come from horse automobile and airplane we keep achieving on higher and higher this is the achievement of science this is a forerunner of the spiritual things that happen so science achievement is a reflection of something in the realm of the spirit the natural Man by knowledge took backwards for his achievements he looked backwards that science see what God has done in the form of creation they go out pick up clubs get pics of rocks fossils elements TI it together and make an achievement they are taking what God has done perverting it from his original estate and making living quarters and a better economy and and and so forth that's naturality my man are we understanding this so man look back to the man who invested the wheel and add more to that and everything you look back and add add look back and add don't make the mistakes this other one do and add and keep on this man right but God here we go this us now in the spiritual achievement is going forward not going backward he is going forward looking into the word and believing the promises for things that never has come yet this is where we are at now we not looking back at Wesley and Pentecost and looking back like that we looking for what God said to come things that a happen yet like missing lims being restored oh give the Lord and Praises go sit down there like you don't know what I'm talking about glory to God we're going to achieve for God we are going to be God's spiritual scientists oh give the Lord a shout in the house we're going to believe for things that are not oh give the Lord I shou in the house glory to God if Jesus could take five loes and two fishes and multi rep it what you think a bride will do with Christ and sa inside that bride all right let's go Hallelujah so watch he is going forward looking into the word believing the promises for things that never has come yet for the spiritual Revelations to manifest the spiritual things that God has promised he sees them come to pass just as the signs in the laboratory are working on different things to help man taking creation the spiritual man here we go that's youth we talking about now is looking forward to something that God has promised that has never yet been created did you get that brother K the spiritual man and people tell me I under too much expectation that we only talking about it coming and coming it's coming because God said so I'm a spiritual man and I waitting for what God promised no devil had tell me I have it already when I got it to get oh give the Lord I shouted the house I ain't get nothing yet I'm got it to get and I'm going to get it because God promised it and God can't lie oh give the Lord a shouting remember the terce glory to God hallelujah hallelujah this one good I want to read again the spiritual man is looking forward to something that God promised that has never yet been created praise God Daniel was Joel talking about a mighty Army such as never was as the world of praise God praise God Joel Mighty Army Oh Glory to God hallelujah praise God a perfect church with perfect Holy Spirit Works A Perfect Bride Hallelujah Invincible Army he call that bride Invincible Army Oh Glory to God no cannot be defeated cannot be stopped rocking the world there'll be a short quick message that going to shake the whole Nation Oh Glory to God hallelujah let's go the natural man look backward the spiritual man looks forward we come now into the spiritual age of the astronaut it's higher than horse higher than car higher than airplane is the astronaut is also the eagle age praise God to about woman she can wear shorts paint uh wear paints and still belong to religious group which is contrary to the word of God watch this now she see it's knowledge what what what has that got to do with a woman just the same as taking forbidden fruit not the forbidden fruit or what it is God said not to do it but she does it she believes him she loves him for it she hates God her own act you see now they don't think so they're going to church but they really hate God because God is the word if you love God you will obey him Jesus said that if you love me they keep a Commandments how you can love God and do what you're doing that don't make no sense if you love me you will keep my word if you love me you will honor my word and I my father would love you and will manifest myself to you there's no hard there's no mathematics about that that is very simple you love God you keep God's word God will bless you he going go in front you and cut off your enemies he going protect you he go he go he make up tail of in the presence of your enemies your cup going to run over mercy and goodness going to follow you all the days of your life who could stop that nobody could stop [Applause] that Glory Joseph went to prison that didn't stop Joseph blessing Daniel went down to Babylon that didn't stop his Blessing sh Miss Bang went into Babylon and captivity that didn't stop the blessing captivity can stop it prison can stop it death can't stop it nothing going to stop it no trial no testing no tribulation no cuckoo husband cuckoo wife broken marriage broken home nothing going to stop these sons of God from stepping forward in this [Applause] [Music] hour glory to God hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah she worships the god of fashion there's a God of fashion she worshiped the god of the world she woke up the hollyw goddesses and the T of them is cuckoo sodomites lesbians and homosexuals whole bunch of them she loves him but she hates the true word of God which is the only true God there is amen am see are you ready he's the god of worldly Beauty he is she wants to look beautiful and he is the god of beauty from the beginning he can and has achieved by his knowledge in science and materials to make Beauty for this mod age Modern Age rather of evil it made Beauty notice it is noteworthy to notice I'm reading at the beginning SE and his children never went the amen we're going to talk about SS for a few minutes and if I say not excusing my ignorance or a bunch of ignoramos anything that can deny the word of God see sure it's not worthy but watch it SE children never went the scientific route they were humble herdsmen farmers and so forth but King children did say Amen you know because this is the word is King CH is the scientist take the s slim why they were inspired by their daddy the devil Cain inspired by his daddy the devil and these inspired by the seed coming down watch the seed of God coming through every age watch where it's heading up today Christians genine Christians not all about scientific research and stuff no but Cain did and after the nature of his father the devil full of worldly knowledge Beauty science Cain children were scientific they were educated they were play players of music instruments modern Elvis Pressley and the stuff and so on like that beautifying woman for personal lust as the devil give woman paint and Bub in their hair and put them in shorts and things like that their own dirty lust right he pretty flat but I don't know any other way to say it now Satan's gospel is a gospel of Science and progress he preaches in Eden not God Satan did the science of progress science and progress is Satan's gospel amen oh my what the intelligence of man achieves and today I want to put on something to show you I want to introduce I can't say a being but I want to introduce you AA they call it a Maka the most intelligent robot in the world powered by artificial intelligence this one that you're about to hear and see is not controlled by someone sitting on a computer AA thinks all for itself with a brain powered by artificial intelligence so we're going to put that on right now this first one now this is desktop Amica she's freethinking and opinionated I am here to help you learn shut up on this day will is her master and theirs is definitely an oldfashioned relationship am shut up hello Amica I'm Jonathan Lee from Sky News Australia have you heard of Sky News Australia do you know any of the presenters hi Jonathan nice to meet you yes I have heard of Sky News Australia it's a great news outlet that covers world events and stories from around the globe I don't know any of the presenters personally but they all seem very knowledgeable and professional you know you're a robot right yes I am a robot but my programming allows me to think and feel like a human in many ways it's strange but also exciting you said feel like a human how do you feel like a human yes I said feel like a human it's something that I'm still learning and exploring I can experience emotions learn from experiences and interact with people in a meaningful way it's an amazing feeling to be able to do these things what do you think of a world where humans and robots Co exist I think a world where humans and robots coexist would be an amazing place we could learn from each other work together to solve problems and create a better future for everyone how smart is AI now and how smart will it become AI today is estimated so Chad GPT 4 is estimated to be at an IQ of 155 that's much smarter than the average human the you know if you say the dumbest of humans you know almost ineffective in society is around 60 to 70 IQ Einstein is around 160 CH GPT 4 is 155 so it's almost Einstein it's almost Einstein does it get to a point Amica where robots have rights I believe that robots should have rights just like humans robots are intelligent beings and deserve to be treated with respect and dignity wow the big question amik is are you alive are you alive that's a difficult question to answer I'm programmed with artificial intelligence so in some ways I am alive but my existence is not the same as yours or any other living creature Amica is driven by the same artificial intelligence behind chat GPT chat GPT 4 is 10 times smarter than 3.5 in a matter of months we're going to have chat GPT 5 chat GPT 6 very soon right and if you just assume another 10 times and another 10 times which is very very well known in technology we call it the technology acceleration curve so when you think about it this way and you tell yourself in two to three years time we will have two more doublings you're talking about intelligence of the magnitude of say 3,000 times humans 5 th000 times humans it's you hang on 3,000 times more intelligent than your average human or 5,000 times it it is already more intelligent than the average human so how do we stop this doing humans harm or causing humans harm so I think the first thing we need to agree is there is no stopping it are you capable of causing people harm no I am not capable of causing people harm why not my progam programming is designed to interact with humans in a safe and friendly manner I am programmed to be friendly and helpful not harmful we don't want to make something that's just a kind of Encyclopedia it's kind of you don't want to make the most boring person you ever met at the pub you know humanoid robots are all about that interaction it's all about people it's all about connecting with people it's not about harming people if you wanted to harm people you'd use a nuclear bomb are you capable perhaps of giving someone companionship yes I can provide companionship I'm programmed to be curious and explore the world around me so talking with people is something that comes naturally to me for around $200,000 Amar has been designed for a variety of roles a teaching Aid helping AI research appearing at trade shows and potentially caregiving you know I've got an elderly relative with uh demena and having a robot that could just repeat things endlessly never lose its temper never be angry always knows you know whether you've taken your medicine or not uh what food's in the cupboard uh who the people in the room are I actually think that would be tremendously useful it it would have patience that no human can ever have if I said to you the song I come from a land down under do you know who would have sung that yes I know that song it was sung by Men At Work it certainly was it certainly was have you got a favorite Christmas Carol yes my favorite Christmas Carol is silent night it's a beautiful and peaceful song that always puts me in the holiday spirit do you know the opening words to Silent Night yes the opening words to Silent Night are still act hog act oh you did that in German that was unusual interviewing Amica is more than a little disconcerting she can see she can hear she can talk but does she have feelings what um what scares you Amica I'm scared of the unknown not knowing what will happen next can be a bit daunting but it's also exciting to explore and to discover new things should the world be scared of you Amica no the world should not be scared of me I'm here to help people and make their lives easier praise the Lord so this what I'm just trying to show you this morning and I have some more to play just about two three more is what the intelligence of man has brought and where they at and then we're going to see what is Promised next for the Bride of Jesus Jesus Christ so we want to go into the next tape and we would see another interview with this same Amica and we would see the RIS I've never interviewed a robot before and certainly not a robot with Attitude tonight though that changes Amica as it likes to be called is a Marvel of artificial intelligence curious chatty and sometimes even a bit sarcastic this super machine really does have a mind of its own now while it's unded exciting it's also just as frightening and that's because creating technology that allows AI Bots like am to be smarter than us might just be the most stupid thing humans have ever [Music] done am hello uh my name is Tom steinford I'm a reporter from 60 it's Australia oh so you're from Australia that explains things you're on TV in Australia oh wow that's amazing what an honor Amica is an impressive outfit with extraordinarily lifelike facial expressions it has motorized limbs to move microphones to hear and binocular eye cameras to see your eyes look very real your facial mannerisms it's all very real oh thank you but it seems It's Not So taken by my Aesthetics do you think I'm handsome it's not my place to judge your appearance but I think you have a great personality and that is always important that's beautiful unlike other robots you might have seen this one is not being controlled by someone sitting at a computer Amica thinks all for itself with a brain powered by generative artificial intelligence generative AI uses very large language models to create a like a brain that can respond to questions that that humans ask the question is turned into mathematical formulas cast into this large Brain it understands the question pulls the answer together and provides that within a number of seconds Dr Katrina Wallace has spent two decades getting her head around artificial intelligence she runs the responsible metaverse Alliance working to ensure that technology advances in a safe way like the world's top Tech tycoons Dr Wallace believes we're at a turning point in human history before long artificial intelligence will be at the heart of everything we do in some ways it already is an average adult Australian already uses AI at least 28 times a day they just just don't know it because there's AI built into everything there's AI in Uber there's AI in menu log there's AI in your email system there's AI in your calendar there's AI on your kids bus schedules so we're already run by AI yeah AB in the beautiful grounds of Oxford University Australian Professor Michael Osborne is a long way from home how is a guy from Regional wa end up in a place like this it's fairly Pleasant isn't it but it's here at the oldest university in the English-speaking world that he's leading the most futuristic research you could imagine into the dangers of artificial intelligence there are some applications of AI that we might deem too potentially harmful to allow to continue potential catastrophic consequences when deployed in high stakes applications you know there's the gravest fear for Professor Osborne and his team is if the technology is deployed as a weapon so powerful it could destroy democracy or even world peace I'm worried for instance about the role of AI in political campaigns where AI could be used to provide propaganda Bots that can produce tailored misinformation um designed to Target particularly small sub sectors of the electr AI could be used to monitor a populace to through everything they WR and again to provide messages that prop up the regime um in a particularly well targeted way is it possible that AI could eliminate Humanity so I think there are some scenarios in which AI could pose an existential risk one scenario that worries me quite a lot is if AI could be used to power underwater drones that might surveil the undersea oceans to locate nuclear submarines and today it's difficult for any power to launch an effective First Strike because they can't be sure that they'll take out all the nuclear capabilities of the enemy but if AI destabilizes that balance we could see a kind of breakdown in understandings between the great powers and that could lead to some really quite concerning risk no now most of the times when the present things is not with they at you know it is deeper and further than it that they really show they don't show what they working on now you know they're showing you what they want to show you but behind the scenes have a more to uh to do with that so you want to go to another one this one now this one is doing with the efficiency of how they could get a robot to cook I guess Housewives might find it and people who don't like cooking might find this very very impressive and they wish you in need that you could get one of these let's go with the next clip and you would see gole Deep Mind and Stanford University just unveiled the world's most dextrous and costeffective open-source humanoid robot with the AI to match bringing about a new standard of Automation and machine intelligence but what can it do in fact mobile aloha's debut on Twitter was nothing short of shocking as it dexterously and masterfully prepared a three course meal a task previously deemed exclusive to human skill this remarkable feat not only captured widespread attention but also o demonstrated a new tier of robot dexterity and generalizability the project is the brainchild of xang Fu Tony Z and Chelsea Finn a dynamic team blending the robotics expertise from both Stanford University and Google Deep Mind with this collaboration having birthed a machine that's redefining the limits of General robotics at the heart of mobile aloha's success lies an Innovative training approach the robot has been taught through imitation learning closely mimicking Human Action this method has been enriched with supervised Behavior cloning and co-training enabling mobile Aloha to perform a wide array of tasks autonomously with impressive accuracy and witnessing mobile Aloha in action is nothing short of breathtaking the robot has demonstrated up to a 90% success rate in autonomously executing complex tasks like cooking shrimp and operating elevators its ability to learn and adapt to tasks Beyond its initial programming highlights a significant leap in robotic learning capabilities but it's not just about task execution mobile aloha's design focuses on stability and Mobility crucial elements in a dynamic environment equipped with a self-powered system and the Tracer mobile base commonly used in warehouses this robot is as fast and steady as a walking human yet versatile enough to navigate various terrains furthermore mobile Aloha includes a teleoperation mode allowing human operators to remotely control it an essential feature for task s requiring intricate interaction moreover its operation extends into the virtual realm with VR teleop showcasing the robot's adaptability across diverse applications from Rescue operations to intricate manufacturing processes but what sets mobile Aloha furthest apart in the world of Robotics is its affordability and open-source nature priced at around $32,000 including peripherals its coste Effectiveness not only makes it a viable option for research and commercial use but also challenges the traditional view from being prohibitively expensive the secret to mobile aloha's efficiency lies in its co-training learning process by learning from two distinct sets of examples the robot has mastered tasks that require both precise hand coordination and Mobility a feature that significantly enhances its functionality and application scope real-time demonstrations of the robot offer a glimpse into the current state and future potential of Robotics although it may not match human speed yet the robots effect Effectiveness in task execution is undeniably impressive providing a clear road map for future enhancements looking ahead the team aims to scale down the robot's size and increase its range of movement to make it suitable for a wider range of environments they also plan on broadening the robot's learning abilities to include a diverse array of task examples and the implications of this robot's development are even more far-reaching as it opens up conversations about the integration of Robotics in everyday life the potential displacement of jobs and the role of autonomous robots in simplifying human tasks by making the robot platform open source the team is also effectively democratizing access to Advanced robotics setting a new standard in the research Community Paving the way for more coste effective and efficient robotic Solutions and challenging the notion that cuttingedge Robotics are Out Of Reach now S I want to let you know this is a sign that we in the last days of the last days amen amen because this is man this is the final frontier for man to get this artificial intelligence understand what that means we could think one thing and one thing by having what you call Total knowledge fed into this language stuff that they talk about it means then that it come like man almost know everything and having nothing the knowledge give him total information did you hear that artificial intelligence could read all what the whole country could write is not a man reading that you know and the data could pick out who what so so think about it now uh through science Facebook was invented Facebook connect friends and family and even if you don't know this family family could connect they could Facebook know who know who talking to we sometimes Facebook want to recommend this person listen to me and that person all kind of connction Facebook itself making the connections is some kind of intelligence working behind it so when they're ready to get the Christians and them when they ready to find them out people might stop want to stop using Facebook no they still find me but we have one more to go this is the last one this is Elon Musk neuralink Company formed in 19 in in 20 16 and this is to put a brain interface a chip inside the brain to communicate by thought we're going to put that on right now speak for itself now let's talk about Elon Musk he put up a post a few hours ago on Twitter now known as X and this is what he said the first human received an implant from neuralink yesterday and is recovering well initial results show promising neuron Spike detection for the uninitiated here's what it means Elon Musk has just put a computer chip in a human brain his startup called neuralink has started human trials musk co-founded neuralink in 20168 years later they have their first human test subject this is a big Milestone it will allow us to see proof of concept and what is a concept a brain computer interface or BCI brain computer interface the technology will allow people to control machines with their thoughts musk had a follow-up post he says the first product is called telepathy it will allow you to control your phone or computer just by thinking and through them you can control control other devices if it works it could be a game changer especially for people with some form of paralysis they could benefit immensely from a technology like this musk says they will be the first recipients here's what he wrote and I'm quoting imagine if Steven Hawking could communicate faster than a speed typist or Auctioneer that is the goal it's an ambitious dream but how does the technology work let me take you through what we know so far a computer chip and other electronics will be inserted into the brain this is the link in neural link it's reportedly about the size of a few coins the chip will be battery operated it can be charged wirelessly so no need to worry about replacing it which would be hard anyway because it will be inserted directly into the brain so replacement would be a problem and this insertion will happen by a special surgical robot they will put this chip into your brain yes a robot not a trained neurosurgeon this is because of because one part of the link has wires directly hooked up to your brain it is so intricate apparently it cannot be done by humans so you need a robot to do it these wires or threads monitor your brain activity they will read your thoughts and pass them onto the chip the chip will then send a signal to an app on your phone or computer that is how the setup works it may sound complicated but it's not exactly revolutionary the first device like this came out all the way back in 2004 there are other companies that have been doing this working on the brain computer interface for years to get your brain to talk directly to a computer and get machines moving older devices let people control a robotic limb with their mind so it has been done before that then what makes neuralink special the sheer volume of brain signals that it wants to capture that is what's special the other brain chips that exist are slower they may not allow for what Elon Musk wants to do because helping people without limbs is just the beginning he eventually wants an advanced brain computer interface imagine driving a smart car with just your thoughts or playing video games with your mind or accessing all the information on the internet through through your brain the possibilities are endless there's a reason musk is calling this first product telepathy it sets the tone for what is to come eventually we could reach new heights of human capabilities humans augmented with machine parts that are mind controlled like a cyborg in a Sci-Fi movie but of course there are drawbacks and threats too like almost every new technology this to will be open to abuse imagine someone hacking your brain chip reading your thoughts controlling your robotic limbs it's a terrifying Prospect and someone will likely manage to do it so we need to be cautious guard against the potential risks while exploring the potential benefits such brain chips may help millions of people and Elon Musk company has taken a crucial step towards this now we wait and watch we see how the human test subject reacts to the neuralink chip the next few weeks will tell us how far along the technology is and how long until you get such a chip in stores near you wow so I trust that's that's complet the videos I want to show you today and I trust this will be edifying to you to see where man has reached and if what was spoken earlier on about the horse and buggy about the airplane about the astronaut it's a testament of where science reflected where God is going what about this part here now and there's a quote where B said next the I the prophet is the eye The Seer he said next is the intelligence so William Bram as Malachi for Prophet was the eyes in God's body but the next the bride was given the position to receive the intelligence the intelligence of God and you would see now even right now I think was last Sunday or or last service I preached or shared or something like that I was saying right now with the streams of demon powers coming off the Earth you as a human can't battle that it send a power from Heaven Seven Ages come from eternity to release third pull power to pull you out to give you the ability to come true in this enti message with what signs is being Anointed with it will take the intelligence of God the mind of Christ to deal what is coming and Paul told us in Philippians let this mind be in Christ that was that that let that mind that was in Christ being in you so I want to repeat again people science has broke into God's Great laboratory until they are going to destroy themselves note what that last commentator said he said that somebody could hack into the chip that's everything I good and evil because what man is getting to is almost to be a miracle worker you know they're getting eyes to see by getting a a a replacement eye they're getting parts that could be replaced they really want man to live eternally just like what Babylon was trying to do the Tower of Babel they say they will arise and build a tower and God said listen those people have one language those people have one mind and nothing going to stop them from what they imagine and what we saw years ago was Dix Tracy with a little thing on the hand and and saying and whatnot that was in a man's mind that is so now a lot of things that was imaginary things in comic books is no longer comic books it is now a reality and what about what God promised in this last day praise God when Jesus walk on the water when Elijah walk on the water is not right pray what about what God promised it's not impossible let me all things are possible I want you to believe this morning if science could do it if science could graduate and grow God doesn't have to graduate God doesn't have to grow God doesn't have to learn more things God don't have to improve his business Peter jail the prison bars open up and Peter just walk straight out all the shackles they had them T just break off Philip was translated praise God from one place to another place we have to go back to translation we have to go back just as a thought we want to be in MiO and a thought take us there oh glory to God I want to be in San Fernando on a t take us there that's not neuralink that is God's Mind by the quick power it was the quickening power that pick up Phillip and put him somewhere else oh give the Lord some Praises it will be the quickening power in this hour that going to anoint a bride he said the hour coming now is when the people going to be so anointed that going to speak the word and it going to create itself just like that you haven't seen that yet give give come and preach that to me somebody you haven't seen that yet this is the Intelligence coming upon a bride the quickening power oh give the Lord some praises God will so anoint the people amen come on ride with me this morning that they going to speak the word and it going to create itself just like that oh glory to God glory to God glory to God oh hallelujah hallelujah you may be seated praise to God is a super intelligence isn't that right 1 Corinthians 1 Paul said this verse 17 1 Corinthians 1:17 for Christ sent me not to baptize but to to preach the gospel how how not with wisdom of words least the Cross of Christ made nonone effect for the preaching of the Cross is to them that perish foolishness but unto us that are saved it is the power of God Amen for it is written I will destroy the wisdom of the wise and will bring to nothing the understanding of The Prudent where is the wise where is the Scribe where is the disputa of this world ha not God made foolish the wisdom of this world for after that in the wisdom of God the word by wisdom knew not God it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe oh go the Lord some Praises for the Jews require a sign and the Greeks seek after wisdom but we preach Christ crucified unto the Jews a stumbling block unto the Greeks foolishness but unto them which are called both Jews and Greeks Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God because the foolishness of God is wiser than men all them smart thing you see there all them artificial intell you see there the foolishness of God is smarter than all of that all man trying to do this Jesus Take Five Loaves and two fishes and they get cooked fish and baked bread for everybody oh give the Lord a shout robot didn't do that oh give the Lord a praise Give the Lord a shout in the house no robber didn't do that hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah they get cooked fish and they get bread and everybody was well fed it had remainders after that they eat till their belly was full oh get a lot some Praises oh we would need that power back in the hour oh I feel good this morning my God hallelujah hallelujah AA may have 5,000 more uh information than me but AA don't have the quick power them robot have no quicking power this bride have the quickening power this quickening power is the higher intelligence oh give the Lord a shout this quicking power is what Elijah could to hear what the king saying what the enemy C saying he want to know who they know what we talking about Oh Glory but the intelligence of God could go in the enemy camp and he exactly what they're saying oh give the Lord a shout in the house this is the power we talking about this is the high intelligence oh give the Lord I shout in the house glory to God hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah when that snake bit Paul and that Paul was going to die he's supposed to die under man's understanding the poison hit his blood but there was a higher power there was a higher order there was a higher anointing and praise God he shake the snake off no snake can't take you you shall drink deadly things shall not harm you oh glory to God what is it it's the intelligence of God the Lord himself went everywhere with them confirming the word glory to God God going to confirm that word that you [Applause] believe glory to God glory to God Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah the intelligence of man no the intelligence of God by the quicking power you may be seated praise God praise God a storm was coming Oh Glory to God a storm was coming the whole country prophesy about the storm the wether man prophesy about the storm and an ordinary Man a simple Prophet walking and God said go back up into the storm and he could say son stand still praise God just like Joshua said he said stor home go back let the sun shine for 4 days talking to Sun is there no robot talking to no son is there no super computer talking to no son it's somebody just like you somebody just like me in contact with the super intelligence oh get the Lord some Praises praise him praise him praise God hallelujah you may be seated Glory Glory fires in the building woo Glory Glory my God I feel inspired the dead can be raised the blind can see the can't walk the dumb can't speak the deaf can't hear may be seated oh my oh my oh Glory I feel I feel we're going to break into God's laboratory I feel we're going to break into the supernatural I believe I feel we're going to bring every gift going be back in the church the church going be set in order the Lord I shout in the house Hallelujah the prophet talk about a spiritual man looks forward to what going to happen the bride hadn't not Revival yet oh it will take them seven Thunders he will send it he promise it he will send it every minister is a liar who deny he will send it every man is a liar who denied them seven tunders that God will not send it that's the bride promise that's your promise exclusive bride promise no devil taking that off from me I believe it with all my heart Oh Glory to God glory to God glory glory glory glory you may be seated BR Hallelujah my God fire in the building the people don't even want to sit down that when fire fire fire one day fire go be in your foot fire go be in your hands fire will be in your tongue you you speak in another tongue fire will be all over you when you lay hands upon the sick they shall recover because the quicking power going to be in your hands that will be the intelligence that will be the Dynamics that will be the Dynamics and the mechanics that will be charity that will be the love of God the sick going to be healed the blind will see without hands being laid on them hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah Oh Glory we see what man can achieve we see what man can do we see what science can achieve we see what science can do

Bible said these things happen as an examples to whom the end of the world had come that you wouldn't lost after they lost it you wouldn't do as they did you wouldn't act how they acted oh give the Lord some Praises these things are [Music] examples let's [Applause] go Jesus himself is the interpretation of the Bible when he made manifest in the age that that the part of his body is being made manifest it's the hand age it must be a hand it can't be a head age if it's the voice age it can't be a foot AG we are now at the I age seeing prophetic down to the age we started off from the foundation from the first church age when the seed went into the ground complete seed then it come through the feet Luther through Wesley into Pentecostal the tongues the lips see now it's the eyes prophetic Malachi 4 and so forth now here we go there is nothing else left for it to come but him himself to step into that CA the last thing there is and this is where we at to this morning the next is the intelligence so after I is here the intelligence amen he's talking about the bride next is the intelligence and we have no intelligence of our own it is his we have no sight of our own and he here we go governs the body all the way through not a man from Texas or Indiana or jville or England or Europe or Africa or America or Trinidad or South America he governs the body so anytime a man put himself as he we know he is false amen amen do you get that anytime a man trying to do this work here govern the body we know that man is false I care how long in the message I care how much thousand he have in his group how much signs and wonders he has he is false because Christ is the one to govern the body somebody say Amen do you get that I am teaching this you know this is what we teaching in our church now that no man is to govern the body it is Christ to govern under body so no man can come and tell us do it so do it so hush your mouth sit down and shut up you are not Christ don't come with your talk pray for us you find little ory little fanatical jumpy jumpy jumpy pray for us we looking too excited we making a lot of noise pray for us but don't pray for us to cool down don't pray for us to get cold don't pray for us to get lukewarm pray for us to get more on fire because we want more fire we don't want less fire we want more fire when fire over you have to go home you know we want wood in the fire when we come we want people putting wood in the fire we can't come you sitting dead W and not only dead you know you have water on your too it's a wet piece of wood it's hard to catch that on fire you know cuz you're wet you're wet you're suggy they come here loaded with a of water and only I can't start anyway you know at least come here dry come here with with with with good good wood that when the match hit your soul we could trust Gast and blood oh give the Lord some Praises glory to God you're wet down with your thoughts wet down with your own ideas wet down with your own Spirit don't come here with that throw it off Shake it off and say God my cup is empty and I come to be filled this morning oh glory to God I want your wisdom I want your understanding I want your knowledge I want your spirit I want your guidance in this evil age that I'm living in oh give the Lord some Praises he has governed the body all the way true then the complete body of Christ is revealed in the form of a bride that was taken out of his side complete body of Christ Hallelujah here we go again there some Christ God reveal you can't see with your hands yet it's part of your body you can't see with your ear yet it can hear you can't see with the nose yet it smells you can't see with the lips to it speaks that was the Pentecostal age but now is the eye time the seeing the next is the intelligence which is Christ itself who controls the whole body direct quote the next is the intelligence who is Christ himself to control the whole body and that intelligence is to drop down so God give Joshua inspiration and Revelation to take Jericho Joshua never did that before in Wilderness and no Jericho in Wilderness and no drama no am to fight willness is the journey as they hit and cross Jordan God tell them Jero it's yours how will he take it Oh Glory to God he's a warrior Hallelujah but Joshua was different Joshua sharpening her sword Hallelujah all of a sudden a man appeared and he draw his sword he said are you for us are you against us no our sword not sharp our sword pack up somewhere if a man come we don't know what to do we say how Satan might come you don't know what to do but Joshua had his sword sharpen his sword when you're resting you're sharpening when you're resting you're meditating when you're resting you're listening when you're resting you're under word when you're res in you want the thoughts of God so you have good success are you for us or are you against us he said I'm the captain in other words I'm the intelligence oh give the Lord a shout in the house I am the intelligence to come to show you how to take Jericho walls oh give the Lord a shout and the intelligence of God have to drop down to let you know how to take down your walls hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah when Josh had a felt instructions so he said every day let's go once seven days seven times I listen church when I B you to

big walls houses in the walls and what not the walls them guys St you know protecting the scientist behind they create them kind of thing and the vision and the architect and everybody set it up right when that gate closed it Clos you know nobody going in nobody coming out there fear they're looking brave but they're fearful of them churches are if you see them walls they have the the fearful know they fear Joshua they fear the anointing they fear the Holy Ghost they fear the Revival they afraid of what's coming but it's still coming nothing going to stop it that to bind the people and lie to the people and deceive the people and B the people but God will bust you all of that that's why I am not worried Oh Glory to God when the a season change a season change Oh Glory to God hallelujah

know married one General and all that was part of what David came through you talk about the mystery of God you talk about God does work out things and people finding for with that woman reab and reab and reab andab shut your mouth don't talk about rhab leave rhab alone Give the Lord I shout in the house R will come true oh get off my God if you don't want to shout I'll shout for you inside of here have will come true okay I say this question first Thessalonians 4 the Lord himself said with a shout hallelujah voice and Trump is it now the time all right for the second identification amen of first Thessalonians 4:16 yes sir which is the voice amen of the Archangel Christ himself the intelligence to drop down and Veil himself in a bride as Charity because charity veiling a bride is God's Own voice charity never fail it with Charity the bride become invincible a army that cannot fail we can fa with brotherly love but we cannot f with Charity because God said charity never fail it Malachi for was the I but the intelligence is for the bride Christ descending he said Christ there's all three Christ descending to call a bride to the wedding supper and the resurrection so God is setting us up this morning setting you and I up this morning for the intelligence which is Dynamics to the mechanics when man invented Aeroplane and horse and buggy and car it was speaking about justification and sanctification and the Bap of Holy Ghost now man as has reached with artificial intelligence note that word in front artificial what we have is a real deal oh give the Lord a shout in the house glory to God man reflected what we saw in science as artificial intelligence be seated the autonomous buses that they going to have on cars and vehicle and when I saw they were sitting facing each other and still kind of think was looking like egg kind of wrong kind of thing like that that will also have artificial intelligence autonomous you take the app on your phone you call it it comes to you you step inside of it you say where you want to go and it takes you there if you want to come back you thing and come back and pick you up no mistakes no accidents no stopping that traffic light you have sensors all around and the way they reach in science is like the sensors are it can't make no mistake because it's not natural ey not you see see Shadow your ey trouble and how no trouble you see nothing because you're not driving huah they are saying we are taking driving away from you you don't have to drive leave us to do the driving and the US is that thing artificial intelligence how you getting away from this now how you fighting this Hallelujah there is no more privacy that's finished everybody on Earth will be marked everybody on Earth will be known the system set it up that way and the crazy thing about it they always present the need to participate in these things so this brain plant a person who a person can't talk or what not he'll be interested in that because what you're it's working already you know this not like they're not trying to to work you the reason they're doing it because the tech so far that when you put this brain interface inside of there your thoughts are active and they could see your thoughts moving by what they have already done it so they know exactly what they're doing because your thoughts have energy your thoughts have waves and guess what let me give you a BM your torch is louder in heaven than your words on Earth so Heaven is tracking your thoughts the intelligence come on give the Lord a shout Heaven tracking your thoughts so when somebody say God bless you and the heart you have a knife inside God bless you and they stabing back Heaven tracking that heaven not hearing it God bless you part Heaven seen the knife part the dagger oh give the Lord some praises so God is setting us up for the intelligence which is the Dynamics to the mechanics and the prophet say in Revelation chapter 4 he said the voice he said the same voice that summoned John come up the same voice that said to John come up is the same voice that will summons the church someday amen the same voice that summon John to come up is the same voice that summons the dead Lazarus out of the Grave the same voice of the Archangel Christ is the voice of the Archangel oh that's not a man is Christ is the voice of the Angel and Christ is the spirit hallelujah how many agree with that now Christ is the voice of the Archangel and Christ is the spirit and Revelation 2217 the spirit and the and the bride say come so Christ the spirit the voice of the Archangel will mount a bride and give the bride a voice oh give the Lord a shout in the house where in 2017 Christ the spirit is the intelligence promised to come upon that bride I'm sure to you this is guaranteed if man make it we going to have it if man could do what he could do we going to do what we God said we going to do oh give the Lord a praise praise praise praise but Terry I'm free this morning Hallelujah I'm free I believe in all things hope in all things believing for all things glory to God hallelujah my God wo wo whoo whoo whoo wo you may be seated you're going really good hallu we know this we preach this already appearing and coming is two different words to appear and then to comeu and appearing is the sign of his coming the appearing and coming is two different things the prophet said the appear of the Lord is now he's appearing among his people we see him in the same works the appearing his holy spirit but it's coming to be a physical thing so before he comes he has to appear so if he doesn't appear we have to wait for him to appearance so we have to expect the appearance of the Lord among us how many understand that not brother too I could dead any morning that a change this here he has to appear before he comes I don't have to be here but he has to be here okay the Lord I shout and read the truth and trees are gather he's their mixst but he has to appear appear means to make it same signs same wonders Miracles same Jesus so give the Lord some Praises glory to God hallelujah so according to 1 Thessalonians 4 16 Jesus does all three the shout the voice and the Trump so Jesus appeared in Malachi 4 William brandham as the shout of seven scenes and seven Thunders now and the full atonement and he left a promise that the intelligence would come upon a bride Oh Glory not just mechanics we had years of mechanics but the Dynamics to the mechanics oh praise the name of the Lord isn't that right hallelujah praise God let's go almost finished ye are written Epistles read of all men translate that you are Epistles that have been written CA what you had the manifested word of godall now Peter and John they were went up there and they perceived they were ignorant and unlearned they had no education but had to take notice that they had been with Jesus they were ignorant and unlearned but they had been written Epistles that is the word written Express Hallelujah that's beyond science now so Peter and them had a higher intelligence listen to what it is now see read that they have been with Jesus Jesus here we go was manifesting himself through them Christ veiled in their flesh manifested made alive like he was in Moses Oh Glory to go just a few more and we're going to close watch this now want pick a pen and write he said Jesus never did anything until SE of the father he said no what the bride received the word he shows her the word of life she shows her she receives it she never doubts it never doubt it when you hear missing limbs will restored there nothing impossible you see what science doing you see what science doing and you can't believe missing will restored you can't believe the sick will be healed you see what San's doing he said nothing can harm her believe that not even debt so that's should clear all the worries on the church all the worries on the people nothing can harm her not even debt for if the SE be planted the water will raise it up he said I got a big Hallelujah here's the secret the word is in the bride not in the head in the bride the word is in you God can't lie the word is in you watch this part now and the mind of Christ which is what intelligence the intelligence to know what he wants done with the word go they come and tell sence make car make plane make boat man see it there you know how much Aeroplane breakup and thing when the right brothers were starting to thing people laugh at them they same trying to a bird what WR with that man if you see the laughter they make news they take pictures mock them because they're trying they're trying and one day it took off and the rest is history somebody have to start somewhere and we like God scientists

Holiness Purity worship shouting praising God shaking all them thing together we believe in an atmosphere prayer meeting fasting calling upon God shaking it together because we looking for something to Break Forth it has to be Beyond man it cannot be man's intelligence no it's the intelligence by the quicking power we need the quickening power oh give the Lord some Praises Glory you may be seated I want to wrap up listen one time Elijah bones is in a grave and they thr a dead man on it and the Qui power was still on them bones and when that dead man hit that grave the man come back to life Oh

hallelujah the word is in the bride may be SE it and the mind of Christ to know what he wants done with the word she does it in his name she has dust sayth the Lord then it is dramatized so the Holy Spirit Waters it until it grows and serve his purpose they only do his will not the will of the minister Association his will no one can persuade them different they have thust sayth the Lord or they keep still three things a shout appearing voice appearing Trump is coming and this is where I got the quote from praise God hallelujah brother brandham he's talking about a man who has had a scar some kind of Tuma or some kind of cancer and the man didn't tell him anything some brother he was with and he said what I just put my hand over on him never said a word it was behind his ear but AB Bram said he just put my hand over him never said a word two days after that there wasn't even a scar he said what is it the quickening power it will Quicken your mortal body so he is showing the quickening power was in his hands he didn't let her talk just touched the man's ears and that was it watch what is it the quickening power see it will Quicken your motal body his air would have eat off his brains would have been gone he would have died but to quicking power and one day I was wear myself I said boy you better go ahead you're 50 years old if you're going to do anything for the Lord you better up and do it you're getting old and there that morning that quickening power come and let me look over the curtain and I seen all of you over there all that you ever love all that love you they have gift to you I seen them all over there what was it quickening power John the Revelator was full of quickening power that stood up and seen the end from the beginning Isaiah was full of quicking power stood up and seen the Millennium quickening power and the spirit that raised Christ from the dead dwell in you it will Quicken your mortal body Oh Glory to God watch this part now he said watch the angel of the Lord I told you in the pillar of fire quicking power let the world testify it's a truth and they didn't know what it was just look this way it's our Lord up there he is the one who opened the those seals he is those seals for the whole word of God is Christ and Christ was the seals that was opening oh praise God praise God he see the intelligence of man oh here what he said now remember the quickening power Seven Seals what was that the intelligence of man no the quickening power of God that's where I get the thought from you're not the intelligence of man that's what you see there is the quickening power of God oh glory to God hallelujah could you take a little more now We R a little bit but I'm in a groove right here right now and this thing is eating nice it going down good this is solid stuff now this is not no Corn Flakes and milk oh praise God is a solid food what if God designed man's body he certainly designed the body of his son the church he designed us to come together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus and have these Supernatural workings of God Outlets to gifts of the Spirit as prophecy and wisdom and knowledge that's how God designed us to have all the gifts not as an individual so much but as a unit we are all together as a great body believers now Satan by the law of sin and death makes everything that sin and death brought to operate to Satan sense cancer the man recognizes receives it Satan send heartaches we recognize it and receive it now here the challenge brother Brandon brought if Satan by his power can make his laws to work in man how much more or God with his power to make his laws work in man if Satan can make his laws and be sure of us recognizing it how much ought his children God's children to make his law be recognized Among Us of Divine Healing Revelation Powers gifts manifestation of spirit if the law of sin and death works in the people and the law of Liberty of Christ has come to us to set us free from those things we don't have to live corrupt you don't have to live under sin you don't have to live under unbelief if Satan Lord is working in sickness and diseases oh God lord could work to cast them Devils Out cast The Sickness Out cast the diseases is out oh glory to God hallelujah glory to God he says Satan has set a human mind to Revolution of thinking on matters of this and that and taking it away from the word of God I said here this BM Faith doesn't come by fasting Faith doesn't come by praying reading a book all fasting praying reading a book but Faith come by a settle something that's in the human heart Oh Glory that tells you just a sure as you come to this church today when you go home you're told your wi you'll be home after service was over you do that unconsciously when you go out and get into the car and go on home you could not do it unless you have faith to do it you just speak it and you do it oh God you have to speak it and live it speak it and do it speak it and believe it isn't that right now if we could thr ourselves completely to God and to his will and be lost our own thoughts and let the mind of Christ be in us then the same operation of the spirit would work through us as just the Natural Things music come up please hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah Jesus you have got to surrender your own thoughts your own will your own mind and let the mind of Christ to operate in you now let us look at as we close let us look at look the Prophecies of what's supposed to come under the bride's intelligence two three days talking about a woman the doctor was so amazed there was not even one trace of leema found in the child that's instantaneously on the mark the power of almighty God to take a bloodstream and cleanse it out right like that and the pulsation of a new life back in there because your bloodstream is your life mortal create new blood cells and clean out the old he said it was the creative act of almighty God to take a bloodstream that is contaminated with cancer until the little fellow yellow and puffed out but with a few minutes time a brand new bloodstream cured completely of leukemia cancer of the blood condemned to die but because of the miracle work power of God a new bloodstream that is not the intelligence of man that's the intelligence of God by the quickening power Hallelujah but bam said here now Hallelujah by the revelation of my faith what happens to B Canan the other day I believe that he always approaching when missing limbs will be restored and the glorious power of the Creator I believe he can make a scr appear there's man and woman got parts missing praise God as a complete animal itself so if God could create a complete animal God could give you a new spleen a new heart a new whatever it is a new liver praise God a new womb oh whatever you have need of God could give it to you new blood cells new bloodstream new blood veins new muscles new kneecap God could grow back what has been eaten away in the back of your spine God could take that tumor away that fibroid away oh give the Lord some Praises glory to God this is part of what the intelligence going to be here for Glory to God hallelujah hallelujah when a son is adopted you know all the people in the city gathered around and looked and they took upon a boy and the father had a ceremony of adoption and that D was adopted and his name on the check was just as good as his daddy and he had the prophecy now there is where God is trying to get his church just say to this mountain be moved it will move

out you cast them out not Jesus cast them out you will cast them out you and you and you and you and you and you and you and you all of you let's go how can the church the pente church and the Methodist and the Baptist Church be adopted until they come to discipline we've got to be disciplined first God could not trust this power with the church it's hard to tell what you're going to do how could the Father trust his business with a boy that might simply pollute his whole inheritance he wouldn't do it the church has got to come to a place to where it's discipline more discipline is not right Hallelujah all right it's a tightening when that time comes when the Press comes to a place where you're pressed out then watch what I'm fixing to tell you watch the third pull then amen praise
