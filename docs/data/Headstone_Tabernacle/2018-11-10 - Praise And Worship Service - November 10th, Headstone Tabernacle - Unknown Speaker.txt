government I have a mansion over there free from toilets I can't forget the Lord and shout of praise maybe see a man well god bless you friends it is certainly a privilege a great privilege should be in the house of the Lord Jesus Christ this evening among the levers of like precious faith both who I hear physically in the room and those that are connected live on the internet we certainly greet you tonight in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ I'd like to greet you on behalf of our pastor brother over tonight we say welcome to a fellowship in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen special welcome to all the churches and believers here special blessings to believers from Ephesians Tabernacle Bethlem tabernacle reveal with tabernacle little flock Tabernacle boat Tabernacle Eagles gathering and any other group fellowship this evening instead he went to acknowledge by the gorge go blessed you with a rotten gorge in the back of bless you welcome brother Guerrero god bless you for the Norris god bless you amen so I'm gonna get out of the way because tonight is a night to worship you man tonight is not a concert it's not entertainment it's not a show it's a gathering of worshipers because we were born to worship we were created to worship the devil wanted worship that's why he tried to have a pool up in heaven but we rejected that kook and our worship reserved we reserved Almighty God even when we are tired we worship even when we don't feel well we worship even if we're sick and body we worship because worship receives the blessing and the church a man he may be seated I always say there's a difference between praise and worship we praise God because he blesses we praise God because he does things for us we praise God for there are many reasons to praise God but worship has nothing to do with what God does for you it has to do with who he is worship is because He is God and he is worthy of the praise whether you have money or don't have money whether you were sick or you are well he is still caught by himself and he deserves our worship he deserves worship because he's a hobbit IRA he deserves worship because he's a homage , he deserves worship because he's a healer he's a restorer he's a deliverer he's a black Taizo he's a way makeup he's a planner he's a fortress He is God all by himself and ain't no rock all gonna praise me ain't no devil gonna take my joy hallelujah before I call back the worship leaders when God bless you sister Pam so good to see you in the house of the Lord today to give God things and for those who you don't know last night bandits went into their house and at gunpoint tied him up and robbed them and when I was book speaking about the Andy this morning she said she wants to come in the house of God because she has a reason to tell God that she's alive [Applause] [Music] so we've thank God that she is here tonight you may be seated and I heard somebody say something recently you know that song we sing in everything mmm thanks sometimes it's hard to give thanks for everything because when things come away that's hard it's hard to thank for it but in it we can find a reason to thank God he carries us through experiences and we can understand and it's hard to seek God thank you for this trial but we can see in this trial in everything we could get called thanks so I don't know what condition you came here tonight in but in everything we could kill the King of Kings all the hands so tonight is not about doctrine is not about fellowship is not about group it's about the shed blood that was shed on Calvary that when God sees shoot up blood he sees you perfect he sees you separate he sees you as a royal priesthood a peculiar people and to the young people that I hear the devil could have somebody cannot have all there will be some young people will reject the devil's offer we will reject as tires the fashions everything and we'll give God one hundred percent so may the Lord bless you be at home if you understand you can stand if you want to dance iike tents if you want to show he could shout if you want a run outside and run around the building you could do that because when John saw his name he said all in heaven all on the earth or under the earth he couldn't contain himself so this is not the place to be here tonight because when the Prophet spoke he said he felt to be him unseemly there's an unseemly kind of behavior that comes upon you and the Holy Ghost comes upon you you forget who's next to you you forget who's behind you you forget who's in front of you because it's a relationship that's not horizontal but it's vertical your relationship is not with man it's with coddled by himself made a lot less you we shall have a grand time in the holy ghost tonight Mira lo richly bless you [Music] are you happy tonight or you're appreciated reading from brother Isaac over this evening hallelujah hallelujah appreciate the testimony the appreciate sister Pam tonight or let's up my hands oh oh we want to give you all the thanks all the praise let's can we keep it at all in everything give him thanks a man I feel we should sing that tonight even a

just the fits in a circle why cuts off you're here then stick on a piece it makes no sense to me it's bone I've gotten desensitized yes it's insane but they cannot see that they worship Him in vain offering up strange fire can only cause death and yet they are already captured by that Nets Nimrod pipes Lucifer yes he's huntin he's prowling still capturing those who unsealed with the seven seals the church wall seems to think that they are worshiping God when the scripture clearly says that they are of their father the temple there seems to think that this is about signs wonders and miracles
