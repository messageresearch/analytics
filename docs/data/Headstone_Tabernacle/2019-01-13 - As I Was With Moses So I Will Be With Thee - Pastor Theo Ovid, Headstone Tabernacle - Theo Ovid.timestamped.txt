[50:26] pastors and teachers for the perfecting
[50:28] of the Saints for the work of the
[50:30] ministry for the edifying of the body of
[50:32] Christ till we all come into the unity
[50:35] of the faith of the knowledge of the Son
[50:37] of God unto a perfect man unto the
[50:40] measure of the stature of the fullness
[50:43] of Christ on a last scripture from Acts
[50:46] chapter 5 11 to 16 and this was just
[50:51] after illness and Sapphira fell dead in
[50:54] church after lying into the Holy Ghost
[50:56] verse 11 says a great fear came among
[50:59] all the church and upon as many as heard
[51:02] these things and by the hands of the
[51:05] apostles were many signs and wonders
[51:09] wrought among the people and they were
[51:12] all with one Accord in Solomon's porch
[51:15] and of the rest this no man joined

[51:26] multitude sport of men and woman in so
[51:29] much that they brought forth the sick

[55:31] sisters were sitting present now I said
[55:33] I saw a vision of a little girl just
[55:37] about so high blond-headed she was
[55:41] destined to die today
[55:43] in a wreck in the black automobile I
[55:48] said he had told me to pray for a child
[55:55] that this would be bypassed did you hear
[56:05] the vision said the child is gonna die
[56:09] today and he told me to pray for the
[56:14] child that this would be bypassed and I
[56:18] have
[56:23] and I said it is thus saith the Lord you
[56:30] will hear of it in the next 2-3 days

[58:36] was made different from all of us and

[1:15:23] how more profit let's continue the thing
[1:15:28] of it is the day there's a quote I've
[1:15:29] read before
[1:15:29] I'll read it back again we don't try to
[1:15:31] establish the wood of Gordon people's
[1:15:33] hearts we're trying to establish
[1:15:35] ourselves churches are trying to
[1:15:39] establish the doctrine of the church in
[1:15:42] a person's heart and the world first
[1:15:45] quote I read by Ballarat and George was
[1:15:47] there's no such thing as a holy church
[1:15:50] the Holy Ghost can be preached in it
[1:15:53] button in there you'll find good bad
[1:15:55] indifferent the Holy Ghost the church
[1:15:58] itself can't hold the Holy Ghost
[1:16:00] it is individuals opposed of illegal
[1:16:03] so it will leak out of a Trixie so we
[1:16:06] can't say we have it nobody else doesn't
[1:16:08] have it that doesn't make any sense we
[1:16:11] are something special we are see Abel is
[1:16:13] in shock it sounds good but it's not
[1:16:17] it's not true we are right everybody
[1:16:22] else is wrong it sounds good
[1:16:24] the busi people's head not hot but
[1:16:28] that's not the way he said we can hold
[1:16:31] the honey because honey is watching us
[1:16:33] in a group where people mash the corn
[1:16:36] when people upset you but you could
[1:16:38] forgive you could drop it you can behave
[1:16:40] yourself
[1:16:42] hallelujah even Jesus have mercy Father
[1:16:44] forgive them they know not what to do
[1:16:45] and we know faith is based upon
[1:16:47] forgiveness so you have no fear to get
[1:16:50] unless you could forgive you just
[1:16:53] messing up your own self yes yes yes if
[1:16:56] you can't come out them aunts and
[1:16:58] grudges and bad feelings and if you
[1:17:00] can't job that you in real trouble
[1:17:01] because you will never get the faith to
[1:17:03] claim and get the things on God because
[1:17:06] all things are bodies of faith you could
[1:17:08] never get nothing from God with reason
[1:17:10] and feelings and emotions
[1:17:13] God does respect faith faith as the
[1:17:15] currency of purchase and the kingdom of
[1:17:18] heaven
[1:17:19] [Applause]
[1:17:19] [Music]
[1:17:21] [Applause]
[1:17:23] [Music]
[1:17:25] so you can have a hundred thousand
[1:17:27] dollars worth of feelings that can't buy
[1:17:29] nothing in heaven but you have a hundred
[1:17:32] thousand would with a faith brother in
[1:17:34] seven come down and the biggest thing
[1:17:38] about faith you don't have to be rich to
[1:17:41] have faith listen to the point hacked
[1:17:44] this is the kingdom of God something
[1:17:47] brought upon your poor rich in faith it
[1:17:49] is a currency thy faith hath made thee
[1:17:52] whole
[1:17:52] by faith Abraham - why's it my fate
[1:17:57] Samson my faith even - chest time I fit
[1:18:01] you raise your hands this morning by
[1:18:03] faith you stood up never stand up in the
[1:18:05] service before but by vectors tunnel
[1:18:13] hallelujah you come with me pin and by
[1:18:17] faith you shake your knee because you're
[1:18:19] shaking on the pain the shaking of the
[1:18:22] condition I say hallelujah the kidneys
[1:18:32] giving trouble I say to take your own
[1:18:34] hands and the rest of like that this
[1:18:36] idea by faith you are believing you're
[1:18:39] knowing Tennyson's building upon your
[1:18:40] hand trains godmothers here this year is
[1:18:43] here wherever it is you lay hands on
[1:18:50] your own self Mississippi so we are
[1:19:05] commanded to establish the Word of God
[1:19:06] Paul said I didn't come to you with
[1:19:10] enticing words of man that you freed my
[1:19:13] dressed up in the knowledge of man but I
[1:19:15] come to you in the power and
[1:19:17] manifestation of the Holy Ghost that
[1:19:19] your faith might rest in God so if we
[1:19:22] come at a certain knowledge and certain
[1:19:24] information as a whoop oh boy but he
[1:19:26] could be really he is good he's very
[1:19:30] good he's like oh man I see manatee all
[1:19:34] but Paul didn't preach that way Paul
[1:19:37] what power that when they look at power
[1:19:39] this is what what they want to meet that
[1:19:40] power they want to touch that power
[1:19:43] Paul is not a power he's a channel of

[1:27:23] praise the name of the Lord this from
[1:27:26] the Division of the United States I when
[1:27:29] I first read this message the envision
[1:27:31] some of you may not even know what a
[1:27:33] Branham spoken message called the
[1:27:34] envision of United States I sometime I
[1:27:38] wonder in some if it is just spiritual
[1:27:40] or if it's also natural you talk about
[1:27:43] the Russians you talk about soldiers he
[1:27:44] talked about it's really something else

[1:28:14] Christ I went to a place you never go
[1:28:17] we're certainly in France they were
[1:28:18] supposed to come and why that picture of
[1:28:21] evangelists the man of the hour the man
[1:28:23] with this the man with that I some time

[1:51:26] Pentecostals because they become a
[1:51:28] capella Coast Anika's no this is the
[1:51:30] real thing the original Pentecost was
[1:51:32] the original Church the original fire we
[1:51:36] have to go back to that this is too much
[1:51:38] information
[1:51:42] I think people brains blown out in this
[1:51:44] massager

[1:52:23] you cannot say yes Lord in me okay the
[1:52:28] Lord show me or glory to God people so
[1:52:39] kneeling with knowledge no atmosphere as
[1:52:42] a batter because you have to no pressure
[1:52:44] way when see more Pentecostal guy when
[1:52:48] he saw it was time for the gifts he's
[1:52:50] Bible mom said they got in the spirit I
[1:52:52] began to pray the creature atmosphere
[1:52:54] and then the Holy Ghost fell and they
[1:52:56] started speaking tongues and I saw the
[1:52:58] prophesy and what not disorder if I were
[1:53:00] starting us on the street a man saw the
[1:53:02] promise and see that we have to say of
[1:53:05] it but let's look at the bigger picture
[1:53:07] the atmosphere was created before but I
[1:53:09] ran on come there was an atmosphere
[1:53:11] there because the would have to come in
[1:53:13] the spirit so that's why the problem was
[1:53:15] under the Pentecostals because they will
[1:53:17] have the spirit atmosphere that the work
[1:53:18] that come down but the Pentecostal
[1:53:20] rejected it so here it's showing a
[1:53:23] bright edge where you had to put a sieve
[1:53:25] and then he said the Pentecostal path in
[1:53:27] the restoration time so we are coming
[1:53:30] back to that this is the restoration
[1:53:32] time but yes I get a Pentecostal part in
[1:53:35] the restoration train lovely dynamics
[1:53:37] has to come Holy Ghost has to come
[1:53:39] that's your promise acts 1:8 you shall
[1:53:42] receive power after the Holy

[2:08:42] was chosen the narrow part you see
[2:08:45] against I had to walk by yourself I
[2:08:47] can't understand that Moses had to make
[2:08:49] his choice - he didn't have to do it but
[2:08:52] he did it the hard way because I was
[2:08:54] older than our path the hard way though

[2:11:23] to get warmed it'll hurt but if he's a
[2:11:25] still a soldier and got a purpose
[2:11:27] something to fight for
[2:11:28] he will rise and try again and Joshua
[2:11:31] the new commander of the army after
[2:11:32] Moody's passed on seeing that God stared
[2:11:35] with him and his mistakes he held his
[2:11:36] commissioner no matter what Moses done
[2:11:39] it was Moses office that God respected
[2:11:43] hallelujah more there was might be a
[2:11:45] little character but is the office that
[2:11:47] he respected he was a prophet and when
[2:11:50] he was above all the prophets he was
[2:11:52] really more than any prophet he had his
[2:11:54] own sister Lafferty for Marilyn it's
[2:11:55] European girl he called him together and
[2:11:57] said don't you fear God
[2:11:58] okay and that's a good thing don't
[2:12:01] trample upon God's people you hurt him
[2:12:02] when you do so God had commissioned
[2:12:05] Moses his failures meant nothing
[2:12:08] God knows is hot and we see every David
[2:12:13] David was all kind of stuff but he was a
[2:12:16] man after God's own heart sees what the
[2:12:19] heart
[2:12:20] Oh glory no God and one time Moses had
[2:12:23] too much to do and God took his spirit
[2:12:25] and invited among 17 they had no more
[2:12:27] spirit than he had in the beginning they
[2:12:29] only had more machinery but seemed among
[2:12:31] the Spirit God can put his entire spirit
[2:12:35] upon a man if he wants to or he can
[2:12:38] scattered among thousands if you want to
[2:12:41] Oh glory to God one day put his whole
[2:12:43] spirit upon a man called Jesus
[2:12:45] now he scattered a few stitches
[2:12:47] everywhere God keeps his commission or
[2:12:50] give the Lord some praises hallelujah
[2:12:54] glory of God let's call it further I
[2:12:58] think of a minister today that's call of
[2:13:00] God to step into the tracks where Jesus
[2:13:02] stood what a command what a commission
[2:13:04] but each that's called of God is
[2:13:06] commissioned to stand in that same place
[2:13:09] I'll be with you even in you to the end
[2:13:11] of the week each Minister is called to
[2:13:14] stand where he would the works that I do
[2:13:16] shall you do also each minister that is
[2:13:19] ordained of God is commanded to stand in
[2:13:22] the tracks of Jesus Christ and perform
[2:13:24] the duties that he's performed that's
[2:13:26] quite a command and if it must have felt
[2:13:28] when Josh was standing there that
[2:13:29] morning talking to God
[2:13:31] I'll be with you and sworn like that no
[2:13:33] the church organizations that might be
[2:13:35] closed off yesterday the church
[2:13:37] organizations has filled
[2:13:40] I don't think people get that yet and
[2:13:43] that's like waters allow judges to feel
[2:13:45] and fall that people go to lean on men
[2:13:48] or teachers just crashing and burning
[2:13:53] and falling it's not personal
[2:13:56] god I don't want to give no man no glory
[2:13:59] and the glory after what the God you
[2:14:01] know and any man want to take God's
[2:14:03] glory God will deal with that and he
[2:14:05] just want to take your ego will deal
[2:14:07] with that so what the church
[2:14:09] organization and listen the message
[2:14:11] itself cannot be denomination because it
[2:14:14] messes the light but you've got building
[2:14:16] dimensions along the life you can be
[2:14:19] less I wrong the message but the message
[2:14:21] itself is pure it's the word it's God
[2:14:25] I'll give the Lord a shout hallelujah if
[2:14:30] you build systems along the message but
[2:14:32] the message itself you can hold that and
[2:14:34] pin it down because God Himself the
[2:14:36] captain on board you can lock up inside
[2:14:39] of here he would be cold he will go out
[2:14:40] Oh glory to God I love him for that or
[2:14:44] glory that God hallelujah
[2:14:46] my my John debacles wasn't mixed but
[2:14:48] nobody when Jesus I'll mix it with
[2:14:51] everybody they have fallen for John not
[2:14:53] mixing they have all but Jesus mix well
[2:14:57] Jesus city well do need up a physician
[2:15:00] is he sick

[2:15:03] drunkards your mom what kind of people
[2:15:05] anybody country who defies you to mess
[2:15:07] with Jesus went and then a problem with
[2:15:09] that so then that is where they get so
[2:15:11] excited when they cut the woman caught
[2:15:13] in the very act of adultery and they
[2:15:15] come with this tool and moves this see
[2:15:16] and I just released it last night and
[2:15:18] you know the pretty tip and moves they
[2:15:20] say and they have the coat and they have
[2:15:22] the stones this is no problem and Moses
[2:15:24] say that which one of you without sin
[2:15:26] cast the first stone he bring it down to
[2:15:28] mirror their hearts I wanted to see the
[2:15:30] Hat condemned in them
[2:15:31] oh god the water will leave the one idea
[2:15:35] he said woman wait and an accusers go
[2:15:37] and sin no more freer from us and I
[2:15:39] wonder same Jesus that same Jesus Oh

[2:16:10] thing they come fill it up when you go
[2:16:13] to your thing they want to expose it its

[2:22:08] feet he know the Commission was
[2:22:10] tremendous far more what Moses had done
[2:22:13] Joshua had more to do then Moses have to
[2:22:16] do another thing this is important

[2:45:21] hell with all the makeup and mascara and
[2:45:23] when he called he said I made him a cup
[2:45:25] you say hello son what is it they
[2:45:27] instead of know all them drama they have
[2:45:28] on the face it's from hell they take it
[2:45:31] looking pretty you think it looking nice
[2:45:33] but hell as an largest mouth he say hell
[2:45:36] as no one the earth he saw a vision of
[2:45:38] that in hell he said watch preach the
[2:45:40] source in hell that did not accept mercy
[2:45:42] but we're eternally separate from his
[2:45:44] presence and yet they have to recognize
[2:45:46] it that he was God loss could never be
[2:45:49] safe they rejected mercy that was still
[2:45:53] full
[2:45:54] recently eternal laws Noah triples his -
[2:45:57] it was today lost when the door was shut
[2:46:00] oh my brother gives me a church full of
[2:46:03] the Holy Ghost ball doing one year what
[2:46:05] all theology field in two thousand years
[2:46:07] you ain't yet prophecy till the
[2:46:09] anointing of the church really strike
[2:46:11] home to that fearful at the remnant
[2:46:13] after the door the gel that is closed go
[2:46:16] and anoint assist them he who is thirty
[2:46:19] be filthy still he was right to the
[2:46:20] righteous till he was holy be holy still
[2:46:22] go along the church with the power of
[2:46:25] God and things will be taking place and
[2:46:27] then he saw the prison he began to pray
[2:46:29] Almighty God on this elected church I
[2:46:32] pray God that you will pour your
[2:46:35] blessings that they might receive our
[2:46:37] Ministry of testimony like lot had like
[2:46:40] Noah had like Jesus had on the return a
[2:46:42] loss if it be there that day them serve
[2:46:44] the sealed into the kingdom of God don't
[2:46:47] you rely upon some kind of emotional
[2:46:49] workup
[2:46:49] don't you rely upon your spoke in
[2:46:51] tongues I believe in those things I did
[2:46:53] all those things but if the life of
[2:46:54] Jesus is in you it will live itself out
[2:46:57] believe in every word because he cannot
[2:46:59] deny himself or glory that God lady if
[2:47:03] you or man whoever you are if those
[2:47:05] things that's so real in the world that
[2:47:08] Jesus died for not just to have a church
[2:47:10] to have a emotional punch but to have a
[2:47:12] bunch of got his spirit living in him
[2:47:14] it's bright and you know it doesn't
[2:47:17] operate through you that week you know
[2:47:20] these things in the Bible you just can't
[2:47:22] believe it to be so and you want to
[2:47:24] remember in prayer now whenever I close
[2:47:26] every head bowed I wonder this late hour
[2:47:28] and then he said this this is important
[2:47:30] it's maybe almost past feeling time
[2:47:33] because there will come a time like that
[2:47:35] when the Spirit of God will be taken
[2:47:37] from the earth and there will be no more
[2:47:40] the church will remain a while preaching
[2:47:43] because it has to preach the eternal
[2:47:45] lost just as every ministry did come
[2:47:47] into the age the last part of every
[2:47:50] ministry preached eternal loss there
[2:47:52] will be a ministry now that were
[2:47:54] preached eternal loss as they refused to
[2:47:56] receive it Oh glory to God
[2:47:59] what a crucial time that we live in how
[2:48:02] careful we must be that remain true to
[2:48:04] the word not take from it to act it for
[2:48:07] he would speak my God had not spoken
[2:48:09] makes him their liar what I had
[2:48:11] particularly his mind is this at the
[2:48:13] turn of the century the hunger for God
[2:48:15] was generated and if anything each
[2:48:17] brought a cry for the Spirit of God and
[2:48:19] when the cry was answered by God
[2:48:21] seven for the manifestation in tongues
[2:48:23] interpretation and prophesy a group
[2:48:25] immediately almost contrary to the word
[2:48:29] drop my doctrine that tongues was
[2:48:31] evidence of being baptized with the Holy
[2:48:33] Ghost tongues was far from evidence they
[2:48:36] were manifestations but not evidence the
[2:48:39] falsity of doctrine can only be seen by
[2:48:41] a lack of scripture to substantiate it
[2:48:44] but those who subscribe to the doctrine
[2:48:46] immediately here is organized on the
[2:48:48] basis of doctrine proven that they were
[2:48:51] not in the truth as they were have
[2:48:53] people believed it look good it looked
[2:48:57] at original Pentecost but they prove it
[2:48:59] wasn't because organized it could not be
[2:49:02] back to the original word until the
[2:49:05] world restored the prophet had not yet
[2:49:07] come but now according to the time of
[2:49:09] his tan in laude son age the prophet
