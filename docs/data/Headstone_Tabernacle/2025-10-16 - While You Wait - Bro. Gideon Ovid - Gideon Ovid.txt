Thou knowest my downsitting and my uprising. Thou understandeth my thought a far off. Thou compasseth my path and my lion down and quit it with all my ways.

And any person here sick in body, sick in mind, sick in spirit that you would touch them and bless them and help them father. Those who are listening live, may you be with them also in Jesus name we ask it. Amen and amen. Praise God. Before I have your seat, I just want to read two script uh scripture here from Joel chapter 3:10. Praise God. It says, "Beat your plowshares into swords and your prudent hooks into spears. &gt;&gt; Let the weak say, &gt;&gt; I am strong." &gt;&gt; You may have your seat. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So, I've been out to pursue a special mission. I was um in Miami and I am here tonight and um brother G I'm going to share something for you to you tonight. Praise the Lord. We appreciate him and um in a few days time I'll be off to India. So I want to solicit a prayer Friday late Friday night I'll be off to India have some meetings there and um it's quite something what the Lord is doing right now. But I want to exhort you tonight a little word before leaving. Let the weak say &gt;&gt; I am strong. I am strong. &gt;&gt; Something I said to the church in Miami, war is coming. &gt;&gt; Whether you're ready or not, &gt;&gt; war is coming. &gt;&gt; What next? Prepare for war &gt;&gt; because war is coming. Okay. So, I want to read the next scripture from Mark 16. This is Jesus. And when he and then when they had heard that he was alive and had been seen of her, believe not. This is disciples. This is Christians now. This is people in Jesus message with books with tips hearing the Messiah himself. They do believe after he taught them after he shared himself with them right after he appeared in another form and two of them as they walk and went into the country and they went and told it unto the residue neither believed them. This is believers now coming with a true testimony and they still not being believed. &gt;&gt; Amen. They still not been received. Afterward, he appeared to the 11 as they sat at meat and upgraded them or rebuked them or straightened them out &gt;&gt; and they of the and upra them with their unbelief and hardness of heart. &gt;&gt; Saints, we have a lot of repenting to do. you know, &gt;&gt; of unbelief and hardness of heart, you know, and a lot of repenting to do. You know, I myself, I said, "Look, but sometimes, you know, like um I misplaced two pictures, two passport pictures uh to get uh uh uh to apply for the visa for Nigeria." And um just couldn't find it. And I'm praying home, I said, "Lord, you know exactly where this is. I don't have to go and take no more pictures. It's somewhere here in the house. You know exactly where it is." And I keep looking different things. And afterwards, I just felt led to move a certain way. And and there it was. I said, "But God is God and such a lift a band and praise God." Because it was such a thing. And I'm thinking to myself, how much time we neglect asking God and seeking the Lord and and looking intervention and we going in the humanistic realm and fighting up, fighting up. But we have to come to this place where we have absolute trust and confidence that the God we serve, the God you serve, he said, "My people shall never be ashamed and be satisfied and praise the name of the Lord your God." We went through all kind of stuff, but he said something about his people. He said, "My people shall never be ashamed." Oh, praise God. You would get back your strength. You would get back your courage. You would get back your faith. Praise God. Afterwards he appeared unto 11 as they sat at meat and upraided him and their unbelief and hardness of heart. Listen he called it unbelief. &gt;&gt; These are nice precious believers disciples you know he say hardness of heart because they believe not them which seeing him after he was risen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he said unto them and with all that he rebuked them but they are the ones he have to use. &gt;&gt; They are the ones God have to use. After all the rebukes don't feel bad that you that that that you're finished. You're not finished at all. You know, God will as many as I love, I rebuke. I don't rebuke them. Do who I don't love. You know what? You see why who I love, I rebuke them and chasen them and straighten them out and upra them and encourage them. Oh, praise the name of the Lord. Hallelujah. Praise God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Taking my grandson from school today and there's a little drain to cross to go go to the house. I said, "You could cross that." And he just step over it. I said, "Look at that. You could do it." And he did it. Normally he's lift him up over and thing, but he crossed it this time. And I'm watching him and I'm telling myself, I wonder what God has be seen with us. Boy, when God see us crossing things that we never crossed before, overcoming things we never overcome before. I feel God is feel proud of his sons and daughters. Maybe you never think about that. Praise God. But you see the little effort that you're making. You see the little that you're doing and oh, praise God. When you start to do that, God will feel proud of you. Look at my son. My son coming. You see, because they are small guys. They are big men in small form. &gt;&gt; We see little children but they are really you know mini ones of the big ones. &gt;&gt; They just their time may come yet. They'll play like children act like children but their time is coming &gt;&gt; of maturity &gt;&gt; and I think God looking at us. We once were playing like children carrying foolish like children speaking wrong things and whatn not. When I was a child spake like a child understood like a child but when I became a man I put away childish things. So whenever God when we come to that spot, God feels proud. Look at my son. Look at my daughter. Oh, praise God. They're under pressure. They're under all kind of stress, but they holding on. They hanging inside of there. You think God doesn't see that? You think God doesn't see the intent of your heart and your desire. The devil want to point at your failures. The devil want to point at your shortcomings. The devil want to point at your past, but God is pointing towards your future. Beat the pouches. Oh, glory to God. Hallelujah. beat your pulse into sword. In other words, take your agricultural tool &gt;&gt; and cut it into weapons of warfare because you have to fight for what you know is your own. Okay, the Lord I shout. Don't just sit there and take licks on the enemy. Hallelujah. Let the weak say I am strong. The re, you know words, you're reversing the whole thing on the devil. Letting the devil know you're not going to just take that blows, but you're going to fight back. You're going to come back. You're going to come back better. You're going to come back stronger. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So he rebuked his disciples. He said unto them, these the same disciples now &gt;&gt; go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature. Them fellas frighten them fell going and lock yourself up in your room. But he's given them a commission. Go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature. He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved. He that believeth not shall be damned. And these signs shall follow them that believe in my name. This is Jesus talking now. They don't know prophet or pastor or teacher or evangelist. This is Jesus talking now. In my name, they shall cast out devils. They shall speak with new tongues. They shall take up serpents. And if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them. They shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover. &gt;&gt; So then after the Lord has spoken unto them, he will receive up into heaven, sat in the right hand of God, and they went forth and preached everywhere. the Lord working with them and confirming the word with signs following. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is brother Brandham. He's praying. He's Oh God, how we need in this journey that we're in now to find a place of rest and to feast on the word of God &gt;&gt; so that it will give us strength. &gt;&gt; You can't get strength from movies. &gt;&gt; You can't get strength from comic strip or or or magazines and whatnot. You get strength from the word &gt;&gt; because the word is your source. So it will give us strength night after night. Go to the room and rest and come back next morning and fresh and eat more. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Why? Here why to eat more. For there's a great journey and a great battle ahead &gt;&gt; for the church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We're not talking about we talking about Putin and and and and Russia and China. We're not talking about that. We're talking about for the church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; America send the war vessels looking to invade Venezuela or whatever they want to do. what they intend they want to do they have to do they do you know &gt;&gt; it's war it's spirits you know &gt;&gt; understand what is is is is principalities and powers and spirits territorial demons and thing you know fighting for position fighting for territory that what Russia is all about in Ukraine you know &gt;&gt; what about the bride &gt;&gt; we have a territory &gt;&gt; we have a domain &gt;&gt; we have things that God called us unto &gt;&gt; but he says the revelation to you is you have to fight &gt;&gt; for what you know &gt;&gt; is yours &gt;&gt; is your own. You can't possess what is not your own. But if the revelation of the word coming to you show you what is yours, you say that is my devil. &gt;&gt; You can't keep that back from me. I'm going to take back from the devil what he took from me. &gt;&gt; You can't sit down and just take life and say, well, you know, that's how it is. That's how it is. Cut that nonsense out &gt;&gt; and begin to fight. &gt;&gt; Shout out fight. &gt;&gt; Some of you not fighting, but you have to fight. God set it up that way. You'll hear that tonight. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham, there's a great journey and a great battle ahead for the church. I believe that we have been children long enough. &gt;&gt; God is going to turn his church into manhood now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. and we played and frolic as children. But now we going to have to put away childish things and take on manhood maturity. I'm still reading. &gt;&gt; This is not a psychology book. This is from a prophet. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I believe was Paul who said when I was a child, speaking as a child because he thought as a child, but it's time we begin to think like men and women now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For we have got to get down to business. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Could somebody say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, I pray for these ministers, their churches, their people. God, may their little churches grow until it spreads out and may out of their churches go mighty vanish and missionaries all over the world. &gt;&gt; He's praying for that. &gt;&gt; Let us work, Lord, for we know we have much more time to work. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; Remember, this is the time you had to work. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Whether you have your hair on your head or you're wearing a wig, &gt;&gt; this is the time you have to work. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Whether you have shoes or you have no shoes, you have a hole in your shoes, this is the time to work. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You can't work on the other side. This is the time to love. &gt;&gt; This is time to forgive. &gt;&gt; There's time to drop your odds. &gt;&gt; Here is where you do it. &gt;&gt; It's scary for me, you know, because I'm seeing brother Red came here and talk about debt doesn't change people. Baram said that. &gt;&gt; That is scary. You know I dealt with somebody with oats in their heart and when I went to them to talk to them about giving their life a stroke and everything they said why should I drop it I said I come back said expected to repent and everything else in Jesus name I said again 24 hours and I went back in 24 hours but then they said they ready to to let go so is it that somebody wicked and they go die that way wicked and &gt;&gt; death doesn't change you &gt;&gt; got to change now &gt;&gt; amen If you're mean, you're evil, you're wicked, you're jealous, whatever it is, you will die and you will go to hell with those things because heaven can't hold that. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; Do you understand that? This is serious enough. This with pastor oid, this have to do with God's requirement. &gt;&gt; Amen. Say &gt;&gt; listen to this now. He said, "Lord, let us work, Lord, for we know we haven't much more time to work. We see time closing in. Soon we are looking for the angel that will set his foot on the land and the sea. Raise up his hand and swear by him the list forever and ever that time shall be no more. He said that time the mystery of God shall be finished. We understand now father that God's three-fold mystery has been made known to us. And we understand that we are looking now for those mysterious thunders that came out of heaven in the book of revelation that was seen the book that was sealed in the back of the book. Listen to this. Reveal to us, oh Lord, the things that we need for the battle ahead of us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Forgive our sins and our many neglectful things, our iniquity. We pray this afternoon that you'll do exceedingly abundantly above all that we could do or think. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother, &gt;&gt; I'll close with this. My brother, I'm going to pick you a song. Forgive me. Come on. Yet Abraham had a right to the promise. And the promise was his. Watch. He had a right to it. And the promise was his. I'll say to you, you have a right to it. &gt;&gt; And the promise is yours. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Good. Could I hear amen? &gt;&gt; Or you're still in unbelief? Do you hear amen again? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. Yet he had to fight &gt;&gt; to possess it. &gt;&gt; There you are, the believer today. Yet we are air to all things. Yet we are air to every spiritual blessing. every physical blessing. Wait, is that a physical blessing too? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Yes. You don't have to accept sickness like sickness is a bonus. &gt;&gt; It's not an increase in pay with sickness. You don't have to accept sess at all. &gt;&gt; I reject that. &gt;&gt; I have a right to be whole. &gt;&gt; I have a right to be well. &gt;&gt; I don't care if I'm 90 and 90. I have a right to be that's my right. &gt;&gt; Satan have a right to inflict and do all what he have to do. That is his job. My job is to claim healing, &gt;&gt; claim deliverance, claim breakthrough. [Applause] &gt;&gt; So I have a right to every I'm an air to spiritual blessing, physical blessing. Here we go. Every blessing the Bible promises. Yet you have to fight every inch of it. &gt;&gt; Here we go. I hope this anchor tonight. That's the way God got it set up. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So you are crying for it. You're crying. Crying tears. Long tears. Crying is not going to bring it. Faith, faith, walk, action, work. You have to press. You have to labor. &gt;&gt; All right. That's the way God is set up that way. You have to fight. Here we go. To possess what you know is your own. You have to fight to possess it. May the Lord bless you. Praise God. And Jason will come and sing a song and get will come and share something with us tonight. &gt;&gt; There is no else like you. There is no one else like you. For you are great. You do miracles so great. There is no one else like you. [Music] There is any honor. Lord, we lift our hands and worship as we praise your holy name. For you are great. You do miracles so good. There is no one else like you. There is no [Music] There is no one else like you. There is no one else. And you are great. You do miracles so great. There is no one else like you. [Music] Oh, there is no one else like you. For you are great. You do miracles so great. There is no one else like you. There is no one else like you. [Music] Blessed be the name of the Lord. Let's just give the Lord a hand of praise. [Applause] You love him tonight. My my my. Thank you, brother Jason. What an atmosphere we feel in here. You appreciate the pastor tonight. What words, what an inspiration, what an encouragement. Thank you, musicians. Oh my, &gt;&gt; what a mighty God we serve. Amen. &gt;&gt; I sat I sat to the side and I only smile. I say it seems like my notes will leak tonight for a title. My title is while you wait and in inspiration you have work to do. So we have to fight tonight. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You have work to do is the inspiration and the title is while you wait. &gt;&gt; While we wait &gt;&gt; we have work to do. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you have your Bibles, I'd like you to open two short scriptures. Amen. One from the book of Habacok chapter 2:3 and the other one from Psalms 105 verse1 17-19. Amen. Reading from the book of Habac chapter 2:3 and it says, "For the vision is yet for an appointed time, &gt;&gt; but at the end it shall speak &gt;&gt; and not lie, though it tar, wait for it, because it will surely come, it will not tarry." Amen. &gt;&gt; And in the book of Psalms reading chapter 105 from verse 17 to 19, it says, "He sent a man before them, even Joseph, who was sold for a servant, whose feet they hurt with fetterss. He was laid in iron until the time that his word came, the word of the Lord tried him." &gt;&gt; May we just bow our heads as we open in a word of prayer. Oh heavenly father, tonight we pause at this time, Lord, to give you praise, to give you thanks, to give you glory and honor, Lord. Lord, we appreciate this opportunity that we have to to delve into your scriptures, Lord. Lord, any man could read it. I pray that you would open it, Lord. Lord, these inspired words that you would inspire to our hearts, Lord. Open our understanding, Lord. Speak to your people. Take me out of the way, Lord. Lord, I pray that you would bring the message that you want brought tonight, Lord. Lord, I pray that no one will leave here the same way they came. Lord, I pray that those that may interact with this content even afterward, Lord, that the Holy Spirit will drop down wherever they are, Lord, and people will be healed, sealed, delivered, set free, Lord, they'll be inspired, Lord, uplifted, built up, Lord, that they could be drawn closer to you, Lord. Have your perfect will in this service, Lord. Lord, I pray that you would cover us with your love, your protection, your presence will fill upstairs, downstairs, Lord, wherever your your people might be tonight, Lord. Lord, I pray that you have your perfect work in Jesus name we pray. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You may have your seats at this time. &gt;&gt; Amen. You love him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Blessed be his holy name. So, we read the scriptures and you know the title. While we wait for an inspiration, you have work to do. So, we in a battle and we've got to fight. while we're waiting. No matter how long the wait is, we have to fight. We have to prepare. We have work to do. Amen. &gt;&gt; And speaking about Joseph and the scripture said his feet were hurt with fetterss. He was laid in iron until the time that his word came. Now, what's important to to see with Joseph is that Joseph was born with a purpose on his life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It took 30 years to manifest that purpose, but he was born with a purpose on his life. Amen. &gt;&gt; He had to wait 30 years going through tests, going through trials, going through criticism, having fights, h having all kind of things done to him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But it took him to the point where his purpose was fulfilled. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In doing so, he had to be trained. &gt;&gt; He couldn't wake up, have a dream, and say, you know what? I'm going to rule. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I am going to do this because I had a dream and I believe God sent this and this is the direction I should go. No, he had to be trained. &gt;&gt; Amen. He had to be trained and he he he had to get management training. &gt;&gt; He was sent to potty for his house and and and he was led to be leader of his household. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He had to have that leadership quality because God was preparing him to lead &gt;&gt; in Egypt. &gt;&gt; But what his purpose was was really to preserve the life &gt;&gt; of his people. &gt;&gt; And he had to be trained and qualified and in a position that he could do so. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now along the way and this is where I'llident identify along the way as he waited to come into the fullness of his manifestation or the fullness of his purpose he had to have the right attitude. &gt;&gt; So perhaps at first when his brother sold him into slavery he he threw a pity party. Why me? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Why me? Why is this the journey that you want to pass me through? &gt;&gt; He perhaps didn't know the answer. Why would he be the one to victimize him? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Why they throw him into prison? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Why Patifah's wife of all the people in the household, me, you accuse me, I in prison. &gt;&gt; But God had a purpose for him. &gt;&gt; And is often said, if you fail the test, the test will come again. &gt;&gt; So he chained and he thrown in in a ditch, fell for Satan. Guess what? &gt;&gt; It was coming again. when he testified to the bucklan baker, he wasn't redeemed and pulled out. You know, &gt;&gt; he was left there forsaken again because God knows he want Joseph to be in a perfect standing, &gt;&gt; a perfect position. &gt;&gt; The same way you say Abraham faith, Isaac love, &gt;&gt; jot grace and Joseph perfection. God wanted him to be perfected &gt;&gt; in his context so he could fulfill his purpose the way God wanted it. In doing so, God send test. He tests him with his family. &gt;&gt; His brothers, &gt;&gt; the people close to him. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Throw him aside. &gt;&gt; They might have been jealous, might be envious. It didn't matter. &gt;&gt; That was the test that God set out for him &gt;&gt; because God knew he wanted him in that position. He wanted him to get that experience. So don't question your test tonight while you wait. God working on you. While you wait to come into your purpose, God will send test to build you and to build you up into that perfect position, that perfect individual that he want you to be. &gt;&gt; So he sent test after test. &gt;&gt; He tested his attitude. Can you imagine when the butler was restored, you say, "Boy, how ungrateful that fell is." Imagine I come and I tell him his future. I tell him what the vision meant &gt;&gt; and he forget me. Can you imagine if Joseph was was was Triny? Yes. &gt;&gt; Or now he's still in prison. But God needed the right attitude. Why? The right mental attitude &gt;&gt; to any divine promise of God will bring it to pass. &gt;&gt; Amen. So he had to walk with the right attitude. You know what? Perhaps my time is not yet. &gt;&gt; I just have to do what I have to do. My time hasn't come. But I have to operate a particular way. operate the way that God expects because only then he could bless you. If not, you go through the test again. &gt;&gt; Go through the test again because God wants perfection. &gt;&gt; Amen. So when it reached that point that God could use him, guess what? He moved from prison to power. &gt;&gt; When he's the prime minister, he could now fulfill his purpose in the position that God would have assigned at his birth &gt;&gt; after 30 years. During the wait he had to go through Patifa's wife and that scenario going into jail his brothers coming forgiving them when they came all kind of stuff he went through but it was worth it because he fulfilled the purpose that God had for his life. [Applause] &gt;&gt; If I switch gears to Abraham he's known as the father of faith. We could find him in Hebrews 11 as well. And when they talk about him, they say, "You know what? He staggered not through unbelief." &gt;&gt; Now, we know the story. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Abraham was about 80 years old. And God said, "Listen, you'll be the father of many nations." As a matter of fact, he said, "I will return unto you according to the time of life." &gt;&gt; So, you know what he had to to do, right? &gt;&gt; He had to wait. &gt;&gt; He had to wait until God didn't say, "I returning in 9 months. I returning in two years." No. God say you have to wait until. But you know what? While you wait, you have things you have to do. &gt;&gt; While you wait, you have to testify. &gt;&gt; While you wait, you have to prepare yourself. &gt;&gt; Because listen, brother Brandham said, "The longer Abraham waited is actually the bigger the miracle. &gt;&gt; The longer you so or you thought you were go going through something, the longer you go through your test is the bigger the victory." You know &gt;&gt; the longer Abra after year one if it happened after one year that's brilliant &gt;&gt; glorious victorious but you could imagine in the 23rd year &gt;&gt; in the 23rd year imagine the same Abraham when you in your natural element at this time starting to doubt and say well I wonder if God really say he will use me boy I feel is really somebody probably is my cousin I hear it I wonder if is another interpretation. I wonder if the prophet meant this boy. I wonder if it really applies to this time. I wonder if the word is really what it's supposed to be or I need another doctrine to line up with my thoughts. No, he had to be steadfast &gt;&gt; and hold on to the promise of God because if he could stand on the word &gt;&gt; with faith &gt;&gt; if he could have the right attitude, &gt;&gt; if he could testify. So you know what? &gt;&gt; He was criticized. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Based on his age, &gt;&gt; based on his wife, &gt;&gt; his wife laughed. &gt;&gt; She made it all kind of suggestions. She made suggestions. It had distractions. It had all kind of obstacles. But he overcame that and said, "Listen, I'm holding on to the promise still. I'm not moving from here. I'm being steadfast. I'm being fixed and focused because I believe he who made the promise is able to fulfill it in my life. It's not from a neighbor. It's not from a friend, but is mine. And every place I put my foot, I am going to possess it tonight." So healing is mine. Sealing is mine. Deliverance is mine. Adoption is mine. The Holy Ghost is mine. Because he promised it. And if he promises, and he's the same yesterday, today, and forever, nothing is going to shift me. Nothing is going to throw me off. Nothing is going to make me lose my focus. My faith is resting on that. I am standing on that because he promised that. And he want that for me. &gt;&gt; As a matter of fact, you may be seated. When when you look at the story of Job, &gt;&gt; Job was taken out of his normal living. &gt;&gt; Job was a prosperous man. &gt;&gt; He was going through his natural journey. &gt;&gt; But God said, "Listen, &gt;&gt; have you considered my servant Job? &gt;&gt; Listen, I'm going to fast for forward a little bit. &gt;&gt; When Job waited &gt;&gt; for his change to come, he said, listen, though the skin worms destroy my body, &gt;&gt; I want to have a testimony. I want to vocalize it. &gt;&gt; This is not something just remaining in my heart &gt;&gt; and I'm holding on to it here. I want to let you know in my flesh I will see God. &gt;&gt; I want to let you know I'm aware of the distractions. My friends have their opinions. My good family have their ideas. Even my wife you speak kind of foolish there. Ma'am, &gt;&gt; I love you and know but you're talking foolishness, right? I'm not going to allow that distraction to throw me off. Amen. &gt;&gt; I am not going to lose my focus because I'm fixed on the promise of God that in my flesh I'm going to see him. No matter listen as David say if a thousand fall on one hand and 10,000 on the next hand I shall not be moved. I'm not going to shift away from the promise. I'm going to hold fast to faith and have a testimony no matter what comes my way. Listen, when we look at Mary, the angel visited Mary and say, "Mary, listen. You a special woman. You're highly favored. &gt;&gt; You are a virgin, but we have a special purpose for you. &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit is going to overshadow you and you're going to have a son." And she said, "Be it done unto me &gt;&gt; according to your word." &gt;&gt; So, she accepts that this is her portion. &gt;&gt; But she too had work to do. You will observe every corrector I identify here. They had their own work to do. It wasn't your waiting and I sit down and hoping and praying that time pass. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; I sit down and I waiting on the rapture in a corner here that nothing will happen to me because I don't want nothing to happen because I waiting on No, no, no. You have something to do. You have work to do. You have something that's a requirement of God tonight. So Mary said, "Be it done unto me according to thy word." But you know what? &gt;&gt; She had a testimony in her heart. &gt;&gt; So she ran to Elizabeth &gt;&gt; and say, "Listen here. What I don't know about you, but I met an angel." And the angel say she testified because she was so convinced that that was the promise of God. She could testify about it. &gt;&gt; So let me ask you, &gt;&gt; you have promises tonight. &gt;&gt; Who you testifying to? &gt;&gt; Who you telling about it? How excited are you? &gt;&gt; How convinced are you that it's going to come to pass? &gt;&gt; She not just testified, she had the right attitude. &gt;&gt; So, she didn't sit down and say, "You know what? I'm going to the pharmacy to get two pregnancy test. I go buy three just in case cuz I'm not sure what the result will look like." No, she immediately &gt;&gt; because she believed the word she heard was the word of God. &gt;&gt; And if her faith stood on that word, nothing could stop it. Listen, it must come to pass. It must accomplish whatsoever it was sent out to accomplish. It will never return void. As a result, her faith could rest on that. &gt;&gt; So her work was have the right right attitude. When she talked to Joseph, when she talked to Elizabeth, anybody she spoke quick, she said, "Listen, the angel tell me &gt;&gt; this is the word of God. &gt;&gt; And I'm not too bothered by what you think about it. and not too bothered by your opinion. Everything else is a distraction. But I want to stand on faith knowing that he who promised this is able to fulfill it and the manifestation will be the interpretation. I don't need the doctor idea. I don't need to go by the gynecologist tonight to find out if I'm pregnant tonight. No, I believe his word is true. &gt;&gt; It never failed. It's the same yesterday, today, and forever. So I could rest on that knowing that this is my job at the time. Have the right attitude. Have faith believing that his word will come to pass. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Listen, Paul and Silas, these fellas were preaching. They were moving through and they met a woman. &gt;&gt; The woman was possessed with a a time &gt;&gt; and Paul cast the demon out. They say the demon left that hour. &gt;&gt; The hour he left. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The profitability index went down &gt;&gt; because she was earning money for her master &gt;&gt; at that point. Guess what? They report them. They put them on Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, Tik Tok. They do videos about them &gt;&gt; to the extent that they were arrested. &gt;&gt; They were beaten. They were thrown into prison at the time. &gt;&gt; But guess what? Even in prison, &gt;&gt; while waiting to be released &gt;&gt; while waiting, they start to work. &gt;&gt; The Bible records at midnight They pray, &gt;&gt; they praise, they worship. It wasn't in their heart so soft that nobody could hear and boy are so embarrassed. If you know I make a little jail and all. No, no, no, no, no. Listen. The God I serve like like the three Hebrew boys. If they don't deliver us, we still bow. No. They start to sing. &gt;&gt; They start to worship. They start to praise. They start to pray because they knew the God they serve. And the God they serve is able to deliver them. So while in prison at midnight, they say they worship so much. They praise so much that an earthquake happened. &gt;&gt; Read the scripture yourself. &gt;&gt; They were not loosed. You know, &gt;&gt; you didn't see their band just come out and a handcuff come out and they were were in bondage. Here the Bible account is that all the prisoners &gt;&gt; were set free. You know, &gt;&gt; all of them became loose. &gt;&gt; All of them were let go. That praise and worship was so powerful. Their testimony was so powerful that it impacted the neighborhood. It impacted the prisoners. It impacted the people around them. So the same one who you think have an issue with with you when you start to praise and worship in your circumstance. Nothing is going to stop it. The power of God is going to move such that you can't even determine how far it goes. They may not have known the other prisoners in there, but just by virtue of the environment, the other prisoners were set free. &gt;&gt; They said their bands were loosed, that is the reason the prison guards were so concerned &gt;&gt; because the prison guards objective were to keep them in prison, &gt;&gt; keep them bondage. &gt;&gt; So when they had this attitude that listen, nothing is going to stop the testimony, &gt;&gt; nothing is going to stop the power of God. They were casting out devils and preaching in Jesus name. Right? So nothing was going to hinder them. They were very public and vocal knowing that God they serve is able to deliver them. &gt;&gt; That is how they worked while they waited for God to deliver them. &gt;&gt; After that as you know when the prison guard was saved they let them go so they could continue to preach &gt;&gt; preach the gospel &gt;&gt; for the name of Jesus. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Listen, Noah, we know the story. &gt;&gt; In Noah's case, it had never rained. &gt;&gt; The kind of faith required &gt;&gt; to believe that something that never was done &gt;&gt; is is spectacular. &gt;&gt; Rain had never come on the earth before. &gt;&gt; When God told Noah, now God didn't tell Noah's wife. &gt;&gt; He didn't tell Noah's sons. And it's important. I was discussing this with somebody just recently. Noah's sons weren't little children. They themselves had wives. &gt;&gt; So, this wasn't, "You know what? Let me grab up my little boy or my little girl." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Noah was mature. &gt;&gt; He heard from God. &gt;&gt; And he was so convinced &gt;&gt; that he started to testify to everybody. &gt;&gt; It will rain. &gt;&gt; It will rain in the morning, in the noon time, in the evening. It didn't matter. convention after convention for 120 years. He believed that rain was coming. &gt;&gt; It was going to rain. So he had a legitimate testimony without a sign. &gt;&gt; He didn't have a a a a pastor or some deacon or elder musician, a disciple, you know, sometime rain will come. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. He just had pure unadulterated faith in the word of God &gt;&gt; and the promise of God. So why he waiting on rain? He working. &gt;&gt; He building. He preaching, &gt;&gt; testifying. He had the attitude that listen, you never see rain. I never see rain. So you can't tell me any different from what I believe. I believe the promise of God. The promise of God is that it will rain. &gt;&gt; No matter what you think, what you say, what the meteorologist come and say, "Well, listen, Noah, we want to have a meeting. We want to have a a, you know, a general meeting so we could convince you that in the history of mankind, there was no rain before. So this is absurd. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Even if that was the case of the day, Noah wasn't taking that. &gt;&gt; Noah believed the promise of God. &gt;&gt; And while he was waiting on rainy building, &gt;&gt; so his testimony wasn't just a a verbal or vocal one. &gt;&gt; His testimony was live. &gt;&gt; He was listening to the instructions to the obedience of the promise and building to suit. &gt;&gt; He was building the ark as directed by God. So anybody could see this man is not just talking the talk. He walking the talk. His action supporting it. His work supporting it because he believe and he's so convinced that he's putting it into action. He's putting in the work now because he knows he who made the promise is able to come and perform it. &gt;&gt; And we know the end of the story. He had and women &gt;&gt; they had choices &gt;&gt; to go through that window and escape &gt;&gt; because daddy this kind of oldfashioned oldtime Holy Ghost fililled revival this kind of fanatical shouting kind of thing. I don't really think this is applicable now because the new thing is to sit down and relax a little bit. The new thing is to stay home and stream. No. At the end of the day, Noah had such a testimony, such an attitude. He had such love for his family that even if they tried, he loved them so much that he will prevent them from doing so because he wanted what's best for them like any father should. So no matter what the test was, he was determined to work not just selfishly for himself, but for the well-being and and and the prolonged life of his family. That is how we ought to be as brothers and sisters. Caring one for each other. &gt;&gt; Caring for your sons and your daughters enough. Not to force them, but pray for them. Not to force them, but to have a burden for them. To see them delivered. To see them set free. To see them have their own experience with the baptism of the Holy Ghost. We should have such a burden, such a desire knowing that God promised it. And he who made the promise is able to fulfill it. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; In Moses time, &gt;&gt; God told Moses, he gave him a commission. He said, "Listen, I want you to go to Egypt because I've heard the cries of my people. &gt;&gt; I have heard their distress. I have heard the way they operate under the taskmaster's whip and I want you to bring them out from Egypt. Not to just leave them in the middle of nowhere. I want you to bring them to this mountain here so they could worship. &gt;&gt; That is what I want. &gt;&gt; I don't want them come on a joy ride. I want them to leave the position they are in now to come to a certain mountain to a certain place to worship because God desires worship. He desires praise. So there's always something for you to do. There's always something required of us. There is always more that we could do. So when he gave Moses the instruction, listen. He said, "I have seen their affliction. &gt;&gt; So it's not in vain. So he heard your cry. He know you want your family restored. He know you want a breakthrough. He hears. He sees. They say, listen, the prayer of the righteous avail much. He listening. He know the sincere cry. &gt;&gt; He know the burden you have. &gt;&gt; It's in the word. He say, "I've heard the cries." &gt;&gt; Are you crying tonight? &gt;&gt; Are you burdened tonight? &gt;&gt; What work you're putting in? &gt;&gt; You want the result, but what work you willing to put in? &gt;&gt; War is at hand. You're getting ready to to fight a battle, but what you're putting in, you have to have the right attitude. You have to have the right mental capacity to know. Listen, healing is mine tonight. Listen, not one will be left behind. Because when he told Moses, "Bring them out." He didn't say, "Bring out some." He said, "Bring out my people. Bring everybody. Bring the animals. Bring it." Listen, the good anything you have, anything you love, anything that love you associated with you, bring it. Bring them to him in prayer. Take them to the Lord in prayer. Pray for their deliverance. Pray for their salvation tonight. Pray for them to be set free tonight, knowing that he who made the promise is able to deliver them tonight. [Music] [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; Moses had work to do. While he waited to bring them out, he had to be trained. while he waited to bring them out, he had to have the right attitude. &gt;&gt; No matter what distractions it had, Dayton, Koran, whoever else had their own thoughts and ideas. Those were just distractions. That was not to stop him from the promise of God. &gt;&gt; The promise of God was listen, take them out from here, bring them over here, and don't worry about it. I will take care of them. Moses should not have been surprised when he saw mountains on both sides. He should not have been surprised when he saw Pharaoh behind them because the promise was bring them from Egypt to this mountain to worship and God will see you through. I want to tell you God will see you through tonight. No matter what you've gone through in the past, he going to see you through. &gt;&gt; Till the promised land, &gt;&gt; till perfection, &gt;&gt; till adoption, &gt;&gt; till every promise is manifested in your life, &gt;&gt; he is going to see you through [Applause] [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; the 10 virgins. Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; We know the story. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Five were wise. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Five were foolish. &gt;&gt; Their mission was to wait on the bridegroom. &gt;&gt; They had to wait. &gt;&gt; But you know what? While they waiting, &gt;&gt; they had something to do. &gt;&gt; Just like you tonight. &gt;&gt; While you waiting on your healing, &gt;&gt; while you're waiting on your deliverance, while you're waiting on your children, while you're waiting on your condition to change, you have something to do. &gt;&gt; So the 10 virgins, &gt;&gt; they had something to do. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; They had two things actually. &gt;&gt; One thing they had to do was wait. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; The next thing they had to do was be ready. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; To be ready required that they had their lamps filled with oil. &gt;&gt; So waiting is one thing. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; It come like you're doing a test. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; When you enter the room, you get a mark for attendance. &gt;&gt; But you fail if you don't know the content to put on the paper. &gt;&gt; So you could wait all night. If when they come you don't have the requirements your car pass. &gt;&gt; Imagine you're taking a trip. You at the airport 6 hours before. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You're waiting. &gt;&gt; But when it's time to board, you do have a boarding pass. &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter if you waited 6 hours &gt;&gt; or if you was there the day before or if you came 5 minutes before. The requirement at that time is your boarding pass. &gt;&gt; They want your boarding pass to grant you access. So you have something to do. Whatever you do, secure your boarding pass. Secure your ticket because that's the thing to get you out of here. Secure the Holy Ghost because that's the thing to get you out of here. You could sing specials. You could be a deacon. You could do what you want. If you don't have the requirements, you're going nowhere. You're not going anywhere. [Music] [Applause] So these virgins now we know the story. &gt;&gt; A cry went out. &gt;&gt; They say behold the bridegroom cometh. &gt;&gt; The bridegroom wasn't there as yet &gt;&gt; because they all took a rest. &gt;&gt; They all slumbered and slept. They all waited. They all were faithful. They all were virgins. They all had lamps. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; But you know what? When the critical time came, &gt;&gt; when the thing that mattered, &gt;&gt; that's right, &gt;&gt; was at hand. &gt;&gt; Half of them had no oil. &gt;&gt; Half had no oil. &gt;&gt; No oil. &gt;&gt; So you come to clip your wick. You come to to to present present a nice facade, but you don't have the requirement. &gt;&gt; They had no choice at that point. &gt;&gt; No choice. It's not a brotherly kindness affair at that point. It's do you have it or do you not have it? &gt;&gt; Yes or no. It's binary. Zero or one. You have it yes or you don't have it. No. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the only thing. It's not what church you went to or if yours was early or just here on a Wednesday night. It's either you have the requirements or you don't have the requirements. Simple. &gt;&gt; Everybody can understand that. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So the wise virgins &gt;&gt; yes &gt;&gt; had not just the ability to wait &gt;&gt; the requirements. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now I want to strike something quickly. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We're familiar with the upper room experience. And it's interesting in the book of Luke that Jesus told the disciples and those around him. He say listen I love all of you but I want you to tar &gt;&gt; amen. in the city of Jerusalem. &gt;&gt; Essentially, I want you to wait. &gt;&gt; I sending you to wait. &gt;&gt; I'm calling you to wait. I'm not telling you when, &gt;&gt; but I want to assure you the comforter will come. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I want to make a commitment to a promise to you that the comforter will come &gt;&gt; and meet you there. &gt;&gt; Now, that is what I call the large print. &gt;&gt; Everybody heard that? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Everybody heard to wait. &gt;&gt; Amen. I want to release the fine print tonight. &gt;&gt; When you say go and tar, what may not have been explicitly clear is that listen, I want to give you a little time to sort out yourself. I want you to praise and worship. I want you to have the right attitude. I want you to forgive. I want you to love. I want you to share with your brother and sister. I I want you to get rid of that pride. I want you to sort out your ego. I want you to sort out your position and who folks see you as and who you think you are. I want you to sort out all that &gt;&gt; because the comforter is going to fall on perfection. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That is the fine print. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So t &gt;&gt; don't mean to just sit down in the corner and say well Jesus say sit down in Jerusalem so I cool. No he want you and do something. &gt;&gt; You have work to do. There is something required of us &gt;&gt; to sort out ourselves. To clean out our lives, &gt;&gt; to clean up our hearts, &gt;&gt; to clean up our attitude, to come in the right mindset, to come listen with a praise on your lips, &gt;&gt; worshiping God because he's good because he's good. &gt;&gt; Because you know he's going to do abundantly, exceedingly above all you could ask or think. So it doesn't matter how you feel tonight. It doesn't matter what you went through last night or on work today. He sent you to tar for a purpose and that purpose will be accomplished. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hear what the scripture said. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He said in the book of Acts, he said when the day of Pentecost was fully come fully come &gt;&gt; that was the time. That was the critical time. So it didn't matter if you was there the Sunday before, you know. All right. &gt;&gt; You might have been there every day, you know, but you decide by you see me I tired. I taking a day off. When the day of Pentecost will fully come. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Here what it says. They were all in one accord in one place. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know what I understand by that? If you and I in one accord and we agree and we are convinced about the same thing, listen, miracles could happen &gt;&gt; because at that point it's one faith, one Lord, one baptism. It's not my idea and I have a bigger revelation than you and you don't recognize who I am and how long I've been here and and and listen, I have a position and you don't know. is one mind, one accord, one faith, one Lord, one baptism at that point. So you know what? When the day of Pentecost fully come and you realize he don't have ego to deal with, he don't have pride to deal with anymore. He don't have to give you the brotherly kindness test because you could forgive. He could now come and everybody could be filled. &gt;&gt; Everybody could receive their portion because everybody sought the same perfection. Everybody sought to to clean up their lives and sort out themselves. [Applause] &gt;&gt; You see, I read in Ephesians 4. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He sent a five-fold ministry. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And we know it. Apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors, teachers. But why? For the &gt;&gt; perfecting of the saints. &gt;&gt; For the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ. &gt;&gt; So, it's not to just be there lingering eternally, you know. is for you to become perfect. That is why we come to church. That is why we read the word. That is why we subscribe to the message because we know we are imperfect as we stand. &gt;&gt; But we want to be more like Christ. &gt;&gt; We want to be drawn closer to him. &gt;&gt; So he sent these ministries to be able to perfect us &gt;&gt; to draw us closer &gt;&gt; for the for the perfecting of the saints. &gt;&gt; Not the perfecting of just you. for all of us &gt;&gt; for the saints everywhere &gt;&gt; to be perfect. So why why you think that is so he want to perfect the saints. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It sound very much like going into the upper room. &gt;&gt; It mean you need to sort out yourself. It's not my church versus your your church. It's not my doctrine versus yours. It's not my revelation versus yours. It's not my idea or my belief versus yours. &gt;&gt; For the perfecting of the saints. So it means he has a requirement like Joseph for us to be perfect. He want to be able to look and say, "Hey, this is my beloved son here." You know, &gt;&gt; watch him. He just like me. He could sign the check. He operates the way I operate. I don't have to second guess and question because he is a chip off the whole block. &gt;&gt; He and I listen that is almost the same you're looking at. That is my representative man and woman who are king. Listen, Jesus Christ on two feet again. That is what you're looking for. So he sent the five-fold ministry to do just that. &gt;&gt; Listen, I can't help but think, &gt;&gt; hallelujah, &gt;&gt; brother Brandham would say, he say sometimes he'll go in the woods to pray and no matter how difficult it comes as he pray and he's seeking the will of God. He said that's the time when the briars will scratch him, the birds interfering with him, the mosquitoes coming to bite him. He say listen that is when he saw the breakthrough coming. That is the time to be certain of God. &gt;&gt; That is the time to be sure beyond a reasonable doubt that it's about to happen. &gt;&gt; As a matter of fact, they say the darkest hour is before the break of day. &gt;&gt; Just before the sun comes out and shines is the darkest hour of the night. &gt;&gt; So you tell me you've been going through a rough time. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You say you have had it hard for a long time. Well, guess what? Keep fighting &gt;&gt; because the fact that you're going through the trials now mean listen victory is just ahead. You know victory is right is the next corner. This is not the time to give up. This is not the time to slow down. Like Abraham 20 years 21 22 23. The longer it go the greater the victory, the greater the sacrifice, the greater the success. So don't despair now. This is not the time to lose your cool and why I waiting this long. You know how long I see this one get healed. You know how long I see this one get the victory. And I see this one get a breakthrough. Listen. Your time coming. &gt;&gt; Your time coming. But you go through different tests. Some through the water, some through the fire. All through the blood tonight. So it doesn't matter. You have to have the right attitude. You have to have the right approach. You have to testify. You have to walk knowing, believing, in faith that he is going to see you through. [Applause] &gt;&gt; You see, he wants a perfect bride. &gt;&gt; He listen, it's not a rag tag team you're trying to put put together. You know, &gt;&gt; listen, when he chose disciples, Jesus called Peter, come. James, Andrew, John, here what? Will you come? But when he got them together, he didn't leave them the way they were. You know, he wor three and a half years. They walking with him. They came with different skill sets, different mindsets, different strengths, different weaknesses. And he had to deal with them all. &gt;&gt; Different attitudes, different backgrounds &gt;&gt; and he had to deal with them all. So you feel God don't understand you. &gt;&gt; He don't know what he doing. He don't see you different from your brother. He don't understand that the trial he give you is customized to you because he know the challenges he have with you. He know what he have to break off for you is not what you have to break off of somebody else. &gt;&gt; And that was the challenge he had with the disciples. But guess what? He didn't come for bride material. Material is material. He come for the bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He didn't come for a church or no. He come for you. &gt;&gt; But he can't take you as you are. &gt;&gt; He can't take you the way you are and leave you the way you are. Come on. &gt;&gt; He want to make you fit his mold. You see that mold there? &gt;&gt; He want you fit that. &gt;&gt; So he want you add to your faith virtue &gt;&gt; and knowledge and temperance, patience, godliness, brotherly kindness. So charity could drop down. Listen, on perfection, &gt;&gt; not you with your arts and you with your greed and you with your jealousy and envy. No, it wouldn't work. &gt;&gt; The dove can't land on that. The dove could only land on the lamb. &gt;&gt; They could only land on perfection. &gt;&gt; And he is determined that he would have a bride like Eve. He determined that in this end time, in this evil age, he coming for a bride that call out, that's perfect, that could hold on to his promises, that knows his word, and could stand on it and beat the devil anytime, anywhere, under any condition. &gt;&gt; Amen. The music musicians could get get ready. &gt;&gt; As we wind down, &gt;&gt; I just want to read one more quote as we close &gt;&gt; in a message be certain of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Paragraph 45. &gt;&gt; Here's what he says. He said, "Wait." When you met his requirement, &gt;&gt; that brings your faith to a showdown. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, you're not just waiting. When you met his requirement, sir, &gt;&gt; you still had to go through the test. &gt;&gt; There's a showdown. It's like you're in school. Listen, you might be in form one or form five. It doesn't matter. There's a test sometime coming. You know it coming. You may not know the date exactly, but you know the test is coming at some point. So, you have work to do during the period. What you have to do is go to class, read the books, learn what you need to learn because you know when the test comes, you want to pass the test. &gt;&gt; If you don't pass the test, guess what? You need to repeat &gt;&gt; and do it again. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Different test, customized test, same test. It doesn't matter. You have to go through the test again. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That is the way it works. So think about it. You have the books and tapes. &gt;&gt; You have the Bible. &gt;&gt; You have the promises. &gt;&gt; You have the messages. You have the sermons. The test coming. I can't tell you the date. I don't know it. &gt;&gt; As a matter of fact, nobody knows the date. &gt;&gt; Nobody knows the hour, but the test coming still. And here he said, "Wait, when you met his requirement, that brings your faith to a showdown." &gt;&gt; Amen. If you have met God's requirement, if the requirement has been made and you have fully considered it and you have done everything that God required you to do, then your faith rest right there &gt;&gt; that he is be certain of God. You know, he loves to test us. &gt;&gt; He loves to see the reaction of your faith. &gt;&gt; This is why you have to put in the work. The test coming, &gt;&gt; ready or not, the test coming, &gt;&gt; war coming, the battle coming, the fight coming, ready or not. So you have to make sure your faith is in order &gt;&gt; because he loves to test us. And he loves to see the reaction of your faith. Did you know that God likes to see how you react when you say, "Oh Lord, I believe you. Thou art my savior. I believe you are the healer. I believe you are the one who gives the Holy Spirit. and the things that I am requiring, you are the God who gives that. And then when you confess all your sins and promise God that you'll do if he let you get well and then because it don't happen, you run like a coward somewhere. &gt;&gt; When you don't see it happen fast enough, &gt;&gt; when you don't see the result you want tomorrow, &gt;&gt; you run like a coward. Oh gosh, I wonder if this thing right boy because I holding on for three days. He say he like to to test you know. So so what is that next week? Where's that next month? &gt;&gt; What is that next year? &gt;&gt; This is listen this is the word of reading. You know &gt;&gt; this is the words of the prophet. I'm not making it up. &gt;&gt; He said listen you'll run off like a coward somewhere. God can't use that. &gt;&gt; There's no way for him to use you. There's no way for him to answer you because he only answers by faith. &gt;&gt; Then all of a sudden you go away and he can't answer. But real true faith stands there. &gt;&gt; Go play something softly. Being sure that God is be certain that he is. And if God asked this thing to be done to confess your sins and so forth and you've done it, faith says that he is. It's certain that it's going to happen. &gt;&gt; So the same promise you believe. No matter what happens, it's going to happen because he promised it. I didn't make the promise to you. The pastor didn't make the promise to you. God made a promise. So he is going to fulfill it. Amen. &gt;&gt; It says it's certain that it's going to happen. Your request has to be granted. It's not optional at that stage. It has to be granted. Your loved ones have to be saved. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Your sons and daughters have to be delivered. &gt;&gt; It has to be granted once you have the faith and you met his requirements. He said if you are sure of God, God is sure of his word. He's only waiting to test you. God bless you. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Bless you, brother Gideon. Amen. Amen. Amen.
