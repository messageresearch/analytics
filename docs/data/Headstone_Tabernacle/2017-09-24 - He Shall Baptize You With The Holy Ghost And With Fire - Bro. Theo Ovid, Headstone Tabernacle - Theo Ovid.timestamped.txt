[33:20] person's name of Jesus read in Isaiah 6
[33:23] verse 1 in the year that King Uzziah
[33:26] died I saw also the Lord sitting upon a
[33:29] throne high and lifted up and his train
[33:33] filled the temple above it stood the
[33:37] Seraphim each one at six wings with
[33:39] twain he covered his face with twenty
[33:42] covered his feet with trained
[33:44] he did fly and one cried unto another
[33:46] and said holy holy holy is a Lord of
[33:49] hosts the whole earth is full of his
[33:51] glory and the posts of the door moved at
[33:55] the voice of him that cried and the
[33:58] house was filled with smoke
[34:00] then said I Boris me farm undone because
[34:04] I am a man of unclean lips and I dwell
[34:07] in the midst of a people of unclean lips
[34:10] for mine eyes have seen the king the
[34:13] Lord of hosts then flew one of the
[34:16] seraphim's unto me having a live coal in
[34:19] his hand which he had taken with the
[34:22] tongues from off the altar and he laid
[34:26] it upon my mouth and said lo this had
[34:29] touched my lips and I an iniquity is
[34:32] taken away and I sin purged also I heard
[34:38] a voice of the Lord said whom shall I
[34:41] send
[34:41] who will go for us then said I here am I
[34:46] send me
[34:49] from looped up to tree one verse verse
[34:52] 16
[34:59] John answered saying unto them all I
[35:02] indeed baptize you with water but one
[35:06] mightier than I comment the latchet of
[35:10] whose shoes I am not worthy to unloose
[35:13] he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost
[35:16] and with fire may God bless his word you
[35:20] may be seated
[35:21] oh praise the name of the Lord well
[35:24] greetings from the Brethren in Guyana we
[35:27] had a tremendous time in Guyana for a
[35:31] gorge kindly and with a pterence of it
[35:34] but he Williams and myself we had our L
[35:37] less time cost and Guyana passes and
[35:41] greetings also I heard from but Isaac
[35:43] praise the Lord a night and you from by
[35:49] Isaac this morning and they have a
[35:50] tremendous time going on in South Africa
[35:52] they're speaking about four hundred
[35:54] people but five hundred showed up so he
[35:58] has one more service and badly that
[35:59] would say was going on right now but had
[36:01] a tremendous time this morning and he
[36:03] said that he didn't even have to make
[36:05] our water Corp he was heading towards
[36:06] the altar so I know the Lord is working
[36:09] mightily and we just stand board for
[36:11] that
[36:15] so this morning I have something upon my
[36:18] heart and this service
[36:22] our next service gonna be special
[36:24] services and we look to see what the
[36:27] Lord will do among us our title this
[36:31] morning the title is on the script we
[36:33] read in Luke 316 title is he shall
[36:37] baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with
[36:41] fire he that's your promise he shall
[36:47] baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with
[36:51] fire a nerve an inspiration cleansing
[36:55] fire fire from the altar as my special
[37:00] cleansing fire fire from the altar so I
[37:04] am not expecting this to be the regular
[37:07] bit of things I'm looking for the fire
[37:12] of God amen that cleansing fire of God
[37:16] that is what is promised but Isaac he
[37:21] were a powerful inspiration last Sunday
[37:24] but God in your heart and have you
[37:26] received the Holy Ghost since you
[37:28] believed and you should guard your heart
[37:30] so powerful thought that your heart all
[37:34] it could do is reproduce the seed sown
[37:36] on it that's all it does you put an evil
[37:40] see there it produced after it's time
[37:42] you put jealousy inside of it it just
[37:44] produces whatever you put the choice is
[37:47] yours
[37:48] that's where it come down to your will
[37:49] your desire your choices are so what
[37:52] goes in your heart and even Jesus said
[37:56] be careful how you hear free is good a
[37:59] lot of people either hear everything
[38:01] confusion all that stuff but you want to
[38:04] hear the right thing
[38:05] because you want to guard your heart to
[38:08] get the right seats in your spirit in
[38:10] your mind in your soul amen
[38:14] that's why the Bible said will receive
[38:16] an acquisition against and held up
[38:18] accept you of two or three witnesses
[38:20] because they will receive it it goes
[38:22] right into your heart and then you get
[38:24] an attitude towards this one on that one
[38:26] you receive a gossip it comes into your
[38:29] heart and then you're negative to what
[38:31] somebody that that didn't do nothing but
[38:33] you don't know why I don't like them why
[38:34] against them but something struck inside
[38:36] your heart so you have to guard your
[38:39] heart it is serious
[38:41] amen it is very very serious I've see
[38:45] people on track and they go off track
[38:47] because of what they receive in their
[38:49] heart oh praise the name of the Lord
[38:52] so he is very important what happens in
[38:55] this thing called the heart not so much
[38:58] the head you know the Hat is the real
[39:00] you oh praise the name of the Lord the
[39:03] head could sweet this way that way
[39:05] because somebody see this and see that
[39:07] and you're you're sweet but really deep
[39:09] none is what's inside of here
[39:11] isn't that right and that strange enough
[39:14] the first parable Jesus give was the
[39:17] parable of the sower and the seed he

[46:14] is not one an old man from somewhere we
[46:21] may be seasoned that great one that
[46:24] veteran came to introduce because he
[46:26] came in the spirit of Elijah to
[46:28] introduce the Messiah that great one is
[46:31] a mighty one of Revelation 10 I saw
[46:34] another mighty angel come down from
[46:36] heaven Lord with a clown that was Jesus
[46:40] Christ he came to introduce Christ you
[46:43] have to stop a see Jesus like a church
[46:45] and as a church you have to start to see
[46:48] Jesus and if you start to see Jesus give
[46:50] it a walk different giving a talk
[46:52] different living on us and Jesus come to
[46:55] be with you because you are his wife
[46:57] become to walk with you become the
[47:00] taught me to become to live with you
[47:02] become to step into your sixteen
[47:04] elements
[47:05] [Applause]
[47:08] hallelujah we believe that this morning
[47:11] Oh hallelujah so the last that was
[47:14] preached in here I was talking about the
[47:16] three realms humanistic realm divine
[47:19] revelation and vision majority people
[47:23] live in the humanistic ground that the
[47:25] realm and your feelings get hurt
[47:27] this one upset here and you got problems
[47:28] and I get fined about that your humanism
[47:31] that's nothing to do with divine
[47:34] revelation of God isn't that right
[47:39] so when John come John nothing after I'm
[47:42] at all in a remote divine revelation and
[47:44] vision so he come out of the wilderness
[47:47] and blasts and left right I said like a
[47:49] man when I kept playing on could shoot
[47:51] and everything in sight and say listen
[47:53] somebody's coming I got the clay away
[47:55] for this man and he when Jesus came on
[47:58] the scene we know the story he says
[47:59] behold the lamb of God and that that
[48:04] word behold the lamb of God it changed
[48:07] from the prophet to the prophecy this is
[48:12] where a lot of people miss it they miss
[48:14] the transitioning from the Prophet to
[48:17] the prophecy so they can't handle us
[48:21] because we are in the prophecy of the
[48:23] prophet and the wonders the same profit
[48:26] profit profit profit profit but the
[48:28] perfect what a prophecy and when you
[48:31] step into your prophecy you step into
[48:33] your position you step into your calling
[48:36] you stop into your anointing you step
[48:39] into your fate but you step into your
[48:42] hallelujah is not what the Prophet did
[48:46] so much but it's what the prophesy will
[48:48] be for example the Bible said with
[48:52] stammering lips and another tongue and
[48:54] speak to his people and with the
[48:56] prophecy Jesus never stagger Jesus never
[48:59] do this and do that no but when they
[49:01] went in the upper room that happened and
[49:03] they said this is that that the Prophet
[49:06] spoke so you have to watch what the
[49:08] Prophet spoke because he have his word
[49:11] to fulfill what sort of you
[49:13] you want your work to fulfill and you
[49:16] have to find your scriptures William
[49:18] Branham at the fight Malachi for William
[49:21] Branham at the fight lead 7:30 William
[49:24] Branham at the fire revolution 10 7 you
[49:26] have to find your scripture even Jesus
[49:29] went into the temple and find a
[49:30] scripture for Isaiah 60:1 a set of
[49:33] spirited upon me he had to find that
[49:35] structure to identify his state to
[49:37] identify his time to identify his
[49:41] message you and I have to be seen we are
[49:44] not from Rita's age we are having a
[49:47] horse-and-buggy age we are in this age

[1:01:32] notice Cain and Abel both boys come up
[1:01:35] to the gate to worship it must have been
[1:01:38] God's altar before this altar they built
[1:01:41] a substitute Jerry another altar but is
[1:01:44] the true author of God and it is in the
[1:01:46] heart of man you talk about a man who
[1:01:49] when different churches what not about
[1:01:50] four different five or this man was a
[1:01:52] diplomat to the presidents of four or
[1:01:53] five different presidents he said
[1:01:55] brother Branham one night I come to a
[1:01:56] meeting and I didn't know what to do he
[1:01:59] said I still owed him I said oh I love
[1:02:01] the Lord all my life I've think about
[1:02:04] s-phase up an Essbase pool opium
[1:02:08] and I thought I know the Lord and one
[1:02:10] night I look around I didn't know what
[1:02:12] to do and I wouldn't go in for nothing I
[1:02:14] heard the wood coming forth and it began
[1:02:17] to come I began to walk up and down on
[1:02:20] the outside of the tent walking back and
[1:02:22] forth and said directly I couldn't wait
[1:02:26] to get to the door i crawl under it the
[1:02:29] tent when the altar call was mean and
[1:02:31] run to the altar and fell down and said
[1:02:35] Lord I am a sinner and then he filled me
[1:02:40] with His Holy Spirit big diplomatic word
[1:02:45] okay on the 10t speaking to him and then
[1:02:48] when he couldn't hold Chuck on the tent
[1:02:51] and come check the altar
[1:02:52] say Lord I am ah ah I'm going filling
[1:02:58] that sinner
[1:02:59] I want to sit that inside of there what
[1:03:02] he'll back sinner I want to say that I
[1:03:06] hope it reach somebody God fill that
[1:03:09] sinner with the Holy Ghost
[1:03:11] water still fill sinners Oh glory of God
[1:03:16] you could keep your goody two-shoes but
[1:03:19] God the stencil sinners but you have to
[1:03:23] recognize your condition and when I got
[1:03:27] caught up in the presence of God
[1:03:29] my vision saw the Lord High and lifted
[1:03:32] up when that heaven is a war with me
[1:03:35] he don't want nobody else here cussing
[1:03:38] his neighbor here arguing some elders on
[1:03:40] pasta he had questioning some deacon he
[1:03:43] come into the presence of God and when
[1:03:45] you come in a prison or Deborah the
[1:03:47] questions you only recognize your
[1:03:50] condition you can't recognize somebody
[1:03:52] else who I hear with this enough
[1:04:01] or given glory people hallelujah praise
[1:04:06] God praise God praise God
[1:04:08] so this sinner went to the altar and God
[1:04:11] filament Holy Spirit the angel regarded
[1:04:14] them with cherubims notice another
[1:04:16] evidence was bringing here Cain went out
[1:04:19] from the presence of the Lord from the
[1:04:23] gate of the gun virus agreement or from
[1:04:26] the presence so he said then the

[1:43:17] worship God
[1:43:18] I'm blessed God and priests gone
[1:43:21] hallelujah sometimes in making decisions
[1:43:24] you can based on yeah you go when you
[1:43:26] base that you say you know no like
[1:43:29] there's a statement there's no lost
[1:43:30] opportunities you know somewhat up
[1:43:32] wasn't think it you lost it
[1:43:35] I know really lost opportunity somebody
[1:43:37] just take that already Anna so if I had
[1:43:39] be lead and hum and haw and whatnot
[1:43:41] people test back of that plane and going
[1:43:42] and out of it but you have to press on
[1:43:44] that's why you can do all that you could
[1:43:47] do when you can do it for the kingdom of
[1:43:49] God could we take them all
[1:43:51] what if is it more the more the whole
[1:43:54] holidays a the rest like the priesthood
[1:43:56] explores a button on your seatbelt
[1:43:59] come for a ride this smile and accordion
[1:44:04] you are not gonna be cause I'll be four
[1:44:06] six them
[1:44:11] all right well praise God so to self
[1:44:14] will you come in there I'm Julia comes
[1:44:16] up what the Shekinah glory what is she
[1:44:18] gonna glory is God's presence when a man
[1:44:21] is walking a woman is reflect Elisha
[1:44:23] category he warn't going to down
[1:44:25] gambling dens and carry on it won't go
[1:44:28] to 9 in the world he's got his heart set
[1:44:29] on fire
[1:44:30] so that's what a prophet said when you
[1:44:33] receive the Spirit of God when a man
[1:44:35] gets seed he said the light that comes
[1:44:38] into him is about a little like a little
[1:44:41] white button on my shirt that is when
[1:44:43] God comes into the inner part of man
[1:44:46] into that heart and as you surrender
[1:44:50] more that light expands so it's not the
[1:44:53] other side more light you have to be
[1:44:55] able to make room for that light to grow
[1:44:59] into your life into your actions and
[1:45:02] attitude and your pian until you are
[1:45:05] controlled by the power of that light
[1:45:08] within you your flesh subjects ourselves
[1:45:10] to the light of the holy spirit isn't
[1:45:13] that right
[1:45:14] then God's coming to the heart which is
[1:45:16] the spirit and then and then and see a
[1:45:19] little white button starts in his heart
[1:45:20] when he's born again
[1:45:22] God's Spirit dwells in him and he can
[1:45:24] let that spirit grow here we go and take
[1:45:27] all all the root of bitterness and press
[1:45:29] gorge way back again and he can come
[1:45:32] back in the same condition he was when
[1:45:35] he was in the Garden of Eden and brother
[1:45:37] Branham demonstrated that because his
[1:45:40] life took him right back to the Garden
[1:45:43] of Eden that he gets a little fishy I
[1:45:45] give you back your life son come on
[1:45:48] sunshine for days he was demonstrating
[1:45:51] this power that Adam had that Jesus had
[1:45:55] is now on the edge has been restored
[1:45:57] more than that the book or the deed or
[1:46:01] the title that Adam had is not only it
[1:46:03] and in God I came across so simple this
[1:46:06] whole Bible is about the story of an
[1:46:09] inheritance as God has left
[1:46:10] it's a D that was wrapped with seven
[1:46:13] seals around it and he come to reveal
[1:46:15] this thing to bring back what it had
[1:46:17] before so Adam had this book or this
[1:46:20] deed or this title and he lost it so it
[1:46:23] went back to the hands of God all God
[1:46:25] has done to the ages is bring his book
[1:46:27] back that when his book is back the Paul
[1:46:29] is back the anointing is back eveness
[1:46:32] back the sons of God are back that's a
[1:46:35] story entire Bible this word to mean if
[1:46:38] such inside of you
[1:46:39] it's the complicated it is simple God
[1:46:43] wanted to reveal himself he was just too
[1:46:46] mysterious so he released Jesus Christ
[1:46:48] which is the mystery of God revealed I
[1:46:51] know you will be the mystery of Christ
[1:46:53] revealed or get a lot some praises
[1:46:56] people so as Jesus unveiled God you will
[1:47:00] unveil Jesus okay the Lord a shout ho
[1:47:04] let me see that right now how many
[1:47:06] understand so then he said take the
[1:47:09] blood of mine out and you're putting the
[1:47:11] blood of Jesus and that brings the face
[1:47:13] of Jesus the filter of Jesus so put on a
[1:47:16] scene and one day go gonna put you on
[1:47:17] his theater
[1:47:18] put any operation theater and there be a
[1:47:20] blood transfusion your blood will come
[1:47:22] out Jesus blood coming in and you're
[1:47:25] gonna live like Jesus
[1:47:26] you're gonna walk like Jesus you're
[1:47:27] gonna talk like Jesus you can act like
[1:47:29] Jesus it will be just like Jesus there
[1:47:31] will be breast of his flesh and bone of
[1:47:33] his bone
[1:47:34] [Applause]
[1:47:42] - oh man
[1:47:45] let's go from future home but the
[1:47:49] Branham says that nor they baptize it
[1:47:52] with water then Jesus blood can be
[1:47:54] sanctified to clear it and Satan came to
[1:47:57] try to tie up Jesus that Jesus will get
[1:48:01] back the earth without purchasing it
[1:48:03] with the death of the cross with the
[1:48:05] blood but watch the earth is to get a
[1:48:08] baptism of fire and God come to sanctify
[1:48:12] the church with the fire of God the
[1:48:15] bernal all the filth and common dwell in
[1:48:17] the human heart that filth and so on is
[1:48:20] in the human heart line adultery
[1:48:22] fornication is in the heart back there
[1:48:24] that's coming from so the fire comes to
[1:48:26] pulling that off but take a firebomb and
[1:48:29] church inside your heart and that
[1:48:31] explodes and blow up everything else and
[1:48:34] then he steps inside of there and sit
[1:48:37] down on your chair and the altar of your
[1:48:40] heart or get a lot some praises people
[1:48:46] so let me say it plainly he will be sees
[1:48:48] it when you're born you're born with mr.

[1:48:54] sin shape iniquity nice baby nice child

[1:51:52] sickness it is a burn the sinners the
[1:51:54] devil's is far from God and hear what
[1:51:57] the bomb that he says this program of
[1:52:00] redemption is not only to redeem the
[1:52:03] world we were living but redeemed the
[1:52:05] people who's going to live give the go
[1:52:09] through the same process people didn't
[1:52:11] know I just had a day and no water
[1:52:13] flooded but what I don't understand it
[1:52:15] was baptized with water to justify the
[1:52:18] earth
[1:52:18] so when nobody came God was on this way
[1:52:21] to redeem the earth so that was the
[1:52:23] first stage you get justified when you
[1:52:25] get baptized in water that's the first
[1:52:28] program then the blood of Jesus telling
[1:52:30] the earth to survive yet I'm coming back
[1:52:34] to fire then the Bible said I recently
[1:52:37] Liza before that terrible dreadful day
[1:52:41] of the Lord so the Prophet Malachi was
[1:52:44] saying fire coming but before that fire
[1:52:47] I'm gonna send prophet the call you are
[1:52:55] are you a new human be season and for
[1:52:58] any profit call you out
[1:52:59] you have to redeem the same way water
[1:53:02] blood and now John says he gonna baptize
[1:53:07] you with the Holy Ghost hundred fire so
[1:53:12] your fire coming he'll tell somebody
[1:53:15] it's coming tell somebody a suit
[1:53:21] [Applause]
[1:53:31] [Applause]
[1:53:43] it's common with it
[1:53:47] don't backside no don't give up don't
[1:53:51] let go with me
[1:53:51] [Applause]
[1:53:52] [Music]
[1:53:53] [Applause]
[1:54:02] let me read this here for you know what
[1:54:05] is shot by this morning and prayer
[1:54:06] struck me and this is where he and the
[1:54:11] bread becomes one and they go to the
[1:54:13] home in the new world and the same plan
[1:54:16] of redemption is used to redeem both the
[1:54:20] world and the person that lives in it
[1:54:22] now this is the part see the heart has
[1:54:27] to be cleanse like that before God can
[1:54:31] come down in the prison of the Holy
[1:54:34] Ghost which is Christ coming down to
[1:54:37] dwell in the human heart so this is the
[1:54:40] part the heart have to be cleansed like
[1:54:43] that not wash with the book I know what
[1:54:47] the prophecy and you want to argue and
[1:54:49] debate and question we're not talking
[1:54:52] about that we talked about this after
[1:54:54] the cleanse like that it's a way it has
[1:54:57] to be cleansed which is the fire this is
[1:55:01] what the churches don't want to preach
[1:55:02] because this is not the operation of man
[1:55:06] because man can bring fire it's fire of
[1:55:09] the altar God's altar is gathered Oh
[1:55:15] hallelujah Oh glory of God so we wanna
[1:55:19] go a little deeper this morning
[1:55:21] hallelujah to get that fire it's guarded
[1:55:25] most animals are just go and get it like
[1:55:27] that
[1:55:28] hallelujah this is elected have to come
[1:55:31] and get this fire this fire is for you
[1:55:34] when I took this bomb and the Old
[1:55:37] Testament was get to go in Noah's debt
[1:55:39] to steal
[1:55:41] [Music]
[1:55:43] is depth as the Autobots presence you
[1:55:47] want God's presence at the table on the
[1:55:50] job in the street a little eyes that say
[1:55:53] you don't want a part-time thing there's
[1:55:55] a full-time Christian there's a
[1:55:59] full-time job so the harder it becomes
[1:56:05] like that before God can come along and
[1:56:07] a person of the Holy Ghost which is
[1:56:09] Christ coming down and dwell in the
[1:56:11] human heart it first must be baptized in
[1:56:13] water to show it belongs to it will be
[1:56:16] cleansed by the blood of Jesus and then
[1:56:18] holy fire and Holy Ghost from God comes
[1:56:23] down and burns out all the desire of sin
[1:56:25] and all the needs of the world years ago
[1:56:27] I met a sister from another Church and
[1:56:29] talking and you know economy member
[1:56:34] mention about the Holy Ghost and so on
[1:56:35] but her testimony was I guess oh she's
[1:56:38] taught she said I'm Mary said be it done
[1:56:41] unto me according to thy wit and Mary
[1:56:45] conceived and performs Jesus say all
[1:56:48] right I say but then I see that say Mary
[1:56:51] went up in the upper room and she had
[1:56:55] was to get the fire then it says that
[1:56:57] she never see it so you see that's how
[1:56:59] she was taught she thought it done in
[1:57:02] Hollywood and finally concerned the
[1:57:03] hearing would read he would be willing
[1:57:05] them I was not a secret sister you need
[1:57:06] fire on that so if you don't know any
[1:57:10] fire not you would not purify not when
[1:57:12] you leave here you say no fire when you
[1:57:15] print you don't wanna normal crap good
[1:57:18] morning Lord in Jesus name Amen
[1:57:19] look over men work today lord thank you
[1:57:21] lord remember that no fire
[1:57:24] that's no altar thing whenever others
[1:57:26] call I'm bleeding all today they're
[1:57:29] looking for God to come down you after I
[1:57:31] feel listen I feel like 25a Jacob and
[1:57:34] Abraham and all these guys are then
[1:57:36] build physical altar
[1:57:41] you have the opportunity to call upon
[1:57:43] your God and let that sire come sup to
[1:57:47] see the fire in the field of anointing
[1:57:50] coming up as I begin to pray you're
[1:57:52] feeling your northern you know I was
[1:57:54] your pray until you come on come on oh
[1:57:57] not just say words I can hear your plan
[1:58:01] until you get you then you're moving in
[1:58:06] the presence you're moving into fire
[1:58:09] Oh glory to God amen so whatever I'm
[1:58:13] says the gospel was in that day's
[1:58:14] written in the world as history a
[1:58:16] painted fire what what was except the
[1:58:19] same see that they accept and it will
[1:58:21] become a living reality to you because
[1:58:24] it will bring you into the same
[1:58:26] experience that they had the same world
[1:58:28] why because the hot agar Isaac said is
[1:58:31] is ordained to produce whatever is shown
[1:58:33] inside of it so if you take the same
[1:58:35] seat Peter had and put it in your heart
[1:58:37] it must have the same results you must
[1:58:39] produce Christ it must produce that same
[1:58:41] condition isn't that right so the gospel
[1:58:44] video is not all together at the word
[1:58:46] this is the Word of God and all things
[1:58:49] must be based upon this world isn't that
[1:58:52] right but jesus said going to all over
[1:58:54] land preacher comes with every creature
[1:58:56] he did not say teach the word he said
[1:58:59] preach the gospel so the gospel consists
[1:59:03] more than teaching the word so many
[1:59:05] people locked in a mystery and the is
[1:59:07] itchin and this began a revelation boy
[1:59:09] and they have notes in writing and I
[1:59:11] never feel good at home I'm head hot and
[1:59:14] high that is not the gospel the Gospels
[1:59:20] when them same notes them saying word
[1:59:22] that is taught turn into fire turn into
[1:59:25] power that's why Paul said I didn't come
[1:59:28] back enticing words of man's wisdom but
[1:59:31] I come in power and demonstration of the
[1:59:34] spirit that to fit my rest not in land
[1:59:37] but in the power of God
[1:59:41] why would poor Sarah because if the man
[1:59:45] bring all these nice teachings and about
[1:59:48] who never had so greatest each alert
[1:59:50] then you're fitted in the man but if you
[1:59:54] begin to see the power the recognizing
[1:59:56] man is just a part of it alone one soul
[1:59:58] one water but God gave the increase
[2:00:00] God is the power master or somebody give
[2:00:06] a shout so the gospel is more than just
[2:00:10] word but demonstration of the Holy
[2:00:13] Spirit would come and demonstrate the
[2:00:15] gospel to bring the word to a living
[2:00:18] reality Superman will preach and
[2:00:21] afterwards he will say you know what I'm
[2:00:22] waiting on I'm waiting on the image of
[2:00:24] the Lord then say he is here what is he
[2:00:26] talking about
[2:00:27] I'm not about to demonstrate the gospel
[2:00:28] because the baddest of the Lord Himself
[2:00:30] went everywhere with them confirming the
[2:00:34] word with signs following so those guys
[2:00:38] render preach there was a consummation
[2:00:40] there was a backup
[2:00:45] the happiest when parabrahman resentment
[2:00:49] call somebody up and they take too long
[2:00:50] to respond he said up one just miss a
[2:00:52] healin imagine dynamics is there power
[2:00:57] is there AngelList air-cool is princess
[2:00:59] there and somebody like a dumb dog
[2:01:00] watchin say woman you have so and so and
[2:01:04] so and she she says just mr. heelas
[2:01:09] because she didn't respond God called
[2:01:11] you all can you every spun nothing for
[2:01:13] you you supposing for a man that's mines
[2:01:15] even hallelujah glory that's all you're
[2:01:19] supposed to be here hallelujah so email
[2:01:23] means so be it I let so be it to me I'm
[2:01:27] saying a man I'm a man I see remember
[2:01:30] somebody has eyes - I seen this Buddhist
[2:01:32] - this blessing this man's this power is
[2:01:35] much I say it man
[2:01:37] and the for peace a in hand and this one
[2:01:40] says hallelujah dispensatory
[2:01:41] hallelujah praise God right now the
[2:01:43] wings are flapping the saris want a
[2:01:46] mission to fire the saris want to move
[2:01:51] in the Spelman
[2:01:53] trying button 40 with fire but calls
[2:01:58] from of the altar of God
[2:02:01] [Applause]
[2:02:06] but Aparna then you must be born again
[2:02:08] and then the Holy Spirit quickens the
[2:02:10] word to you in other words like a grain
[2:02:12] of corn if it's lain in my hand is just
[2:02:14] a grain of corn but if I bury it it
[2:02:17] become contaminated moles and then bring
[2:02:19] up another greener corn just like it so
[2:02:22] but around said the gospel came to us
[2:02:23] not a word only but to the power and
[2:02:25] demonstration of the Holy Ghost then
[2:02:27] jesus said go into all the world and
[2:02:29] preach the gospel to every creature
[2:02:31] then he meant going to all the world and
[2:02:34] demonstrate the power of God to every
[2:02:37] creature and in order to preach the
[2:02:39] gospel you can make it a gospel preached
[2:02:42] then you've got to have the power that
[2:02:44] demonstrate the holy spirit to prove the
[2:02:47] gospel the letter killeth but the spirit
[2:02:49] giveth life so this is not a ritualistic
[2:02:52] of fear it is absolutely a real living
[2:02:56] reality of the resurrection of Jesus
[2:02:58] Christ living among men and that's the
[2:03:01] fate that I'm trying my best to contend
[2:03:03] for today that Jesus Christ listen is
[2:03:06] the same yesterday today and forever and
[2:03:08] his power is unlimited that means that
[2:03:14] means that means missing limbs to be

[2:15:19] scream and the tears running down and
[2:15:23] painted cheeks like that directly when
[2:15:26] she raised up them big brown eyes looked
[2:15:29] at me and said brother branham something
[2:15:30] happened I said yes sir yes sir she is
[2:15:35] married she's got she owe four children
[2:15:38] now what was it she took God and steered
[2:15:42] with it until something happened
[2:15:46] something taking place the living world
[2:15:50] became a living reality to her or give
[2:15:55] the Lord some praises you love that

[2:16:14] something happened
[2:16:16] Oh glory to God God completely
[2:16:18] revolutionize and change my life so when
[2:16:21] God plans has promised in you and it
[2:16:23] becomes a living reality then something
[2:16:26] is different you just don't go and say
[2:16:28] yes I believe it that's all right that
[2:16:29] definite leave it like that but it's
[2:16:31] confirmed to you the wood becomes our
[2:16:33] life you then you begin to see what it
[2:16:35] is
[2:16:36] God has always feel himself behind
[2:16:38] something so the people that also world
[2:16:40] will not know nothing about him but he
[2:16:42] reveals himself there's children and to
[2:16:44] those who are willing to come from
[2:16:45] behind that feel isn't that right praise
[2:16:49] God
[2:16:50] so quad was veiled in that batchest
[2:16:51] batchest skin behind human skin his
[2:16:54] dearest whether she kind of glorious his
[2:16:56] days when the wood is here when I want
[2:16:58] to get you know but a Branham said is
[2:17:00] here Ephesus means relaxed the high
[2:17:04] aspiration have a compound means calm
[2:17:06] permanent mean a man of relax the high
[2:17:09] aspiration of this age that have been
[2:17:11] fought with had the fullness of the
[2:17:12] spirit the depth of God they begin to
[2:17:15] give way to a less watchful attitude
[2:17:18] unless odd and fallen of Jesus Christ
[2:17:21] begin the manifest itself as an omen in
[2:17:23] the future ages the physical vehicle
[2:17:25] called the church would sink into the
[2:17:27] awfulest depth of satan it had become
[2:17:29] relaxed and was drifting already the age
[2:17:32] was back straightening it has left his
[2:17:33] first love the ephesians age have
[2:17:36] presented to her the opportunity for
[2:17:38] God's best and after while she prevailed
[2:17:40] then relaxed and that unguarded moment
[2:17:43] Satan planted the seed of complete
[2:17:45] ruination
[2:17:46] so you see a comma for to get relaxed
[2:17:48] keep aiming act
[2:17:51] a perfect Church keep a pen at the Holy
[2:17:53] Ghost keep aiming at the BRIT truth
[2:17:55] don't take your family for granted don't
[2:17:57] take your children for granted or take
[2:17:59] nothing for granted
[2:18:00] hallelujah have to fight go well you
[2:18:02] relax in the devil working his brains
[2:18:04] out that I can sneer and destroy you and
[2:18:08] your family oh give the love some
[2:18:09] praises people are you with me let me
[2:18:14] know
[2:18:14] [Applause]
[2:18:16] [Music]
[2:18:17] hallelujah
[2:18:19] [Applause]
[2:18:22] are they skip the church would soon give
[2:18:25] over to the leadership of man with man
[2:18:27] spans man ambition and thus sayeth the
[2:18:31] Lord thus said the Holy Ghost would no
[2:18:33] longer be our living reality
[2:18:34] and underneath damn with temper slaves
[2:18:37] who had no choice but to be in obedience
[2:18:40] to the religious hierarchy so the
[2:18:43] hardest big system is not right and in
[2:18:46] lady under there and human leadership
[2:18:48] would enslave the laity while their
[2:18:51] leaders logs erosion in ill-gotten
[2:18:53] wealth and enjoy the filthy pleasure or
[2:18:56] praise the name of the Lord
[2:18:59] oh my my mind
[2:19:02] Oh glory to God so I just kept it on I
[2:19:05] wanna kind of wrap up okay I know he's
[2:19:08] been some time but I hope you enjoying
[2:19:09] the word and this is pretty soon
[2:19:16] you still have some macaroni pile some
[2:19:19] sliced chicken breasts roosted create
[2:19:25] the name of the Lord so Iran went in
[2:19:28] once a year this glory days she kind of
[2:19:31] go reflector each other glory and so on
[2:19:32] and I want skip you know he said no you
[2:19:34] see he had to make a noise you know even
[2:19:37] at best direct understanding on a group
[2:19:39] when he will say there you know just in
[2:19:41] case here come on canoe monk a green
[2:19:44] Saturday you know like that Tony a
[2:19:46] special man otherwise that idea so in
[2:19:48] case he a commodity group limo so yeah
[2:19:50] bells ringing there right so when Iran
[2:19:53] do is sacrifice and comical and heavy
[2:19:55] bells ringing they could rejoice because
[2:19:57] we have forgiven for one year listen to
[2:19:58] what the purpose in you know the only
[2:20:00] way the congregation could tell he
[2:20:03] wasn't dead was because they hear noise
[2:20:05] and I tell you when the church lets off
[2:20:07] its noise there's something happens
[2:20:09] because everywhere the Shekinah glory is
[2:20:13] there is noise
[2:20:14] [Applause]
[2:20:16] [Music]
[2:20:19] so this hand Greenup think so on
[2:20:23] nana shine like nano Shekinah glory
[2:20:25] thing wherever decided o'clock Shekinah
[2:20:27] glory is there is noise one time he said
[2:20:31] no God no noise wherever there is God
[2:20:34] there is noise
[2:20:36] hallelujah you know in the Old Testament
[2:20:39] to enter behind that skin was dead no to
[2:20:41] stay away from behind it is dead to
[2:20:44] enter into his glory was that not a
[2:20:46] story from his glorious dead to stay out
[2:20:48] of his presence is dead always followed
[2:20:51] that one who is influenced and is backed
[2:20:54] up by God and you know where God is with
[2:20:58] them don't follow the wrong influence
[2:21:00] alright we coming down to the home
[2:21:02] stretch here now so the story read what
[2:21:05] Isaiah Isaiah and we find out that
[2:21:08] Uzziah died because he have tried in
[2:21:10] prison it ministry and so on and go
[2:21:12] struck him dead with leprosy and Isaiah
[2:21:15] run into the temple I began to pray and
[2:21:18] Bernsen sometimes go and let the very
[2:21:20] prop be knocked from under us something
[2:21:22] that sickness strike us the
[2:21:24] disappointments heartache strike or
[2:21:25] somebody left he does that to get you
[2:21:27] where he will you be influenced by the
[2:21:29] gospel and be wise enough to touch it
[2:21:32] don't be stupid enough to walk away from
[2:21:35] it
[2:21:35] so watch Isaiah know he must find
[2:21:38] something different so what did he do he
[2:21:40] went to the temple he raised his hands
[2:21:41] he cried to God he sent a vision as Ana
[2:21:44] felt the vision he saw true hand lifted
[2:21:46] up and he saw the seraphim's flying and
[2:21:50] the seraphim's mean burners somebody
[2:21:53] taught about burners okay that's what I
[2:21:56] serve him out there burners here where
[2:21:58] they are it is next to the altar
[2:21:59] actually the seraphim's is the one who
[2:22:03] received the sacrifice and cleanses the
[2:22:07] worshiper and then presents them to God
[2:22:09] so in the spirit realm when you are the
[2:22:13] altar when you worship and and so on the
[2:22:16] seraphim's is one who want to take it to
[2:22:17] the next stage
[2:22:19] that's happening the spirit realm you
[2:22:21] feel that fire on your philia anointing
[2:22:23] the Seraphim doing his work to give you
[2:22:26] a preparation to bring you higher into
[2:22:28] the presence of all-mighty God
[2:22:35] and the seraphim's was like angelic
[2:22:38] beings and they had a very next 1ch to
[2:22:40] God right at the altar is not big God
[2:22:44] the undies surface remember in some
[2:22:46] traditions they guard the gospel on
[2:22:48] either side and they were back in the
[2:22:49] Eden they guard the altar
[2:22:52] now watch Christ never died for them
[2:22:55] seraphim's they were created beings he
[2:22:58] never died for angels he died for
[2:23:00] sinners he never died for holy people
[2:23:02] that's what unholy how long you think
[2:23:04] your holy never done no you no good when
[2:23:06] you realize you are nothing then he died
[2:23:09] for you when you realize you are nothing
[2:23:11] you are the one who died for God is holy
[2:23:14] there is nothing but holiness and
[2:23:19] Hebrews 12:14 follow after peace follow
[2:23:22] peace at all men and holiness without
[2:23:24] which no man shall see the Lord
[2:23:26] Sam's 29 to give the Lord the glory do
[2:23:29] you want to his name worship the Lord in
[2:23:32] the beauty of holiness Bible described
[2:23:37] those angelic beings with two wings
[2:23:39] cover their face to its cover defeat
[2:23:41] Tuatha dé fly and the probably revealed
[2:23:43] are the two wings covering their face
[2:23:45] watch he said notice he said I wonder
[2:23:49] it was reference the two wings over the
[2:23:52] face reference reference I wonder my
[2:23:56] brother if we look at that when Holy
[2:23:58] Angels has the cover their faces stand
[2:24:00] the presence of God in reference and
[2:24:02] respect but today we find people who
[2:24:04] call ourselves have no respect at all
[2:24:06] for God his word his people or his
[2:24:09] ministry nothing if I go we all on the
[2:24:12] same plane only similar I mean this one
[2:24:15] that one down your army anything
[2:24:17] anything it's not like that sir God
[2:24:19] demands respects we need to come in more
[2:24:21] a reference a risk reverent attitude and
[2:24:24] then what I'm speaking a little bit you
[2:24:27] talk about I'll just go back at this
[2:24:28] next quote there was angels there are
[2:24:30] serums and their turbans and Sarah Faris
[2:24:33] is the one that actually is bring the
[2:24:35] burners the boon of the sacrifice making
[2:24:38] the way for the sinners approach a real
[2:24:39] high order of holiness and he saw he was
[2:24:43] not at the altar praying lord of
[2:24:44] monumental lips and making
[2:24:46] confession and when he did he saw these
[2:24:48] seraphim's two wings over their faces
[2:24:51] holy holy Lord God Almighty he was
[2:24:53] reverent in his presence isn't that
[2:24:55] right and listeners back when everybody
[2:24:58] think they are so secure they get
[2:25:00] irreverent that's why sometimes money
[2:25:02] destroys people because they have money
[2:25:04] in the pocket and it okay about nobody
[2:25:06] else they have no Putin for nobody
[2:25:08] because they figured secure they feel an
[2:25:10] anchor and what they in and so on like
[2:25:11] that so sometime got pulled off from
[2:25:13] under you and recognized you do have
[2:25:15] this if you have that that you could
[2:25:16] call upon courts name your struggle true
[2:25:18] and what enjoin you struggling because
[2:25:20] you know you will destroy yourself if
[2:25:21] too much is given to you before you
[2:25:23] could manage it oh how are you with me
[2:25:26] now
[2:25:27] so what their minds so people might get
[2:25:29] so perverted they taken the things of
[2:25:31] the world they don't even pay attention
[2:25:32] or more they go to church but they don't
[2:25:34] realize you in the presence of God not
[2:25:37] only in church not only in church here
[2:25:39] we go
[2:25:39] wherever you are you and the presence of
[2:25:44] God
[2:25:44] that's my David said I put the Lord all
[2:25:47] for my face if I shall not be moved
[2:25:49] David was conscious of the presence of
[2:25:52] God with him so you got because of what
[2:25:54] president going to bow and take a drink
[2:25:56] that makes no sense if you're conscious
[2:25:58] you see a man that's do things and they
[2:26:00] figure out that around he is seeing a
[2:26:03] guru
[2:26:03] I'm God I big big big unusal but you're
[2:26:08] not conscious where brother branham you
[2:26:11] said they were provided with two wings
[2:26:12] and you are provided with something to
[2:26:14] the build of Jesus that you're covering
[2:26:17] you don't stand in the seraphim's you
[2:26:18] don't stand of the cherubim you stand as
[2:26:20] an you don't sound as an angel but you
[2:26:22] stand as a redeem son and daughter by
[2:26:24] his blood do you don't have to have
[2:26:26] these rings that they have they are
[2:26:28] covering for them in that presence but
[2:26:30] you got a blood of Jesus it's not rice
[2:26:32] notice with two wings a cover their feet
[2:26:34] what's that humility like Moses take off
[2:26:37] your shoes the place you are holy ground
[2:26:39] he said he has a good example be
[2:26:42] conscious of your littleness not your
[2:26:44] bigness
[2:26:46] be conscious of your lip earnest not
[2:26:49] your bigness today we are Americans we
[2:26:52] try to think we are big somebody we
[2:26:53] belong to this we looked at this big
[2:26:55] organization and so on like that he said
[2:26:57] be conscious of your littleness and
[2:26:58] thirdly with two wings he could fly
[2:27:01] there's still two the wings
[2:27:03] no you put himself into action he could
[2:27:05] fly with him two wings
[2:27:06] so then watch first face over the face
[2:27:09] reference over the feet humility the
[2:27:12] wings in action it showed the Prophet
[2:27:15] how his prepared silver must be he must
[2:27:19] be reverent he must be humble and he
[2:27:22] must be in action could the church say
[2:27:24] Amen I'm almost done so bear with me now
[2:27:29] a man that serve God and prosper you
[2:27:31] sire
[2:27:32] and was fine and he perished because I
[2:27:35] shall do something God didn't call him
[2:27:36] to do as I a shortest a man is a finger
[2:27:40] but if I'm saying this to begin with
[2:27:41] I think who he is he is born in sin
[2:27:43] me iniquity coming towards pick a nice
[2:27:45] so he's a total failure I don't care
[2:27:47] he's a bishop a Pope a press whatever
[2:27:49] whatever he is he's a fill to begin with
[2:27:51] don't ever look to one I don't care
[2:27:53] don't move monkey with faith though he
[2:27:55] give all his body to be burned still
[2:27:57] look at Jesus Christ he is the one look
[2:28:00] to him and not some man so we find out a
[2:28:04] servant of God must be humble must be
[2:28:06] reverent and must be an action going to
