[14:55] &gt;&gt; Okay. All right.
[14:56] &gt;&gt; There we go.
[14:58] &gt;&gt; God bless you, brother.
[15:00] &gt;&gt; God bless you. God bless you.
[15:02] &gt;&gt; Good to see you. Uh hello everyone. God
[15:05] bless you. It's it's so great to be back
[15:07] tonight and speak to you again. Um all
[15:11] of you are always on my heart. Um so
[15:14] many things that the Lord has uh done
[15:17] for me. Um tonight is like sitting in
[15:21] your living rooms, your parlor, your
[15:23] kitchen around the table and
[15:25] fellowshipping and just talking about
[15:27] the Lord. So there's several thousand
[15:30] miles between us, but I'm with you
[15:32] there. And uh the Lord is uh Lord Jesus
[15:35] is very precious to me and has done so
[15:38] many wonderful things and uh and we've
[15:42] had so many wonderful meetings and uh
[15:44] over the last year uh just a lot of
[15:47] things that I wanted to bring back and
[15:49] share and uh testimony as well. Want to
[15:53] thank first of all for um again each one
[15:57] of you uh the ministry uh the uh song
[16:00] leaders and everyone who helps makes the
[16:02] services possible. I never really want
[16:05] to fail to say thank you because um it's
[16:08] a lifeline for us a real lifeline and I
[16:12] uh have grown incredibly uh being a part
[16:16] of Headstone Tabernacle even though it's
[16:18] across the seas. I'm really really
[16:21] grateful. So, thank you all. Um, so
[16:25] tonight is a little bit different. Um,
[16:28] the title is is the things that belong
[16:31] to us. That's the things that belong to
[16:34] us.
[16:36] And the kind of the inspiration for
[16:39] this, I believe brother O preached it
[16:42] was the bride redemptive bride's
[16:44] redemptive rights in Miami. And there
[16:47] were some things there it said that just
[16:48] kind of set me off on a path of many
[16:51] things. And in saying the things that
[16:54] belong to us probably is not that many
[16:57] of the things that we would normally
[16:58] think of. Um
[17:01] so there is a scripture that's here
[17:05] Matthew 13:52
[17:07] and that's what tonight is like. Then he
[17:10] then said he, the Lord Jesus, unto them,
[17:14] therefore every scribe which is
[17:16] instructed into the kingdom of heaven is
[17:19] like unto a man that is a householder,
[17:21] which brings forth out of his treasure
[17:24] things new and old. So that's what I'm
[17:27] doing tonight. I'm bringing out of my
[17:29] treasures that the blessed things that
[17:32] the Lord has blessed me with um through
[17:35] the ministry, through the message and so
[17:38] forth to bring those things to share
[17:40] with you um things I've learned that
[17:43] have meant a lot to me.
[17:45] Um,
[17:46] so I've often stated in one fashion or
[17:50] another that I find myself constantly
[17:53] and wonder of the gospel and the ability
[17:55] of the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ to
[17:57] obliterate sin from an individual and
[18:01] the constant growth that we have in
[18:03] Christ if we abide in him and his word
[18:06] abides in us. I sincerely u can never
[18:11] get over the wonder that I am now in the
[18:14] body of Christ as after having been a
[18:17] sinner for so long.
[18:20] Um
[18:22] I often ponder how I got there. And so
[18:25] some of these things are, you know, we
[18:28] know the promises, we know the message
[18:30] and things like that, but some of these
[18:31] things are kind of looking on the
[18:32] backside of what the Lord did um for me
[18:38] to get me where I am. And these things
[18:41] I'm say them because they apply to
[18:42] everyone really. So,
[18:46] um, you know, I I look back at life and
[18:49] I say, how how did I come from where I
[18:53] was up to this point? And there's
[18:56] beautiful scriptures, you know, that he
[18:58] has called us with a holy calling
[19:00] according to his own purpose before the
[19:02] foundation of the world, you know, not
[19:04] according to our works. And that sets
[19:06] the tone right there as to why we're
[19:08] here, what the Lord uh already
[19:12] predestinated us for.
[19:14] And so
[19:16] one thing that that really um blessed me
[19:19] concerning this was brother oid and
[19:23] Ivory Coast this year and those were
[19:25] incredible meetings. He said once a
[19:28] sheep always a sheep and so that made
[19:32] the Bible verse which is John 10:27-28
[19:36] that that just made it explode to me. I
[19:38] read this scripture many many times. It
[19:41] said, "My sheep hear my voice
[19:44] and I know them and they follow me
[19:49] and then I give unto them eternal life
[19:52] and they shall never perish neither
[19:55] shall any man pluck them out of my
[19:57] hand." And so when brother oid said that
[20:00] once a sheep always a sheep I realized
[20:05] in my previous
[20:07] uh condition as just my normal birth
[20:10] born in sin shaped in iniquity that the
[20:13] Lord was always dealing with me and I
[20:18] believe with all of us that are
[20:19] Christians to bring us to a point and I
[20:23] always thought that you know we always
[20:26] had these preconceived ideas in church
[20:28] that oh that you become a sheep you know
[20:31] you go to church and suddenly you're a
[20:32] sheep and you're following the Lord and
[20:35] he doesn't say that it's my sheep hear
[20:38] my voice and I know them and they follow
[20:40] me that's prior to Holy Ghost new birth
[20:45] there's something leading us in life
[20:48] and then he says and I give unto them
[20:52] eternal life so he actually leads us to
[20:55] eternal life they shall never perish,
[20:58] neither shall any man pluck them out of
[20:59] my hand. So that was a tremendous uh uh
[21:05] opening of things to me cuz like I said
[21:08] I you know we we we hear the scripture
[21:10] repent be baptized in the name of the
[21:11] Lord Jesus Christ you receive the Holy
[21:14] Ghost but there's these steps that are
[21:17] kind of in between and that the Lord
[21:19] that's hidden in the background I'll
[21:20] call it that are really beautiful when
[21:23] you consider how we got where we are and
[21:29] uh this This is my fifth year. I think
[21:31] it's 5 years ago. Brother Oid, you
[21:33] called me to the Bible study on the 7th
[21:36] of September, I think it was. And so,
[21:39] I'm still brand new.
[21:42] I've been going to church for a long
[21:43] time, but I'm brand new. I'm brand new
[21:45] in the Lord because and I'm learning
[21:48] like crazy. uh wish I could uh learn
[21:51] more quicker and um have more time to
[21:55] devote to prayer and more things like
[21:58] that, but you know, like all of us, we
[22:00] got to go to work and deal with those
[22:01] things.
[22:03] So anyway, it's just been a real
[22:05] blessing to me. So uh one other thing
[22:07] about as far as predestination once a
[22:10] sheep always a sheep called from before
[22:12] the foundation of the world according to
[22:14] his purpose you know um brother Brandham
[22:17] one time was speaking uh concerning
[22:20] predestination and he said I all you
[22:24] ministers out there believe that
[22:27] according to what the Lord said that the
[22:29] gospel is a net and you throw that net
[22:32] because the Lord says it plainly you
[22:33] know it's like kingdom of heaven's like
[22:35] a fishing you know, pull a net out
[22:36] there, pull it in, and they sort out the
[22:38] good from the bat. And brother Brandham
[22:40] said, "I want to ask you, was that fish
[22:42] a fish when it hit the boat deck, or was
[22:45] it a fish before it got in the net?"
[22:48] And, you know, it's another one of
[22:49] those, "Wow, you know, he um it was
[22:52] always a fish before the gospel even
[22:55] caught it. It was a fish. And when it
[22:58] come, you know, they sorted it out."
[23:03] um
[23:05] and considering God's ways to lead a
[23:07] sinner to eternal life and what it
[23:09] provides to do it. This scripture begins
[23:12] to explain the path.
[23:14] It says every good gift
[23:19] and every perfect gift is from above and
[23:23] comes cometh down from the father of
[23:25] lights.
[23:27] So here we go. Father of lights with
[23:29] whom is no variableness nor neither
[23:32] shadow of turning. So things that belong
[23:36] to us, the first one is lights.
[23:39] And so this is where we're going here.
[23:42] Um so
[23:46] I think about for instance the man who
[23:49] witnessed to me about the message. I
[23:51] mean where he lived was impossible for
[23:53] me to ever I never would have gone back
[23:55] there in my entire life. It was way back
[23:57] off the road on a lake in the end of a
[23:59] driveway that was 8 mile long.
[24:03] And the Lord just, you know, going some
[24:06] other church. They were looking for some
[24:07] place to baptize. He had he was on a
[24:09] lake. They knew him. Went back there.
[24:10] Next thing you know, we're in Bible
[24:12] studies. Next thing you know, I know the
[24:13] message and was baptized in the name of
[24:16] the Lord Jesus Christ. And so these
[24:18] these things and so this man, this first
[24:20] man, he was a retired minister. And
[24:23] anyway, so the Lord said, "You're a you
[24:26] know, a a light, you know, a city set on
[24:29] a hill." And so this man was sort of by
[24:32] witnessing to me was the first light I
[24:34] saw. And I saw the prophet uh and the
[24:38] glory of the Lord coming down in our age
[24:42] that really just blew me away.
[24:46] Um the other one though that has been
[24:49] tremendous for me in particular uh in
[24:52] the last you know decade I think uh
[24:56] which really took effect as I said about
[24:57] 5 years ago. Um the next light is a
[25:00] candlestick.
[25:02] So
[25:03] he brother Brandon was reading uh the
[25:06] scripture and uh revelation uh in
[25:09] Ephesians about the Ephesians church 8.
[25:11] Remember therefore from whence thou art
[25:13] fallen
[25:15] um and repent and do your first works or
[25:18] else I will come to thee quickly and
[25:20] remove the candlestick out of his place.
[25:25] And he says h I s his.
[25:29] So he said see who it is don't you his
[25:32] place except he repent. So these next
[25:35] quotes are uh a little rough. I'm not
[25:38] reading them to be rough or to this is
[25:41] I'm just reading them to let you know
[25:43] what the candlestick is. And um this is
[25:47] my part about this matter. Okay.
[25:51] So, brother Bam says, in other words, if
[25:54] you got a God-filled pastor,
[25:57] so he immediately identifies what the
[26:00] candlestick is. If you got a God-filled
[26:03] pastor filled with the Holy Ghost and
[26:06] you try to hold him under your finger
[26:08] and said, "Well, if he says anything
[26:09] about us having a robe choir says
[26:11] anything about us wearing makeup, we'll
[26:13] just excommunicate him." And he said,
[26:17] "Don't you worry, God will do it before
[26:18] you get a chance." So, he's talking
[26:20] about removing the candlestick. He'll go
[26:22] out and preach the stones on the street
[26:24] before he'll compromise with that kind
[26:25] of stuff. If you got a pastor that
[26:28] really tells you the truth, you ought to
[26:30] honor God and stay in the spirit and
[26:32] worship God. Uh, you know, realizing
[26:35] that you're going to be lost if you
[26:36] don't. And he says another place down,
[26:39] "Remember and repent or I will remove
[26:41] the light of the star," which he's still
[26:43] referring to the candlestick.
[26:45] What's his place in the church? If you
[26:48] don't repent and go back where he was in
[26:50] the first place, I'll take your pastor
[26:53] right away from you and move him out of
[26:55] his place. I'll put him somewhere else
[26:57] where I'll reflect my light that'll
[26:59] shine.
[27:01] And so again, these sound like rebuking
[27:03] quotes. That's not my intent. My intent
[27:05] is to that the Lord
[27:08] places
[27:10] among us offices.
[27:13] And I will say the in human terms an
[27:17] office
[27:19] uh say our government here in the states
[27:22] founding fathers United States in the
[27:25] constitution created offices with power.
[27:29] They created the office of the president
[27:31] of the United States. They endued that
[27:33] office with certain powers and you know
[27:37] over the military and all kinds of
[27:38] things. But that office with all that
[27:41] authority is zero
[27:44] until you put a man in that office.
[27:48] So um
[27:50] so we have the Lord sets up offices and
[27:54] then he appoints men to those offices.
[27:57] And so the office of pastor has uh and
[28:02] I'm not holding up a man. Brother oid
[28:05] knows this. I see you how many times he
[28:07] said, "Hey, the Lord I'm in the Lord's
[28:08] in I'm in his hand like this. He does
[28:10] like this and I'm I'm done." So, but
[28:13] there is a respect that I have for the
[28:16] office of pastor cuz I see something
[28:20] there that I cannot explain. I have told
[28:23] my wife, I said, "There is something in
[28:25] that man that is leading me." I don't
[28:29] talk to him on the phone much. We maybe
[28:30] talked once or twice a year, but I can't
[28:33] believe how many times I've come out of
[28:35] services and I knew what I was supposed
[28:38] to do or there was something to help me
[28:41] grow or there's something that I better
[28:43] get right, you know, and so I'm just
[28:47] saying candlestick, that's the first one
[28:50] of the first um things that belong to us
[28:53] that God has given us. And of course,
[28:55] there's the entire five-fold ministry.
[28:58] Um, not the ones in people's heads, the
[29:01] one God places himself. And we have been
[29:04] really blessed with some tremendous
[29:05] gifts in that respect.
[29:08] Um, let's see. So, the next one, of
[29:11] course, the next light is the prophet.
[29:16] A star, but he's a was the seventh star
[29:19] in the Lord's right hand. And this
[29:21] really I saw sometime brother Isaac was
[29:24] preaching probably around Christmas time
[29:27] and he wasn't really preaching in this
[29:29] frame but it still meant to me. He said
[29:32] he quoted out we have seen his star and
[29:34] have come to worship him. And I was like
[29:38] oh my goodness
[29:40] I at that old minister's office back
[29:42] down that dirt road on the lake. That's
[29:45] what happened. I saw that star.
[29:48] I saw the seventh angel and I went to
[29:52] worship Christ. I went looking for
[29:54] Christ. I went after him. It drew me to
[29:57] him. And so I never forgot that when
[30:01] brother Isaac said that and I said,
[30:03] "Okay, wow, that's amazing." So the
[30:06] light of the star, the seventh angel, uh
[30:10] this morning going to work, I uh started
[30:15] crying. I started I was listening to
[30:17] Revelations five, one of the two uh
[30:21] tapes and he was talking about seven
[30:23] stars, seven lamps, seven spirits. He
[30:26] says seven mercy seats of God. And man,
[30:29] I just I had to turn it off and start
[30:31] trying to hold myself together because I
[30:33] saw I had been set under one of those
[30:36] seven mercy seats and it was reflected
[30:39] or represented by the prophet to us
[30:42] here. And um so anyway, so that light of
[30:46] the prophet
[30:48] um one thing with brother Brandham being
[30:51] the prophet was um and I just kind of
[30:55] studied this quickly is um I will read
[30:59] one thing brother Oid said in Miami is
[31:02] loose ends. He said the prophets there
[31:05] to gather up loose ends and then there
[31:08] reveal hidden mysteries. Things that are
[31:10] written in the Bible but were hidden
[31:11] through the ages. All right.
[31:14] So this is um brother Oid read this
[31:18] quote. Brother Bam speaking of the last
[31:21] angel which was himself
[31:24] until it comes to that last angel. Now
[31:26] he has no certain mystery but and that
[31:30] was profound. He has no certain mystery
[31:34] but he gathers up all that's been lost
[31:37] in them other ages.
[31:40] all the truths that wasn't fully
[31:42] revealed yet. See the revelation come
[31:44] then he reveals those things in his day.
[31:47] If you want to read it, it's Revelation
[31:48] 10.
[31:50] So this is uh quite profound. I've uh
[31:56] some time ago uh heard a testimony of
[31:58] brother uh um oh my mind slips. Brother
[32:03] Green out there in Arizona that he um
[32:06] was um talking about people saying,
[32:09] "Well, Brother Brandham just read the
[32:10] history and he just repeated what he
[32:12] read." He's like, "Well, but who could
[32:15] have told that the white horse was this,
[32:17] the black horse is that?" and all that.
[32:19] And I was in total agreement because it
[32:22] is absolutely mindblowing when you
[32:26] listen to brother Brandham
[32:28] go through step in and something step
[32:32] into him and start going through
[32:34] scriptures like it's unreal and put
[32:37] things together. And I love to read
[32:40] history. Um, I I think I mentioned
[32:43] before I like to read brothers, real
[32:45] Christians that that ministers that were
[32:47] going on before us like John Wesley and
[32:50] so forth. And these brothers knew some
[32:54] of these things,
[32:56] but it was not made known to the public
[33:01] or shoved under the rug by
[33:03] organizations.
[33:05] So this is John Wesley on predestination
[33:09] and this is right out of his one of his
[33:12] sermons.
[33:13] Um the English and these guys you know
[33:16] it's a little he had to wait a little
[33:18] wait a little bit deep in it. He says
[33:20] all that are called were predestinated.
[33:24] So all whom God has predestinated he
[33:27] forneew.
[33:29] He knew, he saw them as believers and as
[33:32] such predestinated them to salvation
[33:35] according to his eternal decree. He that
[33:38] believeth shall be saved. Thus we see
[33:41] the whole pro process of the work of God
[33:44] from the end to the beginning.
[33:47] Who are glorified? None but those who
[33:49] are first sanctified. Who are
[33:50] sanctified? None but those who were
[33:53] first justified. Who are justified? None
[33:56] but those who were predestinated who
[33:59] were predestinated none but those whom
[34:02] God forneew as believers and this is
[34:05] John Wesley and so these are things that
[34:09] I certainly never heard in the
[34:11] organizational churches we and I tell
[34:13] you what I'm guarantee that Methodists
[34:15] don't meant to preach this today so that
[34:18] so I was thinking you know brother
[34:19] Bham's talking about gathering up the
[34:20] loose ends if you gather something up
[34:22] that means a lot of it was out there it
[34:25] was just pulling it in.
[34:28] So this one, the next one is a minister.
[34:33] There were three men that I have read
[34:35] their works uh that lived at the same
[34:38] time. John Wesley uh in the 1700s. I
[34:42] think his ministry started around
[34:44] 1730ish
[34:45] on up through. This man, his name was
[34:48] Thomas Scott. And Thomas Scott was a
[34:51] friend of John Newton, the minister who
[34:54] wrote Amazing Grace. And Thomas Scott
[34:58] was a John Newton was a rascal or he was
[35:01] like, you know, pick a wicked man you
[35:04] can think of in Trinidad. That's John.
[35:05] That's John Newton was a bad guy. He was
[35:07] a bad guy. And he was so blasphemous. He
[35:12] was a sailor. He was so blasphemous. He
[35:15] he made fun of the gospel. He taught
[35:17] other people to make fun of the gospel.
[35:19] And this is a man who eventually wrote
[35:21] Amazing Grace.
[35:23] And he was so bad that a a ships he was
[35:28] on a sailor. He was on a ship and a
[35:29] captain who he described as a passionate
[35:32] man, which means he yelled and screamed
[35:34] and cursed at everybody. That man, you
[35:37] know, admonished John Newton for how bad
[35:40] he was. He's like, you know, even
[35:43] sinners know, wait, you're pushing it
[35:44] too far with God. Okay.
[35:48] you know, center man said, "Wait, wait,
[35:49] wait, wait. You know, he's going to sink
[35:51] the ship or something here." And but
[35:53] John Newton, his story is stunning.
[35:56] Absolutely stunning. It's a small book.
[35:58] Uh probably I'm looking at 38 3/4 of an
[36:00] inch or 38 of an inch thick. It's his
[36:03] memoirs and it's well worth reading.
[36:05] Well, anyway, he was a friend of Thomas
[36:07] Scott. Thomas Scott was the other way.
[36:10] Thomas Scott was a farmer's son,
[36:13] intelligent.
[36:14] He educated himself. He became a also
[36:20] Thomas Scott were all ministers in the
[36:22] church of England all at the same time.
[36:26] Thomas Scott wanted an easy way to make
[36:29] a living. So being intelligent, he
[36:32] studied all for the ministry and
[36:33] everything and got in and took all the
[36:36] oaths and everything and everything he
[36:38] read, all the stuff from the church that
[36:41] he had to study, he put it down after he
[36:43] become a minister and never read it
[36:44] again. And he didn't even believe the
[36:47] Lord Jesus was divine. So he had these
[36:50] dreams, right? But Thomas Scott
[36:51] obviously come up to a place through his
[36:55] friend friendship with John Newton who
[36:56] had been a minister about 10 years up to
[36:58] that point. And the Lord revealed he got
[37:02] desperate and he started praying and he
[37:04] spent three years on his knees asking
[37:08] the Lord to reveal the truth and slowly
[37:12] disproved all his own theories and came
[37:15] to predestination and everything.
[37:18] So this is that man
[37:20] um
[37:22] he says and this is concerning the
[37:25] attributes of God. This man, it's thick
[37:29] English I call it. But he says, I
[37:32] perceive that redemption itself
[37:34] as planned by God to whom were known all
[37:39] his works from the beginning of the
[37:40] world must be the result of his eternal
[37:44] purpose of displaying the glory of his
[37:47] mercy and grace. So he's seeing already
[37:50] the purpose of this is God to display
[37:52] himself.
[37:54] um and thus manifesting the
[37:56] inexhaustible resources of his manifold
[37:59] wisdom and glorifying at once all these
[38:02] attributes.
[38:04] I considered that until the fall of man
[38:08] and his and his redemption had
[38:10] manifested is I considered that until
[38:13] the fall of man and the Lord's
[38:15] redemption had manifest the attribute of
[38:17] his mercy to sinners. It had, as far as
[38:20] we can learn, been unexced and
[38:23] undisplayed
[38:25] and consequently unknown to any but God
[38:27] himself from all eternity. So he's
[38:31] saying basically he was a savior. He had
[38:34] attributes to be a savior. It was
[38:37] unmanifested
[38:38] until it was exercised when a man fell
[38:42] into sin.
[38:44] And see
[38:48] see here try to wade through it here. Um
[38:52] it could not have nor could he have had
[38:55] the glory of it had he not chosen some
[38:57] objects on whom to exercise it and
[38:59] devised some meth method of displaying
[39:02] it in consistency with other per
[39:04] perfections.
[39:06] I perceived redemption to be the effect
[39:09] of a subtle design from God's eternal
[39:12] councils of manifesting himself.
[39:16] So he's got big words,
[39:20] but it's the same thing. See?
[39:24] Yeah. So,
[39:27] so he he goes on and on about the
[39:29] attributes of God that God and his
[39:31] infinite he had these attributes that he
[39:33] wanted to display and you know sin and
[39:37] everything. And so he's this very large
[39:39] English words or it's it's thick I call
[39:41] it. It's not difficult. It's just the
[39:43] way it's written. But I'm like wow this
[39:46] man in the 1700s and he knows God's got
[39:49] attributes that needs to be displayed.
[39:51] So loose in out there. Okay. And
[39:56] one reason that there were loose ends,
[40:01] it's sort of like during the dark ages,
[40:03] the Bible was not uh in the hands of
[40:07] normal of of men of believers. The
[40:10] Catholic Church had it locked up. Um I
[40:13] think it went to what the Gutenberg
[40:15] Bible, you know, and then the word of
[40:17] God began to go into the hands of men at
[40:19] that point, like 1500s or something. And
[40:22] so
[40:24] so there was that time of darkness
[40:26] because there was no word. So as the
[40:29] reformation went forward
[40:33] and he then Thomas Scott found some
[40:36] books after he had studied and prayed
[40:38] and discovered and the Lord revealed
[40:41] these things to him. He found that these
[40:44] things were already known. He went back
[40:46] into books from the 1500s and 1600s and
[40:50] he said, "I I did all this and you know
[40:52] praying and fasting and everything.
[40:55] Lord, reveal it to me." And he said, "In
[40:57] fact, these guys before me, they knew
[40:59] the same thing." And so he said, and
[41:04] this is where some of these things were
[41:06] lost to
[41:09] the public. Um
[41:12] he says that of these men uh it is
[41:15] greatly to be wished that their
[41:17] remaining writings were were more
[41:19] generally known among us and did not
[41:22] remain locked up from the world in large
[41:25] folios and learned languages in books
[41:28] out of print or exceeding scarce. And
[41:32] consequence of this, the members of our
[41:34] national church, the Church of England,
[41:36] are in general utterly ignorant of the
[41:39] standard doctrines
[41:41] uh and ignorantly brand those the
[41:44] doctrines that he's talking about
[41:45] predestination and all these things.
[41:48] They brand those as Methodists and
[41:50] enthusiasts who preach zealously the
[41:53] very doctrines of the first reformers.
[41:56] So put that simply there was men that
[41:59] understood one thing the gospel is very
[42:02] consistent. The Lord doesn't change. So
[42:06] he in grace revealed a lot of things
[42:09] along the way to different men who wrote
[42:12] that down. Then those books went into
[42:14] dark libraries and corners and they
[42:16] weren't available to the general public
[42:18] only because he was a minister. Someone
[42:20] had copies of those gave it to him. He's
[42:22] like, "Oh my goodness, it's already
[42:23] here."
[42:25] So
[42:27] uh in in those days they were called
[42:30] Methodist. Methodist back then was a
[42:32] derogatory name like holy roller. It
[42:36] wasn't you know with honor whatever it
[42:39] has now. So to be called Methodist
[42:41] because John Newton, Thomas Scott, even
[42:44] John Wesley were not Methodists. They
[42:47] were Church of England.
[42:49] So but you know they they called them
[42:52] that just mocking them.
[42:54] All right, here we go. Next one. So,
[42:57] with brother Brandham, back to the
[42:59] prophet. Uh, one thing was that we had
[43:03] all these intelligent men. John Newton
[43:06] taught himself uh, Latin,
[43:09] Greek, Hebrew. He only had like, you
[43:12] know, four or five years in school, I
[43:14] think, maybe six. Thomas Scott was a
[43:16] farmer's
[43:18] um, son. Um Wesley of course went to
[43:21] Oxford. And so when brother Random came,
[43:26] here's this Kentucky band, southern
[43:28] accent, speaks bad.
[43:32] And I love it. I really do. You know, he
[43:34] can't even read when he starts out. His
[43:36] first wife, he said, would stand up and
[43:38] read the Bible. And he said, "Do you
[43:40] believe that?" Amen. Okay, next verse.
[43:41] You know, he can't even read. And that
[43:44] totally threw to me through the the
[43:47] church world.
[43:49] uh a absolute curveball because they had
[43:52] just come out of the age of man because
[43:56] brother Brandham says he's talking about
[43:58] the age of man. Next come was a man the
[44:01] beast you know the beast with the four
[44:03] faces the beast with a face of a man and
[44:06] that man was the reformers man's
[44:08] education theology and so forth. They
[44:12] said again the next beast that went to
[44:14] meet the horse rider of that day was the
[44:17] beast with the face of a man. It's
[44:18] another uh message. How many knows that
[44:21] the intellectual age, the reformers,
[44:24] Luther, Wesley, Calvin, Knox, Finny,
[44:28] Moody. So um
[44:32] so like I said when the prophet comes
[44:34] along
[44:36] he is almost on purpose I'm sure chosen
[44:40] the way you know people expect when the
[44:43] Lord was to come to come down on white
[44:45] steed and you know come ride down and
[44:47] come into the temple and instead he came
[44:49] in a stable with manure on the ground
[44:53] and so here comes Elijah
[44:55] out of Kentucky
[44:57] a son of a bootleger
[45:00] and the you know the only way the signs
[45:05] and wonders and miracles is what got
[45:06] them to follow it first but then it
[45:09] really threw him a curveball when it
[45:10] comes to the doctrine and you still hear
[45:12] them talking about it sometimes
[45:15] so
[45:16] um let's see so the thing that really
[45:18] blows my mind with brother Brandham
[45:21] again was the inspiration
[45:24] uh it is stunning there is no man that
[45:27] I've ever read and I love to read that
[45:30] could step into the pulpit
[45:33] and take the word of God and put it
[45:35] together in a stunning manner. Uh I was
[45:39] blessed my son-in-law uh told me about
[45:42] this set. It's a headset. It's actually
[45:44] right here. And they you can they
[45:48] actually don't cover your ears. They
[45:50] vibrate the cheekbones.
[45:52] And what it does, I can put that
[45:54] headphones if I'm vacuuming, if I'm
[45:57] mowing the lawn, if I'm whatever, I can
[46:00] listen to a message. So, I've had a
[46:02] jubilee cuz I'm a reader mostly. I have
[46:05] not in the past listen to tapes. But I
[46:09] this whole much of this year, I started
[46:12] to hold the church ages, uh, the
[46:15] Revelation 4, Revelation 5, uh, on
[46:18] through there. And I tell you, it's been
[46:20] a a tremendous time. I'm out in the yard
[46:23] going around in circles, cutting grass,
[46:25] and I'm in another world. And it's
[46:27] stunning to hear Brother Bam step into
[46:30] the pulpit and say, "Okay, if you turn
[46:33] to this scripture now, you can see it
[46:34] back here in the Old Testament. You go
[46:35] to here and you go to here and you go to
[46:36] here and my head's spinning
[46:39] because you realize that Lord stepped
[46:42] into him and it's just going through
[46:44] everything and revealing it. There's no
[46:46] way uh there's no man in history that
[46:49] could do that. Uh all these men that
[46:51] were educated, they could not do that.
[46:53] They had bits and pieces, loose ends,
[46:55] but they could not put it together. So
[46:58] that was a gift of God to us for that.
[47:01] That brought the whole word together to
[47:03] bring the manifestation of course that
[47:05] we are uh here for
[47:08] of the sons of God.
[47:11] So
[47:13] uh I really love Revelation 4.
[47:15] Um,
[47:18] it was so beautiful. We're let's do the
[47:20] church ages and he gets a Revelation 4.
[47:22] I got it here. And in the church ages,
[47:26] John in Revelation is
[47:29] um looking and sees the Lord standing in
[47:33] the midst of seven golden candlesticks,
[47:35] seven church ages. In Revelations 4,
[47:39] John says, "After this, I looked and
[47:41] behold, a door was opened in heaven, and
[47:44] the first voice which I heard, the one
[47:47] in the seven golden candlesticks was as
[47:50] it were of a trumpet, which it was the
[47:52] same voice." There was a trumpet voice
[47:54] back there, said, "Come up hither." So,
[47:57] here we go. And the rapture. And this
[48:00] this just blew my mind. And I will show
[48:03] thee things which must be hereafter. And
[48:06] immediately I was in the spirit. Behold,
[48:08] a throne was set in heaven and one on
[48:10] the throne. And so,
[48:13] let me pull my thing back up here.
[48:18] So, Brother Brandham was speaking about
[48:20] that. He said, "See,
[48:23] Revelations 4, the lamb that was walking
[48:26] in the midst of the seven churches is
[48:29] now in heaven on the throne." And he
[48:31] says, "And the seven church ages are
[48:34] passed." I was like, "Wow,
[48:37] what a view." Because we always think,
[48:39] you know, we'll be caught up together
[48:40] with the Lord in the air with the
[48:41] saints, you know, we'll be with the Lord
[48:43] forever. And there's like this ending,
[48:45] you know, the rapture and you're kind of
[48:47] there. And the prophet takes us through
[48:50] like a portal on the other side of the
[48:53] rapture and you're looking back and it
[48:56] was just a profound view of the church
[48:58] ages are finished, you know, and we're
[49:02] there in heaven before the Lord. And uh
[49:06] so these are the things that just really
[49:08] blew my mind with brother Brandham by
[49:10] the gift of God in him because that
[49:14] seven seat of mercy was there in him,
[49:17] right? And um to expound the word like
[49:21] that and put it together like that. Um
[49:24] so it just all blows me away. So when
[49:29] brother Bam was going to preach the
[49:30] seven church ages, I've read the book uh
[49:33] exposition on church ages. I had never
[49:35] listened to the tape. Uh, you know,
[49:37] wasn't too long ago, you had to have all
[49:39] the cassette tapes, you know, or
[49:41] somebody that could pirate you the MP3s
[49:44] or something, you know. Now we've got
[49:45] them. I mean, everything. U remembers,
[49:50] you know, the stand, the size of cabinet
[49:53] you had to have to have all the
[49:55] cassettes. And then people prior to
[49:56] that, you had reel to reel. I don't even
[49:58] know how they did all those or afford
[50:00] them.
[50:02] Now we have it all on our phone. the
[50:04] whole message. So, brother Brandham then
[50:08] he's teaching about um getting ready to
[50:10] teach these seven church ages and he
[50:14] says, "Oh, may God help us as we teach
[50:17] these. I've studied it from the
[50:20] historical standpoint." So, he's looking
[50:22] at uh verified history,
[50:26] but but I can't wait to get in the
[50:28] pulpit here for the inspiration.
[50:31] and uh or he says, "But wait till I get
[50:34] in the pulpit here for the inspiration."
[50:36] And when I heard that the first time, I
[50:38] was like, "Wow, he sounds as excited to
[50:42] hear what's going to come as the people
[50:47] and it was really neat." And he says it
[50:49] kind of more calm, but that's the way I
[50:51] heard it the first time. He says in
[50:53] this, he said, "But wait till I get in
[50:54] the pulpit here for the inspiration." So
[50:57] he's got all the preparation. steps in
[50:59] the pulpit and the Lord steps in. Right?
[51:02] Because I feel that we are sitting
[51:05] together in heavenly places in Christ
[51:07] Jesus.
[51:09] And this is key. And that your spirit,
[51:12] your part, the liquifier, the Holy
[51:15] Spirit that's on you comes to another
[51:20] and another to another and it kindles
[51:23] the great body of God. It sets it a
[51:26] flame. And there's where revelations
[51:28] which it kind of ends off he probably
[51:29] meant come and I was like well
[51:34] that's the ministry it's quite something
[51:37] that we can bring our licks of fire
[51:40] together and the ministry in an office
[51:44] can bring forth even further you know
[51:48] than if we all sat there and stare. So,
[51:53] and then one time a minister asked him
[51:56] says, "How in the world do you remember
[51:59] all those scriptures? You know, I I
[52:02] can't remember even half the stuff that
[52:03] I write down." As another minister
[52:05] asked, Brother Brandham. And he told
[52:08] him, he said, I said, "An hour after I
[52:11] get out of the pulpit, I couldn't tell
[52:12] you what I said. See, it's not me. I
[52:16] don't know.
[52:18] See, it's him. capital H putting it
[52:21] together. I don't know. See, I can't
[52:24] tell you. I just get up there, something
[52:27] strikes me, and I just know the
[52:29] scriptures like that. You might ask me
[52:32] the scripture an hour later, and I
[52:34] wouldn't know, but it just comes like
[52:36] that. And sitting on the lawnmower,
[52:39] listening all those revelation tapes or
[52:41] whatever, you see it so clearly. It's
[52:44] just stunning to listen to him, you
[52:47] know, go back and forth and you
[52:49] understand clearly that it's not him,
[52:52] it's the Lord, you know, because only
[52:55] the Lord knows the word that well.
[52:58] And and then in Revelation part five,
[53:00] uh, chapter 5 part two, he says again,
[53:04] don't let me
[53:06] have to try to tell you it's some of my
[53:08] great wisdom.
[53:10] He's kind of saying, no, it's not my
[53:12] wisdom. And this was interesting. But
[53:14] the one who revealed the secrets of the
[53:16] heart.
[53:18] So everybody is really mesmerized by the
[53:21] discernment in the prayer line. Your
[53:23] name is Miss so and so. You got a
[53:25] daughter you're praying for. Her name is
[53:26] so and so and she lives here and there
[53:28] and people are mesmerized by those
[53:31] things, right? The supernatural. But he
[53:33] says the one who revealed the secrets of
[53:36] the heart is the one that showed me in
[53:39] the scripture.
[53:41] So he's saying all the things that you
[53:43] were hearing me say
[53:46] is the same one same one that you see in
[53:48] the prayer line. And uh that was
[53:51] stunning stunning to me. So there's
[53:54] there's so many things I could say there
[53:56] uh in the prophet. It's just um it's
[53:59] just so amazing.
[54:01] So
[54:03] um
[54:05] the I call it the the I was talking
[54:08] about lights. So um I'm talking fast
[54:11] here I think but brother Brandham also
[54:15] of course the pillar of fire was in the
[54:18] meeting. So that's what I kind of call
[54:19] the third example of lights that we have
[54:23] been given. of course he was the source
[54:25] of the light in the prophet you know and
[54:28] in those um in the pastors you know and
[54:31] different ones that's the pillar of fire
[54:33] the lord Jesus himself
[54:36] but there was a beautiful quote cuz we
[54:38] always see again the magnificence of the
[54:43] pillar of fire we read about it in the
[54:45] meetings that brother Brandham had
[54:47] especially early on I read uh uh those
[54:50] books that are about brother Brandham uh
[54:52] I can't remember the man that wrote
[54:54] those put those books together, but
[54:55] describes a pillar fire going down the
[54:57] aisle, visible and people on both sides
[55:02] jumping out of wheelchairs, blind,
[55:04] hearing, everything, you know, and these
[55:08] um pillar fire going out over someone
[55:12] and telling them exactly uh all kinds of
[55:14] things about them, you know, a pillar of
[55:16] fire coming down in the pictures in
[55:19] Switzerland, I think it was, where you
[55:21] see it come down in the pictures down
[55:23] into brother Brand and when it hits him
[55:25] he speaks out to somebody. So there's
[55:28] all these tremendous things. Whoa.
[55:30] Pillar of fire, you know.
[55:33] But he said
[55:36] that
[55:37] of the pillar of fire, this beautiful
[55:40] quote, that same Jehovah God has sent
[55:45] his light, the pillar of fire, before
[55:49] the coming of his son the second time
[55:53] to lead us.
[55:56] Uh, beautiful to comfort us,
[56:00] to bring us into that fountain
[56:04] that we may wash from our sins and be
[56:08] clean in the righteousness of his son,
[56:11] the Lord Jesus, and become sons and
[56:14] daughters of God, born a new by the
[56:17] spirit of God, which changes.
[56:20] And that was so beautiful because, like
[56:22] I said, you think human thinking, we're
[56:24] like pillar fire. Oh my goodness. It's
[56:27] wa but it's the purpose of it was so uh
[56:31] it was so loving of the Lord, you know,
[56:33] so beautiful to to lead us, to comfort
[56:36] us, to bring us to that fountain. And uh
[56:39] I just was thought that was really
[56:41] beautiful.
[56:43] So let's see here. So things that belong
[56:47] to us.
[56:49] And the next one is uh we had lights. So
[56:53] the ministry, you know, prophet, the
[56:55] local ministry that uh pastors,
[56:57] teachers, uh evangelists, prophets, so
[57:00] forth that the Lord gives us to shine
[57:05] himself through cuz he is that light
[57:07] source that goes through there. And uh
[57:12] it's an interesting thing because
[57:15] naturally people look at the flesh
[57:19] with supernatural eyes, you see it
[57:21] something else. you can't explain it
[57:23] otherwise.
[57:24] Uh it's amazing to me and I'm just super
[57:27] grateful. Next thing is the Holy Ghost.
[57:31] That's the next things that belong to
[57:33] us.
[57:35] Uh early in the message when I was in
[57:37] the message um
[57:39] um I was riding back and forth u here to
[57:42] Fort Wayne. Fort Wayne, the church down
[57:43] there was almost an hour and a half
[57:45] drive. And the brother I was with, and I
[57:48] was brand new, you know, in the message,
[57:52] maybe just had known about a year or a
[57:54] year and a half too.
[57:56] And he was lamenting about that, you
[57:59] know, the the Holy Ghost series, what is
[58:02] the Holy Ghost? What's it given for? And
[58:04] brother Bram talks about tomorrow night
[58:06] we're going to talk about how to receive
[58:08] it. And uh we're going to hold that
[58:10] tape, I think he says. And so this
[58:13] brother was lamenting, oh well, you
[58:15] know, just imagine if we had that third
[58:18] tape, you know, that third tape's
[58:19] missing somewhere, you know, of how to
[58:21] receive the Holy Ghost. And you know,
[58:25] all these years, I thought of that.
[58:28] Um but I can tell you
[58:31] it's right in front of us because in
[58:34] fact brother Brandham now that I uh have
[58:38] been changed myself uh with a birth I
[58:42] look through the message I'm like it's
[58:44] brother Brandham plainly said it in many
[58:46] places how to receive the Holy Ghost you
[58:49] don't need the third tape it's there
[58:53] and this is one part of it in the
[58:56] uncertain Now he said but when you
[59:00] thoroughly now I'm talking holy ghost
[59:02] for a birth I mean there's you know
[59:04] placing and those things that we are
[59:07] promised as well but for a birth when
[59:09] you thoroughly repent
[59:13] and believe on the Lord Jesus Christ
[59:15] you're going to get it.
[59:18] Nothing uncertain about that. You shall
[59:20] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. Is
[59:22] that right?
[59:24] And he said, "God said, I'll give
[59:29] whosoever will the Holy Ghost. It comes
[59:33] and there's nothing uncertain about
[59:34] that." And you say, "I'm a drunkard. I'm
[59:38] a prostitute.
[59:40] I don't care what you are. Whosoever
[59:43] will let him come." Nothing uncertain
[59:45] about that. So
[59:49] I will say that I think repentance is
[59:54] probably the biggest problem.
[59:57] Uh brother Bam calls it the veil of
[59:59] self-will.
[1:00:01] Uh my experience uh it's only my
[1:00:04] experience. Obviously there's lots of
[1:00:05] others that have it, you know, uh
[1:00:07] different things, but I repented for 20
[1:00:10] years. Lord, I'm so sorry I did this.
[1:00:12] Lord, I'm so sorry I did that.
[1:00:15] And that's not repentance.
[1:00:18] Um, repentance comes down to a heart
[1:00:22] level. For me, it was like all the stuff
[1:00:26] that I was trying to do and I'm sorry,
[1:00:28] Lord, and I'm not going to I'm not going
[1:00:30] to do this, and I'm going to try this,
[1:00:31] I'm going to try that, was totally
[1:00:33] kicked out from under me to where I just
[1:00:37] come and kind of like, I'm Jacob. I This
[1:00:40] is what I am. This is what I've done.
[1:00:43] This is how I got there. I got nothing I
[1:00:46] can offer you. I have zero. And but I
[1:00:50] accept by faith the sacrifice that you
[1:00:53] provided for me. And then the miracle
[1:00:55] come. The problem was repentance really.
[1:00:59] I didn't never really repent. I didn't
[1:01:01] own my sin, you know. So
[1:01:06] let me see. So one thing that's
[1:01:08] beautiful I like because he has to lead
[1:01:11] us into it, right?
[1:01:14] He uh and I will say brother Solomon as
[1:01:17] far as repentance and everything uh in
[1:01:20] Ivory Coast he he preached it
[1:01:22] beautifully. Uh there's um with the the
[1:01:26] dual translation it's a little bit tough
[1:01:28] to hear a little bit but brother uh
[1:01:30] Solomon really preached it beautifully I
[1:01:32] coast about receiving the Holy Ghost and
[1:01:34] repenting and so forth.
[1:01:38] So, one quote I love is because
[1:01:41] sometimes when you think of uh a person
[1:01:44] as I was
[1:01:46] thinking of how in the world I'm going
[1:01:48] to receive the Holy Ghost, he says,
[1:01:51] "Brother Bam,
[1:01:53] uh he's telling a man, y'all remember
[1:01:54] the story. The man said, uh that'd come
[1:01:57] out of a church service. The man said,
[1:02:00] "Brother Brand, you know, um, I just
[1:02:03] don't can't buy or believe what you say,
[1:02:05] but however, I'd like you to come over
[1:02:07] to my house and have supper." And
[1:02:08] brother Bam said, "No, I got plans." He
[1:02:10] said, "Where's your house?" "Well, it's
[1:02:12] up over that hill there." And it was
[1:02:14] dark outside. And we said, "Well, you
[1:02:17] can't see it from there." And you know
[1:02:19] the story. It was, "Well, how do you get
[1:02:21] there?" "Well, I got a lantern." Well,
[1:02:24] you can't see your house, but I can see
[1:02:25] the light and I can walk in the light of
[1:02:27] this lantern until I get to my home. And
[1:02:30] so that's what brother Brandon was
[1:02:32] saying. He said, "That's it. Just walk
[1:02:35] in the light."
[1:02:37] So that's an encouragement to every
[1:02:40] single person, no matter
[1:02:43] what place you're in. He said, "Just
[1:02:46] keep walking. Don't stand still. You'll
[1:02:50] never get nowhere if you stand still."
[1:02:52] Basically, if you've been saved, walk to
[1:02:55] sanctification. You say, "How do you get
[1:02:57] there?" Just keep walking. It's the
[1:03:00] baptism of the Holy Ghost after
[1:03:02] sanctification. How do I get that? Just
[1:03:05] keep walking in the light. Is signs and
[1:03:08] wonders and miracles. Just keep walking
[1:03:10] in the light. Just keep on. Every time
[1:03:13] you make a step, the light will jump
[1:03:16] just a little ahead of you because he
[1:03:19] he's the Lord always ahead of you.
[1:03:22] He don't push, he leads. He is the
[1:03:25] light. Oh, I'm so glad of that. Aren't
[1:03:28] you? He is the light and in him there is
[1:03:30] no darkness. So, I love that. And that
[1:03:33] is uh my encouragement for everybody. I
[1:03:35] don't care where you're at. Just keep
[1:03:37] walking. There are times when uh you
[1:03:41] know, even in since my birth, it's like
[1:03:44] h I'm so tired, you know, you know, I
[1:03:47] don't feel like reading or whatever. And
[1:03:50] I'm like, "No,
[1:03:52] just keep putting wood on the fire. No
[1:03:55] matter how you feel, keep putting wood
[1:03:57] on the fire. Keep keep it stoking it,
[1:04:00] you know, keep walking in the light,
[1:04:01] tiredness or not." And that has been a
[1:04:04] tremendous thing because when you feel
[1:04:06] in the flesh really bad and you just
[1:04:09] start reading the word, you start
[1:04:11] getting into the message and something
[1:04:14] beyond your flesh comes up and anoints
[1:04:17] you and you have something to live on,
[1:04:20] something to uh spiritually eat and it
[1:04:23] gives you strength to go forward
[1:04:24] regardless of how your how your natural
[1:04:26] body feels.
[1:04:29] So,
[1:04:31] so the next one uh things that belong to
[1:04:35] us is prayer
[1:04:39] and brother Brandham he says stay under
[1:04:43] prayer
[1:04:46] and he said this is in Hebrews chapter
[1:04:49] 1. Now on this side he's talking about
[1:04:52] they had the fanatical side and you know
[1:04:54] different sides of Christians. He's
[1:04:56] talking about going down the middle of
[1:04:57] the road. though the one side he says
[1:04:59] now on this side from opposite of
[1:05:02] fanatical when people get converted
[1:05:06] I mean he's talking born again
[1:05:11] you know and you think oh Holy Ghost I'm
[1:05:14] done no
[1:05:16] sir he said on this side when people get
[1:05:20] converted
[1:05:21] their minds is set right on Christ
[1:05:25] their mind after conversion set right on
[1:05:28] And if they're just a little scholarly
[1:05:30] and don't keep under prayer,
[1:05:34] they'll get real cold and stiff and
[1:05:38] starchy and indifferent.
[1:05:42] And this is a converted person.
[1:05:45] You remember he said, "Okay, you know
[1:05:48] the stature of perfect man." Okay, you
[1:05:50] got faith which is birth.
[1:05:52] You just got started.
[1:05:55] Because that means you still got a
[1:05:56] journey. And for, you know, again, back
[1:06:01] in, you know, carnal days and
[1:06:03] everything, you get the Holy Ghost,
[1:06:04] you're done. That's what people would
[1:06:07] think in their natural minds. And you
[1:06:09] find out, no, no, you got to, you got to
[1:06:12] keep going. I read a beautiful scripture
[1:06:14] uh can't think it's in the Psalms and
[1:06:17] the Lord he is uh David is talking about
[1:06:21] the Lord that he gives food to uh to all
[1:06:24] these creatures in the sea you know the
[1:06:26] fish and the whales and whatever and he
[1:06:29] said you give them their meat in due
[1:06:31] season
[1:06:33] and they gather it
[1:06:36] and I thought wow even the animals they
[1:06:38] got something to do the Lord gives them
[1:06:41] their food but they got to go gather it.
[1:06:43] The Lord gave Israel the land, but they
[1:06:45] got to go take it. They got to step on
[1:06:47] it. They got to walk on it. He gives us
[1:06:49] the Holy Ghost, but we got to keep
[1:06:51] walking. We got to keep taking the land.
[1:06:53] We got to stay under prayer. We got to
[1:06:55] stay in the word.
[1:06:57] And so anyway, that was a real blessing
[1:07:00] to me to see that one. And then a great
[1:07:04] promise. I was listening to some
[1:07:08] Christian music and there's a group in
[1:07:10] Australia that puts there's a lot of
[1:07:12] groups that put psalms to song songs and
[1:07:15] they're pretty messed up but these these
[1:07:17] folks do pretty good and they put in
[1:07:20] Psalms 91 to music and I was at first
[1:07:22] time I heard it and I'm like wow that's
[1:07:25] an incredible psalm you know Psalms 91
[1:07:29] and so
[1:07:31] let me see if I've got it up here. There
[1:07:33] it is. Okay. So, this is where the Lord
[1:07:37] says,
[1:07:38] let me move this out of the way a little
[1:07:40] bit.
[1:07:44] There we go. Split my screen up properly
[1:07:47] here.
[1:07:48] Um,
[1:07:50] Matthew 6:6,
[1:07:53] he says, the Lord says, "But thou, when
[1:07:56] thou prayest, enter into your closet,
[1:07:59] and when you have shut the door,
[1:08:02] um,
[1:08:05] pray to thy father which is in secret,
[1:08:07] and your father which sees in secret
[1:08:10] shall reward thee openly."
[1:08:13] He also says in John 15, "If you abide
[1:08:16] in me and my words abide in you, you
[1:08:19] shall ask what you will and it shall be
[1:08:21] done unto you." So then I heard these
[1:08:24] words in Psalm 91
[1:08:27] says, "When you pray, enter into your
[1:08:29] secret place, your father which sees in
[1:08:31] secret shall reward thee openly." Psalms
[1:08:33] 91, he that dwelleth in the secret place
[1:08:36] of the most high.
[1:08:39] And John 15, if you abide in me, my
[1:08:41] words abide in you. Ask what you will.
[1:08:44] Uh shall abide. He that dwelleth in the
[1:08:48] secret place of the most high shall
[1:08:49] abide under the shadow of the almighty.
[1:08:52] So there's Matthew 66 and John 15:17 in
[1:08:56] Psalms 91. And there's then there's a
[1:08:58] ton of promises. Now, brother Bram said,
[1:09:00] "The secret place is the Holy Ghost."
[1:09:02] That's what brother Brandham said. But
[1:09:04] it's interesting that it's there. But
[1:09:06] secret prayer says, I will say of the
[1:09:09] Lord, he is my refuge, my fortress, my
[1:09:11] God, in him will I trust
[1:09:14] and says, he that dwelleth in the secret
[1:09:16] place shall abide under the shadow of
[1:09:17] the Almighty. And here's the promises.
[1:09:20] Surely he shall deliver thee from the
[1:09:22] snare of the fowler, and from the
[1:09:23] noisome pestilence. He shall cover thee
[1:09:26] with his feathers. Under his wings shalt
[1:09:28] thou trust. He's truth shall be thy
[1:09:31] shield and buckler.
[1:09:33] This is because the first verse. You
[1:09:36] shall not be afraid of the terror by
[1:09:38] night, nor for the arrow that flies by
[1:09:40] day, nor for the pestilence that walks
[1:09:43] in darkness, nor for the destruction
[1:09:45] that waste at noonday. A thousand shall
[1:09:47] fall at thy side. 10,000 at thy right
[1:09:50] hand that shall not come nigh thee. Only
[1:09:54] with your eyes will you behold and see
[1:09:56] the reward of the wicked. Because thou
[1:09:59] hast made the Lord, which is my refuge,
[1:10:02] even the most high thy habitation,
[1:10:06] there shall no evil befall thee, nor
[1:10:08] shall any plague come n thy dwelling.
[1:10:11] For he shall give his angels charge over
[1:10:13] thee, to keep thee in all thy ways. They
[1:10:17] shall bear thee up in their hands, lest
[1:10:19] thou dash thy foot against a stone. He
[1:10:22] shall tread upon the lion and the adder,
[1:10:25] the young lion and the dragon. Thou
[1:10:28] shalt trample under feet. The dragon,
[1:10:30] that's a good one. Because he has set
[1:10:32] his love on me, therefore will I deliver
[1:10:34] him. I will set him on high because he
[1:10:37] has known my name. The Lord speaking
[1:10:39] there. He shall call upon me, the Lord,
[1:10:43] and I will answer him. I will be with
[1:10:45] him in trouble. I will deliver him and
[1:10:48] honor him. with long life will I satisfy
[1:10:50] him and show him my salvation. Why?
[1:10:54] Because you dwelt in the secret place of
[1:10:57] the most high and abided under the
[1:10:59] shadow of the almighty.
[1:11:01] So that was very beautiful to me.
[1:11:06] Um
[1:11:07] recently we're my wife and I were in
[1:11:09] some meetings
[1:11:11] um some youth meetings and there was the
[1:11:14] host pastor
[1:11:16] was encouraging young people about
[1:11:18] prayer. Uh there was a lot of good
[1:11:21] things said about prayer, but he was
[1:11:23] just coming to close out the meetings
[1:11:25] and he said, "I suppose you wonder when
[1:11:27] the Lord when is he going to hear my
[1:11:29] prayer?" You know that I pray and he
[1:11:31] hears hour, two hours later, next week
[1:11:35] or or when will the Lord hear my prayer?
[1:11:37] And he read this quote that was just
[1:11:40] stunning. So it's brother Brandham. He I
[1:11:43] don't know I forgot where he was at. Oh,
[1:11:46] it's in Countdown,
[1:11:48] &gt;&gt; excuse me.
[1:11:49] So, Brother Brandham's under
[1:11:51] discernment.
[1:11:52] He says, "Do you believe that?" The
[1:11:55] little lady sitting there in the
[1:11:56] audience with sunglasses on. Yes. You
[1:12:00] believe that? You had some deep thoughts
[1:12:02] right then, your eyes will be healed if
[1:12:06] you believe it. Now, let me tell you,
[1:12:08] someone says out in the audience, "She's
[1:12:11] got glasses on." That's the reason he
[1:12:12] knew it. He said, "No." He said, "Look
[1:12:16] here. Come here. Not not come here. Just
[1:12:18] look at me a minute. Talking to the lady
[1:12:20] with the sunglasses that's gotten blind.
[1:12:22] Do you believe me to be his prophet or
[1:12:24] his servant?
[1:12:26] Do you believe it?
[1:12:28] You do it. You should have with them
[1:12:31] thoughts you're having. Thinking of how
[1:12:33] mysterious she was thinking. What a
[1:12:35] great revelation that was of the moon
[1:12:37] representing that. Is that right? Is
[1:12:39] that right? Raise up your hand. He said,
[1:12:42] "Now, how could I know what she was even
[1:12:45] thinking in her heart?
[1:12:47] The word of God is sharper than a
[1:12:49] two-edged sword. The discerner of the
[1:12:52] thoughts is in the heart. He tells the
[1:12:54] lady with the blind with sunglasses, now
[1:12:57] pray for somebody or do something. Here
[1:13:00] it is. Here's what pops in your head.
[1:13:04] Immediately
[1:13:06] tells her, "Think of somebody or do
[1:13:08] something." Here it is. Here's what pops
[1:13:09] in your head. Here's what's in your
[1:13:11] heart. You have two brothers that you're
[1:13:13] praying for and they're both alcoholics.
[1:13:16] If that's right, raise up your hands.
[1:13:18] All right. So, the lady had no sooner
[1:13:21] thought of her brothers than he saw it
[1:13:24] immediately.
[1:13:25] So, her prayer was instantaneous
[1:13:29] to heaven for her brothers. And Brother
[1:13:31] Brandham picked it up instantaneous.
[1:13:33] So, it was an encouragement to the young
[1:13:36] people and and even to me it's like,
[1:13:38] wow. You know, you think you pray and
[1:13:41] you know, you you kind of put it in a
[1:13:43] queue and it goes, you know, with
[1:13:44] everybody else's prayers into heaven or
[1:13:46] something. You know, human mental stuff.
[1:13:48] But the Lord knows what you pray
[1:13:50] immediately.
[1:13:52] And I've had plenty of times where
[1:13:56] I you don't feel like your prayer's
[1:13:58] getting through and then the Lord will
[1:14:00] do something to let you know he heard
[1:14:02] you. He heard you, you know. So that's
[1:14:06] great. Let me pardon me. Get a little
[1:14:08] water here.
[1:14:13] So, things that belong to us, we're
[1:14:17] still going. Healing.
[1:14:21] Okay. Deuteronomy 7:12 and then verse
[1:14:25] 15. Uh, I really love brother Brandham
[1:14:29] talked about uh first time he met
[1:14:30] brother Bosworth. There's a series
[1:14:32] called experiences like early in brother
[1:14:34] Brandham's ministry. He says, "Ah,
[1:14:37] Brother Bosworth's here. I read his book
[1:14:38] when I was a boy," which means he was a
[1:14:41] young minister. And so I I it's uh
[1:14:45] Christ the Healer, Brother Bosworth. So
[1:14:46] there's a lot of really
[1:14:49] doctrinal things in there concerning
[1:14:51] healing that um the scriptural,
[1:14:56] but some of the things he talks about,
[1:14:58] of course, is Christ uh taking from us
[1:15:01] the curse of the law. And of course, the
[1:15:03] curse of the law is if you don't do all
[1:15:05] the stuff I tell you, all the stuff that
[1:15:07] happened to the Egyptians, you know,
[1:15:09] it'll be on you. Anyway, so it's
[1:15:11] Deuteronomy 7 uh uh 12 and 15.
[1:15:17] And the Lord says, "Wherefore, if it
[1:15:19] shall come to pass, if you hearken to
[1:15:21] these judgments," it's Old Testament,
[1:15:23] "and keep them, and do them, that the
[1:15:26] Lord thy God shall keep unto thee the
[1:15:29] covenant and the mercy which you swear
[1:15:31] unto thy fathers." And 15 says, "And the
[1:15:34] Lord will take away from thee all
[1:15:36] sickness."
[1:15:40] That's all sickness.
[1:15:44] Well, I'm getting old. what I have all
[1:15:47] sickness.
[1:15:49] So he's got a definite promise
[1:15:52] and will put none of the evil diseases
[1:15:54] of Egypt which thou knowest upon thee.
[1:15:59] And part of the human experience is
[1:16:03] people don't have not even as Peter said
[1:16:08] um or it was it James said you know
[1:16:11] people were not able to keep the law you
[1:16:14] know there was um still under sin you
[1:16:18] had to have sacrifices you had to
[1:16:20] confess you had take a lamb go back out
[1:16:22] brother Ramsey your man was an adulterer
[1:16:25] he went in and he slayed a lamb he
[1:16:28] confessed his sins and He went back out
[1:16:29] and it was still in his heart. So what I
[1:16:33] love I really love uh is how do we keep
[1:16:36] his judgments and statutes that that
[1:16:38] that will they'll be and that's in
[1:16:41] Ezekiel 36 which is the baptism of the
[1:16:45] Holy Ghost. And there's the process here
[1:16:48] and I I've always loved this. Um, then I
[1:16:51] will sprinkle clean water upon you,
[1:16:54] which is the washing of the water of the
[1:16:55] word, and you shall be clean from all
[1:16:59] your filthiness, from all your idols
[1:17:01] will I cleanse you. So, he's no longer
[1:17:04] saying, "If you keep my statutes, I will
[1:17:06] cleanse you. A new heart also will I
[1:17:09] give you, and a new spirit will I put
[1:17:12] within you, and I will take away the
[1:17:14] stony heart out of your flesh, and I
[1:17:16] will give you a heart of flesh,
[1:17:18] and I will put my spirit within you and
[1:17:22] cause you to walk in my statutes, and
[1:17:25] you shall keep my judgments and do
[1:17:28] them." So the Lord Jesus, his sacrifice
[1:17:32] made it possible for the spirit in him
[1:17:35] to come back upon the believer. So it
[1:17:39] says he took away the curse of the law
[1:17:42] from us by his own blood. So these
[1:17:45] things where the Lord says you keep my
[1:17:46] covenant, he made a way for us to do it.
[1:17:49] And in that he says, "And the Lord will
[1:17:52] take away from thee all thy sickness."
[1:17:55] So there are definite promises in there
[1:17:57] and there's a lots of what are called
[1:18:00] the expressed will of God in the
[1:18:02] scripture concerning different things
[1:18:04] and there's a lot of things in there
[1:18:05] concerning sickness that he intends for
[1:18:09] us to be healed. It's just you know we
[1:18:12] got to come past unbelief
[1:18:15] and accept that from our hearts. And um
[1:18:19] I love the uh promise of the Lord means
[1:18:24] a lot. Ask and it'll be given. Seek and
[1:18:28] you'll find. Knock and it'll be open.
[1:18:31] You know, I said, "Well, I am not laying
[1:18:33] down any of these promises. I'm going to
[1:18:36] ask seek. I'm going to I'm going to
[1:18:39] knock until this comes through.
[1:18:41] Everything." That was the big thing. Uh
[1:18:44] when brother Ob preached I believe I
[1:18:46] believe the title was brides of redempt
[1:18:47] redemptive rights in Miami. I was like I
[1:18:51] don't know what they all are but I want
[1:18:52] every one of them. All those rights I
[1:18:54] had mine I am going to ask for every one
[1:18:57] of them every day. And um and he
[1:19:01] promised if we ask seek knock that we'll
[1:19:03] it'll be there. That's an absolute
[1:19:07] definite promise. There's the stuff
[1:19:10] that's
[1:19:12] prevents is uh as brother Ram says our
[1:19:15] doubts and things like that. He said the
[1:19:18] sun is always shining. Always shining.
[1:19:23] The clouds keep it from reaching the
[1:19:25] earth. He says the clouds of our
[1:19:27] unbelief and fears and doubts
[1:19:31] prevents
[1:19:32] God from shining on us. Right? and or
[1:19:35] things that we hold uh sin or iniquity,
[1:19:37] whatever we may have unconfessed.
[1:19:39] When you get the obstacles out of the
[1:19:41] way, instant sunlight. The the as
[1:19:45] Charles Finny said one time, the face of
[1:19:47] Jehovah will shine fully upon you
[1:19:50] because he's always always there willing
[1:19:52] to answer prayer, always wanting to do
[1:19:53] all these things he said he's going to
[1:19:55] do. So, that's one of the big prayers
[1:19:58] these days. Lord, I want to get the
[1:20:00] obstacles out of the way. I just want to
[1:20:02] get them out of the way.
[1:20:05] So, here we go. Next one. Um, things
[1:20:09] that belong to us, our loved ones, our
[1:20:13] families,
[1:20:15] and um,
[1:20:18] there's a quote here. It's interesting
[1:20:21] to me. Brother Brandon preached in 1960.
[1:20:25] Adoption number two is a message.
[1:20:28] And this is way before he preached the
[1:20:31] token in 1963.
[1:20:34] And I saw this, I'm like, whoa. You
[1:20:36] know, those things that the Lord kind of
[1:20:38] drops in there. Pardon me.
[1:20:45] He, Brother Bam, says, "Now, let me just
[1:20:49] drop a little token here."
[1:20:52] I'm like, "You got to be kidding me." He
[1:20:55] says the word, "Let me drop a little
[1:20:56] token here." He's not preached a token
[1:20:58] yet. That's like three years down the
[1:21:00] road. Let me drop a little token here
[1:21:03] that I touched on the other night to you
[1:21:04] mothers.
[1:21:06] How many here has prayed for your loved
[1:21:08] ones lost? All right, there you are.
[1:21:12] See, he's it's your inheritance. That's
[1:21:16] what he's talking about, your
[1:21:17] inheritance.
[1:21:19] Paul told the Roman, he said, "Believe
[1:21:22] on the Lord Jesus Christ. Thou and thy
[1:21:25] house shall be saved. and thou thy house
[1:21:27] shall be saved.
[1:21:29] If you, and brother Bram says, if you
[1:21:31] got faith enough for your own self to be
[1:21:34] saved, have faith enough, no matter how
[1:21:37] wavered that boy is, and I mean they can
[1:21:40] get wewarded big time, or that girl is,
[1:21:44] they'll be saved anyhow.
[1:21:47] God somehow if he has to lay them on
[1:21:50] their back laying there in the hospital
[1:21:52] dying,
[1:21:54] they'll be saved.
[1:21:56] God promised it the inheritance.
[1:22:00] Oh, and they shall be there, said
[1:22:02] Isaiah, with all their offsprings with
[1:22:05] them. They shall not hurt nor destroy in
[1:22:07] all my holy mountain, sayeth the Lord.
[1:22:10] So in the Bible, and the Lord's word,
[1:22:14] there again are things that he does as a
[1:22:18] way to say, "This is my expressed intent
[1:22:21] and will."
[1:22:23] And sometimes we read them as stories,
[1:22:26] but in fact he's expressing his will for
[1:22:29] the believer.
[1:22:31] And so
[1:22:34] those things those those things that are
[1:22:35] in the Bible are expressing what he
[1:22:37] wants to do for us as believers. So we
[1:22:41] are to take that as thus sayith the Lord
[1:22:43] and move forward with it.
[1:22:46] So here's where he says in the token
[1:22:48] itself in 1963. Here is what you want to
[1:22:51] believe for. See, you want your own
[1:22:54] safety.
[1:22:55] You believe for your safety. So, you
[1:22:58] know, in the aircraft, they tell you,
[1:23:00] "Hey, at the, you know, the oxygen goes
[1:23:02] out, you got children, you pull the mask
[1:23:05] down, put it on yourself, then put it on
[1:23:08] your children, right?" So, it's kind of
[1:23:10] the same thing. It's like,
[1:23:13] um, you believe for your safety and then
[1:23:17] apply the token for the whole family.
[1:23:20] You say, "How can I do that?" Claim it.
[1:23:23] Exclamation point. If it worked on you,
[1:23:26] then you and the word becomes one. Amen.
[1:23:29] Amen. See, it works for both of you. You
[1:23:33] and your children. You and the word are
[1:23:37] one. Then apply it to your children.
[1:23:40] Apply it capital I to your loved ones.
[1:23:45] So those both of those were beautiful.
[1:23:48] Uh, of course, the Lord being infinite
[1:23:52] dropped in in 1960,
[1:23:55] you know, let me give you a little token
[1:23:56] before he even come up with the message.
[1:23:59] So, I always love those little things
[1:24:01] the Lord does like that.
[1:24:03] So, like I said, God's words, he has
[1:24:06] expressed his will concerning the
[1:24:07] believer's family uh in the Bible,
[1:24:10] Rahab, which we hear about often. And uh
[1:24:15] I went back and read this dear sister's
[1:24:18] words recently and wow I never saw what
[1:24:21] she said really hear the story you know
[1:24:24] since I was a kid but Rahab said to the
[1:24:27] spies after she had hid them and
[1:24:30] everything said now therefore I pray you
[1:24:34] swear and she's speaking to the two
[1:24:35] spies she had hidden I I pray you swear
[1:24:39] unto me by the Lord since I have showed
[1:24:42] you kindness
[1:24:44] that you will also show kindness unto my
[1:24:46] father's house and give me a true token.
[1:24:52] And listen to this. That you will save
[1:24:55] alive and that you will save alive my
[1:24:58] father,
[1:24:59] my mother,
[1:25:01] my brethren,
[1:25:03] my sisters, and all that they have. So
[1:25:06] she just extended the family out into
[1:25:09] nieces, nephews.
[1:25:11] This lady did not stop the list. It's
[1:25:13] like my mother, my father, my brother,
[1:25:14] sisters, and everything they got. Save
[1:25:17] him alive and deliver our lives from
[1:25:19] death.
[1:25:21] And when the walls, of course, everybody
[1:25:22] knows Jericho fell. Joshua,
[1:25:25] representative of the Holy Spirit, said,
[1:25:28] "Go get Rahab."
[1:25:30] And man, I don't know how big her house
[1:25:32] was, but I'm sure it was packed.
[1:25:35] And I loved that. I was like, "Wow, God
[1:25:36] bless you, my sister. Man, you you you
[1:25:39] know, it's like don't stop. name
[1:25:40] everybody. Claim everybody. I really
[1:25:43] love that. And then then in um that's in
[1:25:48] Joshua 212 through13. And then another
[1:25:51] one I love, we've all heard the story of
[1:25:53] Cornelius. Uh Cornelius tells Peter his
[1:25:57] story. There's this the story of it
[1:25:58] first. Then Cornelius tells Peter and
[1:26:01] then Peter goes to Jerusalem to report
[1:26:03] because they're like, "Hey, you've been
[1:26:04] in with Gentiles, you know." And he goes
[1:26:06] back to report to the church in
[1:26:08] Jerusalem. When Peter
[1:26:11] tells the story,
[1:26:13] it's kind of a third time. And he Peter
[1:26:16] speaking, Cornelius showed us how he had
[1:26:20] seen an angel in his house,
[1:26:23] which stood and said unto him, "Send
[1:26:26] Meter to Japa. Uh, send men to Japa.
[1:26:30] Call for Simon whose surname is Peter.
[1:26:35] Who shall tell thee words?"
[1:26:38] I love this. Whereby thou and all thy
[1:26:41] house shall be saved. This is a this is
[1:26:45] not Rahab saying I can you save her. No,
[1:26:48] this is the Lord telling him
[1:26:53] you go send to Peter and he'll tell you
[1:26:55] how you and your whole house are going
[1:26:56] to be saved.
[1:26:58] So he didn't he didn't say Lord would
[1:27:00] you save my whole you know maybe he was
[1:27:01] praying part of that I don't know and
[1:27:03] Peter says
[1:27:06] whereby thou now thou house shall be
[1:27:08] saved then Peter says as I began to
[1:27:11] speak the Holy Ghost fell on them
[1:27:15] as on us at the beginning.
[1:27:18] So how were they saved?
[1:27:22] The Holy Ghost fell on them. He said
[1:27:24] show them how they will be saved. So the
[1:27:27] Holy Ghost is salvation.
[1:27:31] So,
[1:27:33] so that was very beautiful and I love
[1:27:35] those things. All of us have had or
[1:27:41] you know currently have wavered
[1:27:44] children. Uh and it's it's tough. It's
[1:27:47] really tough. We had some really tough
[1:27:49] times. But it's just such a beautiful
[1:27:51] thing that I uh things can be very very
[1:27:55] painful when your loved ones are out
[1:27:56] there in impossible looking situations
[1:28:00] and you just have this calm confidence
[1:28:02] that man the God who saved me can save
[1:28:05] them. There's no no question no
[1:28:07] question. the worst thing like seconds.
[1:28:10] I love uh non the Syrian when he was uh
[1:28:15] uh Elisha told him go and you know dunk
[1:28:19] yourself seven times dip yourself seven
[1:28:21] times in the Jordan. Of course he
[1:28:23] complained. The servant said sir you
[1:28:24] know you would do that in Syria. Why
[1:28:25] don't you just do what the man says? And
[1:28:28] he goes down seven times comes up. It
[1:28:30] doesn't say he screamed. It doesn't say
[1:28:31] he felt anything. He just come up and he
[1:28:33] was clean instantaneously.
[1:28:36] And that's the way I see the Lord can do
[1:28:38] with those where we're children, there's
[1:28:41] he's capable of doing that.
[1:28:44] So the same way um when someone is um
[1:28:48] born again, it's like it's it's amazing
[1:28:51] what happens. Anyway, let's move on
[1:28:53] then. So
[1:28:57] this next one
[1:29:00] um is somewhat of a testimony.
[1:29:04] In the next one, things that belong to
[1:29:07] us is uh adoption.
[1:29:11] And that again is often
[1:29:15] humanly I think
[1:29:18] I love so much that brother Random said
[1:29:21] the Lord interprets his word by
[1:29:23] manifesting it.
[1:29:26] And that frees me so much. I don't have
[1:29:30] to figure out what it's going to happen.
[1:29:31] I just have to see it in the word,
[1:29:33] believe for it, trust the Lord for it,
[1:29:35] walk in the light. As I walk in the
[1:29:37] light, he reveals me more. Right? So
[1:29:43] I think um
[1:29:47] you know he the Lord said when he was a
[1:29:50] young boy and his mother and father came
[1:29:53] looking for him, don't you know I should
[1:29:54] be I'm should be about my father's I
[1:29:56] would be about my father's business.
[1:29:59] And so, um,
[1:30:03] I was thinking, this is maybe a poor
[1:30:05] example, but I have, um, men, local
[1:30:08] business owners here. I know of one and
[1:30:11] another who's in the same situation. Uh,
[1:30:14] has amazing local businesses, a garden
[1:30:17] center, and some other things that were
[1:30:18] really, really needed in the community.
[1:30:21] They had no heirs. They had no son to
[1:30:25] step in. And one of them's already
[1:30:28] closed to business.
[1:30:29] and the other one I don't know and
[1:30:31] they're they're really places that are
[1:30:33] need in the community and they had and
[1:30:36] the one is three generations and there's
[1:30:38] no fourth generation to take that
[1:30:39] business forward.
[1:30:41] So it's almost like my friend that took
[1:30:45] over when his father passed was placed
[1:30:49] in his father's business. Those are
[1:30:51] natural
[1:30:53] uh examples of that sort of thing.
[1:30:56] So the Lord said early on with Adam,
[1:31:00] "Let us make man in our image, after our
[1:31:02] likeness. Let them have dominion over
[1:31:04] the fish, over the sea, the fowl of the
[1:31:07] air, over the cattle, over all the
[1:31:09] earth, over every creeping thing that
[1:31:11] creeps upon the earth." So you would say
[1:31:16] he had a son that he could put on earth
[1:31:18] to take care of those things, to take
[1:31:20] care of the garden, to tell uh brother
[1:31:21] Olu said he had work. he had worked. So
[1:31:26] he had placed the sun on the earth to
[1:31:28] take care of if you will that part of
[1:31:30] that business dominion over the earth.
[1:31:34] So in saying that
[1:31:38] um I read a quote a few years ago and
[1:31:42] it's one we know very well
[1:31:46] and um he says in what is the Holy Ghost
[1:31:51] given for God is waiting on me and you
[1:31:55] the church is waiting on me and you
[1:31:58] adoption time when God can pour
[1:32:03] into us his fullness.
[1:32:06] And I looked at that his power and his
[1:32:08] resurrection.
[1:32:11] I looked at that I says when he when he
[1:32:13] can pour. So the idea was at that time
[1:32:17] he could not.
[1:32:19] And I was like why couldn't he go his
[1:32:24] power, his fullness, his resurrection.
[1:32:27] So Christ and church become so close
[1:32:29] together. Christ becomes visible among
[1:32:31] us and raised the dead. we go in the
[1:32:32] rapture cuz he's saying basically he
[1:32:35] can't do it right now when he preached
[1:32:37] this and obviously we've seen pretty
[1:32:40] much the same thing up through the day
[1:32:42] through the years. So I said, "Okay,
[1:32:44] what what is it that he's not able to
[1:32:48] adopt in the church?"
[1:32:50] And reading and reading and reading, I
[1:32:52] began to see that consistently the
[1:32:55] reason was, "Brother Ram, because of
[1:32:58] disputes and divisions in the church and
[1:33:02] I thought it was all kinds of other
[1:33:04] things, but he's preaching here ye him."
[1:33:08] Uh he's preaching on adoption.
[1:33:12] And he says, 'N no wonder the church
[1:33:13] hasn't got one great growth constantly
[1:33:16] going. He cannot get his children to
[1:33:19] stand still long enough. One says, I
[1:33:22] won't have anything to do with that. My
[1:33:24] church not cooperating. I'll just leave
[1:33:27] leave out of the picture. That's where
[1:33:30] you get in trouble. My denomination, I'm
[1:33:33] a Presbyterian. We're not affiliated
[1:33:35] with that. So I could not even go to
[1:33:38] such a meeting. Oh my. And those were
[1:33:41] denominations, right? But that continues
[1:33:44] on into where we're at today.
[1:33:47] And again, and here you Oh my, how God
[1:33:50] wants to take his church today and adopt
[1:33:52] it. He's give it birth.
[1:33:56] Now he wants to adopt it.
[1:33:59] These people with the birth, but we just
[1:34:02] won't stand still. If it raises up
[1:34:06] amongst the Methodists, the Baptist have
[1:34:08] nothing to do with it. raises up amongst
[1:34:10] one church, the other one had nothing to
[1:34:12] do with it. It's a twist and a twirl. So
[1:34:14] there's this thing of and so it
[1:34:17] surprised me. I thought it would be much
[1:34:20] different reasons,
[1:34:21] but it was divisions.
[1:34:24] And so any I had these things. This is
[1:34:26] like two or three years. Two years ago
[1:34:27] at least I started studying this and I
[1:34:30] thought someday you know I might you
[1:34:33] know have one of these talks I would Why
[1:34:35] are we not adopted?
[1:34:38] So I never got there. But anyway, I had
[1:34:40] these quotes on the side. So there is um
[1:34:46] there's so I had a journey the Lord has
[1:34:49] brought me on as a individual
[1:34:52] that
[1:34:54] um he showed me that I had some of these
[1:34:57] problems
[1:34:59] and uh it's been quite a journey. I am
[1:35:02] going to refer to some very precious
[1:35:04] brethren. I won't name or name the
[1:35:07] church or nothing. Um I um ask if the
[1:35:12] dear brethren, I mean they're stunningly
[1:35:15] precious to me. If they hear this, this
[1:35:17] is an apology,
[1:35:19] a confession. Um I had a wrong attitude
[1:35:24] uh about some things. And talk about
[1:35:27] grace that we have a Lord who will say,
[1:35:30] "Hey, you know, let me turn the light on
[1:35:33] here. You got a problem." and walk us
[1:35:35] through and deliver us from things.
[1:35:39] So I will say brother Random himself uh
[1:35:44] as brother Oid often says here's a man
[1:35:46] with the Holy Ghost a prophet
[1:35:49] and he has he's condemning somebody and
[1:35:52] the the you remember in the juke joint
[1:35:54] you know the lady with the painted and
[1:35:55] he's with two men and uh and he said
[1:35:59] Lord how do you even let stuff like that
[1:36:00] live you know and the Lord pulled had to
[1:36:04] pull him aside and show him what he was
[1:36:06] doing and condemning that woman and also
[1:36:10] of course about sincerity that u a man
[1:36:14] holy ghost prophet and the lord had to
[1:36:16] show him you're not sincere enough so
[1:36:18] there's these things of growth
[1:36:20] constantly in the believer
[1:36:24] so
[1:36:25] so I was again in a similar situation
[1:36:30] unconsciously in some ways
[1:36:33] um so I want to say a little bit of my
[1:36:36] history and she know, you know, talked
[1:36:38] about the man who um told me about the
[1:36:41] message and he was had been a minister.
[1:36:45] He had known brother Brandham, you know,
[1:36:47] as ministers. The Lord even told him it
[1:36:50] was Elijah. But yet he didn't know the
[1:36:52] depth of what it was that brother
[1:36:54] Brandham was until after he retired. And
[1:36:57] he wrote to brother Billy Paul in the
[1:36:59] 1980s, "Hey, is there anything left from
[1:37:01] your dad's ministry?"
[1:37:03] He got a whole bunch of books. And
[1:37:05] anyway, all that started. So the Lord
[1:37:07] had me in his care in the beginning and
[1:37:10] we were in prayer meetings and he was
[1:37:12] sort of a mentor and he was about 73 or
[1:37:15] 75 in 1986
[1:37:19] 85 86 somewhere in there. And so when
[1:37:23] this uh Bible study broke up, then he uh
[1:37:29] said, "Hey, there's a church in Fort
[1:37:31] Wayne." Cuz he knew I needed to go
[1:37:33] somewhere. So we went down there
[1:37:36] together, he took me uh down there and
[1:37:39] this this was brother Tommy Dillard's
[1:37:41] church. And so an interesting thing, the
[1:37:45] brother that uh that had been the
[1:37:48] minister in Assembly of God for 30
[1:37:49] years, he actually had pioneered that
[1:37:52] church that brother Diller was now in.
[1:37:56] He had started an Assembly of God church
[1:37:58] there originally. And so it's almost
[1:38:00] like a baton handing off like brother um
[1:38:07] okay thank you.
[1:38:10] So
[1:38:12] um so anyway, I've always been in a
[1:38:16] seven thunder church from the very
[1:38:18] beginning and almost immediately
[1:38:21] um there was a
[1:38:25] something there that was in the air
[1:38:28] amongst all of us that was we are it
[1:38:31] you know it's our group we have it and
[1:38:35] they don't have it you know and almost
[1:38:39] unconsciously I don't recall people
[1:38:41] speaking it, but it was that way. And so
[1:38:45] going church to church here and there as
[1:38:47] things happened, I came out of that um
[1:38:53] and um you know all the things that
[1:38:55] happened in New York and everything, but
[1:38:58] I still thought of group of us and not
[1:39:02] them and we do it this way and you know
[1:39:04] I'm a dirtber
[1:39:06] you know and I'm thinking they don't do
[1:39:09] like me. they don't do like us. And it
[1:39:12] was a bad attitude. So we visited a
[1:39:14] church about 10 years ago and I was
[1:39:18] sitting there and looking back I was
[1:39:21] sort of sitting in the seat of the
[1:39:22] scornful and I was saying well they they
[1:39:24] don't they don't preach like us like I
[1:39:27] did anything. uh they don't do they're
[1:39:30] not I still had this group thing from my
[1:39:33] experience
[1:39:35] back with uh just the brethren that I
[1:39:39] was with and everything. Um there was
[1:39:42] just a lot of uh immature things and I
[1:39:46] was amongst that.
[1:39:49] And so I had a poor attitude when I
[1:39:52] walked into that church. And so, but the
[1:39:55] Lord began dealing with me and he said,
[1:39:58] um, one thing that happened was that
[1:40:00] brother Oid
[1:40:03] uh,
[1:40:04] invited brother Albert Green to preach
[1:40:07] uh, there at Hesone Tabernacle.
[1:40:10] And prior to that, again, it's childish
[1:40:13] things, right? But prior to that, the
[1:40:16] just the general thing was amongst
[1:40:18] people, if you didn't preach in our
[1:40:20] conventions,
[1:40:21] you're not it.
[1:40:24] And it's very childish. But so it's just
[1:40:27] like this weird thing of
[1:40:31] ministers must be one of us.
[1:40:34] Brother Albert Green preached and I was
[1:40:37] so blown away and I was like, "Oh my
[1:40:40] goodness." It's like suddenly the lights
[1:40:42] come on that God is sovereign and he can
[1:40:46] have anybody
[1:40:48] preach. He He can do whatever he wants
[1:40:50] to with anybody. And I was so blessed
[1:40:53] and I wrote brother over wow this is
[1:40:55] like an early Christmas present you know
[1:40:58] what a tremendous you know I said man
[1:41:00] what other who you know what else does
[1:41:03] God have out there in the bushes you
[1:41:04] know those you know ministers the rams
[1:41:06] and my thinking began to open up at that
[1:41:09] point and uh it became evident that um I
[1:41:13] told brother O says I'd realized then I
[1:41:16] still have this groups the group saying
[1:41:20] going on if they're not with us. They're
[1:41:22] not us. And the Lord totally blew that
[1:41:24] out of the water with brother Albert
[1:41:26] Green. And I was began to go free.
[1:41:30] So it was a process that was obviously
[1:41:33] some years ago in this church that I was
[1:41:36] speaking of setting in. And again to the
[1:41:38] brethren who may hear this, I I
[1:41:40] apologize. I had a bad No, I just I
[1:41:44] wasn't I wasn't cruel, rude or anything.
[1:41:47] It was still brothers, right? but
[1:41:48] interior things that were hid that the
[1:41:50] Lord revealing. Well, last year we went
[1:41:53] to a fellowship and I spoke to the man
[1:41:58] who had just re sort of stepped aside as
[1:42:01] elder because he's up in his 80s. He's
[1:42:03] like 87 now. And he I was thanking him.
[1:42:08] Thank you for letting my wife and I
[1:42:09] come. And they're always welcome. They
[1:42:12] never act like who are they or nothing.
[1:42:14] They had no heirs, nothing. Just
[1:42:16] brotherly love all the way. And I
[1:42:18] thanked him for letting us come and
[1:42:20] we're just 5 minutes
[1:42:23] and I began to tell him my testimony how
[1:42:26] that I began to pray and so forth and
[1:42:28] confess my sins and and I said
[1:42:30] everything went away. Uh the Lord took
[1:42:32] it all and he interrupted me and said
[1:42:34] that's a conversion. He said it doesn't
[1:42:36] happen have to happen in a church. Mine
[1:42:39] happened in a barn and we just had youth
[1:42:42] me. They had their youth meetings just
[1:42:44] prior to that. He said that's what these
[1:42:46] young people need. They need an
[1:42:47] encounter with God. And I tell you what,
[1:42:51] it is very, very difficult to describe
[1:42:54] what happened right then. I saw in that
[1:42:56] man's eyes uh a look that I still have a
[1:43:00] hard time not tearing up, the the depth
[1:43:03] of burden for the people, the the love
[1:43:06] of God in that man for them. And I had
[1:43:09] such an experience. I walked away from
[1:43:11] there and I I I knew that man was my
[1:43:15] brother. I knew I was going to see that
[1:43:17] man in glory and it was shaking and I
[1:43:22] was just completely changed by five
[1:43:24] minutes with that dear brother and I was
[1:43:28] really so much changed. I said, "What
[1:43:31] was that? What was that? This is
[1:43:34] stunning." And um then here we go. Got a
[1:43:38] few minutes. Brother Olu. Then after
[1:43:41] that, brother uh Ol put on the tape of
[1:43:44] Brother Olu, the unity of the spirit.
[1:43:48] And and he began to talk about unity of
[1:43:50] spirit leading to the unity of the
[1:43:52] faith.
[1:43:53] And I had that quote here somewhere.
[1:43:59] Nope. I think I must have deleted it.
[1:44:01] But brother Brandon talks about it. Oh,
[1:44:02] here it is. Bless every organization in
[1:44:04] the valley. Brother Bham, all the
[1:44:06] blessed people, the ministers, the
[1:44:08] pastors of different denominations.
[1:44:10] Maybe we might disagree upon some
[1:44:12] theological teachings of the scripture.
[1:44:16] But father, all in one principle, we
[1:44:20] believe in God, the eternal one. So help
[1:44:22] us, Lord, to have the unity of the
[1:44:25] spirit until the unity of the faith is
[1:44:28] brought. And uh you know, the words it
[1:44:32] blew my mind. I was like, "Oh my
[1:44:34] goodness, unity of the spirit." So I
[1:44:38] said, "That must have been what happened
[1:44:40] between me and this dear pastor."
[1:44:43] Because in my thought, well, we weren't
[1:44:45] exactly the same and some things we
[1:44:48] believe maybe, but that man was my
[1:44:50] brother. And it it struck me so hard
[1:44:52] when brother Olu preached that. And I
[1:44:54] was I was shocked just after this
[1:44:57] experience with the brother. Brother Olu
[1:44:59] preached this and that message from
[1:45:01] Brother Olu. There's it's one of those
[1:45:04] that I did not walk away the same man.
[1:45:08] And uh I listened to it just recently.
[1:45:10] It's just so stunning. And I saw though
[1:45:13] because he's saying we need to deal with
[1:45:15] this this unity of the spirit thing. It
[1:45:18] must be dealt with. And I was thinking
[1:45:21] there will be with every revival there's
[1:45:23] twins because union of the spirit is
[1:45:26] capital S spirit. And then there are uh
[1:45:30] people will say, "Oh, wow. We really
[1:45:33] should love each other,
[1:45:36] you know, in the natural." And so it's
[1:45:37] going to be that group and it's going to
[1:45:39] be real unity of the spirit cuz I I
[1:45:44] could just see it. People going to hear
[1:45:45] this and they're going to criticize or
[1:45:47] they're going to go the other way in the
[1:45:48] natural side or they're going to say in
[1:45:50] the with the Holy Spirit. My goodness.
[1:45:54] So either way, he also talked about
[1:45:56] seven thunder under you know he said the
[1:45:59] seven thunders gather the bride
[1:46:00] together. He said what does that produce
[1:46:02] but clicks
[1:46:04] you know and I said wow that's right
[1:46:06] because we're thinking group
[1:46:09] and I suddenly saw the seventh
[1:46:12] um um you know gathered the group
[1:46:15] together um was the body of Christ. It
[1:46:20] wasn't a specific
[1:46:22] group of people in a specific church.
[1:46:26] So it was a big big change.
[1:46:29] So then I'm getting ready to wrap it up.
[1:46:33] Brother O here real quick. So the other
[1:46:38] last May 30th I think it was I we had
[1:46:40] prayer meeting. Brother Oid uh I had I
[1:46:43] had to miss it because I had to take an
[1:46:45] important phone call from a loved one
[1:46:46] that was uh had some struggling. And
[1:46:49] anyway, so I was listening to it later.
[1:46:51] I was coming out of work. I had on my
[1:46:53] special little headset and I'm just
[1:46:56] listening to brother Oid read this quote
[1:46:58] and I remember I was pulling out of my
[1:47:00] workplace into the street and he's
[1:47:03] talking about the church is fighting.
[1:47:05] Brother Brandham is and calling one
[1:47:07] another bad names and everything. And
[1:47:09] I'm driving along. He says they don't
[1:47:10] even have respect for one another. They
[1:47:12] haven't even got they haven't got any
[1:47:14] decency for each other. And I heard
[1:47:17] decency and I was arrested on the street
[1:47:22] driving and like I was like what? What
[1:47:26] did he say? And just decency just boomed
[1:47:32] and I said I got to ask brother O for
[1:47:35] the notes. So I wrote brother O. He gave
[1:47:37] me the notes and he's talking about
[1:47:42] uh churches that don't have no love.
[1:47:43] They're fussing at one another. You're
[1:47:45] oneness. We're threesess. You're this.
[1:47:46] You're that. I belong to the assemblies.
[1:47:49] Forgive me all my brethren. I belong to
[1:47:52] the thunders. That's what I used to say.
[1:47:54] You know, you're not me. You're, you
[1:47:56] know, calling one another. Bad name,
[1:47:58] other bad name. And the world turns
[1:48:00] around and says, "What's the matter with
[1:48:01] them people? Both of them speaking in
[1:48:04] tongues. They're in church. Everything.
[1:48:05] This one over here at this church, they
[1:48:08] don't even respect one another. They
[1:48:11] haven't got any decency for each other.
[1:48:14] And something struck me and I said,
[1:48:16] "Yeah, so holy decency has more to do,
[1:48:22] it also has to do with teaching your bre
[1:48:25] treating your brethren with respect and
[1:48:27] decency,
[1:48:29] no matter what they believe."
[1:48:31] And not just, you know, decency, how we
[1:48:33] dress her up here. And I tell you, that
[1:48:36] turned over and over and over in me. And
[1:48:39] I was stunned because we've all heard
[1:48:41] the quote, "When the church finds its
[1:48:42] holy decency, brotherly love, place in
[1:48:44] Christ." So then we were invited to more
[1:48:48] meetings back to this church. I was
[1:48:50] there as a person who believes the
[1:48:54] thunders, right? I'm always on guard
[1:48:57] because there's a lot of bad behaviors
[1:48:59] in the thunders as everyone knows
[1:49:02] um because twins and revival, right? And
[1:49:06] so I was always on guard. But I sat
[1:49:07] there in those meetings and we were two
[1:49:10] two two different brothers were
[1:49:12] preaching and I said, 'You know, the
[1:49:14] Lord wants me to have respect and
[1:49:18] decency toward these brethren. And man,
[1:49:21] I went boom free like that. And I was
[1:49:25] totally relaxed. I tell you, I the
[1:49:27] brothers, they they really blew my mind.
[1:49:29] I tell you, they were just stunning.
[1:49:31] some of uh the best this one brother
[1:49:34] he's older about 70 he preached on the
[1:49:37] effects of praise in a Christian life
[1:49:40] and he's kind of like brother um um
[1:49:44] brother Chandler in the sense that he
[1:49:46] had scriptures and it was so powerful
[1:49:48] because everything he's saying he's got
[1:49:49] a scripture flashing behind it and so
[1:49:52] anyway long story short it was just a
[1:49:54] tremendous time
[1:49:56] so I was think of saying and finishing
[1:50:00] here Paul said, "When I was a child, I
[1:50:02] thank as a child. I thought as a child,
[1:50:04] but when I become a man, I pulled off
[1:50:06] childish things." And that's the last of
[1:50:10] my thing here is a testimony of I am so
[1:50:14] grateful that the Lord allowed me to put
[1:50:17] off this childish thing of viewing other
[1:50:21] brethren a wrong way. Um, you know, u
[1:50:27] different group or whatever. Um, it's
[1:50:30] been a completely different ride. I'll
[1:50:32] get an opportunity to talk to them soon,
[1:50:34] these brethren, and explain to them
[1:50:35] maybe face to say, face the Lord allows
[1:50:39] and say how much I love them. And I tell
[1:50:42] you, they are so precious and they
[1:50:44] really are, and I'm grateful to be free
[1:50:46] from this thing. Anyway, God bless you.
[1:50:48] I'm going to stop here, but thank you so
[1:50:51] much for allowing me to share a little
[1:50:52] bit. I'm very, very grateful. God bless
[1:50:55] you.

[1:50:57] Kelly. uh brother out. We appreciate
[1:50:59] what you share tonight and I trust it

[1:51:05] prayer. Heavenly Father, we thank you

[1:51:36] with us in a special way and poor to
[1:51:38] richest blessing. The bride is the
[1:51:40] sickest body the prophet spoke of. And

[1:51:44] your supernatural in intervention. Lord,
