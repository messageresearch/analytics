[47:07] coming to church it's getting the
[47:09] perfection getting to the your place in
[47:12] christ
[47:14] you have to want that
[47:16] you have to desire that
[47:18] okay let's go
[47:22] [Music]
[47:25] [Applause]
[47:27] that's what the church
[47:30] if it's in order set in order
[47:32] it got the mechanics ready
[47:34] it only needs then the dynamics
[47:37] tonight
[47:38] if we will get the mechanics ready
[47:41] now this is the problem we could talk
[47:43] about mechanics word
[47:45] and mysteries like if you have to know
[47:47] everything
[47:48] but you say you do have to know all the
[47:49] mechanics
[47:50] i am as a mechanic
[47:52] i know when you take the key
[47:54] until the car
[47:55] if it had tumbled you had a call for a
[47:57] mechanic
[47:58] to fix that
[48:00] all i want to know is the tumble
[48:02] and put it in d
[48:03] and press drive
[48:05] as long as it breaks and the x working i
[48:07] get in somewhere
[48:09] if i have no gas i have no place to go
[48:11] if i have no tires i have no place to go
[48:14] and have to have that mechanical things
[48:15] are wrong and set in order to go it have
[48:18] man with car and have no engine in it
[48:21] the about the bonnet clothes don't you
[48:22] don't know that if you're running and
[48:24] trying to defeat you have none of the
[48:25] teeth because if they're going nowhere
[48:27] there is no engine when you turn the key
[48:29] you hear nothing because there is no
[48:31] battery there is no engine there so if
[48:34] it's in me for the rapture when that key
[48:36] turned it has had something inside of
[48:38] there and that engine that god have to
[48:41] put inside of you is faith
[48:43] virtue
[48:44] knowledge
[48:46] temperance patience godliness brotherly
[48:49] kindness and the love of god and when
[48:52] that key turned inside the deer not
[48:53] devil can hold you down that's the
[48:55] square that hold your body tongue not
[48:57] even sickness could hold your body
[48:59] tongue not even gray hair not even
[49:02] crippled if you're crippled here you're
[49:04] walking across there is your gray hair
[49:06] here you're black here across there oh
[49:08] give the lord a shout
[49:10] oh god have mercy
[49:12] oh glory to god hallelujah
[49:15] [Applause]
[49:18] glory to god you want to test the engine
[49:20] to see the tumbling god want a bunch of
[49:24] engine tumblers oh glory to god
[49:26] hallelujah hallelujah and a lot of
[49:29] things go with engine
[49:31] oh hallelujah and then you have the
[49:32] battery and you have the right power
[49:34] battery too the carpet has six volt
[49:36] battery a small battery to power a big
[49:38] engine that can't work the battery
[49:40] lights lights and torch lights and what
[49:42] kind of dim light and whatnot but not
[49:43] that engine so you have to get the right
[49:45] engine you can't get a looter on battery
[49:48] and drop it on this bright message you
[49:50] can't come and get a pentecostal battery
[49:52] and drive on this message he said no
[49:54] other life would work
[49:56] nothing else with work who isn't wanting
[49:58] after work is the dynamics to the
[50:01] mechanics you can't bring some some
[50:03] so-called prophet an apostle and so call
[50:06] man of the hour and answer this car
[50:09] because no man can make a revival
[50:11] god put it in the word to let you know
[50:14] no man can bring it so i don't care if
[50:16] the congregation believed that is the
[50:17] man that is the only man and one man and
[50:19] look at the nonsense it can't work
[50:21] because the prophet said it can't work
[50:23] oh glory to call it will take the people
[50:26] and that's talking about you
[50:27] you have got to see something something
[50:30] bigger than you something more powerful
[50:32] than you somehow make you extend
[50:34] yourself to press on in god and act upon
[50:37] his word
[50:38] to shake off the flesh to shake off
[50:40] yourself oh glory to god
[50:44] hallelujah hallelujah
[50:46] tonight
[50:47] so he's not talking about mysteries here
[50:49] now
[50:50] listen
[50:50] to how the prophet bring the balance and
[50:52] bring it now with us
[50:55] see mysteries word you're hearing and so
[50:57] on here this
[50:58] if we get the mechanics ready
[51:00] get our hearts right
[51:05] you mean guys mechanics too yes
[51:09] get in your heart right
[51:11] the things
[51:13] that we can do
[51:15] you see that there are certain things
[51:16] only you can do
[51:18] the past i can't do it for you
[51:21] not even your husband could do it for
[51:22] you
[51:23] your wife can't do it for you it is
[51:26] things that you
[51:28] have to do
[51:31] you could renounce evil
[51:33] you could renounce
[51:35] hypocrisy you could reject hatred and
[51:38] jealousy you could be not i say lord i i
[51:40] dismiss that i i have no ought against
[51:42] anybody i drop it you could you could
[51:44] you could do something about that
[51:46] god can't come now and clean your land
[51:50] if you're lazy i want to trust you
[51:52] chelsea like it's some farm i'll try and
[51:53] see they'll lose everything
[51:55] because just waiting watching through
[51:57] and the bush could catch it and
[51:58] something like that you have to clean
[52:00] land
[52:01] then put seed on
[52:02] hallelujah and then water the sea too
[52:05] god have a law
[52:06] that lawyer changes from nobody
[52:09] and he put the word as a seed
[52:11] and if you are bushing your heart and
[52:13] corruption in your heart how that sees
[52:15] it in the ground so god have to get them
[52:17] rocks out your system
[52:19] that's what they get the church for for
[52:21] the world to lock you
[52:23] for the road to grab you and dig out
[52:25] things out of your life
[52:26] glory to god and that seeker drop down
[52:28] in your soul

[55:17] that we can do
[55:19] follow every word
[55:21] follow him baptism
[55:23] follow him in every order that he told
[55:24] us to do
[55:25] get every mechanic ready he identified
[55:28] these things as a mechanic
[55:30] so these are not really passed any
[55:32] change and that's which thee and them up
[55:34] there and them who them
[55:35] me i am them
[55:37] don't get fight with me you know is it
[55:38] worth preaching
[55:40] so let me just slip out easy easy easy
[55:42] and hear you the word of the lord
[55:44] if i preach in my thoughts and dreams
[55:45] there's a different thing
[55:47] you can see you hear what brother do you
[55:48] say he dreamed last night i ain't
[55:49] dreaming nothing last night
[55:51] i sleep strong last night
[55:53] i come here giving you word not dream
[55:55] i come in here with your word
[55:57] man channeling my bread alone but by
[56:00] every
[56:00] word i dream about your faults go and
[56:03] dream again
[56:05] that's not the word
[56:06] god they gave me that dream there was
[56:08] give people a dream to you know and hold
[56:10] on to the dream
[56:11] they see this and they see that and they
[56:12] got my word to see
[56:13] gotta go like what god say
[56:15] no vision you don't need a vision you
[56:17] need the word
[56:18] and then go go drop down your heart
[56:19] let's read it here follow him in every
[56:21] order that he told us to do get every
[56:23] mechanic ready and stand here
[56:26] then we are ready for the dynamics to be
[56:28] lit off and only god can do that
[56:31] and that is to drop into your heart that
[56:34] faith that says i am now healed
[56:37] only
[56:39] god can do that
[56:41] so i realize now that when people don't
[56:43] do all that they're supposed to do they
[56:45] just
[56:46] wouldn't have the confidence
[56:48] in god
[56:54] let me see that again
[56:57] when you know there are still things
[56:58] outstanding to do
[57:00] you cannot have the conf you could go
[57:02] and pray you know
[57:03] but you're short
[57:06] they come like people who don't want to
[57:07] ask god about a certain issue because
[57:09] they don't want god to tell them no
[57:11] so they're praying about a b and c but
[57:14] what they want to manage is d
[57:16] so after c they jump over d and go into
[57:18] d e
[57:21] because they don't want god to talk to
[57:22] them about d at all
[57:24] say
[57:32] because d is where the issue is at
[57:35] and they want their own way with d
[57:38] because deep down they know god's going

[1:03:43] don't be paris a table for me in the
[1:03:45] presence of my enemies my cup run it

[1:03:54] when i walk in and look back i see in
[1:03:55] goodness and mercy and i can't praise
[1:03:57] god this morning and i can't thank god
[1:04:00] this morning god kept you alive
[1:04:02] you didn't have to make it to this age

[1:04:22] all the days of my life
[1:04:25] hallelujah
[1:04:27] hallelujah given
[1:04:29] hymn tongues
[1:04:31] second timothy three from in the
[1:04:33] scripture this no
[1:04:34] in the last days perilous time shall
[1:04:35] come for men shall be lovers of their
[1:04:38] own selves coverages boosters proud
[1:04:40] blasphemers disobedient to parents
[1:04:43] unthankful
[1:04:44] and unholy
[1:04:46] so this untangled
[1:04:48] behavior is prophesied
[1:04:50] now we're not talking about
[1:04:52] pan lovers and fat lovers
[1:04:54] we're talking about church folks you see
[1:04:56] women's other readers we think we talk
[1:04:58] with people outside
[1:04:59] but this is not people outside
[1:05:01] this is what i call church folks
[1:05:07] people impuse
[1:05:10] people walling god bless you
[1:05:13] and they are covetous
[1:05:14] boosters
[1:05:16] proud
[1:05:17] blasphemers disobedient appearance
[1:05:20] untangled unholy without natural
[1:05:22] affections in church choice breakers in
[1:05:25] church false accusers in church nailing
[1:05:27] the incontinent in church fierce people
[1:05:30] in church despises of those who are good
[1:05:32] and they're in church
[1:05:35] traitor's heady high minded love of the
[1:05:37] pleasures man and lovers of god having a
[1:05:38] form of godliness but denying the power
[1:05:41] there are from such anointing
[1:05:43] that word unthankful is also ungrateful
[1:05:46] and that ungrateful is not feeling of
[1:05:48] showing gratitude and part of that
[1:05:51] problem is when people feel entitled
[1:05:53] they feel they deserve it
[1:05:54] so they don't say thank you for it
[1:05:57] give me
[1:05:58] like i said hey
[1:05:59] god does that give me god give me
[1:06:01] everything let me go to the world give
[1:06:02] me
[1:06:03] where you are for me this morning
[1:06:04] give me
[1:06:05] but when you come to thank god
[1:06:10] jesus expresses in the our father prayer
[1:06:12] our father who art in heaven
[1:06:15] he asked him here you then identify who
[1:06:17] the father is
[1:06:18] where he is hallowed be thy name
[1:06:22] thy kingdom come
[1:06:23] die will be done you accept nothing yet
[1:06:26] you're worshipping
[1:06:27] on earth as it's in heaven
[1:06:29] hallelujah you're acknowledging his
[1:06:32] purpose his will his plan then you say
[1:06:34] give us this deal
[1:06:36] our daily bread
[1:06:37] oh glory to god hallelujah praise god
[1:06:40] give the lord our praise
[1:06:42] [Music]
[1:06:44] they asked jesus how to pray and he
[1:06:47] taught them
[1:06:48] come with thanksgiving first
[1:06:50] comment praises first don't come with
[1:06:52] give me give me give me give me a minute
[1:06:53] come and praise him come and worship him
[1:06:55] come out knowledge who he is he is god
[1:06:57] who have kept you and preserve you oh
[1:07:00] god he kept you all these years things
[1:07:03] must be bad but it could have been worse
[1:07:05] oh glory to god things might be bad but
[1:07:07] it could have been worse
[1:07:09] he kept you and you have to acknowledge
[1:07:11] it oh glory to god hallelujah glory to
[1:07:14] god ungrateful
[1:07:16] not pleasant or acceptable not given due
[1:07:19] return
[1:07:20] or recompense for the benefits conferred
[1:07:25] very distasteful
[1:07:27] so that person's behavior was
[1:07:28] distasteful
[1:07:30] ungrateful
[1:07:31] oh blessed be the name of the lord
[1:07:34] hallelujah
[1:07:36] thank you jesus
[1:07:38] oh give the lord some praises
[1:07:40] [Applause]
[1:07:41] but there are things that can affect you
[1:07:44] from being thankful
[1:07:46] one of them is being proud
[1:07:48] or arrogant
[1:07:50] nobody could tell you anything that's
[1:07:51] how you see people put an argument you
[1:07:53] tell them something don't even correct
[1:07:54] them
[1:07:56] because in their mind they think they
[1:07:57] are right
[1:07:58] and they think they really know
[1:08:00] they seek no counsel
[1:08:03] they seek no advice they seek no
[1:08:06] leadership they lead themselves
[1:08:09] because they feel like being a man
[1:08:11] or being their own woman when they try
[1:08:13] to tell them
[1:08:20] because many times what you think and
[1:08:23] what god thinks is two different level
[1:08:24] of thoughts
[1:08:26] he said my thoughts are not
[1:08:28] your thoughts and my ways are not your
[1:08:30] ways
[1:08:31] so sometimes think i'm contrary to your
[1:08:33] thinking
[1:08:35] so why but over singing that
[1:08:38] and do every single training words for
[1:08:40] you
[1:08:41] if i had to talk to you i'll tell you
[1:08:42] i'm talking to you one on one
[1:08:44] because i do like to miss
[1:08:46] i'd like to throw like you want to take
[1:08:47] somebody somewhere you're chewing and
[1:08:49] every and people docking anything like
[1:08:50] that
[1:08:51] i i don't do that
[1:08:53] if i have to tell you something after
[1:08:54] service i'll call you aside and tell it
[1:08:56] to your face i have a gift to tell
[1:08:58] people direct
[1:09:00] i don't want to talk behind you but
[1:09:02] anybody's back and i i don't usually
[1:09:04] pull peter words
[1:09:06] never did that i can't start doing that
[1:09:08] now too late
[1:09:10] whatever we speak here is the word for
[1:09:12] us
[1:09:13] not what i said not for you you know
[1:09:16] for us
[1:09:17] and that includes me
[1:09:19] give the lord a shout let me say it good
[1:09:23] it's a word for us
[1:09:25] and that includes me
[1:09:27] because i am not above that
[1:09:30] the word is god
[1:09:32] oh give the lord a shout out
[1:09:38] this is what affects people from being
[1:09:41] thankful
[1:09:42] being discontented
[1:09:44] hallelujah
[1:09:46] jealous
[1:09:48] because you can't be thankful for what
[1:09:49] you have because i am what brother i
[1:09:51] have
[1:09:52] since they have and a body in your eye
[1:09:54] so when you when you're going to god you
[1:09:56] say god give me
[1:09:59] say why she had
[1:10:01] and you don't see what you have in them
[1:10:03] so you're blind to what you have
[1:10:06] and your eye when you're looking to see
[1:10:08] you know my dog will be born
[1:10:11] you look over a river and you see a dog
[1:10:12] with a bigger bone
[1:10:17] and to go for that big bone he opened
[1:10:19] his mouth and
[1:10:21] lost the bone at the end
[1:10:26] so if you get rid of jealousy you're
[1:10:28] troubling
[1:10:29] you can't come thankfully now
[1:10:31] because you have issues in your heart
[1:10:40] what hinders thankfulness
[1:10:42] is holding on to anger and bitterness
[1:10:45] you could hold it down you know and have
[1:10:47] some people every year they renew it you
[1:10:48] know like how you renew your passport
[1:10:50] and it renews your driver's permit they
[1:10:52] renew your business at the end of the
[1:10:54] year they still compete you know they
[1:10:55] hate that brother for five years on the
[1:10:57] next check coming in here coming back
[1:10:58] again get my renewal devil call god
[1:11:00] given that you know that renewal doesn't
[1:11:03] go from going on the devils get stumped
[1:11:04] bring you next
[1:11:06] next
[1:11:07] and sharpen it because you see no faith
[1:11:09] based upon forgiveness so if he could
[1:11:11] lock you in that anger and jealousy and
[1:11:13] hatred and holy naught you're screwed
[1:11:15] you're totally messed up you know you
[1:11:17] can't have faith
[1:11:19] to break into the heavenlies
[1:11:21] because look where brotherly kindness is
[1:11:23] and look where the holy spirit is just
[1:11:26] above brotherly kindness is holy spirit
[1:11:29] so god in his wisdom put the holy spirit
[1:11:32] right unto brotherly kindness to see how
[1:11:34] we will deal with each other oh get the
[1:11:37] lord i shall feel good this morning
[1:11:39] thank you lord thank you lord thank you
[1:11:41] lord oh glory to god what you're saying
[1:11:43] preacher i'm not saying but you're malta
[1:11:45] and thank you i'm talking what you get
[1:11:47] in the spirit of gratefulness the spirit
[1:11:49] of thankfulness
[1:11:51] oh god god god have mercy
[1:11:54] glory to god hallelujah hallelujah
[1:11:57] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[1:11:59] hallelujah you are alive this morning
[1:12:01] that's enough to turn god
[1:12:03] hallelujah you're not in the hospital
[1:12:05] but you're that is not the tank god
[1:12:07] oh glory to god hallelujah you're one of
[1:12:10] the escape ones
[1:12:13] glory the god you escape the beast you
[1:12:16] escape his name you escape his number
[1:12:19] you escape his agent you escape his
[1:12:22] ministers you escape his false prophets
[1:12:24] you escape them liars them force
[1:12:27] prophesiers or kill the lord i shout in
[1:12:29] the house it's good to be in his
[1:12:32] presence
[1:12:36] so what kind of services is this model
[1:12:41] [Music]
[1:12:45] it's clear
[1:12:47] as we get closer to the lord our lives
[1:12:49] have to become like almost crystal clear
[1:12:52] like a glass
[1:12:54] no hidden agendas
[1:12:56] no falsity no
[1:12:58] funny objective or anything that would
[1:13:01] in other words becoming clearer and
[1:13:03] clearer for the flow of the spirit
[1:13:06] you see if a pipe have clogged things in
[1:13:08] it and you open it you're dripping the
[1:13:09] other choke and shake and sometimes have
[1:13:11] rust in it
[1:13:14] and when they get it rust out and water
[1:13:15] the water flowing freely
[1:13:17] a blockage
[1:13:19] for the spirit to flow
[1:13:20] that's what sin does and that's what
[1:13:22] unbelief does it affect the flow of the
[1:13:24] spirit god wants to come down but we
[1:13:25] come down you say god fill me you know
[1:13:27] god catholic
[1:13:30] he will not be fit for god to fill you
[1:13:32] if you know you're the glass duty you
[1:13:34] gotta get washed
[1:13:36] you gotta start with wash me first
[1:13:38] cleanse me first
[1:13:39] oh glory to god oh give the lord some
[1:13:41] praises
[1:13:42] then your faith could rise and say fill
[1:13:44] me
[1:13:45] after you're washed
[1:13:46] you don't drink from a dirty class you
[1:13:48] have a human being i want to do it you
[1:13:49] got to drink from yesterday and wash
[1:13:50] that glass i've seen dirt in it and look
[1:13:52] and i've seen it big and bold are you
[1:13:54] not drinking that water you'll kill me
[1:13:56] you know what in that water look at the
[1:13:57] water looking so go and wash the glass
[1:14:00] and then when you wash the glass then
[1:14:01] they could pour water inside of that
[1:14:02] glass
[1:14:03] so god want to pour water inside of you
[1:14:05] is that that god stingy is that other
[1:14:07] god mean and he holding back and he
[1:14:09] don't want to release his power you're
[1:14:10] looking the character is

[1:15:19] you are god capture his love and grace
[1:15:22] extend towards you oh give him thanks
[1:15:25] this morning
[1:15:27] let's go a little more again i'll be
[1:15:29] rapping
[1:15:31] motive and objective let's go
[1:15:34] you're talking about god doesn't use his
[1:15:36] power and his gifts for foolishness
[1:15:39] it's going to be whatever president will
[1:15:40] be president
[1:15:42] to no no which would be the president
[1:15:43] wouldn't help us one penny it wouldn't
[1:15:46] do us one bitter good to know who is
[1:15:47] going to be the president so therefore
[1:15:49] god doesn't do things like that
[1:15:50] then
[1:15:52] if i made a prediction as that and it
[1:15:54] come to pass
[1:15:56] and the newspaper packed it and the
[1:15:58] magazine would be to my glory
[1:16:01] people would say look at a great prophet
[1:16:03] brother branham is
[1:16:05] he told us long before it happened and
[1:16:07] who would be president no that would be
[1:16:09] to my glory
[1:16:11] but god doesn't want that
[1:16:13] he is not interested in working things
[1:16:17] to my glory
[1:16:19] could we say amen
[1:16:21] that amen is too light
[1:16:23] you have to sing a bigger amen than that
[1:16:26] because god is not interested in
[1:16:27] glorifying no man behind the pulpit or
[1:16:29] out of the pulpit
[1:16:31] all the things must be given glory to
[1:16:33] god all our lives must give glory to god
[1:16:36] he could
[1:16:37] by the breath of his nostrils he could
[1:16:39] blow you out
[1:16:41] tonight
[1:16:42] this morning
[1:16:44] today
[1:16:45] or give the lord a shout when the red
[1:16:48] sea was in front of them god just take a
[1:16:51] blow
[1:16:52] and made a highway without all the
[1:16:54] backhoe with all of the amen all the
[1:16:56] chucks put in bitten pears and pills and
[1:16:59] whatnot he make a way for them
[1:17:02] with a perfect highway no because the
[1:17:04] chariots come riding on a smooth highway
[1:17:06] highway not a truck a highway for two
[1:17:09] million people to cross over that's why
[1:17:11] when they cross over they dance they
[1:17:13] shout but they beat the tambourine
[1:17:18] and give god thanks and praise because
[1:17:21] she knew that the god made a way when
[1:17:23] there was no way
[1:17:25] oh give the lord a shout
[1:17:28] and you are here this morning because
[1:17:30] god made a way for you to be here this
[1:17:32] morning many others would have liked to
[1:17:34] be here but god made i would give the
[1:17:36] lord some praise and you who connected
[1:17:38] god made a way for you to be connected
[1:17:41] oh tell the lord i shout
[1:17:46] god
[1:17:47] made that way
[1:17:51] [Music]
[1:17:53] when he uses his gifts
[1:17:55] he uses them for his glory and for the
[1:17:58] glory of his people oh i love that
[1:18:02] that's why the fifo ministry for the
[1:18:03] perfecting of the saints for the work of
[1:18:05] the ministry is for his glory and
[1:18:09] the glory of his people
[1:18:11] that might go straight on moses it'd
[1:18:12] always be about god's people he said if
[1:18:15] my people that is called by my name
[1:18:18] shall humble themselves and turn from
[1:18:20] their wicked ways then they're gonna
[1:18:22] hear from heaven gonna heal their land
[1:18:24] always about abolished people that is
[1:18:26] why when the people come and give
[1:18:27] praises is something else to god my
[1:18:29] people my people called my people he
[1:18:31] said my people are wicked my people are
[1:18:34] culturous my people evil my people test
[1:18:37] my people that but when these people
[1:18:38] turn around he said my people oh god
[1:18:42] kind of cut a suckling child
[1:18:44] and i can't forget them they engrave in
[1:18:47] the palms of my hands
[1:18:49] oh he came on to his own who
[1:18:51] and his own receive him not but as many
[1:18:54] as receive him to them give you power to
[1:18:57] become the sons of god god was long in
[1:19:00] to have restored sons born sons filled
[1:19:04] sons come back in the last days and
[1:19:06] william marion branham was the first
[1:19:09] example of the kind of sons that god
[1:19:11] have in the last days there are gonna be
[1:19:13] others they're gonna come to the same
[1:19:15] maturity there's gonna be others they're
[1:19:17] gonna come to the same adoption there's
[1:19:19] gonna be others they're gonna come to
[1:19:21] the same vision and purpose so glory to
[1:19:24] god
[1:19:25] hallelujah
[1:19:27] thank you jesus
[1:19:29] what about him
[1:19:31] he said he uses them for his own glory
[1:19:33] and for the glorious people for the
[1:19:35] glory of his church
[1:19:37] hallelujah for the define of the body of
[1:19:39] christ and for the glory of the kingdom
[1:19:42] of god
[1:19:43] that is why he give these things in his
[1:19:44] church why as teachers and prophets are
[1:19:47] evangelists and pastors it's not about
[1:19:50] them it's about you oh give the lord a
[1:19:52] shout about that they are for the
[1:19:55] edification of the church and for the
[1:19:57] glory of god the prophet is not to get
[1:19:59] out and mingle with the world and try to
[1:20:02] take a gift like balaam did and havoc
[1:20:04] out of money out of it or something if
[1:20:07] he's a prophet he's supposed to reveal
[1:20:09] god to the church and to stay out of the
[1:20:12] things of the world all for the glory of
[1:20:14] god
[1:20:15] hallelujah
[1:20:17] glory to god amen
[1:20:19] hallelujah we should never judge a man
[1:20:21] by what denomination belonged to we
[1:20:23] should always judge him by the spirit he
[1:20:25] has
[1:20:26] by the spirit he has not what church he
[1:20:28] gone to sometimes he church cuckoo
[1:20:30] somebody cuckoo but the believers that
[1:20:32] cuckoo because courts people under those
[1:20:35] men

[1:20:41] cuckoo minister on a no man that air
[1:20:43] called to do what he's doing the elect
[1:20:46] gonna be called out
[1:20:47] oh give the lord i shout not one of the
[1:20:50] elect god be manhandled
[1:20:52] i am convinced of that the catholic
[1:20:54] church could hold me when i hear the
[1:20:56] voice of god i fly right out
[1:20:58] oh glory to god fatherly oakland
[1:21:00] remember
[1:21:02] hallelujah praise god forget your name

[1:21:06] when i tell the father god say i
[1:21:08] restarted really bible god god said call
[1:21:11] my father who was able to call the
[1:21:12] father he gave me one clock behind my
[1:21:13] head
[1:21:14] i skipped down the aisles
[1:21:18] oh i can forget father leo
[1:21:21] i was an acolyte immigration
[1:21:24] i get one clout
[1:21:26] why the last time you see me of course
[1:21:28] hallelujah fatherly dead and gone god
[1:21:30] said call no man father and father
[1:21:33] father liu
[1:21:34] hallelujah
[1:21:36] oh glory to god amen
[1:21:38] see watch we should always judge him by
[1:21:40] the spirit he has whether he's lattering
[1:21:42] for marine inner altering so he's not
[1:21:45] talking about doctrine
[1:21:46] because some people only pirated what
[1:21:48] are they hearing by the pulpit
[1:21:49] said these people say star star star the
[1:21:51] only common molestato
[1:21:54] like long time
[1:22:01] i never preached no comment
[1:22:04] no y2k no comment no nothing i am not a
[1:22:06] stargazer sorry
[1:22:08] the people expert semesters i am not one
[1:22:10] of them god gave me the gift of stars
[1:22:13] i'm not a star gazer all i know is what
[1:22:15] god's saying in permission
[1:22:17] so i'm not in philosophy i'm all kind of
[1:22:18] vein hydrating i have no faith in it i'm
[1:22:21] nothing to that
[1:22:22] so he said now watch he said we should
[1:22:24] never judge a man by you know she
[1:22:26] belongs to we should always judge him by
[1:22:28] the spirit he has whether his later
[1:22:30] information entering altering knowing
[1:22:32] whatever it might be we should never
[1:22:33] judge him by that but by his spirit
[1:22:36] because a man can be talking foolishness
[1:22:38] but his spirit is right
[1:22:39] and because his spirit is right he could
[1:22:41] be led to the right thing
[1:22:42] when a man spirit wrong forget it you
[1:22:44] could pelt eggs he could tell whatever
[1:22:46] truth behind him he's still wrong
[1:22:48] because spirit wrong
[1:22:49] said get your heart
[1:22:51] right oh give the lord some praises
[1:22:54] so that's why the prophet said i prefer
[1:22:56] your right in your spirit and wrong in
[1:22:58] your doctrine than to be wrong in your
[1:23:00] spirit and right in your doctrine if
[1:23:02] you're doctrine right in the spirit
[1:23:04] wrong you're well wrong because you are
[1:23:06] leveled you're measured by the spirit
[1:23:08] that you're having
[1:23:10] give the lord some praises
[1:23:12] hallelujah praise god
[1:23:14] there's so much in the day we live in
[1:23:16] pertaining to gifts almost done so many
[1:23:18] people judge people by gifts that they
[1:23:20] have well i believe that these are gifts
[1:23:22] i believe that what we see take place is
[1:23:23] gifts and they are god giving gifts but
[1:23:25] we if we do not use them in the right
[1:23:28] way listen god giving gifts
[1:23:30] not being used in the right way if we
[1:23:34] don't use them in the right way that god
[1:23:36] intended them to be used then we can do
[1:23:38] more harm with the gifts than we could
[1:23:40] if we did not have those gifts the other
[1:23:42] night i made a statement on the pulpit i
[1:23:44] would rather see broadly love existing
[1:23:47] among the church if we didn't have one
[1:23:49] case of healing
[1:23:51] or anything else
[1:23:52] oh give the lord a big one
[1:23:54] why would he say that then why would he
[1:23:57] say that then oh glory to god because
[1:23:59] when we have gifts we have confusion
[1:24:01] when we have guests it could be
[1:24:02] misunderstood but you can't
[1:24:03] misunderstand broadly love
[1:24:05] oh glory to god hallelujah praise god
[1:24:08] jesus gave a power who is my neighbor
[1:24:10] one day
[1:24:12] hallelujah man was beaten up at the side
[1:24:14] of the road and here come a priest here
[1:24:16] come a prophet here come some
[1:24:18] evangelists here come all of them are
[1:24:20] the leading man right there but here
[1:24:21] come a samaritan oh give the lord a
[1:24:24] shout and he took him and take him into
[1:24:26] the inn
[1:24:27] and pay for the inn and help him and do
[1:24:30] this for him who is your neighbor
[1:24:32] okay the lord i shout
[1:24:34] the priest pass him the bishop passed
[1:24:37] him all them whoever who could have
[1:24:39] helped couldn't didn't help
[1:24:44] a samaritan
[1:24:45] he not only covenanted that crown but
[1:24:47] they were samaritan
[1:24:48] watch now if a man comes almost done and
[1:24:51] he has a great gift no matter if he
[1:24:53] belongs to our denomination
[1:24:55] don't judge him by what no machine comes
[1:24:57] from how he dresses but you want to see
[1:25:00] what he is trying to do with that gift
[1:25:04] what purpose he has if he's trying to
[1:25:06] take his influence and build himself a
[1:25:08] great name out of it i have this illness
[1:25:10] of spirit to know that's wrong no matter
[1:25:13] how great a teacher he is the man real
[1:25:16] good he could teach who
[1:25:19] teacher extraordinaire
[1:25:21] but watch no matter how powerful he is
[1:25:24] how intellectual he is how his gift
[1:25:26] operates if he isn't trying to achieve
[1:25:29] something for the benefit of the body of
[1:25:32] christ your own spiritual assailant will
[1:25:33] tell you that's wrong
[1:25:35] listen to this bomb no matter how
[1:25:37] accurate
[1:25:39] how perfect how it is it is wrong if it
[1:25:42] isn't used for the body of jesus christ
[1:25:45] to achieve something maybe he got a
[1:25:47] great gift he could draw people together
[1:25:49] with a great intellectual spiritual
[1:25:50] power musician god please and he could
[1:25:52] draw people together maybe he's trying
[1:25:53] to take a gift and make himself
[1:25:57] famous so you have a big name so other
[1:25:59] bridges will look up to him as some big
[1:26:01] person oh
[1:26:03] my
[1:26:04] wow wow did you hear it you hear how
[1:26:06] that come you hear how that unfold
[1:26:09] and everybody look up
[1:26:11] to him
[1:26:13] we know
[1:26:14] by the same man
[1:26:16] that is wrong
[1:26:18] all right let's come get it
[1:26:21] not one time you are not deserting the
[1:26:23] man
[1:26:24] you're resilient in the spirit
[1:26:26] right
[1:26:27] life that's in the man and that's what
[1:26:29] god told us to do not one time was we
[1:26:32] ever commissioned to deserve a man's
[1:26:33] group
[1:26:34] but we were constrained and commanded by
[1:26:36] god to resend the spirit in the man
[1:26:39] while he's trying to do what spirit in
[1:26:41] his life trying to lead him and then if
[1:26:43] we can find out what he's trying to lead
[1:26:45] the people not to break them up but to
[1:26:47] bring them together to bring the church
[1:26:49] of the living god not all to one
[1:26:50] denomination but to an understanding of
[1:26:53] fellowship a unity of spirit then if he
[1:26:57] is for marine laterine whatever it is if
[1:27:00] his spirit and purpose is right and the
[1:27:02] spirit that's in him no matter what it
[1:27:04] belongs to the spirit is in him trying
[1:27:06] to point the people to calvary away from
[1:27:10] himself
[1:27:11] away from anything else but his only
[1:27:14] achievement is to point them to calvary
[1:27:16] he doesn't care whether he's known or
[1:27:18] not he doesn't care whether his own
[1:27:20] movement which is fine it's good if he's
[1:27:22] a methodist or presbyterian or common
[1:27:23] catholic whatever he is but what he's
[1:27:25] trying to do the purpose of his heart
[1:27:28] what he's trying to do get then you can
[1:27:30] see what is this man life you can see
[1:27:32] his motives oh glory to god hallelujah
[1:27:36] oh my hallelujah he said every man ought
[1:27:38] to have a church home you ought to have
[1:27:40] a place not to float around from a pilot
[1:27:41] to post but you yourself have to go to a
[1:27:44] church you call it your church somewhere
[1:27:45] where you pay your tights somewhere you
[1:27:47] can help support the cause take a choice
[1:27:49] and then don't never disfellowship the
[1:27:51] other man because you don't belong to
[1:27:53] your group discern his spirit if he's
[1:27:56] got the same purpose in heart then
[1:27:57] you've got to fellowship one with
[1:27:59] another oh glory to god
[1:28:02] hallelujah praise god what a comfort

[1:29:48] to god it doesn't glorify god but the

[1:30:50] according to romans 8 28
[1:30:52] to know that all things but a jewel
[1:30:54] going to work together for good to them
[1:30:56] that love god see them already called
[1:30:58] according to his purpose so we trust him
[1:31:01] amidst dark skies we trust him when it
[1:31:03] is raining we trust him still when the
[1:31:06] sun is shining the sunshine is not god's
[1:31:09] approval not that that sky god's
[1:31:11] disapproval his approval is in the
[1:31:13] beloved or give the lord a praise
[1:31:15] offering oh
[1:31:17] hallelujah
[1:31:18] glory to god not for some things
[1:31:21] but in all things
[1:31:23] hallelujah hallelujah glory to god
[1:31:27] there are people who have lots of things
[1:31:28] and they're not thankful
[1:31:30] they have car house family and they're
[1:31:31] not thankful they're not grateful
[1:31:34] they're beating the chest they are
[1:31:35] boosting
[1:31:36] hallelujah praise god
[1:31:39] and we have to learn to give thanks
[1:31:41] in all circumstances and if you're
[1:31:44] struggling just remember brother jason
[1:31:46] as he fell his child being buried
[1:31:49] and he could fell straight in the grave
[1:31:51] and say hallelujah
[1:31:52] hallelujah
[1:31:53] not why
[1:31:55] how come
[1:31:56] why me why not somebody else
[1:31:59] this quality of praise
[1:32:01] amidst stress and circumstance
[1:32:04] is the greatest quality
[1:32:06] that could go up and ascend to heaven
[1:32:09] oh glory to god that's the quality of
[1:32:11] praise you see when those two hebrew
[1:32:13] boys said our god they will deliver us
[1:32:16] yes that's good
[1:32:17] our god believers and we were not going
[1:32:19] to bow down
[1:32:20] when god hear that
[1:32:22] brahman said the angel of water want to
[1:32:24] come and drop the water and hold the
[1:32:25] fire
[1:32:26] different angels asking permission to go
[1:32:28] down god said no no no no no no this
[1:32:30] this kind of worship this kind of
[1:32:32] acknowledgement
[1:32:33] it's too much i have to come down myself
[1:32:36] and when they put them in the fire they
[1:32:37] still have backing we are not going to
[1:32:38] bow down we are not going to bow down
[1:32:41] everybody in the testimony we still not
[1:32:42] bowing down he might say he did seven
[1:32:45] times hotter because he did 70 times we
[1:32:47] still know when dog oh god all that is
[1:32:49] the jam the faith you know why attend
[1:32:51] the man says sometimes
[1:32:58] come on man
[1:32:59] one fire is good enough but to terrorize
[1:33:02] them to try to upset them to try to make
[1:33:05] them pack up and pack up themselves
[1:33:08] himself come down the fault man in the
[1:33:11] fire
[1:33:12] hey hey go glory to god and i don't care
[1:33:15] what fire around you this morning the
[1:33:17] fourth man will come down
[1:33:19] oh glory to god
[1:33:22] a spirit
[1:33:23] of thanksgiving
[1:33:25] oh my
[1:33:27] i'm gonna close
[1:33:29] let's be seated
[1:33:30] by the brown
[1:33:32] it's fine
[1:33:33] that god has so fixed this earth
[1:33:36] that we all can be happy
[1:33:38] if we could just try to be that way
[1:33:41] live happily
[1:33:43] and be thankful to him
[1:33:45] for what we have
[1:33:46] i am quite sure
[1:33:48] that one of the great faults with us
[1:33:51] is that we are not grateful enough
[1:33:53] for what we have
[1:33:55] he has been so good to us
[1:33:57] to give us so many good things and we
[1:33:59] don't seem to appreciate it
[1:34:01] as much as we should and i'm gonna close
[1:34:04] with the scriptory red and where i get
[1:34:06] the text from
[1:34:08] these lepers
[1:34:09] cried unto jesus they wasn't baptized
[1:34:12] believers there wasn't fellowshippers
[1:34:14] another spoken book under the arm
[1:34:16] they were just lepers
[1:34:18] and these lepers in those days i think
[1:34:20] you should put a bell around them
[1:34:21] because when you're hearing leopards is
[1:34:22] to run
[1:34:23] because i had no cure for it and it's
[1:34:25] highly contagious there's a valley
[1:34:28] called the valley of lepers so lepers
[1:34:30] know to stay off and stay far
[1:34:33] so the men already come they said jesus
[1:34:34] lay hands upon me jesus said let me
[1:34:36] touch them he said come virgin
[1:34:38] hallelujah no jesus in a fanatic jesus
[1:34:41] said crazy
[1:34:42] jesus said go
[1:34:44] and show yourself to the priest just a
[1:34:46] word
[1:34:47] for to obey
[1:34:49] they went in obedience and on their way
[1:34:52] on their way
[1:34:54] on their way following instructions
[1:34:57] they recognized they were healed
[1:34:59] and one came back
[1:35:01] that one was me
[1:35:03] oh glory to god one came back
[1:35:06] one came back
[1:35:07] and began to thank him
[1:35:09] and jesus said
[1:35:11] and god said
[1:35:13] wouldn't there the other nine where the
[1:35:15] other nine i know all were here he saw
[1:35:17] vision he knew all of them was gonna be
[1:35:19] healed but one came back
[1:35:21] one came back because i wanna have faith
[1:35:23] he said i faith had made you whole the
[1:35:25] others walk and get their blessing but
[1:35:27] that man had something in his soul

[1:56:32] a few comments that we want to make
[1:56:35] today as well
[1:56:37] and just before i do that is one more
[1:56:39] note of praise from the lamar ellen
[1:56:42] edwards family i just sort of pray see
[1:56:44] it as the year is almost over they want
[1:56:46] to thank god for keeping them safe
[1:56:49] um two of the sons uh they would have
[1:56:51] been on the 1st and the 15th of december
[1:56:53] so they are thanking god for that
[1:56:55] and um
[1:56:56] uh the mom wants to say that she loves
[1:56:58] them and praying for them as they're
[1:57:00] coming to the end of this say and have
[1:57:02] exams next year
[1:57:04] that god would be with them
[1:57:06] and uh also a son in uh
[1:57:10] in this trying time and praying that
[1:57:12] satan has been trying to destroy them
[1:57:15] but they consider jesus in control so
[1:57:17] they want to give all the praise and
[1:57:19] testify thanking god every day i'm not
[1:57:22] giving up because jesus is in control so
[1:57:24] i really think it's a tremendous
[1:57:26] and it fits in perfectly with a message
[1:57:29] today of of giving thanks
[1:57:31] so we want to
[1:57:33] certainly do that today
[1:57:35] so on behalf of brother ovid and the
[1:57:39] ministry
[1:57:40] uh we want to take this time
[1:57:42] and i want to take the words from a
[1:57:44] message brother branham preach and says
[1:57:46] we would see jesus
[1:57:48] december the 24th 1961 he said god bless
[1:57:51] you not exactly a merry christmas but
[1:57:54] god's blessings of christmas be upon you
[1:57:57] and may the christ of calvary hide you
[1:57:59] in himself
[1:58:01] blanket you so wrap you and enshroud you
[1:58:04] in his word
[1:58:05] till his word will be made flesh in you
[1:58:07] is my prayer and that is our prayer
[1:58:10] during this week
[1:58:12] as we approach
[1:58:13] uh not just this time of holidays
[1:58:17] but also this great glorious convention
[1:58:19] that we are under great expectation
[1:58:22] uh for and before i speak more about
[1:58:24] that
[1:58:25] um
[1:58:26] we certainly want to extend a great
[1:58:28] thanks to the church
[1:58:30] today will be the last official sunday
[1:58:33] service um in this way
[1:58:36] for 2021
[1:58:38] and we really want to take this time to
[1:58:40] thank the believers for their support
[1:58:42] during this year
[1:58:44] thank the church this year has been a
[1:58:46] year of maneuvering
[1:58:48] from being able to gather to being on
[1:58:50] lockdown to being able to navigate
[1:58:52] through the different zoom services
[1:58:55] bible studies testimony services live
[1:58:57] streaming having a few people able to
[1:59:00] come out having a number of people able
[1:59:01] to come out and and and but through it
[1:59:04] all we thank god
[1:59:06] and we really want to salute the church
[1:59:08] for standing and maintaining a testimony
[1:59:11] in such a time as this for those who
[1:59:14] have been also faithful with the
[1:59:16] connections both local and foreign as
[1:59:18] well we certainly love you and
[1:59:20] appreciate you
[1:59:21] it is difficult to go through
[1:59:24] many
[1:59:25] different names
[1:59:26] but we really want to
[1:59:28] give special thanks and i want to start
[1:59:30] um with the technical team in particular
[1:59:32] you appreciate the technical team
[1:59:36] and they are not um all able to be here
[1:59:39] today as well
[1:59:40] but uh in particular in this time when
[1:59:44] we have been forced to switch to many
[1:59:46] virtual services
[1:59:48] um god has been faithful and our
[1:59:50] technical team has also been faithful so
[1:59:52] we want to salute the brothers and the
[1:59:54] team
[1:59:55] uh of the technicians
[1:59:58] um
[1:59:59] we will we will go into naming them all
[2:00:01] when we get back um but i certainly want
[2:00:03] to wish god's richest blessing upon them
[2:00:06] and upon the musicians as well
[2:00:08] and um
[2:00:10] in a mighty way
[2:00:11] many times and having had to come and
[2:00:14] minister here when nobody was in the
[2:00:16] building
[2:00:17] um you know it's just sometimes five ten
[2:00:19] people allowed to gather and god would
[2:00:22] have blessed just a handful of people to
[2:00:24] come to prepare the service to stream
[2:00:26] out and it takes great effort you have
[2:00:28] to walk with the fire because everybody
[2:00:30] else is at home so we really want to
[2:00:31] appreciate them
[2:00:33] i really want to salute my friend and
[2:00:34] brother brother anthony o'brien in a
[2:00:36] special way how many are appreciated by
[2:00:38] the anthony
[2:00:41] you know i was saying to brad over
[2:00:43] yesterday
[2:00:44] but anthony is really special
[2:00:46] whether it's bible study and brotherhood
[2:00:48] is doing it whether
[2:00:50] i'm doing it whether it's a prayer
[2:00:51] meeting no matter who is doing it the
[2:00:54] one constant that you could see is
[2:00:56] brother anthony
[2:00:58] they're
[2:01:00] singing
[2:01:01] in the spirit
[2:01:03] and i have the privilege of
[2:01:06] also working with brother anthony so i
[2:01:08] know it's not always he has all the
[2:01:10] energy but his he is faithful and god is
[2:01:12] faithful so but anthony may god bless
[2:01:15] you richly may god crown you may he
[2:01:18] fill and refill and refill you with the
[2:01:20] baptism of the holy ghost and fire me
[2:01:23] touch your wife and your children in a
[2:01:25] special way and continue to use you
[2:01:27] mightily for the kingdom of god
[2:01:30] i believe god has a special place in his
[2:01:33] kingdom for the kind of service you know
[2:01:36] that god has
[2:01:38] uh strengthened him to be able to do and
[2:01:40] certainly we want to also thank all of
[2:01:42] the elders and the deacons and the
[2:01:45] ushers and the trustees
[2:01:47] all of the helps and governments the
[2:01:49] sunday school
[2:01:51] all of the maintenance teams who have
[2:01:54] had to do double duty and step up in
[2:01:56] light of the pandemic and all of the
[2:01:59] various teams and departments that have
[2:02:01] really come together those responsible
[2:02:03] for overseeing the sanitization and and
[2:02:07] taking all the records for contact
[2:02:09] tracing and all the technology behind
[2:02:11] that um it has been a trying year but
[2:02:13] god has given us grace to stand and by
[2:02:16] the grace of god as beloved said if the
[2:02:19] god who knows your past who also knows
[2:02:21] your future nothing else determines your
[2:02:23] future but god that's the power of
[2:02:26] predestination your destination has been
[2:02:30] preset pre-determined pre-planned and if
[2:02:33] there's a purpose for your life then
[2:02:35] nothing can stop that purpose so we
[2:02:37] thank god that the purpose of god will
[2:02:39] always stand and if you are here today
[2:02:42] is because god is not finished with you
[2:02:44] yet and we are only just getting started
[2:02:46] because i can guarantee you the
[2:02:48] situations around us are designed to
[2:02:51] lift jesus higher when cross darkness is
[2:02:54] upon the earth and cross darkness upon
[2:02:56] the people that's when we could arise
[2:02:58] and shine for our light not not our
[2:03:01] personal life but that light his light
[2:03:04] shining through us in such a time as
[2:03:06] this so we thank god in a special way
[2:03:09] you know so we really want to thank all
[2:03:11] the believers and the church like i said
[2:03:14] it will be remiss of me it's difficult
[2:03:15] to kind of capture all the names today
[2:03:17] but from the bottom of our hearts we
[2:03:19] thank you for your love for your support
[2:03:21] and we encourage you especially during
[2:03:23] this time to pray for one another
[2:03:26] it has not been easy and we have not
[2:03:28] been able to see
[2:03:29] everyone in the way that we are used to
[2:03:32] but we could certainly it it it it
[2:03:35] doesn't take too much to remember
[2:03:37] somebody in prayer
[2:03:38] so when you go along on your knees say
[2:03:40] lord bless brother so and so blessed
[2:03:42] sister so and so just just let us keep
[2:03:44] that love you know and that quote but
[2:03:46] override today that where brother
[2:03:48] branham was saying i rather have
[2:03:49] brotherly love in the church i rather
[2:03:51] have that in the church and any other
[2:03:53] kind of gift this is this is what makes
[2:03:55] us really stand because we know only
[2:03:57] only perfect love could really take us
[2:03:59] over there can the church say amen
[2:04:01] amen so just a a few more announcements
[2:04:04] just to kind of set the tone so
[2:04:07] once again we pray have a blessed
[2:04:09] holiday season
[2:04:11] and
[2:04:13] we want to also announce
[2:04:15] briefly
[2:04:17] that the sunday school teachers are
[2:04:19] inviting only sunday school children and
[2:04:21] associated parents to join them
[2:04:22] downstairs their special token for the
