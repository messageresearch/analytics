[3:56] then shall the kingdom of heaven be
[3:57] likened unto ten virgins which took
[3:59] their lamps and went forth to meet the
[4:01] bridegroom and five of them were wise
[4:04] and five were foolish
[4:06] they that were foolish took their lamps
[4:07] and took no oil with them but the wise
[4:10] took oil in their vessels with their
[4:11] lamps
[4:12] while the bridegroom carried they all
[4:15] slumbered and slept
[4:17] and at midnight there was a cry made
[4:19] behold the bridegroom cometh go ye out
[4:22] to meet him
[4:23] then all those virgins arose and trimmed
[4:25] their lamps and the foolish said unto
[4:27] the wise give us of your oil for our
[4:29] lamps are gone out but the wise answered
[4:32] saying not so
[4:34] lest there be not enough for us and you
[4:36] but go ye rather to them that sell and
[4:38] buy for yourselves
[4:39] and while they went to buy the
[4:41] bridegroom came and they that were ready
[4:43] went in with him to the marriage and the
[4:45] door was shut
[4:46] afterward came also the other virgin
[4:48] saying lord lord open to us but he
[4:51] answered and said verily i say unto you
[4:54] i know you not
[4:57] watch therefore
[4:58] for ye know neither the day nor the hour
[5:02] wherein the son of man coming
[5:06] [Music]

[5:23] night one place in daylight on the other
[5:25] side of the earth be a universal
[5:26] resurrection that rapture the trumpet of
[5:29] god shall sound and every one of these
[5:31] of this little church here here here and
[5:34] even that little bunch that went through
[5:35] there come out here here here when that
[5:38] virgin
[5:39] that virgin when she's seen in the
[5:42] seventh watch

[5:46] is that ryan
[5:48] i mean five virgins one out ten virgins
[5:50] went out to meet the lord five was wise
[5:52] and five was foolish is that right
[5:54] and now in the watchable there were
[5:57] seven watches
[5:58] and at the end of the seventh watch some
[6:01] spec from this watch this one this one
[6:03] this one that the seventh watch

[6:07] bridegroom cometh going out to meet him
[6:09] and they rose and trimmed their legs
[6:12] and all these others goes down to here
[6:14] oh won't that be a wonderful time
[6:17] [Music]
[6:39] pastor solomon nucino and the life
[6:41] tabernacle in tamale ghana presents lamp
[6:45] trimming time
[6:46] a virtual convention to close out 2021
[6:51] this will include ministers from the uk
[6:54] ivory coast usa ghana nigeria
[6:58] tnt and south africa
[7:01] with greetings
[7:03] singing
[7:04] worship and special presentations from
[7:07] all around the world
[7:09] we invite you to come and rejoice and
[7:11] worship with us at this time we'd like
[7:14] to introduce the host pastor
[7:16] pastor solomon nichino
[7:21] god bless you saints it's good to be in
[7:23] the house of the lord
[7:25] we thank god for his grace for his
[7:27] goodness for his mercy
[7:29] and for keeping us alive to see this day
[7:32] i certainly want to welcome you all to
[7:34] this year's convention
[7:37] 2021 under the team
[7:40] behold the bridegroom comet lam dreaming
[7:43] time we live in such a time that the
[7:45] grace of god has been faithful to us
[7:49] and when the son of man cometh is he
[7:51] going to find the faith is he going to
[7:52] find people that are still holding on to
[7:54] the promised world
[7:55] and we thank god that we are alive today
[7:58] that when he comes he will find the
[8:00] people that are standing in the fate
[8:02] so i want to take this opportunity to
[8:04] greet you all in the name of the lord
[8:06] jesus christ
[8:08] greet all the ministers and the pastors
[8:10] that will preach that will greet all the
[8:12] specials that will be sung i trust that
[8:15] the lord will be it will be a blessing
[8:16] to you this weekend and the lord will
[8:18] visit you in your local homes
[8:20] in your churches and wherever the tape
[8:22] is played
[8:24] so the inspiration for the convention is
[8:26] behold the bridegroom cometh lamb
[8:29] trimming time
[8:31] it's time to dream our lives it's not
[8:33] just to know that he's coming but we
[8:34] have to make the effort to make sure
[8:36] that when he comes
[8:38] we
[8:38] are ready
[8:40] so i trust that the lord as the messages
[8:43] come forth the lord will bless you
[8:46] the lord will quicken the words to your
[8:47] hearts
[8:48] that your lives will not be the same
[8:50] again
[8:51] we live in a time that is so deadly now
[8:54] we can't even trust what we are
[8:56] breathing into our system
[8:58] but in the midst of all that god has a
[9:00] bride
[9:01] those are the bride that he's coming for
[9:04] and the scriptures say we shall not all
[9:05] sleep
[9:06] praise god but we shall be changed so we
[9:09] are going to receive a promise of his
[9:11] word
[9:12] that change is going to come and when it
[9:14] comes we will be quickened even as he is
[9:17] praise god we're not all going to sleep
[9:19] we shall lose that our life and remain
[9:21] to the coming of the lord we will have
[9:24] our lamb straight and we shall be
[9:25] changed to meet the lord in the air so i
[9:28] trust that the lord will bless us all
[9:30] and before i go i just want to read
[9:33] luke chapter 5 verse 36 to 39
[9:37] and he speak a parable unto them saying
[9:40] no man put a piece of new garment onto
[9:43] an old
[9:44] if otherwise then move them then build
[9:47] the new wine make it a rent and the
[9:50] piece that was taken out of the new
[9:53] agreed not with the old
[9:55] no man put new wine into old bottles
[9:58] else the new wine will burst the bottles
[10:01] and then and be spilled and the bottles
[10:03] shall perish
[10:05] but new one must be put into new bottles
[10:08] and both are preserved praise god verse
[10:12] 39 no man also haven't drunk old wine
[10:14] straightway desired new for he said the
[10:17] old is better
[10:19] so we are not changing this gospel for
[10:21] any other thing we are not changing the
[10:24] promises of the prophet's word to us for
[10:26] any other thing and we know that the
[10:28] holy ghost is desiring the heart of the
[10:30] believer we must be changed in order for
[10:33] the spirit to come and quicken our
[10:35] mortal bodies for the coming of the lord
[10:38] so i trust that god will reveal himself
[10:40] to us even as the messages are coming
[10:43] forth as the ministers are preaching and
[10:45] pounding away
[10:46] don't just look at it as another virtual
[10:48] convention but get in the spirit
[10:51] praise god because every word spoken
[10:53] will not return back void but it shall
[10:55] accomplish for the people for which it
[10:56] was sent
[10:58] praise god amen
[11:01] so brother brahma said here in adoption
[11:03] paragraph 117 is that ten vegans went
[11:06] out to meet the lord all sanctified
[11:09] all believing the message all believing
[11:12] that god is coming back all believing
[11:13] that god has sent the prophet
[11:15] all holy every one of them sanctified
[11:19] five were diluted
[11:21] and let the alarms go out
[11:24] praise god
[11:25] so he's oppressed now we've got to press
[11:28] praise go to the mark of the high
[11:29] calling that is in christ jesus amen
[11:32] five hundred oil in their lambs and that
[11:35] is where we identify we want to have the
[11:37] oil in our lambs every day every moment
[11:41] every season praise god no matter what
[11:44] the enemy will throw at us the lamb is
[11:46] burning the light is shining praise god
[11:49] hallelujah oh five hund oil in the
[11:53] alarms and behold the bridegroom comet
[11:56] and the five that had oil in the alarms
[11:58] went in to the wedding supper and all
[12:01] others were left out where they were
[12:04] whipping and wheeling and gnashing of
[12:06] teeth be ready
[12:08] for you don't know what minute the lord
[12:10] comes
[12:11] praise god
[12:12] what is the oil represented in the bible
[12:15] the holy spirit
[12:17] praise god so we need the holy spirit to
[12:20] keep us burning we need the holy spirit
[12:23] to be the standard against the enemy we
[12:25] need the holy spirit to connect us to
[12:28] the coming of the lord oh blessed be the
[12:31] name of the living god
[12:33] hallelujah oh praise god hallelujah
[12:38] said in this minor church eight
[12:40] paragraph two three four he said aren't
[12:42] you glad to be in that little minority
[12:46] group tonight
[12:47] that keeps the faith

[12:52] fear no little flock is your father's
[12:54] good will to give you the kingdom and
[12:57] except this work would be cut short
[12:59] there will be no flesh saved see we are
[13:03] right at the end time praise god oh

[47:53] bible church in ottawa canada
[47:57] it's a great privilege
[47:59] to
[48:00] speak to all the participants
[48:03] who will be
[48:05] enjoying
[48:06] this convention this online convention
[48:09] that
[48:10] life tabernacle in tamily is organizing
[48:14] this convention is starting on december
[48:18] 23 2021 the theme that the lord has
[48:22] provided for this life tabernacles
[48:24] online convention is behold the
[48:27] bridegroom cometh
[48:29] and i believe that it is a very timely
[48:33] theme which the lord has provided
[48:36] i pray to the lord jesus christ
[48:39] that as you participate
[48:41] in this convention
[48:43] that you open your hearts
[48:45] and open your your souls to receive all
[48:50] the
[48:51] supernatural blessings that i believe
[48:54] the lord has in store
[48:56] for you
[48:57] now as we
[48:59] approach
[49:00] these very momentous times i want to
[49:04] remind all the participants in this
[49:07] great online convention that is coming
[49:10] up very shortly
[49:11] that
[49:12] israel as was predicted by the bible
[49:16] has been back in palestine since 1948
[49:21] and they've been waiting
[49:23] for the arrival of moses and elijah who
[49:27] will introduce them to the messiah
[49:31] they've been praying you can see them at
[49:34] the wailing wall
[49:35] crying out to god to visit them
[49:38] as they do that it is a sign to us
[49:42] a gentile believers the bride that
[49:46] the hour for the rapture
[49:49] is at hand
[49:51] i also want to put you in remembrance
[49:54] that the world as we know it today
[49:57] is going through what they call the
[49:59] global
[50:00] reset
[50:02] that will surely lead to
[50:05] the establishment of a new world order
[50:09] to usher in eventually the antichrist
[50:13] the bible has spoken a lot about the
[50:15] antichrist
[50:17] the son of perdition
[50:19] who will come and rule this world
[50:21] but you and i have been assured by the
[50:24] word of god and by the message of the
[50:27] hour that the bride will not go through
[50:30] that great tribulation that is soon to
[50:33] hit the face of the earth
[50:36] also we should not lose sight of the
[50:39] fact that
[50:41] the prophecies concerning america are
[50:43] coming to pass
[50:45] the prophet told us that america made a
[50:49] fatal mistake in 1956
[50:53] and since that time
[50:54] the power of america has been waning you
[50:58] all saw what happened in the
[51:00] disastrous withdrawal from afghanistan
[51:04] and many things that are happening uh in
[51:06] that nation also we see the rise of
[51:10] china
[51:12] and russia because god is preparing
[51:15] these nations to use them
[51:17] to bring judgment to this world and so
[51:20] that's also happening we also see
[51:23] ah the tremendous
[51:26] shaking that is taking place in the
[51:29] churches around the world we see that
[51:32] world council of churches has finally
[51:35] come to a place where they have managed
[51:38] to rope in all the churches
[51:41] into their fold except the message of
[51:45] the hour
[51:46] what a tremendous
[51:49] event that has transpired to bring to
[51:52] fulfillment what has been predicted by
[51:54] the prophet
[51:56] in the message of the hour
[51:59] and through this shaking we've also seen
[52:03] many
[52:04] of the people in the message churches
[52:07] are falling away now apostle paul
[52:11] uh predicted that the falling away will
[52:13] come first
[52:15] the man of sin will not be revealed
[52:17] until the falling away takes place and
[52:20] we are seeing and witnessing it with our
[52:23] own very eyes
[52:24] indeed we also even seen the cooling off
[52:28] that is taking place
[52:30] in the churches the lukewarm spirit of
[52:34] love is here that has just
[52:36] taken a hold of the people now pray to
[52:39] god that through this convention there
[52:42] will be the release of the anointing of
[52:46] the holy spirit that will revive god's
[52:50] people everywhere
[52:51] also we see
[52:53] rome
[52:55] the purple curtain remember the prophet
[52:57] told us about three curtains he said
[52:59] there is a the bamboo curtain which is
[53:02] uh china the iron curtain which is uh
[53:06] russia and he said the purple curtain
[53:10] which is rome he said watch that purple
[53:13] curtain
[53:14] rome will rule the world again and we
[53:18] see a pontiff that has all that he needs
[53:22] to be able to rise to the occasion and
[53:24] is rising to the occasion
[53:26] to take over the governorship of this
[53:28] world it's coming
[53:30] but the good news is that the bride is
[53:33] also
[53:34] organized and have come together under
[53:37] the burner of the holy spirit amen
[53:42] god
[53:44] is calling the bride from everywhere
[53:46] around the world
[53:48] to what to prepare them for the home
[53:51] going amen the rapture
[53:54] so we are very
[53:55] excited about that when we hear about it
[53:58] our hearts rejoice with exceeding great
[54:01] joy
[54:02] now pray to god that as you participate
[54:06] in this life tabernacle
[54:09] online convention starting on december
[54:12] 23rd of this year to december 26th i
[54:17] pray to god that
[54:18] all the servants of god that will be
[54:21] used to bring forth the messages will
[54:24] cause the bride to trend your lambs
[54:28] i i'm persuaded in my heart that this is
[54:32] lamp trimming time
[54:34] i also pray to god that if you haven't
[54:37] put on the garment of righteousness yet
[54:39] this is the time to do it
[54:41] put a garment of righteousness on
[54:44] because it's been given to us
[54:47] by
[54:48] the opening of the word of god amen the
[54:51] bible has become a new book to us the
[54:54] bible says that the bride will put on
[54:57] that garment you must put it on and put
[55:00] it on during this online convention of
[55:03] the life tabernacle i also pray that you
[55:06] keep the faith amen this is the time
[55:09] when god expects his children to hold on
[55:13] unto the word of god that has been
[55:15] revealed to us jesus said when the son
[55:19] of man comes will he find faith on the
[55:22] earth i pray to god that you will be the
[55:25] one that will be holding on unto the
[55:28] faith that has been ushered and given to
[55:31] us that original faith amen and also i
[55:35] pray that this will be the time
[55:38] of soul-searching i believe that god is
[55:42] calling the church to a time of
[55:45] searching our hearts we must search our
[55:48] hearts and be sure that we are standing
[55:52] in the faith amen and so may the lord
[55:56] jesus

[59:38] brought out this tremendous inspiration
[59:43] for this
[59:45] end-of-year convention
[59:47] hosted by brother nashina
[59:50] and the title is
[59:52] of this great inspiration behold the
[59:55] bridegroom comments
[59:58] lamp dreaming time now i
[1:00:02] many of the ministers will speak
[1:00:04] anointed
[1:00:06] over the subject
[1:00:08] but i will take two two verses
[1:00:11] and just reflect a little bit
[1:00:14] in my greetings
[1:00:16] and maybe an encouragement for you
[1:00:20] verse 6
[1:00:21] a midnight cry go ye out to meet him
[1:00:26] this is something personal
[1:00:28] it's always with jesus something
[1:00:30] personal
[1:00:32] uh in the midnight hour say midnight
[1:00:35] cry is gone out i believe this
[1:00:38] did you receive it says midnight cry go
[1:00:41] out and meet him because he he is the
[1:00:44] one
[1:00:45] that changes you
[1:00:47] he is the one
[1:00:49] that makes you perfect
[1:00:51] that has made you perfect
[1:00:53] already
[1:00:54] he is the one
[1:00:55] that gives you eternal life
[1:00:57] and verse 10
[1:00:59] they that were ready
[1:01:02] went in with him
[1:01:04] so it's another personal thing
[1:01:07] to go in with him and to be prepared
[1:01:12] be ready
[1:01:15] be connected with him
[1:01:19] you know that you have an experience you
[1:01:22] know
[1:01:23] that you are sealed in there's nothing
[1:01:26] can get you out of this fellowship it's
[1:01:29] a love affair with him isn't it
[1:01:32] it's a love affair with him
[1:01:35] and brother bryan said something
[1:01:36] wonderful here
[1:01:38] and i want to
[1:01:40] reflect it from this side there are so
[1:01:42] many sides
[1:01:43] of the coming of the son of man
[1:01:47] it's personal he must come personal to
[1:01:49] you and personal to me
[1:01:52] the prophet said he comes
[1:01:54] to catch away his pride
[1:01:58] like a love affair
[1:02:00] secretly
[1:02:02] maybe nobody knows
[1:02:04] except you
[1:02:06] that's what i say
[1:02:08] he steals her out
[1:02:11] at night time
[1:02:14] and now
[1:02:16] he says this remarkable
[1:02:19] half sentence
[1:02:21] takes her away from the world
[1:02:26] you see
[1:02:28] he takes her to him to his atmosphere
[1:02:32] to his kingdom
[1:02:34] to his reality
[1:02:38] to his unseen world
[1:02:41] to the
[1:02:43] to that
[1:02:44] kingdom of
[1:02:46] that fountain of love says eternal love
[1:02:51] and he helps you
[1:02:53] and he
[1:02:55] he gets you out of this world
[1:02:58] as you
[1:03:00] feed on
[1:03:02] his words
[1:03:04] like a bride
[1:03:05] feeds on the words of a bridegroom what
[1:03:08] he says to her
[1:03:11] you feed
[1:03:12] on these promises
[1:03:14] said he gives to you personally
[1:03:18] see
[1:03:19] there are words that you like
[1:03:22] said your human
[1:03:24] said your human nature your
[1:03:26] reasoning
[1:03:28] likes like
[1:03:30] goodness and mercy will follow me all of
[1:03:32] my life
[1:03:34] it changes you
[1:03:37] jesus christ the same yesterday today
[1:03:39] and forever this evil food
[1:03:41] and evil food
[1:03:43] is for eagle wings
[1:03:46] the eagle is not
[1:03:48] created to be in the nest like an
[1:03:50] airplane is not created
[1:03:53] for the airplane factory
[1:03:56] and we are not created
[1:03:58] to stay and stay in a local church all
[1:04:00] the time
[1:04:01] we are created
[1:04:03] for a fellowship with jesus christ
[1:04:06] in our personal life
[1:04:08] this is where we are an eagle is created
[1:04:10] not for a nest but he is created to fly
[1:04:13] but there is a period
[1:04:15] where you stay in the nest
[1:04:17] and we get eel food
[1:04:19] fresh killed manna hidden manna said the
[1:04:23] world no no no nothing about it
[1:04:26] fresh-killed manner and if if we
[1:04:29] are sincere
[1:04:30] and takes this insight
[1:04:33] eat it
[1:04:34] digest it in our inner being
[1:04:38] sin
[1:04:39] we will grow
[1:04:41] our wings will grow
[1:04:43] we will we will start to
[1:04:45] some things that we never did before
[1:04:47] we were just coming out of the eggs and
[1:04:51] sitting in the ground sitting on the
[1:04:52] ground and then by this eagle food
[1:04:56] we
[1:04:57] something
[1:04:59] lifts our our wing
[1:05:01] lifts our wings
[1:05:03] something
[1:05:04] and lifts more we eat more illegal food
[1:05:08] it means we believing the word for our
[1:05:11] personal for us
[1:05:13] we believe in strong food that the world
[1:05:16] cannot never believe
[1:05:18] jesus said love your enemies this is a
[1:05:20] love command a command out of love to
[1:05:24] keep us safe
[1:05:25] said we
[1:05:27] and if we do this out of love not of out
[1:05:29] of of obedience
[1:05:33] a true wife a true bride
[1:05:36] obeys the husband because of love
[1:05:40] jesus said if
[1:05:41] if you love me
[1:05:43] you will keep my words
[1:05:45] and we do self-love because he spoke it
[1:05:47] out of love because if we would hate our
[1:05:50] enemy the devil would come and bring us
[1:05:53] migraine and and we could we would get
[1:05:55] sick because we would go inside get in
[1:05:59] such a complex
[1:06:00] but jesus helped us
[1:06:02] and if he says so then it's possible
[1:06:05] if he accepts the word and we say lord
[1:06:08] jesus for sure
[1:06:09] where is my next enemy i love him it's
[1:06:12] very easy not for his mind not for this
[1:06:16] stuff up here these five senses it's
[1:06:18] impossible but for the inward soul for
[1:06:20] the inward man is satisfied with this
[1:06:23] ill food
[1:06:24] and so our words
[1:06:26] we could continue for
[1:06:28] for
[1:06:29] thousands of
[1:06:31] weeks
[1:06:32] to to
[1:06:34] speak about this eating food but we have
[1:06:35] to digest it
[1:06:37] if they adjust it repent and be baptized
[1:06:40] for the remission of
[1:06:42] my sins
[1:06:44] jesus this is a love affair he wants me
[1:06:46] free from sin he said tell tell me said
[1:06:51] you are wrong and i will i will tell you
[1:06:53] said i have forgotten all this you are
[1:06:56] perfect in my sight it is
[1:06:58] such a glorious experience
[1:07:00] then this experience lifts you
[1:07:03] it lifts you in an unseen world in the
[1:07:06] world where jesus lives and this is how
[1:07:09] we prepare ourselves
[1:07:11] this house is oil goes into our vessel
[1:07:14] inside inside and and you know
[1:07:18] it's you start to know it's a
[1:07:21] it's a
[1:07:22] carrying
[1:07:24] power a carrying dynamic come is coming
[1:07:27] into you
[1:07:28] he helped me there i know
[1:07:31] i i could stretch here
[1:07:33] i i and i feel this i can get out of
[1:07:36] this world hallelujah i cannot get out
[1:07:39] and i he knows me and i know him so it
[1:07:43] is it is in a glorious affair
[1:07:47] and he says he says it takes her away
[1:07:50] from the world don't you want this
[1:07:53] from your desires from your lust from
[1:07:56] your
[1:07:58] understanding what you learned and all
[1:08:01] this
[1:08:01] in a in a dimension of love
[1:08:04] in the dimension of god in a in a godly
[1:08:08] atmosphere you live in a godly
[1:08:10] atmosphere
[1:08:11] all the time and this is prepared for us
[1:08:15] so he says he says see you love him
[1:08:18] express the word of god and because you
[1:08:20] love him you keep his words and keeping
[1:08:23] his word takes you away from this world
[1:08:27] hallelujah
[1:08:28] this glorious evil food yeah
[1:08:31] yeah
[1:08:32] so
[1:08:33] so hallelujah
[1:08:35] my time is going but anyhow
[1:08:40] the promises
[1:08:42] you think how can i be an adopted son to
[1:08:45] speak the word
[1:08:47] when you eat and digest these promises
[1:08:51] these promises are growing you into
[1:08:54] adoption
[1:08:56] if we swallow them like the eagles the
[1:08:59] fresh killed meat and i chest them
[1:09:02] and we stretch our wings
[1:09:03] and you feel that different atmosphere
[1:09:06] you feel a different dimension you feel
[1:09:08] that world where jesus lives it brings
[1:09:11] you into it hallelujah
[1:09:13] so
[1:09:15] this is this is real
[1:09:17] and you exercise it and
[1:09:21] so
[1:09:23] he takes you away from this world
[1:09:26] away from yourself
[1:09:28] you see
[1:09:30] he takes you away from yourself this is
[1:09:32] deliverance
[1:09:35] takes you away from yourself
[1:09:37] there are situations coming
[1:09:39] your old nature would fly up
[1:09:41] and then and
[1:09:43] uh
[1:09:44] insulation is coming but jesus said if
[1:09:47] if somebody hits you here
[1:09:49] and because of love he told you
[1:09:53] and your your your human mind says it is
[1:09:55] very
[1:09:56] it's very hard to
[1:09:58] to to show him this side said he can hit
[1:10:01] it here also
[1:10:03] but this is the way jesus was and this
[1:10:06] is his life
[1:10:07] it is love and if we obey the word
[1:10:11] and say we don't have to defend
[1:10:13] ourselves
[1:10:16] it is jesus's love that defends us
[1:10:19] and we enter into this world
[1:10:22] then
[1:10:24] many things become easy
[1:10:26] in our life
[1:10:28] and many complexes will drop from us
[1:10:32] as you are keeping his word not because
[1:10:33] of obedience because of love and it
[1:10:35] brings you in a different world to abide
[1:10:38] forever
[1:10:39] it is influencing you
[1:10:42] and it's called continue continually
[1:10:45] going on is it it is in a continually

[1:25:31] and we have to include saint luke 18.
[1:25:37] i tell you
[1:25:39] that he will avenge them speedily
[1:25:42] nevertheless
[1:25:44] when the son of man cometh
[1:25:47] shall he
[1:25:48] find faith on the earth
[1:26:01] according as it is written
[1:26:04] god hath given them the spirit of
[1:26:07] slumber
[1:26:09] eyes that they should not see
[1:26:12] is that they should not hear unto this

[1:28:25] the first thing comes
[1:28:28] when he starts descending from heaven
[1:28:32] from the heaven this year there's a
[1:28:34] shout out
[1:28:36] or the scripture calls it a cry
[1:28:39] what is it
[1:28:40] a
[1:28:53] lamp trimming time alone rice
[1:28:57] and trim your lamps
[1:28:59] what what was that convey your test
[1:29:02] because uh there were seven watches
[1:29:04] so what watch was that
[1:29:07] the seventh
[1:29:08] not
[1:29:24] and then comes the trimmings
[1:29:26] rise
[1:29:28] and trim your lamps it's tight along you
[1:29:30] can't just kind of say well

[1:31:28] mark of the
[1:32:09] this is
[1:32:10] mind-blowing
[1:32:12] because the prophet said that rapturing
[1:32:14] faith in a football ever amen my
[1:32:17] that's what the oil is
