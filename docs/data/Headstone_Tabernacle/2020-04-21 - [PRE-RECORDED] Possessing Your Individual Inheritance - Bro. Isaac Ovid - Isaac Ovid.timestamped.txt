[8:07] you too
[8:10] hallelujah I I could like I feel like
[8:17] embracing everybody here hallelujah you
[8:23] coming from the letter of the book into
[8:32] the story itself Paul said in Ephesians
[8:36] he wrote it in Thessalonica right after
[8:41] the rapture he spoke about the rapture
[8:43] next chapter he said we are the children
[8:46] of light in children of the day cccd
[8:53] said is coming to us
[8:56] in a mighty mighty way we will be just
[8:59] standing here and a lot of God will drop
[9:02] down this is a day this is just glorious
[9:06] day and I think on on a birth of my son
[9:12] Daniel he came out a different way
[9:17] halfway inside the head out and and
[9:22] started to crack and the doctor said if
[9:27] I would not have seen it I would not
[9:29] believe it
[9:31] brothers some are not totally out porn a
[9:36] born in this world in this new kingdom
[9:39] but make a quick at least thank him
[9:45] thank him for the glory his glory came
[9:49] down
[9:49] what is his glory his salvation that
[9:54] safe music is of glorious for me that
[9:57] opens to me description let's experience
[10:00] healing all over from Horizon to horizon
[10:05] there's no sin in that place if you
[10:07] believe it so glorious is a new day
[10:12] there's no sin in your family if brother
[10:16] Brent spoke about the old fisherman he
[10:18] said he couldn't see only God he only
[10:22] saw God everywhere do you see it in your
[10:26] life you see it in your wife you see it
[10:30] in your pasta and your brother and your
[10:32] sister this is a new day

[10:42] brother had glory and salvation opens
[10:46] healing for my entire being we realize
[10:51] this new day we find ourselves as
[10:55] children of this day do you
[10:58] is it sinking down in your
[11:00] you are a child of this new day this is
[11:05] so true resistor the problem is that
[11:09] program told that many times we are too
[11:14] fearful to let our soul go when you hear
[11:20] the promise let your soul just fly and
[11:24] God will do the rest you young people
[11:28] let your soul fly away to the promise
[11:32] just you don't have to understand just
[11:36] just believe Mary she believed and it
[11:39] happened to her
[11:41] hallelujah so part of us may still be
[11:46] connected with the old world system
[11:47] shadows and darkness of the body of
[11:50] cicero's but listen god's child will not
[11:53] stay forever in Xela it's coming out
[11:56] into that new day Paul preached about
[12:01] this Paul wrote about this brother
[12:03] branham spoke about this and this is a
[12:06] Holy Ghost is a kingdom of God and I'm
[12:10] looking forward that it opens in a
[12:13] mighty way as never before this is new
[12:16] day so what will they do when when we
[12:21] are sticking out with a head sticking
[12:22] out is our heart we begin to unfold like
[12:25] the lily we let our soul loose in this
[12:29] glorious reality says nobody can stop us

[35:48] it's possessing your individual
[35:51] inheritance and I have a subject another
[35:54] holy time is here and I have an
[35:57] inspiration the higher law of the eighth
[35:59] day the higher law of the eighth day and
[36:03] in a message personal experience with
[36:05] God but the Branum said what we need
[36:08] today is a good old fashioned scene
[36:11] pause revival and the baptism of the
[36:14] Holy Ghost like fell on the day of
[36:16] Pentecost to bring a people back to a
[36:19] living faith in God again that's exactly
[36:21] I believe in confessions to raise up and
[36:25] accept Jesus Christ that's good I
[36:27] believe in all that but friends we need
[36:29] something more than that so I believe
[36:31] this meeting and my design my heart is
[36:33] to have more than just a service more
[36:35] than just a meeting but an experience
[36:38] with the supernatural with the baptism
[36:40] of the Holy Ghost like they had on a day
[36:42] of Pentecost and but the Branham said
[36:45] the day of Pentecost was the eighth day
[36:47] said a day of Pentecost the Holy Ghost
[36:49] fell on the eighth day so I'm happy to
[36:51] be identified with an eighth a holy
[36:54] convocation and you know that Aaron's
[36:57] rod was dead for years but when it was
[37:00] left overnight in the presence of God it
[37:02] brought forth buds blossom and brought
[37:05] forth fruit because it was in the right
[37:07] place it was there at the right time and
[37:09] something had to happen and whenever you
[37:12] were in the right place at the right
[37:14] time something has got to happen now
[37:18] Aaron's rod could have only brought
[37:20] forth what was the genetic code of that
[37:23] rod that raka that I've brought for
[37:25] coconuts it could not have brought for
[37:27] apples it had to be whatever that rod
[37:29] was so even though the rod was dead and
[37:32] it looked like it have no life the
[37:34] genetic structure of the
[37:36] have not been compromised genetic
[37:39] structure of the rod has not been broken
[37:42] the genetic structure of the rod have
[37:44] not been tampered with him maybe you
[37:46] come to this meeting looking to get
[37:48] something more than yesterday but maybe
[37:50] you are tired maybe you are wearing
[37:52] maybe you are frustrated I have good
[37:54] news for you the genetic code that has
[37:57] been written inside your genes has not
[38:00] been damaged it has not been compromised
[38:02] it might it might look dry but son of
[38:05] man can't these dry bones lives on a man
[38:08] and this rod come back to life can the
[38:12] church team and so I've got good news

[39:07] morning it was not your fault
[39:09] that man fell we were not even there it
[39:13] was Adams fault
[39:14] and because of Adam we fell as a result

[40:53] I come from Carla I go back to God we
[40:56] were there when we kicked the devil out
[40:59] of heaven we were there we will kick him
[41:02] out on this earth also because we shall
[41:05] reign on the earth this land belongs to
[41:08] me this earth belongs to me the trees
[41:11] know who you are the Lions know who you
[41:14] are that's why the whole creation is
[41:17] groaning for the manifestation of the
[41:20] sons of God we are creatures of eternity
[41:30] we are not teachers of time we are
[41:33] creatures from another dimension
[41:35] we are from another world and listen we
[41:38] live by a higher law we buy the law of
[41:42] the a stage when we enter the eighth day
[41:45] the law of one to seven matters no more
[41:52] you may be seated
[41:54] we're gonna get it oh but I peg off I
[41:58] thank God that his numerology has never
[42:02] ever gone wrong but their Branham you
[42:05] may be seated when he was speaking about
[42:07] the eighth day he said keep your numbers
[42:09] running
[42:10] he said one two three four five six
[42:11] seven he said you think you got me huh
[42:14] he said but he ain't did goes back to
[42:16] the first day he said the church ages
[42:19] that's in the seven one two three four
[42:21] five six seven
[42:22] but he said the eighth is different he
[42:24] said that eternity eternal he never had
[42:29] a beginning he doesn't have an ending
[42:32] the end he always was he everything is
[42:35] your king you belong to the 8th King you
[42:42] belong to a different place you belong
[42:44] to a different world you live by a
[42:47] different law
[42:50] [Applause]
[42:51] [Music]
[42:54] hallelujah hallelujah there's a
[42:58] different law you may be seated young
[43:00] people you might walk in the same places
[43:03] not the people in the world walk but
[43:05] there's a different law when you walk
[43:08] the devil knows you are different he
[43:10] can't figure it out but he knows you are
[43:12] not from here he knows there's something
[43:14] about you he can't pin it down but you
[43:17] are creature of eternity listen you may
[43:21] be seated
[43:22] that's one of the biggest problems the
[43:24] devil has with you you know because he
[43:27] has an end coming but you have no ending
[43:34] so you can look at the devil in the face
[43:36] no matter what he says to you and say
[43:39] devil one of these days time no longer
[43:42] and when time or wrong and when time
[43:45] runs out it means the devil and his
[43:47] works run out and when time runs out
[43:49] only the eternal will be left standing
[43:52] only the creatures who are connected to
[43:55] the entity will remain standing oh I'm
[43:58] so glad for twentieth century profit
[44:00] factor bring revelation about the eighth
[44:03] day about the holy convocation people
[44:07] who can receive it Amen so true for
[44:19] knowledge God could be destined eight
[44:21] you it's because he knew you before
[44:24] so your destiny is guaranteed because he
[44:26] already knew what school you would go to
[44:29] he knew what job you would have he knew
[44:32] what village you'd be born in you know
[44:34] what school you go to what church you
[44:36] will go to and he knew that you would
[44:38] find his message and this message would
[44:40] find you to connect you back to your
[44:42] identity because when you came
[44:45] left eternity as a thought to be
[44:47] expressed in time you forgot where you
[44:50] came from so something had to kind of
[44:53] wake you up to not you a little bit to
[44:56] let you know that when you were drinking
[44:58] smoking doing whatever you were doing
[45:00] that there was something else that was
[45:02] troubling your heart.you realizes where
[45:05] the Brabham said there's something more
[45:06] to light and waking up in the morning
[45:08] I'm going to work there's something more
[45:11] to light and pay the bills there's
[45:13] something more to life and trying to
[45:14] impress the neighbor next to you that
[45:17] there's something more to life that
[45:18] having black beans and having a tractus
[45:21] and having high blood pressure there's
[45:23] something that mortal dag here's a
[45:25] different law where there is no high
[45:27] blood pressure there's a different law
[45:29] where there is no a brighter Sun there's
[45:31] a different place where there's no
[45:33] tiredness there's another world where
[45:36] there is no depression there's not a
[45:38] place where there is no death there's
[45:40] another place where there's no crying
[45:43] it's an eternity it's an eternal place
[45:46] and the church even Oh hallelujah
[45:53] hallelujah
[45:54] somebody say Amen somebody say
[45:57] hallelujah
[45:59] so we are going to a place you may be
[46:01] seated
[46:02] we have a destination we are not just
[46:05] existent to exist there are many people
[46:08] or just existing they're just killing
[46:12] time but time is not the currency of our
[46:15] economy
[46:22] Oh
[46:26] hallelujah that's why each day that
[46:29] passes we are changing currencies
[46:32] toccata please wear when you speak it's
[46:35] created go it up that you can see
[46:38] Mountain shift a little bit this way
[46:40] because heaven is not our destination
[46:42] the Bible says we shall reign on the
[46:46] earth this earth belongs to me the devil
[46:49] is squattin he has no legal right but
[46:52] for all these years God has been waiting
[46:55] to our people the serve the eviction
[46:58] notice
[46:59] [Applause]
[47:05] you maybe see this for a minute you may
[47:08] be seen it for a minute I want you to
[47:10] catch something God is the judge the
[47:13] sentence has already been passed the
[47:15] devil has to evict but when a judge
[47:18] gives the order for eviction there has
[47:20] to be somebody to enforce the order and
[47:22] we know the Holy Ghost is the enforcer
[47:24] but even though the Holy Ghost is the
[47:27] enforcer God's tell us the police the
[47:29] Holy Ghost inside of individuals to move
[47:32] the Holy Ghost around so when he had to
[47:34] go to Cornelius and he had oh you know
[47:37] you know with me this morning when he
[47:39] had to go to these people they had to be
[47:40] somebody he could use and he could eat
[47:43] me he can make a deposit of the Holy
[47:45] Ghost in them and not a transfer can
[47:48] take place so young people God is
[47:52] looking for somebody he can make a
[47:54] deposit of the Holy Ghost in so we can
[47:57] move it around from country to country
[48:00] from neighborhood to neighborhood to
[48:03] your family can the church say man oh
[48:06] you may be seated
[48:09] Oh hallelujah you may be seated
[48:16] so I'm not talking about Church this is
[48:19] not about church to its age is over we
[48:23] are talking about the bride we are
[48:25] talking about a new creation we are
[48:27] talking about not being church members
[48:29] but Peter said this morning the bride
[48:32] could go where the church members cannot
[48:34] go the bridal experience what the just
[48:38] remember could never experience it I
[48:41] love that brother pizza oh the church
[48:45] member you're gonna wind them up come to
[48:48] church sing shout but the bride because
[48:51] she knows who she is she needs no
[48:54] encouragement when she sees her love of
[48:56] the word when she sees two crewmen view
[48:59] she gets excited every single time
[49:02] because she is in love she is in love
[49:05] she is in love she loves the world
[49:08] she loves to worship she loves to be the
[49:11] atmosphere when he is around she gets
[49:15] excited that's the difference between
[49:17] the church member and the pride of Jesus
[49:20] Christ
[49:23] oh you may be seated hallelujah
[49:29] my so you are called for a different age
[49:33] you are called for a different
[49:35] experience you are called to taste
[49:37] something that only if you could
[49:38] understand and young people I love to
[49:41] speak to young people natural solutions
[49:43] I always say this cannot solve spiritual
[49:46] problems your problem is not much more
[49:48] education and much more training your
[49:50] problem is you need a Holy Ghost natural
[49:53] solutions and that solves your problems
[49:56] your depression is not because of
[49:58] finances your depression is you need
[50:00] more the Holy Ghost because if you have
[50:02] the Holy Ghost he can lead you to the
[50:04] right job he can open the right door
[50:06] what we need is the Holy Ghost what we
[50:09] need is a spiritual solution and the
[50:12] church see man
[50:13] what the world needs is Jesus yes we
[50:17] might have mind battles you may be
[50:18] seated yes then my things might be bad
[50:21] but God will have a people God will have
[50:24] some young people who will see no
[50:29] no toward the devil has to offer no to
[50:32] the devil's temptations no to everything
[50:35] that he has come the Jets amen you may
[50:38] be seated for a minute can somebody see
[50:45] no cancel my scene only loud wonderful
[50:50] you may be seated
[50:52] why did you do that but I say because we
[50:54] need some more young people who could
[50:56] say no no that that was offer whatever
[50:59] he brings to you you respond to know I
[51:02] don't care how good it looks it's no why
[51:04] because I'm on a destination to a
[51:07] different place
[51:08] I don't want your offer I don't want
[51:10] what you're given to me I don't want it
[51:12] because I don't belong here I'm not
[51:15] gonna be satisfied with what the world
[51:17] has to offer because I'm a creature of
[51:19] eternity only eternal things that
[51:22] satisfy me amen you may be seated for a
[51:33] minute so I was looking at that
[51:37] scripture I'm not eating a holy
[51:40] convocation it says a powerful two words
[51:43] there'll be no servile work therein and
[51:48] I just was meditating on that no servile
[51:50] work therein and I went to do some
[51:52] research in that word survive and what
[51:55] that servile wood means and that word
[51:57] servile is connected to slavery so it
[52:01] mean that when that if they comes it
[52:03] means your day of doing stuff that you
[52:06] are forced to do is over and many young
[52:09] people say I want to give up this and I
[52:11] want to stop doing better my heart wants
[52:14] to do the right thing but more than that
[52:17] servile work is defined as when there's
[52:21] a job to do and there's a physical
[52:23] component and a mental component but the
[52:25] physical component far exceeds the
[52:28] mental so it's when you're working
[52:31] almost like a drone you're working
[52:33] because you're forced to work you're
[52:35] working because you are pressured to do
[52:37] it without having to think about it
[52:41] that's how the children of Israel were
[52:42] in Egypt it was servile work it was not
[52:46] their creativity it was not their ideas
[52:49] they will foster bring out the ideas
[52:51] that the Egyptians wanted but if he
[52:55] comes it's a different day altogether
[52:57] there's no more survival there's no more
[53:01] doing what the devil wants you to do
[53:03] there's no more taskmaster there's no
[53:07] more you have to smoke you have to drink
[53:09] you have to lust you have to have
[53:11] jealousy no no no no no lover no more
[53:14] self I work there in that is your need
[53:17] to be free when that is the account is a
[53:20] jubilee time you can put down your tools
[53:23] that you have been working with and you
[53:26] can claim back your inheritance because
[53:29] it's the evening there's no more working
[53:31] 30 so I declare tonight that in this
[53:34] holy time it's another jubilee for the
[53:37] bride of Jesus Christ and the devil's
[53:40] that I've been holding you they have got
[53:42] to let you go name of the Lord you may
[53:49] be seated what do you say memorizer the
[53:51] Egyptians you see today you will see
[53:53] them no more forever this time I put the
[53:57] devil he has had his keys to operator
[53:59] but the devil cannot go into that 18 he
[54:02] cannot go into eternity he has no access
[54:05] to that world because it is your world
[54:08] it is your kingdom and the church same
[54:13] hallelujah my my my you may be seated
[54:17] [Applause]
[54:20] hallelujah
[54:21] second chronicles 7:14 says if my people
[54:24] which are called by my name shall humble
[54:29] themselves and pray and seek my face and
[54:32] turn from their wicked ways then will I
[54:35] hear from heaven and will forgive their
[54:37] sin and will heal their land if my
[54:40] people and the first time the Bible uses
[54:43] my people is in Exodus 3 7 when the
[54:47] Bible says and the Lord said I have
[54:48] surely seen the affliction of my people
[54:50] which are in Egypt and I've heard their
[54:53] cry by reason of their taskmasters joy I
[54:57] know their sorrows I want you to
[54:59] understand friends that God I've already
[55:01] promised their deliverance but even
[55:04] though there was a promise over them he
[55:06] still had to wait till he heard the
[55:07] cries of the people and when he heard
[55:10] the cries he remembered the promise it
[55:13] was under the taskmasters under the
[55:15] slave masters of kept them doing things
[55:18] that they didn't want to do because they
[55:20] were forced to do it the taskmaster was
[55:24] keeping them doing the sin and the
[55:25] bondage and the building or whatever it
[55:27] is so whenever you don't feel like
[55:29] worshiping it's because it's a
[55:31] taskmaster telling you you shouldn't
[55:33] worship when you don't feel like praying
[55:36] it's because it's a master that's over
[55:39] you can you don't pray because the
[55:42] taskmasters they control your time past
[55:45] masters control when you wake up in the
[55:48] morning the master tells you when to eat
[55:50] the master tells you what time to go to
[55:54] bed
[55:54] and the children of Israel got tired of
[55:57] the taskmaster telling them to get up in
[56:00] the morning I'm going through this I get
[56:02] up in the day I go into that and the
[56:05] taskmaster puts too much until the turn
[56:09] of Asia being a crime they begin aside
[56:12] and I see begin a crime God began
[56:16] together and coffee get together and the
[56:19] noise came up to God and God listened
[56:23] had to do something about it he couldn't
[56:25] hear it and not do anything about it
[56:27] he could be hear it and leave them alone
[56:29] because God had to respond to the call
[56:33] and the church seaman colony Ceylon and
[56:38] two hundred thousand thousand demons two
[56:42] hundred thousand thousand taskmasters
[56:44] have been assigned to stop you from
[56:47] hearing this message the children of
[56:51] Israel were born into slavery in Egypt
[56:55] just as we were born into sin because of
[56:58] Adam and the tax masters have been with
[57:00] us in our schools under jobs but he has
[57:02] always been a covenant that is a freedom
[57:05] coming it's been a covenant not a
[57:08] deliverer was coming there's a covenant
[57:10] that there's an opportunity coming to
[57:12] get out of here fear of thought you
[57:15] would have had them forever but God made
[57:17] a promise hero did not know that it was
[57:20] a time limit on his operations he didn't
[57:24] know that he was operating under the
[57:26] constraint of time but God's promise
[57:29] does not limited by time so God knew his
[57:32] people had to come out of Egypt they
[57:35] were there for a season but the
[57:37] destination was not Egypt it was an
[57:40] inheritance that they had to go to and
[57:42] whatever God had to do he was going to
[57:44] do to get them out
[57:46] the church semen you may be seated
[57:51] and I could imagine that here oh I've
[57:54] heard a rumor that a deliverer was
[57:56] coming
[57:57] they say there's somebody coming as a
[57:58] rumor coming and table it's only a rumor
[58:00] but I keep my time like no other time
[58:03] when God had to do something and Moses
[58:07] came on the scene but I want to declare
[58:09] tonight that tonight we said time Satan
[58:11] time up Pharaoh we have seen our names
[58:14] we know who we are we know our promise
[58:18] we know what our inheritance is we know
[58:20] this is our day to break out of the
[58:23] chains to break out of the shackles to
[58:26] put down our heads to put down our tools
[58:29] and head to the promised land see some
[58:32] thought he could stop the life he's
[58:34] taught he could stop you but that life
[58:36] and you can never be stopped and the
[58:38] church say man
[58:40] somebody give the Lord a shout of praise
[58:42] [Applause]
[58:51] you may be seated
[58:54] friends we're not promised a system
[58:57] Jesus wouldn't have nothing to do with
[59:00] the system we wasn't promised a system
[59:02] what will be promised a kingdom how do
[59:05] you get into it by one spirit we are all
[59:07] baptized into this kingdom it's the
[59:10] kingdom of God
[59:11] a kingdom of eternal life with an
[59:14] eternal King given for his eternal world
[59:17] with an eternal people predestinated to
[59:20] eternal life he is the king we are
[59:23] baptized into it
[59:25] settled in heavenly glory hallelujah
[59:28] blessed be the name of the Lord under
[59:30] the brand of continues we are dead our
[59:32] lives are hidden God through Christ not
[59:35] only that but we are raised with him
[59:37] raise up what in a system a denomination
[59:40] organization no we are resurrected in
[59:43] the kingdom of God the kingdom of God is
[59:46] within you why all these man-made
[59:48] systems must fall not once more I'll
[59:52] shake the world but I'll shake heavens
[59:54] and those things that cannot be shook is
[59:56] what will remain and we receive a
[59:59] kingdom receiving a kingdom that cannot
[1:00:02] be shut or moved that's the kingdom of
[1:00:05] God not a system not a political wheel
[1:00:08] not a denomination but a kingdom and
[1:00:11] it's subjects are dead the systems of
[1:00:14] this world
[1:00:14] that's what the columella was talking
[1:00:16] about dead to the systems of this world
[1:00:19] its subjects are dead to these
[1:00:21] organizations instead to these political
[1:00:24] systems and now we are in this kingdom a
[1:00:27] kingdom that cannot be moved all these
[1:00:30] other things are falling apart the
[1:00:32] prophet said America is falling apart
[1:00:34] Europe is falling apart
[1:00:36] Asia is falling apart all the world is
[1:00:39] falling apart but we are in a kingdom
[1:00:41] and eternal Kingdom it cannot be moved
[1:00:46] [Music]
[1:00:46] [Applause]
[1:00:54] mine so in the message of future home of
[1:00:59] the heavenly bridegroom and earthly
[1:01:04] bride there's seven great feast days but
[1:01:07] that was only a type of the seven church
[1:01:08] ages all right let's take the last piece
[1:01:11] which is the Feast of the Tabernacles
[1:01:13] now notice here in the 36 verse seven
[1:01:16] days shall you offer offerings made of
[1:01:18] fire unto the Lord but on the eighth day
[1:01:20] on the atheist shall be a holy
[1:01:22] convocation
[1:01:23] there's another holy time coming holy
[1:01:26] convocation unto you and you shall offer
[1:01:29] an offering made by fire unto the Lord
[1:01:32] and it is a solemn assembly and you
[1:01:34] shall do no servile work therein
[1:01:36] now we got an EP now there's only seven
[1:01:39] days but here we speak of the eighth the
[1:01:41] holy convocation do no work in it it is
[1:01:45] what back to the first eight it speaks
[1:01:48] of eternity no the is he Jesus raised
[1:01:51] for our justification he eternal King
[1:01:54] with eternal Kingdom to be baptized into
[1:01:57] to eternal life not seven days have
[1:02:01] nothing to do with any of the days it's
[1:02:03] speaking of another eternal coming
[1:02:06] speaking of an eternal world now notice
[1:02:08] after fifty days or seven servers from
[1:02:11] there again there comes another holy
[1:02:14] convocation what happened and this is my
[1:02:17] desire the Holy Ghost fell on the day of
[1:02:19] Pentecost on the is D now this is your
[1:02:23] promise this is my promise this is what
[1:02:26] I'm looking for for another day of
[1:02:28] Pentecost because the Pentecost is the
[1:02:31] nd is your holy convocation where the
[1:02:35] brother said it has nothing to do in a
[1:02:37] literal things it has nothing to do with
[1:02:39] your bills it has nothing to do with
[1:02:41] your problems
[1:02:42] it has nothing to do with how you feel
[1:02:44] it has nothing to do with if you're
[1:02:46] tired it has nothing to do with what's
[1:02:48] happening at home it has nothing to do
[1:02:51] with your problems it has nothing to do
[1:02:54] with the litter of things it's beyond
[1:02:56] that it's into the kingdom of God with
[1:02:59] eternal life my mind you may be seated
[1:03:08] with the predestination with the pre
[1:03:11] Testament that never did stopped you
[1:03:14] brother Branham said the pre-tensioning
[1:03:16] that never did stopped it never started
[1:03:18] on anything you wasn't saved on anything
[1:03:21] you was always saved Jesus come to
[1:03:25] redeem that but you were saved from the
[1:03:27] beginning because you had eternal life
[1:03:30] to begin with somebody shout hallelujah
[1:03:34] you had eternal life to begin with you
[1:03:39] maybe see them not only and some people
[1:03:42] they can't understand this excitement
[1:03:44] that you had eternal life to begin with
[1:03:46] because you know you have your troubles
[1:03:48] and you have your child's and your your
[1:03:50] testings what eternity you talking about
[1:03:52] if you know what my reality is you ain't
[1:03:55] tell me about eternity but I'm telling
[1:03:57] you there is a greater reality than your
[1:03:59] present reality you were always in God
[1:04:02] you were always in corner if your memory
[1:04:06] could go back to before there was a moon
[1:04:08] we thought it was a God had to react
[1:04:11] joke the question where was now when I
[1:04:14] lay the foundations of the earth
[1:04:16] the chalk is memory job where were you I
[1:04:19] want you to kind of remember that you
[1:04:21] come from a different place up don't let
[1:04:23] your trials get you down don't let your
[1:04:25] temptations get you town don't let your
[1:04:28] problems get you down
[1:04:29] where was dow when I lay the foundations
[1:04:32] of the earth and the morning stuff
[1:04:34] [Applause]
[1:04:48] you may be seated and by the banner said
[1:04:51] we have lived through all these types in
[1:04:53] here but when you hit the eighth you go
[1:04:55] on into eternity you don't come my laws
[1:04:58] and rituals and orders you come by
[1:05:04] predestination there's a genuine holy
[1:05:10] convocation and we are ending the seven
[1:05:13] church age church it's a Pentecostal is
[1:05:16] you see it we're entering that holy
[1:05:18] convocation we are entering into the
[1:05:21] real genuine eternity where the church
[1:05:24] is called not the sum station some
[1:05:27] denomination but into eternity your
[1:05:31] calling is into eternity with the
[1:05:33] eternal King mine so DFD what does it
[1:05:39] mean it means freedom the day means
[1:05:45] restoration the NT means redemption
[1:05:51] there means Pentecost he means a super
[1:05:56] Church
[1:05:57] if there means another Ephesians the FE
[1:06:01] means a baptism of the Holy Ghost DSD
[1:06:05] means your family has got to come dat
[1:06:08] means you get the Holy Ghost the idiom
[1:06:11] means you are touching dat means you are
[1:06:14] perfected the it means you are no longer
[1:06:18] preacher of time but you are creative
[1:06:20] eternity you could be walking the earth
[1:06:23] but you are eternity walking on the
[1:06:26] Eternity walking into the eternity
[1:06:30] walking on your charm eternity the
[1:06:33] storms to come eternity will be feeling
[1:06:42] of people and wanting an eternity put on
[1:06:47] flesh and this motor with the
[1:06:50] immortality and will be changed in a
[1:06:52] moment in the twinkling of an eye oh hey
[1:06:57] man he is there means that all that atom
[1:07:00] loss is coming back to the manifested
[1:07:04] sums up God it couldn't happen in the
[1:07:06] first stage it couldn't happen in the
[1:07:08] second day they couldn't happen in the
[1:07:10] Paul's day but in this day now after the
[1:07:13] seventh day in a bright age into the
[1:07:16] eighth a brother
[1:07:17] there's no devil there's no demon gets
[1:07:20] those spirit yes motion gets knocked out
[1:07:23] there's no unbelief there's nothing
[1:07:26] could stop the prize from taking her
[1:07:28] position there's nothing to stop the
[1:07:30] prize for possessing her individual
[1:07:33] inheritance
[1:07:41] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[1:07:45] hallelujah you may be seated
[1:07:49] hallelujah my my my my mind you see
[1:07:53] before Adam fell Adam was living in
[1:07:56] eternity there was no death there was no
[1:08:01] sickness are you with me
[1:08:04] I don't didn't know what that was he
[1:08:07] didn't know what sickness was he didn't
[1:08:09] know what it was to be depressed all
[1:08:11] Adam knew to do was if he didn't like
[1:08:13] where the mountain once he could move
[1:08:15] the mountain a little bit if you wanted
[1:08:17] to talk with a lion he could call the
[1:08:19] lion over Adam had perfect dominion
[1:08:22] perfect control but when Adam fell
[1:08:26] it brought time and it broke out of
[1:08:30] utility so it deep brings us back into
[1:08:35] eternity but I want to get that there's
[1:08:39] a different law when you're in time then
[1:08:41] when you are into eternity can the
[1:08:44] chance amen because in time you have
[1:08:47] gravity so where the Branum said a
[1:08:52] direct quote you say when you lift your
[1:08:54] hands you are defying a loss
[1:08:59] you will define the laws of gravity so
[1:09:02] it means whatever laws exist in time can
[1:09:05] be defined by a higher law against the
[1:09:10] law that covers the seven days and it's
[1:09:12] a different law for the east day so when
[1:09:15] you in the seven day law you in that
[1:09:20] time but in that seven day law somebody
[1:09:22] could be dead but when you bring the ad
[1:09:25] in the contact with the 17 law that dead
[1:09:29] life could get straight from the F P so
[1:09:32] when Jesus stood outside of the tomb of
[1:09:35] Lazarus they were in time but he's a
[1:09:37] creature of eternity he could sleep
[1:09:40] Donna
[1:09:45] the power that was spoken was not 70
[1:09:49] power that was 80 power that was another
[1:09:53] place that was powered not even from
[1:09:55] time and he said Lazarus come forth
[1:09:59] Lazarus had already left what that voice
[1:10:02] was able to cut two dimensions find
[1:10:06] where Lazarus was traveling him because
[1:10:14] it was a higher law
[1:10:15] [Applause]
[1:10:17] and the church seaman you may be seated
[1:10:20] and whenever the Indian law meets a 70
[1:10:24] law it brings a 17 laws under subjection
[1:10:27] so Jesus is sleeping on the boat the
[1:10:30] boat is subject to 70 law and the winds
[1:10:34] come and the storm come Jesus is
[1:10:38] sleeping he is tired the disciples are
[1:10:41] frustrated what are we gonna do their
[1:10:43] way Jesus up Jesus looked at the strong
[1:10:46] he looks at the sky he looks at them and
[1:10:50] he s Suites the eternal words water from
[1:10:54] a language that has spoken ent and he
[1:10:57] said peace be still and when that strong
[1:11:00] heard those words and recognized that
[1:11:03] was that man speaking that was seventy
[1:11:06] law that was the law of the east
[1:11:13] hey man you may be seated
[1:11:16] young people that's why you are going to
[1:11:19] make it and you're gonna get the Holy
[1:11:21] Ghost because the seed in your soul it's
[1:11:24] not a natural seed it's not a seed of
[1:11:26] these seven days it's an eternal seed
[1:11:29] that seed never had a beginning never
[1:11:32] has an ending for your predestination is
[1:11:35] stronger than your trials your
[1:11:37] predestination is stronger than your
[1:11:40] mistakes your predestination is stronger
[1:11:44] than your failures your predestination
[1:11:46] is stronger than the devil without power
[1:11:50] your predestination is stronger than the
[1:11:53] devil you recently as day
[1:12:10] you may be seated you may be seated
[1:12:15] hallelujah so when you feel down and you
[1:12:19] get a charge from your theophany your
[1:12:22] theophany is not trapped by the seven
[1:12:24] days your chi often is coming from
[1:12:26] eternity
[1:12:26] these bringing strength on the ESP the
[1:12:29] Eve's DS where the presence of God is
[1:12:31] because God dwells in eternity that's
[1:12:34] where all the power is the power is in
[1:12:37] eternity and that's what the table is
[1:12:39] afraid of because once eternity drops
[1:12:42] down here he is finished father let the
[1:12:45] fire for a holy convocation we are in a
[1:12:51] new team I don't know what's gonna
[1:12:55] happen I don't know what's gonna take
[1:12:57] place but I believe young people are
[1:12:59] gonna be baptizing in the kingdom
[1:13:01] because it's the 8th day another day of
[1:13:04] Pentecost and the church same
[1:13:07] [Applause]
[1:13:34] we may be seated hallelujah so your joy
[1:13:40] is not from the natural your joy could
[1:13:44] never be satisfied because your appetite
[1:13:46] has already been introduced to if their
[1:13:50] joy your appetite has already been
[1:13:54] introduced to the victory of the eighth
[1:13:56] day your appetite has already been
[1:14:00] introduced to success from the eighth
[1:14:02] day for nothing the world has to offer
[1:14:04] you good value anymore that's why when
[1:14:07] you're not in church you feel miserable
[1:14:08] you know your feel miserable when you're
[1:14:10] not in the presence of God because your
[1:14:12] appetite has already been introduced to
[1:14:14] something that is so good
[1:14:16] you can try different substitutes but it
[1:14:18] can never taste as good as the food from
[1:14:21] the eighth day it never tastes as good
[1:14:23] from the land of eternity because that's
[1:14:26] your destination
[1:14:27] it's eternal life you are not supposed
[1:14:30] to tire you are supposed to have eternal
[1:14:32] life you are not supposed to be sick you
[1:14:35] are supposed to walk over sickness and
[1:14:37] in this overtime addition because it
[1:14:45] exists in the empty in the if there's
[1:14:49] only creatures that have no beginning
[1:14:52] could be there and sickness had a
[1:14:54] beginning the devil had a beginning your
[1:14:57] trial had a beginning your problem you
[1:15:00] know when your problem started it had a
[1:15:02] beginning it must come to an end
[1:15:11] amen hallelujah somebody give God a
[1:15:15] shout of praise you may be seated
[1:15:24] I love that you know when your problem
[1:15:26] starts you know when the pain started in
[1:15:30] your body once you can identify the
[1:15:33] start point
[1:15:33] it means it's an ending because whether
[1:15:36] Panem said your salvation there was no
[1:15:38] beginning to it you was always saved
[1:15:41] he was always eternal if you can
[1:15:43] identify the starting point it's coming
[1:15:46] to an end I can identify my starting
[1:15:49] point because I always was always was
[1:15:52] part of God and there's no devil to take
[1:15:56] my name out there's no demon to take me
[1:15:59] out of God's thoughts when he was there
[1:16:01] all by himself before there was a moon
[1:16:04] before there was a star he was thinking
[1:16:06] about me he was taking about you you may
[1:16:10] be seated
[1:16:11] you may be seated for a minute what
[1:16:13] mystique that had a beginning could stop
[1:16:16] the eternal plan of God for your life
[1:16:18] what could you have ever done that had a
[1:16:21] beginning when you began fornicating
[1:16:24] that to never stop the eternal plan of
[1:16:27] God for your life because sin and
[1:16:29] fornication had a beginning it would
[1:16:32] have an ending because of the eternal
[1:16:36] power of God will destroy everything
[1:16:41] everything that can be shaken will be
[1:16:44] shaken only what eternal will remain
[1:16:48] [Applause]
[1:16:54] halleluyah halleluyah halleluyah may be
[1:17:02] seated the higher law of the eighth day
[1:17:11] the higher law of the eighth day Easter
[1:17:15] proved there is a higher law when
[1:17:18] they're nailed Jesus of the cross they
[1:17:20] all taught that he was dead even the
[1:17:22] devil himself understand this even the
[1:17:25] devil with all of his years of
[1:17:26] experience thought Jesus was finished
[1:17:29] and Jesus when he rose from the dead he
[1:17:34] introduced a new law that confused even
[1:17:37] the devil because while the devil is
[1:17:39] having a celebration there's a knock on
[1:17:41] the door they say oh wait a minute we
[1:17:44] invited all the VVIP to celebrate Jesus
[1:17:47] Moses was trouble
[1:17:49] Abraham was trouble he Leiter was
[1:17:51] trouble but this Jesus was real trouble
[1:17:54] so when we caught Jesus on the cross did
[1:17:56] the devil tortilla just celebrate but
[1:17:58] why the devil is celebrating there was a
[1:18:00] knock on the door
[1:18:03] this nut was not supposed to happen
[1:18:05] because under the law of the seventy
[1:18:08] when you were dead you supposed to see
[1:18:10] death but Jesus was not from the 17th
[1:18:17] so you look at me now with Zoe and I'm
[1:18:20] sixteen element but I'm not from the
[1:18:22] seventy I'm not from Trinidad
[1:18:24] I'm not from this world I'm a Leah I'm
[1:18:27] not from this world I come from God you
[1:18:33] may be seated
[1:18:35] oh Jesus he walks and open the door the
[1:18:40] devil is like who is this
[1:18:41] and here comes Jesus he knows me 2x
[1:18:43] permission because the higher law of the
[1:18:46] if he never needs to ask permission
[1:18:49] [Applause]
[1:18:53] when is the idiot just power when you
[1:18:56] speak it has to happen so Joshua was in
[1:18:59] the battle just wouldn't even understand
[1:19:01] what was going on but because he was in
[1:19:03] his Ephesus the Prophet said he was able
[1:19:06] to connect to the eighth day how many
[1:19:08] needed more light he could see strong
[1:19:10] stand still and Joshua didn't even
[1:19:13] understand the mechanics that is not the
[1:19:15] Sun that's moving is the earth that's
[1:19:17] moving but God had to translate three
[1:19:20] angels he says son standstill stop the
[1:19:22] earth move this TARDIS put things in
[1:19:24] place it didn't matter what had to
[1:19:26] happen what are some entity everything I
[1:19:30] needed something
[1:19:33] [Music]
[1:19:35] so I don't here we are chilling now
[1:19:37] right now when you recently if there and
[1:19:40] say daughter come back home God will
[1:19:44] move mountains he will move subways he
[1:19:47] will move planes up he will cancel
[1:19:49] flight plans to bring her back to the
[1:19:52] house of God
[1:20:00] you may be seated I told you I'm a spare
[1:20:04] tire
[1:20:04] I'm just here to encourage you tonight
[1:20:06] you may be seated but I pray this
[1:20:08] encourages somebody tonight to know that
[1:20:10] you have more power you have access to
[1:20:13] more power than the devil wants you to
[1:20:15] realize that everyone's gonna stay quiet
[1:20:17] and be a normal church member but this
[1:20:20] is not about church this is about you
[1:20:22] accessing who you really are when you
[1:20:24] recognize wait time wait a minute
[1:20:26] I always was I always will be because
[1:20:30] I'm a part of God and once the Holy
[1:20:32] Ghost is inside of my soul it's all over
[1:20:36] me it's keeping me alive and the Holy
[1:20:42] Ghost is what connects you to your
[1:20:44] destination and the church amen
[1:20:47] he may be seen
[1:20:50] [Applause]
[1:20:58] so under the law of seven days the Lord
[1:21:03] says because you fell in sin you're
[1:21:05] finished because you make a mistake
[1:21:08] write them off so finished but there's a
[1:21:15] higher law you may be seated
[1:21:21] there was a woman when Jesus was only
[1:21:25] yet it was not a report that was meat it
[1:21:31] was not here see there was some
[1:21:32] believers who caught her in the very act
[1:21:36] of adultery it wasn't we heard about it
[1:21:41] she was caught in the very act and they
[1:21:46] brought her to Jesus because they were
[1:21:49] thinking under the law of the seven days
[1:21:56] but when Jesus looked at the situation
[1:22:01] Jesus knowing that there's another law
[1:22:04] he didn't respond to their demands their
[1:22:07] judgments he just asked him a question
[1:22:10] you were out sin cast the first stone
[1:22:13] no problem if you want to go by the law
[1:22:16] of the seven days stone are no problem
[1:22:19] yeah but which of you witnessing you
[1:22:22] start and Jesus to not embarrass them he
[1:22:25] turned his back so that they can look at
[1:22:28] themselves it was no longer Jesus
[1:22:31] looking at them but they had to look
[1:22:32] inside and one by one they had to
[1:22:36] recognize you know what I forgot I had
[1:22:38] to go to the grocery I actually forgot
[1:22:43] my kids in school and one by one they
[1:22:47] had to go away and Jesus looked at the
[1:22:51] woman
[1:22:51] now this Vegas powerful he's a woman
[1:22:54] where they accuse us
[1:22:57] how much you look there was nobody and
[1:22:59] Jesus no against the law of the 70s
[1:23:03] which required her to be stoned said
[1:23:05] neither do I Jesus speaking later than I
[1:23:13] who come from God condemned me he
[1:23:18] introduced a higher you may be seated
[1:23:23] so when the doctor says tonight there is
[1:23:26] no hope your kiss is terminal we don't
[1:23:30] know what to do for you we don't know
[1:23:33] how to work the situation out we never
[1:23:35] saw this situation before that's the law
[1:23:38] of the seven days speaking there is a
[1:23:40] higher law from the eighth day that can
[1:23:44] heal any sickness that can perform any
[1:23:47] surgery when the family things that you
[1:23:50] can never change them they don't
[1:23:52] understand you there is a higher law
[1:23:54] when people think you're gonna give up
[1:23:56] when your marriage seems like it
[1:23:57] supposed to collapse there's a higher
[1:24:00] law when you can't pay your bills as a
[1:24:02] higher law you may be seated Jesus was
[1:24:07] not only interested in their spiritual
[1:24:09] needs but when they needed money to pay
[1:24:11] taxes he go fish they got food and when
[1:24:14] they cut the fish there was money to pay
[1:24:15] the bills because he was interested in
[1:24:18] their daily living and their lives
[1:24:21] because they were on a destination where
[1:24:23] they would need nothing you didn't hear
[1:24:26] what I said they were on a destination
[1:24:30] onto a test where they would need
[1:24:32] nothing so she was getting used to them
[1:24:35] getting provided for all of their names
[1:24:37] not what they wanted but for all of
[1:24:40] their needs that's what God does he
[1:24:42] wants to beat every need and if there's
[1:24:45] a need in your heart tonight he is able
[1:24:47] to meet whatever that means
[1:24:49] if you need healing he's able to meet
[1:24:52] that you need the Holy Ghost he's able
[1:24:54] to meet that you need to be restored
[1:24:57] he's able to meet that need you are
[1:25:00] backsliding here tonight he's able to
[1:25:02] bring you back and the church same
[1:25:09] friends we are coming to the end of time
[1:25:12] now when the message you may be seated
[1:25:14] future hope they have any bright money
[1:25:16] or think bright but the balance and how
[1:25:17] many features 110 and we read it it's
[1:25:20] called not a dispensation not 270 it's
[1:25:23] called the fullness of time and when the
[1:25:25] fullness of time has come that's when
[1:25:27] time has been fulfilled when there's no
[1:25:30] more time then you go into eternity
[1:25:31] after the seven church age is over I'm
[1:25:35] Mel Abraham said and it is Luthor's age
[1:25:37] is over Methodist age is over
[1:25:40] Pentecostal age is over now you go into
[1:25:42] what eternity no more sevens no more
[1:25:45] threes no more other there in eternity
[1:25:47] where there's no such things as numbers
[1:25:49] and times and things all mine you see it
[1:25:52] now so that's my hope friends and that's
[1:25:55] the same thing but the banner says he
[1:25:57] does when he gives you the Holy Ghost
[1:25:59] baptism with a fire he can come and
[1:26:03] dwell with you and we can sit in
[1:26:05] heavenly places in Christ Jesus because
[1:26:07] we are already in him not we will be we
[1:26:10] are now sitting in Christ Jesus how do
[1:26:12] we get into it by one Holy Ghost baptism
[1:26:15] by one spirit we are all baptized into
[1:26:18] Christ and it's not appropriate message
[1:26:21] question and answers before there was a
[1:26:23] world I love this quote you in God's
[1:26:26] thoughts to give you the Holy Ghost that
[1:26:31] settles every debatable
[1:26:33] every debate before there was a world
[1:26:36] you were in God's thoughts to give you
[1:26:39] the Holy Ghost because he knew you'd be
[1:26:42] wanting it and he chose you himself
[1:26:45] because you desired he chose you in
[1:26:48] Christ before you or Jesus any of you
[1:26:51] was on the dirt and he sent Jesus listen
[1:26:55] listen to the purpose to die to prepare
[1:26:57] the way to send the Holy Ghost to bring
[1:27:01] you so the Holy Ghost has to bring you
[1:27:04] to himself can the church shame at all
[1:27:08] he said this is the church so I'm on
[1:27:11] hold now see oh this is so rich to me to
[1:27:13] think it's not what I wanted it wasn't
[1:27:16] my desires
[1:27:18] it wasn't my will it wasn't my choosing
[1:27:21] I have not one thing to do with it but
[1:27:24] before the world ever started goats for
[1:27:26] us and put our name on the Lamb's Book
[1:27:28] of Life before they ever was a world
[1:27:30] talk about God so friends the purpose of
[1:27:34] the endtime message the whole purpose
[1:27:36] was to lose the Holy Ghost the Holy
[1:27:40] Ghost was bound in a river Euphrates for
[1:27:43] almost 2,000 years
[1:27:44] but Christ the Son of man feel and the
[1:27:47] Prophet loose the Holy Ghost loose your
[1:27:50] inheritance loose your promise but God
[1:27:54] didn't want the Holy Ghost to fall on
[1:27:55] your flesh on your ideas on your
[1:27:58] emotions on your pride because we just
[1:28:01] be Pentecostal so for all these years
[1:28:04] the Holy Ghost was disguised as the word
[1:28:07] and service after service the
[1:28:10] responsibility of ministers was to make
[1:28:13] sure that the full wood representing the
[1:28:15] mechanics was in you that's why the
[1:28:19] Prophet cause it a secret is the word is
[1:28:21] in the bride not the word is in the
[1:28:23] message ditches but the word is in the
[1:28:27] bride so how do you know who the bride
[1:28:29] is she container full would chickity
[1:28:32] correction
[1:28:34] repute chica take encouragement but I
[1:28:37] say tonight the bride has held the word
[1:28:39] seed long enough
[1:28:41] sirs is this the time for the rushing
[1:28:44] mighty wind and for individual to claim
[1:28:47] the inheritance you may be seen it for a
[1:28:50] minute I'm not gonna be too much longer
[1:28:51] at you but I want to strike something no
[1:28:54] there are times when it's got to be a
[1:28:57] group there are times you need to be a
[1:29:03] group an individual could engage Jericho
[1:29:10] took the whole army to go th Jericho are
[1:29:16] you with me so there's a season to be
[1:29:19] identified and be a group I want to read
[1:29:29] a cup of course Anamika but the man said
[1:29:31] in what was the Holy Ghost given for the
[1:29:33] same Holy Spirit that save the
[1:29:35] Lutheran's that sanctify the Methodists
[1:29:37] that baptize the Pentecostals is now
[1:29:40] setting in order the coming of the Lord
[1:29:42] Jesus and then why am i against
[1:29:45] organized religion but the vellum said
[1:29:46] the manifestation of the Holy Spirit is
[1:29:48] that angel trying to get the people back
[1:29:51] to the wood now this is all still group
[1:29:57] he said that oneness here we are at the
[1:30:00] end time coming from the east or west or
[1:30:02] north or south what are we doing getting
[1:30:04] ready for the rapture getting ready
[1:30:07] holding ourselves steady for a few
[1:30:09] minutes till every fiber is filled with
[1:30:13] the Holy Ghost
[1:30:15] [Applause]
[1:30:16] but by 1965 in the message of paradox
[1:30:20] but the Benham says and so has the
[1:30:23] church world in this last day it's come
[1:30:25] along it split its parts but it's coming
[1:30:29] a time with mercies it must do it there
[1:30:32] has got to come any visions also of this
[1:30:35] journey just as there was of other
[1:30:37] journeys they has come there has to come
[1:30:40] and Ephesians and Ephesus and Ephesian
[1:30:42] of this journey now but the Branham
[1:30:44] quarters that Ephesians parallels Joshua
[1:30:46] so when we read Ephesians we're reading
[1:30:49] Joshua when we be just what we read in
[1:30:51] Ephesians not only that listen carefully
[1:30:55] but the book of Ephesians is the book of
[1:30:58] trust one of the New Testament it's
[1:31:00] dividing and setting in order the
[1:31:02] overcome one so in this day and this age
[1:31:05] God is not placing any Church any group
[1:31:09] it's individuals who would possess their
[1:31:12] individual inheritance everybody with me
[1:31:15] now let me skip here we know this right
[1:31:19] is going to strike something but the
[1:31:21] Branham says here adoption how God says
[1:31:23] in the church for their labor pains and
[1:31:24] stuff like that but I want to come to a
[1:31:26] point here quite a bit here
[1:31:44] divining of the inheritance so it was
[1:31:47] after 40 years in the wilderness
[1:31:50] remember to turn him is over in the
[1:31:52] woman's for 40 years and the Bible said
[1:31:54] that for five years they fought together
[1:31:58] so after this circle of women for 40
[1:32:01] years there was five years where they
[1:32:03] went Jericho aai they took this place
[1:32:06] they did this place and five years now
[1:32:10] just for 13 verse 1 I'm not gonna be too
[1:32:13] much longer
[1:32:14] since now Joshua was old and stricken in
[1:32:17] years and the Lord said unto him go at
[1:32:21] all on sugar Gideon now when God says
[1:32:23] that to you
[1:32:29] the Bible is something else in him
[1:32:31] now Joshua was always feeling and the
[1:32:33] Lord said I am dull at home and stricken
[1:32:34] Indians what a word from the Lord
[1:32:40] I'm there I'm very minute yes very much
[1:32:43] land to be possessed so even though Josh
[1:32:47] with all and he's weary and he's tired
[1:32:48] and God is speaking to him without even
[1:32:51] seeing it in a in a way that we might
[1:32:52] think we have to say to make you feel
[1:32:54] not bad and say you're all used took me
[1:32:55] and but there's still land to be taken
[1:32:58] this is the land that gets remaining all
[1:33:02] the porters of the Philistines and all
[1:33:04] Kasturi
[1:33:05] from C Hall which is before Egypt even
[1:33:08] unto the borders of Akron northward
[1:33:10] which is coated to the Canaanites my
[1:33:13] Lords of the Philistines the Gaza types
[1:33:16] and the after tights and the s
[1:33:19] Canaanites the Hittites are the Accra
[1:33:22] Knights
[1:33:22] also the a fights
[1:33:25] and God is not done just will you hold
[1:33:27] your stricken in age but I want you to
[1:33:30] remember yes still more than here's an
[1:33:33] inheritance ahead of you
[1:33:36] you may be seated and it goes on from
[1:33:40] the salt all the land of the canaanites
[1:33:42] not some of the land of the canaanites
[1:33:43] but all the land of the canaanites and
[1:33:45] mara that is beside the Celia nights
[1:33:48] until effect to the borders of the
[1:33:50] amorite and I'm not done yet and the
[1:33:53] land of the tip lights and all Lebanon
[1:33:56] to what the Sun rising so when you see
[1:34:00] the sunrise in Joshua even though you
[1:34:02] old all of that land is your land
[1:34:05] [Applause]
[1:34:09] [Music]
[1:34:13] some bad human until the entering of
[1:34:17] hammett all the inhabitants of the hill
[1:34:20] country from Lebanon unto miss peretta
[1:34:23] meme and all the city only then will I
[1:34:26] Drive out before the turn of Israel and
[1:34:31] this is the instruction only divided
[1:34:34] though it by lot on to the Israelites
[1:34:37] one inheritance as I have commanded me
[1:34:40] you may be seated
[1:34:43] could you take someone you see this if
[1:34:48] you take somebody with you go on a
[1:34:49] little more you may be seated
[1:34:52] everybody who knows me I'm not a long
[1:34:53] creature but this word is eating good
[1:34:56] right now so that's just what 13 so just
[1:35:00] what chapter 14 the dividing of the
[1:35:03] inheritance begins and this way I want
[1:35:05] to go to church tribe by tribe they are
[1:35:11] coming to claim their inheritance this
[1:35:15] is what I've been waiting for this is
[1:35:18] what is learned about when they were in
[1:35:19] Egypt under the whip of the taskmasters
[1:35:23] didn't you that there's a promise of a
[1:35:25] land somewhere when they walk on the
[1:35:28] Egypt this is what the sound of songs
[1:35:30] about when Miriam play the tambourine
[1:35:34] you may be seated it had not been easy
[1:35:39] because when they walked out of Egypt
[1:35:41] and they thought they would be in the
[1:35:43] land unbelief forty years distant that
[1:35:50] should have been maybe a month forty
[1:35:52] years this circled and Tyler one my one
[1:35:56] except for Joshua and Caleb it had not
[1:36:00] been easy but that generation that had
[1:36:04] been born in the wilderness all the
[1:36:07] other heard about was this promise meant
[1:36:08] while in the wilderness the Promised
[1:36:11] Land is ahead when they were marching
[1:36:13] around Jericho the Promised Land assay
[1:36:15] in the Battle of AI a promised land as
[1:36:18] ahead and after forty and five years
[1:36:21] it's being divided
[1:36:22] no the tribe of Reuben comes forward and
[1:36:26] I could see Joshua he's old you ever see
[1:36:29] that he's stricken in age what you seen
[1:36:32] that's your land and the whole tribe of
[1:36:34] Reuben near rejoice because it's been a
[1:36:38] long journey better go key but it is
[1:36:40] with it and the tribe of Reuben they
[1:36:43] have their panels they help their flags
[1:36:45] and they say we have our land and then
[1:36:48] come the tribe of Simeon then the tribe
[1:36:51] of Levi and one by one Levi didn't get a
[1:36:54] land inheritance because they're the
[1:36:55] Levites and then and they come the tribe
[1:36:57] of Judah a warrior tribe strong warriors
[1:37:03] the royal tribe the tribe from the kings
[1:37:06] of Israel came from he may be seated for
[1:37:09] a minute are you with me tonight I want
[1:37:12] you to picture a young strong confident
[1:37:15] men of Judah and their wives and their
[1:37:17] children as they feel the strength he
[1:37:22] may be see that not only with the tribe
[1:37:24] of Judah been known for its kings but
[1:37:25] this drive had one unique distinction
[1:37:28] from every other tribe there was one man
[1:37:32] among them that was just different and I
[1:37:35] can imagine as the tribe of Judah is
[1:37:37] waiting to get their portion there's a
[1:37:40] stillness in the camp and it's a shuffle
[1:37:43] that's going on and it's a lone man he's
[1:37:46] walking walk in the front and you can
[1:37:49] see the smiles of the soldiers after
[1:37:51] watching respect as this man walks to
[1:37:54] the front of the tribe of Judah and he
[1:37:57] interrupts the proceedings he interrupts
[1:38:01] what has been handed tribe by tribe the
[1:38:04] interrupt was been handed to the groups
[1:38:06] and he said listen just one for those of
[1:38:12] you who don't know my name is Caleb I
[1:38:15] was dead
[1:38:18] when we left Egypt when we went into the
[1:38:22] land I was Nick I'm the only one
[1:38:25] standing who tasted the grapes God's
[1:38:29] grace was so good I for forty five years
[1:38:32] I can't get them out of my head
[1:38:34] the milk was good the honey was good
[1:38:38] Moses promise me now give me my Mountain
[1:38:50] you maybe seen it for a minute
[1:38:52] [Applause]
[1:38:59] Tennyson he left student he said I'm not
[1:39:02] speaking for the tribe of Judah I'm
[1:39:05] speaking for myself this was a promise
[1:39:08] Moses gave to me
[1:39:18] and the church can't somebody give God a
[1:39:20] shout of praise
[1:39:24] you may be seated for a minute Caleb had
[1:39:29] a revelation now you know the challenge
[1:39:36] and the message there's a lot of people
[1:39:38] don't know the Bible so because they
[1:39:41] don't on a Bible because the Prophet was
[1:39:44] to shine light on the written word so
[1:39:48] they're people who take the prophets
[1:39:50] message and don't even read the
[1:39:52] scripture but you know how the Bible
[1:39:54] describes Caleb
[1:39:55] the rabbit called Caleb Caleb the son of
[1:39:58] Jephunneh the kena sight so it doesn't
[1:40:02] the Caleb of the tribe of Judah I'm
[1:40:10] going somewhere so some theologians
[1:40:13] argue that he Levesque there are two
[1:40:17] possibilities on the one hand they argue
[1:40:20] he could be a Gentile or the best-case
[1:40:24] scenario he could be a cousin because in
[1:40:27] genesis 1519 the covenant that God makes
[1:40:31] with Abraham includes the land of the
[1:40:33] Canaanites so in Genesis 15:18 the Bible
[1:40:37] says in the same day the Lord made a
[1:40:39] covenant with Abraham saying on the dye
[1:40:41] seed have I given this land from the
[1:40:43] river of Egypt unto the great river the
[1:40:45] river Euphrates the Kenites and the
[1:40:47] canaanites and the Cadman eyes and the
[1:40:49] hittites and the perizzites so caleb is
[1:40:53] off the kemacite so caleb was not of
[1:40:58] judah by natural but somewhere along the
[1:41:03] journey caleb joined the ranks not only
[1:41:07] join the ranch but i wouldn't understand
[1:41:08] this he was one of the twelve that went
[1:41:10] into the promised land
[1:41:12] so not only in the turnarounds but he
[1:41:14] was such a soldier that he rose to the
[1:41:17] top of the ranch to represent the tribe
[1:41:20] of Judah
[1:41:23] how does a man who is that born of the
[1:41:26] tribe represent the child under laws of
[1:41:31] the tribes of Israel you have to be
[1:41:33] adopted into the trial to represent the
[1:41:37] tribe to admit that Caleb had to have a
[1:41:39] character worried that the tribe of
[1:41:42] Judah can count him worthy to represent
[1:41:45] the tribe when he was not born after
[1:41:48] tribe so when the devil looks at me and
[1:41:53] say you don't look like Judah you don't
[1:41:55] look like a Christian when I thank God
[1:41:57] that he still picked me up and put me
[1:42:00] into the tribe of the family of God
[1:42:02] because I was unworthy to begin with but
[1:42:05] if he left can make it I can make it to
[1:42:08] somebody give God a shout of praise
[1:42:17] you ever seen it for a minute is this
[1:42:25] there's so much I'm driving home on the
[1:42:29] individual part of this thing it moved
[1:42:32] from the tribal the group the engine is
[1:42:35] in this church it's with this group it
[1:42:37] with these two bunch of people and caleb
[1:42:39] is like I don't want to hear that
[1:42:40] tell me where's my mountain Reuben
[1:42:43] Simeon to reduce here the tribe
[1:42:46] afterwards tell me my mountain that
[1:42:49] Moses promised me and there's a lot of
[1:43:03] lessons we could take from this man
[1:43:05] korcula that we don't know much about
[1:43:07] but we know he made it can I just read
[1:43:10] from the Bible just for 14 verse 6 then
[1:43:14] the children of Judah came unto Joshua
[1:43:17] and gilga and Caleb the son of Jephunneh
[1:43:19] the Kiner sight said of him don't know
[1:43:21] as the thing this is not some extremely
[1:43:23] you don't know it's a thing that the
[1:43:25] Lord said unto Moses the man of God
[1:43:28] considering me in Kadesh Barnea what he
[1:43:34] is always I'm and Moses the servant of
[1:43:36] the Lord sent me from Kadesh Barnea to
[1:43:39] spy out the land and I brought him wood
[1:43:42] as it was in my heart
[1:43:45] nevertheless and I love listen I love
[1:43:49] this how Caleb could speak after 45
[1:43:52] years because listen he and I'm sure
[1:43:54] should have had his mountain 45 years
[1:43:58] ago it was because of his
[1:44:03] he had to be out of his mountain for 45
[1:44:06] years listen to how classy you may
[1:44:09] consider what a gentleman there's a man
[1:44:12] of distinction he said nevertheless my
[1:44:14] brethren that went up with me made the
[1:44:18] heart of the people melt there is no you
[1:44:21] are not hearing any animosity in in
[1:44:24] Caleb's speech he has let that go a long
[1:44:27] time ago he said you were there he is my
[1:44:32] near and my good brothers made the
[1:44:35] people's heart to melt told them the
[1:44:38] land is a hard land told them to not be
[1:44:41] desperate for the Holy Ghost told them
[1:44:43] or can a false teaching and the people
[1:44:45] got scared get lost the plan but we are
[1:44:49] here again another holy time has come we
[1:44:53] are standing on the verge of the
[1:44:56] greatest manifestations that the world
[1:45:00] has ever seen
[1:45:01] now therefore give me my Mountain
[1:45:04] [Applause]
[1:45:06] [Music]
[1:45:20] [Applause]
[1:45:26] so Sookie let didn't see my brothers I
[1:45:29] should have cut them off enough
[1:45:31] fellowship with them and those no no my
[1:45:37] brethren that went up with me fellow
[1:45:41] brothers fellow ministers I was late to
[1:45:45] come back because 10 brothers came back
[1:45:46] scared they came out quickly to give the
[1:45:48] negative reports but that's what you are
[1:45:51] you know you are nice here back to feast
[1:45:53] we came back late at night our stomachs
[1:45:56] were full the grapes were too good you
[1:46:02] may be seated
[1:46:03] but I only followed the Lord my God and
[1:46:08] Moses way on that day saying surely the
[1:46:11] land whereon divita trodden shall be
[1:46:13] thine inheritance and I cheiron's for
[1:46:16] ever because thou hast wholly followed
[1:46:18] the Lord Michael now friend you may be
[1:46:21] seated young people here that was the
[1:46:24] only man out of hundreds of thousands of
[1:46:29] people that held to the world of promise
[1:46:32] [Applause]
[1:46:34] Caleb would have lost friends he'd have
[1:46:37] lost relatives he'll have lost the
[1:46:40] people to encourage him money all these
[1:46:42] but that didn't change the revelation he
[1:46:44] had in his heart he said I won't leave
[1:46:48] but all that I am with all that I have
[1:46:51] with everything within me I wholly
[1:46:53] follow the law
[1:46:55] and Mars responds because thou has only
[1:46:58] follow the Lord it will be nine
[1:47:03] inheritance and that children's forever
[1:47:07] Caleb goes and now behold the LORD hath
[1:47:10] kept me alive as he said he's forty and
[1:47:12] five years even since the Lord speak
[1:47:15] this word unto Moses while the children
[1:47:17] of Israel wandered in the wilderness and
[1:47:19] now law I am this deer four score and
[1:47:21] five years old 85 years old as yet I am
[1:47:26] as strong this day as I wasn't a deer at
[1:47:29] Moses simple and fringe that stream that
[1:47:34] Caleb was speaking about was much as
[1:47:36] physical strength I believe it was more
[1:47:38] than that it was a strength of character
[1:47:40] there was a strength of purpose it was a
[1:47:42] strength of determination as my strength
[1:47:45] was now even so as my strength now for
[1:47:48] boat to go out and to come in it and now
[1:47:51] this is my friend now therefore give me
[1:47:54] this mountain
[1:47:55] we're at the Lord speaking that day
[1:47:57] without hurting that the oleanna comes
[1:47:59] were there and that cities were great
[1:48:00] and offensive so be the Lord will be
[1:48:02] with me then I shall do the drive them
[1:48:04] out
[1:48:04] has the Lord you may be seated
[1:48:09] [Applause]
[1:48:14] I'm not going to be too much longer
[1:48:16] the musician can get ready so friends we
[1:48:20] are bringing it to possessing your
[1:48:22] individual inheritance and we have been
[1:48:26] living by the evidence of the new land
[1:48:29] it's a good land it's a land of poet sir
[1:48:32] it's a land of grace it's a land of
[1:48:34] possibility it's a land of restoration
[1:48:37] is a land enough of redemption and any
[1:48:39] man in the message of paradox that
[1:48:41] believes God and takes him at his word
[1:48:43] no matter what the situation is God will
[1:48:45] perform another paradox to keep his word
[1:48:48] so what about our thing we have a
[1:48:51] mountain to possess a mountain from feet
[1:48:55] all the way to charity that's statue of
[1:48:59] a perfect man that's that's our mountain
[1:49:01] people don't want to talk about that
[1:49:03] much anymore because the goal of that
[1:49:05] mountain you have to pass brotherly
[1:49:07] kindness and that's the part of the
[1:49:11] mountain people when they reached here
[1:49:12] they whether the message perfect rang by
[1:49:19] proving weakness but a Branham said all
[1:49:20] God's strategies to take human vessels
[1:49:22] and shake the world with them like a
[1:49:25] Pentecost that's easy at Pentecost what
[1:49:28] did he do it taken them 10 days to get
[1:49:30] all emptied up but they were all
[1:49:32] standing there with their vessels
[1:49:33] turning up and God took him cells and
[1:49:35] fill them up they shook the world poured
[1:49:38] himself into them that's the need of
[1:49:39] today that's what we need today is empty
[1:49:43] vessels yes sir so God can fill them up
[1:49:45] God kind of use them as they are already
[1:49:49] filled up if you're full of theological
[1:49:52] training God can't use you God's got to
[1:49:55] have empty vessels so you can fill them
[1:49:58] in the message speak to this mountain
[1:50:01] the prophecy I believe that the Church
[1:50:02] of the Living God is moving into severe
[1:50:04] now and that's gonna shake the whole
[1:50:06] world that's the first time it's bins in
[1:50:09] the days of Jesus of Nazareth today
[1:50:10] human being asked anything that you will
[1:50:12] and it shall be given unto you oh it's
[1:50:15] gonna come to
[1:50:16] pretty soon I'm looking for it to happen
[1:50:19] in this meeting I'm wanting it to happen
[1:50:21] now that the anointing will strike the
[1:50:23] whole Church of the Living God and she
[1:50:25] rise to our feet like a mighty marching
[1:50:28] army the sick will be here by a word the
[1:50:30] blind will see the Deaf will hear the
[1:50:33] Dead will be raised up on the power of
[1:50:35] God but shake the world with the Church
[1:50:37] of the Living God we're in the process
[1:50:39] of it now be encouraged tonight friends
[1:50:41] you didn't call yourself God called you
[1:50:44] the Holy Spirit knows where you live
[1:50:47] where you work what time you leave in
[1:50:50] the morning
[1:50:50] what'd you have for breakfast he said I
[1:50:52] will never leave you I will never
[1:50:54] forsake you and the Holy Ghost comes to
[1:50:57] give you power that's what the Holy
[1:51:00] Ghost is for oh my the Holy Ghost come
[1:51:03] to give you power in the mess of what
[1:51:05] the Holy Ghost given for you could be
[1:51:07] gonna play something softly the Holy
[1:51:09] Ghost comes to give you power power in
[1:51:11] pray you take a person that's lived a
[1:51:13] good life but it's not about land he
[1:51:16] said they're always defeated oh I tell
[1:51:18] you I sure love the Lord by the brand
[1:51:20] I'm always defeated they've never get a
[1:51:22] prayer answered you fill that little
[1:51:24] woman with the Holy Ghost one time watch
[1:51:26] what takes place when she called before
[1:51:28] god she's not defeated she come boldly
[1:51:31] to the throne of God believing she has a
[1:51:33] right because she's a daughter of God
[1:51:35] might take that little man so cowardly
[1:51:38] the boss
[1:51:39] kick him all over the place he wait a
[1:51:40] minute here now something's changed see
[1:51:42] he got the Holy Ghost he gives you power
[1:51:45] your life is full of power and finally
[1:51:51] when the day of Pentecost was fully come
[1:51:52] they were all in one place in one Accord
[1:51:54] god I'd walked above them in the fiery
[1:51:57] cloudy I'd walk with them on the earth
[1:51:58] now something else was gonna take place
[1:52:00] something's fixin to happen they were
[1:52:02] all in one place in one Accord and
[1:52:04] suddenly they came a sound from heaven
[1:52:06] as a rushing mighty waited until all the
[1:52:09] room
[1:52:10] where they were sitting friends I don't
[1:52:15] know the need of everyone here tonight I
[1:52:19] don't know what trials you've had and
[1:52:21] what situations you had to endure but I
[1:52:24] know God is able he's able to meet every
[1:52:28] year he's able to change every situation
[1:52:31] around he's able to pour the holy
[1:52:34] lawsuit brother balance at the theme of
[1:52:37] every apostle has been have you received
[1:52:40] the Holy Ghost since you and if I have
[1:52:47] one desire in my heart for this meeting
[1:52:49] is to see individuals come into contact
[1:52:53] with the supernatural my prayer in this
[1:52:56] holy time is one small Lord that
[1:52:59] individuals don't see the need to
[1:53:00] possess their individual inheritance the
[1:53:03] baptism of the Holy Ghost to have that
[1:53:06] peace of eternal life drop down into the
[1:53:09] sockets of your soul
[1:53:11] friends many people have lost the burden
[1:53:13] for the Holy Ghost they accept teaching
[1:53:17] as a substitute for the Holy Ghost they
[1:53:21] accept being a member of the church as a
[1:53:23] substitute for the whole news they
[1:53:26] accept affiliations as a substitute for
[1:53:29] the Holy Ghost but there is no
[1:53:32] substitute for the baptism of the Holy
[1:53:34] Ghost
[1:53:36] going to church every day is no
[1:53:39] substitute for the Holy Ghost which is
[1:53:41] God's all life dropping inside of your
[1:53:44] soul I know the young people here they
[1:53:47] are Caleb's here there David what never
[1:53:50] had an experience with the Holy Ghost
[1:53:51] before my creds and night is that
[1:53:55] tonight is your night and if you have
[1:53:58] been feel like greater tonight you can
[1:53:59] be refilled that even as this convention
[1:54:03] goes on that this meeting would be your
[1:54:06] encounter with the supernatural
[1:54:09] friends when you look at Pizza Pizza
[1:54:13] made mistakes that same pizza
[1:54:17] when he said tower to Christ at sea
[1:54:20] chapter in Matthew 16 when Jesus began
[1:54:24] to reveal things he said no no you
[1:54:25] shouldn't die and Jesus and Peter said
[1:54:29] get thee behind me Satan
[1:54:30] but that didn't change Peters
[1:54:33] destination to be a to the upper room
[1:54:39] his mistakes didn't stop his appointment
[1:54:42] with the Holy Ghost when Jesus was about
[1:54:46] to be crucified that seeing Peter who
[1:54:48] walked on water when they came to me
[1:54:51] they say pizza weren't you with this man
[1:54:54] they said no that wasn't me they asked
[1:54:58] him again he said wants you in this
[1:54:59] marriage and no that wasn't me beaten
[1:55:02] study a lion and then you
[1:55:05] the third time he he used words he
[1:55:08] should have used Esther but that didn't
[1:55:11] stop people appointment with the upper
[1:55:13] room when Jesus died Peter went back to
[1:55:18] his always you went back fishing and
[1:55:21] many times situations come in our lives
[1:55:23] and when things go wrong we go back
[1:55:26] fishing we go back to what we used to do
[1:55:29] we go back to our comfort zone we go
[1:55:32] back to where we where we spend most of
[1:55:35] our time
[1:55:36] but that didn't even stop Peter Thomas
[1:55:40] appointment with the upper room
[1:55:43] had an appointment with an experienced
[1:55:51] Peter didn't even understand what was
[1:55:53] happening all he had was a promise to
[1:55:56] tarry in Jerusalem he had a word there's
[1:55:59] another holy time coming and Peter was
[1:56:03] there in the upper room with the other
[1:56:04] believers and the random said it was
[1:56:07] fifty days he said it took ten days for
[1:56:10] them to get it out but in all of a
[1:56:12] sudden there was a sound from heaven of
[1:56:16] a rushing mighty wind Peter didn't bring
[1:56:18] the sound he was just there in the right
[1:56:21] place obey the Word of God
[1:56:23] [Music]
[1:56:24] and the aid they drop down and evening
[1:56:28] and one by one the pillar of fire
[1:56:32] divided itself and went from person to
[1:56:36] person drop down to the sockets of their
[1:56:39] souls and give them an individual
[1:56:43] experience with God Himself
[1:56:46] there was no minister there was no man
[1:56:49] it was God Himself the pillar of fire
[1:56:52] that drop down not to the group not to
[1:56:57] the church but they had a individual
[1:57:01] experience Oh God that's what I want
[1:57:06] that's what I need I don't want to leave
[1:57:08] this convention without my own
[1:57:11] individual experience I don't want to
[1:57:14] leave this meeting without my own
