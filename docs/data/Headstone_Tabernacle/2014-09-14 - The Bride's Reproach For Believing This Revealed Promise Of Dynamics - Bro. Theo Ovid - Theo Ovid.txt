want to go to Numbers Chapter 13 and also we're going to read some from Numbers Chapter 14 we're going to read Numbers chapter 13: 30-32 and we going to Numbers chapter 14 and read a couple of verses verse 1 verse 5 vers 11 vers 23- 24 2731 and 36- 45 you can't remember all that but I'm saying that anyhow so we know that we are reading the word for all of you who haven't read your Bible for the whole week we making up time for you to reach scriptures sister oliv welcome we're back amen praise the name of the Lord sister Jun a reading numbers to verse 30 and the reason I'm reading the scriptures in this sequence is to give you a sort of sketch and I want to give you some homework for homework you want to read numbers 13 whole chapter and number 14 H work don't be afraid you might be testing on it but do the homework so reading verse 30 of Numbers Chapter 14 doubtless ye shall not come unto the land considering which I swear to make you dwell oh oh that's right I'm looking at 14 thank you thank you thank you these guys sharp on the word but amen ah this is good this is very very good that's how it's supposed to be I'm not where I'm supposed to be you say what what what's that what mean of this all right so Numbers Chapter 13 are want to read from verse 30 and Caleb Ste the people before Moses and said let us go up at once and possess it for we are well able to overcome it but the men that went up with him said we be not able to go up against the people amen for they are stronger than way verse 32 and they brought up an evil report of the land which they had searched unto the children of Israel saying the land through which we have gone to search it is a land that eated up the inhabitants thereof and all the people that saw it in it are men of great stature let's switch to Numbers Chapter 14 verse1 and all the congregation lifted up their voice and cried the people wept that night verse 5 then Moses and Aaron fell on their face before all the children of Israel of the congregation of Israel verse 11 and the Lord said unto Moses how long will this people provoke me how long will it be a they believe me for all the signs which I have showed among them verse 23 surely they shall not see the land which I swear unto their fathers neither shall any of them that Pro voke me see it but my servant Caleb because he had another spirit with him Hallelujah and had followed me fully him will I bring into the land where unto he went and his seed shall possess it am verse 27 how long shall I bear with this evil congregation which murmur against me I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel and their murmur against me say unto them as truly as I live sayeth the Lord as ye have spoken in mine ears so will I do to you your carcass shall fall in this Wilderness and all that were numbered of you according to your whole number from 20 years old and upwards which have murmured against me doubtless he shall not come into the land concerning which I swear to make you dwell therein save Caleb the son of jeffon and Joshua the son of nun but your little ones which you said should be a prey them will I bring in and they shall know the land which ye have despised let's go down to verse 36 and the men which Moses sent to search the land who returned and made all the congregation to murmur against him by bringing up a slander upon the land even those men that did bring up the evil report upon the land died by the plague before the Lord and Joshua the son of nun and Caleb the son of jeffon which were of the men that went to search the land live still and Moses told these sayings unto all the children of Israel and the people mourned greatly and they rose up early in the morning and got them up into the top of the mountain saying Lo we be here and we go up unto the place which the Lord had promised for we have sinned and Moses said wherefore now do you transgress the Commandments of the Lord but it is not but it shall not Prosper go not up for the Lord is not among you that ye be not smitten before your enemies for the aites and the Canaanites are there before you and you shall fall by the sword because you are turned away from the Lord therefore the Lord will not be with you but they presumed to go up onto the hilltop nevertheless the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord and Moses departed not out of the camp then the amalekites came down and the Canaanites which dwell in the hill and smok them and discomforted them even unto hor let's pray father we thank you for your word that's already anointed we thank you for your people gathered here hallelujah oh God give them water this morning give them Mana this morning give them bread this morning even the bread of life this morning take me out of the way and be glorified in all that we say and do in Jesus name we ask it amen you may be seated Hallelujah GL Hallelujah Glory it's so good to be here amen I uh wish I could re back much to Tuesday service thday service was a special service uh you should go on here to the website yes sir uh it's already there and um speaking about the website you know our Facebook page is online it's live and uh it's some of the things Express on it is really a blessing to me and i' like to share uh two of the things that I note a bad attitude is like a flat tire you can't go anywhere until you change it I

your support for this online Ministry because it is a Ministry and it is a responsibility and we take it seriously and we take it to serve and the next one that I love is if if you were accused of

front of a jury would there be enough evidence to convict you that's something to think about all the Jud say get out of here we want every that could convict you they love their enemies Ah that's Point number one Hallelujah they do good they do good to them that hate them that's Point number two Hallelujah they I caught them praying every day Aha and I see them through the window reading their

tie them up in Chains of love send them home for eternity Hallelujah P them down to the resurrection Hallelujah I sentence you to the Rapture for being a genuine Christian Give the Lord some Praises people hallelujah so you go to that Facebook page and get inspired hallelujah amen so this morning uh have a title the bride's reproach for believing this revealed promise of Dynamics the bride's reproach for believing this revealed promise of Dynamics and have an inspiration don't presume anything amen get thust sayeth the Lord hallelujah don't presume anything get dust to the Lord reproach to find fault to blame or disgrace all of this the bride must suffer like Abraham 25 years Believing on the promise of Isaac like Noah 120 years believing the promise of rain amen now let's go down into the word but the beat a message called reproach for the cause of the word God has a time and a reason for that time to fulfill all his work amen God knows just exactly what he's going to do we don't we just have to receive it as he give it to us but he knows and there is nothing going to go wrong with what he's planned to do so stop trying to assist God nothing is going to go wrong remember what we said on Thursday night because bam had something in his heart that was corrupt when God tell him don't go he still went back to seek the Lord to see if God will change his mind and when he went back God said go but it came from perfect will to permissive will and we will emphasizing the reveal word will of God Amen yes sir when the word reveal it it is the will of God it's not your dream it's not somebody text you it's the word being revealed and you falling in line to obey the word am because if you watch what God say and how God blessed people and you do that God have to bless you God must bless you because he's the same yesterday today and forever and if you see how God curse people and you do that God will have to curse you because he is just and he is God he to keep his word there is no respector of persons he is God and God Alone Oh give him glory now the scripture we read wasn't about unbelievers or make Believers or they wasn't God's people these were the people that God brought out these were the people that saw Miracles and these were the people that God was about to judge Oh Glory to God hallelujah know this message this morning is not an easy one but this is what I got from the Lord to bring to you he knows and there's nothing going to go wrong with what he plans to do it all has to come about and there sometimes have to have rugged and hartings to bring out the true nature of the object rain is born in ragged dragged thundering Skies God sets a time and has a purpose for everything he does there's nothing happened accidentally I love that to them that love the Lord and called according to his purpose even the bad things and the uncomfortable things working out for good so so get comfortable with being uncomfortable come on now say Amen somebody stop trying to get everything comfortable as you want it get comfortable with being uncomfortable get comfortable being under pressure get comfortable being under tension get comfortable having mind P get comfortable Hallelujah Glory count it not strange you're feeling uncomfortable count it not strange you got a battle to come in this morning come get not strange the devil didn't want you to be here this morning but you have to be here this morning because there's a word from the Lord for you hallelujah hallelujah now watch he said now what the BR I'm talking about came to church the two people carrying on making love in church vulgar and he's begging them to be quiet and the Holy Spirit said they in your hands what will you do with them there was a holy hush everybody was deadly quiet I thought oh God what must I do then I remembered if it happened in the warning of the Holy Spirit two before I said I forgive you amen and and that is what he wanted me to say because after all I've been guilty maybe not of that but I'm guilty and guilty of the least is of the whole so I said I forgive you and their Witnesses sitting here the Holy Spirit fell through amen yes sir now you see I believe that all these things had a meaning amen what would you do with the power why would God give a man power when the man don't have character that doesn't make sense he's going to abuse that power and God hates abuse God don't want no husband abusing no wife God even said if you don't treat your wife right he wouldn't even answer your prayer that's the word and this is how we go back to the Bible this is how we get guidance in how we live not just to sit in church and say Amen you got to live right you got to act right you got to do right I want to say it again again because what saying again if you don't treat your wife right God will not answer your prayer so you better go back to the negotiating table and S all the issues out glory to God why did you go there because I'm a pastor I'm supposed to go there don't go there this morning brother over stop me oh give the Lord some Praises people I will go wherever the Lord tell me to go there is going to be a Revival and we got to tie up all the Loose Ends brother Jan was trying to translate that loose end and he said the French don't have you know and the only way to say it is no more issues I like that tie up that there'll be no more issues once there issues but BR to tie up all the Loose Ends before the seventh Enders come before the Angels come he all the Loose Ends from Genesis tap all what was loose and you have to tap all the loosens in your life because when God sent the power he doesn't want it leak out so you have to make sure there is no leaks in your building come on now God want to tie up all the loose hands you loose living you loose life you loose attitudes the inspector coming to inspect your box car and he going to shake it CU see anything shaking and if there nothing shaken then he could seal the whole thing so you rud and back your husband how you get blessed with her serve him with reverence you could say what you have to say but say it respectfully you don't have to say it disrespectfully say it respectfully you could see what's upon your heart but say it with respect then it shows that you respect God you respect the word you're in the word in Ephesians children obey their parents you're in Ephesians praise God father don't provoke your children because you're the father no the Bible talk the balance children over your parents but father don't provoke your children treat them right it's a whole balance it's not an off balance business oh give the Lord some Praises people hallelujah hallelujah so the fathers have the responsibility the mothers have their responsibility the children have their responsibility the wives have their responsibility you have your responsibility every man have the responsibility Man by man all right okay so you want to see what you would do with the power the action to an action something comes to act and he want to see how you're going to react and God love to do that let somebody Mash your corn let something happen upset let something happen out of sync with what you expect God disappoint your expectation just looking at you yeah yeah let me see my son let me see how you can handle this one let your wife talk to you a certain way and check you out and see a grumping grumping grumping let your husband tell you something and see and check you out God loves to do that W but we sang and you sang sweetly We Shall Overcome come day this is the day you're going to start to overcome this is the day you're going to understand the test is given for you to overcome hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah can you remember the disciples returning back rejoicing because they figured that they were ConEd worthy to stand the reproach for his name all that live Godly in Christ shall bear persecution the reproach of the word you always have to stand this reproach in order he the purpose are you ready in order to give your testing the reproach is always to give your testing see so when God tell Abraham a son go can make it right there you know see God Son next week look out next night mon you get Isaac then Abraham W call like you know you Kentucky chicken instant food we call it fast food fast food that's fast fulfilled promise but you see you see patience is waiting on God and for God and and you can't get patience quick you no fast food Pati fast God doesn't work patience like way must have his perfect work that could be entire lacking nothing so when God give a promise he just put time on it give time for people to laugh at you Hallelujah time for people to mock you look God tell brother brandham he will kill the Caribou big big beer how long it is and thing like big big Caribou when they were hunting the grass were so low people tell brother brandom it have no Caribou here but AB bam said I have nothing to do with that if God say 42 in if God say kibu if God say Grizzly tip or whatever it is if God said that he is able to make it come wherever he want to come so why they talking and they talking and the grass there there when they look back so Carib Grizzly tap or whatever it's right there who did that our business not to figure out how God doing it our business find out what God promised and let the devil know we believe that I I don't know when God going to fulfill it my my my faith is to believe Dynamics is promise power is promise not not a one power no it's promise in other words power is Minds it is promise God said so I want to be like Caleb have another spirit with me because them F brought an evil report and God say as I live they're going to fall in the wilderness they're going to perish because I brought them out to give them all these precious promises that by these promises they can be a Divine partaker of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world to L in other words you said you may be seated you take it today you are saying that you can't live that this is the promised land whenever you say that I don't know about that and no that's saying just like what them evil report the land is a good land these people were so backed in spirit they say God would to God be tied in Egypt my God you bring us out here to perish no you come out here to possess amen hallelujah my so you always have to have this reproach to get a test and every man that comes to Christ must first be child trained for the purpose that God has ordained you for remember if you could just keep quiet amen that way we ball We Carry On we not keeping quiet watch remember if he call you for this there is nothing that can keep it from happening amen are you ready yes there is is not enough Devil's in torment but what God word will be made manifest I'm still reading you are born for a purpose and nobody can take your place oh give the Lord a big Hallelujah now he said you were born for a purpose tell the Devil he's a liar you were born for a purpose that purpose must be fulfilled do you know God raised up pharaoh to bring down Pharaoh so friends you could only understand God by faith and which is by Revelation not by intellect intellect cannot comprehend God Jesus because intellect is limited there are no sense in intellect of man to contact God outside of the sense of faith and faith is a revelation amen so the prophet said that there is no school the Myst of God reveal no theologians no teachings of the Bible among any school they cannot know nothing about it it is impossible for them to know anything about it God here we go has hid the senses of knowing it from the very elected teachers talking about Gifted Man gifted teachers and their senses can't comprehend it so what they pump in the word with is intellect the front lobe back lobe Square lobe wherever lobe you have the G matter that is what they're pedaling intellect because God is not known by intellect are you with me that is why they were ignorant and unlearned Peter was ignorant and unlearned Peter couldn't sign his name Peter couldn't sign a check Peter may not even able to count all the bills but he they had to take note he had been with Jesus that man knew God not about God he can't read about it he can't read so knew about God he knew God because God was veiled in him mid alive as was in Moses god veiled in Peter it wasn't reading about God it was saying Silver and Gold Have I None what do you have I have God in Me what is it what is it God above us fire Cloud God With Us Jesus Christ and then God in you the Holy Ghost itself that's what always God purpose to hide himself in man to wrap himself in Earth vessels oh my you're getting me excited treasure in Earth and vessels you are the Earth and vessels he want to wrap himself in oh Hallelujah Hallelujah Jesus what's the first sign behold I give you a sign a virgin shall conceive and she came with a firstborn wrapped in swaddling clothes wrapped up the baby wrap up Jesus he WRA your wrap you up wrap up your spirit into your life some tall some short some fat whatever it is it doesn't matter God veiled God hiding himself God choose to hide himself oh what a wret I am but God choose to hide himself you talk about praises and honor and Glory when you understand what manner of love is this that God could choose to wrap himself inside of you that you got God WRA gift you got a Christmas gift you got the gift of the Holy Ghost that's your promise the promise of the father my God if you don't have it you're going to get it nothing could stop it from coming to you because that seed is in your soul that predestinated mystery is inside of you oh glory to God what a jubilee time what a joyful time there's the best time of your life Hallelujah you may be seated this world going through a crisis Russia Ukraine Israel all kind of thing all over the world never has the world been such a terrible time when you could see they don't know what to do up to today they cut on somebody else head Isis a man of AE worker is demon powers loosed on the earth Hallelujah Hitler the brains behind Hitler was an educated man but brother B said look what education did did not even think in his demon power Satan riding the Earth streams up you can't fight that with your intellect you can't fight when the enemy comeing like a flood what standard are you going to raise what strength do you have praise God we getting tired we getting old we hanging in there for years believing a promise remember for 400 years they were believing a deliverer was coming generation after generation expectation after expectation reproach after reproach baring but they believe anyhow they tell it to their children and tell their children tell it to your children and tell your children tell it to your children and tell it to another generation that a deliverer is coming to bring us out of bondage and I have a testimony from you that God say tell it tell it to them that fire coming power coming Deliverance coming there is one standing among you he's going to baptize you with fire and with the Holy Ghost hallelujah what am I preaching I'm preaching Dynamics why are they fighting when I am preaching I am preaching the promises I am not off the word I am not talking no cuckoo Doctrine or any funny thing I am not doing that this is your promise and the bride around the world is being reproach this morning for believing our promise of Dynamics Hallelujah not promise of more Mysteries sorry sorry not promise of more knowledge promise of Dynamics I'll tell it to you brother B say you don't even have to know you don't even have to know the mechanics I don't have to know the spark plug going to the engine and this all I want to know when I put the key the car starts crank gone to the dry and the EXC carberator and this and that I don't need to know that all I need to know when I turn that key that engine tumble and I could go where I want to go that's the same thing you need the Holy Ghost there tumble that key hallelujah praise God start the engine and let's get going with a Revival bunch of stories and intellectual nonsense confusing the people messing with their minds no faith whatsoever amen no expectation no genuine worship because you see you got to be free to genuinely worship God you can't have no issues amen why you think I can freely put all the message on the internet because I am free I am preaching the word let everybody judge it let the Pope in Rome listen to it it is still the word I am not ashamed of the Gospel I am not ashamed of what I preach I am not ashamed of the promise of Dynamics you may be seated how ABR must have suffered he had a tough one God make it hard for the People by putting a old man under promise of having a child and he wife can't produce nothing God said Rock them H Rock their mind amen shake up the intellect they know it can happen so it had to be God hallelujah when God when God do something like that when when it shake the intellect when everything looking impossible that's why God Shake tell them a virgin shall conceive no wonder Isaiah didn't go back in the human Spirit to figure that out and say you know what a virgin shall conceive I can't say that Lord that's human business but if God said a shall conceive them guys only speaking the word look look look when Joshua tell them we crossing over three days and he tell them high priest go down to the river them guys are fumbling and wondering and this one say I can't swim I didn't go to swimming classes there wasn't that they just take up the ark and they walk straight down to Jordan and as the foot touch the Jordan Jordan open up that's the kind of man we need we need men that would obey God man that would completely obey him I know some people like Moses they have problem with Joshua Moses was a pleading man oh God spare them take me don't take them Moses make a turn in the wilderness Wilderness man Joshua I have no Joshua is Warrior it never said Moses the warrior Joshua is a warrior his ministry is different his behavior is different he's an action man so if you want Moses Ministry you're in the wrong Church am Joshua is is take the land every place you put your foot is are you taking the land stop wasting time in my land take it or get out I think on the Facebook page have stop making excuse make progress like the home stop making excuse make progress good Lord I hate to see deadness and a dead young person is the worst kind of dead there is if somebody old old Caleb day and they fall asleep that you could understand that the day long they venard they battle through all things but to see a young man nding and bbing and like that did you need voice of the Archangel we went through pray a fasting every week once a week you know we went to all night prayer meeting the thing these young people don't even read books they just D the surviving off the parents gas Hallelujah when I say gas I mean gas I mean bed pillow fridge stove everything you're still in your mother's home you fa nothing yet Hallelujah when David went out to meet to meet his Brethren to carry food David didn't know he was gased up for Gad notice his brothers have no gas to give him his brothers have no inspiration to give him his own Brethren had no anointing for him they had no encouragement for him on the contrary they were reproach him they were asking him what he's doing out here they were asking him why you stay home with the Sheep but David said isn't there a cause isn't there a reason why I am how I am because I have to deal with something you not dealing with it but God raised me up to deal with it I'm anointed for it oh give the Lord some praise His People and that is when you come into the position to know who you are and to know who you are to know where you come from and to know where you're going listen friends Miracles is about to Break Forth Miracles I'm not talking about blessings I say Miracles things that you don't even expect changes that you didn't expect miracles real Miracles is about to happen prepare for miracles miracles the miraculous Hallelujah because omnipotent going to speak Hallelujah and when omnipotent speak Miracles start to take place cripples going to start to walk blind going to start to see death going to start here and the dead I see them raising already right inside of here oh hallelujah hallelujah that husband of yours going to be delivered oh yeah that wife of yours going to be delivered Oh Glory to God hallelujah some people Fai so low their faith so weak they prefer to label the wife or husband than to pray in faith believing they'll be delivered they prefer to say my husband is a sued or my wife is a this or my husband is a that or my children is that and they say you know what devil is a liar he might be all twisted up he's a worm but he's a butterfly you have that worm Behavior cor ground but I prophesy that them butterfly wings going to come God going to take him under the cocon of his love God going to take him and cover him Under the Tent of his presence Under The Canopy of life and under that canopy of Silence God going to transform you from the inside out oh glory to God glory to God you may be seated you have natural genetic disposition DNA stuff in you that you can't control that God allowed to your family lineage to be a certain way some are strong some are aggressive some are quiet some of this that some worry a lot some have faith some have doubt Hallelujah and you have no control over that amen but that what God have in you is beyond that that's why the Bible said the word is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart so when God go past your family genes your gen your genetic disposition when God go past all of that you see a mystery inside of there and God had to activate that mystery to make a call which is a deep calling to a deep and afterward you can't help it I don't care if your mother was a drunkard that don't make you a drunkard I if your father I used to drink and I was a big Boozer that don't make you a boozer God going to bring you out this is a day of Miracles this is a day of coming out but God want you to confess that the land is a good land don't confess your doubts don't talk about your fears let the weak say I am strong oh give the Lord some Praises people now watch you may be seated so God hid the very senses of knowing it from the elected teachers elected teachers who teaching Bible who teaching message you say here this he has been revealed to me and then the life that Christ produced here in the Bible that same life that's in him does not produce itself in you then you have the wrong Revelation am oh brother over you mean it's not just Revelation and I can say multif that's not a word it's not Revelation and being able to M things no the Revelation has to produce a life God is not know my intellectual fate blind leaders of the blind notice God hold his key alone God is not known by education he is not known by how to

you mean the Holy Ghost going to be with you yes in you teaching you directing you Spirit Le word living Guided by God Noam says God is known by Simplicity and a revelation of Jesus Christ in the most illiterate person huh amen hallelujah amen watch and the life of Christ projecting itself through you with men instead of trusting the word I'm not standing by no man people supporting this one and that one I'm standing by the word if any brother standing on the word I'm standing with him I don't even have to meet him Paul was in the Arabian Desert and when he get to Peter they're speaking the same things and when Paul had to bust and straighten out Peter Paul bust and straighten out Peter because Peter was going contrary to the principles of the word so you have to straighten on Peter when Peter had to write he said you had to be watch how Paul WR because Paul is a you know Paul say I'm strong things I can't talk like Paul because Paul had different capacity and so forth everybody have different capacity and position and calling and so on and God have to begin to reveal to the Brethren what their calling is no man can tell me stay there you know that your calling they not my Holy Ghost they might want to be I mean my denominational Pope guide or something like that but I'm not allowing them that for privilege because God already take that position up there Have No Vacancy for that There's No Vacancy to Lead Me There's No Vacancy to direct me you have no position for that Holy Ghost already take up that place to direct me where he wants me to go what he wants me to say and I will only say what he wants me to say praise God friend on no friend family or no family Hallelujah and ask my sons that I tell them like it is ask any one of them tell them I love them very much but I don't love them stripp it I love them with all these enses am Hallelujah I love them to rebuke them to correct them to Amen to challenge them that's how I love them they have no Pastor son privileges ask them what make a pastor son different from any other son or Pastor daughter from any other daughter is he same some of them is Big Rascals someone get the most trouble in the church they protected by Pastor ask my sons I'm not playing with words I'm not playing with games this just how I am Hallelujah Glory oh praise God hallelujah you see you have to get disconnected from the senses part to really connect to God because your children will mess you up I tell people live for the Lord don't live for your children put God first your turn get old and leave you forget about you live for God put God first God first God first amen if I take on all the issues and pule issues I will will not even preach oh God my heart oh god oh pray for my Saints since you know what it is a stress out if I come here with that what kind of thing is that I can't afford to do that that's right no no no no no it's the word right is right and wrong is wrong God no respect to a person isn't that right you love him oh praise the name of the Lord so watch by lack of Revelation is why there are so many different divisions today and so much mockery so much divisions Among Us is because the people lack that Revelation they lack that Revelation the teachers could you imagine the teachers lack Revelation they have knowledge but not Revelation oh my so here is Lucifer again limiting the word of God to his reasonings that is Lucifer now from SMA Church age here we go when the church gets away from the word it will believe anything that's right huj now do you realize like Eve when Cain was born she say I've gotten a man from the Lord now listen to this Revelation brother Bram is breaking here do you realize that she really meant that she taught that she had a man from the Lord you see once she had been deceived by taking the word of Satan instead of the word of God she then Tau that whatever she said was right and if she said she had a man from God then she had a man from God but God has set his laws in the universe a good seed can only bring forth good fruit a evil seed can only bring for evil fruit now each seed true different will utilize the same Earth nourishment moisture Sunshine but it will bring forth of its own kind amen now if you look at the statement of Eve read close you will notice that she had more of an understanding than most realized she did not attribute the son to Satan for that would have made him equal with God so Eve had deeper thoughts than you might might appear only God could create the egg in the womb of Mary Satan couldn't do that Eve knew that Satan can only pervert so he beguiled her with the wrong seed it was the serpent seed that brought forth Cain it was Adam's seed that brought forth Abel and Seth those seeds went through the same process but the children were different for they were different seeds she believed that Cain was from God she accepted the devil's lie as the truth of God that is exactly what we have now churches set themselves up as Fountains of the truth but the truth is not in them they have begotten children swear by them and would even kill to uphold their error if you think that's an exaggeration read 2 Timothy chapter 3 I charge thee therefore before God and the Lord Jesus who shall judge the quick and the dead at is appearing in his kingdom preach the word be inant in season out of season reprove rebuke exalt with all Longs suffering and do for the time will come when they will not endure song Doctrine but after their own lust shall Heap to themselves teachers having itching ears and they shall turn away their ears from the truth and shall turn to fables but watch thou in all things and your afflictions do the work of an evangelist make full proof of thy Ministry when the church allow herself to move away from the original like Adam and Eve death set in there is no strength in her amen she has become a monstrosity the minute the church moved towards form and ceremony and towards priesthood by organizing the ministers into a group that decided leadership apart from the Holy Spirit and his word that very moment death entered when she started to get sick and she got sick she charged she changed to a powerless group of people whose only weapon was argument when I studying this and I read this I said my mind was totally blown only weapon AR argument she could produce nothing in the spirit for her hopes were built on program and not on faith in his word they sld program they read program they sld perversion they read perverted children you tamper with God and you reap exam L what you injected what would happen if you change your truth into a lie the answer is you will breed an antichrist Godless system of religion that is so perverted it will not look like or produce that original what he original did the only answer that God has for a situation like that is the Lake of Fire there are those who say that God's people are going to come together through a collective Revelation I want to get to this this is Brother Bram at his time there was a saying in that time that Elijah Ministry of Malachi 4 is a collective Ministry it's a body Ministry and he had to refute that listen to this there are those who say that God's people are going to come together through a collective Revelation I challenge that statement it is uh it's a ball inv valid assumption in the face of Revelation 10:7 now I do not deny that people will prophesy in this last age and their Ministries can and will be correct I do not deny that there will be prophets even in the days of Paul PA there was one akabas a prophet who prophesy a famine I agree that is so but I deny upon the infallible evidence of the word that there is more than one major prophet messenger who would reveal the Mysteries as containing the word and who has the ministry to turn the hearts of the children to the fathers thus sayeth the Lord his unfailing word stands and shall stand and be Vindicated there is one Prophet Messenger to this age on the basis of human behavior alone anyone that where there are many people there is even divided opinion on lesser points of major doctrines that they hold together who then will have the power of infallibility to be restored in the last age for this last age is going to go back to manifesting a pure word bride so in other words once they are men there'll be differences that's a us when there are people in family there are differences in churches there are differences he said who is going to bring back that infallible word because they're going to have a pure bride are you with me amen now watch the second to that must be impressed okay sorry that means here we go we will have the word once again as it was perfectly given perfectly understood in the days of Paul I will tell you who will have it it will be a prophet thoroughly Vindicated even more thoroughly Vindicated than any other prophet in all ages from Enoch to this day that is the magnitude of vindication are you with me because this man will of necessity have the Capstone prophetic Ministry Hallelujah hallu so do you CAU what brother Bram had he had the Capstone prophetic Ministry so his ministry revealed the Mysteries to bring down the Capstone itself therefore this Prophet has reveal every mystery no man can come back to reveal no mystery it has already been revealed we have to find where it is written where it is hidden but it's already in the word because Malachi 4 at the Capstone Ministry oh Hallelujah God will show him forth he won't need to speak for himself amen God will speak for him by the voice of the sign the second thought that must be impressed on our hearts is that the seven Church ages started out with the Antichrist Spirit as well as the Holy Spirit yes listen to the approach of him going to the scriptures 1 John 4:1 beloved believe not every spirit amen but try the spirit you have a dream who said that is God people take every dream for God they see alligator they see a tiger and they see a FL every dream sometime you eat corn too late in the night some you ovat and everything get cross up and then you get some pictures in your head and they come out off your bed with that even if it's songing good you could write it shelf it you know watch it but don't come out with it and all you're looking for it unless God give you a direct Vision fear not Joseph to take unto the Mary thy wife Joseph G in a dream amen a dream Hallelujah I know she going through her reproach I know she going through her thing everybody mocking and laughing but that is what the bride have to go through but you're pregnant but Messiah you're going to produce the Life of Christ do you believe that all right believe not every Spirit but try the spirits whether they of God watch watch because many false prophets are going out into the world not little many did you notice it the Antichrist spirit is identified with false prophets the ages came in with false prophets and they go out with false prophets now of course there's going to be a real false prophet in the grand sense of that man mentioned in Revelation but as now before this Revelation there had to appear many false prophets Matthew 24:36 and they and if any man shall say unto you Lord has Christ believe it not there shall arise false Christ false prophets shall show great signs and wonders in so much if it were possible they shall they see the very elect behold I have told you before wherefore if they say unto you behold he's in the desert go not forth behold he's in a secret chamber believe it not these false prophets are A Marked for us in various other scriptures such as 2 Peter 2 1-2 and there were false prophet among the people even as there shall be false teachers among you who priv shall bring in damnable heresies even denying the Lord that brought them and bring them from themselves Swift Destruction for many shall follow their piceous ways by reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of 2 Timothy 4:3 and 4 for the time will come when they shall not end your song Doctrine but after their own lust shall he to themselves teachers having itching ears and they shall turn away their ears from the truth and shall return to fables 2 Timothy 4:1 the spirit speaketh expressly that in the latter time shall come many shall depart from defate given he to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils now in every case you will notice that a false prophet is one who is outside the word just as we showed you that Antichrist mean anti word so these false prophets come perverting the word giving it a meaning that fits their own devilish ends have you ever noticed how the people who leads others astray bind them closely to themselves by fear true I want to repeat that have you ever noticed how the people who lead others astray bind the people to themselves by fear yes am that is true they say if the people don't do what they say or leave then destruction will follow they are false prophets amen for a true Prophet will always lead one to the word and bind the people to Jesus Christ and he won't tell the people to fear Him or what he says but to fear what the word say Amen oh hallelujah hallelujah so I'm exalting you this morning on the word brother bam give me a church here we go full of the Holy Ghost Hallelujah God will do in one year what all the theology fail to do in 2,000 years you wait till the anointing of the church really strike home that's what we looking for that's the Dynamics we're talking about we are looking for a church full of what full of the Holy Ghost full of what the Holy Ghost Hall after the doors of the gentil is closed God will a church then he do filthy be filthy still oh praise God notice here we go Moses he was the anointed word for that promised word for that day isn't that right Noah was the anointed word for that day Abraham and so forth now watch and Moses stood there that anointed word of that day that's why he could put his hand in his bosom why he was standing in the presence of God you see when Samson is under the anointing he could do anything when Moses under the anointing these guys could do anything it wasn't Moses it was the presence it wasn't Moses what a she kind of Glory it wasn't brother Bram one time God told do you think it's you healing the people you have to remind brother Bram you see it was so automatic it was so flowing he said you think it's you healing the people it's God was healing the people is that man healing the people is the virtue flowing freely hallelujah oh hallelujah hallelujah isn't that right so Moses the glory around him every move he made represented God are we ready that is where the church ought to be standing now Hallelujah he said but we are off on something denominational something so the church now should be representing God every move we make supposed to be under the glory and direction of the spirit direction of the spirit not intellect give you scriptures me L by the spirit of God that the sons of God now watch God spoke I must deliver brother talk about Moses whether he like it or not he said not to be different but to be obedient obedience is better than sacrifice God had so much complete control of them till he was their voice and their action I like that God had these men so much under their his control his control that those men became his voice and action it wasn't a matter a man studying to bring forth a message no it was a matter of the man so much in the presence of God that he spoke for God they were one with their message they were one with God isn't that right Hallelujah God had so much complete control of them tell he was their voice and action here brother give me a church that's so completely Anointed with God till their very action and move is thus sayeth the Lord walk in that CH kind of Glory I will show you a messiah anointed one standing upon the face of the Earth hallelujah oh Hallelujah so he is predicting he is prophesying give me a church full of the Holy Ghost he is predicting he is prophesying a church Anointed with God hallelujah a church Anointed with God what is that the promise of the father Jesus told a woman well we know what we worship the father seek such to worship Him in spirit and in truth we didn't have the full truth to the ages it only now God could get proper worship because William Brandon brought the fullness of the word back to the people with the fullness of the word comes the fullness of the spirit so it's only now God could release the fullness of his spirit so we can't act ignorant we can't act like we don't know we have 40 years of this messag amen right in the earth 40 plus years God filtering taking out the MCB believer the unbeliever halfway believer whatever because he have to work True Believers oh praise God that woman of the well was a True Believer you know she just didn't know it yet yet she was trapped under phariseeism she was trapped under her caral life but that didn't hinder that seed inside of her and some of you might be trapped inside of head but that's not going to hinder the seed of God inside your life that's why God will open his eyes big when this one in this condition and that condition and that condition is religious people open their eye big and find fault with this and find fault with that but we have all sin and come short of the glory of God are you with me oh praise the name of the Lord hallelujah let's get down a little deeper now Abraham father of Nations how many children you do you have at this time that old critical spirit would criticize what did Abraham said stagger not the promise of God why you have prayed here so and so that doesn't matter if I prayed for 10,000 tonight this is Brother Braham and 10,000 died in the morning tomorrow night I'll still anoint and sick and pray for them God said so doesn't stop it one bit but that's the reproach for the word hallelujah so whenever you believe a promise and God put time on that promise amen hallelujah that's you bearing a reproach for the word hallelujah your wife say where is the promise your husband say where is the promise your neighbor say where is the promise church members say where is the promise but you are believing a promise and you are believing it and being a reproach for the very word itself watch the scess of baress I like that combination scuff of baress praise God being scuffed praise God the reproach of baroness first she had to stand the reproach of being Barren for all those years that's right no life you're talking about life that's the Thunder that shake the devil the life behind the name that make the demons tremble oh what the TR that need is thousand of live Voices All they talking about virtues for years since the 70s about virtues virtues virtues Brothers tell me he said all Revelation tund is like what a baptism all you baptizing the father and Holy Ghost all the real name years ago Big Shot minister in trinad here he said God all come to a dead end but we going on in Mysteries and the Mysteries open up to us this brother gave a powerful testimony went upb Saban Canyon and a spirit enter him enter into him that's his testimony Spirit enter him and tell him go back and open the seven seats to his church I said Woo when I hear that said

and that man was bringing quot upon quot upon quot upon quot and they know where they find the quot you know but brother bam said the Lord have him to say certain things to to to to to throw off some have things said a certain way right so watch bam says you could have the back ghost 24 hours and still be lost but what they didn't go down deeper is that there is body there is soul and there is Spirit now if you don't need the Holy Ghost Peter can to bypass the room Peter could have said I my name is in the book I have a seed in my soul but every time they Bo look him he go run because he have no power he's sealing his soul but with no power but when he got the Holy Ghost he got the Holy Ghost upon the Seas and his soul Peter not running anywhere Peter said this is that that the prophet Joel spake of I don't know why I'm saying all of this you may be seated and afterward he say you come to De and the Lord show me that's true we come to dead end but we die at the end and God show me Joshua Moses came to dead end and Joshua take over Jesus came to a dead end and the Holy Ghost take over the Thunders bring you to a dead end it has to bring you to a dead end Hallelujah if you bypass the tree of life you jump on the tree of knowledge and you get plenty Mysteries off that Knowledge Tree Oh Glory to God we have been there before brother George Hallelujah we have been

something you that wine and oil is connected together and wine is the power of stimulation by Revelation and when something is revealed it gives stimulation to the believer amen so when people shaking

today people will support the 10 ministers because that a big number it's 10 them saying the same thing yes they all saying the same thing yes who those those two thing they are to it different it easy to believe teachings and doctrines than to believe the promise of Dynamics because the Bible said people have itching ears silly woman Laden with lust keeping on themselves teachers having itching ears the ha itching to get more Mysteries more Revelation more interpretation itch else because the promise looking long it looking hard because you have to prepare yourself for it amen it's a promise of the father it's the promise of the Holy Ghost hallelu the promise of Dynamics and I am preaching it till it come to pass amen amen yes sir so if you're tired here in Dynamics I'm sorry for you because I will be preaching it and preaching it and preaching it because one day the rain is going to fall you think Noah wasn't tired 120 years what the message it will rain but you know what's the evidence of he believing that the a is building if Noah say it will rain and what you doing about it it Go rain who knows but no was building yes sir while prophesying building yes sir pressing building it's going to rain power going to come Dynamics going to come it's going to rain amen what but over is the same message you preaching that's what BR tell me who leave here I'm preaching the same message you're preaching to light of course I'm preaching light I'm not a heavy preacher I do have a message of my own I preaching another man's message yes William bam is the prophet I am a prophet God didn't say to you as a prophet I am not a prophet in case you thought I was no I don't amen I am not presuming amen I am holding on to th sayth the Lord because this is what the prophet brought th say the Lord oh Hallelujah okay let me just SCP down now so but say a man watch here this the church is supposed to be predestined to adoption of children where a man a man can God can take a man adopt him into the family and give him something first try that a man came last night pillar fire appear over my home angel on one side angel on one side and whatnot and different things and you hear that testimony you chump Angel and what not the first thing to do what try that not take that and run with it you hear what Pastor say did you try it he said try it all I do want to say don't want to try it oh all want to hear nice things oo then you'll be deceived this is the word here the man claims a certain thing try it try it and see if is right if it is right move right with it and say Lord send us something else isn't that right so I want you to understand you have to suffer a reproach for the revealed word Mary had to suffer a reproach for testify she going to have a Christ she going to have a son she going to have a baby and she know no man isn't that right now presuming the word presuming mean taking things for granted Venture with authority isn't that right I'm going quickly but Bram they were presuming they were right because they had priests and their synagogues if it doesn't matter whether truth or error whether what we do how we live what we preach it doesn't matter listen to this why did God let 6,000 years of suffering and perils and death strike the human race if he just didn't let Eve get by with one little miscued word he is a god of anger he's a God of Justice he's a god of Holiness he said what if I was in the street he said now watch talking about love could you imagine having a little boy I said honey just go ahead if you want to drink that liquor your six-year-old boy Daddy won't stop you I love you too much if you want to take my shotgun with two shells on it and Hammer back I love you too much to stop you brother say that ain't love what if he was out in the street Daddy I want to make mut pies out there where cars are going 60 m down the street I love you too much honey to stop you you want to do that I know it Daddy loves you too much well go go and get killed you go and get killed your child want to make mud pies in the middle of the road he will get killed he said now watch a real daddy will shock the hide off of him that's the matter today you're trying to preach the gospel with soft gloves on presuming is all right here we go I'm going to finish Israel here presumed that they were all right they went up they said why we are the people of God God come here in Egypt sent his Prophet down with a pillar of fire brought us up here slew Fu right before us smoke the land with plagues flies Le lice hail upon the land protected us glory to God hallelujah that what they're saying and as we come to the Red Sea here come Pharaoh God opened the Red Sea by his mighty power we March to the Red Sea God love us so much that he turned and said look around at your enemy I'll drunk behind you not only that he sent us angel food fell every night and that Prophet said and the word of the Lord said don't you go up there if you do God won't be with you but they presumed that they go up anyhow God is too good you know God love us Pentecost don't never get that in your head woman I can bub my hair I can do this I can do that God heal me one time God give me the Holy Ghost one time that's right but don't you trespass that Divine in line hallu I'm going to tell you sin lays beyond the boundaries of God's word listen stay with the word amen look didn't Jude said earnestly content for the faith 896 they already got away from it I'm skipping on quickly oh praise the name of the Lord are you with me amen now watch that tree started growing what happened the church was cut down and the tree started growing what did it do they organized it God cut down the branch off it withered died like Jesus said he pruned it up come Wesley another Branch coming on it what did he do organize god prun listen that's God's tree but as they organized he cut it off who did it not the devil God cut it off that's not what he wants and the Tre pushing up he keep cutting it off go cut people in this message he will once they go would cut him off cut off the blessing cut of the fountain same God same God people claim to be serving same God testimonies you have to continue Contin to serve God but said this way he said a lot of ministers and I'm saying this think that they no longer have to serve God they get so secure with the congregation they feel they could do anything and get away with it Hallelujah afterwards they feel secure there so much people that have Deon Elder they feel secure and everything else that they start to little make little small sin little small thing here and afterwards God leave them they don't even know the church is void of God yes it have sermons yes it have scriptures yes it have quotes but where is the Living God Among the people amen amen hallelujah it does not zve it doesn't put us on a throne each one have to serve God daily the elders in here the deacons in here the ushers is here God hates abuse amen abuse of authority abuse of position that is why God have to give people character and test first before putting them in a power humbles people to see what's in their heart yes so God keep cutting it off want to read something here look how B bring it who came first John the Baptist preaching what repentance who come next Jesus Christ and he put Jesus under sanctification second move amazing father San them to thy truth what come next the baptism of the Holy Ghost John keep brought what repentance Jesus brought sanctification and then the holy ghost that why if I don't go Holy Ghost will not come I have to go for the Holy Ghost to come isn't that right so therefore after the word is the spirit Elohim came down with flesh on him and give Abraham a fresh promise I will return to thee according to the time of life no more flesh coming back again is Spirit to come so the spirit is what is Promised You have to wait for it yes do you believe that amen so watch along the church ages here four terites come the first one What it Took the fruit of Brotherly Love took it off next thing coner worm the leaves of Fellowship suck the very life out of it we have too much of God is a good god he loves me too much to punish me he promised he loved Adam he Lov Eve he is love but he has to keep his word amen oh praise God God never does deal with a group he does with an individual Israel presumed he was just so good they seen so many things that they could do they wanted to do isn't like a teenage boy that's the way the church is today they feel well God give me the Holy Ghost if I want to do this I can do this that goes to show it's not there if you was in Christ you'll hold to his word regardless amen do you believe that am don't presume don't Venture without Authority Samson presume I ain't got Lo anymore I presume I'm the same old guy and when Sams Shake himself no power was there Hallelujah am brother watch what did we do the Revival started 14 years ago Pentecostal found out she couldn't stretch herself no more because she organized in little groups and hated one another they church people so disc scor among Brethren and the Revival Struck it the even light come in what did she do she could do nothing because she organized she lost her strength her brother love the fruit of the spirit I'm almost done listen closely Samson thought he is still here you better be feeling he's still here a and taught when he took the wedge it won't be noticed a preacher said to me brother brandham does it make a difference whether it's this way or that way sure it makes a difference that's the very lie that Satan told Eve it does make a difference well as long as the rest of them does it I don't care who does it or who doesn't do it I don't want to do it anyhow I am not presuming that's all right cu the rest of them does it God requires this and this is what I've got to have amen I am not presuming about nothing amen Lord You Lord Adam said I won't be noticed it don't make a difference but it did make a difference Ian said it won't be noticed it w make a difference but it did make a difference that one little wedge upset the whole program of God oh hallelujah amen you see what B went on to say now a confession is a stone you say I confess Jesus Christ I confess to believe the message but you need a stone T meon to shape you you need to be shaped your confession of believing brother Bram is not good enough your confession of believing Jesus Christ is not good enough now we come to church to get as Pastor Stone Mason to bust some crack on your stone to shape you he said into the image of the Son of God oh Hallelujah you said watch Noah okay almost done God hallelujah wow whoa Noah take my time say take my time oh Hallelujah Noah time they presumed if it come like a flood like Noah well the only thing they will do is jump in their own boat them say they have their own boat they go jump in it but there was only one boat that was God constructed I believe I belong to the church I do this I do that but there's only one group that God constructed and that is not a denominational construction it's the word Construction revelation of his power constructed the boat you see God gave a revelation to Noah was build the boat of shittim wood now shittim word is a soft word an absorbent word any intellectual PhD person hear that Revelation go say it's false because that word go to sink but God tell him that word because God have a further Revelation to add that revelation God going and put Pitch on the outside and pitch on the inside to seal the boat and that is the word to absorb the ceiling that is the word to absorb the ceiling and the Seven tunders is the wood to absorb the spirit the seven Thunders is the mechanics and charity is the Dynamics oh hallelujah hallelujah so may be seated so the seven tunders is supposed to strip us of self strip us to nothing strip us like wood that God could send the spirit and seal it on the inside and seal it on the outside and the devil has no part with me oh I feel good now oh Hallelujah that was the further Revelation that God was going to break to Noah God oh man watch God constructed God watch so many prophets today telling so many different things get the people confused don't presume that's right just watch for the Vindicated promise let's go there you are Pentecostal Mr B million miles you went after sensation instead of waiting for the word to be fulfilled Hallelujah it is always the leaders that get the people out of the will of God watch it was Kora it was an uninspired leader hey Moses think he's the holy man didn't God put the spirit of Prophecy upon all these people took it over Moses and put it here so we just listen to this group Moses think he is something God told Moses separate yourself watch Moses was God leader Moses was Vindicated to be that leader all that didn't listen to him perish Jesus was God's leader the Holy Ghost is the leader and all that don't obey the Holy Ghost who wrote this Bible will perish so you know who the leader is right now the Holy Ghost not some man from anywhere else it's the Holy Ghost he was sent to lead the church isn't that right now Jesus said wait he said Isaiah 2611 said precept must be upon precept isn't that right watch They Know listen Peter jumped in and said wait a few minutes watch skipping fast Hallelujah he said Peter had to preach Hallelujah the very next day he preached on Joel in the upper room when he recognize people struggling to hold on Peter come next day and preach on Joel he said it shall come to pass in the last days I'll P my spirit and so forth they were waiting they wasn't presuming they had anything they were waiting until the scripture was made manifest oh brother I wish it wasn't this late we would like to stay a little bit they waited for scripture Authority because the scripture said how it will come you can't imagine how it going to come the scripture talk about the power the scripture talk about how it going to come they talk about there is my spirit flowing freely come on say Amen somebody the scripture speaks about it do you believe that now watch Moses one time presumed without a witness without an experience he heard words that he was to be deliverer but he didn't have the call he didn't have the experience so he presumed that he could go and take over oh Hallelujah and you know I'm the Moses he killed one man and run because he presumed that because he is supposed to be deliverer because his mother told him what God told her he had a second hand hearing God never talk to him he didn't hear direct from God so Moses went in the power of His intellect to try to deliver the people and he failed big time he fail big time but when that Pillar of Fire when that fire in the burning bush when that struck Moses there was no failing now Moses can say ain't no stopping me now I'm going straight down to pharoh I'm going to tell him let my people go I'm anointed I'm Commissioned I heard from God make the pill of fire had an experience with God who could stop a man that have met that Pillar of Fire oh God glory people oh hallelujah hallelujah Glory Glory Hallelujah glory to God Amen praise God praise God hallelujah look at that I'm closing with this music going please but brandham this in obedience this little faith woman that's you that's the bride I'm talking about that lives by faith amen the bride yes watch she is believes the word of God hallelujah

manifest the word brethren can't you see that I hope that didn't go for you the body is waiting for which is the word waiting for the life which is the spirit to confirm it or make it alive she is waiting for it here is MM no other life would work in her Hallelujah no other life will work in her she can't come to life any other way we can't put Hidden Mysteries and beat her into life she has got to get dynamics that is why there's a fivefold Ministry yet because it take Dynamics to bring forth the fivefold ministry I am contending for it I will preach till I die because this is the truth amen amen the pillar of fire will be veiled in the adopted Sons oh there are going to be some adopted Sons Oh Glory Hallelujah Hallelujah watch watch God yet she feels it out there she know it's going to happen and there it happens then she wakes up hallelujah hallelujah children of Disobedience Disobedience means Rebellion I look that up in the dictionary Rebellion Rebellion against what the revealed word of God like Cain rebel against Abel's revealed Revelation Vindicated of God that he was righteous the Pharisees with their only denominational knowledge of what the word was selected
