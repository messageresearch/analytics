[13:59] it together
[14:00] if your Bibles I want to run through
[14:02] some scriptures tonight
[14:04] and there's a photograph of my heart is
[14:07] building an altar
[14:09] building an Old Town and we want to look
[14:12] at Genesis chapter 12.
[14:15] I want to read from verse 5 to 8.
[14:18] Genesis 12. five to eight and Abraham
[14:21] took Sarah his wife and not his
[14:23] brother's son
[14:24] and all this substance that they had
[14:26] gathered
[14:27] and the souls that they had gotten in
[14:29] haran and they went forward to going to
[14:31] the land of kingdom
[14:33] and into the land of Cain and the King
[14:36] and Abram passed through the land onto
[14:39] the piece of chicken onto the plane of
[14:41] Mori and the Canaanite was in the land
[14:45] and the Lord
[14:47] appeared unto Abraham
[14:50] and said unto thy scene
[14:52] will I give this land
[14:55] and dear
[14:57] build it he and alter
[14:59] unto the Lord
[15:01] who appeared unto him
[15:03] so an altar is something that is built
[15:07] it's not just
[15:08] a a happening
[15:11] our altar is actually built and he
[15:14] removed from dense unto a mountain of
[15:16] the east of Bethel pitch his tent having
[15:19] better on the west high on the East and
[15:22] dear
[15:23] he builds up altar unto the Lord and
[15:26] called upon
[15:28] the name of the Lord when Anthony's
[15:30] message on Wednesday night Genesis 22
[15:33] when I go to levels 7 of Genesis 22 if
[15:36] you want to follow with me uh any Bibles
[15:38] like just listen
[15:40] and Isaac speak unto ibraham's father
[15:43] and said my father we know the story he
[15:45] said yeah am I my son he said behold the
[15:48] fire and the word but where is the Lamb
[15:51] for a burned offered and Abram said my
[15:55] son God will provide himself a lamb for
[15:59] good offering so they went put them
[16:01] together
[16:03] and I came
[16:06] to the police which you've got to pull
[16:07] him off and Abraham built an old idea
[16:11] and laid the wooden order
[16:14] and born Isaac's son
[16:16] and laid him on the altar
[16:19] upon the wood
[16:21] and Abraham stretched forth his hand
[16:23] took the night to sleep son and the
[16:25] angel of the Lord called unto him out of
[16:27] Heaven said Abraham Abraham he said Lena
[16:30] thine hand upon the lad do you do out
[16:33] anything unto him
[16:40] [Music]
[16:41] when Abraham lifted up his eyes and
[16:43] looked and behold behind him around
[16:45] quoting a ticket by his voice and
[16:48] Abraham went and took the ram
[16:50] and offered him up for burned offering
[16:54] and instead of his son and Abraham
[16:56] called the name of that place Jehovah
[16:59] Jireh
[17:01] in the Mount of the Lord it shall be
[17:04] seen okay so we want to go to Genesis 26
[17:07] but we didn't go just yet
[17:09] note
[17:11] and alter is not just a place of often
[17:14] prayer
[17:16] or it is a police are offering sacrifice
[17:19] and the sacrifice is what breaks that
[17:22] prayer effective
[17:24] because the animal takes the place of
[17:27] the guilty one making that petition to
[17:30] God
[17:31] and it's almost as if
[17:33] this is a natural obviously ritual
[17:37] that connects Heaven to Earth
[17:40] that connects this invisible God
[17:43] and you're back to wonder why is it that
[17:48] God connects with an altar
[17:50] or why God connects with a burnt
[17:53] offering
[17:54] why God connects with sacrifice
[17:57] and why our lives have to become
[18:01] sacrificial
[18:02] our lives have to come to our own water
[18:05] where we
[18:07] could see that representation of
[18:10] ourselves they are the altar of the
[18:12] animal being burned
[18:13] you know we sometimes we talk about the
[18:15] flesh being singed
[18:16] we talk about a huge note we talk about
[18:21] cherubims and seraphims like Isaiah
[18:23] experience where he could say who is me
[18:26] and come to that spot it means that you
[18:31] have no more excuses
[18:33] you're not blaming brother sister Pastor
[18:36] Elder Deacon neighbor Boss family
[18:39] there's nobody to blame
[18:41] it's it's coming to a better sincerity
[18:45] where you recognize how little you are
[18:50] how filthy you are how unclean you are
[18:54] how undone you are in his presence
[18:58] and this is the great battle
[19:00] there are so many people natural
[19:03] and I don't want you to think about
[19:04] individuals I want you to think about
[19:06] that natural part of you
[19:09] that hinders you you know where I'm
[19:12] talking about the greatest enemy is
[19:13] himself
[19:15] we all have that natural part that part
[19:17] where we want to do our own thing and
[19:19] yet we know each other goals you will
[19:21] and God's mind and we don't want to
[19:23] pause long enough because we are afraid
[19:25] that God will not give us what we desire
[19:27] we have our own results we have our own
[19:29] thoughts or ambition gonna allow our own
[19:32] computer in fact they can use that term
[19:34] to run however we wanted to run and make
[19:37] our own decisions and based upon our own
[19:41] decisions we see fruitable
[19:43] and sometimes I hear but I was actually
[19:45] often we don't sometimes think things
[19:47] through to see secondary
[19:50] circumstance secondary situation
[19:53] secondary results of what we do
[19:56] and that's why there's a scripture the
[19:58] father
[19:59] eats our grapes and the children's teeth
[20:02] are on edge
[20:04] it just goes to show the effect of what
[20:08] the errors of the fathers or the sins of
[20:12] the fathers the effect that have upon
[20:15] the chamber so let's continue we want to
[20:17] look at Genesis 26 this is Abraham San
[20:20] Isaac now verse 12 of 26.
[20:23] then Isaac sword in the land
[20:26] receiving the same year a hundred food
[20:29] and the Lord blessed him
[20:31] and the man works great went forward and
[20:35] grew until it become very great that's
[20:38] Rock Street went forward grew until it
[20:41] became very great as Isaac
[20:42] and he had possession of flocks
[20:44] possessions of hoods great store of
[20:47] servants and the Philistines
[20:50] Nvidia and all the worlds which is
[20:53] father's servants are digged in the days
[20:55] of Abraham his father the Philistines
[20:58] had stopped them and fill them with this
[21:02] Isaac go from us much mightier than we
[21:07] an exactly party then speeches tent in
[21:09] the valley of jira and Dread there and
[21:12] Isaac dig again the wells of water which
[21:15] they are Diggs in the days of Abraham's
[21:17] son
[21:17] for the Philistines that stopped them
[21:19] after the death of Abraham and he called
[21:21] their memes after the memes which his
[21:24] father called him so again
[21:26] you see Isaac Abraham's son trying to
[21:30] get a continuity after the death of
[21:32] Abraham Philistines blah blah but he'd
[21:35] go back digging and Neiman verse 19 and
[21:38] Isaac silvans digged in the valley and
[21:41] found there a well of spring and water
[21:44] and the urban of jira stitched private
[21:46] Isaac with men saying the water is ours
[21:49] and he called the name of the world
[21:50] essec because it's true with him
[21:55] and it's true for that also and he
[21:57] called the name of it sitna
[22:00] are they removed from then so is that
[22:01] keeps shifting did they go well here
[22:03] they carry on they want to argue and
[22:05] fuss you move another place
[22:07] and remove from dance dig another well
[22:11] is it still well no for they that's true
[22:13] and this and and for thee that's true of
[22:16] not and he called the name of it
[22:18] Rehoboth and he said for no
[22:21] the Lord has made room for us
[22:24] and we shall be fruitful in the land
[22:27] this is very interesting two Wells fight
[22:29] and battle third well good Lord behave
[22:32] believe that word of everybody in that
[22:35] room for all of us
[22:37] and he went up from dance to Beersheba
[22:40] and the Lord appeared unto him that the
[22:43] same night and said
[22:46] I am the god of Abraham thy father
[22:50] fear not
[22:51] for I am with thee and will bless him
[22:55] and multiply thy seed
[22:57] for my servant Abraham's sick
[23:01] what did Isaac do he was 25 tell us and
[23:05] he builded an altar there
[23:08] and called
[23:09] upon the name of the Lord
[23:11] and pitched his tent there
[23:13] and the Isaac savants did the well now
[23:17] we're getting somewhere I want you to go
[23:18] with me right with me Leviticus chapter
[23:21] 9
[23:22] is where you get this whole picture of
[23:25] this Altar and his sacrifice because it
[23:28] hasn't been built a certain way you have
[23:30] to have a place where you would and the
[23:33] animals and everything else listen to
[23:35] Leviticus chapter 9 verse 1 came to pass
[23:39] on the Eighth Day by doing everything
[23:41] Central
[23:44] and the eighth day that Moses called
[23:46] Iran and his sons the Elders of Israel
[23:48] and the Elders of Israel is it this is
[23:50] Moses called he said at the Iran take
[23:52] the young calf fast enough
[23:58] offer them before the Lord
[23:59] and under the tune of Israel thou shots
[24:01] speak soon taking a kid of the goats for
[24:04] a sin offering a calf and a lamb both of
[24:07] the first year without blemish for
[24:09] abundant now watch the details because
[24:13] we know Christ the perfect lamb was
[24:14] coming this man with his own blood
[24:17] orphan sacrifice once forever we know
[24:19] that but I'm showing you that it was
[24:22] required of them to present and offering
[24:25] for sin a sin offering was called
[24:30] to sacrifice before the Lord and I meet
[24:33] offering mingled with oil
[24:35] and this is Moses prophesying to Iran
[24:38] for today
[24:41] the Lord will appear among you
[24:43] and they brought that much Moses
[24:45] commanded before the Department of
[24:47] Public congregation
[24:48] and the congregational Junior and stood
[24:51] before the Lord and Moses said this here
[24:55] we go is the thing
[24:57] which the Lord commanded that you should
[25:01] do and the glory of the Lord shall
[25:04] appear unto you
[25:06] is almost as if
[25:08] God is waiting for
[25:11] certain things to be done and then you
[25:14] get a reaction from him let me read out
[25:16] this again and Moses said this is the
[25:20] thing
[25:21] which the Lord commanded that you should
[25:23] do you
[25:25] and the glory of the Lord shall I pray
[25:28] unto you Moses said unto Aaron go under
[25:32] the altar
[25:33] offer thy sin offering thy burnt
[25:36] offering make an atonement for thyself
[25:40] and for the people and offer the
[25:43] offering of the people and make an
[25:45] atonement for them as they recommended
[25:47] and iron therefore went under the altar
[25:50] stood a calf as an offering which is for
[25:52] himself and the sons of Aaron brought
[25:55] the blood unto him he dipped his finger
[25:57] in the blood and put it up on the horns
[26:00] of the hotel
[26:03] I'm going to skip down to verse 15. and
[26:06] he brought to the people's offering and
[26:08] took the goat which was the sin offering
[26:10] for the people Sue it offer it for sin
[26:13] as the first he brought the burnt offer
[26:15] and offered it according to the manner
[26:18] he bought a meat offering verse 18. he
[26:21] slew also the Bullock the run for
[26:22] sacrifice
[26:24] watch verse 22 and even lifting up his
[26:27] hands towards the people and bless them
[26:30] and came down from offering of the sin
[26:32] offering and the burnt offering and the
[26:34] Peace of me and Moses and Aaron went
[26:36] into the timer of the corner again and
[26:38] came out and blessed the people and
[26:41] looked at Prophecy Before so right here
[26:42] now the glory of the Lord
[26:46] appeared unto all the people
[26:49] Moses prophesied that if they do this
[26:53] thing that the Lord wants his glory
[26:56] shall appear among them it was done
[26:59] and he had a glory of the Lord appearing
[27:02] at all the people and this part is
[27:04] interested in verse 24. and there came a
[27:07] fire
[27:08] out from the Lord
[27:11] and consume upon the altar the burnt
[27:14] offering and the fact which when the
[27:16] people saw they shouted and fell on
[27:19] their face
[27:20] now I believe this is the first place
[27:23] where it has been identified fire came
[27:27] coming to the altar so the first altar
[27:30] wasn't lit by man
[27:32] didn't like God's order who God himself
[27:36] lit that old
[27:38] God himself lit that fire
[27:41] and you remember that when Elijah
[27:45] challenged the people if God we got
[27:47] Susan and let the golden answer by fire
[27:51] let him be God
[27:53] and this is how Elijah did the first
[27:56] thing he did He restored the altar he
[28:00] brought the altar lady wood
[28:03] and then say pour water pour more water
[28:06] and pour more water the people carry on
[28:08] looking for manifestations and they
[28:10] carry on carrying nothing happening and
[28:13] the first thing he did was to bring this
[28:16] reconciliation to God by presenting an
[28:19] altar a altar where the sacrifices mean
[28:23] and where prayer is made note
[28:28] Aaron was told to offer a sin offering
[28:31] for himself and for the people
[28:34] is not as if the priest is above this or
[28:37] the Apostle ministers above that the
[28:40] thing about it is that we all need
[28:43] the blood of Jesus
[28:45] we all have fallen short and come short
[28:48] of his glory and the only way back is
[28:51] through the blood
[28:52] not our works so much but truly
[28:56] accepting the blood amen the blood I was
[28:59] shed at Calvary I made myself flat but
[29:03] this is not the nominational
[29:05] we want to go to continue just two
[29:07] verses of chapter 10 of Leviticus
[29:10] this is important
[29:11] another
[29:13] and abihu the sons of Iran this is
[29:16] Iran's own Sons no I guess they must be
[29:20] taking for granted you know some people
[29:23] always say it um
[29:25] entitled do you think this is for
[29:27] granted this is Aaron's sons they took
[29:31] eight of them his sensor
[29:33] and put fire therein and put incense
[29:36] thereon and authored Strange Fire
[29:40] before the Lord which he commanded them
[29:43] not
[29:45] so here it is these priests Sons decide
[29:49] to bring their sensor
[29:51] polite they won't fire
[29:53] add their own incense of their own ideas
[29:55] and smoke up a kind of ceremonial thing
[30:00] off up and God call that Strange Fire
[30:02] yeah what happened verse two and they
[30:05] went out fire from the Lord
[30:07] and devour them
[30:09] and they died
[30:11] before the Lord
[30:13] that is as a result of offering Strange
[30:17] Fire
[30:18] brother Brian or message conferences
[30:22] when we get to a place
[30:25] till we think we are the only one that
[30:27] God can use we better call a conference
[30:31] God sent Jesus his son to die for every
[30:35] member of the body of Christ
[30:37] Methodist Baptist Presbyterian Lutheran
[30:42] catholic whatever they may be they are
[30:44] all gods children of promise
[30:46] how are they going to get a message
[30:48] if we cool off
[30:51] that what are we going to do
[30:53] then we are putting a bad example before
[30:56] them there's no time for cooling off so
[30:59] all of you all here tonight who want to
[31:02] chill
[31:03] who taking it easy only cool listen to
[31:06] this word
[31:07] no time for cooling off
[31:10] it is time for warming up we can't have
[31:13] a woman until we have a conference an
[31:16] old-time Revival that brings back the
[31:20] Revival fires that will attract
[31:23] attention when Sinners are born into the
[31:25] kingdom of God when a man begin to see
[31:28] ill-filled women and ill-themed men and
[31:30] children repenting and changing their
[31:32] life going forward making restitution
[31:34] weeping bringing precious sheep the
[31:38] church needs a good case of old-time
[31:40] Godly love
[31:42] bloody love
[31:43] we need
[31:45] a contracts hula conference
[31:49] then he speak on the sense what we need
[31:51] is a conference
[31:54] a universal parameter for the Church of
[31:57] the Living God to be called together
[32:00] don't think I'm hungry or beside myself
[32:02] I know what I speak of the need of the
[32:06] church tonight is a conference a prayer
[32:09] meeting a get-together a call together
[32:11] ministers break down their middle wall
[32:14] of partition Jewish members that will
[32:16] forget the differences between the
[32:18] international churches
[32:21] church members and ministers who alter
[32:23] the bones of the altar yeah he's
[32:25] describing with one Accord and pre
[32:29] until the fire of God begins to fall
[32:33] again this is not Minister explain no
[32:36] mystery or unfold Revelation Third pull
[32:39] open up the word this is not that
[32:42] this is holding on to the horns of the
[32:44] altar with one Accord and pray until the
[32:48] fire of God begins to fall again
[32:52] and watch God knows the stubbornness
[32:55] the indifference of men is broke up and
[32:59] godly fear and broadly love
[33:03] takes its place in the human heart then
[33:06] you become salty then the message will
[33:08] have the preeminances in the heart it
[33:11] will have the inference in the city
[33:14] oh praise God
[33:16] so we find out Gardner Eden
[33:19] Adam and Eve
[33:21] the fall
[33:23] two sons
[33:25] ible
[33:26] and then God
[33:28] bring them to the place where he could
[33:30] say come and worship me bring a
[33:32] sacrifice
[33:33] this is in Genesis
[33:36] this isn't Genesis where these two
[33:38] brothers
[33:39] they were challenged to come and bring
[33:42] an offering unto God and we knew the
[33:44] story we know the story Abel offer under
[33:46] God are more excellent sacrifice
[33:49] he took a ram a lamb and cut it through
[33:52] bloody bleeding and God rejoiced God
[33:55] backed up God released the anointing the
[33:57] fire upon either King brought his own
[34:00] interpretation of fruits and trees and
[34:02] whatever God rejected it
[34:04] and even God said do like a brother I
[34:06] bless you he was so proud in Ireland
[34:08] he wasn't going that route listen to
[34:11] what the prophet said
[34:12] now watch
[34:14] he drove old man
[34:16] and placed at the East of Eden cherubims
[34:21] and a fleeing sword
[34:23] tune every week see the four beats
[34:26] there's only four ways you can go east
[34:29] north west south these cherubims are the
[34:33] Flaming sword at the Gate of the garden
[34:36] cause if a man got a hold of the tree of
[34:38] life then he could live forever
[34:40] then these children Swiss mentioned was
[34:43] placed at the East Gate of the garden
[34:44] going four ways
[34:47] cherubims was pleased to God what the
[34:49] Tree of Life
[34:50] that's what they was to God the tree of
[34:53] life but what
[34:54] what's here now
[34:56] you notice that these cherubimes that
[34:59] John saw must have been interested in
[35:01] keeping the tree of life so you got the
[35:03] Germans in Genesis you get a chair rooms
[35:06] in Revelation
[35:07] isn't that right so they must have been
[35:09] interested in human beings
[35:11] watch no I want to show you now and make
[35:16] this show it's an altar look how the
[35:19] prophet bringing us now this must have
[35:22] been an altar
[35:24] at the Garden of Eden I'll tell you why
[35:28] do you remember about King and ibra come
[35:30] up here to worship
[35:31] so that goes that shows
[35:34] that God's altar was moved and set here
[35:38] at the Garden of Eden
[35:41] and the only way back to Eden is by the
[35:44] altar
[35:45] here you are again see
[35:46] Back to Eden to the altar and they were
[35:51] to keep that wheat and got it and they
[35:53] couldn't get back there until the order
[35:56] was covered with blood
[35:58] so this Blood Covenant that's why Christ
[36:01] died and shared his blood because life
[36:03] is in his blood this Blood Covenant that
[36:06] was repeated in Shadows and types in the
[36:09] Old Testament over and over bulls and
[36:12] goats and lands and Rams and everything
[36:13] else it meant that was what God was
[36:17] looking through
[36:18] a covering a blood because his
[36:21] righteousness and his Justice demands
[36:23] judgment
[36:24] so therefore they had to have a sin or
[36:26] friend they had to have a peaceful
[36:28] friend that I'm offering for this
[36:29] offering for that to appease this God
[36:33] is not something
[36:35] I'm almost done
[36:36] all right
[36:38] strange scripture we're about to read of
[36:39] Genesis 14 reading from verse 12.
[36:43] there's a lot you know a lot of pictures
[36:45] tend to watch Sodom and up in Southern
[36:47] and then Lord got in captive in
[36:50] captivity they took Lord captive and
[36:52] they took a lot this was 12 or 14
[36:54] Abraham's brother's son who dwelt in
[36:57] Sodom and his Goods only packed
[37:00] and there he wanted escaped and told
[37:02] Abraham the Hebrew or he dwelt in the
[37:04] plains of memory the Amorite Brothers
[37:08] Abner and these were Confederate with
[37:11] Abram
[37:12] I went Abram heard yeah it is that his
[37:16] brother his box isn't brother his
[37:18] brother in Sodom his brother who went
[37:20] here but we're going on on the back side
[37:22] there's a believer when Abraham heard
[37:25] that his brother
[37:27] Not museum Church
[37:29] not only seem inspiration
[37:32] his brother was taken captive
[37:36] he armed his trained civils born in his
[37:40] own house
[37:41] 318 and pursued them under that
[37:45] he divided himself against them he and
[37:47] his servants by night and smoked them
[37:49] pursue them to hoba which is on the left
[37:52] hand of Damascus and he brought back all
[37:55] the goods and also brought again his
[37:57] brother lot and his Ghost and the woman
[38:00] and the people
[38:02] and the king of Sarah went out to meet
[38:04] him after with his return from the slope
[38:06] of
[38:08] and the kings that were with him at the
[38:10] valley of Chavez which is the king's
[38:12] name there we go this is glorious as we
[38:14] close edek
[38:17] King of Silence brought forth Bread and
[38:20] Wine and he was the priest of the most
[38:23] high God if he's there Hallelujah
[38:25] tonight and he blessed him blessed he
[38:28] blessed Abraham and said Blessed Be
[38:30] Abram of the most high god possessor of
[38:34] Heaven
[38:35] and blessed be the most high God which
[38:38] had delivered them enemies into thy name
[38:41] and he give him that's Abram know
[38:44] tights of all
[38:48] I want to emphasize that part
[38:50] you give him
[38:52] tights of all
[38:55] now I'm not talking about just tights as
[38:57] money
[38:59] but all that tent of whatever that will
[39:03] belong to you it's not money I want to
[39:05] bring to you
[39:06] I want to bring tonight
[39:08] I want to bring time

[39:50] you are standing on social media and
[39:52] these other destructive things
[39:55] and I want to challenge you tonight
[39:57] to see if you could get to that spot
[40:00] to give God a tent
[40:03] of your time
[40:05] on a daily basis
[40:07] two hours and ordinance
[40:10] you could be driving and praying
[40:12] you could be driving if your work is one
[40:14] hour away and you're worshiping and
[40:16] praying and talking alone or maybe
[40:18] you're listening to scriptures that's
[40:20] one hour gone and driving alone you
[40:22] could be listening in your video
[40:24] airports or whatever whatever
[40:26] two hours and 40 minutes what is the
[40:28] time
[40:29] on a daily basis that we are given to
[40:31] God
[40:32] and this is it here now
[40:35] what we need
[40:37] is a coming together
[40:39] on a Prayer meeting
[40:41] until
[40:43] God sends the adoption of the Holy
[40:46] Spirit
[40:47] brings the Holy Ghost down and places in

[41:09] you
[41:10] his eyes were gone
[41:12] his strength was born
[41:14] this Fellowship was born
[41:16] but there was a possibility here we go
[41:19] that a friend meeting might spark it
[41:22] again
[41:23] then he prayed right
[41:24] let me die with the Enemy you must die
[41:27] with your enemy
[41:28] you must die to the enemy that's got you
[41:31] in that condition
[41:32] was willing to pay the price to get the
[41:35] power of God back on him again
[41:36] he's seen what he already is up to do
[41:39] not to be a human
[41:41] but to be a servant to have himself

[1:36:42] the name of the Lord hallelujah
[1:36:44] hallelujah before you leave
[1:36:47] I want to share one scripture with you
[1:36:49] and that is from
[1:36:52] Matthew Mark chapter six
[1:36:56] verse 20 verse 31 it says Jesus speaking
[1:37:00] and he said unto them
[1:37:02] call me yourselves apart onto a desert
[1:37:04] please and rest a while
[1:37:07] for there were many coming and going
[1:37:09] and they had no leisure so much
[1:37:12] has to eat
[1:37:14] you know
[1:37:16] I want to share with you as about to
[1:37:18] leave
[1:37:19] there's a balance in this life
[1:37:22] we are in this world but not of this
[1:37:25] world
[1:37:26] Jesus saw the Ninja
[1:37:29] to tell the disciples come aside and
[1:37:32] take a rest
[1:37:34] you need a restory charge
[1:37:36] you need a rest I'm not just talking
[1:37:39] about rest
[1:37:40] lying down or just like that talking
[1:37:42] about you taking care of you
[1:37:44] you giving yourself some level of
[1:37:46] self-care and not overextending yourself
[1:37:49] to the point where you are burnt out
[1:37:52] because when you are burnt out you can't
[1:37:55] pray effectively you can praise
[1:37:57] correctly so don't go on an extreme or
[1:38:01] in fanaticism
[1:38:02] like a praying and then she can be Lord
[1:38:04] and I kind of a weed
[1:38:06] but get the balance that Jesus
[1:38:09] demonstrated here by telling disciples
[1:38:12] come
[1:38:13] and the Bible says they went aside let
[1:38:16] me just see yourself they went inside to
[1:38:19] a place let me just read the last it's
[1:38:21] right after that and they departed into
[1:38:23] a desert place
[1:38:25] by ship privately the Amplified says and
[1:38:29] they went away in a boat to a solitary
[1:38:31] place
[1:38:32] by themselves sometimes you need us
[1:38:35] peace by yourself
[1:38:37] you need to tell people no
[1:38:39] you need to say I can't do that
[1:38:42] and
[1:38:44] I have I am I have to take care of me
[1:38:48] you need to do that sometimes
[1:38:50] I sometimes may look like if you're
[1:38:52] selfish it is not
[1:38:53] it is you taking care of you
[1:38:55] you go if you get over if you're over
[1:38:57] area over burnt your your burnt out you
[1:39:02] cannot be effective to others
[1:39:05] you have to get that energy you have to
[1:39:08] get back that strength that's peace a
[1:39:11] way your body get revenge because all
[1:39:13] the universe and this world is going by
[1:39:16] laws and principles I saw two is our
[1:39:18] buddies
[1:39:19] so Jesus couldn't support them just
[1:39:22] continuing they're not eating and
[1:39:24] they're not doing this and I'm just busy
[1:39:25] about he had us to bring this balance to
[1:39:28] them come aside and take a breath so may
[1:39:31] God bless you
[1:39:33] and may God bless this I'm coming
[1:39:34] Services if you haven't this coming
[1:39:36] Sunday

[1:39:39] somebody else may the Lord bless you
