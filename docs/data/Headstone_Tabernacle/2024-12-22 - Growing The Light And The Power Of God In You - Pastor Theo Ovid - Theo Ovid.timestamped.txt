[53:44] Jesus name I ask it amen God bless you
[53:46] and welcome this morning and if you have
[53:48] your Bibles I like you to turn to
[53:52] Matthew chapter 5:1
[53:54] 14-6 Luke 11
[53:57] verse
[53:58] 33-36 and 1 John 1
[54:03] 5-10 reading from Matthew
[54:06] 5 verse
[54:08] 14 and 15 Jesus speaks ye are the light
[54:13] of the world a city that is set on a
[54:15] hill cannot be hid neither do men light
[54:19] a candle and put it under a Bushell but
[54:23] on a
[54:24] Candlestick and give it light unto all
[54:28] that are in the house Luke
[54:31] 11 and it reads from verse
[54:40] 33 no man when he lighted a candle puted
[54:45] it in a secret place neither under a
[54:48] Bushell but under a Candlestick that
[54:51] they which come in may see the
[54:53] light the light of the body is the
[54:57] eye therefore when thine eye is single
[55:02] thy whole body also is full of light and
[55:06] when thy eye is evil thy body also is
[55:09] full of
[55:11] Darkness take heed therefore that the
[55:15] light which is in thee be not Darkness
[55:18] If thy whole body therefore be full of
[55:20] light having no part dark the whole
[55:24] shall be full of light as when a bright
[55:28] shining of a candle do give thee light
[55:31] and our last scripture is from 1 John
[55:33] chapter
[55:34] 1 want to read from verse five this then
[55:38] is the message which we have heard of
[55:40] him and declare unto you that God is
[55:45] light and in him is no Darkness at all
[55:50] if we see that we have fellowship with
[55:53] him and walk in darkness we lie and do
[55:58] not the truth but if we walk in the
[56:01] light as he is in the light we have
[56:04] Fellowship one with another and the
[56:07] blood of Jesus Christ his son cleanses
[56:10] us from all sin if we say that we have
[56:14] no sin we deceive ourselves and the
[56:17] truth is not in us but if we confess our
[56:21] sins he is faithful and just to forgive
[56:24] us of our sins and to cleanse us from
[56:28] all unrighteousness now if we say that
[56:31] we have not sinned we make him a liar
[56:34] and his word is not in us let us pray
[56:37] father we thank you for your word and
[56:38] your truth and Lord one time you said
[56:40] you shall know the truth and the truth
[56:42] shall set you free set us free today by
[56:46] your the truth of your word in Jesus
[56:48] name I ask it amen and amen you be
[56:50] seated praise God and as just be seated
[56:53] just give God some
[56:54] praises and give God got some
[56:58] worship before we sort of start today I
[57:02] want to time to Wednesday night service
[57:03] and if you haven't listened it you
[57:04] should listen to it very important
[57:06] service after the service I saw a glow
[57:08] the sabu's face and I really wanted to
[57:11] ask him what is happening with him and
[57:13] this morning he still have that glow on
[57:15] his face and he's telling me he said
[57:17] brother ID he said I never saw it he
[57:20] said Wednesday something struck him you
[57:22] you see that I saw something on him and
[57:25] he is telling me this morning he never
[57:27] thought like that so I'm so happy to
[57:29] hear his testimony praise the
[57:32] Lord
[57:33] amen so I I the Lord give me some stuff
[57:37] that I to share on Wednesday and I
[57:39] believe uh that's why I'm here this
[57:41] morning actually but Anthony was
[57:43] supposed to speak this morning but I
[57:44] have something here to continue we speak
[57:46] next week all right so I have a title
[57:49] grow the light and the power of God in
[57:53] you that's the title grow the light and
[57:57] the power of God in you say what is that
[58:00] about well we going get into it don't
[58:02] worry have an inspiration be a light to
[58:06] the
[58:07] world be a light to the world so on
[58:10] Wednesday night just to
[58:12] recap why should God give you more than
[58:15] you can manage and we know unto one he
[58:18] give five talents another two to another
[58:21] one that every man according to his
[58:24] several ability
[58:26] the man took his journey came back to
[58:29] ask for an
[58:30] account the gift is there the talent is
[58:34] there but is what you do with it and
[58:38] before God places you in a position of
[58:40] power and strength the position you know
[58:42] who is
[58:43] temporary until God see what you do with
[58:46] what was given to you in the time of
[58:50] probation am I place it that way that he
[58:52] give you am so it's not the amount one
[58:55] Talent two talents because the man with
[58:58] the one Talent say he's
[59:00] lazy he take the easy part and just bury
[59:02] it and say give me that look at look it
[59:04] back after 20 years they give him back
[59:06] the same thing God give you and God
[59:09] reject that and God called that man a
[59:11] wicked man so when you hear me talking
[59:13] about Wicked Woman and wicked men and
[59:15] wicked I am taking the eyes of God to
[59:17] say that I'm not I'm not just saying
[59:21] people making a mistake no wicked men
[59:24] Wicked servant
[59:26] Wicked man that was gifted by God and
[59:29] buried it gifted by God and did nothing
[59:33] about it gifted by God and didn't add to
[59:35] it because God is in the addition
[59:38] business multiplication business Satan
[59:41] is in the division business and the
[59:42] subtraction business we give the Lord
[59:44] some
[59:46] Praises let me say it again God is in
[59:49] the addition business multiplication and
[59:51] blessing I Will Bless thee and
[59:53] multiplying I will multiply thee Satan
[59:55] is the in a dividing business and he
[59:57] subtracting business he want to steal to
[1:00:00] rub and to destroy he want to take away
[1:00:02] from you God want to add to you that's
[1:00:05] why people said add to your faith virtue
[1:00:06] and knowledge and Temperance and
[1:00:08] patience and godliness God want you to
[1:00:10] add oh give the Lord a shout in the
[1:00:12] house the devil want you to contract but
[1:00:14] God want you to add all right the gift
[1:00:18] is there the talent is there is what you
[1:00:20] do with it to give a talent gives you a
[1:00:22] temporary position that is connected to
[1:00:24] a time element want to quickly call this
[1:00:27] time a time of
[1:00:29] probation there's a brother who left
[1:00:31] this church because he didn't agree with
[1:00:32] me that the fivefold there's a fold
[1:00:34] ministri is yet he says here now and I
[1:00:36] said no and he W out you know what we do
[1:00:39] here when you come we say welcome and
[1:00:40] you leave you we say bye-bye no hard
[1:00:42] feelings we still treat your right still
[1:00:44] love you the same the point about it is
[1:00:46] this that God cannot trust men with
[1:00:49] power if they do have character it
[1:00:51] doesn't even make sense if you cannot
[1:00:54] handle $100 why should go give you ,000
[1:00:57] if you cannot manage $1,000 why should
[1:00:59] God give you $ 10,000 that's
[1:01:00] embarrassing you're blowing through
[1:01:02] whatever you have because you cannot
[1:01:04] manage so this Talent issue here five
[1:01:07] Talent two Talent is about management
[1:01:10] it's about taking and coming to the
[1:01:12] accountability with what God give you
[1:01:14] amen hallelujah so five produce five
[1:01:17] well praise God two produce two and he
[1:01:19] said well done not well talked well done
[1:01:23] they did something about what was given
[1:01:25] to them
[1:01:26] Hallelujah we have to do something if
[1:01:30] you don't do you have no well done oh
[1:01:32] give the Lord a shout hallelujah if you
[1:01:35] don't do there is no word about well
[1:01:37] done enter into the joy because you have
[1:01:40] been faithful and little you'll be
[1:01:42] faithful in much so I will give you more
[1:01:44] responsibility to take your further Give
[1:01:46] the Lord some Praises hallelujah
[1:01:49] hallelujah hallelujah if you want a
[1:01:52] promotion be committed to the little
[1:01:54] that God give you to see how you going
[1:01:56] to manage it oh give the Lord some
[1:01:58] Praises probation is to see what you
[1:02:00] will do not to see the excuses you will
[1:02:03] make it's not my fault some people
[1:02:04] always have excuses always looking to
[1:02:06] blame somebody that's not my job this
[1:02:09] there a problem for somebody else to fix
[1:02:11] your testimony God give it to you God
[1:02:13] reveal it to you God bless you God was
[1:02:16] with you 20 years ago God heal you that
[1:02:18] is not the
[1:02:20] issue you know you have a gift you know
[1:02:23] some God but the gift is not the issue
[1:02:26] you you know without a doubt God has
[1:02:28] forgiven you but what have you done with
[1:02:30] the forgiveness and I read the scripture
[1:02:31] where the man was was forgiven for
[1:02:34] 10,000
[1:02:35] talents the king forgive for 10,000
[1:02:37] talents and when he get free by the king
[1:02:40] from prison he lock a man neck for 100 p
[1:02:45] hold the man throat and let the man go
[1:02:47] into prison for 100
[1:02:49] P that come like somebody you get
[1:02:52] forgiven for $10,000 and locking
[1:02:54] somebody neck for $10
[1:02:57] make them go to PR when he can hear that
[1:03:00] and and Jesus talk about what will
[1:03:01] happen to people would not how handle
[1:03:03] forgiveness so God bless you sometime
[1:03:05] people po they struggling God bless them
[1:03:07] afterwards they head in the air rainfall
[1:03:08] they drunk CU their nose quite up in the
[1:03:12] air instead of getting more humble they
[1:03:15] get more proud is getting more humble
[1:03:17] because that's what God looking for
[1:03:18] looking for somebody the more humble the
[1:03:20] more He blesses the more humble he
[1:03:22] becomes not the more proud he becomes
[1:03:25] because human being get in trouble
[1:03:26] because of their achievement we read
[1:03:28] that man achieve and then he get proud
[1:03:31] man achieve so much they want to make a
[1:03:33] tower to God they want to pray they want
[1:03:34] to talk to God you know he said I go
[1:03:35] build a tower everybody talking the same
[1:03:37] language God say that trouble yes they
[1:03:39] coming for me they're coming up for
[1:03:41] heaven and God confused them and that
[1:03:43] will Babylon come Hallelujah God
[1:03:46] confused them by giving them different
[1:03:47] tongues isn't that right because man
[1:03:50] want to go up to heaven and sing live
[1:03:52] like a devil on Earth and go in heaven
[1:03:53] and sing with angels want to work both
[1:03:57] ways Bible talk about let nothing be
[1:03:59] done through Strife of in glory so
[1:04:02] manage how you see
[1:04:05] yourself when you overvalue yourself
[1:04:07] you're head into trouble so what
[1:04:10] Christianity does is to help us change
[1:04:13] our way of
[1:04:14] thinking we born a certain way grow up
[1:04:17] in a certain environment we accustomed
[1:04:18] with certain things and so on like that
[1:04:20] but when we come to the word the word
[1:04:22] addresses us addresses our issues that
[1:04:26] we could know how to behave ourselves
[1:04:28] and as long as we willing to subject
[1:04:30] ourselves to the of to the word things
[1:04:32] will work out for us that that is what
[1:04:34] God does he he brings his word to his
[1:04:37] people isn't that right so the Bible
[1:04:39] said do nothing from factional motives
[1:04:40] through contention Strife selfishness or
[1:04:43] unworthy ends or prompted by conceit or
[1:04:46] empty arrogance instead in the true
[1:04:48] Spirit of humility loneliness of Mind
[1:04:51] Let each regard the others better than
[1:04:53] and Superior to himself what if
[1:04:55] everybody do that you respect this
[1:04:58] sister not because she tall or whatever
[1:05:00] it is you respect this brother and you
[1:05:01] see them better than yourselves when you
[1:05:03] see that you could learn from them you
[1:05:05] could be blessed by them you cannot say
[1:05:07] well I more spiritual I older I long
[1:05:10] don't have nothing to do with it you
[1:05:11] know a lot of people like to rock back
[1:05:13] on history and that's why I blast
[1:05:14] history history is Boo history is
[1:05:17] nothing history is nothing relevant to
[1:05:20] what happening right now because that
[1:05:22] was the issue with the Scribe and
[1:05:23] Pharisees Jesus was a present child of
[1:05:26] the hour and when he start to preach to
[1:05:28] them you know what they say our fathers
[1:05:30] eat man in the
[1:05:33] wilderness they were talking about the
[1:05:35] lineage they was talking about the
[1:05:36] history they was talking about the
[1:05:37] people of God and Jesus said everyone
[1:05:40] dead so don't talk your history talk
[1:05:42] when all of them dead I am the living
[1:05:45] bread that come from Heaven that if a
[1:05:47] man eat of me he shall not die okay the
[1:05:49] Lord I shout in other words your history
[1:05:52] you could talk all your history all you
[1:05:54] want is it don't be in contact with the
[1:05:56] living bread you are dead as just them
[1:05:59] oh give the Lord some
[1:06:03] Praises because you are faithful well
[1:06:05] done not you preach well you are
[1:06:08] faithful in the temporary position I put
[1:06:10] you in what with what you have I will
[1:06:14] see what you will produce according to
[1:06:17] your several abilities because you can
[1:06:20] manage well and be faithful to the
[1:06:21] little I give you I will promote you
[1:06:24] over bigger things or many things and
[1:06:27] that confirms the scripture prom
[1:06:30] promotion doesn't come from man
[1:06:33] promotion comes from the the Lord and
[1:06:36] when God promote you nobody could demote
[1:06:38] you they could jealous you they could
[1:06:41] Envy you but they can't take your place
[1:06:44] because God put you there oh give the
[1:06:47] Lord some Praises
[1:06:50] Hallelujah so he said what we need is a
[1:06:53] man that is tight to the word and to
[1:06:54] Christ to bring their congregation under
[1:06:58] that condition to where each member
[1:07:00] walks in the condition of the word this
[1:07:02] is what my responsibility is I can't
[1:07:04] change you you have to want to change
[1:07:06] and God and the word and the Holy Ghost
[1:07:07] could change you but you don't expect me
[1:07:10] to sit here and let you walk in and walk
[1:07:12] out just the way you want to walk in and
[1:07:13] walk out this is not your mother's house
[1:07:16] this is not your father's house this is
[1:07:18] not your family house this is the house
[1:07:20] of God that's why Jus beat a strap and
[1:07:22] beat them out and say my father's house
[1:07:24] shall be called a House of Prayer
[1:07:26] he let them know this is not their house
[1:07:28] you could go and sweep your house and do
[1:07:29] whatever you want in your house hang up
[1:07:30] Christmas tree and Christmas this and
[1:07:32] and change curtain and whatnot that is
[1:07:33] your house but this house have to get
[1:07:35] the
[1:07:36] word so each person is to be brought in
[1:07:40] the condition of the word of God in
[1:07:42] other words you're not coming here for
[1:07:43] religious activity then that's what
[1:07:45] Catholics do and other people do they go
[1:07:46] to church as a religious activity all
[1:07:49] different religion as an activity you're
[1:07:51] not coming to church as an activity
[1:07:53] you're coming to church to have a
[1:07:54] life-changing
[1:07:57] experience so God want to fill you why
[1:08:01] does he want to fill you what does he
[1:08:03] want to fill you with he wants to fill
[1:08:06] you with
[1:08:07] himself the holy spirit filled with Holy
[1:08:10] Ghost I still haven't got to where so
[1:08:12] there just the backrop right okay so I
[1:08:15] want to look at Saul a little bit you
[1:08:18] ain't get any message yet we have no
[1:08:20] Wednesday night service
[1:08:22] so make a combine
[1:08:27] not everybody say Amen on
[1:08:29] that people want to go and do this stuff
[1:08:32] all right okay 1 Samuel
[1:08:35] 10:1 then Samuel took a vow of
[1:08:38] oil and pour it upon his head this H his
[1:08:41] soul and kissed him and said it is not
[1:08:45] because the Lord had anointed thee is it
[1:08:48] not the the Lord had Anointed The to be
[1:08:50] Captain over the serans so Saul was
[1:08:53] anointed first Samuel 10:
[1:08:56] 5 Samuel speaking to Saul after Thou
[1:09:00] shalt come to the hill of God where is
[1:09:03] the Garrison of the Philistines and it
[1:09:05] shall come to pass when thou come t to
[1:09:08] the city thou shallal meet a company of
[1:09:11] prophets coming down from the high place
[1:09:12] with Sultry and Tabet and pipe and half
[1:09:15] before them and they shall
[1:09:17] prophesy and the spirit of the Lord will
[1:09:19] come upon thee and thou shalt prophesy
[1:09:22] with them and shall be turned into
[1:09:25] another
[1:09:27] man and let it be when these signs are
[1:09:31] Comm unto thee that thou do as occasion
[1:09:35] serve thee for God is with thee what a
[1:09:38] powerful
[1:09:39] testimony this sa guy Anointed with oil
[1:09:43] kissed by the prophet prophesy with the
[1:09:47] rest of prophets spirit of God come upon
[1:09:49] him and Samuel told him you will know
[1:09:53] God is with thee
[1:09:56] amen first
[1:09:58] 10 1st Samuel 11 verse 14 and 15 then
[1:10:03] Samuel said to the people come let us go
[1:10:06] to gigal and renew the kingdom there and
[1:10:09] all the people went to gigal and there
[1:10:12] they made Saul King before the Lord in
[1:10:14] gigal and there they sacrifice
[1:10:17] sacrifices of Peace offerings before the
[1:10:19] Lord and there Saul and all the men of
[1:10:21] Israel Rejoice greatly then we switch to
[1:10:23] 1st Samuel chapter 13
[1:10:26] reading from verse 5 and the Philistines
[1:10:28] gathered themselves together to fight
[1:10:30] with Israel 30,000 chariots 6,000
[1:10:34] Horsemen people as the sand which is on
[1:10:37] the seashore in multitude and they came
[1:10:40] up and pitching mismatch Eastward from
[1:10:43] bethen when the children of Israel saw
[1:10:46] that they were in a strait for the
[1:10:48] people were distressed then the people
[1:10:50] hid themselves in caves this is God's
[1:10:52] people and tickets in rocks high places
[1:10:54] and
[1:10:56] and some of the Hebrews went over Jordan
[1:10:57] to the land of GAD and Gilead as for
[1:11:00] Saul he was yet in gilgal and all the
[1:11:03] people followed him
[1:11:06] trembling and he tarried seven days here
[1:11:10] we go according to the set time that
[1:11:15] Samuel had appointed so Samuel told him
[1:11:18] wait seven days but Samuel came not to
[1:11:21] gigal and the people were scattered from
[1:11:24] him
[1:11:25] and Saul look at verse 9 said bring
[1:11:28] hither a burnt offering to me and peace
[1:11:31] offering and he offered the burnt
[1:11:34] offering and it came to pass here we go
[1:11:37] that as soon as he had made an end of
[1:11:40] the offering the burnt offering behold
[1:11:42] Samuel came and Saul went out to meet
[1:11:45] him that he might salute him and Samuel
[1:11:48] said he's a prophet talking him what
[1:11:51] hast thou
[1:11:52] done and Saul said listen the excuse
[1:11:56] and Saul said because I saw the people
[1:11:59] were scattered from me and that thou
[1:12:03] came as not within the days appointed
[1:12:06] and that the Philistine gathered
[1:12:07] themselves together at mishmash
[1:12:09] therefore said
[1:12:12] I the Philistines will come down upon me
[1:12:15] to gigal I have not made supplication
[1:12:18] unto the Lord I forced myself therefore
[1:12:22] and offered a burnt
[1:12:23] offering now s was to offer the burnt
[1:12:26] offering not
[1:12:28] Saul Saul said the people Saul said this
[1:12:32] that that that that that that and
[1:12:35] I forc
[1:12:38] myself and Samuel said to Saul verse 13
[1:12:42] that was done
[1:12:46] foolishly so sometime anointed people
[1:12:48] could
[1:12:50] act sometime call people could
[1:12:53] act sometime place people could
[1:12:58] act
[1:13:04] foolishly there are people who don't
[1:13:06] even want to admit they acting
[1:13:10] foolishly thou has not kept the
[1:13:12] Commandment of the Lord thy God which he
[1:13:14] commanded thee for now would the Lord
[1:13:18] have establish thy kingdom upon Israel
[1:13:22] forever but now verse 14
[1:13:25] thy kingdom shall not continue the Lord
[1:13:29] had sought him a man after his own heart
[1:13:33] and the Lord had commanded him to be
[1:13:36] Captain over his people because thou has
[1:13:39] not kept that which the Lord commanded
[1:13:42] Thee I just read for you in chapter 10
[1:13:46] this man kissed this man anointed this
[1:13:50] man prophesied and just right after that
[1:13:55] in 13 that's two
[1:13:58] chapters that man is
[1:14:04] rejected but a punch help him to preach
[1:14:06] this morning he do his own thing that's
[1:14:09] what he do that people do doing their
[1:14:10] own thing not what God said that's why
[1:14:14] you should be concerned of what God said
[1:14:18] you have to love what God love and hate
[1:14:21] what God hate you want what God Said not
[1:14:24] what your feel not what you think not
[1:14:27] what you dream what whatever what
[1:14:29] somebody say is what God have
[1:14:38] said oh it's song nice I have not made
[1:14:41] supplication in the Lord so he a want to
[1:14:43] go up and fight everybody trembling
[1:14:44] behind him so he said I I I pray yet I a
[1:14:47] make no offering to God to protect us
[1:14:49] and look but you have to wait on
[1:14:52] instructions you can't use your emotions
[1:14:55] amen hallelujah so God told him it shall
[1:14:58] I continue 1 Samuel
[1:15:00] 15 reading from verse
[1:15:02] 9 Saul and the people speared AAG and
[1:15:07] God tell them kill everything don't take
[1:15:09] no sheep no goat no nothing no
[1:15:12] chicken no pork no Pig nothing my pig
[1:15:15] and pork in them with things in other
[1:15:18] words don't touch nothing they have kill
[1:15:20] this out but they spare the king king a
[1:15:24] and the best of the Sheep and of the ox
[1:15:25] and of the fatl you see where your I
[1:15:27] seeing best you see God said kill
[1:15:29] everything but your I seeing I never had
[1:15:32] a sheep so fat look at a well-placed
[1:15:34] oxen boy woo
[1:15:37] that have a feast for
[1:15:41] Christmas Saul and the people spare AAG
[1:15:44] the best of the sheep and The Oxen and
[1:15:46] the fatlings and the Lambs and all that
[1:15:48] was good that would not UT but would not
[1:15:50] utterly destroy them and everything that
[1:15:52] was vile and refused that they d destroy
[1:15:55] utterly so what was hateful and what not
[1:15:57] they lick that up then came the word of
[1:16:00] the Lord unto Samuel saying it repented
[1:16:03] me that I have set up Sal to be
[1:16:08] king for he is turned back from
[1:16:10] following
[1:16:11] me this man on the throne this man over
[1:16:15] charge of God's people and God repenting
[1:16:18] that he put him there I want to show you
[1:16:21] something you know is what you are given
[1:16:23] and what you do with it
[1:16:28] the history becomes
[1:16:29] irrelevant when God word is present
[1:16:32] tense for you to act on and for you to
[1:16:35] do Jesus told those Pharisees he said
[1:16:38] you say you in the light now that I come
[1:16:40] you're now in darkness because I am the
[1:16:42] light oh give the Lord some
[1:16:45] Praises before Christ come they have
[1:16:47] scriptures they have Scrolls they have
[1:16:50] books they have tapes they have the word
[1:16:52] but when the word become to me made
[1:16:54] manifest that is light as the word
[1:16:57] become manifest Hallelujah so he said
[1:17:00] watch it repented me I have set up Saul
[1:17:03] to be king for he turned back from
[1:17:05] following me had not performed my
[1:17:07] Commandments and it grieved Samuel and
[1:17:10] he cried unto the Lord all night and
[1:17:12] when Samuel rose up early to meet Saul
[1:17:14] in the morning it was told Samuel saying
[1:17:16] Saul came to carel and behold he set up
[1:17:19] a place and he going about passed on
[1:17:21] going down to gigle Samuel came to Saul
[1:17:23] and sa and said blessed be thou of the
[1:17:25] Lord I have performed the Commandments
[1:17:27] of the Lord I saw m talking
[1:17:31] there and Samuel said what mean this the
[1:17:34] bleeding of sheep in my ears he talking
[1:17:37] the Commandment but
[1:17:42] he if he had a chance he could have
[1:17:44] looked it up and make sure he's
[1:17:45] soundproof you know while he talking
[1:17:50] he who sheep is
[1:17:53] that what meanless bleeding of sheep in
[1:17:56] my ear and the loing of oxen which I
[1:17:58] hear and Saul said they have been
[1:18:00] brought them from the amalekites for the
[1:18:02] people SP the best of the sheep and of
[1:18:04] The Oxen to sacrifice them unto the Lord
[1:18:06] thy God and the rest we have utterly
[1:18:09] destroyed why we cut them true but this
[1:18:12] is the
[1:18:13] best then Samuel said unto Saul stay and
[1:18:17] I will tell thee what the Lord had said
[1:18:20] to me this night and he said unto him
[1:18:24] seon
[1:18:26] listen to the phrasing of this listen to
[1:18:29] The Eyes Of
[1:18:31] God as
[1:18:33] God as God
[1:18:35] sees different from how man sees s said
[1:18:39] when thou was little in thy own
[1:18:44] sight that
[1:18:47] means he is no longer seeing himself
[1:18:50] little in his own
[1:18:53] sight he is being in
[1:18:55] himself and he has overvalued
[1:18:58] himself in his own
[1:19:01] eyes so Samuel have to tell Saul when
[1:19:05] thou was little in thine own sight was
[1:19:08] thou not made the head of the tribe of
[1:19:10] Israel and the Lord Anointed The King
[1:19:13] over Israel in other words you start off
[1:19:17] humble you start off simple you start
[1:19:21] off dependent upon God look at your
[1:19:25] now look at your pride now look how
[1:19:29] you're doing you you doing your own
[1:19:31] measurement God say kill all you're
[1:19:33] killing some and keeping rest to offer
[1:19:37] unto the
[1:19:42] Lord when thou was little in thine own
[1:19:45] sight I wonder how much people are
[1:19:47] little in their own sight or they want
[1:19:50] to as we say RAM on somebody else
[1:19:56] or show off for somebody
[1:20:01] else your sister I know she not from
[1:20:04] here because she had more money she was
[1:20:07] a a a a real
[1:20:10] manipulator a real
[1:20:12] controller making this action doing this
[1:20:15] if you ask her to if she want to buy
[1:20:17] something she had to choose the
[1:20:18] color for the church she she had to pick
[1:20:21] it because her money jumping up
[1:20:25] she was on the field running for years
[1:20:28] but somebody told me right now she in a
[1:20:32] pavilion she can't score no goals no
[1:20:34] more she have to sit down now and watch
[1:20:37] who is on the field all the people God
[1:20:41] make them run their run because time
[1:20:45] reveals just a matter of time you know

[1:21:05] have you considered the end give them
[1:21:07] some more time let time run on them but
[1:21:10] blessed is the man who walk not in the
[1:21:12] counsel of the ungodly nor stand in the
[1:21:15] way of Sinners nor sit in the seat of
[1:21:17] the scornful but his Delight is in the
[1:21:20] law of the Lord and in his law that he
[1:21:23] meditate day and night
[1:21:25] he shall be like a tree

[1:47:43] you a rest in peace at
[1:47:47] all leave thy gift at the altar first be
[1:47:50] reconciled to thy brother then come and
[1:47:52] offer thy gift it is not the amount it
[1:47:56] is the sacrifice it's not how big the
[1:47:58] gift is or how small the gift is no it's
[1:48:00] the sacrifice and Jesus give that at
[1:48:02] Mark 12:41 he says here Jesus sat over
[1:48:05] against the treasury and behold how the
[1:48:07] people cast money into the treasury and
[1:48:09] many that were Rich cast in much and
[1:48:12] they came a certain poor Widow to in two
[1:48:15] mites which make a fa and he called onto
[1:48:19] the disciples and said unto them that un
[1:48:20] to you so he's teaching them
[1:48:25] that this poor Widow had cast more in
[1:48:30] than all they which have cast into the
[1:48:33] treasury for all they did cast is in
[1:48:36] their abundance but she of her want did
[1:48:40] cast in all that she had even all her

[1:49:10] but that there may be meet in my house
[1:49:12] and prove me where it here it sayth the
[1:49:15] Lord of hosts if I will not open to you
[1:49:18] the windows of heaven and pour you out a
[1:49:20] blessing that there shall not be room
[1:49:22] enough to receive it and I will rebuke
[1:49:25] for your sake and he shall not destroy
[1:49:28] the fruits of your ground neither shall
[1:49:30] your Vine cast of fruit Before Time in

[1:50:16] God have you ever witnessed that to be
[1:50:18] the truth put God first pay your tithes

[1:50:23] you or give you wealth or power the
[1:50:25] first thing that God want you to
[1:50:27] understand is that that is further to
[1:50:29] promote the kingdom of God and then your
[1:50:32] family you call a man who can't provide
[1:50:33] for family he's wretched do you
[1:50:36] understand that the first thing God want
[1:50:37] you to understand he's blessing you for
[1:50:39] the Kingdom's
[1:50:42] sake so that is why he sees people doing
[1:50:45] that as robbers you know robber is a
[1:50:47] thief
[1:50:53] this then is the message you have heard
[1:50:55] that God is
[1:50:56] light in him there's no Darkness at all
[1:51:00] if we say we are fellowship with him and
[1:51:02] walk in darkness we lie and do not the
[1:51:04] truth so this message is a message of
[1:51:07] light when you walk in the light not
[1:51:10] Luther or westro Pentecostal this end
[1:51:12] time message light when you walk in this
[1:51:14] light they they have no fornicators in
[1:51:17] this light you can't be walking light
[1:51:19] and fornicating you can't be walking in
[1:51:20] light and fooling around no no you can't
[1:51:23] be walking like doing that isn't that
[1:51:25] right backbiting and filthy and so on
[1:51:28] praise God this is where I want to get
[1:51:29] to
[1:51:30] now God Is A different light and yet he
[1:51:35] is light now I think of the picture of
[1:51:37] the great proof that God is light God's
[1:51:40] life here we go operated through the
[1:51:43] cosmic light of our bodies ourselves so
[1:51:46] our bodies itself have something called
[1:51:48] Cosmic light that's why you have x-ray
[1:51:50] because you seen something through you
[1:51:52] but that's not God's light that is
[1:51:54] Cosmic light it's not the same thing but
[1:51:57] Bram he said we were absolutely on one
[1:52:00] time genuine sons of God and that is
[1:52:04] where the fruit of the spirit today's
[1:52:06] love joy Faith longsuffering weekness
[1:52:08] it's got to a spot to where our whole
[1:52:10] body then he said this you know like a
[1:52:12] seaweed you got in the bottom of the sea
[1:52:14] a lot of time divers they get under the
[1:52:15] seaweed before they know it they're
[1:52:17] wrapped in such a way they can't get out
[1:52:18] of it that's the way sin has done the
[1:52:21] human being that's that's the way cess
[1:52:23] has done the church that's the way
[1:52:25] communist done the nation it is so
[1:52:27] treacherous and then in the human body
[1:52:29] is wrapped us and is pushing out this
[1:52:32] light of God by denomination and N of
[1:52:35] faith and I Illustrated it like a button
[1:52:39] here we go this part I want to get to
[1:52:41] there the key part of this
[1:52:42] service when a man is
[1:52:45] saved that much of him is
[1:52:48] God that the little light that comes in
[1:52:53] to make you quit doing what's wrong now
[1:52:56] here we go if you can take all the
[1:52:59] malice and envy and strife and unbelief
[1:53:05] out that little button like of light and
[1:53:09] power of God will keep
[1:53:10] growing and growing so you see where I
[1:53:13] get the title from Light and Power
[1:53:15] growing in you in you because we were
[1:53:19] born in sin shaping iniquity so our
[1:53:23] lives fed With Envy jealousy malice
[1:53:25] rotness and filth and God pick us up put
[1:53:30] a button inside of you Hallelujah that
[1:53:33] button surrounded by Envy jealousy
[1:53:36] malice all kind of stuff and he's saying
[1:53:38] if you kick them things out you'll give
[1:53:40] room for this button to
[1:53:43] expand the more you get rid of stuff or
[1:53:46] give the Lord some Praises you have to
[1:53:50] get rid of
[1:54:00] watch if you can take all the malice
[1:54:02] Envy Strife unbelief out that little
[1:54:04] buttonik of the light and power of God
[1:54:06] will keep growing growing growing
[1:54:08] growing crowding out unbelief now you
[1:54:10] don't do it by bodily exercise you do it
[1:54:14] by a Sanctified consecrated life that
[1:54:17] the holy spirit moves through you that
[1:54:20] is why the biggest issue now with sexual
[1:54:22] sins sins that will make you and all the
[1:54:26] homosexuality and lesbianism and all
[1:54:28] these different things is to make people
[1:54:30] abominable to God because God hates that
[1:54:34] and that will bring judgment upon the
[1:54:36] person do you understand that so that's
[1:54:39] why the devil he will do all in his
[1:54:41] power to catch people and snear people
[1:54:44] in these things that God reject them
[1:54:47] because you see God love he loves and
[1:54:50] that's why you have longsuffering that's
[1:54:52] why he is patient that's why thing going
[1:54:54] on and on like I told you a while ago
[1:54:57] Ukraine and Russia is not David and
[1:54:59] golad it's almost like waiting for a
[1:55:01] time
[1:55:02] period where things will change and
[1:55:05] that's how we have to understand it too
[1:55:08] all the prophecies was leading up to the
[1:55:10] Messiah being born the Messiah is on the
[1:55:13] earth Shepherds going to meet the
[1:55:14] Messiah isn't that right wise men coming

[1:55:20] infancy power in
[1:55:22] infancy power in baby form and the world
[1:55:26] don't know anything about it
[1:55:29] Hallelujah Hallelujah Jesus in his
[1:55:32] position under Joseph a carpenter's son

[1:57:43] want to subject yourself don't want to
[1:57:44] humble yourelf and what not and looking
[1:57:46] for a husband looking to terrorize a man
[1:57:49] some saintly Godly Man
[1:57:53] I just tortured the
[1:57:58] man see what is preaching this morning
[1:58:01] Christmas
[1:58:06] message I need man he you but he's
[1:58:13] Abraham know close to Abraham you know
[1:58:15] we want s you
[1:58:17] a that s in the Bible you know anytime
[1:58:20] you become Abraham you go see a
[1:58:24] brother saying amen
[1:58:26] now they thought I wasn't coming to the
[1:58:28] house you but come to the house
[1:58:32] too brother brandham seeing it again for
[1:58:36] instance when a man gets saved the light
[1:58:40] that comes into him is about like a
[1:58:41] little white button in my shirt when God
[1:58:45] comes into the inner part of a man in
[1:58:47] the inner part of a man a man is made up
[1:58:50] in the system of a tabernacle outer cour
[1:58:52] Place holy Hool of holies now on the
[1:58:55] inside he when you have one gate one
[1:58:57] entrance to go sh the glory where God
[1:59:00] can enter into him and take over any
[1:59:02] control tower that's true
[1:59:04] self-will think about that in other
[1:59:07] words you could will God
[1:59:09] out because you want to run your own
[1:59:11] life but your own self will say well not
[1:59:14] my will but do you see it now Jesus the
[1:59:18] Messiah he said that not my will
[1:59:22] but die will be done even if it's
[1:59:25] hurting to
[1:59:26] you even if it comes into a man's a man
[1:59:33] heart when a man is born of the spirit
[1:59:35] of
[1:59:36] God he can let that Spirit
[1:59:40] grow oh so there's a question on people
[1:59:45] who seems to be
[1:59:46] stagnant why he not
[1:59:48] growing he can let that Spirit grow and
[1:59:51] take out all the roots of bitterness and
[1:59:53] press God's way through him again he can
[1:59:56] come back into the same condition that
[1:59:57] he was in the Garden of
[1:59:58] Eden so it means that when this light
[2:00:01] begin to grow you are heading back to
[2:00:05] Eden you are getting more and more like
[2:00:08] God less and less normal and human
[2:00:11] because you are not normal Oh Glory to
[2:00:14] God hallelujah glory to God
[2:00:17] Amen brother
[2:00:20] brandham God could
[2:00:22] let me
[2:00:26] see God could dwell supremely to do our
[2:00:29] thinking to do what we're walking to do
[2:00:30] what we're talking it's no longer the
[2:00:32] man it's God and the man he said now
[2:00:35] he's got light life eternal life is the
[2:00:37] light of God dwells in you and if he
[2:00:40] would yield to the spirit more he
[2:00:42] becomes unman sin alike that's a
[2:00:45] beautiful word unman sin alike and it
[2:00:48] becomes more Godlike so what I'm saying
[2:00:51] then as we grow in God we supposed to be
[2:00:54] getting closer to God we supposed to
[2:00:56] have more light emanating through us
[2:00:59] when I got home Wednesday night I say
[2:01:01] but a glow on his face and I wanted to
[2:01:04] ask him about it I never saw that before
[2:01:07] and this morning he met me but you I
[2:01:08] never saw that before something struck
[2:01:11] him and it affected him or infected him
[2:01:14] that's a revelation that is some kind of
[2:01:17] inspiration and it has to strike you too
[2:01:20] if it doesn't strike you you in the same
[2:01:22] shape you in the same condition
[2:01:23] something had to strike you you wasn't
[2:01:25] born a perfect housewife you wasn't born
[2:01:27] a perfect mother you wasn't born a
[2:01:29] perfect husband you wasn't born a
[2:01:30] perfect father but you could learn you
[2:01:32] could grow you could acquire
[2:01:39] skills people don't learn to cook well
[2:01:41] automatically people just throw things
[2:01:43] in the food afterwards when it's not go
[2:01:44] to thr piece of
[2:01:46] pepper and pepper cover all these things
[2:01:48] at the wrong
[2:01:50] part but is not
[2:01:53] cooking that
[2:01:55] just that's just covering something I
[2:01:58] when I buy food outside say I just block
[2:02:00] in a hole there's a good food good food
[2:02:02] when my wife cook that is
[2:02:05] food when my wife cook that is good food
[2:02:08] other than that outside they just
[2:02:10] throwing things in a pot and they're
[2:02:11] selling you that's fast food then but
[2:02:13] when my I don't want nobody wife
[2:02:16] in I have the best cook in the country
[2:02:19] if you only taste that food I'm telling
[2:02:20] you
[2:02:22] Hallelujah she could cook and the reason
[2:02:25] she could cook because her mother could
[2:02:26] have cook and the reason mother could
[2:02:28] have cook because the grandmother could

[2:02:47] a perfect meal in know you don't know
[2:02:49] who went in first and who went in last
[2:02:52] food just tastes good but there are some

[2:14:39] world shuts all the light that we are
[2:14:41] supposed to be reflecting swings over it
[2:14:44] thrs Darkness but says
[2:14:48] here God makes complete Christians
[2:14:51] God Don't Make halfway Christians God
[2:14:54] Don't Make halfway preachers but the
[2:14:56] preacher can be
[2:14:57] halfway oh we could have half preachers
[2:15:00] yes that was the prophet said look at
[2:15:03] Saul call felt humble privileged to be
[2:15:07] the king and afterwards bring me the
[2:15:10] sacrifice bring me can you imagine what
[2:15:11] he saying that you know he's he's King
[2:15:13] bring it to me and as soon as you finish
[2:15:16] offer it here come Samuel what going on
[2:15:18] here he said well um yes people you know
[2:15:22] I mean I I offer it up and thing he say

[2:16:02] in order and God will bless you
[2:16:05] Hallelujah but preachers can be AF free
[2:16:07] God make his children Christians but
[2:16:08] sometimes they are half Christians it's
[2:16:10] not God's intention for them to be that
[2:16:12] way what is the problem here let the
[2:16:15] answer here it's their own ways got
[2:16:18] mixed up with the plan of God for their
[2:16:20] life the reason some people don't ask
[2:16:22] the ministry anything because they don't
[2:16:23] want them know what the ministry thinks
[2:16:24] about
[2:16:25] it and that the same way they don't want
[2:16:27] to ask God when you don't ask God about
[2:16:30] stuff you do your own thing and hope God
[2:16:32] bless it and God said no I'm not
[2:16:35] blessing that you have to ask me first
[2:16:38] you have to talk to me first see what my
[2:16:41] mind is on the matter and if we start to
[2:16:44] do that then we make ourselves dependent
[2:16:46] on God then God loves that because we
[2:16:49] are depending on him we we not
[2:16:51] committing our own selves to do our own
[2:16:52] thing we say Lord what is your mind on
[2:16:55] this matter because I want your mind on
[2:16:57] this matter how do I deal with it over
[2:17:00] the years I've deal with it this way and
[2:17:02] I have
[2:17:06] failed you know what it says the thing
[2:17:08] for madness doing the same thing at the
[2:17:09] same spot over and over again and
[2:17:12] expecting a different result you dig the
[2:17:13] hole You Dig the hole You Dig the hole
[2:17:15] you going to a next whole right what you
[2:17:18] expect nothing
[2:17:21] at least dig somewh
[2:17:22] else do something different you
[2:17:25] recognize your way have been failure
[2:17:27] your way have been crashing and what why
[2:17:30] you have been making
[2:17:31] circles why you have not hitting the
[2:17:34] target
[2:17:37] why something is
[2:17:40] wrong look at David David do I walk
[2:17:42] through the valley of the sh of that I
[2:17:44] shall fear no evil for dou with me run
[2:17:46] staff they comfort me don't prepar me
[2:17:49] look how he talking don't prepar me a
[2:17:50] table in the presence of my enemy my
[2:17:53] cup run it over hit out of people
[2:17:57] Abraham was very comfortable when he
[2:17:59] tell lot choose he was no God I Vex boy
[2:18:04] I Repent I bring my cousin along he was
[2:18:07] in that mode you know and know he choose
[2:18:09] the best friend Vex look what he choose
[2:18:11] and he and he tell wife Sarah you know
[2:18:13] he do go and choose the best
[2:18:16] place and desert for me
[2:18:19] no that that how the mother needers talk
[2:18:22] you're complaining you're complain
[2:18:23] you're complaining you get supporters
[2:18:25] Yeah Boy And you see lot and lot and lot
[2:18:26] the whole sermon is
[2:18:29] lot go they talk to lot God talk to you
[2:18:33] go they talk to your family God talk to
[2:18:35] you and as soon as they separate God
[2:18:37] tell Abraham look East West sou all is
[2:18:42] yours lot had to pay for the
[2:18:44] consequences of his decision to go that
[2:18:46] way Abraham stood his ground even though
[2:18:49] he was have a desert at first so
[2:18:52] sometime God may give you an experience
[2:18:54] that is a pure desert and a sister or
[2:18:57] brother who I wouldn't say well lot like
[2:19:00] then they seem more blessed and over
[2:19:02] blessed than you but time just
[2:19:06] time all
[2:19:10] right when one member will talk against
[2:19:12] another member you know that's wrong you
[2:19:14] commanded to pray for one another that
[2:19:15] displeases God all right we on the
[2:19:18] stretch keep seeing that long time about
[2:19:21] you feeling sorry for
[2:19:22] you all right I got the baptism of the
[2:19:25] Holy Spirit here this bum that still has
[2:19:28] nothing to do with it that is just a
[2:19:30] temporal gift for you this is what some
[2:19:33] ministers take and they stick into the
[2:19:35] people and mess them up and wipe them
[2:19:37] out and say there's no need for the Bing
[2:19:39] Holy Ghost because of this statment
[2:19:40] there that's just a temporal gift for
[2:19:42] you the real gift is in your soul down
[2:19:45] in here that was born of God that
[2:19:47] controls the whole thing to the word of
[2:19:50] God
[2:19:51] and the will of God and there is where
[2:19:53] you grow your child of God and so forth
[2:19:56] he says now watch let's continue now he
[2:19:59] says watch then you see your real father
[2:20:02] in God if you if you you know
[2:20:04] Pentecostal because that's the real stat
[2:20:06] is in your soul before there was even a
[2:20:09] spirit is was in your soul that Soul if
[2:20:12] that Soul didn't come from God then it
[2:20:13] wasn't a GM of God to begin with you are
[2:20:15] deceived so what is he saying here the
[2:20:17] seed which is in the word is what God
[2:20:20] put in you
[2:20:21] but the holy ghost coming to do
[2:20:22] something to that seed just wait a
[2:20:24] minute here what he said now now there
[2:20:26] is a false anointed once in the last
[2:20:28] days not false jesuses many will come to
[2:20:31] me that day and say Lord have not I
[2:20:33] prophesied and cast out the your name I
[2:20:35] was Pentecostal glory to God I shouted
[2:20:36] and spoken tongues depart from me that
[2:20:39] work iniquity now this is the part I
[2:20:40] want to get to and we're going to
[2:20:43] close like my little story about the
[2:20:45] eagle finding his mother right he said
[2:20:47] it was it wasn't a chicken it was an
[2:20:49] eagle to begin with his his mother knew
[2:20:51] she had laid two eggs there had to be
[2:20:53] another one she flying around the banard
[2:20:55] and so on that's the way every born
[2:20:56] again Christian when you come I don't
[2:20:58] care how manych you join how many names
[2:21:00] you put name on the book he say you are
[2:21:02] Eagle isn't that right and watch all
[2:21:05] this clocking of the hand you join this
[2:21:06] join that it's nonsense it is genuine
[2:21:09] adding word to word you don't take a
[2:21:12] human germ of your father and a germ
[2:21:14] from a dog and from a cat and a chicken
[2:21:17] it's a human germ and that's the body of
[2:21:19] Jesus Christ all this is from the me
[2:21:21] called The
[2:21:22] Rapture the body of Christ will be a
[2:21:24] part of his body watch this now the
[2:21:26] bride will have to be word added to word
[2:21:29] added to word Luther's justification
[2:21:32] Wesley sanctification Pentecostal Bap
[2:21:35] Holy Ghost the preachers leave out this
[2:21:37] because they want word added to word
[2:21:38] after word no experience no Holy Ghost
[2:21:40] let the prophet continue watch
[2:21:42] restoration of the gift and the rights
[2:21:44] on top of it it's got to be word on top
[2:21:46] of word germ of top of germ life on top
[2:21:50] of life to bring out the full statue of
[2:21:52] the Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ word
[2:21:54] on top of word means fa virtue and Faith
[2:21:56] knowledge and virtue right on up that's
[2:21:59] word on top of word right you understand
[2:22:01] that you get that now watch right on
[2:22:03] straight on the top in that slot after
[2:22:04] birly can is what Holy Spirit to come
[2:22:07] upon word on top of word on top of word
[2:22:09] so God put all these virtues inside of
[2:22:10] you and then come the spirit now come to
[2:22:13] live in those virtues to live inside of
[2:22:15] you now here what he say here many says
[2:22:18] join our congregation right you must
[2:22:20] Shout must get a sensation he said how a
[2:22:23] woman a man a child of God has born of
[2:22:26] the spirit of God deny the word of God
[2:22:28] how could Christ deny his own word and
[2:22:30] if Christ is in you it can't deny his
[2:22:32] own word then he says the same same next
[2:22:35] chapter verse 9 of the Rapture then how
[2:22:39] do we get into this
[2:22:40] body but after all the word and word
[2:22:43] here how do we get into this body First

[2:47:56] neutral at the same time the vehicle
[2:47:59] engine cut off so I did not get brakes
[2:48:02] as a result of this the vehicle picked
[2:48:04] up speed going downhill she said it was

[2:55:42] said to my wife this morning I don't
[2:55:44] know where 2024 went this year just
[2:55:47] disappeared
[2:55:48] and time it just feels like it's just
[2:55:50] moving so fast I was saying to someone
[2:55:53] BR punch back when I was in secondary
[2:55:55] school I was looking you know back then
[2:55:57] they were talking about Y2K and you know
[2:55:58] all these things and thinking that we
[2:56:01] wouldn't even be here then and to see
[2:56:02] how God has used time as a great
[2:56:04] equalizer and a great test to see who
[2:56:07] would stand and we see all of the things
[2:56:10] happening in the world in the natural in
[2:56:11] the spiritual in the economics in the
[2:56:13] government and everything was preaching
[2:56:16] about today and to see that you are
[2:56:17] still standing
[2:56:19] your wing might be a little twisted but
[2:56:21] you're still standing you're still a
[2:56:22] eagle you have some Battle Scars but
[2:56:25] you're still a eagle you've been through
[2:56:26] some mountains and some valleys but
[2:56:28] you're still a eagle and you're still
[2:56:30] standing and by the grace of the lord we
[2:56:32] are looking to be under expectation for
[2:56:34] what God will do because God could never
[2:56:36] lie and his promise is always true so we
[2:56:38] know there's a promise of healing that's
[2:56:40] hanging over the body there's a promise
[2:56:41] of Revival that's hanging over the body
[2:56:44] there's a promise of Deliverance that's
[2:56:45] hanging over the body there's a promise
[2:56:47] of restoration that's that's hanging
[2:56:48] over the body there's a promise of the
[2:56:50] baptism of the Holy Ghost that's hanging
[2:56:51] over the body and one of these days as
[2:56:54] brother said when brother Sabu said
[2:56:55] something came over him something going
[2:56:57] to come over you and it will not be you

[2:57:03] seed will just pulsate something on the
[2:57:06] inside and the devil didn't put it there
