this time lord maybe we could cut through the noise and we could interrupt the schedule of Our Lives that are times almost feels as if it has been planned out for us because situations come challenges come issues arise that would attempt to just pull our time pull our attention pull away our Focus so we thank you for this welcome Interruption lord it's not always convenient father but Lord it is a decision that we have made to report in for Duty as soldiers again sometimes how we feel against the stresses of Our Lives to come together around your word knowing that it's an opening a window a door into the heavenlies and the mind of God and that just five minutes in the presence of God could change our situation could change our circumstances and so many times we look at things one way and when we come into the presence of God we see it your way help us to see it uoe tonight may you speak to us through your word Lord may you use me as your instrument may you take control of my vocal cords and bring my thoughts Lord under your control Lord we submit ourselves to your Authority tonight we pray for the body of Believers that I've gathered here tonight we pray for those that may hear this tape we pray for those that are yet to join us Lord we commit this study into your hands and we pray for Lord every person and their own individual challenges their own situations those that they are comfortable to share or speak and even those that they don't want anybody to know about but we thank you that you are Lord the great physician you are the great great healer you are a great Mighty counselor all the psychologists and the psychiatrists and the counselors and the gurus as it were are just are just a fraction of what you are as the great counselor so may you counsel us through your word tonight and Lord may it be that we could leave this meeting with a different perspective you said be transformed by the renewing of our minds Lord that renewing of our minds is a reboot as it were Lord it is it is it has been such a a different year and as we come to the end of this journey of this 2020 that has been filled with so many curveballs and so many corners and so many turns we thank you for your spiritual leadership that has helped us two in every corner so we commit the service into your hands Lord and if there's anyone sick anyone needing untouched as the word Goes Forth Lord May healing come with the word Lord as you said you would do you are still in control we commit it into your hands today in the precious name of Jesus Christ amen and amen and amen well it's certainly a great privilege to be together again just praising the Lord and to be reporting for Duty in such a time as this and I want to physically start by really appreciating uh brother for the service on Sunday uh last Sunday it was really a tremendous tremendous Masterpiece of a message so run that you may obtain and it the way it was presented and dealing with entitlement and dealing with the prodigal son I shared with him I've never seen it presented that way and I love it when we could look at the word and see it presented in in a way that is in line with the word but you can you can see the the the the relatableness if that's a word of it you know to see that you could relate to the situation so I want to kind of continue along that vein uh tonight um so I have a little thoughts um so remember me in prayer and the internet has been acting up a little bit for me as well so if I do dip out but over that has assured me that he is standing by um if necessary um so for uh uh uh teaching tonight I want to call this the curse of entitlement because of entitlement and you know as Boulevard was preaching I just want to kind of talk with you you know Bible studies these sessions on Tuesday are conversation it's not a service so I could just kind of chat a little bit and have a conversation so I know you can't respond but I trust everybody is doing fine uh trust that um you know you're hanging in there I trust that your sword shop you know I trust that the trials that come in your way you know they have been designed for you I trust that the gifts of these trials that God has sent you away You Realize by now that they are designed for you to come to maturity for you to be strong you know and uh you know as well everybody was preaching on Sunday you know I was looking at the word and I was looking at my own life and and that is my Approach personally and if you could take a page from it tonight is it is that singleness of focus to see how the world impacts you it is very easy to wonder how the word impact somebody else you know it is nature to look at other people but when I'm you know in church or in a service I'm always looking to see how can I be stronger as a Believer you know what can I learn from it it's easy to look at other people and and say well you know there's a word for her or him or whatever but I really want to see how the world has impacted my life and this mental reality of entitlement the spirit of entitlement it it got me you know at first I went from I went through different emotions if I can say that on on Sunday different you know points and if you haven't seen the message I encourage you to so watch it and if you have seen it I encourage you to watch it again but I went through different emotions different thoughts as the service was going on because he was speaking about entitlement and and I realized that this thing goes as far as there will be people who they feel that they're entitled to go to heaven and they're not there are people who believe that they are entitled because they're any message they will make the rapture so I started to reach that point of looking at this thing called entitlement because this thing of entitlement it's when you convince yourself that you deserve something based on some pretext that is your own you know and as I was going through it I was looking at probably presenting the prodigal son and I was kind of starting to look through scripture and I was like I never really thought of it that way because you know we see them when we preach this you know the Bible say one day people go and say Lord Lord I've done all these things for you and go to City apart from me you workers of iniquity you woke up iniquity so it means that that person who is speaking to God actually believes that what they have done was enough to qualify them to enter in and God is saying it really wasn't the fact that he has to address it to them and say depart from me is shattering their belief that they were qualified it is shattering their belief that they were entitled you know I have but rub it said something really powerful Sunday and I and and it it shook me because he said that during this whole pandemic and I was seeing a statistic um published by a group of Christian you know analysts around the world and they were actually saying during this pandemic as far as they can tell one-fifth meaning one out of every five Christians in this pandemic have not shown up for virtual service so they were going to say that made a statement on Sunday he said this pandemic some people will go out and say people will come in and it may be as I was just going to I'm just sharing with you I'm going to get to the teaching in a bit I'm just sharing some thoughts with you to to just you know play some context on where I'm at so I was just wondering so I say the people who haven't shown up um because if Church coming to your home now as it is then what is the excuse if you're not working on your home then why wouldn't somebody connect but if you have a conversation with them they actually feel entitled or they believe that they still go into heaven or they believe in their in their context that they're on the way to the Rapture if you ask them a question you know where's the destination as they're comfortable because there's some level of entitlement and when you look through the wood there's no there's no support for that position the only way people can miss something is because they thought they were there and weren't because there's nobody I can't find somebody who is deliberately trying to miss the Rapture so so let me tell you so people aren't coming to church trying to miss the rapture that that that doesn't mathematically add up unless there's something mentally wrong with you people are not showing up to church deliberately trying to self-sabotage it's not deliberate so if it is not deliberate then it means that there is this expectation that is not in alignment so call it a personal expectation that is not an alignment with God's expectation because I find it very difficult to believe that after all these years of hearing you would of seeing scripture fulfilled of seeing the unfolding of Prophecy yes but Ibraham would say modern events made clear by profiting but by by prophecy so it's happening before very eyes how people could be complacent and and entitlement is really is really taking it for granted so it's there's so many ways to look at it so in time so a ticket for granted because of X this should happen and the reality is God doesn't operate that way you know what it really said the shape into our core so I started to look in scripture to get a basis written but over kind of kind of mention some things but you know our society has developed into this level of entitlement so I could speak from a position of being a a manager so to speak so you have people who graduate from University and they believe that because they have a degree they're entitled for certain things it has nothing to do with whether they have the experience where they could deliver value it is an entitlement that comes from well I did this so I should have this So within we'll say within certain professionals or certain industries or with any government sector or there's this entitlement that comes with well I've been here for a long time so I have seniority so because I have seniority I am entitled to whether it is the promotion The Parking Spot I'm entitled to the cubicle or the corner office so it is something that is spiritual and it's natural and people either fight because they feel they're entitled they they they fight a certain way so the point I'm trying to make is Sunday service brought to the surface all the things that we are entitled to and Amber Robert brought this powerful thought about the connection between entitlement and comparison and I will show in the scripture how much God hates that and two specific references of that comparison and the entitlement issue so if I were to identify tonight what the teaching points out of this session is tonight it is to strip away that feeling of entitlement that taken it for granted that that because there's a scripture that speaks of don't let a man eat if he awoke the fact that the scripture needs to be said means there are people who want to eat without working so if if the situation didn't did not exist there would be no need for the scripture so God every man I want to work he shouldn't you don't deserve to eat if you don't want to work so he was making a connection between I call it earning or working and I may have said it before but the root word for worship and the root word for work is the same word so work and worship are connected so worship is actually a form of work and we know through scripture that praise is a sacrifice and a sacrifice means it has a cost to something and but over it was really inspired when he talked about the free and we actually see it in the scripture what is free and say okay there's there's nothing really free there is a cause so so salvation is free but there's a cost which was Calvary so I want us to to understand that there's a there's work there's always work involved so salvation is free but Jesus worked and the Believers who will climb the mountain it can be out of laziness or it is not accidental it has to be deliberate so you have to have a mindset so I realized so much this mindset because if you have this entitlement situation going on it means you take this position of give me do for me I should have it so because I I should have it I don't need to work for it because I'm entitled to it and it removes the need to work for something and I want us to push past it because coming tonight is work I covered over a little while ago I say I actually just got home I had a meeting it is not as if home I said along to it in my terms everything in in life is work prayer is work reading your Bible is work going to work is work you have to work on your marriage you have to work on your relationship with your children you have to work to be in church on time you have to work to be in this meeting tonight so everything is about work and it is it is is that activity and that that forward movement that forward momentum finding a way to reach where you need to reach so I want to encourage you tonight by kind of digging a bit more into this issue of entitlement the the mentality of it the spirit of it and as my title is the curse of entitlement because if ever there was a time that people were entitled it's no people feel you know you walk in a place um let me get your Wi-Fi password now and there are some people who will walk into your home or your business whatever and if you give them your Wi-Fi they're looking at it is you any problem you know they don't see it as is it's your wife something wrong with you for not giving any Wi-Fi password because we have gotten entitled we feel we deserve to have it we we need to connect we are we are so it is something that is so pervasive there are people who will feel they entitled to a certain seat in church people feel entitled to a certain Park I'm not trying to go anywhere I just I just throw in context you know people feel it and so there's so much so I want us to continue to look because brother had me going through my own introspection because always the word has to make you look at yourself to see how you're lining up with your word and to see if there's any behavior that you have that shouldn't be there and automatically self-correct self-correct is like a GPS I know if you ever use a GPS or use Waze or something and you know if you miss a corner the thing automatically will tell you okay make the next right and if you fly past that next right it will tell you will make the next right because they're trying to get you back to wherever your destination was that you're supposed to be going and every surface for a service was is about really self-correction it's about you were coming to say listen you're going too much to the left you know get back to the highway you know so that is the context I want to study teaching I don't intend to be too long with you tonight um so I want to start by saying our society our world even the church business has this entitlement mentality I can't tell you how many business people have spoken to who feel that things should just work out and it's it's an entitlement that it it is that it should happen and it really shouldn't happen until you make it happen because there's no accident there's no there's no it's supposed to it is all about work and this is not just natural it is scriptural because the Israelites coming out of Egypt had such a horrible entitlement mindset it was it was incredible I'm going to over reference it we know this story the children of Israel was in Egypt in bondage and they cried out to God to take them out of bondage we know this God dropped the plagues their bondage but yet still when they come out and they break out and they never thought they could get out and they really wanted to get out and they had a hard labor and the grandfather was a slave and the father was a slave so I had reached I was staying Exodus Exodus 16 3. and the children of Israel said unto them word to God we had died by the hand of the Lord in the land of Egypt when we sat by The Flash spots which is which is the meat and when we did eat bread to the full in other words we ate till we couldn't eat no more for ye have brought us forth into this Wilderness to kill this whole assembly with hunger so hold on these are the same people who cried they were bondage for 400 years and now that they're out of bondage they're actually making a comparison between the meat and the bread that they ate in their full so now let's get to my substantive so we're going to go to the Book of Numbers 11. numbers 11. and we're going to read from verse 1. and this is where we're going to spend most of our time tonight and we're going to try to bring it to a close like I said forgive me if my connection drops so numbers 11 how many lovely Book of Numbers numbers 11 and verse 1. and when the people complained it displeased the Lord all right so I want to start I want to stop right here for one second you know how much people love to complain we before we go deeper what are the worst things you could do as a Believer is complain I have to look at myself you have to look at yourself We complain too much you complain about the traffic you complain people who diving too slow you complain the list your complete list God help us to bring our complaints to zero that's that's the challenge and that's what I want to challenge everybody with tonight stop complaining you could change your life tonight but just stop complaining I was challenging we had an officers a a team leaders meeting and I challenge the leaders I said listen change your complaining into into gratefulness that whatever it was teaching that on Sunday it was so powerful because for everything you can write down write down everything you want to complain about and I could tell you the list is much longer about what you could be thankful about and if you don't know where to start just thank God that you're alive let's start with that because I don't know what complaint you possibly could have that could even deal with the fact that your life did you eat today whether you eat cricks where they eat eat lettuce you remember we read in scripture in Proverbs better is a meal of herbs where love is you remember we had our conversation so whether today was cricks and and bitter herbs you have something to thank God for but I want you to see it's not just about not complaining I want you to see that when did people complete it displease the Lord and the Lord heard it so it's not just that God hearing your personal God also hear any complaints and your complaints affecting God now in the Amplified that says now the people became like those who complain and whine about their hardships so it is not as if God don't know you have hardships you know but his point is don't complain and the Lord heard it and when the Lord heard it his anger was kindled all right and the fire of the Lord burnt among them and consumed them that were in the uttermost parts of the camp so God started to judge the children of Israel deaths because of complaining I want you to start to look at your life no I want to encourage you tonight by firstly saying you can't change your past you can't change what happened an hour ago or 20 years ago so we put in a a a a reset button in this meeting tonight your attitude your approach your statements whatever is going on prior to this meeting we're putting a stop in it tonight and putting a hard reset because you can't change it but you have control from this meeting forward what happens next but I want us to draw reference that complaining actually brought death complaining broad judgment so complain about your business your job your boss the rent the house the roof the car the church the neighbor the government the prime minister the police the election the whatever you want to complain about stop it there's there's nothing in Scripture that supports complaining so we want to establish a foundation so when somebody have this complaining attitude they need to refer them to this the Lord consumed them that were in the uttermost part of the camp so the Lord burn and devoured those in the outlying parts of the camp verse two this is and the people Cried unto Moses and when Moses prayed unto the Lord the fire was quenched so it was Moses prayer God I wanted to see this now God was so upset at the complaining that he started to Reign judgment and Moses after the people come to Moses said Moses look what God doing Moses went to pray to stop the judgment and what was his sin because remember sin is judgment God only judges based on sinner so what does that mean complaining is equal to a sinner oh you never saw it that way before so let's bring a parallel here God Reign fire on Sodom and Gomorrah for the way they lived God Ran fire on the turn of Israel because they're complaining so I want us to show sometimes we operating that okay we above this and we above that and I don't do this and I don't do that and God say look at your complaining and he is angry because what complaining means is you throw in God's blessings back in his face let me say it again for you to complain because God is blessing you your next break is a blessing come on now did the area just breathe is a blessing the fact that you can be here is a blessing some of us don't even see it that way the job you have is a blessing the little opportunities you have is a blessing because you are under a different Covenant so other people can look at other things and attribute success or achievement to other things but whatever you have your luck your position is by the grace of God and when you complain God sees it as after all I have done for you you still acting as if I haven't done nothing so I want you to reposition in your mind where complaining fits it and we're building now to how this is tied to entitlement now all right and the people Cried unto Moses and when Moses prayed unto the Lord the fire was quenched and he called the name of the place Tavera because of the fire of the Lord burned among them let's go to verse 4. and the mixed multitude that was among them fell a lusting now in the Amplified it says do you Rebel among them who followed Israel from Egypt had greedy desires for familiar and delicious food and the Israelites wept again so this is where it is mind-boggling to me because if you complain in verse 1 and you see what God did how could you come and even complain again so this reminds me of what Abraham saying he could preach till he blew in the face until you are really converted your behavior not changing you know so they just witnessed people complain and God judged them and here it is and the mixed multitude that was among them fellow lusting and the children of Israel also wept again and said who shall give us flesh to eat who will give us meat to eat is what the Amplified says let's dig deeper now this is where brother was preaching and I was like whoa listen to the context we remember the flesh we remember the fish which we did eat in Egypt freely you see the word freely there we'll come back to that in a minute we remember the fish which we did eat in Egypt freely the curcumas and the melons and the leaks and the onions and the garlic so they were now they were actually equating they actually they're such a disconnect in their condition that they forgot that they were in bondage when they had this I want us to catch that for a second let me let me just I want to just make another Point here so even though it is free they actually forgot the great price that came with this free food they forgot the cost of this free food quarter Gold free you remember brother was saying on Sunday anything that is free somebody paying for it so they themselves were paying for their free food by their bondage it's very confusing to me to see this because it means that they were almost sound something like they were willing to give up freedom to go back to this I want you to think about that for a minute it was willing to give up Freedom it would seem to go back to this verse 6 but now our soul is dried away the soul is in our soul is driving when there's nothing at all beside this manner before our eyes God give you Freedom keep providing for you and you're throwing it in God's face I want you to see how God started process is now right and the manner was a coriander seed and the color thereof as the color of the dillium and the people went about and gathered it and ground it in Mills or beat it in a mortar and beat it in pans and made cakes of it and the taste of it was as a taste of fresh oil and when the Dew fell upon the camp in the night the Mana fell upon it then Moses heard the people weep throughout their families every man in the door of his tent and the anger of the Lord was kindled greatly Moses also was displeased so the Deep question here tonight so far is did they really want to be free because there was a price of Freedom here it is they were free but here it is they actually feel entitled to more than what God has given him at that point in time and look how God treated with it and we're going to build into something in a bit I'm not going to be too long with you verse 11 and Moses said unto the Lord wherefore has thou Afflicted thy servant in other words why have you been so hard on your servant and wherefore have I not found favor in thy sight that thou lays the burden of all these people upon me so the complaints of the people because they felt entitled to more than what God was given them was so great that it brought a level of of pain in Moses own life have I conceived all these people so Moses now saying lord it's not my I didn't conceive them or no have I begotten them that thou should say unto me carry them in thy bosom as a nursing father bearing the sucking child unto the land which thou swear is unto their fathers when should I have flesh to give unto all his people so this became a major issue for the true individuals and for Moses for they weep unto me saying give us flesh that we may eat now we reach a point now and this is interesting this is a point in Moses life which I don't know many of you see where Moses this letter Moses almost getting depressed Moses said I am not able to Bear all these people alone because it is too heavy for me it became overwhelming for Moses now bear in mind this is after Moses leviture and out of Egypt this is this is in a mature stage of Moses Ministry he was able to weather Pharaoh he was able to weather the place was able to whether the media and he was able and here it is it reached a point because of the complaints of the people because of the emotion of the people because of the attitudes of the people he is saying listen this is now too much for me and many of us situations come to us and we say this is this is too much he said if thou deal thus with me kill me I pray thee out of hand if I have found fear in thy sight and let me not see my wretchedness in the Amplified it says so if this is the way you are going to deal with me please kill me at once if I have found favor in your sight and do not let me see my wretchedness so I want to draw a parallel because he went through Elijah's own situation and here we see Moses coming to his own position where he was feeling like almost giving up so I want to remind us as a people and as a church that having the emotional feeling to give up is something that people go through but time and time again we're seeing that having the feeling of wanting to give up or through your hard to say is this is this worth fighting is that word Preston is it a word keep him going after all these years I'm time on time again we see God will provide Grace and strength no matter how you feel in the time of your need to give you that in Elijah case it was the juniper tree experience the place of rest in Moses case we'll see it Moses gets the help that he needs he gets his support system that he needs so he could fight but the situation that existed prompted all of this verse 16. and the Lord said unto Moses I'm going somewhere because I want us to see now that and I've made a point before friends and I wanted to catch this because this entitlement thing people go and do what they want to do because they feel they entitle the happiness on their tombs are push in there now right so they feel entitled so they feel the entitled to go and have the friends they want to have that's that's the that's pushing entitlement now they want to go and do what they want to do and this is the painful part when when you come back to God or you get restored I want us to understand that God is just and he is consistent you get him back to God doesn't change the consequences of bad decisions you make huh because God is a god of his word God can forgive you and still discipline you at the same time it's a paradox let me say it again God could forgive you and still discipline you because he's a god of his word and we'll get it and the Lord said unto Moses so I want us to understand what led to this so now we're coming into administration of Return of Israel but what prompted this was a bunch of ungrateful people because they made it seem as if they prefer to be back in Egypt like how many people come to church come to the message come to the Lord and because things in their mind don't work on the way they think it should or they say well when I was in the world I have more money when I was in the world I used to when I was in the world because this is what they are saying there we remember when we was back in Egypt this is how it was but now we come into this new place this new Journey this new experience we're coming to the deeper aspects of the world I do have as much friends as I used to have before so I find in an evening I do have too much things to do but when I was there I used to have people lying with me no you you see the connection and God is saying when you talk like that you make me wonder why I bring you out to Egypt because you need to know what you really want to value are you valuing and this this description of the fish and the cucumbers and the melons and the leeks and the onions could be anything huh anything that use of value because when somebody backslides backslide means to go back where you were before you slide back it is something in the sliding back that is still connected to your heart that pulls you back so you're trying to do this New Path but you're still looking back to when I used to when I used to when I used to this is what they were saying here and the complaints was I don't know friends I don't have this we don't have fun I had more time when I was in the world had more time but now now is service on Sunday and bible study on Tuesday and service on Wednesday I'm permitting on Friday I have no evenings we're dealing with with yet we're dealing with mindset nowhere entitled so Moses now reaching this point like many of us reach many leaders reach this level of complaining is too much so God is about to deal with it and look how he deals with the situation and I want you to see and we need to understand this because God starts to deal with this situation by bringing structure you need structure in your life it sounds simple but you need structure you need to know when you're going to pray you need to know when they're going to read you need to have structure to your life and the Lord said unto Moses gather unto me 70 men of the Elders of Israel whom does knowest to be the Elders of the people and officers over them and bring them into the Tabernacle of the congregation that they may stand there with thee and I will come down and talk with thee there and I will take of the spirit which is upon thee and put it upon them and they shall bear the burden of the people with thee that thou be it not thyself alone you see that that that's powerful so that is God now seeing the burden upon Moses seeing the amount of people seeing the amount of needs and saying let me bring some structure around Moses so that Moses after beard is burden alone and that is why I really want to salute the officers of the church who support the office of the pastor because it's impossible to carry to carry the burden alone it was so in the New Testament as well that is why the deacons were created because when they looked at the situation there were people with needs and God wanted it that the ministry can focus on the bringing of the word the breaking of the bread the opening of mysteries steady people that's why it's impossible for you to be part of a church and not want to know how you could help how we could support anybody with me tonight Verse 18 and say thou unto the people sanctify yourself against tomorrow and you shall eat flesh for ye have wept in the ears of the Lord saying who shall give us flesh to eat for it was well with us in Egypt so God now this is serious serious serious therefore the Lord will give you flesh and he shall eat that I want to soak in that verse 18. I want to read it in the Amplified say to the people consecrate separate as holy yourselves for tomorrow and you shall eat meat for you have wept in self-pity you see that South PT thing in the ears of the Lord seeing who will give us me to eat for we will well off in Egypt so God is repeating what they are saying God and discard what they're saying he put in it in contact because he's coming to deal with this complaint and this entitlement that came from being in Egypt therefore the Lord will give you meat and you shall eat listen now so God said this is what you want listen to verse 19. you shall eat you shall not eat one day nor two days nor five days neither 10 days nor 20 days so God is saying you want to eat it's not gonna be two days it's not gonna be five days it's not gonna be ten days no 20 days listen but even a whole month God is now answering so this is I want you to be careful now when you cry for the wrong thing and you're flying the face of God God said this is what you want okay fine but even a whole month until it come out at your nostrils and it below some unto you because that you have despised the Lord which is among you and have wept before him saying why King we fought out of Egypt friends this is serious I want to soak in this a little bit because I want to build friends I don't know if I'm expressing the right way but too many people complaining and flying in the face of God and they're wondering why things operating so and God is literally putting a pause on your activities because he's saying you are not acknowledging me you're talking about how things used to be and how this was and you're looking outside and you're not looking at what I'm doing for you right now and the fact that God is repeating this thing about Egypt is as if God's saying this thing is reference of Egypt just getting upset you shall eat verse 19 not you shall not eat one day nor two days nor five days neither 10 days not 20 days but even a whole month in other words your one meat take meat I wouldn't give it for one day but I'll give you a whole month until you're coming out your nose you will get so much meat that you would it will be load someone to you you'll get immediately heated the Lord because you have despised the Lord despite means hey the Lord I want to read me amplify because I want to I want it to stick but a whole month until it comes out of your nostrils and is disgusting to you because you are rejected and the spicy Lord who is among you and have wept in self-pity before him saying why did we come out of Egypt verse 21 and Moses said the people among whom I am are 600 000 footmen and thou has said I will give them flesh that they may eat a whole month shall the flux and the herds be slain for them to suffice them so Moses saying these are how much men are with me shall he flux in other words the animals we have be slain for them to suffice them or shall all the fish of the sea be gather together for them to surprise them so Moses saying Lord is a lot of people we talk about here is it about to kill all the animals we have to get all the fish so Moses himself trying to wrap his mind around how God going to do this and the Lord said unto Moses is the Lord that stands whacked short that thou shalt see now whether my word shall come to pass under thee or not so God said to Moses After all you've been through you will ask me a question like how I'm gonna do it no I want you to understand something this is I want you to see a sight of God people don't normally get to see this is God doing something and he's doing it I don't want to say with reluctance but he's doing it with very intentional because he's doing it because they asked to it but he's going he be doing this with judgment title you're not doing it out of blessing you want it take it because I have been providing your needs but you're what you want you're so fussing about it you're stressing on the man of God Hallelujah you're going past what my provision is for you and the reason point that you have a man of God frustrated the man of God wants to know he want to give up he he reached a point based on your complaints that he said listen God just kill me yes and not only that you keep referring to how you used to live you keep your foot into how things was before you came into connection with my blessing I want to make sure the message gets home so you keep referring to you know when I was in the world you know why do people in the world and and God hate it he hates it verse 24 and Moses went out and told the people the words of the Lord and gathered the seventy men of the Elders of the people and set them around above the Tabernacle and the Lord came down in a cloud and spake unto him and took of the spirit that was upon him and gave it unto the seventy elders you ever read this before so you see you see how easy it is for the brother to say that when you look at the church that the the spirit of the pastor is many people that the anointing on a man can be on somebody else here it is God is saying clearly I took his spirit for my mom Moses and divide it upon the people and gave it unto these seventy elders and it came to pass that when the spirit rested upon them they prophesied and did not cease so suddenly it is now Moses and 70 men around Moses all under the spirit and testimony of Prophecy and they didn't stop prophesying the anointing is upon them verse 26 and there remain two of the men in the camp the name of the one was eldad and the name of the other midad and the spirit rested upon them and they were of them that were written but went not out unto the Tabernacle and they prophesied in the camp verse 27 and they ran a young man and told Moses and said eldad and Mirad do prophesy in the camp and Joshua the son of nun the servant of Moses one of his young men answered and said my Lord Moses forbid them and Moses said unto him envious thou for my sake what God had all the Lord's people were prophets and that the Lord would put his Spirit upon them and Moses got him into the camp he and the elders of Israel verse 31. and they went fought a win from the Lord and brought quails from the sea and let them fall by the camp as it were a Day's Journey on this side and as it were a Day's Journey on the other side round about the camp and as it were two qubits high upon the face of the Earth hmm and the people stood up all that day and all that night and all the next day and they gathered the quails he that gathered leaves gathered ten homers and they spread them all abroad for themselves around the camp verse 33 and while the flesh was yet between their teeth hmm it was chewed the Wrath of the Lord was kindled against the people and the Lord swore the people with a very great plague in the amplifier that says while the meat was still being still between their teeth before it was chewed so in other words as they bite before they even get to chew it the anger of the Lord struck them with a severe plague so this is what I this is why I call it the curse of entitlement and he called the name of that place because they buried the people that lost it and the people junied and we'll end there without reading on that part tonight I just want to share a few more things on this thing entitlement is based on this belief that because of x you are entitled to a certain thing so you believe that because you are from a certain family you should have something because you have a certain education you should have something because you any message you should have something because you did this you should have X whatever it is whether it's our standard of living whether is you're supposed to be happy whether it is all entitlement and you will find as you dig in Scripture you know there are a lot of people who and we talk about it your trials and and conquered all joy and and we talk about that he's suffering to this present time are not willing to be compared with the glory that should be revealing us and you'll find other Christians complain about the trials and intestines and as much as we preach about it listen I just have some ideas you know or your your ending so wait now you think eyes have just happy Happy Days we all have rough days it takes great strength to smile when you be horrible you know and I was looking at the scriptures as look at Paul in in in in Philippians 4 11 you'll have to find it I'll just share tonight I'm not gonna be too long I just wanted to just add some things to what about Robert said on Sunday Paul said in the Philippians not that I speak in respect of want so Paul is saying I'm not speaking in the position of having for I have learned learned in whatsoever State I am there with to be content I find this is powerful so this is not something that Paul was born with Paul was saying that he learned and this is this is him this is this is a scripture that helps us with this entitlement thing so so luckily look at Paul's example in verse 12 I know both how to be a beast do you know how to be a beast do you know how to live low do you know how to live with with bread and bread as even I even say bread and butter you know I say bread and bread do you know what it is to be a beast so Paul is saying my life situations by what I've gone through I've not realized and we'll see where the scripture ends up that it's a journey God carries us through so listen to Paul I want to say he said I know both how to be a base and how to abound everywhere and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry both are bound and to suffer need so this is Paul this is this is this is this is to me this is so exciting because Paul is in I've learned it didn't come naturally it's not something I was born with I learned to deal with the Mountaintop and I've learned to deal with the values I've learned to live when my account have money and when they have no money and this is the context of the scripture because one of the greatest challenges we have with scripture is people like to take a scripture and use it like a wedge like a weapon without the context this is the lead up into reverse I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me this scripture I can do all things it's not a license to say I can build a plane the context of this scripture is taken from The Narrative of Paul explaining I can do all things as in live on the mountain and live in the valley because it is God who strengthens me to be able to behave when I'm on the mountain and live when I'm in the Valley I can do all things be in a position of being a beast or abounding you know how many Christians can live in abound oh come on let's push now you know which Christians cannot live in a spirit in a space of success and that is why God will keep you in a certain place because the moment you start to rise you start to lose your connection to The God Who helping you to rise you have to learn how to live there you know it is not something that happens automatically and if you haven't gone through the lesson let's bring in more personal if you haven't gone to the lesson of learning how to live a base God will make sure you pass that exam too because Paul's testimony is an example to us Paul could have because Paul was called from high society Paul was a learned man a student of Gamaliel he was exposed to the Finer Things and he learned how to live any Finer Things he learned how to he said I can become all all things to all men so yes he may come to church all sad because well this month my parent really woke up that good on you you know things you know things rough Paul came to the point that they couldn't tell when things was rough because he can do all things through Christ come on now who strengthens me Paul didn't feel entitled and would preach it because I'm an apostle God should not take me through summer basin that may not be right but they say but I want to drive the point home Paul wasn't saying well you know I'm a man of God so why are going through this that is the challenge of the entitlement so I want us to take the lesson from Paul tonight you know how many people say but why would whenever you ask the question why it is entitlement you're dealing with that's the issue the moment asks why this didn't work out it's because you felt entitled it should work in a certain way and Paul is saying I learned it and I want to drive home be learning the spiritual learning of our behaviors anybody with me tonight I just want to share a few more things and we'll have an early night tonight hmm somebody said for many people whatever makes them happy is what they believe they should be allowed to do I'll say it one more time for many people whatever makes them happy is what they believe they should be allowed to do and this could be any kind of thing they like to gossip they feel that so Gossip Girl is mean I feel happy they want okay I don't want to go around the list of things because you know what he list is but the Christian Life and this is why the entitlement is the problem because the Christian Life is a life of denial denying yourself so now we're driving home why this entitlementing is a problem because the entitlementing no means you feel you should have and God is saying you're suddenly you need to deny yourself so so when last have you denied yourself this is this is deep denying yourself is is so huge because you want to answer back your wife but you deny yourself the pleasure of answering back you want to say something to the boss where you deny yourself the pleasure that's how simple it is I'm a practical Christian I'm not trying to connect this to no deep mystery denying yourself means it's something that you want to do you like to do you enjoy doing but they put up breaks on it and you go against what you want to do because you can feel people tell it I'm entitled to my opinion are you are you really entitled to your own opinion as a child of God are you really entitled to your sin people come to church and come and talk about how they think it should be and everybody has a voice is that the kiss is that any word this is not trying to bring people into a state of Silence but it's understanding the context of what you really are entitled to and I will close all of the meeting with what you're supposed to be entitled to can we go a little further Our Lives should be focused not on what makes us happy now this goes against a lot of conventional thinking I'm not saying you're not supposed to be happy but this entitlement that you know seeking your happiness against the will of God is the issue because these children of Israel didn't see it as Sin this is what God got upset because a lot of us didn't see complaining our sin before I presented it this way you didn't see how God sees complaining because whenever you complain it is you throwing back whatever blessing God put for you and a provision well well a computer that I already wanted to make fifteen thousand and I only make 12 000 I'm gonna sin but but is I will give any 12 so my my 12 are good well fine I'll take it all back I'll take it all because you there I I put things in place to give you 12 because 12 is what you need and you they complaining you're gonna get 15 what you were fine well here's what I take him back my 12th or like he did with them you want 15 I'll give you 15 till you tie yourself up and you lose yourself you're sick because it's it is really a level of it ended up being a level of ungratefulness all right let me try to bring a point to close out here now so we so I want to make the point then that that that there are a lot of people say well well since I'm a Christian I have a rougher life a tougher life and but Ibraham would say like this it's not a better roses it's not that it's not what does Christianity is but people come into Christianity and I think part of the challenge maybe how it is sold meaning how people present this journey because this is this is that this is a spiritual walk it's a walk with mountains and valleys and character development yes there's joy and enjoyed with only these strings but you cannot will Joy when going with the ticket to an experience to break something out of you and now you turn up your hands saying well well I taught this question what is joy and God is taking you through something to teach you how to be obese and teach you how to abound I don't know if this is helping anybody tonight we are not entitled to a certain standard of living I want to establish that yes God wants you to be happy yes God wants to be successful yes we want to be blessed but you are not entitled to that because God can decide what's teach and what house you living against whatever plans you have and you have to learn like Paul to say I have learned to deal with this because this is what God wants so I want us to see now your Ambitions and your plans have to be in alignment with God's will that is where the disconnect takes place it is futile for you to have ambition outside of the will of God now if you're ambition and that's why in all your ways acknowledge Him and He will direct your part he'll start to see how the dots connect because when you acknowledge Him and you seek his guidance and say Lord I only want what you want that is why Solomon could have been so blessed because he was seeking the wisdom of God he was seeking a mind of God to know how to live how to move how to act and God said that is what I want that's what really that's what I really want I want the heart that after my own heart a mind after my and I could bless you with anything because that is the principle thing not I'm a Christian I'm in a message I'm entitled into the Rapture so I'll go into the Rapture ho ho ho how are you doing it what are you working towards I want to challenge us to bring ourselves into a discipline of the word you are not entitled to your idea of the word you're not entitled to your interpretation of the word well I feel this is what it really means and I I don't like how that is said because that that that comes against what what somebody tell me people bring their entitlement of how they say the word you know and you will see through many of the Bible studies that we have done certain things that some people may have thought was a certain way when they see it through the word and say well wait a minute this is really what the scripture say and why it is said in that way anybody would meet you tonight I'm I'm almost done we are not entitled to the possession of others I was shared with my dad I said that is why horses run with blinders on because when a horse do have the blinders and he said to look at the other horses it's Madness going on so they put blinders so the singleness of focus to the finish line and I challenge you church and but over it was saying it on Sunday as well people carry Joyce with somebody else because they wish what a person had was their own so there's a kind of half Rejoice we're happy let's go happy Faith how we get that way is that a genuine it's not a truthful rejoicing no no it's a it's a kind of is that are happy and always I just want to be happier I would have been I'm happy for you but I want to be happier if I had it too so it's like degrees of Happiness so I'm happy but I want to be happier if we both got the car then we'll be total happiness we we won't we'll be really happy for each other and God is saying I am keeping you right where you at because I'm dealing with you differently so I want to challenge you that the word is the mirror that you want to be comparing to not anybody else anybody with me tonight I'm almost done you are not entitled to have in your any friend you want a coming out of young people now you're not entitled to choose Who Your Friends Are oh you thought it's your choice you're not entitled to marry who you want to marry uh-huh you thought it's your choice a lot of the things that people think they're entitled to they're not entitled to and they don't realize it because when you live by the world you realize witness I don't really have a choice about this do not be unequally yoked guys that deals with that situation you know you know what Abraham said under no circumstance I said a Believer Mario unbeliever uh-huh so what is your entitlement by the time we finish good on these roads friends it'll make you realize the moves that I thought I could make I already can't make enough anybody with me tonight I don't know if this is a little too much heat we are not entitled to our own interpretation of the truth you cannot this is not a buffet you cannot choose what you want out of the word and say well I believe I live in most this is the challenge when you meet somebody who doesn't have the revelation of the full word as a Christian artist Sigma gospel I I born again and and and anybody ever meet somebody like that little songs I sing good thing and and I born again I went to church two years ago and every year let's go and rededicate anything anybody ever meet anybody ever meet that and as far as that behavior is an entitlement that goes with it you know I was in a conversation a week ago I'm getting ready to close where somebody in the Pentecost I should say they find some preachers just make the requirements so high like you can't really go to heaven unless you do certain things I was like really [Laughter] you know you have to like change all your behaviors and change all your ways and you have to stop doing certain things so how you expect to go to heaven if it will change to be either because that behavior can't make it in heaven so I try to understand and to say and these preachers that want to be preaching as if as if all these behaviors like I love drinking can be too bad a lot you think and I say look hard and then but beyond that are coming out battle back to back to home back to home to these simple things because I was sharing it but over some time ago you know we would have gone through the story of nebot with Ahab and how Ahab looked at neighborhood property Vineyard and he gave him the offer he said I'll give you a better Vineyard or if you don't want another Vineyard I'll give any money to pay a fit and and and his anger I don't even remember the story ehar went home turned his face to the wall and then eat no food it wasn't his property and he gets so depressed he felt he was entitled to it he fell because of his position he was enticing and he felt that neighbor should have taken his offer so he was upset that neighbor didn't take the offer look that that's the case of entitlementer because if you don't feel entitled you should have no emotions but then you see entitlement is tied to comparison because he was looking at nearby privacy without that better looking like better than mine so I wanted it was also tight it covered him because he was coveted which means he wanted something he was coveted in his neighbor's property and they are scriptures in the New Testament that play that places coveted in the same category as adultery foreign every time you see him driving you just you can't deal with it and it you have to know your situation but then when God looks at it the same way you look at complaining you can say but I don't drink I don't smoke I in church but yeah they're complaining you're complaining they're complaining you're finding you're like you wake up baby then you're finding somebody what can I complain about today boy the roof all right let me complain about your roof your city roof your city roof you see the roof when you finish that day about the roof is you see the gates you see the gate you see the gate and God is in that attitude if somebody needs to be fixed fix it but don't complain about it if somebody could change changed it but complaining don't change anything and I want us to understand that this is something into certain behaviors people do already preach about these things and that's why citizens Bible study but I want us to understand when you look at and see how good chicken is most people never knew God judge them just for complaining people come to church they got seed they don't like two weeks later they still complain about a somebody get a bad Drive the whole rest of your drive it was it was a whatever bad Drive it's like every story stuck in Loop you're just repeating it you see that drive I fell out to be crazy and you go what manner of lives what manner of behavior ought me to be so I want to challenge us friends this Spirit of entitlement and I I pray that in some way it has been an encouragement to you the entitlement spiritual mentality is a threat to the contentment that Paul speaks about that comes with a relationship from God and trusting God to take care of you and your needs at a particular point in time you have to have trust in God yes there's actions you have to take but take it with prayer don't take it to all rush and you decide on what to do but take it with prayer and make sure at the end of the day you recognize that it's the grace of God to you is the grace of God to me it's the grace of God to us may the Lord bless us tonight can we just bow our heads if I would have prayed oh gracious Heavenly Father a simple Lord thought to just follow Sunday's message Lord and Lord to praying that in some way something would have been said tonight to help your people Lord to stay focused on the word and the impact of the world and their lives Lord and to see Lord how you looked at entitlement and complaining and all these things and it's so displeasure that with it father you brought judgment Lord you granted the desires of people and in it was judgment that is such a paradox to try the law to understand your thinking on the matter but to see how how you are so distilled when you have blessed us in so many ways and yet still we can't find words of gratitude to Thank You Lord help us to have a grateful heart help us to be thankful and appreciative and to lean to you father Lord as our sources our strength in all our ways to acknowledge you father Lord and to keep you first in what we do may you bless your people tonight too absolutely Faithfully come out here tonight and help us Lord to not take it for granted help us Lord to make our calling and election show May you bless each one will you bless our pastor in a special way and blessed Lord a Ministry that rallies around to give support and to share the burden the responsibility Lord may you bless everyone in this room tonight as we continue to press and strive to grow into that statue of a perfect man that was presented to us Lord through the prophetic Ministry of William Branham Lord as Lord we see the all the scriptures have their place and their their message and the importance to see your thoughts expressed to us even now from The Book of Numbers tonight let me you speak to us through your word and continue to deal with each one may you bless a service tomorrow night the prayer meeting on Friday and the service is coming Sunday May you be with your people in the precious name of Jesus Christ amen and amen and amen may the Lord Richard bless you tonight thank you so much God richly bless you
