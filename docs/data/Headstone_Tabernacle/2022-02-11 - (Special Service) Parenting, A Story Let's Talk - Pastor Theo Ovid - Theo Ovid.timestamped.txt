[15:02] here tonight may the virtue of christ
[15:04] flow to them
[15:06] in jesus name we ask it we
[15:07] recognize our frailty or dependency upon
[15:10] you and we confess that tonight father
[15:12] have you wait tonight
[15:14] in jesus name i ask it amen and amen who
[15:17] praise the lord i am
[15:19] god bless you i'm welcome i'm grateful
[15:22] all of you here tonight to be here
[15:24] and um tonight is a special service and
[15:28] what can i see i am i have something
[15:30] upon my heart i
[15:33] it is
[15:34] it's on parenting i want to touch
[15:36] something about parenting tonight
[15:38] parenting
[15:39] a story let's talk
[15:42] um
[15:43] so i am thankful for
[15:45] having this opportunity
[15:47] for this kind of session to talk
[15:49] different things that would help
[15:51] that would edify that would straighten
[15:54] us in some way
[15:56] and this is a very interesting topic
[15:58] because
[16:00] and i call it i didn't want to call it
[16:01] tips and and and so on like
[16:05] in that way for parenting but i wanted
[16:07] to something was striking me about
[16:10] parenting as a story
[16:12] that everybody have a story
[16:14] in reference to parents
[16:17] and even though you may be a child or a
[16:20] young person or teenager it still
[16:22] referenced you and i in some way whether
[16:24] you're old you're young you're single
[16:26] you're married you have no children it
[16:27] doesn't really matter
[16:29] because once you understood
[16:31] you are the product of a union between
[16:33] two people
[16:34] male
[16:35] and female
[16:36] so you have had parents half parents or
[16:39] you will become a parent
[16:41] but somewhere along the line
[16:43] it will be unfolded in your life so i'm
[16:45] hoping
[16:46] that something be said in this little
[16:49] session that will give you a i call it
[16:52] aha moment
[16:54] you know
[16:56] for some of us our parents are gone
[16:58] and we have memories of maybe they're
[17:01] being strict
[17:02] memories of their guidance or what they
[17:04] feel to do or what they did
[17:07] and sometimes we can't place it
[17:10] as we would like to
[17:11] because we accept them as they are or
[17:14] parents mother father
[17:17] or caregiver or stepfather whoever that
[17:20] stood there
[17:21] uh that had that care over your life
[17:24] but at some point in time we have to be
[17:26] able to look again
[17:28] at them
[17:30] at ourselves and what we will leave as a
[17:34] legacy
[17:35] for the next generation if there's to be
[17:37] a next generation
[17:39] this topic
[17:41] is vast
[17:43] and varied
[17:44] and there is no way it could be covered
[17:46] in one session
[17:49] and that's why
[17:50] i wanted to call it like a part e
[17:52] and that's why i kind of pull out a
[17:54] story
[17:56] because there will be other parts to
[17:57] this
[17:58] that i hope that the lord inspired me to
[18:01] bring to you
[18:02] and um i think that um
[18:05] you know this helps us
[18:07] get away from that religious covering
[18:09] and
[18:10] and understand we live in a real world
[18:13] where
[18:14] relationship comes
[18:16] where
[18:17] the
[18:18] the people who have influences in our
[18:20] early childhood
[18:22] it's it's influences over our lives
[18:25] and her guidance tears to where we are
[18:29] what we are and who we are
[18:31] so i trust tonight that this will really
[18:35] have something for everyone
[18:38] and um so let's talk i want to read a
[18:40] scripture from ephesians chapter 6
[18:43] there's one scripture read tonight
[18:44] ephesians 6
[18:45] verse 1-4
[18:47] i think i want to get captured this year
[18:50] from the scripture ephesians 6
[18:53] 1-4
[18:55] and it says children
[18:56] [Music]
[18:57] obey your parents in the lord
[19:00] for this is right
[19:02] honor thy father and mother
[19:05] which is the first commandment we
[19:06] promise
[19:08] reason verse 3 that it may be well with
[19:11] thee
[19:12] and thou mayest live long
[19:14] on the earth
[19:17] verse 4
[19:19] honey fathers
[19:20] provoke not your children to wrath
[19:23] but bring them up
[19:24] in the nurture
[19:26] and admonition of the lord let us pray
[19:29] again
[19:30] heavenly father i thank you for this
[19:31] scripture tonight and this word
[19:33] and this thought and this is something
[19:36] that
[19:37] i long to get delivered to the people
[19:40] and don't know how and i still don't
[19:42] know how it will be tonight but i
[19:44] commit this time into your hands and the
[19:46] few
[19:47] broken up words and thoughts and
[19:50] inspiration their hands that you would
[19:52] take it and and paint the picture that
[19:54] needs to be painted
[19:56] granted lord blessed tonight and jesus
[19:58] might ask it even
[20:01] this scripture or ephesians 6
[20:03] 1-4
[20:05] in the amplified just want to read in
[20:07] the amplified says children will be
[20:08] appearance in the lord
[20:10] as his representatives
[20:12] for this is justin right
[20:14] honor
[20:15] esteem
[20:17] and value as precious your father
[20:20] and your mother
[20:22] this is the first commandment with a
[20:24] promise
[20:25] that all may be well with you
[20:27] and that you may live long on the earth
[20:31] fathers
[20:32] do not irritate and provoke your
[20:35] children to anger
[20:36] do not exasperate them to resentment
[20:40] but rear them tenderly
[20:42] in the training
[20:45] and discipline
[20:47] and the council
[20:49] and admonition of the law
[20:52] so look at two things here
[20:54] one
[20:56] the first was with children
[20:58] this is the children looking up
[21:00] to the parents
[21:02] verse four with fathers
[21:04] this is like parents
[21:06] dealing with the children
[21:08] so you cannot separate it
[21:11] you cannot separate it is parents
[21:14] and children and this is what god has
[21:17] allowed and god has permitted for us to
[21:19] be
[21:20] partakers of
[21:22] all right
[21:24] the family
[21:27] the family
[21:28] is
[21:29] the most
[21:30] important
[21:32] influence
[21:34] in a child's life
[21:36] the family
[21:38] and children
[21:41] as children look forward to be raised
[21:44] being protected
[21:46] being provided
[21:48] and
[21:49] the mother father are the first teachers
[21:52] where the child began to
[21:54] nurture from grew from
[21:56] and
[21:57] the mother and father if there's such
[22:01] that
[22:01] they become the
[22:03] exemplars for that child
[22:08] so i trust tonight
[22:10] that everyone
[22:12] that will see something and what we're
[22:14] gonna share tonight
[22:15] grandparents parents
[22:17] unmarried if you have no children
[22:20] we are here
[22:22] we are all born
[22:24] between a product of a union between a
[22:26] man and a woman
[22:27] and whether we accept this or not
[22:30] we
[22:31] are shaped
[22:33] by who have raised us and how we have
[22:35] been raised
[22:37] we are product of
[22:39] human relationships
[22:41] and
[22:42] we spend our lives
[22:44] in the context of
[22:47] relating to other people
[22:49] so
[22:51] who we are
[22:53] what we are
[22:54] is a function of our connections
[22:58] and our relationships
[23:00] and the people we choose to surround
[23:02] ourselves with
[23:05] let me say that again
[23:07] who we are
[23:08] what we are is a product of
[23:11] our relationships
[23:14] and who we choose to surround ourselves
[23:17] with
[23:18] you know
[23:20] you are limited by your friends and your
[23:23] associates who you choose to associate
[23:25] with
[23:27] and over the years church
[23:30] church
[23:31] is an interesting
[23:33] place
[23:34] in terms of human connections and
[23:36] relationships it's very very interesting
[23:39] you can go on a job
[23:41] be it an engineering job
[23:43] there are jobs that you work with people
[23:45] at the contract there are jobs that they
[23:46] work with things like machinery and so
[23:48] on and you're limited by the expertise
[23:51] that around you that particular aspect
[23:53] but church is a different
[23:55] thing altogether church has
[23:57] people from different backgrounds
[23:58] settings
[23:59] scenarios experiences
[24:02] careers jobs qualifications
[24:05] and and come from different backgrounds
[24:06] and they all come together saying
[24:08] hallelujah praise god hearing the same
[24:11] gospel and same word
[24:12] and their lines are honed
[24:15] by different experiences
[24:17] in their own home environment
[24:19] i remember a particular brother's wife
[24:21] and family after service they would
[24:22] leave almost immediately
[24:24] why because he experienced some
[24:26] difficulty in some other church and you
[24:28] don't want to get any confusion
[24:30] so he doesn't mix with anybody as far as
[24:32] he concerned he comes to church
[24:34] he goes back home he limits
[24:36] that relationship
[24:38] and
[24:39] what
[24:40] that does or what he doesn't see
[24:43] is how that affects his children
[24:46] because the children needs that
[24:48] connection needs that friendship and
[24:50] relationship
[24:52] so sometimes our behavior
[24:54] as adults as parents
[24:56] affecting seen and unseen
[24:59] unknown
[25:00] so
[25:01] i hope that this challenges us
[25:04] to think different to be
[25:07] better and want to be better and to do
[25:09] better
[25:10] because there is no school of parent
[25:13] and that is why i want to introduce this
[25:16] talk on parenting let's talk as a story
[25:20] your story
[25:21] my story our story the individual story
[25:26] and i could give you an example henry
[25:28] and i we got
[25:29] marriage at the age of 21 and what do we
[25:32] know
[25:32] absolutely nothing
[25:36] nothing nothing about finance nothing
[25:38] about parenting nothing about racial
[25:39] children
[25:41] we literally ignorant
[25:44] yet
[25:45] after 40-plus years
[25:47] children
[25:48] grandchildren
[25:50] we know some stuff now
[25:52] we know some stuff that we could share
[25:54] and we can hope
[25:56] that our stumbling block will become
[25:58] your stepping stone
[26:00] that where we bounce our foot and hit
[26:02] our head
[26:04] um you don't have to
[26:06] it doesn't make sense we reinvent the
[26:08] wheel
[26:09] it doesn't make sense you get your hand
[26:11] and head bruised where we got it when we
[26:14] could tell you don't go there don't do
[26:16] that approach it this way that way and
[26:18] you get a heads up
[26:20] on life
[26:21] a thumbs up on life that gives you an
[26:24] edge
[26:25] to
[26:26] survive and depress and to move forward
[26:28] and i hope
[26:29] that this strikes you tonight
[26:32] okay
[26:33] now
[26:35] because
[26:38] we need relationships
[26:41] and life is about connections
[26:45] sometimes it becomes difficult to manage
[26:48] because there's no school of
[26:49] relationship
[26:51] even as there's no school of marriage
[26:54] there's no school of parents
[26:58] personally
[26:59] i believe
[27:00] certain things should be taught in
[27:02] schools and it's not
[27:04] you know chemistry mathematics and
[27:06] whatnot
[27:07] and like for church they no longer dress
[27:10] and wear a tie and come to church and
[27:12] worship a god anything like that but you
[27:13] see
[27:14] uh what we call
[27:16] uh this thing called life
[27:19] and how
[27:21] we could do better in how we live
[27:24] not just with ourselves but with others
[27:26] it is not taught
[27:28] so you're good you don't get this in
[27:29] school to say well a school of how to be
[27:32] the one of
[27:33] to be a great parent i want to be a
[27:35] great dad
[27:37] i want to be a great mother i don't just
[27:39] want to have track you know
[27:41] and i know i'll be jumping here and
[27:43] jumping there it has some mothers
[27:46] no offense to anybody here i'm not
[27:48] speaking with anybody in mind
[27:51] i personally love parenting
[27:55] i
[27:56] i i was i couldn't wait to be a parent i
[27:59] couldn't wait to be a father
[28:00] it was a real excitement for me and um
[28:04] personally i could say i enjoy this
[28:07] thing called parent
[28:08] one time i felt i could write a book on
[28:11] parents and i wanted to but
[28:13] it's just not has that material i enjoy
[28:15] it
[28:17] i know
[28:18] there are parents who
[28:20] did not enjoy it
[28:22] and there's a reason for that
[28:24] but i was blessed and and was helped i
[28:28] got to enjoy this thing called parenting
[28:30] because i see it as shaping lives
[28:33] shaping lives that would affect the
[28:34] world shaping lives that will affect
[28:37] communities that will affect another
[28:39] generation
[28:41] so
[28:42] it has these women who
[28:45] put it this way they don't
[28:47] have this maternal instinct they don't
[28:50] have this maternal thing
[28:53] the child
[28:54] is i'm just a mother not just i make a
[28:58] baby or they see the fathers who have a
[29:00] similar sort of thing let's call it
[29:02] child father
[29:03] or child mother not
[29:05] not this neutering caring concerned
[29:08] burdened
[29:10] a parenting overshadowing like oh god
[29:13] said can a mother forget a stop and say
[29:15] i know i cannot forget you you engrave
[29:17] in the palms of my hands
[29:19] we know god is the first parent
[29:22] he had his concerns
[29:24] he made preparation at gardner eden he
[29:26] placed man and his wife
[29:28] he told them to replenish
[29:31] you know just up to the earth
[29:33] multiply
[29:34] and that multiplication
[29:36] was to actually make
[29:39] a reproduction of themselves
[29:42] another adam
[29:43] another son
[29:45] so we're going to see that parenting
[29:47] really
[29:48] is to bring a child son or daughter
[29:51] into a place of maturity
[29:54] and independence
[29:56] where
[29:57] the parental influence is no longer
[30:00] needed
[30:02] now
[30:03] you might find me repeating this because
[30:05] i haven't sort of written type down and
[30:06] so on like that so i'm just saying freon
[30:08] right now
[30:09] but to me this is what
[30:12] parenting is all about
[30:14] and we find that
[30:16] some parents
[30:18] they feel
[30:20] or they don't catch
[30:22] that the children is unknown to them
[30:25] this is very important
[30:28] the children are not yours
[30:32] they are unknown
[30:35] we are stewards
[30:37] of these gifts of god that was placed
[30:39] into our hands as babies
[30:43] and
[30:44] the scripture we read
[30:46] we are called the reason and the fear
[30:48] and the admonition of god
[30:52] this is what it's about
[30:55] and
[30:57] i
[30:58] apologize if if i'm
[31:00] jumping here and jumping there
[31:02] because all what is a me is not in
[31:05] sequence i might be in a certain order
[31:09] so i'll be kind of hitting here and you
[31:11] know just jumping here as i said to you
[31:13] i have nobody in mind i'm not committed
[31:15] to knock anybody or hit anybody
[31:17] that is not the intention of this
[31:19] tonight
[31:20] this is to edify you
[31:23] and make you
[31:25] i hope you can get the aha moment to say
[31:27] well aha i could understand why my dad
[31:29] acted like that
[31:34] you know there's some people okay
[31:36] maybe
[31:37] you lost your mother or father
[31:40] and um
[31:41] and you miss them and you wish they were
[31:42] wrong
[31:43] but is that what parenting is about
[31:46] i don't think so
[31:48] i believe that
[31:50] you
[31:51] have to see yourself as getting this
[31:53] strength
[31:54] and maturity that you don't have to go
[31:57] backwards to say well you know if my
[31:58] mother was here my father was here then
[32:00] what
[32:02] because when you drill down deeper
[32:04] you ask yourself
[32:06] what did they know
[32:08] how did they do
[32:10] how did they feel
[32:12] it is unfair to put like a test exam
[32:15] to parenting
[32:17] because there is no one way to do that
[32:20] it has the helicopter appearance
[32:23] and i hope maybe we could talk a bit
[32:24] about that sometime the only hovering
[32:27] hovering like a helicopter over the
[32:28] children even when the children get
[32:30] married they're still over it they're
[32:32] hovering over and hovering like they
[32:34] called to just over over their child
[32:36] from birth
[32:37] to old man if i could use that
[32:40] it has the disciplinary anti-parent
[32:45] no much smiles
[32:46] but the belt is always nearby or the rod
[32:50] and the strictness is always fear
[32:52] it have the liberal type current
[32:55] you can do what you want you know i mean
[32:57] as long as you stay within bonds and so
[32:59] on like that
[33:01] and the liberal type like when the
[33:02] children get big enough to say they're
[33:04] on their own i remember one
[33:06] one mother said
[33:08] when somebody was interested in a
[33:09] daughter you say you're taking her at
[33:11] your own risk
[33:12] so
[33:13] her daughter was coming with a
[33:14] disclaimer
[33:16] and you know some parents happy to get
[33:19] the chair in all the house
[33:21] not because
[33:22] um is because they can't seem to manage
[33:26] so it's best that they go better they
[33:28] get married that's how they get a house
[33:29] and anything like that so i know i'm
[33:31] kind of jumping jumping here but we're
[33:32] going to get some tonight
[33:34] so i i'm hoping for the clarence that
[33:36] this really really
[33:39] edifies and helps in some ways
[33:42] free for me
[33:44] all right let's go
[33:46] okay
[33:48] so now
[33:51] as
[33:52] parents
[33:54] and we have older ones among us as then
[33:56] as we get older
[33:59] responsibility chefs with the children
[34:01] in handling
[34:03] the older parents
[34:05] and you know
[34:07] i remember
[34:09] and
[34:09] speaking to her sister say when unless
[34:11] you brought something for yourselves
[34:13] she has a lot of children and so on and
[34:14] she's here tonight you know i'm speaking
[34:16] about her for sure
[34:18] and she's a long time burning
[34:20] faster buy for children and i told her i
[34:23] said don't live for your children
[34:25] live for christ
[34:27] i see your children will get big
[34:29] and they will leave and go on their own
[34:31] i guess she watched me and made me watch
[34:32] the kind of strange
[34:34] because a lot of mothers
[34:36] other parents they do so much for their
[34:38] children
[34:39] sometimes they just not just too much
[34:42] they just do they just do too much they
[34:44] actually spoil their children
[34:46] some of them the children are smothered
[34:49] by love what the parents think is love
[34:51] it's not really love it's being
[34:52] smothered covered
[34:54] and the children
[34:56] don't grow in a balanced
[34:58] healthy
[35:00] way so
[35:03] for us who are getting older
[35:08] we have to
[35:09] begin to appreciate solitude
[35:12] appreciate the kind of silence
[35:14] appreciate the times where our own
[35:16] children
[35:17] would have dear family to see about
[35:20] their own interests to see about
[35:23] and they may not have time for
[35:25] mom and dad
[35:27] this is also part
[35:29] of life
[35:30] where our own children become busy with
[35:32] their own lives
[35:34] so we have to learn
[35:36] and grow to the understanding
[35:38] that it's not like we are no longer
[35:40] relevant
[35:42] but
[35:43] the same
[35:45] burden of responsibility no longer
[35:47] applies
[35:48] because your children now
[35:50] have their own responsibilities
[35:53] and that is where it shifts from parent
[35:55] to grandparents
[35:57] when you find yourself
[35:59] connecting with grandchildren
[36:03] okay
[36:05] so i have something that i
[36:07] have here right now
[36:10] so this thing called relationship
[36:14] it's not something that is strong on us
[36:17] something that we are gifted with
[36:20] is something that we see
[36:22] is something that we learn i
[36:24] was blessed and fortunate not to have
[36:26] complexes
[36:27] i i don't know i can't remember ever
[36:29] having like a complex conflict being the
[36:32] ninth child of a family of twelve
[36:35] i i heard my brothers talk about who my
[36:37] father preferred and whatnot and i don't
[36:38] know about that i can't even remember
[36:41] what i thought i was young and swollen
[36:43] and i can't remember about that
[36:45] preference and what my father loved my
[36:47] mother preferred or whatnot
[36:49] all i know i live
[36:50] i i i survived i i pressed i fought and
[36:54] everything else so
[36:55] you know it's something else when you're
[36:56] free from complexities
[36:58] because when you have complex
[37:01] and it's not dealt with
[37:03] it goes
[37:04] along with you
[37:06] and could affect you
[37:08] one thing i could see
[37:09] when i was
[37:10] young in primary school i got bit by a
[37:12] dog and after that dog and i wasn't very
[37:15] close
[37:30] no one of my friends andrew he has three
[37:31] doors i'll go by him actually to him as
[37:33] some dogs i get a reconnection back
[37:36] but i choose as a parent
[37:38] not to put my own
[37:42] mind problems on my children
[37:45] let them be able to sort out
[37:47] and deal with their own challenges and
[37:49] honestly why put
[37:51] my fears on them this is what
[37:54] parents do this is what some pastors do
[37:57] so with complexes
[37:59] you know it adds to the weight of this
[38:01] thing called parenting
[38:03] and relationships
[38:06] so
[38:07] that's
[38:08] there's so much things going through my
[38:09] mind i mean
[38:11] i'm hoping that that that it helps
[38:14] somebody in some way
[38:16] you know um
[38:17] so parenting is leadership
[38:20] that's how i see that
[38:22] real parenting is leadership
[38:25] to raise a child
[38:27] under the protection
[38:29] and security
[38:31] of love
[38:32] care
[38:34] support
[38:36] discipline
[38:37] neutering
[38:39] and mentorship
[38:40] to bring a child son or daughter to
[38:43] maturity
[38:44] independent
[38:46] of mother and father
[38:48] this part
[38:50] is important
[38:52] because if you appreciate
[38:54] that your sons and daughters and
[38:56] children alone to you or
[38:59] given to you
[39:01] as a stewardship
[39:03] then you have to understand
[39:06] some point in time you have to release
[39:07] them
[39:09] some parents
[39:11] don't release their children
[39:13] the children are permanent children
[39:16] and they are permanent
[39:19] parents in that sense
[39:21] and that is not scriptural that is not
[39:23] what it's supposed to be
[39:26] the
[39:26] object is every feature brings forth
[39:29] after it's kind
[39:31] if you look at a thick sucker tree
[39:34] sometime before
[39:35] the fig even beer or put forward
[39:39] figs
[39:40] you see two young suckers at this side
[39:43] it's almost as if nature's singing
[39:45] before you produce
[39:47] you have to have
[39:49] a next crop or next generation or next
[39:52] conde next connection that would come to
[39:55] the same maturity
[39:57] when they think come to maturity now you
[39:59] cut the bunch of fig off
[40:01] cut down the whole plant
[40:03] the others coming strong right up
[40:06] to show it's not done
[40:09] it's the reproduction of the original
[40:12] and this is the same principle in
[40:14] humankind
[40:16] that
[40:17] as humans
[40:19] are sons of god
[40:21] god wants us to produce other songs
[40:24] songs that come into maturity
[40:27] and i had it written down isn't this
[40:29] what ephesians is four is all about
[40:32] that we come to maturity one that we can
[40:35] sort be no more children toast to and
[40:37] fro
[40:38] so the object of this thing called
[40:40] parenting
[40:42] is to take this bundle of love in your
[40:44] hands
[40:45] eight inches long ten inches long one
[40:47] tongue two pongs or whatever
[40:49] and bring that up
[40:51] to such a maturity
[40:53] that the other part of the scripture
[40:54] could come into place
[40:56] for this cause
[40:58] shall a man
[40:59] leave
[41:00] his mother and father
[41:02] and cleave to his wife
[41:04] in other words it has to be
[41:07] that this thing called parenting
[41:10] brings us to that spot
[41:12] of bringing who god has placed in our
[41:14] care
[41:15] to bring them into such maturity that we
[41:18] are happy
[41:19] and pleased
[41:21] and blessed to see them get on their own
[41:24] stand on their own
[41:25] and serve in the lord or give the lord a
[41:27] hand to pray
[41:29] but this to me
[41:31] is what the gospel is all about
[41:33] to raise up seas of the righteous
[41:36] to bring people in the fear
[41:38] and the acknowledgement of god
[41:41] not to raise them religious
[41:43] no
[41:44] but to raise a meta understanding about
[41:47] all things that pertain to life
[41:50] and godliness
[41:51] oh blessed be the name of the lord
[41:55] parents
[41:57] read
[41:58] children
[42:01] parents raised bandits
[42:04] robbers
[42:06] teachers lawyers
[42:08] prophets priests king and all in between
[42:12] someone has rocked that baby
[42:15] someone has raised that child
[42:18] you can raise a child that affects the
[42:20] whole world
[42:22] or either child influences nothing at
[42:24] all
[42:25] that's
[42:26] part of the power of
[42:28] parenting
[42:30] they are good parents
[42:32] they are bad parents
[42:34] they are terrible parents
[42:36] they are disrespectful parents
[42:39] a disrespectful son or daughter
[42:41] would eventually become
[42:43] a disrespectful parent
[42:46] who would raise
[42:47] disrespectful children
[42:50] the chain of command
[42:53] starts with you
[42:55] what you are
[42:57] who you are
[42:59] and more importantly what have you
[43:01] become
[43:02] is what will influence
[43:04] your child or children
[43:08] some parents
[43:11] are comparative
[43:14] they are competitive and that
[43:16] competition goes on and pass on to into
[43:18] the children churn becomes competitive
[43:20] and that competitiveness
[43:23] it affects them in sharing
[43:25] sharing what they know
[43:27] sharing what they have
[43:29] in a long time
[43:30] i remember in the early days
[43:32] years ago before it had all this
[43:34] internet
[43:35] the big thing that was selling was um
[43:38] encyclopedia and
[43:41] if you have these bunches of pizzas like
[43:43] this will make it brainy and cabriniak
[43:45] and make it bright and everything else
[43:47] so people were peddling encyclopedia
[43:50] that tons of different types of
[43:51] encyclopedia all the books all the
[43:52] research
[43:55] but when the internet break
[43:57] and information as the bible talk about
[43:59] knowledge shall increase
[44:01] information is now on the floor
[44:03] information is known to type in
[44:06] any question could be answered
[44:08] it may not effect these big hard big
[44:11] books that people stuck up in the
[44:13] library and stuck about home and whatnot
[44:15] because the knowledge is here
[44:18] and friends
[44:19] what i'm sharing tonight is not anything
[44:21] new the knowledge is already here
[44:24] of life
[44:26] of parenting of of how to raise children
[44:28] and how to do better it says dear
[44:32] it is all there
[44:34] some parents live their lives to their
[44:36] children
[44:37] instead of seeing their children
[44:40] as a loan from god
[44:42] to see their children as an extension of
[44:44] their own ambition
[44:46] of what they did not achieve
[44:48] they
[44:49] are extremely proud of the children not
[44:52] just of the children's achievement
[44:55] but
[44:56] in some weird way
[44:58] they actually live their lives to their
[45:00] children that is why
[45:02] they stay over and over
[45:04] they always appear somewhere
[45:06] influencing everything possible they can
[45:09] and even to the point of being
[45:12] manipulative
[45:15] now
[45:19] there are three positions that you could
[45:21] be in right now
[45:24] you
[45:25] have had or have parents
[45:28] you are now a parent
[45:30] or you are going to be a parent
[45:32] so whatever position you're in you could
[45:34] look back and see the actions and
[45:37] decisions of your own parents
[45:39] if you're a parent now
[45:41] it depends upon what stage your children
[45:44] in his life your children could be very
[45:45] young maybe two years and under three
[45:47] years and under five years another your
[45:49] children may be a little older get an
[45:50] injury all in between
[45:53] 13 14 15
[45:55] your children could be much older
[45:57] in the 20s and so on there are questions
[46:01] what is this thing called parent
[46:04] why grandparents what do you do what do
[46:06] they do
[46:08] what can we learn from our parents
[46:11] or from
[46:12] parenting what
[46:15] things we should see
[46:17] what things
[46:18] we should not see
[46:20] what things should we do
[46:22] what things we should not do
[46:24] how can we improve
[46:27] are we parents forever
[46:30] is it that as our children gets more
[46:33] mature
[46:34] we become mentors
[46:38] and influencers
[46:40] into their lives i don't know
[46:43] one mother telling a daughter i could
[46:44] say what i want because i name you
[46:48] well of course that is
[46:50] i'll give you your name then i could i
[46:52] could you can't tell me anything
[46:54] and and that is not
[46:56] really
[46:57] the way
[47:00] and
[47:01] one of the things
[47:03] i do
[47:04] as a parent
[47:05] is at ten years to my children
[47:08] this one should come on that tip
[47:11] okay we'll call that tip
[47:13] what i should do
[47:14] when they are five
[47:16] i used to say next 10 years they'll be
[47:18] 15.
[47:20] and guess what i also did that in church
[47:23] so when i see a five-year-old
[47:26] a 10 year old
[47:27] i would think next 10 years they're
[47:29] going to be 20.
[47:30] what next
[47:32] no
[47:34] i
[47:35] didn't read that in a book or
[47:38] that's something that i personally do
[47:41] and enjoy doing
[47:42] adding years
[47:44] to give a visual
[47:46] as well
[47:47] they are going to be
[47:49] not where they are
[47:51] and where you see they're going to be
[47:54] you could make preparations
[47:56] you could treat them a certain way
[47:59] and you know i i can't ever remember
[48:02] disrespecting my children
[48:04] i can't ever remember you know
[48:08] negative with them
[48:10] i rebuke them correct them and whatever
[48:12] i have to do deal with them
[48:14] but the point about it is that i see and
[48:17] i try to see down the road and i want to
[48:19] encourage you
[48:20] to do that
[48:21] don't just look at 13
[48:23] they're 15
[48:25] they're 40
[48:26] ask yourself
[48:28] what happens
[48:29] next 10 years
[48:32] if you keep focusing on where they are
[48:36] it could affect to me and that is what i
[48:38] did
[48:39] it could affect
[48:41] how you deal with them in where you want
[48:43] them to be
[48:45] because of what you see in a hand
[48:47] you could help
[48:49] guide them
[48:50] and direct them
[48:52] this is what you can do for example i
[48:54] worked in government service for many
[48:56] years most of my life
[48:58] and i kind of purpose in my heart that
[49:00] my children must not work in government
[49:02] service
[49:04] i cannot tell them don't work in the
[49:06] commercials
[49:08] i'm not in empowered to do that
[49:10] but this is in my heart
[49:12] what i could do
[49:14] is bring guidance bring an influence
[49:16] that will
[49:18] move them away from that
[49:20] so i
[49:21] was able to
[49:22] say influence them in some of their
[49:24] subject choices like business economics
[49:28] and so on because i wanted to get them
[49:30] into business i saw
[49:32] uh sitting there like a certain
[49:34] documentary garments there was just
[49:35] the tax man the axe man
[49:37] and you just stuck there in a rut
[49:40] with nowhere to go
[49:42] so i told myself you see this i don't
[49:44] want my children this at all
[49:47] and i
[49:48] this was in my heart
[49:49] and it's hard to you now remember and i
[49:51] i learn things because i
[49:54] i remember trying to push push up
[49:56] brother in ambition
[49:58] and the brother thought i was harassing
[50:00] him no i i i tried to light fire on him
[50:05] because
[50:06] he was too laid back and slow
[50:09] and if you know anything about me i am
[50:11] not in this
[50:13] um
[50:14] slow march thing
[50:15] you know
[50:17] i believe in
[50:19] peace
[50:20] getting things done
[50:22] i believe in defiance and so
[50:24] so then i learned from that because he
[50:26] reacted negatively
[50:29] to
[50:30] me trying to push him
[50:32] now
[50:33] here's what i discover
[50:36] there are some people
[50:38] when you tell them something negative
[50:40] they react completely opposite to that
[50:44] now that's your children that you have
[50:46] and
[50:47] there are some now when you tell them
[50:48] something negative they take it negative
[50:51] and they freeze
[50:52] so if you know your children that's why
[50:54] i'm saying
[50:55] it's not
[50:57] one-size-fits-all
[50:58] parenting is a story
[51:01] because a lot depends upon the child
[51:04] i know there are certain children you
[51:06] tell them you cannot make it and they
[51:07] will prove to you that they can make
[51:10] you tell them they cannot do it they
[51:11] will succeed
[51:13] they actually respond
[51:16] with the negative
[51:17] inner positive
[51:19] under some children with the negative
[51:21] they actually respond negative they
[51:23] freeze they fall up they say that is
[51:25] whether you are dumb you are depressed
[51:27] and they hit that dog on the press you
[51:28] cannot tell that
[51:30] different strokes for different folks
[51:32] that's the reality that's why you cannot
[51:34] treat all the children the same you have
[51:35] to have the discernment of each child to
[51:38] deal with the child to be an effective
[51:41] carrot there are some parents
[51:44] the banana cut into tree you're
[51:46] treachery
[51:48] the pineapple cut into three everything
[51:49] is the same
[51:51] it doesn't work that way
[51:53] some may have appetite for the whole
[51:54] banana
[51:55] and some may not want the banana they
[51:57] might like orange so if you get that one
[52:00] get a whole banana and a whole orange
[52:03] you cutting these pieces up and share
[52:04] with everybody because all are your
[52:06] children
[52:07] god don't even deal up with his children
[52:09] jacob is one thing abraham is another
[52:11] thing noah is another character more
[52:13] than another character joshua another
[52:15] character god have different guys
[52:17] different men different ways and he
[52:19] deals with them differently
[52:21] just those of our children so i hope
[52:24] that you would see something from all of
[52:25] this tonight and it would help you
[52:28] re-look and review how you deal with
[52:30] things now
[52:32] so
[52:35] so parenting
[52:38] is to bring a child to maturity
[52:42] and independence
[52:44] and that job and we said the same again
[52:46] is about over
[52:47] when that individual
[52:49] no
[52:51] longer needs
[52:53] the oversight
[52:54] of parents
[52:57] i think i think my wife sometimes told
[52:59] me about some
[53:01] his parents were dentists and he wanted
[53:03] to be at them and he um
[53:05] and they wanted their son to be a
[53:07] dentist and he hated this dentist
[53:10] he hated it
[53:13] and um it was very unfortunate
[53:16] but
[53:17] he rented because of his parents
[53:20] and eventually
[53:21] he did something with somebody's teeth
[53:23] and mouth and got sued and end up in
[53:25] prison and whatnot but it was a terrible
[53:27] thing
[53:28] and this is parents now who want their
[53:30] will and dictates
[53:32] and career choices
[53:34] upon their children and determine what
[53:35] they will do and what they will not do
[53:37] that is not right that is not how it's
[53:40] supposed to be we have to be able to
[53:42] work with them
[53:43] and and and see how best to influence
[53:46] them correctly in serving the lord and
[53:49] and soviet god this is what this is
[53:51] about
[53:52] so therefore
[53:55] i want to bring some stories now
[53:58] i call it little snippets
[54:00] and i know they are much more than this
[54:03] but i i trust them that
[54:06] um
[54:08] you know your own story so these are
[54:10] some snippets and some stories
[54:11] i guess your parents wish they could
[54:13] have told you
[54:15] and i have this only compassion one of
[54:17] love
[54:19] my parents didn't show me love
[54:23] my mother
[54:26] my parents didn't
[54:28] show me love in my life
[54:31] i found out afterwards
[54:34] my mother wanted a girl
[54:36] but she got me instead
[54:39] i didn't see love from her
[54:42] now
[54:43] i'm seeing that
[54:45] now this is not near i'm not talking
[54:46] about this is not my experience it's not
[54:48] my i'm just telling you a story
[54:51] and
[54:54] it this story could vary in different
[54:56] ways
[54:59] and um
[55:00] but let me just continue here
[55:06] i didn't feel love from her
[55:08] but what if you heard your mother's
[55:10] story
[55:12] how she was abused
[55:14] how she never experienced the love you
[55:16] needed
[55:18] and the love you wanted
[55:21] and she
[55:23] find herself short
[55:25] and she didn't know what love really was
[55:29] so she couldn't give
[55:32] what she did not
[55:34] have
[55:37] you need to forgive your mother
[55:41] this is very very very important
[55:46] when you could look back
[55:49] and you could really
[55:51] and i have it under
[55:53] if your parents could speak back to you
[55:57] what would they say
[56:00] for example
[56:02] you ask your father or mother a question
[56:04] or your parents a question
[56:06] and there's no answer
[56:08] and you say but why
[56:11] and your parents say because i say so
[56:16] but what if they could explain to you
[56:19] that they said that because they
[56:21] themselves didn't know
[56:24] and when you think back
[56:27] oh aha
[56:29] they didn't know
[56:31] that is why they behave like that
[56:34] that is why they acted like that had
[56:37] they had known or
[56:39] or if they had the answer
[56:41] it would have been different
[56:44] that is true
[56:47] parents
[56:48] afterwards you realize
[56:50] is just like you
[56:53] boys and girls
[56:56] young people that got married
[56:59] and didn't have a compass
[57:02] didn't have a guide
[57:04] or didn't have a map
[57:07] and they did
[57:08] what they did to the best of the ability
[57:11] with the tools
[57:12] that they have
[57:14] so this is just an example
[57:17] and i know
[57:18] that there are many many examples
[57:21] the other one i want to talk about is
[57:22] communication
[57:25] and and this one is a live one
[57:27] this one is the one that
[57:29] a young
[57:31] man spoke to me about his father don't
[57:33] talk with him
[57:35] his father doesn't really talk to him
[57:38] and he's angry i'm very angry
[57:42] but he doesn't know his father's story
[57:45] his father's story
[57:47] is that his father father or this young
[57:50] man's grandfather
[57:51] didn't talk much
[57:53] because he dropped out of school
[57:56] did not have words or the confidence to
[57:58] communicate effectively
[58:01] that was passed on to his father
[58:04] and this is where
[58:06] i want to
[58:08] bring it to you
[58:11] that every parent have a story
[58:15] you may not know the story
[58:18] you may not know why some of the dads
[58:20] are so easygoing
[58:23] some of the mothers are so hard
[58:25] while some of the
[58:27] mothers
[58:28] are easy going on some of the dads i had
[58:31] you don't know
[58:33] what we could trust and this is for you
[58:36] is that they all try to do their best
[58:39] for their children
[58:40] i miss their complexes
[58:42] and mix their failures and miss their
[58:44] challenges
[58:46] because they are failures
[58:48] they are short comments they are
[58:50] challenges
[58:51] and they are with us every day
[58:54] but we stand as parents
[58:57] we stand looking back
[59:00] i remember
[59:03] i mean a day my father wanted to give me
[59:05] a haircut
[59:07] and
[59:08] i knew my father didn't have a barbecue
[59:11] my father was a tailor
[59:13] this season
[59:15] was like a taylor scissor and i know
[59:17] that
[59:18] he's not going to cut it
[59:21] i was in school during age and i
[59:24] climb up a tree a plum tree
[59:27] and tie my head
[59:28] with with a with a shirt
[59:31] and my father said come to get you here
[59:34] i wasn't coming i was there retreat but
[59:36] my father took a belt
[59:38] well because of those are you sure
[59:40] i got licks plus the haircut
[59:44] no
[59:45] when my father died
[59:47] 1981
[59:49] my son isaac was about one year old
[59:51] and i held on held him up
[59:54] looking at him and tears in my eyes
[59:57] and i'm going back in memory of my dad
[1:00:00] putting licks on me and disciplining me
[1:00:02] and i recognized
[1:00:04] that is love he loved me and he wanted
[1:00:06] me to go right
[1:00:08] at the time
[1:00:10] you know the bible talk about no
[1:00:11] [Music]
[1:00:12] discipline or chastisement
[1:00:15] is is this is happy or joyous or whatnot
[1:00:18] at the time
[1:00:20] i couldn't have seen it
[1:00:22] what i saw with my dad
[1:00:24] i never saw him hit my mother
[1:00:26] um he was always hard-working
[1:00:29] he got an accident and he broke his
[1:00:31] hands and
[1:00:32] i was the one that used to go to him to
[1:00:34] make market
[1:00:36] go every saturday and holy basket and he
[1:00:38] would buy the cucumbers and the tomatoes
[1:00:41] and everything else
[1:00:42] and through that i enjoy going to the
[1:00:44] market i enjoy choosing my stuff and so
[1:00:48] on that i still do
[1:00:50] and it is something that you can look
[1:00:51] back and see as examples
[1:00:53] and then the commitmental love
[1:00:56] the commitment of family
[1:00:58] and it's just something that is just
[1:01:01] part of what i believe and see and i
[1:01:03] know
[1:01:04] and would like to share
[1:01:06] this thing called parenting and um you
[1:01:10] know it's
[1:01:11] it's when you look and see
[1:01:13] that you are being given a
[1:01:15] responsibility to shape lives
[1:01:18] not just have children oh gosh
[1:01:20] this child can't stand it no more no not
[1:01:23] that
[1:01:24] to understand that they go through stuff
[1:01:28] like when my grandson's here i was
[1:01:30] talking to him a little bit he said
[1:01:31] grandpa i want to talk
[1:01:33] i want to speak
[1:01:35] i say okay
[1:01:36] are you six years old
[1:01:38] but he
[1:01:39] recognized
[1:01:41] that he had the confidence that he
[1:01:43] wanted to talk to us i have to listen to
[1:01:44] him
[1:01:45] the other day i know he was talking to
[1:01:47] him and telling him something and he
[1:01:48] said and we tell him how to do something
[1:01:50] he said grandma i have my own ideas
[1:01:53] no
[1:01:54] no what are you doing with that
[1:01:57] he's six years old and he in his
[1:01:59] creative juices already recognized that
[1:02:01] he could think and arrange and rearrange
[1:02:03] stuff
[1:02:04] so you recognize that
[1:02:07] there's a small man you have there
[1:02:10] you see the reality is this
[1:02:14] the little babies that is that baby you
[1:02:15] know
[1:02:18] i know anybody think that babysitting
[1:02:21] but
[1:02:22] but he beat me
[1:02:24] babies
[1:02:25] if you need that baby to get big without
[1:02:27] the feared motion of court
[1:02:30] that that little sweet little baby will
[1:02:32] become a big man sinner or daughter
[1:02:36] so we have to really be grateful to god
[1:02:38] and thank god for his grace
[1:02:40] and his love and his kindness to us that
[1:02:43] help us along livestream
[1:02:47] oh
[1:02:48] so
[1:02:50] you have to forgive your parents
[1:02:53] that is the only things that i find
[1:02:55] difficult because i recognize
[1:02:57] a lot of people stuck in complexes
[1:03:00] with at the parent level
[1:03:03] my stepfather didn't like me
[1:03:05] my mother was just
[1:03:08] my brother was this or whatever it is
[1:03:11] and you can't seem to let it go when you
[1:03:12] have to because it's affecting your life
[1:03:15] and um
[1:03:16] you know like this communication thing
[1:03:18] because the grandfather didn't talk to
[1:03:20] the father the father didn't talk to his
[1:03:21] son and then so here when i told this
[1:03:23] son
[1:03:25] i said okay
[1:03:26] i said your father is not communicative
[1:03:28] with you
[1:03:30] i said now what happens to the future
[1:03:33] i say you have to know
[1:03:36] what you will tell your children
[1:03:39] when your time comes
[1:03:42] now that young man wants to leave home
[1:03:44] because he finds the environment it's
[1:03:45] not good
[1:03:46] i said uh would you leave your job now
[1:03:48] said nope
[1:03:50] i said why you want to leave now i still
[1:03:52] still young i say what can you learn at
[1:03:53] your home i say what what are you
[1:03:56] running in life to leave home now for
[1:03:58] doesn't
[1:03:58] doesn't make any sense
[1:04:01] and you could see
[1:04:03] because
[1:04:04] we preach on us already freedom is our
[1:04:06] responsibility
[1:04:08] young people want to be free they find
[1:04:09] it
[1:04:10] the mother
[1:04:15] they want to be free some people can't
[1:04:17] wait to reach 18. i get 18 is a magic
[1:04:19] number i don't know what
[1:04:20] i think
[1:04:22] and after 18 is 19 then 20 and 21 then
[1:04:24] you wish you were 15. when you hit 2
[1:04:27] tissue your wish was 40.
[1:04:29] when you were 42 you wish there was no
[1:04:31] cruising at 16. i only reached 60 oh god
[1:04:34] i wish i was when i was young
[1:04:36] but the point about it is this
[1:04:39] that as you grow older you have more to
[1:04:41] learn not less
[1:04:43] and that is what just be a very
[1:04:45] strenuous thing
[1:04:47] one of the things though is when people
[1:04:49] don't admit and acknowledge where they
[1:04:51] are at
[1:04:52] when they don't acknowledge their faults
[1:04:54] their fears their mistakes
[1:04:56] from another young sincerity and she
[1:04:57] said but although i know i have anger
[1:05:00] issues
[1:05:01] and i was so pleased with that
[1:05:02] i was pleased that she recognizes that
[1:05:05] she has hunger issues
[1:05:07] but if you don't say
[1:05:08] you know
[1:05:10] you have a big
[1:05:12] monster inside the day called anger
[1:05:15] but you're smiling and you're doing like
[1:05:16] it's not it's there
[1:05:18] it's only a matter of time to come out
[1:05:19] but when you know it's clear
[1:05:21] we could pray with you we could pray for
[1:05:23] you you could pray for yourself you
[1:05:24] understand the way a challenge is that
[1:05:26] and you can get delicious
[1:05:28] but it has to start with you
[1:05:31] being able to acknowledge
[1:05:32] where you're at
[1:05:34] and
[1:05:35] so you have to forgive the parents
[1:05:37] and you parents
[1:05:39] there's a next part of this whole
[1:05:41] equation here now tonight
[1:05:43] you have to forgive yourself
[1:05:46] this part is very
[1:05:48] very
[1:05:49] very important
[1:05:50] just as
[1:05:52] you forgiven your parents and mother i
[1:05:54] remember my fellow
[1:05:56] father never give me a long pants not
[1:05:58] you i can't explain that
[1:06:00] all right he's still bitter he found
[1:06:01] that dead and going in
[1:06:11] but to that individual it means
[1:06:13] something
[1:06:15] and you know
[1:06:17] what may be like to you is not like to
[1:06:19] somebody else
[1:06:20] and we have to appreciate
[1:06:22] that everyone has a story
[1:06:25] and that's why i call it
[1:06:27] a story
[1:06:29] parenting as a story
[1:06:31] a story of life
[1:06:33] and
[1:06:34] we have the opportunity to share things
[1:06:36] that you could learn
[1:06:37] i know this is not a night that we
[1:06:40] remember tips or advice or counsel in
[1:06:42] that sense
[1:06:44] but just an exposure
[1:06:46] of this thing called parent
[1:06:48] and whether or not you could forgive
[1:06:50] your own parents for their failures what
[1:06:52] you think they should have done could
[1:06:53] have done
[1:06:54] and your own failures know as parents
[1:06:57] where we feel
[1:06:59] and we recognize you know what
[1:07:01] we could have done better
[1:07:02] i'm willing to learn
[1:07:04] because you still have an opportunity
[1:07:06] for the future
[1:07:08] to influence those who god has put in
[1:07:10] your care
[1:07:11] because
[1:07:13] you know i used to think
[1:07:15] as a young person
[1:07:17] that the older ones really know
[1:07:20] about age and life
[1:07:22] and as i get older i recognize
[1:07:26] when i was young so let's put it this
[1:07:28] way when i was still 25 or 26
[1:07:31] and i'm looking at somebody who is 64
[1:07:33] which is the age i'm going to be this
[1:07:34] year not this year i think they know so
[1:07:37] much and i recognize now that i'm this
[1:07:39] age they were very clueless
[1:07:42] they were absolutely clueless
[1:07:45] of this process called agent
[1:07:47] and their stage in life
[1:07:49] when my brother exclaimed how on earth
[1:07:52] did he get so old
[1:07:54] you know like all of a sudden because
[1:07:56] he's in the 70s right now i almost felt
[1:07:58] like a revelation
[1:07:59] hey hey what is this
[1:08:01] he just lived
[1:08:03] [Laughter]
[1:08:04] he just lived
[1:08:06] eat live laugh
[1:08:09] and the gray here just set in
[1:08:11] this is life
[1:08:13] and um
[1:08:15] so i i um
[1:08:17] i'm about done you know i know you might
[1:08:19] not think so
[1:08:20] [Laughter]
[1:08:22] i would done but i'm hoping that um
[1:08:26] that something said in this
[1:08:28] would help you see this picture
[1:08:30] and the reason i'm saying that you have
[1:08:32] to forgive yourself
[1:08:34] is because sometimes
[1:08:36] you feel so guilty of your own feelings
[1:08:39] and shortcomings
[1:08:40] but
[1:08:41] did you have the tools
[1:08:46] did you know
[1:08:48] were you taught
[1:08:50] were you train
[1:08:52] and you hear me at times i do believe
[1:08:55] half and half make a hole in terms of
[1:08:57] two people are halves and when they come
[1:09:00] together husband and wife they become a
[1:09:01] whole i believe two whole make a whole
[1:09:04] there are some people who need to be
[1:09:06] healed
[1:09:07] they need to become whole i just say
[1:09:09] will you be who
[1:09:11] they come into a relationship in a
[1:09:13] marriage thinking their wife will
[1:09:14] complete them
[1:09:15] or the husband will complete
[1:09:18] or this will happen when i get married
[1:09:21] you have to become whole now
[1:09:25] holding your spirit in your mind no man
[1:09:28] could heal you
[1:09:29] no woman could heal you
[1:09:31] your path
[1:09:33] your fears
[1:09:34] you have to
[1:09:36] deal with your own life
[1:09:38] deal with your own sins your own fears
[1:09:40] and stop blaming because blaming just
[1:09:44] hinders you
[1:09:45] blaming will keep you back
[1:09:47] i have nobody to blame
[1:09:49] stop blaming
[1:09:51] you may not out how you manage your son
[1:09:53] you made it out you know you manage your
[1:09:55] daughter you mean also how you manage
[1:09:57] things
[1:09:59] get back to work i'll even keel where
[1:10:02] you want help now
[1:10:04] you want tools
[1:10:06] you want a fresh word
[1:10:08] you want a fresh area
[1:10:11] and think
[1:10:12] that if you have an opportunity to share
[1:10:14] your failures shortcomings your faults
[1:10:17] your
[1:10:17] stepping stones your your grounding and
[1:10:20] so on that you would have somebody get
[1:10:22] you in a position to help somebody
[1:10:24] so i'm going to wrap up
[1:10:27] so
[1:10:28] parents
[1:10:30] forgive yourself
[1:10:32] stop blaming yourself
[1:10:34] there was no school of parenting
[1:10:37] you tried
[1:10:39] and did the best that you know
[1:10:40] for your children
[1:10:42] so inclusion
[1:10:45] parenting is a process
[1:10:48] of
[1:10:49] really preparing your trial
[1:10:51] for independence
[1:10:54] not
[1:10:56] dependent
[1:10:59] okay
[1:11:01] so therefore
[1:11:03] one thing that i found was very
[1:11:04] interesting
[1:11:06] in dealing with the child and the child
[1:11:08] rebellion
[1:11:10] and the child's attitude
[1:11:12] is using when
[1:11:15] as opposed to if
[1:11:17] so letting the child know not if you do
[1:11:20] this then i will do this
[1:11:22] but putting it on the child
[1:11:25] when you're washing wears
[1:11:27] then you're gonna get this
[1:11:28] when you clean your room
[1:11:30] then not if
[1:11:32] but when
[1:11:33] and that brings it right and them
[1:11:36] to make a decision of their own action
[1:11:39] in response
[1:11:41] to you giving them discipline
[1:11:43] not if you do this
[1:11:45] you're gonna get this but when you're
[1:11:47] gonna do this
[1:11:49] so
[1:11:50] inclusive
[1:11:52] back to the scriptures fathers
[1:11:55] do not irritate
[1:11:57] and provoke your treatment to anger
[1:11:59] why would paul say that
[1:12:01] it means
[1:12:03] he is also saying
[1:12:05] that fathers can irritate
[1:12:07] can provoke
[1:12:09] can prove that the anger and resentment
[1:12:13] they could do that
[1:12:15] but read them tenderly
[1:12:17] in training
[1:12:18] and discipline
[1:12:20] and counsel and admission of the lord
[1:12:24] i have seen
[1:12:26] young
[1:12:27] girls
[1:12:29] with when i say young maybe six seven
[1:12:31] years ago going to school
[1:12:33] with dresses almost to the uncle
[1:12:36] and not even him not right
[1:12:40] and i see them and i know any message
[1:12:43] i don't know who children they are
[1:12:45] but i see the children
[1:12:47] and
[1:12:48] i tell myself
[1:12:50] that if that parent don't look closer
[1:12:53] what they are doing and how they are
[1:12:55] doing it
[1:12:56] they may eventually get that child to
[1:12:58] resent this very message
[1:13:00] because putting a long dress on a child
[1:13:03] doesn't make them a christian
[1:13:05] this christ is going to make him a
[1:13:06] christian
[1:13:08] and that christ has to start with you
[1:13:10] as the parent
[1:13:12] if today or tonight
[1:13:15] you have never considered your life
[1:13:18] being a direct influence over your
[1:13:20] children i want to challenge you that
[1:13:22] tonight
[1:13:23] for example
[1:13:25] if in listening to wednesday night
[1:13:27] service
[1:13:28] you in and out and you just no you're
[1:13:30] not serious about where you're taking in
[1:13:32] the world
[1:13:34] and your children are wrong
[1:13:36] they will see that
[1:13:40] and you may not
[1:13:41] take notice of it the effect that has on
[1:13:44] them but they could do the same also
[1:13:49] if you can get the service and you don't
[1:13:52] and you still on a sunday when you
[1:13:54] should be in service on a sunday
[1:13:56] then that
[1:13:58] you're not seeing your children
[1:14:00] how they view that
[1:14:02] how they see that
[1:14:04] many of us live our lives for ourselves
[1:14:08] and that is why the children loses out
[1:14:10] because we fighting for
[1:14:12] love fighting for recognition fighting
[1:14:15] for acknowledgement heightens your
[1:14:16] respect
[1:14:18] and we are dear in this
[1:14:20] world of life
[1:14:22] fighting
[1:14:24] and not recognizing in our hands
[1:14:27] have lies
[1:14:29] like a clean fleet
[1:14:31] to be written on
[1:14:33] lies like potty
[1:14:36] that can be molded
[1:14:38] shaped
[1:14:39] and guided
[1:14:41] if the 90 never saw yourself in that
[1:14:43] position of leadership
[1:14:45] by example
[1:14:47] i want you to see yourself like that way
[1:14:49] tonight
[1:14:51] not just as father
[1:14:53] but as a leader
[1:14:56] how do you lead
[1:14:58] in your home
[1:15:00] not talk
[1:15:02] not full rank
[1:15:05] but lead
[1:15:07] leading by example
[1:15:10] leading
[1:15:11] where you
[1:15:12] step forward to show how it is to be
[1:15:14] done
[1:15:15] let us bowl heads
[1:15:17] forward the press tonight
[1:15:19] heavenly father i thank you tonight this
[1:15:21] is
[1:15:23] full service kind and i was
[1:15:26] i felt a bit short of presenting this
[1:15:29] but lord i i asked for your help
[1:15:32] and i trust them that in all its
[1:15:35] brokenness that
[1:15:37] a picture will be painted to your people
[1:15:39] tonight
[1:15:41] of your love towards us and your care
[1:15:43] towards us
[1:15:44] when we were in sin
[1:15:47] you you died for us and you you
[1:15:49] expressed your love for us and you save
[1:15:51] us still
[1:15:53] and yet
[1:15:54] when our children in sin we have so much
[1:15:57] attitudes and
[1:15:59] and thinking and negatives and
[1:16:00] everything else
[1:16:02] and you're just testing us many a
[1:16:05] father times
[1:16:05] are many parents here tonight
[1:16:08] and maybe some that may be able to hear
[1:16:10] the thing
[1:16:11] they would be able to switch their own
[1:16:12] hearts
[1:16:14] they don't even know
[1:16:16] by
[1:16:17] silencing their
[1:16:18] children by
[1:16:21] covering up for their children and
[1:16:22] having a covenant with their children
[1:16:24] hiding sin hiding all kind of stuff
[1:16:27] because they don't want to get the wrong
[1:16:29] picture and they
[1:16:30] feel that they're in charge going to
[1:16:32] realize they are destroying lives
[1:16:36] god i'm concerned not just about them as
[1:16:39] parents
[1:16:40] but about the next generation
[1:16:42] how are they going to relate
[1:16:44] how are they going to communicate
[1:16:46] when mother or father
[1:16:48] silence the children
[1:16:50] when they don't have access to counsel
[1:16:53] and guidance
[1:16:55] when they wouldn't say a word
[1:16:57] and things are going struggling within
[1:16:59] their marriage and everything else and
[1:17:01] their ministries and their helps and
[1:17:03] their support and we could share and
[1:17:06] pull one another up
[1:17:08] but there's nothing a word everything is
[1:17:10] silent and covered up
[1:17:11] how could they get the help that they
[1:17:13] need
[1:17:14] father here it is that through this
[1:17:16] pandemic
[1:17:17] you have led us with zumbra meeting on a
[1:17:19] friday and now with special services and
[1:17:22] we could take special topics like we
[1:17:23] took parenting tonight just to bring us
[1:17:25] a story and there there are many stories
[1:17:27] we could have pulled out i just took one
[1:17:29] or two
[1:17:30] and i know that those who are hearing
[1:17:33] tonight would have their own story
[1:17:35] when they were angry with parents
[1:17:37] their own failures as parents
[1:17:40] i know the next generations are wrong
[1:17:43] the babies hanging around lord and
[1:17:45] they are wondering how they're going to
[1:17:46] do and how they're going to make them
[1:17:49] like sometimes i'll go farther talking
[1:17:51] about or the bible is like the older
[1:17:53] woman teach the young women how to love
[1:17:54] their husbands
[1:17:56] but if the older woman don't even know
[1:17:58] how could they teach a young woman
[1:18:00] we need help lord
[1:18:02] we need your help
[1:18:04] we need your intervention it's a little
[1:18:07] more than just i'm in church or i'm in a
[1:18:09] message
[1:18:10] you said i come
[1:18:12] that you may have life
[1:18:14] and have it more abundantly
[1:18:16] father may you charge these people here
[1:18:18] tonight
[1:18:20] for this abundant life
[1:18:22] not existence

[1:18:34] to share with them
[1:18:35] the stories of parents
[1:18:37] parents some succeed some has failed
