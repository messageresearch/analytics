[0:47] presence of your power here tonight I
[0:49] have the preeminence as Lord and as we
[0:51] approach your word tonight may give us
[0:53] insight they give us inspiration inspire
[0:56] every heart here and give them great
[0:58] comfort tonight that you are true that
[1:00] you are faithful that you would confirm
[1:03] and backup your word granted Lord in
[1:05] Jesus and we ask it we thank you for all
[1:07] who make it out tonight all to the
[1:08] traffic all to the condition but they
[1:11] are here and we are here in your
[1:12] presence speak to us Lord just one word
[1:15] from you just one word tonight then
[1:18] Jesus and we ask it amen and amen god
[1:21] bless you
[1:22] we have some prayer requests we'll take
[1:24] out the energy service but we have three
[1:26] portion of Scripture as we like to
[1:27] approach tonight from Joshua top the
[1:29] tree
[1:30] we want to read verse one to find
[1:32] sentence up to 12 those 20 to 24 and he
[1:36] wished up to 4 2011 they're just three
[1:40] portions of scriptures tonight reading
[1:45] from Joshua chapter 3 reading from verse
[1:48] 1 and Joshua rose early in the morning
[1:50] they removed from shittim and came to
[1:52] Jordan he and all the chin of Israel and
[1:54] Lodge there before the Passover in the
[1:57] past after treaties that the officers
[1:59] went to the hosts and commanded the
[2:02] people saying when you see the Ark of
[2:04] the Covenant of the Lord your God and
[2:06] the priests and the Levites there in it
[2:08] then he shall remove from your place and
[2:11] go after it yet there shall be a space
[2:14] between you on it about two thousand
[2:16] cubits by measure come not near into it
[2:19] that he may know the way by which in my
[2:22] school for you have not passed this way
[2:25] heretofore and Joshua said unto the
[2:28] people sanctify yourselves for tomorrow
[2:31] the Lord will do wonders among us
[2:34] so in John chapter 12 we know from verse
[2:37] 20 and it was hidden Greeks among them
[2:40] that came up to worship at the feast the
[2:42] same came therefore to Philip which was
[2:44] of the Caesar of Galilee and he saw him
[2:46] saying so we would see Jesus and Philip
[2:48] commit until it Andrew and Andrew and
[2:51] Philip tell Jesus and jesus answered
[2:54] them saying they always come but the son
[2:57] of man should be glorified verily verily
[3:00] I say unto you except a corn of wheat
[3:01] fall into the ground and die it abideth
[3:04] own but if it die it bringeth forth much
[3:07] fruit
[3:09] our last scriptures of Hebrews and
[3:11] that's was from Hebrews from verse
[3:14] chapter 4 verse 1 let us therefore fear
[3:20] Lisa promise being left us of entering
[3:22] into his rest any of you should come
[3:25] short of it for unto us was the gospel
[3:27] preached as well as unto them but the
[3:30] word preached did not profit them not
[3:32] being mixed with faith in them that hid
[3:34] it for we which have believed do enter
[3:37] into rest as he said I've sworn in my
[3:40] wrath if they shall enter into my rest
[3:42] although the works were finished from
[3:44] the foundation of the world for he spake
[3:46] in a certain place on the seventh day on
[3:48] this wise and God did rest the seventh
[3:51] day from all his works and in this place
[3:53] again he said they shall enter into
[3:54] Myra's see and therefore it remaineth at
[3:57] some may enter there in that day to whom
[4:00] it was first preached entered not in
[4:02] because of unbelief again eliminated a
[4:06] sitting day seen and David today after
[4:08] so long a time as it is said today if
[4:12] you will hear his voice harden not your
[4:13] hearts for if Jesus had given them rest
[4:16] then should he not have afterward have
[4:19] spoken of another day there a minute
[4:22] there for a rest to the people of God
[4:23] for he that has entered into his rest he
[4:27] also has ceased from his own works as
[4:29] God did from his let us labor therefore
[4:32] to enter into that rest
[4:35] least any man fall after the same
[4:38] example of unbelief
[4:39] let us pray one more time father we
[4:41] thank you for the scriptures and father
[4:43] you say all Scripture is given for
[4:46] anything
[4:46] for instructions for rebuke for guidance
[4:49] guidance tonight by your light by your
[4:52] love by your word in Jesus name bless it
[4:55] to our hearts amen and amen
[4:56] you may be seated oh praise God you love
[4:59] him tonight oh praise be to you so glad
[5:02] for you all to be out here tonight
[5:03] welcome tonight have a title I think is
[5:09] the fullest I'm using one word as the
[5:11] title just one word and that word is
[5:13] process that word is process as one
[5:17] would process and process means a series
[5:22] of actions or steps taken in order to
[5:26] achieve a particular end that's what the
[5:29] word process means actions steps process
[5:36] hallelujah from a worm to butterfly
[5:39] that's the process from similar to Saint
[5:43] that's the process from jacob jake'
[5:47] grease to drill perfection that's the
[5:48] process
[5:49] this is Berta Branagh chorus of Wesley
[5:52] with sonification second message of the
[5:54] work of Greece it was a wonderful thing
[5:56] but after Wesley and Asbury the
[5:58] organizer died now in the midst of this
[6:01] then the Pentecost was a restoration of
[6:02] the gifts in the mists of all this gold
[6:05] is still calling a remnant out of every
[6:07] one of those generations and it's our
[6:10] time of coming out our gathering
[6:12] together and the gospel businessman has
[6:15] played a great part in bringing down the
[6:17] breaking down these walls there's no
[6:19] difference in us let us come together
[6:20] and worship God under one principle not
[6:25] under an organization if it was an
[6:29] organization I get off this platform
[6:31] right now I will have nothing to do with
[6:33] it
[6:34] what is it it's got to be a fellowship
[6:38] not a fellowship of some Creed but a
[6:41] fellowship in Christ by the power of his
[6:44] resurrection and that's the thing that
[6:46] brings life it brings birth and before
[6:50] bird can come we realize there has to be
[6:52] a debt before boot and a boot is a mess
[6:55] and okay what kind of blood it is is a
[6:57] big panel it's a mess
[6:59] so is the new billet it makes you do
[7:02] things that ordinarily you wouldn't
[7:03] think you will do but when you're ready
[7:05] to die to yourself then you are born
[7:08] again a new creature in Christ Jesus
[7:10] then the things open up and life becomes
[7:12] a new sight to you because you have
[7:15] accepted the person of Jesus Christ or
[7:17] even to the written word it's got to be
[7:20] quickened by the Holy Spirit even the
[7:23] text even the word is being read even
[7:26] the word being spoken
[7:27] it's got to be quickened by the Holy
[7:28] Spirit then he said no matter how much
[7:31] theology your gut is laying there dead I
[7:33] could have a handful of wheat until it
[7:36] gets into the process to where it can be
[7:39] quickened the we shall never live Oh
[7:42] glory to God
[7:44] genuine wheat have to come into the
[7:46] process where it could be quickened and
[7:48] you can have the doctor's degree but
[7:51] until the Holy Spirit comes upon that
[7:53] and quickens it to you as a personal
[7:56] experience with God then the wheat does
[7:59] no good he said your linen is in vain or
[8:03] glory the court so what you need is a
[8:05] quickening power and man don't have that
[8:08] that belongs to God go and have that so
[8:11] when you recognize your needy you are
[8:13] dependent your humbling yourself because
[8:16] you want him to quick and this thing to
[8:18] you or glory to God from you must move
[8:21] born again he said your approach to this
[8:23] boot there's not approach to it there's
[8:25] what there's an approach to it approach
[8:29] this book you've got to go to a process
[8:31] just like anything that lives in our
[8:34] lives again gotta die first and you
[8:37] cannot keep your same spirit or glory
[8:40] the ball very hard for you last for you
[8:42] can't keep your same spirit your vex for
[8:44] this one you're angry this what you
[8:45] can't keep us in spirit you upset for
[8:47] this one you upset but you can't keep
[8:48] that your national spirit when we have
[8:51] trained us for every country spirit to
[8:53] your marvelous forgive me our own spirit
[8:55] your ARIMA spirit wherever spread where
[8:57] my spirit whatever condition or your
[8:59] family spirit you can't keep that when
[9:02] my family so on my family so you can't
[9:04] keep back you have to come into the Holy
[9:05] Spirit they have loved me but family
[9:07] there's a little bit country
[9:09] that I wrote your background will come
[9:11] from doesn't you have to keep it there
[9:14] is an approach to it and you have to
[9:16] know God no need that because I'll be
[9:18] saying sundar when you died that breaks
[9:20] up any home hallelujah glory to God he
[9:24] said you cannot keep your same habits so
[9:29] you spirit up the change you have it
[9:31] after change and another one you cannot
[9:33] keep your same thoughts that means every
[9:38] different things you have to get new
[9:40] people to talk with and fellowship with
[9:41] because I can keep the same thoughts
[9:43] that can work you cannot you got to die
[9:47] you've got to die like he died you got
[9:49] to die on his Altera
[9:51] like a bell didn't put Islam you've got
[9:53] to die with your lamb
[9:55] you've got to die and died your own
[9:57] thinking to be born into his thinking so
[10:00] damn your blood cut taking your vex and
[10:02] you want the street on this one and
[10:03] speak by this one you oughta tell back
[10:05] this one that you that's not that that
[10:09] is hard
[10:10] hallelujah oh praise God yes to be born
[10:14] again you must go through a process of
[10:16] debt everything does you take the
[10:18] greener wheat if the corn ever expects
[10:20] to live again he's got to die first
[10:22] if the green or wheat ever expected
[10:23] living in the corner wheat the flower
[10:25] the tree the grass everything must die
[10:27] again how you will they escape it you
[10:31] have to go to the process and every one
[10:34] of you going to something everybody are
[10:37] going to something hallelujah and
[10:39] accorded how to you process listen
[10:42] carefully I call it the whole you
[10:43] process what you're going through you'll
[10:45] get the results if you're fine is not
[10:48] justified what you're going through
[10:50] yogev expect God you will get next which
[10:51] is this one you will blame this one and
[10:53] bring that one because you find it
[10:54] shouldn't be so but if you look at
[10:57] Romans 8:28
[10:58] I know all things not some things even
[11:03] the traffic tonight even how hard it was
[11:05] to get here tonight all things work
[11:07] together for good to them that love God
[11:11] to them who in ours
[11:13] yoga with you willing to allow God to
[11:15] send you to the process hallelujah no
[11:19] adoption is a Kenan doesn't represent
[11:21] the mill
[11:22] millennium it only represent the age of
[11:24] the overcomer the dispensation of
[11:27] overcoming because in Canaan and the
[11:29] kill and Boonen took cities or glory to
[11:32] God isn't that right
[11:33] so in this land we talking about it
[11:35] upsets it have don't sense it of hills
[11:37] it have mounted the valley it have
[11:39] mistakes it have bombs it's a broken
[11:41] hand broken foot that walk and a
[11:42] condition but one thing for sure is your
[11:45] land
[11:47] Alleluia nor Philistines the tides abuse
[11:50] I could run you out of your own land
[11:52] sorry you come to take over what they
[11:54] have because they were squatters on it
[11:56] you meet demons on that plan you know
[11:59] that la was my empty languor give you
[12:01] that line of problems that time of
[12:04] conditions but that is the process quote
[12:06] put he say wouldn't get the land all who
[12:09] all together in one shot he said but
[12:11] little by little he understood the
[12:14] process to inherit this glorious land is
[12:17] occurring all the land way and then the
[12:19] grass I hope it can maintain it but you
[12:22] know a panther alone here you have some
[12:24] chickens here you have some time in here
[12:27] and there's a game drawing you're trying
[12:29] to get more unless you came groaning
[12:31] you're like God will give you more you
[12:33] have to maintain once again I like that
[12:35] you maintain watch again and God will
[12:39] give you more again or get the Lord
[12:42] Ashok maintain watch again that's again
[12:51] impersonal unto game it you have to say
[12:54] this is mines you have to cut your
[12:56] counseling what is not yours
[12:57] hallelujah think about it now so God
[13:00] have to give you a revelation of your
[13:02] possession
[13:03] joy is yours this is yours
[13:06] the deliverance is yours make sure it's
[13:08] yours holy versus yours your family
[13:11] that's just true breakthrough that's
[13:13] yours too
[13:14] revival that's yours to healing that is
[13:16] yours you have to know a result and
[13:18] begin the climate
[13:22] if you never claimed not instead I came
[13:24] tonight see from the night is my night I
[13:26] said in the claim because the Holy
[13:28] Spirit only in the sea based upon your
[13:29] claims if they claim nothing you get
[13:31] nothing
[13:32] that's why the Bible said when you pray
[13:34] come on now believe you have received
[13:37] and you shall receive
[13:39] hallelujah yes I believe you believe you
[13:42] have it and you will have it believe it
[13:44] Catherine before you get it and you
[13:46] shall get it that is faith back
[13:49] hallelujah mmm and we believe that now
[13:51] we know the promise in the New Testament
[13:53] and the Old Testament is the Holy Spirit
[13:54] we know that already we preach that we
[13:57] see that now that the promise is the
[13:59] promise of the Father is the holy sprit
[14:01] is none right now you notice Joshua
[14:04] before they cross Jordan
[14:05] Joshua say go to the mists of the camp
[14:07] and clean your clothes and sanctify
[14:10] every one of you let no man come at his
[14:12] rifle written three days you will see
[14:14] the glory of God it is a process of
[14:17] getting ready to inherit the promise so
[14:20] if you are not willing to go through the
[14:22] process you haven't think Sunday that
[14:24] God looks at the heart
[14:25] this is not right God came and anoint
[14:27] David to be king isn't that right David
[14:29] the shepherd boy was anointed be King
[14:31] when he can feel led to go up there solo
[14:33] since all I come from your throne they
[14:35] kill him he can't do that he had a
[14:39] weight he had to go back and see what
[14:41] the Sheep because he had to go to a
[14:43] process because even though he was
[14:45] anointed
[14:46] he was already at or chlorine
[14:48] approaching you should be anointed but
[14:50] you already yet you have to go to PR OC
[14:53] es s a process or chlorine occur before
[14:57] you sit on that throne and you know
[15:00] David went to hell they were hiding the
[15:02] kids he ever had to play mad
[15:05] leave another runaway develops fears but
[15:08] he was still king or throwing up because
[15:12] he was chosen of God or not because they
[15:15] go to a rough time not because you're
[15:17] running for your life you are not chosen
[15:19] you are not annoyed don't believe that
[15:26] it's a process of getting ready to
[15:30] inherit the promise
[15:32] there's three stages of the journey is
[15:35] not right coming out of Egypt orphan of
[15:37] the blood sanctifying and that
[15:39] significant part is when you become a
[15:41] pilgrim and I'll show China hope you got
[15:45] your second arrest on the virus and
[15:47] leave at the Entente stressed Oh Gloria
[15:49] have a restless night you have no
[15:52] previous traveling God set it up that
[15:54] way because he wrestles the end of the
[15:56] game and the rest is charity so he gave
[15:59] it to labor Oh clearly a revelation to
[16:03] labor Oh Chloe don't worry he'll ever to
[16:06] enter into that rest or chlorine ago the
[16:09] race is the love of God say a wrestling
[16:12] mat feet the rest limit virtual
[16:14] knowledge temperance temperance yes
[16:18] that's controller that is self control I
[16:22] don't understand sex demon is almost
[16:25] control you have there is something
[16:27] called temperance the temperance of
[16:29] Jesus Christ or give the Lord a show
[16:32] Loreena blood there's a power to
[16:35] overcome all them things lust of the
[16:37] eyes lust of the flesh the pride of life
[16:40] who can give God give you power when you
[16:43] do not pull over yourself or give the
[16:45] Lord a show so all these virtues here
[16:48] it's a high get man in subjection to the
[16:51] word itself
[16:53] virtually a weakness knowledge only
[16:56] ignorance and branch over your looseness
[16:58] or k the Lord has choked in the house
[17:00] this is love your temperance
[17:02] this is his temperance this is his
[17:05] patience this is his communist this is
[17:08] his bodily Titus this is the process
[17:14] Oh glory to God hallelujah hallelujah
[17:18] hallelujah glory glory to God
[17:23] so people Steve stopping on the journey
[17:26] they stopped my justification they
[17:28] stopped identification but there's a
[17:30] promise of the Holy Ghost we can stop no
[17:34] we can stop with the song we can stop
[17:37] with a nice church we can stop an
[17:39] illness and Deacon Untersee we can stop
[17:41] with that we have to go on in this
[17:44] process to process the inheritance that
[17:48] God give us or cattle or - oh we
[17:51] couldn't confirm the promise in the
[17:53] wilderness because the witness was not
[17:54] inheritance the journey is not

[17:59] the process is make a true difference or

[31:05] the mechanics ready get our hearts right
[31:09] the things that we can do oh you mean
[31:13] the process is part the things that we
[31:17] can do yes God can't go and clean up you
[31:20] learn for you
[31:21] he said the land is yours and I'm Anna
[31:23] waiting so lord could you drop down so

[32:01] she was 20th century prophet on this

[32:13] you will be in this message will be the
[32:15] message you'd know it Stassi at the Lord
[32:17] you have your updates you have the
[32:18] tongued is your struggle and so on but
[32:21] you have manner but when you cross over
[32:23] into the land it's corn and wine you
[32:26] have to plant or chlorine of God and
[32:28] I'll tell you something when you cross
[32:30] over the Holy Ones gonna begin to plant
[32:32] inside of you go begin to put spirits
[32:34] with local seed inside of you it'll be a
[32:38] different annoyed altogether you know or
[32:40] glory to God crossing over into the land
[32:43] of Ephesians and we read this quote
[32:48] before some time ago if you get in
[32:50] mechanic's ready and his mechanics here
[32:52] he switch it not text and Colton and
[32:55] wood on wood no get our hearts right the
[32:58] things that we can do follow every word
[33:00] for him in baptism follow me every order
[33:03] he told us to do get every mechanic and
[33:05] stand ear then we are ready for dynamics
[33:10] do people preach days and hours dynamic
[33:14] dynamic comment on what where's the
[33:16] mechanics you bet the mechanics is not
[33:18] just preaching you would the mechanics
[33:21] is getting you your heart rate and and
[33:23] all that you can do that is the personal
[33:26] mechanics before the angels get
[33:28] breakthrough with the Holy Ghost to
[33:30] bring Berta Bannerman to the seventh
[33:31] seal he hadn't said what got all
[33:33] delusions and you have to gather all the
[33:37] illusions of your life your loosens had
[33:40] to be a sin sake a delusion wrong
[33:42] terminology here was the tie up
[33:44] delusions and you have to get delusions
[33:47] in your life tied up then don't come the
[33:50] angel yet tie ablutions in the world and
[33:58] always plug all the gaps
[34:01] and tie it back into the world so now
[34:05] the fluid restored and what a
[34:07] restoration of full word God could bring
[34:09] under full holy rose so he said it this
[34:12] way in uniting time and sign the seven
[34:16] eighty over seven eternity to gather all
[34:17] the scattered wood that tied back into
[34:19] the world to bring on the Holy Ghost so
[34:23] like a template wood that was missing
[34:25] would have Otis or what for to talk like
[34:27] a puzzle so when he posted got together
[34:29] here come the glory so the full glory
[34:33] come down in the message of the hour and
[34:35] God put the glory on sieve it into the
[34:37] world and let the would be preached and
[34:39] put the word in you know the glory in
[34:42] you it would form all of God's glory is
[34:47] in the width but put the word in you
[34:49] that the glory could be inside of you
[34:51] and the devil deceived because he think
[34:54] you have nothing when the secret is the
[34:56] word is in the bride and got at the drop
[34:58] that would in you my spirit spoken word
[35:01] that you read prophecy say what the
[35:03] Tipsy but the promises inside of you by
[35:06] these promises you become a partaker of
[35:08] the divine nature the whole parameters
[35:10] in you tonight by promised by mechanic
[35:13] by the water entire pyramid inside of
[35:16] you or pouring of God but detect
[35:20] equipment power glory to God Alleluia
[35:25] so these Greece come to see Jesus a we
[35:29] would see Jesus talked to the ciphers
[35:32] ciphers in pull them aside try to
[35:33] explain to them and so on
[35:34] psychic bring him say to Jesus look him
[35:37] live and Jesus they let except a corn of
[35:41] wheat fall in the wrong and I divide
[35:44] alone
[35:45] what is your telling them he says says
[35:47] you want to see me right but to see me
[35:50] you have to go to a process
[35:54] you can't see what you want to see the
[35:56] way you want to see it if you really
[35:59] want to see it take the process what
[36:01] that secret room because the corner we'd
[36:06] have to go to something in order to
[36:09] reproduce so if you want to see me you
[36:11] have to see me a Calvary where you have
[36:14] to die
[36:14] Oh hallelujah so Jesus didn't play games
[36:17] with them he tell them the reality of
[36:19] this dying out and this death is death
[36:22] of a corn or wheat this process that
[36:25] they can understand it takes a process
[36:27] to see him to get to him
[36:31] Oh hallelujah swatch get every mechanic
[36:35] ready understand there and when we write
[36:38] the dynamics to be little unique what
[36:40] can do that and that's the drop into
[36:42] your heart the feet that says I am
[36:44] healed that's dynamics let's look at the
[36:47] man who was blind and he was selling
[36:50] newspaper and he was a Catholic his feet
[36:52] had nothing to hold on to so but when he
[36:54] came back any peril any second time
[36:56] bombs I prefer you a heel he said okay
[36:58] see by he strikes on him so he's saying
[37:00] that what's happening here with him now
[37:01] he is saying that from a conscious
[37:03] position by Shah Pahlavi Bashar I'm here
[37:06] I saw here what didn't happen there
[37:08] that's by shadow he dropped from
[37:11] conscious to subconscious I when I hit
[37:15] the subconscious he and he was taken
[37:17] here could he jump out about out here
[37:20] because now it becomes fake from the
[37:23] innermost fade from the soul do you
[37:28] understand how we connected this with
[37:30] Sunday service this first level of faith
[37:34] was intellectual that is what he gave me
[37:36] prayer line with so he endured we get
[37:38] healed but he's I'm blind come back
[37:41] little angry and thinking not have us
[37:42] something happening there at the other
[37:43] spring claim or whatever it is he said
[37:45] he said no bicep your heel you are
[37:47] actually healed
[37:48] it's a manifest in reality but but that
[37:51] is the word so all the world until mill
[37:55] to it
[37:57] I adopted babies it they say when a
[38:05] woman can have a baby she just if she
[38:07] had up a child and I'm keep you know
[38:09] guessing that it will activate things
[38:11] and now she'll have a baby so what he
[38:12] did know he was he was adopting that
[38:14] promise by strapping on him by strap
[38:16] time he'll buy and they laughing at him
[38:18] buy from here I slept on here but you
[38:20] see the more he see it the more getting
[38:22] deeper and deeper and deeper because
[38:25] he's speaking something that is not as
[38:27] good a way he's speaking it and all of a
[38:29] sudden the Holy Spirit dynamics take
[38:31] what he had from here and drop it down
[38:33] here and he had it so don't be afraid to
[38:36] speak it because one day you're gonna
[38:37] drop from here and drop into here and
[38:40] you're gonna have it and go materialized
[38:42] Oh glory to God from here to here the
[38:44] process Oh glory to God the head and the
[38:47] heart looking near but sometime is so
[38:49] far because when you say Amen something
[38:51] say yeah sure or chlorine accord that's
[38:54] a big big distinction or but we want to
[38:56] close that gap tonight or chlorine is on
[38:59] one day it will close all together and
[39:01] what you say you believe what you
[39:04] believe you have a faith that's from the
[39:06] inner mold so glory to God and then
[39:08] you're approaching mark 11:23 if you
[39:11] shall say to the mountain or glory to
[39:14] God remove and don't talk in your heart
[39:16] because as the level of your
[39:18] subconscious Oh tonight do you see you
[39:23] tonight or glory no God hallelujah
[39:27] hallelujah the process of getting to
[39:31] speaking he said believe you have
[39:33] received and you shall receive and when
[39:35] you believe in your karma or if you have
[39:38] aught against any forgive you can't pray
[39:41] with that inside of you when faith is
[39:43] breathable forgiveness
[39:44] so you want to prayer to be answered
[39:45] there's art here there's a grudge here
[39:47] there's something here your code will
[39:48] not hear your prayer you could pray on
[39:51] wireless what God not here in your
[39:52] prayer until you get rid of that
[39:56] [Music]
[39:59] you mean that beloved sure Jesus
[40:03] praising your father prayer forgive them
[40:05] as we forgive those who trespass against
[40:06] us

[40:10] forgive your brother Gordon forgiving
[40:11] you so you pray in God and saying reset
