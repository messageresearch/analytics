========================================

amen and my people have to be delivered am my people have to be set free isn't that right now here's the thing let's come to our context now now God want to deliver the people in order to deliver the people he had to have a man to do it and in order for that man to do God's job that man had to be straightened out that man had to be corrected that man had to be brought into alignment with God's requirement ment that man had to be lining up with God's word Paul said walk worthy of the vocation wherewith you are called there is a vocation there is a call of God upon your life tonight I don't know what it is when Dynamics come he will positionally place you in your vocation and calling by fire but until that come we have to get ourselves in alignment with the word of God and with what God requir Ires for our lives because the only way for us to be used is for us to be broken it's for us to be stripped is for us to come to a debt death of a corner of wheat death to yourself Death to Your attributes de to your flesh de to your ways de to your opinions de to what you want de to how you feel that's why every trial and every test that come your way was to burn the flesh off of you was to burn the desires off of you what to tame you what to groom you to come into obedience oh to the voice of God oh Hallelujah if God spared not his son and every son that cometh to God must be tested must be tried must be persecuted must go through hard things in order to come out the way God wants it in order to be formatted the way God needs you so that if he touch you by your shoulder you could respond and say Here I Am father you can't be going to the shop you can't be going to the bakery when there's people to be delivered you got to be about your father's business isn't that right amen even little Jesus at age 12 said don't you know I'm about my father's business we don't know about Jesus much about Jesus Amen in that 18 years a silence but one thing we do know he was about his father's business not much is wrote of him I don't know he played in the streets I don't know if he went to school maybe he learned carpentry there's not much that's told about him but one thing we do know is that he was about his father's business we know enough to know about Jesus Oh and he was the example seed son and he is the example that we follow tonight so it doesn't matter what you get caught up in in this world Hallelujah but this world is not our home we have jobs we have legitimate things but tonight be about your father's business we're here tonight to see about our father's business we made it our business to come to church tonight we made it our business to come and worship God we made it our business to pray we made it our business to worship we made it our business to see about the things of God oh do you believe that tonight that's wonderful that's wonderful we need more of that the fields are white to harvest but the laborers are few we need more people who are willing to surrender themselves right that's wonderful but now here's the thing maybe there's something that we've neglected to do now Moses firstborn gusan was born in the wilderness isn't that right he's born of of zapor isn't that right and um that's written in Exodus 2 says right here he says uh this when he God married to zor Moses was content to dwell with the man and he gave Moses zor his daughter and verse 22 said she bear him a son and he called his name gersam for he said I have been a Stranger in a Strange landall amen so now uh his name became a testimony of what was going on in Moses's life at that very time is that right strange man in a Strange Land praise God he was learning new things about his people but I'm pretty sure by the from the time he was born to the time that we come down in scripture here where the angel or where where the angel of the Lord speaks to Moses isn't that right where God speaks to Moses out to the burning bush up to this point gersam hasn't been circumcised I don't know how how long this took here between scripture could have been years since this boy was born but there was something that Moses had neglected to do and he found every other thing to do it seemed he was mining jetro's flock he had that to do every morning he had the plans to water he had he he courts the Court's bill to pay he had the mortgage to pay he had the tires to see about he's doing everything else everything else that seemed legitimate isn't that right but it was something he neglected to do something you keep putting off and maybe Zapora his wife probably mentioned it a good few times and you know how man are I'll get it when I have time don't pass to me now I have something more important to do isn't that right I'm guilty of it too too I'm speaking experience you know we always find something more important to do yet fail to see about God's business fail to see about what God wants or requires of us in our lives so this is the thing I this is the reality I wanted to kind of bring tonight what I saw in the scripture here and I know this scripture is kind of like a roadless travel not a lot of people preach on it but it just jumped out at me that after God come down in this Burning Bush and has this glorious conference with Moses Moses is able to see speak to God almost face to face almost as it were isn't that right and he hear the voice of God directly and get uh gets this great charge to go down to Egypt land god ask Moses what that you have in your hand he says a rod he says right this is the rod you're going to use to do Miracles whatever you have I'll use it if you have a Rod I'll use it if you have a stick I'll use it whatever you have I I'll use your shoes I I'll I'll use your your your staff what whatever you got in your hand God is able to use tonight oh Hallelujah any little thing don't despise the day of small things tonight and the day you hear his voice Harden not your heart tonight oh as in the provocation in the wilderness where God is speaking to us to get ourselves right with the word of God oh and here was Moses oh he came back with a countenance shining after having met the glory of God and after all of that just before he's getting ready to head over to Egypt land god comes and meets with him almost in secret it seems almost in private and has a situation that he has to bring to moses' attention and this is scary because this is a man that was supposed to go down to deliver God's people this is the man God rais up this is the man God waiting almost 40 years in the wilderness to get and over this issue the Lord met him verse 24 and sought to kill him in other words God was willing to risk his life even though he was called of God to do the work that he had called him to do he was willing to kill him over this issue amen something he neglected to do here's a prophet that said here in Israel and the church 1953 he said there they are going down to Egypt talks about the story here he says and now watch he said how neglectful a man can get in the end Prophet said God met him down there in the inn and would have slayed him and Zapora and and it would have slayed him he said and theor went and took a sharp Rock and circumcised the the two children with a sharp Rock and throw the force skin before Moses and said you're a bloody husband to me only save Moses life her actions in other words in that moment because she was able to spring into action amen and this thought right here remind me of what brother Isaac over preached so massively amen talking about David and Abigail a women of God who were willing to spring into action and to do what was necessary to save life to preserve life there's another powerful woman of God who God raised up to spare life oh my my this wonderful I want to tie that in there amen praise God so she rose up did what was necessary and she said what and he said what was Moses doing Prophet said what Moses got in such a hustle and bustle of the day till he was in such a place had to go down there and the prophet said he forgot the Seal of circumcision what a situation to be in come like you're going for application and you need your passport and you have your copy of ID your copy of this your letter of recommendation you fall out your form and you forget to carry the main thing you forget that you had the main thing to do you forget you had the main thing to apply for oh we've got to keep the main thing the main thing oh Hallelujah doesn't matter if you come to church doesn't matter how loud you scream doesn't matter how loud you holler but do you have the main thing tonight do you have the Seal of circumcision do you have what God's requirement is do you have the Holy Ghost are you in the church triumphant are you in the savior's bride tonight then come and be uh baptized into the body and forever more abide God wants a church full of the Holy Ghost and if God only gets a church full of the Holy Ghost then God will do in one year what all the theologians fail to do in 2,000 years God will do it if he has a church that is surrendered to God by the Holy Spirit a church that he could use a church marching and step a church marching according to the Beats to the program of God is not right isn't that right the voice of God speaks to John in re ations of all the churches isn't that right when he wrote a letter to smna and to tit teria and to pergamus and to and to laia all of them God had commendations but there was always something they lacked each one of them lacked something and he had to pull them up on it each one of them neglect something and he had to pull them up on it oh H you have fallen from your first love but I say be jealous therefore and repent oh Hallelujah God had something that he had to pull them up Bor there was always something they were neglecting oh and I say to tonight let no neglect the main thing tonight don't come all this way oh and reach halfway and reach just in time oh you want to go all the way tonight oh Hallelujah want to bring forth a 100 fold he requires it of us said walk before me and be th Perfect Isn't that right Oh my he forgot the Seal of circumcision what a thing to forget amen what a thing to forget out in the Wilders all those years mining flock all those years seeing about everything else and yet he forgot the Seal of circumcision yet he didn't have his mind on it enough yet he wasn't at the altar enough paying the price enough getting the extra oil enough what was required to go into the wedding supper oh hallelujah hallelujah isn't that right and the Bible said while they went out to buy the bridegroom had come there's no more time for buying there come a time when time for buying is over you have to pay the price now don't wait for then they won't be enough time then come while there's a knock oh come while God is calling the prophet said he won't be knocking all the time there's a time when he will stop knocking then you'll do the knocking he said but you won't find him it'll be too late then don't forget the main thing tonight oh Hallelujah if we leave if don't get anything else tonight praise God that's the core of it tonight don't forget the main thing and so that's what you're doing here today Prophet said he said that's where the Holiness churches are failing he said we've got so much time and the Lord give us a lot of money and we're building great churches and big spires and putting in plush seats and pipe organs until we forgot the Seal of God he said which is the baptism of the Holy Ghost ghost true said that's true he says amen God send us a zor oh isn't that right amen he said send us as the poor that's right circumcision every male in Egypt of Israel that wasn't circumcised was cut off he said and circumcision was the Seal of the promise and circumcision of the Old Testament is the baptism of the Holy Ghost of the new oh Hall what is it it's a baptism of the Holy Ghost that's what it is it means in the New Testament he said and every man outside of the baptism of the Holy Ghost will be cut off Full Stop Hallelujah that's a prophet I didn't say it Prophet said it here so you've got to have it isn't that right he said there you are oh God be merciful he says oh Hallelujah uh in another uh uh Israel and the church here in paragraph 145 he said but they never did have to wait after that he said while Peter had spake these words the Holy Ghost fell on them all down and then when the Paul laid his hands on them the Holy Ghost came in on them he said isn't that right see no more waiting he said the Holy Ghost was there and give them the baptism of the Holy Ghost in confirmation of their faith oh Hallelujah he gives the Holy Ghost as a confirmation of your faith oh the faith that you stood with all these years oh you come to church Come On Believing come on expecting holding that seed in your heart knowing that the same God that

positionally born oh Hallelujah that's what God's waiting on after that God will then set in the church some Apostles some pastors some evangelists so that means God's waiting on you to get desperate

Holy Ghost and Fire it's a Wednesday night but that doesn't mean you can't be born again oh that doesn't mean you can't be filled that doesn't mean you can't have an experience tonight oh hallelujah

Ghost as a sign that he's accepted your faith oh Hallelujah and then you're sealed into the kingdom of God not till the next Revival but until the day of your Redemption Ephesians 4:30 says grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby you are sealed until the day of redemption there you are he says he says if you haven't received the Holy Ghost spirit since you believe there's something wrong somewhere God gives everybody every believer the baptism of the Holy Spirit that's right that's confirmation of your faith he said says oh no right say so the Seal of confirmation of faith is the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen they God dealing making a provided way for Sinners Isaiah said that he was who has believed or report he said who has the arm of the Lord been revealed how he would grow up like a tender Branch how he was taken as a sheep before the sharers as dumb talking about Jesus isn't that right and we have to be led the same way as sheep to the slaughter oh H you are slaughtered all the day now yet not I but Christ that liveth in me we have to die out there's a process we have to go through God not going to give us a Revival on a silver platter no Revival didn't come without praying didn't come without crying didn't come without seeking when the Asuza Street Revival came there was a man that was crying praying he was praying for so long oh his eyes was deep set till he had to oh Hallelujah mulch his eyes to get it to open because he was praying seeking the Lord seeking God seeking his face looking for reality something in our hearts crying out for reality this world is going to burn one of these days but there's something in us that knows this world is not our home something in us that's not satisfied with where we are oh but we cried out for more still we want more oh I've cried out before but still I want more tonight I've cried out before times pass but I still need more of God I still need more P power more love more Dynamics I want

God oh H to see thy power and thy Glory such as I've seen thee in the sanctuary because I loving kindness is better than life my lips shall praise you when last have you praised him for his loving kindness do you know it's better than life itself the mercy of God that you could be here tonight the mercy of God that God bypass the Learners that God bypass the scholars he bypassed the Pharisees the Sadducees in this world the Pharisees in this message and reveal himself to babes such as would learn such as would cry babes who know how to cry for their mother's milk cry for the Holy Ghost cry for reality cry for God to do something for their family something for their daughter something for their son something for their wives that God would break a thunder through the skies and break a

it until it clinch you got to receive the Holy [Music] Ghost drive it in till we can't sleep at night that God send us a Revival just before the great and terrible day of the Lord God prise God believes on the message the prophet talk about the great coming revival and on that message hallu he talks a lot about judgment the truth and reality is that God always sends a Revival before he sends a judgment truth is Russia turned down their Revival they were judged amen they receive a spirit yes an antichrist spirit in the nation it's still right in there the prophet identified because they turned on the Holy Ghost that's why that happened as a result because they neglected something God had revealed to them oh my don't neglect friends Hallelujah don't be neglectful don't be slack oh my isn't that right he said God is Not slack concerning his promise isn't that right that's second Peter 3 I'll read it verse 9 says the Lord is not slack concerning his promise as some men count slackness but his longsuffering to us word not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance but the day of the Lord he says we come as a te tonight oh what a scripture so in the first script you talk about slackness concerning his promise and then right the next scripture comes in with judgment there's a reason for that because goday up braides us and he and he uh edifies us and pulls us up to let us know that there are things that he requires before he comes comes he says behold I come quickly because my reward is with me to give every man according to his work so you can't be caught with your work undone isn't that right because some people like to reap what they have not sown it's impossible to reap a harvest and you have not sown seed isn't that right you come like a philistin you come like you waiting for the Harvest to come in the fullness ripeness when the wheat blowing in the win and you come with your sickle as if you was working all the time God had a judgment for that you know God raised up shanga with a ox gold Ox gold for them thieves who like to come and reap where they have not sown for every Philistine is having the message who want to reap where they have not sown God going to raise up a Shamar to chase them Devils out oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh glory to God this is a bride's Revival man the bride is going to re rally in this thing she's going to enjoy her Harvest she's going to dance she's going to shout because it will be the answer to all those long nights in prayer it'll be the answer to praying about your children praying about your family praying about your loved ones you are going to reap a harvest for the seeds that you have sown in this message all these years coming to church was not in vain Believing on the Lord Jesus was not in vain he promised to visit you and you held on to that promise faithful because he is faithful and made the promise he will answer at a time of his choosing we just getting ourselves ready for the Revival that's fixing to pour out oh what he's about to pour out tonight oh I say he can pour out right now why don't you get a little of shout of praise and let

up the dead in Christ and all these things that's are promised to happen in the word oh God's going to send a Revival on it amen it's according to our faith tonight amen oh my but the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night in which the heaven shall pass away with a great noise and the element shall melt with fervent heat he's saying this with words but the destruction he's talking about here is 10 million times in the magnitude of what he's even saying here with words all right we we I don't want to be here for that amen praise God I want to be caught up in a cloud to meet him in the air just like the Bible said in a twinkling a moment to be changed oh from this Mortal and put on immortality that's not a fable that's God's promise that's what he said and I believe it tonight oh Hallelujah I believe that I'm going to be caught up on a way I believe that there's coming a Rapture and I believe God call you to be in that Rapture and before you leave here he's going to fill you with the baptism of the Holy Ghost on Fire he's going to steal you he's going to give you a portion your inheritance in the Holy Ghost Land of promises every man every woman will find their place in Christ adoption time when the church finds his brotherly love when a church find a decency when the church find a holy decency place in Christ all those things that we've neglected we're going to go back and pick those things up and when we find it we could say come come to the other members of the body come and rejoice with us we can't say come until we find it we've got to find it that thing that we've been slacking off on we got to pull up our socks tonight and measure ourselves to the word of God and see what we are neglecting do you get it tonight oh man element shall fent heat the Earth also and The Works therein shall be burned up he said seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved what manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and brother over bring

putting him before you in all things checking your mouth to see if you're saying the right thing check in your thoughts to see if you're thinking the right thing acting the right way let the Holy Spirit check you and cover you with that Veil that Adam had in so much that he didn't know he was naked oh Hallelujah when the presence come down oh he was naked but he was clothed with a arment supernatural arment and he was able to have communion with God when that Veil is taken off he was naked when the presence come down he saw his own self exposed isn't that right that what the devil

through us that he could have the preeminent in Us in and through our lives tonight amen do you believe it seeing as all these things are dissolved seeing as all these things are going to be dissolved

neglected to do for the King of Kings there was something they neglected to do for the Lord of lords he sat there in the party with dirty feet and they wouldn't kiss him they wouldn't wash his feet they wouldn't give him oil and she saw a service she could do she saw something she could do for her master something she could do for this man who' been treated unfairly wow what a burden she had surely there's something we could do tonight surely there's more that we could do tonight I'm sure we could examine our own lives and see the things that we're neglecting maybe we're neglecting our prayer life maybe we neglecting to do things or or for God maybe neglecting to worship when we ought to have a better attitude when things go wrong in our lives when things go contrary May we're neglecting to see that he has his hand in all things maybe we neglecting to be thankful maybe we're neglecting to be grateful for the things we do have even when God takes it away from us or when God sees that is not fit for us to have it yet what is our attitude are we grateful to give him praise anyhow because his goodness his Mercy endure it forever doesn't matter what situation faces me what circumstance faces me even if he don't answer my prayer he's still worthy of all the praise worthy of all the honor worthy of all the glory and like job said don't he slay me yet will I trust him uh
