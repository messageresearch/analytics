[34:42] season his leave about his leaf notion

[36:28] to
[36:29] or the same as something
[36:32] it is to do
[36:34] what other people do
[36:36] to be obedient
[36:39] or compliant
[36:41] usually
[36:42] used with two
[36:44] to conform to other wishes
[36:47] in other words they would say the
[36:48] building doesn't conform to local
[36:51] regulations
[36:52] that's an example that's what conform is
[36:56] another
[36:57] explanation of it to act in accordance
[37:00] or harmony
[37:01] to comply usually followed by two to
[37:04] conform to rules
[37:07] if you conform
[37:09] you behave in the way that you are
[37:12] expected
[37:14] or
[37:15] supposed to behave
[37:19] he did not feel obliged to conform to
[37:21] the rules that apply to ordinary men
[37:24] that's the context
[37:26] of using that word conform
[37:28] so that is a a rebel
[37:31] he did not feel obliged
[37:34] to conform to the rules that apply to
[37:37] ordinary men
[37:38] synonyms of this would conform is to fit
[37:40] in
[37:42] to follow
[37:44] to yield
[37:45] to adjust now when
[37:48] cain and abel was asked
[37:51] to offer up
[37:52] a sacrifice to god there were children
[37:55] they come at age maturity god said let
[37:57] me see what you your concept of me how
[37:59] you see me
[38:00] we know the story abel bought a lamb
[38:04] slate
[38:05] and god respected
[38:07] king brought fruits god rejected it and
[38:10] god gave king over do like your brother
[38:13] and i'll bless you too if you do it
[38:16] i'll i let's confirm just just follow
[38:19] you don't even need a revelation he did
[38:21] that and was blessed you do that you get
[38:23] blessed too you don't even need a
[38:24] revelation to do it just do it
[38:27] and people fight conforming they don't
[38:30] want to be similar too
[38:32] now we know the story with the wedding
[38:34] when you in the old testament the
[38:36] wedding and i kind of saw it in africa a
[38:38] bit it was kind of blowing my mind
[38:40] um because in hotel and when i looked
[38:42] down there was a wedding in hotel we
[38:44] were staying in
[38:45] and everybody was wearing the same
[38:47] garment
[38:48] uh maybe different style but the same
[38:49] color material and the first time i'm
[38:51] seeing this and it kind of brings to
[38:53] light what the prophet shared of how it
[38:56] was in those days in those days when you
[38:59] come to the wedding you will give them a
[39:00] garment
[39:02] so you are just walking you know when
[39:03] you get at the door at the door you get
[39:06] the garment to put on so everybody looks
[39:08] similar
[39:09] everybody look the same
[39:11] so when the master of the house came he
[39:13] saw somebody not looking similar or the
[39:16] same he saw somebody with a different he
[39:18] said friend oh you come in here because
[39:20] every time you pass through the door
[39:22] everybody get a garment at the door
[39:24] they say buying him hand on foot
[39:26] no he call him friend so he knew who it
[39:28] was
[39:29] but he said but where's the garment
[39:31] because barbara says that is what the
[39:33] baptism of the holy ghost does it make
[39:35] us all the same it make us all similar
[39:38] it make us all like one we dress in the
[39:41] same garment
[39:42] [Music]
[39:43] [Applause]
[39:45] so you see when you have the same
[39:46] garment nobody can storm the wedding oh
[39:48] you call it i can forget what they call
[39:49] it
[39:51] um crash sweating crashes they can't
[39:52] crash you with it so tell america when i
[39:54] see the food down there i said what if i
[39:56] go wrong there you go see i know garment
[39:58] i i ain't got it i didn't get a
[39:59] revolutionary clothes everybody who had
[40:02] the clothes because they were invited
[40:04] they may have been given the claw to
[40:05] what to buy or whatever it is make it
[40:07] however you want to make it but come
[40:09] dressed the same way
[40:11] then any crook in his teeth any sneaker
[40:13] because he gets immediately exposed
[40:16] and that is what this gospel come to do
[40:19] to dress us in the same way
[40:21] there's no big me and little you there's
[40:23] no big shot and who higher than who and
[40:26] who are more powerful than who it
[40:28] doesn't have that in the kingdom or give
[40:30] the lord a shout we have a job we have
[40:33] our purpose oh praise the name of the
[40:35] lord
[40:36] so king didn't want to comply
[40:41] or conform
[40:43] and there are a lot of people like that
[40:45] they don't like orders they don't like
[40:46] to be pushed around when you understand
[40:48] you want to be pushed around because
[40:50] they want to be right
[40:51] as i said in the bible study some people
[40:53] like to ask questions because they don't
[40:54] want people to know that they don't know
[40:58] and what you don't know is what's going
[40:59] to get you blues
[41:01] and you don't know what you don't know
[41:04] so you better find out
[41:06] oh glory to god let me say it again what
[41:09] you know you know but what you don't
[41:10] know is what's going to stick you
[41:13] and this is where you come to the
[41:15] service for to get the mind of god to
[41:17] get the mind of christ to get things
[41:19] that you don't know
[41:22] hallelujah that needs to be revealed to
[41:24] you
[41:25] by the spirit
[41:26] oh blessed be the name of the lord
[41:28] our next scripture context scripture
[41:30] romans 8 28 we know it and we know that
[41:33] all things not some
[41:35] work together for good to them that love
[41:37] god
[41:38] to them who are the called according to
[41:41] his purpose
[41:43] for whom he did for no he also did
[41:45] predestiny to be conformed to the image
[41:48] of his son
[41:49] here we get the next the word again
[41:51] whom
[41:53] he did pre-destiny for no he also did
[41:56] predestinated to be
[41:59] conformed

[42:04] transform
[42:06] conform
[42:07] line up with what is required of you
[42:10] that is what you are predestinated onto
[42:12] not do your own thing but to be
[42:14] conformed
[42:16] all glory to god hallelujah and we say
[42:19] conform is to comply with rules
[42:22] that you don't be the rule breaker of
[42:24] god laws
[42:25] yes they are trying to break rules like
[42:27] man rules but they can't break god rules

[57:26] wicked ear
[57:31] you know the bible says rebellion is
[57:32] that you see now witchcraft
[57:35] fighting the pastor fighting the world
[57:37] you're fighting in the ministry of
[57:38] fighting you feel the fighter
[57:42] because you don't want to conform
[57:44] they say sit here you don't want to sit
[57:46] here you want
[57:47] remember some reasons ago sister is your
[57:50] next sister
[57:52] you're comfortable your seat it again
[57:53] next year
[57:55] i would tell you didn't move move you
[57:58] miserable spirits
[58:00] reason of assists our city our city they
[58:02] don't want to even listen god could
[58:04] inspire the usher to put you in a
[58:06] certain place by the angel of the lord
[58:09] coming to visit you in that seat
[58:12] but because you're in a cuckoo mood
[58:14] you have to do his hair and you want
[58:16] this here and all you want is your way
[58:18] and when you get your way you feel like
[58:20] the right way hallelujah
[58:23] they're not conforming
[58:25] doesn't follow him no
[58:27] oh yes
[58:28] as we say uh uh when god say uh walk
[58:32] around jericho so much at times it's not
[58:33] a matter of that train on the wall is a
[58:35] matter of following in instruction
[58:38] that what god wants you know to see
[58:40] if you'd follow instructions
[58:42] god has been simple instructions to see
[58:45] if we'll follow go and show yourself to
[58:47] the priest the lepers he know the
[58:48] original priest he just said go on to
[58:50] yourself to the priest all were healed
[58:52] in obedience to god
[58:54] so what god tests enforcement is
[58:56] obedience
[58:57] no you'd rather you come to church but
[58:59] but they come to church to hear the word
[59:01] the word is bring instructions that you
[59:04] may act on it
[59:07] no you could hear it and say you know
[59:09] what you're a good sermon
[59:11] but in what you're hearing have things
[59:13] for you to act on
[59:15] if you don't act on it it's just
[59:16] remaining here on stage
[59:19] and therefore you ain't changing at all
[59:21] like a woman at times you say she said
[59:23] my husband dead he never changed me
[59:28] she proud of that
[59:29] he never changed me dead and gone he had
[59:33] changed me
[59:34] yeah

[59:44] that come in your way that you will not
[59:47] be able to stop
[59:48] that will change you
[59:50] we cannot continue the way we are going
[59:54] you have to have a design you have to be
[59:55] changed
[59:57] to be transformed

[1:00:04] fresh infusion of thoughts
[1:00:07] reveal your purpose to my life
[1:00:09] that i could get into action
[1:00:14] because what you're getting here by the
[1:00:15] word is god's will
[1:00:17] god will is his word do you believe that
[1:00:20] hallelujah i'm going to skip all the
[1:00:21] rest amen
[1:00:24] second timothy tree almost like a bible
[1:00:26] study
[1:00:28] second timothy 3 16-17 and this is where
[1:00:30] i get the title from
[1:00:33] all scripture
[1:00:35] all
[1:00:37] shout out all
[1:00:38] all scripture is given by inspiration of
[1:00:41] god
[1:00:42] and is profitable for doctrine
[1:00:45] for reproof
[1:00:47] for correction
[1:00:48] for instruction in righteousness
[1:00:51] that the man of god may be perfect
[1:00:54] thoroughly finished
[1:00:57] onto all good works
[1:00:59] in the amplified
[1:01:01] every scripture is god breathed
[1:01:05] given by inspiration
[1:01:07] and profitable for instruction
[1:01:10] for reproof
[1:01:12] and conviction of sin
[1:01:14] for correction of error
[1:01:17] and discipline in obedience
[1:01:20] and
[1:01:21] here we go
[1:01:22] for training in righteousness
[1:01:25] training in what
[1:01:27] in righteousness in holy living
[1:01:30] in conformity to god's will
[1:01:34] in thought
[1:01:35] purpose and action
[1:01:38] so that the man of god may be complete
[1:01:40] and proficient well fitted and
[1:01:42] thoroughly equipped for every good work
[1:01:44] so this scripture or the scriptures
[1:01:48] is for training in righteousness in holy
[1:01:51] living in conformity to god's will in
[1:01:54] thought purpose and action
[1:01:56] remember
[1:01:57] something i keep saying over and over
[1:01:59] when israel came out they didn't know
[1:02:01] who god is
[1:02:03] moses was smart enough to say them
[1:02:05] people is trouble tell me who i see who
[1:02:07] shall i say send me
[1:02:09] because they go asks
[1:02:11] because israel is a stiff neck they're
[1:02:13] not easy you know
[1:02:14] go tell them tell them i am senior
[1:02:17] anybody ask tell them i am that i
[1:02:20] so moses wants to bring them to the
[1:02:22] mountain for them to get instructions
[1:02:24] for to get god laws
[1:02:26] so they get all good things and fields
[1:02:28] remember it's got to be talking about
[1:02:31] even if you're going a job you have to
[1:02:33] find out you can't just go on job okay
[1:02:34] uh i'm going to remove that i go and do
[1:02:36] that i feel led i'm feeling like you
[1:02:38] feel like sit down and shut up you're
[1:02:39] happy let nothing you have to find out
[1:02:41] what the boss want you have to find out
[1:02:43] what the company wants and you have to
[1:02:45] confirm your action and operation to
[1:02:47] what the company's vision is
[1:02:50] you can come and bring your own vision
[1:02:51] have a bigger vision than your boss many
[1:02:52] company get out of here
[1:02:55] they will boot you out
[1:02:57] yeah you had to hold your vision down
[1:03:00] keep that for yourself
[1:03:01] because you sign up for our next company
[1:03:02] we sign up to god's company and he has a
[1:03:05] vision that he wants his church and his
[1:03:07] people he wants another book of acts he
[1:03:09] wants a super church a super race he won
[1:03:11] the same life same action he want the
[1:03:13] holy ghost come down and have the
[1:03:14] preeminences that's what his desire is
[1:03:16] yeah well nothing long no short of that
[1:03:18] for for hundreds of years we had church
[1:03:20] ages so so people are custom being in
[1:03:23] church building and pews and steeple and
[1:03:25] all that they like church and a priest
[1:03:27] long gone crossing front is chest and
[1:03:29] different things that is what they are
[1:03:30] accustomed with so god come now to the
[1:03:32] to shake that whole thing up by saying a
[1:03:35] prophet to bring those here the lord the
[1:03:38] same god of the old testament
[1:03:40] jesus of the new and by bringing the
[1:03:42] word you get the understanding of who
[1:03:44] god where he is
[1:03:45] how he keeps his word so this psalm one
[1:03:48] we read here blessed is the man that man
[1:03:50] in trinidad you know

[1:12:53] when they're talking normal first they
[1:12:54] ask a question there the way there's
[1:12:56] original there's actually a question
[1:12:57] that is you know it's true your name is
[1:12:59] so-and-so that's right machine going
[1:13:01] straight so
[1:13:02] eleven so and so the machine goes
[1:13:03] straight through
[1:13:06] did you steal
[1:13:10] the thing on the job
[1:13:12] no i did not motion to do so
[1:13:16] because the machine
[1:13:18] not recording your words you know
[1:13:21] your pressure
[1:13:23] your pulse
[1:13:24] your heart
[1:13:25] because man wasn't made a lie
[1:13:28] god set it up that way
[1:13:32] god god set the door away
[1:13:34] so you say i did not steal
[1:13:37] you could say it's off the machine
[1:13:38] saying do something
[1:13:40] you're going to say well i did not do it
[1:13:42] still doing so
[1:13:47] because
[1:13:49] it wasn't built to lie
[1:13:51] now listen to this this is powerful
[1:13:54] the lie detector will not work on your
[1:13:57] mind
[1:13:58] it work on your soul
[1:14:01] [Music]
[1:14:03] so what he's saying
[1:14:05] it is working at the subconscious level
[1:14:09] not your conscious
[1:14:10] because some people
[1:14:12] when they line with ultra light detector
[1:14:14] that's the light called the first light
[1:14:16] and the light covers the second light
[1:14:17] that's remotely lights there's plenty
[1:14:18] working
[1:14:20] it better since the treatment is one
[1:14:21] treat coming out you know
[1:14:24] but when you lie and you come up like
[1:14:25] lie afterwards you had a measure that's
[1:14:27] how police does find emotion when they
[1:14:29] do stuff
[1:14:30] they tell you a story they take notes
[1:14:33] and three months after they come let me
[1:14:35] hear the story again
[1:14:37] and i hear a different thing come out
[1:14:39] because you see your yeah the current
[1:14:41] memory is it so far back
[1:14:44] all right let's continue
[1:14:46] they can impersonate yet it's been a lie
[1:14:49] and can impersonate it till they can
[1:14:51] receive like anything now satan is the
[1:14:54] best that there is there for he deceive
[1:14:56] eve
[1:14:57] okay now this person what if you could
[1:15:00] get this soul on the inside
[1:15:03] so in harmony with god
[1:15:05] that your soul and god could be one
[1:15:08] together then you could ask what you
[1:15:10] will
[1:15:10] and it shall be given to you
[1:15:13] oh he's going deeper
[1:15:14] many people come to me many times in the
[1:15:16] prayer line and stand here and say oh
[1:15:18] brother branham i have plenty faith i've
[1:15:20] got faith like to move mountains and yet
[1:15:23] they haven't any faith
[1:15:25] they hardly have enough fear to get to
[1:15:26] the platform
[1:15:28] but they are conscious of one thing they
[1:15:29] do believe
[1:15:31] they are believing intellectually with
[1:15:33] their mind now take take this not as i
[1:15:36] am preaching something but take this as
[1:15:37] brother branham here explaining what is
[1:15:40] happening with people and you can see
[1:15:42] what will happen be happening with you
[1:15:45] and with us all right
[1:15:47] he said now watch they are conscious of
[1:15:49] one thing they do believe they are
[1:15:51] believing intellectually with their mind
[1:15:53] and their mind will never bring them to
[1:15:56] god
[1:15:57] your mind is reasoning and god has no
[1:16:00] reason
[1:16:03] so that's why you hear people give a
[1:16:06] testimony they went to a service and
[1:16:07] they don't know how they reached the
[1:16:09] altar
[1:16:11] there was an ibaka they pew and when the
[1:16:14] preachers had to preach something moved
[1:16:15] them and they find yourself at the altar
[1:16:17] tears in the eye and they want to save
[1:16:19] the lord or whatnot that is not mind you
[1:16:20] know
[1:16:21] that is the spirit of god do something
[1:16:23] to their heart
[1:16:24] and pull them to the that is not mine
[1:16:27] you understand those who follow others
[1:16:29] this is what you are going through that
[1:16:30] is head
[1:16:32] dicey wonder dollars you see because
[1:16:34] that end not a heart conviction
[1:16:37] okay so you're watching the operation of
[1:16:39] the spirit now let's continue
[1:16:40] now if you can reason out your mind will
[1:16:42] tell you now look here doctors say i
[1:16:44] can't get it over it's impossible the
[1:16:46] doctor with his intellect with his
[1:16:47] intelligence with his knowledge of
[1:16:48] medical science he has told you the best
[1:16:50] of the travel of his mind and you take
[1:16:53] in your mind and using the same thing
[1:16:54] the doctors told you god could never
[1:16:56] touch that line as long as you reason
[1:16:59] let's put down reason god never made us
[1:17:01] to live by our intellect we live by the
[1:17:03] holy spirit that's in our soul
[1:17:05] and that says no to any reason that is
[1:17:08] contrary to god's word then watch when
[1:17:11] god would say the soul there is nothing
[1:17:13] in the world standing its way and when
[1:17:15] you do that you are getting down on the
[1:17:17] right side of god you are getting down
[1:17:19] till you can ask what you want to it
[1:17:20] will be given to you because there's
[1:17:22] nothing between there there's no reason
[1:17:24] they stand in your way get your mind out
[1:17:26] of the way you don't have to say what
[1:17:27] your reason what you see what you think
[1:17:30] say what god say to be truth
[1:17:32] that can only come from inside
[1:17:34] from the heart
[1:17:36] not from the intellects
[1:17:38] then he went on to this year
[1:17:39] there is where so many people today
[1:17:42] is going to be terribly disappointed at
[1:17:44] the day of judgment
[1:17:45] to know that they lived in church to
[1:17:47] know that they have got done good deeds
[1:17:49] to know they have treated their neighbor
[1:17:50] right to know that they are loyal to
[1:17:52] people loyal to the church and in their
[1:17:53] mind i believe that jesus christ the son
[1:17:56] of god and be condemned at the day of
[1:17:58] judgment
[1:17:59] jesus said many are called
[1:18:02] and few are chosen straight is the gate
[1:18:05] now is the way that leads to life but
[1:18:07] few that be that find it
[1:18:09] no
[1:18:10] as i was saying a few days ago
[1:18:14] i want you to pay close attention
[1:18:17] put a lie detector on you
[1:18:19] and you could try to impersonate the
[1:18:22] truth try to say it's the truth but dawn
[1:18:24] on the inside of you in the subconscious
[1:18:27] lays a place called the soul
[1:18:30] and this intellectual mind here we go
[1:18:33] does not govern the vibration of the
[1:18:36] system
[1:18:37] the mind is only a director it will
[1:18:39] direct you but it is very incapable of
[1:18:42] bringing you to god your mind you cannot
[1:18:45] know god by your mind intellectual it's
[1:18:47] one of the resources or the channels
[1:18:50] that you could lead to it
[1:18:52] here we go but your soul is what governs
[1:18:55] you
[1:18:56] you are
[1:18:58] what you are
[1:18:59] by your soul
[1:19:02] that's a defining statement
[1:19:04] not by your house and land it have
[1:19:06] crooked people have house lanca
[1:19:08] aeroplane boats and everything else and
[1:19:10] they're crooked as their teeth liars
[1:19:13] running after children and all kind of
[1:19:15] stuff like that but you are what you are
[1:19:17] by your
[1:19:19] soul
[1:19:20] or give the lord some praises
[1:19:25] so
[1:19:26] the object of this gospel holy ghost
[1:19:29] gospel
[1:19:30] is to get your subconscious and
[1:19:31] conscious line up together
[1:19:33] to get your soul lined up with the word
[1:19:35] to get your heart and mind line up with
[1:19:37] your word isn't that right as a man
[1:19:39] thinks in his heart so is he
[1:19:41] now when you come and i think we said it
[1:19:44] a couple of years ago we were preaching
[1:19:45] about when somebody born to the british
[1:19:48] royal family uh a little child born
[1:19:51] prince harry prince this prince that
[1:19:52] princess this or whatever it is then
[1:19:54] they're born into royalty
[1:19:56] they don't know as babies they are royal
[1:19:58] if you put them on the train appearance
[1:20:00] they'll betray the audience they will go
[1:20:02] to school they will run around they
[1:20:04] would they will do just what training
[1:20:06] others do but because in that
[1:20:08] environment they are being taught
[1:20:10] they are being trained they are being
[1:20:13] told they are shown history they show
[1:20:15] the history of the lineage of how much
[1:20:18] queen and who was the queen queen and
[1:20:19] who was the master and what all of that
[1:20:21] and that give them a consciousness when
[1:20:24] they begin to walk the streets cameras
[1:20:25] kicking on them they say stop taking a
[1:20:27] picture i will get vex i got boss ahead
[1:20:29] they're not talking that way they're
[1:20:31] supposed to get pictures the press
[1:20:33] supposed to follow after them because
[1:20:34] they're royalty hallelujah they belong
[1:20:37] to a royal family well you belong to a
[1:20:39] royal family also you are royalty
[1:20:42] the royal seat of abraham you are
[1:20:44] royalty oh the devil's supposed to be
[1:20:46] looking at you come on look at them
[1:20:48] don't look at me he looking at you he
[1:20:50] could never be royalty he could never
[1:20:52] have what you have he could never get
[1:20:54] your inheritance he could never get his
[1:20:56] name on the book or give the lord a
[1:20:57] praise offering
[1:21:02] you are royalty
[1:21:03] oh glory hallelujah hallelujah
[1:21:06] hallelujah glory to god
[1:21:09] royalty had to be handled a certain way
[1:21:11] so every time listen they have something
[1:21:13] like what they call i need to take care
[1:21:15] of them
[1:21:16] not the modern father you know because
[1:21:17] they might have to be taking care of a
[1:21:19] certain way they can't get all
[1:21:21] ragamuffin to go and tell them things
[1:21:22] some old teeth
[1:21:24] make them steal they say you're a thief
[1:21:25] and prince
[1:21:27] they can't have that they have the right
[1:21:28] tutor and god have the shooter also the
[1:21:31] truth is the holy ghost god said in
[1:21:34] tutor to truth to you because you are
[1:21:36] loyalty you're coming unto something
[1:21:39] you're predestinated unto something you
[1:21:41] have to be conformed to something so go
[1:21:43] to the first deal with your thought oh
[1:21:45] give the lord a praise offering so first
[1:21:48] you come just as you are a sinner you
[1:21:50] know nothing about god so then god has
[1:21:52] introduced you his thoughts he said my
[1:21:54] twas are not your thoughts my ways are
[1:21:56] not your ways as high the heavens above
[1:21:58] the earth so my thoughts above your
[1:22:00] thoughts so you have to god god's will
[1:22:02] in his thoughts in his thinking in his
[1:22:05] purpose and the action that god wants
[1:22:07] you to get into what give the lord a
[1:22:09] praise often so when you come to church
[1:22:12] you come to catch the thoughts of god
[1:22:14] you come to touch the mind of god you
[1:22:16] can because the will of god our father
[1:22:19] who art in heaven hallowed be thy name
[1:22:21] thy kingdom come thy will be done
[1:22:24] on earth
[1:22:26] as it is in heaven okay the lord has
[1:22:28] shouted in the house
[1:22:30] oh glory to in your heart have the
[1:22:32] desire for god's will
[1:22:34] import in purpose and in action oh glory
[1:22:38] to god that is what you want to conform
[1:22:40] to
[1:22:43] that is what you want to confirm
[1:22:47] i don't know about you
[1:22:49] but for the past couple of services i'm
[1:22:52] seeing god just close in the gap
[1:22:54] it's like a pyramid all the time was
[1:22:56] wide at the bottom but see as i get
[1:22:58] closer to the top it the clap is narrows
[1:23:01] it narrows some people fall off you know
[1:23:03] in a broad part of the gap because they
[1:23:05] see it gets steeper as they climb higher
[1:23:08] oh give the lord a shout come on now
[1:23:11] do you see that pyramid no
[1:23:13] in the broad path tons of people could
[1:23:15] stay on there but as you get higher it
[1:23:18] gets deeper you want to continue
[1:23:21] if any man come after me
[1:23:23] let him deny himself let him take off
[1:23:26] his cross
[1:23:27] you want to continue
[1:23:29] come on now come on now give the lord a

[1:29:03] father in him to seek god in the church
[1:29:05] listen what a union a oneness that would
[1:29:08] be to see god in the church till every
[1:29:12] member is just perfectly in harmony with
[1:29:15] each other and god amen
[1:29:17] that's the church that jesus coming for
[1:29:20] that's when his prayer will be answered
[1:29:23] so how come
[1:29:24] you claim to be in harmony with god
[1:29:26] are you not harmony with your brothers
[1:29:29] what kind of harmony is that that your
[1:29:30] own harmony
[1:29:31] you blowing your own tune
[1:29:33] it's not so enough
[1:29:34] it's sat with your brethren first
[1:29:36] if they can't love you about who you see
[1:29:38] it has it separate that person
[1:29:40] yeah yeah that's why the odds and
[1:29:42] grudges and it's only in this
[1:29:43] environment somebody can mash your toe
[1:29:45] if you stand by yourself and you see
[1:29:46] that christian and you you bet yourself
[1:29:48] who forgiven you who you
[1:29:50] forgiven you're fooling yourself deceive
[1:29:53] let people stay on my receive somebody

[1:36:21] called for it that's quite a message and
[1:36:24] now we are going to type that with the
[1:36:26] spiritual throat of the day we all know
[1:36:29] we are very aware that there's a great
[1:36:31] spiritual drought in the land today
[1:36:34] spiritually speaking and was predicted
[1:36:37] by the prophets just before the second
[1:36:39] coming of christ there will come a
[1:36:41] famine in the land it won't be for bread
[1:36:43] alone but for hearing of the word of the
[1:36:45] lord the hearing the truth of the lord
[1:36:47] sin and unbelief by false teachers and
[1:36:51] by modernists in the church has brought
[1:36:53] the praise that is coming on coming
[1:36:55] judgment they have turned down god's
[1:36:57] word and his prophet
[1:37:00] oh glory to god to a modern theological
[1:37:02] tune of the word that's why they're not
[1:37:04] saying what the tapes say that's why
[1:37:06] they're preaching their own thing that's
[1:37:08] why they're bringing their own
[1:37:09] revelations but he says the spirit the
[1:37:12] prophet and the pride will say the same
[1:37:14] thing
[1:37:15] and what they say will already be said
[1:37:17] in the word oh give the lord i shout no
[1:37:20] man could bring no new mystery he's a
[1:37:22] liar
[1:37:23] oh glory to god amen
[1:37:25] oh give the lord a shout in the house
[1:37:28] rapturing the theaters laying in the
[1:37:29] messages and we preaching this word word
[1:37:32] pipe with
[1:37:34] [Applause]
[1:37:45] when god sends what a message and tell
[1:37:48] the people
[1:37:50] that they don't and they don't receive
[1:37:51] it
[1:37:52] then he withdraws his servant
[1:37:54] and sends plagues
[1:37:56] famine
[1:37:58] debt
[1:37:59] spiritually speaking and physically also
[1:38:02] waiting coronavirus is a plague
[1:38:05] and he said we're striving to enter the
[1:38:07] king of god
[1:38:08] before these horrible plagues strike
[1:38:11] this plague is a down payment or what's
[1:38:13] coming
[1:38:14] but god promised some sons of god
[1:38:16] manifested sons he will say stop
[1:38:19] diseases stop cancer
[1:38:20] what are you looking to do in the
[1:38:21] rapture no why should why are you
[1:38:22] looking at rapture no i ain't stop no

[1:38:44] to wait
[1:38:45] that will wait and the results come from
[1:38:46] first until the true or not they come
[1:38:48] from first because we are too anointed
[1:38:50] unfortunately and we are seeing false
[1:38:52] anointed yet because the unknowns under
[1:38:54] the common can make them false but
[1:38:56] before they become false you have gotten

[1:44:46] with nail scarred hands sometimes his
[1:44:48] potter must take the vessel he is
[1:44:51] working on and probably break it down in
[1:44:54] order he may rebuild it exactly as he
[1:44:57] desires
