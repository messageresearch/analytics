[33:11] I love it I love what I feel and I trust
[33:14] to got a word from that exhortation on
[33:16] wednes on Friday sanctify yourselves the
[33:19] Lord will do great things among us and
[33:23] that sanctification is not a one time
[33:25] thing it has to become a way of Life how
[33:28] you want to live I have to start with
[33:31] your mind because sanctification is set
[33:34] your mind in order of Holiness we don't
[33:37] know what Holiness is but God could take
[33:38] us by his word to show us exactly what
[33:41] his Holiness is so we have a special
[33:44] service for you so bless you this
[33:45] morning but I want to read from Jeremiah
[33:47] chapter 2 you can sit right where you
[33:49] are I want to read the scripture
[33:51] moreover the word of the Lord came to me
[33:52] saying go and cry in the ears of
[33:55] Jerusalem saying thus say the Lord I
[33:58] remember the kindness of thy youth the
[34:01] love of thine disposals when thou
[34:03] wentest after me in the wilderness in
[34:06] the land that was not SW Israel verse
[34:09] three was Holiness unto the Lord and the
[34:12] first fruit of his increase all that
[34:15] devour him shall offend evil shall come
[34:17] upon them sayeth the Lord hear ye the
[34:20] word of the Lord House of Jacob and all
[34:22] the families of the House of Israel thus
[34:25] sayeth the Lord and this is them that
[34:27] struck me what iniquity have your
[34:31] fathers found in me that they have gone
[34:34] far from me and have walked after vanity
[34:38] and become vain Lord verse six neither
[34:41] said they where is the Lord that brought
[34:43] us out of the land of Egypt that led us
[34:45] through the Wilderness through the land
[34:47] of desert and pits through the land of
[34:49] drought and the shadow of De through a
[34:51] land that no man passed through where no
[34:53] man dwelleth and I brought you into a PL
[34:56] plentiful country to eat the fruit
[34:59] thereof and the goodness thereof but
[35:02] when he entered he defiled my land and
[35:06] made my in Heritage and Abomination
[35:09] we're going to get into this sometime in
[35:11] the future but I just a little
[35:13] introduction and you know what you see
[35:17] you see God's love for his people and
[35:20] his Mercy extended to them by giving
[35:23] them the truth of his word but you know
[35:25] what is amazing about the Lord he
[35:27] doesn't Force anybody he can't force you
[35:29] to sanctify yourself he can't force you
[35:32] to clean up your act you have to want to
[35:34] do that you have to want to cut off the
[35:36] world you have to want to cut off all
[35:38] them crazy friends you have to want God
[35:42] and to love him with all your heart your
[35:44] mind and your soul you have to want that
[35:48] God are going to arrest you and tell you
[35:49] love me and serve me no no no no no he
[35:52] said you even consult me to say where is
[35:54] the god that brought you out I brought
[35:57] you out I brought you to a good land I
[35:59] brought you to a land full of milk and
[36:01] honey and look how you're treating me
[36:03] look how you're dealing with me what
[36:05] iniquity did you find in me where was I
[36:08] not faithful where wasn't I loving and
[36:10] caring where I didn't protect you and
[36:12] bring you through praise God when you
[36:14] was D out I bring you out when you fell
[36:17] I pick you up when you was sick I heal
[36:19] you oh glory to God when you was blind
[36:21] to make it to see what iniquity have you
[36:24] found in me that you would treat me that
[36:26] way oh give the Lord some Praises glory
[36:29] to God he was challenging them to
[36:32] acknowledge he is God that brought them
[36:34] out Oh Glory
[36:38] Hallelujah and that is why when he turn
[36:41] on them and say his anger his Fierce
[36:43] anger he will burn them he will run them
[36:45] he will send the sword after them he
[36:47] would run them to the end of the Earth
[36:49] you can understand the justice of God
[36:51] and the righteousness of God and he tell
[36:53] them that they want to operate from the
[36:55] devices of Their Own heart and many time
[36:57] you hear me preach people have the god
[36:59] of their imagination they imagine what
[37:01] God thinks but God is the word when we
[37:04] read from the scripture you're hearing
[37:06] who God is how he thinks Oh Glory to God
[37:09] and I love it he said what iniquity have
[37:11] you found in me there's no iniquity in

[37:16] him is righteousness Oh Glory to God God
[37:20] want you to be holy because he is Holy
[37:22] he wants you to be righteous because he
[37:24] is righteous is not our holiness is his
[37:27] Holiness he want you to live Sanctified
[37:29] Oh Glory to God he want you to cut off
[37:31] the world he want you to walk in the
[37:33] light of his goodness and his grace that
[37:36] he can bless you and multiply and run
[37:38] the enemies before you oh glory to God

[46:48] Joshua Joshua I'm sorry Deuteronomy
[46:51] chapter
[46:53] 28 Deuteronomy 28 and read verses 1 to
[46:59] 14 and then I
[47:03] will also read Ecclesiastes
[47:06] 91-111 may let me read Ecclesiastes 91-1
[47:10] for us let you sit down then I'll
[47:12] continue with Deuteronomy
[47:14] 28 Ecclesiastes chapter 9: 10 and
[47:17] 11 are I read this last week and I'm
[47:21] reading again whatsoever thy hand find
[47:24] to do do it with thy might for there is
[47:28] no work nor device nor knowledge nor
[47:30] wisdom in the grave with thou goest
[47:33] which is the way of every
[47:35] man I return and saw under the son that
[47:39] the race is not to the Swift nor the
[47:41] battle to the strong neither yet bre to
[47:44] the wise nor yet riches to Men of
[47:47] understanding nor yet favor to Men of
[47:50] skill but CH and chance happen to them
[47:54] all CH and chance is opportunity happens
[47:57] to everybody I don't have no
[47:59] opportunities it's not true scripture
[48:00] says it happens to them all amen may the
[48:04] Lord add his Blessing to reading of his
[48:05] holy
[48:06] words seated while I continue reading I
[48:09] read from Deuteronomy
[48:11] 28 um ver 1 14 please remain s there the
[48:15] musicians because I always forget you
[48:17] there and then you leave but just remain
[48:20] together today okay
[48:22] um um I see want to do a song okay
[48:26] Deuteronomy 28:
[48:28] 1-4 um two weeks ago I think it was read
[48:31] Deuteronomy 8 which is when they were on
[48:35] the way to the promised land this they
[48:37] are still on the way to the promised
[48:38] land on the way to the promised land he
[48:40] was
[48:41] reviewing the last 40 years with them
[48:44] and telling them about what God had told
[48:46] them and remember don't forget remember
[48:50] don't forget because you have been
[48:52] slaves in Egypt and in the in the
[48:54] wilderness you have been there and now
[48:57] you are going to a land where you're
[48:59] going to have abundance in Egypt as
[49:01] slaves you never had enough in the
[49:04] wilderness you had just barely enough
[49:06] but now you are going to the a land
[49:09] where you are going to have abundance
[49:12] don't forget me that's what the Lord is
[49:15] telling them because he knows he he made
[49:17] us he knows how we are wired he knows
[49:19] when we have some small stuff in our
[49:21] pocket you know we forget him that's
[49:24] just the way of man that's why he says
[49:26] they that will be rich in this world
[49:28] will fall into diverse Temptations and
[49:30] they have their souls you know um with a
[49:34] P with a with with an arrow something
[49:37] like
[49:38] that so um so in this place here is is
[49:43] is telling them the blessings and I'm
[49:45] going to tell this to work because it's
[49:46] telling them the blessings that will
[49:48] come from their
[49:51] work um he had told them Deuteronomy 8
[49:54] they they're going to land where is
[49:56] plenty
[49:58] and and and and they're going to have to
[50:01] walk with their hands but they're going
[50:03] to like be blessed and he going to give
[50:06] them power to create wealth and all of
[50:09] that power they were getting as we were
[50:11] going through the Wilderness and um so
[50:14] is now this is a bit more specific about
[50:16] what the blessings are what the um um
[50:21] wealth is so just listen here
[50:24] Deuteronomy 28: 1-
[50:26] [Music]
[50:27] 14 and it shall come to pass if Thou
[50:30] shalt hearken diligently unto the voice
[50:32] of the Lord thy God to observe and to do
[50:36] all his Commandments which I command
[50:38] thee this day that the Lord thy God will
[50:40] set thee on high above all nations of
[50:42] the earth so they different the the
[50:45] different it doesn't matter what the
[50:48] nation it matters not what the nation
[50:51] will set you up and above every nation
[50:54] on Earth because this is the king
[50:55] kingdom of God which is not in any
[50:57] particular place or location but it's
[51:00] where because the spirit of God the
[51:01] spirit moves where it wants where it
[51:04] listed and the the the the the uh the
[51:07] spirit of God is all over the world like
[51:09] the song like the song says all over the
[51:11] world the spirit is moving as the waters
[51:13] cover the Seas that's what God is not
[51:16] bound by boundaries Borders or anything
[51:19] like that so uh um you you will um
[51:24] you'll set you on high above all nations
[51:27] of the
[51:30] earth and all these blessings shall come
[51:32] on thee and overtake thee if thou shall
[51:35] hearen unto the voice of the Lord thy

[1:00:01] which the Lord swear unto thy fathers to
[1:00:03] give Thee the Lord shall open unto thee
[1:00:06] his good
[1:00:07] treasure the heaven to give the rain
[1:00:11] unto thy land in his season and to bless
[1:00:15] all the work of thine hand that's what
[1:00:17] it is that's where it is that's been the
[1:00:20] program all the time to bless the work
[1:00:22] of their hands he was still provide for
[1:00:24] them supernaturally but that's not the
[1:00:26] way he's going to do it every single day
[1:00:28] so that it's not until they see the
[1:00:30] supernatural Operation God is not with
[1:00:36] them the Lord shall open unto the his
[1:00:38] good treasure the heaven to give the
[1:00:39] rain unto the land in his season and to
[1:00:42] bless all the work of thine hand and
[1:00:45] thou shall lend unto many nations and
[1:00:47] thou shalt not
[1:00:49] borrow that's abundance amen that's
[1:00:53] prosperity
[1:01:00] like I say so prosperity for that's
[1:01:03] Bible Prosperity that's what Pentecost
[1:01:05] talk about get
[1:01:09] real this gospel here is not a
[1:01:13] Prosperity Gospel that's what
[1:01:14] Pentecostals do Prosperity Gospel the
[1:01:16] people are preaching and the preacher is
[1:01:19] preaching not all of them but generally
[1:01:21] that's the that's the the thing they're
[1:01:23] preaching and telling you think
[1:01:26] how you are going to get your abundance
[1:01:28] is like by Supernatural just ducts on
[1:01:32] your laps it doesn't work like that
[1:01:33] that's not scripture that's unscriptural
[1:01:35] it just drops on your lap so people are
[1:01:37] people are sowing SE and expecting
[1:01:39] something to just happen it doesn't work
[1:01:41] like that doesn't work like that it
[1:01:43] comes by the work of your
[1:01:46] hands Prosperity Gospel that they preach
[1:01:49] is um the preachers many times see the
[1:01:51] people as an ATM machine and to S seeds
[1:01:55] $1,000 $5,000 $2,000 and all that stuff
[1:01:58] and the preacher has all the money to
[1:02:00] himself and the people are there
[1:02:01] trusting God and for many of them one
[1:02:04] two here something might happen but many
[1:02:07] of them those things don't happen
[1:02:09] because it's not scriptural so I'm not
[1:02:11] talking about that kind of prosperity
[1:02:13] I'm talking about the gospel of the
[1:02:15] kingdom of Jesus Christ which says I
[1:02:17] wish above all things that you
[1:02:22] prosper and be in in good health even as
[1:02:28] thy soul prospers so we we lead with
[1:02:32] soul Prosperity first seek ye first the
[1:02:37] kingdom of God and its righteousness so
[1:02:40] your soul is prospering deep within
[1:02:44] you and Paul said above everything else
[1:02:48] I wish that you
[1:02:50] prosper in your natural Endeavors even
[1:02:52] as your soul
[1:02:55] prospers so that's where that's where
[1:02:56] we're coming from not Prosperity Gospel
[1:03:00] this the gospel of the Kingdom but it
[1:03:02] has prosperity in it
[1:03:06] amen because God promised in it to
[1:03:09] supply all your need and this is
[1:03:11] scripture here
[1:03:13] amen verse 13 and the Lord shall make
[1:03:16] Thee the head and not the tail and thou
[1:03:19] shall be above only and thou shallal not
[1:03:21] be beneath either thou her King unto to
[1:03:24] the Commandments of the Lord thy God

[1:03:40] any of The Words which I command thee
[1:03:43] this day to the right hand or to the
[1:03:46] left hand to go after all the gods to
[1:03:49] serve them that's Mammon amen the spirit
[1:03:52] of Mammon amen the Syrian God of
[1:03:56] riches people are so you know like all
[1:03:59] of all that just so focused on the
[1:04:02] riches career this that that that that
[1:04:04] those things are important but put them
[1:04:06] in their proper perspective that's what
[1:04:08] the that's what the gospel of the
[1:04:09] kingdom is amen all

[1:11:13] [Music]
[1:11:21] well amen amen thank you thank you amen
[1:11:26] God bless you may be
[1:11:31] seated you bless you um I'm sorry these
[1:11:35] are um bit about the church me is taking
[1:11:38] much much longer than I thought it would
[1:11:40] but I just feel um I feel impressed in
[1:11:44] the spirit
[1:11:45] to um just Che it all in so because I
[1:11:51] it's going to be about 2 3 weeks maximum
[1:11:53] four weeks but this is number seven
[1:11:56] now we trying to get you a background
[1:11:58] because um um we started off with the
[1:12:01] Israel the crisis they had in the
[1:12:05] promised land which they should not have
[1:12:07] been talking about any crisis in the
[1:12:08] promised land he took heat to all of
[1:12:10] these things that God told them all
[1:12:13] through the Wilderness years and
[1:12:15] especially the last 2 3 weeks and
[1:12:18] because all that happened in Deuteronomy
[1:12:20] took place in about two three weeks one
[1:12:22] two 3 weeks really and um Moses doing a
[1:12:25] review of the last 40 years with them
[1:12:29] and so that they'll know when they get
[1:12:31] the promise just to prepare them so that
[1:12:32] they will not fail in the promis land
[1:12:34] yet Israel still fail and that failure
[1:12:37] resulted in them going after the gods
[1:12:39] and that's another story Al together how
[1:12:41] the steps how those things happen and
[1:12:44] because nothing has changed because the
[1:12:46] devil sees it walk why why should he
[1:12:48] change the winning plan so he just does
[1:12:51] his thing over and over again it might
[1:12:52] come to fit the times the mo to
[1:12:56] modernize the things to Feit the times
[1:12:57] but you know we see the same thing so so
[1:12:59] anyway so um um so Israel had this
[1:13:02] crisis back and forth and about for
[1:13:04] about 320 years they had six periods of
[1:13:07] conquest and prosperity conquest and
[1:13:10] prosperity adury and all of that and
[1:13:12] things so that's what we have been
[1:13:13] talking about if you been here you know
[1:13:15] um that's what we been talking about try
[1:13:16] to get into history of the Bible to
[1:13:18] let's see what happen so trying to show
[1:13:20] you these were people who should not
[1:13:22] have failed at all and this was what had
[1:13:25] the promised land why should the land of
[1:13:28] that was supposed to be full of Plenty
[1:13:30] just suddenly become a land that is full
[1:13:32] of um land that is um um excuse me a
[1:13:37] land that is
[1:13:38] um um excuse
[1:13:41] me why should the Land of Plenty become
[1:13:44] a land of famine the land of Conquest
[1:13:46] why should it be but that's what
[1:13:48] happened and that's the story we've been
[1:13:49] trying to trying to follow um this past
[1:13:53] several weeks so anyway so
[1:13:57] um in preparing them for the promised
[1:13:59] land try to show you there were slaves
[1:14:02] in Egypt and um in the land of Egypt was
[1:14:05] a land of not enough and slaves don't
[1:14:08] get enough you are because you are the
[1:14:10] mercy of somebody else to give you your
[1:14:14] daily
[1:14:15] sustainance and they just give you what
[1:14:17] they think you are you deserve what they
[1:14:20] think should feel fill you feed you for
[1:14:22] the day and that's what they do
[1:14:23] and that's what slaves are and that's
[1:14:26] what they were in the promise I mean the
[1:14:28] in Egypt so when they're talking in
[1:14:30] Egypt about we go back to Egypt go back
[1:14:31] to Egypt go back to Egypt so you can see
[1:14:33] the mentality there see the mentality
[1:14:35] that just so so um don't consider so
[1:14:39] worthy of the great promise that God has
[1:14:41] given to them not because they don't
[1:14:43] think God is able but because they H
[1:14:46] they just don't have the faith to to um
[1:14:49] get there because they feel once god
[1:14:52] promise you just fall on your laps
[1:14:53] but for so many reasons it doesn't
[1:14:55] happen like that that's where we were uh
[1:14:57] um last week so so the in the promised
[1:15:00] in the wilderness they had they had just
[1:15:02] enough just enough and if you if you um
[1:15:07] um um if they try to preserve it for
[1:15:10] another day the Bible said it's PA God s
[1:15:14] you that the worms head it up and I'm
[1:15:17] saying have you ever seen people who
[1:15:20] make a lot of money a lot of money I
[1:15:22] mean not talk about people who have who
[1:15:25] win the lottery people who you know bet
[1:15:28] Niger and all those things that win a
[1:15:30] lot of money but it doesn't last
[1:15:32] something just happens some the worms
[1:15:35] just eat it up you can be left L of
[1:15:38] inheritance too the worms just ate up
[1:15:40] because you are Wilderness
[1:15:43] man you can't manage
[1:15:47] abundance you can manage abundance say I
[1:15:50] know this money can never finish you
[1:15:52] really
[1:15:54] don't trust in uncertain riches the
[1:15:57] Bible it's not
[1:15:59] certain
[1:16:00] so and all of those things are are are
[1:16:05] because the real way God wanted to bless
[1:16:08] them was to bless the work of their
[1:16:11] hands but if you notice he said the work
[1:16:14] of their hands but he also told them
[1:16:16] don't say the work of my hands have
[1:16:18] gotten me
[1:16:20] this here here here the the the the very
[1:16:24] quick solution let me just sh you that
[1:16:25] right away you're walking but your walk
[1:16:27] your hands cannot bring the
[1:16:29] increase it's the Lord that brings the
[1:16:32] increase so even though you walk it's
[1:16:34] healing but it requires you to work so
[1:16:37] that when it paes rain upon the Earth
[1:16:39] there will be something that you have
[1:16:40] for him on the earth here not just your
[1:16:43] hand in your pocket you know loafing
[1:16:45] around but it's not the work of your
[1:16:47] hands that gotten you anything anything
[1:16:49] at all all right so so that's where we
[1:16:52] were and so trying to show you the
[1:16:55] background of work work and so um so
[1:17:00] we'll pick a back with that story um
[1:17:02] that story today about work because
[1:17:07] um um we went all the way back to Adam
[1:17:11] and show that Adam actually had to work
[1:17:14] in the Garden of
[1:17:15] Eden how many believe
[1:17:18] that Adam had to walk in the Garden of
[1:17:20] Eden because that's the very purpose why
[1:17:22] he came to came on Earth that's why
[1:17:24] we're here walk is not a result of the
[1:17:28] Fall walk was here before the fall and
[1:17:30] I'll show you and I I'll just try to you
[1:17:33] know talk with you talk to you and um um
[1:17:36] so um but when the fall came Adam did
[1:17:40] the same work still if you if you read
[1:17:43] the Bible Genesis 2 Genesis 3 it was
[1:17:45] still to teal the
[1:17:47] ground same instruction before the fall
[1:17:50] as after the fall but just the circum is
[1:17:53] changed and we'll try and get into that
[1:17:55] a little bit
[1:17:57] today but really the original work was
[1:18:00] with God himself hallu God
[1:18:04] himself was the first one that thought
[1:18:07] up the idea of work and worked because I
[1:18:10] mean all of our children know from in
[1:18:13] this church here from when they very
[1:18:14] small Elohim and what the work of
[1:18:18] creation that's work so God was the
[1:18:23] first one that did work this was a a God
[1:18:27] that
[1:18:28] worked a God that went to work that was
[1:18:32] the god of
[1:18:34] Israel go the Bible in the beginning God
[1:18:36] created that creative work that creative
[1:18:39] act is work the Bible started with God
[1:18:44] working you see God
[1:18:46] working so go work is not a result of
[1:18:49] the
[1:18:51] Fall what is as old as this world and
[1:18:56] the universe is because when the
[1:18:59] worldall burst on the scene the universe
[1:19:01] B of the sin Genesis 1:1 we find God
[1:19:03] walking in the in the in the in the
[1:19:06] beginning God created the Heaven and the
[1:19:11] Earth and Genesis 2:2 also says that God
[1:19:15] saw all the work that he had made and
[1:19:19] behold it was very good and God rested
[1:19:23] from all his work that he had made so
[1:19:27] work at all is the very idea of of work
[1:19:29] so you little kids or older kids older
[1:19:33] people my age younger than me older than
[1:19:36] me what is not about your boss it's not
[1:19:40] about your mom making you do more you
[1:19:42] should do or your dad what is God's idea
[1:19:45] in the first instance can you say
[1:19:48] amen
[1:19:50] amen so because it originated from God
[1:19:54] and God is a spirit God is spiritual
[1:19:57] because work originated from God work is
[1:20:01] a spiritual
[1:20:02] thing what is not a natural Canal thing
[1:20:06] work is spiritual can you say Amen what
[1:20:10] is a spiritual thing
[1:20:17] amen I told you last week
[1:20:20] that Adam was able to EXP Express his
[1:20:24] his attributes the qualities the
[1:20:26] potential in him through the Avenue of
[1:20:27] work where is that coming from from
[1:20:30] God because it was through the Avenue of
[1:20:33] work that God was able to express his
[1:20:37] characteristics his qualities his
[1:20:40] attributes it was when he walked that it
[1:20:43] came out work of creation his creative
[1:20:46] path came out work of redemption intive
[1:20:48] attributes came
[1:20:51] out
[1:20:53] in the creation work allowed God to
[1:20:55] express his attribute of
[1:20:59] Creator work what is an opportunity to
[1:21:02] express something that's that's hidden
[1:21:05] on the inside something that's boxed in
[1:21:06] on the inside of you something that
[1:21:08] cannot come out what is an outlet to let
[1:21:11] it flow out
[1:21:15] amen and in the Redemption of man also
[1:21:18] for those of you are very spiritual very
[1:21:19] spiritual what is he talking about in
[1:21:20] the Redemption of man also what
[1:21:23] also brought out the attribute of
[1:21:26] Redeemer in
[1:21:28] him that's why he sent his son he came
[1:21:31] down himself down from his glory
[1:21:34] everling story my God and savior came
[1:21:37] and Jesus was his name born in a manger
[1:21:40] to his own a stranger
[1:21:45] amen walk brought out God's attribute of
[1:21:49] Redeemer and Jesus alluded to this when
[1:21:51] he said
[1:21:53] my father WTH hither to and I
[1:21:59] work they asked him what must we do that
[1:22:02] he might work the works of God said this
[1:22:06] is the work of God that you believe on
[1:22:09] him whom he has sent so God is the
[1:22:11] worker God the one that
[1:22:16] [Applause]
[1:22:21] works Jesus said to
[1:22:25] them it's not me that doeth the works
[1:22:28] but my Father which dwelleth in me he do
[1:22:30] the works if you can't believe me
[1:22:33] believe me for the very Works
[1:22:36] sake
[1:22:38] work work can you go on your job and say
[1:22:42] believe me for the very Works
[1:22:46] sake
[1:22:48] work so God expressed all his great
[1:22:51] attributes
[1:22:54] all his Essence the essence of God love
[1:22:57] the essence of God he Express all that
[1:22:59] through the Avenue of
[1:23:02] work therefore I'm sure you can see that
[1:23:06] already that Jesus also fulfill his own
[1:23:09] life's purpose to redeem Mankind through
[1:23:12] the Avenue of
[1:23:13] work when they met him at the um his um
[1:23:17] Mary and Joseph were looking for him
[1:23:18] when they went to the for the census and
[1:23:21] they men said like
[1:23:23] son where have you been your father and
[1:23:25] I I've been looking for you he said I've
[1:23:27] been
[1:23:29] working must I not be about my father's
[1:23:32] business my father's
[1:23:34] work and brother bam said even that line
[1:23:36] showed like that he was telling he was
[1:23:38] rebuking Mary in a very gentle way how
[1:23:41] can you call that Joseph my
[1:23:45] father my father is God I come from God
[1:23:48] I go back to God again you know that and
[1:23:50] I must be I'm but B say if Joseph was
[1:23:53] his father Joseph's business was the
[1:23:55] carpenter shop and he should be in the
[1:23:58] carpenter shop at that time even though
[1:24:00] he work in Joseph's car but he said
[1:24:02] right here I'm talking with these people
[1:24:04] here I'm being about my father's work
[1:24:11] amen so Jesus could only fulfill his
[1:24:15] life's calling through the Avenue of
[1:24:17] work and so did Adam and so will you and
[1:24:21] I
[1:24:23] the only way you are going to be able to
[1:24:25] feel your last coin is who they have in
[1:24:27] your work where you have a problem is
[1:24:29] that because you look at work as a very
[1:24:30] natural kind of thing I'm that work is
[1:24:32] spiritual I just show you that Jesus is
[1:24:34] saying all he came here to do was work
[1:24:37] Healing The Sick raising the Dead all
[1:24:39] that was work God creating the world you
[1:24:42] want you want to speak into into
[1:24:44] existence that's work work hallah so
[1:24:48] because sometime we get very spiritual
[1:24:51] very spiritual like that
[1:24:53] I'm like the berans I'm checking what
[1:24:55] they're saying um I'm welcome that
[1:24:57] anytime
[1:25:09] anytime you got to help me this thing
[1:25:11] keeps poing off on me I don't
[1:25:15] know what's going on
[1:25:19] here okay all right
[1:25:22] uh I grw
[1:25:27] up so anyway so
[1:25:31] um so Adam like Jesus you know fulfilled
[1:25:35] his purpose here through the Avenue of
[1:25:42] work Adam like God his father had
[1:25:45] attributes like I said brok up on the
[1:25:47] inside of him potential talents
[1:25:50] qualities that were on the inside of him
[1:25:52] but they needed expression and Outlet to
[1:25:55] come
[1:25:56] out it's not by doing prayer is always
[1:26:00] part of it but it's not by doing prayer
[1:26:01] that the attributes come out it
[1:26:05] work God could just stay there and just
[1:26:08] dream it and the world will come into
[1:26:10] existence he didn't have to get up from
[1:26:12] his majesty and actually do the
[1:26:16] work
[1:26:21] work
[1:26:23] so just like God had attributes in him
[1:26:26] that needed to be released through work
[1:26:27] need to be expressed they could only
[1:26:29] find expression through work Adam the
[1:26:32] same thing you and I the same
[1:26:39] thing so it was in order that these
[1:26:42] qualities and these attributes could be
[1:26:44] expressed that God designed and created
[1:26:47] work that's why work is
[1:26:50] spiritual not Canal there's nothing
[1:26:53] Canal comes from God all good and
[1:26:55] perfect things come from God work is a
[1:26:58] spiritual thing and when you understand
[1:27:01] that today if you've never understood
[1:27:04] it your param ship will totally
[1:27:07] revolutionize your life every single
[1:27:10] minute of every single day let me say
[1:27:13] that again if you will hon understand
[1:27:16] what I'm saying here to to you today
[1:27:18] about
[1:27:19] work your Paradigm will so shift in
[1:27:22] other words your warv is so shift it
[1:27:24] will
[1:27:25] totally revolutionize your life and
[1:27:29] upgrade it to a totally different
[1:27:32] another level can you say Amen a I know
[1:27:36] you don't believe that but say Amen all
[1:27:37] the same
[1:27:39] amen
[1:27:43] hallelujah um last Su um jelle told me
[1:27:48] that have you left the
[1:27:51] wilderness said you say you're a very
[1:27:53] nauy
[1:27:54] girl that was a good one that was a very
[1:27:56] good
[1:27:57] [Laughter]
[1:28:00] one and then I heard one of the young
[1:28:02] Brothers said that to another person and
[1:28:05] said like so when I come to church
[1:28:06] please nobody should ask me for anything
[1:28:09] because I'm still in the
[1:28:11] wilderness I have just
[1:28:13] enough in the wilderness that's where I
[1:28:16] am I don't I'm not in the land of
[1:28:17] abundance just enough and I said we'll
[1:28:20] get into it we'll get into it
[1:28:22] that just enough
[1:28:25] includes what you give to other
[1:28:30] people because it is more blessed to
[1:28:32] give than to
[1:28:34] receive so go back to that brother and
[1:28:38] tell
[1:28:39] him that even in the wilderness go read
[1:28:42] all through the Old Testament years in
[1:28:44] the wilderness years how you turn out to
[1:28:45] treat the stranger and all that and
[1:28:47] things like that right so it's not just
[1:28:50] enough like I me and myself for me my
[1:28:53] son and my daughter and I mean me and my
[1:28:55] wife my children my grandchildren no
[1:29:00] no is not
[1:29:02] that for them what you
[1:29:05] eat will get you all of
[1:29:08] that but what you give
[1:29:10] also nobody say so did you hear said
[1:29:14] like that you got to give not that the
[1:29:16] Bible has an answer for that you lazy go
[1:29:19] to the ants you Slugger go to the an and
[1:29:22] go work if any man will not work let him
[1:29:25] not eat amen the Bible is too balanced
[1:29:28] too balanced to
[1:29:31] balance so relax nobody's going to take
[1:29:34] advantage of anybody nobody's going to
[1:29:35] take advantage of you nobody amen all
[1:29:47] right so like God Adam's work but is
[1:29:50] potential his
[1:29:52] talents and um his greatness his
[1:29:56] attributes and his
[1:29:57] greatness because God himself that's
[1:29:59] what brought out his attributes work and
[1:30:04] every attribute Son of God of which Adam
[1:30:06] was the first Express attribut son work
[1:30:09] is to bring out the potential their
[1:30:11] greatness is locked up inside of them
[1:30:14] but work needs to bring it
[1:30:15] out is not prophesying that brings it
[1:30:18] out is not whatever that brings it out
[1:30:20] work
[1:30:25] so you understand therefore for Genesis
[1:30:26] 1 12628 and I'll read it and God said
[1:30:30] let us make man in our image after our
[1:30:33] likeness and let them let them have
[1:30:36] dominion over the fish of the sea and
[1:30:38] over the foul of the air and over the
[1:30:40] cattle and over all the
[1:30:43] Earth and over every creeping thing that
[1:30:46] creeped upon the
[1:30:48] Earth that's the
[1:30:50] potential
[1:30:53] Dominion then verse 27 he said so God
[1:30:56] created man his own image in the image
[1:30:58] of God created in male and female qu he
[1:31:00] them verse 28 and God blessed them and
[1:31:04] God said unto
[1:31:06] them be
[1:31:09] fruitful just like Deuteronomy 8 give
[1:31:13] them the
[1:31:15] grand uh Grand picture JY 28 he broke it
[1:31:20] down for them
[1:31:22] 8 that milk and hone is in the Landy 28
[1:31:26] he broke down for them what constitutes
[1:31:28] the milk and
[1:31:29] honey the same way here Genesis 28 is
[1:31:32] breaking down for them what constitutes
[1:31:34] this
[1:31:36] Dominion you have the PO verse 26 you
[1:31:39] have the
[1:31:40] potential as a man woman born girl in
[1:31:43] the image of God to do be dominant over
[1:31:46] everything on the face of the
[1:31:49] Earth but this is going to come about
[1:31:52] verse 28 and God blessed them and God
[1:31:55] said unto them be fruitful and multiply
[1:31:58] and replenish the Earth and subdue it
[1:32:01] when you do all four then you'll have
[1:32:05] dominion Dominion is a result of doing
[1:32:08] all four you don't going to say I'm
[1:32:09] going to have dominion I'm going to have
[1:32:10] dominion no that's not how it comes how
[1:32:12] Dominion comes that you are fruitful
[1:32:15] multiply subdue I mean replenish subdue
[1:32:18] when you put it all together is it
[1:32:21] called
[1:32:22] Dominion can you say amen
[1:32:28] amen in other words this is how you P
[1:32:31] the Dominion potential you have this is
[1:32:33] how it comes out start being fruitful
[1:32:37] multiplying replenishing
[1:32:42] subduing I can show you the strategies
[1:32:45] of the biggest corporations in the world
[1:32:48] the most successful corporations through
[1:32:49] human history from the there from the
[1:32:52] words of Jesus Jesus deployed the same
[1:32:55] thing when he told them go into all the
[1:32:57] worldall and preach the gospel beginning
[1:32:59] at
[1:33:00] Jerusalem into Samaria to Judea onto the
[1:33:04] uttermost parts of the
[1:33:06] earth begin at Jerusalem
[1:33:09] fruitful into Judea multiply into Sam
[1:33:13] into
[1:33:15] Samaria
[1:33:16] replenish to the uttermost parts of the
[1:33:19] Earth subd Dom you in do you dominate
[1:33:23] the whole place Hallelujah same thing
[1:33:25] same
[1:33:27] principle orans are very spiritual very
[1:33:30] spiritual and we get cheated in many in
[1:33:32] so many ways you use I'll show you that
[1:33:34] in your home in your relationship with
[1:33:37] your little child your little
[1:33:42] baby so we don't need to live so
[1:33:48] disempowered and think unless I have
[1:33:50] this connection nothing's going to
[1:33:52] happen for me there's nothing like that
[1:33:53] it's not
[1:33:54] true I'll show you how I told you before
[1:33:57] but I'll show you again how to get the
[1:33:59] connection you
[1:34:00] need which connection did Ruth
[1:34:07] have how but Ruth follow these
[1:34:10] principles and and how to gain favor
[1:34:14] with both God and
[1:34:20] man
[1:34:24] hallah so Genesis 126 was the
[1:34:27] potential and that's your spiritual SE
[1:34:29] come from God your potential to dominate
[1:34:32] to for greatness for success to manifest
[1:34:36] a son in God's image dominion over all
[1:34:39] the Earth that's potential that's your
[1:34:41] talent that's your your
[1:34:44] gift that's your spiritual SE from God
[1:34:47] is also your talent your
[1:34:49] gift in the spiritual as well as the
[1:34:51] natural because the Bible says but unto
[1:34:54] every one of us is given Grace according
[1:34:56] to the measure of the gift of Christ
[1:34:58] Ephesians 4:7 every one of us is G every
[1:35:02] single one is given Grace according to
[1:35:05] the gift of Christ that's why when the
[1:35:09] parable Jesus said he called his Serv
[1:35:11] together and gave each one of them
[1:35:14] gifts as they had talent I mean
[1:35:17] according to their several ability he
[1:35:19] said he gave one five times one two and
[1:35:23] 1 one but he gave all of his
[1:35:27] servants and told them go and invested
[1:35:29] and until I come
[1:35:31] back do you know that Jesus spoke more
[1:35:35] about Investments about money that he
[1:35:38] talk about prayer Jesus had 38 Parables
[1:35:41] I think 38 Parables 16 of them were
[1:35:44] about money 16 of 38 about money you
[1:35:48] know investing and all of that in the
[1:35:50] Bible
[1:36:04] so Genesis 1:26 everybody you consider
[1:36:07] yourself a child of God you are there
[1:36:09] even if you're not a child of God he
[1:36:11] made man in his own image male and
[1:36:13] female created
[1:36:14] e
[1:36:15] everybody in of spiritual they might not
[1:36:18] have spiritualy but they have natural
[1:36:20] potential every man every man but as a
[1:36:23] child of God you have an additional
[1:36:24] thing the seed of God is there the
[1:36:26] potential to be a Christian to be a
[1:36:27] child of God and is that potential
[1:36:29] that's walking up when you come and
[1:36:30] receive Christ and that seed is walking
[1:36:34] up and you become a Christian and that
[1:36:37] it is thir for the baptism of the Holy
[1:36:40] Ghost that's what wakes up your sin and
[1:36:43] your potential you see like you somebody
[1:36:45] who was like in church when they're
[1:36:47] talking in church they disinterested
[1:36:49] that he gets woking up you see them
[1:36:51] they're all over the place they're on
[1:36:52] fire so when I see these young folks
[1:36:54] they you know with their attitude and
[1:36:56] some of the things and some of these
[1:36:57] kids raised up in church and see the
[1:36:59] nastiness of the attitude I don't bother
[1:37:00] myself with them I just pray that God
[1:37:03] God send the fire to to to burn up the
[1:37:06] seed and the soul to to wake that seed
[1:37:09] up when that seed wakes up nobody's
[1:37:12] going to be able to stop you here nobody
[1:37:14] can stop you here your father your
[1:37:16] mother nobody can stop you amen
[1:37:20] amen
[1:37:24] [Applause]
[1:37:30] and then Genesis 128 I said is years but
[1:37:33] let me just say it again Genesis 12 128
[1:37:34] was the
[1:37:35] expression the expression of the
[1:37:38] Dominion by fruitful multiply replenish
[1:37:42] sub deal in other
[1:37:44] words between Genesis 126 potential and
[1:37:49] Genesis 1 128 achievement
[1:37:52] between those two was
[1:37:55] work because in Adam was locked up
[1:37:59] potential
[1:38:00] characteristics H H uh qualities gifts
[1:38:05] talents and he's trying to go to Genesis
[1:38:08] 128 to be fruitful being Dominion walk
[1:38:11] is the Avenue the vehicle that will take
[1:38:13] him there
[1:38:17] amen God had potential locked up in him
[1:38:21] characteristics attributes and he
[1:38:24] couldn't come out until God began to do
[1:38:26] the work of creation he was God but he
[1:38:27] could never be called a cre God until he
[1:38:31] created
[1:38:34] angels
[1:38:36] work predating even the Earth here work
[1:38:40] that's all God is
[1:38:44] about in heaven those H H uh 4 and2
[1:38:47] Elders what do they do they're walking
[1:38:49] Night and Day rush shiping God night and
[1:38:52] day night and day that's why people
[1:38:54] consider coming to church is a waste of
[1:38:55] their time they're going to work and
[1:38:57] they you see their scale of priorities
[1:38:59] work is above the things of God because
[1:39:02] the their job is work but this here is
[1:39:05] like
[1:39:06] a not not a hobby you take some of some
[1:39:09] of them take plain chairs more serious
[1:39:10] than that what they call now like a
[1:39:13] extracurricular activity that doesn't
[1:39:16] fetch you
[1:39:18] anything that's how the view work this
[1:39:21] is
[1:39:27] work the the the the richest man that
[1:39:30] ever
[1:39:31] lived
[1:39:35] Solomon the smartest the wisest man that
[1:39:38] ever lived
[1:39:39] Solomon they they they they adjusted for
[1:39:43] today's inflation and all that they said
[1:39:45] was like worth about a trillion dollars
[1:39:46] nobody knows that but everybody agrees
[1:39:48] he was the wealthiest man that ever
[1:39:50] lived
[1:39:51] it said in ecclesiast 62 let us listen
[1:39:54] to the conclusion of the whole
[1:39:58] matter serve
[1:40:01] God when you see somebody is serving you
[1:40:03] they're having a party with you no they
[1:40:04] are working for you serve God and keep
[1:40:07] his Commandments for this is the whole
[1:40:10] Duty work of man so we are here
[1:40:16] working can you say
[1:40:19] Amen so when you do that like that when
[1:40:22] you do that like like that like that who
[1:40:24] are you you if you're not working for
[1:40:26] god well you got somebody El you're
[1:40:27] working for that's right it's either one
[1:40:31] or the other there's no neutral anything
[1:40:32] here you either working for God Jesus
[1:40:34] said if they are not against me they
[1:40:36] must be for me which was why when the
[1:40:38] people were not in their Camp preaching
[1:40:40] Jesus and they let's stop them you just
[1:40:42] said no they don't have to be in our
[1:40:44] camp if they're not against me they must
[1:40:46] be for me somehow let them
[1:40:48] alone they're working for God because
[1:40:51] either working for God or working for
[1:40:52] the enemy but you want to work for the
[1:40:54] Enemy No I must walk while there is day
[1:40:58] Jesus said for the night cometh when no
[1:41:00] man can walk when you are here in church
[1:41:02] walk let your voice be heard shout sing
[1:41:05] dance Rejoice let the devil know who

[1:43:29] potential
[1:43:30] and the
[1:43:33] expression Genesis 12
[1:43:36] 128 is
[1:43:38] work without work like I said last week
[1:43:41] potential is just that
[1:43:43] potential Talent that's all very
[1:43:45] talented have you seen many people who
[1:43:47] had talent and they man to nothing I'm
[1:43:50] sure many people like
[1:43:51] that Talent some of the if you have an
[1:43:55] IQ right now I mean right IQ 150 I mean

[1:44:58] are some girls so that's the problem in
[1:45:01] Nigeria just spend spend
[1:45:03] spend know how to
[1:45:06] create but you are creators we are
[1:45:08] breaking off that Spirit we are creators
[1:45:11] we are breaking off that
[1:45:12] [Applause]
[1:45:18] spirit so want to make in all of these
[1:45:21] years that to show you like that work
[1:45:22] has always been an integral part of the
[1:45:24] purpose and plan of God both for himself
[1:45:28] and for his creation
[1:45:30] mankind so because it originate from go
[1:45:33] from God
[1:45:35] work can be said to be more spiritual in
[1:45:38] nature than
[1:45:39] natural and we human beings may be temp
[1:45:42] to think what is natural like I've been
[1:45:44] saying but work is spiritual as you see
[1:45:47] for what we're talking about work is
[1:45:48] Godly to work is to be Godlike like your
[1:45:52] father in Heaven that's why the Bible
[1:45:55] has so strong words for he who will not
[1:45:58] walk let him not eat he will not walk
[1:46:01] and provide for his family is worse than
[1:46:05] Infidel if you are Gods you want to be
[1:46:08] like your father you
[1:46:10] work
[1:46:12] amen oh brother are you enjoying
[1:46:16] this
[1:46:19] m
[1:46:22] be therefore perfect as your father in
[1:46:24] Heaven is perfect work takes you to that
[1:46:26] route work on your knees in prayer
[1:46:29] getting the Holy Ghost work amen coming
[1:46:32] to church serving him and going in the
[1:46:35] marketplace going in the marketplace on
[1:46:37] your job and doing the same thing
[1:46:38] excelling there like your father in
[1:46:40] Heaven
[1:46:47] work so walk if it's spiritual like I'm
[1:46:51] talking about if it comes from God and
[1:46:53] God gives you the work to be able to
[1:46:55] bring out what's in you work therefore
[1:46:58] can be said to be a Ministry of
[1:47:01] shorts Ministry of
[1:47:05] ss why Ministry because work is a
[1:47:08] calling that you are responsible to God
[1:47:13] for why a Ministry because work is an
[1:47:16] undertaking where you serve
[1:47:19] God so his purpose for the different
[1:47:22] stages of your life can come forth can
[1:47:26] be
[1:47:27] expressed and be made manifest displayed
[1:47:29] before the world it's you and God Alone
[1:47:33] he gave you that work to express it what
[1:47:37] he put on the inside of you from the
[1:47:39] Cradle to the
[1:47:41] Grave work is a Ministry of no wonder
[1:47:44] the Bible says Ephesians 4:12 I believe
[1:47:48] it speaks on the work of of the
[1:47:52] ministry amen or you think just the
[1:47:55] pastor and evangelist no work of the
[1:47:56] ministry everybody your ministry have
[1:47:58] you the song leader is he a Min is he a
[1:48:00] minister no you said in Ministry in
[1:48:02] Songs the corus is he a minister no
[1:48:05] listen choruses Ministry prayer leader
[1:48:09] Ministry amen doesn't make him a
[1:48:12] minister there's a fful Ministry but
[1:48:14] there's also you know other Ministry
[1:48:17] offices
[1:48:19] amen
[1:48:21] amen can you say amen amen you're
[1:48:24] looking
[1:48:28] stunned what's wrong with them they're
[1:48:29] looking stunned they have no idea all
[1:48:39] right so what is a Ministry a Ministry
[1:48:42] simply sign simp signifies a
[1:48:45] service don't look at Nigerian because
[1:48:47] the Min people are sh to be ministers in
[1:48:49] Niger so they can eat they can go there
[1:48:52] and chop
[1:48:55] money but a Min a minister
[1:49:01] serves a Ministry
[1:49:04] serves that's it is from the
[1:49:07] Bible the
[1:49:10] Bible whatever you call it Minister
[1:49:12] commissioner whatever they're supposed
[1:49:14] to serve so what a Ministry signify
[1:49:17] service to God and to man
[1:49:21] so with this understanding that work is
[1:49:24] a is is Ministry it becomes easy to
[1:49:27] appreciate that Every Man Has a
[1:49:30] calling a call of God every man woman
[1:49:33] boy and girl has a calling a call of God
[1:49:36] upon your life a Ministry not fful
[1:49:40] Minister but a Ministry a calling from
[1:49:43] God that God want to serve him in so
[1:49:45] that what is put on the inside of you
[1:49:46] can come
[1:49:49] out
[1:49:51] you have a Ministry in the work that God
[1:49:53] has called you to
[1:49:54] do and like I said already the parable
[1:49:57] of italent shows that gave them each one
[1:49:59] of them you know
[1:50:03] talents according to their several
[1:50:04] ability to go and profit with
[1:50:07] it you know what the Bible
[1:50:09] says First Corinthians 1 Corinthians 12
[1:50:12] I think it is he said unto every one of
[1:50:14] us given Grace of the gift of chist that
[1:50:17] we might profit without
[1:50:21] Jesus gave them gifts and told them to
[1:50:22] go and profit with it
[1:50:25] amen same thing don't sleep now too
[1:50:28] early to sleep you got to hear this
[1:50:30] devil is trying to cheat you if you
[1:50:31] don't hear this got you you got to wake
[1:50:33] up wake up put a put a what do you call
[1:50:36] it toothpick right you know so you got
[1:50:40] some put a toothpick between your eyeb
[1:50:43] your eyelids so you can stay
[1:50:49] awake
[1:50:52] so with this understand that work is
[1:50:53] Ministry we're getting
[1:50:55] somewhere this understanding not only
[1:50:57] highlights the importance of
[1:50:59] work also brings on a total paradigm
[1:51:03] shift in the way that you view
[1:51:05] work and when you understand that it
[1:51:08] totally totally affects the the
[1:51:12] dedication and the
[1:51:14] seriousness with which we should carry
[1:51:17] out our work whatever work we do
[1:51:21] work of a mother father boss you know
[1:51:25] preacher you
[1:51:27] know cleaner
[1:51:31] whatever Romans 12 puts together this
[1:51:37] understanding Romans 12:11 says not
[1:51:40] slothful in business fervent in spirit
[1:51:44] serving the
[1:51:46] lord so when you're doing your business
[1:51:48] you are in service to the Lord so when
[1:51:50] you go to your work on Monday morning
[1:51:52] you are in
[1:51:53] service when you come to church on
[1:51:55] Sunday morning you are in
[1:51:57] service not slothful in business fing in
[1:52:01] spirit serving the
[1:52:07] lord and that's why work should be done
[1:52:10] with all feny and devotion as unto the
[1:52:14] Lord fing in your
[1:52:16] work because you recognize that it's a
[1:52:19] service to the Lord am and because you
[1:52:22] are in service to the Lord you are
[1:52:23] serving the lord as you work it makes it
[1:52:26] clear that Jesus is your true
[1:52:29] boss is your true
[1:52:35] boss because it lets you recognize that
[1:52:37] it's him that placed the talents in
[1:52:41] you the attributes the
[1:52:44] characteristics that will only be
[1:52:46] expressed through the Avenue of that
[1:52:48] work that you call your job I hate that
[1:52:52] job Jesus put you
[1:52:55] there and he's your boss I can't stand
[1:52:58] my boss what you can't stand
[1:53:01] Jesus not slothful in
[1:53:04] business fing in spirit serving your
[1:53:08] boss serving the lord and Jesus is your
[1:53:18] boss w
[1:53:21] so there in lies the real purpose of
[1:53:25] work to bring out um build up the jewel
[1:53:29] that's in you the gem the goal the
[1:53:33] character the manifestation of God's
[1:53:36] purpose at that particular period of
[1:53:38] time in your
[1:53:40] life amen so when you
[1:53:43] are you are like going to school you at
[1:53:47] work that's why I teach a early to serve
[1:53:50] the Lord so that when they're in school
[1:53:51] they're serving the lord not slothful in
[1:53:55] school hanging out with the boys and
[1:53:57] girls and doing all kinds of stupid
[1:53:59] things because until they get to church
[1:54:01] before they're in
[1:54:03] service but they recognize even when
[1:54:05] they in their classroom learning 1 + 1
[1:54:07] equals 2 they're serving the lord
[1:54:11] they're in service to the
[1:54:12] Lord the Headmaster is not their boss
[1:54:15] Jesus is the boss even if the head
[1:54:17] Master says do some things they know
[1:54:18] Jesus doesn't want they say no my boss
[1:54:20] wouldn't want me to do this I cannot do
[1:54:27] it can you say amen
[1:54:29] amen
[1:54:31] amen I'm unemployed it's not

[1:56:50] you may be

[1:56:55] everpresent boss he's your
[1:56:58] supervisor he's the one who looks in and
[1:57:01] sees to it that you actually are doing
[1:57:04] the work that you are called and paid to
[1:57:07] do even he doesn't carry a pay the work
[1:57:09] you are called to do he's the one that
[1:57:11] looks in supervises he checking it up
[1:57:16] amen and that's what like he did with
[1:57:18] Adam
[1:57:23] Genesis
[1:57:24] 2:19 and out of the ground the Lord got
[1:57:27] formed every beast of the field and
[1:57:30] every foul of the air and brought them
[1:57:32] onto Adam to work to see what he would
[1:57:36] call
[1:57:38] them I don't have to do some mind work
[1:57:41] some brain
[1:57:43] work God brought you him to see what he
[1:57:46] will call
[1:57:47] them give him the work and God standing
[1:57:50] there trying to see that the work is
[1:57:53] getting
[1:57:55] done the everpresent
[1:57:59] supervisor who is checking you out Eric
[1:58:02] you really must have had a tough night
[1:58:04] right about a really tough
[1:58:07] night wake
[1:58:11] up will Adam do this work all these
[1:58:14] animals here see all of these animals
[1:58:15] here all of them name them and classify
[1:58:18] them well dress it and keep it you know
[1:58:20] that word dressing you know when you
[1:58:21] trying to make a dress what are you
[1:58:23] doing that's creative that's creative
[1:58:27] Powers dress this Garden keep it we'll
[1:58:30] get into
[1:58:33] that so God told Adam these animals s
[1:58:37] them out and and give them a name and
[1:58:40] all that things like that and you just
[1:58:42] do it and take
[1:58:43] off he's there supervision what they're
[1:58:47] doing is not a busy like I said many
[1:58:50] times do this he gave him a chance
[1:58:51] because if you're going to He Man
[1:58:52] accountable got to give him a chance to
[1:58:54] express him and do the work the way he
[1:58:56] feels his best to do or you can't if if
[1:58:58] he's doing just at do this do this and
[1:59:00] you can't blame him for the
[1:59:02] results so if a man is going to be held
[1:59:04] accountable then go to give him
[1:59:06] responsibility you got to let him be so
[1:59:09] God let Adam be but gave him the work
[1:59:11] but God was a supervisor supervising all
[1:59:13] of these things I tell you all time this
[1:59:15] is the only book you need on this Earth
[1:59:17] here the Bible the Bible
[1:59:20] is the only book you need need no other
[1:59:23] book okay you shouldn't go to school I'm
[1:59:25] not saying
[1:59:27] that I'm I'm baiting you I'm baiting you
[1:59:30] I just know he's going somewhere I just
[1:59:33] hear what he's saying he's trying to say
[1:59:34] something he's trying something I'm not
[1:59:35] saying
[1:59:38] anything what I'm saying is that every
[1:59:40] truth comes from this
[1:59:42] Bible because God wrote the Bible I mean
[1:59:45] gave us the word to know how we should
[1:59:47] live on the face of this Earth here and
[1:59:50] man has dug into it and brought out
[1:59:53] principles of Life principles principles
[1:59:55] and I'll show you some today my time is
[1:59:57] already gone so I don't I don't know I
[1:59:58] don't want to worry you because some of
[2:00:01] these men are making faces at me like
[2:00:04] that and it's not a good sign when men
[2:00:06] are making faces at you like that it's
[2:00:08] not a good
[2:00:10] sign but the girls hardly sleep like
[2:00:12] that really a
[2:00:13] boys visual in this church is a
[2:00:17] boys so
[2:00:21] and brought them onto Adam to see what
[2:00:22] he will call them and what whatsoever
[2:00:25] Adam called every living creature that
[2:00:27] was a name
[2:00:29] thereof he told
[2:00:31] Adam name them and I named them and God
[2:00:34] looked into his name them that's that's
[2:00:35] okay that's okay that's okay Adam just
[2:00:37] like God took Moses onto the mountain
[2:00:39] and showed him how the the Tabernacle
[2:00:42] every going to be all the laws all the
[2:00:45] drapes all the things the Tabernacle the
[2:00:47] UR thring and God told Moses that is
[2:00:50] your job to make
[2:00:53] sure that the things are done among the
[2:00:57] people like I have shown you on top of
[2:00:59] the
[2:01:00] mountain the real boss it seemed to it

[2:06:16] a chance when you lift your today you'll
[2:06:17] continue in service still with the Lord
[2:06:20] Jesus Christ you view work time not as
[2:06:24] time to be wasted rather it's time that
[2:06:28] God has given you to work towards
[2:06:29] building
[2:06:31] your
[2:06:33] character because character is on the
[2:06:35] inside of you he wants to come out walk
[2:06:37] wants to bring it out so you see work
[2:06:39] when you get to work and that boss is so
[2:06:42] nasty you feel cheated on your
[2:06:45] job there's gospel around you what you
[2:06:49] supposed to do let it bring us something
[2:06:51] let it bring us some virtues let bring
[2:06:53] some godliness in you some power some
[2:06:56] virtue on the inside of you so that work
[2:06:58] actually is building you character that
[2:07:01] work actually is giving you building
[2:07:03] value on the inside of you oh God help
[2:07:06] me oh
[2:07:09] brother I'm taking too much time
[2:07:11] explaining this new over and over but I
[2:07:13] just want I just want make sure you'll
[2:07:14] get it amen so you Vi work time not as
[2:07:18] time to be wasted but time that you have
[2:07:21] given to God I mean God that time that
[2:07:23] God has given you to work out your
[2:07:27] salvation with fear and trembling to
[2:07:30] work towards building your character
[2:07:32] growing your potential growing your
[2:07:34] value all the while working amen toward
[2:07:39] your life
[2:07:40] purpose both in life and godliness the
[2:07:43] potential that God placed in you before
[2:07:45] the foundation of the world this
[2:07:47] understand that work is Ministry gives
[2:07:49] work a whole other meaning a whole brand
[2:07:53] new
[2:07:55] meaning this understand lets you
[2:07:57] understand know that whatever work it is
[2:08:00] that you do it is the Lord himself who
[2:08:03] has described the outcomes the
[2:08:06] deliverables that your work should
[2:08:09] produce simply what the outcome what's
[2:08:12] on the inside he wants you to come out
[2:08:14] that's the outcome he's looking for he's
[2:08:16] not looking for your paycheck whatever
[2:08:17] that's not what he's talking about
[2:08:21] so the biggest thing you take home from
[2:08:24] your workplace is not your is not the
[2:08:26] size of your pay packet that's that's
[2:08:27] important but that's
[2:08:29] secondary your pay packet will not
[2:08:31] increase if you don't understand this
[2:08:34] I'm telling
[2:08:35] you so the B the biggest thing the main
[2:08:39] thing you take from work home from
[2:08:41] work is the person you are
[2:08:44] becoming it's the character that is
[2:08:46] coming out of you
[2:08:49] that's the that's the greatest thing you
[2:08:50] take home from your workplace from
[2:08:53] school that's what you take home from
[2:08:56] school not take over some more nastiness
[2:08:58] because you got it from the other f is
[2:09:00] that what God plac you
[2:09:04] nastiness or some adultery some
[2:09:06] fornication because you see the boys
[2:09:08] doing that or the men see their their
[2:09:11] guys on the job to timing their wives
[2:09:13] and getting away with it is that what it
[2:09:15] putting you is that what you pick up
[2:09:17] from work
[2:09:26] God is your BOS when they want to employ
[2:09:28] you on a job they let you
[2:09:30] know this is the job you're are doing
[2:09:33] these are they call it job descriptions
[2:09:35] but better still because I say like make
[2:09:38] 10 phone calls I say I even made 20 no
[2:09:41] you need to put there the outcomes that
[2:09:44] we're expecting to get from you the
[2:09:47] deliverables you to get from
[2:09:49] you so out of those 10 calls you must
[2:09:52] have a client who will book an
[2:09:54] appointment from those 10 calls so until
[2:09:56] you have that one client you can do all
[2:09:58] the 10 and 20 it doesn't matter is the
[2:10:00] outcomes the deliverables we're talking
[2:10:02] about so it's not just effort labor
[2:10:04] effort labor is the
[2:10:06] results amen can you say Amen can you
[2:10:09] say I'll show you from the Bible I'll
[2:10:11] show you from the Bible amen not from
[2:10:14] your business school from the business
[2:10:15] school of above not a and Y have a clue
[2:10:18] about this they get it and make it make
[2:10:21] money on Wall Street but this here for
[2:10:23] Eternal values you can't even compare
[2:10:25] them no you can't compare them you don't
[2:10:27] have to believe it but you can compare
[2:10:29] them Oh
[2:10:47] Glory
[2:10:49] so this understand knows that whatever
[2:10:50] work it is you doing is Jesus himself
[2:10:54] who has described the job description
[2:10:57] the outcomes and the deliverables that
[2:11:00] your work should produce that's why
[2:11:02] promotion comes from nowhere but from
[2:11:07] above because the
[2:11:09] one the one real true
[2:11:13] boss who has said the real deliverables
[2:11:16] and outcomes that your work should
[2:11:17] deliver
[2:11:21] and based upon the outcomes that you
[2:11:24] deliver it will grow you in other words
[2:11:27] he will promote you both in stature and
[2:11:30] in favor with both God and man in life
[2:11:34] and godliness and the child
[2:11:36] grew because he was there he was there
[2:11:38] in the Caper shed he was there in the
[2:11:40] temple he was there 12 years
[2:11:42] old he grew in stature and wisdom
[2:11:45] stature both God and man
[2:11:50] is it care saying that God's saying that
[2:11:52] God's marking his
[2:11:56] records I close too many people closing
[2:11:58] their
[2:12:02] eyes CU let me tell these young men they
[2:12:05] they're
[2:12:08] sleeping you because my you you
[2:12:10] [Laughter]
[2:12:17] know

[2:12:34] like
[2:12:35] that the one who we serve is a Bross we
[2:12:39] don't serve him in church and then we
[2:12:40] serve him somebody else at work no we
[2:12:41] serve him all the time 24/7 like you
[2:12:44] guys say we Ser him all the time we at

[2:12:48] we in fulltime service
[2:12:51] amen people have a problem because they
[2:12:53] feel that they can be Christians here
[2:12:55] and then they can be that's why young
[2:12:56] people have a problem when they in
[2:12:58] church they are Christians and they're
[2:12:59] trying to present and and impress people
[2:13:01] but when they get away from church it's
[2:13:03] another game all together but when you
[2:13:04] know that there's an eye watching you
[2:13:05] your boss is checking you out whether
[2:13:07] you are
[2:13:09] delivering that job is only to help you
[2:13:11] to bring it out and when you get home
[2:13:13] too is the same thing to help you to
[2:13:15] bring it out the deliverables the

[3:04:53] worship original is the same so by
[3:04:56] working you actually in your form of
[3:04:58] worship so worship is work and work is
[3:05:00] worship Hallelujah so we thank the Lord
[3:05:03] for a masterpiece from the Lord and we
[3:05:05] pray that God will bless his servant
[3:05:07] brother Olu in a mighty
[3:05:09] way we do have one prayer request for
[3:05:13] Zaden ha 3 years old with body pains
[3:05:16] fever headache and trouble to breathe
[3:05:19] from brother Mike Blackman and I know
[3:05:21] they are many different situations at
[3:05:22] this time and we see it all around
[3:05:25] different viruses and different things
[3:05:27] so there are those who are not even here
[3:05:29] today because they are ill so we want to
[3:05:30] remember them in prayer also and if you
[3:05:33] have a request this morning that you
[3:05:34] want to show by raising your hand as we
[3:05:37] approach the throne of God this
[3:05:40] morning see those hands let us bow our
[3:05:44] heads for word of prayer oh gracious
[3:05:45] Heavenly Father Lord we thank you for
[3:05:48] Lord the words of eternal life that we
[3:05:50] heard this morning Lord and Lord such a
[3:05:54] beautiful Lord timely message Lord to
[3:05:57] remind us of the purpose of work father
[3:05:59] and Lord Brother Olu so beautifully
[3:06:02] brought her that before the fall man was
[3:06:04] put there to work father the
[3:06:05] responsibility was there father and Lord
[3:06:09] God to understand that it's a work of
[3:06:11] the ministry it's the work of our hands
[3:06:13] that prayer is work sacrifice is work
[3:06:16] praise is work it's all an expression of
[3:06:19] Lord our worship to you and father the
[3:06:21] fact that Lord by living this way we are
[3:06:24] constantly reminded Lord that you are
[3:06:27] the one we report to you are the one we
[3:06:29] live for you are the one we serve father
[3:06:32] and that Lord you would bless the very
[3:06:34] work of our hands Lord and father your
[3:06:36] Prophet taught us that we got to do
[3:06:38] something for something to happen all of
[3:06:40] that is a form of work there's an
[3:06:41] activity that's required there's a
[3:06:44] effort that is required for even for you
[3:06:46] to operate and for you to act and you
[3:06:48] taught us through your word that if we
[3:06:50] should ask anything Lord that Lord you
[3:06:52] would do it so it requires the work of
[3:06:54] asking for you to even come back and
[3:06:56] bring the response so Lord we come this
[3:06:59] morning to work Lord and we come to
[3:07:01] bring these requests to you Lord as a
[3:07:03] form of work and we come to ask Lord
[3:07:05] because you promised that you would
[3:07:07] answer our prayer you promise that you
[3:07:08] will meet our needs Lord you promise
[3:07:11] that Lord if we knock if we seek they
[3:07:13] said knock and the door will be open it
[3:07:15] requires the work of knocking for the
[3:07:17] door to be open if we're not willing to
[3:07:19] knock Lord you promise to not just open
[3:07:21] the door but he said if we knock you'll
[3:07:23] answer Lord even you said I'm standing
[3:07:26] at the door and I'm knocking so Lord the
[3:07:28] work that began in the day of creation
[3:07:30] is still happening now because you're
[3:07:31] standing on the doors of our hearts
[3:07:34] knocking this morning Lord you're still
[3:07:36] working to bring us to a realization of
[3:07:38] who we are and whose we are so father we
[3:07:41] thank you Lord for the revelation that's
[3:07:43] unfolding to us that we could stand
[3:07:45] plainly and see you have a work to do
[3:07:48] and we also have a work to do and we are
[3:07:50] working together Lord to bring a
[3:07:52] manifestation of the sons of God where
[3:07:54] born Sons filled Sons can take their
[3:07:57] position oh God and we bring Lord Zan ha

[3:08:03] body pains headache trouble to breathe

[3:08:10] as a body of Believers and unite in
[3:08:12] faith
[3:08:13] and plead the blood and put in a request
[3:08:15] and a petition that even now the angel

[3:12:22] physical service here please do
[3:12:24] so if you could make it
[3:12:26] out make it out and if you cannot make
[3:12:30] it out make sure that you are connected
[3:12:33] to the service we are on duty all the
[3:12:35] time we heard of this we are in service
[3:12:38] all the time but if you can make it here
[3:12:41] make the effort it's a little little
[3:12:42] push but make the effort and if you can
[3:12:45] be here then make it part of your duty
[3:12:47] and your responsibility to be part of
[3:12:50] the service this Wednesday at 8:00 p.m.
[3:12:53] this coming Friday it's our Zoom prayer
[3:12:56] meeting and I want to also encourage you
[3:12:58] in particular the parents encourage your
[3:13:01] young children to be a part of the
[3:13:03] service also it's a discipline and they
[3:13:06] have to learn and understand that
[3:13:08] discipline so this coming Friday at 8:00
[3:13:10] p.m. our Zoom prayer meeting and Lord
[3:13:13] willing this coming Sunday back here in
[3:13:15] the house of the Lord for our Sunday

[3:13:26] week group four is schedule to serve the
[3:13:30] work doesn't stop the work continues and
[3:13:33] we want to salute all of these groups
[3:13:35] you appreciate the maintainance groups
[3:13:37] that work every they work every
[3:13:40] Sunday amen
[3:13:43] also we want to remind the church that
[3:13:46] on Saturday the 27th of January will be
[3:13:50] our first youth service for this year
[3:13:52] all are welcome we want you to make an
[3:13:55] extra effort to support it make sure
[3:13:58] that those that may not be here they are
[3:14:00] aware of it it's it's not optional we
[3:14:03] want it to be mandatory all right so we
[3:14:06] have young people who are in trouble
[3:14:07] young people who are struggling and as I
[3:14:09] was saying with to someone yesterday
[3:14:12] what do young people have to deal with
[3:14:13] at age 8 and at age seven and at age six
[3:14:17] is very different from what we had to
[3:14:19] deal with when we were 12 and 13 and 15
[3:14:21] and these things you know just a couple
[3:14:24] days ago my daughter came home and said
[3:14:27] one of the kids in school has two
[3:14:29] mommies and I as a fouryear old
[3:14:34] know that's what they Comm I'm saying
[3:14:37] trying to understand how is that
[3:14:38] possible at 4 years old that's the world
[3:14:39] we live in so let's not take it for
[3:14:41] granted it's a serious hour we're living
[3:14:43] in so we encourage you to support our
[3:14:47] youth focused service let's call it a
[3:14:48] youth focused service so we could have a
[3:14:51] conversation with young people but all
[3:14:52] are welcome as we put our shoulders
[3:14:56] together in this great move and this
[3:14:58] effort to see God do something
[3:15:00] tremendous for the young people because
[3:15:02] he promised to do it but we have to put
[3:15:03] the work in it's not going to happen
[3:15:06] without the work without the effort
[3:15:07] without the sacrifice in addition to
[3:15:10] that Carnival Monday
[3:15:13] we want to put you on notice early as
[3:15:14] well that we're going to have a special
[3:15:16] family day here at the church from 9:00
[3:15:18] a.m. to 5:00 p.m. there will be a number
[3:15:21] of activities planned um I can't
[3:15:23] guarantee it but I might be cooking
[3:15:25] barbecue we'll see but you know don't
[3:15:29] don't hold me to it but may be possible
[3:15:32] but we have a lot of activities planned
[3:15:34] and we want the church to come out and
[3:15:36] have a time of Fellowship in a
[3:15:38] environment in an atmosphere of
[3:15:40] Believers have different things that
[3:15:42] will happen different activities and and
[3:15:44] fellowships and uh we'll get more
[3:15:46] certainly some more details um on that
[3:15:49] as we get closer to that day um in
[3:15:52] addition uh we are just about 6 months
[3:15:57] just about 6 months away from our annual
[3:16:00] convention time is moving so fast and
[3:16:02] before you know it it's it's right there
[3:16:05] you know so uh convention will be in
[3:16:07] July of this year so we just about 6
[3:16:09] months away and we want to begin to make
[3:16:13] preparations for that both in the
[3:16:16] natural and in the spiritual and in
[3:16:19] light of that as well the hospitality
[3:16:21] team um is reactivated as of today so
[3:16:24] there'll be uh Refreshments available to
[3:16:27] support financially for the convention
[3:16:30] fund so we encourage you to support that
[3:16:32] as well but in addition to that we want
[3:16:35] to encourage all of the church to make a
[3:16:38] pledge and a commitment towards
[3:16:41] supporting the convent convention and if
[3:16:44] we look at it this way we are in January
[3:16:46] so we have about 6 months to go January
[3:16:48] February March April May June and then
[3:16:51] the convention in July so pray about it
[3:16:54] see what the Lord puts on your heart to
[3:16:56] contribute towards the convention and if
[3:16:58] you can make a commitment monthly over
[3:17:01] the next 6 months to the convention and
[3:17:03] communicate this commitment to us so
[3:17:05] that we could understand what's possible
[3:17:07] uh we do have certain plans to do
[3:17:09] certain repairs to the Tabernacle and
[3:17:11] all of it is work and it takes resources
[3:17:14] to be able to prepare and of course to
[3:17:16] handle many of the convention related
[3:17:18] expenses as well so we want to be a part
[3:17:20] of this great effort and we are
[3:17:22] soliciting uh your support you look in
[3:17:25] your heart and may the Lord minister to
[3:17:28] you and we'll be having more
[3:17:29] conversations around this but we want to
[3:17:31] at least post you to what's coming ahead
[3:17:34] as well in addition more details will
[3:17:36] come but last year we had a number of uh
[3:17:40] our local ministers coming coming in to
[3:17:42] minister during the course of the year
[3:17:44] to us so we are looking for God to do
[3:17:46] some more of that and to allow some more
[3:17:48] of that and uh more details will come
[3:17:50] but as early as next month we are
[3:17:52] looking to have a local Minister here to
[3:17:55] speak to the church so we want to be on
[3:17:58] the expectation we got to do something
[3:17:59] for something to happen so we want to
[3:18:01] keep the pressure on keep the momentum
[3:18:04] on keep our swords drawn and keeping
[3:18:07] moving as the Bible said every place
[3:18:09] that the soul of your foot tread upon
[3:18:11] that is yours so we want to keep making
[3:18:15] Footprints and we know Footprints mean
[3:18:17] possession so may the Lord richly bless
