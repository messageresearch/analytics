[11:36] and uh that's what we're here for to
[11:38] enter into his presence
[11:40] so we're here for to enter into his
[11:42] presence it was
[11:44] death to go in in the old testament
[11:47] now is dead to be outside his presence
[11:51] so his presence is evidence that his
[11:53] blood is among us because it's through
[11:56] the blood you have access to his
[11:58] spirit blood is what produces
[12:01] pardon blood is what produces
[12:04] forgiveness
[12:05] blood is what produces that opportunity
[12:08] for god's mercy his blood
[12:10] it's thrown israeli a judgment seat it's
[12:13] a mercy seat because there's blood on it
[12:16] blood is what makes it to mercy
[12:19] once there is blood on that seat there
[12:21] is mercy
[12:23] oh we thank god for the blood out of
[12:26] the blood this morning we didn't stand a
[12:28] chance without the blood this morning i
[12:30] couldn't even be here
[12:32] it's only because of the blood that we
[12:34] could stand and speak to you
[12:36] it's only because of the blood you can
[12:38] come and hear the word of god
[12:40] nothing you have done nothing i have
[12:42] done but for the grace of god
[12:45] where would i be this morning but for
[12:48] the grace of god
[12:50] oh hallelujah how a great light shining
[12:53] into our hearts
[12:54] oh praise god we were lost and undone we
[12:57] prayed we were wretched and miserable
[12:58] and poor and blind and
[13:00] didn't even know it but evening light
[13:02] began to shine
[13:04] praise god we are here because of the
[13:06] light praise god of evening light
[13:09] bible prophecy gross darkness cover the
[13:11] earth
[13:12] but god sent a little light that we
[13:15] could
[13:15] stand up that we could worship
[13:18] that we could give god glory oh you love
[13:20] him this morning
[13:23] hallelujah you got to know that you love
[13:24] him
[13:26] hallelujah so this morning
[13:29] our title the dynamics of this church
[13:32] that's the title this morning the
[13:33] dynamics of this church
[13:35] i have an inspiration there must be
[13:38] a manifestation of brotherly kindness
[13:42] before the outpouring of dynamics
[13:45] that's my inspiration this morning there
[13:47] must be a manifestation of brotherly
[13:50] kindness
[13:51] before the opponent of dynamics
[13:54] so we want to go straight into the word
[13:56] this morning amen
[14:07] the message you know it's in the word
[14:09] but this is something is there anything
[14:11] too hard for the lord
[14:12] he was talking about uh either well
[14:15] these are sodom
[14:16] oh god help we help help help us to wake
[14:19] up
[14:20] the day of physician is here you say
[14:23] god doesn't send angels anymore the holy
[14:25] spirit is that angel
[14:27] the holy spirit is that person jesus
[14:30] said when
[14:30] he the holy ghost when he comes he will
[14:33] do the works that he did
[14:35] and he be with us even in us and he
[14:38] would bring
[14:38] things to our remembrance and would show
[14:41] us things to come
[14:43] now from against organized religion now
[14:46] this angel of light
[14:48] to the loud eastern church age rejected
[14:50] christ
[14:51] on his word for dogma and put him
[14:52] outside he stood at the door knocking
[14:55] trying to
[14:55] imagine that christ kicked out of his
[14:58] own church
[14:59] christ on the outside of people singing
[15:01] in the church singing specials in the
[15:03] church
[15:03] preaching in the church and he's outside
[15:05] his own church but watch the church age
[15:07] has rejected christ
[15:08] and christ is the word
[15:12] it's the word that was rejected could
[15:14] somebody say amen
[15:16] and he was on the outside the only
[15:18] church age
[15:19] that we have christ on the outside
[15:21] knocking trying to get in
[15:23] and this angel message messenger come
[15:26] from god
[15:27] was echoing his message on the earth to
[15:29] come out of babylon
[15:30] come out of organization the holy spirit
[15:33] today here we go
[15:34] the holy spirit today the manifestation
[15:37] of the holy spirit
[15:39] watch is that angel
[15:42] trying to get the people back to the
[15:44] world
[15:45] because the holy spirit will only
[15:47] vindicate the word
[15:49] so the first thing when the holy spirit
[15:51] comes is to get the people on the word
[15:53] because he didn't come to just bless you
[15:55] he come to vindicate his own word
[15:58] so if he want to really seal you you
[16:00] have to seal you first with the word
[16:02] with the revelation and then the spirit
[16:04] come behind that word in you
[16:06] then you are filled with power filled
[16:08] with this presence isn't that right
[16:10] because the holy spirit will only
[16:12] vindicate the word
[16:14] it can't vindicate dogmas there is no
[16:15] life in them
[16:17] isn't that right so therefore as paul
[16:20] tell us in ephesians to put on the whole
[16:23] armor of god is not right
[16:24] and we know what that alma is that alma
[16:26] is the baptism of the holy ghost
[16:28] isn't that right and there's we have a
[16:30] promise of
[16:31] power which is dynamics to come isn't
[16:34] that right
[16:35] to release virtue power for service
[16:38] which is dunamis is a word called isn't
[16:40] that right
[16:41] and that virtue power is that the sons
[16:44] of god
[16:45] can be formed into the word image o
[16:48] praise god how many you stand there now
[16:50] oh sometimes you give an easy reference
[16:52] like material you can have sand and
[16:54] gravel and cement
[16:56] and galvanized that's just materials but
[16:58] then when you take it
[17:00] and you build a building with it that's
[17:02] a building you take the material
[17:04] and you form a building out of the very
[17:06] materials so you can leave the material
[17:08] there you can leave the gravel there you
[17:09] can leave the cement there but you could
[17:10] take the bricks and put it together and
[17:12] form a building
[17:13] well what i'm saying the material is in
[17:15] the world but there's an image to be
[17:17] formed
[17:18] there's an image and that's the image
[17:20] right there faith and virtue and
[17:22] knowledge that has to be formed in you
[17:24] how many understand that now that has to
[17:26] be actually formed in you
[17:28] you can't just think it you can't just
[17:30] will it it's got to be formed
[17:32] in you isn't that right oh blessed be
[17:35] name of the lord
[17:36] and ii peter 1 3 the bible said
[17:38] according as
[17:39] his divine power has given unto
[17:43] us all things pertaining to life and
[17:46] godliness through the knowledge of him
[17:48] that has called us to glory and virtue
[17:51] oh hallelujah so it's divine power not
[17:54] human power
[17:55] not intellectual power but divine power
[17:58] and that word in the greek means dunamis
[18:01] it means
[18:02] inherent power it means power
[18:05] being able to reproduce itself and
[18:08] that's where you get the word dynamo
[18:10] from
[18:11] it could turn and reproduce itself and
[18:14] that is where you get dynamics
[18:15] so in other words god wants to make you
[18:17] into a little dynamo
[18:19] a little powerhouse that you don't have
[18:21] to get charged up from anything
[18:24] you gonna have your own power a
[18:27] self-sustaining power
[18:29] a self-regenerating power jesus said in
[18:33] his way he that believeth on me
[18:35] as the scripture had said out of his
[18:38] belly
[18:38] shall flow rivers of living water
[18:42] it's the same thing he's talking about
[18:44] he is talking about something on the
[18:46] inside
[18:48] that have power to regenerate itself
[18:51] hallelujah are you talking about you
[18:53] shall receive power
[18:55] oh hallelujah not just upon your
[18:57] shoulder not just upon your life
[18:59] but inside power internal power
[19:03] power to reproduce itself
[19:07] all have power to reproduce itself
[19:10] when you're feeling down when you're
[19:12] feeling low
[19:13] it have power to reproduce itself
[19:17] that power gonna be in you it's a
[19:19] promise
[19:20] it's a promise of the father he said
[19:23] behold i send the promise
[19:25] of my father upon you
[19:28] oh hallelujah man didn't make that
[19:32] promise
[19:32] man didn't release that promise god
[19:35] himself
[19:37] god himself god himself
[19:41] i send you the promise of the father
[19:45] [Applause]
[19:47] oh hallelujah hallelujah
[19:51] glory so we want to hone in
[19:54] to your promise for the hour that you
[19:57] are to receive power
[19:59] personally hallelujah you have to
[20:03] receive power
[20:04] a personal personal
[20:08] portion of power your own liquor fire
[20:12] or your own little fire
[20:16] not the pastor's lick not the eldest
[20:18] lake
[20:19] not the church lake but your own lake of
[20:22] fire
[20:23] [Applause]
[20:26] your promise this morning how many
[20:29] believe that
[20:30] hallelujah divine power
[20:34] which given us all things of life and
[20:38] godliness
[20:39] through the knowledge proper knowledge
[20:41] isn't that right
[20:42] so the only way in our words the only
[20:44] way
[20:46] we going to see adopted sons in this
[20:49] on this earth dynamics
[20:52] have to come power have to come
[20:56] to start the sun's rolling hallelujah
[20:59] into the pace of trying
[21:02] to be formed into the wood image
[21:05] hallelujah hallelujah i will say it
[21:08] again
[21:08] because jesus was the example son
[21:13] i say it this way jesus was the example
[21:17] seed son he was the example
[21:20] he is the plum line he is the measuring
[21:24] rod
[21:24] and when he receive his power on the
[21:27] bank of the river
[21:29] the spirit led him immediately
[21:33] into the wilderness to be tempted to be
[21:36] tested he received power power not to
[21:40] post
[21:41] power not to say i'm right you are wrong
[21:43] he received power
[21:44] that he could learn how to overcome
[21:47] himself
[21:48] that's correct power power to overcome
[21:52] yourself
[21:53] power to say the right thing power to
[21:56] control your tongue
[21:58] it is written it is written it is
[22:01] written
[22:02] and it is also written oh
[22:05] hallelujah
[22:06] [Applause]
[22:11] hallelujah that's the ministry of christ
[22:16] isn't that right and we want to see now
[22:18] from the scriptures
[22:20] the ministry of christ the effect of it
[22:25] what is promised and i'm going to read
[22:28] these scriptures
[22:30] how we're going to see and know
[22:34] christ's ministry back on the earth
[22:38] among his people scripture
[22:41] mark 5 30 and jesus immediately knowing
[22:45] in himself that virtue had gone out of
[22:49] him
[22:49] turned him about in the presence said
[22:51] who touch
[22:53] my clothes that's christ virtue
[22:57] flew in virtue coming out
[23:00] luke 6 19 and the whole multitude sought
[23:04] to touch him
[23:05] for there went virtue out of him
[23:09] and healed them all who is that that's
[23:12] jesus that's the effect of
[23:15] power ministry of christ
[23:18] luke 8 46 and jesus said somebody had
[23:22] touched me
[23:22] for i perceive that virtue is gone out
[23:25] of me
[23:26] isn't that right that virtue is power
[23:28] isn't that right
[23:30] hallelujah praise the name of the lord
[23:33] luke 6 19 and all the crowd sought to
[23:36] touch him
[23:37] for a power went out from him and healed
[23:40] them all
[23:41] he had it he could release it he had it
[23:44] he could give it he had it it could flow
[23:47] from him

[23:50] not talking about a teaching
[23:52] we are not talking about a message we're
[23:54] talking about his

[25:38] who is he the chief engineer he's the
[25:40] man that designed the thing
[25:42] he know to fix it he know to correct it
[25:47] he know to get it started and we're
[25:49] gonna get something started
[25:51] he said if they could only get started
[25:54] god will do the rest
[25:56] oh bless that breathing of the lord
[25:59] praise god
[26:00] you maybe see that he's in this hour
[26:02] brother
[26:03] when we wonder what's the matter with
[26:05] our revival
[26:06] what's the matter we got the material we
[26:08] got the mechanics
[26:10] but where is the dynamics and that's
[26:12] what we need
[26:13] to move jesus christ on the scene what's
[26:16] the matter i'm telling you
[26:18] there is one here today called the holy
[26:20] ghost
[26:21] that can touch the dynamics he is the
[26:24] dynamics
[26:26] of the mechanics are you hearing it
[26:29] he is the dynamics who is he the holy
[26:32] ghost
[26:33] isn't that right we stand today as
[26:35] pentecostals
[26:36] one of the greatest churches in the
[26:37] nation thousand time thousands added
[26:40] each year
[26:41] but where is the holy ghost he said we
[26:44] are
[26:44] except speaking in tongues we we see how
[26:46] it acted and
[26:48] shouted and fought but it's the word
[26:51] it's the word turn on the light
[26:55] turns on the mechanics and they become
[26:58] dynamics
[26:59] they are dynamics when the dynamic
[27:02] comfort mechanic it start the thing
[27:04] rolling
[27:05] so all what we scratching up with and
[27:07] struggling with
[27:09] we want to get it rolling but it will
[27:11] take
[27:12] dynamics and we have a promise this
[27:15] church have a promise
[27:16] the dynamics of this church we don't
[27:19] know about other churches but we're
[27:20] talking about this church
[27:22] we have a promise from god and we have
[27:25] to look for
[27:26] it we have to expect it we have to press
[27:29] towards it
[27:30] we have to emphasize it we have to push
[27:33] and focus on it
[27:35] this is our promise oh blessed be of the
[27:39] lord
[27:39] [Applause]
[27:40] so take the word if there is one little
[27:43] thing messed up it won't start
[27:46] you have a nice car the seat's nice
[27:50] the paint job nice the rims looking very
[27:54] nice
[27:55] you have a nice number plate
[28:01] the air conditioner supposedly working
[28:02] but the car can start
[28:06] so all you have there is just a nice
[28:10] looking mechanic that can't go anywhere
[28:16] you can tell the people that there's my
[28:17] car you know let's go
[28:19] no i can't go you know start
[28:22] you might as well get a bicycle
[28:25] you always might get something else why
[28:27] you need dynamics
[28:30] to get it going so but the branham says
[28:33] if there's one little thing messed up it
[28:34] won't stop
[28:35] lay aside every weight every ism every
[28:38] creed
[28:39] that the dynamics the holy spirit
[28:42] might flow through the world
[28:45] and vindicate the word promise for this
[28:49] day
[28:50] then the great church of god will rise
[28:53] like a feet like a jet propelled plane
[28:55] and take off to the skies to meet her
[28:58] master
[28:59] oh blessed be the name of the lord
[29:01] praise god
[29:03] i've heard by now i see talking about
[29:04] job he said no
[29:06] they had job had no scripture so he had
[29:09] us to wait for the inspiration
[29:11] and then he knew by when his and
[29:14] strike him
[29:15] he knowed what would happen listen as we
[29:18] go forward
[29:20] that's the church if it's an order set
[29:22] in order it's got the mechanics ready
[29:24] it only need them dynamics tonight here
[29:27] we go
[29:28] if we will get the mechanics ready first
[29:31] thing he said get our hearts right
[29:36] the things that we can do oh brother
[29:39] ovid
[29:39] you mean the mechanics is the thing that
[29:41] we can do yes
[29:44] because you cannot produce dynamics
[29:49] i read it again now watch if we will get
[29:53] the mechanics
[29:54] ready get our hearts
[29:58] right the things that we can do
[30:02] follow every word follow him in baptism
[30:05] follow him in every order he told us to
[30:07] do get
[30:09] every mechanic ready and stand there
[30:12] then we are ready for dynamics to be lit
[30:15] off
[30:16] and only god can do that
[30:19] [Music]
[30:21] because god himself made the promise
[30:24] only god could do that
[30:26] watch watch watch and that's to drop
[30:28] into your heart
[30:29] that faith that say i am on you
[30:31] [Music]
[30:34] so therefore what power do you have
[30:35] right now you have power right now
[30:37] this morning to forgive you
[30:44] you don't need dynamics for that your
[30:47] power to repent
[30:50] your power this morning say i am sorry
[30:52] please forgive me you are probably to do
[30:53] that
[30:55] you are permitted to worship lift your

[32:13] [Music]
[32:16] you have power to respect each other oh
[32:19] blessed being of the lord
[32:20] but abraham said it's your approach it's
[32:23] the attitude of what it takes
[32:25] and that is what it is tonight dear
[32:27] friend it takes the attitude
[32:29] we are and believe we are in the
[32:31] presence of jesus christ
[32:33] but it's your attitude that brings the
[32:34] results
[32:36] you want results well here's the answer
[32:38] it's your attitude that brings
[32:40] the results the mechanics is here
[32:43] and so is the dynamics if you can only
[32:46] get started
[32:47] god will do the rest oh hallelujah
[32:50] as we say i think some servants are back
[32:53] if the dove
[32:54] is coming for the lamb and the dove
[32:56] coming on his way down
[32:58] the dog look down and see wait is a wolf
[33:02] the dog have to put in reverse gear and
[33:05] just fly off
[33:06] and wait until you see the lamb like
[33:09] nature
[33:10] so when you have your wool fish behavior
[33:12] the devil they still wait
[33:13] wait until you cool down wait until you
[33:16] behave yourself
[33:17] and wait until you want to get in the
[33:19] spirit one more time
[33:21] take me back to where i first receive
[33:23] you
[33:25] hallelujah hallelujah waited and wait
[33:27] until you come back
[33:28] the tears that are coming your eyes
[33:30] you're thanking god for his love
[33:32] thanking god for his grace some people
[33:34] do it like they and god are partners
[33:37] and god going down the road with them
[33:39] that's not how we operate friends
[33:41] hallelujah if you're not flirting and
[33:43] full and wrong god gonna be with you
[33:45] until you go to fool around again
[33:47] then he has to pull off and wait till
[33:49] you repent wait till you make things
[33:51] right
[33:52] wait till you begin to set things in
[33:54] order isn't that right
[33:56] oh he didn't spare his children he
[33:58] didn't spare the children of israel when
[33:59] they misbehave
[34:00] some king of babylon took them into
[34:01] captivity until they cry and
[34:04] weep and veil and mourn when i remember
[34:06] zion when i remember my hometown
[34:09] when i remember where i was from we got
[34:11] the enemies to come and take them out
[34:13] from their land and
[34:14] take them all from their family and
[34:15] their country and they cornered the
[34:17] slavery what a terrible thing
[34:19] slavery is rip you off from your country

[34:25] people begin to weep and cry and mourn
[34:27] god coming and punish the king of
[34:29] babylon let my people call release them
[34:34] oh hallelujah god is jealous
[34:38] for his people he hates to see them bowl
[34:40] oh glory to god sit down a minute
[34:43] praise god by the grace of you you will
[34:44] be seated hallelujah
[34:46] but when his people are trapped
[34:49] he can't just bring them out like that
[34:52] there has to be a first
[34:54] they had to be a a weeping in the
[34:56] morning

[34:59] forgive us forgive your people
[35:01] we have we have come against your
[35:02] prophets we have sinned we have done
[35:04] wickedly and daniel began to seek the
[35:06] lord not only on his behalf
[35:09] but on behalf of god's people daniel had
[35:11] a burden
[35:12] because he saw that time was cutting it
[35:14] close and he wanted to get a revelation
[35:17] of homer's time is left and while he was
[35:20] seeking

[36:30] about to stay home
[36:31] when you come come on expectation when
[36:34] you come come for revival
[36:35] when you come come from an investigation

[36:40] [Applause]
[36:47] i can't just come to church and just say
[36:49] i'm going to just say
[36:50] things and talk things and just waste
[36:52] your time
[36:54] i can't do that hallelujah hallelujah
[36:58] oh glory i have a sick i have to seek
[37:00] the lord to ask what god once spoke to
[37:02] his people
[37:04] hallelujah and i want you to have that
[37:06] same dedication and you come into church
[37:08] hallelujah god sent a prophet a mighty
[37:11] elijah prophet
[37:13] because he had a whole world to bring a
[37:15] message to
[37:17] he sent that prophet to all kind of
[37:19] tests and trials
[37:20] to qualify him hallelujah
[37:24] to get that book from the mighty angel
[37:28] know that that book is on the earth
[37:29] people taking it for granted
[37:31] they're not even reading the book but
[37:33] you are the words of the book
[37:37] [Music]
[37:42] [Applause]
[37:45] but the brown of the holy ghost the holy
[37:48] ghost
[37:48] will always point to the word
[37:52] if it points to a creed or denomination
[37:55] it
[37:55] is not the holy ghost
[37:57] [Music]
[38:00] he couldn't do that point away from the
[38:03] word he died
[38:05] to confirm that word and make that word
[38:09] positive
[38:14] that's the purpose he's dying with his
[38:17] purpose of dying
[38:18] that he could still project
[38:21] what himself through
[38:25] his church i'll say it again the purpose
[38:28] of christ dying was that he could
[38:29] project
[38:30] himself not church self
[38:35] not man's self himself
[38:39] through his church
[38:43] and make every word through every age
[38:46] act exactly like it's supposed to act
[38:51] he is the dynamics of the mechanics the
[38:54] mechanics of the church what is it
[38:56] apostles prophets
[38:59] teachers and so forth he is the dynamics
[39:02] that
[39:02] works that so for the branham
[39:06] taking his prophetic binoculars
[39:11] or equipment he break down mechanics
[39:14] to bring in a faithful ministry that
[39:17] going to become watch not the words i'm
[39:21] saying
[39:22] that going to become god's mechanics on
[39:24] the earth
[39:28] hallelujah that going to be
[39:31] activated by dynamics
[39:36] remember we give the reference of a cell
[39:37] phone you can buy a cell phone it's not
[39:39] activated
[39:40] it's a nice cell phone is the best cell
[39:42] phone but it's not activated you can't
[39:44] call anybody with that
[39:45] it still have to be activated when in
[39:48] like manner the sons of god have to be
[39:51] activated so when you get activated you
[39:54] can call
[39:56] and he could call he can tell you where
[39:59] to go
[40:00] when to go you'll have a direct line
[40:03] [Applause]
[40:05] you don't have to ask anybody permission
[40:08] to love anybody
[40:11] you don't have to ask help who to
[40:12] forgive
[40:13] [Applause]
[40:14] if this one forgiven that one you don't
[40:16] have to ask anybody
[40:18] you have a clear lane you have a direct
[40:21] flow
[40:22] you have a direct hook-up
[40:24] [Applause]
[40:28] and this is a wireless connection
[40:30] hallelujah
[40:31] connected to anybody this is you and
[40:34] your father
[40:35] this is you and your god oh
[40:39] hallelujah hallelujah notice what jesus
[40:42] told them
[40:44] behold i sent
[40:47] the promise of my father upon you
[40:51] oh hallelujah oh glory glory glory
[40:56] so it's worked by a certain dynamic
[40:58] which is the fire
[41:00] he is the fire so and that's in the
[41:02] combustion chamber
[41:04] and the gas is the word is poured in the
[41:07] combustion
[41:08] chamber and he's the one that sets it on
[41:11] fire
[41:11] so what god is doing right now is
[41:13] filling up with gasoline
[41:15] the gasoline is the word hallelujah

[41:38] what happened to the devils now

[43:45] my god this thing to get your trunk they
[43:48] were in the open room
[43:50] they were praying in his name and the
[43:53] holy ghost fell
[43:54] upon them they were walking like drunk
[43:56] men
[43:57] or they were staggering oh they had
[43:59] stimulation
[44:01] of revelation because of the wine upon

[44:27] live that's a thunder that's a thunder
[44:29] that's a bomb
[44:31] our fate makes the world live so the
[44:34] word could be laying right there
[44:36] but the fate is what makes the world
[44:37] live you see lazarus was dead
[44:40] jesus heard when he was sick and jesus
[44:43] deliberately
[44:44] slowed on his moving gear so he would
[44:47] not arrive there when the man is sick
[44:49] jesus wants to come
[44:51] when the situation is so impossible that
[44:54] it doesn't even make
[44:56] sense that's what jesus
[44:59] wants to deal with he want to deal with
[45:01] what is impossible
[45:03] he didn't want to deal with what you
[45:05] can't handle
[45:06] when there is no way out when there is
[45:09] no whip you want to deal with it
[45:11] [Applause]
[45:17] so jesus came to lazarus
[45:22] a week
[45:27] not in past week now he's dead
[45:30] officially
[45:32] buried toned sealed
[45:35] this is the end part of the biscuit and
[45:37] the coffee this is the end part
[45:40] of people gathering wearing black is the
[45:42] end part of that
[45:44] but a sister who believe in resurrection
[45:48] she throwing a gear lord if you have
[45:51] been here
[45:52] i know my brother was not going to die
[45:56] because i know where you are sick don't

[46:44] heard anybody say it before but i say
[46:46] even now
[46:47] i never know that happened like that but
[46:49] even now
[46:51] jesus said you see that faith brought
[46:53] the word
[46:54] into action that faith challenged the
[46:58] word
[46:58] to come alive jesus said where have you
[47:01] laid him
[47:03] where have you led him we getting
[47:06] started here
[47:07] nothing ain't moving yet but i just want
[47:10] to know
[47:11] where have you laid here she said lord
[47:14] is thinking
[47:16] he said i am your promise let me give
[47:18] you a promise
[47:19] let me give you a promise let me give
[47:22] you a promise
[47:24] i am the resurrection
[47:27] [Applause]
[47:31] feet feet
[47:35] feet faith bring it alive
[47:38] now watch let's change the story around
[47:42] jesus if you had been here your brother
[47:45] had not died
[47:46] but we still have some more biscuits and
[47:47] coffee you wanted black or white milk
[47:54] and the story would have read that jesus
[47:56] drank his coffee
[47:58] with biscuits and then left jesus
[48:01] allows us to safely death but that's not
[48:04] the bible
[48:05] she didn't talk about biscuits and
[48:06] coffee she don't even know
[48:09] and then because of even now and her
[48:11] fate she received a promise
[48:13] the promise was i am
[48:16] [Music]
[48:18] because she was talking about i know any
[48:20] resurrection coming on the rise he said
[48:22] i am not talking about that i am that
[48:23] now
[48:24] [Applause]
[48:28] when you see me you see dynamics
[48:32] i am in other words christ
[48:36] you may be seated was dynamics with
[48:39] flesh on it
[48:42] [Applause]
[48:46] that's why he said if i don't go
[48:49] that dynamics will not come
[48:53] in this form i can give it to you
[48:58] i can't release it to you in this way
[49:01] all i could give you is a promise
[49:03] received for the holy ghost
[49:06] i could breathe on you i could give you
[49:09] the breath
[49:10] of promise over your life
[49:14] but the father had put it in his own
[49:17] power
[49:18] your time and your season
[49:22] and when your time and season come
[49:27] no man could stop you from your blessing
[49:32] from your healing from your breakthrough
[49:35] from your deliverance when your time
[49:38] come it doesn't matter what happened

[51:41] the devil don't like to lose his members
[51:44] [Applause]
[51:46] hallelujah every time you leave he still
[51:48] feel you belong to him
[51:50] he believes you are a runaway slave
[51:54] he is not convinced that you have been
[51:57] redeemed
[51:58] by the blood of the lamb so that is why
[52:01] he's fighting you
[52:03] to try to get you back but he lost the
[52:06] battle
[52:08] oh glory to god you are free this
[52:11] morning
[52:13] the devil lost the battle christ has

[52:22] oh hallelujah hallelujah
[52:25] glory to god glory to god
[52:28] glory to god glory
[52:32] you will be seated remember because we
[52:35] were born in sin
[52:36] shape of iniquity having fallen nature
[52:38] he know he could activate things that
[52:41] activate us in the flesh
[52:43] and in the natural and in the human
[52:45] spirit he knows that
[52:47] because we are grounded by five senses
[52:49] if we lost a sixth sense
[52:51] in the garden of eden he said malachi 4
[52:54] to return our hearts back to the sixth
[52:57] sense
[52:58] that we could up the five senses and
[53:00] dominate the five senses
[53:02] and conquer the five senses with the
[53:05] sixth sense
[53:06] of faith because faith knows no retreat
[53:09] say don't give up faith don't down
[53:12] say don't retire
[53:14] [Applause]
[53:17] and listen say it don't get old

[53:41] hair
[53:43] on the contouring face up here on his
[53:44] chest
[53:46] feet always young
[53:52] samson take a jawbone of a mule and
[53:58] [Applause]
[54:09] the power was on samsung but they take
[54:12] faith to hold their job on
[54:14] listen it could be a bat it could be an
[54:16] ak-47
[54:17] it could be a big stick a big tree
[54:19] anything you all
[54:20] was licks
[54:27] listen if samson got a feather ostrich
[54:31] he was still gonna beat them down
[54:33] [Applause]
[54:36] it was embarrassing for the soul of the
[54:38] report when the man said how much
[54:40] thousands how many people hold people he
[54:42] had
[54:44] how big was the army man said it was not
[54:47] there you know
[54:48] it was him

[55:07] mandela's head and shame he says samson
[55:10] he stopped calling him samson but you
[55:12] might know because samson have a rep
[55:13] already
[55:15] [Music]
[55:16] that's what power does that's what
[55:19] dynamic does
[55:20] that's what you see with a man that
[55:23] anointed with power
[55:25] you see evidence of that power someone
[55:28] tell them i'll come back you know that's
[55:29] a message
[55:31] no they felt the jawbone they saw the
[55:34] gate move
[55:36] the lion got lick up that's the power of
[55:39] power
[55:40] power is the talk you shall receive more
[55:43] talk
[55:44] you shall receive tracks you try to
[55:46] receive more books
[55:48] that's not the promise of the father
[55:51] [Applause]
[55:54] that's the promise of some benevolent
[55:55] dunya don't donate i want to do any
[55:58] books here that you could read
[56:00] when you read the books and you
[56:00] recognize you what your promises you
[56:02] want your promise
[56:04] oh praise the lord could we go a little
[56:06] further
[56:07] so our faith makes that word live
[56:10] because christ in us
[56:12] is a quickness to the word how i wish
[56:14] the church could see that
[56:16] all arguments and strife would be over
[56:19] that would be the supreme
[56:21] court that would be the north star
[56:24] that would be an absolute praise the
[56:27] name of the lord
[56:28] and there you are that's all we have
[56:29] arrived at that's the big machine that's
[56:31] set up
[56:32] they got the mechanics talking about the
[56:34] united nations
[56:35] and the only thing they have to get is
[56:37] satan there with the dynamics
[56:39] to force the marking of the beast and
[56:41] she is forced down
[56:43] then the dynamics is working let me say
[56:45] something too
[56:46] ubc church is united nations united it's
[56:48] a united time
[56:49] as i said nation united iran and america
[56:52] is enemy
[56:53] but you know them united to fight the
[56:56] terrorists
[56:57] isis so two strange bedfellows
[57:01] coming together what choice do they have
[57:04] because these guys
[57:06] they're bad enough they're taking heads
[57:08] off
[57:10] i mean people just leaving the house
[57:12] leaving me you think about that now
[57:14] are you studying if you go paint this
[57:16] year or something and then come in
[57:18] you're leaving paint and brush you're
[57:21] heading out
[57:22] because as either you can't vote or
[57:24] you're there you i mean
[57:26] i mean they let them and they put in the
[57:27] video no on on the internet
[57:29] they want the world to be terrorized
[57:31] they want to generate fear
[57:33] hallelujah and god want to generate
[57:34] faith
[57:35] [Applause]
[57:39] would have to get somebody that he could
[57:41] get that fate activated
[57:42] all right let's go further now now watch
[57:44] i said it's a reverence and respect i
[57:46] believe that the bride of christ is
[57:47] called
[57:48] i believe she is sealed into the kingdom
[57:49] of god i believe the mechanics is here
[57:52] they are waiting watch they are waiting
[57:54] for the dynamics that will take over the
[57:56] earth into glory in the rapture i
[57:57] believe in all my heart
[57:59] he is the dynamics
[58:03] so how a man can release the dynamics
[58:08] he is the dynamics okay
[58:11] i think about that now we must become
[58:14] members of his machine of his body
[58:17] forming ourselves into his image so
[58:20] christ
[58:21] is the dynamics he is what is promised
[58:24] when that dynamics pours out and god
[58:27] takes some adopted sons then they're
[58:30] going to have
[58:31] sea germ in the body then they could
[58:34] release
[58:35] power to birth other sons
[58:39] by the spoken word as it was supposed to
[58:42] be in the garden of eden
[58:46] in the garden of eden the sons were
[58:49] supposed to comfort by the spoken word
[58:53] but because of the fall it fell into sex
[58:57] but when jesus came he said you must be
[58:58] born again of the word
[59:01] and the spirit so why did they speak the
[59:04] word
[59:07] the spirit fell upon them
[59:12] that is what happened to cornelius here
[59:15] comes dynamics
[59:16] and mechanics together word and spirit
[59:20] together
[59:21] and they were born again oh give the
[59:24] lord some praises
[59:26] and we are coming right back to that
[59:29] where the dynamics going to be back in
[59:32] the church
[59:34] that people could be blown by spoken
[59:36] word
[59:37] oh hallelujah now here we go this is
[59:40] where i get this vision from
[59:42] the dynamics of this church and i
[59:45] don't believe but abraham was talking
[59:47] about that brown time i could per se
[59:49] and when we say that i'm not this church
[59:51] we're talking about the bright church
[59:53] it's a universal church this is not the
[59:55] church really
[59:56] the church is upon ibili's church is a
[59:58] rock of revelation the church is the
[1:00:00] universal bright body
[1:00:02] the dynamics of that church this church
[1:00:04] is a refilling of the holy ghost
[1:00:06] oh hallelujah could we say amen the
[1:00:10] dynamic is what
[1:00:11] are refilling in other words that
[1:00:13] confirms that god have to start with the
[1:00:15] filling
[1:00:17] [Music]
[1:00:18] and that feeling will be virtual power
[1:00:21] for you to start your
[1:00:23] experience to climb up and when you
[1:00:26] climb up here come the refilling
[1:00:28] to cap the pyramid of your life
[1:00:31] oh give the lord some praises people
[1:00:34] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:00:36] this world in itself confirms
[1:00:40] virtue powerful service starts the sun's
[1:00:44] growth experience
[1:00:46] into the pyramid life that in his place
[1:00:49] of trying
[1:00:50] he could add virtue and knowledge and
[1:00:52] temperance and all of the way
[1:00:55] and then here come the cap of that
[1:00:56] pyramid the spirit itself
[1:00:59] hallelujah coming to come long upon that
[1:01:01] sun
[1:01:02] in other words look at jesus the holy
[1:01:04] ghost came upon him led into the
[1:01:05] wilderness jesus great grace and
[1:01:07] knowledge
[1:01:07] and then afterwards matthew 17 the
[1:01:10] holiness come back again upon him
[1:01:11] and say he in him oh hallelujah abduct
[1:01:15] the son
[1:01:15] isn't that right the dynamics of this
[1:01:18] church will be refilling
[1:01:20] of the holy spirit that we have worked
[1:01:22] in a small measure
[1:01:24] while the headstone is coming down to
[1:01:26] unite with the body
[1:01:28] isn't that right and when the head and
[1:01:30] the body unites together
[1:01:31] the full power of the holy ghost would
[1:01:34] raise her up
[1:01:35] so before the headstone connects with
[1:01:37] his bride the bride will have
[1:01:39] he said from christ his spirit coming
[1:01:41] into the church
[1:01:42] headstone coming down the great magnet
[1:01:45] to magnetize the elect
[1:01:47] hallelujah oh yes a ufo coming for us
[1:01:50] unidentified flying object
[1:01:52] and coming to pick up his people that
[1:01:54] that flying saucer praise god your
[1:01:56] flying saucer
[1:01:57] oh hallelujah praise god a great magnet
[1:02:00] the headstone
[1:02:00] coming to those people that are
[1:02:02] magnetized with the holy ghost
[1:02:04] so the holy ghost is what keep you
[1:02:05] magnetized therefore you're got to get
[1:02:07] the holy ghost
[1:02:08] not just books not just tapes not just
[1:02:11] hearing in a word
[1:02:12] you've got to be magnetized i don't know
[1:02:14] what you ever do in school
[1:02:16] at school use a kind of rubber material
[1:02:17] until they get magnetism in it
[1:02:19] take a metal and rub it rub it rub it
[1:02:21] and afterwards you start to pick up
[1:02:22] things pick up things that's what we're
[1:02:23] talking about let the holy ghost rub you
[1:02:25] soon
[1:02:25] praise god come you come seriously get
[1:02:27] robin and afterwards you start to get
[1:02:29] magnetized that's how they get that
[1:02:30] magnetism inside of you
[1:02:31] then you pick up virtue you pick up
[1:02:33] knowledge and pick up temperance you got
[1:02:34] to pick up the word you're picking up
[1:02:35] the right things
[1:02:36] why you have the magnetism of the holy
[1:02:38] ghost because the holy ghost desires the
[1:02:40] word
[1:02:41] the holy ghost feeds on the word and if
[1:02:43] you get the holy ghost all you want is
[1:02:44] the word
[1:02:45] oh the word become your diet oh
[1:02:49] the word is your menu isn't it not right
[1:02:52] praise god god adoption trying to place
[1:02:55] his church in position to manifest
[1:02:56] himself
[1:02:58] so we find out according to what we just
[1:02:59] read here god
[1:03:02] has to place his church in position
[1:03:06] purpose to manifest himself getting one
[1:03:10] that he can work through and say
[1:03:11] there's my spirit flowing freely i can
[1:03:14] work here
[1:03:15] notice not there's my revelations
[1:03:17] there's my teachings they are my
[1:03:18] messages there is my
[1:03:19] spirit what does that mean that means
[1:03:21] the man has become a channel of god
[1:03:25] he has nothing to hinder the flow of god
[1:03:28] in his life god doesn't float to the
[1:03:31] head
[1:03:32] god flows through the heart prophet
[1:03:35] priests are musical doors and doors have
[1:03:36] doors at the private life
[1:03:37] doors here doors your doors are all
[1:03:39] about inside your heart you've got to
[1:03:40] open those doors
[1:03:41] to let christ come in those doors some
[1:03:44] people have said
[1:03:44] don't talk about me don't say this and
[1:03:46] don't say this and you keep it all up
[1:03:47] christ can't come inside of there you've
[1:03:49] got to slam all those doors open
[1:03:51] that he could fill the vacancy in your
[1:03:53] life
[1:03:54] are you with me now listen to this there
[1:03:56] is my sport
[1:03:59] god trying to play situation position to
[1:04:00] manifest himself
[1:04:02] getting one he can walk through like
[1:04:03] this saying there's my spirit flowing
[1:04:04] freely there it is
[1:04:05] i can work here get another one over
[1:04:08] there and place him i can place him
[1:04:09] adoption placing manifesting
[1:04:12] taking him out put a ceremony on him
[1:04:16] visit him with an angel
[1:04:19] tell him something if he told the truth
[1:04:22] if he just make up something it won't
[1:04:23] work
[1:04:24] we have had lots of that i mean
[1:04:27] manifestation of sons of god
[1:04:29] when god manifests himself and sends him
[1:04:32] out
[1:04:32] and when he goes forward what he says is
[1:04:34] the truth and what he does is the truth
[1:04:36] what he does he manifest christ are we
[1:04:40] looking for that manifestation aren't we
[1:04:42] oh we heard nice messages over the years
[1:04:44] 30 plus years or night messages but
[1:04:46] we're still looking for
[1:04:47] christ manifested isn't that right
[1:04:50] hallelujah not what he preached but what
[1:04:52] he's manifesting isn't that right
[1:04:54] okay here we go oh you love him this
[1:04:56] morning
[1:04:58] and serve him with all your hearts oh
[1:05:00] blessed be
[1:05:01] the lord notice abram and sarah
[1:05:04] their promise of transformation by
[1:05:07] dynamics
[1:05:08] let's look at abram's era stage one
[1:05:11] abraham believing by revelation
[1:05:15] the promise
[1:05:24] praise the name of the lord blessed be
[1:05:27] the name of the lord
[1:05:29] blessed be the name of the lord remember
[1:05:31] the bible say abram believe god
[1:05:33] are they stagnant promise i've got you
[1:05:35] unbelief but we're strong and faith
[1:05:36] giving praise to god isn't right amen
[1:05:38] so i call it stage one abraham believe
[1:05:40] in by revelation the promise
[1:05:42] stage two after believing for 25 years
[1:05:45] here comes a voice hello invale
[1:05:48] bringing back the same promise
[1:05:53] after 25 years but this time
[1:05:56] identifying the season in other words he

[1:08:18] spoke to elisha at giggle and jericho
[1:08:21] and battle
[1:08:22] these at the school of the prophets they
[1:08:24] say you know your muscle be taken from
[1:08:26] you

[1:08:42] portion i want the power of virtual
[1:08:45] power
[1:08:46] [Music]
[1:08:49] notice elisha cross jordan with elijah
[1:08:54] notice those other guys they're looking
[1:08:56] they see them both cross
[1:08:58] and they're waiting they're waiting
[1:09:00] they're waiting to see what coming back
[1:09:02] they're waiting to see who coming back
[1:09:04] they're waiting and see how many coming
[1:09:06] back
[1:09:06] isn't that right elisha in stage two
[1:09:10] cross jordan hallelujah he got the rule
[1:09:14] whatever i'm calling a secondhand rule
[1:09:16] this was the role of a prophet
[1:09:18] this is a second ankle you know what
[1:09:20] there's a huge robe
[1:09:22] this is not original robe there's always
[1:09:25] him cut for elisha
[1:09:26] he's a second-hand robe and he feels
[1:09:29] like a prince
[1:09:30] he took off his whole robe he put on the
[1:09:32] second-hand robe
[1:09:33] and he looked into something to move and
[1:09:36] nothing moving
[1:09:37] nothing moving stage two nothing moving
[1:09:40] and all of a sudden a key turn in his
[1:09:42] heart he recognizes not this rule
[1:09:45] i have to get this thing for his hand i
[1:09:47] can get a second on revelation
[1:09:49] i can get a second an inspiration i can
[1:09:52] get a secondhand message
[1:09:53] i have to get dusty at the lord oh
[1:09:57] where is the lord god and elijah
[1:10:03] where is the lord god of elijah
[1:10:08] then he took the mantle and strike the
[1:10:10] jordan
[1:10:11] and jordan did what jordan know it had
[1:10:14] to do
[1:10:15] when a man anointed with faith fight the
[1:10:17] children
[1:10:18] show them know what to do jordan have to
[1:10:22] open
[1:10:22] up roll jordan roll
[1:10:25] [Applause]
[1:10:26] roll jordan wrong
[1:10:35] when the school of the prophets
[1:10:39] see elijah come back over they had to
[1:10:42] confess they have to confess
[1:10:45] the spirit of elijah god press upon
[1:10:48] elijah
[1:10:49] because we see the same signs we see the
[1:10:51] same wonders
[1:10:52] we see in the same miracles they have to
[1:10:55] take note
[1:10:56] that you have been with jesus you have
[1:10:58] to take note
[1:10:59] that you have been contact with
[1:11:01] something bigger than you
[1:11:03] something more powerful than you you
[1:11:04] have to take note
[1:11:06] that you have been with dynamics you
[1:11:08] have been with jesus
[1:11:10] oh blessed be the rock of
[1:11:13] our salvation hallelujah
[1:11:17] so the third stage elisha
[1:11:20] had was to call upon god to
[1:11:23] contact the power and the spirit
[1:11:27] for that promise that he was received so
[1:11:30] it means
[1:11:31] even though he crossed all the way if he
[1:11:33] didn't get the key
[1:11:35] to ask for the god that elijah had
[1:11:38] he was just going to be a man swimming
[1:11:41] over jordan
[1:11:42] with a rope on his back hallelujah
[1:11:45] because it take power to open up jordan
[1:11:48] if you don't have the power
[1:11:50] you better swim or wait till the jordan
[1:11:53] go load the crossover
[1:11:54] but elisha when he calls for the core of
[1:11:57] elijah
[1:11:58] that god made an appearance i'd like to
[1:12:00] see what god does
[1:12:02] he does leave himself on the edge of
[1:12:04] your fate
[1:12:05] if you don't go to the edge you're not
[1:12:07] going to see here
[1:12:08] some people playing it safe don't play
[1:12:11] it safe
[1:12:12] let your faith go out let's take it to
[1:12:15] the edge
[1:12:16] he is going to be clear when you need
[1:12:19] him
[1:12:20] oh bless blessed be the name of the lord
[1:12:23] i
[1:12:23] know that devil will bang your mind
[1:12:26] you may be seated and tell you what if
[1:12:30] he's not there
[1:12:31] what if he don't appear what have you
[1:12:33] don't come from
[1:12:34] those two human boys went through their
[1:12:36] own stuff they said our god
[1:12:38] is able to deliver us and if we don't
[1:12:40] deliver us we are not going to bow down
[1:12:43] god took them to the edge they were
[1:12:44] getting closer to the fire
[1:12:46] and god wasn't there it was only when
[1:12:48] they get inside the fire
[1:12:49] that's the very edge itself in the fire
[1:12:52] itself
[1:12:53] in the fire itself some of you you don't
[1:12:56] even want to go near the fire
[1:12:58] but if god before us who can be against
[1:13:01] us
[1:13:02] if god before you who can be against you
[1:13:05] come on now let your faith go out
[1:13:08] don't be afraid of going to the edge
[1:13:21] oh glory don't be afraid
[1:13:25] faith is what it will take to go all the
[1:13:29] way
[1:13:30] in god amen the dynamics
[1:13:33] is the promise that no man can fulfill
[1:13:38] not even jesus he breathed on them
[1:13:41] receiving the holy ghost if jesus could
[1:13:43] have fulfilled it
[1:13:44] then he could have give them he could
[1:13:46] appoint upon them but all he could give
[1:13:48] them is the promise

[1:13:52] comforter will not come i will give you
[1:13:54] another comforter
[1:13:56] who in the world cannot receive but you
[1:13:58] see him
[1:13:59] and he you do not beat him but he shall
[1:14:01] be in you
[1:14:02] he is now with you but he is going to be
[1:14:05] in you
[1:14:06] who will hallelu a little while the
[1:14:07] world see at me no more but i'm going to
[1:14:09] come in a different way
[1:14:11] i'm going to come and even for him it
[1:14:12] could be the same jesus
[1:14:14] i'm gonna hide myself inside of you a
[1:14:17] power gonna come upon you
[1:14:18] [Applause]
[1:14:26] hallelujah
[1:14:28] hallelujah are you with me oh let's take
[1:14:31] another one
[1:14:32] look at mary bible said virgin shall
[1:14:35] conceive
[1:14:36] that is scripture hallelujah here come
[1:14:38] mary
[1:14:39] that's the word i promise hear the angel
[1:14:41] come to bring back
[1:14:43] the same word i promise mary you are
[1:14:46] highly favored
[1:14:47] mary you are the one spoken about in
[1:14:49] isaiah 9
[1:14:50] 6 not the angel manifesting things yet
[1:14:53] the angel come to remind mary
[1:14:55] of the word of promise the lord is right
[1:14:57] there blessed adel
[1:14:59] so let's look at this stage one the
[1:15:01] scripture for
[1:15:02] the promise virgin shall conceive stage
[1:15:05] two
[1:15:05] angel appearing to mary to give mary a
[1:15:09] promise
[1:15:09] of a mighty validation to give mary a
[1:15:12] promise
[1:15:13] of dynamics coming upon her married a
[1:15:16] question
[1:15:17] how shall these things be how shall this
[1:15:19] dynamic is going to come
[1:15:21] how it's going to be fulfilled how i'm
[1:15:23] gonna get messiah
[1:15:24] he said the holy ghost the holy ghost
[1:15:27] the holy ghost
[1:15:28] the holy ghost the holy ghost gonna come
[1:15:31] upon you
[1:15:41] jesus hallelujah my
[1:15:45] hallelujah so when the sons
[1:15:48] receive it adopted there's my spirit
[1:15:51] flowing freely
[1:15:52] out of the body of sons it wasn't me
[1:15:55] sons in that sense
[1:15:56] it would be the spirit himself bringing
[1:15:58] out sea germ
[1:16:00] from the body because that's how sons
[1:16:02] are born a father i have a german
[1:16:04] hallelujah to the bedding of a mother
[1:16:07] our son is perfect
[1:16:08] and the same way the sons of god could
[1:16:12] have the germ
[1:16:13] of god because it will be god in the
[1:16:16] sons
[1:16:17] and god have the germ and the german in
[1:16:20] god
[1:16:21] in the sons will be released to call our
[1:16:24] sons
[1:16:25] by the spoken word therefore every
[1:16:28] elected son
[1:16:29] that was locked up in the loins of adam
[1:16:32] that was supposed to come forth by
[1:16:34] spoken word expression
[1:16:36] will come forth as names from the book
[1:16:39] in the last days the book is the germ
[1:16:42] the book gonna be in a fightful ministry
[1:16:45] and from that book
[1:16:47] names gonna be called by the word people
[1:16:50] are gonna be sealed
[1:16:51] right in their seats
[1:16:53] [Applause]
[1:16:57] the predestination gonna be sealed
[1:17:02] even over the internet but abandon said
[1:17:06] the holy ghost will sweep across the
[1:17:08] world
[1:17:09] overnight
[1:17:12] [Applause]
[1:17:14] nothing going to stop it nothing going
[1:17:17] to stop it
[1:17:20] [Applause]
[1:17:26] let me see that hallelujah the dynamics
[1:17:30] is the promise of the father when sons
[1:17:33] receive it
[1:17:34] and it's foreign amen
[1:17:38] the promised dynamics is also the
[1:17:40] promised lattering
[1:17:42] according to the scripture matthew 13
[1:17:45] he had swear the good seat of the son of
[1:17:47] man the field is the world
[1:17:49] the good seed are the children of the
[1:17:51] kingdom
[1:17:52] the evil seeds are the eternal wicked
[1:17:54] one the harvest is the end time
[1:17:57] the reapers are the angels that's the
[1:17:59] prophecy
[1:18:00] and but abraham had a vision the vision
[1:18:02] was the tears
[1:18:03] crying for rain and the wheat crying for
[1:18:06] rain
[1:18:07] it was taking rain to manifest both
[1:18:10] so the dynamics could have come from god
[1:18:12] [Applause]
[1:18:18] who controls rain the farmer
[1:18:22] found the plant where he planned if god
[1:18:24] has said it really and fall
[1:18:26] a farmer operates by feet a fisherman
[1:18:28] upright by feet
[1:18:29] a fisherman upright by fate if you want
[1:18:31] to see fit go and see a fisherman
[1:18:32] children's net he don't know what's
[1:18:34] under there you have no spy glasses
[1:18:37] to see how much fish where the fish is
[1:18:39] suppose the fish decide to go south
[1:18:41] since what if they say let us go up
[1:18:43] north he could say the whole night i
[1:18:45] caught nothing
[1:18:46] beat a horse a fish all night and called
[1:18:48] nothing when jesus
[1:18:50] brought a word cast and met on the right
[1:18:53] side
[1:18:54] hallelujah you mean no he said no
[1:18:57] they say but just about no office i have
[1:19:00] nothing to do with just know
[1:19:01] i am talking about now oh hallelujah
[1:19:06] hallelujah and if god said no
[1:19:09] cast it right now pray it right now
[1:19:12] praise him right now worship him right
[1:19:15] now
[1:19:16] believe it right now receive it right
[1:19:20] now
[1:19:21] [Music]
[1:19:23] [Applause]
[1:19:27] oh hallelujah hallelujah
[1:19:30] hallelujah today
[1:19:33] peter obeyed if peter was argumentative
[1:19:36] if peter was his intellect he got a
[1:19:38] debate with christ
[1:19:40] as a whole night retired we weary
[1:19:43] oh hallelujah you can't expect me to put
[1:19:46] back that net in the boat
[1:19:47] i'm back in the sea but peter knew
[1:19:49] different if the lord speaks
[1:19:51] my word my word my word
[1:19:55] cannot be turned forward my word can
[1:19:58] return
[1:19:58] empty my word and have a hook on it my
[1:20:01] word
[1:20:02] have something to bring up my word has
[1:20:05] something to pull through
[1:20:15] so the ministry of christ he walked with
[1:20:17] the disciples
[1:20:19] the ministry of christ christ walk with
[1:20:22] his disciples
[1:20:23] his ministry ministry of christ christ
[1:20:25] himself
[1:20:26] isn't that right and he gave disciples
[1:20:29] temporary power
[1:20:30] in matthew 10 behold i sent you power
[1:20:33] her power was serpents and scorpions
[1:20:35] they did not have the holy ghost they
[1:20:37] didn't have character
[1:20:38] they had jealousy and envy they didn't
[1:20:40] have it they were preaching and
[1:20:42] witnessing and did not have what they
[1:20:44] took
[1:20:45] that paul was a taste that power was
[1:20:48] temporary
[1:20:48] that was not permanent power that was
[1:20:51] temporary power
[1:20:52] that was christ with them hallelujah
[1:20:55] giving words of promise the same works i
[1:20:57] do shall do also
[1:20:59] christ giving them promise if you shall
[1:21:01] say to this monkey move
[1:21:02] i don't know in your heart you shall
[1:21:05] have whatever you said
[1:21:06] he knew they had not the character they
[1:21:08] did not have the character for that yet
[1:21:10] but they didn't hinder him from trapping
[1:21:12] the promises upon them
[1:21:14] because the promises belong to them the
[1:21:16] secret things belong unto the lord about
[1:21:18] god
[1:21:18] but the things that are revealed belong
[1:21:20] unto us and to our children
[1:21:22] so jesus knew as sons of god these
[1:21:26] promises belong to them
[1:21:28] even though they didn't understand it
[1:21:29] even though the fear couldn't grasp it
[1:21:31] it belonged to them and these promises
[1:21:34] we preached
[1:21:35] by these promises by these promises
[1:21:38] hallelujah you become partaker of the
[1:21:40] divine nature
[1:21:42] these promises belong to you yes i know
[1:21:45] some of you are wary but the promise is
[1:21:46] yours
[1:21:47] yes i know some of you are tired but the
[1:21:49] promises are yours
[1:21:50] yes yes i know some of you have dead but
[1:21:53] the promise is still yours
[1:21:59] some of you people give up
[1:22:03] give up but the promise is still yours
[1:22:06] you may be seated if god wanted
[1:22:09] goku to bring him to land florida making
[1:22:12] honey

[1:31:04] you you ain't sure about that
[1:31:10] some of you need to listen back to some
[1:31:11] of the messages that preach already i
[1:31:13] talk about the layers of demon power god
[1:31:14] at the mind to find you
[1:31:18] you know why daniel had to wait how many
[1:31:21] days die out of it
[1:31:23] because gabriel was detained
[1:31:26] by evil spirits in a fight through but
[1:31:29] abram said if daniel stop praying the
[1:31:31] angel stop coming
[1:31:36] how many know that amen he said if
[1:31:38] daniel only stopped praying
[1:31:40] i got where he saw god no no ninja
[1:31:43] going back but daniel
[1:31:47] he believed god was going to answer
[1:31:50] so as he praying angel coming and he
[1:31:53] prayed right true daily angel come right
[1:31:55] through to him
[1:31:56] hallelujah daniel almighty man seeking
[1:31:59] god to find out
[1:32:00] the will of god hallelujah praise name
[1:32:03] of the lord
[1:32:05] but abraham you are written epistles
[1:32:06] read of all man twins are wrong
[1:32:09] read of all man manifested word of god
[1:32:12] peter and john they had no education
[1:32:14] but they had taken notice that remember
[1:32:15] jesus they were ignorant
[1:32:17] and unlearned but they were written
[1:32:19] epistles
[1:32:20] read that they had been with jesus read
[1:32:23] that they remember jesus cause
[1:32:24] jesus here we go was manifesting himself
[1:32:27] through them
[1:32:29] christ veiled in their flesh
[1:32:33] manifested made alive like he was in
[1:32:36] moses
[1:32:37] you see you you will recognize in what i
[1:32:40] am preaching and i've
[1:32:41] been doing this for years i emphasize
[1:32:43] strongly the life
[1:32:44] the manifestation i strongly emphasize
[1:32:47] that
[1:32:48] because i believe it has to come forward
[1:32:50] i cannot believe after
[1:32:51] 40 plus years we have to have more
[1:32:53] teachings and teachings and revelations
[1:32:55] and
[1:32:56] i i i really can't see that
[1:32:59] i am seeing that we are coming to
[1:33:00] ripeness and that's brotherly kindness
[1:33:03] early kindness is evidence of your
[1:33:04] rightness and after that the spirit have
[1:33:07] to come to connect with that
[1:33:09] okay so watch trees perfection from
[1:33:10] swollen prison the ministry
[1:33:13] comes to its perfection when it
[1:33:16] reproduce christ again in the natural
[1:33:19] among human beings and we read for you
[1:33:22] how virtue came under christ
[1:33:25] now we can't manufacture that we can
[1:33:28] pretend
[1:33:28] we can set somebody up touch me touch me
[1:33:30] touch man see vote you come out
[1:33:33] that's not working i don't have that and
[1:33:35] you ain't get you'll feel that
[1:33:37] that's not set up that's what i'm saying
[1:33:39] it can't work
[1:33:40] when christ come alive amidst his people
[1:33:44] the virtue gonna flow but abraham said
[1:33:46] you don't have to say anything
[1:33:48] he will make it known among men it will
[1:33:51] speak for itself
[1:33:55] so nobody would be uh uh god wouldn't
[1:33:58] you know people boasting it wouldn't
[1:34:00] have that it gonna be christ
[1:34:03] manifested middle like unlike his words
[1:34:06] here
[1:34:06] in the natural so in other words you
[1:34:09] have to see it
[1:34:11] in other words i say this way the word
[1:34:12] must become flesh
[1:34:14] not the word becomes more word but the
[1:34:17] word becomes
[1:34:18] flesh okay but the bible says here now
[1:34:21] if you've got the holy spirit in you
[1:34:23] then you're a candidate for association
[1:34:26] with the unseen world
[1:34:28] and the supernatural hallelujah
[1:34:31] watch when the holy spirit comes into
[1:34:33] the heart quickly
[1:34:34] you become a two full being one on the
[1:34:36] earth to die
[1:34:37] and one of heaven to live and this body
[1:34:39] is subject to death
[1:34:40] but in his soul he is passed from death
[1:34:43] unto life
[1:34:44] and this body has an early contact with
[1:34:46] five senses in his spirit
[1:34:47] he has contact with god through the holy
[1:34:49] ghost and the angel of god
[1:34:52] visit them and speaks with them and they
[1:34:55] are messengers sent from god
[1:34:56] to reveal and to bring messages of god
[1:34:59] to the individual
[1:35:01] oh praise the name of the lord do you
[1:35:02] believe that so the sea
[1:35:04] time is when the seed begins to take on
[1:35:06] life when these virtues begin to come
[1:35:08] alive
[1:35:09] at some point in time you see you cannot
[1:35:11] expect to be
[1:35:13] like uh you're born an adult son
[1:35:17] no you're growing god but about him said
[1:35:19] it this way
[1:35:20] when you say i want to get closer to god
[1:35:23] what you are saying is i want to grow in
[1:35:25] god
[1:35:26] when you have faith you want to get
[1:35:28] closer you need virtue
[1:35:30] when you have virtue i want to get
[1:35:31] closer to you i love you you want that
[1:35:33] means you want knowledge
[1:35:35] you want to get closer to god that means
[1:35:36] you want temperance then you want
[1:35:38] patience
[1:35:38] then you want god you see you're getting
[1:35:40] closer and afterwards you can't get any
[1:35:42] more closer
[1:35:43] you become one
[1:35:45] [Applause]
[1:35:49] so that's why that's why jesus come and
[1:35:51] say when you see me
[1:35:52] you see the father he says sure as the
[1:35:54] father but i thought you understand this
[1:35:56] thing by revelation when you see me
[1:35:58] you see the father the father is looking
[1:35:59] at me i'm a mature son now
[1:36:01] i'm ripened there's my spirit flowing
[1:36:03] freely
[1:36:04] the father is working through me if you
[1:36:06] don't believe me for what i'm saying to
[1:36:08] you my words believe me for the work
[1:36:11] sake you see right now nobody could say
[1:36:12] that
[1:36:14] because christ is not manifested in that
[1:36:17] way yet
[1:36:18] but jesus was in a position to say if
[1:36:20] you don't believe my words believe me
[1:36:22] for my work's sake
[1:36:24] in other words when the they had a man
[1:36:26] that was crippled
[1:36:27] and jesus asked them he said this will
[1:36:29] be forgiven day he spoke the words to
[1:36:31] the man
[1:36:32] and they had a problem with that and he
[1:36:33] knew that issues
[1:36:35] would pronounce and forgiveness their
[1:36:36] mind because only god could forgive sins
[1:36:38] so by saying i forgive you you pray you
[1:36:40] play in god
[1:36:42] you are saying i am god that what you're
[1:36:43] saying they say we disagree with that
[1:36:45] that can't be he said which one is
[1:36:47] easier
[1:36:48] which one is easier tell the man for
[1:36:50] your sins forgiven or
[1:36:52] pick up a bed and walk he said i could
[1:36:54] do both he said mister pick up your bed
[1:36:56] and walk
[1:36:58] and a man pick up his bed and walk and
[1:37:00] the car
[1:37:03] how could they deal with that
[1:37:08] because they can't do either he said i
[1:37:10] could do both
[1:37:11] because when your sins are forgiven you
[1:37:13] could be healed
[1:37:14] healing is evident your sins are
[1:37:16] forgiven because
[1:37:18] healing comes from that covenant of the
[1:37:20] blood
[1:37:21] oh glory to god so you can be healed
[1:37:22] today i look at what the doctor say
[1:37:26] i don't care how you feel you can be
[1:37:28] healed today
[1:37:30] during this service right now
[1:37:33] i'm not talking about tomorrow tomorrow
[1:37:35] the doctor could confirm that you are
[1:37:37] healed
[1:37:38] what i'm talking about right now heal
[1:37:42] completely be made whole
[1:37:45] hallelujah the preacher don't heal
[1:37:49] god is a healer and he's the same
[1:37:51] yesterday today and forever
[1:37:54] oh blessed be the name of the lord o
[1:37:57] praise his holy name
[1:37:58] isn't that right so i believe that there
[1:38:02] must be a manifestation of forgiveness
[1:38:04] a brotherly kindness before the dynamic
[1:38:07] strike i'm talking about a real
[1:38:12] manifestation not a taste it has
[1:38:16] i call it honey taste sweet in the mouth
[1:38:19] i'm not talking about that i'm talking
[1:38:21] about the honey that sticks
[1:38:23] the sticky honey the sticky honey the
[1:38:26] sticky one that the other one is the one
[1:38:27] that sticks
[1:38:28] i want to read something from a comment
[1:38:30] given on 18th of july 2010
[1:38:33] how oft shall i forgive my brother if he
[1:38:35] sins against me
[1:38:37] until 70 times this was spoken in new
[1:38:40] york and i want to read it
[1:38:42] now church you may be seated this is
[1:38:44] very important
[1:38:45] very important because you cannot if you
[1:38:47] cannot forgive
[1:38:48] you do not have a revelation of your
[1:38:50] requirement for the age
[1:38:52] are spoken by the prophet malachi 4 and
[1:38:55] you could never
[1:38:56] receive the holy ghost without this
[1:38:58] revelation
[1:39:00] abroadly kindness now on page 304
[1:39:04] which follows the manifestation of
[1:39:06] brotherly kindness
[1:39:08] malachi 4 is saying wait till them seven
[1:39:12] thunders utter their voices to the group
[1:39:14] that can handle the bible that can
[1:39:17] handle the word
[1:39:18] handle it in love speak to one another
[1:39:21] in love
[1:39:22] you don't have to have a title you
[1:39:25] you are to get in your position and
[1:39:28] everybody ready to handle the word
[1:39:30] to handle the word then the seven
[1:39:32] thunders after the voices of that group
[1:39:34] who is in position to handle the word
[1:39:37] that group
[1:39:38] that is ready and prepared by the lord
[1:39:40] himself
[1:39:41] for our seventh and revival no man can
[1:39:44] prepare you for that
[1:39:46] but they are the words of the prophet
[1:39:48] the son of man isn't that right
[1:39:50] from perfect faith now fear is based on
[1:39:51] forgiveness and we said this morning
[1:39:54] we are trying to get the church into a
[1:39:55] place to where we could see apostate
[1:39:57] times moving among us
[1:39:58] that's what we hunger for it's laying at
[1:40:00] the door
[1:40:01] and we wanted to flow to flow
[1:40:05] out to others so in other words the
[1:40:09] promise that we're moving into
[1:40:10] is not for us ourselves the promise
[1:40:13] we're moving into
[1:40:15] is to flow out to others it's you
[1:40:18] becoming your own dynamo it flow
[1:40:22] out of your bellies i'll flow something
[1:40:24] gonna flew out
[1:40:25] it going to go out to others now let's
[1:40:27] go so this
[1:40:29] is what we are waiting for forgiveness
[1:40:32] a flow not a one-time thing
[1:40:36] but a flow broadly kindness
[1:40:39] flowing out to flow out to others
[1:40:42] to call to the other sister churches to
[1:40:45] call to the others
[1:40:46] because the prophet said when the church
[1:40:48] finds his brotherly love
[1:40:50] holy reason c place in christ it will
[1:40:53] call
[1:40:53] to the other members of the body what
[1:40:55] are we calling come and rejoice with us
[1:40:58] we have found the coin that was lost
[1:41:00] listen to this so may i drop this
[1:41:02] this is brother coleman marriage of this
[1:41:04] testimony concerning a flow going out to
[1:41:06] others
[1:41:07] while listening to the first service in
[1:41:08] harrisburg the lord spoke to me to call
[1:41:11] by the billy paul
[1:41:12] considering the manifestation of
[1:41:14] brotherly kindness as spoken by brother
[1:41:16] brown
[1:41:17] so i phoned by the billy and gave my
[1:41:20] testimony
[1:41:21] concerning the meetings at harrisburg
[1:41:24] and told by the ability that i want to
[1:41:26] encourage you with this testimony
[1:41:28] i know how you have been waiting to see
[1:41:30] these things spoke my brother branham
[1:41:32] for this bright seven years requirement
[1:41:33] to be manifest
[1:41:35] knowing how your father's message was
[1:41:37] busted up into splinters
[1:41:38] so much misunderstandings and such but
[1:41:41] finally brother billy
[1:41:42] the message came down to seven age
[1:41:45] requirement in harrisburg
[1:41:46] it went into forgiveness and this is
[1:41:49] what happened at the meetings but a
[1:41:50] billion between six and nine
[1:41:52] that was laying right at the door
[1:41:53] perfect feet which is laying right at
[1:41:55] the door
[1:41:56] became a reality in harrisburg then
[1:41:59] brother billy sent back
[1:42:00] to brother coleman let me give you a
[1:42:02] testimony
[1:42:03] a group of 20 believers came directly
[1:42:06] from your convention to the tabernacle
[1:42:08] sunday july 11th
[1:42:09] i was not there but i was told i wish i
[1:42:12] wish i was there
[1:42:14] i was told that these 20 believers from
[1:42:16] the headstone time likely in trinidad
[1:42:18] came down this is about a belief to
[1:42:20] brother coleman
[1:42:21] where about a joke they really blessed
[1:42:23] random tabernacle
[1:42:24] and manifested a greater anointing of
[1:42:27] brotherly kindness
[1:42:28] in branham tabernacle and everybody is
[1:42:31] talking about it
[1:42:32] go out the prophet said let it flow
[1:42:36] let it flow to others amen everybody's
[1:42:38] talking about it so church
[1:42:39] catch what happened here i said a
[1:42:41] nucleus will go out
[1:42:43] and we'll go back and go out to other
[1:42:45] members of the body in other words
[1:42:47] broadly kindness into action so by the
[1:42:49] tear of it
[1:42:50] that was from brother tears over church
[1:42:52] god bless you and those believers in
[1:42:53] your church that did that
[1:42:54] that was a blessing to me go out and no
[1:42:57] doubt it will be noise abroad not only
[1:42:59] what happened but i'm tabernacle
[1:43:01] what happened at harrisburg so a mighty
[1:43:04] thing happened
[1:43:05] and it's got to excite you it excited
[1:43:09] really watch it's got to excite you
[1:43:11] because
[1:43:12] think about what happened what happens
[1:43:15] now
[1:43:16] when the seven thunders you got barely
[1:43:18] kindness but
[1:43:19] when the seven thunders uttered their
[1:43:22] voices
[1:43:23] to a group a people
[1:43:26] who is manifesting brotherly kindness
[1:43:30] who is manifesting their seventh age
[1:43:33] requirement
[1:43:34] they shall break forth healings there
[1:43:37] will break forth signs
[1:43:39] wonders miracles or point of the
[1:43:42] dynamics to their mechanics
[1:43:44] i might say this but a coleman this is
[1:43:46] barack woman bradley kindness
[1:43:48] is the revelation that releases the holy
[1:43:50] ghost
[1:43:56] but you don't have to look far to
[1:43:58] understand that
[1:43:59] you can just look at the pyramid after
[1:44:01] probably kindness is holy spirit
[1:44:04] so then what we said to us the night of
[1:44:06] the prophetic utterance in cairo 23
[1:44:08] years ago
[1:44:09] the holy spirit is trying to see one to
[1:44:12] seal the whole thing but
[1:44:13] where is the brotherly kindness where is
[1:44:15] the forgiveness
[1:44:16] oh hallelujah praise god just think
[1:44:20] the holy spirit can pour in upon you if
[1:44:24] there are no oughts
[1:44:25] in you against anybody there is nothing
[1:44:28] no devil to prevent you from receiving
[1:44:29] the holy ghost
[1:44:30] if there is no odds in other words you
[1:44:32] have rendered satan
[1:44:34] harmless oh praise anyway he cannot stop
[1:44:36] you oh blessed be the name of the lord
[1:44:38] isn't that right satan you can't do
[1:44:41] anything
[1:44:41] he is rendered harmless he cannot stop
[1:44:44] you
[1:44:44] oh glory to god because you have no odds
[1:44:47] he has nothing he can work through
[1:44:49] if everybody in this church no oughts no
[1:44:51] grudge the devil don't respect
[1:44:54] i find no fault in him ah
[1:44:58] glory hallelujah
[1:45:01] glory hallelujah no watch it doesn't
[1:45:04] matter what anybody has done to you
[1:45:08] it doesn't matter what anybody has done
[1:45:09] to you because
[1:45:11] you have an open vision of forgiveness
[1:45:14] which is the channel for charity to come
[1:45:16] down there that channel will flow out to
[1:45:19] the members of the body
[1:45:20] whosoever will so church do we finally
[1:45:23] understand
[1:45:24] that the seventh and the fate we have
[1:45:25] been speaking about is based
[1:45:27] on forgiveness you cannot get
[1:45:31] around it oh praise the name of the lord
[1:45:35] once that revelation from malachi 4
[1:45:38] has been established they must come to
[1:45:41] it
[1:45:42] or be cut off but the bride
[1:45:45] she humbles herself she drops her oat
[1:45:49] she forgives oh praise the name of the
[1:45:51] lord
[1:45:52] now i read that to say
[1:45:56] that this testimony was a sign
[1:45:59] that wasn't the real thing that was not
[1:46:02] the honey that sticks
[1:46:03] because some of the president who was in
[1:46:05] that not even in this church right now
[1:46:07] hallelujah hallelujah you understand
[1:46:09] what i'm saying so all of this is for
[1:46:11] science
[1:46:12] i am not talking about this i am talking
[1:46:14] about
[1:46:15] that that the prophets take of the honey
[1:46:18] that sticks
[1:46:19] there is going to be a manifestation
[1:46:22] of brotherly kindness i am not talking
[1:46:26] about revelation
[1:46:28] i am talking about manifestation
[1:46:31] let me give you all some praises now i
[1:46:34] read this
[1:46:35] to show this was a real experience
[1:46:39] but the terrence was there real holy
[1:46:40] spirit poured out people were crying
[1:46:43] real experience we had it in kaiowa you
[1:46:45] can't put it on
[1:46:47] it's a feeling amen it's a feeling of
[1:46:50] broadly kindness
[1:46:52] is that emotional hip-hop is not is that
[1:46:54] something
[1:46:55] it's a spirit of brotherly kindness it
[1:46:57] is what makes you put yourself
[1:46:59] on the brother's place on the matter
[1:47:02] before you
[1:47:02] judge somebody you put on their shoes
[1:47:06] and walk where they walk
[1:47:10] [Applause]
[1:47:14] for the burnham i'll restore all right
[1:47:17] amen now jesus spoke let boyd left
[1:47:20] paul said rather let by love continue
[1:47:22] that was in the first church
[1:47:24] but something taking place there's a
[1:47:26] fellow come by name of palmerwood
[1:47:28] and when he began to eat that vine of
[1:47:29] really love he cut the very sap line of
[1:47:31] it
[1:47:32] because it don't make any difference how
[1:47:34] smart we are how much we think we know
[1:47:36] how much we want to be different from
[1:47:38] somebody else but as long as that
[1:47:40] brotherly feeling isn't among us
[1:47:42] we are fighting a losing battle we can't
[1:47:46] win there is no way to win
[1:47:50] you you believe that as long as that
[1:47:54] brother is that what the devil does
[1:47:55] kill it and make doctrinal wars kill it
[1:47:59] but as long as that feeling is not there
[1:48:01] you can't win
[1:48:02] because faith is based on forgiveness
[1:48:06] oh hallelujah so to approach into sort
[1:48:09] of moving the perfect fate
[1:48:11] you have to have a forgiving heart isn't
[1:48:13] that right
[1:48:14] notice the first gift is wisdom the
[1:48:17] first
[1:48:18] gift of wisdom which is the best gift of
[1:48:20] the group
[1:48:21] if we don't have wisdom we won't know
[1:48:24] how to use knowledge
[1:48:26] which is a second gift so wisdom is how
[1:48:30] to use knowledge
[1:48:31] wisdom is first knowledge is second and
[1:48:34] if we can't use the second gift without
[1:48:35] wisdom how are we going to use the last
[1:48:37] interpretation all right no but imam
[1:48:40] said
[1:48:41] when the nomination isolates himself and
[1:48:44] separates his fellowship from his
[1:48:45] brethren
[1:48:46] that old palm room has eat the life out
[1:48:48] to begin with
[1:48:50] when we get to a place if you want to be
[1:48:52] different with a man why is the man i
[1:48:54] know
[1:48:55] i couldn't see either listen to this
[1:48:58] there's a man i know that i couldn't see
[1:49:00] eye to eye with as close in the
[1:49:02] scriptures anybody in the world is
[1:49:03] brother mo
[1:49:03] set in here and we do get times when we
[1:49:06] are
[1:49:07] million minds apart in the scriptures
[1:49:10] but random
[1:49:11] brother more but did that ever touch us
[1:49:13] no sir
[1:49:14] he loves me well enough not because he
[1:49:17] gives a penny of money no sir
[1:49:19] he flies on an old lockheed plane and
[1:49:20] everything else to get over here to be
[1:49:22] with me
[1:49:22] every little bit i don't believe that
[1:49:24] night would ever be too dark
[1:49:26] or the rain would ever fall too hard but
[1:49:29] what i'd
[1:49:30] climb and call to the jungles to get to
[1:49:32] him
[1:49:33] it's love and yet we wouldn't agree on
[1:49:37] scriptures by a hundred miles or
[1:49:38] millenniums and so forth like that
[1:49:40] on a security believer but that don't
[1:49:42] make it
[1:49:43] even a difference i am elected associate
[1:49:47] pastor to him
[1:49:48] i am so glad the power hadn't touched us
[1:49:50] yet
[1:49:52] and i am saying that for example that we
[1:49:55] could do
[1:49:56] between two men why can't everybody do
[1:49:58] it
[1:49:59] [Applause]
[1:50:02] but the problem is talking this is
[1:50:04] better more
[1:50:05] they have disagreement in scriptures but
[1:50:07] they still love each other
[1:50:12] i went to a church young long ago i
[1:50:14] thought they would never invite me back
[1:50:17] caught a bunch a little safety woman was
[1:50:19] bobbing their hair wearing lipstick i
[1:50:20] tore the thing apart
[1:50:22] showed it i thought he wouldn't ask me
[1:50:24] back but you know what
[1:50:25] there was so much anointing of the holy
[1:50:26] spirit around the vine till an old
[1:50:28] palmer woman couldn't touch it at all
[1:50:35] you know there's the electric fence the
[1:50:37] palmer woman can't get over that fence
[1:50:39] that does shock him is the holy spirit
[1:50:41] of love
[1:50:42] it will kill him every time brothers if
[1:50:45] we need to build a fence
[1:50:46] it ought to be he said if we need fences
[1:50:49] to build
[1:50:50] it ought not to be nurtured fences it
[1:50:51] ought to be love fences
[1:50:53] to keep the insect out to keep the palm
[1:50:56] of him out
[1:50:57] he is the devil's number one destroyer
[1:51:01] he said no you have cancer no you have
[1:51:04] this he said come with love the world is
[1:51:05] dying
[1:51:06] he said we have got fine scholarly
[1:51:07] churches wonderful builders but we got
[1:51:10] weak pulpits
[1:51:10] something is wrong the congregation
[1:51:13] don't feel to one another like they used
[1:51:15] to
[1:51:15] there is something missing the world is
[1:51:18] looking to that
[1:51:19] what we need is a baptism of love for
[1:51:21] one another
[1:51:22] that will all men know you are my
[1:51:24] disciples then you have loved one for
[1:51:27] another
[1:51:28] oh are we in the word this morning
[1:51:30] praise god praise god
[1:51:32] from him that is where the church is
[1:51:35] that's what the matter is they have lost
[1:51:38] their body love
[1:51:39] they have lost the feeling for one
[1:51:46] another
[1:51:52] he said talk about his illumina spirit i
[1:51:54] read this sometime before
[1:51:55] where is in africa he said now watch i
[1:51:57] believe
[1:51:58] the great lesson today is to try the
[1:52:00] spirit of anything have this women of
[1:52:02] spirit
[1:52:02] i do not think that we should ever by
[1:52:04] any means
[1:52:06] ever try to judge a person by the
[1:52:08] denomination they belong to
[1:52:09] by the group they associate with
[1:52:11] methodist baptist persuasion pentecostal
[1:52:13] or whatever they are
[1:52:14] we should never judge the man by the
[1:52:16] denomination that he belongs to
[1:52:17] we should always judge him by the spirit
[1:52:19] he has the spirit whether he's laterine
[1:52:22] for marine inner outer nouri whatever it
[1:52:24] might be
[1:52:25] we should never judge him by that but by
[1:52:28] his spirit
[1:52:29] we are to discern spirits watch now now
[1:52:31] i want to get this to the church this
[1:52:33] morning
[1:52:34] which is in deeper denominations you are
[1:52:36] still the church of the living god
[1:52:37] and the thing i want to get to you is
[1:52:39] this we are really not divided
[1:52:41] we are stones that cuts in different
[1:52:44] forms
[1:52:44] all to the glory of god now there are so
[1:52:47] many much in this day
[1:52:48] that we live in pertaining to gifts so
[1:52:50] many people judge people by gifts
[1:52:52] that they have well i believe all these
[1:52:54] are gifts i believe we
[1:52:56] what we see is gifts they are god-given
[1:52:57] gifts but if we do not use them the
[1:53:00] right way that god intended them to be
[1:53:02] used
[1:53:02] then we can do more harm with the gifts
[1:53:05] that we
[1:53:05] that none of we didn't have gifts the
[1:53:07] other night i made a statement on the
[1:53:09] pulpit saying this
[1:53:10] i would rather see bloody love existing
[1:53:13] among the church
[1:53:14] if we didn't have one case of divine
[1:53:16] healing
[1:53:22] we know we must know what these things
[1:53:24] are for now if a man comes and he has a
[1:53:26] great gift
[1:53:27] no matter if he belongs to our
[1:53:28] denomination or another nomination
[1:53:31] but you it doesn't matter how he dresses
[1:53:35] what you want to see is what is he
[1:53:37] trying to do with that gift
[1:53:38] what purpose he has if he's trying to
[1:53:40] take his influence and build himself a
[1:53:42] great name out of it
[1:53:43] i'll have this woman of spirit enough to
[1:53:45] know that's wrong
[1:53:46] no matter how great a teacher he is how
[1:53:48] powerful he is how intellectual he is
[1:53:50] how his gift operates if he isn't trying
[1:53:52] to achieve something
[1:53:54] for the benefit of the body of christ
[1:53:56] your own spiritual desire will tell you
[1:53:58] that's wrong
[1:53:59] no matter how accurate how perfect how
[1:54:01] it is is wrong
[1:54:02] if it isn't used for the body of christ
[1:54:05] to achieve something maybe you got a
[1:54:07] great gift that he could draw people
[1:54:08] together with a great intellectual or
[1:54:10] spiritual power he could draw people
[1:54:11] together maybe
[1:54:12] he's trying to take a gift or make
[1:54:14] himself famous that he have a big name
[1:54:16] other person will look up to him as a
[1:54:17] big person that's wrong
[1:54:19] maybe he's trying to edify a certain
[1:54:21] thing here he wants everybody else to
[1:54:23] get out of the picture
[1:54:23] let him and his group be in the picture
[1:54:25] that's still wrong but if he has a gift
[1:54:27] of god and he's trying to edify the body
[1:54:29] of christ
[1:54:30] then i don't care what he belongs to you
[1:54:32] are not discerning the man
[1:54:34] you are discerning the spirit the life
[1:54:37] that's in the man
[1:54:39] and that is what god told us to do not
[1:54:41] one time has he ever commissioned that
[1:54:43] is in the man's group
[1:54:45] but he we are constrained and commanded
[1:54:47] by god to discern
[1:54:48] the spirit in the man what he's trying
[1:54:51] to do
[1:54:52] what the spirit in his life is trying to
[1:54:54] lead him to and then
[1:54:55] we can find out that he's trying to lead
[1:54:57] the people not bring them up bring them
[1:54:58] together
[1:54:59] to bring the church of the living god
[1:55:01] not to one denomination but to an
[1:55:02] understanding to a fellowship
[1:55:04] to a unity of spirit that is what he's
[1:55:07] pointing to calvary that's what you want
[1:55:09] oh praise god oh blessed be the name of
[1:55:12] the lord
[1:55:14] i'll read it what he said listen a
[1:55:15] moment i would rather have a church that
[1:55:17] knows nothing about any spiritual gift
[1:55:19] but just being so in love with each
[1:55:21] other and with christ
[1:55:22] i rather have that than every spiritual
[1:55:24] gift operated in the church
[1:55:26] now that my son had in a pentecostal
[1:55:28] group i would rather have it
[1:55:30] where there's gifts they'll feel where
[1:55:32] their gifts they'll bring confusion
[1:55:34] whether it's gifts they can be
[1:55:35] questioned whatever is love
[1:55:38] is perfect that's right and if you have
[1:55:41] perfect love
[1:55:42] you'll have perfect gifts so work with
[1:55:44] love first
[1:55:45] and that brings fellowship and
[1:55:47] fellowship bring gifts
[1:55:49] work with love love brings what
[1:55:53] fellowship if we say we have no sin we
[1:55:55] deceive ourselves the truth and not in
[1:55:57] us
[1:55:57] but if we confess us and he's faithful
[1:55:59] to amen
[1:56:01] and the blood of jesus cleanses us from
[1:56:03] all sin and we have fellowship one with
[1:56:05] another
[1:56:06] why because the same blood for you is
[1:56:07] for me isn't that right
[1:56:10] so what the church needs tonight is to
[1:56:12] know how to control these gifts
[1:56:13] for evil spirits can come in and speak
[1:56:16] just the same as good spirits can speak
[1:56:18] for satan can imitate every gift that
[1:56:20] god's got
[1:56:21] every gift he can the intimidate you
[1:56:24] must know
[1:56:25] the right and the wrong and by the
[1:56:28] fruits you're going to know it
[1:56:29] watch whether it come to pass whether
[1:56:31] it's truth or not and that's the way of
[1:56:33] the spirit
[1:56:34] notice we are given gifts by measure
[1:56:36] christ was given the gifts without
[1:56:37] measure
[1:56:38] is that right he had it without measure
[1:56:40] and
[1:56:41] christ it will be like a spoonful of
[1:56:43] water out of the ocean
[1:56:44] the chemicals in it is the same one
[1:56:46] spoon from the ocean
[1:56:48] is just the same chemical content as the
[1:56:49] ocean and you're talking that's the way
[1:56:51] it is
[1:56:52] that's the way we are when we are
[1:56:53] yielding to the spirit is the same
[1:56:55] spirit working through every gift
[1:56:57] are you talking about a woman that
[1:56:58] drinks some radium and she died
[1:57:00] and years later they still find it
[1:57:02] pulsing on her
[1:57:03] oh pray i'll skip i'll skip that okay
[1:57:06] paul reader
[1:57:07] who perhaps preached right in his time
[1:57:08] and i could see him pulpit
[1:57:11] he said one time he and his wife were
[1:57:12] sitting on the table
[1:57:14] she wanted to do something he said
[1:57:16] there's no need to do that
[1:57:17] somehow he hurt a feeling and he thought
[1:57:19] well if a feeling is that easy hurt
[1:57:21] let them hurt
[1:57:27] he got up lay the people on the table
[1:57:30] went down to the street her custom was
[1:57:33] that she would meet him at the door kiss
[1:57:34] him goodbye
[1:57:35] and when he went out to the end of the
[1:57:36] gate he always looked back on the wave
[1:57:38] well she kissed him goodbye went out to
[1:57:41] the end of the gate
[1:57:42] looked back and she waved and said
[1:57:45] he started down the street and something
[1:57:47] began to condemn him
[1:57:50] he said what if she would die today when
[1:57:53] you're gone
[1:57:54] what if something would happen to you
[1:57:57] with that strange
[1:57:58] feeling that family of fear he got
[1:58:00] condemned
[1:58:02] he turned around run back real quick
[1:58:04] joke open the gate
[1:58:05] went in throw up in the door look around
[1:58:07] he couldn't see her he heard her she was
[1:58:09] behind the door crying

[1:58:13] walked
[1:58:14] around there looked right in her face
[1:58:15] and kissed her again
[1:58:17] turn around went back out the gate she
[1:58:18] stand standing wave again

[2:04:25] way up the road now
[2:04:27] soon the coming of the lord jesus we
[2:04:28] have got to have rapture and faith in
[2:04:30] the church
[2:04:31] listen that will be changed in a moment
[2:04:32] with nominee or we will not go
[2:04:34] but don't you worry it will be there it
[2:04:37] will be there
[2:04:38] and when the power of this church rises
[2:04:40] it will bring the bedroom
[2:04:42] the power of that church rises it will
[2:04:43] bring the bedroom the poor of that shall
[2:04:45] will rise it will bring the other
[2:04:46] bedroom
[2:04:46] and then there will be a general
[2:04:48] direction we are looking forward to it
[2:04:50] so the prophet prophesy that the power
[2:04:52] would arise in the church
[2:04:54] oh how many believe that which is the
[2:04:57] dynamics of this church
[2:04:59] which is the virtue powerful service it
[2:05:01] has to come into the church
[2:05:03] do you believe that promise hallelujah
[2:05:06] but the brandon said angel of the lord i
[2:05:09] know the next thing is to happen
[2:05:11] is the restoration of the gifts of the
[2:05:13] church and it's the hardest thing i've
[2:05:15] had to do
[2:05:16] in this pioneering work is to do this
[2:05:19] god
[2:05:20] cannot give back the gifts to the church
[2:05:23] as long as his church is divided
[2:05:28] we have got to get the church together
[2:05:30] before the gifts can come
[2:05:32] and if all of the full gospel people
[2:05:34] could come in one at one accord
[2:05:37] there would be a revival that would
[2:05:39] shape the whole world
[2:05:40] and every spiritual gift would be in the
[2:05:44] church
[2:05:44] within an hour time after it took place
[2:05:48] signs and wonders that was done by the
[2:05:49] apostle would be a minor thing
[2:05:52] to what do if we could get the church
[2:05:54] together
[2:05:55] it's got to happen it will happen
[2:06:00] oh hallelujah he said it got to happen
[2:06:03] and he prophesied he said it will happen
[2:06:07] it may be after and pass off the scene
[2:06:09] but i want to put my word in this
[2:06:11] that you might know my voice in this oh
[2:06:13] blessed be the name of the lord
[2:06:15] hallelujah
[2:06:17] hallelujah oh praise god he said they've
[2:06:20] got they have been brides prize brides
[2:06:22] but they've got to come one
[2:06:23] that not only have the mechanics but the
[2:06:25] dynamics
[2:06:26] oh hallelujah dynamics and mechanics
[2:06:29] together oh blessed be the name of the
[2:06:30] lord
[2:06:31] do you believe that praise god praise
[2:06:34] god
[2:06:34] he said there were cowards in the upper
[2:06:36] room but all of a sudden the dynamics
[2:06:38] come what did they do
[2:06:39] it not only felt their spirit but it
[2:06:41] quickened their mechanics
[2:06:42] their bodies were quickened they were no
[2:06:44] more cowards they went straight into the
[2:06:46] face of the people he said you men and
[2:06:47] judea you know dwell in jerusalem
[2:06:49] before the dynamics come they were just
[2:06:51] mechanics but when the holy ghost came
[2:06:54] upon them
[2:06:54] they quickened inside the dam oh the
[2:06:57] whole being was changed
[2:06:59] inside change they were so quick and
[2:07:01] that their tongues changed
[2:07:03] they spoke in another language they were
[2:07:05] so quick and when they lay hands on the
[2:07:06] point they're sick
[2:07:08] the sick had to recover that's the
[2:07:10] quickening power
[2:07:11] that is what this promise may the lord
[2:07:13] bless you as we stand
[2:07:15] and give god some praises oh jason
