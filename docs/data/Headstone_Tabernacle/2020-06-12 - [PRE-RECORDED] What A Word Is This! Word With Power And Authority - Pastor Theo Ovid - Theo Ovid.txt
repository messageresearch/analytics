your seats and welcome to Sunday morning feasts around the Word of God amen it was always a pleasure to come into the house of God it's always a privilege I know people just take it for granted go to church go to church but it wouldn't always be like that and you know that praise the name of the Lord well Tuesday night what a prayer meeting we had on Tuesday night and I want to thank all of you for coming out this morning for the sama prayer before service what a atmosphere we want to continue to continue to do that to come early impress all we and I call it a ministry of Prayer those who want to join the prayer various warriors Pereira's isn't that right a Holy Office of Prayer and we shared something I want to bring back something from what we spoke on just before we start the service but we Jesus the word said you have not because you ask not that's why I don't have when you ask your acts without feet you have to ask and fit to believe and the receive isn't that right praise be to God and God ordained prayer as a means obtain what we desire and the thought we shared on Tuesday was give him no rest under the scripture from Isaiah the scriptorium ever and maybe you never thought about but it's a powerful scripture from Isaiah chapter 62 and read in verse 6 and 7 and it reads I have set watchmen upon my thigh walls o Jerusalem which I'll never hold their peace they know night ye that make mention of the Lord keep not silence and give him no rest don't worry Lord now give him no rest till he establish until he make Jerusalem a freeze in the earth and that was the exhortation until tonight give him no rest trouble God knock until the door is open seek until you find ask until is be given don't be discouraged don't give up keep pressing forward ever forward believing that God going to answer his world because God want to confirm his word isn't that right and we want to have the confident expectation of an answer is a waste of time just talking to God and you have no expectation it's a waste of time that you're not even believing and I expected that go on to answer your prayer but when you come believing and expectant then you're on your way in a channel that God could bless you isn't that right an answer in prayer comes by feet come by parents come by praying in his name and come by the will of God all of that put together but the climax of all of that is in sin John 15:7 and it says if he abide in me and my words abide in you you can ask what you will and it shall be done unto you so it comes to a life it come down not just to a performance and just words it come down to you Abidin and the world abiding in you and then you can ask what you will isn't that right so praise God so true the power of prayer God purpose is accomplished in the church hallelujah God is waitin for the people to pray to call his servants and on the scene and by yielding our lives to the Spirit of God we can restore to a healthy order of God isn't that right by giving to the Spirit of God so at this time you understand and we want to go into the word this morning a tree portion of Scripture Genesis chapter 32 Isaiah chapter 40 and Luke chapter 4 first scripture reading this morning blessed be the name of the Lord John go for the service last Sunday and the service before that but Anthony the sword of the Spirit which is the word of God but Isaac speaking about return unto the Lord and the final showdown I was something Eamon praise God blessed be the name of the Lord so Genesis chapter 32 we want to read one verse verse 28 and he said thy name shall be called no more Jacob but Israel for as a prince has no power with God and with men and has prevailed as a chapter 41 a repro foolish 28:31 hast thou not known has thou not heard that the everlasting God the God the Lord the creator of the ends of the earth fainteth not neither is weary there is no searching of his understanding he given power to the faint unto them that have no might he increases strength even the youths shall faint and memory and the young men shall utterly fall but they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength they shall mount up with wings as Eagles they shall run and not be weary they shall walk and not faint and I looked up to for wanna read from verse 32 to 36 Luke chapter 4 this scripture is after Jesus was led by the spirit into the wilderness and he was tempted by the devil and then he went into the temple took up the scriptures and read the scripture of the spirit upon me are we go on don't know to verse 32 and they were astonished at his doctrine for his word was with power and in the synagogue there was a man which had a spirit of an unclean devil and cried out with a loud voice saying let us alone what have we to do with thee doubt Jesus of Nazareth I don't come to destroy us I know thee who thou art the Holy One of God and Jesus rebuked him saying hold thy peace and come out of him when the devil was shown him in the midst he came out of him and heard him not and they were all amazed and speak among themselves seeing what what is this for with authority and power he commanded the unclean spirits and they come out let us pray father we thank you for your word may you come Lord and interpret it into hearts and Tara into our lives we are waiting on you as your elect in this last hour when gross darkness cover the earth and covering the people you promise to send light God we invite you to come and have the preeminence among us today in Jesus and we ask it amen you may be seated praise God this morning of a title what a wood is this wood with power and authority I took that from the scripture you read that's what the people said when Jesus come forth in the action denoted that his word was with power I'm an inspiration virtue powerful service is here to bring the mechanic pyramid wood to life that's my inspiration virtue powerful service is here to bring the mechanic pyramid word to life and I have some homework for you to do this week I want you to look at and listen to the message called Britain's the 24th of January 1965 which means you could sit up voice of God recordings and you could listen to it or you could read it a bhoot means 24th of January in 1965 this coming Saturday from 4 to 6 we have a special time of Prayer here for everyone amen praise be to Jesus blessed be the name of the Lord so I like that script in Isaiah give him no rest give him no rest ok let's go are you ready revelation 13:1 and I stood upon the sand of the sea and saw a beast rise up out of the sea and having seven heads ten horns upon his horns ten crowns upon his heads names of blasphemy I'm the Beast which I saw was like unto a leopard his feet was the feet of a beer his mount as the moat of a lion and the dragon gave him his power and his seat and great Authority and I saw one of the heads as it were wounded to death and his deadly wound was healed and all the world wondered after the Beast and they worshiped the dragon listened which gave power unto the beasts and they worshipped the Beast saying who is like unto the Beast who was able to make war with him and there was given unto him a mouth given to him his beasts amount speaking great things and blasphemies and power was given unto him to continue forty and two months and he opened his Mountain blasphemy against God to blaspheme his name his tabernacle and them that dwell in heaven it was given unto him to make war with the Saints and to overcome them and power was give him under him over all Kindred's I want you to see something what is being given ah is being given authority is given given I want you to see what is given to the whole system of the beasts and the dragon I what is coming we can't change that this is authorized decree hallelujah things that be kind of changed let's continue and he open his mouth okay I was given unto him to make war with the Saints and to overcome them and power was given him over all Kindred's and tongues and nations and all that dwell upon the earth shall worship Him whose names are not written in the book of life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world and that is why you should have a praise upon your hearts every time you walk into this church every time you wake up in the morning thank you lord not only are you alive but God put your name in the Lamb's Book of Life and it could truly worship and give God glory and give honor isn't that right don't ever be silent always open your motr give God praise don't ever be quiet praise God hallelujah don't ever be silent say thank you lord i love you lord i worship you I appreciate you I adore you thank you for every trial every turn you're not looking for away okay one look if our way up praise God amen hallelujah glory hallelujah thank you Jesus revelation 13:11 12 and I beheld another beast coming out of the earth and he had two horns like a lamb and he spake as a dragon and he exercised it here we go all the power the first piece was before him and causeth the earth and them which dwell on the earth to worship the first beast whose deadly wound was healed we in a new season we are a new time because the angel of the Lord is on earth fix and things are wrong Donald Trump didn't become president by chance it wasn't a mistake it wasn't a flukes he had been placed there and there's a purpose for him being dear America has switched overnight nothing couldn't stop it not the press not the critics not has advocated not his enemies nothing could stop it and if nothing couldn't stop him we're gonna stop this pride when God prophesied praise God and I will restore praise God hallelujah Verizon preached a message the final showdown and we are coming down to it now oh yes is not this church versus that church is not this group here that troop is that destruction versus that doctrine it's the bride versus Lucifer oh yes it's the bride versus the whole beast system all it's bigger than you think hallelujah it is bigger than you think oh let's continue but a Branham from 3 to Exodus he was saying what Martin Luther King at that time and was a civil rights 1960's this is 1963 and he was talking about I don't agree with the spirit I don't think the Holy Spirit agreeing with him it's all the people all worked about just like Hitler and over in Germany and let them take that trap them precious Germans then lead by Billy millions pile up on one another I'm on tape you will see it after maybe after I'm gone that's exactly what's going to happen then precious people will die down there like flies start a revolutionary but white and colored will fight again and die like flies and when it's all over a bunch of their people but the arrays up of fear who know not Joseph the same thing today a man took out in the white house that will not swear his oath will not take that he believes in freedom of religion let's go a little further so readin at this time Rameses and Egypt was growing his power was growing the natural man Ramses was growing the natural man the Antichrist is growing now true politics he already got to the White House in religion he got the people all scrupled up till they'll fall for it and denominational leaders practically every one of them in the nation is already in the confessional churches Ramses is growing and they are uniting together and that is what they will have what does it do it makes a power Abby's just like the first come in just like the first one then here we go you listening this one there's a persecution coming upon all those who won't unite with it this is not perhaps this is not maybe this is prophecy there's a persecution coming for those who would unite with it and a boycott but it will be tool in them you already don't took the mark don't say I'll do it you better do it now Ramses is growing but remember why Romney's is growing in power in Egypt God had Moses in the wilderness and he was growing too so while Ramses is growing born of a bride and she is growing true and if God placed that man in power in America God wanted positionally place to brag by power and authority on the air what sites are growing there's gonna be a showdown are you gonna get ready for it are you prepared for it that's gonna be a final showdown even at this prophesied there'll be one more ride Oh gives a lot of shout in the house Oh hallelujah remember why Ramses was growing in the power in Egypt God had Moses in the wilderness he was going to Ramses had a political system Gore had a spiritual system under profit ready to come down and speak to the people oh praise God revelation 6 4 and they went out another horse that was red and was given to him I think in Sam said I've said it once I heard it twice power belongs to God power comes from God God reads the fear of our purpose God promote this one for a purpose he promoted this one to cut him down to show he is God Oh hallelujah I feel good this morning because this would count like God is not a man that we're like God is true they went out another horse was red and power was given unto him that sat thereon to take peace from the earth and that they should kill one another and there was given to him great a great short duration 6-8 and I looked and behold a pale horse his name that sat on him was death and hell followed him and power was given unto them over the fourth part of the to kill with sword with hunger with debt I with the beasts of the earth Oh hallelujah but a Branham from now is in church age he said remember we all have shown clearly through the ages and even as Adam and Eve fell because they left the word so the Ephesians it fell by turning slightly from the world until with every age continuing to turn away we have a final relation of the word by the world church system this loud ISA age ends in a black hole of the word thereby causing a departure of the Lord from the midst he stand outside calling his own who follow him by obedience to the word after a short and powerful demonstration of the Spirit this little hunted persecuted group will go to be with Jesus I want to read that again after a short and powerful demonstration of the Spirit this little hunted persecuted group will go to be with Jesus so we are not here for church we are here for God we are here for the word and the word prophesied that the bride will be a hunted persecuted group but she will have a powerful demonstration of the Spirit and when that bride ministry began to roll they will say what word is this hallelujah what the word is this because this would come with power I'm a Pharisee Oh hallelujah it wouldn't be teaching it wouldn't be explaining it wouldn't be just called him back homes it was what word is this because this preaching is different this is preaching with authority because the Devas are being cast out the sick is being healed the crippled is walking the bynars here what manner of man is this or gives a lot some praises people Oh glory to God hallelujah hallelujah Oh plurid oh god praise God Oh hallelujah I'd 1/4 pull over your life upset your life flip things over I want what to bankrupt you from the world not the devil recognize you so bankrupt you try even recover from the world we can't get back the world you can't get back the things of the world Oh hallelujah praise be to Jesus hallelujah praise called a Democrat you movies at you TV at you flash at you lost at you they'll capture it back your bankrupt praise God your drunken God praise God hallelujah praise for the devil's he's a waste of time trying to attract you he's swinging all kind of things in front of you but you have nothing to connect with that praise God praise God may God free this morning miss you this morning [Applause] let me see said prints gone timber Isaac spoke about recognizing the DNS message you have to recognize the D and your message from that message but Aram says national force put Israel in a homeland national force will put the church in the work on some churches what is he saying it will become the law just that they have key and all these marriages are not kind of stuff in America it has become law not a matter of realize right or wrong it's dello they keep the Bible of the church their schools they kick pray all the schools and whatnot that's their law constitutional rights and so on okay they want to make America great again that's what the president said right but they don't even know what America whole America begin great to begin with you can't make it again if you don't hold that way I say once more Lord you had to be somewhere first the ball once more Sampson knew what he was talking about Samson wasn't guessing oh I wonder what happened up there no he felt it before he was in contact with power before he had it before he was involved in it before he took up the gates and throw it off he destroyed the lion he licked on the Philistines they were afraid of Samson France and knew what powers and he lost it but he's a son he has available he is available to him yes you may have lost it but you can still get it back that's why he said once more Lord [Applause] you might be seasoned the Bible says did establish the wilderness because the world it was a mix would fit didn't make it because the word all them hear the same word but with two men Joshua and Caleb have effect upon them they couldn't help it that's why Caleb said is we are more than able to take the land he was convinced because they've got promises this is if God promised power power is coming when are you ready or not it's still coming my you should be shouting on that one where are you already say it or not its power has been given to these men and power are they given to the beasts you mean power will not be given to the bride [Applause] my god I want to fear to reach out to no powers for you glory not be system that's why you have to worship you have to know what your worship in if you want to know what you're praying for and what you're crying out for when Jesus finished by the disciples listen listen when Jesus died and they were sad got him Jesus dead and everything else Jesus rose from the dead walking with him and it's sad and I'm sad and telling Jesus stories and she's also rebuked them and so fools and slow of heart stop that storytelling thing Christ was supposed to pass through that and all things work together for good or they supposed to have a different beat altogether a different understanding altogether praise God it was sad and depressed my lord go on Jesus gone like with no revelation but Jesus appeared unto them peace be unto you praise God I'll begin to unveil the word to them and I give them a big promise he gave them a

what not it will be so all the time it will be there is my spirit flowing freely understand this the objective of God is to make each one of your branch connected to him divine the objective of God is that the mix of vines sub branches is branch connected so you become a channel a pipe a floor no hindrances no obstacles just a flow in your life [Applause] my God my god hallelujah all glory to God thank you Jesus hallelujah hallelujah with all the other failures God still make him King hallelujah God make some sense of triumph over the Philistines God is God he gives power it's not let's continue but a Branham we talk about Ramses and so on they're both growing together it would be assured on one of these days it will come to a showdown watch and you can't get away from it the Holy Spirit coming down the mysteries of God been revealed and set in order she is already in the white house the church is pulling itself together that's the bride pulling itself together not a denomination no out of bondage away from the AMA rights of people that is free so nobody got campus and see it could only go so far and no more she dies what he'd ever like to do you cramp your style isn't that right hinder you sometimes telling people it's only wrong twisting your stories when you telling the story is a setup block you're here I'm blocking here because they don't want to go forward they don't want you progress they want you to be hindered because they want to feel that they better than you and the better and you all as foolishness praise God that's why when Abraham tell pick pick pick pick choose choose me I want to go and let's see Sodom and look to what Saddam's the angry near nor they go into words lot didn't enter London said oh no no no he was just going towards but anyway where direction is way efficient that way hidden wherever they reached really denies he will fall so if you want righteousness if you want holiness everyone purity if you want undefined life if you want a revival you have to lean that we isn't that right remember remember the enemy is the intellectual sign and I know people fight this kind of gospel because they don't want no spirit in the one talking team because they could talk plenty and the biggest oven but when it come down to what good is this the word come with power that's different you can't manufacture that no that has to be produced by the spirit itself because Christ watch are the monitor now remember there's only true don't forget this there are only two powers one is spiritual power of the Holy Spirit the other one is the devil working through intellectual power and that's what happened again the Eden's so understand this there's only two powers there's only two forces devil and God it's not right in Egypt there is intellectual power we can Ramsey's bringing him bring him up to power and raise him up no listen it's not intellectual it's an intellectual power I don't forget that part it's not this brother just intellectual it's an intellectual power the man is empowered by his intellect so he's not trying to like you know he's not professor then he's anointed intellect as a different kind you know they could flip that word so much ever you stunned you're so study cameraman happened I say I has nothing upon your life you stunned and I want to go back for more because he is it nice and listen and hear what none it doesn't challenges your faith it's challenge you to believe the man cut the man is stunning he's handsome he's tall he's felling like to hear sure sterling handsome like the his soul he's head heel and so on but when goal I had commonly seen send me a man to fight me somebody donate yeah hear the ringing coach i hey Denise the dynamite consume send me a man to fight

churches and deacons and elders but the last time in there I'm a church pinned on there is a division who's not circumcised felissa who define the armies of the Living David perspective was different altogether this perspective he saw the armies of the Living God and he saw that one man not to cut them guys his characters itself them fellows lines they have one big man and they showing off why didn't put a - an uncommon fight Israel did notice was not a chance but have a champion glad by I've got it have other Goliath's this one is I've got this one of that does he want he's terrible oh yes he's a feared man did your position come before him David if it's a vivid decide to talk and source other will offers you'll give him a daughter you'll get money if it's keep all that keep all that

say she could see by yourself I am not married I'm not interested in Mariner she could go by she sir she on home nobody want to marry her nobody wanna Maya after the qualification is the physical but David David say why I was you see no that's what he testimony come this is a very power of God come this way you and God and your testimony comes his restraint of your personal individual testimony you have to have it it's not a good testimony it's your place no testimony that testimony of yours is what gives you the power to face what you are gonna face you have to meet God yourself you have to begin contact with God Ross that's your testimony hallelujah and the army our support everybody want Muslims we can have trouble early on the army come and fight but David said while I was there a lion king a beer came and a deal with him a lion came a deal with him under God Missy this is the whole point I lick him up but the God that delivered the beer into my hands David didn't kill credit for himself yes I handle him I deal with him but core delivered him into my hands God delivered Allah will deliver this man into my hands praise God hallelujah isn't that right you're not David attitude yes i am david and here were common fort no so I said like Alex spear newly-minted and whatnot pour it on David put it on dividend multiple John you know but in respects if we respected man respecting office he holds that's the king that is talking the king offer first minted I don't know PCC or whatever it is very visual I know he title whatever quality are might is it freshly minted David put it on device had a walk and he's had to walk like you're doing a breakdancing things Ted a walk like that Susan and you start to walk like that so David say I cannot walk in this I can't move in this I can't fit in this I don't want to fight the way he coming on fightin this get us off for me please I want to be free I want to I want to be what I am I don't want you to churchy five minutes you-you-you defeated in Armand you want me to wear that you an Israeli Amma and you want me to wear that I'm not wearing that gonna respect and honor so then do lassies little fella Cumberland and he coming up with would only he had power and he got me to demonstrate that's it ready up the power when David went girl axiom girls swim back he said I'm a hot dog you mean you know respect for me that took a fella around for me you will send people to meet me I will feed him to the birds I'll cut the head off Oh hallelujah that's power that's power to professor that's power to professor in the face of what look my independent defeat he prophesy I will knock your head off Angela come down with his heavy self all of them coming at it how you sling lien and that is Goliath head right there and David accustomed Lewis is not like a first time you lose you this is sling your custom killing birds killing day skill in that or a big old target like that how could he miss that the base I can't miss that that bigger than a bird daddy biggest thing I wrong right now here like a bull's-eye sign collateral like a bull's-eye today that all David Shaw has that spot and he lose that stone and quad was behind that stone he ever couldn't miss if he tried it on he moved the stone I'm moving through guided missile tied it to the target bull's eye today you shall receive power Oh glory to God we know the story you may be seated what is interesting though when glass fell down is really moving he couldn't show he did the celestial then fell over so paralyzed by fear of this giant in their life that they refused to move on till gula and David cut his head over we win us soul was happy okay we good only until this is just being sing a special so i'll kill a thousand individual ten thousand wrong special after that source had a watch divert cookie i you know the story trouble since then after that but it's something when you have to come into a position of power the tone gets into power in a group formation god place you as an individual and empower you in your spirit in your heart in your mind david was anointed to be king praise God Samuel came and poured oil upon him and David had to go back because he's not ready yet you may not be ready yet but that doesn't mean it's not you I want to be a man than that I'm talking about you or praising the Lord praise goes to be goes further so they got their own system it's not what the Bible said is what the church said see and the Protestants we've listened weave into it till in their little groups well sure I know it says this but I tell you them days is gone the intellectual parts look perfect here is balm and it is perfect but it's perfect the inspirational season and its intellectual Rameses was growing commented to the throne remember he raised up as a brother to Moses see one of them had the intellectual seat and like Joseph his brethren what did I do to little Joseph excommunicate him from the world the wood is God they excommunicated the world and accepted a Creed and now the Creed has grown into power so even the Creed communist power so everybody coming to power you know it will be assured on the don't you tell you cover the power I never say no God she come to power I am doing it's power versus Power let's continue quality with individuals here we go not with groups with individuals only thing has to do is the one man he could operate wit that's all he wants is one man he tried to get them true every age he gonna get one man one man decent Noah one man is Elijah one man is a John the Baptist one man is all he needs these are judges you get one man Samson given great power he stole it a woman was blinded its judges wasn't so God is the judge you see he's trying to get one man here we go that can he can get in his hands and tell the truth that will be fearless with it that won't pull no punches that will not be dogmatic one man he can hold his hands and show it with a life and show himself alive one man and pizza and disciples they struggled after being given power okay they were given power the Castro there was and so on they didn't have the Holy Ghost yet but they were given power and they were doing a lot of stuff with the power that were released upon them even Judas had power because it was given to them so God could give you power but you still need character isn't that right because afterwards Pete and get frightened and they get afraid because the power was no longer there with them because Jesus died left and go on they were susi with Jesus and if you associate with somebody with authority you come back you are the authority to so come back if I know the Prime Minister not Prime Minister my friend I could talk to Prime Minister you know any Prime Minister you know I could get his ears so they had got ears too because Jesus was your buddy they were part of the system of connection to the higher up and they could see this woman come and this one common and worship and this woman come and dig bringing they were the men around Jesus so they were effectively empowered but a man on rising on his son listen to his words they were cowards but they had the mechanics are you with me they had received the word the world was in them they had the mechanics but they were cowards but they were all sit in back seat I'm afraid of them I'm afraid to go out and make a claim cause them big bishops and things out there my freedom presum things I'm a free to make a clean but all of a sudden dynamics come this is what we regional now all of a sudden this empowers this mechanic pyramid inside of them a word inside of them cowards but the word in them codes but the word in them afraid disturb d'Arnaud but the word in them all of a sudden dynamics come what did it do are you ready it's not only fill their spirit inside but it quickened their mechanics their bodies were quickened there were no more cowards so the Spirit of God is to affect entire life including your body not just your mind not just your spirit not just your soul but your body itself have a promise to be influenced by this quitman power [Applause] that's our promise hallelujah your body itself to be anointed with God Oh hallelujah could be go some more their bodies were quicken they were no more cowards they went right out in the face of people you men are Judea you that dwell in Jerusalem where before the dynamics come they were just mechanics him and mother Clarence so before dynamics come it's just mechanics Billy the message please the word amen glory hallelujah read a book is nothing mechanics but when dynamics come that's different that's different altogether he managed Islam right I'm one of them this is that that the Prophet spoke of and he said if this isn't that will keep the stir that comes no this is that I'll pour my spirit upon all flesh so Peter was taught in the prophecy of Joyal of the point of the Spirit so this is then they were not just written because jesus said behold I send the promise of my father upon you that was the revealed Word by Sunim on that day but the written word from choil said I will pour my spirit in the last days so the reveal was from Jesus connect with the written word from Doyle so when Peter came out on the scene he said this is that that the Prophet Joel speaker he could take the manifestation and identified back in the Bible back in the scripture of what was written Oh hallelujah so what we are connecting to today is not a foreign thing let a strange thing you know we looking for power and we want power power and the power no no no what promise this thing oh and I believe it coming today I believe I'm expecting it this morning I'm expecting it to come upon you I'm expecting the you leave a like a Superman hallelujah supercharged praise God I expect your battery to be fully loaded for evil God amen hallelujah some of you people that was afraid some woman would laugh at you having along here or you quit man wake up some of you man afraid your organization will show you out when you baptized in the scripture baptism watch you need to close yourself in the upper room to Dynamis come it's changed them I want to stick stick on that they didn't remain the same it changed them when dynamics come you don't care what uncle say Tandy say mommy daddy brother sister it doesn't matter it's what God says it's not right I love this it changed them it quicken them it made them different they were a changed people from then on it quickened them from an old life of being a coward to like the lion of the tribe of Judah the dynamics was in the mechanics it quickened a mortal body they were so quicken the bravery of the landowner but Judah fell into them over the weaving of the sheaf isn't that right oh here this prophecy hallelujah there's gonna be more who's gonna give their lives blood for this world it was customer and his constant flood here we go the son has got to be revealed again in the bride in the last days the Cretan power has got to come to quicken them all these deadly nomination increase to a Living Word of the Living God so the son of man was revealed to a prophet but the son of God has to reveal again in a bride in the last days by the pitman power Eloise has got to be work with power hallelujah that is how the son would reveal again did leader it's quickened into a new life it does the same thing for us now they were so quickened in that quickness power unborn baby a mystery here the quickness power wasn't only in their soul it was all over them [Music] my my my that's why they take pitches off a pause body and people healed because the anointing was on Paul's body the quick temper was all over him they didn't say that prayin orders just lay hands on the sick just lay hands on the sick they shall lay hands on the sick though you have to pray just to lay hands on the sick because the hands are anointed the hands in the hands of God is an extension of God or Gloria people healed in Peters shadow whoa God did you get that beam up were healed in Peters shadow Oh hallelujah that's all filled with God they are they were sons of God expression God revealing God they were revealing the mystery of who they are and who God is it wasn't just a written mystery there became the mystery itself [Applause] hallelujah and you are going to be a mystery revealed unveiled on folded oh praise God could we give the Lord some praises you believe it this morning given it got that work through you he will go to work upon your life [Applause] he quickened the mechanics watch they were so quicken till their tongues begin to speak another language they were so quickened by the resurrection of Jesus Christ till their hands they were so quicken with a Krypton power till when they lay their hands upon the sick they got well it quicken your mortal body and they were healed by the lean on of hands and the spirit quickened the fellowship together with God till it was so quicken in the presence of God when a person died and their soul had gone off they call him back to life again I'm Branson know I'm feeling religious so Paul was preaching man fell off the banister fell long dead they pray they get him up risen from the dead and continue preaching the dead couldn't stay dead the citizen says sick the depressed couldn't say depress the doorknob couldn't say Domino because a quick temper is there that's what we needed we need a revival you must want it you must ask God for it you must pray for it you must clean it you must want it real bad you want a revival the boiler trashed out of your life out of your heart out of your spirit order your soul you want to be revived to God you want have a renewed and connection to God your father can hold you back your mother can hold you back why because a revived unto God [Applause] can't nobody Pompeii from the church nobody forces them to church you like David I was glad when they said unto me let us go into the house of God you yourself whenever the church becoming a cobbler come inspired you come to get an anointed glory now this word power squeak wood it is Dunamis is the word Dunamis is the word it comes from the root word dynamo or dynamic and I where dynamics come from this word called Dunamis is not right praise be to Jesus and that Dunamis refers to moral power and excellence of soul but more than just that it refer to that as miraculous power isn't that right on Dunamis also refers to it as inherent power power residing in the thing by virtue of its nature in ours resident power not temporary power but permanent power power to reproduce itself so once this wheel gets turnin once this wheel gets activated once that Dunamis the corn and turn on inside of you enough power the rapid so that's right Jesus oh my god this is so good devil had a rough time with Jesus because he couldn't handle him he got a written written it written it written written and a shock no miracles get shocked and Jesus stepped out I began to do miracles darica just stunnin repeatedly please and that's why they exclaimed what would is this man with word of authority and power that was Jesus but when he freshman disciples he knew that the power that he's about to release him to them into them would reproduce the same thing so before I even get deer to give them that after the resurrection he began to tell them the same looks I do shall you do also no data data then that was this a seed spoken to them he was speaking the promises into them if you shall see it as long as we move and no doubt in your heart you can have what you say so don't study that I alone could do this you could do this too because where you come from I come from - I come from we come from the same source it's not right we come over Elohim isn't that right so Jesus was was trying to anoint them to the sense of greatness to their sense of where they came from in a sense of the ability in God and so on they couldn't grasp it fully yet because they didn't have resurrection faith did not defeat all the promises the way it's supposed to be held so it took Christ to come back from the dead and appear moong them and still burn the scriptures still break the word of them no they feel is anointed no you could say bye-bye I'm gone no more crying crying is over I'm finished I'm going I'm going I'm going say it's bye-bye and they say bye-bye why didn't cry they had revelation oh why didn't cry that understanding know of what they were posed to receive he said teri in the city of Jerusalem until you receive power from on high they know this is a different one altogether now they noticed enough from the pasta or the preacher or the bishop or somebody else they fall for one high so they're easily upper room on the expectation worship and praising God continually because whenever you receive from God in Revelation you have to talk in faith that's why Abraham stagger nut but give glory to God his faith was praising God and was fully persuaded and he was praising and worshipping God continually for the promise say forgive your promise you thank God in advance you got grump and complain and keep silent no there's no silence because you receive it he said thanks from a healing thanks for my deliverance thank you Lord for my breakthrough if you claim it and receive it then you could give worship it then go to expect you to come with a sour face go to a trailer come like it and he has done nothing for your life you praise him anyhow you worship Melanie oh don't you spare me and I'll trust him [Applause] so there are certain scriptures that identify this word Dunamis the same one as power on the angel this Islam Luke 1:35 when the angel answered and said in her the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee therefore also the holy thing which shall be of thee shall be called the Son of God Luke for 36 days you want to read in the scriptures they were all amazed and speak among themselves saying what a would is this for with authority and power he commanded the unclean spirits and they come out the fusions 3:20 know unto him that is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we can ask or think according to the power that worketh in us unto Him be glory in the church of jesus christ throughout all ages amen second Timothy 1:7 God had not given us the spirit of fear but of power and of love and of a song main second be the one tree according as his divine power had given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that call us to glory and virtue so virtue power has to be given to do the works of Christ this divine power that comes true proper knowledge has to come into the church isn't that right mark 5:30 and Jesus immediately knowing in himself that virtue had gone out of him telling him about in the presence a who touched my clothes that would want a blood issue so when she pull and she withdraw he felt that virtue left him that has to return power has to be dear to be released God have to give that power isn't that right Luke 619 and the whole multitude sought to touch him for they went virtue out of him and heal them all so this ministry of Jesus Christ is not talking talking talking explaining explaining experience that's not the message Jesus Christ the best Jesus Christ has to be thought you throwing freely power flowing freely Luke 846 and Jesus said somebody had touched me for I perceive virtue is gone out of me he had it therefore he could give it Oh blessed be the name of the Lord praise God inherent power is not right and this is what the adoption is all about sons come in safe position of power now listen to this other one Luke 619 and the crowd sought to touch him for power and out of him and He healed them all praise the name of the Lord blessed be the name of Jesus praise be to God so the adopted son will have virtue flowing out of him isn't that right praise be to Jesus should have to have a start first I begin to add and to grow that's why I keep saying I'm brother George nor seen for years the ministers the people are yet to really go into wilderness to be tested of the devil they go I take the Duff to lead you dear you cannot in yourself going the wilderness so therefore your trials and what you call in trials right now forget about it that is so small in this whole thing and you complain you're palling and you're balling you're balling and what you call him buddy what trials you ready going through you come in the church freely bumps that fallen wrong you but get together creep if I die in some utila what not all can you have them around the world you shall come in and your but they hear the word freely and what not what try they're going through it coming people don't see me more than that they do want to come you want power but you don't want apostolate conditions but you want a Pacific Power if you're qualified Pacific Power you have to expect apostolate conditions why I think they will room with the door shut the door was no pillow and I believe hallelujah dying the glory in glory it wasn't even an outside you know the door was shut because they were afraid [Applause] just get crucified anymore oh the texting you know catch it when Peter when they asked Peter are you one of them they said no I'm not when Peters in cross and whippin Jesus getting blows and then you think people want to join Jesus you look like one a man I see what I see when I see why when I go into Edwin diamond are good so now I know what you should talk about the truth is honey granny p39 until Treat time but after I started curse he can be a believer he can be a believer in other could something like that hysterical is bitter but bitterly why because in his human self he doesn't have the strength there's not the power it's the end it is not there yet but when that power hit him he was the first man to slam the door open he's people on a joint as you supposed but this is that that the Prophet Joel he was the first man to step oh that's in Peter Oh glory to God that's what we're talking about you really can utter words of Prayer well you could say God help me whatever whatever when that holy will come upon your life you enjoy them was repelled told your mother for what the brief moment to call upon God you can't praise God because it should come from there he's a priest God's hope you can't stop because just come home always sit then oh yeah yeah praise God one never sent fire under your seat one time I'm on preaching I want to stand up course and finance it all I'm stand up praise God you know my garage about Oh God you fly straight to the altar never get pressure enough praise God my god the heat is coming on now you had a trial come to try every man on the earth it's not preacher get trials alone or this one get trial alone the everyman wanna be try every son that commander God must be tried o blessed be the name of the Lord isn't that right praise God so this adoption son ministry this Ephesian ministry would be Jesus walking on two feet oh praise be now what the program says the gift of God is what the Holy Spirit coming down in the form of an angel could you imagine that adoption seasoned angel working with the ministry angel working with the man Oh hallelujah you see butter on cop Dan said you know when I'm waiting on I'm with an the engine of the Lord and he's Waits and he's been over suddeniy said he is here angel make his appearance he's here i take every spirit under my control for the glory of god then people know after that is a different ball game altogether different ministry all together with that's coming back that is gonna be in the church Oh hallelujah we believe that oh praise God let's go further what a Branham says is the time might be closer than you think it's got me scared time shall be no more he's I haven't done enough where are we at time shall be no more he announces that time is over what is he referring to revelation 10 mighty angel come down isn't that the book and swear time shall be no more that's already done no time is over we and zero right now we are in overtime Oh hallelujah then is a seriously think what happens could that be so bedroom seriously think then the perimeters kept by the seven thunders now watch if time is over by manifestation the perilous gap because after the preeminence camp no more to be saved the book is closed last name in the book called no more needs to be added and the Breiner to be any earth bearing witness of Jesus Christ by resurrection power like Noah's Ark when the door was shocked and the people around couldn't come in that will be the bride's ministry the eternal lost while the ACA's open while the blood is on the throne people have an opportunity to respond like I'd never understand people grow up in a message or nineteen twenty and not baptized in Jesus name I do understand that under previous message and what I do you understand that where is the conviction to obey what God said in the world to repent and get baptized in Jesus name this sins that even taken away yet I said as I go I have a cassette or DVD or something light of your life and all he has to do it doesn't accuse you no just take back a life and play it back and put it in a movie of a screen a screen and you see Mac your whole life when you repent and you get baptized he taken any raise the whole thing give you a fresh start then you're under covenant of God under promise to receive the Holy Ghost repent and be baptized and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost that's your promise but people don't even answer the promise that's your promise that's what this offers we looking for next the Holy Ghost when they're coming Church and I come and look for this and I thought you coming for the Holy Ghost before wife or husband you should be asking about Holy Ghost he's a human women remember the payment message is the capstone the Holy Spirit cup of the individual and sealant when we added to fit righteousness and godliness and he kept add until we got seven things and the seventh one was love which is God that's how he makes the individual he caps him and sees him at the Holy Spirit then if that be so he's got seven churches and he had seven mysteries that we song away and they fought for to bring back now the headstone comes the cap of the church does the tunnelers mean that my bredrin and then he referred to junior Jackson dream with the pyramid and the crowbar and knocking off the chrome and so on and then he says no watch watch and watch he said this is all interpreted according to his dream is all finished according to God's Word the seventh messenger will finish the seventh message will be finished and then the seven thunders and he saw the capstone roll over so after the 70 inches message come seven thunders which many people don't even know they're seven seems to be reveal I've read many many books from Revelation never hear them talk about it he said no look he's the parent when I get to the capstone was not interpreted could it be that the mighty thunder or the seven angel in the seventh angel conservation that made a permanent a form tree on one side one on the top they drop out of eternity could it be here I want to get to is this the mystery of the tunnels that will bring back the headstone you know the prayer was never capped the headstone is yet to come it's been rejected could be brethren is this the mystery that would open up and bring a power to the church so he is saying a mystery is to open up to bring up power could it be what open up to bring a power to the church now listen this angel come from heaven all the messages finish the seven angel winds up the whole thing this angel comes not to the earth he isn't a man from the earth as the message of the church a Jesus finished this in shall bring the next announcement which is the mighty angel what was the announcement is the seven thunders twenty voices oh isn't that right this one didn't come from the earth he come from heaven because the mystery is all finished and when the mystery is finished angel said time shall be no more he said and then seven thunders to divorce result what if it is something that let us know how to end in disruption fate is it will be run on leap over walls is there something fixing to happen and these all mud vile bodies are going to be changed so friends if we're talking about the eruption that comes the Lord we have to look for that power that God promised they're going to transform our lies he's not right let's continue for marriage of the Lamb but a Branham so many say if the Lord will take his evil spirit from me from drinking from gambling from line and stealin our Sylvan that's up to you you've got something to do did I overcome challenge every all things did overcome you have power to do it but you must be willing to lay it down she had made herself ready isn't that right so therefore the Dove came down to lead Jesus is not right the anointing came upon him the Spirit came upon him but gone at the teen-oriented off of him to lead him into the wilderness to be tested to overcome by the word and his word was it is written it is written it is written we know it and he already had the power before he went in he went with power into the wilderness isn't that right he had power before he went in but he had to be tested isn't that right so Jesus when he returned from the wilderness he returned the power of the Spirit but he had to prove prove he could overcome by the world before he returned in the power of the Spirit he had to prove he can overcome by the wood it is written it is written it is written so don't look for spirit for you to overcome take the wood and overcome let me say it again don't look for spirit to
