[37:43] certainly when i appreciate but over for
[37:45] the message last weekend
[37:47] oh my and the bible study and the prayer
[37:50] meeting and
[37:51] all that god hasn't been unfalling in
[37:53] this new year
[37:54] so
[37:55] to keep us on time i want to go straight
[37:57] to the word this morning certainly want
[37:59] to welcome and greet all
[38:01] in the precious name of jesus christ
[38:04] and uh i want to take it from
[38:07] the book of genesis this morning
[38:09] for our scripture readings
[38:14] by the grace of god
[38:17] and we want to read in genesis 21
[38:21] reading from verse 5.
[38:23] genesis 21 verse 5
[38:27] and abraham was a hundred years old
[38:30] when his son isaac was born unto him
[38:34] and cyril said god had made me to laugh
[38:36] so that all i hear will laugh with me
[38:39] and she said who would have said unto
[38:41] abraham that sarah should have given
[38:44] children suck
[38:45] for i have borne him a son in his old
[38:47] age and the child grew and was weaned
[38:49] and abraham made a great feast the same
[38:51] day that
[38:52] isaac was weaned and sarah saw the son
[38:55] of higa the egyptian which she had borne
[38:58] unto abraham mocking
[39:00] wherefore she said unto abraham cast out
[39:02] this
[39:03] bondwomanhus and her son for the son of
[39:06] this one woman shall not be heir with my
[39:08] son even with isaac
[39:11] and the thing was very grievous to
[39:12] abraham's sight because
[39:14] of his son
[39:16] and god said unto abraham let it not be
[39:19] grievous in thy sight because of the lad
[39:22] and because of thy bond woman in all
[39:24] that sarah had said unto the hearken
[39:26] under her voice for in isaac shall thy
[39:29] seed be called
[39:31] and reading genesis 22 and verse 7
[39:34] and genesis 22
[39:36] is that chapter where god would tell
[39:38] abraham
[39:40] to take his son to be offered up
[39:43] so i just want to read from verse seven
[39:45] and
[39:46] isaac being a shy boy speaking to his
[39:49] father abraham and said my father you
[39:52] said here i am my son and he said behold
[39:54] the fire and the wood
[39:56] but where is the lamb
[39:58] for a burnt offering
[40:00] and abraham said my son god will provide
[40:02] himself a lamb for a burnt offering so
[40:05] they went both of them together
[40:07] and they came to the place which god had
[40:09] told him of and abraham built an altar
[40:11] there and laid the wood in order and
[40:12] bound isaac his son and laid him on the
[40:14] altar upon the wood
[40:16] and abraham stretched forth his hand and
[40:18] took the knife to slay his son and the
[40:20] angel of the lord called unto him out of
[40:22] heaven and said abraham abraham
[40:24] and he said here i am
[40:26] and he said lead not thine hand upon the
[40:28] lad neither do
[40:30] thou anything unto him for now i know
[40:33] that thou fearest god seeing thou hast
[40:35] not withheld thy son an only son from me
[40:38] and abraham lifted up his eyes and
[40:40] looked and behold behind him a ram
[40:42] caught in a thicket by his horns and
[40:44] abraham went and took the ram and
[40:46] offered him up for a burnt offering in
[40:48] the stead of his son
[40:50] and abraham called the name of that
[40:52] place jehovah jireh as it is said to
[40:55] this day in the mount of the lord it
[40:57] shall be seen may the lord of the
[40:59] blessing to the reading of his word you
[41:01] may be seated in the presence of the
[41:02] lord this morning
[41:04] it is such a great honor and privilege
[41:07] to be called in such a time as this
[41:11] and to know him brother branham said is
[41:12] to know him is life
[41:15] not just to know his name but to know
[41:17] him
[41:18] you could know the name of somebody and
[41:20] not know the person
[41:21] there are many names of people that i
[41:23] know i know the name elon musk but i
[41:25] don't know him personally
[41:27] anybody with me so we are here to know
[41:30] him because to know him is life to know
[41:32] the risen resurrected lord jesus christ
[41:35] his name his power his attributes his
[41:37] relationship his person and that's why
[41:39] we are here this morning to build on
[41:41] that so i have a title this morning the
[41:43] mystery of redemption through seven
[41:46] redemptive names the mystery of
[41:49] redemption through seven redemptive
[41:51] names and we know the prophet would have
[41:53] spoken this in different messages
[41:54] jehovah jireh and different messages so
[41:57] i just felt led to touch a few things
[41:58] here this morning
[42:00] to encourage a church so this is a
[42:02] faith-building message and don't intend
[42:05] to be too long with you but it's a
[42:07] message to encourage you in such a time
[42:09] as this and we know that god is
[42:11] mysterious and it's he's a mystery and
[42:14] because he is a mystery and because we
[42:16] are like him we are we are also a
[42:17] mystery and a mystery has to be unfolded
[42:20] so this mysterious god had to also be
[42:22] unfolded he is just too powerful for
[42:25] people that have captured him over the
[42:27] ages because he was just too mysterious
[42:30] he is was just too big he was just too
[42:32] powerful he was he is just too much that
[42:34] that it took a lot of time and process
[42:36] to try to capture the magnitude of this
[42:38] god and when man fell it really created
[42:42] the opportunity to unfold attributes of
[42:44] this mysterious god that he could not
[42:47] have revealed before man fell so for god
[42:49] to even unfold all that he was he could
[42:52] not have done it unless a mistake was
[42:54] made i want you to catch that this
[42:57] morning for god to express all that he
[42:59] was it took man falling for god to begin
[43:02] to express more of himself he would have
[43:05] had fellowship with adam in the cool of
[43:07] the evening but there's only so much of
[43:09] him he could have expressed to adam but
[43:11] there were parts of him that adam never
[43:13] had need to access because adam had not
[43:16] fallen but when man fell it opened a key
[43:20] to unlock attributes of god that were
[43:22] previously hidden
[43:26] of god that he could not display
[43:28] attributes he could not share he
[43:30] couldn't share compassion he couldn't
[43:32] share forgiveness he could not share
[43:34] mercy he couldn't pick adam up because
[43:37] adam didn't have need to access that
[43:40] part
[43:41] of god
[43:42] he could access the path of fellowship
[43:44] he could accept the path of leadership
[43:46] he could accept the path of kindness and
[43:48] instruction but only when man fell he
[43:51] had need for a savior he had need for a
[43:53] redeemer he had need to be born into a
[43:56] family
[43:57] anybody would be this morning
[44:01] and this was god's great desire
[44:05] to express himself
[44:07] he didn't like being a mystery
[44:10] it's a great mystery but he wants to be
[44:12] a mystery to certain people but to
[44:14] others not a mystery he's a mystery to
[44:17] the world but his sons and daughters he
[44:20] doesn't want to be a mystery he could be
[44:22] misunderstood by the world but to his
[44:25] sons and daughters he wants to be
[44:27] understood he remains unknown to the
[44:29] world but to his
[44:31] can i get some more volume back on the
[44:33] on the pulpit please
[44:35] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah an
[44:38] omnipotent omniscient all-powerful god
[44:41] god had to find a way to express this
[44:44] mystery
[44:45] to unfold himself and if you'd only know
[44:48] a part of god then i could guarantee you
[44:50] there's more of him to know do you know
[44:52] him in just one way or do you know him
[44:55] in the fullness of who he is do you know
[44:57] him in the fullness of his power the
[44:59] fullness of his love the fullness of his
[45:01] resurrection hallelujah he is not just
[45:04] here for salvation he is also here for
[45:06] healing he's here to restore your joy do
[45:09] you know him as a restorer do you know
[45:11] him helping your family do you know him
[45:14] picking up the pieces of your life do
[45:16] you know him as the potter do you know
[45:18] oh come on now somebody help me
[45:20] [Applause]
[45:22] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh
[45:25] blessed be the name of the lord i invite
[45:28] you this morning to get to know him a
[45:30] little better oh
[45:32] that's how you can love him better every
[45:34] day most people only know him in a
[45:36] little form of who he is but only in
[45:38] this day and this time we get to know
[45:41] him because in this age is when the
[45:42] mystery is now finished
[45:45] more mystery to that elect lady the
[45:48] mystery is finished of who he is his
[45:50] nature his being his attributes and
[45:53] because the mystery of who he is is now
[45:55] known the mystery of who you are is now
[45:58] known that you are not the son of so and
[46:01] so and so and so but your father is the
[46:03] king and that you are a reflection of
[46:06] who you are somewhere else
[46:08] somebody preached back to me you
[46:10] couldn't worship this morning if you
[46:12] don't have representation
[46:14] by predestination you could not receive
[46:17] this word this morning if you were not
[46:19] called
[46:21] predestinated so shake yourself this
[46:24] morning shake yourself this morning do
[46:27] you know who your father is do you know
[46:29] what he's able to do do you know what
[46:31] his power is
[46:33] [Music]
[46:34] [Applause]
[46:37] all the books in the world
[46:40] cannot fully describe him he is just too
[46:43] big
[46:44] he is just too powerful and he could do
[46:46] anything
[46:47] he is sovereign he doesn't want to
[46:49] remain a mystery this mystery is so
[46:52] great he doesn't want to be complicated
[46:55] he doesn't want to be misunderstood he
[46:57] didn't want you to have a degree to
[46:59] understand him he wanted anybody to be
[47:01] to talk to him talk about him talk with
[47:04] him is anybody this morning that's what
[47:07] we came to church for to get connected
[47:10] to him not the church but to be
[47:12] connected to him
[47:16] he may be seated
[47:18] [Music]
[47:23] adam
[47:25] as time progressed
[47:27] and adam went off the scene
[47:30] and each one could come and he would
[47:31] come god
[47:33] is unfolding his great plan of
[47:35] redemption
[47:36] a plan of redemption to restore man a
[47:38] plan of redemption to bring back man
[47:41] into a position of power
[47:43] redemption is not to bring you back to
[47:45] nothing is to bring you back to position
[47:46] of power and authority
[47:48] power and authority over yourself
[47:50] power and authority over the elements
[47:52] power and authority over situations
[47:55] power and authority over challenges
[47:57] things cannot move you the way they used
[47:59] to move you
[48:00] because now you have power and authority
[48:03] over your emotions
[48:04] over your memory over your reasoning
[48:06] over your conscience over your
[48:07] imagination you're not subject to up and
[48:10] down anymore because you are coming into
[48:12] your position redeem back into authority
[48:16] anybody with me this morning and this
[48:18] word we're preaching this morning is not
[48:20] an opinion
[48:21] it's not a recommendation it's not a
[48:23] suggestion this word is power this word
[48:26] is god himself as he speaks to you into
[48:29] your soul you may not understand
[48:31] everything but something in you connects
[48:33] that seed in you that he plays there is
[48:35] knowing that this is the truth
[48:38] i'm bigger than my problem
[48:40] just like god you are bigger than your
[48:42] situation just like god you are able to
[48:45] walk on the foot of the devil put your
[48:48] foot on his neck this morning
[48:51] do you really know him this morning
[48:54] [Applause]
[48:57] to redeem you
[48:58] to bring you back
[49:00] restore your jewelry saw your peace
[49:02] restore your victory
[49:03] restore your worship
[49:06] because you worship there now you could
[49:08] worship here
[49:09] because you were at victory there you
[49:11] could have victory here
[49:12] you are just here a reflection of who
[49:14] you are somewhere else and the devil is
[49:16] mad about it but i'm so glad
[49:19] oh hallelujah i love don't you love the
[49:21] lord
[49:23] that your name is written in the book
[49:25] and even when your words deceive you
[49:29] peter got a revelation peter's name was
[49:32] on the book but when jesus died peter's
[49:34] own words received him he said i don't
[49:36] know the man this is the only man who
[49:38] set out the christ so we knew that he
[49:40] knew
[49:43] but under the pressure
[49:46] we realized he didn't know him as much
[49:48] as he needed to know him there was more
[49:49] to know
[49:50] he knew who he was but he didn't know
[49:52] him so intimately to be able to stand
[49:55] the test and that peter said i don't
[49:56] know him i don't know him i wasn't there
[50:00] he denied him three times but god didn't
[50:02] even hold that against him because he
[50:04] was known before the foundation of the
[50:06] world and god could express mercy to him
[50:10] that's why he said god fine and go tell
[50:12] my disciples and the peter peter is the
[50:14] only one who called separately because
[50:16] you know peter found himself in a deep
[50:17] hole of depression
[50:20] peter didn't feel good when he denied
[50:21] him you know peter didn't feel good when
[50:23] he made a mistake but like any true lamb
[50:25] any true sheep when you fall you bleed
[50:28] you cry your boy your tears run down
[50:30] your face because you know that's not
[50:32] your state it's not your position and
[50:34] when jesus say call my disciples and
[50:36] tell peter to come also oh that was the
[50:38] encouragement that peter needs so i tell
[50:40] you this morning if you don't know him
[50:42] in the powers of his resurrection if you
[50:44] don't know him in the power of his mercy
[50:46] if you don't know him in the power of
[50:47] his grace may you come to know him this
[50:50] morning
[50:52] [Applause]
[50:54] so let's go
[50:56] so this mysterious god is unfolding
[50:58] himself
[50:59] in shadows
[51:00] in pieces
[51:02] as he is known to them people can
[51:04] express
[51:05] due to the limited understanding of the
[51:06] experience
[51:08] can the church say amen
[51:10] so the first encounter we have of of one
[51:13] of the compound names but ibrahim said
[51:15] is that name jehovah jaira
[51:18] it's the first of the seven compound
[51:20] redemptive names we find in scripture
[51:24] because god would go to abraham and we
[51:25] know god would call abraham and god will
[51:27] give imam promises and the reason i read
[51:30] genesis 21 is because in genesis 21 god
[51:35] told abraham that thy name
[51:38] thy seed
[51:40] thy power your generation all of this
[51:43] will be true
[51:45] your son isaac
[51:46] for in isaac shall thy seed be called
[51:49] but yet the very next chapter god
[51:51] telling him go and offer up this
[51:54] son
[51:57] that could confuse anybody
[52:00] because if you just told me through my
[52:01] son isaac
[52:03] my seed is gonna call and be called and
[52:06] come to that seed and the next time he
[52:07] said go kill him
[52:09] it takes a great fate it takes more
[52:11] faith in the face of what god said
[52:14] to now deal with a test in the face of
[52:16] what god said so abraham's faith had to
[52:19] be really great by the eclipse because
[52:21] god just told you this son through their
[52:23] son watch this boy he's not like anybody
[52:25] else through this boy your seed is going
[52:28] to come
[52:30] and yet still god is gonna say it offer
[52:32] him up to die
[52:33] can the church say amen
[52:35] and you know i said before god speaks on
[52:38] many different levels
[52:39] so he said true you see your name call
[52:41] and and offer up your son and and god is
[52:44] speaking to abraham but he's also
[52:45] speaking with the sun the royal seed of
[52:47] abraham who had to be anybody with me
[52:49] who would also be offered up
[52:51] [Applause]
[52:53] so check abraham with a positive fate in
[52:55] genesis 22.
[52:58] now the heat is turned up on abraham and
[53:00] he is now dealing with his own thoughts
[53:01] to this point for three days of the
[53:03] journey he is dealing with his thoughts
[53:06] because we all go through our periods
[53:07] where we're trying to reason and figure
[53:09] things out even god said come let's
[53:11] reason
[53:12] together but sometimes there's nobody to
[53:15] reason with but yourself and for three
[53:17] days god takes abraham on a journey for
[53:20] three days
[53:21] three days to give him the opportunity
[53:23] to turn back
[53:25] three days to really think is this what
[53:27] i want to do this maybe it's not what i
[53:29] signed up for
[53:31] but nothing is moving abraham
[53:33] he had waited 25 years
[53:36] god gave him a promise and i can imagine
[53:38] by the time abraham got there he said
[53:40] listen he's telling himself i guess
[53:42] imagine if god
[53:43] told me that this seed has to come to
[53:45] this boy even if i kill him god i have
[53:47] to raise his back up again i don't know
[53:48] how it's going to happen but god can't
[53:50] lie
[53:51] [Applause]
[53:52] i want to obey his word let god figure
[53:55] out the rest
[53:56] oh somebody help me because my god
[53:58] cannot lie if he said his seed is coming
[54:01] through this boy nothing will stop the
[54:04] seed coming to this boy so i may not be
[54:07] seeing all i should be seeing but i'm
[54:09] walking in faith
[54:11] and when i was reading that scripture
[54:14] last night i wrote down a new
[54:16] perspective
[54:17] because it takes a new perspective
[54:20] because if you don't have a new
[54:21] perspective on situations you could get
[54:23] bow down and depression and say but lord
[54:25] i waited 25 years you tell me this is
[54:28] the one this seed will come how you go
[54:29] tell me to kill him but that wasn't
[54:31] abraham
[54:33] and when his son said listen daddy
[54:36] i see the fire i see the wood
[54:39] where is the lamb for a burnt offering
[54:42] the young man is spiritual he know your
[54:45] car sacrificed nothing you are looking
[54:47] at everything else but illam and abraham
[54:49] in fate says my son god will provide
[54:53] himself a lamb
[54:55] for a burnt offering and when they came
[54:57] to the place abraham take his son and
[54:59] put him on the altar he tie him down on
[55:02] the altar and god is watching this
[55:04] and i'm trying to think even of god
[55:07] because this is a shadow of what to come
[55:10] god is watching abraham and abraham's
[55:12] son
[55:13] and not to just think about the
[55:15] magnitude of this because many years
[55:17] later what was already done in glory
[55:19] will be done on earth with god watching
[55:21] his own son tied to the cross
[55:24] so there's a lot of things happening
[55:25] there in parallel and goku said abraham
[55:28] abraham stop
[55:30] i know you love me
[55:31] i know you're willing to take the
[55:33] sacrifice to to to to be in order with
[55:36] me
[55:36] and when i was over
[55:38] and abraham saw that ram that should not
[55:41] have been there it wasn't raised there
[55:44] he said god has provided and abraham
[55:47] called that place
[55:49] listen god didn't call the police
[55:51] abraham when he saw that manifestation
[55:54] he had to find a way to describe this
[55:57] god
[55:58] [Music]
[56:00] he had to find his own way come on now
[56:02] somebody preach back to me you know this
[56:04] stuff but i want to do how do you
[56:06] describe your god
[56:08] so when abraham went to that experience
[56:10] the bible said he
[56:12] called
[56:14] the name of that place god didn't tell
[56:16] him to let this abraham by revelation
[56:20] looked at the situation looked at his
[56:22] journey taught about what he went
[56:24] through and he called that place jehovah
[56:27] jairo
[56:30] god is a provider not just a provider
[56:33] but he's a provider of the sacrifice
[56:36] oh hallelujah do you realize you didn't
[56:38] have to provide no sacrifice for your oh
[56:42] come on now god
[56:44] prepared for himself a sacrifice for you
[56:47] and i
[56:48] oh hallelujah he is till jehovah chirag
[56:52] he is still a provider
[56:54] listen not just a provider of a food and
[56:57] a table unknown but he has provided a
[57:00] sacrifice
[57:04] so it's more than provision
[57:06] and he is still jehovah's ira
[57:08] he is still a provider what do you have
[57:10] need of this morning do you know you get
[57:12] provided do you know he is is he your
[57:14] provider do you know him i said hover
[57:17] chiro this morning do you know him as
[57:19] your provider do you take it what you
[57:21] need to him until you make a way because
[57:24] abraham couldn't see no way he was
[57:26] trusting god and god placed around there
[57:29] that he could prove oh come on now
[57:31] somebody help me this morning
[57:34] do you know him
[57:36] as jehovah chyra
[57:39] and abraham
[57:40] if you would meet abraham he could
[57:42] testify by the terrance of god as a
[57:44] provider that was his experience that's
[57:47] why it's so important you have an
[57:48] experience what is god to you
[57:51] what has he done for you what has he
[57:53] done to you could you speak first person
[57:56] about who he is to you by virtue of your
[57:59] experience with him can you identify the
[58:02] moment in your life when god did
[58:04] something for you so you could say he is
[58:06] my you need to put the word my in front
[58:09] of it he is my provider oh hallelujah i
[58:12] could tell you when i couldn't pay any
[58:14] bills but he provided i can't explain it
[58:18] i don't understand it but i could just
[58:20] look and know that he is my provider i
[58:23] don't know about you but as for me he is
[58:25] my provider jehovah jireh and what was
[58:29] god doing he was unfolding a process of
[58:32] redemption
[58:38] that was present tense redemption to
[58:39] abraham
[58:42] hallelujah
[58:48] hallelujah
[58:50] and for years
[58:52] everybody could talk about you know he's
[58:54] a provider
[58:55] you know he's jehovah tyra
[58:58] it's only so much but a punch at that
[59:01] time they had ways or words to describe
[59:03] him
[59:05] because the descriptions of him would
[59:06] come over time we deliberately with the
[59:08] foundation here now so when he say who
[59:10] is god he's a provider
[59:12] who do you worship i pro i worship the
[59:14] provider we call him jehovah tyra are
[59:18] you a believer are you really what
[59:20] inspiration are you in i mean he's
[59:21] praise of jehovah tyra he's a provider
[59:24] that's what they had to work with they
[59:26] had no other way to describe him abraham
[59:28] was seeking a city who was building
[59:30] middles it was god and as far as he knew
[59:32] he was jehovah tyra
[59:35] but we know now that god is more than a
[59:38] provider
[59:39] that's just one aspect of his nature one
[59:41] aspect of his character one aspect of
[59:44] what he could do
[59:45] can the church say amen but as time
[59:48] progressed abraham and his seed would
[59:51] begin to move on and abraham and isaac
[59:54] and jacob and they would end up in egypt
[59:56] and they would come in and spend all
[59:58] that time in egypt all these years they
[1:00:01] could just call on the provider you know
[1:00:04] it was in exodus 15
[1:00:06] in verse 26.
[1:00:08] or sorry verse 23 this is when they come
[1:00:10] out now of egypt brother papua and when
[1:00:12] they came to mara they could not drink
[1:00:15] of the waters of mara for they were
[1:00:17] bitter therefore the name of it was
[1:00:19] called mara and the people murmured
[1:00:21] against moses saying what shall we drink
[1:00:24] and he cried unto the lord and the lord
[1:00:26] showed him a tree which when he cast
[1:00:28] into the waters the waters were made
[1:00:31] sweet there he made for them a statute
[1:00:34] and an ordinance and there he proved
[1:00:36] them and said if thou wilt diligently
[1:00:40] hacken to the voice of the lord thy god
[1:00:43] and will do that which is right in his
[1:00:45] sight and will give ear to his
[1:00:47] commandment and keep all his statutes up
[1:00:50] i will put none of these diseases upon
[1:00:52] thee which i have brought upon the
[1:00:54] egyptians for i am the lord that healed
[1:00:57] thee oh at that point they were not just
[1:01:00] calling him jehovah jireh i am the lord
[1:01:03] that healeth thee is jehovah rapha he
[1:01:06] was more than jesus chiro
[1:01:09] and at that point anybody who was a
[1:01:12] believer brother ekith could say he is
[1:01:14] jehovah jairo and he is jehovah rapha he
[1:01:17] is providing for me and he is healing
[1:01:20] for me do you know him as your healer do
[1:01:22] you have faith that he can provide for
[1:01:25] you do you have faith that he could heal
[1:01:28] you and that was as much as they knew
[1:01:30] they could walk with faith and
[1:01:32] confidence he is jehovah jireh he is my
[1:01:34] provider he is your over rapha is the
[1:01:37] god that heal it have you been healed do
[1:01:40] you need healing do you know him as
[1:01:43] jehovah rapha i know brother so-and-so
[1:01:46] knows him i know sister someone so knows
[1:01:48] him but do you know him
[1:01:50] [Applause]
[1:01:54] the lord our healer
[1:01:56] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah anybody
[1:02:00] with me this morning
[1:02:02] oh jehovah jireh is not enough to call
[1:02:04] him he is more than jesus i'm trying to
[1:02:08] find ways to describe this god i'm
[1:02:10] trying to find ways i then do you know
[1:02:12] him this morning people no church but
[1:02:14] they don't know him
[1:02:20] they call him jehovah
[1:02:22] rapha
[1:02:24] and then as time progresses
[1:02:26] exodus 17
[1:02:29] we find out that and and god was so
[1:02:31] upset
[1:02:32] he said i remember when amalek came
[1:02:34] against you the children of israel were
[1:02:37] not an army they were slaves in egypt
[1:02:40] they had no weapons of war and when they
[1:02:42] were in their weakest moment amalek
[1:02:45] pounced upon them and in exodus 17 verse
[1:02:48] 8 then came amalek and fought with
[1:02:51] israel in referendum and moses said unto
[1:02:54] joshua choose out men and go out fight
[1:02:57] with amalek tomorrow i will stand on top
[1:03:00] of the hill with the rod of god in my
[1:03:02] hand so just what did as moses had said
[1:03:05] to him and fought with amalek and moses
[1:03:08] iran and who went up on the top of the
[1:03:11] hill and it came to pass when moses held
[1:03:14] up his hand
[1:03:16] that israel revealed
[1:03:18] and when he let down his hand
[1:03:20] amalek revealed
[1:03:23] where's your hand this morning
[1:03:26] where where's where's where's your
[1:03:27] banner this morning
[1:03:29] whose side are you on this morning
[1:03:31] but moses hands were heavy
[1:03:34] and they took a stone
[1:03:36] like that
[1:03:37] and put it under him in other words do
[1:03:39] what you have to do to keep your praises
[1:03:41] up do whatever you have to do to keep
[1:03:43] your worship up
[1:03:45] they put a stone they say listen once
[1:03:47] his hand is up we recognize you winning
[1:03:49] the battle if his hand fall we losing
[1:03:51] the battle bring a stone and they put it
[1:03:53] under him and he sat there on and aaron
[1:03:56] and her stayed up his hands so aaron and
[1:03:58] her hole in moses hand
[1:04:00] oh is there anybody this morning
[1:04:04] you need somebody to help you hold your
[1:04:05] hand up but i want to tell you don't
[1:04:07] give up because the battle is the lord's
[1:04:09] and if we lift him up he is fighting our
[1:04:12] battles
[1:04:14] and aaron and her steering up his hands
[1:04:16] i want you to understand where these
[1:04:18] redemptive names came from right the one
[1:04:20] on one side and the other on the other
[1:04:22] side and his hands were steady
[1:04:25] you see why you can't fight this battle
[1:04:26] alone you see why your family is
[1:04:28] important i'm not talking about your
[1:04:30] natural blood family you know i'm
[1:04:31] talking about this blood family you need
[1:04:33] your brothers and your sisters because
[1:04:35] sometimes they get tired and somebody
[1:04:37] got to help you hold your hand up once
[1:04:39] he got the help he needed the bible says
[1:04:41] and his hands were steady
[1:04:43] until the going down of the sun and
[1:04:46] joshua discomforted amalek you know what
[1:04:49] discomfort mean he messed them up he
[1:04:52] made him uncomfortable he put them out
[1:04:54] the place he sent them back where they
[1:04:56] come from he said you picked the wrong
[1:04:58] day you underestimated this army we're
[1:05:00] looking like farmers but don't end the
[1:05:03] underestimated look because you see the
[1:05:05] hand that's lifted up you see that
[1:05:07] banner that's raised declaring we serve
[1:05:09] a living resurrected god the planet has
[1:05:12] raised up this flag flying that we are
[1:05:15] children of the most high
[1:05:17] [Applause]
[1:05:19] and joshua discomforted amalek and his
[1:05:21] people with the edge of the sword and
[1:05:23] the lord said unto moses
[1:05:26] write this for a memorial
[1:05:28] this was so important god said write it
[1:05:30] for a memorial in a book and rehearse it
[1:05:33] in the ears of joshua
[1:05:36] [Applause]
[1:05:38] in other words make sure joshua knows
[1:05:40] this
[1:05:42] make sure you and joshua practice this
[1:05:44] thing i want joshua because i have a
[1:05:46] word for joshua
[1:05:49] so rehearse it with him
[1:05:51] for i will utterly put out the
[1:05:53] remembrance of amalek from under heaven
[1:05:56] god said for this thing i will wipe them
[1:05:59] out
[1:06:01] wipe them out
[1:06:03] they have no right to pick a fight
[1:06:05] against my children when i was bringing
[1:06:07] them out of bondage they did not deliver
[1:06:09] themselves i brought them out and the
[1:06:11] devil was wrong with him try to attack
[1:06:13] you on your way out
[1:06:15] i will wipe out that devil that trying
[1:06:18] to stop you from getting to your
[1:06:19] inheritance
[1:06:22] rehearse it with joshua rehearse it with
[1:06:24] him remind him of this day and what his
[1:06:27] day means for us
[1:06:28] and listen
[1:06:30] and moses
[1:06:31] built an altar and called the name of it
[1:06:35] jehovah nisi so god didn't tell him to
[1:06:37] call it this when oh hallel
[1:06:41] when moses went through that his own
[1:06:43] personal experience
[1:06:46] his personal journey he can look at it
[1:06:49] and say god is jehovah nisi the lord is
[1:06:52] our panna the lord is our refuge the
[1:06:55] lord is our hiding place and if we lift
[1:06:58] this banner above us this morning oh no
[1:07:01] demon no weapon no power no principality
[1:07:04] can come against you can the church give
[1:07:07] the lord a shout of praise
[1:07:09] [Music]
[1:07:14] i told this is a field building message
[1:07:16] you know to remind you of what you know
[1:07:18] already but if you don't know him as
[1:07:20] jehovah jireh you need to know him if
[1:07:22] you don't know him as jehovah rapha you
[1:07:24] need to know him if you don't know him
[1:07:26] as jehovah nisi as your banner you need
[1:07:28] to know him
[1:07:30] because he needs to be this and more to
[1:07:32] you
[1:07:34] not to the church to you
[1:07:38] he is my banner
[1:07:40] he is my refuge so up until this time
[1:07:44] a believer better pop well could begin
[1:07:47] to describe god in more ways than
[1:07:49] abraham could
[1:07:54] all abraham could refer to him as a
[1:07:56] jehovah torah but now
[1:07:59] somebody who is under the inspiration as
[1:08:01] it were could say he's jehovah rapha
[1:08:04] he's jehovah jireh he's your over nissi
[1:08:07] can the church say amen
[1:08:09] and god is unfolding this plan of
[1:08:11] redemption what is he doing revealing
[1:08:13] attributes of himself to them by
[1:08:16] experience so that they could testify
[1:08:19] it's not a letter it's not a document
[1:08:21] it's not just a word thing this thing is
[1:08:23] real we remember when this happened and
[1:08:26] god did this and because he did that he
[1:08:28] is this
[1:08:30] [Music]
[1:08:32] [Applause]
[1:08:33] [Music]
[1:08:38] so the children of israel now out
[1:08:40] they're now living by a revelation of
[1:08:42] these three compound names their
[1:08:45] understanding of god is now better than
[1:08:47] it was before god's objective is being
[1:08:50] met of revealing himself hallelujah by
[1:08:53] experience he is revealing himself he
[1:08:56] know him better every day god is
[1:08:58] unfolding a better revelation is
[1:08:59] unfolding he's unfolding
[1:09:03] between that time time passes
[1:09:05] and now god is under the age of the
[1:09:06] judges
[1:09:10] hallelujah and we actually did a bible
[1:09:12] study on this
[1:09:14] when we looked at
[1:09:15] what was happening in george's chapter
[1:09:17] six and the children of israel did evil
[1:09:20] in the sight of the lord and the lord
[1:09:22] delivered them to the hand of media for
[1:09:24] seven years
[1:09:26] and the hand of media prevailed against
[1:09:27] israel
[1:09:28] and because of the medianites the
[1:09:30] children of israel made them dens in the
[1:09:32] mountains to hide
[1:09:35] he was over gyro to them
[1:09:37] he was over our fathered him he was over
[1:09:39] nishi to them but they now had a
[1:09:41] different problem
[1:09:42] that requires something else
[1:09:44] hallelujah
[1:09:45] [Applause]
[1:09:50] verse 7 i'm going to escape when i came
[1:09:51] to pass when the children of israel
[1:09:52] cried unto the lord because of the media
[1:09:55] knights
[1:09:56] you see there's a formula here just like
[1:09:57] the children of israel in egypt when
[1:09:59] they cried unto the lord he remembered
[1:10:01] when they cried unto the lord they heard
[1:10:03] his breath you wouldn't come to church
[1:10:05] and there was a crying to the lord
[1:10:07] [Applause]
[1:10:09] so there was a conditionality tied to
[1:10:12] what was happening next when they cried
[1:10:14] unto the lord
[1:10:15] that the lord sent a prophet
[1:10:18] you see how god does it
[1:10:19] when you cry he sends what
[1:10:21] a prophet
[1:10:24] one man singular
[1:10:26] not a group he says one man
[1:10:30] [Music]
[1:10:32] don't we thank god that he sent a
[1:10:33] prophet
[1:10:34] because there was a cry a sign and a
[1:10:36] crying for the abomination in the city
[1:10:42] set a prophet unto unto the children of
[1:10:44] israel which said unto them thus saith
[1:10:45] the lord god of israel i brought you out
[1:10:49] from egypt
[1:10:51] and that's what we're doing here when
[1:10:52] these prophets came they brought back
[1:10:54] the history
[1:10:55] to show them the journey god took you
[1:10:57] through to anchor their feet on what was
[1:10:59] done already
[1:11:01] that's why it's so important you not
[1:11:02] forget where you come from because even
[1:11:04] though you dip and have your struggles
[1:11:06] you can look back to when you were just
[1:11:08] all there in the world and you had no
[1:11:10] anchor no hope even if you backslide you
[1:11:12] still know you have a hope because
[1:11:14] before you met god he didn't know you
[1:11:16] had a hope
[1:11:17] [Applause]
[1:11:20] thus here the lord god of israel i
[1:11:22] brought you up from egypt and brought
[1:11:24] you forth out of the house of bondage i
[1:11:27] delivered you out of the hand of the
[1:11:29] egyptians and out of the hand of all
[1:11:31] that oppressed you and drave them out
[1:11:33] from before you and gave you their land
[1:11:36] and i said unto you i am the law listen
[1:11:38] no part of that has to do with you
[1:11:42] none of that is you he said i i i and he
[1:11:45] could say he said i am the lord your god
[1:11:48] fear not the gods of the amorites in
[1:11:50] whose lands you dwell
[1:11:54] but you have not obeyed my voice
[1:11:56] so you say don't fear you just have to
[1:11:58] make things right
[1:12:00] don't fear the gods out there don't fear
[1:12:02] these situations out there don't fear
[1:12:04] the challenges and your passions out
[1:12:06] there but you also have something to do
[1:12:07] you have not obeyed my voice if you come
[1:12:09] back into obedience if you come back
[1:12:11] home if you come back into the presence
[1:12:13] of god
[1:12:14] [Applause]
[1:12:18] and we'll skip down
[1:12:19] and we know this event god would send an
[1:12:22] angel to visit gideon
[1:12:25] and i will skip but when kirian
[1:12:27] perceived
[1:12:28] that who was talking with him was an
[1:12:30] angel this is judges 6 22 and when
[1:12:34] gideon perceived that he was an angel of
[1:12:35] the lord gideon said alas o lord god
[1:12:39] for because i have seen an angel of the
[1:12:40] lord face to face meaning it was
[1:12:42] understood if you see an angel you die
[1:12:44] that was the conception at the time
[1:12:47] and the lord said unto him peace be unto
[1:12:50] thee
[1:12:51] fear not
[1:12:52] thou shalt not die
[1:12:54] then gideon
[1:12:56] built an altar there
[1:12:58] unto the lord
[1:12:59] and he called it jehovah shalom unto
[1:13:03] this day
[1:13:05] unto this day it is yet an offer of the
[1:13:09] abuser right so until this day the
[1:13:11] jehovah's shalom
[1:13:13] gideon
[1:13:16] that name came from gideon jehovah
[1:13:18] shalom the lord is our peace
[1:13:21] because they were there but they needed
[1:13:23] peace
[1:13:24] god didn't call it him this is when
[1:13:26] gideon went through that experience he
[1:13:28] said this is more than jehovah
[1:13:31] this is more than jehovah wrapper this
[1:13:34] is more than jehovah and messi because i
[1:13:36] know about all these things i heard it
[1:13:37] from says abraham but what did you
[1:13:39] experience in the presence of an angel
[1:13:42] this is something different
[1:13:43] i never felt this way before i never
[1:13:46] experienced this before i need to find a
[1:13:48] way to describe what this is
[1:13:52] and he built an altar
[1:13:54] [Applause]
[1:13:56] and he called it
[1:13:58] jehovah shalom
[1:14:00] the lord is our peace
[1:14:03] because god came to gideon
[1:14:05] when he needed peace
[1:14:07] he came to gideon when he was troubled
[1:14:10] in his heart asking if god before us
[1:14:12] where are all the miracles
[1:14:14] asking if where is the lord god who took
[1:14:17] us out of egypt
[1:14:18] [Applause]
[1:14:23] but when he met an angel he knew it out
[1:14:26] of a shadow of a doubt that he was still
[1:14:28] the god of peace
[1:14:30] hallelujah anybody with me this morning
[1:14:33] i'm not going to be too long with you
[1:14:34] i'm almost done
[1:14:36] and gideon gave him that name
[1:14:38] and god accepted it
[1:14:40] so anybody who was around gideon
[1:14:43] could now identify his jehovah tyra
[1:14:46] he is jehovah rapha he is your hope oh
[1:14:49] come on now he's your overnisi he is
[1:14:51] your over shalom
[1:14:53] [Applause]
[1:14:56] and they would they would be able to
[1:14:58] live and feed and eat on that
[1:15:00] for many years
[1:15:02] until there was a man on the earth
[1:15:04] who god could see a man after my own
[1:15:06] heart
[1:15:08] and this man he knew he was a provider
[1:15:10] because whenever he was at a situation
[1:15:12] that needed provided god had provided
[1:15:15] when he needed healing
[1:15:16] he had it he needed peace he said many
[1:15:19] are they increase around me that
[1:15:20] troubled me many i didn't say of my soul
[1:15:22] he could have identified with all these
[1:15:24] things
[1:15:24] but when he had his own experience with
[1:15:26] god he said he is more than jehovah tyra
[1:15:29] he is more than jehovah rapha he is more
[1:15:32] than jehovah messi he is more than the
[1:15:34] over shalom the lord is my shepherd
[1:15:39] he is jehovah
[1:15:41] he is my shepherd i shall not want i
[1:15:45] shall not want he making me to lie down
[1:15:47] in green pastures he leaded me beside us
[1:15:50] till waters up he restored my soul he
[1:15:54] lead me in the path of righteousness for
[1:15:56] his name's sake yeah do i walk to the
[1:15:59] valley of the shadow of death i will
[1:16:01] fear no evil for what with me this
[1:16:05] shepherd who has a rod and i stop they
[1:16:08] comfort me that's what the shepherd does
[1:16:12] [Applause]
[1:16:12] [Music]
[1:16:15] hallelujah
[1:16:17] do you know him as your shepherd do you
[1:16:20] know him as your pastor because that's
[1:16:22] what a shepherd is he is a great pastor
[1:16:24] he is the great shepherd he is the
[1:16:26] protector of the sheep he is watching
[1:16:29] over his sheep this morning it doesn't
[1:16:31] matter where they are this morning
[1:16:33] [Applause]
[1:16:35] [Music]
[1:16:38] [Applause]
[1:16:41] dog prepares a table before me
[1:16:43] in the presence of my enemies

[1:16:49] surely goodness and mercy shall follow
[1:16:52] me all the days of my life and i will
[1:16:54] dwell in the house of the lord forever
[1:17:00] but as powerful as that was in the life
[1:17:02] of david and those who went before
[1:17:06] jehovah jaira
[1:17:07] jehovah rapha jehovah nisi
[1:17:10] jehovah shalom
[1:17:12] jehovah jehovah
[1:17:16] there was still more of god that he
[1:17:18] wanted to unveil
[1:17:20] and god does a true experience he does
[1:17:22] the jewish word he does the jewish
[1:17:23] promises
[1:17:26] we made the great prophet jeremiah
[1:17:29] in jeremiah 23
[1:17:32] he's now beginning to speak now because
[1:17:33] bear in mind now all of these compound
[1:17:36] seven redemptive names is what will be
[1:17:38] wrapped up in jesus
[1:17:41] this is all the god putting the pieces
[1:17:43] in place because there's nothing new
[1:17:45] under the sun so god is just putting a
[1:17:47] piece here and a piece here so when he's
[1:17:49] ready to combine the pieces it's already
[1:17:51] in place
[1:17:52] everybody with me this morning
[1:17:55] jeremiah will say behold the days come
[1:17:57] see the lord that i will raise unto
[1:18:00] david a righteous branch
[1:18:06] a righteous branch
[1:18:08] this branch is righteous
[1:18:10] who grow from this
[1:18:12] branch
[1:18:14] will be righteous
[1:18:16] and a king shall reign and prosper and
[1:18:18] shall execute judgment and justice in
[1:18:20] the earth
[1:18:21] in his days
[1:18:23] judah shall be saved
[1:18:25] and israel shall dwell safely
[1:18:28] and this is his name whereby he shall be
[1:18:30] called
[1:18:32] so this one
[1:18:33] god is revealing this one
[1:18:35] the lord our righteousness
[1:18:38] jehovah said canoe
[1:18:40] hallelujah and under jeremiah they now
[1:18:44] understood
[1:18:45] that the lord
[1:18:46] is our righteousness
[1:18:48] because of his righteousness we could
[1:18:51] get oh come on now you don't hear me
[1:18:53] because we're born and sin because
[1:18:55] of his righteousness because he is holy
[1:18:58] he is righteous he is purity he cannot
[1:19:01] sin but his righteousness could make a
[1:19:03] way for you this morning his
[1:19:05] righteousness could clear a path
[1:19:08] [Music]
[1:19:08] [Applause]
[1:19:15] so from that time on
[1:19:18] anybody who was trying to understand
[1:19:19] this thing but a papa
[1:19:29] and they all knew this was pieces
[1:19:31] this is gordon
[1:19:34] in different ways expressing himself in
[1:19:36] different ways
[1:19:39] and the last one you find in ezekiel
[1:19:42] and in ezekiel 14 is where they talk
[1:19:44] about dividing up all the land and who
[1:19:46] supposed to get what land and which
[1:19:47] tribe getting one piece of property and
[1:19:48] all that kind of stuff but by the time
[1:19:50] you read the end of ezekiel 40 35
[1:19:53] and it was roundabout talking about the
[1:19:55] whole land the whole protected area
[1:19:58] it was around about 18 000 measures
[1:20:01] and the name
[1:20:02] of that of the city from that day shall
[1:20:05] be the lord is there
[1:20:08] so that's the name of the lord is there
[1:20:09] jehovah
[1:20:11] the lord is prayer
[1:20:13] the lord is present he's a present help
[1:20:16] in time of trouble oh hallelujah
[1:20:18] hallelujah do you know him as jehovah
[1:20:21] sharma
[1:20:23] oh hallelujah i'm almost finished
[1:20:27] anybody feeling good this morning
[1:20:30] [Applause]
[1:20:34] and we know it and but if adam taught
[1:20:35] this clearly that these seven compound
[1:20:38] redemptive names
[1:20:39] was all expressed
[1:20:41] through the lord jesus christ because he
[1:20:44] was the mystery that was being unfolded
[1:20:46] all along revealed
[1:20:48] so if you only know him in one attribute
[1:20:51] or one fold or one perspective then to
[1:20:54] know him you need to know him and all of
[1:20:56] these things you know
[1:20:58] you need to either testify yourself he
[1:20:59] is your jairo to me he is your referred
[1:21:02] to me because i said how could they have
[1:21:04] faith would you rapture if you could
[1:21:05] have not fit for divine healing so you
[1:21:07] have to know him as a healer
[1:21:09] when in the middle of your trouble you
[1:21:10] have to know him as jehovah jairo being
[1:21:12] present hallelujah when you feel you
[1:21:14] can't enter into the house of god you
[1:21:15] have to remember jehovah
[1:21:18] you know he is your righteousness
[1:21:19] because of his righteousness he can make
[1:21:21] a way to access
[1:21:22] excessive presence here this morning
[1:21:26] hallelujah
[1:21:29] so this is really who he is and you know
[1:21:31] what as brother branham said these names
[1:21:34] we call it seven compound redemptive
[1:21:36] names but he said these are already
[1:21:37] titles
[1:21:39] because his name is the lord jesus
[1:21:40] christ he said these titles are just
[1:21:43] unique titles that could be added to his
[1:21:46] el shaddai
[1:21:47] he's a lily of diwali
[1:21:49] he's a bright and morning star
[1:21:51] hallelujah and many of you may notice i
[1:21:53] read this years ago an old preacher many

[1:28:28] if i could just touch the hem of his
[1:28:30] garment
[1:28:32] if i could just touch him this morning
[1:28:37] all that was done judy ages now wrapped
[1:28:40] up
[1:28:40] in christ a redeemer
[1:28:43] a kinsman redeemer
[1:28:45] spirit god who couldn't die took under
[1:28:47] former flesh
[1:28:49] to unlock to us
[1:28:51] our redemptive rights and show us our
[1:28:53] way back to eden back to fellowship
[1:28:57] back to communion
[1:28:59] seven compound redemptive names seven
[1:29:02] perfect spirits of god seven
[1:29:04] manifestations of one holy spirit
[1:29:08] that great white light
[1:29:11] that's who he is
[1:29:13] do you know him today
[1:29:15] [Music]
[1:29:16] do you want to meet him today
[1:29:19] in a message fate is a substance our
[1:29:21] bodies are grown in and we have an
[1:29:23] inheritance
[1:29:24] it is only true the redeemer we can get
[1:29:26] access to the inheritance and we are
[1:29:28] children now heirs of the kingdom
[1:29:30] [Music]
[1:29:32] you say brother branham i don't feel
[1:29:34] like praising him
[1:29:36] he said that's the time to make the
[1:29:38] sacrifice
[1:29:40] praising him anyhow
[1:29:42] while we're groaning
[1:29:44] veiled in this tabernacle of humiliation
[1:29:48] we have the earnest
[1:29:49] of our perfect complete redemption back
[1:29:52] like we was in the beginning when god
[1:29:54] created adam in the garden of eden we
[1:29:57] have a foretaste of glory divine by the
[1:30:00] baptism of the holy ghost the
[1:30:02] refreshment coming from the presence of
[1:30:04] god to water the church to make it grow
[1:30:07] in grace and when we are sick
[1:30:10] we have redemption
[1:30:12] jehovah
[1:30:14] the blessing the attributes of the death
[1:30:16] of christ
[1:30:18] divine healing
[1:30:19] as a force sign to us
[1:30:22] that someday
[1:30:23] this mortal will take on immortality
[1:30:27] so all of these seven compound
[1:30:28] redemptive names was was a foretaste
[1:30:32] of what was locked up in jesus now made
[1:30:34] accessible to us that we could not walk
[1:30:36] in the power of jehovah gyra on the
[1:30:38] inside jehovah rapha on the inside
[1:30:41] jehovah sharma on the inside god is
[1:30:44] present not just in this building but
[1:30:46] he's in my heart
[1:30:49] if you're looking for jehovah jireh he's
[1:30:51] in my heart
[1:30:52] if you're looking for jehovah's summer
[1:30:53] he's in my heart
[1:30:55] oh hallelujah
[1:30:57] can you say the same thing do you want
[1:30:59] to say the same thing
[1:31:04] i'm closing
[1:31:06] i don't want to read from this prayer
[1:31:07] that brother branham's
[1:31:09] prayed and why it had to be a shepherd
[1:31:12] lord god great creator
[1:31:14] who was so willing to come to it
[1:31:17] in the form of jesus to let man know
[1:31:19] what god was
[1:31:21] [Music]
[1:31:22] and you were the only one who could take
[1:31:24] the penalty of death
[1:31:26] no angel no substitute could do it you
[1:31:28] was the one who placed the penalty and
[1:31:30] you alone could justly take it away
[1:31:34] and being spirit you could not die but
[1:31:37] you were made flesh so you could die and
[1:31:40] become a lamb that you might take away
[1:31:41] the sin of your redeemed
[1:31:44] that you had to redeem them by your own
[1:31:46] blood
[1:31:48] oh the story is so great lord it goes
[1:31:51] over the head of so many to think little
[1:31:54] jehovah
[1:31:55] laying in a manger
[1:31:57] he had to live like a baby little
[1:31:59] jehovah born in a stable little jehovah
[1:32:02] playing with children on the street
[1:32:03] little jehovah the teenager little
[1:32:05] jehovah the school boy and jehovah the
[1:32:07] mighty you took all these places and
[1:32:10] then she over the lamb jew over the
[1:32:12] prophet and you became all of this that
[1:32:14] you might suffer the penalty of sin and
[1:32:17] to give us
[1:32:18] eternal life
