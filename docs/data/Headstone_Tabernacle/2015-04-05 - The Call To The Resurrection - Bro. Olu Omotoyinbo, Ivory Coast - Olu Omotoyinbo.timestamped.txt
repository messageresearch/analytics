[17:26] and Master and this is morning it's
[17:30] ister again it's is again there's a
[17:34] resurrection in your soul and you are
[17:37] here in a call to the
[17:41] resurrection make no mistake about that
[17:44] you are going in the
[17:46] resurrection
[17:48] hallelujah hallelujah there no devils
[17:52] not enough problems not enough habits
[17:55] not enough problems at home school at
[17:58] work you are
[18:00] predestinated to go in the
[18:04] resurrection there is going to be a
[18:08] resurrection I know in this Modern
[18:11] Age in the 21st century I know it sounds
[18:15] like a fairy tale I know it sounds like
[18:18] a fable but God's word can never fail
[18:23] there is going to be a
[18:24] resurrection and you want to fasten your
[18:27] eyes
[18:29] you want to fasten your
[18:30] focus that's why you are
[18:33] here you come here for this one purpose
[18:37] to receive this call to the
[18:40] resurrection that's your purpose of
[18:42] coming
[18:43] here if you miss that purpose your
[18:47] living has been in vain Hallelujah there
[18:51] is going to be a resurrection and
[18:54] brother cont told you last night
[18:56] potentially Mal said we are in the
[19:00] Rapture
[19:01] already is a fair to
[19:04] some brother I believe it and I know you
[19:08] do too amen so there is a call to the
[19:13] resurrection you may be
[19:15] seated glory to God
[19:20] amen
[19:22] amen amen am God has always called man
[19:28] there no man searching for God there no
[19:30] man calling out for God it's God that's
[19:33] his nature that's his being that's the
[19:36] essence of his he's a Rec
[19:57] reconciliatory
[20:00] profile God doesn't cast anyone
[20:03] out God never cast anyone
[20:06] out you get casted out because you will
[20:09] not go God's
[20:11] way and Jesus said the son is come not
[20:16] to condemn anyone he said the son is
[20:19] come through him believing in him the
[20:23] world might be saved so I didn't come
[20:25] for condemnation I come to give life
[20:29] but he said hearing is the
[20:31] condemnation if you going to be
[20:33] condemned here is how the condemnation
[20:35] comes it because light has come into the
[20:38] world and Men turn down
[20:41] light and chose Darkness
[20:44] instead so they condemn themselves but
[20:47] it's not God's job to condemn
[20:51] anybody so God he always calls he's a
[20:55] reconciliatory
[20:57] spirit
[20:59] reconciled that's why it is spoken
[21:02] blessed are the
[21:04] peacemakers for they shall be called the
[21:07] children of God God Spirit reconciled
[21:11] God spirit in cast I am I am so and who
[21:15] are you get away from me God Spirit
[21:17] doesn't do
[21:24] that and that's why at this end of time
[21:27] here
[21:29] in the seventh
[21:30] age out of
[21:33] Leia we have been called out for the
[21:36] spirit of God in is a spirit of
[21:39] Brotherly
[21:40] kindness and that spirit is supposed to
[21:44] so possess
[21:46] us brother
[21:48] kindness you can bear with a man when
[21:51] even when he's in the
[21:54] wrong you don't catch him out
[21:58] you are patient with him you got virtue
[22:01] within
[22:02] yourself to know that what he believes
[22:05] even though false
[22:07] doctr it's in his
[22:09] heart and you have virtue within
[22:11] yourself so let it go out with
[22:14] kindness that's the spirit of God and
[22:18] that's why there is a call to the
[22:20] resurrection God has always
[22:23] called in the Garden of Eden when Adam
[22:26] and Eve fell God knew what they
[22:30] did they disobeyed his
[22:33] instructions they brought all This
[22:35] calamity upon

[24:55] resurrection is a call from God
[24:58] amen amen amen amen I be s a minute let
[25:02] me
[25:03] read this kind of scripture here uh John
[25:18] 11 John
[25:21] 11 this was the raising up of Lazarus
[25:23] from the
[25:26] grave right
[25:28] uh let's pick it up from verse
[25:41] 38 let me let me read also first before
[25:44] I ver let me read also the early part of
[25:47] the place that when Jesus was told about
[25:51] Lazarus and then he invited he invited
[25:53] his
[25:55] disciples to come to a res
[25:59] Resurrection to come and
[26:01] partake in the resurrection of
[26:04] Lazarus and we as disciples
[26:07] today being invited by the same Jesus
[26:10] Christ to come and
[26:12] partake of the
[26:14] Resurrection amen amen
[26:20] um all right let me read a portion
[26:24] here somebody I get uh um uh John
[26:29] 11 verse one now a certain man was sick
[26:33] named Lazarus of bethan the of Mary and
[26:35] her sister
[26:40] mattha it was that Mary which anointed
[26:43] the Lord with ointment and wiped his
[26:44] feet with her hair whose brother Lazarus
[26:47] was
[26:53] sick therefore his sister said unto him
[26:56] unto Jesus saying Lord
[26:58] behold he whom thou lovest is
[27:04] seek when Jesus heard that he said this
[27:07] sickness is not unto death but for the
[27:09] glory of God that the Son of God might
[27:11] be glorified
[27:19] thereby about
[27:21] Jesus about Jesus and he was God example
[27:24] six
[27:25] son and brother
[27:28] his life after he was
[27:31] baptized at the River Jordan by John the
[27:36] Baptist is the example life that you and
[27:39] I should take for our
[27:41] examples he was God example
[27:45] sit and is our
[27:48] example I will take examples from any
[27:50] other
[27:52] person as long as that example
[27:55] represents
[27:56] Christ we don't follow any man we should
[28:00] not follow any
[28:02] man or we should take
[28:04] examples but that
[28:06] example must exemplify
[28:09] Christ that example is not to lift up
[28:12] any
[28:15] Manor
[28:17] church over and above another
[28:19] one that example must exemplify
[28:24] Christ because he is God example SE
[28:29] son Hallelujah every example points to
[28:34] him amen amen hallelujah
[28:39] hallelujah
[28:42] amen now when Jesus heard that verse
[28:45] four he said this sign is not to death
[28:48] okay I think I read already verse five
[28:50] now Jesus loved Martha and her sister
[28:53] and
[28:56] Lazarus
[28:58] elar when he had heard therefore that he
[29:01] was sick he two days still in the
[29:03] same place where he
[29:11] was you will think Lazarus is
[29:15] sick was
[29:17] dying and Jesus was almost he even
[29:20] appeared like he did not
[29:23] care but he has the lesson here from his
[29:26] example
[29:28] Jesus run through the Bible
[29:31] Jesus never
[29:34] panicked never
[29:36] panicked no matter what happened or what
[29:39] not happened never
[29:42] panicked don't you
[29:45] panic all things work together for good
[29:50] what we are supposed to do is to commit
[29:52] our
[29:54] wayto the
[29:55] Lord and leave us as close to God as we
[29:58] possibly
[29:59] can and God he'll make everything work
[30:03] out all
[30:04] right but too many times we panic and
[30:08] when you
[30:09] panic you don't give God a chance to
[30:13] work because it's just nature they will
[30:16] not come into your
[30:18] Panic the Bible says Be
[30:23] Still mes Moses go to to the Red Sea
[30:28] Mo was all
[30:29] panicking because the people put
[30:31] pressure on
[30:33] him they pressurized him look at the
[30:36] ahead of us and they were
[30:39] panicking and the Panic was transferred
[30:41] to
[30:42] mes and moed complain to
[30:46] God as though God had let them
[30:49] wrong and God scream back at Moses stand
[30:54] still because when you panic you will
[30:57] not give God a chance to
[30:58] work on your
[31:01] behalf because his nature to not panic
[31:05] his Spirit cannot work in the midst of
[31:10] panic is not a panic stricken
[31:14] God he steals everything that's why he
[31:18] can go to work the Bible said still and
[31:23] know that I am
[31:25] God whatever the problem
[31:28] whatever the
[31:31] challenges and know that I am
[31:34] God
[31:39] Amen Jesus
[31:41] here this is Jesus here walking into a
[31:45] call to the
[31:47] resurrection no
[31:49] Panic All Things are under
[31:51] control God is in
[31:54] charge then verse seven
[31:58] he said then after after that say he to
[32:00] his disciples let us go into Judea
[32:06] again his disciples say unto him Master
[32:09] the Jews of late s to Stone thee and
[32:12] goest thou
[32:21] again Jesus answered are there not 12
[32:24] hours in the day if any man walk in the
[32:26] day
[32:27] he tumbleth not because he seeth the
[32:30] light of this
[32:37] world but if a man walk in the night is
[32:40] Tumbl because there is no light in
[32:46] him this things sayth he and after that
[32:49] he saith unto them our friend Lazarus
[32:52] sleepeth but I go that I may awake him
[32:56] out of sleep
[33:00] and he telling you and I
[33:02] today friends sleep Arena sleep Mar
[33:08] sleep columus sleep Luther sleep the
[33:12] Pentecost sleep and I go in you to awake
[33:16] them
[33:18] again he's inviting you to partake in
[33:22] this
[33:23] Resurrection to bring on this
[33:26] Resurrection
[33:28] not as an
[33:29] onlooker but as a
[33:32] partaker actually CA the resurrection
[33:39] to
[33:41] amen verse
[33:43] 12 then said his disciples Lord if he
[33:47] sleep it shall do
[33:51] well how be Jesus spake of his death but
[33:54] the thought that he has spoken of taking
[33:56] of rest in
[34:01] sleep that's always a
[34:04] problem when you're talking and people
[34:07] stay in the natural
[34:08] Realms they they they weigh everything
[34:12] every every every everything that in the
[34:15] Bible in the natural
[34:18] realm brother Johny told
[34:20] you like we've been speaking about they
[34:23] run everything through their
[34:25] emotions
[34:28] they have a
[34:30] headache and they're sure their body is
[34:32] feeling
[34:34] bad themselves I am going to
[34:38] die what does the word of God say about
[34:42] it somebody say something to
[34:45] them quickly they condemn that
[34:47] person because that person came against
[34:50] them what does the word of God say about
[34:53] it their son does something wrong
[34:57] and somebody corrects that
[35:00] son they get angry at that
[35:04] person because it's their
[35:06] son another person another child does
[35:09] the same thing their son has
[35:11] done they condemn
[35:14] it because he not their son now just
[35:17] running their Liv through their
[35:20] emotions and these
[35:22] disciples instead of sitting in the
[35:24] spiritual
[35:25] Realm
[35:27] they felt if is sleeping he does well
[35:31] but Jesus had to tell them he's not
[35:33] talking about taking us rest in
[35:36] sleep come up
[35:38] either be
[35:40] spiritual let the word of
[35:43] God dwell in you richly in all
[35:47] wisdom then no man will be able to
[35:49] deceive
[35:50] you glory to God Amen then Jesus said
[35:54] unto them plainly Lazarus is
[35:58] dead and I'm glad for your sakes that I
[36:01] was not there to the intent that you
[36:03] might believe nevertheless let us go
[36:06] unto
[36:08] him amen verse
[36:11] 38 Jesus therefore growing again himself
[36:14] coming to the Grave it was a cave and a
[36:17] stone lay upon
[36:21] it Jes Jesus said take you away the
[36:25] stone Martha the sister of him that was
[36:28] dead sayith unto him Lord by this time
[36:30] he stinketh he has been dead 4
[36:37] days Jesus said unto her said I not unto
[36:40] thee that if thou wouldest believe thou
[36:42] should see the glory of
[36:46] God then they took away the
[36:49] Stone from the place where the dead was
[36:52] laid and Jesus lifted up his eyes and
[36:54] said father I thank thee that thou has
[36:58] heard
[37:02] me and I knew that thou hearest me
[37:05] always but because of the people which
[37:07] stand by I said it that they may believe
[37:10] that thou Hast sent
[37:15] me and when he thus had spoken he cried
[37:18] with a loud voice Lazarus come
[37:24] forth and he that was dead came forth
[37:27] bound hand and foot with grap clothes
[37:30] and his face was bound about with a
[37:31] napkin Jesus said unto them lose him and
[37:34] let him
[37:39] go amen the Lord bless the of his words
[37:44] the call to the
[37:45] resurrection you may be seated and in
[37:48] the
[37:49] Bible Jesus is the center piece of the
[37:52] whole
[37:54] Bible coming is the centerpiece of the
[37:57] whole
[37:58] Bible it's coming at the beginning it's
[38:02] coming at the
[38:03] end and revelation
[38:05] 22 Jesus gave the final promise in the
[38:09] Bible he said behold I come
[38:13] quickly and there was a reply from a
[38:16] prde that's standing
[38:19] watching even so come Lord
[38:23] Jesus that last promise prayer have to
[38:28] do with the coming of the
[38:29] Lord Jesus said I come
[38:32] quickly the bride says come quickly Lord
[38:36] Jesus the coming of the Lord that's The
[38:39] Thirst that's the desire that's the
[38:42] control
[38:43] tower of every believer every single day
[38:48] that's the focus on your mind the coming
[38:50] of the
[38:51] Lord hallelujah every single day every
[38:55] single minute you are looking out for
[38:58] him you are watching out for
[39:01] him like the Bible said do everything
[39:04] that you do in the name of the Lord
[39:07] Jesus
[39:08] Christ when you go to school you are
[39:11] looking out for the Lord you will not do
[39:14] what the Lord will not
[39:16] do you will not keep a company that the
[39:19] Lord will not be comfortable
[39:22] with you will not hang out with
[39:24] friends that the Lord not hang out
[39:28] with you will not say words that the
[39:31] Lord will not say you are always looking
[39:34] at for the Lord looking out for the Lord
[39:38] even so come Lord
[39:39] Jesus that's not speaking about the
[39:41] Rapture
[39:42] alone that's speaking about your
[39:44] everyday
[39:45] living your everyday existence you are
[39:48] looking out for the Lord that's your
[39:51] ending sight you wake up every
[39:54] day the coming of the Lord is on your
[39:57] mind you are looking for the Lord every
[40:00] single
[40:01] minute you are looking to do
[40:04] everything in the name of the Lord Jesus
[40:07] Christ wherever you want to go
[40:10] to will the Lord be comfortable to find
[40:13] you
[40:14] there that's how you think every
[40:17] day and that's how you wait for the
[40:19] coming of the
[40:20] Lord that's what the coming of the Lord
[40:22] is all
[40:24] about it's not leave any
[40:28] and then at the end of the day you are
[40:30] going in the Rapture no they that look
[40:33] for
[40:34] him they that look for him the Bible
[40:37] said it shall appear to them every day
[40:41] without sin unto salvation so if you are
[40:44] sick every day you are looking for him
[40:47] if your son is sick your boy is weed you
[40:50] are looking for the Lord you are
[40:52] expecting the Lord to come you expecting
[40:54] the Lord to come to deliver your son to
[40:57] heal your son heal your wife heal your
[41:00] daughter whatever needs to be done you
[41:02] are looking for the Lord this is the
[41:04] coming of the Lord and the Bible said to
[41:08] them that look for him shall he
[41:11] appear the Lord whom you seek shall
[41:15] suddenly shall suddenly shall suddenly
[41:18] appear in his Temple hallelujah
[41:21] hallelujah that's what it is to walk
[41:23] with the Lord that's how you wait for
[41:25] the coming of the Lord
[41:35] amen so the Last Promise in the Bible
[41:38] and the last prayer
[41:41] centered on the coming of the Lord the
[41:44] consumation of all
[41:46] scripture the whole Bible the book of
[41:49] redemption is sit around this point here
[41:53] the coming of the Lord when Adam and Eve
[41:56] sin Genesis 3
[41:59] immediately God spoke about the coming
[42:01] of the
[42:03] Lord all down through the
[42:05] Bible the coming of the Lord that's the
[42:08] end
[42:11] Insight let me tell you a Bible princi
[42:13] May
[42:14] seated may be
[42:25] seated
[42:32] the coming of the
[42:34] Lord is the ending
[42:36] sight that's where God is going
[42:40] to that's his
[42:42] destination that's the purpose of the
[42:44] whole
[42:46] Bible God
[42:48] started his program with the end in
[42:55] sight
[42:59] you know what that
[43:00] means that means you have a destination
[43:04] you have a place you are going
[43:08] to that's how you start at all you start
[43:11] from the
[43:13] end you start from the end and walk your
[43:16] way
[43:17] backwards
[43:19] Glory
[43:25] seated
[43:26] I want to be sure you really get
[43:29] this when you go when you left your
[43:32] house this morning you were at home but
[43:35] in your mind you felt I am going to
[43:39] church getting to church was your end in
[43:43] sight we are not in church
[43:45] yet you're not in church yet but because
[43:49] that's where you want to go to you make
[43:51] all your
[43:52] plans all your arrangements to get you
[43:55] to that end
[43:57] to get you to church you may
[44:01] seated when your when your neighbor
[44:04] comes this morning to say I've come to
[44:06] visit you oh I've been W to visit you
[44:08] for years now I've come to visit you
[44:11] this morning let us talk together for
[44:13] about two hours because of your ending
[44:15] sight it affects all your plans you tell
[44:18] your
[44:19] neighbor I am sorry I don't have time
[44:22] this morning I am going to church you
[44:26] are not in church yet but that end
[44:29] Insight affects all your programs all
[44:32] your plans affects the way you live the
[44:35] way you view things affects your world
[44:38] view because you have a destination that
[44:41] you are going
[44:42] to that's how God lives and that's how
[44:45] God wants us to
[44:46] live we didn't just come here we have an
[44:49] end in sight we didn't just believe we
[44:53] have an end in sight our end in sight
[44:56] is the coming of the Lord and insight is
[44:59] the call to the
[45:02] resurrection that's what you are here
[45:05] for you're not here to be a
[45:08] doctor that's a vehicle on your road to
[45:12] your end
[45:14] inside you are not here just to be a
[45:17] housewife because if you're here just to
[45:19] be a
[45:20] housewife you'll fight your husband
[45:22] every
[45:23] time when your husband is not
[45:26] to when he disappoints
[45:30] you or when you just disagree with him
[45:33] you fight him every
[45:35] day but because you have an end sight
[45:38] the thought comes to you this way I am
[45:41] doing with my husband or with my wife is
[45:45] he going to come to the end
[45:49] sight hallelujah hallelujah isn't this
[45:52] like my neighbor coming to distract me
[45:55] from my en
[45:59] so the coming of the Lord that's our
[46:01] ending sight when we go to school when
[46:05] we go to work at at the in the home in
[46:08] our relationships they end inside why we
[46:12] chase the whatever we need to chase in
[46:14] the world for school for our jobs for
[46:18] our
[46:19] careers whatever you want to be you have
[46:22] your hand in
[46:23] sight that's why a Christian believer
[46:26] will not get a
[46:29] career that would hinder him from
[46:32] running the race of
[46:34] life you can do whatever career you
[46:37] want you can aspire to be whatever you
[46:40] want to
[46:41] be but you will not choose a career or
[46:45] any aspiration that will hinder you from
[46:48] your ending
[46:54] sight
[46:59] that's how God lives and that's how he
[47:01] wants us to live and so does God have an
[47:05] end Insight concerning
[47:07] you way back before the fish of the
[47:11] world he chose you and loved you before
[47:16] you had a chance to do right or wrong
[47:19] because he knew you will believe it he
[47:22] didn't look at your struggles he didn't
[47:24] look at your weaknesses he looked in
[47:26] your
[47:27] heart there is one who will believe it
[47:31] so God wrote your name in
[47:33] Blood and no man no devil no mistake no
[47:39] habit can take your name out because
[47:42] it's Written in Blood your name is
[47:45] written in
[47:48] red there's no erasor there's no bleach
[47:52] that can wipe off your name because
[47:55] where God wants to get you to where God
[47:58] wants to get you to God's end insight
[48:01] about you God's end Insight concerning
[48:04] you it shall not
[48:06] fail it will not fail it cannot fail
[48:12] Hallelujah God has determined that you
[48:14] are going to the
[48:16] resurrection God has determined that you
[48:19] are going to cause the resurrection of
[48:21] the sins because they without us could
[48:24] not be made perfect you will call the
[48:27] resurrection you will bring on the
[48:29] resurrection that's thus say the Bible
[48:32] That's thus say of the Lord that's
[48:35] Malachi from the pages of the Bible it
[48:39] shall not
[48:40] fail Glory
[48:54] Glory
[48:59] the end in
[49:00] sight amen when you become a Christian
[49:04] you didn't become a Christian to see
[49:06] whether this is going to work or
[49:08] not what's your purpose becoming a
[49:11] Christian but when you have your hand in
[49:14] sight I am here to
[49:17] stay I am not going
[49:19] back I mean to make it all the way to
[49:21] the
[49:23] resurrection you are ready for the
[49:24] journey then
[49:31] when you are going on a
[49:33] journey and you know you have to be on
[49:35] that
[49:36] Journey when you get to the
[49:38] motor and you find you forgot your
[49:42] passport you don't say well that's the
[49:44] end of the
[49:45] journey then the journey doesn't mean
[49:47] anything to
[49:48] you but the journey is important to you
[49:51] you say I forgot my passport quickly get
[49:55] your passport so you can continue on
[49:57] your journey the challenge the hindrance
[50:01] of for getting your passport doesn't
[50:03] make you give up on pressing on with the
[50:06] journey so when you become a
[50:08] Christian whatever the challenge you
[50:11] have an attitude Lord this is the
[50:14] challenge we have now Lord how do we go
[50:16] around this challenge how do we overcome
[50:19] this Challenge and he will help you
[50:22] because your ending sight is to being
[50:24] that called to the res
[50:27] hallelujah
[50:33] hallelujah amen amen now there have been
[50:36] seven seven Junctions of
[50:39] time in man's history on the face of the
[50:44] Earth Noah Abraham Moses Elijah Jesus
[50:51] Luther and then the great Junction the
[50:54] Great the great Junction of time in the
[50:57] seventh age here is first Thessalonians
[51:01] 4:16 the coming of the Lord is a great
[51:05] Junction and at a junction you decide
[51:08] which direction to go either to go
[51:10] forward to go right ways left ways or go
[51:13] backwards but we are pressing forward to
[51:16] the coming of the
[51:19] Lord Glory now remember the prophet
[51:23] William Bram that in the coming of the
[51:26] Lord if you read through the whole Bible
[51:29] there are three comings of the
[51:31] Lord when God said the the the the the
[51:35] seat of the woman shall bruise thy head
[51:39] Z he was talking about his first
[51:42] coming as well as the second coming as
[51:45] as his third coming and in the Bible you
[51:48] will see there are three different
[51:51] comments Mal taught us these things he
[51:55] taught us this things first time he come
[51:58] first time he come the first coming he
[52:01] come to Israel as a little baby in the
[52:05] manger hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[52:09] hallelujah second time it comes he comes
[52:11] in a secret
[52:13] Rapture and the third time he comes it
[52:16] comes in the for the Millennium and the
[52:18] kingdom age in Revelation 19 that's the
[52:22] coming of the Lord in the Bible is not
[52:24] what coming there three
[52:31] comings but you and I our concern this
[52:35] morning is with that secret second
[52:38] coming first Thessalonians
[52:41] 4:16 for the Lord himself shall descend
[52:45] from heaven with a shout with the voice
[52:47] of the Archangel and with the Trump of
[52:49] God and the dead in Christ shall rise
[52:51] first and brother bam he called that
[52:55] the secret second
[52:59] coming if you
[53:01] notice if you stud your
[53:04] message anytime brother bam talk about
[53:07] this secret Second
[53:08] Coming he always identified it as first
[53:12] thians
[53:14] 4:16 the coming of the
[53:16] Lord oh
[53:19] Hallelujah he
[53:21] comes Amen to take his
[53:24] bride
[53:26] here for the
[53:28] resurrection and the Rapture and that's
[53:31] what you have been called to you have
[53:33] been called not just to go in the
[53:35] resurrection you have been called to
[53:38] partake of this Resurrection to bring on
[53:40] this Resurrection you will cause this
[53:42] Resurrection to
[53:52] happen but a secret affair it's not in
[53:55] the
[53:56] open it's not an all commer
[53:59] Affair I want I run some some some
[54:03] message
[54:05] people who compare this with
[54:09] Pentecost it's like there's nothing was
[54:11] the differ between and
[54:14] P no there's a lot of
[54:20] difference now I do not
[54:23] subscribe to that school of in the
[54:26] message who cancels that everybody
[54:31] else on they not in your
[54:34] group they don't see eye to ey with you
[54:37] you cancel them out I don't belong to
[54:40] that
[54:41] group I don't believe that's the spirit
[54:43] of
[54:44] God that the spirit Spirit of God goes
[54:48] out to goes out of the
[54:50] lost if you think the person is lost see
[54:53] how you can go after them and restore
[54:55] them
[54:56] again so I don't believe in
[54:59] that and I also don't believe in that
[55:02] group that says Pentecost are
[55:05] devils I don't believe that I don't
[55:08] believe that because William Bram never
[55:11] taught us that when said those people is
[55:15] said I'm against the system of
[55:18] denominations that's what I'm
[55:21] against because that system keeps those
[55:24] people bound
[55:25] they in a
[55:26] prison they've got to take permission
[55:29] from their denominational heads before
[55:32] they can do anything the system hold
[55:34] them
[55:38] bound but you will never you will never
[55:42] in Pentecost find them talking let's
[55:45] talk about going in the Rapture we're
[55:47] going in the Rapture but you'll never
[55:49] find them teaching you how to prepare
[55:52] for the
[55:54] rapture they talk in
[55:57] generalities but they'll never teach you
[56:01] future you childin you on how to get
[56:05] your things
[56:06] ready so that you might be in the
[56:09] resurrection so can be in the Rapture in
[56:11] the
[56:12] sky because they do not
[56:14] know but William
[56:16] Bram is the only man that I know you
[56:20] might know somebody else is the only man
[56:22] that I know who T us
[56:25] and said at the end of the Pentecostal
[56:28] age after Pentecost is done and over at
[56:31] the end of the Pentecostal age we are
[56:33] supposed to receive we are supposed to
[56:36] receive another messenger another
[56:40] messenger World hallelujah
[56:45] hallelujah and this messenger is going
[56:48] to speak out the seven thundering voices
[56:52] which is going to prepare the bride for
[56:55] great translation Faith the seven
[56:57] Thunder voices is going to show how how
[57:00] to get out of here run through the
[57:03] streets find me a man who spoke like
[57:07] that you will never find
[57:16] one so William Bram he's the only man
[57:20] who did not talk in generality about the
[57:23] rapture specific terms how you are going
[57:27] to go in that
[57:28] Rapture search Willam Bam's message
[57:30] through and
[57:31] through will find out the only thing
[57:36] said will prepare you to go in the
[57:39] Rapture of the Skies the only thing that
[57:43] will get you ready for this call to the
[57:46] resurrection is the seven
[57:48] Thunders on the back of the
[57:53] Bible
[58:00] now you may not agree with me what the
[58:03] seven Thunders are but you've got to
[58:06] admit that William Bram said the seven
[58:09] Thunders is the only thing that will
[58:12] give you rapturing faith that will give
[58:15] you translation faith that will get you
[58:17] out of hair to go in the Rapture in the
[58:20] skies that's why we are different from
[58:23] Pentecost
[58:25] we are talking about a
[58:27] preparation a preparation to go in the
[58:30] Rapture in the skies even when we go to
[58:32] school when we go to work when we have
[58:35] our challenges it's on our minds our
[58:38] preparation to go the Rapture of the Sky
[58:41] by doing that we are vindicating that
[58:44] prophet of Malachi we are vindicating
[58:47] his
[58:50] message we are vindicating God sent a
[58:53] prophet to get me to get you to prepare
[58:59] people because the the the End of Time
[59:03] messenger his message his job will be to
[59:07] get the bride ready to go be the
[59:10] bridegroom and that's what we are here
[59:12] doing that's the message not just to
[59:16] preach you
[59:17] happy to get you prepared there's a
[59:21] focus there's a goal there's an ending
[59:24] sight
[59:25] the coming of the
[59:34] Lord amen amen glory to God
[59:38] Amen oh
[59:40] glory amen now William bam Tau us amen
[59:45] that the seven seal on souls in prison
[59:49] page 50 it said the seven the seventh
[59:53] seal one 3 4 5 6 the seventh
[59:57] one not all seven but the seventh one it
[1:00:02] said the seventh
[1:00:03] seal brought him back down to the
[1:00:11] Earth and like brother told you last
[1:00:13] night
[1:00:16] potentially said we are been in this
[1:00:18] second coming because the seventh seal
[1:00:22] in the book of redemption he says
[1:00:26] silence brought him down to the
[1:00:28] Earth and when the seven seal in the
[1:00:31] book of redemption was open down come
[1:00:34] the Lord on the earth so you and I will
[1:00:38] recognize this things and so we know we
[1:00:41] have been in the coming of the Lord
[1:00:45] since the seventh
[1:00:47] seal brought him down to the Earth say
[1:00:50] malach for open up the seven sheld come
[1:00:54] Lord on the
[1:00:55] earth that's why you go every day you
[1:00:58] know the Lord is around somewhere he's
[1:01:01] in your house is's on the job is
[1:01:03] everywhere when the child is sick when
[1:01:06] the husband is not well when there's no
[1:01:09] food on the table the Lord is around
[1:01:11] somewhere call him on the sin don't
[1:01:14] fight and force Don't Panic call Jesus
[1:01:18] on the sin because we are in the coming
[1:01:20] of the
[1:01:21] Lord better than
[1:01:23] Pentecostals and Baptist Methodist we
[1:01:27] recognize the Lord is among us we
[1:01:30] recognize we are in the coming of the
[1:01:49] Lord so we've been this coming of the
[1:01:52] Lord for some time now
[1:01:55] somebody in some Far distant
[1:01:57] future but we see the lord always around
[1:02:00] us and aen that knows that the Lord is
[1:02:03] always around
[1:02:05] him nothing can face that man that man
[1:02:09] is
[1:02:10] stabilized because you know the Lord is
[1:02:12] around you it controls your behavior it
[1:02:16] controls your thinking controls your
[1:02:18] words control your relationships because
[1:02:20] you know the Lord is
[1:02:23] around you know the angels of the Lord
[1:02:25] are Camp around those that fear Him and
[1:02:29] you don't want to do anything or think
[1:02:31] anything or say
[1:02:34] anything the Lord will not be pleased
[1:02:37] with because we recognize the coming of
[1:02:40] the Lord is going
[1:02:41] on glory to God amen glory to God
[1:02:46] Amen so the Lord has sleep in in
[1:02:51] secret may be
[1:02:53] seated
[1:02:56] he sing in
[1:02:59] secret like a in the
[1:03:01] night under the seventh
[1:03:04] seal because the seventh seal brought
[1:03:07] him down to the
[1:03:09] earth now time is
[1:03:11] going so I don't have too much time to
[1:03:13] read all
[1:03:14] this but what is this seventh
[1:03:17] seal what is this vehicle that brought
[1:03:19] him down to the
[1:03:21] Earth that the rest of the world knows
[1:03:23] nothing about that even many in the
[1:03:25] message say it's not open yet but that's
[1:03:29] the vehicle that he hides in sleep and
[1:03:33] come down on the
[1:03:35] earth oh glory to God
[1:03:38] amen amen am Oh Glory may see let's Co a
[1:03:44] little bit
[1:03:53] here
[1:04:02] let me read a few quotes here I didn't
[1:04:04] just quote it but let me just read a few
[1:04:05] quotes
[1:04:06] here what is the seven SE that to the
[1:04:10] because Revelation 81 says when he had
[1:04:13] opened the seven SE was
[1:04:15] silence so let's see whatam said about
[1:04:19] this won't take this
[1:04:23] because knows God by
[1:04:26] himself and God speaks to
[1:04:28] them and nobody can tell
[1:04:35] them
[1:04:37] sadly many people in the message are
[1:04:39] like that
[1:04:41] too it is called it is called
[1:04:45] childishness that's why they Pentecostal
[1:04:50] babies because they in this
[1:04:52] age that is called call the age of
[1:04:55] infinite
[1:04:57] wisdom they know it all they have it all
[1:05:01] figured out God loves them God speaks to
[1:05:04] them so they won't take from
[1:05:07] anybody isn't that how children
[1:05:10] are let let me leave that alone glory to
[1:05:13] God Amen so he said here on the seal on
[1:05:17] the seven sale page
[1:05:20] 555

[1:05:25] verse of the eth chapter of
[1:05:27] Revelation Revelation
[1:05:29] 81 we must remember that this seventh
[1:05:32] seal is the end of time of all things
[1:05:36] that's right the things written in the
[1:05:38] seven seal book SE up of the Plan of

[1:06:24] is telling you that the angel said town
[1:06:27] will be no more in the days of this
[1:06:30] great thing to happen everything runs
[1:06:32] out in this CH they at the end of this
[1:06:35] seven seal now notice the seventh seal
[1:06:39] is the end of the church age it's the
[1:06:42] end of the seven SE it's the end of the
[1:06:44] trumpets it's the end of the V and even
[1:06:48] ends the aing of the
[1:06:50] Millennium that's on this seven sale
[1:06:54] it's just like firing a rocket into the
[1:06:57] air and that rocket explodes
[1:07:00] hair and it goes up then it explodes
[1:07:03] again it puts out five
[1:07:06] stars one of those Stars
[1:07:09] explodes and five STS from it and one of
[1:07:13] them STS
[1:07:14] explodes it on

[1:07:19] is it just ends the time for the
[1:07:22] world it's end the time for this end the
[1:07:25] time for that it ends the time for this
[1:07:29] it ends time everything just ended up on
[1:07:33] that seventh
[1:07:35] SE now how is he going to do it that's
[1:07:38] what we don't
[1:07:40] know we don't know how isn't it we don't
[1:07:44] know it's even the time for all these
[1:07:46] things and the usering of the
[1:07:50] Millennium notice the breaking of this
[1:07:52] seal was so great
[1:07:55] that heaven was hushed by it in silence
[1:07:58] for the space of a half
[1:08:00] hour now is it great what is it it was
[1:08:05] hushed Heaven there wasn't a thing moved
[1:08:09] for half an
[1:08:11] hour on page
[1:08:13] 557 said no angels singing no Praises no
[1:08:17] Al service nothing there was silence
[1:08:21] harsh deadly silence in heaven half hour
[1:08:25] all the all the host of Heaven Was
[1:08:27] silent for this half hour when this
[1:08:31] seven mystery in the book of redemption
[1:08:33] was broke open think of it for the seven
[1:08:37] seal is
[1:08:38] broke the lamb breaks
[1:08:41] it you know what they were Ed by
[1:08:46] it they didn't know there it was now
[1:08:50] none of us know what this seven seal is
[1:08:54] but I'm going to tell you my revelation
[1:08:57] of it and now I am not PR to be a
[1:09:02] fanatic if I am I'm ignorant of
[1:09:05] it I'm not giving away to such larious
[1:09:09] things imaginary
[1:09:11] things I've said some things that are
[1:09:13] kind of strange to some
[1:09:15] people but when God comes around behind
[1:09:18] has
[1:09:19] Vindicated and says it's the truth and
[1:09:22] that's God's word it seems strange that
[1:09:26] way now as as I stand on this platform I
[1:09:30] have the revelation of that seven s
[1:09:33] revealed that seven seal is in a
[1:09:36] threefold
[1:09:38] manner that I will speak to you by God's
[1:09:42] help of onefold of
[1:09:45] it let's go over there first here the
[1:09:49] Revelation to begin
[1:09:51] with I want to tell you what it is
[1:09:54] one fall of it what happens is that
[1:09:58] those seven
[1:09:59] Thunders that he have thunder out I was
[1:10:02] forting to write that's what the mystery
[1:10:05] is laying behind those seven consecutive
[1:10:08] Thunders rolling
[1:10:11] out and people say the seventh seal was
[1:10:13] not open or here the prophet is saying
[1:10:17] the seventh Thunders is a
[1:10:20] secret behind the seven seal the silence
[1:10:23] there now why let's prove it let's prove
[1:10:28] it why it is a secret that no one knows
[1:10:31] about John was forbidden to write about
[1:10:36] it to even write a symbol about
[1:10:39] it this is why there was no activity in
[1:10:43] heaven it might give away the
[1:10:47] secret but it's so great it must be
[1:10:51] included because it's got to happen
[1:10:54] but when the seven
[1:10:55] Thunders now notice when the seven
[1:10:58] angels come forth to sound their
[1:11:00] trumpets there was one Thunder when
[1:11:03] Israel was gathered there was a trumpet
[1:11:06] when time shall be no more the last
[1:11:08] trumpet one Thunder but here is seven
[1:11:12] straight Thunders right in the
[1:11:14] Row 1 2 3 4 5 6 seven that perfect
[1:11:19] number seven thunders in a
[1:11:22] row
[1:11:25] altered not just one 2 3 4 5 six seven
[1:11:31] straights the heavens couldn't write
[1:11:34] about that Heavens can't know about it
[1:11:37] nothing else because there's nothing to
[1:11:40] go on it's a relaxing time it was so
[1:11:44] great till it kept secret from the
[1:11:48] angel now you know why if Satan should
[1:11:52] get a hold of it he might do great
[1:11:55] damage there's one thing he don't know
[1:11:59] he can interpret anything he wants to
[1:12:01] and imp personate any kind of a GI he
[1:12:03] wants but he can't know this it's not
[1:12:07] even written in the word it's a total
[1:12:09] secret the Angels everything shut up if
[1:12:13] they made one move it might give coming
[1:12:15] away so they just shut up we Happ
[1:12:19] everything
[1:12:20] St seven God's perfect number
[1:12:24] oh Hallelujah seven Thunders all
[1:12:28] straight together like they are spelling
[1:12:29] out
[1:12:31] something and Noti at that time John
[1:12:34] started to
[1:12:36] write John started to write and he said
[1:12:39] don't write it Jesus never spoke of it
[1:12:42] John Couldn't Write it Angel knew
[1:12:44] nothing about it oh Hallelujah so what
[1:12:48] is this seven
[1:12:49] seal from this quot here and so many
[1:12:52] other places I got to run brother let us
[1:12:55] know the seven seal that brought him
[1:12:58] down to earth is the End of Time
[1:13:01] seal is a Time ending
[1:13:04] seal everything ends on that seventh
[1:13:07] seal Hallelujah glory to God Amen
[1:13:11] because the seven seal brings Christ
[1:13:14] down to the
[1:13:15] Earth so if you're preaching your church
[1:13:18] the seventh seal it will end everything
[1:13:21] it will end the foolishness it will end
[1:13:23] the devil's programs whatever it is the
[1:13:26] seven SE is the End of Time glory to God
[1:13:30] but I got to run glory is that the seven
[1:13:33] seal is in the threefold
[1:13:36] manner threefold manner and on the rure
[1:13:41] 965 speaking about the seven the Rapture
[1:13:44] 965 he let us know what this Mana
[1:13:48] is the Lord himself shall descend from
[1:13:51] heaven with a shout of the Archangel
[1:13:54] Trump of God hallelujah it let us know
[1:13:57] also that Revelation 10 is underneath
[1:14:01] the seven
[1:14:03] seal hallelujah hallelujah and in
[1:14:06] Revelation 10 there are two angels
[1:14:09] there a trumpet angel and a man message
[1:14:13] Angel is all connected under the seven
[1:14:16] seal and in Revelation 10 there's John
[1:14:19] the bride there is all connected under
[1:14:23] the seven seal in the coming of the Lord
[1:14:26] are you with me glory to God Amen and he
[1:14:30] also said the seven seal is like an
[1:14:33] exploding Rock
[1:14:35] rocket you throw one rocket in the skies
[1:14:38] it explodes to five and each one of the
[1:14:41] five explains another five what is this
[1:14:45] this represents fire
[1:14:48] power this represents a promise of power
[1:14:52] bu underneath the seven
[1:14:54] seal and time holy ghost power you shall
[1:14:58] receive
[1:14:59] power
[1:15:01] Hallelujah always spoke Friday morning
[1:15:03] you shall receive
[1:15:04] power a promise of power filed under the
[1:15:09] seven seal the sum total the sum total
[1:15:13] of all
[1:15:14] this is that John was commissioned to
[1:15:16] write everything
[1:15:19] s and he wrote Under the FR second third
[1:15:23] fth six but when the seven happened when
[1:15:27] the seven broke he was told don't WR it
[1:15:30] in other words if John wasn't told to
[1:15:33] not write it John could have written
[1:15:36] what the seven SE was and written
[1:15:39] everything from that time up until this
[1:15:41] time here but he said don't write it
[1:15:44] John he was foring to write it
[1:15:48] Hallelujah don't write what's already in
[1:15:50] the
[1:15:51] scriptures brother bam said
[1:15:53] it was read in the scriptures is a
[1:15:55] secret that's hidden in the scriptures
[1:15:58] and told John don't write
[1:16:00] it but it will be revealed in the end
[1:16:03] time when I sent to Elijah the
[1:16:06] prophet glory to God Amen and Elijah
[1:16:10] will reveal the seven seal in Revelation

[1:16:57] and when it cried out seven funders
[1:16:59] their voices he cried out with a loud
[1:17:01] voice and seven Thunders UT their
[1:17:04] voices and we see Revelation 10:7

[1:19:26] 10 1-6 is a trumpet angel Jesus
[1:19:31] Christ amen amen what he does he he
[1:19:35] veils and hides himself because a secret
[1:19:39] he doesn't want them to know he sleeps

[1:19:44] secretly sleeps in in secret he hides
[1:19:47] himself in the message
[1:19:50] Angel Revelation 107
[1:19:53] and people see William BR William BR was

[1:20:43] going to come in the bride he veils in
[1:20:46] Malachi form he hides in Malachi form so
