and welcome and if i have your bibles i'd like you to turn to three portion of scripture zechariah chapter four verse one to seven isaiah 59 verse 19 and revelation 22 17. three posts of scripture tonight and we know that we are working within a time limit so we want to go straight into the word zechariah chapter 4 reading from verse one and the angel that talked with me came again and waked me as a man that is weakened out of his sleep and said unto me what's his dao and i said i've looked behold a canal stick all of gold with a bowl upon the top of it it's seven lamps thereon and seven pipes to the seven lamps which are upon the top thereof and two olive trees buy it one up on the right side of the bowl and the odd up on the left side there of an eye so i answered and speak to the angel to talk with me saying what are these my lord then the angel that talked with me answered and said unto me no it's not though not what these be and i said no my lord then he answered and speaking to me saying this is the word of the lord unto zerubbabel saying not by might know by power but by my spirit saith the lord of hosts who would dow go great mountain before zerubbabel though shall become a plane and he shall bring forth the headstone thereof which shouted in scrim grace grace unto it isaiah 59 19 so shall they fear the name of the lord from the west and his glory from the rising of the sun and when the enemy shall come in like a flood the spirit of the lord shall lift up a standard against him and all our scriptures from revelation 22 1 verse verse 17 and the spirit and the bride say come let him that heareth say come let him that is a tears come and whosoever will let him take the water of life freely i mean you may be seated praise god thank you lord jesus hallelujah praise be to jesus i have a title this morning re rebuilding the title is rebuilding the church again under the power of the spirit that's the title rebuilding the church again under the power of the spirit another inspiration the spirit and the bride say come another team three hours return restore and rebuild a context scripture first thessalonians 4 16 for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the archangel and with the trump of god and the dead in christ shall write rise first that's a context scripture in the natural this is present time now one man died unjustly in america and everything has changed it has brought and awakened internationally overnight and i was thinking that if that could be done and the people can get into a spirit of the thing now it's not just that happened in america you know notice how it went across the world it's a spirit it's an atmosphere it's a change of season and time and i'm wondering if i was thinking that what could be done if the people around the world can get into the spirit of the thing what about the bride of jesus christ for something to be done or spoken and then everything changes so what are you saying preacher you mean something could be done tonight and everything changes in you in this church in trinidad around the world something just turned now listen to this black people killing black people all the time in america you know but this one was different if that people could be murdered all the time in america you know but something turned hallelujah something just happened and god just do that many times all of a sudden something turned and all of a sudden your whole world just turned around you were sick but now you're healed you're explained but now you see something happen a door open for you all glory to god that doctor opened today hallelujah do you believe that oh praise god and brother branham from here i am he said merry purpose in our hearts tonight to be quiet before the lord wait upon him wait moment by moment expecting the right word to be said or the right thing to be done that would give us the appropriate fate that we could dash into the blessings of god you mean all these years we're waiting for the writing to be said the writing to be done that we can dash into the blessings of god all glory to god i am so excited i couldn't wait to come here this morning i couldn't wait to come here because i know that the hour is upon us it's gonna be the bride's hour oh give the lord a shout glory to god rome had their time greece had their time egypt had that time america had their time it's going to be bright time it's going to be our time the power of god going to strike the church of the living god oh hallelujah praise god amen hallelujah praise god glory today is june 14th this is 56 years since william branham preached the unveiling of god he didn't even preach that because nobody knew god had to be unveiled he had preached seven sins in 1963 but yet he sent out come to the unveiling of the mighty god only to find out that god must always be veiled hallelujah when moses wanted to see him he saw the back path of a man god must always reveal oh hallelujah praise god and in the early years of his ministry he said i represent the faith by we have a divine gift hallelujah a gift by first of all and second pull but by the purple it was god failed what are you saying but all that i'm saying on this third step on this third pull they're going to be god feeling the bride god going to be filled inside of you or else the world will see god you can't handle no book you can't pay them no tape you have to rip the veil off of this god oh give the lord i shout oh praise the name of the lord hallelujah hallelujah my lord oh glory hallelujah no i like time i'm a strange preacher give me ten minutes again it and deliver two minutes for change i like time because time affords i have no time to waste i can't even waste a word because of the time that we have all glory to god the word have to be accurate you have to be direct or glory to god hallelujah now before we see jesus come he has to appear let me rock you a little bit before he can come he has to appear if he happen he has to come he's still coming a long way let me read it for you yeah watch now watch jesus appearing and jesus coming there are two different words mean two different things the appearing of the lord and the coming of the lord the appearance of the lord is now and when he's appearing in his people the spirit working among them proving it is him with them getting them ready for the rapture are you emphasizing amen the spirit has to come and work among them to get them ready no no man behind the pulpit the spirit taking the words prophesied from the man behind the pulpit hallelujah and you'll find out the word spoken can be my words my dream my thoughts it has to be what the prophet already said because god sent one messenger with the voice of where would we be today when he prophesied what gonna happen in america where would we be a day a nice baptist a nice methodist a nice baptist pentecostal or we thank god for evening light [Applause] watch this oh hear the he's already appeared in these last days right here with us in a few last years it's a sign of his coming oh you mean when he begins to appear as i sign you is coming you mean the sick have to be healed you mean cancer curse you mean blind see crippled walk dead raise up your means have to have miracles in the church yes you can't sit down and hear hear hear you want to see god in your midst you want to see god moving god manifest you mean your confidence you mean that is what you want you are tired of people here with cancer leukemia all kind of condition and they're still so maybe seated so the appearing is a sign of his coming oh my hallelujah so he has to appear before he comes appear where among his people not in the white house no among his people hallelujah praise god he has to appear where among his people oh my and brother abraham question answers he's saying here he said in the upper room suddenly a song like a russian wind was upon them that was the holy spirit how many believe that was the appearing of the holy spirit like a wind a supernatural wind it was the appearance of the holy spirit now there was in the upper room and done come some man of the hour and then come somehow the most popular man and the man with all the mysteries and teachings it wasn't that we need the wind we need something to pour out we need somebody to talk out we need something to pour out you come here to get pour out praise god with the baptism and fire alive and fire apart he shall baptize you with the holy ghost and with fire i like that fire part that fire has burned things out burn the [Applause] i know people don't like this kind of ceremony you know go go you may talk and explain but we need fire fire in your soul quick and power oh glory to god when jesus destroyed his body and three days i was raised up you're not talking about no damn thing he talked about quick then power he was talking about the guarantee that if you go down god will raise them up or give the lord a shout oh glory to god and quick then power gonna be in your tongue them quick then power gonna be in your bones down quit them power gonna be all over you praise god trilogy nothing yet the world has seen nothing yet the right word will be spoken the writing will be done [Applause] and we're going to dash into the blessings of god [Applause] are you ready give the lord a shout are you ready listen to this i'm only building prophet talking i'm only building the always close at hand when you're going to see something happen when something's going to take place and all this background has been laying a foundation for a short quick message that will shake the whole nation oh may god give us that message this morning oh glory no no for our sermon a short quick message not gonna shake the whole nation there pentecost was 15 minutes he called all what he's saying there's a background he said oh what are you saying as a background something you're going to see happen something going to take place we talking for 50 years something after take place shout out take place don't let that mass fool you you know you have a motion to give god some praises you know that mass don't mean that you're silent under there you know oh glory to god john has story no mass you know john say hallelujah blessing honor power glory to god after that mass is always praising the dead may be seated the bible said when enemies come like a flood the spirit of god raise the standard against it so when god give his church a blessing they move along in that blessing so long until it becomes coming to the world they begin to run it down then the spirit of god comes in and raises a standard and there's a breaking fought a revival 50 years the message slaughters look at what church fellowship who is your father thank you message so when it comes come on and run down and there's a people crying god god god have to do something god never have a people crying and say are they crying or they crying they cry no no he said i've heard [Applause] when when you see it come come on you're here sweating it you're cool you're lukewarm you're coming to cheer with you you say i'll pray like you've been sitting too hilly remember and to our father you're cool but when you see you have a taste and you're fed up on you that is not what you know don't fill up with this one and that one you know you're in trouble you'll go in there don't go there you know start with you first say i this lord this is trouble what look in the mirror and say lord this is trouble all by himself change me rearrange me i'm not asking you to change the situation change me to deal with i want to handle it come on oh glory to god hallelujah praise god i want to deal with it [Music] glory the bride has no revival yet the fight in this revival thing too bad the bride has no revival yet there has been no revival dear no manifestation of god to stir the bride for 50 years we have revelation for 50 years we hear talk time for a manifestation of god to steal the bride he said we are looking for it this church we're looking for it has sometimes we looking for it we are looking for new new man modern man message man pope man bishop man hallelujah praise god we're looking for this thing here because my child is sick i want this thing to deal with it when i break my foot i want this thing to deal with it if i'm in a hospital bed i want this thing to deal with it oh glory to god though what my everlasting ah am hallelujah we are looking for it it will take those seven unknown thunders back there to wake up again he will send it he promised it he promised it there's not a promise for justinsville there's not a promise from new york or london or europe or africa or south america there's a prophet there's a promise from the lord himself he descended with a shout he bring your promise your promise say my promise that's your promise to give you a revival a seven thunder revival oh glory to god hallelujah praise god brother branham he's prophesying he said i know the next thing to happen is the restoration of the gifts to the church and it's the hardest thing i had to do this pioneering work is to do this god cannot give back the gifts to the church as long as the church is divided we have got to get the church together before the gifts can come and if all the full gospel people would come in one hat one accord there would be a revival that would shake the whole world and every spiritual gift would be in the church within an hour's time after it took place signs and wonders that was done by the apostles would be a minor thing to what could what would do if we could get the church together it's got to happen it will happen [Applause] it may be after i have passed off the scene but i want to put my word in this that you might know it is after he come off the scene it's going to happen why are you saying that brother over because the bible said there's going to be a unity of the faith oh glory to god nobody can change that oh glory to god hallelujah there's going to be a unity of the faith amen he said all christian people bang yourself together with one heart one accord for god cannot do more send the gifts to the church while the church is separated that then he can send the holy ghost unless we in one accord for it comes by the holy ghost oh my hell let's continue you are written epistles right of all men this from the unveiling of god he said let's translate that in the world you are epistles that have been written so this is letter made flesh you are written epistles so instead of talking word you are what we talking that is the object of being word written or word made flesh so you don't have to talk your talk you walk the talk that is why jesus can say when you see me he said he said he said you think you have eternal life hallelujah but you wouldn't come to me to have life oh my hallelujah not the written word but the word made flesh in other words that's rid of all men manifested word of god so peter and john they went up they perceived they were ignorant and learned they had no education but they take notice they've been with jesus they were ignorant and unlearned but they were written epistles read that they have been with jesus jesus here we go was manifested himself through them christ veiled in their flesh manifested made a life like he was in moses we talked about brother peter denying peter running away peter weeping peter christ veiled in peter if christ could be veiled in peter you mean christ could be veiling you hallelujah watch this incredible hari paradox this jesus of nazareth could choose a bunch of ignorant fishermen for his church instead of well-trained priests and in the missions of that day oh that a god that had all wisdom and could walk on waters and could take water into wine that could take five biscuits and free five thousand and take seven baskets left over how could that seem one the god that sesame eternity yonder that's bright till the sun hides his face from him the very pool of wisdom and purity of understanding and knowledge supreme of supremes that he would come to a place where a great organization of churches had all gathered together train all their men and he go down and pick up a bunch of dirty stinking fishermen that couldn't even write their own name and choose that type of man to set the church in order for his bride this great omnipotent god choosing these kind of men to set the church in order for the bride he said strange thing isn't it it looks like he took somebody that was trained he said but instead he take a church man instead of taking church men he took fishermen to do it very hard but that's the way he does it a real paradox when god took a bunch of ignoramuses we call them today holy rulers poor of the world goods and pour out the holy ghost on them in the upper room oh glory to god the head wasn't full the heart was full he poured out he said somebody bought paul the capo all knowledge knowledge is revealed you could pour out the holy ghost he poured into them the holy ghost and god want to pour in you in your holy ghost oh glory to god hallelujah praise god give the lord a shout hallelujah it seemed to please god to make his own church a paradox incredible but true oh glory to god do you believe that the same thing he's doing right now making a paradox out of his church by passing all the highfalutin and all this stuff here that is so-called church and anybody that he can get his hand that will open their eyes and see what's true and tested with the word of god we are living in that time god chooses such and makes it such a paradox god choose to take and leave them and set them in the ignorance and the highly smart education god does that he does that with his own choosing oh so the bride will not be wondering what's happened the bride will be not leave it for us to watch what is happening the bible will be part of those that is causing things to happen oh my hallelujah are we going good we going good i want to get on to this the script that we read was read in a message called the message of grace is something we be familiar with he says the rule there has laid the foundation with his hands he also tried to bring forth the headstone i want you to notice he never said he shall bring forth the cornerstone he shall bring forth the headstone now and we see in the scripture that jesus is the chief cornerstone he also is a headstone now if you will think for a few minutes that the seventh church is messenger was to restore the fate of the children back to the fathers and then he interpret that what that means in other words here we go this is so good rebuild the church again under the power of the spirit so for 50 years we were under the power of the word but right now i believe there's a junction here after coming up this lockout this lockdown because noah come out his lockdown the israel when there was an egypt they had to lock down to when they come out they was getting out oh glory to god in the upper room they had a lockdown too they was locked down in the upper room because they were waiting on something and god bring them out to lock down and if we come out of lockdown god bringing us out for something now notice god sent the whole world under a lockdown every country every nation all them people selling them do our churches and they're playing their churches because they could stream now oh hallelujah man sitting down and seeing where that is see god level the play and feel but coming out of that now is a whole different thing altogether it's a new season breathing upon us it's not the old thing it's a rebuilding or not by might not by power but by my spirit goggle rebuild and god gonna restore oh glory to god forgive me i will restore all the years all the way left out what people rob you from when this take away your blessing and take away this and take it with that you are going to restore you're going to return to your inheritance you're going to return you're going to get restored and you'll rebuild god god bless you you're gonna forgive your past you're gonna bless your future or give the lord a shout how many believe that he's gonna forgive your past and he's gonna bless your future oh glory hallelujah hallelujah glory thank you lord rebuild the church you see man could preach word and we could preach word and preach revelation but we can't preach spirit power belongs to god we can say what we want to say but you see upstairs you see that power god had to release that god had to give that even the beast was given power and the image unto the beast was given power to speak and this image of god oh i hope this morning revelation 22 17 you see it differently oh glory to god the spirit will come to the bride the bride will have a voice i'm not talking about not pushing no tape and playing tape i'm not talking about that god help me today hallelujah hallelujah let me finish read this in other words so to restore the fate you see people say this is more than dc binary review mystery truths the massachusetts have to take it to this all the mysteries have to be able to take it to this here because this is removable this is to bring forth the headstone and the prophet said is this the mystery of the thunders that will bring back the power into the church all the mysteries and mysteries and mysteries have to bring back power into the church if the mysteries can't bring back power keep the mysteries no wonder paul said do i know all mysteries if they're helping if they're healing it's a deliverance if they're freeing it's another anointing or glory while you're doing that but there's a mystery to access the power and that mystery is the faith that is what was once delivered to the saints because faith is the key that unlocks every door not your feeling you might be feeling sick but you could be healed this morning is that your feelings is your fate anyhow we had to hit the home shots we had so he said he said in other words rebuild the church again under the power of the spirit not by power not by might but by my spirit see at the lord not by organization not by denomination but by the holy spirit god will bring forth the church in the last days by what the holy spirit from jesus keepers appointments he was talking about the stone and the headstone and the capstone and that's the way god has brought his church from justification sound vacation baptism of the holy spirit and now musicians the ministry of the spirit which is what quickens the word oh you mean there's a ministry of the spirit you mean that's why the people doesn't have it right just yet the ministry of the spirit is what quickens the word oh glory to god i will say it again ministry of the world see that why the devil fights worship the atmosphere they don't even understand outside in the world they're all the music playing is to jam the young people and keep them in a certain spirit atmosphere you understand i'm saying then i didn't teach people on instagram and clap the old songs and and there's rocking there dead of the dawning some of these songs ring all dry no juice any songs at all you can't get these spirits when you're singing i can't even get nothing with it you don't have no juice they bring it out so much i'm not juicing it oh glory to god the devil fighting the atmosphere because when you come and they atmosphere you in the spirit and the minister in the spirit and the word is already spirit so when the word come now it could quicken to you so then it inspire you the person next to you don't even know what's happening inside of here that you and god that's you on your phone lying with god that you and god what's happened oh glory to god no in between that you're not forwarding no message you're getting a forward god doing it direct god has followed it to you due to this one on that one you're getting a word from the lord direct oh give the lord i shout hallelujah let me say it again the way that god brought his church from justification sun navigation baptism of the holy spirit and now the ministry of the spirit which is what quickens the word so that ministry in the church would have to be exactly like his his ministry comes back so that is what i'm expecting to see his spirit beginning to move mightily it wouldn't even be your prayers it will be the grace of god because when that headstone come down it came with shoutings of grace grace unto it oh glory to god so the ministry of the spirit here we go by the quench will be upon the bride hallelujah revelation 22 17. hallelujah the spirit and the bride say so god gonna put the voice of god in the bride or glory to god to call your family to call your loved ones it will be the voice of the archangel same voice that called lazarus from the grave oh glory to god hallelujah and if william branham identify the short in the coming of the lord the bride will identify the voice and she will be the final voice to the final age oh glory to god hallelujah i'm done oh give the lord a shout oh glory you must be seated here we go once more once again a prophet is in the land once more he will reveal the truth as he did paul listen to the authenticated prophet of god who appears in this last age what he says from god the bride will see the spirit and the prophet and the bride will be saying the same thing and what they say will already be said in the world oh glory to god they are saying it now coming from among her oh glory to god in the people's watch god sent wesley and that he was the voice with the word in this day the people who took his revelation from god became the living epistle rather known of all men for their generation when the method is failed god raised up others so it has gone through the years until in this last day there's again another people in the land who under their messenger will be the final voice to the final age oh glory to god and i am done last quote the scripture hallelujah from malachi chapter three it says once more okay oh god he said no i'm gonna finish this quote here once more the world will hear direct from god as at pentecost but of course that word bride will be repudiated as in the first age malachi 3 16 18 as we close you could pray something and then they that fear the lord speak often one to another and the lord heartened and heard it and the book of remembrance was written before him for them that feared the lord and that thought upon his name and they shall be mine said the lord of hosts in that day when i make up my jewels and i will spear them as a man's spirit his own son that saved him then shall he return and discern between the righteous and the wicked between him that saved god and him
