[25:43] family oh God bless you I don't have to
[25:46] introduce myself I'm sister

[25:59] called his wife we were together from
[26:03] the beginning I'm his first convert he
[26:06] preached to me and 62 empty
[26:10] chairs and we both see
[26:13] everyone who came into the church so I
[26:18] think it's only fitting I know exactly
[26:21] what he would like and I just needed
[26:25] to express to everyone our
[26:29] make you comfortable
[26:32] about how I see
[26:35] things my husband when um brother cumi
[26:40] came here he preached twice a message
[26:45] about Redemption by
[26:49] marriage I couldn't understand why he
[26:51] preached that twice but when he preached
[26:54] it had never left me and that is my
[26:57] story
[26:58] Redemption by marriage hallu I was a
[27:02] young Pentecostal girl looking for the
[27:07] truth and almighty God brought him into
[27:12] my existence and he's become my pastor
[27:16] and my husband
[27:18] Hallelujah okay so for 46 years we've
[27:25] worked the whole of South London giving
[27:28] out tracks and
[27:30] Witnesses everything we are quite well
[27:33] known

[27:40] lot and we have served a old generation
[27:46] because we have been in this for over 40
[27:50] years which complet a
[27:54] generation so let's go back my son and
[27:59] my daughter has told you about it for
[28:02] from my experience he my husband rose up
[28:06] in the morning he said I've got this
[28:09] appointment that appointment and I need
[28:11] to leave home at 10:00 I got my mom
[28:14] ready and we left the house I gave him a
[28:18] good breakfast he he has certain way how
[28:23] to eat I made him fruit salad just like
[28:27] he likes it and he made up his healthy
[28:32] cereal and I gave him a cook breakfast I
[28:34] say to him you need to heat well because
[28:37] you'll be there too long so we drove up
[28:40] happily the traffic was very calm and we
[28:43] arrive in stret him and he Pat me on the
[28:46] back see you later Pat my mom on the
[28:49] back say see you later mom and
[28:52] afterwards I was meant to join him here
[28:54] at
[28:55] church I was at um my sister's house
[28:59] when I got a call from a member of the
[29:01] church to say I don't know what's going
[29:03] on but I heard that brother Peter
[29:06] collaps I made it as quickly as possible
[29:09] to the church I came here and the whole
[29:11] road was blocked off with police and it
[29:15] was a crime scene anyway I came and know
[29:19] before that sorry if you can bear with
[29:26] me yeah yeah before that when the the
[29:31] the the member from the church called me
[29:34] and told me this and I'm I want to know
[29:36] something so I rang my husband's phone
[29:39] and then somebody picked it up and they
[29:42] said who are you and I told them who I
[29:44] am and they say to me oh I've got your

[30:05] seen he was lying on the

[30:12] say to me come in I just want you to
[30:15] identify that he him and I want his date
[30:20] of birth and they wanted some question
[30:22] don't touch anything don't touch him so
[30:25] I came in and I looked I said yes and I
[30:28] gave them all the information and they
[30:30] asked me to get back outside and while I
[30:34] told my children what happened and they
[30:37] start to make their Journey here so we
[30:40] had to wait out there a very long time
[30:43] and then the deacons and few people
[30:47] start to arrive and we had to wait until
[30:50] they did their checks etc etc until they
[30:54] were very happy to let us in as a family
[30:59] and while we were there and everything
[31:02] we thought well the you know the the the
[31:06] minister because this is what is would
[31:08] be expected the minister is there and we
[31:10] need a closure we need
[31:13] prayer no let me go back my son and I
[31:18] did a lost office they allowed us to do
[31:21] a lost office and my husband to remove
[31:25] all his um watches and his valuables we
[31:29] could take that and we did a what we
[31:32] call a lost office to get him
[31:34] presentable to send him off then the
[31:37] rest of the family came in and joined us
[31:40] and they pay their respect to their dad
[31:44] then we asked um if the minister would
[31:47] come in and just pray with the family
[31:49] and they allowed it and they took my
[31:54] darling husband away
[31:57] when I came in and I saw him and I had
[32:00] him to myself I thought I won't be happy
[32:05] unless I test my fi Lord I don't know if
[32:09] it's your will but I am going to call
[32:11] him back in the name of Jesus Christ
[32:15] because he did not say goodbye to me so
[32:19] I called him back about three times and
[32:23] then I looked at his face and he had a
[32:27] look at I know him I know him when he's
[32:29] asleep I know him when he's tired and I
[32:33] looked at his face and I saw something
[32:36] beautiful when he is
[32:39] working on anything like he's because
[32:42] he's is's very good with his hands when
[32:45] he is working and something's really and
[32:48] he digs and he digs and that look when
[32:51] he managed to get it out or break that
[32:54] rock or if he's got a pleased look on
[32:57] his face face he looked you know and I
[33:00] looked at him and he's got his little
[33:03] nickname for me and I looked at him and
[33:06] what I've seen on his face was Pokey I
[33:09] made it that is
[33:12] exactly that is that is
[33:20] exactly that is exactly the look he had
[33:23] on his face when I saw that how could I
[33:27] call call him back I wish him back he's
[33:30] achieved something that's right you see
[33:32] so that is um that is my husband that is
[33:36] what happened on the day and I want to
[33:39] say a very very big thank you to
[33:43] LCA thank you
[33:45] for choosing LCA as your church and him
[33:49] as your
[33:54] pastor if I can
[33:56] just I know I'm taking time but I won't
[33:59] have this opportunity again
[34:03] so I am telling you he was genuine
[34:07] that's right a very genuine person my
[34:11] husband he was brought up in a privilege
[34:15] situation those of you from Zimbabwe
[34:17] might know the kind of life in
[34:21] prosperous Risha or Zimbabwe at the time
[34:25] he is never wanting for anything he grew
[34:29] up quite privileged what he's done here
[34:32] he's done it
[34:34] absolutely from his heart and he's done
[34:38] it from a calling he could have done
[34:42] anything he he is a humble man he's got
[34:47] more title than just pastor but you
[34:52] would never hear
[34:53] it you he'd never use them he kept them
[34:57] very private he wasn't you know he
[35:01] doesn't flaunt anything you wouldn't
[35:03] know it what you see is what he is and
[35:07] that is the honest truth he he W he
[35:09] weren't doing this for fame he wasn't
[35:12] doing this for popularity or for
[35:15] position it was a job to be done and he
[35:19] did it and that is how he is a lot of
[35:23] people did not understand him but in my
[35:28] little opinion you couldn't have gotten
[35:30] a better person than that who has got no
[35:34] other
[35:35] interest more than the kingdom of God
[35:39] and that was his interest that was him
[35:43] to a
[35:44] te it does not thirst for popularity he
[35:48] does not thirst for fashion or riches or
[35:53] anything like that
[35:56] yet you you know if that was what he
[35:59] working
[36:01] for he could have had
[36:04] it and he had it am but he kept real
[36:09] humble Hallelujah and that is why I'm
[36:13] very grateful and very thankful to
[36:16] almighty God for his ministry to me he
[36:21] is my pastor he was just going through
[36:25] job and explaining things for
[36:28] me it it it's just
[36:30] wonderful
[36:32] and where is my strength coming
[36:35] from the Lord and
[36:39] again I'll finish on this what made me
[36:43] able to come here today or stand here
[36:45] today was a message preached by precious

[2:29:04] whatever way we can to create an
[2:29:07] environment and an atmosphere uh through
[2:29:09] our consecration our sanctification our
[2:29:12] dedication our financial support our
[2:29:14] physical support we appropriate so that
[2:29:16] we could prepare both this physical
[2:29:19] place and our hearts and the atmosphere
[2:29:22] uh because we know the minister could
[2:29:24] never bring the Revival it takes the
[2:29:26] people to create an environment that the
[2:29:28] minister can't even Minister because
[2:29:30] they are in a spirit of worship and
[2:29:32] expectation and they could pull from the
[2:29:33] angel so we want to encourage you for
[2:29:35] those who have made your pledges that
[2:29:37] you um continue to support that and
[2:29:40] those who have not yet made their
[2:29:41] pledges for the convention we encourage
[2:29:43] you to do so so that we could maximize
[2:29:45] what we're able to do for the upcoming
[2:29:48] convention both in terms of the
[2:29:50] Ministries that we'd like to be here as
[2:29:53] well as all of the other parts of the
[2:29:55] puzzle that need to come together for
[2:29:57] the whole picture to be complete so may
