refreshing from your presence may you do that tonight for them in jesus name we ask it amen and amen god bless you and if you have your bibles i'd like to read a fourth portion of scripture tonight isaiah chapter 21 you want to write read verse 11 to 12. first thessalonians chapter 4 verse to 18 revelation 10 1 to 4 and revelation 6 18 12 to 17. so let's read isaiah 21 11 and 12. the burden of duma he called me to me out of seer watchman word of the night watchman what of the night the watchman said the morning comet and also the night if he will inquire acquire return come first thessalonians chapter 4 reading from verse 13 from english scripture but i would not have you between ignorant brethren concerning them which are sleep that you sorrow not even as others which have no hope for if we believe that jesus died and rose again even so them also would sleep in jesus will god bring with him for this we say unto you by the word of the lord that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the lord shall not prevent them which are asleep for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the archangel with the trump of god and the dead in christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the ear so shall ye ever be with the lord wherefore comfort one another with these words revelation chapter 10 and i saw another mighty angel coming from heaven clawed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head his face was at the wooded sun his feet just spilled the fire and he had in his hand a little bit open he set his right foot upon the sea his left foot on the earth and cried with a load voice as when a lion roared and when he had crime seven thunders after their voices when the seven thunders had uttered the voices i was about to write i heard a voice from heaven saying unto me seal up those things with the seven thunders uttered and write them not we want to go to revelation chapter 6. i want to read from verse 12. and i beheld when he had opened the sixth seal and lo there was a great earthquake and the sun became black as sucklet of here the moon became his blood and the stars of heaven fell into the earth eema's a fig tree casted on timely figs when she is shaken of a mighty wind and the heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled together every mountain an island will move out of their places and the kings of the earth and the great men and the rich men and the chief captains and the mighty men and every bond man every free man hid themselves in dens and in the rocks of the mountains and set to the mountains and rocks fall on us and hide us from the feast of him that sitteth on the throne and from the wrath of the lamb for the great day of his right is come who shall be able to stand may god bless his word you may be seated o praise the name of the lord of a title tonight the morning comet and also the night what was the question watchman what of the night but the answer came kind of strange the morning comet and also the night and that sixth seal of judgment is coming it's on its way oh praise god but we bless god today that christ has slipped down under the seventh seal to deliver and redeem this end time bride who praise god so for a message i think this is a token he was speaking about the animal life he couldn't come back upon a human being when the blood was shed and the blood is the chemistry of the life but the life is something different from the blood but the life is in the blood and the animal life could not come back upon the worshipper so all the lambs and the bulls and the goats and whatever they was offering that spirit life couldn't come back upon the worshipper but watch he said because it could not come upon it could not come upon a human being because the animal life doesn't have a soul the animal doesn't know he's naked he doesn't realize sin it knows none so therefore it's a living being but it's not a living soul therefore that animal life couldn't come back upon a human being because it didn't have a soul in that life or where there is life a blood a life and a soul in that life the soul is the nature of that life but this glorious place under this covenant there's a difference between the blood and the life the token for the believer today is the holy ghost let me say it again the token for the believer today is not i believe the message i believe but the banner am i going to church the token for the believer today is not like my pastor is is the holy ghost not blood chemistry but is the holy spirit of god that is the token and god requires of the church today and must god here we go must see this token he must see it in every one of us this has nothing to do with what the pastor see what the elders see what the deacons see what your neighbors see what your wives see god must see the token in every one of us therefore here we go as the evening shadows are appearing and the rat is ready to be poured out from on high upon the ungodly nations upon the ungodly believers and upon the professors without a possession upon these things i've tried to unfold myself live right among it to see where it is standing before i said these things no we are living in the shadows and the rat is ready to strike and god is requiring a token that you yourself have received this token the holy ghost it's the only way and the only sign that god will ever pass because it is the literal life of jesus christ return back into the believer i think this word quote and again because it is the literal life of jesus christ return back upon the believer oh my so therefore judgment is coming to professors without a possession claiming we believe and we have not received is not good enough you have to have possession they came out of egypt into a land that they could walk on and say this is my land it wasn't pointing at it it wasn't prophesying about it it was possessing it oh glory to god and you have to possess what you know is your own and how you could know is your own is when it's revealed to you and how it's revealed to you is from your father that is what jesus said not an understanding of it but a revelation of it understanding and revelation is two different things many people understand a lot of things but they haven't heard from heaven yet when you hear from heaven nobody could change that nobody could cancel that that is your father upon this rock i will build my church and the gates of hell cannot prevail against it i believe in the grace of god but look no matter what your faith is you are not going to be judged by your faith you're going to be judged by your works and when you die debt does not change your spirit it only changes your dwelling place it only changes houses for you and if you die in your sins you go to a worse habitation than you are living in now if you die in christ you will be with christ for he is the way remember when you die that soul leaves you it never changes no sin death doesn't change the soul it doesn't change the spirit it doesn't change the soul it never watch it just changes the dwelling place it's still the same soul so if it isn't born again or a part of that eternal spirit of god it had a beginning and anything had a beginning had an ending and that's the reason god is the only thing that is eternal because being born again being an eternal life coming into your being oh praise the name of the lord death doesn't do nothing to a man but changes dwell in place it doesn't change your nature it doesn't change your fate it doesn't change nothing in you but your dwelling place so whatever way your nature is this morning if you are daughter of god's word you'll be a daughter over there and i don't care whole you are how you live how good you live it wouldn't change you one bit to die just your dwelling place and if you cannot accept the whole word of god the way it's written you wouldn't do it so no don't worry you won't be there oh glory to god you have got to accept it in its fullness in the power of its vindication and revelation of what it is then you are part of it and only his word that he'll raise up so he as he did his word as he did his word on the first easter morning only his word come forward oh praise and he was that's why i keep saying the rapture is in you oh glory to god what are you coming for is what is in you when the token is in you and that big super magnet pass it picks up what is magnetized to it and because your flesh is around that you go into but you have to have it inside of you you can't rub it on the outside nope inject it inside your head you have to have this thing inside of you oh could the lord broke somebody get some god praises so eve corrupted the whole human race by physical death how by rejecting the word and accepting something almost like it she caused all physical that because she left the true word and believed the true word all but a little bit one little disagreement with the full word of god caused every heartache every death everything has ever been on the earth eve done it she's the mother of death now you see where we are coming the mother of that notice she disbelieved what the word hallelujah isn't that right we know what the devil told her right god said and god didn't didn't mean that and so on and god said that settle but whatever god said that settles it and i think we have to come right back to that whatever god said that's it we don't need an interpretation of it let god manifest what he said there will be a revival there will be a revival there will be signs all the miracles there will be signs and more miracles there will be a fight for ministry there'll be a fightful ministry all glory to god we shall have a unity of the faith they're going to be united to defeat our hearts will return back to the faith of the fathers he sent a prophet to do that though our hearts will be turned back to the fate of the fathers whatever god said he will do amen that settles it it started with a little misconstruing of the word and the same thing it's the ending the same way notice that physical debt is the uniting of mother eve and satan together by disbelieving god's word they united and brought the product of debt debt is the product of united satan and eve together eve had the word satan is against the word and look almost 99 and 99 hundreds of it satan admitted was right so close the bible said in the last days that we see the very elective possible see how it come in how it always has been how it's going out the same way uniting of unbelief in all the full word of god you got it that brought that now what do we have in this last day that revealed to us the full word of god so any man any church any that that have unbelief connected with this message death that is produced by what uniting unbelief with the full word of god hallelujah oh thank you lord it have to be he said that's what brought that hallelujah is united unbelief with the word just a little tiny part of it little teeny weeny bit a hundred of one percent but it must be one hundred percent oh my how you feel tonight to believe all this word whatever god said i'd love that's true that's nothing but the truth oh glory to god notice god's daughter the church the bride is also a product of his word unite him oh glory to god the holy spirit in the body of flesh it produced the son of god it put a product of the righteousness of god and in the last days we are told i want these are sodom here we go the bride hallelujah will be united by the word of god made manifest in the flesh the holy spirit sealing them into god and sealing unbelief on the outside oh glory to god there has to come a ceiling oh glory to god you don't hear much preach about it but you have to be a ceiling put a mark upon those that sigh and cry oh hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord he said if i if the life of was in you you would live like be told if the life was hitler was in you you would live like hitler or when the life of christ is in you you would live like christ and the works of christ you will do if christ lived today he's the same yesterday today and forever oh give the lord a shout wherever you are in your house give the lord a big shout hallelujah there's still the neighbor next door by that shout hallelujah hear what he said national force put israel in the homeland national force that is governmental force national force put israel on a homeland national force will put the church in the world comes to the churches but the power of god will put the people in the bride it have no scripture for no man no preacher to put anybody inside that bride so no man could put somebody in the bride no manny could take them off from being the bride or give the lord a shout i'm so happy that god could reveal these things oh glory to god you are free tonight to be part of this glorious bright birdie who he fully called who we call it justified who he justified he had already glorified oh glory to god and god is sovereign i love him i love my love him because he is suffering he could get revelation to whomsoever he will hallelujah he could call whomsoever he will he could baptize whomsoever he will tonight he could heal whomsoever you will oh glory to god national force put israel in the homeland national force will put the church in the world of churches but the power of god will put the people in the bride so the devil's job is to make sure no power come to the church he want to make the church power us but not this time he is too late the secret is the word is in the bride and the power is being activated even right now tonight hallelujah god going to activate power inside of you oh blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah no national force will do it hallelujah but the power of god will raise the bride into glory there's coming an hour they're always coming and now is and the ceiling is about over oh glory to god so he prophesied not only there gonna be a ceiling but the ceiling will become over because 144 thousand jews had to be sealed stop the four winds until you seal those servants in their foreheads i heard a number of them a hundred and forty four thousand and moses and elijah hallelujah is going for them jews under the seven trumpets hallelujah but under the seventh seal he's coming to catch a bride hallelujah the morning cometh hallelujah glory to god and also the night hallelujah oh i'm looking forward for that morning hallelujah praise the name of the lord i'm looking forward for that bright morning hallelujah praise god my bible tell me hallelujah the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout hallelujah comfort one another with these words we will not hinder them that are asleep but the lord himself hallelujah shall we send women with a shout and then let revelation 10 that lord came down with a shout and raw seven thunders to gather them right together to show that right how to repair and to give that right faith all glory to god the morning coming but so also is the night hallelujah your revival is coming your healing is coming your quickness coming your dynamic is coming the morning coming but also the night oh blessed be the name of the lord there's a there's the hour coming now and the ceiling is about over where every man and woman on the face of the earth is going to be in the place of refuge like it wasn't this a noah or on the outside of it you have to make your decision in which place you want to be hallelujah that that safety is in jesus christ he is the only place he is the only one that has eternal life no man can come to the father but by him he's the act of our safety the holy spirit bears record with us and we have passed on dead unto life and jesus was speaking here of a coming storm which has got to strike every man every woman that's born in the world there is just no way out of it that storm will strike you sometime or other and depends upon what kind of foundation that you have whether your house will wear it or not oh glory to god you say abraham faith isaac love jacob grace and truly perfection and upon that foundation he build a masterpiece bride i will restore say the lord o give the lord some praises tonight hallelujah we not on some denominational foundation we're not in some church foundation but we're in the foundation of perfection oh glory to god god gave enoch the key to build that pyramid hallelujah when the storm about to raise we're going to be sealed in that pyramid oh that pyramid could live again that house of god will stand again oh give the lord some praises tonight hallelujah hallelujah jesus was speaking he said depends upon what kind of foundation you have whether your house will weather it or not there have been many lives saved because of preparation for storms and there have been many life lost because of failing to take heed of the warning of stores coming we see the newspapers the incoming storm when you go home do me a favor read revelation chapter you will see the uncommon plagues and storms to hit the earth and thunders and lightning on the shake the heaven walls are going to pass over the nation man will rot in their flesh diseases will strike them the doctors know nothing about and remember before that took place there was a ceiling when fought and that angel and the plagues was commissioned by god don't come near any of those who had the seal in your forehead and the seal of god is the baptism of the holy spirit ephesians 14 he said grieve not the holy spirit of god whereby you are sealed until the day of your redemption and no matter how hard they are rock no matter how many times the lightning struck close to it ten thousand shall fall on thy right ten thousand and i left but it shall not come nadi oh glory to god hallelujah god is waiting to place his church sons and daughters of god god let me lift the seed is my prayer so close till i can feel it with my hands almost hallelujah dearly is a and from his mother's womb silver and gold have i none waiting for the manifestations plural of the sons of god when god will make himself known hallelujah so he's not talking about revelation he's not talking about unfolding mysteries he's not talking about teaching teaching teaching he's not talking about explanation when god will make himself known when they will stop sickness they will stop cancer they will stop diseases you think can say something the bible said there is common a time when men will rot right in their flesh and the buzzers would eat off carcasses before they even die cancer is a to take the words coming but remember that horrible thing was forbidden in that day to touch those that had the seal of god that is what we are striving for now to get in and be positionally placed into the kingdom of god before these horrible big strike oh we're getting the signs of it but they're coming night time it's coming oh hallelujah oh glory to god here's the plan of it we talk about the seals first seal second seal third seal the book was sealed the book is broken and now seal after seal being tore off isn't that right you said here's the plan of it the first thing happened announcement in heaven first what happens a seal is open or not what happened a mystery is full unfolded and when a mystery unfold the trumpet songs it declares war a plague falls a church is open what is the war part for the angel of the church catches the mystery of god not fully yet revealed and when he does he catches this mystery of god he goes forth to the people after the mystery has been given to him he goes for to the people what does he start out there he begins to proclaim that message what does it start a war so every word message declares a war starts the war hallelujah praise god that's a war a spiritual war and then he said now watch and then god takes his messenger with the elect of that age lays them away the sleep then he drops a plague upon them who rejected it temporary judgment and when that is over then it goes on did he nominate bring a denomination and start off with the man's work like wesley all the rest of them and all of a sudden they scrabble again and then another mystery unfold what happened another messenger arrives on the earth or church age and then he arrives the trumpet songs he declares war when that happens he is caught away and when he's laid away a plague falls destroy them spiritual death hits the church and she's gone that group now it's amazing that all these different groups that have been called out through the ages it started with god it started with a messenger it started with a word committed to people but once that age switches or a new word of message from god comes and they don't move with it it remains dead it changed the debt hallelujah my god so it goes to show you have to continue with the word you have to follow with the flow of the word you have to move with the pillar fire hallelujah and then he went on to say the last angel come to the last angel he has no certain mystery but he gathers all that had been lost in the mother ages all the truths that wasn't truly revealed yet as the revelation come he revealed those things if you want to read it read revelation 10 1 4 you will get it this alone the mysteries of god is the ministry of the seventh angel it have no man to come afterwards to reveal any new mystery the mysteries of god alone is the ministry of this seventh angel isn't that beautiful tonight hallelujah so now there are seven churches there are seven plagues seven seals seven trumpets a trumpet represent war and by god's help with the book of history i can prove to you that we are living at the seventh trumpet for the seventh plague and the seventh seal to be open and the seventh vial to be poured out when the six one song the ceiling away and he said the world war that six trumpets sounded exactly and the mystery was revealed in deer for the baptism of the holy ghost oh glory and the people then how the church did not move up so he's saying when god dropped the baptism of the holy ghost which is 1906 the people didn't move up what happened and those who moving refused to walk in the light went back and the plague was open at that time and poured out on the earth which was influenza hallelujah i think it killed 30 million people 1916 or 1918 around there the plague opened up at that time and poured on the earth which has influenza that killed all the people that did thousands times thousands it's the plagues of god i'm told in the bible that there would be a time come for those who are not in this wonderful sunlight that the fowls of the air would eat the flesh of them that diseases is on its road and the doctors will never be able to stop it's the plagues of god the egyptian doctors which were far smarter than others today could not stop the plagues of god neither would could they shoot seers or the impersonators it took ocean and the power of god to hold his people under the blood of the lamb oh glory to god when god sends forth a message and tells the people and they don't receive it then he withdraws his servant and send plagues famine death spiritually speaking and physically also you watch for a depression brother you think you've seen something you just wait after a while you haven't seen nothing you think you are dying for a good spiritual revival you wait till a little bit you just wait long and cry to hear the word of god the bible said there'll be a famine in the last days not for bread and water alone but for the hearing of the true word of god so many gaunt of fables and heresies and fake news just like the day of fake this and fake that i said a fake teaching on fake revelation fake prophecy fake news hallelujah but god sent a messenger he said the spirit the prophet and the bride will say the same thing and what they say will already be said in the word once more the world will hear direct from god because the voice of god will be in that bride or who want to stop it who understand hallelujah before that voice oh give the lord some praises tonight hallelujah glory to god remember the very minute of jews receive christ the gentile church is gone the gentile church has the plagues poured out upon them the tribulation hallelujah praise god everything will be finished for the gentile church when the bride is taken from the earth the spirit of god leaves the earth he's at this filthy filthy still is this real to you this is becoming more more real he is righteous be righteous still he knows holy holy still christ leaves the century it becomes smoky the rapture comes he leaves the sanctuary he goes forth takes the book of redemption and claims everything he's redeemed there's no more militarily work how many united stands that hallelujah oh my hallelujah praise god glory to god hallelujah question i've got one i believe that christ comes forth to claim his material work now wait a minute will the foolish virgin be saved no whatever happens happens no after that time she's in a state she will have to go through the tribulation period we talk about people in this message i don't know what baptist and medicine panic i'm not talking mother i'm talking about virgins i talk about people that receive this word hallelujah here's it now she will have to go to the tribulation period and the reason of it is because she has rejected the atonement in its fullness she is a believer a professed believer but she will have to go to the tribulation hallelujah and the bible said the rest of them the dragons splitted water of the mouth what are all what that is and then you talk about never have them in a time that people have been hungry for the baptism of the holy ghost i wanted that will come back around what people recognize but listen to all these books all these tapes all this hearing and teaching and in church and whatnot and and things taking place and what i have now what i have could what do what i have could face the challenge of the hour what i have to get now oh glory to god maybe maybe we missed something maybe maybe we could have to go back for it maybe maybe maybe this oil is really real maybe you have to get an original experience like you have a little pentecost hallelujah i know they didn't talk much about it but maybe there is something to it yes there is something to it because the difference between the wise version and the foolish version the wise was wise enough to get extra oil the wise had the wisdom of revelation to god the wise had the wisdom of revelation to go get that oil oh give the lord some praises tonight not join your church and wake up to a pastor hallelujah but go get that oil but raise a man and worship some man go get some oil hallelujah praise god hallelujah the build systems are wrong dislike this message systems systems are wrong with you system around the churches six of them are only set seven thunders systems they built around systems systems the system don't have life it's the word have life and we challenge the system don't ever look to please man always look to please god that man ball cry criticize them laugh mock that is man but it's god you have to fear because when that place placed out a rock under the night time they will hide they say hiyos from the wrath of the lamb oh glory to god hallelujah hide us dense and caves that go behind them oh glory to god question and answers this is good tonight hallelujah you know what i've done i done who praised god if the church is saved even though she does not go in the rapture i believe you taught she must go through the tribulation for purifying but what about these that are dead how will they be preferred answer the bride don't need no purification she is already purified and they are dead back there these that go through they never receive the light that this church obtained has received they live under justification sanification and so forth they lifted the light that they had in a way they suffered and whatever they went through but now here we go in this rapturing time like this there will have to come a time now that this bride this is message people that reject the head part of the bride will have to suffer for her rejection hallelujah because the gospel wasn't made plain to them back there but it's been made plain to you today so you see it so plain you've done all had all these years and examples the seas are open the church is laid out and everything like that is so plain you can't miss it and if you reject it there's only one thing to do stuff of it oh praise god hallelujah you know why i scored so much all these years because i never wanted anybody to challenge me on the word and i've never preached a ceremony that anybody could challenge me on and say what yes what do you mean by what you see no i see him with this scene here i mean just what this is here that is why i know i cannot be challenged on the revelation of the word once i stay with this word and is if a man stay with the word god will show you a continuation of the very word oh glory to god give me a preacher give me a farmer give me a housewife not going to put god first i will show you a man that is successful despite all what the devil could put for him oh glory to god let me say give me a preacher give me a husband give me a farmer give me any man i'll put god first oh hallelujah oh glory to god thank you jesus hallelujah thank you lord jesus so where what what's the coming of the lord come and lord is leo the lion and before that it's cancer the revealage hallelujah so before the lion could come it has to have the revelation oh glory coming to catch that bride together isn't that right so six seal is judgment that's the night that is coming hallelujah but the morning confess for the bride that's the seventh seal he's dropped on version 10 to gather you to call you whoa we have so much to praise god for i can stop you right now i just keep shouting and keep praising god and two like john hallelujah glory to god hallelujah praise god ain't no tribulation saint the servants you come to call my name hallelujah i heard my name so i could shout tonight oh glory to god thank you lord jesus hallelujah hallelujah praise god praise god praise god i want to get something here now you said between the sixth and seventh seal the hundred and fourth four thousand is called we find out that they were matthias they have been killed and they had white robes and so forth he said no that was the bunch of jews that went through what pre-tribulation period when during that time of this last war they got to be hated by everybody eichmann killed millions of them in germany watch millions of innocent people saying jews because they were jews no reason it was marches in the tribulation of the pre-tribulation of eichmann so he's talking about a judgment hallelujah a condition that is pre-tribulation not tribulation in the yet hallelujah the nighttime and i miss that nighttime we strike it sunday the morning stars will come forward hallelujah to shine the light to announce the sun is coming oh gloria who knows son coming all we know we have books and tapes i'm talking about ghosts and a prophet hallelujah nobody in disturbing us nobody interfering us we have nothing for the for anybody to come and press us for oh glory to god when peter staggered all the upper room all them they will say look they just carried on they're just excited that was nothing but when peter said silver and gold have i known such as the heart give unto you rise up and walk in the name of jesus christ and that man that was different there was no shaking and the emotional the jumping jumping jumping jumping that wasn't that it was a man walking by the power of god that was loosed from peter it was the token on display it was a sun being manifested it was a son back in the garden of eden again having all the devils her glory and those devils recognize them paul i know peter i know who are you or give the lord a shout them devils could recognize those sons oh glory to god because we are hallelujah we are part of the spirits that rotated off of god that defeated that devil in the beginning oh get the lord i shout hallelujah michael and we standing with michael again tonight hallelujah and if we conquered him back here we're gonna conquer him down here there will be a triumphant church a glorious church hallelujah o praise god praise god hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh glory to god thank you jesus hallelujah hallelujah christ have to come to claim what he has redeemed the lord himself yes and no angel hallelujah he is the messenger himself hallelujah that's why the prophet could only open six seals because christ is the seventh seal come to the unsailing of the mighty god and the same god that was veiling that prophet could be failing the pride and one day you gonna take the robe off that pride uncover that pride hallelujah oh glory to god or doom devils will be on the run you talk about the victorious church you talk about your conquering church you talk about anointing church there see nothing yet wait till the anointing strike home hallelujah he said they got fate that was remnant after the doors are shut gold anointed church then oh hallelujah thank you lord jesus thank you lord jesus thank you lord now you see right now it could be at any time because the church is about ready to take his flight but remember when these things happen the bride won't be here remember the bride is gone she don't have anything to do with it this is a time of tribulation of purification of the church it's put upon her for her to go through it not the bride he takes his sweetheart out of the way so this great mystery secret the secret or mystery that was under the sixth seal of the book of redemption now remember these are hidden mysteries and the six seals all together is one great book six crows wrote together it unwinds the whole book of redemption and the reason john wept because if no one could get that book all creation was gone she just simply turned back to atoms and molecules and and cosmic light not even be a creation please nothing else you hear that he said john didn't get the book everything will just go back to cosmic light and molecules and atoms not even a person oh hallelujah glory to god but adam lost the rights of that book he forfeited when listen to his wife and she listened to satan's reason instead of the word of god it was forfeited it couldn't go back in the dirty hands of satan who tempted her to do it but he come and paid the price of redemption every man was born of sex born in sexual desire he was in the original sin satan and eve so he could not do it there's nothing in him no holy pope no holy priest no holy doctr divinity whoever it might be there was nothing nobody worthy and he couldn't be an angel it had to be a kinsman it had to be a man then god himself become a kinsman by taking on human flesh through the virgin and he shed his blood oh glory to god it wasn't the blood of the jew it was the blood of god we have redeemed god has redeemed us by thy blood and we shall reign on the earth or give the lord a shout mind we are more than conquerors tonight morning overcomers tonight corona virus oh no corona virus hallelujah there's going to be a brass revival there's gonna be a seventh on the revival the lord has already descended he's among us tonight hallelujah the manifestation of the holy ghost is that angel tonight trying to get the people back to the world oh glory to god because god could only vindicate the word hallelujah so here it is the tribulation period here stands them prophets who control the word of god sex seal nature being interrupted by an earthquake hallelujah mankind controlled that you know because right now the world have an interruption by coronavirus hallelujah the business world the governmental world the the amend whatever condition whatever it is it's all interrupted this one is the big one earthquake hallelujah wrecking everything that heaven's going to be shaken hallelujah moon turned to blood hallelujah all counting will be happening what what you want to be there for hallelujah the morning comet also the night morning coming for the bride the bride will have a morning one glorious morning hallelujah praises god the pulley gates hallelujah everything just set waiting for that bride he said i go to prepare a place for you oh hallelujah place already prepared oh glory to god for prepared people hallelujah he sent a prophet with a message to people our hearts not to have church and have church this was the way it wasn't the guy that i even said abuse and pulpit it wasn't that it was a family i'll be going back to the family of god taking on the name of jesus oh give the lord a shout feeling good tonight hallelujah all glory to god here it is the tribulation period here stands the prophets who control the word of god he said no i just want to skip down he said no what he's fixing to take a hundred and forty four thousand out of redemption out of the book of redemption oh glory to god so these prophets come with the book they have names the preacher called 144 thousands hallelujah isn't that right so he said i could remember every trumpet sounded under the sixth seal only then it was sounded no watch under the seventh trumpet you see the seventh trumpet is to israel the same as the seventh seal was to the church first seal history that gone you can't go there i can't see history to receive history fought sealed to come pelos right there right straight down to hell fifth seal souls under the altar six seems judgment but the seventh in silence and he said the seven series found in version 10. don't come the mighty angel hallelujah that connect with first thessalonians 4 the lord himself the same with a shout what is it the message that guided the people together oh glory to god to call your name hallelujah so the seven seal drop down before the sixth heal what was the seventh seal your morning oh glory to god hallelujah your morning comet and the night coming also the sixth seal is next but the seven seals come along with present tense redemption they call a bride hallelujah every day every day every day that blood is being applied to you every day every day you're pressing on this happened that happened but you're pressing on oh give the lord some praises hallelujah glory to god my god this is unbelievable hallelujah praise god isaiah 13 16-13 a scripture holy for the day of the lord is at hand it shall come as a destruction from the almighty therefore shall all hands be faint every man's heart shall melt they shall be afraid pangs and soul shall take hold of them they shall be in pain as a woman that reveal it they shall be amazed one at another their faces shall be as flames behold the day of the lord cometh cruel boat with right and fierce anger to lay the land desolate he shall destroy the sinners thereof out of it for the stars of heaven and the consolation thereof shall not give their light the sun shall be darkness going forth and the moon shall not cause a light to shine and i will punish the world for the evil and the wicked for their iniquity and i will cause the arrogancy of the protestees and i will lay low the haughtiness of the terrible and i will make a man more precious than fine gold even a man than the golden wedge of over here therefore i will shake the heavens and the earth shall remove out of a place in the wrath of the lord of hosts and in the day of his fierce anger oh blessed be the name of the lord you love him tonight o praise god praise god musician hallelujah oh blessed be the name of the lord the morning comment and so is the night hallelujah and the prophet said media come fought a revival of the just and a great power come among the church just before it is going it's not hard to pray that because you promise it and we are looking lord for that pull that we know will do great things among us he said oh my just gonna continue sharing with you and here is what i'm trying to say to you the law of reproduction brings forth after its kind in the last days the true bright church will come to the head zone will be a super church a super race as she nears the headstone what she will be a super church a super race a super church think about it a super race a super church a super race a race have to do with your identity your identification the kingdom you are from hallelujah who is your mother who is your father where your lines come from that is your race hallelujah praise god you identify with the heritage that has gone on before oh glory all the saints have always connected when the man stands here before the man before the throne of god all are heaven behind him oh glory to god become ambassadors of the throne oh glory to the royal ambassador a royal seat of abraham all hell backing up because heaven has come down oh glory to god angels fight flying back and forth back and forth because sons are coming forth oh glory to god hallelujah thank you lord he said they will be so much like him so much like him that they will be in this very image in the order in order to be united with him that's the purpose of the image god had bled him with something not like him that's why the dove and the lamb connects it has to be the same kind of nature that is him have the connection had to be kind of rough and gruff and carrying out with foolishness god not united with that it have to be a living fate living virtue living knowledge living temperance that's the logos all those virtues they will be the very manifestation of the word of the living god so when people reading text the text will be living the bride will be walking texts text made flesh hallelujah oh glory to god do you understand that now the bride will be the living text that's what jesus did you know you sit down for 18 years hearing them making all kind of fancy revelations then into petition and when it's time come fire take him power take him anointing hit him on the bank of the jordan river dove dropped upon him hallelujah then that dove led him into the wilderness to overcome the lust of the eyes lust of the flesh the power of life because god's pattern is that before god gave a man power and authority over others he has to have power over himself glory to god do i hear a shout everywhere let me say it against god's pattern it's before he gave a man power over others and other things he has to have power over himself if you can't conquer yourself who you want to conquer if they can't be in charge of yourself who you want to be in charge of that's the problem with governments and kings and prime ministers and presidents they can't control itself they want to mash up the country and control this one they have no temperament they don't have no life they will be the very manifestation of the word of the living god the nomination can never produce this they produce their creeds and dogmas and so on he said i believe on next one god is bearing record of his word we know that this is a day of salvation where god is calling men from the world from a life of sin on the life of service and in the day that god has poured out the spirit from on high great signs and wonders are to accompany the ministry of this day when the former and later reign are falling together what's supposed to happen great signs and wonders now the church god doesn't deal with the church as an organization he doesn't deal with the church of the group of people hallelujah he deal with the church as individuals each individual in the church that extracted message yet because ministers had them wronged up like if there's chickens in a barnyard and they're controlling the flock that is strike yet hallelujah the god is dealing not as a group but as individuals hallelujah so i am different from everybody else they can't connect me with anybody else hallelujah and god made me he eat your witty mole hallelujah praise god you are individual in god hallelujah praise god god doesn't deal with the church and organization he doesn't deal with the church of a group of people it's no secret here we go we all see it when a man proves and god loves him he takes him out somewhere to himself there in the front of angels he does something for him he lifts him up in the presence of god and gives him and fills him and sets him out that's the age we are living in oh glory to god same holy spirit that saved the lutherans and signed me by the methodist and battle of the pentecostal is now set in order the coming of the lord jesus will be so powerful that body will come into this group a church that will draw the rest of them from the grave there will be a resurrection that is what the holy ghost is for day without us not made perfect is that right final quote and i'm done tonight god is trying to place his church in position to manifest himself that's what his battle was all about all our minds and thoughts god can't take that in my thoughts and go to us it's not the same thoughts we'll have to knock that out god will give us experiences to flush us out pull it just out sometimes it's take 30 years to make a man 30 years to grind things out like a grinder 30 years to get a man in shape for a six month ministry get a man in shape for three months ministry hallelujah god trying to place his church in position to manifest himself getting one that he can work through like this and say there's my spirit flowing freely not getting them you know getting one one here watch watch i can work here then then you get another one over here and please say i can i can please him adoption placing manifesting taking him out dear put a ceremony in him visit him with an angel i ain't seen no angel coming before this time here the angel would be fightful way angel what wait wait talking about you know you you always say here adoption joshua only hear god's voice is when joshua went inland he met the angel you have to go into the land be placed positionally that is why your media angel god can change this pattern you can't meet angel entertainment it don't have that man claiming all kinds of things with the angel and nature tell them this lying on god some of them claiming to say lord scary so watch getting one he can walk through and say what there is my revelation flowing freely no there is my spirit throwing philly i can work here get another one over here and please him i can place him adoption place and manifest and take him out there put a ceremony in him visit him with an angel tell him something now if he told the truth no if he just making up something it won't work it won't work that won't work we have had a lot of that this is brother branham but i mean manifestations of the sons of god when god manifests himself and sends him out and then he goes forward what he says is truth and what he does is the truth what he does he manifests christ how will you judge him and the biggest question in the message biggest question the judge they judge here by everything else but this how do you judge him by the way he steers with the systems that is built around the message no no no no it doesn't say that here by the way he states with the word right with the word and that is how you know all man is by the way he stays with the word let's all stand and
