Just as I am without one plea, but that thy blood was shed for me and thou bits may come today. Oh lamb of God, I come. Let's bow our heads tonight. Heavenly Father, we thank you for your blood and this great opportunity that we could access your throne of grace. It was debt to go in that holy place in the Old Testament, that most holy place was debt, Lord. Now is debt to be outside of that place. God, take us in tonight and cover us with your blood. Cover us with your presence. May we get a revelation, a true revelation of our perfect standing through the blood where we are justified in your sight. uh have access by prayer and through prayer to all redemptive blessings. Have your way tonight. Speak to us by your word. Store our spirits, store our hearts tonight in Jesus name I ask it. Amen and amen. God bless you and welcome. Thanks for being here tonight. And if you have your Bibles, I'd like to read one portion of scripture from Isaiah chapter 1 14-20. of Isaiah chapter 1 and it reads thus. Your new moons, your appointed feast, my soul hat, they are trouble unto me. I am weary to bear them. And when you spread forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes from you. Ye, when you make many prayers, I will not hear. Your hands are full of blood. Wash you, make you clean, put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes. Cease to do evil. Learn to do well. Seek judgment. Relieve the oppressed. Judge the fatherless, plead for the widow. Come now and let us reason together, sayeth the Lord. Though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow. Though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool. If ye be willing and obedient, he shall eat the good of the land. But if he refuse and rebel, he shall be devoured with the sword. For the mouth of the Lord had spoken it. May God bless his word. It's interesting that the Old Testament gives a view of God in his element, in his intent, in his desire, in his purpose. this scripture come now that let us reason together use this uh to identify a conference with God. And tonight I have a title of a thought to share with you the rights to have a conference with God. Now some time back I challenge you on the word to believe the power of the word to believe the word for what it is because the word is is God. This omnipotent being omniscient all powerful condemn condens himself into the word. All you think about there's no errors there's no mistake. There's no uh he can't write he can't speak he could speak he could write he know exactly what is in this book where every comma is where every full stop and when he says come let us reason together though your sins be as scarlet they shall be white as wool he means that we have to believe that just what he says what he means you know we because of emotions feelings And these five senses that contact the natural realm, we could feel this way about our children, whether they good, bad, or indifferent. But when God spoke in the Garden of Eden and said, "The day you eat, that day you die." Talking to Adam. Now, Eve wasn't around yet. This is Adam getting the word. And he told Adam exactly what he wanted. And he said, "The day you eat thereof, that day you shall surely die." God kept his word and this is God's ability. This is what make God God. He has the ability to keep his word. Whether of blessings or of curses, whether of blessings or of judgment, he keeps his word. And that's why there's a caveat right there. The ending of the scripture we read, if you are willing, if you are willing, you will eat of the good of the land. If you rebel, of course, the sword will get you. So, it's clean. It's clear. God wants obedience. God wants our surrender. And he wants to negotiate because he wants to give everyone a fair chance. He's not talking about what condition you're in. He's talking about having a conference that we could discuss and deal with the challenges that you are faced with. But the challenges that confronts you. So let me just share some things that the prophet said here. Now I want to get it tonight. I feel this is very important and I want to get across tonight. But said this what a conference held for? What's the reason for these conferences? There's got to be a reason and they got to come to a certain decision. That's what conferences are for. and to make a decision. men in one place and other place and different minds and usually they have a certain place to have a conference whether in Sweden whether in London whether in England wherever uh you said they have Geneva conference Paris United Nations building they select a place where it's peaceful and attractive to work on the human spirit and usually there are conferences when there's a crisis when there's a crisis when there's a crucial need conferences are held and he spoke about when Hitler was around and Churchill Churchill and Roosevelt and others tried to put their senses together to pull it because it was a crucial moment when the world have been destroyed and he says here now the reason that they put these selected places and the reason they have them we are forced to a conference. So Hitler action invading this country that neck country and next country and so on forced the other countries of the world to get into a conference to decide how we will deal with it. That is the way they met post to a conference. And I want to let you know tonight the last plague that struck Egypt was death. And the prophet said the last plague going to strike before the Exodus is death. But this death is spiritual death. People in church are not dead. People in the message I'm going to say this way. I I I I'll keep it zoomed in. Why take church as Baptist, Methodist, Pentecost? No. people in the message with books and tapes, four years stone dead, hit with spiritual death. And it's a terrible thing because death carries a spirit with it. It carries an atmosphere with it. It is cold. It has no worship. It has no atmosphere. It is just dead. That's what the letter does. It kills. People are killed in their pews. killed in churches because the letter kill it but the spirit giveth life. You have to believe this is a word to you. A word of the scriptures. A word from the Lord. Let's continue. Praise the Lord. He said now the first thing that I could call for this earth first conference was in the garden of Eden when the angels came weeping saying your child has fallen. He sinned. He's broken your commandments. Something had to be done. The creator of God had fallen from grace, was subject unto eternal separation from the presence of his God and his maker. It was a crucial moment for the king of heaven that said, "The day you eat thereof, that day you die." And putting his trust into his son, his son broke his commandment. There had to be something done. It has, it was his creation. It was the work of his own hand. It was the love of his heart, the apple of his eye. Something must be done. So there was a conference call. God selected a certain tree in the garden of Eden. After he had thrown out bloody sheep skin behind the bushes, he called Adam and Eve. And there he made a conference and took over and made a remedy for this horrible thing his children had done. And there a decision was made. Always at a conference there is a decision. So if tonight you're trying to have a conference with God and in that there is no decision, you do not have a conference. A conference produces a decision. Some people don't want to go all the way because they don't want to give up certain things. And because they don't want to give up, they don't come like they're not ready yet to surrender because they're not ready yet to give up. They're not ready yet. They still want to have a X in the closet. They still want to have some path. They still want to have some bridge just in case they could turn back too. They they don't see themselves blowing up the bridge behind them and like Paul see this way forgetting the things that are passed. I press towards the mark. That is what God wants for us. So God made a decision and God acted on that decision and God put in a program and a plan of redemption to bring back his Adam and his Eve. But Abraham spoke about the next conference speaking about Moses. This one is very interesting because he was a one-way prophet and this will tie into what was spoken on Wednesday night. Instead of following the instructions of God, he killed a man and had the threatened fear of Pharaoh. He run into the wilderness for 40 years. 40 years think he worshiped 40 years. He thinks he's finished. 40 years because he did something 40 years ago and God is not going to use him again. That's not true. The slaves of Egypt, the task was so great, their backs were so sore, their heart was so broken until their Christ come before God till he was forced. Here we go to a conference. There is a way of forcing a conference. You can do it in your life. It's a showdown. The burdens of the people and the cries were so great till God had to be forced to call a conference. Do you see it tonight that your tears, your prayer, your cry, your burden could push God to act? And when God made a decision, it's got to be that way. We put a skip down. So God got a man called Moses, his servant. So before the foundation of the world, here we go. Moses was chosen to deliver the people. Moses had failed God. So failure is not a is is it could be a setback, but it doesn't cancel what God has ordained for your life. That should give us confidence and courage. Here we go. Listen. We who have feel God. We still have hopes. We feel him as a church. We feel him as a people. But let's call a conference. Talk it over with him. See what he will tell us. See what decision he'll arrive at. Now, God's man had failed. And God had to call a conference. He couldn't use no one else. He selected Moses. So he goes down into the wilderness somewhere in the back of the desert near Sinai. Selected on top of the mountain and he thought, I'll bring Moses up here. This will be a good place. So God selected the place, the mountain away from his wife, his children. And there he spoke to the prophet and they finally arrived at the subject. I have heard the cries of my people. This is on my table now. That's why I call you Moses. I've heard the Christ of my people. I am send you down. And Moses had words back with God. He said, "I'm a man. I can't talk." In this conference, God said to Moses, "Who made the mouth of man? Who made men to talk? Who made the deaf? Who made the dumb?" Moses still complain. He wanted to see God's glory. And God told him, "You know who I am, Moses? I am the God that perform miracles. I am the God that heals the sick. I am I am Jehovah God. And Moses said one more thing I want to know before this conference is closed. Who will I tell Pharaoh sent me? He said tell him I am sent you. Not I was or I will be but forever present. I am is present tense. Moses went down to Egypt. We know the story. And he was a separated person. The people was a separated people by the offering the blood putting the blood of the lintil the door that blood identified them as a separated people. Isn't that right? And after they was marching out, Pharaoh came behind them and listen to this part. This is what I want to get to. And they were on their march after being separated and called out people. They come to the Red Sea. They had to call a halt because they couldn't cross over. So on the journey and we on a journey tonight this this God they have to say stop marching because an obstacle is in front of us. We have mountains on each side and this is what the prophet said you know when that church ever stops that's when Satan takes over you've got to move constantly rapidly marching towards Zion don't let the church of the living God ever be guilty of stopping. So they stopped and said, "What's the matter here?" Soon as they stopped and pitched their tents, they heard rumble of wheels. Pharaoh coming. Brother Baram said this, "You soldiers know the strategy how they shut them off. There was Red Sea before them. uh there were high mountains they could not climb them and they would be be and they'll be stopped by the enemy. It shows this friend this is important tonight even in church today towards the promised land. The enemy is just a jump or two behind us. We cannot stop at this revival. This cannot be calling a halt. Just keep moving on. Go on. You've got a presence of the Holy Spirit with you. night before last and last night. Now continually move on into that. Don't call no halt for the enemy is close behind you. As soon as the halt was called, Pharaoh army was seen coming and the people was in that frantic. But there was one among them who knew there was no reason to be disturbed. He had a conference before. He knowed what had taken to get a hold of God. So he went on a hill, a rock. Moses hilt himself from the rest of the children of Israel and he held a confront. He said, "Lord, I have marched to this place, but an obstacle has stopped us. We have come to a halt." And then brother Ram interject this like our brother here in the wheelchair like maybe you sitting here with cancer or with heart trouble or something that you know you're just going to die right away. The enemy has stopped you. He brought you to a halt. Maybe you come to a halt before the enemy overtook you. Maybe there is something in your life that caused you to halt. Whatever it is, you still have the privilege of a conference. Let's talk it over with him. Let's do something about it. No matter what the enemy is, he's never too great for our God. We need a conference. So Moses went up behind a certain place, we will say, and held a conference with God. He didn't know what to do. Maybe you don't know what to do. Maybe you a sinner. You have done so much sin. Maybe you smoke till you can't smoke no more, till you can't quit it. Maybe you drank till you can't drink no more, but you can't quit it. Maybe you come to a place where you're so full of sin and lust till you have to look at every woman you see wrong. Maybe you even perverted your own natural resources. Maybe you have come to a blink. I don't care where you at. God is still ready to come to you in a conference and talk it over with you. Do you believe this tonight? What I just read here, he said, "I don't care where you are at. God is still ready to come to you in a conference and talk it over with you. You know sometime the devil uh bust people mind telling them it's no use uh going to God because you will do the same thing again. It's no use praying because you would act the same way again. Don't believe the devil's lie. believe what God is saying tonight that you have an access to this conference with God. He wants this conference. He invites you to a conference to discuss. He said, "Listen to this. Maybe you broke up your home. Maybe you left your husband or left your wife. Maybe you run off from your children. There might be many things in this life that the enemy has trapped you into. But remember my brother, sister, this is where I get it from. You still have the rights to have a conference with God. Say this after me. I still have the rights to have a conference with God. Let's say it again. I still have the rights to have a conference with God. Don't ever let the devil cancel that statement from you. Regardless of what condition you find yourself in, regardless of what you're in tonight, what you might be in tomorrow night or or next week or whatever, it doesn't matter. You have a right to pull aside and say, "Lord, I heard a word." You said, "Come and discuss it. Come, let's reason together. Come and let's go over this thing. I am in trouble. I am in weakness. I am in danger. I am in darkness. I'm in my own hell. I'm in my own prison and I want out. How do I get out? Could you lead me out tonight? We're not trying to scream and pull your hair and go crazy. We want you to discuss. You want to talk. We want you to relate. We want you to communicate because he's your Lord and he's your God. You're not going to the mayor. You're not going to the prime minister. You're not going to some governor. You're going to God Almighty and you going to talk it over with him tonight. Let's see if we could wrap up here. Praise the Lord. Remember my brother, sister, you still have the rights to have a conference with God. Moses had a conference and this was the conference. Oh great leader of Israel, I have done all this at your command. I've led these people as you told me to do. I've covered the people by the blood. I've brought down the plagues out of heaven. I've done everything you told me to do and we are trapped. What must I do? Lord, I must have this conference. And perhaps sitting on top of the rock, standing near the cliff of the rock where Moses was praying at a certain sealed place, in that crucial moment, something had to be done. They'll be crushed under the wheels of their chariots. They'll be pushed over every little Hebrew baby would would be busted in their heads. And that crucial moment and then he said this, maybe just not that way, but maybe a cancer has took a hold of you. Maybe some other disease, maybe sin has took a hold of you. Is going to crush you right down into the devil's hell. A separation from God. Hold a conference quickly. And when this conference was held, God stood on the rock by the side of Moses and he said, "Go back down to the camp, Moses. Go right back where you started from. I am God. Go down and speak to the people. Go forward. I'll make the way when it comes time to make the way. I'm a way making God. Moses after the confront was over was dismissed from the presence of God with a order to go forward and walked on and said, "Fear not Israel. Stand still this day and see the power of God. Go towards the sea." Oh, hallelujah. My God. This is so mind-blowing. Could you imagine this sea that was once a obstacle? Moses tell them go towards the seed. Don't move from the commandment. The commandment is go forward. The promise land belongs to us. This enemy is in our way. Has got got us cut off. But God said go forward. Keep moving. That's here we go. Listen. Listen, church. That's the matter with the church today. God calls you and he wants to give you Here we go. gift after gift. power after power, grace after grace, but you organize yourself. Well, I can't go any further because the church won't let me. See, there's no halting place in God. There's no place for denomination. There's no place to keep a certain standard. The thing of it is go forward. Speak God's word. Go forward. Just keep moving on. Keep moving. God says it's right. You got a commission. So, I say, "Well, I went to church and they told me that I ought not to go up to the tabernacle. I'm all confused about whether I should have the Holy Ghost or not. The promise is yours. It's to you and your children and to them that are far off. God said so. Go forward. Watch the enemy scatter. Watch the Red Sea open. Have a conference. Go forward. It will open. God is the way of escape. He made a way right straight to the promised land. Anything got in the way, he moved out of the way. Oh, praise God. And that's what Isaiah said. If you are sinful, your sins are like scarlet. Why don't you come and let us reason together? I'm almost done. And then he spoke about another conference with Jesus. And then Jesus, the lamb was the dove was leading the lamb to its death. And angels came down to listen at the conference. M Gabriel, Michael, wormwood, all the thousand of them sitting around the rock. He said to the disciples, he said, "They have lots of big meetings." And he had a conference. Now the father said, "Are you willing? Is your love for your brethren great enough? Is your love for that sinful stinking world that you were born in? Do you love them enough to forfeit your life? Do you love them enough to take their place, to bear their sins, the cruish debt? You could be nothing, die that kind of death but him." But in that conference such a decision was made. Note conference built decisions. Conference is not talk and there is no action point and there is no delivery of services as to what to do or what next course of action should we take. So if you have a conference with God, we if you have a conference with God, listen carefully church, we would see, your wife will see, your husband will see, your children will see the effect of the decision you made based upon that contracts. The father said, "Are you willing?" And such a decision was made until his blood dropped from his brow. He was under strain. The sins of the world was upon him. He looked into the face of the dove and said, "Not my will, but thy will be done." Then the prophet said this here. Oh, can we have that decision in our hearts this morning? Can you fulfeit that filthy life of yours? Are you willing to look into his face and said, "Not my will. I'm a drunkard, but I'll drink no more. I'm a gambler. I will gamble no more. I'm immoral, but I'll not be that way no more. I'm a liar, but I'll stop it today. I'm a foul person. But in this conference, and I say tonight, I would look into your face and take like my master who died for me to make my way clear. Not my will, your will. If it cost me my home, if it cost my husband, my wife, my father, my mother, my fellowship, my church membership, whatever it cost me in this conference tonight, I say I want your Holy Spirit to live in me. I have heard about it. I want you in me. Not mine, but yours. That is my decision. God has called a place not upon some high pinnacle, but a humble little tabernacle about to fall in. We have to have a conference. We are going to have a conference. And this is the last one. Are we going to close? This blow my mind. He talk about the conference. I will never leave you. I'll be with you. So, they didn't know how they will ever do this. So they went to Pentecost. 120 went to the upper room, closed the door and they waited and they waited. The trouble with us is we if we don't get an audience with God in about 10 minutes, we are tired. Our knees are hurting. We want to leave. If he doesn't answer us according to what we want, the way we think, we are disgusted with him. Oh, come let us reason together. Go up to Pentecost. I want to reason with you. just go up there and wait. 10 days they were sitting, standing, praying, everything, waiting for the promise. And all of a sudden, the results of the conference in heaven came down. The Holy Ghost like a rushing mighty wind. It filled all the house where they were sitting. They were filled with the Holy Ghost and they went forth preaching the word. When we have wool conferences, they usually have a selected place. And what do they do at the conference? They drink drinks, cocktails, smoke cigars, cigarettes. They lie to one another, deceive one another at peace talks of the world. But when God calls a conference, it is fasting, cleaning up, prayer, receiving our orders, going forward. That is called conference. Not feasting, but fasting. Not indulging in filth, but separating and cleansing yourself from all unrighteousness. So when you go before God, cleaning yourself by faith through applying the hiss up of the blood and cleansing your heart and walking before God for a conference, that's the kind of conference when you meet with God. Then God give you the orders and then he goes with you. May God bless his word tonight. Let's pray. Heavenly Father, I thank you Lord. I thank you for this word. I thank you for this word because the word is God. I thank you for the reality of calling us Lord to reason, to discuss, to talk it over. And now as they go into prayer, I pray this stir in the people's spirit have a conference with you. Lord, we are not Lutherans. We're not Wesleyians. We're not Pentecostals. We are sons and daughters of God called in this last day into a manifested reality. When Jesus told the woman at the well that the hour come when the true worshippers would worship the father in spirit and truth that sounds so light that sound that if it's just a word just there but to know by revelation that the truth was lost through the ages and you send an end time prophet messenger William Brham to restore that truth to bring us to the fate where we could correctly worship and to see the deadness and the lethargy and the sluggumishness of the people the entitlement like if they're entitled to the rapture because of what they believe. It's a shame, Lord. But God set our hearts on fire. The wise virgin paid a price. The foolish virgin was an idol and foolishness, but the wise was ready. And that is why they could go when the call behold the bride who cometh came forth. Father, help us tonight. May we not take this lightly. Maybe not take this as a as just like a sinner message or a sinner call because your restoration comes through repentance. That is your desire. You want man to repent. Repent of their sins. Repent of their past. Repent of their behavior. Discuss and come under the blood. Father, bless them tonight as they repent, as they talk it over, as they share their troubles with you. And lay the burdens at Calvar's cross. Lay their burdens at your feet. Grant it, Lord. Touch Anne tonight with his chest pain. Touch anyone here tonight who might have a trouble in their bodies, in their bones, in their mind, in their spirit. Touch them tonight and heal them. Heal the sick in our midst tonight and visit us with your presence, your love, and your power. In Jesus name I ask it. Amen and amen. God bless you. I trust tonight that these words would stir your spirit and help you to recognize that God is not dead. He's alive and he wants to do something special for you. That is why, praise God, you're going to bring this thought to you that you have a right to having a conference with God. So, God bless you as we get down in prayer right now. Praise the Lord.

Thank you for your spirit Lord. Thank you for God your fellowship father. Thank you for your blood. Thank you for this opportunity to call upon your name and to talk it over with you. Lord we praise you. We bless your name. We thank you for your love. We thank you for your grace. We thank you for send this end time this evening light that we could know to place our feet. We thank you for the encouraging words Lord from the scriptures for the word is God. We believe you. We believe your word. We believe the truth of your word. Believe that we could be anchored by your word. We could rest our faith upon that word. Your word is true. Your word is oh God is real father. Oh God make it positive father. You said when the enemy come like a flood, the spirit of God to raise a standard against the enemy by taking the same word and making it more positive. Father, may this word become so positive tonight into the hearts of every one of your children gathered here. Every one of your children that is hearing, Father, that will be inspiring to the hearts to know of your love, to know of your goodness, to know of your grace, to know of your favor, Father, that you favor us in a way that you want to have fellowship with us. You want us to discuss our weaknesses, our faults, our sins, our failures, our fears, our shortcomings, the thing that uh trash us, the things that hurt us, the things that affect us, that we could walk into a straight line of faith to believe and trust you for all things. When things seems all negative all around, we could still believe you and trust you. It was an amazing thing to see how Moses would come down and tell the people go towards the sea. The very thing that seem as an obstacle, the very same thing that seems as a hindrance, he said go towards it. Go towards it. Go towards whatever is like an obstacle or hindrance or going to affect us. Go towards it because it will be defeated. It will be conquered. You will make a way for us. Father, we thank you in advance for what you'll do this coming Sunday that your fire would fall. Your power would come out in a special way. May the people of faith, may the believer's faith grow to believe what they pray and what they ask for that you would grant. And they would come on Sunday under expectation for what they asked for. They asking for breakthrough, they come expecting it. Asking for healing, they could come expecting it. Asking for the appointment of the spirit, they could come expecting it. Asking for revival, they could come expecting it. Father God, may you there be such a great expectations this coming Sunday that there'll be an explosion of your Holy Spirit that the minister won't be able to minister. Father God, may there be a short quick message that will shake the whole nation by the Holy Ghost to token itself making appearance among us. Granted, Father, in Jesus name I ask it. I commit each one into your hands. The elders, the ministers, oh God, the elders, the deacons, the trustees, oh God, all the helps, the entire church, we commit it into your hands. We commit their lives into your hands. It's in Jesus name I ask it. Amen. And amen. God bless you saints. It's good to be here tonight. It's good to get a word from God. I hope you leave here strengthened, encouraged, and trust in him for all things. God bless you. Thanks again for being here tonight. God bless.
