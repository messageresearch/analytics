[14:10] us with your grace with your blessing

[14:15] minister to us tonight to enter into the
[14:17] spirit of prayer and supplication in
[14:19] Jesus might ask it amen amen God bless
[14:22] you and welcome I just have one
[14:25] scripture I'd like to read
[14:27] and it's from Isaiah 63 9.
[14:31] Isaiah 639
[14:34] it says in all the affliction
[14:37] he was afflicted
[14:39] and the angel of his presence sees them
[14:43] in his love and in his pity
[14:46] he redeemed them and he veered him and
[14:51] carried him all the Deeds of all
[14:54] and the emphasis there and the angel of
[14:58] his presence
[14:59] well last Sunday
[15:01] I replied a message in his presence and
[15:03] I shared some things before we play that
[15:05] Heap because I I felt a lot to do that
[15:07] they came to my heart about that message
[15:10] I've listened to it and it came into my
[15:12] heart about playing that message
[15:14] and I met sister John Oliveri at the
[15:17] bottom of research where I come from the
[15:19] office and she had sent me something an
[15:21] error and I told her it wasn't an error
[15:24] she was sharing something about Christ
[15:25] Mission God revealed I said it's not by
[15:28] chance I told her about this message in
[15:31] his presence
[15:33] I have to play it
[15:36] and then when I went up on my desk and I
[15:39] know this is something actually on
[15:40] Sunday but I somehow I feel to do it
[15:42] tonight
[15:42] when I went at my desk
[15:44] and this was clear and clean there was
[15:47] just one spoken book on my desk
[15:49] under my shock
[15:51] it was in his presence
[15:54] so I want to know how did that book
[15:56] appear how did that book a deal why is
[16:01] that book on my desk
[16:02] because that's very unusual I don't
[16:04] really have these spoken books on my
[16:06] desk you have I sort of a side uh a
[16:09] cupboard where we have those books and
[16:11] so on
[16:12] so when
[16:13] the assistant pastor working when Isaac
[16:15] came in I said but Isaac
[16:18] I said you know what they come into my
[16:21] heart that I have to play this message
[16:24] and no that was not a day we were
[16:25] playing a message no that was before it
[16:27] was everything with before I said and
[16:29] here it is this because on this desk how
[16:31] could this get you how is this possible
[16:33] so then he begins to tell me that when
[16:36] but Riemann Thompson was preaching
[16:38] he asked him to get a spoken with book
[16:41] and he went
[16:43] and just pull out a book out of these
[16:45] shelves that was dear
[16:47] and he just gave him that book
[16:50] and it was in his presence
[16:53] so you're kind of mind-boggling how all
[16:56] the pieces come together that I fear the
[16:59] lord is pointing us where we need to go
[17:02] where we need to be
[17:03] so in the light of that I want to read
[17:06] or testimony for you and this is from
[17:09] Brother Kelly's South he said yeah
[17:10] brother over this is after some this is
[17:12] regarding this person a message on
[17:14] presence some years ago I heard you made
[17:17] a statement at the end of a service but
[17:19] who is somewhat like when you get up on
[17:21] the seventh step you enter initial Glory
[17:24] that is where True Fellowship takes
[17:26] place those words struck my heart and
[17:29] I've been praying for it since that time
[17:32] recently I was asking the Lord what I
[17:35] should read I'm not feeling particularly
[17:37] inspired randomly choose a message
[17:40] called inspiration preaching always
[17:41] borrow Kentucky 1956 it was good but in
[17:45] dear he said the next night he was going
[17:49] to preach on the Lord's Second Coming
[17:51] so I decided to read that one also and I
[17:53] was surprised to find that the next nice
[17:56] message was titled the supernatural
[17:58] considering what Buddha balance said it
[18:00] was going to be about however this
[18:02] message has taken my breath away in dear
[18:06] he speaks extensively about presence
[18:08] although he often referred to as an
[18:11] atmosphere
[18:12] yesterday while taking a break at work I
[18:15] reached a part where he speaks about
[18:17] praying in his presence
[18:18] and she came out and I found myself
[18:21] stunned at his words
[18:23] afterwards while sitting at my desk
[18:25] listen to worship music I struggle not
[18:27] to weep as I considered what I just read
[18:30] it seemed like all I've ever wanted in
[18:32] life was setting right there in those
[18:35] three paragraphs although I pray that
[18:37] work I have no place to go like a tree
[18:39] like I wanted to write them so as soon
[18:41] as the lunchtime came I got in my truck
[18:43] and drove out into the countryside
[18:45] weeping and crying out to God to have
[18:47] what I just read about
[18:49] and I'm so blessed because I was able to
[18:52] check that message out and I want to
[18:54] play a little 10 minute script for me
[18:55] tonight but I want to title this tonight
[18:57] what I'm going to share with you prayer
[19:00] is to come into an atmosphere I extract
[19:03] that for something but around said and I
[19:06] want to read his voice and then we're
[19:07] going to play a little clip I will get
[19:08] them in prayer go to Brandon in this
[19:11] message called the supernatural
[19:13] it's the attitude of the people that
[19:16] brings the results that's the reason at
[19:19] Pentecost
[19:21] they had to go in an upper room and pray
[19:25] until the Holy Ghost came cause they got
[19:29] in one place one Accord it is the
[19:32] atmosphere that brings the results you
[19:36] believe that
[19:37] every man woman this villainous morning
[19:39] boy or girl get everything from their
[19:42] minds
[19:43] but the Lord Jesus
[19:44] and believe that he is standing present
[19:47] right now and you will see something
[19:49] happening that will cause headlines in
[19:52] newspaper in the morning that's right
[19:56] is the atmosphere I do believe in joking
[19:59] from the pulpit because the pulpit has
[20:01] no place to joke it's a sacred place
[20:03] but a Mr buzzword said I have a good
[20:05] sense of humor he said brother Brown to
[20:07] prove it's the atmosphere you could take
[20:09] a hand egg and under and put it under a
[20:12] puppy and tie him down it will hatch a
[20:14] chicken see it's the warmth of the
[20:16] puppy's body that will hash the egg
[20:19] they don't have to be under the hand it
[20:21] has to be under the puppy it could be an
[20:23] incubator it's the atmosphere here we go
[20:25] and it's the atmosphere that brings the
[20:29] miraculous and wonders and powers of God
[20:33] Among the people it is the atmosphere of
[20:37] the people note
[20:38] he didn't say the sermon of the pastor
[20:40] he didn't say the mystery of the
[20:43] unfolding Revelation he says the
[20:45] atmosphere now is the atmosphere of the
[20:48] people doesn't this sound familiar
[20:51] a minister kind of being a Revival they
[20:53] take the people to bring a Revival in
[20:55] their home he's talking about the
[20:57] atmosphere so it's the atmosphere of the
[20:59] people and when the people get to a
[21:01] place that they are reasoning and
[21:02] wondering and stewing and thinking and
[21:05] all talk and don't know where they do
[21:07] stand are for them not even scripturally
[21:09] taught how can you expect the atmosphere
[21:13] to be right you can't do it it won't be
[21:16] right it's got to be one Accord one
[21:19] place settled down with one motive one
[21:21] thing then you're going to see something
[21:23] happen no friends
[21:25] I want you to take these things like
[21:28] this tablets like if it's a doctor order
[21:30] these things as if it's cues as if it's
[21:33] uh special instructions and guidance and
[21:37] leading of the Holy Spirit don't don't
[21:39] think we're rolling that dice I believe
[21:41] that the footstep of the righteous are
[21:43] ordered of the Lord and God guide us
[21:45] into things and I want you to place
[21:48] closer content in just about 10 minutes
[21:49] and listen carefully to what the prophet
[21:52] is presenting praise God Amen so we want
[21:55] to go straight on that now by God's
[21:57] grace
[22:13] just one minute
[22:25] three
[22:27] Divine Healing and sanctification and
[22:31] the powers of God is as long as your
[22:34] faith lasts in it when your faith fails
[22:36] then your experience is gone
[22:39] it's based that way simply upon the
[22:42] finished works of Christ the calvary
[22:46] you're Sanctified as long as your
[22:48] testimony is right as long as you live a
[22:50] Sanctified life and believe that God
[22:52] sanctifies it you're sanctified
[22:55] count it all to his grace and his merits
[22:58] and as long as you can accept healing
[23:00] and believe your healing and and go on
[23:03] believe it like that you'll be healed as
[23:04] long as you believe it and you start
[23:06] doubting it and you take us a man
[23:08] sending you this morning it's all a bit
[23:10] sick and let him begin to get in his
[23:11] heart believe it he is sick they're
[23:13] packing all the buildings
[23:17] as your faith is
[23:20] so be it unto you that's our Christian
[23:22] sign I'm not meaning Mind Over Matter
[23:27] but to see the thing of it is it's the
[23:29] atmosphere that you live in
[23:31] now this man that we're going to speak
[23:33] of for just a few moments and I want to
[23:36] give you a testimony
[23:38] this man Elijah the great prophet
[23:42] was a man who lived in that constant
[23:45] atmosphere
[23:47] he was a cow man a Nazarite first
[23:51] all gifts and callings are without
[23:54] repentance
[23:55] it's nothing you can't make one hair
[23:58] black or white you can't add one cubic
[24:00] to your statue
[24:02] we only have carnal impersonation when
[24:05] we try to impersonate something that God
[24:07] hasn't made it
[24:09] if we try to do something that God
[24:11] hasn't called us to do we'll be a total
[24:13] failure doing it
[24:17] if man would try to make himself woman
[24:20] woman man how would you do it
[24:22] I met that woman that was exposed to
[24:25] have the surgical test and be made or
[24:27] man-made a woman whatever it was and
[24:30] Italy in Rome
[24:32] that you are the disgrace to being a
[24:35] woman drunk as she could be walking up
[24:38] and down the streets and or harvest
[24:40] sites you ever seen
[24:42] notice
[24:44] you can't make yourself anything
[24:46] different from what God intended you to
[24:48] be anything else is an impersonation
[24:50] therefore if your conversion is on
[24:52] because you're trying to hide behind
[24:54] something or trying to make yourself a
[24:57] better person you're only playing a part
[24:59] of a hypocrite
[25:00] until Christ has actually come to your
[25:03] life and change you and brought you into
[25:05] an atmosphere that's the difference of
[25:07] it
[25:08] that's the reason we go through so many
[25:10] different farms and saying they have to
[25:12] do this Jesus said he's a year of my
[25:14] word and believeth on him and certainly
[25:16] has everlasting life
[25:18] it's not a make-belief it's absolutely
[25:20] something that's happened
[25:22] on a conversion of the heart that's
[25:24] changed and brought you into another
[25:26] Realm
[25:27] men are misunderstood Christian women
[25:30] men boys and girls are misunderstood who
[25:33] live in those places because it's
[25:34] contrary to the Natural run of life
[25:36] among people of the world
[25:40] I'm sure we all want to live in that
[25:42] atmosphere look the people who eat the
[25:45] man out you're on the ground was eating
[25:47] the same manner that the high precede in
[25:50] under the Shekinah Glory
[25:52] but this man have withered away out on
[25:54] the ground but that in the hidden place
[25:56] never did wither away that lasted to the
[26:00] spans of years
[26:03] and a man who walked in there won a high
[26:06] priest went in beyond that Veil that
[26:09] Veil that separated the holy from the
[26:11] holiest of holies when he walked in
[26:13] there the veil dropped behind him that
[26:16] man he gives even sound proof
[26:19] he didn't just shut off from all the
[26:22] world and the surroundings
[26:24] he knowed nothing in there but the
[26:26] living and the presence of God
[26:28] and a man or a woman had ever walked
[26:31] into that Shekinah Glory of God the
[26:34] whole world shut off behind him
[26:37] no matter what the devil says you don't
[26:39] pay any attention to it
[26:41] and he's living in a different
[26:42] atmosphere
[26:44] he lived in there where they put Aaron's
[26:46] robbed
[26:47] and it was nothing but an old Dead stick
[26:49] off of an olive tree but once laid in
[26:52] the presence of God if yielded what it
[26:55] was supposed to be in the beginning
[26:57] and one night's time it buddies
[26:59] blossomed and brought on
[27:01] that's the same way that an unbeliever
[27:03] sinner has ever laid in the presence of
[27:05] almighty God over the influence of the
[27:07] Holy Spirit
[27:09] becomes a new creature right then
[27:12] life becomes fruitful Fresh Life comes
[27:15] in and he yields what he was supposed to
[27:18] be a son of God
[27:21] we were took off of the tree so is that
[27:24] Olive Branch
[27:25] he would talk also a tree but Sinners
[27:27] and and lukewarm church members become
[27:30] dry sticks
[27:33] with some kind of a memory that sometime
[27:35] there was a supernatural God in the past
[27:37] they had life and way back there but if
[27:40] you believe and lay in his presence
[27:42] it'll produce the same thing to you
[27:45] you will realize that you were born Sons
[27:48] and Daughters of God that would yield
[27:50] the Fruit of the Spirit
[27:53] but you can't do it out there in the
[27:55] courts you've got to do any dare
[27:57] on the inside hid away
[28:01] the man out the course he walked by
[28:03] daylight
[28:04] some days it was like this raining other
[28:07] days it was Gonna Shine the night time
[28:10] to be dark and stormy he had his ups and
[28:12] downs that's where you see people oh
[28:14] they say we're healing the good man of
[28:16] God that's right
[28:19] but where are they living
[28:21] they're living out there eating it in an
[28:23] atmosphere that they should not eat it
[28:25] in
[28:26] the next man he had another life that's
[28:28] not the owner he replaced by seven
[28:31] golden candlesticks some little lamb
[28:33] and sometimes I'm Lance burnt low and
[28:37] they smoked up the chimneys and you know
[28:39] how it went the smokes and go down
[28:42] and a man who comes to the place where
[28:44] he comes into the church how the courts
[28:46] out of just the lukewarm church member
[28:48] and comes up to live a pretty good New
[28:50] Life In Christ he's separates and things
[28:53] from us but he's still living under
[28:55] lights that will get damn and smoke up
[28:58] and artificial lines
[29:00] but when he once walked in behind that
[29:03] whole list of holies
[29:06] walked into the presence of God and the
[29:08] failed falls behind him there's a power
[29:11] man or he can eat every day every hour
[29:14] of the week
[29:16] there's where he's living in the
[29:18] Shekinah Glory or nearly interlocked
[29:20] wings of the Germans the great Pillar of
[29:22] Fire and the Shekinah rested there and
[29:24] he's living under there he can't be
[29:27] nothing but a real genuine Christian
[29:29] anytime
[29:35] men and women who live in there are
[29:36] misunderstood
[29:38] you see it
[29:40] they become peculiar they don't hear the
[29:43] things of the world if they do they
[29:45] don't pay attention to it
[29:46] they just move on
[29:49] God never put that in there for nothing
[29:53] God never comes for just any haphazard
[29:55] way
[29:56] prayer is not a uh perhaps
[30:00] prayer is a sincere thing
[30:03] prayer is talking to God
[30:06] prayer is not get down shut your eyes
[30:08] and think about your washing or your
[30:10] work you're doing said Lord help me and
[30:12] John and you'll Miss Jones and so forth
[30:14] that's not prayer
[30:16] that's repeating some words
[30:18] the prayer is to come into an atmosphere
[30:22] where you realize that you're in the
[30:25] presence of God
[30:27] and you're moving to them in the deepest
[30:31] of sincerity
[30:33] first it's a worship
[30:35] oh Jehovah how I love you
[30:39] is it
[30:41] then after the worship of prayer then
[30:44] you come with a sincere heart asking if
[30:48] ye abide in me
[30:51] not to laugh behind the curtains in the
[30:53] world today and run around try to get
[30:55] back in the curtains tonight
[30:56] if ye abide in me
[31:00] my words abide in you
[31:03] otherwise if you're like Aaron's rod
[31:06] that's pulled up to the Shekinah Glory
[31:08] by the golden pop of manner where you
[31:11] can eat at any time and your soul is
[31:14] refreshed and blooming nearly
[31:17] abide
[31:19] if you abide me
[31:22] my words abide in you that's what you
[31:25] will
[31:26] be given to you
[31:28] the Sea of failures of the church
[31:31] the Pentecostal Church the Methodist the
[31:34] Baptist and all it's a failing to that
[31:38] abiding grace of God
[31:41] the night you shouty clap your hands and
[31:44] dance in the aisle speak in tongues
[31:47] that's gifts
[31:49] gifts is no good unless you're abiding
[31:51] in the Shekinah Glory
[31:54] those things are fine I have nothing to
[31:56] say against them they're of God
[31:58] shouting and blessing God's wonderful
[32:00] speaking in tongues or translation of
[32:03] tongues or I mean interpretation of
[32:05] tongues it's the same but uh and all
[32:08] these other things Gifts of healing
[32:10] prophecies all these things are
[32:13] marvelous but they're no good
[32:16] they're not fruitful they can't yield
[32:19] the right unless you're living in the
[32:22] presence of the Chicago
[32:23] [Music]
[32:24] the atmosphere around you Jesus Godly
[32:28] that's the reason that men and women are
[32:30] not permitted to these things
[32:33] because you'd go out here and call a
[32:35] blessing over something God had cursed
[32:37] or or cursed out and God had blessed
[32:41] it's a fighting presence to know the
[32:45] will of God
[32:47] then don't look what the world's going
[32:49] to say about you it's what God thinks
[32:51] about you
[32:52] then you're living in his presence
[33:00] oh praise God praise God then you are
[33:03] living in this process you appreciate
[33:04] that word tonight
[33:05] so God is not just talking about us
[33:08] feeding on the word but feeding on the
[33:10] word in an atmosphere and what does it
[33:13] take by in the night Conformity to the
[33:15] will of God in thought and purpose and
[33:18] in action you have to begin to receive
[33:21] and absorb the thoughts of God speak the
[33:23] word of God and then act upon it let us
[33:25] borrow heads and let us pray father God
[33:28] I thank you tonight for this word and
[33:30] Jew season Lord abide in your presence
[33:32] when I pray to become a living reality
[33:34] tonight as from the description we read
[33:36] May the angel of his present School Lord
[33:39] and visit the people tonight and we know
[33:41] the manifestation of the holy spirit is
[33:43] that angel so may this great Holy Spirit
[33:46] visit every heart here tonight visit him
[33:48] in prayer he and answer their prayer and
[33:51] filament the Holy Ghost In Jesus
[33:53] amen and amen since God bless you and as
[33:57] we get on in prayer you think about it
[33:59] there's no way around it we have to get
[34:02] into God's presence and wait and t idea
[34:07] so may you have a great time and pray
[34:09] tonight as we get on in prayer praise
[34:11] the Lord
