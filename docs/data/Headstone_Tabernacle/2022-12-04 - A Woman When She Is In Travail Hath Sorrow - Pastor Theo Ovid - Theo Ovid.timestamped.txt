[48:24] anointed and inspired a heart as we wait
[48:27] on you and Jason we ask a demon
[48:30] do you have your seats are like there's
[48:32] in one portion of scripture from Saint
[48:33] John chapter 16 I want to read from
[48:36] verse 16 to 31.
[48:39] praise the Lord
[48:43] it's in job 16.
[48:45] uh 16. a little while this Jesus speaks
[48:48] a little while and he shall not see me
[48:50] and again you shall see me because I go
[48:53] to the father
[48:54] then said some of the disciples among
[48:57] themselves what is this that he said
[48:58] unto us a little while he shall not see
[49:01] me and again a little while you shall
[49:03] see me and because I go to the father
[49:05] they said therefore what is this that he
[49:08] said a little while
[49:09] you cannot tell what he said
[49:11] now Jesus knew that they would desire us
[49:14] to ask him
[49:15] and said unto them do you inquire among
[49:18] yourselves of what I said a little while
[49:21] he shall not see me and again a little
[49:22] while you shall see me verily Vera
[49:25] license to you that you shall weep and
[49:26] Lament
[49:27] the world shall rejoice
[49:29] you shall be sorrowful but your soul
[49:32] shall be turned into Joy
[49:34] a woman when she's in trouble had sorrow
[49:36] because her all is come but as soon as
[49:40] she is delivered of the child she
[49:42] remembered no more the anguish for joy
[49:45] that a man is born
[49:46] into the world ye no therefore have
[49:49] sorrow but I will see you again and your
[49:51] heart shall rejoice and your joy no man
[49:53] take it from you in that day you shall
[49:56] ask me nothing like verily I said to you
[49:58] whatsoever you shall ask the father in
[50:00] my name he will give it to you hitherto
[50:03] have you asked nothing in my name ask
[50:05] and you shall receive that your joy may
[50:08] be full these things have I spoken to
[50:10] you in Proverbs but the time commit when
[50:13] I shall no more speak unto you in
[50:15] Proverbs I shall show you plainly of the
[50:18] father at that day he shall ask in my
[50:21] name I see not unto you that I will pray
[50:23] the father for you for the father
[50:25] himself loveth you and because you have
[50:28] loved me and have believed that I came
[50:31] out from God I came forth from the
[50:34] father and I'm coming to the will again
[50:36] I leave the world and go to the father
[50:38] disciples tells him low no speakers
[50:41] doubt cleanly and speakers no proverb
[50:44] now are we sure that those all things
[50:47] and it is not that any man should ask
[50:49] thee by this we believe that thou came a
[50:53] sword from God Jesus answered them
[50:55] you now believe
[50:57] may God bless us what you may be seated
[50:59] o praise the name of the Lord blessed be
[51:02] the name of the Lord so we're going to
[51:04] see what the Lord will do this morning
[51:06] we are so grateful to be in the house of
[51:08] God to be in his presence where we could
[51:11] hear this word amen this word that came
[51:14] from a 20th century Prophet where we
[51:17] could hear Dusty of the lord it's not
[51:19] something okay let's go
[51:22] put around
[51:23] they were divided in three different
[51:25] groups with three different opinions
[51:28] some of them believed him
[51:30] some of them hated him and some of them
[51:34] didn't know what to do
[51:36] and that's the way we got it Believers
[51:39] make believers
[51:41] unbelievers them tree in the groups now
[51:44] we can go back and prove that's the
[51:47] state of people always they have always
[51:50] been in that kind of condition
[51:52] then seeing that it's always been that
[51:54] way it makes us prone to believe that
[51:57] God
[51:58] designed people to be that way he will
[52:01] make his enemy to praise him
[52:03] Paul Wooten in eight of chapter of
[52:06] Romans o foolish man can decrease it to
[52:09] the Potter what makes us thus does he
[52:11] have power does he have power to make
[52:13] one vessel to honor and another to this
[52:16] honor what if he had made no night you
[52:20] will never appreciate the sunshine if
[52:22] all sunshine you would have never know
[52:24] to appreciate it but and if there's no
[52:27] sickness you will never appreciate good
[52:29] health what if there was no evil people
[52:32] no evil woman a good woman would
[52:34] wouldn't be honored honor wouldn't
[52:36] belong to her cause is just that way
[52:38] it's a flat thing but it's the law of
[52:42] contrast
[52:43] he call it a law a law of contrast God
[52:47] made it dust want to be dishonorable to
[52:50] show up The Honorable one so so to be
[52:53] far wrong it shows up watch there cannot
[52:56] be a bogus dollar until there's a real
[52:58] dollar if it was just book us to begin
[53:01] with there wouldn't be a real one it's a
[53:03] copy they cannot they cannot be sinned
[53:06] until there is righteousness because
[53:08] righteousness is the right thing and sin
[53:11] is the provision of righteousness in
[53:14] other words truth is a truth a lie can't
[53:17] be a lie until it's a truth first to
[53:20] pervert that truth into a lie so sin is
[53:24] nothing but righteousness perverted so
[53:26] we know that the day the Devil is a
[53:28] pervertor or he lives in provision God
[53:31] is the original isn't that right
[53:34] two systems one of them is the right
[53:37] system and the other is a perverted
[53:39] system one of them is God's word which
[53:42] is right and every man word is a lie and
[53:45] this denominational system we got today
[53:47] forming a welcome to the churches to
[53:49] make the mark of the beast to emerge
[53:51] them together is the wrong thing and man
[53:54] are blindly walking into it God don't
[53:57] put the thing on Earth for them to be
[53:59] delivered by but they think is a bunch
[54:01] of fanaticism Oh Glory to God the things
[54:04] that God put in a normal ordinary no no
[54:06] no without screaming with it it have
[54:08] shouting in it it have messy things with
[54:11] it oh praise God they call it fanaticism
[54:13] praise God because it's not the normal
[54:15] praise God is not the ordinary and God
[54:18] have to bring something to rock you and
[54:21] Shake you up to the humanistic realm out
[54:23] of the Trinidad realm out of the natural
[54:26] realm God have to bring stuff around you
[54:28] to rock your world oh blessed be the
[54:31] name of the Lord oh do you believe that
[54:34] politics watch you see for instance you
[54:37] see if people designed to be in three
[54:39] classes let's take politics there are
[54:41] some that's red hot fireman another
[54:43] group hates him another group don't know
[54:45] what to do about him they don't know
[54:47] which it throws them into confusion this
[54:50] man he's a great man he'll make us a
[54:52] great president the other one said he's
[54:54] nothing but a renegade then the
[54:55] in-between said I don't know what to do
[54:57] see we are designed that way we are made
[55:01] up that way that's the way human beings
[55:03] are it had to be that way to fulfill
[55:07] God's Great economy and to make his
[55:10] achievement that he's going to achieve
[55:12] upon the Earth man had to be designed us
[55:15] isn't that right no the man in between
[55:19] is a bad place because one can show the
[55:22] matter what he thinks is right the other
[55:24] one can show he thinks it's wrong but
[55:26] the one in between don't know nothing
[55:27] about the matter he don't know which way
[55:30] to turn and that's just the way it is in
[55:32] religion people do the same same thing
[55:34] today about the Eternal destination so
[55:37] you don't want to be the one in between
[55:38] you don't want to mess with money in
[55:40] between are they a hot or you're cold in
[55:43] between is lukewarm could we give the
[55:44] Lord a shout in the house is either a
[55:47] heart or your cold if you're cool you're

[56:03] deserve halfway Oh Glory to God he need
[56:05] you to go all the way is that a heart or
[56:08] your cold oh praise God Mr in between
[56:10] reject that because that's what happened
[56:13] in the early church they fell from the
[56:15] fire they fell from the glory and they
[56:17] end up into lukewarm what kind of
[56:19] Christian are you today praise God you

[57:23] theologians push something down your
[57:25] throat that will send you a Million
[57:27] Lives of God and God over it man shall
[57:31] leave my bread alone but by every word
[57:33] that proceeds out of the Mount of God
[57:35] it's a chain that your soul is hanging
[57:37] over hell with and if you had taken a
[57:40] spider in your soup you shouldn't take
[57:42] no crap no false Doctrine or pitching or

[58:08] you have to know which is written it has
[58:11] to be by the Scriptures it has to be by
[58:13] the revealed word praise God because the
[58:16] scriptures is the absolute not part of
[58:18] Branham the scriptures praise God
[58:20] because he is subject to the scriptures
[58:22] that's why when the angel came to him he
[58:24] went back in the Bible to see if the
[58:26] angel is talking what the scriptures say
[58:28] why because he says if an angel cut from
[58:31] heaven and preach any other gospel let
[58:34] him be a curse Give the Lord a shout
[58:36] glory to God we have followed our man we

[59:02] that your soul
[59:04] is hanging over hell with
[59:06] a chain is best at its weakest link
[59:09] one link to break break one of them the
[59:12] rest of them let loose with it this one
[59:15] is strong as his weakest link and if a
[59:17] person that knows if they eat that
[59:18] stupid or poison spies in it make you
[59:20] sick you have to go to the hospital you
[59:22] have to have your stomach pump out on
[59:24] the trouble to go through it will
[59:25] actually kill you why you would never go
[59:28] wrong a place like that you would never
[59:30] want to darken that door again because
[59:32] you're afraid you'll get poisoned and
[59:34] die and when you absolutely join up and
[59:37] put your names on books and fight for
[59:39] every cause of the thing that the Bible
[59:41] said is not damning your body it was
[59:43] sending your soul to hell he said don't
[59:45] add to it don't take away from it he
[59:48] knew in this intellectual age like manga

[1:02:36] my God this message is so powerful
[1:02:40] he said the reason
[1:02:48] reason

[1:02:52] could hear from God
[1:02:54] and not theologian
[1:02:56] no message Pope nobody
[1:02:59] could tell the man what to do because
[1:03:02] hearing from God
[1:03:04] and that's why God love he said the
[1:03:06] reason like the Baptist Church is
[1:03:08] because the Baptist believes in the
[1:03:10] serenity of the local church you see if
[1:03:13] they do believe it is Affinity of local
[1:03:14] church you need Bishop so and so you
[1:03:16] need us Bishop so and so and you need Mr

[1:09:07] for Buddies
[1:09:09] [Music]
[1:09:09] [Applause]
[1:09:15] so this message doesn't come to a group
[1:09:18] I want to remind you of that
[1:09:20] I know we hear it but somehow it got
[1:09:23] distracted
[1:09:25] when they strike the people they
[1:09:26] recognize their might not passively
[1:09:28] pulpit as I told you already I have one
[1:09:30] wife one woman her name is
[1:09:34] you know my wife
[1:09:36] when the prophecy you know the Church of
[1:09:37] the wife is to talk about a certain
[1:09:38] context
[1:09:41] what I live in you
[1:09:45] one wife
[1:09:47] is on me of it
[1:09:49] you have to be wife of lamb
[1:09:53] not Pastor wife wife of the Lamb
[1:09:56] and the wife of the Lamb will be flesh
[1:09:58] of his flesh
[1:09:59] all of his bone
[1:10:01] love his word
[1:10:02] of his spirit
[1:10:04] that's what God wants you
[1:10:06] oh my God
[1:10:09] [Music]
[1:10:10] so there are two systems working
[1:10:13] listen recluse
[1:10:15] I want you to see
[1:10:18] I want to see if you're going to see
[1:10:20] Amen on this
[1:10:23] so he's pumpingly
[1:10:26] he said there are two systems working in
[1:10:28] tradable today I'm going to get this off
[1:10:30] my shoulder and I have it over with we
[1:10:33] all know that's the word of God and the
[1:10:36] denominational system
[1:10:38] so a system spirit
[1:10:40] is what always challenges the word
[1:10:43] well you know brother so I said he's in
[1:10:46] it so I don't care
[1:10:49] he could be sending in your own place
[1:10:51] what does the word say
[1:10:53] that is all you can find me a word
[1:10:55] you'll find it hush him out
[1:10:57] tell your story walking I don't want to
[1:10:59] hear you what you're saying in the
[1:11:01] descriptions
[1:11:04] what
[1:11:06] he said we all know that's the word of
[1:11:09] God and the national system there are
[1:11:12] two systems at work just as Jacob and
[1:11:14] Esau won after the spirit
[1:11:18] the other after the flesh what is it
[1:11:21] Eastern Jacob are fighting in the womb
[1:11:24] of the mother even to the time they are
[1:11:27] born and so is the nominationals and the
[1:11:30] word fighting won against the other
[1:11:33] then he says they have been since Luther
[1:11:36] first brought the First Reformation I'll
[1:11:38] go back simple enough to understand so
[1:11:40] in other words God
[1:11:42] always have an original Sea church
[1:11:45] but Lucifer have to anoint the flesh
[1:11:48] church members I must say this way God
[1:11:51] have a bright Sea church
[1:11:53] and that bright Sea church is in the
[1:11:55] church womb
[1:11:56] and in that church where his two Spirits
[1:11:58] were Kenyan there's two systems and two
[1:12:01] Spirits as he's working now if you look
[1:12:03] at deeper there's two things working in
[1:12:05] you too
[1:12:14] wanna feed
[1:12:18] say if you want to boost the black dog
[1:12:19] feed him
[1:12:22] but if you starve him he will die
[1:12:24] I said stop that dog
[1:12:27] stop that that woman said myself you
[1:12:28] know stab that dog
[1:12:30] [Applause]
[1:12:33] he said it this way you get the Holy
[1:12:35] Ghost it's a little light a button
[1:12:37] coming to you and as you dial to this as
[1:12:40] you let go this it expands
[1:12:42] so if you want to sell it I'd like to go
[1:12:44] sell a little light
[1:12:46] but if you wanted to take over the whole
[1:12:47] being you have to get rid of stuff
[1:12:49] you have to throw out stuff you have to
[1:12:52] shake off stuff and then that light
[1:12:54] begins to grow then it can go down to
[1:12:56] your hands to your feet the anointed of
[1:12:57] God to your eyes you see like God is
[1:13:00] here like God more glory to God a real
[1:13:04] Son of God because that light is not
[1:13:06] going inside of you that have nothing to
[1:13:08] do with your father your mother your
[1:13:10] sister your brother your uncle your aunt
[1:13:12] or the pastor okay the Lord some praises

[1:13:23] you without asking anybody who could
[1:13:25] cleans you without without asking
[1:13:26] anybody God can finally without asking
[1:13:28] anybody you God don't need anybody as
[1:13:30] approval all glory to confirmed to
[1:13:33] vindicate the Blessed anoint to inspire
[1:13:35] don't get me started this morning come
[1:13:37] on lift your feet this morning believe

[1:14:16] and I know he loves equipment he was
[1:14:19] a cheap man copying man
[1:14:21] I could always call upon him and ask him
[1:14:23] when did I preach this you can find a
[1:14:25] message and they said he could find it
[1:14:27] he was just like a
[1:14:29] Julia
[1:14:30] a Ministry of archive affairs
[1:14:33] with all equipment he said but you know
[1:14:36] I have no reserved for these things no
[1:14:37] more
[1:14:38] what's going on there
[1:14:40] he's leaving
[1:14:42] we want to carry the fridge your stuff
[1:14:45] that nice fine cheers
[1:14:47] you close the shoes you're washing that

[1:14:55] that's your desire but when you're
[1:14:56] leaving where your shoes going
[1:15:01] nothing we're fighting for isn't worth
[1:15:04] it you know
[1:15:06] covet not this Wolverine Richard
[1:15:09] that soon rapidly decay
[1:15:11] seat again the Heavenly Treasures
[1:15:14] dead but never possibly my brother home
[1:15:18] to God's unchanging her hi Lord my
[1:15:21] sister all to God's son changing hand
[1:15:26] you must build your hopes and things he
[1:15:30] turned now go there hold to God's
[1:15:35] unchanging hands
[1:15:37] yeah
[1:15:38] Glory
[1:15:40] in the service we had yesterday
[1:15:42] oh my sister Wendy
[1:15:44] football Riemann
[1:15:46] I read the scripture about David
[1:15:48] oh David called his son Solomon I said
[1:15:50] Solomon I go to the way of all the Earth
[1:15:54] show yourself a man
[1:15:59] are going but there's a house that have
[1:16:01] to build
[1:16:04] God wanted magnificent
[1:16:07] God wanted glorious I've already plans
[1:16:10] fed I have all the descriptions of what
[1:16:13] we're supposed to be built David and all
[1:16:15] the architectural joins God just wanted
[1:16:18] a man to execute what was already
[1:16:20] unfolded
[1:16:25] he said I had this upon my heart but God
[1:16:27] tell me I'm too bloody
[1:16:29] his uncle give me a son Solomon
[1:16:32] to build this house
[1:16:34] and when Davis had to talk to his son
[1:16:36] are like that he said a given goal a
[1:16:38] given this I gave him that out of my own
[1:16:39] personal Bounty above and beyond to make
[1:16:42] sure this is done but for uses work you
[1:16:45] have to continue to serve God
[1:16:46] if you don't he will do this he will do
[1:16:49] that so not because the name is Solomon
[1:16:51] not because you are my son not because
[1:16:53] you know what you have to do you can
[1:16:54] just do your own thing you have to
[1:16:56] continue
[1:16:57] Give the Lord a shout in the house
[1:17:00] he exhorted the sun to continue to save
[1:17:03] the Lord
[1:17:04] with all his heart and God he says says
[1:17:07] he reigns at the heart he said God has
[1:17:09] no so you can fool him because he
[1:17:11] doesn't know the intent of your heart
[1:17:13] Solomon tell all that David tell all
[1:17:16] that to Solomon so if they think you go
[1:17:17] Milky Way through this thing that can't
[1:17:19] work because God has locked me on your
[1:17:21] mouth and see what's inside your heart
[1:17:23] that's why you can say David is a man
[1:17:25] after my own give a lot some praises
[1:17:29] today
[1:17:29] [Applause]
[1:17:30] [Music]

[1:18:11] here stop there you know people stop
[1:18:14] there to make it appear as if we're
[1:18:16] talking nonsense

[1:46:07] Mighty rough Twinkie Rebels
[1:46:10] he had all showing off
[1:46:12] your power go to wait we do that for
[1:46:15] eign
[1:46:38] but God said this morning speak to the
[1:46:41] Rock in your wilderness and he will
[1:46:44] bring forth his Waters or give the Lord
[1:46:46] some Praises this morning because she
[1:46:48] said holy spirit
[1:46:52] [Applause]
[1:46:54] [Music]
[1:46:54] [Applause]
[1:46:55] Rock will bring forth water is so glory
[1:46:58] to God they are brought in the same
[1:46:59] field watered by the same water same
[1:47:02] sunlight one is the word and one is not
[1:47:04] the word and the two are fighting go
[1:47:06] glory to God so don't tell me who fight
[1:47:08] and fight them the other fight
[1:47:10] I bought the fight
[1:47:11] but I'm the boat right I'm on the boat
[1:47:14] right side
[1:47:15] Hallelujah so who fighted me that the
[1:47:18] fact that I figured which side they won
[1:47:19] oh praise the name of the Lord put
[1:47:21] Abraham you could imagine how you have
[1:47:24] lived back in those days under the
[1:47:26] jolting of God's prophets and words that
[1:47:28] come forward what side would you want to
[1:47:30] be in Bhatia he said she's fixing to
[1:47:32] bring forth the perfect word bacteria
[1:47:35] and the word is coming for a word brain
[1:47:39] he said I believe that Jesus here was
[1:47:41] speaking you would have sorrow but your
[1:47:43] soul shall return to Joy speaking to
[1:47:45] disciples here knowing that birth of
[1:47:47] Christianity was coming to existence and
[1:47:49] the old has to die
[1:47:51] in order for the new to be born
[1:47:54] so David Gohan knew that Solomon
[1:47:56] Ministry was about to start big time to
[1:47:59] do something Great and Mighty for God in
[1:48:01] building the Temple
[1:48:03] God knew that he needed a man that could
[1:48:06] be negotiation that could negotiate and
[1:48:09] talk to other people because what
[1:48:11] Solomon knew was some different
[1:48:12] countries
[1:48:15] the material he needed to put the temple
[1:48:17] together he didn't have all of the deer
[1:48:21] Ministry you know he in trouble he had
[1:48:23] mental problems because he don't want to
[1:48:25] admit that he do have it all
[1:48:27] so to solve his problem he just surveyed
[1:48:28] himself and say I'm all five
[1:48:31] so I don't need nobody else and we don't
[1:48:33] I'd say we don't need nobody else
[1:48:35] we are so blessed to have faith in one
[1:48:38] God gave you a five and one
[1:48:40] you see God doesn't work that way
[1:48:42] God make sure we are interdependent
[1:48:46] and we are dependent on him
[1:48:48] and we have to recognize that God have
[1:48:50] other souls and seeds and ministers and
[1:48:53] preachers and Ministries in the vineyard
[1:48:55] for the edification of the church so he
[1:48:57] said you hear from the Apostle you hear
[1:49:00] from the pastor you hear from the
[1:49:01] prophet no Apostle come and take over
[1:49:03] that's some false Apostles looking to
[1:49:05] take over
[1:49:06] foreign
[1:49:13] politicians
[1:49:15] they're in the wrong post
[1:49:18] all right now here
[1:49:20] he said now watch
[1:49:22] Jesus said you will have sorrow but your
[1:49:24] soul shall be done to Joy speaking to
[1:49:26] disciples here knowing that the birth of
[1:49:28] Christianity was coming to existence no
[1:49:30] the old
[1:49:31] has to die
[1:49:33] in order for the new to born
[1:49:36] to have anything that gives birth here
[1:49:37] we go anything that gives birth has to
[1:49:41] have Pains of distress
[1:49:44] and they certainly was going through the
[1:49:47] pain of distress and anguish to get from
[1:49:49] the Lord to Grace
[1:49:51] because they had the law it was
[1:49:53] indoctrinated with the law there was a
[1:49:55] doctrination with the law of Moses Moses
[1:49:57] said Moses say Moses and they want to
[1:50:00] get Jesus to break the law they caught
[1:50:03] the woman in very Act of adultery and
[1:50:04] said Moses say this woman we quarter
[1:50:07] this is live now this is
[1:50:09] she shall be stoned
[1:50:12] and they're watching Jesus see how he
[1:50:14] handled it he said no problem
[1:50:16] turn this back from them writing his son
[1:50:18] he said which one among you caused the
[1:50:19] first stone
[1:50:20] and let them think about it
[1:50:22] all of a sudden somebody really think
[1:50:23] that they had a child to pick up from
[1:50:25] school next one have rights to pick up
[1:50:26] next one have to paint and wash his car
[1:50:28] and next one have to go to the grocery
[1:50:30] because you know and everybody excuse me
[1:50:32] uh you know they do like they hear that
[1:50:35] all them with it which of you without
[1:50:37] sin they might want to confess this sin
[1:50:39] they want to acknowledge this sin
[1:50:40] they're walking with this sin they
[1:50:41] connect the jacket and they pull it
[1:50:43] outside
[1:50:48] when Jesus surveyed there was a woman
[1:50:51] standing there she didn't even see when
[1:50:53] they left
[1:50:54] you say woman where are they an accusers
[1:50:56] no looking at it not my Lord he's in
[1:50:59] neither
[1:51:01] do I condemn thee and he had no sense
[1:51:04] go
[1:51:07] and continue sinning
[1:51:09] because I forgive you
[1:51:11] did not say that that's not in the Bible
[1:51:13] he said go
[1:51:15] and sin no more
[1:51:17] free yourself from that Oh Glory to God
[1:51:20] if God free you this night go and sin no
[1:51:22] more
[1:51:23] free yourself from the past free
[1:51:24] yourself from that go on say no more she
[1:51:27] was free it's not something there
[1:51:29] all right so the battle there was to get
[1:51:31] them from law to Greece all right normal
[1:51:34] natural boot Spirit type spiritual birth
[1:51:37] we find out on the ground we see tree in
[1:51:39] the earth growing struggling for life
[1:51:42] struggling for what
[1:51:43] that goes to show there's a tree
[1:51:45] somewhere that doesn't die it's crying
[1:51:47] for something we find people no matter

[1:52:29] have blood without spirit
[1:52:30] he said you could have blood
[1:52:32] without spirit so you can have the
[1:52:35] message without spirit because the
[1:52:37] message is blood but we are saying the
[1:52:39] token the seven Thunders the Holy Ghost

[1:58:53] Glory record is the transition had to
[1:58:56] take place from the old to the new it

[1:59:00] grace of God you've got to come to walk
[1:59:01] before me and be not perfect they glory
[1:59:04] to God how something has to happen
[1:59:05] something has to unfold
[1:59:08] [Applause]
[1:59:10] a woman interview the first thing comes
[1:59:13] is water normal second thing is blood
[1:59:16] then come Life water blood spirit that
[1:59:19] constitute the normal bird and so it is
[1:59:22] in a spiritual realm it is water
[1:59:23] justification by feet Believing on God
[1:59:26] and second is sanification of the spirit
[1:59:28] God cleanses the spirit from all the
[1:59:30] elements of the world and the desire of
[1:59:32] the world then the Holy Spirit comes in
[1:59:34] and give new boot and fills up that
[1:59:37] Sanctified vessel the Greek word is
[1:59:40] sanctifies a compound which means
[1:59:41] cleansed and set aside for service not
[1:59:44] just cleansed but set aside for service
[1:59:47] power coming to put you into service now
[1:59:50] watch what is them when they become by
[1:59:54] still but no song no emotion dead baby
[1:59:57] and sometimes the matter with the church
[1:59:58] today we got too much stillborn children
[2:00:00] they need that gospel spanking baby
[2:00:03] upside down and put a big lash on the
[2:00:05] baby
[2:00:07] knowing my college I love you I don't
[2:00:09] know
[2:00:10] sustainable kind of all kind of thing no
[2:00:12] but alas in that baby and the baby ball
[2:00:15] they ball them big big noise isn't that
[2:00:17] right and it's all about the breeding
[2:00:19] Breath of Life into them we find out
[2:00:21] it's true theology but it's the truth in
[2:00:23] the seeds birth the old seed must die
[2:00:26] before the new one can be born therefore
[2:00:28] death is hard anytime
[2:00:30] that is what somebody should have had
[2:00:34] so you are soft dead
[2:00:36] that is hard
[2:00:38] dietary own thinking well I feel better
[2:00:40] to you you should have more so that's
[2:00:42] your feelings are you gonna die to that
[2:00:43] you hold on your feelings but you're
[2:00:45] wrong he should not see you do it so he
[2:00:47] should do it so guys tell your thoughts
[2:00:51] you caught up your own emotions
[2:00:54] they said I was telling them when you're
[2:00:55] under stress and pressure do talk
[2:00:57] zip up
[2:00:58] keep quiet
[2:01:02] and I was saying that in reference to
[2:01:04] job's wife who tell him why because God
[2:01:06] and die
[2:01:08] she just say that because she she under
[2:01:10] pressure
[2:01:12] because if job admired a wicked woman he
[2:01:14] examined resentment all together in that
[2:01:16] sense
[2:01:16] he said those speakers like
[2:01:19] a foolish woman I know you're not
[2:01:21] foolish
[2:01:23] that what he's saying you know I know
[2:01:25] you're not a foolish woman I know you're
[2:01:27] under pressure I forgive you I still
[2:01:29] love you
[2:01:31] now be caution of precious he said that
[2:01:34] um
[2:01:45] but that's the challenge that was
[2:01:46] presented to the god I will make him
[2:01:49] curse
[2:01:51] and his wife was the tool the final the
[2:01:54] last round the last thing he could get
[2:01:56] was his wife and that man had the grace
[2:01:58] on him to see you speak like he's a
[2:02:01] Christian he's a Believer he was not
[2:02:03] just member it was actually if it wasn't
[2:02:06] a Christian let me tell her you Wicked
[2:02:08] Woman only money again you're driving me
[2:02:10] car Billy a house look at your no you're
[2:02:13] gone grateful and Rich I should have
[2:02:15] never mind the first place and our next
[2:02:17] Guild Army Road Academia instead look at
[2:02:20] you now when I've seen pressure
[2:02:25] foreign
[2:02:35] oh give the Lord some praises
[2:02:38] hallelujah hallelujah that's why I say
[2:02:40] when you're under pressure when you're
[2:02:41] under stressed zip up don't say nothing
[2:02:43] say Lord help me keep my mouth closed
[2:02:45] because you don't want to say the wrong
[2:02:47] thing you want to say the right thing oh
[2:02:49] glory to God do it Go glory to God give
[2:02:51] the Lord some Praises hope this helping
[2:02:54] somebody so that is hard at any time
[2:02:56] that is painful it is distressful and
[2:03:00] birth is the same you are bringing life
[2:03:02] into the world and it is painful a woman
[2:03:06] when she's about to bring forth she had
[2:03:07] much travail Oh Glory to God she has
[2:03:10] much sorrow but when she bring forth Joy
[2:03:13] comes because a man comes to this world
[2:03:15] and this bride is going through a
[2:03:17] travail she's going to bring forth the
[2:03:19] Christ okay the Lord some Praises
[2:03:20] Messiah gonna be on earth identified Oh
[2:03:24] Glory to God is a messiah is on earth
[2:03:26] now that's the Christmas message that's
[2:03:29] the message the Angels Came to bring her
[2:03:31] that's the angel so the Angels Came to
[2:03:33] Herald that the Messiah is on earth now
[2:03:36] or give the Lord some praises glory to
[2:03:39] God
[2:03:40] [Applause]
[2:03:43] that's the reason was so hard for those
[2:03:45] Pharisees to understand our Lord Jesus
[2:03:46] Christ because they were under the law
[2:03:48] and the law was the word of God in
[2:03:51] form what a powerful quote
[2:03:54] the law was the word in seed form but
[2:03:59] when the word was made flesh
[2:04:02] and become not law but Grace
[2:04:05] yet a bomb
[2:04:06] no Grace and law cannot exist at the
[2:04:09] same time
[2:04:12] this is beginner you can't have both
[2:04:19] that's why Jesus could tell her we had
[2:04:21] an accusers
[2:04:22] yes go and say no more
[2:04:24] I release you the Lord say you should be
[2:04:27] stoned but Grace come and release you
[2:04:30] from your guilt your past your shame
[2:04:33] it cannot be bought
[2:04:35] it cannot be locked up and release at
[2:04:37] the same time
[2:04:41] let's continue
[2:04:43] now Grace and law cannot exist at the
[2:04:46] same time
[2:04:47] cause Grace is so far above law law is
[2:04:51] not even the picture
[2:04:53] therefore it is so hard for the
[2:04:55] Pharisees to die to the law so that
[2:04:58] Grace could be born but it must go
[2:05:02] the two laws cannot exist at the same
[2:05:05] time
[2:05:07] there cannot be a law that say you can
[2:05:09] run this sick from all and the other one
[2:05:10] says you can't run it one says you can
[2:05:13] and you can't it has to be one note at a
[2:05:15] time maybe one time you could have went
[2:05:17] to it caution to it but this time it is
[2:05:19] red stop see there cannot be two laws
[2:05:22] exist at the same time notice my thought
[2:05:24] to you is this it takes
[2:05:27] I want to wrap up it takes pain
[2:05:31] distress
[2:05:32] discomfort
[2:05:34] but it must be
[2:05:36] so be comfortable being uncomfortable
[2:05:44] be comfortable that you're going to have
[2:05:46] stress and distress
[2:05:48] here we go let's continue we find a rain
[2:05:51] which brings forth fruit from the earth
[2:05:52] is born as the poor said in the thieves
[2:05:55] of thunder in a ragged jacket Skies if
[2:05:57] we didn't have thunder and and ruggage
[2:05:59] against Skies the little distilled drop
[2:06:01] of rain that's been lifted from the Seas
[2:06:03] and distilled from the salt wouldn't be
[2:06:04] born it takes lightning thunderblast
[2:06:08] ragged rugged fearful thing to bring
[2:06:11] forth this soft petal drops of water
[2:06:13] it takes pain to bring forth birth it
[2:06:16] takes dying and as the clouds die rain
[2:06:18] is born because rain is part of that
[2:06:21] cloud one has to cease so the other one
[2:06:23] can exist
[2:06:26] like a little chicken back there you
[2:06:28] talk about your own inner parts of the
[2:06:30] egg has to rot away it has to he's
[2:06:32] saying Kentucky we call it pipping its
[2:06:34] way out he said pipping his way out they
[2:06:36] never found a better way it's God's
[2:06:38] provided we you try to help them you
[2:06:40] will kill him tip the shell off of him
[2:06:42] and he will die he's got to labor and
[2:06:45] strain and that is what you I want you
[2:06:47] to see for yourself that God had coming
[2:06:50] to crack the shell off for you you have
[2:06:51] to say I'm pip and pip and kick that
[2:06:54] shell and pip your way out of what

[2:16:25] in order to pay the debt of your
[2:16:28] hybriden there it is what is it that you
[2:16:32] could die to yourself
[2:16:35] top brother over it I mean this isn't a
[2:16:37] message
[2:16:37] that we have to die to ourselves
[2:16:40] you mean this is the word you mean this
[2:16:42] is a mystery
[2:16:44] hidden one because you'll hear about it
[2:16:46] right so but you bringing a kitten issue

[2:16:58] drink out of there
[2:17:00] watch this
[2:17:02] died in order to pay the debt of your
[2:17:05] hybriden that you could die yourself
[2:17:10] until you are no more yourself
[2:17:14] and be filled with his word
[2:17:16] believe in his word then the holy spirit
[2:17:20] that was in him
[2:17:22] comes down to water that word
[2:17:26] to make it grow
[2:17:29] and then the Holy Spirit wasn't him
[2:17:32] comes down to water that will to make it
[2:17:35] grow then what is it God
[2:17:38] manifested continuing the work of his
[2:17:41] full son his only begotten that died for
[2:17:45] our hybridian life that he might
[2:17:47] reconcile us back here it is to be Sons
[2:17:50] and Daughters of God here why that
[2:17:54] through the church might flow the same
[2:17:57] life

[2:18:03] that was in Christ
[2:18:05] what did the spirit of the Prophet by
[2:18:07] and through the bride will be fulfilled
[2:18:10] all because Jesus didn't finish his work
[2:18:13] so he's going to do it by and through
[2:18:15] the bride the secret is the word is in
[2:18:20] the bride she has the mind of Christ to
[2:18:23] know what to do with the world in other
[2:18:25] words she have the intelligence to tell
[2:18:28] her what to do with the word she don't
[2:18:30] need an outside force she don't need an
[2:18:32] outside group she don't need a
[2:18:33] headquarters Church she has the mind of
[2:18:36] Christ to know what to do with the word
[2:18:38] isn't that right no other life can work
[2:18:42] in her no other life had broken her she
[2:18:45] can't come to life no other way it will
[2:18:48] take the Holy Ghost itself
[2:18:49] the Holy Ghost itself in other words the
[2:18:52] Capstone the Dynamics praise God the
[2:18:55] Capstone word the Capstone of love
[2:18:57] praise God hallelujah it will take that
[2:19:00] stone to come and power that bride Oh
[2:19:03] Glory to God let's go he died and give
[2:19:06] his life that he might send the spirit
[2:19:09] and take his body up and send the spirit
[2:19:11] back to water to pay the redeeming price
[2:19:15] and he that believeth on me the works
[2:19:17] that I do then come the Holy Spirit the
[2:19:20] same word of God we're almost done here

[2:22:20] Jesus did the works of his father
[2:22:22] because the father wasn't him that is
[2:22:25] why the works was done because the
[2:22:27] father was in the sun do you believe
[2:22:28] that he was incarnate God do you believe
[2:22:30] that that God the Father which was in
[2:22:32] the father of Jesus the great spirit
[2:22:34] dwelt in the fullness of his power in
[2:22:36] Jesus Christ now what the Bible says the
[2:22:38] world was invisible now here we go the
[2:22:41] word was invisible until in his mid
[2:22:44] flesh
[2:22:45] then the wood becomes visible
[2:22:47] he had a bum hear what concerns you and
[2:22:49] I know true is sacrificial in a Calvary
[2:22:54] and his resurrection
[2:22:56] positionally plays his church in that
[2:22:58] Realm that the same invisible God could
[2:23:02] come into the individual
[2:23:05] and make the world visible
[2:23:08] oh I wish my church could get that
[2:23:11] if you could see friends this visible
[2:23:14] made visible how we do it through
[2:23:16] Caravan Resurrection he put the church
[2:23:18] in a position if we doubt ourselves we
[2:23:21] could see Jesus manifested without one
[2:23:23] floor that's not just for you that's me
[2:23:26] for us to see Jesus T don't have to die
[2:23:30] it doesn't matter what people say about
[2:23:31] me till you still have to die people
[2:23:33] don't like me that have nothing to do
[2:23:34] with it
[2:23:37] not not wanted alive or dead you know
[2:23:41] wanted dead
[2:23:43] man yeah
[2:23:52] you did another life
[2:23:55] you know
[2:23:57] Paul said I die
[2:23:59] my children whom my traveling but till
[2:24:02] Christ be formed in me
[2:24:04] Paul was dying to bring life to God's
[2:24:07] people
[2:24:09] I've always wanted to come to a church
[2:24:11] I've longed to see it I could walk in
[2:24:13] the back door front or wherever it was
[2:24:15] look across the audience and a perfect
[2:24:17] Church
[2:24:19] [Music]
[2:24:21] the spirit would call it out like a NASA
[2:24:24] is a fire out you just couldn't do it
[2:24:25] there'd be no sin in that group see the
[2:24:27] spirit will speak quickly see women men
[2:24:29] sitting there under the power of the
[2:24:31] Holy Spirit
[2:24:33] not power Mysteries talking foreign
[2:24:55] Spirit moving perfectly moving someone
[2:24:58] done something wrong on the congregation
[2:24:59] they would come quickly and confess it
[2:25:01] before they sprinkle the whole of it
[2:25:03] to come and tell it because you know
[2:25:05] it's going to be called that's the
[2:25:06] Church of the Living God all my old poor
[2:25:09] heart is getting old I've long the
[2:25:11] standards here she's like that and yet I
[2:25:13] hope to perfect works of God without sin
[2:25:16] now that could understand you see Church
[2:25:18] the word was invisible until it was made
[2:25:21] flesh and at Calvary a burial
[2:25:24] Resurrection the position only placed
[2:25:26] the church in that Realm there's got to
[2:25:28] be a debt
[2:25:29] a debt to self
[2:25:31] in this hour brother when we wonder
[2:25:33] what's the matter with our Revival
[2:25:35] what's the matter we got the material
[2:25:37] everything we got the mechanics but
[2:25:38] where's the Dynamics that's what we need
[2:25:40] to move Jesus on the scene I tell you
[2:25:42] there is one here today called the holy
[2:25:44] ghost that can touch the Dynamics he is
[2:25:48] the Dynamics of the mechanics imagine
[2:25:50] the Holy Ghost says
[2:25:53] We Stand today his Pentecostal one of
[2:25:55] the greatest churches in the nation
[2:25:55] thousand times thousands added each year
[2:25:57] but where is that Holy Ghost
[2:25:59] it's the word it's the word turn on the
[2:26:03] light turns on the mechanics and they
[2:26:05] begin Dynamics their Dynamics when the
[2:26:07] dynamic comes to the mechanic it start
[2:26:09] to think ruling
[2:26:11] take the word if there's only one little
[2:26:12] thing missed up it won't start lay aside
[2:26:15] every weight every ISM every Creed that
[2:26:17] the Dynamics the Holy Spirit might flow
[2:26:20] through the word and vindicate the
[2:26:22] promise what God Said Moses look one day
[2:26:24] he seen the pillar fire it attracted his
[2:26:26] attention the great Theologian he was to
[2:26:29] deliver the children of Israel and
[2:26:31] although his mother totally instructed
[2:26:32] him watch this on what to do what he
[2:26:35] would do what God arisma for all that
[2:26:37] was knowledge as good as it is all this
[2:26:41] knowledge as good as it is and it is
[2:26:42] good yet it had to be set off that was
[2:26:45] only mechanics so Moses head couldn't
[2:26:48] take him to fulfill the promise
[2:26:50] mechanics ain't what runs the automobile
[2:26:52] it's dynamics that runs the mechanics
[2:26:55] don't run the church it's the Dynamics
[2:26:56] the holy ghost that gets into his word
[2:26:58] the Holy Ghost will always point you to
[2:27:01] the word oh my let me hit the whole
[2:27:03] church here now he is the Dynamics of
[2:27:06] the mechanics the mechanics of the
[2:27:08] church what is it
[2:27:11] you no longer hear this good I'll be
[2:27:14] there so much let's come fresh the
[2:27:17] mechanics of the church what is it
[2:27:18] apostles
[2:27:20] prophets they don't want that now and
[2:27:22] they they don't even passes now
[2:27:27] they want us to stop preaching
[2:27:32] they want us to go foreign
[2:27:34] controlled by overseas
[2:27:36] watch the mechanics of the church could
[2:27:39] imagine
[2:27:41] is apostles
[2:27:43] it's teachers and so forth and he is the
[2:27:45] dynamic that works that
[2:27:47] [Applause]
[2:27:52] so anytime go come behind me thanks
[2:27:54] mechanics
[2:27:57] and the Dynamics you're seeing how that
[2:27:59] will work that
[2:28:01] and if God work in that now and we broke
[2:28:03] known piece of mechanics much is when
[2:28:06] God said things in order if right now
[2:28:08] God right in US
[2:28:10] and we broke down
[2:28:12] mechanic state
[2:28:14] wait till everything lying upon lying
[2:28:16] upon line we till the juice and the oil
[2:28:18] praise God without oil start to run that
[2:28:21] engine and running all them bolts and
[2:28:24] joints and whatnot the church running
[2:28:25] smooth praise not a devil moved till we
[2:28:28] say so we'll give the Lord some Praises
[2:28:30] he is the dynamic that works that it's
[2:28:33] worked by a certain dynamic or glory to
[2:28:35] God hallelujah praise God last court are
[2:28:38] you ready
[2:28:40] if you don't cut the work short he cut
[2:28:42] the workforce for the election but
[2:28:44] therefore the election he gonna cut it
[2:28:46] short now where are we at we see Nations
[2:28:49] breaking children's awaken the sign
[2:28:52] Israel Awakening the signs that this
[2:28:53] Bible wrote over this day we see the
[2:28:55] mechanical take taken place now the
[2:28:57] spirit
[2:28:58] here we go the Dynamics of that promised
[2:29:01] word to get into the church and Jive
[2:29:04] them into Calvary and turn into the
[2:29:07] Rapture so praise God praise God praise
[2:29:10] God the first title I had for that is
[2:29:12] Dynamics driven Calvary
[2:29:15] Hallelujah the Dynamics have to drive us
[2:29:19] to Calvary may God send the Dynamics
