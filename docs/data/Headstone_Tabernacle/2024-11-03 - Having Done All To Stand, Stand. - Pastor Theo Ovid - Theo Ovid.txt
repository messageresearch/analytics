of the way so I can better hear from God last night PR was better this morning the word is sharp and revealing as I read it now I'm beginning to see fasting as something that is to be desired to do rather than a judging ritual I'm beginning to be grateful for it praise God brother Kelly South giving God PR amen as you're aware having been just a Mee in Peru and a brother send this sending this report i' like to share it with you the anticipated meetings finally came and went into history with a greater glory than at first and with his testimonies of lifechanging experiences physically

brother Nelson and host Pastor Johnny Kiton met on the hotel and with brother loo they were exchanging quotes on the topic of the experience of the Holy Ghost and the the word sensation and I believe it was all in plan of God's Eternal purpose I will never forget that awesome moment when brother Gan was coming into the hotel and asked us what we were doing and when we told him we went into the floor and kneel down and with tears in his eyes he said for so long I've been looking for the answer and what has happened he receive an experience of the Holy Ghost as he was just coming into the message but the message Church he began to grow to grow don't believe in the Holy Ghost by an experience it was just like a eagle egg growing with a chicken eggs he kept that experience silent for so long until the day at the hotel he cried so much but of Happiness 10 years after we visited him he wanted us to come back and call the inspiration for the special services the visitation of the Holy Spirit the first service was Friday young Minister from veracruse Mexico spoke on preparation for the visitation of the Holy Ghost he spoke about Moses telling the people sanctify three days I will come down second service was brother Nelson leis Nelson from Toronto Canada spoke on all you need in life Journey From Here to Eternity is when you receive the Holy Ghost and there God use a gift it's

before the message was finished the heart of the people were so now in line to see the entire purpose of God how that the seed planted in people's heart need to reain the Holy Ghost to come and man

think that most men who ever do anything great for the kingdom of God stand alone did you ever think of it you have to stand by yourself Jesus stood alone all down to the ages other men who stood alone finny sanki Calvin KNX even to Abraham Lincoln that's right stood alone men who do great things men of vision men of spiritual understanding stand alone and I think that's because that Jesus had to stand alone himself now the one principle of us being here trying to help you and the only way that I know Christian friends to help you is to get your faith the best that I can by the word of God centered on the will of God for you you see that your faith centered on the will of God for you because once you see where your faith supposed to go then you recognize everything else is the devil fighting you from going where God want you to go now remember we don't hold the plan God has the plan we come to get the plan unfolded to us and when the plan unfold to us then we could act correctly now why the Bible say write the vision make it plain that he that reth may run if you read and you don't understand then you're messed up that why God tell Daniel go that way the book is sealed till the time of the end Daniel did not understand what he read but the book is sealed so they going to come unsealing of this book that we get clarity of purpose Clarity of vision to know what we have to go after what we must inherit what we must possess what we must claim what we must Proclaim what we must declare what our faith must take a hold of Give the Lord a shout and when you know what your faith must take a hold of then we could press the battle I press towards the mark of the high calling in Christ Jesus give the Lord a shout hallelujah [Applause] [Music] if you can only see that it's

you may be seated let's go there's a choosing we choose for ourselves we choose something that is for our own good Moses chose the Affliction and the disgrace that he might walk with the people of God think of it listen to it he chose the afflictions of the people of God and counted it a greater treasure for the enduring seeing him who was invisible now lot one time had to make a choice it may be this morning that there'll be men and women sitting here that'll make your final choice you are today what you are because several years ago you choose to be what you are now and what you choose now will determine what you'll be 5 years from today 5 years from today you may be a missionary 5 years from today you may be a renowned Christian or 5 years from today you may be in hell because you made the wrong decision 5 years from today you may be cleaning spatoon in a barroom 5 years from today you may be a prostitute on the street or you may be a man or woman that's a credit to any society because of your choice for Christ 5 years from today may be in glory go on in the Rapture because you made your choice today but you got to choose don't look at what you see choose what you see by faith and the only thing I will count is what you choose by faith so you are what you are by the grace of God and by the faith that works in you oh glory to God I remember young man 17 years old 16 going on 17 when I give my heart to the Lord 17 years old when I got baptized and I remember when I saw the scriptures even young men shall faint and utterly fall but they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength I say God make me a young man that will wait on you I was intentional and purposeful a young man that will wait upon him and I knew if I wait upon God he wouldn't fail he will come on time he will come through and I could confess this morning he has never failed me [Applause] yet when I saw the three things to TI a man money popularity and woman I said Lord preserve me from those three things I watch it with Haw eyes because these are Destroyer these are the tools God used Satan Satan just no no imp not impish he's not a comedian you know we laugh and we laugh and laugh Satan is no comedian he has a definite plan you know I was hearing a man give a testimony he was a former witch or warlock it's called him and he talk about the sacrifices they make to attack churches and Christians how they will sit under the moon and sit for months and and when they don't eat and they fast and they do all kind of things Spirits there are certain places the car go by at allall you because that person is praying and that praying giving an order covering over the house so when they pass in in the realm of the spirit they recognize they can't go there because prayers emanating there they testify about a pastor you have a good heart be like money they say aha we get him and they work things to get him time the realm of the mind and the realm of the heart is two different realms amen don't be confused the heart of a sense and so does the mind so sometime you could think with your mind it doesn't empower the heart there has to be a supernatural connection to get the desires of the mind to hit the heart that's why you talk about the subconscious moving behind the conscious you could think you want this this is right but your heart going wrong you want your heart to line up with your mind your mind is where the devil has used the heart is what God has influence is not the same thing oh give the Lord some Praises Hallelujah when your heart and mind line up trouble for the devil's Kingdom trouble in the enemy camp because you're coming from a genuine place of sincerity and Truth he say I desire truth from where not the mouth from the inward path oh give the Lord I shout a feeling good this morning I desire truth from where not your mou but from the inward Parts he said because these people honor me with with their mouths but their heart is far from me don't let it be so with you this morning could we get some prais inside of here don't let it be so this morning God want truth from the inward [Applause] part just about a month ago there was

whole day I like that the Prophet Daniel had been to Babylon for 68 years 608 years he kept the Victory and was undefiled before God without the baptism of the Holy Ghost think about that everybody should be everybody should be for that 68 years with the victory without the baptism of the Holy Ghost without the blood of Jesus Christ to make intercessions for him and only with the blood of bulls and goats and heers which he had to offer secretly because he was a he because of the Heathen traditions of the land he stood the test in the land of his captivity right now this land is not our land we are strangers and pilgrims here in our own land this is the land of our captivity this is the land when we are bombarded every day by everything you could think about by the music by the Witchcraft of people like Beyonce and all the other stars it have the under witchcraft anointing singing their songs pumping things to the young people give the Lord a shout in the [Applause] house lot of these people who are called Superstars they are doing rituals church members don't want to worship and and what not and these guys with all the money bowing down to Satan and doing rituals to influence the

say the woman say I forget to tell you I move she thinking the prophet lie he didn't lie she moved and the cousin didn't know or the family didn't know that she moved she move and God know exactly where she moved to every move you make there's an angel watching you every place you go there's an angel watching you oh give the Lord I shout behave yourself God is watching [Music] [Applause] you

he want you to come from Jacob Grace into J Perfection come on now he want you to to come into righteousness he want you to come into true Holiness that is God's will for your life could we he I shout in the house Hallelujah we still in the [Music] word I Daniel understood by books the number of years what book you reading our next man challenged Daniel know it's not so it's not so he said I check Jeremiah I recognize two more years left you look at where we at 19 to the3 Prophet seven Visions the prophet clearly stated the woman's vote will elect the wrong person one day now the wom now have a reason to vote because a woman is in the shadow of that throne and all who want to blow the trumpet for Trump let them keep blowing it have nothing to do with what man think or what man feel it's what God say all that dwell on the Earth shall worship the Beast and the lamb start to speak like a dragon this may be the last election America have this one here I repeat this may be the last election America has they don't even know that amen but that land called America will change so dramatically that people wouldn't recognize what it was before the lamb turned to Dragon Hallelujah think about it but brandham said they would crush the America was born off of freedom of religion all that will change why thing will shut down the churches no more freedom land free that one change is how do we as a people called out and elected in this hour prepare for what is yet to come there's Financial pressure everywhere there's pressure on Foreign Exchange there's pressure gold price going up up up up up the prophet prophesy will go to the gold standard who said that God said that and when he prophesied that they were coming off the gold standard because why for years we preach about it there has to be a change of the financial system that you can't buy or sell unless you take the mark of the be there has to be a system and I was thinking back one of the powers behind the Corona virus was that everybody was forced to go online the whole world if you're in timbuk 2 or timbuk far wherever you are everybody was forced pushed to go online not everybody could stream whether on the phone Tik Tok Facebook wherever it is everybody is a microphone everybody have a voice because the Beast system is a connected system all that dwell on the earth he has to know where all is in Europe they have a limit of cash you could use you must use card so if it's $300 cash Euro or whatever it is that's all you could use cash after that you have to use card with card the know where you go what you buy who you buy from and with the connected cars they right now they know exactly when you go by your aunt Auntie or when you go by place you're not supposed to go so everything is trackable and traceable and they could find you at any time when you put your card into ATM in France they know exactly what ATM it is and where you are all that dwell upon the Earth where you going and hide and the bush I Daniel understand my books a number of years before the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah the prophet that should be accomplished 70 years in the desolation of Jerusalem let's skip on a false prophet spoke and said Jeremiah you wrong you're going to keep Israel down there for so many years two years God smooth that false prophet and took his life that same year because God told his true Prophet there will be 70 years listen to this man Daniel you young people listen closely I want you to notice now how Daniel yet a alien outed from his people outed from his church without one church service without any church to go to without any hymns to be sng but what he sang himself in the midst of all as this he still held on to what that Prophet said could you imagine that holding on to prophetic utterance that Malachi 4 William random spoke because God is a liar God is not confused God is not oh God he's catching me is so it working out no he's the Fountain of wisdom he knew you would be in

families of the north say the Lord and Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon my servant that's how God sees him we'll bring them again in this land and against inhabitants thereof and against all the nations round about and I will utterly destroy them who's talking God that's why I say this peanut butter this chocolate cake God that people have is not the god of the Bible listen to what Propet

Jesus stood up for to read Hallelujah and Jesus went into the scroll box and the Bible was Scrolls in those days and he keep looking he keep looking and he keep looking and he find the Scrolls of the

son of man and the Holy Ghost fell in uper room who stepped forward Peter what did Peter say he said this is the stone that you Builders refuse who told him to say that God told him to say that he was confirming what the Sam said nobody who the stone the build refus he said the stone that the build refused has become The Headstone of the corner it is the Lord's doing it is marvelous in our eyes

God today when you hear his voice don't Harden your heart oh [Applause] [Music] Hallelujah don't misinterpret the mercy of God don't misinterpret the longsuffering of God not because he's longsuffering means there's no no judgment one time he said the cup of the iniquity is not yet full the sinning sin and sin and a of a jug are waiting for it to reach full to judge them the longsuffering is what have that vile or jar Falling Up hoping people turn around hoping to repent hoping I can cancel what has to come because once I reach the top it's automatic judgment can be delayed but judgment will come Ezekiel 18 says the soul that sinth it shall die the son shall not bear the iniquity of the father neither shall the father be the iniquity of the son the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon them if the Wicked Man will turn from his sins that he committed and keep my statutes and do that which is lawful and right he shall surely live he shall not die all his all his transgression that he committed they shall not be mentioned unto him in his righteousness that he had done he shall live God ask a question have I any pleasure at all that the wicked should die sayth the Lord God and not that he should return from his ways and live but when the righteous turn away from his righteousness and commit iniquity and do it according to all the Abomination that the Wicked Man do it shall he live all his righteousness that he has done shall not be mentioned in his trespass that he had trespassed in his sin that he had sinned in them shall he die there a man recently died the other day or he was a young fiery preacher singer gifted guy in his late years he come a revelation there's no hell he said a god of love would not have hell when he die he went straight to hell he can't he lost his whole church because he get this new revelation and what not whole church abandon him and whatnot and he end up talking going on the news and talking about God a god of love and going love and love and love and making this I call it chocolate cake God he died finished people in this message don't think people going to hell they think every funeral people going to heaven that is not true that's not true again verse 27 when the wicked man turned from his wickedness that he had committed and do it that which is lawful and right he shall save his soul alive because he consider it turn it away from all his transgression he had committed he shall surely live he shall not die yet say the house of Israel the way of the Lord is not equal in other words people saying God is not fear go he not just oh House of Israel are not my ways equal are not your ways unequal therefore I will judge you oh House of Israel everyone according to his ways sayith the Lord God repent and turn yourself from all your transgression so iniquity shall not be your ruin and I want to give two examples Eli sons and Aaron's sons these are sons of high priests sons of men who in position 1 Samuel 3 it said and the child Samuel ministered unto the Lord before Eli and the word of the Lord was precious in those days there was no open Vision it came to pass at that time Eli was laid down in the place his eye began to wax dim he could not see and and he the lamp of God went out in the temple where the ark was and Samuel was laid down to sleep and the Lord called Samuel he said here am I and he ran unto Eliah and said here am I th callest me he said I call not lie down again and he went and lay down and the Lord called yet again Samuel Samuel Rose went to Eli and said here am I for thou D call me and he answered I call not my son lie down again now Samuel did not yet know the Lord neither was the word of the Lord yet revealed unto him and the Lord called Samuel again the third time and he arose and went to Eliah and said here am I for thou this call me and Eli perceive the Lord that called the child therefore Eli said unto Samuel go lie down and it shall be if I if he call thee Thou shalt speak and say Lord for thy servant Heth so Samuel went down and lay down in his place and the Lord came and stood and called as other times Samuel said speak for thy servant hear it and the Lord said to Samuel behold I will do a thing in Israel at which both the ears of everyone that hear it it shall tingle God they doing it in secret you in that day I will perform against Eli this is God telling this young child what he going how he going to handle Eli in that day will I perform against Eli all the things which I spoken coning his house when I begin I will also make an end for I told him that I will judge his house forever for the iniquity which he knowth because his sons made themselves vile and he restrained them not he had a responsibility in the house to deal with your sons to deal with the ruin and the violence inside your house deal with it therefore I have sworn unto the house of Eli that the iniquity of Eli's house shall not be purged with sacrifice nor offering forever let's talk about Aaron Sons Leviticus 9 and Moses and Aaron a backdrop here went into the Tabernacle of the congregation and came out and blessed the people he this church are you with me still and the glory of the Lord appeared unto all the people so the people saying God's glory right and there came fire out from before the Lord and consumed upon the altar the burnt off offering and the fat which all the people saw they shouted and fell on their faces just think about that now everybody seen Glory they seen fire they seen all these things taking place chapter 10 and naab and abiu the sons of Aaron took either of them his sensor put fire therein and put incense there on and offered Strange Fire before the Lord which he commanded them not they're doing their own thing they're fixing their own incense they they find the incense enough and they add a little thing and they take away a little thing and they do their own thing verse two and they went out fire from the Lord and devoured them and they died before the Lord he's a pastor he's a this he's a he's nothing we are nothing before God

people I'll be glorified and Aon held his peace in other words Aon just keep quiet he see his son perish right there for doing crazy stuff before God and Aaron couldn't say a word so you can go and
