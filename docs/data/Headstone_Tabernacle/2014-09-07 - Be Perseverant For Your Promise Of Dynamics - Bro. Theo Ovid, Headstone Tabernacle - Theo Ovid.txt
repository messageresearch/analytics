also romans chapter 4 verse 19 to 21 welcome this evening praise god are you here and those connected life to us we say welcome reading from matthew chapter 15 reading verse 21 then jesus went dense and departed onto the coast of tai and sidon and behold a woman of canaan came out of the same coast and cried at him saying have mercy on me o lord thou son of david my daughter is curiously vexed with the devil but he answered another word and the disciples came and besought him saying send her away for she cried after us and he answered and said i am not sent but unto the lord sheep of the house of israel then came she and worshipped him saying lord help me but he answered and said it is not meat to take the children's bread and cast it to dogs and she said truth lord yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their master's table then jesus answered and said unto her o woman great is thy faith be it unto zee even as dog built and a daughter was made whole from that very hour and reading from romans chapter four i'm going to read from verse 19 to 21. speaking about abraham and being that we can fate he considered not his own body now dead when he was about a hundred years old neither yet the deadness of sarah's womb he staggered not at the promise of god true unbelief but was strong in faith giving glory to god and being fully persuaded that what he had promised he was able also to perform let's pray father we thank you for your holy word and what consolation we have in the scriptures even jesus had full confidence in the scriptures that he said destroy this body and treaties i'll raise it up because of david's word i shall not suffer my holy one to see corruption or leave his soul in hell father help us this night this evening that we can have such full confidence and faith in your word knowing that your word can't fail heavens will pass away but you will will never pass away or we thank you for the blessed assurance that your word is true that your word is you that your word is real confirm your word this evening in jesus mighty ask it amen amen you will be seated oh praise the name of the lord for title this evening be perseverant for your promise of dynamics that's the title this evening be perseverant for your promise of dynamics another inspiration summer quote uh from brother branham message perseverance he said what we need today is a man and a woman who will take god by his word and be persistent with it that's what we need a man or woman that will take god by his word and be persistent with it perseverance the quality that allows someone to continue trying to do something even though it is difficult perseverant able or willing to persevere and i want to bring something from this message called perseverance amber to the people and he said perseverance means to be persistent to make a goal faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen we have a body like a seed a seed on the outside as a shell inside the shell is a crust or a pulp and a germ that's the way we are body soul spirit and the body has five senses say ct smell here to the soul and so forth inside one avenue that avenue is the place that god set every man from adam and eve self-will you will to live or you will to die either one you want to it is based on free moral agency and whatever spirit listen that you let dominate you will bring forth the fruits your life will be dominated by the inside so regardless of what people say your life is dominated by what is on the inside of you so if you let fate dominate your life it will reflect on the outside if you let doubt dominate your life it'll also reflect on the outside so many people rely on these outside senses they're fine nothing against them if they agree with the sixth sense this spirit can be only two kinds one is the spirit of god the other is the spirit of the devil you can't serve two masters at the same time you either give one or you give the other so if you've got a spirit of god in you you've got faith and you believe every word that god said now the devil is not like some people think he's mean and everything but he's deceitful the devil make you think you're right and when you disagree with the world that shows that it isn't the spirit of god because the holy spirit wrote the bible there has got to be agreeable with the word isn't that right so you can't hunt for wisdom you have to stay with the word doctor persevere to be persistent is to make a goal you've got to set your mind on something you got to be persistent in it because you believe it's the thing that you want you believe you can get it hallelujah is dynamic the thing you want do you believe you can get it yeah praise god now watch you've got to in your mind made up of what you're going to do now you cannot have faith in god without knowing the word of god or knowing something about god isn't that right blessed are the name of the lord christ when he was on earth was the body of god god created this body isn't that right someone built him a house hobby the most i don't dwell in houses made with hands but a body has not prepared me no god prepared himself a body in the form of the lord jesus which was the christ meaning the anointed one now all i was in god he poured into christ he was the fullness of the godhead bodily and all of his christ he poured into the church what is it anointed one to continue his work so christ's work must be continued through a body a bright body this time his body hallelujah so in other words you become mrs jesus christ by coming into his body and you become god's mechanic on the earth isn't that right hallelujah you believe that now god can't change if god made a decision it has to remain that way if he changes then he's human like i am he is just a man that can make a mistake but he's infinite and he's omnipotent he cannot make a mystic and be god so his first decision when man sin he forgive him on the basis of believing the word the second man come he's got to act the same way isn't that right you have got to have faith in what you're doing and if your heart condemns us not then we have faith isn't that right now you cannot get yourself together because you know there's things there that god teaches that you will not cope with so if your life is not coping with the word you have a problem to get faith to receive what god say because your heart sits there condemned but once your life begins to cope with the word every promise is here every promise is true everybody says amen there is no condemnation in your heart as a believer you have access to your father isn't that right do you believe that so therefore you can't come up here and said i want to be healed and last night i was drunk all day lord hear me this morning i won't drink too much more you've got to surrender yourself you've got to give yourself completely to god you've got to obey the word steroid completely when god speaks to a man here we go he has ambition and he has papers and that is why you have to hear from god and that is why people follow people because they're not hearing from god so they trust the people that they're following that they hear from god but they themselves don't hear themselves and that's why jesus asks his disciples who do men say i am then he asks who do you say i am and peter said that what the christ peter who are direct from heaven oh hallelujah he didn't ask james and anybody else he said what the christ the son of the living god he could pronounce his confession because he got a revelation once you get a revelation you can confess it but it got to be according to the word god only reveal his word oh blessed be the name of the lord so when god speaks to a man he gives them faith that's why amram and joseph didn't hide moses under the bed they take that baby and put them to sail right right in the midst of alligators they put them to sail into the arms of pharaoh why because when god speaks to a man he has faith not fear he has faith you know you're gonna get a breakthrough you know you're gonna get delivered you know you're gonna get a victory you know you're gonna get touched hallelujah you know that because god put a faith tongue inside your soul hallelujah so when god speaks to a man he has faith in god hallelujah not what the doctor say what god said not what the results of the test say what god said oh hallelujah the test is negative but god say i am positive you are going to be healed oh give the lord praise his people when god speaks to a man he has faith he has ambition i like that ambition when you have no ambition you have problems serious problem any days any day yesterday and today is the same they don't have to have that tomorrow you cooled right through you have no ambition you got where you are you don't need to progress you don't need to pray you don't need to do anything at all you just dear you under existence you have no growth no maturity hallelujah you think you think you're just staying in some cocoon somewhere no ambition no goals nothing excites you nothing boos you you don't have nothing to achieve when you wake up in the morning you just wake up in the morning you don't feel to wake up and say today is a great deal i'm getting closer to where i want to go too i have a name i have a vision i have a purpose that's what having a vision is that's what our ambition is it makes you get up from jericho and head down to bethel it makes you get it from bethel and hector to jordan that's what purpose is that's what goal is it make you sick of yourself until i want a revival it makes you sick of where you are and stay away you want to go no ambition the job you have you like it because you not i'm not be sure to go further ambition me more work more responsibility more orders more comfortability you don't want to be accountability so you doubt responsibility because responsibility carries accountability ambition is a powerful thing let my people go and they go they have no more excuse they can't be in pharaoh they can't blame his horsemen they are out of egypt no horsemen behind them no licks behind them no whip behind them they only have a here man line to and some people said give me across the border because say all right you want to water across there come and fight food and then go back wanna go back they go back fight with everybody else when the first fight go back and take a portion before there so when god speaks so many as fate he has ambition and he has purpose so therefore if i know you have no purpose god will speak to you you are dead you are laodicean you have a badge mark laudisia you flashing audition all them demons seen now there's a past passing straight he's a church member passing straight as ever she have allowed that wretched poor miserable blind they don't even know it leave them let them go and send a message leave them let them go and go to the church leave them leave them but you see that bride they're different boy they're hungering they have telstra they are passionate watch when god speaks to a man he gives him a purpose when god speaks to a man he gives him ambition when god speaks to a man he gave him faith to do it to accomplish or to achieve what his purpose is in life what god called him to do and he called us to be the church of god not to be in a church to be the church and the church is his body i want you to catch what we're talking about when we say church we're not talking about this building we're not talking about here we're talking about being in his body that's your calling is not right so let's just make it our purpose in life to see that we are the church of god let's have ambition not sit around because of jones is what do we care about it they don't do it let's do it anyhow so this person don't want to do something you do it this wasn't the one of worship you worship this was normally faithful you be faithful oh hallelujah praise god if the rest of the nation wants to sink that's up to them we want god we want to achieve we want our faith i want that to be our church i want that to be our attitude we want to achieve i don't want to be in the message i want to become the message i want the message leaving me i want a message float for me when they see me they must see look the message coming look the message walking you ever meet the message yet come there's a real message of malachi 4 no argument no debate just a life that thunders against the enemy oh hallelujah praise god when that's at the light of trinidad oh my that's the thunder that shakes the devil when you walk devils move out when you walk the devils run oh my heart you don't hear what i'm saying when you walk the devil no time to run oh praise god and then you're saying you mean the kind of sister that when you wake up in the morning they ever say my god she's up get out praise god she's up she's on fire she's up she is something else that's what we're talking about you love to live you love to live to live is to live christ it's a diet you love life you love god you love his blood you love his people you love his program you love his people you love his his desires oh hallelujah his desires your desire you have a passion for god you have a passion for his program you want to see people born

when the lion's dead they're your testimony well i gotta fight with the preacher fight you mean that there's a physical fighter what is your real fight what i mean your mental fight or you had mental problems whoa i wish i wasn't your age you know it could be a real kind of this purple it wouldn't be right i want i want when i cross over yonder david come and say tio tell me because i wasn't there

tell me come on testify holly that's what i'm talking about you can't sit on some church pew and have a testimony we're going to throw you out to get the test what kind of test is that the other sister just looking nicer than mines and i get a fight a fight david lost his wives and david asked the god shall i pursue god said pursue goku and make them follow his horse stumble right there all the ways fall off right there god make sure you take that wifi off and go and then shall i pursue that in my wife shy first you got to pursue you david jump on some horses had a ride whole night they even have a purpose i want back my wife hallelujah some philistine come and take my wife well i'll get our next one what you talking about that's my wife you're talking about which next one that's my land i'm gonna take back what the devil took from me this product wasn't where she was she where's she gone where did you know it is determination persistence perseverance david ride all night and overtake them smooth them by the edge of the sword bring back his wife and god is annoying to the pride she is going to be a super church she is going to be a super phrase as she nears the headstone power going to come into her you have got to be persistent but you can only be persistent when you get a goal and you get an opportunity to have a sense of purpose and if i say brother branham said what we see should make a church your ambition should be to make a church they're going to make a revival don't wait to hear some other choice i'm a revival make your own you feel it for black cake you're feeling for black cake yeah it have grayson's you have the mixture it have recipe it have get your material and mix your cake bake your cake eat your cake that is your black cake you don't have to wait for somebody to cook a cake hoping that they pass by you and give you a peace my god get up from where you are and begin to take what you know is your own you can make that cake you can make that revival you can make it through to your land of possession there are too many people waiting for handouts i'm not talking that in a negative manner but you're waiting for somebody to do for you look elijah tell his servant he shut the heavens by his word god's word now just tell yourself go and tell what you see 20 days gone farming guantanamo sea man around the mountain i'm going to see there's nothing i tell you what you see what did you see oh you can see nothing oh i see nothing oh you could climb a mountain and actually see nothing there's you could see that there is nothing after 40 plus years i've been leaving a message there's nothing there is nothing you mean you communicate all these years and days nothing run again go and see again run again see again run again hallelujah run again see what we have promised run again see the threat of god over my life run again see the power that has released promises oh glory to god run again you run seven times you know i run sometimes because elijah wasn't taking nothing for an answer because nothing is ready and not an answer nothing is zero nothing is nothing you can't come back with nothing come back with something he said i see a cloud like um i gotta say what run run it's that small but rain is coming i hear the sound of the abundance of red you better begin to persevere to your promise of dynamics each one of you each individual begin to understand begin to anointed afresh you each one of you be like simeon god must reveal to you you're gonna get the holy ghost god must reveal to you that this revival is yours it's not your children it's your own come on come on come on now come on i don't have permission to put people in the right or all the bride so really and truly we don't know who really is the bride that mystery is in god i have permission to preach the word your permission to receive it believe it and act upon it i have permission to be convinced this is the truth that many people right now all over the internet they're coming against brother brown coming against the message they don't want to quote abraham they don't believe the prophet no more all kind of foolishness but i believe this is a genuine malachi 4 20th century prophet that brought a message and god is allowing the critics the skeptics to make believers all of them to be exposed because god could only work through true believers so after 40 plus years god filtering you see the first filter was big holes in it the big big unbelief fall right through then you have smaller holes that's it but afterwards the rest that remain is true believer all the unbelief god shaken the camp god shake it in the 70s in the 80s and the 90s shake in the camp shaking filtering because you want to get some people who can become his voice who become his body who become the final voice who become his very word itself he's got the finer people that wouldn't move one iota so what he has promised because what he has promised he has able to perform what he has promised what this promise god is able to perform so i have no problem with even the gonna walk because god promised it i have no problem believing this name will be restored because god promised it i am not responsible keeping it to bring it to pass i'm responsible to make myself available to be a channel in which god can use because you can make yourself available to god if god could use a donkey god could use me come on come on now if god could that's a measly fate that's a low one call it a low blue if god could use a donkey's reason god could use me donkey donkey don't you have no soul god use a donkey surely god could use me yeah yeah god can fix me up hallelujah god could make me a thoroughbred horse hey god could change my desires yeah i want the world into the world i have these styles out there i find myself looking in magazines but god could change that and that's how you have to begin to speak to yourself you have to tell yourself something oh glory to god you have to tell yourself something that's the problem you're talking the wrong thing you're on selfies tell yourself something that's the selfie to have i'm going to tell myself i'm going to arrive i'm going to go to my father take a picture of yourself saying that take a little video of yourself that's the right selfie speak it to yourself i'm going to be a christian and take a little video clip of that i'm going to be overcomer or give the lord some praises and when you're feeling dumb play it back when you're feeling low play it back oh we worship him worship him let's make our purpose in life to see the fear the church of god moses he had ambition never was he the same after that he had ambition he has something to work to watch too and that's why some of you wouldn't even testify invite people because you're not even inviting yourself into the presence of the king i understand now that's right you're cool you're dead we just need some coffins and belongs final rights because you cannot be a real christian and not testify of how you get saved when you get saved and of your you can't have friends and don't tell them about the lord you can't have neighbors and don't tell them about the lord that's one thing i love about my wife she went down clothes store she tested for him anywhere she go she invited she testifying always looking for some way to give with the that's how she has always been witnessing for jesus you have that you know oh yeah do people feel any message i like i have no witness no more long time brother you say we're not in saddam we are elected how did the message come to you i guess he was always born elected but all of us was in saram we're still in saddam the whole world is saddam but god has said nice going down there is a good thing you come now in saddam but some of us get like big shots oh we are in the message we are abraham royal seat you don't have to testify to nobody guess what how there gonna be a resurrection if adam followed his still scattered boundary watch just as we were sinners and what come and save us you have people out there waiting for you to manifest so what ministry gonna have if you have people to go after adam adam while the final call the bribe will have that spirit in the bright saying come go and have a ministry for everybody have a path to play in this program you will be going after souls jesus jesus how does any different he said well philip come aren't you come then fellas just the word just click as he talk the click no holy ghost but predestinating mysteries just click and they drop and they just come they don't know what they're coming for you say come follow me i have a work to do come follow me hallelujah what about 72 sons they're very close to the imaging director of the fishing business well trail isn't that right and jesus said come then father drop the next and pause everybody son where are you going my business is i get any calls daddy get a call them drop fishing net drop ambition drop all they have to follow christ and christ going and preach everywhere oh my oh my goat but but but that's how it was long time and buses people preaching on the streets the preaching all about the handing out books in the home because why this thing is so real you want to get it to everybody this thing is so real you can't eat this by yourself you'll feel convicted afterwards all this food you alone who give out multiply the bread and the fish you don't even have to multiply it it's already multiplied you have so much books and tastes better last year another book well asking about the tea palace to test if i tell somebody about the love of god about the grace of god oh my so but abraham oh watch all the days of his life he saved god to deliver those people as long as he was getting along all right what he cared about was those people in their suffering that was moses burden he was living his life to deliver the people with his mental conception his intellectual revelation he killed one man and ran but moses was packed with a burden do you have a burden today a burden in this church a burden for dynamics a boon for a revival a burden for breakthrough a burden to see people delivered i'm not talking about talking about people that is the easy one you don't even have waiting for that just open them up and yap i'm talking about a burden that you guys say you know what i know my sister in trouble i'm a brother in trouble i'm going to pray for them i'm going to ask for god to deliver them i'm going to call them i'm going to help them i'm going to encourage them i'm going to back them up i'm going to hold them up even if they kind of get somebody on the phone or whatnot they can still get them up in prayer lift them up before god isn't that right but i'm saying people god still hear people crying out unto god and you talk about the sister the woman who died and she swallowed something called radium and years after they still find with them thinking on her bones and he's saying this here he said watch oh brother if radium have that kind of effect unless how much more will unless eternal supernatural all-powerful infinite almighty god have the same effect this all-powerful god is waiting for somebody with bully fate to step out and challenge the enemy on the basis of his word oh hallelujah when elijah they're from second half after his whole heart desire was to get that promise he wanted the promise that was his motive that was all he has that was his life that was his intent everything all every hung on getting that promise that's the whole every time you wake up in the morning the promise simeon the promise abraham the promise if i'm going to mark it but he's starting to promise at him oh yeah boy i'm going great but god promised me hallelujah you're going abraham hopes you have a sign i am promised a baby not everybody didn't like that sign who would like that sign everybody say old man but abram only laughing and rejoicing because he already had isaac isaac was in faith inside his soul so he could shout he can't produce it yet but it's a revelation to him revelation comes to the individual listen you have an internet call to share you can share this and share that you can share revelation i'll say it again you cannot share a revelation you have no button to click share with revelation you can testify your revelation but revelation is personal and individual revelation is your own that's your button when god reveal it to you it's yours no faith is so when abraham is quickened to him his precious wife he is so close to it wasn't quitting to her that is why she could have a good laugh but that was his wife she could laugh because she doesn't have what god revealed to abraham and when god revealed it to you your sister could laugh your mother could laugh your brother could laugh your husband could laugh but you can't laugh because you have a revelation of what god has revealed to you could we say amen here's the prophet now i'm persuaded that we are not sincere about the things that we're talking about if your whole motive this morning rest upon giving god praise for my healing i'm determined to be healed by the power of god this is brother branham now this is the attitude you have to have i am determined to live a christian life i am determined to walk in peace with god i am determined to do it i don't care what mother say what church say what pastor say what anybody else say what the world say i am determined that's the singleness of my heart you are going to get somewhere there oh hallelujah praise god and brother i'm talking about elijah we heard it this morning second hand robe don't you put somebody else robe that's more eating with doubts where all these defeats and superstition and ups and downs has put holes in it leaking all through put on the robe of the conqueror don't trust in your church who once taught salvation by the baptism holy ghost who once taught divine healing and now we have mort and doubts put on the robe of him that never lost the battle and you're on your way to jordan brother what you need you'll find your luck too when you come to jordan you may be taught you may be smart you may have doctor of divinity my phd philosophy doctor of latin all kind of degrees you may have the robe of the methodist church you have your own pentecostal church only a second arrow to begin with some man-made dogmas to comfort like that but even if you're a christian he said today what about some preacher he said today with many school and educated scholars with many men who can tear the bible apart and settle together in mathematics many men who can tell you great things in the way of teaching who knows bible history to the very moment who could tell you that the our hell was lit on the oh it went out that's how deep these mens are they could tell thee our hell got lit and how it went out they can tell you these things they've got spiritual baptisms more kind of thing but when you come to jordan to the face the critical world what did he cry nobody elisha where is the god of elijah here we see it wasn't the room of the elijah that done it it was the power of god of elijah and i've done it and the thing that the world needs today this morning is the power of the god of elijah you might have spoken tongues you might have run up the floor watch a secondhand robe was all right but he needed a fresh call in his heart from god you need a fresh anointed from god he wore a second-handed robe when he come to the river but he needed a brand new fullest hand call from god our first unpower to perform the miracles acts 1 8 you shall receive power after the holy ghost come upon you isn't that right oh blessed be so what are they looking for what more do you want what does the church want he said everybody looking for messiah what does the church really on what are you looking for actors what am i looking for what are you looking for here he said we already got it god give it to us it's his promise for the hour that is what you're supposed to be looking for the promise of the oh what's the promise dynamics you shall receive power you already got the promise hallelujah listen to this we look in the bible we see it everywhere through the bible anointed ones come on and make that wood live again right in the hour for the hour we have cut the messiah it's him the word say in the beginning was the word it's just waiting for somebody with faith to anoint it and make it live again oh that's beautiful so think about it now all the promises are there the messiah is right here he's not coming he is here the messiah is the word the promised word for the hour just waiting for somebody with faith to anoint it and faith is based on oh hallelujah so therefore you still have to come to broadly love you still have to come to the honey to have the faith anointed let's take a look at that woman she came to jesus she had a lot of effects for the devil oh she had plenty disappointments her disciples couldn't handle her and then jesus said it's not fit to take the children's bread and cast at the door but when faith is anchored you could perceive here when faith is in your soul you don't have disappointments because you just bind this appointment when jesus said it's not fit to take the children's breath and cast a dog that didn't draw off she didn't stop coming to church she didn't give up on god she stood right there you see faith makes you stand faith make you persevere say how i'm not going to give up i'm going to stay right here till something happens that's what faith does that's how faith works real fit perseverance real fear press to watch the promise so the bible said abraham staggered not at the promise of god through unbelief but was strong worshiping he was strong praising he was strong smiling when he come to church because he knew every day isaac was coming closer every day the promise was coming more real every day he was nearer to his revival every day he was nearer to his deliverance every day he was narrow to his healing every day he was narrow to his feeling that's what fate does the church sits spiritually dead hardly know what to do one running this way one that way and here every promise that god made in the bible every one of them is lean just as good as it ever was what make the church like this laodicea she has to come that way oh praise god now here we go from the absolute every great achievement has been tied to an absolute not achievement every great achievement and there's got to be something a final time post and no man cannot by no means achieve anything unless they're recognized as an absolute and paul and the absolute he's afraid with a christ-centered life so what brother brahma is saying you cannot achieve much if it will come to an absolute well i don't know if this is right because somebody doing this somebody you're doing that you have no absolute absolute is the red light red light cannot mean go that gonna be massive confusion red supposed to mean absolutely stop green means absolutely go that is an absolute umpire absolute money is out man is out is a goal there's no goal blow the whistle you're out off the field walk whatever your passing is final if you don't have empire it will be right in every match so you have to have the umpire you have to have the lights you have to have an absolute one time hitler was an absolute ever hitler say everybody yes sir no sir hitler's divorce but that was bogus absolute but we have an absolute absolute is the word don't know how to say this here but you don't have skills but hit a full scale hit somebody with full skill falls thing on the scale and some people use false skills they use one skill for themselves and one skill and change skills quick to change to judge somebody else so the us skills to suit yourself that's not absolute you're shifting skills you're shifting your weight the same way you judge you have to go consistent you have to use the same plumb line you can't say this is for my family and that's not for yours this is church not for that church no it got to be the same scale and when you see the same skill that's the absolute the word so you don't have feelings in it and emotions it's just the word hallelujah that is what the absolute is the word oh praise god i'm going to wrap up here the reason that paul had a christ-centered life because he personally lay aside his teaching and he preached only met christ quite like that he really met christ so he wasn't just taught and had knowledge and information and revelation he met christ by way of the pillar of fire and when you meet christ and the only way you're going to ever know him is to meet him to know him is life not even to know his word as good as it may be you've got to know him to know him's life to know him his life and when your life's changed you make you make it make you do things you ordinary will not do he says like a ship a ship of an absolute that's the anchor when the ship is tossed in you could put the anchor it will hold and if christ here we go is your absolute you are tied to him in a manner no matter what anybody says how hard the persecution gets how bad the storm seems to be how it looks impossible for it to happen it's something has to happen to you christ becomes your absolute on any promise and the bible becomes your absolute if you are sick you are praying for healing and something strikes you i've got it nothing going to shake you from it amen here we go what the christian needs today in this atomic age in this time of incidency you need something besides just an experience of joining church you need an anchor an absolute that you know because here we go churches will fail might want to admit it but that is what the prophet said i am not a prophet i believe a prophet so if he said that i have to believe that churches will fail people will fail but christ cannot fail so christ is the absolute to the believer and if christ is your absolute you are tied to him not the church to him so if the church failed that's not you you heard what david said do 10 000 fall on my right side action let me move that is them they have nothing to do with me that is ten thousand on my right side i am on this side they're on that side that's david the lord is with me thyroid and stuff they comfort me don't prepare the table for me in the presence of my enemy david had a relationship with god a personal one when he get in trouble identity oh lord have i sinned david know he sinned against god so he came to god and confessed restore unto me the joy david recognized the joy gone but he know he's a son restore unto me the joy god i'm not feeling good oh give the lord praises so you do have joy by the time you repent and ask god to restore your joy and when you repent and ask god to restore here comes your joy then david i was glad when they said unto me what let us go into the house of the lord then they get that joy to come to service they get a joy to come to church they get a joy to worship a joy to hear the word of god it becomes your joy amen so you know if the red doesn't mean red he said don't watch you have a big traffic jam it's kind of a rude way to express it but yet you know what i'm trying to say notice the reason we have gotten to it there because every one of us make our own absolute i cannot selfie absolutely they already making their own we have our own absolute each church has this absolute each group has its own absolute and they say each one and say we are the truth the way we got it all you ain't got nothing to do with it you and a minority we are the greatest group and people do that you ought not to do that until it's like the days of judges where every man does what's right in his sight he thinks he is right in his own side but there's a way to see him right unto mine and the end thereof is the way of death but the bible said people did that because the word of god was precious they didn't have a prophet and if we didn't have a prophetic message that we could go back to to tie ourselves back to it we'll be in big trouble he said we want to live life is the greatest treasure that man can have i know we've got to find what is life he said my word is life he's the same yesterday today and forever you have got to get the living word in you to have the living god in you because the word here is god when it's made flesh in you made spirit and life in you when it goes into your flesh and your faith and becomes life not just your faith you have to go in your flesh too the way that the sins you the world have to become part of you and i say you have your hand you can raise it that's your hand that's how the word has to be part of you you must want it to live you see when your competition go back home and it doesn't apply to your life you're not getting involved you're not you have to get mixed up with the word then you have to come saturated in your being it has to become part of you where you're feasting on it you're living on it you're talking about it amen tomorrow you could testify about the service you could share back things from it if tomorrow you forget everything you know going on you're not focused you have to be able to you know yeah dynamics is minds i am supposed to connect with it that's my promise that's the promise of my father he's sending dynamics to me give a promise another time of life he's going to visit me i know i'm going to get a bridge right no i'm going to get yes i have a hot temper but i know go cool it down yeah something some people need it a certain way and you're by finding oh gosh i wish i was gonna push that person cool but a person too cool they cool till they cold so you don't want to go on that you have extremes people are meeting a certain way and that person fire temper oh they could fight a bus or they could fight more than but one bustle they have that but god called all of them the cool coal and the fire heart tempers oh all of that is what people do and god love them the same you know god will have i love mr cool mr cool real cool i'm mr noisy and rowdy i don't love him that much no god don't have that everybody have a place for it jacob was drama you know oh yeah jacob so was gideon also all them guys had drama joshua was drama too isn't that right gideon said the lord be with me is the lobbyist where the miracles that wasn't easy you know abraham was piece of drama too it got tele-brown yeah sheila and great reward and abram said what reward can i go challenge god says talking you're talking rude come come the stars then come back and let's talk because so shall your seed be now abram eleven to see all themselves come forth but god says so shall your seed be you could say what you want you could think what you want if i say so i am god my word will not return void and you could say what you want god's gonna heal you if god said he's gonna heal you and god gonna deliver your family i don't care what they're doing right now today that has nothing to do with what god promised oh glory to god god have them so in some condition oh my feeling inspired right now their conditions all are wrong as god set it up that way he sent the mountain so high he said the valley solo he said the river so high to prove he is god you heard that he set the mountain so high he set the valley solo when it comes into your flesh and your faith and becomes life then you are living example you are an epistle of god oh blessed be lord god is right his word is right others are not right that's right along as they stay with the word when you leave the word you leave god god is watching over his word to vindicate it to make it real when a man takes a word of god no matter how little his fate is if he won't mix it with unbelief it will bring him out to the light or praise the name of the lord and that's how you are christian by birth when you are born of the spirit of god persistent yes but when you can achieve something all men to all the ages have been able to achieve when they are persistent if their faith in what they're trying to achieve it depends upon what your achievement is it depends upon what you're trying to do oh blessed being the lord today and here we go i'm closing musicians please what we need today is men and women who will take god by his word and be persistent with it samson hallelujah he was persistent as long as he could feel those seven locks around him hallelujah so samson wasn't easy we know that samson was quite a character but as long as he could feel several lots he felt invincible you couldn't you can't fault him for that because god says as long as then seven locks dear i am with you that is my contract with you you have several locks i am with you how are you moving i have the back here so samson moving man are you oh yes he moving so much he move out of god's program and god's will when he lost it i see after a while stands to believe it's his power recovery lie let's have a tell him god tell me now what is secret now we have a secret because only seven seals no silence there nothing they say tell me something what's going on there he's safe he'll time it with this and then he break the chords afterwards he started to lie but he was still there started doing small wrong but the pot was still there started breaking the rules but the power's still there because god said seven i'm with you if you hold seven when he finally breaks and he tell her make sure he gets it all said cut off so now he's ordinary all of a sudden this man that conquer land conquered gates conquer the enemy be or he's find himself ordinary same muscles same man same books same tapes same message ordinary no unction no inspiration no vision no fire no power no presence all of a sudden you realize is so dies how would this be now the eyes out grinding at the mill what a pitiful condition what a shame to come to the spot after serving god i have to be under his glory and anointing to be stripped to be just like another man it makes no sense god called you out all these years not to be ordinary no we are called to break into the supernatural realm where all things are possible do you believe that hallelujah now watch i'm closing with this samson was very persistent as long as he could feel those seven locks around him he know that the promise was god given him and every man and woman could be persistent as samson as long as you can feel what that power of promise or wrong you of god power of promise said power of promise say it again power of promise as long as you could feel the power of the promise of dynamics ah the power of the promise of what you powerful service the power of being baptized with the holy ghost as long as you could feel that power you could persevere towards your inheritance you could persevere to watch your dynamics let us stand on praise and worship the lord and you can be perseverant as long as you know you got that promise in your heart that fate i told you when you're sitting there that feeder says i am here i am healed just keep walking brother god will take care of the philistines don't you worry just keep walking oh hallelujah why until you come and sing a song before we change your service oh bless just raise our hands and worship the lord who praise the lord hallelujah praise the

thanks he broke it and said take each this is my body which is broken for you this dude in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup when he had stopped saying this cup is the new testament in my blood this dewey as often as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as eat this bread and drink this cup ye do show the lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat his bread and drink this cup of the lord unwillingly shall be guilty of the body and blood of the lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that each of them drink it unwittingly eating them drinking damnation to himself not desealing the lord's body for this cause many are weakened sickly among you and many sleep for if we will judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chastened of the lord that we should not be condemned with the world praise well let's just bow our heads and close our eyes praise god
