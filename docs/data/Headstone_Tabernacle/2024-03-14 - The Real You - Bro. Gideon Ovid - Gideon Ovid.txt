you have your Bibles uh let's just turn quickly to the scripture sure feels good in here amen from The Book of Romans chapter 8 a couple verses there verses 28 to 31 a very familiar scripture and it says and we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are the called according to his purpose for whom he did for no he also did predestinate to be conf formed to the image of his son and he might be the firstborn among many Brethren moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also Justified and whom he justified them he also glorified what shall we then say to these things if God be for us who can be against us amen you believe that tonight amen amen let's just bow our heads as we opening a word of prayer oh have Heavenly Father we thank you so much Lord we're so grateful for this moment in time for this this this opportunity we have to gather together on this Wednesday night Lord Lord you know the thought that that was placed on My Heart Lord I pray that you would bring it together that you would take all the all the scriptures all the quotes all the thoughts all the ideas and and mold it and make it and shape it the way you want to delivered tonight Lord Lord I pray that you bless your people that are gathered here in person physically Lord and those that might be their homes or or or workplaces or various places those connected on the internet those that may see it afterwards Lord I pray that your holy spirit will reach them and touch them wherever they are Lord Lord I pray that you would Inspire my my my words my lips Lord I pray that you take me out of the way that you would speak directly lip to air to your people tonight Lord Lord I pray that lives be changed and transformed and and that your will be done in Jesus name we pray amen amen amen you may have your seats blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah you love you love the Lord tonight amen always a tremendous opportunity I'd like to thank the pastor for the opportunity actually you know to be here tonight and I don't take it for granted and I don't want you take for granted you being here we may not always have an opportunity like this but I'm here to tell you something I'm here to bring a simple message and it's this is that I didn't come to to to to speak to CEOs and managers and supervisors that might just be positions at work positions in your community I didn't I didn't come to to to speak to the fancy I didn't come to to speak to to to to doctors and lawyers and accountants and Carpenters that might be occupations but tonight I come to speak to the real you I come to speak to Believers people who could catch a hole of faith and hold onto the promises of God and stand on it and be patient and persistent and believe that his word is true and he's the same yes y today today and forever amen that whatever he promised for us will come to pass though it ter wait for it but it will come to pass we believe in a a sure promise in a sure word amen so not here to preach to your flesh not here to speak to your feelings and your thoughts and ideas and your imagination and reasoning we're not here to figure it out but we here because God called us before the foundation of the earth and he set out a Redemption plan he set out a master plan he has an inheritance that is predestinated for us it doesn't matter where you were last night or last year he knows what he want to pass you through to get the outcome and get you in position to hear from him he's here to to speak to the real you the you behind the mask not what people think about you not what your neighbors think or or what your wife feels or or how you pretend or if you're smileing in front the camera he want to know when when the cameras are not there when the lights are off and no one's watching and the pastor isn't there and the the laer isn't there and there's no one to call you the Bible said David encourage himself that's what he's looking for that believer that could stand on his word that doesn't need to be propped up I don't need to tell you to worship I don't need to tell you to praise because that's why we here we here to beat the devil wherever he is any time any place anywhere on the any condition we will keep him on his toes we keep him on the Run that's why we here we here to praise and worship but we got a job to do because we want to see it through till the end amen amen amen thank you Lamb of God hallelujah if if you think I sound strange tonight I want you to just check yourself a little bit because you might be suffering a little bit tonight from spiritual Amnesia you may have forgotten where you was before tonight you may have forgotten where you came from you may have forgotten who your father was you may have forgotten before the foundation of the Earth was laid when job was asked where were you answer for yourself answer like a man give an account of where you were and he was there he was worshiping like John said he was praising you weren't sad you didn't have bills you didn't have pain you didn't have trials you were giving him worship you were giving him glory you are lifting him up you are causing something to happen back there and that's what you called to do right now you're called to create an atmosphere for the Holy Spirit to dwell so it doesn't matter tonight how you felt walking up the stairs it doesn't matter if somebody brought you or somebody invited you he has something special in store for you tonight that's predestinated for his children that you're predestinated to hear right now at this time you couldn't hear it last week or last month you probably wasn't ready for it but you're going to hear it tonight and he's testing to see how you're going to respond how you're going to act upon his word because you're the believer physically you might be tired it doesn't matter he's speaking to the real you the real you isn't tired the real you says Amen to his word the real you believes every promise line upon line precept upon precept whatever he sets up for you that's the real you saying amen that's the truth so be it unto me like Mary it didn't matter it was hard to explain it may have been hard to believe but that's why we have faith to believe every promise once God said it that settles it I believe it I want to say Amen to his word no doubt we want to be in one mind one Accord not not distress raed not strain with every thought and idea and every new doctrine coming out no no no no no we want to stay with that oldfashioned sin killing devil chasing oldtime Holy Spirit the S the song said the devil won't go near it that's why they fear it but it's good enough for me tonight it's good enough for you it's good enough to keep you it may seem like the boat is rocking it may be it may seem like it's a little uncertain but this is the way he's chosen for you they say he's kept his best souers for this age they say he's got kept his best solders for this time so you could put on the full armor of God and understand the devices of the devil and keep him on his toes we want to stand on his neck tonight we want to keep him on the run tonight nothing shall stand before us all the days of your life like Joshua nothing should stand before you you you should be so equipped so ready so filled with his spirit that anytime he shows his head that unbelief shows his head you back him up you say boo back to the devil there is no way he going to drive you into frustration or depression or he's going to back you up in a corner no no no no no no no he didn't give us a spirit of fear but love and power his power is here to back up the devil amen amen amen you all don't get me started tonight you all don't get me started tonight something's going to happen tonight this is not a regular Wednesday night service you may have come expecting things to be routine and normal but the season is changing things are changing from this night forth and forever more he the same yesterday today and forever his word never fails and tonight he has a special word for you so believe and receive grab a hole of faith and be it done unto you you can be healed tonight you can be set free tonight you can be delivered tonight you can be restored tonight nothing could stop it what he has for you will come to pass [Music] amen amen amen amen thank you Jesus you may have your seats but sometimes we get so caught up in what people say about us what the boss has to say what the neighbor say what family thinks how people feel but your role is to worship Him Your Role is to praise him praise him thank him bless him him exalt him lift him up you're here because he is you breathe because he is worrying wouldn't help Waring will not change your circumstance it wouldn't change your [Applause] circumstance let me tell you something I'm not an attorney but in court I could only imagine there are cases that may be called 5 years later or 10 years later you know how the Jud the judicial system works sometime 20 years later and is human to forget so a trained attorney will use triggers or stimuli to cause you to remember and God God is the attorney of attorneys he is the the the Lord of lords and the King of Kings he knows just what to do to bring you back in line so an attorney for example you may have your seat an attorney might say Mr Brown where were you on January 2nd in the evening time and you may say I don't remember but you swear to tell the truth the whole truth nothing but the truth so you don't remember we call that forgetting right it might be human to forget but a trained attorney will say okay you don't remember but Mr Smith was walking down the street with a red jersey on it means nothing to you and then he asks you you know Mr Smith right and you say yes and the rain was falling and he paint a picture for you and all of a sudden you remember oh yes I was there oh yes I was there because he trigger your memory so that's what God wants to do with you tonight he wants to trigger your memory because before you were in sin before you had pain before you had trials and troubles and a headache and worry about your children and your family you were worshiping him you were praising him you are exalting him before you had your mortgage and your bills to pay before you were focused and and and and distracted with the cares of this life you were there before he laid the foundation of the earth you were there because he said who he for knew so he knew you before before you knew yourself before your mother knew you he knew you he had a job for you for such a time as this so the same way a trained attorney will cause you to remember that's the way God works he wants you to remember every promise that he left for you he wants you to remember who you are because from time to time we forget life causes us to forget circumstance causes us to forget situations cause us to forget but he don't want us to forget tonight he want us to remember he want us to move beyond our circumstance and remember his love he said think about his love think about him think about his goodness his faithfulness his Mercy Lord oh my God amen amen amen in a message in a message spiritual Amnesia paragraph 37 the prophet says now this amnesia just when you forget real told is a it caus you to to be in a place where you can't identify yourself remember my title tonight the real you not the facade not the mask not the pretense not what you show the world the real you it causes you to be in a place where you can't identify yourself now it's it's an unusual thing he said it don't happen too often but the cause is from shock it's sometimes you don't even know who they are you find it from Wars sometimes solders get it sometimes people get it another thing causes it is worry worry will cause it worry has no virtue to it at all yeah just just skip worry and accept Faith that's what the prophet said skip worry accept Faith someone said well now what if you're you're going to be shot in the morning wouldn't you worry I said no don't think so why said worry couldn't do nothing but make it worse woo well what good is it going to do to have faith that's the question because you believe you'll be shot in the morning you believe you'll be fired tomorrow you believe you'll be put out tomorrow you believe they'll cut your lights tomorrow here's what he says he said worry couldn't do nothing but make it worse amen and he asked so what faith going to do he said it might deliver me and that's right see so worry has no virtue to it at all but faith has only virtue believe now worry sometime causes it referring to Amnesia paragraph 223 he said you that won the Holy Spirit you that won that experience not an emotional excitement you wanton the Holy Ghost the Life The Germ of Life inside you and you want to get rid of that Amnesia that's making you you can't identify yourself you don't know where to stand you don't know what you are let's get rid of it right now there is a new birth here for you a real genuine New Birth amen how many of you won that new birth tonight won that new birth get rid of that Amnesia so you know where I come from you know no way you're going nobody could fool you nobody could trick you amen amen amen amen thank you Jesus thank you Lamb of God now I quickly want to move through I don't want to keep you too long but in a message Paradox the prophet talks about sincerity right he was speaking about the vision with the the mama the snake and I will just just gloss over it all right and in in paragraph 63 it says and then he's talking different snakes before and he says and then then comes a mber he's death just when he's so fast you can't see him he goes over over the top of weeds and propels himself with with the back of his tail just whoosh and he's gone hits you in the face usually stands up high and Strikes hard and when he hits you you got just a few breaths till you're finished that's what the devil wants to do he wants to hit you so hard he want to sift you like wheat he want to knock you down he want to steal kill destroy he want to to devour you tonight like the Mamba he say and when he hits you you got a few breaths till you finish turn real it it don't only paralyze getting the bloodstream it gets nerves everything you just die in a few seconds them native boys and track boys you can say m and they'll put their heads together scream cuz it's death just in a few seconds just the word m will elicit so much fear that they will run it's that serious and he goes on to talk about in this this Vision the M was crossing the road coming towards him and then it stopped it couldn't get at him but then it turned to his friend in paragraph 65 he said he turned and looks at my friend and away he went after my friend and I seen my friend just jumping way in the air and over him and over him and over him trying the thing was striking at him keep in mind this is death if it strikes you in seconds and I'm going to go down in in in he said if that serpent ever strikes it'll kill him and just then the serpent turned on me speaking about the prophet when I said that he looked at me again so he changed direction from his friend to readjust to him he say he looks at me and a voice came from above me and said you have been given the power to bind him amen the words or any I said well God what must I do he said there is one thing you must do you must be more sincere see you must be more sincere now this is the prophet now this is not you and I this is the prophet and God said through a voice he said you must be more sincere if you want to bind the mber cuz this is death itself death in seconds am amen he said well God forgive me for my uninc and let me have sincerity and when I raise up my hands to him there was something great come over me just lifted me up seems like my whole body was charged with something I looked at the serpent and then he started towards me now getting more sincerity didn't bind him am but it give him the power to bind it at that point he said I looked at the serpent he start towards me and he couldn't do it yet and I said Satan in the name of the Lord Jesus I bind you and the serpent of blue smoke flew out of him and he Cur and made a sign like a s capital S made backwards like a an sign and it means buy this one or or anything below him cuz he was the worst blue smoke fell out of him and his tail choked his own self to death and he went on and and going over to to par to to paragraph 71 he said he he caused the mber to be raised and died again in the vision and he says a voice came again and said you can unbind him right so he said then Satan that I might know that this is the real power of God I unbind you and of course the Mamba came back to life and with that same power he caused the Mamba to be bounded again and he said when he was bounded again just running through he says the snake choked himself right back again and turned to Crystal but then when he did that that voice said now you must be more sincere than what you are to do this then he left me and I was standing in the room so in this Vision he saw himself through sincerity using the power of God to bind and loose amen amen given the power over what was death itself sure that in seconds amen amen and God was showing if he had to do that that power could only be expressed through sincerity so it calls for us to be more sincere we can't afford to operate the same way we operate yesterday am and the day before we have to be more vulnerable more open more honest more surrendered to God with such a contrite and broken Spirit a contrite heart that we can lay it all on the feet of Jesus so we could be more sincere so we can have power to bind and to loose amen it goes on in a message thirst and said it doesn't matter who you are whether you're a deacon a Usher a pastor a elder god is no respector of persons amen and in that message she spoke and it's a familiar story about the Sunday school teacher and it says she taught Sunday school paragraph 227 she taught Sunday school and all her of her little Sunday school group came in they wanted to see her when she went off to Heaven because she was sick she had a social disease and she was in hospital awaiting her death sentence awaiting to die certain death the doctors already declared her dead knowing that was sure so her Sunday school children came to the hospital you know to see her off because she was all right you heard who she was the teacher in Sunday school she had a post and a position she was faithful in church every Sunday all the time she came on a Wednesday night she had a Pew almost designated because of who she was but look at what happened in the story amen hallelujah you say the children wanted to see when she went off to Heaven they wanted to see the Angels come and pack her away because she was a nice Sunday school teacher her pastor outside smoking a cigarette walking up and down the hall in the hospital there a Pentecost Ali leader of a big church fancy pews all the the bells and whistles amen and they was all going to sing when she was going to die you know they know she had to Die the doctor said she was dying so they was all going to see the Angels come pack her way and all at once when she face the reality we talk about the real you so this wasn't the Sunday school hat on this was the real yes sir when she face her reality she was a loyal church member amen she was a Sunday school teacher amen loyal church member of a big fine denominational church but when she started to struggle death struck her her eyes bulge out and you know what she said she said I'm lost amen I'm lost she said I'm lost she said I'm lost get the pastor he put his cigarette out and walked in he said here here here we'll get the doctor to give you a a hyp said I don't want no hyp you deceiver of man I'm dying I'm and I'm going to hell this is the Sunday school teacher now I'm dying and I'm going to hell and I'm lost because you failed to tell me the truth amen amen go get that little good Hughes girl and bring her up here to me real quick just a a context this good Hugh girl was a girl was a real fine believer a real Christian is the kind of person she would Heckle and say why if you put a little makeup on your face and you you change the the shoes you wear and the clothes you wear and you just alter your fashion a little bit you'll be in style he said she said bring that good huged girl and bring her up here to me real quick she is right basically her gospel is true her gospel is correct when she trusts God and she say she walk in the will and counsel of of God that's right it says wait till you face the reality once don't you try to stop that Holy hush don't you blast it away with some Modern educational double barrel shotgun you listen to that warning of the Holy Ghost tonight that's warning you I am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me he is the word amen amen thank you Jesus Hallelujah tonight I'm here to say that listen your denial your excuse often times the police if a police officer were to stop you in the middle of doing something considered illegal and you were to say you know I really didn't know that I was not supposed to be on the bus route you know what they tell you they say ignorance is no excuse sir am because you don't know it doesn't change a fact that this is the law your denial of Truth doesn't change the fact that you are who you are you can change your place of aboard you could change your location you could change your name you can change your appearance it doesn't change who you are on the inside you can change jobs you can change relationships you could change titles it doesn't change who you are so there was a man one time in a message have not I sent thee his name was Gideon paragraph 54 it says now Gideon when he was out there trash in his this week no doubt but that prophet's message was going through his heart what that Prophet said I'm the god of Abraham Isaac Jacob I'm the one that brought you out of Egypt I'm the one that give you what you've got turn to me there he and his father are there trashing this wheat and an angel came to him or he thought it was an angel it happened to turn out it wasn't an angel it was God himself CU it's capital l r d you see and when he spoke to Gideon Gideon was a little surprised and we know the story he said now Mighty Man of Valor he didn't know he was he was living in denial he didn't recognize who he was he didn't realize who the real Gideon was he thought he was just doing normal living he thought he was just going through the motions he was doing what he was taught he didn't know reality was he was a mighty man of Valor when he looked in the mirror of the word it said Mighty Man of Valor it wasn't what his brothers Tau it wasn't what the the the other tribes thought about his family it wasn't important what he was told what was important was what God had assigned to him God said thou Mighty Man of Valor he didn't know who he was and the prophet said maybe you don't know who you are you might be many of those Mighty Men tonight and I say right here tonight you might be Mighty Men of Valor it's a night setting here you're saying the little church small group like we gathered here tonight oh my there was only two there him and his daddy there only has to be two you and Christ that's all it takes to be a mighty man of Valor that's right now the first thing you know what happened as soon as he spoke to Gideon thou Mighty Man of Valor call him what he could do he said n Lord n Lord living in denial but you you know what it didn't change his reality his denial didn't change the reality of who he was the reality was he was a mighty man of [Applause] Valor but you know there are times when your circumstance causes you to forget I remember Jacob Jacob as we know he fooled his father to get the birth right we will say he out smart at his brother to get the birth right he say Jacob I love Esau I Jacob I love you love a smart man amen oh God so a smart man Hallelujah but you see after time sometimes you forget you forget what you did you forget what you went through the children of Israel did that all the time after a while the living was so good they forgot God they forgot what happened how he brought them up out how with a mighty hand he he he heard he you know he put his hands around them and and brought them out of the the bondage of the enemy sometimes they forget so Jacob was like that he had increase in his flux he had his family he had his his men around him he had such wealth and you know he he moved a particular way I could only imagine the way he operated he probably forgot he outsmarted somebody he probably forgot that he fooled his father he probably forgot what had transpired before but you know what there came a time and and in the message I'll get into the second it says as I thought on my ways yes when you think on your ways you kind of remember God sometimes triggers he he sends a stimuli to solicit or elicit a response from you amen so when he thought about it he realize wait a minute my brother Esau have great rich too he have family he have flock he have soldiers he have men he have servants he have things just like me and I have to meet him I can't avoid him I have to meet him so you know what I have to face reality I can't live in denial Hallelujah I can't operate like it didn't happen I need something more I need to be more sincere Hallelujah I need to be more open more vulnerable I need to be more aware I need to have such such a relationship with God that I have no fear that I could walk unbothered you know some people they walk with their head down all the time they walk because they realize guilt and shame and and embarrassment and things weigh on them but you want to be free you want to be loose if if you want to be loose tonight just lift your hands right now do something different because God is here to free you from bondage free you from guilt and shame and Circumstance and and things that that were told to you as a child things that that warp your mind things that have you confused and in paragraph 39 of that that message as I thought on my ways it says there might be many in here tonight is thinking about going home old age is catching up on you sickness has got you in a grip better think on your ways before you get there and as Jacob on his way with his wife and children he heard a message coming that Esau with a great answer was coming to meet him and he began to think on his ways the way he' done Esau cheated him and it drove him to prayer all night am you know if love doesn't do it conditions will so it drove him to prayer sure he might have prayed before but this kind of prayer was that kind of earnest prayer where you're driven to prayer it's not your choice you don't have a say in the matter you have to do it because his circumstance seems so dire you have to do it he wrestled with the angel of the Lord I trust tonight that men and women boys and girls who has neglected the baptism of the Holy Ghost you don't know how near you are to home and that applies to anybody I trust that you'll put purpose in your heart that you'll wrestle with the angel of the Lord and not let him go until you're blessed when the angel of the Lord touch Jacob he walked different from then on he was a big fine running coward on one side but a limping Prince on the other side of the brook you walk different you think different he wasn't afraid to meet Esau then because he had wrestled with the angel think on your ways amen I know I said it before don't want to song done done but in influence I think it says your circumstance doesn't Define you you know there are lots of people they they they make excuses based on where they are where they came from so they'll tell you I grew up in a hot spot I didn't know how my father was I don't know what love was I never had things as a child I had it tough I had I had a struggle all my life I had to fight for everything I have and sometimes they make excuses but get this once again I Don't Preach for my own thoughts I I I don't speak my own ideas and my opinions this is God's word amen so you know this already so I want you to say Amen because you know it already many years ago paragraph 62 in the message influence when they used to have slavery in the South you know where I'm going they down Kentucky and Alabama and down where I come from they used to take the color and auction them off at the auction block just like if you had used cars or something I believe no man is to be a slave God made man and man made slave and they used to come by and buy them just like you'll buy a used car get the bill of sale and so forth that was a terrible thing so there one day there was a buyer come by he came by a broker by a old plantation that had many slaves and said how many slaves yeah he said how many slaves you got he said oh around 150 out there I guess said could I go out and look over them he said sure help yourself so he went out and look over the slaves and when he looked around he noticed them fellows always they were sad now slavery wasn't a nice thing can you imagine working on the duress every day every day this wasn't a than God is Friday weekend thing every single day as the the night follows the day you were a slave you were forced to work and do things that otherwise you would not have done sometimes under the task Master's rule sometimes under real abhorent conditions somehow in the cold in the heat whatever the temperature was whatever the the climate the circumstance was you didn't have a choice in the matter because you was a slave and in this case when he went to look at them he noticed them fellows were always sad they the boys brought them over from Africa and unloaded them in Cuba out there and send them out here to the South and sold them for slaves and they knowed they'd never go back home you know what that's like to know that no matter what you will never see home again you will never go back home this was their reality this was their circumstance and they know they'd never go back home they know they'd never see their father and mother no more their children husband wives and so on they were a victim of circumstance that they didn't make themselves and here they was away from home and sad and sometimes they'd have to take whips and whip them just like they do a beast cattle and ox and horses and things and they to make them work they make them work and this they notice this young broker noticed there was one of those slaves they didn't have to whip him they didn't have to do it my he had his chin up his shoulders back he was really right on the mark all the time up to standard all the time he didn't pretend you know you know my father has a saying you always say he used to say across the board you are who you are across the board if you're late you're late if you're messy you're messy but this slave was different he made and met the mark all the time he had one standard one operation Hallelujah he said they didn't have to to be doing anything to him Hallelujah he had the job done so the owner of the slave said the broker said to this owner I'd like to buy that slave he said oh no said he's not for sale he said well why he ain't for sale said what you said what you do to make him that way why despite the fact that he came from circumstances that he wasn't in control of Hallelujah could any good thing come out of Nazareth could any good thing come out of lavant tail or cot or beat or Maloney or wherever from from some well-known hot spot right where they say you are prone to criminal activity no no no no no this person this slave despite his circumstance operated differently that's the way we are called we are in this world but not off this this world he came down listen God knew us he knew our faults our bad our our failes our shortcomings he came down in the dirt and in the mud to pick us up and still love us still send his son to shed his blood to redeem us to pay a price to set us free so we could have access to Redemption so we can be perfect so we can be adopted he went past all that and this show that despite the circumstance they asked listen do you feed them different than the rest of them he said no they all ate out in the galley they all were together he's just a slave he said what makes him act different than the rest of them he said and you know it say you know I often wonder that too till I found out right here in trinad there's a little portion of the Bride that know who they are and know Promises of God and by faith have stayed steadfast to his word and they anointed in season outer season it doesn't matter if it's Wednesday if it's Friday or if it's Sunday they worship the same it doesn't matter if it's two persons or 2,000 persons they still worship praise they still make a Joyful Noise the shout of the king is in the C they come with their shouting shoes on there's a Revival in their soul every morning every noon time they meditate on his word they pray without ceasing they fast they sanctify themselves they live a particular way they dress a particular way they act a particular way the pastor doesn't have to be there nobody have to be there to coax them and crank them and work them up they do this because they know who they are they know the real inside inside believer say is not dependent on how they feel or what they think they know who their father is they know why they they here they know why they came they know the promises applicable to their life in this case he say way back in Africa way back in his homeland in Africa where they came his father is King of the tribe we are royal priesthood holy nation we can't walk with our head now we can't walk depressed we can't walk Bas in our circumstance we have to operate by faith knowing that he's the king of kings he's the Lord of lords he's Mighty in battle he's our Shield he's our sword he's our buckler there's nothing that he can do he is bigger than your problems he is bigger than your challenges your mind can't even conceive or imagine what he has prepared for you way back in Africa his father in the home Homeland where he came from his father is King of the tribe and yet he's an alien far from home it doesn't matter where you go it doesn't matter what you've been through it doesn't matter where you came from you may be the only one in the office with a testimony you may the only one in your family you know way back before the foundation of the earth your father is the king you are royal priesthood which makes you the child of the king you are a child of God so you walk different you talk different they look at you and they think you're a weirdo they think you're fanatic it's not that it's you know the real you you know your father you know where you come from you know where you're going you know you're seeking a city who's maker and Builder is God you're not just wandering with every wind and Doctrine you're not just go to and through you're not just having itching ears trying to hear what's the latest what what it latest gossip all you have today are trying to look for some special excitement no but just like Noah said it will rain It Will Rain It Will Rain the word never fails line upon line precept upon precept we not looking for a a new ministry a a new word a new explanation no know he want to take the same word and make it more positive he want to accentuate it in your life so it becomes a reality when you know who you are nothing can stop you no matter what your position is you'll always be ready you always be able because he give you all the tools you need David didn't need five Stones he only needed one the other four F was back up it took one to defeat Goliath that's how you are tonight you know where you come from what ought Christians to do with sons and daughters of the king though we're aliens let's act like Sons and Daughters wom let your hair grow out quit wearing them clothes that you wear immoral and things man get back to where a man ought to be woo don't act like Sons act like Sons and Daughters of God You're an Alien here but remember we are sons of the king how many believe that [Applause] tonight amen amen amen amen in a message go tell he said listen listen if you didn't believe me hear this paragraph 87 he said in the Bible time so this is for the week of once now you you perhaps your your chest not out yet your chin not raised just yet he said in Bible times there was a jubilee year come so it didn't matter your age how long you're in slavery how hard you work if you was the best worker if you thought life was unfair there was a jubilee year come people that were sold out from the debts that they owed they owed a debt they couldn't pay it so they went and sold themselves to people for slaves and they had to their slave their bond slave all their life but every so often there came a day of Grace I say tonight this is a day of Grace what was known as Jubilee year when the Jubilee year was come then there went a priest out and sounded a trumpet that trumpet listen now listen now this trumpet denoted not to some to every slave amen everybody every slave it to every slave no matter how long he had been serving no matter how much longer he had to serve so you believe what you went through was a prison sentence the judge said life imprisonment but today is your Year of Jubilee it didn't matter what your sentence was you could go free tonight you could drop the tools tonight you say when that trumpet sounded that slave was made free he could lay down the hole and go home to his children he didn't have to work any longer because he was free when the Jubilee sounded that trumpet could listen it gave not an uncertain song but it give a certain song a song that could be recognized something that you knew before the foundation of the earth you knew that song like that Eagle's call you could respond to that and you had no choice but to go free and a man can lay down his instruments Go Home free from From Slavery Give the Lord a shout of Praise Hall amen amen thank you Jesus hallelu Oh My wow wow wow wow wow time is far spent just a few more I'll skip through just a few more the woman I the well so we pass that now the woman at the well she wasn't in denial she knew who she was she accepted her reality they say she was a woman of ill repute she didn't deny who she was you know she accepted her reality they said listen these men shouldn't speak to her but I'll read it but brandham said she rebuked Jesus she said listen you know you're not supposed to speak to us you shouldn't be speaking to woman like me you you know better than that I'll read it for you I will read it for you and in a message perseverance woo amen paragraph 64 the woman of the well she was out there ill Fame we established that already she not hiding ill Fame in a bad condition one day when Jesus come up to the well and saw her standing there and asked for a drink listen it says she scolded him said why you're a Jew you ask me such a thing as that you shouldn't be asking that why you know good and well you a young Jewish man ain't got no business asking me a Samaritan woman such a thing as that we don't have any dealings with one another so she Let it Loose one time she had attitude she accepted who she was she knew listen everybody say this about me I accept that everybody tell me I'm a loser everybody tell me yeah be no good you're a failure you'll never make it I accept that so you know better than to come to preach to me you know better than to come and challenge me and communicate with me but here here here what it says don't you know there's segregation where are you from anyhow don't ask me such a thing as that he looked her in her face and said but if you knew if you knew who you really [Applause] are I don't know if you understand the power of that question he asked for a subject my subject was do you know who you are right right so the title was the real you right and the subject was the question do you know who you are and that's the question that Jesus asked of this woman as we know as the woman at the well he says if you knew who you were speaking with you'd asked me for a drink or persistant he knowed where he was standing didn't he the father had sent him up there he need go through Samaria he had a job sometimes we wrapped up we wrapped up in position the circumstance may not be bad you know but we are brother Hallelujah we are doctor we are accountant and we are an entrepreneur and a business and we hide behind occupation we hide behind careers we hide behind suits and ties and we we paint on Smiles but Jesus is here to to shed that he's here to to tear those things away he's here to rip it off and say listen I need to come have a chat with you I want to pause your operation and I know you've been going a particular way and you don't really feel challenged but tonight I want you to just pause I know you feel a particular way about yourself but I'm here to tell you who you really are I'm here to expose the truth about you amen now it went on you say he stood there and we see him standing there very persistant he didn't take her insult it didn't matter what she said she looked at him and he began that she said why we worship in this mountain and you stay in Jerusalem and the conversation went on and he said go get your husband and you know it she said well I don't have any what are you asking me such a thing as that for so she challenge even his question she was bold she knew she was and she challenged Jesus himself he saidu you told the truth you had five and the one you're living with now is not yours par 65 oh brother that changed things tonight I pray that Jesus allows something to be said to change your perception to speak to your heart to speak to your circumstance wherever you are perhaps you're at home right now and you're wondering what God will do for you tonight and I I'm here to say he can meet your need wherever you are just have faith and believe he can speak to you tonight wherever you are he can touch you tonight everything could be changed tonight with one word when he said this Hallelujah he said that changed thing she stopped She stop the battle was over the debate was over the challenge was finished she said sir I perceive that you are Prophet now we haven't had one of them for many hundreds of years but we're Tau that we're going to get a messiah and when that Messiah comes he will be a prophet woo my my my he said I'm he that speaks with you oh did she get persistent she got perseverance now remember if anyone knows the Oriental Customs a woman of that Fame has no business telling men nothing that's right no sir they won't even listen to her a woman of ill faith coming down the street marked with ill Fame the man wouldn't have nothing to do with her that's right her voice is nothing but brother she got awful persistent she got the priests she got all of them she was determined they was going to know it didn't matter who you were it didn't matter if you were a man or a woman everybody had to know about this Jesus she said look in other words search your scriptures the man told me the things that I've done isn't this the very Messiah quiet in a voice if you could you try to quiet you see if you get a revelation tonight of who you are let your wife try to keep you quiet let your husband try to quiet you until you take it easy take it easy don't make so much noise now that jumping and shouting just oh gosh we live in gated community man what the neighbors will think man take it easy but listen hear what he said they say you couldn't quiet her she was persistent that is the Messiah there's our chance that's who we waiting on and there he stands and with that woman's tremendous persistency even the people in the city believed on it didn't they now come tell me what who am I where did I come from they didn't believe that the Persistence of that woman proved that he was a messiah and the Bible said and the people of that City believed on him because of the testimony of the woman she had struck fire I want fire to strike you tonight it's not who you are who you think you are but your persistence your faith your actions once God could reveal real who you are tonight nothing can stop you your neighbor your family your wayward son it doesn't matter what happened this morning my my my she's done everything in the cenda that's wrong now he said I can see a little old woman out in the streets she's done wrong we know that she's of ill Fame to say she's staggered in into a little Old Mission somewhere the paint and manicure all over her face sitting up there looking and saying I ain't fit to be in this place the first thing you know the Holy Ghost said I've chosen you oh stop her come to the door she keeps her head D in shame to go to the door the next day she can have a testimony that'll shake the shingles off the top of the house yeah she knows she struck the right thing that's it be persistent don't give up the muss can get [Applause] ready you know I just want to bring back a quote from last Sunday this particular quote touched me from adoption part one from last Sunday right here in headstone Tabernacle I believe it was such an inspired quote paragraph 111 1111 it says many people are afraid you're going to act funny after tonight you're not going to leave the same way you came you say you either live better or worse but not the same way you're not going to walk in here and walk back out the same way I came something is going to change something on the inside on the inside inside going to change and it says many people are afraid you're going to act funny many people are afraid the Holy Ghost will make you do something you you'll be ashamed of people many people are afraid they'll cry and their sweetheart will see them crying or mama or your neighbor or your boss will see you let me tell you about a man one time before closing there was a man named David you know it we heard it just suay when the Ark of God had been down in the Philistine land and had come across pulled by Ark old Ox was pulling them when David saw that AR coming he had a little G in him he ran out there he kicked his feet in the air and jumped around and screamed and jumped and danced and jumped and jumped and dance and him the king of Israel it didn't matter who he was it didn't matter what they refer to him as as king of Israel woo Hallelujah his wife looked she looked out the window out the window and saw him acting so strange like you tonight so strange she just despised him why she must have said the idiot the idiot look at him out there the way he's acting throwing his feet up in the air and jumping around and acting like that why he must be crazy like on the day of Pentecost they say there must be crazy those people went to headstone Tabernacle Wednesday night and they leave they must be crazy like you're sharing something in here like you're doing something different in here he must be crazy crazy woo and that night when he's coming she said in words like this perhaps very soft very soft he said why you've embarrassed me why you the king my husband out there doing like that acting like that acting like peasants acting like everybody else acting like like you don't know you are the king you don't know how respected we are how respectable we are how people look up on to us and listen listen he said why are you the king my husband out there acting like that David said David said hear what he said he said listen tomorrow I'll do better than that yes sir he said don't you know I was dancing unto the Lord he crossed over he was in the land of promise he had lost all self Styles and mock of the world he was so happy I'm happy tonight to know know that the ark was coming into his own City and oh I tell you some people's afraid to receive the Holy Ghost afraid that they might speak with tongues they're afraid that somebody would say now he's one of them tongues guys now he's one of them brandom guys now one he's one of them Headstone Guys no one he's one of them old fashioned guys now he is one of them ladies that go to hell long and wear long dresses this one of them they look kind of strange what kind of operation is that but he saying listen they're afraid to come to church and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ because they're ashamed of it oh somebody said I'll have to recall my tapes because I had preached of being baptized in the name of Jesus Christ I ain't recalling them I'm making more that's right making more that is the Bible if they don't like what we did yesterday just watch watch what we going to do tomorrow watch what's in store for tomorrow if you think tonight is something look for me tomorrow I Ain going to dance and and you look out the window I'm going to jump I'm going to shout I'm going to Rejoice because I see my name and I know who I am I know the promises that are left for me oh myo there's no end to it because it's of the lord it's God final quote my my my my Hallelujah as we wrap up I had so much more but it's the final quote I want you go home and meditate I want you to Rejoice I want you to shout and remember this as we get ready to leave in in a message without money or without price brother brandham said paragraph 121 the prodical son in closing I might say this when he had wasted all his living we know the story The Father's living with writers living and when he was returning home he was laying in a pig pen and listen to these words he come to himself you know what that means he recognized who he was he understood that he wasn't defined by where he was he might have been seen in a pig sty eating pig food that didn't make him a pig amen as it say you standing in a garage doesn't make you a car amen so he may have been out of position but he was a son once a son always a son it didn't matter where he went where he was he was always a son and when he come unto himself he said how many hired servants my father has got that has got enough to spare and here I am dying for want what if he tried to say wonder if I got some money I could pay dad back what I spent you know running around but he knew the nature of his father and he said I will arise and go to my father the father said wait a minute son are you going to repay me with interest you know how embarrassing it was to read about you on the papers you know you are all over the Internet you know there are videos and and and pictures and and things of you that that we can't can't erase you know what you've done how are you going to repay me for for this kind of emotional distress and I had to to explain to the neighbors that we don't really talk much that I I didn't know what was going on with you no no no no no no no that was not his father's approach he never said wait a minute are you bringing my money back no he never charged him for his sins he was glad that he was coming back he was glad he had come to himself and recognized who he was and he said I have sinned before God before my father I will arise and go to him and when he saw him this is speaking of the father when he looked a far off and he saw him woo he was glad he was on his road home amen now he didn't endorse his sin he didn't endorse what he had done God doesn't like when we have unbelief and we express the characteristics of sin when we doubt his word and had distracted and and lose our Focus he doesn't endorse that but he was so glad when you make the decision to come home to follow Jesus to have in your heart a desire to not turn back he's so glad when you make that decision to arise and go to him when he saw him a far off the father ran to him him and kissed him he said kill the fatted Cal without money bring the best robe without money bring the ring without money put it upon his finger Let Us Eat Drink be merried for this is my son that was lost and is now found he was dead and he's alive again woo hallelujah hallelujah hallu he
