equal intimidating I was really blessed at home I was actually shouting uh because I know that it will take this uh attitude and as a mindset and an attitude to get through in this hour you cannot just let things Okay so so there's a difference between a Driftwood and a guided boat a boat to be guided has to be shaped and then you put an engine to it and you can direct it a Driftwood just drift with everybody else whever the breeze going you going with it too that makes no sense if there ever was an hour where you have to get back in charge of your ship or your boat or your thoughts or your thinking the birds will come and your head you know but don't let them Camp there you have to get that out because you're looking to get the mind of Christ always have a attitude God what is your mind concerning this concerning that always ask that question not just what you want to do and what you choose but what is your mind concerning this what is your mind concerning that rewards God's mind amen praise the Lord blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah so I was very really blessed moving on offensive no longer passive defensive you have to praise God you have to keep you have to keep up with the horses you have to keep up with the horsemen be exhaled from meeting if you can't cannot keep up with the horsemen you can't keep up with horses and some people are keeping up they're lagging behind so um this morning we have a special table I to play for you uh this is a message I preach in Miami where I recently come from uh it's uh Eagles Temple Church and the pastor there is our brother Bernard uh uh uh uh Mary foret je Mari je Mar yeah amen and um but I just want to give you update on the man that got the brain inter face remember sometime I spoke about the intelligence and they inserted this brain interface thing inside the man brain he's doing good they say that's what they say but right now he could move the mouse with his thoughts so he could move the computer mouse with his thoughts that is where man have reached there's so much that we could say on these things but I can't we just go to to much like this morning I was telling my wife that they have an instrument now that could measure the process of they call it the the production of words so they have particular parts of the brain where they could tell you where the vows coming from a the consonant it's insane and how the child actually produces words and it's not the same place in listening and and and and and and speaking and so like that so when but they talking their scientific talk and I watching this amazing God that they still try to figure out how he does his stuff and he put all that intelligence and that mind in us to be be like him amen and we could mess up but we don't want to mess up this morning we want to catch the mind of Christ amen so this morning the message that we have for you is the spoken word the written word and the Living Word so what a shame we want to go straight into it and then trust that it be a blessing to you I was a blessing to me being dear and the Believers there and I trust and I know it will be a blessing to you this morning so let's go straight in that message right now blessed be the name of the Lord he only believe only believe and only believe only believe amen only be [Music] all things are POS only [Music] be [Music]

backsliding heart may you revive the Believers and you being a fresh anointing of Dynamics to their mechanics mechan granted God in Jesus name I ask it amen so if you have your Bibles I'd like to read from St John chapter 1 we want to read from 1 to 4 11 to 14 we also want to go to St John chapter 5 we want to read verse 36 to 40 and then we we want to go to Luke 4 read in 16 to 21 so we go to St John 1 in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God the same was in the beginning with God all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made in him was life and the life was the light of men we want to go down to verse 11 he came unto his own and his own receive him not but as many as receive him to them give you power to become the sons of God even to them that believe on his name which were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but of God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory as of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth John 5:36 Jesus speaks but I have a greater witness than that of John for The Works which the father had given me to finish the same works that I do bear witness of me that the father had sent me and the father himself which had sent me had borne witness of me ye have neither heard his voice at any time nor seen his shape and he have not his word abiding in you for whom he had sent him you believe not search the scriptures for in them you think you have e a life but they are they which testify of me and you will not come to me that you might have life and our last scripture from Luke 4 reading verse [Music] 16s and he came to Nazareth where he had been brought up and as his custom was he went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day and stood up for to read and it was delivered unto him the book of the prophet isas and when he had opened the book he found the place where it was written the spirit of the Lord is upon me because he has anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach Deliverance to the captives the recovering of the sight of the blind to set at Liberty them that are bruised to preach the acceptable year of the Lord and he closed the book and he give it again to the minister and sat down and the eyes of all them that were the synagogue were fastened on him and he began to say unto them this day this scripture is fulfilling your ear may God bless his word you may be [Music] seated oh blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah hallelujah it's good to be here see all of you out this morning we here to Worship the Lord and that's what God wants he wants his people to worship him that is what makes him God object of worship I have a title this morning the spoken word the written word The Living Word that's the title this morning the spoken word the written word The Living Word I have an inspiration a live voice the Thunder that shakes the devil a live voice Thunder that shakes the devil okay now before we get into that just want to feel to share this with you and brother Bram was talking about a woman who felt that she was about to die and he was speaking to her he said I want you to do this and this is to show you it will take your individual Faith so he was saying this I want you to do this you are short to die if you remain in the condition you are now you can't live but a little while even your doctor knows that now you have got to do this lady you have got to get above that your way of thinking you are down here thinking that you are going but you have got to rise up here where you think you're going to stay you have got to get above it as a man think it in his heart so is he but if you want to call it psychology but it is whatever you want to say it's the truth the thing of it is you can't come up here unless you got faith in something that will bring you here as the lepers said in the gate why do we sit here till we die if we go in the city we will die if we stay here we will die if we go to the Samaran they will kill us and you know what they did they went to the enemy camp and save themselves so but Bram is speaking to this lady now you are not invited to go to the enemy's Camp you invited to the father's house he is waiting for you so he is ministering to this woman and he said will you believe Lady it's your life as his Prophet I can tell you what started it and it just turns black in front of me oh this is the part I want to get it's lay according to your faith I can't have faith for you no more than just as long as my gift will carry what I'm talking about but it takes your individual Faith like anyone else so if if you have to get anything from God this morning it will take your individual faith that you could raise up whatever condition you're in this morning you can raise up above whatever condition you are in this morning the devil is a liar how do we know every time he open his mouth he's a lying this morning you can be sealed you can be healed you can be delivered you can be restored you can be forgiven you can get that breakthrough you can break off from whever you are hallelujah hallelujah you can go free this morning oh glory to God hallelujah hallelujah praise God so then M said you must throw aside everything and grind into it believe God to make that evil leave you and it will be gone from you it'll rise up you will rise up in strength I have seen big strong healthy women and eat up with cancer and they are now living because they had faith in God so when the devil want to cut you off prematurely when the devil want to cut you off before your time your Fai could back him up your faith could push him back and I'm not just talking about death the devil try to cut out all your blessings the devil want to close doors for you but your fa this morning could open up those door Oh Glory to God what are you saying God will make a way for you glory to God you praise God praise Hallelujah hallu so brother Bram he said watch he said you must believe it regard You Must Believe regardless of anything you never go by your feeling never go by your feeling remember Friday night God Is Not A Feeling God is the word God is Not tears God is the word God is not I am tired God is the word Oh Glory to God hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah listen to this he began to pray say Lord Jesus bless this woman who I lay hands on and I say to this evil spirit you are exposed God rebuke thee in the name of his son Jesus Christ he said now rise up to your feet and raise your hands never tell them sit down tell them rise up to your feet you just get healed yet rise up and give God some Praises God just touch you there rise up and give God some praises of God we are not here to entertain you we are not here to lecture you we are here to worship with you oh give the Lord some Praises hallelujah hallelujah Glory listen to this sometimes evil spirits want to hold on and it is Left To The People's Faith now here this they have to leave in the presence in the presence and that's why the devil has fought Worship in the church for years that's why the devil fought creating an atmosphere because the devil have to leave in presence but when the devil leaves and you walk out those doors Faith wow is what will keep him off Give the Lord some Praises but the devil he wants to hold on to you with cancer with humor with sickness with diabetes but God want to heal you his desire is for you to be healed you to be free to worship God the beauty of Holiness oh give the Lord some praises hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah Glory all right okay let's go the scripture we read in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God but then the Bible went on to say and the word became flesh and dwell Among Us brother Bram the very substance of God was made flesh and dwell Among Us the great spirit of God which no man could approach which no man had seen was no Tabernacle in flesh that's why Jesus told them you have not seen his form heard his voice search the scriptures in other words search the written words search the Scrolls they testify of me now the reason we have Scriptures it is because it come from the spoken word and the spoken word came because when the people said don't let Moses speak let God speak because Thunders and lightning was on the mountain God say okay okay I'm going to Veil myself in men I'm going to send prophets and there will be my mie so Jesus quoted the Bible when he told the devil man shall live by PR the but by every word which proceed out of the mouth of God so the spoken word The Original Seed came from the mouth of By His prophets and the spoken word became the written word which is the scriptures and the word is God the spoken word is God and the WR word is God and the written word is God in print if you want to know God's will God's purpose God's intent for your life you can find it in the scriptures and Jesus he told them search the courtes search the scriptures search your schols they and day that testify of me glory to God so the spoken word became the written word and this written word is to become the Living Word glory to God do you see objective is not for it to remain spoken with God's objective is not to be just written with but God's objective is for that word to become flesh in you in you this morning that word to become the living glory to God hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory to God so only by Revelation only by revelation of the words through the prophet God declares his word and that word declar is taken from a Greek root word which means to thoroughly explain and made clear you know I he pastors and preachers makes things so complex but brother Bram said from Genesis to Revelation could be described in three words word made flesh God was so mysterious he was so mysterious he wanted to simplify himself because we cannot understand who he is and how he lives so he had to simplify himself so all that complexity come down in Simplicity when the word became flesh so the Bible say without controversy without argument great is the mystery of godliness Oh Glory to God do you believe that so in the beginning what's the word word Loos speech he said we have looked our hands have handled for the life was manifested and we have seen it and bear witness of it and this life was that was manifested to us which we have seen and heard declare we unto you and we have fellowship with and truly our fellowship is with the father and with his son Jesus Christ so when God was truly revealed he was manifested in the flesh Oh Glory to God so the letter is here we talk about divine revelation is truly revealed that he's walking Among Us he living among us Revelation is not only text or scripture Revelation is the unveiling of God God back on the earth The Living Word Oh Glory to God hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah listen to this brother lived so much like Jesus they thought he was Jesus glory to God hallelujah Hallelujah I'm not talking about the seals and the Mysteries and the revelations I'm not talking about that I'm talking about what was veil in him even friends oh hallelujah hallelujah and when he said good evening friends God failed again in a prophet that same God will be veiled again in a pride whether you're ready or not you ready or not it's going to happen right in front of you hallelujah hallelujah listen to this after Jesus encounter Lucifer in a private encounter in the desert and he overcome the devil lot of the eyes lust of the flesh pride of life just these three things that are in the world lust of the eyes lust of the flesh pride of life and Jesus private an add not Jes Jesus and the pastor Jesus alone private test on the back side and he it is written it is written it is also written so Jesus he give the devil the written word he was the living Jesus he was the Living Word he give the devil the written word it is written it is written it is also written do you know why Jesus didn't have the authority to reveal himself to no devil Jesus he come to reveal himself to his wife that is why the devil said if be if be if be he didn't know who he is Jesus could have tell the devil I am the Lord Jesus but he didn't do that this Revelation is for you the Revelation not for the devil this Revelation it's for you so he give the devil a written word it is written it is written it is written question if you don't know what is written how could you tell the devil what is written you got to know what is WR you have got to know what is in your Bible what is on the books what on the know a devil on you young you young men because you are strong the glory to God Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah glory to God oh Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah to God amen amen so do you get up now when God is truly revealed you see the there are so much emphasis on Revelation of text or unfolding of why theet that is fine an explanation about this explanation about that in the beginning was hallelujah hallelujah the word came in the beginning let's go right with me but before the beginning Spirit Hallelujah am Hallelujah hallu so in the beginning was the word but before the beginning was thoughts was mind was Elohim was Intelligence was the spirit before there was a moon before there was a star before there was a m you were in his stinking before the word Oh Glory to God you were in his thoughts because the devil he came in the beginning he was created in the beginning but you was before the beginning was in God's God so this morning you have senority over the devil he only come in the beginning you were before the beginning you are attribute son of thinking Hallelujah a gene thought in the mind of God hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory to God hallelujah hallelujah all right let's go Jesus was upon the Earth he said beli th not I'm in my father and the father I speak unto you I speak not of myself but the father that dwelleth in me he d The Works you say here it is evidently set forth the perfect manifestation of God in the son was by the IND dwell in spirit manifested in word and words so Jesus wasn't just talking Mysteries he was bringing words and works so Paul said it this way I came to you not with enticing words of man's Wisdom that your faith your faith may not rest on the wisdom of man but in the power of God so he was identifying that this gospel is not word only which is text or spoken word or written word but gospel is power and demonstration the Lord sh glory to God so the word the prophet said the word is a seed of the Gospel Oh Glory to God do you get that this written word spoken word is a seed of the Gospel but the gospel when it is preached it is

in hell he saw them with the makeup what the woman have now he saw that as a Young Man and later on in life and he saw the woman with all this stuff you know what he said the LD of hell has been uncovered and of demon power is loose on the in your human self you can't fight those demon his demon powers his demonic powers you can't fight that so to combat that to combat hell on Earth seven angels seven angels come from eternity with s back Wings to bring Heaven down on the Earth and Heaven consist of the word them seven angels brought the word brought a third pull p you out you didn't

this now did you notice that Jesus said the world not receive the Holy Ghost neither could they receive the word because the spirit and the word are one if you have the Holy Spirit as the prophets the word will come to you you mean the W comes to the bride oh Hallelujah huj because the word is your husband is your mate what word to reveal word so when the prophet took the Bible and reveal it it's revealed Christ to reveal word Christ your husband coming to you glory to remember the object of sending this prophet get that to God brother here again we find the word coming because the spirit of God in John 16 how be it when he the spirit of Truth is so truth is not just text word it has the spirit of trth because the truth is a person I am the way the truth and the life so the truth is more than t a man could tell his wife I love you but that's words you understand that his heart and the spirit is not dear to back up these words I love you I talk that is words remember the prophet talk about a man kiss his wife all the neighbor kiss his wife but the Habit is in front neighbors and then when he drive a little bit he come back home and and then he tell her he love and then he kiss her the second one was the real one the first one was entertainment acting Don't Be Hollywood inside of don't act be real To God Be Real oh God God want [Applause] real amen hallelujah hallelujah the Bible said Jacob I love Jacob was a tough guy he tricken everybody but God said I love that man and to show how sincere he was when the angel ask him who are you Jacob didn't say I'm not so bad I just go to church Tabernacle [Music] I am a trickster Jacob [Music] I Che I know now you know who you are I could change you I will not let you go I will not let you go till you bless me and Jacob r all night Lord God help me this hallelujah hallelujah I'm preing myself happy glory to God I'm having time Jac all night long oh glory to God you see when you make a word when the word come out your mouth God has take it at your word so when Jacob said I will not let you go my God the angel r with right he was desperate because Jacob knew he feared his brother he know he had fears no when finished with the angel he wasn't walking normal walking with a limp like a broken man nobody like to walk that way people like the show thatc broken up he's a prince he have power with God he a walking straight but he's broken and when God break you he can use you when God break you he can anoint you when God break you he can bless you all Fe gone he is ready and that bride his wife make Oh Glory to God the prophet said he shall not speak of himself talk about the Holy Ghost the spirit bringing the word of Prophecy hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelu now the proof of the indwelling spirit was to acknowledge and follow what God's Prophet get for the the evidence of a spiritful Christian is not to produce the truth but to receive the truth to believe it and Obey it have you noticed in Revelation 2217 the spirit and the bright say come let him hear it say come see the bride speaks the same word as does the spirit she is a word bride proven she has the spirit so that's why the prophet said the spirit the prophet and the bride will say the same thing oh Blessed Be of the Lord glory to God so watch this now before the beginning Elohim Spirit thinking thoughts in the beginning the word the logos the expression of el thought the theophany The Living Word the back part of the man that mes s so watch now so the word of the Lord spoken word came to Jeremiah and Isaiah that was the spoken word and then the word came un Jeremiah next the written word God in print and that's why Jesus told them s the scriptures but then he said as powerful the scriptures them you think you have eternal life but then Jesus said this you would not come to me to get life so he was tell them you have the books you have the tapes you think you have life but I am the Living Word because in him was life and the life was the light of men so he was saying you have the text you have the written word but you are not coming to The Living Word that you might have life oh give the Lord some Praises now watch this the Rich Young Ruler that young man that Jesus loved he came to Jesus good Master what shall I do etal life and Jesus give him the text the written word of your neighbor the Commandments that's written and the guy said all these things have I kept for my youth what lack I yet what am I missing Jesus the word a discerner going down behind his seeing into his heart seeing the lust for money seeing how he doesn't share don't give he said here what to get that demon off you give all sell all that you have that spirit will leave you and the Bible said young man walk s the Bible said Jesus loved him but you see he was keeping text but the heart didn't have the text in it the word wasn't living the word wasn't alive because Jesus didn't want him to lose everything he wanted to get rid of that demon of selfishness and not given compare that man to Cornelius and Cornelius was a man a gentile giv giving always helping somebody and God bless Cornelius is given in so much you had to send for Peter at that time Peter was the Living Word Peter who walk with Jesus under Jesus ministry preaching for three and a half years the Capstone of that Ministry was Peter deny Christ because the comforter wasn't yet in him so when they see Jesus on the cross good oh if my master could get Li if they could kill him they will kill me too I sign up for that I sign up for that they say yeah you temp Peter deny he was in service he Deni Christ three times he wept but Jesus told him already the devil want to sift you like wheat but I pray that your faith fail not but after you are converted strengthen the Breen so Peter knew he was a seed though he failed though he fell he knew he was a son so when the Holy Ghost came upon him in the upper room change man all together oh glory to God when Cornelius sent for Peter and Peter to testify what the prophet says Oh Glory to God Peter was in the body and life can only come from the body so why Peter was speaking the word the Holy Ghost fell and F Cornelius and he wasn't even baptized come to one chch service but his heart was right his heart was right if your heart is right God knows what going to happen oh glory to God hallelujah so we have the scriptures the spoken word living word amen then back to the spirit El the object of the Gospel is to bring you to become the Living Word if you become the Living Word you can found you can close the book you can say the spirit is upon me isn't that right for he has anointed me and the bride will find the place what place Revelation 227 the spirit and the bride do you understand scripture that the bride will have a voice the spirit coming upon the bride will give the bride a voice to say come to your family come to your loved ones you unsaved family out there and theyed to come through you by the word from your mouth God ordained it that way not by a book not by a tape but by you bride have a Ministry you have a Ministry this last chur have a Ministry the ministry is not sit in church you have to still go out they get your Fallen brother they got your Fallen sister you can sit here the rest have to come one day that last name in the book will be called then the book of is closed that is Judgment his lightning his Thunders earthquakes going to be rocking but the bride going to be ready his wife had made herself ready Oh Glory to God oh glory to God so listen you could put a suit on a pig you can keep the pig in the house have the P like a a pet put cologne on that pig the pig will behave itself as long as it's in the house but open the door and let that pig that pig will forget the B that pig will forget all the nice carpet in the house and go straight for the mud you know why it's a pig it's a pig a pig is a pig and when you have the nature of a pig you would live like a pig God did make you above the animals give make you a little L than the Angels don't live like an animal don't act like an animal live like God see you a little ler than the angel he call it to be a higher life and to change from that pig nature to the nature of a lamb is that right question why did Jesus choose men who did not know the scripture why did Jesus choose men who couldn't read or write why because Jesus understood that divine revelation by passes the mind and comes into the heart do you get that Jesus understood that divine revelation pass the mind and drop down into the heart that's why Jesus said who do men say I am men is talking about me men saying this and saying that but who do you say I am you are with me for three and a half years tell me your revelation of who I am and they didn't know they walking with a man I don't know who that man ising with man and have no Revelation that man and all of a sudden Peter said th the Christ the son of the Living God oh Jesus Jesus said Flesh and Blood have not revealed unto you but my father who is the spirit who is eloh he have revealed it and when God give you a revelation it's to the individual it's not to the church it's not to the person next to you it's to you individual indivual Revelation re is always to an individual hallelujah [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah do you get that church do you get that Revelation is to the individual look at that man following Elijah Elisha he says stay here you know some people say the prophet told me stay here and I am not moving that man have no Revelation he moving from G stay here he say the Lord stay here you know why that young man El the him it he felt something he said I want more of that I want more of that where that come from I want more that I will not let you go listen the school of the Prophet Brethren Prophet Breen no you not that your master will be taking on you today he yeah I know hold your pce shut up don't tell me what I am to do I have revelation hold your and he went to the next step stay here said no our next Minister 40 years in the message the prophet but this young man this young man when he cross J that was a test Jero Jero betel and so on is to bring to Jordan J represents death when he Cross Jordan never tell him stay here he said what do you want me to do for you what do you want me watch Revelation that young man say I want to be like you he said give me double I want double for the trouble I want double to deal with what's coming on ask a hard thing and the prophet said we need to ask for hard things asking for too much easy things let's trouble god let's ask God for big things for great things let's have a big Vision what God want us to do how God want us to do oh glory to God Elijah told him if you see me go you're going to have it so he be magazine watching magazine watching Facebook on WhatsApp no he is focused if you see me go I'm watching right here I'm watching I'm watching and he saw the Chariot El Elijah down the mant GL you have the mant now oh glory to God thank you Lord for the mantle wait a minute feel no differ am I fight all these time to come this watch something they didn't come by boat across Jordan have no no no close up there he c a revelation wait a minute it's not the mantle is the of Elijah where is the lordy to God took the and struck the Jordan where is that God with that Prophet where is the Lord [Music] [Applause] [Music] andu the Jordan and J open up and all the Brethren they looking you because they know when they see him coming back they say the spirit of elij rest upon elij and when this Bri come back Same Spirit that Prophet going to be upon the to the Lord some prais that same Spirit going to be upon you hallelujah hallelujah oh glory to God hallelujah hallelujah huj Glory Glory Glory oh let's go and this here is thing I believe from P we talk about there two systems that work Jacob one after the spirit one after the flesh then he said this these men if they pick it up and go out with it and make more sense to it to see talking about I'm only trying to lay the seed he's prophesying about men coming after if these men go out with it you can make more sense to it people stop there and they trying to explain way the prophet message that is not where it stops if they can make more sense to bring it to a place where I just want to L this SE then hope they make it come to life now son of man is the S Luke 173 son of man being revealed means by the Bram he is bringing seeds Okay he brought these seeds and these seeds are Spirit In seed [Music] form am when the Dynamics in the pente Manifest tongues some signs and gifts and we are not Pentecostal God bring the seed that the seed going to be in you and the spirit coming to work the seed in you so God not using you using the seed in you the word in you the secret is the word is in the these promises being preached coming into you and God know what he said to that prophet God who spoke to that Prophet know what the prophet said and God will know if we are saying what the prophet said because what the prophet said wasn't an idea wasn't a thought of his own thinking what he brought What Spirit spoke a word Spirit given words what he brought original SE did you get that what came out his mouth his Original Seed for you and I and God the spoken word is the original seed to come into the bride Oh Glory to God so he said he hope that these men will bring these SE to life do you know what I'm looking for here this morning I'm looking for these seeds the life Oh Glory to God hallelujah hallelujah brother you see why I been so zealous of the kind of seed I planted for the body the rain is going to fall pretty soon now I mean the real rain so hanging over you to this morning is a prophecy of real reing to come to manifest your SE Oh Glory to God now watch this but the word of God has been sown also are you ready Church prophecy and when the spirit of God begins to fall the word of God would live in the people so right now you are comforted prom word you are comforted by what God promised note when Elohim came to Abraham he didn't manifest anything yet said I come to encourage you I come to tell you that I will return you're whole for 25 years I come to tell you it's not long again that you'll be changed you Sarah going to be changed to produce that son isn't that right so the prophet said it here now the word of God has been shown this is not if this is when when the spirit of God begins to fall the word will live in the people and that false bride the solar birth right will reap what a confederation of churches but the word that have been sown into the people's heart would reap UPR for Jesus Christ so the Council of churches is also waiting for rain because the cons of churches was is a seed do you understand all the seeds Angel sinking what's going on in Rome that's a seed water have to fall on every seed to bring it to pass all right let me head the home stretch here now brother BR the biggest part of our faith is mental FEI by hearing the word it brings us into a mental recognition of God when the Holy Spirit comes in it into a Godly [Music] and it becomes a spiritual Revelation now the faith that Jesus was speaking about he he my words and believe doesn't come from intellectual faith it comes from a born again experience is a man heart intellectual Faith reason with God's word but a born again experience from the heart but say it's God will is right we have gotten away from the real old time experience of receiving the Holy Spirit It Isn't So Much intellectual but something that happened down here that changed that man it changed his motives it changes ideas it changes life Romans 10 10 17 so then Faith come by hearing and hearing by the word of God we know that one right come by hearing and hearing by the word of God but here what the prophet said you and usually people who have faith are people who have experience experience brings faith God have to give experience for fa to come alive that's what to David God gave him an experience with the lion private experience God give him my experience with the bill private experience I know God is's about to take David from the back and bring him to the front how does God do that by asking his father to carry some some bread some some some to eat to his brothers so little David unqualified for the Army he goes up to the Brethren I said my father send this for you de attitude what you doing here what happened to the Sheep back home you come to see the battle no battle going on these brother sh [Music] sword the polishing shoes looking at gol every morning gol says send me a man to fight me and everybody frighten

kill a lion GL to send somebody he said son this Amo was just made musk Des this armor this is a special arm he he put it on to fight no devil he give me to F put it on like some kind of Rob walking walking like this D say this thing can't work this can't work I have to use what God give me I have to use what God give me to be Who I Am David David got five Stones he need one but he took five he catch that say I am David only one you have backups you have five and he ran to meet Goliath he was so confident he didn't walk he ran ran to meet Goliath glory to God gol saw him embarrassed do you know who I am that is who you're going to send that little boy I'm going to feed him with the bird and David without the sword I cut your head off prophecy ver say prophecy and the bride with the prophesy according to Revelation 10 81 prophesy Again David R to go and he began to pick up a stove and the was like a living Target he's so big he walking one way coming in a straight line and David start like that and the prophet said if we get start God will do the rest if we can't get Eagle temper Eagle temper let's get started this morning God will do the rest and when David to the Holy Spirit take a hold upon his hand and let go that sto Give the Lord some Praises that stone was a guided missile anyway head was going that stone was going to anyway we know the story Was Defeated oh my that was not intellectual F that was a real Revelation let me tell you friends Ready or Not Go is coming Oh Glory to the your goath is coming Get Ready Get Ready Get Ready Get ready everybody have a go everyone of a go to deal with the Lord I shout the Get Ready Get Ready Get Ready Get Ready Get Ready Get [Applause] Ready Glory Glory Prophet speaks he cried out to this AG you have the word you have more Bible than ever you are not doing anything about the word except dividing and hacking it into pieces taking what you want leaving out what you want you are not interested in living it but debating it talk about the only only fight they have argument the weapon they have oh my let SK down here hallelujah oh Hallelujah but but I'm say what is by by strife and argument nothing has been overcome by Strife of words each one CHS as please and kill time disproving the views of others of the new birth and how a man is to be changed according to to Second Peter 1 scarcely anything is said I'm almost I'm going to skip only one thing is needful return to Christ looking to Christ as the only leader why do these message men try to parade itself as message popes and you have to come to them and you have to hear them and you have to go to the church and everything else why do these men power influence and control there are only there's only one life that's Christ but death comes to us in Thousand form now watch this here Paul when he came face to face with that word it quickened come to life Moses never came to life until the light struck him so Moses he was taught by his mother Moses he had the spoken word from his mother's mouth that he's a special child and he is to be delivered he took it intellectually one man and run out of Egypt and never look at Egyptian Pap for 40 years you don't want text WhatsApp Facebook nothing from egyp nothing from Egypt and God wait him out until he's relaxed he has a wife he has a family he's buying furniture and one day when he about to buy his fresh furniture and his wife waiting for furniture he saw fire in the mountain where we know the story when fire hit Moses like that five minutes in the presence of that fire taught Moses more than all the years he was in Egypt and for our young people all young people 5 minutes in the presence of that fire everyone it will change your walk it will change your talk it wouldn't be resting on mommy's experience's experience they will have their own experience when Moses spoke back and he spoke back to Moses it brought his SE to lifeam said this prophecy the body is waiting which is the word waiting for the life which is the spirit to confirm it or making alive no other life will work in her she can't come to life no other way you sit in this Tabernacle you have listened to tapes I'm still reading and yet the spirit has never quickened you till you can come and follow the word of God you wom and Men could obey every word so the spirit correctly brings you into obedience I'm not talking about coming to church now anybody can come to church but when the spirit bring the word to you it's to bring you into obedience to his will and purpose for your life to God amen amen amen hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh glory to God almost done said Moses he was the Living Word to the people and today the people that have veiled are the same things they are written Epistles Epistles that have been written and that makes you the Living Word so here the prophecy you have got to get these are will words now you have got to get the Living Word in you to have the Living God in you because the word here is God when it is made flesh in you and made spirit and life in you when it goes into your flesh and your faith and becomes life so this word have to go in your flesh and your faith and it becomes life Oh Glory to God then you are God's living word representative the so the Bible is manifested again like in the early days of Christ are you church because you are a predestinated seed just like Christ was and when the rain falls on the seed the life will produce when the Holy Spirit fall so the main thing make sure that seed is in you then the prophet said these disciples 120 of them almost done they called themselves into the upper room these seeds the word the word was laying there without life in it he call it dry seeds went into the upper room you know why the door were shut they were afraid they were afraid under a promise but afraid under a promise but they scared of this and scared of that then all of a sudden the song from Heaven as the waters begin to gush down and the seeds begin to grow oh my amen hallelujah Hallelujah by the living presence Pres by The Living Word living presence is a personal Vindication his his presence in the individual with a personal Vindication of himself expressing himself only in an individual individ never in a group no group amen not in a group his identification is with an individual you get that there be two in a bed one taken Hallelujah this is serious don't just take it for granted don't take for granted you in this church they going to just work out no the kingdom is preached and Every Man Press their way to it my oh my oh my just let me SK all here now the voice of the throne Before the Throne was Seven Stars not one voice voices what was it God speaking to the church reflecting himself through the seven spirits M come please when the true anointed of God speaks it's the voice of God so I'm not your pastor your pastor is brother but guess what any man of God that comes here truly anointed and speaks by the unction of God that is God speaking you can say I'm not going to bother with what that man say you can only receive god with your pastor God doesn't work that way he could use a donkey he could use a sister he could use a unbeliever he could use anybody to speak to you God glory to because he is God all by himself oh give the Lord some prais hallelujah hallelujah so when the two anointed of God speaks is the voice of God to reject it is to move the con now everybody can't be a preacher but you got a voice if you can't preach to people if you're a preacher you're called to the puet to preach if you're not a preacher but live the people of sermon let your sermon be lived and it's the voice of God that will bring the reproach to them who reject it so sermon is a voice not just spoken talk I live they can say no one can put a finger on his or whole life if there ever was a man of God it's that man or that woman see live your sermon don't TR preach them if you're not called to be a preacher you will get mixed up and messed up you will get people Tangled Up you will ruin them on yourself just live yourself the preacher is called to preach his and
