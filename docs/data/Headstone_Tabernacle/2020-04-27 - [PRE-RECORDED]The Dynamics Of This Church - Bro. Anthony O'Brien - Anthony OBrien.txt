and I have a title this morning a man and it's from a quote from the Prophet a man that he preached and we know it's very familiar to us but for some reason well I know it's the Spirit of the Lord and you know reports speak something to you he just annoying sit he knows how to bring it out and since Sunday there's enough coal just stirring in my mind and by the grace of God I've been able to see some things here that garage pointing us to and so this and my title is the dynamics of this church that's my title Eman the dynamics of this church now and every church had its dynamics Lutheran well Luther had the mechanics and dynamics isn't all right Wesley had their mechanics and dynamics for their day but we are promised mechanics and dynamics for our day and the Prophet clearly identified what was gonna be the dynamics for this church a many man is now right what was gonna take us to the rapture what was gonna take us to the skies Amen he clearly identified it a man on this message here what shall I do with Jesus called a Christ he said there you are he said that's the hour that we've arrived at and that's the big machine that is set up he was talking about denominations and he was talking about the and her and her daughter's is narang and all the religion in organized is now right and as Luther came and as he left they organized and prophet said when they organized the pillar fire moved right on out because you can't pine the Holy Ghost to any creed or talk man praise God you can't box Gordon put God a little box and pull him where you want to no no no no you can't do that to God as soon as God realize he's no longer welcome here move right on out hallelujah hallelujah his name you can't talk Scot down if God wants to fill somebody today hey man he's suffering to do so hallelujah could do anything he wants to he is caught he said and I changed not he said and if he fell a man yesterday he'll do the same today you do the same for you if God delivered daughters who affects with unclean spirits how much more God today could deliver your daughter your son whosoever praise God I don't care who it is I don't care where it is the voice of God could break past nations oh oh if you're faking reach out to spawn and touch the thought of the unseen I believe God is able this more to do more than you could ever expect Oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah and you're willing to comprehend forget about your mind is small forget about your intellect forget about your human reason and we're gonna talk about Jesus let's talk about Jesus the King of Kings the Lord of lords let's blow a trumpet this morning a blast out all human reasoning oh it's all filthy rats this morning oh but let God be glorified let God be praised and let your fate rise this morning to believe that God is able to deliver God is able to restore God is able to seal God is able to heal he breaketh the teeth of the ungodly he breaketh the pans of wickedness his voice breaking those Cheetos of Lebanon Oh hallelujah Oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah now faith is the substance of things hoped for fate for now fate for right now we need faith today not tomorrow not next week we need fate right now the power of God is laying there but not enough fate to move it but this morning if you could just get started if you could just get the praising if you could just get any atmosphere create a circle around you what an environment of worship create a place for him from loose create a place for him to come down inside although he inhabits the praises of his people when you praise when you shout when you lift your hands angels on this patch to fight for you to give you the victory hallelujah praise God the devil love to fight worship you'll have to fight the atmosphere because any time you in the atmosphere you reconnect with who you really are oh you taught who you are now is who you really are no no no no not the struggling you not this tell us you thanks you praise God up one day down the next variable States that's not how God saw you in the beginning come on now come on now prayer was power and I laid a foundation I'm here listen listen the theophany we are going back to it's not victorious theophany the theophany party that you are going back to the glorified party the spiritual party that you are going back to it's not the defeated party that party doesn't know depression that party doesn't know frustration that party doesn't know praise of devil and whatever that party knows about kicking the devil out of heaven praise and if you're gonna go back to that party then we're gonna kick our depression kick our frustration while we have a being man Oh cast off the works of darkness this morning let us put on the armor of lights please call her and fight the good fight of faith hallelujah amen amen stop over here for a many bless a lot of people and know the joyful sound the toys the Lord is our strength this morning holily I am happy today I am happy today hallelujah hallelujah jesus said don't praise God because the demons are subject to you but give God praise and glory why because your name it's written in heaven hallelujah praise God that's why we praise God that's why we come this morning that's why we give the devil a run for his money pray cause we know who we are all the people I know that God shall be strong and to create exploits Oh hallelujah hallelujah Oh glory be to God a man Oh hallelujah hallelujah a many man whoa Wow many men simply feel the Spirit of God this morning amen sound like in a groove okay I think we can strike the Jordan now amen glory hallelujah okay so my title demand dynamics of this church isn't all right a man of my subject God reproduces himself now I was reading this quote here and I was saying that he said the big machine you've got all the mechanics see all the world system government system right it's mechanic just leaning me he said any only thing they have to do is to have Satan get in here in there with his dynamics to force the marking of the beast so it's like the wires already plugged in everything is hooked up and all they waiting on is this Luciferian satanic spirit to come into it and to empower it and enforce this system but the devil has had a long time to set up his Eden and he has done it marvelously there's technology there's convenience there's buildings his architecture is government system structures to second coffee why would you want to leave this earth there has to be a vision greater than this that your heart is longing for but your soul is crying out for all these pills and all this mortgage and all this mess there's got to be something more than this that we are looking at for city this morning whose builder and maker is caught I'm not satisfied we just come in a church no but have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed Oh have you received the spirit it's a pill of fire burning in your heart if not then come to the altar and see the baptism of the holy coat hallelujah hallelujah glory to God amen amen glory glory hallelujah so we see the endgame we see what God is pointing us to back to the spirit before there was were there was spirit and that Great Spirit anointing spoke and out of it came lobos word which had to go forth first before anything materialized so he said let there be and then like materialize but before like a come a word had to be spoken holily and that comes from the awesome praise God original Spirit of God now that spirit hallelujah it's trying to call you back to himself but the only way he could do it was to the word so you have to speak let let a lot here you come in 2019 ojala little pick up your word to pick up your spirit to pick up your anointing for your tale to run the Devils out of your life to let the devil know whose side we are to finish a battle that was started in heaven hallelujah praise calling man hallelujah hallelujah Jesus came it's not he said Spirit of God is upon me because he has anointed me to preach the gospel isn't that right but he stopped in the middle part to the day of vengeance have all gone that was not his part to bring yet he was gonna bring a bride one day to do that part please Bob I hear you coming his first coming isn't that right and he was anointed isn't that all right he healed the sick he raised the dead he cast out devils but look what happened when he died on Calvary you know what happened an instant transaction took place instant transaction all of the sin that the prophets could not undo that the Kings could not - but the sages of their time could not - Moses went underground Joshua went in the ground Solomon went underground Oh hallelujah it was God's people but there was pound Oh holiday because there was no perfect sacrifice for sin but here came the sinless one he gave me all-powerful one he gave me omnipotent one and when he lay on the cross he said it is finished and the Bible said he gave up the ghost and when that happened when that happen the devil was finished right oh when that happened every sin he was about to commit in 2019 was remitted hallelujah hallelujah not guilty praise God Oh hallelujah hallelujah instant transaction Bible said a son hid his face the winds began to blow the mountains began to dance because they saw the great Shepherd was smitten to redeem nature back again on all creation Oh begin to shout for joy the veil was rent from the top to the bottom the crane to open and the sleeping Saints a pair o in some transaction ha ha ha now I tell you this you think that's something you wait till the power of God strikes this church the Prophet said when the power of God fully connect when the head unite with the body in some transaction it's gonna take place brother Branham overcome Wesley come all the Prophet glory of God hallelujah hallelujah you think the backsliders could stay where there when that church rises in the power of God come on come on I tell you Church Oh hallelujah come on What's in what power is greater than all car the devil has finished this morning he is a liar he is defeated Oh God is able to steal you this morning into the kingdom of God by the Holy Spirit [Applause] crazy [Applause] or mine or mine dynamic Co mechanics dynamic Co mechanics hallelujah oh my oh my oh we feel the spirits we know he is here right is anointing this morning don't look around you just lift up your hands and close the eyes the angel of God is here this morning to go before us and cut the enemy away he's here to steal your children he's gonna steal your wife your husband he's here to seal you into the kingdom hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh oh you just ride a spirit now just in worship keep the anointing once you pull in that pillar of fire look at the profit people come up looking for healing but people as in the audience pulling the pillar of fire pulling for their healing you could do the same thing this morning you just keep worshiping yes Lord Jesus oh I need the Holy Ghost I need the Holy Ghost I need it I need it I want it I want it that's what I come to church for Oh have to be filled I don't want to be the same I'm fed up with myself praise God I need a change I need a transformation Oh hallelujah but it in my soul yes yes yes yes oh nothing wrong with that [Applause] we need a Holy Ghost punch who's not afraid of the devil oh it's so wonderful to think that even in this modern age with all of this technology we have creature comforts that Moses didn't have and Abraham didn't have look at the day that we're living in cell phones internet freezes narrator online transactions I pull up pick up my phone and I'm at the bank sending money to somebody else what are you living in and yet in all of this technology God is still the same it's principles are still the same Oh hallelujah holidays - the same today the same rules still apply you still have to have the token and it's gonna be another people in the land who in the midst of all of this modernist that has failed mankind still believed God in the core of the prophets in the core imposes in the core of Abraham and hello we still believe that God don't care what the devil throw in our face don't care much how much internet how much TV praise court it cannot distract us from what chord is got to unveil in our hearts and our souls Oh hallelujah cannot help but speak of the things that we have seen and heard and if the line had roared who can but care and if the Lord God has spoken [Applause] [Music] line is getting ready to roar brother [Applause] angel town he brought it was a row of authority I went to open his mouth seven thunders uttered their voices a message to the prime the taker out from here and into glory it be so simple it be so sweet so humble she'd be living a life but you have to virtue - strength from fate the fate growing in God right under the devils nose oh and he won't be able to do a thing about it because he's 6,000 years too late he took the book he took the keys right now this morning Jesus holds the keys of death and hell he's got the key to your purpose he has the key to your destiny he has the key this morning he has the key this morning all you've got to have a speech what sense the promises of God the access the keymaster and he could turn that key this morning Mary had a key one time she said I know hallelujah that Lazarus is dead four days old but even now you can still do something even now something could still happen for our brother and jesus said hallelujah hallelujah he that believeth on me though he were dead yet shall he live resurrection power lay in him hallelujah she turned the key and you could turn the key this morning to your baptism to your Holy Ghost to your anointing to your promise you guys have to have take this morning reach up with spiritual face grab ahold of God's promise if you see the word go forth and you know it's for you say that is mine pandava hallelujah i'm-a it's mine speak it believe it Oh glory hey man my lorry man oh it's a glorious church without spot wrinkle washed in the blood that's what he died for oh my hey I'm still trying to read this quote here I'm taking my time this morning is that okay all right he said no when she's forced down then the dynamics is working so the dynamics is a working pump that comes upon the mechanics that comes upon the material parts it's nice to make the gears turn to make the pulse move to make the thing push up and down it's a dynamic that is working that's a dynamic power that is turning isn't all right the Prophet said the mechanics is there he said they've already got them will system and he said now let me say something too he said this u19 time to see churches uniting nations uniting he said it's a uniting time of God and his bride - and he said that I say this with reverence and respect here's a prophet hear this he said I believe that the pride of Christ is called oh right he spoke it yeah you're coming for it he's speaking you out he said I believe the pride of God is poor I believe holily he is he's standing in 1963 he's speaking because he know there's a bride in 2019 who's gonna hear this very same message this morning he said I believe the Pradas call I believe she sealed into the kingdom of God I believe the mechanics is there and they are waiting for the dynamics that will take her off the earth and into glory and in the rapture [Applause] I have caught the prophets pocket I believe it and that settles it [Applause] praise God a man a man he said we don't know he said I believe it with all my heart he's a man is not right he said we do not dynamics I'll take off the words in the glory an interruption he said I believe it with all my heart do you believe it this morning it's the only hope the church has today so I believe it with all my heart because there's nothing to go back to we've already burned the boats so there's no going back we gotta go for whatever back what never I'll take your sword and run into the battle hallelujah praise calling man they've caught be with me then I shall be able I believe it all my heart yes sir we don't know how he's gonna do it but he shall do it he is the dynamics or enemy say that again he is the dynamics so after he set up his own system court set up his own system in you putting all the lust and lies burns out the filth and trash burns all the worldliness all the desires for the things of this world then he comes and sets up his system his button of light is inside of you expanding expanding he's getting more greater holiday is consuming you then he himself Christ Himself comes down [Music] and to what he has created and he works the thing and if he wants to do a certain thing all you have to do is tap his mechanics on the shoulder come this way come this way unless there's something I want you to do I love her God move her up his own thing going on revival going on sweets Peter and James and John and all of them all of a sudden God whispered and Philippi and pull him aside and say there's somebody that is on his way to eat you up here I have to go talk to him I know you're having fun in the church and are enjoying the blessings but then somebody you need to minister to and Philip was translated over to the Ethiopian eunuch travel like a thought broke through dimension to meet chords predestinated and this man was sitting in a horse carriage in a chariot and he was reading but he didn't understand I come Philip Philip was anointed he come and he asked him a question he said understand this what though readers and he didn't know and philip pull him aside the Bible's he came up into the chariot brought to me how that happened because the chariot was going a mile a minute but this was Philip being translated hallelujah hallelujah oh quarters move up Rick next feet when he ready to deliver when he ready to anoint when he ready to restore hallelujah I'm Philip Minister Tim there and they found a pool and Philip baptized a man and you receive the Holy Ghost is not God use Philip no you might say Peter is anointed man why God ain't called Peter or I gonna call Andrew you will tell god what to do if God find Philip is the man for the job God called Philip what you have to do attach forget about it praise hallelujah what is that to thee follow thou me God is in charge take care of his own wonderful is all gone Amen praise gone she says yes sir I believe it he said we don't know how he's gonna do it but he shall do it he is a dynamics he said we just become members of the Machine of his body forming ourselves into his image and see him uniting himself with us in his works with his love gifts that he hands them to us as he hands them to us just before the wedding supper and we're waiting we're watching for that there big church is to be united and here's where I got it from he said the dynamics of this church what will it be he said it would be a refilling of the Holy Spirit that we have worked in a small measure while the head spoon is coming down to unite with the body so while the headstone is coming down God in secret in mystery it's getting up right already how by a refilling of the Holy Ghost oh you're gonna see your receive you're feeling [Music] [Applause] what does it mean it means that Joshua the Holy Spirit is gonna go through the camp with a knife and begin to circumcise all of the ones that came out of Egypt and will borne along the journey God's gonna get a people ready to possess their Mountain the spray Allah yeah Josh what a Holy Ghost shots for the Holy Spirit's gonna cover that knife knife of circumcision what's he coming for the cut off the excess flesh of the loose things cut off the world from you hallelujah Oh Lord that you could be crowned with the glory of Jesus Christ of everything not so easily beset you give you the power to run this race with patience the Holy Ghost Joshua with a mocking knife angel those that cry all those that want their portion on those that want their inheritance on those that are not satisfied this morning just to come to church just to be nice people no no no no no you want the Holy Ghost on fire you want a bird from above you need that pill of fire the common side your soul and burn the demons out burn lose the fault of your hearts alleluia alleluia and make you a real Christian or no Christian at all we want to clean church or no church at all we want all God or non God willing to go all the way hallelujah the devil will use the ninety nine and nine-tenths but those who's got a hundred percent on for God isn't that yeah they're the ones that God will use because God can't did never can't find an inch of space to work in you see you got yourself a 1% leave room for the devil the Bible said make no provision for the flesh to fulfill the lust thereof and it makes me think about that rich young ruler when he come to Jesus he was a good man the Bible said she just loved him he come and he asked good master what should I do to inherit eternal life and so on are you gonna tell him well in obey the commandments and do what's right and it'll come to church be a nice Christian so he say well this I do from my youth I'm doing this since I'm a small man no I'm a big man and I still feel the same I come to church for a long time but I still feel the same I don't feel no change it's become a routine for me it's become an order for me it's become a schedule to wake up in the morning and to go to church I don't feel the spirit I don't feel the anointing there's something wrong and I just can't put my finger on it oh I need a change but must I need something good master I need something to make me whole I'm only patch hallelujah hallelujah but I need a full thing and at that point the Bible said Jesus loved him love projected itself and then in an atmosphere and not a holy holy spirit now was examining his soul almost like a x-ray on the outside people look normal but when you take x-rays it does expose some stuff we take an ultrasound it does expose some stuff that you didn't even know what's wrong with you I thought she was okay you know you feel a little funny you come to the doctor for a checkup and here was this man come to the good master because I'm sure he went to other rabbis and priests of that time maybe he didn't get the answer he wanted but he ain't come to the right place here you come at the right time and maybe this morning you come to the right place just at the right time to hear the right message hallelujah hallelujah yet jesus said you've got a money demon it's like a soul you better sell all that you have [Music] sell all that you possess even not nice thing you put up on that pedestal that you have dong like those own now just turn on any morning and take off any night that thing sell it that thing that you idolize God said I will have no idols before me walk before me and be there for perfect that is the Commission that God is calling us to is now but some of us we keep idols keep things locked away and no one knows we're shaking hands and we're trying to be the best we can and that's alright what q yet Jesus n he that loveth his life in this world shall lose it but he that hated his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal because he's gonna give you a new life a new walk a new talk to set your affection on things above halleluyah halleluyah if you're willing to give up or then God could fully occupy the space and he has in there and he put in man for the holy ghost prophets it is a small compartment in the heart scientists don't know what it's for profits that I believe we've caught put a space there got to be a purpose for it I believe that's where that spirit wants to dwell in your heart you got to be able to take him to school with you to take him on the job with you when he stand in front of the bank teller he must be able to see Jesus looking back at him praise God have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe Oh glory to God a man hallelujah the dynamics to this church the dynamics to you dynamics to your mechanics what's mechanics wood wood a line upon line here a little there a little precept upon precept oh honey teaching is not right positionally placing you but not what you need is that Spirit of God to come and confirm his word what he spoke all those years what he was always saying to you oh my we'll get it free Scotty man I've got some things here praise God we're gonna strike it you love him today amen amen oh I'm so happy a man I said you wouldn't take too much time so let's go that he's a big dynamics we just become members of the Machine of his body that's a beautiful line amen forming ourselves into his image and then seeing him uniting himself with us in his works with his love gifts as he hands them to us before the wedding supper and we're waiting we're watching for that are you watching for that today Amen they're big churches to be United it's not right okay said no dammit dynamics of this year to be refilling the holy spirit that we work in a small measure while a headstone is coming down to unite with the body but when the head on the body unites together the full power of the Holy Ghost would raise her up just exactly like that my my my my my you know what that's like that's like you have a car all tuned up or a piece of machinery or something that's just maybe it's just missing a little part maybe just need one part to work and you're hunting all over looking for that part hey man that's how God is looking for you this morning he needed that pathway to work I know if it was a screw when it was a plug maybe it was the smallest thing but he just needed that one thing maybe it's a fan belt I don't know just needed something to get this thing moving they kept this thing into March and once it was in position he could turn the key and the thing would ignite [Applause] so this part is getting ready because she has to catch the headstone there's a void or cap up there that you will call out of this laude CH I don't have a permit here but he'll call out of that laude CH to fit into that void or gap chords Donahue stones stones out of different corners of the earth all over the place God is gonna call different ones that's why you come from different places and different backgrounds different society holla no but that doesn t tell me who you are but because God predestinated a bright God put a seed of predestination in your soul I see the perfection that you will not satisfy with who you are that you were called to so much more than this and you believe that with all your heart and God led you this way he let you that way he brought you this way you fell this way you have this trial you this chest you beat yourself up about it you felt all torn up but you are still coming on poor Ottawa still working his way out Paul was still working on you heart is still bringing you out he's not finished with you yet the work that he has started in you he is able to complete it this morning so that you could fit in to that point or cap in the pyramid to catch that headstone to complete the body work a man a man he could come down into it oh please you know take a little breather a man you love him Rory hallelujah so that's who we are call out as lively stones a man fitly joined together into this body mystical body of Christ for this last day to do the great work to finish the work a - alright praise God a Christ left off for us to do here now watch he said now for myself with this image okay alright a man the full power of the Holy Spirit so we need a full power to take us up however you need to connect hallelujah to bring out the dead in Christ we need a full power Hollan is now in order to have the full power God her to restore the full word back in this last day all our scattered throughout the ages right that's why God call a prophet in this last thing to tie up all the loose ends to finish all these hidden mysteries things that the people didn't know to reveal what Luther was doing the part that Wesley had to play the part of the Pentecostals had to play to reveal the open door age and to show her that whole thing come down right down into this last day the show that this last day prior she would have the dynamics of her mechanics holiday to go up into glory to connect with what back there hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah all right that's why if we feel a prophet to reveal the full word so with the full word restored every single part now the fullness of the Holy Spirit could come down into the bodywork and seal the whole thing and make it live and it'll speak and it'll create itself hallelujah all these things that we're looking for Amen all right we will be fulfilled at that time when it connects isn't that right priests gone so I wanted to strike my subject here and I know that now God wants to reproduce himself I just want to stress on this for this a few moments and I think about sometimes our mother may be you know any mother would love to have children and soon and it's a desire of any mother any woman to come at a point where she where she wants to have children or to have a family of Hollens narrowing and how she wants to you know bring four children and to experience that and I feel how God maybe felt that way too at one time that he wants to reproduce himself he wanted to tirta to bring forth something like himself he had a desire to do it yes I don't know how long time wasn't measured then but he stayed alone with his thoughts and he had these wonderful thoughts about being a father Savior healer and I know we talk about it a lot but I want us to focus on the part where God's building and his idea is because he wanted to have sons he wanted to have somebody to talk to he wanted to have somebody to fellowship with Oh hallelujah no wonder he told Adam it's not good for man to be alone because he knew how that felt and that's why he laid Adam down on the ground in that deep sleep and out of his rib he brought for Eve and now the man who stole our Lord was happy but us please isn't that right that man was no longer alone it pleased God to see his creation come forth to see Adam comfort any time God look at Adam he would smile he would rejoice because finally after all of this time there was somebody on the earth that looked like him walk like him talk like him I could be like him he could talk to Oh God want somebody to talk to this noise and when we pray when we go into a closet what are we doing we are reconnecting with our Father we are reconnecting with our Heavenly Father who has a desire to talk to his children to talk to his loved ones to talk to his sons to talk to his daughters God wants to have a relationship with his hallelujah with his thoughts so there were no more thoughts God spoke it's not right we know all the logos comfort creation and man and everything else finally he was so pleased tele to caress because a man on the earth had the authority to sign a check he looked like him walk like him talk like him animals to what you want to do God come to such a point of rest that all he had to do any evening was calm down and asked out of our report how was the day well I changed this tree I didn't like this color so I found it look nice what do you think about it wow that looks good couldn't have done it better myself my Halloween nation ship they were having conversations Adam was given a report every evening hallelujah about how well he was doing and the father was happy hallelujah and corn was desire for a son was met through Adam true even so on what desires I have children then it became to hoever gaan quoted his family it's not right but now the devil stepped into the picture and now caught all Adam you gave him a commission what did he tell him he told to multiply and to replenish and subdue the elephant do have dominion over it it's not right you take control you take charge and the devil saw an opportunity to slip into God's program and to break is now right what God was coming on to so before God he could come into that multiplying time that season that was supposed to come around where God would reveal how that would take place whatever comments to put a stop to it isn't that right and that's how sin came into the picture and that's how the devil the serpent was able to corrupt this this being this man that God created and slipped us leader discrepancy in there isn't that right and all creation fell hallelujah so the devil was successful you could see temporarily in hindering God's work but that's okay because it's in the weakness it's in the fallenness it's where he shows himself to be strong sometimes we make a mistake and we feel like we can't come back or we feel like it's too far for us but right there is where God shows himself to be God Oh hallelujah how could he be the god of forgiveness if there's nothing to forgive but we were lost in sin we were stooped Alleluia we were town in the dumps we didn't know who we were real almost cut off his night but for the blood of Jesus that reached out his hand and pulled you up out of the darkest deepest depths that's the God we serve this morning that is Jesus that is what he can do oh but he couldn't do it Oh hallelujah hallelu if he didn't know guilt you wouldn't know that the liberty of the freedom of the sons of God when he reveals himself to you when he unlocks and opens the prison doors when he sets you free when his Spirit comes upon you when you feel the anointing of God because you know it's not like the world it's not like anything the worker gives you know the world you've tasted a world but this is the French this is unique this is quad coming down upon your soul Oh hallelujah how can you be satisfied with anything less than the spirit of party in your life Oh hallelujah hallelujah once you taste it you want more of it hallelujah Amen young people all you have to do is taste God once and you'll want more of it I know it for myself that's why I could speak it I don't serve God just because to be a church boy or church girl or something no no no but because we had an experience because we felt God we felt the warm rays of His Holy Ghost we know he's real we know he's alive we know he is powerful we know he is glorious [Music] he cannot fail us praise God all you have to do touch God one time I see if God don't do something for you it'll give you the boldness to go into the school to go into the job or wherever you are I let them know you're a Christian how are you a Christian because their Bible your Bible person you like to be nice no no no no it's not about being a goody two-shoes it's about meeting getting into contact with the pillar of fire getting into contact with the core of the Bible you heard about him you read about him but now you need to meet that call yourself by a glorious wonderful baptism of the Holy Ghost and fire it'll come into your soul it'll change you it'll rearrange you what this is do it today right here 2019 I believe protocol of people out how will he call them not by works but by fire by fire not by man not by intellect but by the fire the Living God O God to his holy spirits will rebuild the church again hallelujah Oh hallelujah Oh fire God coming to your soul PI of God coming to your heart we need the fire we want the fire the same fire that they had on Pentecost that's what we pray in for that's what are you crying for that's what we burden for that's what we long for we want to see Jesus in this message in this church in this people once more they hit direct from God fill me Lord Jesus I wanna be filled with the Holy Ghost I wanna be sealed with the Holy Ghost that angel is on yet now he's sealing souls into the kingdom oh he could do it this morning don't you be afraid don't you be dismayed Oh hallelujah the dynamics the dynamics the discharge is a refilling of the Holy Spirit a filling of the Holy Ghost Oh God wants to reproduce himself in your flesh in your heart in your party he wants to walk with you he wants to talk with you he wants to come inside more than you want to receive him he has a desire to reproduce himself in your heart a burning desire to reproduce himself in your soul in your heart in your hallelujah [Applause] Oh God Oh pour out the dynamic slow oh we need it we want Oh glory we see the world coming into such a condition oh it ought to make us desperate the world has gone insane they've gone crazy they're trying to they're trying to change your laws to accommodate homosexuality and God is still the same gotta still judge that thing hallelujah but God has a bride on it who in the midst of all of this field she hallelujah is gonna live Jesus Christ what a paradox how are you gonna do it it won't be by your human spirit no no no no no it'll take a power that we've never known before greater than what you've ever felt to come into your soul eternity has gotta blast into you the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost Oh hallelujah God wants to take possession of your heart and soul and make you a partaker of his divine nature it takes a fire to do that it takes fire to make you a real Christian it takes fire wanna make you live to make you love the unlovable if you want to real love it starts with the fire the living in your soul he puts his love in you [Applause] dynamics to all mechanics we need the palm we need a power yes we've had the word in this message and it's produced very little it's not right but if you ever could put the word together with the spirit if the word of God you mix it with hate that creates expectation and then watch expectation for what for the Holy Ghost for the dynamics of God what happened you see you can't get warm by a painted fire you need a real fire in order to get warm and you don't need a fire tomorrow we don't need a fire yesterday we want a fire right now the young people need a fire right now the killings need a fire right now right now in the service the backslidden ones needs fire hallelujah Oh Honolulu I need a fire you need a fire Lord's and the poetess now and baptize everyone hallelujah we need we need it Lord we needed Lord Jesus

when the Holy Ghost come into Peters heart brother you know sometimes they go to our restaurant and you see somebody get a steaming hot pilot plate of food and they say whoa and he tell the waiter

happy to be a Christian I'm so happy to be called out I believe in something I'm making away from my family right now I'm making away from my loved ones right now my burden my sacrifice you stand in a cap this morning standing a cap for your loved ones how did I get for your son's hand in a gap for your tortoise Oh God is able God is able he promised [Applause] [Music] [Music] I don't even know my god oh man this is wonderful stay right with it he's coming he's coming he's coming pillar fires coming Holy Ghost is coming oh ha ha John stood up on that day said I was not like light but I bear witness of that light actually baptized with water but there's one standing among you whose shoes I am unworthy to unstrap I am not even worthy to look upon him but he shall surely papped eyes you with the Holy Ghost to give you a real experience hallelujah on that day many will come to him saying lord I did not cast out Devils in your name didn't I do this didn't I do that Jesus said depart from me you workers of iniquity I didn't even know you so it got to come down to unknowing you've got to know God for yourself and the only way to know God it's just not by revelation only but by an experience of the Holy Spirit where he could make himself known to you where you know that he's alive because he's inside your heart how can I deny what I feel in my soul I know he is real oh oh praise God oh and when you walk through the gates of glory those kids will open for you why because there's something in your soul connect with them gates open up the gates Oh hallelujah oh you come from God go back to God oh born of his spirit washed in his blood oh oh oh my wonderful I think I could skip some of this here oh oh how do you love him today oh what a presence we won't be long again that's for sure we feel the presence I've gone here now Oh hallelujah we turn over to the spirit real soon you just ride the anointing he said now of course we know that God couldn't fulfill the promise to Adam to multiply the devil stepped in all right so God's plan was to always reproduce himself so when the prophets come Joseph and and all the stages of all isn't all right Abraham Isaac isn't all right they were only showing likenesses of Christ that was to come but when Christ come on the scene he was a magnificent one he was another Adam that God could look down upon finally got to continue his work that he had started on it's no wonder jesus told his disciples he called Philippi : drew they didn't know where they were being called but they felt something on their souls they felt something in their hearts they knew that this was a messiah they couldn't quite explain it it's not much but he was calling them why because he was getting ready to multiply a new plan Shh he was getting ready to reproduce himself he said a little while long my the world will see me no more but you are gonna see me and because I live you shall live also and as he got caught had sent me even so send I you no wonder he said on that day you shall know I am in my father here in me and I knew no one hallelujah well before God could pour out his Spirit upon them he had to speak at first he had to put the word out there first so he told them certain things and the treaty is the son of man will be lifted up and they into the hands of sinful man it's not riding a tree Daisy be raised up again isn't that right how he told them what what happened he told them what would take place a man is now right hallelujah he came unto his own the Bible said and it's all receive him not but as many as received him to them gave he power God knows who would receive him oh my do you know who you are this morning you are not just anybody but you are them who would receive him you are his hands you are the Sheep of his pasture or how can the devil block you from his hands we know the truth hallelujah and the truth is what sets us free Oh hallelujah hallelujah no wonder he told them unless a corner wheat fall into the ground and die it abideth alone but when it die it bringeth forth much fruit you keep dropping off the word speaking unto them all it might seem like they couldn't handle it because it couldn't understand it but he still had to speak it because he knew he was gonna come around in that resurrection ministry and begin to open their understanding to the scripture hallelujah hallelujah what he was telling them hallelujah that's why I told ya and when Christ died in some transaction took place so for three days he lay in the ground but on the third day by the word just as he spoke it he rose up holidays night the mighty Conqueror and in the evening service when they were shot in afraid of the Romans do with him Wheaton it was a appearance he didn't want to go sign it was a too afraid to pray it was a solemn assembly but all of a sudden here comes Jesus the Bible said he came in to them while the doors were shut let me tell you something there's no tour this morning that construct brought out if God wants to come inside he's gonna find a way to get in there Oh hallelujah because he wants to bless you Oh glory be to God [Music] hallelujah people try to shut got out and they get despondent and they get you know its content three maybe or maybe get discouraged sometimes and it happens in the Christian journey and somehow you feel like we just shut everything out and we don't hear from nobody but there's no door this morning that you could close hard enough if you are predestinated God's gonna find you brother what's gonna find you sister God will make himself known to you oh you shut he'll find a way he came in and he spoke to his disciples and we can't encourage them and he breathed upon receiving a Holy Ghost hallelujah because the transaction already took place now he could put in hallelujah he could issue out the warrants but it devil's arrest now because he's holding the keys he's got the authority over everything in heaven and energy and he kept them the Holy Ghost he said Terry in Jerusalem and wait for the power I'm gonna give it to you I'm going up so that he could come top hallelujah praise call him a man oh and they waited and they tarried and they prayed and they praise God continually oh it didn't happen on the first day right man but Isaac said I did not put on a second leading up on the third day but it didn't discourage them they knew they'd heard from God they knew they heard from Jesus they finally knew who this man was hallelujah hallelujah oh my imagine these brothers come at the church for three and a half years and didn't know who he was imagine you going to a church and you don't know who that man is but you just know this is real you just know this alive you know you never felt anything like this ever before Oh hallelujah Oh hallelujah for some strange reason Sonny keeps holding you something keeps holding arranged you don't understand all of it but you know God spoke to you you know God's doing something in your life you're not put y'all to be but you're not what you used to be you're coming over something and for all of a sudden after all those years that mine was unlocked I saw who they were and to what they had to receive brother you can imagine what kind of service they have that's the kind of service we have in right now we understand by revelation who we are and what we have to receive hallelujah that you have to receive the same penny the same Holy Ghost that Peter receive not Mary receives not John right Phillip all of them you know that that prophet came to turn us back to the feet of the fathers telling us back to the feet of a solid fathers that once more this bully had direct from God what we have to connect back to what they had hallelujah we have to connect back hallelujah hallelujah is now right to the Spirit of God the word stay on books and tapes for a long time Halloween is night but he our common now is when the true worshipers are gonna worship the father in spirit and in truth how because they will have dynamics and mechanics working together spirit and truth in the church or power of God working in the church dynamics upon the mechanics in the church callings sin out Oh hallelujah calling out the unbelief calling out the uncircumcised healing the sick raising the dead casting out Devils halleluyah halleluyah so he's spoken to them why he wanted to reproduce himself and in order to do that he had to give them the word the word has prophecy as to what he was about to do among them and in them and all it didn't quite understand it he had to say it he had to speak it before his resurrection ministry so here was another atom that please got in so much that the Spirit of God drop down and say here is my here is my son my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased to dwell he a him Christ isn't that right hallelujah was all at portland's God poured himself into this man God had another one like him on the earth and this man had a mission he couldn't stay like that because he said unless the corner wheat fall into the ground and die it's a vital own so God had to find a way to reproduce that same Jesus he had a dirt and the only way he could do it is to release the spirit that was upon that man because that's the only spirit that could come back upon the worshiper is now right because the blood of bulls and goats was only a temporal pardon for sin but the spirit of that animal could not come back upon the worshiper isn't that right because it was just an animal it was just a type it was just a sacrifice God temporarily received for sin at that time but God was coming on to the fullness of his sacrifice isn't that right I pull this up his atonement for sin and the only way he could do it was true Christ so here come he spoke another one into existence and he come through Mary a sinless one and he lived and he acted and he did and he pleased quad and he learned obedience by the things that he suffered and he grown with a headache he was tired yet at the grave of Lazarus he said Lazarus comfort he was a man yet he was more than a man because what was failing him was the power to release you from your guilt to release you from your shame hallelujah praise God praise God that's why he told them that the Son of man had to be offered up holidays now right at the hands of sinful men why his spirit had to be released because it was yet to go in the presence of God you remember with Iran the priests and everything they tied a rope around him and they let him go in blew it and sing it ringing holy holy unto the Lord Amen he couldn't go in themselves if anything happened to Iran in there they had to pull him out nobody could go in it's not right but now the veil was torn not that he had made a way this morning the same spirit I was in Christ because he came up the coast that holy Coast had not coming to you he released his spirit the same spirit that you could not catch that you could not access that made you strangers and foreigners but now through the blood of Jesus Christ we have been made kings and priests and fellow citizens of the Lord Jesus Christ [Music] which means this morning you have every right to clean the Holy Ghost you have every right to pray to cry out to ask God for the rain that is caught for your promise to clean every promise of God Oh hallelujah hallelujah the secret things belong unto the Lord God keeps it a secret the coming of the Lord a secret here he has that all to himself no man knows the day or the hour God has a man what he has a secret it's set aside no man could know it but the thing that he has revealed that belongs to you in other words if Cory village if God spoke it then that belongs to you this morning and it's brought to a profit reveal a message of the seven thunders Karen a bride together then that message is for you this morning that's your promise no devil could take that from you if poor reveal that you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit the gift of the Holy Ghost then that is your promise it could reveal after you then that belongs to you this morning oh you don't have it you don't

it's an attitude Lord I mean business with you Jacob had an attitude he ran for a long time he was running running from this one running from that one but it come a time when he had to stop running called forth the issue and God this morning it's gonna force the issue if love don't get you desperate conditions will God will force the issue in your house in your home in your life and drive you to your knees until you get to prayer until you get to crying out at the altar until you realize that there's no way around the Holy Ghost that there's no way up or down left right no no no no no you've got to come through that same baptism if Mary seen it you have to receive it this morning let Peter receive it you have to receive it this morning hallelujah you've got to receive it brother pan and

over I don't know what to read here he's gonna man mine halleluyah halleluyah let me read this here real quick he said well you got to see you say well the powers in the gasoline brother branham he said I don't care how much power is in that gasoline unless there's a spark there to manifest that power let there's a power there to confirm that that's gasoline it just might as well be water that don't matter how much T illusions clean how much people preach away how much how scientific they get isn't that right is that how well you're you got your church set up how much education you got how much like the Bible he said until that wave sheaf until the Holy Spirit comes upon that person to quicken that word he said that gasoline represents the word what is a gasoline it's the word he said it's the truth he said but without the spirit it won't move let it kill it but the spirit giveth life it is the life giver to the world the Prophet said I'm spoken for the original seed the watering spirit is what come upon the seed to make the seed live the Holy Spirit is the watering spirit that comes upon the seat in your soul and makes it live it's something else then when you praise God it's something else when you speak it's something else when you live it's something else it's something got a hold of you oh I went to a meeting one night and my heart was rich and my life was rich and I was praying and I was doing my 1/3 and all of a sudden something got ahold of me Oh [Applause] that's what I want today that's what I need today oh and we won't rest until we get it hallelujah do you feel that way many men oh my oh my he said we have put too much stress on the mechanics here at my but nothing on the dynamics he said it needs the dynamic power of God the resurrection power of Jesus Christ upon the church to manifest and to bring to pass that this is gasoline the word isn't there oh my he said it might be in a gasoline can it could still be water see it looks the same he said but the only way to prove it is to put this life on it it's not right and it'll prove whether it's gasoline or not amen he said I want you to try to put a holy spirit on a denomination he said you're as much your your you you can get a spotter he said but you'll ruin your engine by getting it full of carbon isn't all right he said but oh I'm so glad that there is a 10,000 team power the Word of God what is it a 10,000 opt-in power and a Holy Ghost to light it up that's what we need this morning if you get light up get me no more dead services but you on fire what did that policeman say the web's revived are you looking for it I've caught it inside of me he was whistling he was swinging his bat oh I've got the Holy Ghost oh Jesus on the mainland tell him what you want he was on the job but he had an anointing in his soul he's got something hallelujah looking for a world revival it's in me isn't it right oh my oh my to light it up and to the resurrection power of God into a man's life or woman's life or to into a church he said and that shoves the Cadillac down the road yonder under the dynamic power of the Holy Spirit which come back and was waved over the people at the day a penny car making him the same yesterday today and forever amen paragraph 1 we said there has been churches churches prides prides churches prides prides hallelujah coming down all Trudel ages he said but

father [Music] [Applause] hallelujah oh my my let me get ready to finish hallelujah isn't that right it's got to come one a real bride and it must come one that's not only got the mechanics but the dynamics of it makes that church live and move in the power of his resurrection until we come to that place he said until we find that place he said what good does it do to polish the humps you just marked in time it's not right but you're not going anywhere you're polish in the hub's doing the same thing over and over praise God know something different that's what they're here to do this

your portion to them that believe oh my what good does it do the Polish ahab's what good does it do to give our facelift for a simonize job or something see when there's no dynamics in it no matter

Jesus it's what he less man repent and be baptized in the name of the saint Jesus and you see the same spirit you'll have the same walk you'll have the same life you'll have the same dynamics

the first seal at the end of the Pentecostal age he said we re supposed to receive according to the word as God helped me tonight to show you here that we have to receive a messenger that will take those loose ends out there and reveal the whole secret of God for the rapturing of the church I love her but Isaac said last week he said the purpose of the anti message was to lose the Holy Spirit it was to lose the Holy Ghost listen yeah he said Ananias comment 47 mysterious thunders that's not even written at all he said that's right he said and I believe to these seven thunders Ribeira feel in

while the Lord willing we are gonna find where it is written and on birth pains he said I go God has set some in the church through the labor pains he said already got tremendous sometimes he said but when a church is growing on the persecution of the outside world believing on the Lord Jesus not the promise of the Holy Ghost is just as real as it was the Pentecost how they grown and how they cracked under labor pains but when they are born and positionally poured into the kingdom of God the Prophet said then the Holy Ghost has set in a church some apostles some prophets some teachers some pastors some evangelists then he given today speaking with tongues interpretation of tongues knowledge wisdom gives up healing all kinds of miracles when does that happen after the Holy Ghost come upon you you shall receive power the dynamics of this church is now right are filling up the Holy Spirit that's what we're saying today one more quote to be understand Jesus said say to this mountain you play some softly he said and you heard they what about it thing taking place that the ministry that were entering into now he said we're way up the road now he said soon the coming of the Lord Jesus we've got to have a rapture in fate in a church that can be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye to go out or will not go he said but don't worry it will be there it'll be there this
