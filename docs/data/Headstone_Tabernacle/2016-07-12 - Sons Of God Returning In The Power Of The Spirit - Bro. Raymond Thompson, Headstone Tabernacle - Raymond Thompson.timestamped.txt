[40:33] house of the Lord? I was glad when they
[40:36] said unto me, "Let us go into the house
[40:38] of the Lord." My, what an anointing.
[40:42] What an atmosphere. The atmosphere is
[40:45] right tonight for the miraculous to take
[40:48] place. The atmosphere is right tonight
[40:51] for the sick to be healed. The
[40:53] atmosphere is right tonight for
[40:55] backsliders to be restored. Uh the
[40:58] atmosphere is right tonight for sinners
[41:00] to meet the living Christ, the unfailing
[41:03] reality of the living
[41:05] God. Ah you believe that tonight? Are
[41:08] you happy to be here? Are you happy to
[41:11] be in another convention? Are you happy
[41:13] to be under the canopy of life? Oh may
[41:16] the Lord bless you.
[41:19] Oh my my my my my my.
[41:22] Before I go any further, we just want to
[41:24] bow our
[41:25] heads. We have two prayer requests
[41:28] tonight. Want to pray for Sister Gloria
[41:31] Timothy who was hospitalized for acid
[41:34] reflux. And we want to remember brother
[41:36] Ruskin Cummings in prayer as well for
[41:39] his stomach condition.
[41:41] [Music]
[41:43] Heavenly Father, we feel the anointing
[41:44] is already here
[41:47] and it's the anointing that makes the
[41:50] difference.
[41:52] Lord, we come to you tonight united in
[41:54] faith. Lord, the word has already gone
[41:57] forth and the devils are on the run. The
[42:00] devil knows he's finished and its time
[42:02] is up. And we know who we are tonight.
[42:05] We know who, Lord, you are. We know who
[42:07] the devil is. We know our position as
[42:09] sons tonight. And Lord, we Lord, we come
[42:12] Lord speaking boldly knowing that you
[42:15] are the God that answers prayer. You
[42:17] said healing is a children's bread and
[42:19] we bring our sister before you right now
[42:21] that even now you touch her from the
[42:23] crown of her head to the soles of her
[42:24] feet. Lord, may she be discharged, Lord.
[42:27] May she be completely healed. And for
[42:29] brother Ruskin tonight, may you touch
[42:30] him. He's here in the house of God,
[42:32] Lord. He's here with faith, Lord, coming
[42:34] under expectation. May you minister to
[42:37] him right now. And if there's anyone
[42:38] else tonight in the tabernacle on the
[42:41] hookup tonight, Lord, may you touch them
[42:43] in body. May you heal your people so we
[42:45] could enter into the word and to worship
[42:47] like we have never done before. We
[42:49] commit the service into your hands in
[42:50] the precious name of Jesus Christ. And
[42:52] the church says, and the church says,
[42:56] amen. Amen. You may be seated.
[43:01] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[43:04] So, I'd like to welcome everyone tonight
[43:07] in the precious name of the Lord Jesus
[43:09] Christ. Special welcome to all those who
[43:10] are connected on the internet tonight
[43:14] and uh it's such a great privilege.
[43:16] We're already getting testimonies from
[43:17] around the world with how the convention
[43:19] is being a blessing and we are so
[43:21] thankful for that. What can we say about
[43:22] the services thus far? Amen. And how

[46:12] Inugu, Nigeria. Brother Charles

[46:42] God bless
[46:44] you. We love
[46:48] you. My my
[46:51] my. And well, tonight we're going to
[46:54] hear from our precious brother Raymond
[46:56] Thomson. How many appreciate brother
[46:57] Raymond Thomson all the way from South
[47:02] Africa? Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. And his
[47:05] wife, Sister Gail. is special. God bless
[47:07] you. Thank you. We love
[47:12] you. Amen. So, there are a few other
[47:15] ministers that are on their way that
[47:16] came in. So, they'll join us during the
[47:18] service. We'll acknowledge them tomorrow
[47:20] morning, Lord willing. But just before
[47:22] brother Raymond comes, I just want to
[47:25] share this quick thought how the prophet
[47:28] or a prophet rather has the ability to
[47:31] break through barriers. A prophet could
[47:34] break through the barrier of time. And
[47:36] the inspiration for this meeting was
[47:38] beyond the barrier, beyond the sound
[47:41] barrier. And a prophet has the ability
[47:43] to break through the barrier of time.
[47:45] And he could see the future. And when
[47:48] brother Brandham broke through the
[47:49] barrier of time, he saw a people. He saw
[47:52] a people in action. He saw a people on
[47:55] fire. He saw a people in revival. He
[47:58] didn't see a dead bunch of people. He
[48:00] didn't see a cold bunch of people. He
[48:01] didn't see a lukewarm bunch of people.
[48:03] He didn't see people who were just
[48:05] following without revelation. But he
[48:08] broke through the barrier of time. And
[48:10] he saw a people that would catch a
[48:11] revelation. And nothing would stop them
[48:14] from coming into manifestation because
[48:17] every seed must bring forth after its
[48:21] kind. Can the church say amen? So,
[48:24] brother Brandham, he broke through the
[48:26] barrier of distance and he said before
[48:28] the doctor's hand touches my wife, he
[48:31] broke through the barrier of unbelief
[48:33] and he said, "Sister Hatty Wright, I
[48:35] don't know what your boys are doing, but
[48:37] I give you your two boys. Can I get a
[48:40] witness in the house tonight?" Brother
[48:42] Bham, as a prophet, he broke through the
[48:44] barrier of space and he said, "Son, come
[48:47] out and shine four days." And I believe
[48:50] right now there's a people in the land
[48:52] who are here to break past every
[48:54] barrier. The barrier of sin, the barrier
[48:57] of unbelief, the barrier of doubt, the
[49:00] barrier of formality, the barrier of
[49:03] just coming to church, the barrier of
[49:05] being in the message, the barrier of
[49:07] just
[49:10] come my my my my I'm not the preacher.
[49:14] I'm just here to introduce the preacher.
[49:16] But I heard but a Paul on a Jacob say
[49:18] something one time. He said you got to
[49:21] do something different.
[49:23] If you're used to putting up one hand,
[49:25] put up two hands. If you jump on one
[49:28] foot, jump on your both feet. But
[49:31] whatever you do tonight, do something
[49:33] different. If you've never shouted
[49:35] before, tonight is a night to shout. If
[49:38] you've never danced before, tonight is a
[49:41] night to dance. We are going to break
[49:43] down the barriers. We're going to cause
[49:45] something to happen. This is the prize
[49:48] revival. The seven thunders, the seven
[49:51] seals gathered you
[49:53] here. May the Lord bless you. We'll walk
[49:57] in the
[49:58] light as our brother Raymond Thompson
[50:00] comes to the platform tonight. You
[50:02] appreciate him. We'll walk more in the
[50:08] light. In the light. We'll
[50:11] walk in the light.
[50:15] Walking. Oh, we walk. Oh, in the light.
[50:21] We walk in the
[50:23] light. We walk in the light. Walking in
[50:28] the singing. Walk. Walk. Walking in the
[50:34] light.
[50:37] [Applause]
[50:38] Oh.
[50:42] Heat. Heat.
[50:48] [Music]
[50:50] [Applause]
[50:54] [Music]
[50:56] Oh, we
[51:02] [Applause]
[51:11] want fun.
[51:14] [Music]
[51:22] Walking in the light. One more time. We
[51:26] walk in the
[51:28] light. We walk in the
[51:32] light. We walk in the light. Walking in
[51:37] the light of
[51:39] God.
[51:40] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[51:44] While the world is walking in darkness,
[51:46] we have a wonderful light that we can
[51:49] walk in. Amen. God bless you. You may be
[51:52] seated.
[51:55] I'd like to greet you friends.
[51:58] And I'm saying friends like uh I read
[52:02] the quote last year. Brother Be says,
[52:03] "What's a prophet's reward?" Is to be a
[52:06] friend of a prophet.
[52:09] and he says
[52:11] uh and I he always came into the poop
[52:13] and said good evening friends. So I'm
[52:16] greeting all the friends of the prophet
[52:17] God bless you.
[52:20] [Applause]
[52:26] So uh behalf of my precious wife that's
[52:29] here family church back home
[52:32] uh we greet the convention in the
[52:35] precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[52:37] Amen. uh privilege to be back. Thank
[52:39] you, brother, your wife, the Headstone
[52:42] Tabernacle, all the helps and
[52:44] governments to have the faith again to
[52:47] put up these meetings. Now, there's no
[52:49] accidents with God or may
[52:52] God knew you will be here. He knew who
[52:55] will be here and he knew these meetings
[52:58] will take place. So then there is a
[53:00] specific purpose then why God called the
[53:03] bride together. Amen. And that's why
[53:06] it's so important that in the meetings
[53:08] we are in the spirit
[53:10] to catch what the spirit is trying to
[53:12] tell us. So thank you brother over. So
[53:16] uh it's amazing
[53:19] uh that we made it and this time my wife
[53:23] came with me and I'm so glad. It's a
[53:24] real miracle. She's not well. Just three
[53:27] weeks ago she was in hospital and the
[53:30] tickets was booked and visas was all
[53:32] through and yeah she ends up in hospital
[53:35] and found out she had a few strokes and
[53:37] things
[53:38] man-blowing. But here she sits sang
[53:40] tonight.
[53:51] uh brother Olu phone and to find out how
[53:54] she was and then I do I told him at that
[53:56] time. So the enemy tried to cut it off
[53:59] but God blessed her and here she is. Now
[54:02] it's amazing it it was sister Rebecca's
[54:05] birthday today and God bless you. Happy
[54:08] birthday Wednesday when we arrived it
[54:11] was our 42nd year wedding anniversary

[54:28] she sang and uh God bless you. So

[54:41] ministers that's here with their wives,
[54:43] some with their churches and uh God

[54:57] Australia. And that's Muro.
[55:01] Uh two
[55:04] uh she's originally from South Africa

[55:10] always send emails and I told her about
[55:13] the meetings and I said you can hook up

[56:32] Amen. And but the Bible says the one
[56:35] that brings forth fruit gets purged
[56:40] to bring forth more fruit. Amen.
[56:44] So as you go along and the trials get
[56:46] harder, it's because you are bringing
[56:47] forth fruit and God purges you to bring

[58:04] amen amen and amen Amen. Amen. If you
[58:07] have your Bibles,
[58:17] church, Luke chapter
[58:20] 4, Romans chapter 9, and Ephesians 1.
[58:37] Luke chapter 4 and we read
[58:40] uh verse
[58:48] 14. And Jesus returned in the power of
[58:51] the spirit into Galilee and they went
[58:53] out fame of him through all the region
[58:56] roundabout. And then we pick up uh 18
[59:03] And we know the story as he went into
[59:05] the temple, took the book, and then he
[59:08] begin to say, "The spirit of the Lord is
[59:09] upon me because he has anointed me to
[59:12] preach the gospel to the poor. He has
[59:14] sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to
[59:16] preach deliverance to the captives, and
[59:18] the recovering of the sight to the
[59:20] blind, to set at liberty them that are
[59:22] bruised, to preach the acceptable year
[59:25] of the Lord." And he closed the book and
[59:26] he gave it again to the minister and sat
[59:28] down and and all and the eyes of all of
[59:31] them were in the synagogue were fastened
[59:34] on him. And he began to say unto them,
[59:36] "This day is the scripture fulfilled in
[59:39] your ears." Amen. My
[59:42] Romans
[59:45] 9 Romans 8 from verse 19. For the
[59:48] earnest expectation of the creature
[59:50] waiteth for the manifestation of the
[59:52] sons of God. For the creature was made
[59:55] subject to vanity, not willingly, but by
[59:57] reason of him who subjected the same in
[1:00:01] hope. Because the creature itself also
[1:00:03] shall be delivered from the bondage of
[1:00:06] corruption into the glorious liberty of
[1:00:08] the children of God. For we know that
[1:00:11] the whole creation groanth and travaleth
[1:00:13] in pain together until now. And not only
[1:00:15] they but ourselves also which have the
[1:00:18] first fruits of the spirit. Even we
[1:00:20] ourselves grown within ourselves waiting
[1:00:23] for the adoption to what? The redemption
[1:00:25] of our
[1:00:27] bodies. Amen. Isn't that beautiful?
[1:00:29] Amen. Amen. Ephesians 1 verse4.
[1:00:33] According as he has chosen us in him
[1:00:35] before the foundation of the world that
[1:00:36] we should be holy and without blame
[1:00:38] before him in love, having predestinated
[1:00:41] us to the adoption of children by Jesus
[1:00:44] to himself according to the good
[1:00:46] pleasure of his will. May the Lord add a
[1:00:50] blessing to the reading of his word. You
[1:00:51] may be seated.
[1:01:01] So tonight I want to take a
[1:01:04] title, the sons of God returning in the
[1:01:07] power of the spirit. Hallelujah.
[1:01:12] My subject is sons recognizing their
[1:01:16] position.
[1:01:18] If you don't know where you stand, it
[1:01:21] makes it hard to be a son. Amen. And
[1:01:24] then my inspiration, we are
[1:01:27] predestinated unto adoption.
[1:01:31] So that's your destiny.
[1:01:34] Amen. And nothing can alter that. Amen.
[1:01:39] So just some warm-up quotes uh to sort
[1:01:45] of put my heart my heart and my shoulder
[1:01:48] to the wheel. Brother Theo, this is how
[1:01:50] I feel. earthly bride. He says here,
[1:01:53] "And when we are bold and gathered like
[1:01:55] this, I wouldn't have you come here by
[1:01:57] no means if I didn't if it was if I if
[1:02:00] it wasn't to help you. If it didn't, if
[1:02:03] I didn't think that this was doing you
[1:02:05] good." Amen. And that you would profit
[1:02:08] by it by coming and knowing too that we
[1:02:11] don't have too much longer to do this
[1:02:16] that we come into the very closing
[1:02:19] hours. And I want to make every moment
[1:02:22] count
[1:02:23] that I can for the kingdom of God and
[1:02:27] I'm trusting that the Lord will bless us
[1:02:29] as we assemble. So brother Brandham came
[1:02:33] this was 64 he realized time was coming
[1:02:36] to the end and he says I would not
[1:02:38] gather you here if I didn't think this
[1:02:41] will meeting will help you. Amen. Amen.
[1:02:43] And I don't believe that this meetings
[1:02:45] was called if God didn't mean that he's
[1:02:48] going to help you. Amen. And then he
[1:02:50] turns around and says, "And we are
[1:02:52] coming to the closing time." So there's
[1:02:54] not many many time left to make every
[1:02:58] moment count. So brother, I'm here in
[1:03:00] this meetings and I know the Holy Spirit
[1:03:02] is here and I believe he's going to meet
[1:03:04] with you and every moment that you have,
[1:03:08] make it count.
[1:03:10] Make it worth it. You didn't spend your
[1:03:13] money all this time to come here to
[1:03:15] occupy a seat. No, you want to make
[1:03:18] every moment count.
[1:03:22] Hallelujah.
[1:03:24] He says, "Yes, speak to the mountain." I
[1:03:26] believe that the church of the living
[1:03:28] God is
[1:03:29] moving into a sphere now that's going to
[1:03:31] shake the whole world.
[1:03:34] That's the first time it's been since
[1:03:36] the days of Jesus of Nazareth
[1:03:39] to a human being. Ask anything that you
[1:03:42] will and it shall be given unto you.
[1:03:44] Amen. anything you desire. Do you see
[1:03:47] the words of Jesus Christ being
[1:03:48] fulfilled? Oh, it's going to come to
[1:03:51] pass pretty soon. I'm looking for it to
[1:03:54] happen in this meeting.
[1:03:58] This is the prophet. And if you go
[1:04:00] further, this is just after sister
[1:04:03] right.
[1:04:05] He had just spoken the word and he says,
[1:04:07] "But I'm looking for something greater."
[1:04:10] And he says, "I'm looking for it to
[1:04:11] happen in this meeting tonight. Amen.
[1:04:14] And so I feel
[1:04:17] in the meetings I'm wanting to happen
[1:04:19] now. The anointing will strike the whole
[1:04:22] church of the living God and she'll rise
[1:04:24] to her feet like a mighty marching army.
[1:04:28] Oh come on brother. She'll rise to her
[1:04:31] feet like a mighty rushing army. What
[1:04:34] will do that? The anointing will do
[1:04:36] that. And the anointing breaks the yoke.
[1:04:39] It breaks the power of the enemy. It
[1:04:42] breaks sin shackles. The anointing will
[1:04:45] anoint the whole
[1:04:46] church. Not some of the church, the
[1:04:49] whole church. Our
[1:04:51] [Applause]
[1:05:00] children. Hallelujah. Glory. He says the
[1:05:03] whole church of the living God and
[1:05:05] she'll rise to her feet like a mighty
[1:05:08] marching army. The sick will be healed
[1:05:10] by a word. Hallelujah. The blind will
[1:05:12] and the deaf will see and the deaf will
[1:05:15] hear. The dead will be raised up. And
[1:05:18] the power of God will shake the world
[1:05:21] with the church.
[1:05:22] [Applause]
[1:05:24] With who?
[1:05:25] With the church. Who is the church? You
[1:05:28] are the church. How's God going to shake
[1:05:31] the world with you? So, you're not here
[1:05:34] by accident. You're not here just by the
[1:05:36] way. God called you for a purpose.
[1:05:39] Gather the people together. Let me speak
[1:05:41] to them. He's going to anoint you. He's
[1:05:44] going to raise you up like a mighty
[1:05:46] army,
[1:05:47] brother. Hallelujah.
[1:05:50] Praise God. He's going to anoint this
[1:05:53] church. The sick will be healed. The
[1:05:55] deaf will hear the blind. He says the
[1:05:57] dead will raise.
[1:05:59] Amen. Amen. Brother Paul, he's a man of
[1:06:03] faith, man. The dead will be raised.
[1:06:06] Something to happen in this meetings.
[1:06:09] Oh, hallelujah.
[1:06:12] Praise God.
[1:06:15] It says here will be raised up and the
[1:06:17] power of God will shake the world with
[1:06:19] the church of the living God. We're in
[1:06:22] the press process of it now.
[1:06:25] So, nobody can stop this, brother.
[1:06:28] Because God already started it. It's in
[1:06:31] the process. The coming of the Lord is
[1:06:34] in a three-fold manner. Already in
[1:06:37] process. The shout went forth, brother.
[1:06:39] It's already in process. Who's going to
[1:06:42] stop it, brother? What preacher,
[1:06:44] brother? What minister? What church?
[1:06:47] What demon?
[1:06:49] [Applause]
[1:06:51] Hallelujah. So, if you're in process,
[1:06:53] that mean you're already in action.
[1:06:56] Hallelujah. I'm not going to draw back,
[1:06:58] brother. I'm already in action. God
[1:07:01] called me. God,
[1:07:04] Glory be to God. I believe it soon come
[1:07:08] to pass. I believe it will just be
[1:07:10] exactly the way I believe it's going to
[1:07:12] strike the church of God's soul and it's
[1:07:15] going to start a revival.
[1:07:17] [Applause]
[1:07:18] Did you hear that? That anointing, that
[1:07:21] power, that that spirit that's going to
[1:07:23] come upon the bride, what's it going to
[1:07:25] do? It's going to start a revival. What
[1:07:28] gives you revival? The seven thunders
[1:07:31] gives you a revival. So you mean that
[1:07:34] anointing could be connected to the
[1:07:36] seven thunders? Yes, my brother. That
[1:07:39] brings
[1:07:40] revival.
[1:07:42] Hallelujah. Oh, glory be to God. That's
[1:07:45] why, brother, I don't care how I feel.
[1:07:47] It's not by how I feel because your
[1:07:50] feelings can throw you off. Your
[1:07:52] emotions can throw you off. Somebody
[1:07:54] didn't greet you. It throws you off.
[1:07:57] It's not about that. It's about the
[1:07:59] promise of almighty
[1:08:01] God. Hallelujah.
[1:08:03] Praise God. So, you got to get into
[1:08:07] action. God hates a dead church.
[1:08:11] God hates a dead church. He wants us as
[1:08:14] lively stones building up the house of
[1:08:18] God. Woo! Hallelujah.
[1:08:24] my it's going to strike the church of
[1:08:27] God soon and it's going to start a
[1:08:29] revival that will shake the world. I
[1:08:32] believe it and I believe this is part of
[1:08:34] that revival. That's why I'm here.
[1:08:37] That's why you here, brother. You are
[1:08:39] the revival.
[1:08:40] [Applause]
[1:08:46] You see, they always when they hear the
[1:08:48] word revival think it must be a massive
[1:08:50] thing. It must be thousand. No, God
[1:08:52] uses, you know, God, one man with God is
[1:08:55] a majority.
[1:08:57] Hallelujah. He shakes, you know, the
[1:08:59] devil counts.
[1:09:02] But God wins easy. He's looking for for
[1:09:05] quality,
[1:09:06] [Applause]
[1:09:07] not quantity, man. Hallelujah.
[1:09:11] Praise God.
[1:09:13] Hallelujah. So, I believe this bride is
[1:09:15] going to return in the power of the
[1:09:17] spirit. And Jesus went, we we read the
[1:09:20] scripture, he went into the wilderness
[1:09:22] and the Bible says he went there in the
[1:09:24] spirit. So when he came out, he came out
[1:09:26] in the spirit. And the process, I'm
[1:09:28] going to do a bit of quoting here. He
[1:09:30] says that Jesus knew his position in the
[1:09:33] word.
[1:09:35] And I that's that's my subject. The
[1:09:37] bride needs to know who she is.
[1:09:40] Because sometimes we walk around like we
[1:09:42] don't know who we are. But Jesus walked
[1:09:45] into the temple. They gave him the book
[1:09:48] and he found the place himself.
[1:09:51] He turned to Isaiah 61 in the scroll.
[1:09:55] Then he read the scripture.
[1:09:57] The spirit of God is upon me and has
[1:10:00] anointed me.
[1:10:02] Hallelujah. You see the difference? The
[1:10:05] spirit of God is upon me and has
[1:10:08] anointed me. That's what's going to
[1:10:10] happen. The spirit and the word is going
[1:10:12] to connect. And once the spirit gets
[1:10:14] there, brother, no one is going to stop
[1:10:17] this bride. She becomes an invincible
[1:10:20] army. Hallelujah. And when he said he
[1:10:23] picked up the book, he read the
[1:10:24] scripture. He closed the book. Brother
[1:10:26] Peter gave it back to the blind
[1:10:28] ministers and he said, "This day the
[1:10:30] scripture is
[1:10:33] fulfilled." Hallelujah. Brother Benham
[1:10:36] says here he he was doing exactly what
[1:10:39] God had prophesied it would happen. He
[1:10:41] didn't miss seeing it. He says, "How
[1:10:43] could they miss seen? They should have
[1:10:45] known right quick seen that his ministry
[1:10:48] was there, the Messiah was there. They
[1:10:51] would have known it because the
[1:10:52] scripture is fulfilled."
[1:10:55] So he comes and he reads the scripture
[1:10:57] and still they don't see it.
[1:11:00] Says this day the scripture is
[1:11:01] fulfilled.
[1:11:03] Hallelujah. And they still missed it.
[1:11:05] But Jesus knew his position.
[1:11:09] And I believe the bride is coming in
[1:11:11] process where she knows her position in
[1:11:14] the word. Hallelujah. That's why the
[1:11:17] devil can't move you, brother. He tried
[1:11:20] in many ways to shake you. Many things
[1:11:23] is floating around. Many heavy things is
[1:11:25] going out, but here you
[1:11:28] standing. They said you won't make it.
[1:11:31] But here you stand. In 2016, you're
[1:11:33] still standing for the word.
[1:11:35] They said you won't make it. But here
[1:11:37] you are anointed with the Holy Spirit.
[1:11:41] Here you are with the power of God upon
[1:11:44] your life. The word of God in you. You
[1:11:46] anointed with what? The Holy Spirit.
[1:11:54] [Applause]
[1:12:00] Now when Jesus got baptized in Matthew
[1:12:02] 1,
[1:12:04] uh the father, the voice said, uh my
[1:12:07] this is my beloved son in my priest to
[1:12:09] dwelling.
[1:12:12] But it didn't stop there. The Bible says
[1:12:14] he grew,
[1:12:16] right?
[1:12:17] You see many people they have the first
[1:12:19] experience and that's where they stop
[1:12:22] and they think there's nothing left but
[1:12:24] if you watch Jesus from there he begin
[1:12:27] to do miracles nothing before that he
[1:12:30] was challenged in the wilderness by the
[1:12:32] enemy with the word but he knew the his
[1:12:34] position. So every time the enemy said
[1:12:37] this he said but the scripture also says
[1:12:41] so he knew the word he was the word but
[1:12:43] you see when he came out and then he
[1:12:45] went but eventually he came to mount
[1:12:48] transfiguration Matthew 17 my now he's
[1:12:52] taken up
[1:12:54] why he was about the father's business
[1:12:57] but now the father is so pleased he says
[1:13:00] come up to mount transfiguration
[1:13:02] hallelujah here come the same voice. My
[1:13:06] This is my beloved son. But he added
[1:13:08] three more words. Here he him.
[1:13:13] Hallelujah. The same words, but now he's
[1:13:16] adopting his own son and he's giving him
[1:13:19] authority. Don't hear me anymore. Hear
[1:13:22] he him. Brother, there's a bride on the
[1:13:24] road. Hey, there's a people in the land.
[1:13:28] There's a people about the father's
[1:13:30] business. And one of these days there'll
[1:13:32] be three words added. Here, he,
[1:13:37] her, she becomes the final voice to the
[1:13:41] final age. She will be God's mouthpiece.
[1:13:45] She will speak for God.
[1:13:49] Come on, devil. Did you hear that? She
[1:13:52] becomes the final voice.
[1:14:01] Hallelujah.
[1:14:03] He says God was adopting his own son.
[1:14:07] Shine him out in the in glorified trans
[1:14:09] uh transfigured condition and prove
[1:14:12] before witnesses this is my beloved son
[1:14:15] here. He him. No wonder Jesus could say
[1:14:18] all power in heaven and earth is given
[1:14:20] in my hands. So if God did that to his
[1:14:23] own son, what about the sons of God? You
[1:14:27] think God is not going to adopt you,
[1:14:29] brother? You are
[1:14:31] predestinated to adoption. That's your
[1:14:34] destiny.
[1:14:42] My hallelujah.
[1:14:45] So you see God added three more words
[1:14:48] and God showed that he adopted his own
[1:14:51] son and the Bible says here our uh Jesus
[1:14:54] knew his position for he was the Messiah
[1:14:57] and he knew his unfailing faith put him
[1:14:59] in a position to know that he was the
[1:15:02] perfectborn son. Amen. Then it is if
[1:15:05] your faith will put you in a position to
[1:15:08] know that every divine promise of God's
[1:15:11] Bible is for you just as sure that
[1:15:14] pertain to him every promise that
[1:15:16] pertain to you. Your healing your
[1:15:19] salvation your freedom your sin from
[1:15:22] selfishness from indifference your
[1:15:25] little turtle shell that you pull
[1:15:27] yourself into. Christ wants to come in
[1:15:30] and be Lord and ruler and set you free
[1:15:34] from
[1:15:36] things. Oh, did you hear that? He wants
[1:15:39] to come in. Hallelujah. And set you free
[1:15:44] from things, brother. Set you free from
[1:15:47] from oats and from grudges and from
[1:15:50] things that bind you. God wants to come
[1:15:53] in and break the shackles. And I believe
[1:15:57] tonight, I believe in these meetings,
[1:16:00] we're going to see God baptize people
[1:16:03] with the Holy Ghost. Break chains and
[1:16:07] feathers.
[1:16:08] Hallelujah. Come on. Come on, man.
[1:16:11] Preach back to me. He's going to do it.
[1:16:14] Not me, not the ministers. He's coming
[1:16:17] into
[1:16:21] you. Can I say something? I can't come
[1:16:24] into you, but he can.
[1:16:29] Hallelujah. He can come into you and set
[1:16:32] you free.
[1:16:42] So he can break you free from things
[1:16:45] that holds you captive.
[1:16:48] And and and we must be honest. Brother
[1:16:50] Peter said we must be honest with
[1:16:51] ourselves.
[1:16:53] God can't help you if you're not honest
[1:16:55] with yourself. You must admit, I got a
[1:16:58] problem.
[1:17:00] You must tell him in these meetings,
[1:17:02] Lord, I'm here. I tried myself. I
[1:17:05] failed. I keep on going back, but Lord,
[1:17:08] I'm here for a purpose, and I heard
[1:17:11] tonight he can set me free.
[1:17:16] [Applause]
[1:17:19] My We look at the first Adam. He was a
[1:17:22] son in control. He could speak to
[1:17:25] nature. He had dominion over the earth.
[1:17:28] Could control the water. Speak to the
[1:17:30] trees. Speak to the mountains. He was a
[1:17:32] son in control.
[1:17:35] Amen.
[1:17:37] So here comes the second Adam, Jesus. He
[1:17:40] was God made flesh in Jesus. And he
[1:17:44] demonstrated the power of God as a son
[1:17:47] in control.
[1:17:50] Cursed the fig tree. Hallelujah.
[1:17:52] My multiplied the fish. Hallelujah.
[1:17:56] Hallelujah.
[1:17:58] He demonstrated that as a son of God.
[1:18:03] But brother, I want to I want us to
[1:18:05] swing and fast forward to this day.
[1:18:10] Hallelujah.
[1:18:12] But God in this day came down and dwelt
[1:18:15] in the body of a man called William
[1:18:17] Brham that came by sexual desire through
[1:18:20] a holy wedlock. But this man from
[1:18:24] nothing.
[1:18:25] [Applause]
[1:18:28] Oh, I hope you hear me man. This man
[1:18:32] Adam spoke to what was there already.
[1:18:36] Jesus took what was there already.
[1:18:40] But in this day,
[1:18:42] hallelujah, this man, he came and there
[1:18:46] was nothing. But he said, "Let there
[1:18:50] be." And there was, "Let there be a
[1:18:54] squirrel." That from nothing. Brother,
[1:18:57] he spoke something. I'm yet to tell you,
[1:19:00] brother, that God could do it in Adam,
[1:19:03] but Adam was created flesh. He could do
[1:19:06] it in Jesus. Jesus was God's flesh. But
[1:19:10] he came and showed us in this day in a
[1:19:13] man that came by sexual desire a man
[1:19:16] like you and me and
[1:19:20] spoke. Let there be a squirrel. Let
[1:19:24] there be a squirrel over there. Let
[1:19:26] there be one over there. And there was a
[1:19:29] squirrel. Oh, hallelujah. Come on,
[1:19:32] brother. Come on. This that we have is
[1:19:36] greater man. God showed he's going to do
[1:19:39] it again.
[1:19:43] [Applause]
[1:20:02] My I feel the anointing on that man. If
[1:20:06] you can see that revelation in Adam, we
[1:20:09] believed it. He was created. Jesus, we
[1:20:13] believe it. He was a son of God. But in
[1:20:15] those day, he took a man
[1:20:18] born like you and me. Yes. And Adam and
[1:20:23] Jesus to create it.
[1:20:25] But in this day, my God, he says here,
[1:20:30] notice when Jesus created bread, he took
[1:20:32] a piece of bread and he created more
[1:20:34] bread, something that already been
[1:20:37] bread. When he created fish, he took
[1:20:39] fish that was first fish created fish
[1:20:42] and put another fish on it. Is that
[1:20:45] right? Yeah. He He turned water into
[1:20:48] wine that would have been potentially
[1:20:50] become wine and made wine out of it. But
[1:20:53] we seen him in our midst. Listen to the
[1:20:55] prophet in the last days create things
[1:20:59] right out without anything standing
[1:21:02] there. Is that right? To create the
[1:21:05] squirrel where there was no squirrel.
[1:21:08] Hallelujah.
[1:21:10] You think God can't heal you? If he
[1:21:12] could speak a squirrel into existence,
[1:21:15] he can speak away your sickness. He can
[1:21:18] speak away your troubles, your burdens,
[1:21:21] your trials, your bondage. He can speak
[1:21:24] it
[1:21:26] away. That's a God we serve tonight. He
[1:21:29] knows your condition. He knows where you
[1:21:32] are. He knows what you're going through.
[1:21:39] [Applause]
[1:21:43] Hallelujah. Speak the word. Speak for
[1:21:46] your family. Speak for your children.
[1:21:49] Speak for your child. I don't care where
[1:21:52] they are. They might be drug addicts.
[1:21:55] They might be prostitutes. But I'm
[1:21:57] speaking the
[1:21:59] word. Send the Holy Ghost after them.
[1:22:03] Speak the word. Mother. Speak the word.
[1:22:10] [Applause]
[1:22:13] Hallelujah. Speak the word. You got to
[1:22:16] say it. Speak for your family. Speak for
[1:22:20] your church. Speak for their members,
[1:22:23] man. You know them. Speak the words of
[1:22:26] your children. Say, "Lord, when I get
[1:22:28] back home, may they be changed." If God
[1:22:32] can speak a
[1:22:33] squirrel, what about our families? What
[1:22:37] about our souls? What about ourselves?
[1:22:40] Speak the word.
[1:22:46] [Applause]
[1:22:53] Hallelujah.
[1:22:57] My
[1:23:00] the spoken word created
[1:23:04] created a squirrel.
[1:23:07] And before that the Holy Spirit asked
[1:23:10] and the angel asked him, "How many do
[1:23:12] you want?" That's right. And he said,
[1:23:13] "Three."
[1:23:15] So he already spoke the word. Three. And
[1:23:19] then he shot the one. He picked it up.
[1:23:21] He said, "No, this is not a vision. This
[1:23:23] is real. A vision don't bleed. That's
[1:23:25] right. And then he spoke another one and
[1:23:28] he he went there and he shot it and he
[1:23:30] came back and he thought, well, that's
[1:23:32] fine. He was about to leave. But
[1:23:35] brother, watch this, man. Once the word
[1:23:38] is spoken,
[1:23:41] God can't take back his word.
[1:23:44] Hallelujah.
[1:23:45] God can't take back his word.
[1:23:48] the and and while he's walking the angel
[1:23:51] said, "But didn't you say three?"
[1:23:54] [Applause]
[1:23:55] Hallelujah. That's why tonight you got
[1:23:57] to believe what you ask. Speak it by
[1:24:00] faith.
[1:24:02] And then he he went back. He tried to
[1:24:04] make it real uh difficult. And he says,
[1:24:07] "May come from the farmers over there
[1:24:09] and run and sit in the thorn tree." And
[1:24:11] he said, "You never find a squirrel in
[1:24:13] the thorn tree." That's right. And then
[1:24:15] he shot him. And then he went back. I
[1:24:19] like what Billy Paul said. He said, "No
[1:24:21] one will tell him it wasn't true." He
[1:24:23] says, "I ate those
[1:24:27] squirrels." Hallelujah.
[1:24:30] Brother Billy Bo says, "I ate of that
[1:24:31] squirrels that was shot, brother." But
[1:24:33] what I'm trying to say, the Bible says,
[1:24:36] "If a sparrow falls to the ground, how
[1:24:39] much and God knows about it, how much
[1:24:41] more his children?" If he could speak a
[1:24:44] a squirrel into existence, what about
[1:24:46] you tonight? He knows your heart. He'll
[1:24:49] speak to your condition. He'll speak to
[1:24:52] that, brother.
[1:24:54] Hallelujah.
[1:24:56] My I can't get away from it, man.
[1:24:58] There's a fire on it. Speak the word.
[1:25:03] You see, it came to a place where God
[1:25:05] gave William Brham authority.
[1:25:10] Yeah. He him. So when the prophet was
[1:25:12] here, he could speak.
[1:25:14] [Applause]
[1:25:16] And it came to pass. Why? He was an
[1:25:18] adopted son.
[1:25:20] He was a son in control. And brother
[1:25:23] Isaac quoted, "He spoke to the storm.
[1:25:27] He spoke to the fish. He spoke to
[1:25:29] sister.
[1:25:32] My He spoke to the little fish. I mean,
[1:25:35] before the doctors touch his wife, this
[1:25:38] man was a son in control.
[1:25:42] So God demonstrated in this day what it
[1:25:47] will be like when Okay, let me quote
[1:25:50] this. If you go to Leviticus, they say
[1:25:53] when the harvest is harvested,
[1:25:56] the first fruits, the first corn that
[1:25:58] comes to maturity, they harvest it. Come
[1:26:02] on. And then the he goes before the
[1:26:04] priest. Come on now. And if the priest
[1:26:07] wave this harvested matured seed over
[1:26:10] the
[1:26:11] congregation hallelujah as an acceptance
[1:26:16] that the rest of the crop
[1:26:19] is also coming to
[1:26:21] maturity. Well, I'm here to tell you if
[1:26:24] William Brham came to maturity, there's
[1:26:27] a people here that's coming to
[1:26:30] maturity. He was waved for our
[1:26:33] acceptance.
[1:26:35] So you are already accepted. Don't let
[1:26:38] the devil lie to you. God already
[1:26:41] accepted you.
[1:26:56] My
[1:26:59] so it's waved as an acceptance
[1:27:02] that the rest of the crop that's still
[1:27:04] green
[1:27:05] still green
[1:27:07] they still have their mistakes
[1:27:09] and the critics are pointing on and they
[1:27:12] claim this and they claim that but look
[1:27:14] that hey we're still green but listen
[1:27:17] brother there's a prophecy already
[1:27:20] that's hanging over you. Wherever you
[1:27:22] go, that prophecy hangs over you. I
[1:27:26] don't care where they put you, that
[1:27:28] prophecy hangs over you. I don't care if
[1:27:31] they kick you out of their church, the
[1:27:33] prophecy is still over you. I don't care
[1:27:35] if they don't accept you, the prophecy
[1:27:37] is still there, brother. It can't be
[1:27:40] altered because you are part of God's
[1:27:43] program. You are part of God's purpose.
[1:27:47] You are part of God's predestination.
[1:27:51] [Applause]
[1:28:06] Hallelujah.
[1:28:09] might it's kind of hard to break from
[1:28:11] here but somehow brother sister let me
[1:28:14] just another thing quickly
[1:28:17] and I when it comes like this I have to
[1:28:19] say it brother Brandham you remember
[1:28:21] brother Evans they stole his car
[1:28:25] and he went to brother BM says they
[1:28:26] stole the car all our clothes everything
[1:28:29] is in it brother says let me go in
[1:28:31] prayer goes in prayer while he's in
[1:28:35] prayer he picks up this guy driving the
[1:28:38] car all the way down. Brother Brenam in
[1:28:41] prayer, brother, he sent the Holy Spirit
[1:28:44] after that man. Go get that man. Convict
[1:28:48] that man. Turn him
[1:28:50] around. In prayer, brother, a man born
[1:28:54] like you and me could send the Holy
[1:28:57] Ghost after a car that was stolen. And
[1:29:01] the man turned around. He drove all the
[1:29:04] way back, left the car, jumped out and
[1:29:07] ran. And brother Ben says, "Brother
[1:29:09] Evans, your car is parked at so place."
[1:29:12] Woo! Everything is still there.
[1:29:15] Hallelujah. If God went after a car, how
[1:29:20] much more a soul, how much more the
[1:29:23] souls of men, how much more you and me?
[1:29:28] If God could bring back a motor car,
[1:29:31] can't he bring back our children? Can't
[1:29:33] he bring back our families? Can't he
[1:29:36] bring back a mother? Bring back your
[1:29:39] father, bring back your sister, bring
[1:29:42] back your brother. If the Holy Spirit
[1:29:45] brought back a motor
[1:29:47] car, you can bring back your
[1:29:51] children.
[1:29:52] Hallelujah.
[1:29:54] Hallelujah. Come on. Come
[1:30:02] on. Come on, brother. Speak the word
[1:30:06] tonight. Oh, I feel the anointing. The
[1:30:09] Holy Ghost is in the
[1:30:11] building. Speak the word.
[1:30:38] Hallelujah.
[1:30:40] Why was the sun in control? Yeah.
[1:30:45] Nature must have had a jubilee
[1:30:48] because you see the sons of God will
[1:30:50] deliver nature. You say, "Brother
[1:30:52] Raymon, why must we be adopted?"
[1:30:55] Because the scripture Romans 9, go read
[1:30:58] it. Is waiting on who?
[1:31:01] On the sons of God to come to where?
[1:31:05] Manifestation. And when they get to that
[1:31:08] place, then they deliver nature.
[1:31:12] And we ourselves, we grown in this body.
[1:31:15] You grown. You moan, you tired, you
[1:31:18] aching, you hurting, you sick. It's it's
[1:31:21] because there's another body. There's
[1:31:24] another body just here calling you,
[1:31:27] pulling you, saying, "Come on, don't
[1:31:30] give up. Keep pressing. Keep going.
[1:31:33] Don't give up
[1:31:35] now." Young people, don't give up now.
[1:31:39] It's worth it. It's worth it to serve
[1:31:42] God. There's a reward, man. There's a
[1:31:45] reward at the end of the road.
[1:31:49] [Applause]
[1:31:56] Hallelujah.
[1:31:59] You might be feeling discouraged. You
[1:32:02] might be so downhearted. You might be
[1:32:04] ready to chuck in the towel. You might
[1:32:06] be saying, "But there's no
[1:32:08] manifestation." Service after service,
[1:32:11] dryness after dryness. Brother, listen.
[1:32:14] That means nothing. Paul says, "In
[1:32:17] season, out of season, dry season,
[1:32:20] whatever." But there's coming a time.
[1:32:24] Oh, hallelujah.
[1:32:25] Let me prophesy from the words of
[1:32:27] Malachi 4. There's coming a time.
[1:32:31] There's coming a time when God is going
[1:32:34] to place his pride in position, brother.
[1:32:38] No demon, no devil, no nothing will be
[1:32:40] able to discourage you anymore because
[1:32:43] he will be failed in your flesh.
[1:32:48] Hallelujah. He will come down. He will
[1:32:51] baptize you with the Holy Ghost and
[1:32:53] fire. He will seal your life. He will
[1:32:56] baptize you. Woo! Hallelujah.
[1:33:00] [Applause]
[1:33:05] My
[1:33:08] sons of God are coming back.
[1:33:11] So you see there's a process. So uh you
[1:33:15] remember when uh Elijah told Gassi go
[1:33:18] look and he came back he says ah there's
[1:33:20] nothing.
[1:33:22] So every time they go and they go look
[1:33:24] ah there's nothing and he says go up
[1:33:27] seven times man. And when he went up
[1:33:30] just you know casual there's nothing.
[1:33:34] But brother I tell you when he went on
[1:33:35] that seventh time and he looked all he
[1:33:38] saw was a cloud the size of a man's
[1:33:42] hand. Woo. He started running down the
[1:33:45] mountain. He told Elijah, "Hey, I see a
[1:33:48] cloud like a man's hand." Did Did Elijah
[1:33:52] say nice? Hey, just that one little one
[1:33:56] little cloud the size brother. He jumped
[1:33:59] up there. He was no more tired. He said,
[1:34:02] "Go tell them. Tell AB sound the rain
[1:34:05] bells. I hear the sound of abundance of
[1:34:07] rain. Oh, I'm yet to tell you, brother.
[1:34:10] I hear the sound of abundance of rain.
[1:34:14] It's going to rain. The rain clouds are
[1:34:17] here. Get ready for the outpouring of
[1:34:20] the baptism of the Holy Spirit. The
[1:34:23] dynamics is going to pour out upon
[1:34:27] you. Sound the rain bells. Tell
[1:34:30] everybody when you go back, "Hey, it's
[1:34:33] going to rain." Tell those that are
[1:34:35] discouraged, "Hey, come on. It's going
[1:34:38] to rain. Woo! It's going to rain. It's
[1:34:41] going to rain. It's going to rain." Tell
[1:34:44] them it's going to rain.
[1:34:49] I'm here tonight to tell you it's going
[1:34:50] to rain. Get ready for it. It's not long
[1:34:54] to go. It's not long to go anymore.
[1:35:02] Going back is further,
[1:35:04] but it's easier to carry on because
[1:35:06] we're nearer the shore.
[1:35:09] Hallelujah.
[1:35:20] My
[1:35:24] man.
[1:35:26] Okay,
[1:35:30] let me go this way. Hallelujah. We all
[1:35:33] know Jonah
[1:35:35] in Matthew 12 and we know in the book of
[1:35:38] Jonah
[1:35:39] just to show
[1:35:42] you God don't alter his plan. Amen. No
[1:35:46] matter what we think goes wrong. Amen.
[1:35:50] Right.
[1:35:52] And sometimes when something go wrong,
[1:35:53] we become so discouraged, we don't even
[1:35:56] want to serve God anymore.
[1:35:58] But this man Jonah has a commission to
[1:36:02] go down to Nineveh
[1:36:05] with a message to repent or perish. But
[1:36:10] this man is so disobedient
[1:36:13] and many peri backsliden
[1:36:17] and he he goes and he takes a a ship
[1:36:19] instead of going to Nineveh he goes to
[1:36:22] Tarsus
[1:36:24] and he goes right to the bottom of the
[1:36:26] ship and go lays there and he thinks
[1:36:28] well the conviction will leave me
[1:36:32] you think well I I'm okay and there the
[1:36:34] boat takes off all of a sudden the boat
[1:36:37] is in trouble. Yes.
[1:36:40] And they chuck over the cargo and the
[1:36:43] boat is still in trouble. And the
[1:36:45] captain goes out and he finds this guy
[1:36:47] at ease there.
[1:36:51] So Jonah thought, "Here's a way out for
[1:36:52] me, man." So he says, "No, I'm the
[1:36:55] problem. Chuck me overboard."
[1:36:57] You thought, "Well, I I'll even take my
[1:36:59] own life. Chuck me overboard."
[1:37:02] Meanwhile, when he gets chucked
[1:37:03] overboard,
[1:37:05] there's a mess of fish.
[1:37:09] swallowing.
[1:37:11] And the Bible says, "When a fish ate,
[1:37:12] eats, it goes all the way to the bottom
[1:37:15] cuz he's full." Now
[1:37:18] we say, "No, Jonah is backsliding."
[1:37:22] Right? This man, you quoted, "Brother
[1:37:25] Peter, running from the presence of
[1:37:26] God."
[1:37:28] But let me show you something, man. Come
[1:37:30] on. He lays there for three days.
[1:37:34] And Bible says in the vomit of the
[1:37:36] whale,
[1:37:38] And by faith he turned towards the
[1:37:40] temple and he says God your servant when
[1:37:43] he dedicated the temple said if one of
[1:37:46] your children is in trouble and they
[1:37:48] look towards the temple he will hear
[1:37:51] their prayer and Jonah by faith looked
[1:37:53] towards the temple and he prayed and all
[1:37:58] of a sudden the fish
[1:38:00] awakes. My god the fish awakes and then
[1:38:04] the fish takes off. Where do you think
[1:38:06] he's
[1:38:08] going? All the way to
[1:38:11] Nineveh. Going to
[1:38:13] h this man is not supposed to be in
[1:38:17] Tarsus. He's supposed to be in
[1:38:21] Nineveh. You can think you're running,
[1:38:23] man. You think you're running away from
[1:38:26] God. You think you're getting away from
[1:38:29] him, but God has got a plan for your
[1:38:32] life. God has got a plan for you, man.
[1:38:35] God has got something in store for you.
[1:38:38] Woo!
[1:38:39] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:38:51] So many times we think when things go
[1:38:54] wrong, we're so quick to condemn people.
[1:38:58] We're so quick to point a finger. We so
[1:39:01] I mean it's human. We do it. We write
[1:39:04] them off. We scrap them. That's why I
[1:39:07] don't I don't put nobody down, brother.
[1:39:10] Cuz you find out that very person you
[1:39:11] put on, God back to them. And there you
[1:39:15] put them down. He can't preach. He can't
[1:39:18] do this. She can't sing. She
[1:39:22] hold your peace, man.
[1:39:33] But just to show you, I had a message
[1:39:36] here looking through God's eyes. So look
[1:39:39] how God looks at it. Amen. So he swims
[1:39:42] all the way to Nineveh.
[1:39:44] Come to find out they serve the fish
[1:39:47] god. And brother says, "And they were
[1:39:50] fishermen. And this fish swims all the
[1:39:53] way to the shore, puts out his tongue,
[1:39:56] and here Jonah comes walking
[1:39:58] out.
[1:40:00] Hallelujah. And he preaches a message of
[1:40:03] repentance. And the whole of Nineveh
[1:40:07] repents. You see, God cannot alter his
[1:40:11] plan about you.
[1:40:16] You say, "I might be backsliding." Yeah,
[1:40:18] you might be. But he's going to restore
[1:40:20] you. He's going to bring you back
[1:40:22] because he has a purpose for you.
[1:40:32] Now, now, now come I show you how
[1:40:34] powerful this story of Jonah is.
[1:40:37] Jesus comes in Matthew 12:40. Yes, sir.
[1:40:41] He says, "As Jonah was three days and
[1:40:45] nights in the whale's belly,
[1:40:51] I mean, we said backsliding, right? We
[1:40:54] said no. Out of the will of God. We said
[1:40:57] no. No. Jonah's no good. Jesus knew
[1:41:01] about it. He comes back and he says,
[1:41:02] "No, Jonah was fulfilling a type that I
[1:41:06] must fulfill.
[1:41:09] [Applause]
[1:41:10] [Music]
[1:41:12] [Applause]
[1:41:17] Yes sir. As Jonah was three days and
[1:41:20] nights in the whale's belly, so shall
[1:41:21] the Son of Man be three days and nights
[1:41:24] in the heart of the earth. So was he
[1:41:27] backsliding?
[1:41:28] [Music]
[1:41:32] Be careful how you answer.
[1:41:37] Be careful when you judge someone else
[1:41:39] next
[1:41:40] time. Amen. Hallelujah. Right.
[1:41:45] [Music]
[1:41:47] Brother Bam says God knows our
[1:41:50] situations that we human
[1:41:53] and that we make mistakes.
[1:41:56] But he says the footsteps of the
[1:41:58] righteous is ordered of God.
[1:42:02] And the same man that we thought was
[1:42:04] backsliden, Christ comes and picks up
[1:42:06] that. Hallelujah. and say, "No, he was
[1:42:08] fulfilling his like like he was three
[1:42:10] days and nights in the bottom of the
[1:42:13] ocean in the whale's belly. So must the
[1:42:14] son of man be in the belly of the whale
[1:42:18] of the earth." So be careful next time.
[1:42:22] Hallelujah. Rather sympathize with that
[1:42:24] person. Try and put yourself says in his
[1:42:27] shoes
[1:42:31] and understand where he or she's coming
[1:42:33] from
[1:42:36] because you know in the message it's
[1:42:37] just so easily
[1:42:40] that's why I I like the a couple love of
[1:42:43] God. Paul said nothing will separate us
[1:42:47] from the love of God
[1:42:50] that's in Christ Jesus. Nothing will cut
[1:42:52] us off this way. But fully your love.
[1:42:56] It cuts you off. It's limited.
[1:43:00] It loves only those who loves
[1:43:02] themselves.
[1:43:04] It only loves those who are good to
[1:43:05] them.
[1:43:07] That's fial love. If you don't agree
[1:43:09] with them,
[1:43:12] fellowship is gone.
[1:43:14] But po but Paul says
[1:43:17] nothing. And then he goes through all of
[1:43:19] his sickness, sorrow, heartaches,
[1:43:21] trials, death. Nothing this way will
[1:43:25] separate you from the love of God that's
[1:43:28] in Christ Jesus. You might be in a
[1:43:31] backsplitting condition, but if you are
[1:43:33] a member of the bride, I'm telling you
[1:43:36] already connected, brother. And the God,
[1:43:39] the Holy Spirit is on the earth to call
[1:43:42] everyone that's predestinated to go in
[1:43:45] the rapture.
[1:43:53] He says here in reproach for the cause
[1:43:55] of the word. Remember if he has called
[1:43:57] you for this there is nothing that can
[1:44:00] keep it from happening. There's not
[1:44:02] enough devils in torment but what God's
[1:44:05] word will be made manifest. Listen you
[1:44:08] born for a purpose and nobody can take
[1:44:10] your place. Now look at it. Nobody could
[1:44:13] take Jonah's place. There when Moses,
[1:44:15] one of the brothers preached, went down.
[1:44:17] He murdered a man and ran for his life.
[1:44:21] Did God cut him off? I said, "No, he's a
[1:44:24] murderer now. I can't use him." No. He
[1:44:26] was called for that purpose. What did
[1:44:28] God do? He went in the wilderness.
[1:44:32] He is prophet man. He put a bush on
[1:44:36] fire. Called Moses. Moses. And when
[1:44:39] Moses turned, he says, "Man, then God
[1:44:42] spoke to him." Amen. You see, God don't
[1:44:44] change his mind about you. There's no
[1:44:47] bleach can take your name off the lamb's
[1:44:49] book of life. There's no eraser that can
[1:44:52] erase it.
[1:44:57] You see, when you look with God's eyes,
[1:44:59] it's different.
[1:45:01] And no one can take his place. He says
[1:45:03] you're born for a purpose and nobody can
[1:45:05] take your place. You might have
[1:45:07] impersonators and everything else, but
[1:45:09] they'll never take your place. Right?
[1:45:11] God's word will triumph. It cannot fail.
[1:45:15] There there is where every Christian
[1:45:17] ought to stand knowing that the trials
[1:45:20] will come and seem every way to you. But
[1:45:23] remember, God has a purpose and it will
[1:45:27] work out right.
[1:45:30] Hallelujah. Sister, take courage
[1:45:32] tonight. You might be in a situation.
[1:45:34] You don't know how you come. But he says
[1:45:36] all those trials, it's going to work out
[1:45:39] all right. Amen. My my my
[1:45:42] Oh, it makes me feel no one can take
[1:45:44] your place. That you might have
[1:45:46] impersonators. You might have people
[1:45:48] that try to be like you, but they can't
[1:45:51] take your place. God has a specific
[1:45:53] place for you. I want to say this one on
[1:45:56] love. Brother Peter struck it. And so
[1:45:59] many of the ministers brother says, you
[1:46:01] know, he didn't like to be around
[1:46:02] people. Not that he didn't love them,
[1:46:05] but he didn't like to be around them.
[1:46:06] That's right. He says cuz they come
[1:46:08] right up to you and hug you and say my
[1:46:10] precious brother I love you. And then
[1:46:12] brother Ben says he looks right into the
[1:46:14] heart
[1:46:16] and he says this man don't even mean one
[1:46:20] of his saint. He says for that reason he
[1:46:23] preferred to be he says I didn't want to
[1:46:25] know that about my brothers. You see
[1:46:28] this a gapo love you can't impersonate
[1:46:31] it. You can't you can't manufacture it.
[1:46:35] If you do, it's going to show up
[1:46:38] down the line. It's going to come out.
[1:46:40] Like brother Peter said, you can't hide.
[1:46:43] So you see what we're looking for and
[1:46:45] and this is how I feel, brother, over it
[1:46:47] is we're looking for that genuine
[1:46:51] true baptism of the Holy Ghost that
[1:46:54] comes with a genuine love of God where
[1:46:57] the prophets will be standing speaking
[1:46:59] like this and a love spirit would settle
[1:47:02] over the building. All the wrongs will
[1:47:04] be made right. The sick will be healed
[1:47:07] without any hands laid upon them. Why?
[1:47:10] The real genuine a couple love of
[1:47:13] God. And when that comes in, then it's
[1:47:17] easy to love your enemies. It's easy to
[1:47:19] love those who hate you. It's easy. Why?
[1:47:22] Because it's not fully your love. It's
[1:47:24] not manufactured love. It's the Holy
[1:47:27] Ghost love of God that shed abroad in
[1:47:30] your heart.
[1:47:34] Run for your life, man.
[1:47:47] We seen enough. I got to quote you. I
[1:47:50] said the time for playing is over.
[1:47:53] Said God is bringing his pride to
[1:47:55] manhood.
[1:47:57] No more children.
[1:47:59] I once was a child. I spake like a
[1:48:01] child. I did child. But he says his
[1:48:03] bride has matured now. She's grown. We
[1:48:06] don't do things like we did it back. You
[1:48:08] know what I mean? Change. Christ grew to
[1:48:12] Mount Transfiguration.
[1:48:14] We growing to Mount Dynamics.
[1:48:18] Hallelujah. We growing to Mount Pyramid.
[1:48:22] Hallelujah. Where charity will meet us
[1:48:25] real. Right. So we climb in those seven
[1:48:27] steps. We add in those virtues by faith.
[1:48:30] We fall but we get up by revelation I'm
[1:48:33] going again
[1:48:36] you see it's a revelation
[1:48:38] and you keep adding but one day charity
[1:48:41] himself hallelujah the love of God
[1:48:45] brother and someone said one of the
[1:48:46] ministers you won't have to say you see
[1:48:48] what I got
[1:48:50] I think brother said that you see what I
[1:48:53] got no he said it will speak for itself
[1:49:00] I love that.
[1:49:03] I spoke to one of the ministers that met
[1:49:05] brother Brandham and he says brother
[1:49:09] Bram came into his home. He says within
[1:49:11] 10 ft before you come to brother
[1:49:13] Brandham, you hit something. You just
[1:49:16] hit the presence. You know you're in the
[1:49:18] supernatural.
[1:49:22] Brother Brandon didn't say a word. He
[1:49:24] said you just walked and you felt it.
[1:49:26] You saw many times he stands behind the
[1:49:28] pulpit and he won't move. He'll say,
[1:49:30] "Come to me." And when they come, he
[1:49:31] says, "Don't be scared. That's only his
[1:49:33] presence."
[1:49:40] Now, now if I seen a silver dollar, come
[1:49:44] on. Come on. I seen a silver dollar.
[1:49:47] What a a a man what a manifested son
[1:49:50] must be like. So when I see all these
[1:49:53] pennies
[1:49:54] trying to imitate a silver dollar,
[1:49:57] brother, I already seen what a son of
[1:50:00] God looks like. Away with the pennies,
[1:50:03] man. We don't need
[1:50:05] them. And it takes a 100 pennies to make
[1:50:10] $1. Hallelujah. Brother, you don't need
[1:50:14] numbers. You don't need people. You
[1:50:16] don't need multitudes. All you need is
[1:50:19] one man, one woman filled with the Holy
[1:50:23] Ghost and a silver dollar was
[1:50:26] demonstrated. So we know what a son of
[1:50:28] God must be like. And brother, when I
[1:50:31] see them, I just shake my head, tell
[1:50:34] your story walking until I see this.
[1:50:37] Then I know God is back on the earth
[1:50:40] again. God is back in his bride. God is
[1:50:44] back in his people. Why? When I see this
[1:50:47] made manifest, I know God is back on the
[1:50:50] earth manifested in his people. That's
[1:50:53] why we grow into
[1:50:55] [Applause]
[1:51:05] adoption. Amen.
[1:51:08] [Applause]
[1:51:11] Hallelujah.
[1:51:22] We want to see silver dollars, man. We
[1:51:26] tired of the pennies. Everyone claiming
[1:51:29] I got this, I got that. You got nothing.
[1:51:31] Until I see this demonstrated, then I
[1:51:35] know, hey, something is happening. Oh,
[1:51:37] when I come into Nigeria and I say, the
[1:51:40] power of God is on the earth, brother. I
[1:51:42] hear the dead is raised. The blind eyes
[1:51:44] are opening. The word is there. I know
[1:51:47] God is on the earth. Come to Nigeria
[1:51:49] again. Hey, I hear. Hey, praise God.
[1:51:52] Brother Brandon just walked in.
[1:51:54] Hallelujah. Came into behind the
[1:51:56] pullpit. Why? then you know God is back
[1:51:59] on the earth when we start seeing this
[1:52:01] happening. But until then, we go on.
[1:52:06] Next year, if I'm here and the Lord
[1:52:07] spare me, I'll be preaching this again.
[1:52:10] If it didn't happen in between that
[1:52:11] time, Brother Jesse, I'll be preaching
[1:52:14] it again. I'll be like, "No, I'll say it
[1:52:17] again. It will
[1:52:19] rain. Come back again. It will rain."
[1:52:24] The seventh thunders is a bride's
[1:52:26] revival. The seven thunders will gather
[1:52:28] the bride. The seven thunders will show
[1:52:30] you how to go. If I come back next year,
[1:52:32] you'll hear the same words. But I'm
[1:52:34] going to say it until one day when it
[1:52:37] happens. Then I know God has come and
[1:52:41] manifested. Brother Olu manifested his
[1:52:44] word. So if it don't happen, keep saying
[1:52:47] it. One day it did rain. It did rain. It
[1:52:52] did rain. One day there's going to be
[1:52:55] rapture in faith. There's going to be a
[1:52:57] revival. There's going to be a
[1:52:59] manifestation.
[1:53:06] But nobody's going to tell me I mustn't
[1:53:08] preach it. It's a promise of God,
[1:53:10] brother. Footprints are possession.
[1:53:13] Everywhere you find a promise, put your
[1:53:15] feet on the man. Found the seventh seal.
[1:53:18] Seventh thunder, seventh. Oh my.
[1:53:20] Adoption, perfection. I'm walking all
[1:53:23] over the devil. Why? It's promises,
[1:53:25] brother. And your footprints is
[1:53:27] possession. possess your land. Your
[1:53:30] land.
[1:53:37] It's your land.
[1:53:42] Let me tell you something.
[1:53:45] If you go to Joshua 22, you'll see there
[1:53:48] was three tribes. There was
[1:53:51] Manessa, half tribe of something, and
[1:53:54] tribe of Gad. They didn't possess the
[1:53:57] land. They didn't cross over. They
[1:53:58] stayed beside and they lived with the
[1:54:00] Philistines. They didn't possess it.
[1:54:03] Though they had a land there, but they
[1:54:05] preferred to stay
[1:54:10] Can you imagine? You have a promise on
[1:54:12] the other side, but you prefer to stay
[1:54:14] this side.
[1:54:17] And you're going to see I I have
[1:54:18] something I'm going to close with.
[1:54:20] You're going to see why it's important
[1:54:21] to go over
[1:54:28] You stay with demons. You stay with all
[1:54:31] kind of situations. And God can't bless
[1:54:33] you because you're not in the promised
[1:54:34] land. You're still in the wilderness.
[1:54:38] Your possession lays in the promised
[1:54:40] land. So you have to go over Jordan.
[1:54:47] [Music]
[1:54:48] [Applause]
[1:54:53] Now you ram again. Amen.
[1:54:56] They didn't cross over. That's right. So
[1:54:58] Jesus comes for one soul
[1:55:02] crosses the ocean. And he goes to a
[1:55:05] place called Gadara.
[1:55:09] Right? You remember went for one soul.
[1:55:12] One man, one man in the whole city of
[1:55:15] Gdara. Plus the man is possessed with
[1:55:18] demons. Over 2,000 demons in this man.
[1:55:22] But Jesus went for him.
[1:55:25] He was living among the tombstones and
[1:55:27] the graves.
[1:55:29] And God Jesus comes and as he put his
[1:55:32] foot on the land, the demons knew, hey,
[1:55:36] he has a son of God here.
[1:55:40] And these demons came running and and
[1:55:42] fell before him and said, "Did you come
[1:55:44] to torment us?" So they know there's a
[1:55:47] tormenting time coming.
[1:55:50] says, "Noah."
[1:55:52] And they asked for permission to go into
[1:55:54] the pigs, right? And Jesus gave them.
[1:55:57] And the pigs didn't even want to live
[1:55:58] with him. They drowned themselves.
[1:56:03] [Applause]
[1:56:05] And you find people's is prepared to
[1:56:06] live with those demons.
[1:56:10] Major demons.
[1:56:16] But this is going to shock you.
[1:56:19] He went there for that one soul and he
[1:56:20] changed him and the man wanted to follow
[1:56:22] him and he said no stay here go back to
[1:56:24] your family and whatever you know but
[1:56:26] you know what Jesus says it's the same
[1:56:29] tribe of Gad come on now gadara come on
[1:56:33] now gad
[1:56:35] he says that was the same people that's
[1:56:37] right that didn't want to possess the
[1:56:39] land there
[1:56:41] Jesus came to the very same people and
[1:56:44] they didn't want to have him have a
[1:56:47] revival in their city. They were rather
[1:56:50] prepared to live with those demons and
[1:56:53] devils.
[1:56:55] So you see why it's important cuz down
[1:56:58] the road you have children
[1:57:01] down the road you have family
[1:57:04] and you and you were challenged in the
[1:57:06] service by the Holy Spirit to change
[1:57:08] your life
[1:57:09] to get rid of that spirit to admit it
[1:57:12] because you see down the road it's got
[1:57:14] further consequences. They thought what
[1:57:16] they did there not by crossing over it
[1:57:18] stopped there. No. When Jesus came here,
[1:57:21] look how many thousands of years down he
[1:57:24] comes to the same place. And because
[1:57:26] they rejected him there, that same
[1:57:29] generations that came down rejected him
[1:57:32] here. So you see what you are sitting
[1:57:35] with now, get rid of it. Amen. Because
[1:57:38] you are cleaning yourself out. So your
[1:57:41] child can look at your life and say,
[1:57:42] "Man, my mother is a Christian. My
[1:57:46] father is a Christian. Nobody will tell
[1:57:49] me about them. The way they live, the
[1:57:51] way they act, the way they speak, the
[1:57:53] way they do things, you can see they are
[1:57:56] sons and daughters of God. That blessing
[1:57:59] that's upon you will have come upon your
[1:58:01] children and your children's children,
[1:58:03] brother, because you did something right
[1:58:06] here."
[1:58:08] Right. Hallelujah.
[1:58:11] A Abram paid tithe to Mel, but the Bible
[1:58:14] says it was uh it was uh uncounted to
[1:58:18] Levi four generations down. It says Levi
[1:58:21] paid tithes, not Abram. That's right.
[1:58:26] [Music]
[1:58:29] I'm going to have to close out.
[1:58:32] My what an anointing here.
[1:58:37] Sh.
[1:58:44] Hallelujah.
[1:58:45] [Applause]
[1:58:48] Hallelujah. So, it's important to do the
[1:58:50] right thing. That's why I say in this
[1:58:52] meeting, we can't play. We're no more
[1:58:53] children, no more babies. We can't chuck
[1:58:55] our toys constantly out of the out of
[1:58:58] the cot or out of our playfield.
[1:59:01] If this church is not right, I leave
[1:59:03] this one. There's so many other
[1:59:04] churches. I go to that church. Problem
[1:59:06] says, he can never adopt you.
[1:59:09] He can never adopt you cuz you're hop
[1:59:11] hopping from church to church,
[1:59:13] challenging the pastor, doing this. How
[1:59:15] can he adopt you?
[1:59:18] So, you need to be consistent.
[1:59:21] Hallelujah. Now, you know that word is a
[1:59:24] big word. Consistency produces results.
[1:59:31] Right, brother? I seen that the man at
[1:59:34] the pool of Bethesda went for 38 years
[1:59:38] consistent.
[1:59:40] Every day he went whether he got a
[1:59:42] blessing or not.
[1:59:45] He didn't say no man nothing happened in
[1:59:48] the service. I'm not no next day he was
[1:59:50] there again. The angel might just come
[1:59:53] today. Hallelujah. He might just happen
[1:59:55] today. It might just happen tonight. He
[1:59:58] didn't stay away. He was consistent for
[2:00:00] 38
[2:00:02] years. The man went and he kept coming.
[2:00:05] He kept coming. I didn't get my
[2:00:07] blessing. I didn't get my but the man
[2:00:09] kept coming. Consistency.
[2:00:13] So much so, brother Peter, that when the
[2:00:15] angel in flesh, he didn't come to stir
[2:00:18] the water. Proverb says he walked past
[2:00:21] multitudes of people. And he says one
[2:00:24] multitude is 2,000. So that there was
[2:00:26] multitudes.
[2:00:30] walk past all of them. Bolt with a blind
[2:00:34] triple. He keeps walking. Where do you
[2:00:37] think he's going?
[2:00:39] He went to consistency.
[2:00:42] Went to the one that was consistent.
[2:00:45] I don't care if you don't meet me
[2:00:47] tonight. I'm here tomorrow. Wednesday
[2:00:49] night, I'm back in the service. Sunday,
[2:00:51] I'm back in the service. The youth
[2:00:54] service, I'm not going to miss it. I'm
[2:00:55] there. You see, God is looking for
[2:00:57] consistency, man. People that wants him,
[2:01:01] people that's desperate, and he went for
[2:01:03] the one soul, healed him, and walked
[2:01:06] right away and left
[2:01:09] him. You think God don't know how long
[2:01:11] you're in the message, and you crying
[2:01:13] and you praying and you want God to do
[2:01:15] something for you, mother? You think God
[2:01:18] don't know you praying for your child
[2:01:19] and your children and it's 20 years
[2:01:22] already and nothing has happened and
[2:01:24] they seem to be getting worse. Don't
[2:01:25] give up. Keep praying. Keep coming. He
[2:01:28] might just come tonight. He might just
[2:01:31] come tomorrow. It might just be this
[2:01:33] weekend. He'll meet with you.
[2:01:44] [Applause]
[2:01:48] We look at Elijah and
[2:01:51] Elisha. Oh, I'm closing with this.
[2:01:54] Elisha threw Elijah threw the cloak his
[2:01:56] mantle over Elisha young man and he felt
[2:02:00] the anointing and Elijah walked away.
[2:02:04] This young man what did he do? Amen. He
[2:02:07] told his mother and father says man I'm
[2:02:08] going to follow that man chopped up this
[2:02:11] uh plow wagon and everything burnt it up
[2:02:14] and he followed Elijah and he says why
[2:02:17] you coming after me? He says hold your
[2:02:21] peace. The man had a revelation. watch.
[2:02:23] He was consistent.
[2:02:27] So we give up when we don't get it in
[2:02:29] the first or third meeting.
[2:02:32] This man said, "No, I'm going." So they
[2:02:34] leave Gilgal and they go to Bethl. And
[2:02:36] Elijah, Elijah told him, "I'm going to
[2:02:38] Bethl." He said, "I'm going with you."
[2:02:41] Say, "Why didn't you say?" He said, "No,
[2:02:42] I'm going with you." You see, he had a
[2:02:44] revelation something. He felt the
[2:02:45] anointing, the power. Glory. Glory. He
[2:02:47] says, "And I'm going with you." Then he
[2:02:49] says, "No, I'm going down to Jericho."
[2:02:51] He says, "I'm going with you. I'm
[2:02:52] following you. He says, "Why don't you
[2:02:54] stay here, man? There's the school of
[2:02:55] the prophets and there's so many of your
[2:02:57] friends." He says, "No, I'm going with
[2:02:59] you." Then Elijah tells him, "Hey, you
[2:03:02] know what? I'm going to Jordan."
[2:03:04] Oh, now we Now he's speaking
[2:03:08] because Jordan is where you die out.
[2:03:13] Jordan is the sin barrier line
[2:03:17] that many people don't want to cross.
[2:03:19] Amen. But you're going to see something
[2:03:21] if you do cross that sin barrier. Amen.
[2:03:25] And when he came to Jordan, Elijah took
[2:03:27] off his cloak, right? And he smoked
[2:03:30] Jordan.
[2:03:32] Here's the challenge now. Jordan opened
[2:03:36] and Elijah walked over. When he turned
[2:03:38] around, was behind him.
[2:03:41] Oh God. Brother, it took about 15 years
[2:03:46] for him to grow up,
[2:03:48] right?
[2:03:51] To grow into the mental, so you say,
[2:03:53] "Everyone wants the mental, but you you
[2:03:55] haven't matured. You're still acting
[2:03:57] like a baby. You still have baby ways.
[2:04:00] You still have to be treated like a
[2:04:02] baby. You're not matured enough. You
[2:04:04] haven't grown enough."
[2:04:08] So, you see the importance. But here
[2:04:10] this man crosses the barrier and Jordan
[2:04:14] closes behind them. My did the critics
[2:04:17] have fun now. Now we're going to see
[2:04:20] what's he going to do. How is he coming
[2:04:22] back now? Woo brother. There was now a
[2:04:25] question. How is this man coming back?
[2:04:27] He went overboard.
[2:04:31] God. No, he didn't go overboard. He went
[2:04:34] past the sin barrier.
[2:04:36] Let me tell you, when you cross Jordan,
[2:04:39] you're crossing over the sin barrier.
[2:04:42] And that's what holds many people back.
[2:04:44] We not prepared to die out to ourselves,
[2:04:47] die out to our own ideas and what we
[2:04:50] think and what we feel. Jordan is death.
[2:04:54] [Music]
[2:04:56] Come on.
[2:05:02] Come on. Preach back. Jordan is death.
[2:05:05] I have to die out. Raymon has to die.
[2:05:09] You have to die. When you come to
[2:05:11] Jordan, you die out.
[2:05:17] And all of a sudden, there's a fiery
[2:05:20] chariot with horses of fire. And Elijah
[2:05:23] climbs up and he asks Elisha, "What
[2:05:25] would you want me to do?" Oh,
[2:05:27] hallelujah, brother. He says, "A double
[2:05:29] portion.
[2:05:31] A double portion of what you had. I want
[2:05:35] not one portion. So we don't come to
[2:05:37] this convention bless me. No, I want a
[2:05:40] double portion. I want a double portion.
[2:05:44] Hallelujah. A double
[2:05:48] portion. And what happened? He said,
[2:05:50] "You ask a hard thing." But he chucked
[2:05:52] it down. And there was Elisha.
[2:05:57] Oh God. And when you read the story,
[2:06:00] before he even put it on, he tore his
[2:06:02] own rags.
[2:06:04] You know how good works. Hallelujah.
[2:06:06] Brother Cole used to say good self.
[2:06:11] You know I did nothing wrong. I'm so
[2:06:12] good. I'm
[2:06:15] good self.
[2:06:18] So he tore his scone clothes. And the
[2:06:20] Bible says our good works is like filthy
[2:06:23] rags. So you can't even show God your
[2:06:26] good works. Means nothing. You are
[2:06:29] predestinated. Hallelujah. Amen. That's
[2:06:32] how you come by predestination.
[2:06:35] Your name was on that book. So you So
[2:06:37] that's what the Bible says. Fore it says
[2:06:39] uh predestination looks uh fornowledge
[2:06:41] looks back to predestination.
[2:06:44] And then you see your name was on the
[2:06:46] book and you were chosen. And then your
[2:06:47] predestin looks to destiny to what you
[2:06:50] were destiny to be. Now brother that
[2:06:53] that's what keeps me. I tell you when I
[2:06:56] look at that then I say man this guy yo
[2:06:59] he's a failure. He's a no good. is
[2:07:01] nothing. But I got a promise hang in.
[2:07:03] You predestinated unto adoption. You
[2:07:06] predestinated to perfection. You
[2:07:08] predestinated to make it. So he receives
[2:07:12] the mantle and then when he has it.
[2:07:15] Oh brother.
[2:07:17] So yeah, he got the mantle.
[2:07:19] But he watched how what Elijah did.
[2:07:24] You see, we have the power.
[2:07:26] We have the mental. We have the quotes.
[2:07:29] They have the mechanics. Hallelujah. But
[2:07:31] what was his words? Hallelujah. Where's
[2:07:34] the God of who? Of Elijah. And then he
[2:07:38] struck Jordan. And when he struck it, it
[2:07:40] opened up and there he went walking
[2:07:42] across, brother. Why? The man was
[2:07:45] consistent. He crossed the sin barrier.
[2:07:47] And he got a double. Oh, can I say it?
[2:07:51] He got He got double for his trouble.
[2:07:55] Hallelujah. He got double for his
[2:07:57] trouble. Come, I tell you, man, you're
[2:08:00] going to get double for your trouble.
[2:08:02] Whatever you sacrifice, you're going to
[2:08:04] get double for your trouble. Hallelujah.
[2:08:07] It's so a troublesome life, but you're
[2:08:09] going to get double for your trouble.
[2:08:11] Keep pressing. Keep going. You get
[2:08:14] double for your trouble. Hallelujah. And
[2:08:17] when they saw, listen, man. Oh, I must
[2:08:19] say this one. And when they saw the
[2:08:21] anointing upon him, the schools of the
[2:08:24] prophets say they saw the glory of God
[2:08:27] all over him. Hallelujah. Brother, they
[2:08:31] saw his glory, but they didn't know his
[2:08:34] story.
[2:08:38] Hallelujah.
[2:08:40] They saw his glory, but they didn't know
[2:08:43] his story. They see your glory, but they
[2:08:46] don't know your story. where you come
[2:08:48] from, what you've been through, how
[2:08:51] you've been challenged, how you fell,
[2:08:53] how you got up. They see your glory, but
[2:08:56] they don't know your story, brother.
[2:08:58] They saw Brother Brennham's glory, but
[2:09:01] they didn't know his story. They're
[2:09:02] going to see the bride's glory one of
[2:09:05] these days, but they don't know your
[2:09:07] story, brother. God bless you.
