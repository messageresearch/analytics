[32:15] tape we'd like to share with you on this
[32:17] coming friday with public holiday we're
[32:19] going to have a special tape this coming
[32:22] uh sun friday
[32:24] how many of you do have to answer did
[32:27] your homework
[32:28] homework was to study three kind of
[32:30] believers
[32:31] but by identifying every group there's
[32:33] three kinds
[32:35] the true believer
[32:37] the make-believer and the unbeliever
[32:40] the true so we want to thank buddhism
[32:42] for that
[32:43] i believe
[32:46] it's timely
[32:47] because in this time of lingering and
[32:50] this time if i could use three of stress
[32:52] like a stress point
[32:54] it really defines where people are at
[32:57] and their spirit and their heart and
[32:59] their lives
[33:00] and um it's a person
[33:03] and what is interesting though is
[33:05] everybody under the same thing
[33:07] so it's what's on the inside of you how
[33:10] you're going to survive this thing you
[33:12] can't say you are not more stressed on
[33:14] somebody else everybody under this whole
[33:16] pandemic and your grain mask and social
[33:19] distancing and and all kind of stuff and
[33:21] things like that you know
[33:23] so it's what's inside of you no
[33:26] the believers the true believers
[33:28] believes like the disciples be there
[33:30] they truly believe them
[33:32] he said no he was the word of life and
[33:33] simon totally recognized this and when
[33:36] he recognized it that was that that was
[33:39] what kept his whole because it was
[33:41] revealed to him that he was the living
[33:43] word and that's a genuine believer when
[33:46] the holy spirit not some persuaded by
[33:48] some other person not by some other
[33:51] thing but when the holy spirit has
[33:54] revealed to you the word itself and you
[33:57] see the word made plain vindicated then
[34:00] the spirit of god come and get into that
[34:02] age for the wood out age and make it
[34:04] manifested and the reason and this is
[34:07] where if you study the message this is a
[34:09] big bomb inside of here but isaac
[34:12] a big big bomb is i do believe this from
[34:14] the same message that when the bride is
[34:16] called out and elected
[34:20] and set in the book of life there will
[34:22] come a song from heaven that will take
[34:25] such a baptism of the holy spirit which
[34:27] the preachers don't like to talk about
[34:29] what that will take such a baptism of
[34:31] the holy spirit into that bride
[34:34] i'm not teaching here
[34:36] i know preaching you know that's baptism
[34:38] of the holy spirit
[34:40] into that bride that will take her from
[34:42] the earth in a rapture in grace god
[34:45] promised it
[34:47] promise what when you are called out
[34:50] elected and set in the book of life
[34:53] oh glory to god god set you inside that
[34:55] there god set you inside every devil
[34:57] could move you from his idea
[34:59] which man can move from his either there
[35:01] which elder which deacon which fivefold
[35:03] which whatever gonna move you when god
[35:05] take you and set you in the book of life
[35:08] oh globe your mother can set you there
[35:10] your father can set you there your
[35:11] husband can't set you there your wife
[35:13] can set you there the preacher can't set
[35:15] you there god i have to set you inside
[35:17] of there
[35:19] oh praise the name of the lord
[35:20] hallelujah
[35:22] he said watch sometimes the believers
[35:24] are put to the test not sometimes every
[35:27] time
[35:28] no that's ten percent say email but a
[35:30] punch that's not good enough we talk
[35:31] about true believers now no we don't
[35:33] make believers you know
[35:35] he says sometimes believers are put to
[35:37] the test not sometimes every time and
[35:39] then he gives a scripture you see i have
[35:40] to find the word for it every son that
[35:42] committed god must be chastened tried
[35:46] child trained oh glory to god every son
[35:49] not some not god saving this one and god
[35:52] said in that one every son every is
[35:55] every every true son
[35:57] oh glory to god every believer believer
[35:59] son oh glory to god everyone are you one
[36:02] of them glory to god stop complaining
[36:05] and stop rejoicing because you're
[36:06] conquered worthy oh hallelujah every son
[36:11] that committed god must be chastened
[36:13] tried child trained remember the trials
[36:16] the dusty roads the hunt listen the hot
[36:19] sun of persecution but the loyalty of
[36:21] your heart beats that material till
[36:24] she's ready to go into the mold god's
[36:26] children is made up correctly on his
[36:29] word and they are living examples and
[36:31] the word of god lives through them and
[36:33] the trial come to shake you to put you
[36:36] to the very bottom to see where you will
[36:39] stand oh glory to god the trial comes to
[36:42] make it jumpy jumpy jumpy they try to
[36:44] come to shake you to put you at the
[36:46] bottom to rock you oh glory to god and
[36:49] when the devil see yourself standing
[36:51] haven't done all to stand you're
[36:53] standing here
[36:54] oh glory to god true kind
[36:59] i hear you
[37:01] true kane
[37:05] the other kind saying i wonder why this
[37:07] happened to me i wonder why this
[37:09] happened to me oh god i see that
[37:12] happened she i said that he it happened
[37:14] with me
[37:16] why not
[37:17] i thought you are true kind
[37:19] all right
[37:21] the same thing now hear the part now he
[37:23] will try to tell you
[37:25] satan
[37:26] that these trials and thing is your god
[37:30] trying to put punishment upon you
[37:33] it isn't so
[37:37] 10 say amen
[37:39] i just really know he said it isn't so
[37:42] no sir it is satan doing that and god is
[37:46] permitting it
[37:48] to temper you to make you see
[37:52] if you are tied to this earth
[37:55] by earth cares
[37:57] or whether your treasure is in heaven
[37:59] for whatever your treasure is there you
[38:01] are also your heart
[38:03] oh glory to god so the true believer
[38:05] accepts the word
[38:07] isn't that right the believer don't
[38:09] question the believer believes it
[38:11] regardless of what it sounds like what
[38:13] anybody else has got to say about it how
[38:16] impossible it seems to be the believer
[38:18] just believes it
[38:19] if it's the word it's the word isn't
[38:21] that right
[38:22] so all right we find out they they did
[38:24] all right as long as they get patted in
[38:27] the back which is the uh unbeliever now
[38:29] watch they did all right as long as they
[38:32] get past it on the back and call
[38:33] disciples as long as the everything went
[38:35] fine they were all right but when this
[38:37] prophet that they believed to be a
[38:38] prophet
[38:39] that node that could seal the sick and
[38:42] so forth what did he do when the real
[38:44] truth o praise the name of the lord
[38:48] hallelujah
[38:49] blessed give the lord some praises
[38:52] [Applause]
[38:58] hallelujah praise god
[39:01] thank you jesus thank you jesus
[39:04] hallelujah
[39:10] i never tried to take me away
[39:19] hallelujah watch what did they do when
[39:22] the real truth and the rebuke came
[39:24] contrary to what they believed they
[39:26] couldn't take the word
[39:27] and sometimes walk away the unbeliever
[39:30] he's a hypocrite he acts like that he
[39:32] says they believe but he denies it so as
[39:34] i said they believe a lot but not all
[39:38] they believe what is comfortable to them
[39:40] they believe what they choose to eat
[39:42] it's nice
[39:43] i wonder dear i like that here the
[39:46] feelings are buffet style
[39:49] god tell ezekiel eat the whole roll
[39:55] and that eat the whole role was to
[39:56] produce judgment to israel
[39:59] you know what god tell them we don't
[40:00] want him to find scripture he said
[40:02] you're not going to have strange people
[40:03] with a strange language you know
[40:05] he said you're going to my people
[40:09] my people
[40:11] speak to them
[40:12] but before you speak to them eat the
[40:14] whole rule
[40:16] a guy said to me that one time my
[40:18] minister said i don't care mr brown how
[40:20] many people you could produce that you
[40:21] said was healed i
[40:23] wouldn't believe it
[40:25] i said certainly not you can't believe
[40:27] it you're an unbeliever
[40:29] it wasn't for you it's only for
[40:30] believers
[40:32] so they walk right out of the word they
[40:33] won't even stay the unbelievers would
[40:35] you stay they take a rebuke but the
[40:37] third class we are speaking about is a
[40:39] big believer that's the boy the make
[40:41] believer that's judas
[40:43] so peter the rest of the apostles
[40:44] believers
[40:46] 70 that walk away unbelievers but judas
[40:49] that's the kind that holds on until they
[40:51] could find something a fault
[40:57] they say long enough to find fault
[40:59] that's the judas
[41:00] oh my but the real believer don't
[41:02] question anything is written once it's
[41:04] written in the word and they believe it
[41:06] they just go on that's it but always it
[41:09] is written oh we have to find where it
[41:11] is written and judas what was he
[41:13] agreeing with the word till the one
[41:15] little thing he's trying to find a place
[41:17] where he get a weakness
[41:19] oh praise god so let's all stand i want
[41:21] to go to the revelation chapter 10 we're
[41:23] under time constraint so we see what
[41:24] we'll do

[42:18] he said his right foot upon the sea and
[42:20] his left foot on the earth
[42:22] and cry with a low voice is when a land
[42:24] wrought and when he had cried seven
[42:25] thunders i'll say their voices
[42:27] when the seven thunder the voices i was
[42:29] about to write
[42:30] i heard a voice from heaven saying unto
[42:32] me sealed up those those things which is
[42:34] seven thunders uttered and write them

[42:42] and swear by him that lived forever and
[42:44] ever who created heaven and the things
[42:46] that therein are and the earth and the
[42:48] things that there are now and the sea
[42:49] and the things that there are that there
[42:51] should be time no longer
[42:52] but in the days of the voice
[42:55] of the seventh angel specific
[42:58] when he shall begin the song the mystery
[43:00] of god should be finished
[43:01] as he had declared to his siblings the
[43:03] prophets and the voice which i heard
[43:05] from heaven spake unto me again and said
[43:07] go and take the little book which is
[43:09] open at the hand of the angel
[43:11] which standed upon the scene upon the
[43:12] earth and i went unto the angel and said
[43:15] unto him give me the little book
[43:17] he said unto me take it eat it up it
[43:19] shall make thy belly bitter but it shall
[43:21] be my mouth sweet as honey

[43:24] angel's hand ate it up was in my mouth
[43:27] with honey and as soon as eaten it my
[43:30] belly was bitter he said unto me thou

[43:58] revelation 10
[44:01] of a subject christ
[44:03] his coming
[44:05] his messenger
[44:07] his brain
[44:09] and i have an inspiration the spirit of
[44:11] prophecy
[44:13] the testimony of jesus
[44:15] so that's the title
[44:17] revelation 10.
[44:19] and i believe this scripture holds so
[44:21] much in it
[44:23] it's one of the greatest
[44:26] books
[44:28] in the book of revelation
[44:30] this scripture revelation chapter 10.
[44:33] it is more relevant
[44:35] more important
[44:37] and more potent than you could ever
[44:38] think or imagine
[44:40] because the scripture connects to
[44:42] genesis
[44:43] what happened to the fall
[44:45] this scripture connects to his coming
[44:48] this scripture connects to the bride
[44:50] the true believer
[44:52] this concept that connected the
[44:54] messenger that is to the bride
[44:56] this can message connects to how we get
[44:58] the book from heaven to the earth
[45:01] hallelujah this revelation 10 is one of
[45:04] the most important scripture
[45:07] in this generation
[45:09] in this time
[45:10] this gen this book called revelation
[45:12] chapter 10
[45:14] o glory to god
[45:16] verse 1 give the description of who is
[45:18] coming down
[45:19] a mighty angel
[45:21] it describes he always crawl with a
[45:23] clown and a rainbow over his head
[45:25] it described his face with like the sun
[45:28] and his feet as pillars of fire we know
[45:30] who that angel is
[45:32] that angel is christ the mighty angel
[45:35] or chief messenger
[45:37] oh glory to god coming down from heaven
[45:40] here coming from some seminary he is
[45:43] coming from some bible school that's the
[45:45] lord himself
[45:47] oh glory to god hallelujah
[45:50] all glory to god that revelation can be
[45:52] talking about
[45:53] the lord himself
[45:55] descending from heaven with a shout
[45:58] and the president of america don't know
[46:01] and the president of russia don't know
[46:03] and the prime minister of trinidad don't
[46:05] know
[46:06] but the lord himself
[46:08] be called as a bribery earth
[46:11] oh glory that the thunders have to call
[46:14] and elect
[46:15] and set in the book of life
[46:18] oh give the lord some praises
[46:20] glory to god
[46:22] it describes what a wrong him it
[46:24] describes his face
[46:26] it describes his feet
[46:28] but we want to look at what is in his
[46:30] hand
[46:31] oh help me today help me today we want
[46:33] to want to look at what is in his hand
[46:35] oh it's not a ghost
[46:37] it's a man it's an angel
[46:40] oh glory to god and something in his in
[46:42] his hand
[46:43] and the bible described it as a little
[46:45] book open
[46:46] this book that was once sealed
[46:49] and as you go back to genesis
[46:51] when man fell
[46:53] adam lost the book
[46:54] and the book went back in the hands
[46:57] of the original owner
[46:59] hallelujah when that book was opened
[47:02] that was taking place in heaven
[47:04] but something has to bring it on
[47:06] from heaven down to the earth
[47:09] get the lord i shout this morning
[47:12] hallelujah
[47:14] hallelujah
[47:16] hallelujah
[47:18] glory to god
[47:20] hallelujah hallelujah
[47:22] remember cece
[47:23] adam
[47:25] who had the book
[47:27] who had to call the names
[47:29] because the loins of adam
[47:31] hallelujah was supposed to unfold the
[47:33] rest of the sons of god
[47:35] adam wants to speak them
[47:37] and they were supposed to comfort
[47:39] in their time and season
[47:42] from the book that was in adam but when
[47:44] adam fell
[47:46] he lost the book
[47:47] so he couldn't call the names and that's
[47:50] why when jesus came the first gospel was
[47:53] you must be born again
[47:55] of the word and of the spirit
[47:58] proven we're going back
[47:59] to how we're supposed to be born
[48:02] by the word of god or give the lord a
[48:05] shout

[48:10] word and spirit
[48:15] this book
[48:17] sealed
[48:18] shut up
[48:20] hidden
[48:21] because the devil's hands of unbelief
[48:23] couldn't hold
[48:25] i like it this little book
[48:27] and this book is a book of redemption
[48:30] this book is a book of names
[48:32] every elect is in that book
[48:34] every true believer is in that book
[48:37] you could find their name in that book
[48:39] what glory the god and that book had to
[48:41] come to you
[48:43] now remember the bible is a closed book
[48:45] it's a sealed book
[48:47] oh glory is not the open book it's a
[48:49] sealed book until the lamb
[48:52] that's why jesus came
[48:53] he came to pay the price
[48:55] to get the book
[48:57] not just the diane calvary the book the
[49:00] book the book oh give the lord a shout
[49:04] because in that book had your name
[49:06] and you have to connect with your name
[49:08] in order to get your inheritance
[49:11] you can't give inheritance to nobody
[49:14] nobody is not your name oh glory to god

[53:37] when the seven thunders are dotted
[53:39] voices i was about to write
[53:41] i heard a voice of heaven saying seal up
[53:43] those things
[53:45] which the seven thunders uttered
[53:47] and write them not
[53:48] and the angel
[53:50] that i saw
[53:51] stand upon the scene upon the earth
[53:54] lifted up his hands to heaven and swear
[53:57] by him that live forever and ever who
[53:59] created heaven and things that darren
[54:01] are and the earth that thing that there
[54:03] are
[54:03] and the sea and the things that are
[54:05] enough that there should be time no
[54:06] longer or time is over or time is up or
[54:10] the ending of time or time is finished
[54:13] or the ending of the seventh seal or
[54:15] glory to god hallelujah or the occlusion
[54:18] of the gentile dispensation
[54:21] [Applause]
[54:21] [Music]
[54:23] time
[54:26] no more time
[54:30] [Music]
[54:32] [Applause]
[54:35] [Music]
[54:39] in babylon
[54:40] in time of daniel when the writing came
[54:42] on the wall
[54:43] and they called for the interpreters
[54:44] because the king's knee was knocking
[54:47] he saw a hand
[54:48] begin to write on the wall
[54:51] are tongues language
[54:53] and when they get the interpretation
[54:55] you are found in the balance
[54:58] and found wanting
[55:00] time up
[55:01] your kingdom is taken
[55:03] and that means a person was right at the
[55:05] gate
[55:06] oh glory time up
[55:10] one is this time will be up
[55:12] no more time
[55:14] because that little dog was really
[55:15] closed
[55:18] poke open
[55:19] but one day that same book that is open
[55:21] could be close
[55:22] not another name
[55:24] and if you recognize your name on that
[55:26] book
[55:26] if you conscious in a way your name is
[55:28] in that book notice i'm not talking
[55:30] about your sin and your feelings your
[55:31] past your fault coming i'm not talking
[55:32] about that enough are specifically
[55:34] talking about your name on the book not
[55:36] what you do did or will do
[55:39] oh give the lord some praises people
[55:41] i'm just talking specifically about your
[55:43] name on that book
[55:45] if your name is on that book there was a
[55:47] behavior that connected with your name
[55:48] on that book
[55:49] let's continue an angels swore time
[55:51] shall be no more
[55:53] time no longer
[55:55] what in the days of the voice yeah we
[55:56] gain now
[55:57] how are we connecting to our man
[55:59] the days are the word
[56:01] so this angel has to connect with
[56:02] somebody in the earth
[56:03] the days of the voice and it's more
[56:05] specific of of the seventh angel
[56:09] or seventh messenger
[56:12] when he shall begin to sing say the
[56:14] mighty angel come down you have to give
[56:15] it to somebody he can hold a book for
[56:17] himself you have to use somebody on the
[56:19] earth so this bible identified that the
[56:22] seventh messenger or the seven angel
[56:24] gets that book
[56:26] and then he could speak from that book
[56:28] and we know that seven messengers come
[56:29] to the seventh age
[56:31] oh glory to god not seven a belong to a
[56:33] prophet called malak of malachi for
[56:35] behold i sent you elijah the prophet so
[56:37] god put a prophet to catch the
[56:38] revelation because the word comes in the
[56:40] prophet the book had to come to the
[56:42] prophet we can just get the book just
[56:44] like that
[56:45] oh the lamb himself had to take the book
[56:46] remember no man was found worthy no man
[56:49] involved in that you know the lamb took
[56:51] the pork
[56:52] so only the lamb could give it to a man
[56:55] or give the lord a shout and the man has
[56:57] to be scripturally identified like any
[56:59] man could claim he get the book you have
[57:01] to set up and shut up until he finds
[57:02] scripture for that man and that
[57:04] scripture is a seventh angel messenger
[57:06] and we know that is william murray and
[57:08] bradham there's not another man on earth
[57:10] that fit that role there's not a matter
[57:12] here that fit that spot if it's not
[57:14] william brandon then who it is that's
[57:16] the devil job this is not william
[57:17] branham but who it is
[57:20] is donald trump who it is
[57:22] you can't find another man
[57:24] oh you could look high and low
[57:26] oh glory to god but there's one man fit
[57:29] that
[57:30] and who is the bride
[57:31] come on now give the lord a shout
[57:33] [Applause]

[1:01:46] and he just began to testify
[1:01:48] of what god was doing all of a sudden
[1:01:51] why peter was speaking those words the
[1:01:54] holy ghost
[1:01:55] somebody said holy ghost the holy ghost
[1:01:57] fell somebody said fell
[1:02:00] they don't like to talk about falling

[1:02:24] glory to god be coming from revelation
[1:02:26] 10.
[1:02:34] phil
[1:02:36] these guys never went to church before
[1:02:39] these guys never even got baptized in
[1:02:41] jesus name
[1:02:42] but the holy ghost
[1:02:44] oh glory to god you know why
[1:02:46] they were in names was in the book
[1:02:48] and peter called your name
[1:02:53] glory to god
[1:02:55] he spoke the word the word spoke to them
[1:02:58] and the quickness power
[1:03:02] them
[1:03:02] [Music]
[1:03:07] and after they got the holy ghost there
[1:03:08] and say i don't need to get baptized in
[1:03:09] jesus name no they're going to get
[1:03:10] baptized because the holy ghost follows
[1:03:12] the words
[1:03:13] is that right
[1:03:15] when the angels give me the book
[1:03:17] he said not what watch i took the book
[1:03:19] out of the angel's hand ate it up it was
[1:03:21] my my mouth sweetest honey and as soon
[1:03:24] as i had eaten it up my belly was bitter
[1:03:26] and he said unto me
[1:03:28] though must prophesy again
[1:03:31] before many peoples
[1:03:32] and nations
[1:03:34] and tongues and kings
[1:03:36] as we know the testimony of jesus
[1:03:38] is the spirit of prophecy
[1:03:40] so the true fightful ministry
[1:03:43] would go to the angel
[1:03:45] take the book
[1:03:46] eat the book
[1:03:47] and if you eat the book you could only
[1:03:49] prophesy from the book
[1:03:53] you can't have your own prophecy
[1:03:55] because the prophecy have to come from
[1:03:57] the book
[1:03:58] the book that you have eaten
[1:04:00] it has to be the same prophecy that is
[1:04:02] why the key to all what we are saying is
[1:04:05] the spirit
[1:04:06] the prophet
[1:04:08] and the bride
[1:04:09] will say the same thing
[1:04:11] and what they say
[1:04:13] will already be said in the word
[1:04:15] so we are prophesying the same thing
[1:04:18] and the amplified it said though must
[1:04:20] prophesy is to bring a fresh prophecy
[1:04:24] of the same prophecy
[1:04:26] oh give the lord some shouts
[1:04:29] do you see it tonight
[1:04:31] do you see where you fit in
[1:04:33] no
[1:04:34] hidden in there
[1:04:36] is the church member
[1:04:40] the bible has called it out but it is
[1:04:43] dear
[1:04:44] because the church member
[1:04:46] or by this way the fleshly five-fold
[1:04:49] they're not going to know angels to take
[1:04:50] no book
[1:04:54] chewing it in their mouth and spitting
[1:04:55] it out
[1:04:56] taking what they want
[1:04:57] they have no bitter belly for them
[1:05:00] them going the easy route
[1:05:02] hallelujah please everybody i'll disrupt
[1:05:06] see
[1:05:07] so what happens when people don't take
[1:05:08] the book
[1:05:12] because i could show you in the word
[1:05:13] that you have to accept it in its
[1:05:15] fullness
[1:05:16] of its revelation and vindication you
[1:05:19] can't take what you want
[1:05:22] you have to take all of it
[1:05:26] to show you a true believer
[1:05:29] you go to a pentecostal you believe the
[1:05:31] bible yes sir i believe bible you say
[1:05:33] well what is malakai for behold he said
[1:05:35] like nah
[1:05:37] they can't take that
[1:05:39] try them
[1:05:40] your body bible yeah i believe i believe
[1:05:41] the scriptures
[1:05:42] i believe
[1:05:43] yeah but let's go to the word malachi 4
[1:05:45] behold i sent you elijah is that
[1:05:48] past or that is to come
[1:05:51] i do go dear.
[1:05:54] you don't want to go there because you
[1:05:55] love the pentagon church
[1:05:57] but if you're honest you have to say
[1:05:59] that is the word
[1:06:01] behold i is not man speaking will send
[1:06:03] you
[1:06:04] elijah the prophet before
[1:06:06] the great and terrible they have the
[1:06:08] lord
[1:06:09] so we have to look for elijah either he
[1:06:10] come when he coming
[1:06:14] because before the lord come elias must
[1:06:16] first come
[1:06:20] oh glory to god you have to be a
[1:06:21] forerunner
[1:06:22] for the messiah to come is that right
[1:06:24] oh my praise the lord you love him this
[1:06:26] morning
[1:06:30] isaiah 29. i want to be from the
[1:06:33] amplified for his name
[1:06:34] stop and wonder
[1:06:36] at this prophecy if you choose
[1:06:39] whether you understand it or not
[1:06:41] soon you will witness the actual event
[1:06:45] and be confounded reluctantly
[1:06:48] blind yourself now if you choose
[1:06:51] take pleasure
[1:06:52] and then be blinded at the actual
[1:06:54] occurrence
[1:06:56] they are drunk but not with wine
[1:06:59] the stagger but not from strong drink
[1:07:01] but from spiritual stupor
[1:07:04] for the lord had poured out on you the
[1:07:06] spirit of deep sleep
[1:07:08] and he has closed your eyes the prophets
[1:07:11] and your heads and the sears he has
[1:07:14] covered and muffled
[1:07:16] and the vision of all this has become
[1:07:17] for you like the words of a book that is
[1:07:19] sealed
[1:07:21] when men give it to one who can can read
[1:07:23] saying read this he said i pray you he
[1:07:25] said i can't afford a seal
[1:07:27] when the book is given to him who is not
[1:07:29] learning he said read this i pray you he
[1:07:31] said i cannot read
[1:07:33] and the lord said
[1:07:35] for as much as this people draw near me
[1:07:38] with their mouth
[1:07:40] and honor me with their lips
[1:07:42] but remove their hearts and minds far
[1:07:45] from me
[1:07:46] and their fear and reverence for me are
[1:07:49] a commandment of men that is learned by
[1:07:51] repetition without any thought as to the
[1:07:54] meaning therefore behold
[1:07:57] i will again do marvelous things with
[1:07:59] these people
[1:08:01] marvelous and astonishing things and the
[1:08:04] wisdom of the wise men will perish
[1:08:07] and the understanding of the discernment
[1:08:09] will vanish or be hidden walk to those
[1:08:11] who seek to hide deep from the lord the
[1:08:14] council whose deeds are in the dark who
[1:08:17] says who sees us
[1:08:20] who knows us
[1:08:21] oh my hallelujah oh glory to god they'll
[1:08:25] be exposed
[1:08:26] hallelujah because the book is not
[1:08:28] sealed
[1:08:29] the book is unsealed
[1:08:31] so this revelation 10
[1:08:33] the place where you'll see your name
[1:08:35] because the book come down in version 10
[1:08:37] to show you your name
[1:08:39] revelation 10
[1:08:41] 8-11
[1:08:43] a prophecy to go after the prophet
[1:08:46] that's why he said almost prophesy again
[1:08:48] because in revelation 10 7 is the
[1:08:51] prophet here comes the bride
[1:08:53] with the same prophecy
[1:08:55] to prophesy again
[1:08:58] why because the vision is true
[1:09:00] but the time is long
[1:09:02] or give the lord some praises you hear
[1:09:04] what i said the vision is true but the
[1:09:08] time is long
[1:09:09] so we can't manufacture anything we have
[1:09:12] to wait
[1:09:13] until the real holy spirit
[1:09:16] comes into the church
[1:09:18] to manifest his word oh give the lord a
[1:09:21] shout
[1:09:22] eve couldn't wait for the revelation of
[1:09:25] how to multiply and the devil slipping
[1:09:27] because he didn't want to wait you
[1:09:29] better learn to wait
[1:09:30] and you ever scripted his wheat upon the
[1:09:32] lord shoving you their strength

[1:19:47] enter into this great place now
[1:19:49] for joshua they violated the people the
[1:19:51] inheritance that god has left them
[1:19:53] what we've seen happen should put every
[1:19:55] soul in action it should make a church
[1:19:57] that will make a revival in phoenix and
[1:19:59] people fighting revival they won't know
[1:20:01] ever at all because revival will put man
[1:20:03] out of business
[1:20:05] that is why they fight in revival it
[1:20:07] will put their theories and theology and
[1:20:10] forward teaching revelation messages out
[1:20:12] of business because revival is a move of
[1:20:15] god in power
[1:20:16] god does take man out of the way and the
[1:20:18] spirit just sweeping back and forth and
[1:20:20] woman and the sisters can make up their
[1:20:22] dishes wash the dishes and they can't
[1:20:23] make up their bed because revival dead
[1:20:25] only crying sobbing praying oh god
[1:20:28] they're washing their wheels and they
[1:20:29] don't drop it down because of glory holy
[1:20:31] ghost it's all over me and it's keeping
[1:20:33] me alive it's the holy ghost on fire
[1:20:35] it's the holy ghost and power it's
[1:20:37] keeping me alive it's the old time holy
[1:20:39] spirit the devil won't go near it that's
[1:20:41] the reason that people fear it but it's
[1:20:43] good enough for me there's a holy ghost

[1:24:07] be part of it
[1:24:12] ah may be seated
[1:24:28] spiritual you know why that's exactly
[1:24:30] what god did he took his covenant seed
[1:24:33] which the real seed was the promised one
[1:24:35] true faith to comfort out of isaac
[1:24:37] comfort christ christ was god's covenant
[1:24:39] and what he did he took him to calvary
[1:24:41] just like abraham did his own son a few
[1:24:43] days afterwards a few days years
[1:24:44] afterwards after he was born what did he
[1:24:46] do he took him on calvary here we go he
[1:24:49] tore him apart
[1:24:50] he raised his body up on easter morning
[1:24:53] set him on the right hand of his throne
[1:24:55] but here we go there's the part now the
[1:24:58] spirit that was in him
[1:25:00] he sent back down to the church
[1:25:03] so the church here we go when this
[1:25:05] covenant is brought into its full
[1:25:08] strength hear the words
[1:25:11] when this covenant
[1:25:13] is brought into its full strength
[1:25:16] when the covenant is confirmed
[1:25:20] with god
[1:25:21] the church the people that goes into the
[1:25:24] body here to be his bride
[1:25:26] specific
[1:25:27] will be exactly the same spirit that was
[1:25:31] upon christ
[1:25:33] doing the same things
[1:25:35] the same ministry the same power it will
[1:25:39] come together
[1:25:40] word by word
[1:25:43] confirming the covenant
[1:25:46] what did the mighty angel come down with
[1:25:48] a rainbow over his head
[1:25:50] he commented confirmed the covenant
[1:25:53] with the bride of jesus christ
[1:25:55] by releasing to you his same life
[1:25:57] his same spirit
[1:25:59] his same ministry his ministry was not
[1:26:02] teaching preaching ministry only
[1:26:05] i have to get it into you you know
[1:26:07] because the people have been there long
[1:26:08] so long with this intellectual teaching
[1:26:10] thing in this message that they have no
[1:26:12] expectation whatsoever for power for
[1:26:15] outpouring for their spirit for miracles
[1:26:18] for signs for wonders for tongues for
[1:26:20] speaking in tongues prophecy they have
[1:26:22] no expertise for that at all all they
[1:26:23] want is more man more man more man more
[1:26:26] man we say no man at all we show man the
[1:26:28] exit we want the mighty angel of

[1:26:56] i really pray that god take the country
[1:26:58] into normalcy
[1:27:00] because we
[1:27:01] we want to see things back to normal
[1:27:04] do everybody have their own ideas and
[1:27:05] things and i don't want a good deal
[1:27:07] but god have mercy
[1:27:09] we will do all that we can do when we
[1:27:11] can do it
[1:27:12] we're going to keep punching and
[1:27:13] punching
[1:27:14] as i said already the devil can't get
[1:27:16] stronger
[1:27:17] but you can
[1:27:19] satan has said satan
[1:27:23] but he don't know who you are
[1:27:25] hallelujah okay so watch
[1:27:27] so you're talking about the seven
[1:27:28] messenger i believe that the seven angel
[1:27:31] version 10
[1:27:32] is the seventh which is messenger of
[1:27:34] revelation 3 14.
[1:27:36] he said takes the book and of the seals
[1:27:38] and breaks them and shows the seven
[1:27:40] angel for this alone the mysteries of
[1:27:44] god is the ministry of the seventh angel
[1:27:48] oh my in the first seal he says no
[1:27:51] malachi 4 said so others version 10 7
[1:27:53] jesus have predicted it at the end of
[1:27:56] the seventh angels message all the
[1:27:58] mysteries of god will be known we are
[1:28:00] the end time the opening of the seventh
[1:28:03] seal
[1:28:04] oh hallelujah so hear what he said
[1:28:06] before that he said now watch after all
[1:28:09] he has revealed all the six seals he
[1:28:10] don't see nothing about the seventh seal
[1:28:12] and and the end time seal
[1:28:15] when it starts
[1:28:17] will be a secret
[1:28:18] only when it starts
[1:28:20] that's why you say at the finishing of
[1:28:21] the seventh seal we're supposed to be
[1:28:23] all the way up there now
[1:28:24] to know who god is
[1:28:26] how he lived his being we supposed to
[1:28:28] know all about him by that time in other
[1:28:30] words we're supposed to be knowing who
[1:28:32] we are who god is and who the devil is
[1:28:34] at definition of the seven seal
[1:28:36] hallelujah can't be confused oh god in
[1:28:38] this world right if they're right you
[1:28:39] can't be dear that will slap you up so
[1:28:42] your head will go into the right track
[1:28:43] right right right right right

[1:29:37] so when they talk about that he said
[1:29:38] that for me you know this praying to my
[1:29:40] god that they're defending all together
[1:29:41] and all my god is able to deliver

[1:33:51] church
[1:33:52] through labor pains
[1:33:54] and they get tremendous sometimes
[1:33:56] when a church like hits sometime like
[1:33:58] this church here is groaning under
[1:34:01] the persecution of the outside world the
[1:34:03] outside world is message world
[1:34:05] believing in the lord jesus
[1:34:07] that the promise that's the promise
[1:34:10] of the holy ghost
[1:34:11] is just as real
[1:34:13] every one of you here should know the
[1:34:15] school by heart i preach this ten
[1:34:17] thousand times
[1:34:19] i could say the whole thing by her and i
[1:34:21] said read it but you supposed to do with
[1:34:23] my heart
[1:34:24] and anybody challenge it just say this
[1:34:25] they say this one here and we'll shut
[1:34:27] them up
[1:34:28] tell them we are the church here that is
[1:34:29] growing
[1:34:31] presidential people like you
[1:34:32] believing in lord jesus that the promise
[1:34:34] of the holy ghost that you don't believe
[1:34:36] in is just as real to us
[1:34:38] and if you don't want it that's okay i
[1:34:40] love that because i take it all that you
[1:34:41] don't want i take it extra too you have
[1:34:44] any extra idea taken that too oh glory
[1:34:46] to god watch how they grown and cry
[1:34:49] under labor pains
[1:34:50] but when they are born
[1:34:52] and positionally born
[1:34:54] into the kingdom of god
[1:34:56] then the holy ghost are set in the
[1:34:58] church some apostles some prophets some
[1:35:00] teachers some pastors some evangelists
[1:35:03] danny given to dear speaking with
[1:35:04] tongues interpretation wisdom gifts of
[1:35:07] healing all kinds of things
[1:35:09] glory to god
[1:35:12] let me know call the foolish version
[1:35:13] quickly and we were close
[1:35:15] brother branham
[1:35:17] he says if you can't accept the whole
[1:35:19] word of god
[1:35:20] the way it is written
[1:35:22] you won't do it dear
[1:35:24] he said that only trades your dwelling
[1:35:26] please it doesn't change you if you're
[1:35:28] doubting here you've got doubt across
[1:35:29] there so god the hundred dollars there
[1:35:31] so take it down here and go stay down
[1:35:32] here you're not gonna make it over there
[1:35:35] you have got to accept it in its
[1:35:36] fullness
[1:35:38] in the power of its vindication
[1:35:40] and the revelation of what it is then
[1:35:43] you become part of it
[1:35:44] you're talking about part of the bride
[1:35:46] you have to accept his fullness oh it's
[1:35:48] revelation and vindication
[1:35:50] question think oh wrap up this year if
[1:35:52] the church is saved even though she does
[1:35:54] not go into the rapture and i believe
[1:35:56] you're taught she must go to the
[1:35:58] tribulation for purifying but what about
[1:36:00] these that are dead how will they be
[1:36:01] referred
[1:36:02] is it those
[1:36:03] that in the bride need no preventation
[1:36:07] he says
[1:36:08] now in this rapture in time
[1:36:11] there will have to come a time
[1:36:14] that this bride
[1:36:15] that reject the head part of the bride
[1:36:17] he's talking about the church there so i
[1:36:19] say it the way it's supposed to be
[1:36:20] that the church which reject the head
[1:36:23] part of the bride will have to suffer
[1:36:24] for her rejection
[1:36:26] no he's not talking about pentecost
[1:36:28] understanding he's talked about message
[1:36:29] folks
[1:36:30] because the gospel wasn't made plain to
[1:36:32] them back there like it's made plain to
[1:36:34] you today you see it so plain
[1:36:37] you have done had all those years and
[1:36:39] examples the seals is open the church is
[1:36:42] laid out everything like that it's just
[1:36:44] plain you can't miss it then if you
[1:36:46] fully reject it there's only one thing
[1:36:48] to do suffer for it
[1:36:50] so even if you're suffering his weight
[1:36:51] mask
[1:36:53] and social distance
[1:36:55] diagnosing you know suffering there to
[1:36:57] come it had three and a half years of
[1:36:59] that
[1:37:00] not not two years you know
[1:37:02] three and a half
[1:37:04] hallelujah
[1:37:06] oh my
[1:37:08] my god so bad i'm talking about they
[1:37:10] can't wait for the real holy spirit to
[1:37:12] take the church in position they're
[1:37:13] going to play something they got to
[1:37:14] manufacture something work up something
[1:37:16] watch hear this part
[1:37:18] christ bride done the same what's the
[1:37:20] matter can't wait they can't wait they
[1:37:23] have to manufacture something they can't
[1:37:26] wait
[1:37:27] for the holy spirit to come in and get
[1:37:29] into the church if it had stayed the way
[1:37:31] it was back under 100 years or 50 years
[1:37:34] ago when pentecost first started out in
[1:37:36] this latter day when the world began to
[1:37:38] be preached if it had stayed like that
[1:37:40] she probably wouldn't have over 50
[1:37:42] members today that's right but they
[1:37:44] would be blood washed they had the power
[1:37:46] of god in them the world will be shaken
[1:37:49] under a tremendous impact of word flesh
[1:37:53] being spoken word
[1:37:54] by word oh my i am done today could we
