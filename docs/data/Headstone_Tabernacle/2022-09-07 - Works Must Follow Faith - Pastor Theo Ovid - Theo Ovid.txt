we'll be standing talking and love spirit will enter to the building and all the evil will be taken out they call the evil outlaw jesus make us more like you tonight or we thank you for salvation but we thank you for saving us and electing us and predestinating us just agree slow it's the grace this morning o blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah [Music] me [Music] praise the lord we thank god for his grace to be here tonight god bless you a little bit of your bibles i'd like you to enter two portions of scripture james 2 verse 26 and galatians 5 1 verse 2 6 james 2 26 and galatians 5 through 6. we read from james two for as the body without the spirit is dead so faith without works is that also he's actually saying that's a dead fate and from galatians chapter five and six is therefore in jesus christ neither circumcision a village anything nor uncircumcision but faith which work it by love let's borrow heads heavenly father we thank you for the holy scriptures and lord i pray that you would breed upon it lord breathe life lord we are mortals and our words is nothing lord but your word is everything and if you can only speak a word to us tonight we'll be so grateful father we are looking to you and we are dependent upon you take me out of the way and may your spirit speak expressly to your elect people here tonight those that are connected those that will hear the tape may have presence come upon them all in jesus might ask it amen on the name god bless you may be seated praise god welcome thank you for being out here tonight go praise the name of the lord hallelujah our title works must follow faith that's my title tonight and have an inspiration faith which worketh by love or praise the name of the lord and um the scripture in um oh this is let me see since jes this is james 21st first but i was reading the second chapter was not abram or father justified by works when he had offered isaac his son upon the altar see thou how fate wrote with works and by works feet was made perfect and the scripture was fulfilled which said abraham believed god it was imputed under him for righteousness and he was called a friend of god and read that last scripture again abraham believed god and it was imputed unto him what was imputed his belief in god as righteousness in other words god counted his faith as righteousness his faith made him righteous that's how god saw it and then james and then paul in romans says what shall we see in that abram or father's pertaining to the flesh has found for if amen was justified by works he had way after glory but not before god but what saith the scripture abraham believed god and it was accounted unto him for righteousness this is righteousness without works god conked his faith his to his feet in god and to him that worketh his reward not reckon of grace but of debt now paul here obama's breaking it down is referring to what god sees in abraham and james he's talking about now how james justifying by works he said no and he brought him forth abroad and said look now towards heaven and tell the stars if they'll be able to number them he said so shall thy seed be and he believed in the lord abraham and he counted it for righteousness now the two men we are talking on feet paul justified abraham by what god saw in abraham but james justified abraham by what man saw in abraham so paul said he's justified by faith and james says he's justified by his works praise the name of the lord now let's go let's go but about now when a man has become a son if he's going to approach his father he just walks up to the father and said father i come to visit you and see you about something that's his approach but now to the stranger there's another approach and there's an approach to god for many different things now if i was going to my father and my father was living and i wanted to approach him for a financial matter it would be a little different from another kind of approach i want to tell him how much i thought of him and so forth it's the approach you have to use to meet god now when man's sin back in the beginning the gardener eden he separated himself and severed himself from all approach to god his very lifeline he was separated from his maker with no way at all of ever seeing him again because his sin his unbelief in trusting god had separated him and that word i want to emphasize trust in god or depending on god because the problem is when we get independent of god because god wants us to depend on him and trust him okay now okay and it separated him now that's the only sin there is is your sin of unbelief unbelief is your sin and the only reason today that we are not where we should be is because of our unbelief and it's because the miracles and things isn't in the church as they should be is because of unbelief separating us and because that poor man out there is sinning and murder and stuff in our world today and all kind of disastrous things happen is because of unbelief in god that's all now if we believe there are just two things you either believe or believe not either one if you do believe then the works of righteousness follow a believer if you do not believe the works on of unrighteousness follows the only thing lying stealing theft and thought is attributes of unbelief and long-suffering patience goodness mercies and so forth are attributes of belief in god or faith in god so when man was cut off with no way of approach his only lifeline everything was cut off he was left darkly hopelessly without any way that protest maker and when god come down hunting for the man i want you to notice this it always god hunting the man not man hunting for god do you ever think of that that no man at any time any age that ever desire to serve god never have been his nature is against it he might have some kind of intellectual thoughts he thinks that he does believe god but he actually really believes god he becomes converted and a new creature as soon as believes god he maybe intellectually believe in god but when he believes from his heart aha so he's talking about believing from your heart now when he believes on his heart then he is convicted and becomes a member of the body of christ when he's converted from his heart not from his intellect not because he's the writing you know the best thing to do no no no when you're converted from the heart then it's on the inside oh praise the name of the lord now i believe we don't have desperation is because of lack of love the love of god and i think that the love of god causes desperation hallelujah now we have to believe this just as the word coming out this doesn't need no interpretation he said i believe that the love of god causes desperation if god is in you the talking inside of you and you see the condition of the times that people waging in sin the way they are it throw you into desperation i believe it will now the word plainly states if you wanted galatians 5 6 faith work it by love now faith work it by love and the only way that you can have faith is to have love first because after all faith is love's incentive praise god fate it's an incentive to love if you don't have love you can't have faith how can you have faith in your wife if you know the lover pray and that's his filio how about agape to god so how can it be if you don't love god so all this faith for translation grace and and faith to leave here faith that worked by love not politics not not argument fear that booked by love if you said to your if you said you love your wife and never tell her about it never sit down and make love to her and express it to her and kiss her and hug her and tell her she's the best cook in the country all the things that you know how pretty she is how much you love her if you don't do that she will never know it and that is the way if you do love her you express it and that's the way we do to god when we love him we tell him about it we sit down and we adore him and worship him love drives us to that oh praise the name of the lord so when you see somebody praise god they can't worship they have dead and the grace of god save you and you can't say nothing and they can't say hallelujah glory praise god you know something is wrong somewhere the question how many love is towards god praise god they have nothing to do something for you yet he doesn't have to do something for you to love him praise god he loves you he he first love you praise god you just trying to love him back oh praise the name of the lord amen all right praise god when david fell in sin david you know david take it easy take our next man wife and everything else and old prophet bald-headed fellow stomping old natan out of the wilderness sat down and said david how's everything going david said fine fine what prophet of god lived there hallelujah he thought everything was fine he thought he could hide it but you can't hide from god he knows what you're thinking right now he knows your thoughts for he is god that holy spirit that's in the building this morning knows your thoughts who you are where you come from what you have done for jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever god had revealed it to that prophet he said david to the prophet began to tell a story david there was a rich man lived on the side of the road he had a whole lot of sheep he was very rich a man lived on this side of the road was poor he had one lamb he treated it like a daughter he feed it out of the same spoon he eat with he slept with the lamb everything it was just like a daughter to him and one day a visitor came instead of the rich man taking one of his own sheep and making a feast for the visitor well instead he went over and took the poor man's lamb and by force took the man's lamb slayed it amid her feasts that was david's passions he had 500 wives and when he seen uriah's wife instead of taking one of his 500 wives to or satisfy his passions he went and took this other man's wife then kill uriah then she become a mother david didn't know what he was doing why david was ready to pronounce judgment now watch this david was ready to pronounce judgment that's the way we are we are always we can always judge the other fellow but when it comes to us that's the problem easy to judge this one that one people matter this one that one that one did not matter themselves judging yourself but when it comes to the other oh my that's different david said that man will pay for his life that come out of the david's mouth right the old prophet demi is narrowed down he said david surely you will not die now if god take david at his word he had to die but god's grace through the prophet told david surely you will not die but the sword will not leave your house till it's totally pulled your heart for you at that rich man it was different then wasn't it oh let's go what save david when his own judgment said that man will die he will pay to the utmost he will pay for it for his life and the prophet said surely barbara says greece you will not die you will not die david greece has saved you it was grace to david that saved him if it hadn't been for greece where would we all be is that right tonight if it wasn't for the grace of god where would we all be let's continue sovereign grace is from a sovereign one serving grace is from a sovereign one sovereign what can it do sovereign can do whatever it wants listen to this now sovereign grace can only be given by one that is suffering and god is sovereign so he can give suffering grace he can save a murderer he can save a adulterer he could save anybody because he is suffering his grace got accepted a lowest sinner to the worst sin praise god because he is sovereign could we give god some praises tonight do you believe that do you believe god could save you that god could deliver you that god could free you regardless of what you have done what you're going to do or what you have already done or what you're doing right now that sovereign grace could deal with all of that do you believe that do you believe what we are preaching tonight oh blessed be the name of the lord praise god god is sovereign so he can give servant grace therefore being sovereign grace are you ready don't have to ask anybody it don't have to it does what it wants to isn't that wonderful it don't have to ask pastor this elder this bishop this apostle this prophet this grace don't have to ask that grace didn't have to ask nate on what to do with david oh glory to god grace just came out of nathan's mouth praise be to jesus and said you shall not die oh glory to god what a difference it was in the gardener eden when the law was laid on that day you eat thereof that day you shall surely die or give the lord some praises but when grace came when jesus came he swallowed up the law and grace became preeminent oh glory to grace came at the end of the law and swallowed up the law and gave us a fresh opportunity to be reconciled to god to get right with god to get back to god go give the lord some praises tonight hallelujah therefore being suffering grace don't have to ask anybody they don't have to it does what it wants to isn't that one you know if people believe this they let go of their tightness and they and the jealousy and the envy and and who god should bless and who god shouldn't bless and why god blessing this one and how come judgment is striking yet and they're looking for this one to fall and looking for this one to fail and they're waiting and they're watching and they don't even understand sovereign grace he's not a sovereign one he could save who he wills he could deliver who he will he could heal who he will he could restore who he will praise god hallelujah praise god the person you think that wouldn't come back they could come back the person said so back sudden almost yes they back sitting and god could still bring them right back or give the lord some praises i know people who have been passing out the church for so long and god restore them and bring them right back and take them home to glory what about the teeth on the cross oh god hallelujah praise god he said remember me and jesus said today though will be whitney and paradise our old miserable teeth i will cook in the village praise god he robbie teeth he do all kind of stuff and at the last minute he got a reprieve by saying the right thing praise god oh god remember me he said today he will be with me in paradise he never got baptized he would never read a bible read a scroll never went to church but he said today you're leaving me in paradise oh glory to god sovereign grace from a suffering one i feel that one is here this night praise god i feel god could do something special for you tonight praise be to jesus do you believe that oh my is not wonderful you don't have to ask can i do this or shall i do this can i must i will i doesn't do it it does it itself grace is sovereign therefore are you ready he can save the violence he can save the worst he can save the impurities he can save the immoralists he can heal the sickness and baranam say hallelujah praise god let me say it again he can save the violence he can save the worst he can save the impurities he can save the immoralist he can heal the sickest hallelujah he can save a wretch like me and he did what is it grace william branham a drunkard's son that don't make any difference the grace of god save me oh glory to god hallelujah me i'm a woman's daughter that was no good don't make any difference the grace of god save you it is suffering it doesn't have to ask anybody i am so glad for that hallelujah god can take the violent sinner and make him whiter snow don't have to ask anybody about it it can't do it because it's suffering oh glory good i love that tonight it is suffering praise god hallelujah then i'll give you hope for anybody praise god everybody whosoever will let him come praise god hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord oh glory but abraham said right here that was proof that the cross when there was a violence thief he deserved to die and god never come across his mind he never taught nothing of it there on the cross when those bloody lips in between the groans there came a song lord be merciful to me and there came another one back through blood tears agony grace took a hold and said today though shall be with me in paradise grace did that how could that thief help himself no more than adam could help himself no one on eve could help herself no one on you could help yourself no more than i can help myself with no more than we could joke or also sir by the milky way with our bootstrap we couldn't do it but the grace of god can do something about it and it does it and the grace of god the sovereignty of the grace of god come to that dying thief today thou shalt be with me in paradise that is wonderful think of it love and grace is sisters twin sisters you can't have grace without having love they are twin sisters oh glory they can't have grace without having love praise god praise god you notice how legal isn't legalist people has pushed a hard look and they're not loving they're not caring have compassion what he wanted is it law moses said stoner she caught in the very act of adultery oh my god they quote the law to get the big stones and just say which when which one of you without sin put the mirror back into the head cast a full stone okay all right so grace is what save us so what exactly before you can have grace you have to have love before you can actually show somebody a favor you love them right or wrong they don't have to be right to love them and they cannot stop you from loving them whether they hate you whether they despise you whether they reject you you still have the power to love and then cannot stop you from loving oh give the lord some praises isn't that something tonight all right so watch something now so love and grace is the same thing they're like twin sisters love and grace we can't see one without the other one so god so loved the world he gave his only begotten son he shed his grace and brought in into our hearts through the holy ghost there's nothing you can do without working one with the other grace god's grace is what save us what is it the grace of god the grace of god god brought grace into our lives by his love for us there is something else grace can't do are you ready grace can't be bought grace can't be sold and i can say this now grace can't be earned so if it fasts 40 days does not own your grace you can fast 100 days it doesn't earn your grace you can't work for grace grace come from sovereign that's why you should worship god that's why he said thank god and bless god and appreciate him and love him he said it's by a sovereign one here we go you can't bargain for it lord if i do this you'll get your grace no you can't bargain for it you can't say god i'll do so and so and you will do so and so you can't do that god won't do it you can't pull nothing out of god god gives it to you by his grace oh could we give god some praises tonight not him that will it or him that run it but is god that showed mercy isn't that right oh glory to god let's hit some bible now ephesians 2 and it says here with it for by grace are you saved through faith not over ourselves it is the gift of god not of works at least any man should boast oh glory to god by grace you are saved through faith not doctrine not i believe in message by grace you are saved through faith not of works such a good boost it's just suffering grace when you be you were preached to and you respond to the gospel it was the grace of god talking in your heart is nothing you did you was pleasing pan you were smoking cigarettes you was floating around fooling around but the gospel hit you and something convict your heart that was the grace and love of god you didn't ask god for that god did that for you praise god praise god praise god who he foreign called who he call it justified oh glory to god who is justified he has already glorified it's the grace of god that has done that for you and that should give you a humble heart [Applause] i'm reading it again for my gracious save ephesians 4 2 8 and that not of ourselves it is the gift of god not of works at least any man should boast now if it's of works you could boast because this is what i do you see how much work i do you can beat your chest but god make sure this thing have no chest beating in it oh give the lord some praises that is for every one of us for the preacher to the janitor god make sure it have no chest beating in this thing nobody can beat the chest based upon what they do what they're doing and what they want to do it has nothing to do with that it's the grace of god coming to you oh glory to god hallelujah praise god not of works at least any man should boast verse 10 for we are his workmanship created in christ jesus unto good works which god before ordained that we should walk in him let me really amplify that that one was there not because of works not the fulfilling of the law's demands at least any man should pose it is not a result of what anyone can possibly do so no one can pride himself in it and take glory to himself oh my hallelujah romans 4 it says here now to him that wicket is the reward not reckon of grace but of death but to him that worketh not but believe on him that justified the ungodly these words are powerful his faith is counted by god i feel to run out inclusive right now his faith is counted for righteousness i don't think this strike people yet i'll read it again now to him that worketh is a reward that not reckon of grace but of debt is that god or you god owe you salvation because you're working for the lord and you're going to church doing this i know what i do now you and your ideas there's nobody bible teaching here this is not what paul teaching here the paul said to him that worketh is a reward not reckon of grace but of debt so god owe you because of what you see yourself doing and working and laboring donkey tinger oxtting layer laboring but to him that worketh not but believe on him that justified the ungodly his faith somebody say faith his faith is counted for righteousness i wonder how much people really believe that oh glory to god hallelujah praise god so faith comes to what we believe works come to what we do so we have what we do and what we believe but abraham he said no watch so in the deity of jesus christ if the lord god could come here and confirm that it is the truth not only that but by his word he confirms the truth and by signs and wonders he confirms the truth then also grace is the truth then why would anyone criticize and say that grace is wrong we are saved by works we are saved by grace that true faith not by works work shows that you have been saved but what save you is the grace of god grace saves you grace is what god does for you works is what you do for god to show appreciation of what god did for you but by grace are you saved period [Applause] no works nothing you could do i know there's a strike here but one day go strike you grace saves you grace is what god does for you works is what you do for god to show appreciation of what god did for you but by grace are you saved some people think now he's going now into the humanistic of what people think all right here are these words some people think because i joined church put my name on the book that's all i have to do some people think because i shout that's all i have to do others think because i speak in tongues that's all i have to do something because i got power to heal the sick that's all i have to do it is not it's the grace of god that saves you god's amazing grace i cannot trust in any merits some said well there's a great man that man i've heard him stand up and do this and that i've heard himself and do that paul said though i speak with tongues of men and angels so i can't claim oh god so he has 40 plus years in ministry therefore that what that means like god owe me something because like 40 years it's still the grace of god i haven't read 40 years 40 years there was hundreds of years there in egypt and god bring them with a mighty hand and they carry with us a bunch of foolishness and calling them dying wilderness that he's saying god we're talking about and grace had them turn to be born in the wilderness and all them people children cross over and them all heads perish in the wilderness that's the same god we serve in the night praise god you have a bunch of people on the earth they're going to make it will you alive and remain not everybody go die out praise god there's somebody going to remain on this earth to make that rapture and to make the coming of the lord the lord himself be saying with a shout to bring a bunch of people out by the grace of almighty god oh we were wretched miserable blind naked and god put eyes out and give us eyes at the sea god gave us clothes of the word to dress ourselves and all glory to god god give us this word a lamp onto our feet and light onto a park now we can see where to walk in this dark hour praise god we are not dead tonight god is not dead tonight his grace is still alive whether you're feeling it don't fear it's still alive it kept you all these years praise god your miserable life is still grace to you glory to god your sinful life has been still god christ are you oh glory to god here put your name in your book because you have good behavior he put your name on the book before the foundation of the world before your first sin your first mistake your first lie praise god of whatever it is oh glory to god he's not no saving you oh glory to god we'll get me started tonight oh glory to god he has elected you and foreign you i am not ashamed of this gospel oh glory to god hallelujah it's the power of god unto salvation amen oh hallelujah praise god praise god you may be seated oh glory i feel good tonight people like to hold up to your sins people like to hold up to your past the devil is a liar tonight you want to go back and memory lane you did this it is that shut up devil the blood the blood the blood prevails oh glory to god the blood of jesus christ it has power to save just like an old time taste oh glory to god the blood prevails no matter what the devil say thank god the blood prevails oh glory to god hallelujah thank you lord jesus amazing grace i cannot trust in any merits some say well there's a great man or if you skip that so paul said in first guaranteeing do i speak with tons of men and angels do i have this mint do i have gifts to feed do i take on my grudge to feed the poor all of these works do i give move mountains with fate do i have knowledge to understand all things all mysteries inclusion seven to understand trump is biased on the other side the mystery of you by the supper you will see of the of the millennium division of the of of the pyramid building and everything else you know all the mysteries and don't have this thing called charity this thing called l-o-v-e praise god holly i am zero nada nothing not hallelujah praise god praise god praise god amen do i have knowledge to understand all the things i am nothing till love comes in which is grace i am nothing till love comes into grace no i preach for 50 years 100 years i am nothing till love comes which is grace are you with me and god has to do it you can't do all these things and you can do all these things and still be lost it is grace that saves you caught grace to the human race let me say this my sinner friend you may be here this morning a prostitute you may be here this morning a woman chaser you may hear a drunkard a gambler or murderer you might be here in pure husband impure wife you might be the values of sinner you say i am past that stage of redemption no you are not or you wouldn't be at the church this morning grace will make a way for you in this dark hour if you will accept it you have to be willing to accept it accept it you say accept it you have to accept it to know that you have no works you have nothing to bring nothing in my arms i bring simply to die cross-cycling nothing just accept it oh god grace i've taken it tonight i'm going with that tonight i've taken that oh glory to god i gotta offer grace i'm going with that anybody that's willing to repent the grace of god still goes for you the grace of god is searching for you so that goes for you back sitting this morning the grace of god is still looking for you if you just repent god grace is sufficient so it's important to understand it is not of works at least man can pose with works man can post what you have done what i have done this boasting comes from pride and that was the downfall of the angel known as lucifer you see that i will be like the most high i will ascend to the knot i want to be like god and so on and he'll get a whole bunch of angels to follow him and that's why you get your boots and get kicked out now first peter 5 5 says likewise he younger submit yourselves unto the elder ye all of you be subject one to another be closed with humility for god resisted the proud and give greece to the humble right go let's do what resist push depart back when you're looking and you're praying he pulled praying go there and say you know pushing them back resist the proud but give grace to the humble hallelujah so god's way of making us righteous doesn't bring on pride actually the first sign of the holy ghost is what humility the very first time of the holy ghost is humility romans 11 6 says and if by grace then it is no more works otherwise grace is no more grace and if it be of works then it's no more grace otherwise work is no more work you cannot earn greece you can't live on the boat is either you're walking or you're greeting hallelujah praise god you're on the work labor law or you're under grace isn't that right romans 3 20 says therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight for by the law is the knowledge of sin and the amplified they say for no person will be justified made righteous acquitted and judged acceptable in his sight by observing the works prescribed by the law for the refunction of the law is to make men recognize and be conscious of sin not mere perception but an acquaintance with sin which works toward repentance faith and holy character so the law really is the discern and the exposed sin but it couldn't cure sin that job was for mr grace he said mr law identified you you failed here you're a sinner here this year this year this year but law couldn't correct that but grace grace graces will exchange your murder the man and grace come and put you and say no you are my son remember that story somebody killed the king's son the only son and they can't come to see what man that did their killing and when he see the man oh yeah let me send him oh god king i got in the temper and i didn't want to do it i didn't mean to do it but i'm sorry you lost your son the king put his woman and said no you're my son explain that and that man who was jailed walk out with the king as the king's son just lose her son and take up another son adopt another son rob another son you can't explain these things you can't explain how god could take you sometimes you say well why me lord why me lord you deserve to send me to hell but god chose you praise god he love you that's why you're here tonight praise god he wants to bless you he wants to help you he wants to encourage you he wants his grace extend to you his want has reached his love to reach down to you oh praise the name of the lord praise god you cannot earn grace praise god romans 3 20 therefore by the deeds of the lord there shall be no flesh be justified in his sight for by the law knowledge of sin okay so the book that really strike this legalism this this thing that after people get saved all of a sudden they start to drift the wrong way from god taking them around sinai hallelujah i'm saying oh god that jesus sweet jesus jesus was sweet and afterwards jesus come from so sweet until decided to judge others as to why this and that and you know and whatnot and legalism is a tough thing to deal with and paul addressed that in galatians and galatians 1 verse 6 says i marvel that you so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of god onto another gospel so outside the greece gospel message corporal called another gospel which is not another but there be some that trouble you and would pervert the gospel of christ chapter three galatians one or foolish galatians who would be with you that you should not obey the truth before whose eyes jesus christ has been heaven evidently set forth crucify among you this only would i learn of you receiving the spirit by the works of the law or by the hearing of faith and this is a classy pauline expression are we bringing this out here are you so foolish paul rebook in the church galatians church having begun in the spirit you are now perfect by the flesh you're starting the spirit but no you're trying to work your way to get rewarded by god when your actions all along from the very beginning has been won like a childlike fate we trust and believe god when we came to the lord we didn't know the word we didn't know all what god said but we trust him because he saved us or we know we're not into smoke and drinking and carrying on again because something happened and within us to receive the gospel to receive the good news that we don't have to live the way we live isn't that right now this only amplified that's what we just read galatians 3 1-3 it says oh you poor and silly and thoughtless and unreflecting senseless galatians who was fascinated or bewitched or cast a spell over you of whom right before your very eyes jesus christ the messiah was openly and graphically set forth and portrayed as crucified let me ask you this one question did you receive the holy spirit as a result of obeying the law and doing this works or was it by hearing the message of the gospel and believing it was it from observing a law of rituals or from a message of faith are you so foolish and so senseless and so silly having begun your new life spiritually with the holy spirit are you now reaching perfection by dependence on the flesh oh hallelujah this is challenging tonight i'm telling you oh gloria this is going to roughen some feathers tonight please go the illegalistic government a lot of fight they will have a recess thing tonight because you're talking about faith here now and trust and confidence in god that has called you by his grace okay galatians 3. oh we're running some scriptures you're almost like a bible study this time i'll be running here all right run with me galatians 3 from verse 10 for as many as of the works of the lord under the curse for this written curses every one that continues not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them but that no man is justified by the law in the sight of god it is evident for the josh live by faith and i was looted a message oh so luther who was trying to say hailey mary and starting to do penance and kneel down and and and work himself up the justification one day luther stumbled upon a big bible and when he read the just after kneeling all them steps because the pope said if you caught these steps on your knees for 500 steps you're going to get justified and he poor fella he climbing up the steps and when he finished war up there he's still not justified but when he hit that word and said the just shall live by faith you are justified by faith luther got a revelation and shook up the whole roman catholic empire by a revelation of justification which come only by faith or give the lord some praises praise so if god justified by faith how could we get justification by the law that's not working and the law is not of faith the man that do with them shall live by them christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law being made a curse for us for his written curses everyone that hung out in a tree that the blessing oh this is this is the scripture that hit me that the blessing of abram might come on the gentiles through jesus christ that we might receive the promise of the spirit through faith oh give the lord if this don't make you shout tonight i don't know what will the promise of the spirit is whole say it again true faith is the promise of the spirit the promise is unto you and to your children and to them that are far off even as many as the lord our god shall call you shall receive power after the holy ghost is come upon you that's the promise praise god and you receive that promise through faith oh glory to god right now tonight you are under a promise what promised a promise of god he breathed upon them receiving the holy ghost it was a promise hanging over them oh glory to god hallelujah and what did the prophet say when the church has grown in that the holy ghost is just as real the damn as it was only a pentecost oh glory to god there will be a bunch of people on this earth in this message that would believe the same holy ghost that peter had that paul had that the early church had in the same holy ghost that promised not no new holy ghost oh glory but not no quiet holy ghost not no silent holy ghost the same one that they got in the upper room oh glory to god the same spirit same sign same wonders say miracles i am preaching nothing less than that same penny same pay oh glory to god hallelujah glory to god glory to god thank you lord jesus oh glory to god hallelujah praise god praise god praise god hallelujah hallelujah you define the building hallelujah glory glory glory glory praise be to jesus hallelujah hallelujah you'll eat under the law under grace but you can't be on the boat you can't be in prison and alter prison at the same time is that their god for you ain't going to free you it's either your debt is paid or your debt is not paid is that that jesus drop your charges or you still have your charges on you and if your case is dismissed why can't you rejoice when the headstone come it will come with shoutings of grace grace grace unto it i am talking about the headstone don't take this as some baby message you know there's the headstone have to come down with shelters of what of what not by night nor by power but by my spirit said god almighty the church could be rebuilt in the power of the spirit under the anointing of god's grace oh glory i feel that grace is here tonight oh grace is here to you my brother that grace is here to you my sister father hallelujah mother husband wife that grace is here for you tonight glory to god that grace is here for your children oh glory to god don't ever doubt that don't ever question that oh they're gonna be delivered you believe that or gonna free them you believe that i don't care how they tap in the devils right now oh my hallelujah go with god romans 6 verse 14 says for sin shall not have dominion over you for you are not under the law but under grace you say what then shall we sin because we are not under the law but on the grace you say god forbid no you not that to whom you heal yourself civil to be his servants you are to whom you will be whether sin unto death or obedience unto righteousness but god be tanked that we were servants of sin but we have obeyed here we go from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered to you being then made free from sin you become servant of righteousness hallelujah i speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh for ye have yielded your member servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity even so now in your members servants to righteousness unto holiness for when you were servants of sin you were free from righteousness what fruit had you done and those things wherever you now will be ashamed for the end of those things is death but now being made free from sin we become servants to god you have your fruit unto holiness and end everlasting life for the wishes of sin is death but the gift of god is eternal life true jesus christ our lord oh my so what do you want do this a law there are some people love legalism they love legal ministers they love the law cracking on their back because they want righteousness and it's not internalized and they want somebody to help them with it so they crack whip of the lure you know and make them line up and things like that but then romans 8 14 give us the key here for as many as are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god so we have law word and and rules and being led by the spirit now god wants each one of us to be led by his spirit and his spirit wouldn't lead you contrary to the word praise god because the word and the spirit is one so when you say led by the spirit doesn't mean some ghost some kind of thing then you contrary praise god the spirit of the word but did you buy the word it wouldn't be out of the world isn't that right so romans 8 14 says for by for as many as led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god and galatians 5 18 says but if you be led by the spirit you are not under the law so those that are not by the spirit on the rules and regulations and we know how to obey this and do this but those that are led by the spirit they are not under the law so a clock without action you can't tell the time you ever see a dead clock you tell any time or twice a day right it just stopped there for the clock to tell the time something had to move something else did on the inside isn't that right you always have to have some action oh praise god but then we find again that when this man saw the first thing you know he got great then stuck out his chest certainly we built this thing we've done this and when he done it then he got to a place he didn't want samuel's advice anymore he done it the way he wanted to do it and that is what happened today the people has got to a place that they don't want to do it the way god wants to do it they want to do it the way they want to do it and that's the matter today god wants divine healing amongst his people the big high fellow said no wait a minute these are miracles is is past no no they don't say that no you just say push at that side like pentecostal let me bring some mysteries that are you saying spiritual these are miracles is past because all is the word mysteries is your word miracles is the word i know people think but euro doesn't like the mysteries i hear too in love with the mysteries but christ is the mystery and i am a mystery oh anger like the mystery christ is the mystery of god revealed so it's not a matter of not liking mysteries it's a matter of what they're emphasizing and what they're leaving out sometimes it's not what they're saying is what they leave out that is dangerous because there are sick saints that need healing and the only way we can have it is if we put our foot in it god tell joshua every place you put your foot is yours we are born with these gifts we are born with this fate as we say you're not born a soldier you have become a soldier you see a slacker on the street and they put them in the army all of a sudden you see their shoulders straight back and they walk in they reckon upright and they could hold a gun and they could go and fight because they have been trained to do that well god comes calls on people in this last days to take them aside and train them and shoulder them and give them corn and ripple of warfare to fight the enemy with everything you got whatever you've got to use you use it you have a song sing it you have a voice preach it whatever you're going to do do it oh give the lord some praises hallelujah watch god wants divine healing among his people who wants that he does not really believe it right god too so i on his side he warns divine healing among his people now what caused saul to do that here we go when he got to a place that he took over the leading of the people instead of letting the holy spirit how much pastors take over is there no holy spirit leader and then they won't touch the idea that they're in it and the leading people show and satan is a big director behind them because by the fruit you'll know if you're leaving people to hate malice evil separation no brotherly love no fellowship you know that the devil i don't care who behind it i don't care what they say it's lucifer himself conducting behind the conductor because god pushing for fate unity pillar fire power praise god manifested sons adopted sons praised sons character got pushing for that praise god hallelujah what we're pushing for now watch what caused you all to do that when he got to a place see no he didn't start like that he started left by the spirit god told simon anoint him the one king gave him king but he was called by god led in the right position to be placed as king over israel so he started in the spirit start off anointed but watch what happened here when he got to a place when he took over the leading of the people instead of letting the holy spirit know samuel told him he said now if you go ahead and have your king you only live right and keep god's commandments and do what the lord says follow the spirit saul will be able to preach some mighty good messages and he did they had no right to disbelieve samuel because samuel always prophesied the truth to them he told them what truth but he said now if you will just let saul and all of you follow the leadings of the spirit keep the commandments of the lord everything will be all right if that taking place tonight in every church in the united states there will be a revival start in this nation i will tell you whiskey joints would be broke up it would be one of the grandest thing this nation ever know if every preacher of all the nomination would just follow the leading of the holy spirit instead of some creed or some denomination or some bishop said or somebody shell said or somebody said what somebody else said has nothing to do with it god sent the holy spirit and he is our guide he is our leader and when oh glory to god not some bishop not some man in america some special message pope praise god so man praise god and jeff or wherever god said no man has no leader god sent the holy spirit or give the lord some praises hallelujah god send the holy spirit as the leader oh close and as men are led by the spirit of god oh god they are the sons of god god let us on sunday god leading us tonight god will lead us next sunday and wednesday or whatever as god leads us we want to follow that leading and if we are led by the spirit it will be vindicated oh glory to god let me say that again it will be vindicated it will be confirmed that is the leading of the holy spirit is what god once spoken oh blessed be name of the lord so god sent the holy spirit and he is our guide he is our leader but when even the holy spirit move in watch so but when they even see here we go the holy spirit moving they get scared of it they don't know what it is i remember that convention years ago in trinidad when the spirit i think i kind of was preaching when the spirit began to move i better come behind and talk about he don't know that quality of spirit but joy is not talking about man it was strange to them they know nothing about the movement of the spirit they know nothing about the operation of the spirit all they know is word word they're bringing forth word and the spirit can't move at all they're buying we've got buying with chains of circumstance buying the spirit of unbelief the spirit can't move because where the spirit of the lord is i think there is supposed to be liberty it's not right brother where the spirit of the lord is there is shout out liberty shout out to liberty again where the spirit is there is liberty you have the freedom to worship freedom the praise god freedom to take your atmosphere freedom my god there is liberty where the spirit of god is oh glory to god so watch so when the scene even the holy spirit moves in they get scared of it they don't know what it is one it's a stranger to them because they are not taught in that line gathered by clients they are not taught in that line so they don't know that spirit line i could identify the spirit line in the message and the intellectual line i could identify the quotes that the intellectual will take and the tools that the spirit line will take i said openly already i am on the spirit line so you'll find me on a certain track that is where i'm going to run on they have an intellectual line you have a spirit line brought any message both are believers both are anointed both are ministers but one on an intellectual track and one on our spirit line track praise god i could tell you to your face i'm on the spirit line track i am moving praise god over to the intellectual track oh glory to god in every quote they say we can say amen to earth oh glory hallelujah because the quote they quoting is the word but praise god but we are still staying on the spirit line track oh glory god took the prophet but didn't take the angel god took the prophet but didn't take the holy ghost god took the prophet but didn't take praise god the manifestation that he prophesied that is to come and we are witnesses that this is that that the prophet william branham speak of oh glory to god hallelujah let me see if i could hit the home stretch here now it's as strange as them because they're not taught in that line they are taught just on certain things that the church believes and they go on right like that they go through life callings of christians and go on with the things of the world and when they come to die they say my faith saves me and they come to die hallelujah then he said this i said to a man some time ago i said sir didn't the lord ever condemn you for that smoking he said oh he said no i said i have seen you drink myself he said look here preacher i want to tell you something i visit another man in a room he said my faith saves me nobody gets into the topic works must follow faith he said my faith says me i said but mister let me tell you something now faith without works is dead i said the holy spirit don't live a life like that see i said you may be disappointed i said no the fate is all right but if the works don't follow the faith then the fate is no good if the works don't follow the faith you know how i say we just say must be born again works must follow faith it's not a suggestion it must now we the children of abraham not as exact was but his royal sea to christ jesus by the faith he had abraham she'd come and fought in the last days to shine like the stars almost done abram's children considering not his own body now dead neither even considered it it wasn't even brought into question whether god would do it or not god said he would do it why why it was revealed to him when it's revealed to you you can't make it happen it's got to be revealed to you so when it's revealed to you you don't even consider else impossible you don't consider what the doctor said you don't consider what mama said what the preacher said what anybody said you only consider what god said because it's a revelation and revelation is faith or give the lord some praises [Applause] if it's not revealed and you're claiming it by faith that's a different thing are you expecting god to do this and expecting god to do that but you don't have a revelation of that so when god doesn't do it you get disappointed and you've expected god your vex with this you're vex with everybody else but was it revealed to you when abraham got the revelation of isaac it was so real that when he go to the doctor and the doctor said listen old man let's get serious now let's get serious sarah passed childbearing you understand that abraham said i understand that you know but let me get serious to you do you know what god told me do you know what god said god told me i'll be a father of nations god told me true sarah sees coming forth and the bible said not i say the bible says abraham staggered not at the promise of god through unbelief but was strong in strong in faith which was a revelation he wasn't taking it by faith he had a revelation that isaac was coming not coming isaac was already in him because he had isaac by faith oh glory to god my god enough peter jumped tonight glory to god i mean god give you a revelation no devil in hell could take that from you because jesus is upon this rock i will build my church and the gates of hell shall never prevail against it oh glory to god amen hallelujah hallelujah glory he considered not his own body now dead his body was dead neither the dead is of syria's whom it wasn't even brought under consideration he didn't have a second thought but if she all she did that that then listen the promise was so exciting to him that he didn't even say that dead boom didn't contain consideration no no consideration whatsoever right like that like insult to tell him about sarah you're talking nothing she also you can sing the old song you can make it all special and sarah that's it that's your business you have nothing to do with that oh glory to god isaac was coming forth oh glory to god hallelujah do you understand what revelation does when god told abraham to offer by zach oh glory that god gave him he said i and the lad be going up and and then i'll be coming back down and he know you're gonna offer up isaac and he tied on isaac on the altar and he come along with the knife god himself had to call him out by oh oh yeah hold your hand oh he wasn't holding back i said lord is this you what i wanted to the revelation no he had it he know god is able to resize that from the dead oh he had confidence if isaac died god could raise him from the dead because this was the child of promise or give the lord some praises that's when you get a divine revelation nothing stops you oh glory to god and revelation is sovereign revelation comes from god no man can give you revelation religion come by the holy ghost the holy ghost is suffering or give the lord some praises the same sovereign one that believes sovereign grace he gives sovereign revelation oh give the lord a shout amen amen amen let me see i can wrap up here hallelujah hallelujah let's go if you was led by the spirit and all sons and daughters of god are led by the spirit of god they move by the spirit odd strange they stay right every action is with the bible all their doctrine stays right with the bible they don't vary on one thing where the bible say it they will move right on it if they stop for a minute they are trying to study and see which way to make then the holy spirit reveals it and he moves right on and he does the same thing follow the same rules lay the same foundation the same god comes upon him the same wonders the same miracles the same signs follow him that follow him he said if you can't believe me jesus being a man jesus said this believe the works that i do jesus is bringing a testimony of his father and his kingdom preaching the kingdom he said okay if you don't believe me take the word check the works out all right believe me if i do not the works of my father then don't believe me there is works goals but this faith show me your works by without your faith and i will show you my works by my faith said paul paul said that oh glory to god hallelujah hallelujah praise god praise god oh let me say wrap up here now who romans 8 3 and 4. for what the law could not do and that it was weak to the flesh god sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin condemn sin in the flesh what's the purpose next verse explain the purpose that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit so the sin had to be condemned that the rashes of the law could be fulfilled because the law couldn't produce righteousness by keeping the law but the law had righteousness in it oh glory to god and what is the righteousness of the lord then let's hear matthew 22 verse 35. then one of them which was a lawyer a lawyer asked him a question this is talking to jesus tempting him and saying master which is the great commandment in the law there's a question that this lawyer presented to jesus and jesus said unto him though shall love the lord thy god with all thy heart with all thy soul with all thy mind this is the first and great commandment and the second is like unto it thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself and then jesus made this notable statement in verse 40. on these two commandments hang all the law and prophets on these two what's the two love god with all my heart mind and soul and love your neighbor as yourself everything else hanging on that praise god you're almost finished okay so i'll tell you where we are we're in page 13 and i have 15 pages surface two more pictures all right romans 13 verse 8 oh no man anything but to love one another for he that loved it another had fulfilled the law for this he's continuing those shall not commit adultery those shall not kill those shall not steal those shall not be a false witness though shall not covet if there be any other commandment it is briefly comprehended in this saying namely thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself love worketh no ill to his neighbor therefore love is the fulfilling of the law so the law be it fulfills that with a hard face and a big belt and a big whip but love is the fulfilling of the law galatians 5 13-14 for brethren you have been called unto liberty only use not the liberty for an occasion to the flesh but by love serve one another for all the law is fulfilled in one word even this that thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself all the law is fulfilled one word hello v love thy neighbor as thyself galatians 5 6 and we read that as the text for in jesus christ neither circumcision a villain anything nor uncircumcision but fate which worketh by love so faith worked by love and james said faith without works is dead so we conclude that seventh and fate without love is dead with all the faith and no love it's a dead fate when you're talking oh hallelujah hallelujah go begin the first lord 1 5 and 6. now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart and of a good conscience and a fake unfield from which some have swerved having turned aside onto vane jungling that's really amplified whereas the object and purpose of our instruction and charge is love which springs from a pure heart a good clear conscience sincere on fake faith but certain individuals have missed the mark on this very matter and have wandered away intervene arguments and discussions and purposeless talk so when you get away from love it's discussions arguments and purposeless talk okay almost true mission comma please oh blessed be with the lord could you take a little more james two are we coming to the close 15 to 18. if a brother or sister be naked and destitute of daily food and one of you say unto them depart in peace be warmed and filled you know people are they speak in a wood be warmed and filled notwithstanding you give them those things which are needful to the body what knotted prophet even so faith if it heart not works is dead being alone yet a man may say thou has faith and i have works show me thy faith without thy works and i will show you my faith by my works but abraham said this here god leads his people through great trials to punch them sometimes it takes years to do it as for me myself i believe that right now god is training such men to meet the front line men who are going through and time shook from their feet sometimes it looked like the whole thing is falling yet in the midst of all of it they know that living god and keep their face forward and keep moving on this is the part i want to get as we wrap up here and many people praying for revival begin to pray something i wonder if sometimes if those who are praying if their own prayer don't stop up the wells of blessings when they are are you ready cowardly and afraid to trust god and afraid to take him at his word after you pray you have to act works must follow faith let us stand and begin the praise god tonight oh blessed be the name of the lord works must it's not a recommendation if you're not seeing any worth behind faith is not faith at all that's the bottom line if there is no action behind your confession of what you believe you don't believe it if you really believe you're going to act upon it let's pray father god we thank you for your presence lord and i pray that your anointing will come and bring divine revelation to your people of your grace of your love and of faith and the works to follow that faith bless them i commit them into your hands in jesus name i ask it amen and amen god bless you thanks again for coming out tonight [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh give him glory and lift your hands and just worship him tonight all the way thank you lord we praise your father hallelujah glory to god hallelujah thank you father glory to god oh thank you jesus hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh blessed be your holy name oh hallelujah hallelujah oh thank you jesus oh my faith looks up to thee [Music] oh now [Music] take on my sins away [Music] one [Music] [Applause] [Music] i'm [Music] [Music] my sins away oh [Music] hallelujah [Music] god hallelujah grace grace [Music] god's grace who graced that [Music] [Music] praise god [Music] that is greater and all my sins [Music] oh grace [Music] is [Music] one more time but all your heart over [Music] oh god [Music] oh now lift your hand just give him a shot out praise hallelujah thank you father glory to god hallelujah thank you for your grace tonight thank you for your mercy tonight oh thank you for your holy spirit thank you for your word speaking to us oh hallelujah oh we are called by grace all walk by faith and not my side oh hallelujah hallelujah oh deep in our hearts lord we believe lord jesus we believe your word lord we believe the promise of the father oh even the holy spirit that comforters come oh hallelujah hallelujah glory to god or to lead us and guide us into all truth not of works that we could post
