[21:08] ephesians chapter 2 reading from verse 1
[21:10] and you
[21:11] had a quickened who were dead in
[21:14] trespasses and sins
[21:16] wherein in time past he walked according
[21:18] to the course of this world
[21:20] according to the prince of the power of
[21:22] the ear
[21:23] the spirit that now worketh in this
[21:26] children
[21:26] of disobedience among whom also we all
[21:29] had our conversation
[21:31] in times past in the lust of our flesh
[21:34] fulfilling the desires of the flesh and
[21:37] of the mind
[21:38] and were by nature the children of wrath
[21:41] even as others
[21:42] sinner was no differentiation at all but
[21:45] god
[21:47] bought god who is rich in mercy
[21:50] for his great love where it he loved us
[21:53] even when we were dead in sins had
[21:56] quickened us together with christ
[21:59] by grace are you saved and had raised us
[22:01] up together and made us sit together
[22:03] in heavenly places in christ jesus that
[22:06] in the ages to come
[22:07] he might show the exceeding riches of
[22:10] his grace in his kindness towards us
[22:12] through christ jesus for by grace are
[22:14] you safe through faith
[22:16] and not of ourselves it is a gift of god
[22:20] none of works at least any man should
[22:21] boast for we
[22:23] are his workmanship created in christ
[22:26] jesus unto good works which god had
[22:28] before
[22:29] ordained that we should walk in them may
[22:32] god bless his word
[22:33] amen you may be seated oh praise the
[22:36] name of the lord
[22:38] hallelujah how many feel good to be here
[22:40] how many feel good to be in the presence
[22:42] of god
[22:43] and where the twos and trees are
[22:45] gathered there we are there he is in the
[22:46] midst
[22:47] amen praise god but tonight have a title
[22:50] return
[22:51] to another ephesians return to
[22:54] non-efficient
[22:54] uh last time we spoke with last
[22:56] wednesday we don't want to return to
[22:57] that first love
[22:58] getting back to that love getting back
[23:00] to that word isn't that right
[23:02] and we spoke about the future is that
[23:03] please god the passion to know his word
[23:05] the cry for reaching out to the spirit
[23:07] all begins to feed
[23:09] and instead of the church being on fire
[23:11] with the fire of god that has cooled off
[23:13] and become a bit former that is what was
[23:16] happening back literally ephesians
[23:17] they were getting formal the abandonment
[23:20] to god
[23:21] was dying out and the people want to
[23:23] careful
[23:24] about what god taught of them as they
[23:26] begin to be careful
[23:28] about what the world taught of them so
[23:30] you see when they come to that spot
[23:32] where you're more concerned about what
[23:33] god thinks about your mother husband
[23:35] father brother wife whatever
[23:36] it doesn't matter what people say humans
[23:38] you want to study what god says
[23:41] how god feel about your life how god
[23:43] feel about your actions and your
[23:45] attitude
[23:46] and so on then it be so ephesians fss
[23:48] means relaxed
[23:50] drifting aim at and relax at high aims
[23:53] but they got relaxed and we can't afford
[23:55] to get relaxed
[23:56] that's why we want to push up the key a
[23:58] bit have that all-night prayer meeting
[24:00] we want to keep adding and adding an
[24:02] errand
[24:02] because we want to know we're making
[24:03] that progress you say but ram says
[24:05] you've got to do something for god to
[24:07] honor
[24:08] there are people who do like no kind of
[24:09] sacrifice they want god to bless them as
[24:12] they are
[24:12] you see but you see we once were sinners
[24:15] we wants in lust we want all kind of
[24:17] stuff
[24:17] but god rich and but god rich rich rich
[24:20] and mercy
[24:21] had quicken us that's the word we want
[24:24] to emphasize tonight
[24:25] quicken quicken us hallelujah to our
[24:28] lively hope
[24:29] quicken us to a higher order quicken us
[24:33] gonna have to quicken you
[24:34] that's why all the father phone knew he
[24:36] called
[24:37] amen you have to be called of god to be
[24:39] quickened
[24:41] hallelujah non-elect cannot be quickened
[24:43] but you can be quickened
[24:45] think about it now you were down in sin
[24:47] you were doing whatever but god
[24:48] quickened you
[24:49] and gave your eyes out that you may see
[24:52] that you could put your foot and walk
[24:54] that's why we could come and worship
[24:55] that's why you can come and express your
[24:57] faith and love to god
[24:58] because he actually quicken you
[25:00] understand these people not just trying
[25:02] to press
[25:02] to go to church like they stand up to to
[25:04] play lotto
[25:06] or go in a cinema or something like that
[25:08] no no no they line up to the play lotto
[25:11] they line up to protect the gamble they
[25:12] line up to go on something like that but
[25:14] they're not going to have to come in the
[25:15] church
[25:16] god had to quicken you and then your
[25:18] soul is being fed
[25:20] by the word your camera's service
[25:23] because your soul is being fed by the
[25:26] word
[25:27] every service they're getting
[25:28] strengthened every savings are getting
[25:31] quicker
[25:31] every service you get in revelation
[25:34] every service you're being empowered
[25:36] and you're going from grace by grace to
[25:38] grace to grace
[25:39] you're going from glory to glory from
[25:41] power to power from strength to strength
[25:43] oh glory to god amen
[25:47] end time evangelism this is background
[25:49] from last week
[25:50] according to malachi 4 he is to bring
[25:52] back the faith that was once delivered
[25:53] to the saints bring them back
[25:55] to the fate of the fathers the
[25:57] pentecostal part
[25:59] in the restoration time this message is
[26:02] yet to see the pentecostal part
[26:05] hallelujah we have message part teaching
[26:07] part
[26:08] word pact but it's a pentecostal part in
[26:11] the restoration time
[26:12] we have to move into that part that's
[26:14] the holy ghost part
[26:16] that's the spirit part that's the
[26:18] quickening part
[26:19] that's where the quickening power comes
[26:21] to quicken the word to you
[26:23] oh glory to god hallelujah understand
[26:26] what the holy ghost is for to anoint the
[26:28] promises to yourself
[26:30] all glory that the promise is not oh
[26:32] dear the promises is here because you
[26:34] are
[26:35] no internet to yourself you have the
[26:37] spirit to anoint it to you
[26:39] oh that's why joshua could say caleb
[26:41] could say if the lord be with me
[26:43] if this quick and power be with me if
[26:46] this anointing be with me
[26:48] if the spirit be with me i shall be able
[26:51] to
[26:52] oh give the lord a shout the nerves do
[26:54] you understand that
[26:56] he wasn't talking intellectual talk you
[26:58] know he was talking spirit talk
[27:00] if the spirit be with me when the spirit
[27:03] of the lord
[27:04] comes upon my heart you see what david
[27:06] did
[27:07] when the spirit come upon him what
[27:09] samson did when the spirit come upon him
[27:12] all those brothers when the spirit come
[27:14] upon them that's a different thing
[27:15] altogether
[27:16] that's a different man altogether the
[27:19] spirit has to come upon you
[27:21] oh glory to god and i want that to break
[27:23] up on you tonight
[27:24] that you must know you have to go back
[27:27] to another ephesians
[27:28] we don't want a corinthian church we
[27:30] don't want galatians church all that is
[27:32] good
[27:32] that's scripture we want ephesians
[27:37] we want the original because you could
[27:39] breed back the original
[27:41] we could plant and get back the original
[27:43] oh glory to god hallelujah
[27:46] you can't breed back no hybrid no mule
[27:49] oh glory to god original tower bed horse
[27:53] you could get back that because he know
[27:55] his father is his grandfather is he a
[27:57] storybread horse
[27:59] and when they get a true word believer
[28:01] he is thoroughbred
[28:02] just drop the word on him and he's a big
[28:05] hearty amen
[28:06] just deliver the word to him and because
[28:09] that's nothing but the truth
[28:11] that's a terrible horse believer a
[28:13] sovereign word believer
[28:15] you don't want god to you don't want god
[28:17] to bless you in your own thing there
[28:19] you want to come out of that you want to
[28:21] be quicker like the scripture says
[28:23] hallelujah we were once this way once
[28:26] that way
[28:26] but god had quickened us into the higher
[28:29] order
[28:30] not above the animals but a little lower
[28:32] than the angels
[28:34] oh glory to god so it's the pentecostal
[28:36] part
[28:37] in the restoration time i'll restore
[28:40] saith the lord
[28:41] now everything is hybrid even they got
[28:43] hybrid churches
[28:46] not only hybrid corn hybrid churches
[28:49] hybrid christians took in my shaken
[28:51] hands they can dress better
[28:53] use better english and so forth but that
[28:54] ain't got no life in it
[28:56] you take a big fine a of corn hybrid
[28:58] maybe it's twice as pretty as the other
[29:00] one
[29:00] plant it it will die because have no
[29:03] life in it
[29:04] we don't want nothing hybrid we want the
[29:07] genuine thing
[29:08] [Music]
[29:09] do you want the genuine thing
[29:13] you haven't got it still it still stay
[29:16] there till it comes
[29:17] why accept a substitute when the
[29:19] pentecostal sides
[29:20] are full of real nothing hybrid it won't
[29:23] stand you always have to spray a hybrid
[29:25] plant to keep the bugs over it

[29:32] all kind of things that give the bully
[29:34] bugs

[29:38] want to leave the church you might join
[29:39] a lot you can join a methodist lodge
[29:41] baptist lodge pentecostal lodge but you

[31:46] even nice that wasn't a gas lamp you
[31:48] know what nothing
[31:50] i was on a gas lamp hallelujah and water
[31:53] from the well
[31:56] oh glory to god when you look back now
[31:58] he said how to be a crazy preacher he
[32:00] had to be something like crazy man
[32:01] wasn't crazy what's our reality that
[32:04] this message come to
[32:05] haunt the elected seats
[32:08] [Music]
[32:09] i was when a fisherman children's net is
[32:12] fishy gonna catch you know
[32:13] but when he pulling her crabs snake wabi
[32:15] all kind of thing
[32:18] he it but he neck all of that but his
[32:21] fishy one
[32:22] and god sent him to catch fish
[32:26] some fish hiding in the bar some fish
[32:28] smoking and drinking
[32:30] some fiction swims in sin but god had to
[32:32] find them
[32:33] waiting god find you you look don't look
[32:36] look at me like a boner christian
[32:39] god find you wherever you are you have
[32:41] to hunt you and find you
[32:43] then then he clean you up no look at you
[32:46] you had it quicken
[32:48] and if you're not quick and yet you will
[32:50] be quicker
[32:51] because the seed alone can be quicker oh
[32:54] give the lord and shelter nerves
[32:57] only the seed alone can be reborn when
[33:00] god created a church he created a
[33:01] pentecostal church
[33:03] no no dead message sitting on church
[33:05] talking about world war ii
[33:06] the original church that ephesians
[33:08] church was a pentecostal church
[33:11] that means that shouting singing jumping
[33:13] praise god pentecostal clapping
[33:15] you can't clap something is wrong
[33:17] because that's part of the pentecostal
[33:19] experience
[33:20] the leaves clapping and then the word
[33:21] comes to me the fruit in the midst of
[33:23] that pentecostal atmosphere
[33:26] before god can send a prophet he had to
[33:28] send on the atmosphere
[33:30] 1906 the atmosphere dropped down and
[33:33] even before that
[33:34] god said behold i sat before the open
[33:36] door so he put a bloodline
[33:38] in the aids before laodicea to bring the
[33:41] spirit itself
[33:42] without no man messenger or give the
[33:44] lord a shout
[33:46] oh glory to god he said i sat before the
[33:49] unopened door
[33:50] i thought was no man open and no man
[33:52] could shut
[33:53] and god open the door to the spirit
[33:55] without putting a man inside of the ear
[33:57] so you don't need a man to bring on the
[34:01] spirit of the lord himself
[34:08] the spirit is already here do you
[34:10] believe that
[34:12] the dynamics is here if we could only
[34:14] get started
[34:15] god will do the rest we have to get
[34:17] started
[34:18] let's get started tonight we're going
[34:21] back to ephesians
[34:22] then fight for earth you don't want the
[34:24] corinthians church

[34:48] workmanship not of a man
[34:49] but the workmanship of god oh hallelujah
[34:52] give the lord a shout
[34:54] what do you think the lord himself
[34:55] descended from heaven with a message
[34:58] not my message i don't have a message
[35:00] god sent a message
[35:01] we are echoing a message from a 20th
[35:04] century prophet
[35:05] to prepare your hearts to turn your
[35:07] hearts back to the faith of the fathers
[35:09] because the fate is to go back and pick
[35:11] up what they have back there
[35:13] i want nothing less than that i bought
[35:15] another ephesians
[35:16] i don't want all messengers another
[35:18] ephesians on a bunch of people sitting

[35:47] or the devil is finished in ephesians
[35:50] whatsoever in ephesians oh give the lord
[35:53] a shout hallelujah praise god
[35:55] and ephesians rights obey their husbands
[35:57] in ephesians husbands love their wives
[35:59] what can the lord have shot over after
[36:01] ephesians we're going back to that
[36:03] we're going back to that and he teaches

[36:27] between participation
[36:30] [Music]
[36:31] [Applause]
[36:33] oh glory to god
[36:36] [Applause]
[36:38] my god you may be seated in this
[36:41] original championship
[36:42] match ephesians was caught heavyweight
[36:44] champions

[36:51] god's masterpiece

[37:03] that's a transformed man that's an

[37:07] there's a man back in the garden of eden
[37:09] then fellas went back into the academic
[37:11] anointing

[37:16] i gave he wasn't asking no bishop no no
[37:19] no no no ministers association
[37:21] permission to do anything
[37:22] peter was standing there alone he has
[37:24] said this was never done before anybody
[37:26] ever do this before
[37:27] if anybody he wasn't asking a question
[37:29] what was the precedent
[37:33] that my lawyers could be so miserable
[37:35] you could never go by president
[37:37] but when god said to do you think i'm
[37:38] not president this was never done before
[37:40] oh
[37:41] all right right right like the lawyers
[37:43] have talked about the case studies oh
[37:44] all right the law says so
[37:45] and 10 years ago and this judge says so
[37:48] and so but god hasn't do with that
[37:50] the president is still president doctors
[37:52] say what this case was never healed
[37:54] before
[37:54] and and when you're so bad in sickness
[37:56] you're on your way to the dead dead
[37:57] again one

[38:00] anybody coming from that that will
[38:01] doctors say
[38:02] that's not what god says we're breaking
[38:03] precedence we breaking what people
[38:05] understand breaking past the intellect
[38:07] you're breaking past the strong barrier
[38:09] you're breaking past your imagination
[38:10] your affection you've been past all of
[38:12] that
[38:12] you're bringing pastor all things are
[38:14] possible you want to know all things are

[38:23] good
[38:23] these signs shall follow not no pastor

[38:45] not that scripted not for them but then
[38:47] they believe that's you i'm talking
[38:49] about
[38:49] i am a believer you are a believer if we
[38:52] lay hands upon the sick they shall
[38:54] recover
[38:55] oh glory shall speak in new tongues
[38:57] that's not a pentecostal thing that is
[38:58] waiting oh give the lord a shout
[39:01] thomas get a bad name but that is our
[39:03] thing that is sin mark 16 in action
[39:06] we shall speak with new tongues glory to
[39:08] god hallelujah
[39:09] to speak in tongues tonight oh glory to
[39:12] god speak
[39:13] [Applause]
[39:20] [Music]
[39:23] and paul indicated that when the snake
[39:24] bit him and he shake the snake off
[39:27] and it's they didn't kill him he shake
[39:28] it off showing the power of the blood is
[39:30] more powerful than snake poison
[39:33] think about it now think about it the
[39:35] power of the blood of jesus
[39:36] is more powerful than snake poisoning
[39:41] [Applause]
[39:43] original church was a pentecostal church
[39:46] do we get that
[39:47] a pentecostal church filled with the
[39:49] holy ghost
[39:50] men and women led by the spirit of
[39:54] god not a man from somewhere
[40:00] by the spirit
[40:04] the thing was steven tell them you stiff
[40:06] neck are not circumcised he was a dick
[40:08] he was not preacher he said you do
[40:09] resist the holy ghost
[40:12] anointed yes led by god hallelujah
[40:16] man watch watch a pentecostal affair
[40:18] with the holy ghost
[40:19] men and women led by the spirit of god
[40:21] man couldn't leave that alone
[40:23] he wanted to hybrid the church so he
[40:26] bred the world with the theology
[40:28] doctrines and indonesia you see they
[40:29] could argue over that because they might
[40:31] talk to you better than your doctrine
[40:33] i agree with your doctrine that wasn't
[40:35] what god had in the beginning you know
[40:37] copenhagen because peter couldn't
[40:38] explain too much a doctrine
[40:40] because he was an unknown fisherman all
[40:43] he had was defeat
[40:45] [Music]
[40:46] that was delivered and the faith was
[40:49] jesus christ in him
[41:00] because the wisdom of god is right on
[41:02] the shoulder
[41:06] [Applause]
[41:16] so that is why gwadar to choose a man
[41:18] named saul flip him over and tell him to
[41:20] paul
[41:22] because he was in the enemy camp a soul
[41:25] so god doesn't do a fruit because
[41:26] god knows he needs an educated man
[41:28] together in them scriptures
[41:30] to break the old testament and reveal
[41:32] the new testament
[41:33] so he couldn't get peter to do that he
[41:35] had to find a hook no jesus educated man
[41:37] and learned the man but filled that
[41:40] little man with the holy ghost
[41:41] he's a holy ghost learned man not a
[41:44] learned man a holy ghost fell
[41:46] in man so when that fire burned into
[41:49] porsche
[41:50] paul went in the desert paulie consult
[41:53] no human being
[41:54] fire fight all around him you see in god
[41:57] and wrote the ten commandments
[41:58] such a right paul would get called
[41:59] revelation and paul said i know him by
[42:02] revelation
[42:03] i am with a little flesh i walk with
[42:06] jesus i have fish with jesus
[42:08] i have walked on galilee i see this i
[42:10] see that
[42:11] but i paul a prisoner of jesus christ i
[42:14] call an apostle to the gentiles well
[42:16] glory to
[42:17] god any man take himself to be spiritual
[42:20] let him acknowledge what i say
[42:22] is the commandments of the lord and if
[42:24] he believes he would let him be ignorant
[42:25] that's a man sent from god he could
[42:28] speak for god
[42:29] they could speak like god oh get the
[42:32] lord and shout him to her
[42:34] [Applause]
[42:40] so god could take paul flip him over
[42:43] hallelujah so paul was a double agent
[42:48] hallelujah satan thought he was working
[42:49] for him but he was always an agent of
[42:52] god
[42:53] hallelujah god had him like a sky and
[42:56] then paul said to say what
[42:57] you think you this and that i won't be
[42:59] full said this and early pharisees in
[43:00] the pharisees i
[43:01] i born in this and born in that and i
[43:03] call that a dumb amen
[43:05] i fully qualified to talk a lot to holly
[43:07] talking so you can't be no pharisees
[43:08] into me i am i was a pharisee of the
[43:10] pharisees
[43:11] i knew this thing well good man this
[43:13] flesh thing i know this thing
[43:14] i know this gun on this tall hat and all
[43:16] these rares and tears and what did i
[43:18] know about all of that
[43:19] it was seen i was pressing in the church
[43:21] don't talk to you talk
[43:22] i had zeal i was running them down but
[43:25] god had more seals for me man god sent
[43:28] fire to run me down
[43:29] and god threw me off my high horse oh
[43:31] glory to god now i know who he is
[43:34] and i know who i am oh glory to god give
[43:37] the lord a
[43:38] [Music]
[43:39] so don't shout up on anybody pray for
[43:42] them
[43:43] that the bloodhound will go after them
[43:45] the holy ghost will go after them pray
[43:47] for them
[43:48] we serve a living god a god that
[43:51] delivers a god that rescues a god that
[43:53] restores
[43:54] oh give the lord a shout you know what i
[43:56] said he is still a deliverer
[43:59] so you can be delivered tonight he can
[44:01] break the bands off of you
[44:03] and the weights are for your life that
[44:05] is what the gospel is for oh hallelujah
[44:08] praise god
[44:10] hallelujah i send them to the upper room
[44:12] to wait there
[44:13] until the holy ghost come upon them to
[44:15] be ordained ministers of the lord
[44:17] but hybrid and bringing the church into
[44:18] theology instead of letting the holy
[44:21] spirit lead it
[44:22] they bred in bishops general overseers
[44:25] when the holy spirit is god's original
[44:27] leader of the church they hybrid the
[44:28] church
[44:29] like the chicken they did the same with
[44:32] the mule
[44:33] they did the same with everything else i
[44:34] breathed making it different breeding in
[44:37] the world
[44:37] basketball games soup suppers bunker
[44:41] games what kind of things
[44:42] it's prettier bigger building polish
[44:44] nasa people singing is more orderly in
[44:46] the notes
[44:49] in the notes
[44:53] sometimes you're saying it's
[44:54] informational instead of inspirational
[44:58] we need more inspirational and
[45:00] informational
[45:02] because we have to get in the spirit oh
[45:04] glory to god hallelujah
[45:07] praise god the old fashioned pentecostal
[45:09] with tambourine and the guitar
[45:10] but it hasn't got the seed it hasn't got
[45:13] a ring to it
[45:15] life isn't right in breeding god wants
[45:18] it the way that he made it in the
[45:20] beginning
[45:20] so the church has been hybrid and now we
[45:22] come to a place where the church is more
[45:24] like a lodge
[45:26] any church here we go that left its
[45:28] original foundation has
[45:29] never been able to come over again
[45:33] i know people don't like this but this
[45:34] is the truth when god sent looter he had
[45:37] a revival
[45:38] he strapped the world but they organized
[45:40] it hydrated by the world
[45:41] and they produced a catholic church and
[45:42] when they did what did he do he produced
[45:44] a bunch of renegades
[45:46] hybrids never rose and never will rise
[45:48] along come john wesley same thing
[45:51] after the messenger gone the seven of
[45:53] god gone
[45:54] they hybrid it and that's it now here we
[45:57] go now let's take a tree of fate that
[45:59] eve taking of this forbidden tree of
[46:01] unbelief
[46:02] then we can make a text come out of it
[46:04] it was fate
[46:05] she disbelieved god's word god said that
[46:07] says everything will happen
[46:08] she ought to have left it alone she
[46:10] ought to have believed that the way god
[46:11] said it but no
[46:12] satan committed theology mixed it she
[46:15] gave it to adam it caused a hybrid fate
[46:19] it's our faith and it has
[46:22] hybrid faith and that's what the church
[46:25] so-called have
[46:26] a hybrid field it is mixed here we go
[46:28] are you ready
[46:29] this fate is mixed with fears dumps
[46:33] frustration if it was genuine faith it
[46:37] wouldn't move
[46:40] genuine faith would say god said so
[46:42] that's why the prophet said
[46:43] when a church is believing that the holy
[46:46] ghost
[46:47] is just as real as it was on the day of
[46:50] pentecost
[46:51] how they groan and cry but when they are
[46:54] born
[46:55] and positionally born then god sets in
[46:58] the church pastors
[46:59] teachers i know he hasn't been preached
[47:02] when they believe the holy ghost is just
[47:03] as real
[47:04] you don't want unless holy ghost they
[47:06] don't want a modern holy ghost
[47:07] you don't want that interpretation holy

[53:57] then he said well i wish my words were
[53:59] wrote with an iron pen
[54:01] stay with what god said it's the truth
[54:05] hybrid faith reads hebrews 13 it says
[54:07] jesus christ the same
[54:08] yesterday today and forever and when a
[54:11] hierarchy come and say well in a certain
[54:13] way
[54:17] in a certain way he's either the same or
[54:19] not the same
[54:21] if the same condition comes you have to
[54:22] act the same way he has to forgive the
[54:24] same way
[54:25] you have to heal the same way you have
[54:27] to raise the dead the same way
[54:28] devils have to cast out the same way
[54:30] because he's the same yesterday today
[54:32] and forever
[54:33] we have to prove that in this message it
[54:36] can't be god was with brother branham
[54:38] and where is god today no he's the same
[54:39] yesterday
[54:40] today and forever he is still a god of
[54:42] miracles
[54:43] but you have to believe in miracles you
[54:45] have to want a miracle
[54:46] you have to be expecting a miracle you
[54:48] have to be looking for a miracle
[54:49] america for your own soul for your own
[54:52] sight for your own body for your own
[54:53] spirit
[54:59] so i don't want you to be contented i
[55:02] want you to shake off that spirit of
[55:03] contentment
[55:04] but i will mess up the message of the
[55:05] day people say that where they passed
[55:07] outside here with the church time for
[55:08] the elders and the deacons everybody
[55:09] that go into a nice church and
[55:11] that nice word nice teachings and so on
[55:13] and they happy with the man
[55:16] but is god happy with him it's what
[55:18] happened with the church
[55:20] uh is the church back to ephesians what
[55:22] do we have this church
[55:24] that we exhorted and sharing thoughts
[55:26] every sunday every wednesday
[55:27] or do we see efficient as a vision
[55:30] that's my target then
[55:31] that's my goal then yeah i'm gonna be
[55:33] passionate corinthians but i want to be
[55:35] destination
[55:36] that you are passing through somebody
[55:38] passed you walk on different churches
[55:39] without your destination you passed to
[55:40] them
[55:41] because it wasn't entirely enough to
[55:42] what it's supposed to be but you have to
[55:44] see the vision of where it's supposed to
[55:46] be
[55:46] you say right the vision will make it
[55:48] plain it has to have a world vision
[55:50] a scriptural vision god planted an
[55:52] original seed
[55:54] where is that tree it had denominational
[55:57] brands grafted
[55:57] in and got keep cutting them out of
[55:59] cutting off and the tree kept pushing up
[56:01] pushing up pushing up
[56:02] but at the end another original branch
[56:06] will come forward will produce another
[56:09] original fruit
[56:10] because it's god's planting oh glowing a
[56:14] goddess hybrid faith
[56:16] plant them other seeds inside the deer
[56:18] but the original branch is pushing
[56:20] we want another pentecost people say we
[56:23] get it already
[56:24] that is them they are dry pentecost we
[56:27] don't want that
[56:28] prey because we're not saying that
[56:29] wonders we don't want that telling us
[56:31] with word word we don't want that
[56:33] we want the same thing we are returning
[56:37] to another ephesians
[56:40] oh give the lord a shout hallelujah
[56:45] [Applause]
[56:48] [Music]
[56:56] soul people figure i don't like mystery
[57:00] they feel like fighting history but
[57:03] christ is the mystery
[57:05] of god really if you want to show me the
[57:09] [Music]
[57:10] message
[57:15] but i see what kind of bad behavior and
[57:17] bad boy thing and
[57:18] gangster and thuggery you want to tell
[57:21] me is that mysteries behind that
[57:23] that is the mystery to me holy could
[57:25] preach mystery and be a thug
[57:28] how you can preach mystery and be so
[57:29] unchristian like
[57:31] that is a mystery to me hallelujah so i
[57:34] look to see what is the life behind the
[57:36] name
[57:37] i want to know what is it like behind
[57:38] the mystery oh glory to god i have
[57:41] nothing against mysteries that will
[57:42] become
[57:42] a mystery so i'll be against myself then
[57:46] i'm a mystery a hidden one too
[57:50] hallelujah you know you are hitting the
[57:51] street you know that brother was hidden
[57:53] in the seals
[57:54] paul irenaeus martin columba looted they
[57:56] were hit in no sea
[57:58] devil only seen red horse white or stay
[58:00] lost but behind all of that
[58:02] there were men of god standing behind
[58:04] there that the devil couldn't figure out
[58:06] [Applause]
[58:14] of the children to be turned literally
[58:18] back to the faith of the father
[58:22] and these seven tenders will do it
[58:25] turn their hearts back literally but
[58:28] what i realized it had to be translated
[58:31] oh glory to god whatever currency you
[58:33] know the currency is fit
[58:35] you can show god a prayer bible and say
[58:37] god because i have this in my hand
[58:39] uh you have to answer my prayer you're
[58:41] born to like to kind of like and expect
[58:42] god to answer you because you like to
[58:44] gather
[58:44] god's saying what is that god can't
[58:46] translate that that can't affect the
[58:48] kingdom two candles
[58:49] say to our father and treat mary that
[58:51] can't affect the kingdom
[58:53] god even hearing that you call it priest
[58:55] designer
[58:57] a man make that god can't even hear that
[59:00] a next man
[59:01] will come up to me temple and lord i am
[59:03] not like that man out there
[59:04] i paid twice i do this i do that today
[59:06] the man said oh you're not even going to
[59:08] church he will god i've always supported
[59:09] me as sinner
[59:10] jesus jesus said which one were
[59:12] righteous man on the outside
[59:14] he recognized he's a sinner this man is
[59:17] a sinner anointed not
[59:19] he attributed because of what he does to
[59:21] be righteousness
[59:22] and god watching attribute to what's in
[59:24] his heart
[59:25] so the confession of him to come in lord
[59:28] have mercy upon me god recognize that
[59:30] ahead of the mother man in tiny temple
[59:32] playing right just because he caught
[59:33] long
[59:34] and he got mad looking white god not
[59:37] looking at garment
[59:38] god looking at coat god looking at
[59:40] what's in the heart
[59:42] so it come back to our gospel in the
[59:44] heart and that's what peter got
[59:45] converted his heart got converted
[59:48] now the mind is he gave me to the soul
[59:50] the mind he channeled to get down to the
[59:51] womb of your spirit
[59:53] so it has to have a channel which is the
[59:54] mind that's where the word has to come
[59:56] first
[59:57] so of course there's always mental but
[59:59] it drops into spiritual
[1:00:01] it drops into the heart and it becomes a
[1:00:03] divine revelation
[1:00:05] that you actually possess oh glory
[1:00:08] you'll possess it when it dropped down
[1:00:10] inside of here it is yours
[1:00:12] and when it dropping inside of here
[1:00:13] there is no demon could go beyond there
[1:00:16] to take what
[1:00:17] god put in your heart and that's why the
[1:00:19] prophet said whatever your soul
[1:00:21] whatever the faith lead your soul to
[1:00:22] believe that is yours
[1:00:24] oh glory that you hear that once god
[1:00:27] leaves your soul
[1:00:28] your faith to believe it that is yours
[1:00:30] oh hallelujah praise
[1:00:32] god oh god you understand that
[1:00:35] so the woman with the blood issue there
[1:00:37] was no scripture saying if she touched
[1:00:38] me
[1:00:39] man she took that for herself she told
[1:00:41] herself that
[1:00:42] and it went so deep it went like a
[1:00:43] revelation into her spirit
[1:00:45] so she was convinced that if she only
[1:00:47] get there she'll be healed
[1:00:49] that's why she pushed it where she
[1:00:50] pushed if she was on this level when she
[1:00:53] see the crowd around jesus she came back
[1:00:54] and go back home
[1:00:55] but she said today is my day i ain't
[1:00:57] going nowhere
[1:00:58] some big big fella standing up there
[1:01:00] that end intimidating huh
[1:01:01] a bunch of men standing up there
[1:01:03] twiddling their bears and watching jesus
[1:01:04] okay
[1:01:05] he shall not do with that they don't
[1:01:06] believe nothing they only come to try to
[1:01:08] interpret the master
[1:01:10] but she come for a touch she said if i
[1:01:12] could touch him of his garment
[1:01:14] that's all she comes from she comes from
[1:01:15] her touch she has come to debate his
[1:01:17] words
[1:01:18] she'll come to question his words she'll
[1:01:20] come take a quote and debating thing
[1:01:22] abductional theology all she wants is a
[1:01:24] touch
[1:01:25] [Music]
[1:01:27] because she had a problem and she had a
[1:01:29] need and
[1:01:30] she needed a breakthrough and she pushed
[1:01:33] and she pressed
[1:01:34] you hear what happened something struck
[1:01:36] a heart and when something strike your
[1:01:38] heart that is how you could push and
[1:01:39] press
[1:01:40] if you just strike a hat you have no
[1:01:41] pushing and you have no person you're
[1:01:43] just thinking about it
[1:01:45] oh glory to god but once you strike your
[1:01:46] heart you say wait a minute you mean i
[1:01:48] could live higher than that
[1:01:49] wait a minute i could get a picture
[1:01:51] tonight wait a minute my home don't have
[1:01:53] to have that atmosphere
[1:01:54] i could change the atmosphere around my
[1:01:56] life i can live in a higher atmosphere
[1:01:59] and when you see that you could push now
[1:02:01] you can press now you can create the
[1:02:03] atmosphere now
[1:02:04] you can believe god now oh glory to god
[1:02:06] are you with me tonight
[1:02:08] hallelujah glory to god
[1:02:11] so what the bible teaches the new birth
[1:02:13] and the subject of handshakes
[1:02:15] everything else to the new birth but it
[1:02:16] can never take the place of the new book
[1:02:18] it's got to be an experience to be born
[1:02:20] again
[1:02:21] so the intellectuals said a new book is
[1:02:23] the revelation of jesus christ
[1:02:26] maybe what experience now there's a
[1:02:27] quote but the prophet said the new book
[1:02:29] is experienced
[1:02:30] so the question may ask which is first
[1:02:33] is it
[1:02:34] our experience or is it revelation those
[1:02:36] are the revelation and state with
[1:02:37] revelation alone
[1:02:38] the other people just our revelation so
[1:02:40] i'm born again
[1:02:41] but he said a new book got to be an
[1:02:43] experience
[1:02:44] something that you know a birth is a
[1:02:46] mess so what we say now the revelation
[1:02:48] come first experience come after
[1:02:50] supporting revelation and let go give
[1:02:52] you an experience that something has
[1:02:54] quickened in your life
[1:02:56] do you believe that hallelujah glory to
[1:03:00] god
[1:03:00] so watch abandon a baby is born we all
[1:03:02] know a buddhist is a mess when a baby is
[1:03:04] born
[1:03:04] if it's on the floor if it's on a shock
[1:03:06] pile if it's a pink decorative hospital
[1:03:08] it's a mess but it brings life
[1:03:10] and that is what the new bird is
[1:03:13] it's a mess hallelujah
[1:03:16] no no it's a mess it's a mess it's a
[1:03:19] mess
[1:03:20] but it brings life that's what a new
[1:03:22] word is it's a mess but it brings life
[1:03:24] and in style
[1:03:25] or put on or decoration that creeds is
[1:03:27] the bathroom they go so i will do
[1:03:29] believe the doctrine you have and i
[1:03:30] don't see it so much it'd be very
[1:03:32] different but what are they doing
[1:03:34] the new word means called blood start to
[1:03:36] flow inside of you
[1:03:37] the new word means that you are
[1:03:39] quickened to life
[1:03:40] the new word mean you are son and
[1:03:42] daughter of god then under the blood of
[1:03:44] jesus we can have fellowship
[1:03:45] because the blood of jesus covers you it
[1:03:47] covers me also
[1:03:49] isn't that right so watch now i know
[1:03:53] you get it from the altar crying on
[1:03:54] boohoo and squealing and slobbering it
[1:03:56] brother brings life
[1:03:57] it takes the stat out of you it makes
[1:03:59] you something you ought to be
[1:04:01] it takes all the world and stiffneck out
[1:04:03] of you isn't that right
[1:04:05] and that you said no watch i take jesus
[1:04:07] and my personal savior today we will
[1:04:09] come and say
[1:04:09] i take jesus for my personal savior
[1:04:12] listen to the
[1:04:12] ram that will never take the place of

[1:06:04] we are we said version 10 in version 10
[1:06:06] we find out
[1:06:07] the last messenger of the last age
[1:06:10] during the time of his prophecy
[1:06:12] that seven seas will be open the seven
[1:06:15] mysteries
[1:06:16] seven full mystery had been left off in
[1:06:18] every age had something left off the
[1:06:20] reformer didn't have time
[1:06:21] to take care of it there's a looter he
[1:06:22] preached justification by faith
[1:06:24] and he's gone and then come with
[1:06:26] representification knock on the
[1:06:27] pentecostal but we are promised
[1:06:29] according to version 10
[1:06:30] going to malachi 4 according to luke 17
[1:06:32] 20 there's a common ephesians to this
[1:06:35] that's the prophecy there's a common
[1:06:37] ephesians to this
[1:06:39] and that these seven four measures of
[1:06:40] the word must be unfolded
[1:06:42] and it's the loudest age where this
[1:06:44] takes place
[1:06:45] i believe we're in the shadow of the
[1:06:47] coming of the son of god and as joshua
[1:06:50] just before the ephesians raised up so
[1:06:51] that john the baptist raised up
[1:06:53] just before the next ephesians and we
[1:06:54] are promised another ephesians
[1:06:56] that's a promise that's that's the
[1:06:59] promise
[1:07:00] you heard what this promise not
[1:07:02] corinthians
[1:07:03] not hebrews not galatians ephesians is
[1:07:06] promised
[1:07:07] that's what you're looking for that's
[1:07:08] what you come in the church for you want
[1:07:10] the ephesians man of god to stand there
[1:07:11] in the pulpit
[1:07:12] one that have ephesians four is that
[1:07:14] right pastor teacher prophet
[1:07:16] that's what you want inside of here oh
[1:07:18] glory to god
[1:07:19] man harlem louisville manchester family
[1:07:21] got together the house of god
[1:07:23] that's great but division oh glory to
[1:07:25] mankate family or whatever it is how
[1:07:27] could we even take care of the house of
[1:07:28] god
[1:07:29] that could that could go good for
[1:07:31] corinthians but not divisions
[1:07:33] so when ephesians ministers are lined up
[1:07:34] with the word
[1:07:38] when that which is perfect has come that
[1:07:40] which is part is done over it
[1:07:42] well ephesians is that which is perfect
[1:07:44] so all this part preaching and path
[1:07:46] ministry and path this that is finished
[1:07:47] with
[1:07:48] when we come to ephesians so when you
[1:07:50] see it come to real ephesians
[1:07:52] ministers will have to sit down qualify
[1:07:55] for that level
[1:07:57] we're not even talking about being
[1:07:58] placed in the body and place a position
[1:08:00] but you know you talk about that we
[1:08:00] don't want ephesians coming back to that
[1:08:02] it has to be visions you know have to be
[1:08:04] the word standard
[1:08:06] the correct kind of deacons the correct
[1:08:07] kind of elders everybody have to stand
[1:08:09] up to it
[1:08:11] i tell you i'm the boss not that it's
[1:08:14] decisions
[1:08:15] all men jack line up with that
[1:08:20] it's not my standard it's god's standard
[1:08:23] in other words
[1:08:24] it's the plumb line when a man put the
[1:08:26] plumber you just hang it like that
[1:08:28] if you build them crooked it's crooked
[1:08:30] then you know the plumb line fault
[1:08:32] you can't bend the plumb line you just
[1:08:34] drop the plumb line
[1:08:35] the problem and show you how straight it
[1:08:37] is if it's crooked it will plummet will
[1:08:39] expose it
[1:08:40] because ephesians is the plumb line it
[1:08:43] has the original line
[1:08:44] that is the original word that we got
[1:08:46] for the original seed
[1:08:47] that's the god for the original life and
[1:08:50] incisions
[1:08:51] that's the plot line oh glory to god
[1:08:54] satan knows assuredly the original
[1:08:58] church
[1:08:58] was mark 16 in action always is false
[1:09:02] satan know the original church is the
[1:09:04] church with the power in it
[1:09:06] the lord himself went everywhere with
[1:09:08] them satan knows that
[1:09:10] we are coming back to that sin mark 16
[1:09:13] 20
[1:09:14] the lord himself went everywhere with
[1:09:15] them confirming the word with signs
[1:09:17] following
[1:09:18] oh glory to god we have to have a
[1:09:20] confirmation of the world that's being
[1:09:22] preached
[1:09:23] oh glory to god amen oh give the lord a
[1:09:26] shout
[1:09:27] oh this is going good tonight hallelujah
[1:09:30] hallelujah
[1:09:32] redemption isn't too bad coming out of
[1:09:34] and going into
[1:09:36] we came with a catholic or the methodist
[1:09:38] or the baptist but we got to go into
[1:09:39] ephesians
[1:09:40] come on come on come on now we come into
[1:09:43] the message
[1:09:44] but we have to go into ephesians
[1:09:46] [Applause]
[1:10:01] for a prophet talking about a certain
[1:10:02] prophet and elijah what that is good
[1:10:04] they commented the message by the
[1:10:06] message they get your division
[1:10:09] god sent moses to get israel out egypt
[1:10:12] was not from islam all right
[1:10:13] so you want to build a church in egypt
[1:10:15] that's you
[1:10:18] you might get egyptian name even pharaoh
[1:10:20] is a bigot
[1:10:21] says that sends some bricks for you but
[1:10:23] the promise is not egypt
[1:10:25] so when joseph they all died he said
[1:10:27] listen give me a pledge
[1:10:28] when you're leaving here not if when you
[1:10:31] leave
[1:10:32] don't leave my bones here take my bones

[1:10:35] because resurrection is in the promised
[1:10:36] land well where the rapture is
[1:10:39] is it efficient another wrapped in a
[1:10:41] current yet
[1:10:43] think about it now rapture is an
[1:10:46] ephesians
[1:10:47] you have to go into another ephesians to
[1:10:48] go in the rapture because that's where
[1:10:50] the faith is that
[1:10:52] and you have to have rapture and faith
[1:10:53] to be changed not hybrid faith
[1:10:56] rapturing faith that's why raptured
[1:10:58] hybrid fruit is evil
[1:11:00] it's god is a deceitful fate it makes
[1:11:03] people think because they believe the
[1:11:04] message they have arrived
[1:11:06] and that time they had their own journey
[1:11:08] they have to go normally ephesians
[1:11:10] and it's a battle to get there because
[1:11:12] he's jordan in front of you
[1:11:14] oh give the lord a shout o give the lord
[1:11:17] and shall be in the word tonight
[1:11:19] this is dossier the lord tonight this is
[1:11:21] the message
[1:11:23] who nobody want to cross jordan because
[1:11:25] the water is
[1:11:26] cold it's better cells is depth to what
[1:11:29] you think
[1:11:30] is depth to what you feel for the last
[1:11:32] 20 years

[1:11:36] new season's about to break upon us

[1:11:50] heavenly places in christ jesus oh we're
[1:11:52] going to strike it tonight we're gonna
[1:11:53] hit it you know
[1:11:54] this just gonna hit ephesians i was
[1:11:56] raised up for this
[1:11:58] i believe i was born for this we're
[1:12:00] going to hit another ephesians
[1:12:02] nobody could stop it nobody is hindering
[1:12:05] you
[1:12:05] nobody's hindering me it's just the fate
[1:12:09] that god said it we believe it
[1:12:12] that just settles it oh glory to god we
[1:12:16] are returning to another ephesians
[1:12:18] [Applause]
[1:12:20] tell the truth you may be seated
[1:12:23] hallelujah
[1:12:24] all them gossipers and whoever and bad
[1:12:27] mothers and whatnot and negative people
[1:12:29] inside of here tell them that
[1:12:30] when they start the negative telling you
[1:12:31] go back on ephesians and that can't
[1:12:33] survive in ephesians
[1:12:35] hallelujah tell them liars that can't
[1:12:37] survive any visions
[1:12:38] because the prophet said just as
[1:12:39] anastasia was judged in another
[1:12:41] ephesians it will have that same kind of
[1:12:43] judgment again
[1:12:44] because fire will be upon peter these
[1:12:46] men will be upon peter
[1:12:48] holy ghost discernment the anointing
[1:12:50] will be upon peter
[1:12:52] holy ghost hebrews 4 12 these
[1:12:55] thoughts and intents of the heart to
[1:12:56] return back into the church
[1:12:58] no liars are coming inside of there no
[1:13:00] evil workers coming they'll be exposed
[1:13:02] oh glory to god hallelujah because we're
[1:13:05] going back to another ephesians
[1:13:07] sin can't come in because we're going
[1:13:08] back to another ephesians
[1:13:10] ephesians being a church that even sin
[1:13:12] could come inside of it
[1:13:13] it'll be called out have to be repented
[1:13:15] of downstairs
[1:13:16] before they come upstairs oh glory to
[1:13:18] god of fire
[1:13:20] hanging over the building pillow of fire
[1:13:22] hanging in the church
[1:13:23] pillar of fire hanging in the pulpit
[1:13:26] kill our fire all around oh glory to god
[1:13:28] why we're going back to another
[1:13:30] ephesians angelic
[1:13:32] horse angelic visitations angel of lord
[1:13:35] and camping around those that fear him
[1:13:36] oh give the lord our praise we're going
[1:13:38] back to angels
[1:13:40] we're going back to angelic hosts we're
[1:13:42] going back to another ephesians
[1:13:43] going back to the supernatural all this
[1:13:46] ordinary natural thing supernatural
[1:13:48] where there is god there is supernatural
[1:13:51] you can't
[1:13:51] express god without the supernatural all
[1:13:54] this word
[1:13:55] word has got to be beyond the word
[1:13:57] hallelujah
[1:13:58] that's why paul said i come with
[1:14:00] preaching that your faith rests in the
[1:14:02] power of god
[1:14:03] i've got the wisdom of man oh hallelujah
[1:14:06] let's continue
[1:14:08] glory to god pray amen
[1:14:11] oh we on target tonight this is the
[1:14:14] world tonight
[1:14:15] let's continue redemption has two
[1:14:18] different parts come out of
[1:14:19] entering into first you have to come out
[1:14:22] of some people want to bring the world
[1:14:24] in with them
[1:14:24] but you got to come out of the world to
[1:14:26] enter into christ
[1:14:28] you've got to come out of unbelief to
[1:14:30] enter into faith
[1:14:31] there cannot be one thing in your way to
[1:14:33] really have
[1:14:34] genuine faith you must absolutely
[1:14:37] leave everything contrary to the word
[1:14:40] behind
[1:14:43] and this book of ephesians of the old
[1:14:45] testament is joshua
[1:14:47] and moses represent the law that could
[1:14:49] not save no one
[1:14:50] but grace could and joshua here it means
[1:14:52] jehovah savior
[1:14:54] and now we find out we have come to
[1:14:56] another ephesians
[1:14:57] where here we go in our intellectual
[1:15:00] denominations
[1:15:01] and all our educational programs has
[1:15:03] come to his jordan
[1:15:05] so now after 40 years of preaching and
[1:15:07] teaching and explaining and
[1:15:09] debating and exhorting it coming to an
[1:15:11] end
[1:15:12] where is the power say come down to our
[1:15:15] jordan
[1:15:16] amen we must then watch then watch
[1:15:19] watch in our intellectual denomination
[1:15:21] and so forth all our educational
[1:15:23] programs
[1:15:24] has come to jordan then we must have
[1:15:27] an ephesians again we must have an
[1:15:31] exodus to come out
[1:15:34] and go into for the rapture for what
[1:15:39] for what so ephesians is for the rapture
[1:15:43] then to go in the rapture you have to
[1:15:45] return
[1:15:46] to ephesians could we give the lord a
[1:15:49] shout
[1:15:50] how many of us stand out tonight how
[1:15:52] many see that tonight
[1:15:54] to go in the rapture you have to go to
[1:15:55] another season
[1:15:59] [Music]
[1:16:04] subs probably one of the greatest
[1:16:05] criticisms of the full gospel church is
[1:16:07] not positionally knowing what they are
[1:16:08] in christ jesus
[1:16:10] i always said i made two classes of
[1:16:11] people one of them is full gospel
[1:16:13] another
[1:16:14] fundamental fundamental knows where he's
[1:16:16] standing positionally only
[1:16:17] he's never been born again but he's head
[1:16:20] on point
[1:16:22] he mountain point he could talk on point
[1:16:25] everything is forget it you can't you
[1:16:28] can't get away from how he can explain
[1:16:29] it
[1:16:30] but he's not born again just fundamental
[1:16:33] teaching
[1:16:34] alone so he doesn't have any faith and
[1:16:37] if there's no faith of course you'll
[1:16:38] expect new miracles right no signs no
[1:16:41] powers no worship no anointing no
[1:16:43] nothing
[1:16:43] because the faith is not there or the
[1:16:45] understanding of who they are that's
[1:16:46] there
[1:16:47] but not the fate but watch so it's just
[1:16:51] and the full gospel has been born again
[1:16:53] but don't know where he stands
[1:16:55] now if i could get the full gospel
[1:16:56] pentecostal faith and the fundamental
[1:16:58] believers
[1:16:59] or the fundamental believers doctrine on
[1:17:01] the pillar of faith we have it made
[1:17:02] right it's like a man that can write a
[1:17:04] check but he hasn't have any money back
[1:17:06] you have a nice signature
[1:17:10] but you have no money so he
[1:17:13] you ever see a consignor
[1:17:17] the other man have money in the mark but
[1:17:18] he can't sign
[1:17:20] that's trouble you need to get the two
[1:17:22] together you won't have money and the
[1:17:23] signature
[1:17:24] i think everybody's smiling right now
[1:17:25] because that's what you want i want the
[1:17:27] same thing too i'm gonna have money in
[1:17:28] the bank
[1:17:33] okay so watch one got the money in the
[1:17:35] mouth they can't write a check they
[1:17:36] don't have to write the check
[1:17:37] you gotta want anybody but if you get
[1:17:39] those two together
[1:17:41] oh praise the name of the lord so buddha
[1:17:44] brown says
[1:17:44] if you put the life of jesus in the
[1:17:47] donut body of believers it would bear
[1:17:49] the same fruit the first one did
[1:17:50] they will write another book of acts
[1:17:52] behind them because they were the same
[1:17:54] life
[1:17:54] see what i mean you can't get away from
[1:17:56] it blind
[1:17:57] leaders of the mind god holds this key
[1:18:01] alone theologians can tell you it is not
[1:18:04] known it's hid from them
[1:18:06] they know nothing about it god here we
[1:18:09] go
[1:18:09] is known by simplicity and revelation of
[1:18:13] jesus christ
[1:18:14] to the most illiterate person not my
[1:18:17] theology
[1:18:18] is the revelation of jesus christ that's
[1:18:21] the spirit itself revealing
[1:18:23] that's why you come in the spirit that's
[1:18:25] why you're saying
[1:18:26] that's why you worship because in the
[1:18:28] spirit you could get defined revelation
[1:18:30] god making himself known by revelation
[1:18:35] but god doesn't own it make himself
[1:18:36] known by revelation he makes them known
[1:18:38] by manifestation also
[1:18:40] oh glory to god hallelujah upon
[1:18:43] historically my church
[1:18:45] no other rocks accepted no other schools
[1:18:47] accepted no nothing
[1:18:48] exactly the revelation of the jesus
[1:18:50] christ chewed a new world
[1:18:52] he is born in there he injects his own
[1:18:54] life your life is gone
[1:18:55] and the life of christ is projecting
[1:18:57] itself through you with the preeminences
[1:18:59] to the people
[1:19:00] and they see the very life one works to
[1:19:03] signs wonders that he did is doing
[1:19:07] through you
[1:19:08] are you ready outside of that the rest
[1:19:11] of it is not even called
[1:19:12] at all outside the death we've just said
[1:19:15] here
[1:19:16] call of duty says yes sir watch god's
[1:19:19] great revelation unfolding
[1:19:21] and yet he said this by lack of this
[1:19:23] revelation
[1:19:25] is why we have so many visions among us
[1:19:28] so much mockery so much division among
[1:19:30] us is because the people like that
[1:19:32] revelation
[1:19:33] they lack that revelation the teachers
[1:19:35] he said the teachers
[1:19:36] lack the revelation it is jesus christ
[1:19:39] himself being revealed again
[1:19:41] isn't that right so paul said i come
[1:19:44] among you
[1:19:45] and i thank brother george for this
[1:19:46] quote but not with the excellent your
[1:19:48] speech declaring to you the testimony of
[1:19:51] god
[1:19:51] i come in weakness and fear and much
[1:19:53] trembling and my preaching was not with
[1:19:55] enticing words of my wisdom
[1:19:57] but here we go in demonstration of the
[1:20:00] spirit
[1:20:01] and power you see
[1:20:05] there is the gospel go into the world
[1:20:08] and preach the gospel didn't say go
[1:20:10] teach
[1:20:11] so all this teaching place your
[1:20:13] positionally that is just part of it
[1:20:16] teaching places positionally that you
[1:20:18] could have the faith to receive the
[1:20:20] spirit
[1:20:23] he didn't say go and teach he said go
[1:20:25] preach
[1:20:26] in other words here we go get into that
[1:20:29] demonstrate the power
[1:20:32] these signs shall follow just teaching
[1:20:34] doesn't do it
[1:20:36] it takes the actual spirit itself
[1:20:38] demonstrating these signs
[1:20:40] remember the clients not teaching
[1:20:43] teaching alone can't do it
[1:20:45] so all this teaching and teaching four
[1:20:46] hours teaching teaching three hours
[1:20:48] teaching teaching ten hours teaching
[1:20:50] teaching that alone can do it
[1:20:52] it will take the spirit oh glory to god
[1:20:57] and how you're getting that no you're
[1:20:58] gonna cry for it you're going to pray
[1:21:00] for it
[1:21:01] you're going to call on god for it
[1:21:03] you're going to get in the spirit of it
[1:21:05] it will take the spirit there has to be
[1:21:07] a transitioning
[1:21:08] into the spirit realm in this message
[1:21:11] and we are going nowhere the raptor no
[1:21:14] intellectual thing if it doesn't be so
[1:21:15] we should be in rapture ready
[1:21:18] if the rapturous books and death we
[1:21:19] should have been long gone because we
[1:21:21] all in this thing now
[1:21:23] oh glory to god be green in this thing
[1:21:25] now oh glory to god we're still here
[1:21:28] it will take up power so he said when
[1:21:30] the power of this church rises
[1:21:32] it will bring the brethren when the
[1:21:34] power of that church rises
[1:21:36] it will bring the brethren oh he said
[1:21:38] national force put the church
[1:21:39] in the world come to the churches but
[1:21:41] the power of god will put the people in
[1:21:43] the bride
[1:21:44] okay the lord i shall feel anointed
[1:21:46] tonight i feel inspired tonight
[1:21:49] because it will take the power of god
[1:21:51] not a mighty teacher
[1:21:53] the power of god not the mighty apostle
[1:21:56] the power of god that the mighty
[1:21:58] evangelist the power of god
[1:22:00] that the mighty pastor the power of god
[1:22:03] not the mighty prophet the power of god
[1:22:06] it will take the power to put you inside
[1:22:08] of the earth
[1:22:08] we need power oh lord send the power
[1:22:11] just now
[1:22:12] and baptize everyone
[1:22:14] [Applause]
[1:22:19] teaching alone wouldn't do it
[1:22:25] i'm done done i don't know it i have a
[1:22:28] few more things
[1:22:29] oh musicians come and play oh god
[1:22:32] teaching alone won't do it
[1:22:33] it will take the power and demonstration
[1:22:36] oh glory could you imagine that
[1:22:38] we come and service 15 minutes of this
[1:22:40] man don't preach
[1:22:42] what do you waste your time for not not
[1:22:44] the goal of 50 minutes ago
[1:22:46] before god knows that
[1:22:47] [Music]
[1:22:49] so how he got perfectly sick
[1:22:52] sometimes sick service people are sick
[1:22:54] that might take a hour
[1:22:56] praying for sick people i could see
[1:22:58] crippled coming inside of here i could
[1:22:59] see
[1:22:59] lame walking i could see blind singing
[1:23:02] god have to demonstrate his power
