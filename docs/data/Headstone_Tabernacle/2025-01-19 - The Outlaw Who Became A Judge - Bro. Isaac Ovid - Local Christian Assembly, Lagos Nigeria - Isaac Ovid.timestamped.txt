[54:49] and the church
[54:50] says amen amen and amen before you take
[54:53] your seats if we could just turn to two
[54:56] portions of
[54:57] scripture then I'll do the greetings so
[55:01] let's read from Jeremiah 1 I'm reading
[55:04] Verses 4 and five and we also be going
[55:08] to the book of
[55:09] Hebrews Hebrews 11 very familiar
[55:14] scriptures Jeremiah 1 and reading verse
[55:16] 4 then the word of the Lord came unto me
[55:19] saying before I formed thee in the belly
[55:21] I knew thee Hallelujah and before thou
[55:23] camest forth out of the womb I sanctify
[55:26] thee thee and I ordain thee a prophet
[55:28] unto the
[55:30] Nations reading Hebrews 11 from verse 1
[55:34] now Faith is the substance of things
[55:36] hoped for the evidence of Things Not
[55:39] Seen for by it the elders obtained a
[55:42] good
[55:43] report through faith we understand that
[55:46] the worlds were framed by the word of
[55:48] God so that things which are seen were
[55:51] not made of things which do appear by
[55:54] faith Abel offered unto God among
[55:56] excellent sacrifice than Cain by which
[55:58] he obtained witness that he was
[56:01] righteous God testifying of his gifts
[56:04] and by it he being dead yet speak it by
[56:06] faith Enoch was translated that he
[56:08] should not see death and was not found
[56:10] because God had translated him for
[56:13] before his translation he had this
[56:15] testimony that he pleased God but
[56:17] without faith it is impossible to please
[56:20] him for he that cometh to God must
[56:22] believe that he is and that he is a
[56:24] rewarder of them that diligently seek
[56:26] him let's go down to verse
[56:29] 3030 by faith the walls of Jericho fell
[56:32] down after they were compassed about
[56:34] seven days by faith the har of Rahab
[56:37] perished not with them that believe not
[56:39] when she had received the spies with
[56:41] peace and what shall I more say for time
[56:45] would fail me to tell of Gideon and of
[56:47] Barack and of Samson and of jeffa of
[56:50] David also and Samuel and of the
[56:52] prophets who through faith subdued
[56:54] kingdoms wrought righteousness of
[56:56] obtained promises stopped the mouths of
[56:58] lions quenched the violence of fire
[57:01] escaped the edge of the sword out of
[57:03] weakness were made strong waxed Valiant
[57:06] in fight turned to flight the armies of
[57:09] the aliens women received their dead
[57:11] raise to life again and others were
[57:13] tortured not accepting Deliverance that
[57:16] they might obtain a better Resurrection
[57:19] others had trial of cruel mockings and
[57:21] scourgings ye moreover of bonds and
[57:24] imprisonment they were toned they were
[57:27] sown aunder were tempted were slain with
[57:29] the sword they wandered about in sheep
[57:32] skins and goat sins being destitute
[57:34] Afflicted tormented of whom the world
[57:37] was not
[57:38] worthy that's a powerful statement in
[57:41] other words the world was not worthy to
[57:42] contain these men the world was not
[57:45] worthy to contain them so they were
[57:46] living in the world but the world was
[57:48] not worthy of them because they were
[57:49] from another place and I believe this
[57:51] morning we are speaking to Sons and
[57:52] Daughters of God of whom this world is
[57:54] not even worthy you what trials have you
[57:57] find you has not even be this world is
[57:59] not worthy for you can the church say
[58:01] Amen of whom the world was not worthy
[58:03] they wandered in deserts and in
[58:04] mountains and in dens and caves of the
[58:06] earth and these all having obtained a
[58:08] good report through faith received n the
[58:11] promise God having provided some better
[58:13] thing for us that they without us should
[58:16] not be made perfect may the Lord add a
[58:18] blessing to the reading of his word you
[58:19] may be seated hallu
[58:32] so I bring greetings to you this morning
[58:33] in the precious name of our Lord and
[58:35] Savior Jesus Christ it is certainly a
[58:37] great privilege and an honor to be here
[58:39] in Lagos once again I feel at home I
[58:42] have been a part of this church for a
[58:44] very long time so it's good to be home
[58:46] it's good to be in the house of the Lord
[58:48] and I bring greetings from Trinidad and
[58:50] Tobago from The Headstone Tabernacle
[58:52] from Brother ID sister ID the ministry
[58:55] at headstone t tacle we love you very
[58:57] much we appreciate you very much I want
[58:59] to thank brother Olu for the opportunity
[59:02] to stand before the purchase of the
[59:03] blood of Jesus Christ and we certainly
[59:06] salute him and appreciate him for his
[59:07] stand uh in such a time as this I really
[59:10] appreciate the specials the Sunday
[59:12] school special that was really really a
[59:14] blessing and Sister Mary I think it's
[59:17] the first time I'm hearing Sister Mary
[59:18] sing Sister Mary God bless you thank you
[59:20] for the special and the choir truly a
[59:24] blessing amen we are happy to be here in
[59:28] the house of God in such a time as this
[59:30] you know the prophet told us that one
[59:32] day the last song Will Be Sung one day
[59:35] we'll have the last service and there's
[59:38] coming a time when we I believe we are
[59:39] close to having the last service because
[59:41] the whole objective of this great gospel
[59:43] was not to for us to build churches or
[59:45] have church Gatherings it's to bring us
[59:46] to Perfection it's bring us to a
[59:48] manifestation of the sons of God and I
[59:50] believe as we are nearing The Headstone
[59:53] we are coming to see a super Church a
[59:55] super race a church on fire a church on
[59:57] the power of God and a church where
[59:59] there are individuals who could stand
[1:00:01] alone when nobody else is around them
[1:00:03] because there's a seed in their soul
[1:00:05] that speaks that speaks for them that
[1:00:07] comes from God and goes back to God can
[1:00:08] the church say Amen so I'm excited for
[1:00:11] what God is doing what God has done and
[1:00:14] what God is about to do and I believe
[1:00:16] that we are so privileged to be called
[1:00:18] in such a time as this to be seeing what
[1:00:20] we see and to be hearing what we hear
[1:00:23] and yes there are trials and yes there
[1:00:25] are problems and and it seems sometimes
[1:00:27] that there are more trials and more
[1:00:28] problems than we ever expected to
[1:00:30] encounter but these are the trials and
[1:00:32] the testings and the problems that are
[1:00:33] preparing us to leave here God has got
[1:00:36] to give us a reason to call more for him
[1:00:38] God has got to give us a reason to
[1:00:40] depend on him some more a reason to
[1:00:42] trust in him some more can the church
[1:00:45] say
[1:00:46] Amen blessed be the name of the Lord so
[1:00:49] I have a title this morning the
[1:00:53] outlaw who became a judge
[1:00:57] and an inspiration the Divine mystery of
[1:01:00] your spiritual identity Hallelujah the
[1:01:03] outlaw who became a judge and an
[1:01:06] inspiration the Divine mystery of your
[1:01:08] spiritual identity and you know one of
[1:01:11] the thing I love about God is God loves
[1:01:13] to take broken people my God hallelujah
[1:01:16] and use broken people amen for some
[1:01:19] reason God doesn't like to look at the
[1:01:21] people who look like they're okay he
[1:01:22] likes to find the people who are looking
[1:01:24] like they're in a real struggle and take
[1:01:27] them to show the devil he could take
[1:01:28] anybody and use them to do anything he
[1:01:31] wants to do Hallelujah I preached some
[1:01:33] years ago when you look at the genealogy
[1:01:35] of God in Matthew 1 he could have chosen
[1:01:38] anybody but he choose the Harlot Rahab
[1:01:40] to pass through can the church say amen
[1:01:43] he could have choose Sister Sarah or
[1:01:45] sister Mary but he went to find a
[1:01:46] prostitute to show that he could include
[1:01:49] anybody he wants into the economy of God
[1:01:52] it doesn't matter their history it
[1:01:53] doesn't matter their lineage it doesn't
[1:01:56] matter their DNA it doesn't matter who
[1:01:58] their grandfather was who their father
[1:01:59] was whether they had money or no money
[1:02:02] if God wants to use you he doesn't need
[1:02:04] anybody's permission the sovereignty of
[1:02:07] God allows him to choose who he wants to
[1:02:10] use and use them the way he wants to use
[1:02:12] them isn't God good he could take
[1:02:15] somebody who's tall somebody who is
[1:02:17] short somebody from the east of Nigeria
[1:02:19] or the west of Nigeria he can take
[1:02:21] somebody from America or he can take
[1:02:23] them from Brazil God doesn't have to ask
[1:02:25] permission to give you the Holy Ghost he
[1:02:27] doesn't have to ask permission to fill
[1:02:30] you he doesn't have to ask permission to
[1:02:32] deliver you he doesn't have to ask per
[1:02:34] Mission because he's
[1:02:36] Sovereign and that's the mystery of your
[1:02:39] spiritual identity we read the scripture
[1:02:42] in Jeremiah before you even born there
[1:02:45] was a purpose over your life uh your
[1:02:47] purpose didn't start when you were born
[1:02:49] your purpose sat before you were even
[1:02:51] here your purpose was already written
[1:02:54] you are walking in the story of your
[1:02:58] purpose glory to God and because of your
[1:03:01] purpose God put you in a family
[1:03:04] Hallelujah and he listen God designed
[1:03:07] your family for your
[1:03:10] purpose he design your trial for your
[1:03:13] purpose he designed everything you go
[1:03:16] through to make sure that you are here
[1:03:17] this morning you couldn't miss this
[1:03:20] service if you wanted to you couldn't
[1:03:21] miss this message if you wanted to you
[1:03:23] couldn't miss this call if you wanted to
[1:03:26] whatever you tried to do had to bring
[1:03:28] you to this spot bring you to this
[1:03:30] experience can the church say
[1:03:32] [Applause]
[1:03:39] Amen in the message Christ is a Myster
[1:03:41] of God revealed and M laying background
[1:03:44] we're going to have a bit of a Sunday
[1:03:45] school if that's okay is this is is that
[1:03:48] all right a little bible study in the
[1:03:51] message Christ is the mystery of God
[1:03:53] revealed brother Bram said now God had a
[1:03:55] purpose and a hidden Mystery and that's
[1:03:57] what I want to speak on to the church
[1:03:59] this morning the hidden Mystery of God
[1:04:01] that he had in his mind before the world
[1:04:03] ever began and how it's unfolded itself
[1:04:06] right down to this present hour that
[1:04:08] we're living in that you will understand
[1:04:10] very clearly I believe what is being
[1:04:12] done can the church say amen and I've
[1:04:14] said it many times God is a mystery the
[1:04:17] world is a mystery and this mystery of
[1:04:19] God was so big that God had to unfold
[1:04:21] this mystery over multiple Generations
[1:04:23] uh he couldn't just give it in one
[1:04:25] because he was too big he was too
[1:04:27] powerful this Bible oh my only contains
[1:04:31] part of who he is he said those things
[1:04:33] which are revealed they belong to us but
[1:04:35] the secret things belong unto God they
[1:04:37] are aspects of God that we are only
[1:04:39] coming to now realize but reality is
[1:04:42] this God is a mystery and he existed
[1:04:44] alone we know this he wanted to express
[1:04:47] himself uh because he is omnipotent he
[1:04:49] is omnicient he is all powerful he is
[1:04:52] bigger than our problems he's bigger
[1:04:54] than our situations uh he's Jehovah Gyra
[1:04:56] Jehovah nii Jehovah shama Jehovah situ
[1:04:59] he is El Shai he is the breasted one
[1:05:01] he's a everpresent helping time of
[1:05:03] trouble he is I am that I am he is Alpha
[1:05:06] and Omega he's the beginning and the end
[1:05:08] he's the first and the last he's the
[1:05:10] fairest of 10,000 he's a lily of the
[1:05:12] valley he's a bright and Morning Star
[1:05:15] there's no one like him there was no one
[1:05:17] before him like him there'll be no one
[1:05:19] after him like him he is God all by
[1:05:21] himself he doesn't need help to be God
[1:05:23] he is just God and he is the object of
[1:05:26] our worship Our Praise doesn't make him
[1:05:28] God he is
[1:05:30] [Applause]
[1:05:33] God he could do what he wants he is
[1:05:36] Sovereign he could heal you while this
[1:05:38] service is happening he could deliver
[1:05:40] your son while you are here your
[1:05:42] presence
[1:05:44] here can change what's happening in your
[1:05:51] home but God never wanted to remain a
[1:05:53] mystery
[1:05:58] this mystery is so great I'm just laying
[1:05:59] a foundation to get to my text he didn't
[1:06:01] want to be complicated you don't need a
[1:06:04] degree to understand
[1:06:06] him you don't need to be an engineer to
[1:06:08] understand him you don't need to be a
[1:06:10] doctor to understand them he's a
[1:06:12] uncomplicated God he wanted anybody to
[1:06:16] talk to him and you could reach him at
[1:06:18] any time you don't need a good Network
[1:06:20] to reach him you don't need electricity
[1:06:22] to reach him you don't need money in
[1:06:24] your bank to reach him you don't need to
[1:06:25] line up to reach him you don't need to
[1:06:27] ask permission to reach him you could
[1:06:29] reach him at any time Jesus on the main
[1:06:32] line you could tell him what you want if
[1:06:34] you need a holy ghost you could tell him
[1:06:37] what you want can the church say
[1:06:40] Amen I'm just testing the
[1:06:44] temperature I'm just making sure brother
[1:06:47] Jesse I'm just making sure I'm in
[1:06:50] church because the pist David I was glad
[1:06:53] when they said unto me let us go into
[1:06:55] the house of the Lord hallelujah you got
[1:06:57] to realize when you come into the house
[1:06:59] of God you leave everything on the
[1:07:04] outside listen what is to happen in the
[1:07:07] world is going to happen you know but we
[1:07:09] in the bride we are are the ones to
[1:07:11] determine the course of history
[1:07:13] determine the next steps can the church
[1:07:15] say
[1:07:16] [Applause]
[1:07:18] Amen you may be
[1:07:20] seated when David was living when Moses
[1:07:24] was living when when Abraham was living
[1:07:27] they did not even understand exactly
[1:07:29] what they were living
[1:07:30] out it is only years later we could look
[1:07:33] back and we could understand what part
[1:07:35] of the mystery they were actually
[1:07:37] unfolding and what piece of the puzzle
[1:07:39] they actually fit
[1:07:41] into it is impossible many times when
[1:07:44] Joseph was in prison he wasn't thinking
[1:07:46] that this is the best place to
[1:07:49] be but only when we look back we can see
[1:07:52] the type of prison to power can the
[1:07:54] church say amen when Jonah was in the
[1:07:57] belly of the fish he wasn't happy to be
[1:07:59] there but when Jesus come he could tie
[1:08:01] himself to as Jonah was in that
[1:08:04] situation so shall can the church say
[1:08:07] Amen so you got to realize your trial
[1:08:10] your family situation it's by design it
[1:08:13] is God's purpose uh that you get the
[1:08:16] Holy Ghost that you come to adoption
[1:08:18] that you come to Perfection that seven
[1:08:20] Living Voices will come from inside of
[1:08:22] your life that's the Thunder
[1:08:26] thank you that shakes the
[1:08:35] devil you may be
[1:08:37] seated I haven't
[1:08:43] sat I want to get to but I just want to
[1:08:45] just kind of lay a
[1:08:47] foundation so when Joshua walked the
[1:08:49] Earth he was explain the attribute of
[1:08:52] the warrior in God when Elijah walked
[1:08:54] the Earth he was explain the attribute
[1:08:56] as a prophet when Paul that was an
[1:08:58] apostle but every single piece was
[1:09:00] coming together for this great mystery
[1:09:02] of
[1:09:03] God and that mystery is tied to your
[1:09:06] identity because it's very easy when we
[1:09:08] get into trouble when we get into a
[1:09:10] situation we are not in the presence of
[1:09:12] church and we are in our jobs or we're
[1:09:14] in the neighborhood or we are in the
[1:09:16] taxi or whatever that looks like that we
[1:09:18] sometimes forget who we
[1:09:20] are and that is tied to your spiritual
[1:09:24] identity and understanding your
[1:09:26] spiritual
[1:09:28] identity you may be seated what is your
[1:09:34] identity by definition identity is the
[1:09:37] fact of being who or what a person or
[1:09:40] thing is it is the distinguishing
[1:09:43] character or personality of an
[1:09:47] individual there are some people when
[1:09:49] they shout a certain way without you
[1:09:51] having to look back you know who's
[1:09:53] shouting that's right
[1:09:57] Hallelujah and I I I I don't think but
[1:10:00] the cosos is here but but the cosmos has
[1:10:01] a way that he says yeah yeah yeah yeah
[1:10:04] and and when you hear that you don't
[1:10:06] need to look around to know he's in the
[1:10:08] building because that's part of his
[1:10:10] identity can I anybody in the house this
[1:10:12] [Applause]
[1:10:17] morning your identity who you are your
[1:10:20] characteristics your ability your nature
[1:10:23] your potential your real izations your
[1:10:26] achievements your failures your
[1:10:28] victories your ups and downs is all tied
[1:10:30] to your
[1:10:32] identity they are skills that you
[1:10:34] possess that nobody on the earth
[1:10:36] possesses and it's part of your
[1:10:40] identity what God put in you he didn't
[1:10:42] put in a person next to you because he
[1:10:45] wanted that to be a part of your
[1:10:48] [Applause]
[1:10:54] identity you identity is the real you
[1:10:57] your identity is beyond your physical
[1:11:01] appearance if you were to go tomorrow
[1:11:03] and do plastic surgery if brother Cosmos
[1:11:06] forgive me I use me example were to go
[1:11:07] and change his face when he comes back
[1:11:09] to church and you hear the you say
[1:11:12] that's still
[1:11:16] him can the church say Amen so you could
[1:11:20] try to change your face you could try to
[1:11:22] change your school you could try to
[1:11:23] change your home but who you are is
[1:11:25] still who you are can the church say
[1:11:27] Amen your bank account is not your
[1:11:30] identity your job is not an
[1:11:32] [Applause]
[1:11:35] identity can the church say
[1:11:37] Amen before you are an accountant you
[1:11:40] are a priest before you are an engineer
[1:11:43] you are a priest before you are a doctor
[1:11:45] you are a priest before you go to work
[1:11:48] you are priest first everything else
[1:11:50] after you are royal
[1:11:53] priest that's your identity that's why
[1:11:57] we worship that's why we pray that's why
[1:12:00] we come to church because we are part of
[1:12:02] a royal
[1:12:04] [Applause]
[1:12:06] priesthood can the church say amen
[1:12:09] that's why we have faith that's why we
[1:12:11] shout and because it's who we are you
[1:12:14] can't help your identity can the church
[1:12:17] say Amen
[1:12:21] am you may be seated
[1:12:25] amen I've used the example in the UK the
[1:12:29] royal family Prince Harry Prince William
[1:12:32] whatever they are when they are born
[1:12:34] they don't know who they are but the
[1:12:37] moment they are born there's security
[1:12:38] assigned to them there's property and
[1:12:40] title there's an inheritance assigned to
[1:12:43] them before they could even speak they
[1:12:44] have an inheritance you don't hear me
[1:12:46] this morning before they could even
[1:12:48] creep there's a car with their name on
[1:12:51] [Music]
[1:12:53] it before they can feed them themselves
[1:12:56] they have restaurants that they can eat
[1:12:57] for free for the rest of their lives
[1:12:59] it's tied to their
[1:13:01] identity and you got to know your
[1:13:04] identity I don't care what you have now
[1:13:06] your identity is bigger than what you
[1:13:09] have
[1:13:13] now your identity is bigger than your
[1:13:16] problem can the church say Amen Give the
[1:13:19] Lord a shout of praise
[1:13:21] [Applause]
[1:13:34] Hallelujah brother the chick boo we
[1:13:36] about 95% there just testing the
[1:13:41] temperature brother brandham said in the
[1:13:43] deity of Jesus Christ that's right men
[1:13:44] and woman it's time that we found out
[1:13:47] who you are the devil is trying to hide
[1:13:50] you
[1:13:50] back so if the devil could keep you
[1:13:53] trapped in the
[1:13:55] economy trapped in the problems listen
[1:13:58] we can spend a lot of time talking about
[1:14:00] the problems but I prefer to ask
[1:14:02] questions about how does God's economy
[1:14:04] work because they are principles to his
[1:14:06] economy I don't have money for the
[1:14:08] doctor but the great physician how do I
[1:14:10] get to the Great physician I don't have
[1:14:13] money for surgery but the great
[1:14:15] physician is able to perform surgery
[1:14:18] even so much he said missing limbs will
[1:14:21] be restored I don't know any doctor in a
[1:14:25] America Nigeria or Europe who could put
[1:14:27] a missing limb back but a great
[1:14:31] [Applause]
[1:14:37] physician he is more than able to open
[1:14:40] the blind eyes the prophet said before
[1:14:43] the doctor hand touches my wife in other
[1:14:45] words before they even do surgery before
[1:14:47] the doctor's hand touches my wife that
[1:14:49] tomb has got to go down can the church
[1:14:51] say amen and that same Jesus that same
[1:14:55] angel that same Holy Ghost is here this
[1:14:58] [Applause]
[1:15:04] morning that's right men and women it's
[1:15:08] time that be found out who you are the
[1:15:11] devil is trying to hide you back tell
[1:15:14] you that you're some little cow down
[1:15:15] something you're not you're Sons and
[1:15:17] Daughters of God listen to The Prophet
[1:15:20] the deity is not in heaven it's in you
[1:15:25] that's a big one he said the deity is
[1:15:27] done in heaven it's in you greater is he
[1:15:30] that's in you than he that's in the
[1:15:32] world greater is he that's in you than
[1:15:34] he that's in your job greater is he
[1:15:36] that's in you than what's in the
[1:15:37] doctor's report greater is he that's in
[1:15:39] you than what's happening with your son
[1:15:41] this morning greater is he that's in you
[1:15:43] that's bigger than the problem with your
[1:15:45] daughter this morning we serve notice
[1:15:48] every back seting young person is going
[1:15:50] to be restored we speak it we declare it
[1:15:54] we claim it so shall it
[1:15:56] [Applause]
[1:16:07] [Music]
[1:16:09] [Applause]
[1:16:12] be brother brand in this same quote he
[1:16:15] said the deity is not in heaven it's in
[1:16:16] you Hallelujah he said I know you think
[1:16:19] I'm crazy but let me tell you something
[1:16:22] brother when you realize
[1:16:25] that almighty God lives in you immortal
[1:16:30] life my life I gave Zoe the life of God
[1:16:33] is in the human being can the church say
[1:16:37] Amen so your
[1:16:39] purpose is connected to who you are your
[1:16:44] destiny is connected to who you are you
[1:16:46] may be seated your ability is connected
[1:16:49] to who you are you may be
[1:16:52] seated so many young people say well
[1:16:55] I've worked so hard for what I have
[1:16:57] achieved all right but all the work you
[1:17:00] do if God didn't wake you up in the
[1:17:01] morning and give you the intellectual
[1:17:03] ability to read a book what did you
[1:17:06] really
[1:17:08] achieve no one can claim credit for what
[1:17:11] they achieved because it's the grace of
[1:17:13] God that allows us to do
[1:17:22] anything God doesn't want to sh his
[1:17:24] Glory with anybody he wants to get all
[1:17:27] the glory he wants to get all the praise
[1:17:30] can the church say Amen you may be
[1:17:32] seated
[1:17:35] it your ability to survive is because of
[1:17:39] who you are don't forget who you are do
[1:17:44] not forget your identity can of church
[1:17:49] say Amen you may be
[1:17:52] seated so I want to have a little
[1:17:55] Bible study with
[1:18:00] you and we read the
[1:18:03] scripture in
[1:18:05] Hebrews we didn't read all of it but it
[1:18:09] speaks to by Faith by Faith by faith
[1:18:11] very familiar scripture we should all be
[1:18:13] familiar with it by faith Enoch by faith
[1:18:16] Noah by faith Abraham It Goes On by
[1:18:18] faith Moses and all these different
[1:18:21] ones and the Bible says here in verse 32
[1:18:25] and what shall I say more for time would
[1:18:27] fail me in other words he said if I had
[1:18:30] more
[1:18:33] time this verse this chapter would never
[1:18:38] end because it's only because of time
[1:18:41] that I have to kind of pray see or
[1:18:43] shorten what is written here in other
[1:18:45] words if there was more time Hebrews 11
[1:18:47] would have been a longer
[1:18:49] chapter and I would like to believe
[1:18:51] brother Moses that if he had time and he
[1:18:54] could seem to day our names will be here
[1:18:56] also by faith brother Moses by faith
[1:18:59] brother Branham can the church say
[1:19:02] [Applause]
[1:19:04] Amen but what is amazing about Hebrews
[1:19:07] 11 is outside of Enoch that who we knew
[1:19:11] had a testimony that pleased God every
[1:19:14] single name in Hebrews 11 has a
[1:19:18] issue so Hebrews 11 is also a book of
[1:19:22] what we call the Heroes of Faith but
[1:19:23] every one of them had a
[1:19:26] issue who fail God here Samson name is
[1:19:29] there we know the story of Samson but by
[1:19:31] the time God looked through time and
[1:19:33] look through Samson mistakes and look
[1:19:36] through Samson failures nobody could
[1:19:39] remove Samson name from
[1:19:45] the Moses missed the promised land
[1:19:49] because of the way he dealt with the
[1:19:50] people with the water on the Rock but by
[1:19:52] faith Moses Moses is and there so I want
[1:19:56] to encourage you your mistakes your
[1:19:58] failures where you have fallen will not
[1:20:01] stop you from make it into your Hebrews
[1:20:04] 11 can the church Preach back to
[1:20:06] [Applause]
[1:20:08] me friends if God was not interested in
[1:20:13] covering your mistakes there'd be no
[1:20:15] need for
[1:20:18] blood if God wanted to hold your
[1:20:21] mistakes against you he would need a SE
[1:20:23] of forgetfulness but God made provision
[1:20:26] for your
[1:20:27] mistakes by having blood and a sea of
[1:20:30] forgetfulness so that when God looks
[1:20:32] through the blood he sees you perfect
[1:20:35] and when you try to bring up your sin to
[1:20:37] even him he say I can't remember it I
[1:20:39] can't remember because it's already
[1:20:41] under the blood it's in the sea of
[1:20:43] forgetfulness what you're talking about
[1:20:45] what you did last year I don't even know
[1:20:47] what you're talking about it's already
[1:20:50] in the sea of forgetfulness
[1:20:51] [Applause]
[1:20:55] [Music]
[1:20:57] listen it's only in church people
[1:21:01] remember but I thank God he's not
[1:21:04] judging us by our brother he's not
[1:21:05] judging us by our sister when God looks
[1:21:08] at us through the blood see your
[1:21:11] forgetfulness there is nothing against
[1:21:13] you you are going to be perfect you are
[1:21:15] going to be filled you are going to be
[1:21:17] adopted
[1:21:19] [Applause]
[1:21:30] you may be seated imagine almighty God
[1:21:34] forget what you did 10 years ago and
[1:21:36] some self-righteous brother want to hold
[1:21:38] that over your head as if they forgot
[1:21:40] that the same God that had mercy on you
[1:21:43] have mercy on them oh God help me this
[1:21:45] morning that's why I love Jesus that's
[1:21:47] why I love the Lord he is merciful he is
[1:21:50] gracious his mercy endureth forever
[1:21:55] can the church Give the Lord a shout of
[1:22:02] Praise You may be
[1:22:06] seated so this Hebrews
[1:22:08] 11 is a story of people
[1:22:13] who who have mistakes challenges
[1:22:17] failures but they live by
[1:22:20] fit the Bible says that without fit it
[1:22:23] is impossible
[1:22:27] to please
[1:22:28] God and fear looks at the Unseen or
[1:22:32] looks at the situation and makes
[1:22:33] declarations that many times go against
[1:22:37] what the eye can
[1:22:38] see so we are here in church and we have
[1:22:41] a lot of problems but by faith we know
[1:22:43] it's going to work
[1:22:45] out by faith we're going to be healed by
[1:22:49] faith our sons and daughters will be
[1:22:51] delivered by faith this sickness is
[1:22:53] going to be
[1:22:55] by faith this high blood pressure has
[1:22:57] got to become normal by faith this heart
[1:22:59] condition has got to be healed by by
[1:23:01] faith I'm going to receive the Holy
[1:23:02] Ghost by faith I'm going to possess this
[1:23:05] inheritance by faith I'm going to have a
[1:23:07] Revival by faith I'm going to get a
[1:23:09] better job by faith doors that have been
[1:23:12] closed will open up by
[1:23:15] faith we worship by faith we Shout by
[1:23:20] faith we talk to God by faith he said
[1:23:22] without faith it is impossible
[1:23:25] to please
[1:23:27] God can the church say
[1:23:30] [Applause]
[1:23:35] Amen so this verse in verse 32 that says
[1:23:37] and what shall I more see for the time
[1:23:40] would fail me to tell of Gideon and we
[1:23:42] have preached many messages about
[1:23:44] Gideon and of Barack some people know
[1:23:47] about
[1:23:49] Barack and of Samson most know about
[1:23:52] Samson and of jeffa
[1:23:55] and one day I was read like who is this
[1:23:58] jeffa because Samson is kind of
[1:24:02] obvious but I I said look who is jeffon
[1:24:05] because every scripture is for
[1:24:06] encouragement and every story is for
[1:24:09] inspiration so I said to look into who
[1:24:11] who who is jeffa because when I looked I
[1:24:13] say when Samson was you remember when at
[1:24:16] the time when Samson had to come the
[1:24:18] angel of the Lord went to his family and
[1:24:20] say you're going to have a child and and
[1:24:21] these things and and even Gideon an
[1:24:23] angel came to gide
[1:24:25] and many of us we say but no angel never
[1:24:26] came to me no angel went to my
[1:24:29] parents so I love when I find something
[1:24:32] in Scripture that I could connect to so
[1:24:35] when I start to look at Jeff I say
[1:24:36] there's something in this that I could
[1:24:37] relate to can the church say amen amen
[1:24:41] so let's go to
[1:24:42] judges 10 and we're going to start from
[1:24:45] verse 6 a little bible study this
[1:24:47] morning if that's all right today Sunday
[1:24:48] is the Lord's day we we here for the day
[1:24:50] right
[1:24:59] judges 10 and verse 6 and the children
[1:25:02] of
[1:25:03] Israel did Evil again in the sight of
[1:25:06] the Lord now judges as we know is the
[1:25:08] bridge between the Patriarchs which
[1:25:11] ended with Joshua as the tail end of it
[1:25:14] and the kings came after so judges is
[1:25:17] this period where the Bible said people
[1:25:19] did what was in their heart and God used
[1:25:21] a number of Judges starting with oel and
[1:25:24] Samson and Gideon and they're all in
[1:25:25] there but this is a particular point now
[1:25:27] the children of Israel did Evil again
[1:25:30] the operative word being again this is
[1:25:33] after Gideon Deliverance with the
[1:25:36] midianites because through the Book of
[1:25:38] Judges we see this cycle of going into
[1:25:42] idolatry going back into the world God
[1:25:45] helping to deliver them and for some
[1:25:46] reason people getting back into the
[1:25:48] world getting back into idolatry very
[1:25:51] much like what we see happening
[1:25:52] today people come and shout and jump in
[1:25:55] church they come to conventions and
[1:25:57] after a few weeks or a few months they
[1:25:59] get caught up in what's happening in the
[1:26:00] job and and the family and before you
[1:26:02] know
[1:26:03] it a
[1:26:06] cycle and AED evil again in the sight of
[1:26:10] the Lord and served and I want you to
[1:26:12] watch that word
[1:26:13] served because many time we we we talk
[1:26:16] about worship but serving is really
[1:26:19] worship and people don't realize that we
[1:26:21] really have only two main things to
[1:26:23] serve God
[1:26:25] with yes we could talk about our hands
[1:26:27] and our feet and all these things but
[1:26:28] you really serve god with your time and
[1:26:31] you serve god with your
[1:26:33] resources so here we see the children of
[1:26:36] Israel served
[1:26:38] bam it meant their time their resources
[1:26:41] their energy this is after having been
[1:26:43] delivered from Egypt this is after
[1:26:46] having seen Miracles this is after a
[1:26:48] repeated cycle of seeing God working for
[1:26:50] them they once again submitted
[1:26:53] themselves or yielded or serve the gods
[1:26:55] of their
[1:26:57] environment are you with me did Evil
[1:27:00] again in the sight of the Lord and serve
[1:27:02] balum and ASAT and the gods of Syria and
[1:27:06] the gods of sidon and the gods of Moab
[1:27:10] and the gods of the children of Ammon
[1:27:12] and the gods of the Philistines and
[1:27:13] forsook the Lord and served not him so
[1:27:17] it's not one not two not three this is
[1:27:19] the god of movies this is the god of
[1:27:22] Netflix this is anybody in the house
[1:27:25] [Music]
[1:27:28] it's as if they were looking to find
[1:27:29] another deity so they find a God here
[1:27:31] they find a thing here I can't make it
[1:27:33] to church I can't connect to the youth
[1:27:35] service I can't do this because all kind
[1:27:36] of
[1:27:37] different anybody with me in the
[1:27:41] [Applause]
[1:27:42] house and they forsook the Lord and
[1:27:45] served not him and the anger of the Lord
[1:27:48] was hot against Israel and he sold them
[1:27:50] into the hands of the Philistines and to
[1:27:52] the hands of the children of Ammon in
[1:27:53] other words whatever God they served
[1:27:56] became their
[1:27:57] oppressors I want to say to you Church
[1:28:00] whatever you serve will rule
[1:28:03] you you serve God he will take that's
[1:28:05] why Paul could say I'm a prisoner of
[1:28:07] Jesus Christ he was happy to be a
[1:28:09] prisoner of the Lord but whatever you
[1:28:11] serve will rule you whatever you serve
[1:28:14] will control you can the church say
[1:28:19] amen and the anger of the Lord was hot
[1:28:22] against Israel and he saw them into the
[1:28:23] hands of the the Philistines and at the
[1:28:25] hands of the children of Ammon and that
[1:28:27] year they vexed and oppressed the
[1:28:29] children of Israel 18
[1:28:33] years now when I read this as like 18
[1:28:36] years you mean after year one they were
[1:28:37] not upset with it after year two of
[1:28:40] Oppression you wouldn't say well Lord
[1:28:41] are coming
[1:28:42] home after 5 years Lord are ready to
[1:28:45] come back to church you know but for 18
[1:28:48] years they were under oppression it took
[1:28:50] 18 years for him to say enough is enough
[1:28:53] and I say back home Sometimes some of us
[1:28:55] haven't had enough
[1:28:57] pain to bring us back to God in other
[1:29:00] words they were serving false god and
[1:29:02] they did it for one year 2 years 3 years
[1:29:05] 4 years 5 years they are not happy they
[1:29:07] are under pressure they are under
[1:29:09] oppression but the pain doesn't seem to
[1:29:11] be enough to say Lord I want to come
[1:29:13] back to the altar could somebody pray
[1:29:14] for me it took 18 years to say enough is
[1:29:18] enough I don't want to do this anymore I
[1:29:21] want to encourage you Church don't wait
[1:29:23] so long to Get Your Heart Right with God
[1:29:25] don't wait until your arm broken and
[1:29:28] your life in a disarray to say I want to
[1:29:30] serve the Lord can the church say
[1:29:33] Amen a simple bible study this morning
[1:29:38] Hallelujah 18 years all of the children
[1:29:41] of Israel that were on the other side
[1:29:43] Jordan in the land of the amorites which
[1:29:45] is in
[1:29:46] Gilead moreover the children of Ammon
[1:29:49] passed over Jordan to fight also against
[1:29:52] Judah and against Benjamin
[1:29:54] and against the house of Ephraim so that
[1:29:56] Israel was sore
[1:29:58] distressed so they're under pressure can
[1:30:00] the church say amen and I want to I want
[1:30:02] you to look at this here
[1:30:04] now verse 10 and the children of the
[1:30:07] Lord Cried unto the Lord saying we have
[1:30:12] sinned against thee both because we have
[1:30:16] forsaken Our God and also served
[1:30:22] BM and that on a s Lord we realize that
[1:30:25] we messed up I realize and many times
[1:30:28] people come to the altar saying well
[1:30:30] Lord I'm sorry Lord I recognize I'm
[1:30:32] messed up listen to the Lord's response
[1:30:36] and the Lord said unto the children of
[1:30:37] Israel did I not deliver you from the
[1:30:40] Egyptians and from the amorites and from
[1:30:43] the children of Ammon and from the
[1:30:45] Philistines and the sidonians also and
[1:30:48] the amalekites and the maronites and did
[1:30:50] oppress you and he cried to me and I
[1:30:52] delivered you out of their hand yet you
[1:30:54] have forsaken me and served other gods
[1:30:57] wherefore I will deliver you no
[1:31:02] more he goes on go and cry unto the gods
[1:31:06] which you have
[1:31:07] [Applause]
[1:31:11] chosen let them deliver you in the time
[1:31:14] of your tribulation because I've always
[1:31:17] delivered you I've always protected you
[1:31:19] I've always shown you Mercy I took you
[1:31:21] out and you have still walked away now
[1:31:24] you come and crying to me not because
[1:31:26] you really want to repent you know
[1:31:28] you're crying to me because you're in
[1:31:31] trouble what God saw was people coming
[1:31:34] to the altar wanting help but without
[1:31:41] repentance I hope this this touches you
[1:31:45] having remorse for what you have done is
[1:31:47] not repentance having regret for what
[1:31:50] you did is not repentance and when God
[1:31:52] looked at their cry they were crying and
[1:31:55] he say I'm hearing your
[1:31:57] cries I'm hearing these cries but they
[1:32:00] are not honest cries you are crying
[1:32:02] because of distress go and cry to the
[1:32:06] other gods who you have been
[1:32:09] serving hallu can the church say
[1:32:18] Amen go and cry to the gods which you
[1:32:21] have chosen let them deliver you in the
[1:32:23] time of your tribul ation people say
[1:32:25] well I prayed and God didn't deliver and
[1:32:27] God didn't
[1:32:30] help and the children of Israel said
[1:32:33] unto the Lord we have sinned so now they
[1:32:36] are changing the conversation because
[1:32:38] the first approach did not work God
[1:32:41] rejected their first
[1:32:43] cry oh I hope this hits home this
[1:32:49] morning this is serious stuff right here
[1:32:52] right amen
[1:32:54] I want to go back to verse 10 again to
[1:32:55] see the cry God rejected and the
[1:32:57] children of Israel Cried unto the Lord
[1:32:59] saying we have sinned against thee both
[1:33:02] because we have forsaken Our God and
[1:33:04] also served bam and God said that is not
[1:33:06] good enough go and cry to the other gods
[1:33:10] now he comes in verse
[1:33:12] 15 they come now differently and the
[1:33:14] children of Israel said unto the Lord we
[1:33:15] have sinned do thou unto us whatsoever
[1:33:18] seeth good unto thee Deliver Us only we
[1:33:22] pray thee this day and vers 16 is where
[1:33:25] it changes and they put away the strange
[1:33:28] gods in other words the first time they
[1:33:30] cried the strange gods were still there
[1:33:34] oh you don't hear me this morning there
[1:33:35] are many people in church crying and
[1:33:38] they still have kept the strange
[1:33:42] gods they come to prayer meetings and
[1:33:45] they still have strange
[1:33:48] gods and God saw them crying and sighing
[1:33:52] and he is rejecting the cry because
[1:33:54] they're still living with strange Gods
[1:33:57] if you are here this morning and you
[1:33:59] have not put away the strange Gods today
[1:34:02] is the day that the Egyptians you see
[1:34:04] today we will see them no more forever
[1:34:07] we will put away every unclean every
[1:34:10] filthy Spirit every unclean
[1:34:13] thing can the church say
[1:34:16] [Applause]
[1:34:19] amen and they put away the strange Gods
[1:34:23] from among them and serve the Lord and
[1:34:26] when they put away the strange Gods the
[1:34:29] strange movies The Strange books the
[1:34:32] strange environments the strange things
[1:34:35] the things that you serve the things you
[1:34:37] spend time with the things you spend
[1:34:38] money on that has nothing to do with God
[1:34:41] that's a strange God God can't recognize
[1:34:43] it we can't even recognize it I can't
[1:34:45] recognize it's strange because it's not
[1:34:47] supposed to be it was not so from the
[1:34:49] beginning but the moment the strange
[1:34:51] gods are put away it opens up a
[1:34:56] door anybody with me this morning this
[1:34:59] is not the kind of shout and jump out of
[1:35:01] the service because we got to double
[1:35:03] check is there any strange God in my
[1:35:05] phone is there a strange God in my
[1:35:07] closet do I have clothes that serve a
[1:35:10] strange God do I have music that serves
[1:35:13] a strange godall
[1:35:15] [Applause]
[1:35:24] verse 16 and they put away the strange
[1:35:26] Gods from among them and serve the Lord
[1:35:30] and now look at God now and his
[1:35:33] soul was grieved for the misery of
[1:35:36] Israel when he saw the strange Gods
[1:35:39] because he told him you shall have no
[1:35:41] other gods before me the moment he see
[1:35:43] the strange God's God the moment he see
[1:35:45] all the strange Gods disappear now we
[1:35:47] can say my soul feel for the pain of the
[1:35:49] people can the church say amen and the
[1:35:52] children of Ammon were gathered together
[1:35:54] and encamped in Gilead and the children
[1:35:57] of Israel assembled themselves together
[1:35:59] and encamped in mispah and the people
[1:36:02] and princes of Gilead said one to
[1:36:04] another what man is he that will begin
[1:36:07] to fight against the children of Ammon
[1:36:10] he shall be head over all of the
[1:36:12] inhabitants of Gilead so now that their
[1:36:15] conversation changes brother Moses from
[1:36:17] we are in trouble and we are distressed
[1:36:19] because they know the strange gods have
[1:36:21] been moved away they know there's
[1:36:23] nothing stopping the power of God from
[1:36:25] moving through the camp and if the power
[1:36:27] of God can move through the camp then
[1:36:29] God is looking for somebody who is not
[1:36:31] afraid of the enemy he's looking for
[1:36:33] somebody who's not afraid to take the
[1:36:35] fight to the enemy's Camp can the church
[1:36:37] say Amen can we give the Lord a shout of
[1:36:40] [Applause]
[1:36:42] Praise You may be
[1:36:48] seated are you with me this
[1:36:51] morning now we go to Judges chapter 11
[1:36:56] now jeffa the gileadite was a mighty man
[1:36:59] of H I love that kind of testimony when
[1:37:02] somebody could look and say that's that
[1:37:04] brother is a mighty man of
[1:37:11] Allah but there was a
[1:37:14] challenge and he was the son of an
[1:37:21] halot questionable her Heritage Shady
[1:37:26] circumstances when he come to church he
[1:37:28] feel a little uncomfortable they look at
[1:37:30] him a certain way he feels a certain way
[1:37:31] but he's a mighty man of Valor you can't
[1:37:34] change the fact that there's something
[1:37:35] about his stature that you can't just
[1:37:38] spin down can the church say Amen his
[1:37:41] upbringing wasn't right his his his his
[1:37:43] lineage was a problem but he's a mighty
[1:37:45] man of Valor can the Church Say Amen
[1:37:53] and Gilead's wife bear him
[1:37:56] sons and his wife Sons grew up and they
[1:37:59] thrust out
[1:38:01] jeffa and said unto him Thou shalt not
[1:38:04] inherit in our father's house so in
[1:38:06] other words they pushed him out because
[1:38:08] of the inheritance in other words they
[1:38:10] say because you are an outlaw that's why
[1:38:12] I got because you are outside of the law
[1:38:15] because back there in the Old Testament
[1:38:17] if you were a bastard you couldn't get
[1:38:19] title so they say jeffa we we like how
[1:38:22] you fighting you're strong and
[1:38:23] everything but we don't want you to come
[1:38:25] when time is right to ask for
[1:38:28] inheritance even though you're a mighty
[1:38:30] man of Valor you don't belong to the
[1:38:32] family can the church say
[1:38:36] Amen so jeffa is
[1:38:38] rejected and many times brother Jonathan
[1:38:41] people go through experience because of
[1:38:44] rejection people don't belong they don't
[1:38:46] fit in and many times people end up in
[1:38:48] situations because things didn't work
[1:38:49] out a certain way can the church say
[1:38:51] amen amen
[1:38:53] let's
[1:38:56] go Thou shalt not inherit in our
[1:38:58] father's house for thou art the son of a
[1:39:00] strange woman so here is a mighty man of
[1:39:03] Valor with no title with no
[1:39:06] inheritance he could not even go into
[1:39:08] the temple normal way with them because
[1:39:10] he was not of the lineage brother Moses
[1:39:12] can the church say Amen so then jeffa in
[1:39:15] verse three he fled he didn't walk
[1:39:17] away he didn't run fled is is a bit
[1:39:22] more some could walk away and say well
[1:39:24] okay because you can imagine there's
[1:39:26] only so much rejection people could take
[1:39:28] so the Bible said he fled he said okay
[1:39:30] that's it I've had enough I'm running
[1:39:32] away from this thing and as much of a
[1:39:34] mighty man of Valor he was he
[1:39:36] fled is there anybody fleeing this
[1:39:40] morning he fled from his Brethren and I
[1:39:43] like how the Bible still calls them his
[1:39:46] Brethren even though they rejected him
[1:39:49] the scripture calls them
[1:39:50] Brethren and he dwelt in the land of tub
[1:39:53] and and they were gathered vain men and
[1:39:55] the amplifi they call worthless men so
[1:39:58] he's with some bad
[1:40:00] boys to jeffa and went out with him so
[1:40:03] jeffa went from a mighty man of Valor to
[1:40:05] like a gang
[1:40:10] leader who was once brother JEA in
[1:40:13] church although he was rejected in
[1:40:14] church is now gangster
[1:40:16] JEA he takes his particular set of
[1:40:19] skills and takes them to the land of tub
[1:40:22] and around This Man Called jeffa Mighty
[1:40:25] Man of Allah he is now running a
[1:40:27] criminal
[1:40:29] Empire a band of worthless
[1:40:34] men they have rejected me you could
[1:40:36] imagine how you could feel when you grow
[1:40:38] up in a certain thing and and then and
[1:40:39] now you're there on your own and you're
[1:40:41] trying to make an meet and there he is
[1:40:43] finds himself in a strange place in a
[1:40:45] strange situation anybody with
[1:40:48] me chapter uh verse four and it came to
[1:40:51] pass in the process of time that the
[1:40:53] children of Ammon made war against
[1:40:55] Israel so the heat is intensifying right
[1:40:58] with me and it was so that when the
[1:41:00] children of Ammon made war against
[1:41:01] Israel the Elders of Gilead not the
[1:41:04] deacons not the ushers not the Believers
[1:41:07] the
[1:41:10] elders went to fetch
[1:41:13] jeffa out of the land of
[1:41:16] to I've always said when God wanted to
[1:41:18] write the New Testament and the Pauline
[1:41:21] Epistles he got a academic called Paul
[1:41:24] who studied at the feet of
[1:41:26] gel so when things come and is war you
[1:41:29] need to get you have to get the baddest
[1:41:31] man that you know so these Elders put on
[1:41:35] their suits brother gouki and they left
[1:41:38] Gilead to cross into the land of Tob I
[1:41:41] want you to picture these Elders taking
[1:41:43] their time going into gangster territory
[1:41:47] and it's one thing to go into a gangster
[1:41:49] territory to look for a gangster it's
[1:41:52] another thing to look with the leader of
[1:41:54] the
[1:41:58] [Applause]
[1:42:00] gangsters you may be SE it I said to the
[1:42:03] church back home there are some parts of
[1:42:05] my country I don't really go to and and
[1:42:08] and there was a friend of mine who went
[1:42:09] to a certain area they stop his car you
[1:42:11] say you sure you know where you're going
[1:42:13] because if you keep going down here you
[1:42:15] you really need to know somebody there
[1:42:16] cuz if you go down there is a whole
[1:42:17] different thing so it's one thing to go
[1:42:19] to the land of TOA and I'm looking to
[1:42:21] rent a gangster this was not it we
[1:42:23] looking for jeffa andbody say JEA jeffa
[1:42:25] jeffa
[1:42:26] JEA you sure you want to see
[1:42:29] JEA do you know who jeffa
[1:42:34] is he's the Kingpin in the tent you
[1:42:38] know could you imagine the elders slowly
[1:42:41] saying yes we have come to see
[1:42:50] jeffa and they came and H uh and they
[1:42:54] said unto jeffa so I could imagine
[1:42:57] because when you build a reputation
[1:42:58] brother the Jonathan as a bad man as a
[1:43:01] gangster I don't know what word he use
[1:43:02] here what the word he use bad guy
[1:43:05] gangster I'm not sure Jonathan is a bad
[1:43:08] guy because I don't I don't think bad
[1:43:10] guy is quite qualified but but when you
[1:43:13] build a reputation you cannot appear to
[1:43:16] seem vulnerable so I can imagine when
[1:43:18] Jeff because he knows the
[1:43:21] elders say look but chick boo TOS
[1:43:25] look maybe Jeff
[1:43:27] said let them meet me in private because
[1:43:31] he can't afford for these gangsters to
[1:43:33] know he grew up in church he can't
[1:43:35] afford for these gangsters to know he
[1:43:37] was going to Convention he can't afford
[1:43:39] for these gangsters to know that he
[1:43:42] knows the word he has built up a
[1:43:44] reputation that he's a bad
[1:43:48] man you can imagine gu say who are these
[1:43:51] who are these Elders coming
[1:43:54] anybody with me this you see in the
[1:43:55] picture right okay
[1:43:57] wonderful and they said unto jeffa come
[1:44:01] and the man and and this is amazing the
[1:44:03] man who was rejected who fled look at
[1:44:06] the brothers now come and be our
[1:44:12] captain that we may fight with the
[1:44:15] children of
[1:44:16] am and this is why I said jeffa had to
[1:44:19] say this quietly because he couldn't
[1:44:21] afford for the other gangsters to hear
[1:44:22] him and jeffa said unto the elders did
[1:44:25] you not hate me and expel me out of my
[1:44:28] father's house and why are you come unto
[1:44:31] me now when ye are in
[1:44:35] distress and the Elders of Gilead said
[1:44:37] unto Jeff therefore we turned again to
[1:44:40] thee now that thou mayest go with us and
[1:44:43] fight against the children of Ammon and
[1:44:44] be our head over all the inhabitants of
[1:44:47] Gilead could you imagine last yesterday
[1:44:50] day before he there doing all kind of
[1:44:51] stuff and now this this is I call this
[1:44:53] the greatest head hunting the HR world
[1:44:55] has ever seen jeffa didn't apply for
[1:44:58] this job he was head hunted he was
[1:45:00] recruited to be the top
[1:45:05] General yesterday he's hunting down all
[1:45:08] kind of whatever you could do with his
[1:45:09] gangsters and today he has a job offer
[1:45:12] come be our captain come be our head
[1:45:15] you'll be head of all them brothers who
[1:45:16] rejected you all them brothers who
[1:45:18] despised you all them brothers who
[1:45:20] rejected you can the Church Say Amen
[1:45:27] Hall therefore we turn to again to the
[1:45:30] know I'm and in verse eight that thou
[1:45:32] mayest go with us and fight against the
[1:45:33] children of Ammon and be our head over
[1:45:35] all the inhabitants of Gilead and jeffa
[1:45:38] said unto the Elders of Gilead if you
[1:45:40] bring me home now I like his use of the
[1:45:42] word
[1:45:44] home he was outside of the fellowship
[1:45:47] brother the gie but he still saw it as
[1:45:50] home and there are people who spend time
[1:45:52] on the church whatever reason but
[1:45:54] there's no place
[1:45:55] like Hallelujah for all of the time he
[1:45:59] is there in tub living outside of the
[1:46:01] Covenant as it were he knows where home
[1:46:04] is and he said to them if you bring me
[1:46:09] home again to fight against the children
[1:46:11] of Ammon and the Lord deliver them
[1:46:14] before me shall I be your head in other
[1:46:15] words he's trying to confirm are you
[1:46:17] telling me that if I come and fight I'll
[1:46:18] be in
[1:46:19] charge and the Elders of Gilead said
[1:46:21] unto jeffa the Lord be witness between
[1:46:23] us if we do not so according to thy
[1:46:26] words in other words this is
[1:46:28] confirmed then jeffa went with the
[1:46:31] Ellers of gilled I don't know who jeffa
[1:46:32] left in
[1:46:35] charge of the bad boys but I could just
[1:46:38] imagine jeffa walking out jeffa throw up
[1:46:41] the gangster outfit jeffa put on his
[1:46:44] suit that he used to wear at a
[1:46:45] convention and jeffa is Walking with the
[1:46:47] ERS back to Gilead yesterday he's a
[1:46:51] gangster today he's a leader of the
[1:46:53] people of Gilead yesterday he's in
[1:46:55] trouble but today he's in the house of
[1:46:58] God yesterday he doing one thing but
[1:47:02] today he's in
[1:47:04] position it is the Divine mystery of his
[1:47:07] spiritual identity he had no idea what
[1:47:11] he was born to do can the church say
[1:47:13] Amen I'm not going to be too much longer
[1:47:16] this is just encourage you a little bit
[1:47:19] Church hallu
[1:47:23] then jeffa went with the Elders of
[1:47:24] Gilead and the people made him head and
[1:47:26] Captain two
[1:47:28] things hallu this isn't God good that's
[1:47:32] why it's the sovereignty of God or know
[1:47:34] you can imagine Brothers say but all
[1:47:35] this time I'm here in church all this
[1:47:37] time I here in the Army and is Jeff they
[1:47:40] bring to not just be Captain but head
[1:47:42] and
[1:47:43] Captain he is President and General in
[1:47:46] commanding Chief of the Armed Forces
[1:47:53] wow head and Captain over them and Jeff
[1:47:55] jeffa uttered all his words before the
[1:47:57] Lord in misper and jeffa and this is
[1:48:00] where you could be you could maybe see
[1:48:04] and I love this because the thought
[1:48:06] would be brother uzo that if you bring a
[1:48:08] gangster to deal with a war situation
[1:48:11] that the first response would be who
[1:48:13] ready to
[1:48:14] fight you have your weapons you strapped
[1:48:17] let's let's go let's go one time I've
[1:48:18] I've arrived but look at jeffa
[1:48:23] in verse 12 and jeffa sent Messengers
[1:48:26] unto the king of the children of Ammon
[1:48:28] so jeffa was more than just a gangsta
[1:48:30] brother gie jeffa started with
[1:48:33] arbitration and
[1:48:37] mediation jeffa sent messagers unto the
[1:48:39] king of the children of Ammon saying
[1:48:41] what hast thou to do with me he already
[1:48:43] claim ownership
[1:48:44] now that thou had come against me to
[1:48:47] fight in my land so he understands what
[1:48:51] is his he understands who he is the
[1:48:54] previous rejection of his family line is
[1:48:56] not even considered in this conversation
[1:48:59] who his mother was is irrelevant how he
[1:49:02] grew up is irrelevant he said this is my
[1:49:04] land oh come on
[1:49:07] now what has thou to do with me that
[1:49:10] thou had come against me to fight in my
[1:49:13] land and the king of the children of
[1:49:15] Ammon answered unto the messages Jeff a
[1:49:18] even reach yet he sending representative
[1:49:20] he sent his lawyers
[1:49:24] and the king of the children of Ammon
[1:49:27] answered unto the messengers of DEA
[1:49:29] because Israel took away my land when
[1:49:31] they came up out of Egypt from Anon even
[1:49:34] unto Jabbok and unto Jordan now
[1:49:37] therefore restore those lands again
[1:49:40] peaceably and that's a good legal
[1:49:43] argument it's a
[1:49:45] conversation then jeffa sent Messengers
[1:49:47] unto the king of the children of Ammon
[1:49:50] and he said unto him and I love this
[1:49:52] thus say
[1:49:59] JEA talk about understanding who you are
[1:50:03] talk about understanding where you come
[1:50:05] from talk about understanding how God is
[1:50:08] going to use
[1:50:10] [Music]
[1:50:13] you he said thus sayth
[1:50:16] jeffa
[1:50:21] Hallelujah h
[1:50:25] Israel took not away the land of Moab
[1:50:27] now I love this because this is the
[1:50:29] reformed gangster who clearly is way
[1:50:32] more than a gangster this gangster
[1:50:35] understands history he understands
[1:50:37] genealogy he understand the spiritual
[1:50:39] Dimension he understands the Anchor
[1:50:42] Point of his faith he understands the
[1:50:44] court because the secret is the word is
[1:50:45] in the bride and he was clearly part of
[1:50:48] this economy because God took him from a
[1:50:50] gangster into Hebrews 11 oh come come on
[1:50:53] [Applause]
[1:50:54] [Music]
[1:50:57] now thus say jeffa Israel took not away
[1:51:01] the land of Moab nor the land of the
[1:51:03] children of Ammon but let me rewind the
[1:51:06] tape to show you what really
[1:51:08] happened when Israel came up from Egypt
[1:51:11] this is jeffa speaking this is not the
[1:51:13] priest this not the Scribe he said when
[1:51:15] Israel now this is a son of a halot who
[1:51:18] had no land no title No deed he grew up
[1:51:20] as an outsider but clearly he was in
[1:51:23] church because he was hearing the word
[1:51:25] to be able to repeal come on now
[1:51:29] somebody that's why this message will
[1:51:32] find itself into the hands of the
[1:51:34] predestinated can the church say
[1:51:38] Amen so Jeff to say let me school you
[1:51:41] this morning when Israel came out of
[1:51:43] Egypt and walked through the Wilderness
[1:51:46] unto the Red Sea and came to Kadesh and
[1:51:50] then Israel sent Messengers unto the
[1:51:52] king of Edom saying let me I pray thee
[1:51:54] pass through thy land but the king of
[1:51:57] Edom would not hearken ther too so we
[1:52:00] tried that and in like manner Des sent
[1:52:02] unto the king of Moab but he would not
[1:52:04] consent and Israel aboe in Gades then
[1:52:08] they went along through the Wilderness
[1:52:10] and compassed the land of Edom and the
[1:52:13] land of Moab and came by the east side
[1:52:15] of the land of Moab and pitch on the
[1:52:17] other side of Anan but came not within
[1:52:19] the border of Moab for Anan was the
[1:52:21] border of Moab
[1:52:24] up and Israel sent messages unto seon
[1:52:28] King of the amorites the king of heshbon
[1:52:31] and Israel s to him let us pass we pray
[1:52:33] thee through the land into my place but
[1:52:35] seon trusted not Israel to pass through
[1:52:37] his Coast but seon this is where the
[1:52:40] problem started gathered up all his
[1:52:42] people together and pitched in Jes and
[1:52:45] fought against Israel so let me make it
[1:52:48] clear to you how this thing started and
[1:52:49] the Lord God of Israel delivered on and
[1:52:53] all his people into the hand of Israel
[1:52:56] and they smoted them so Israel possessed
[1:53:00] all the land of the amorites the
[1:53:02] inhabitants of that country and they
[1:53:04] possess all the cour of the amorites
[1:53:06] from Anon even onto Jabbok and from the
[1:53:08] Wilderness even un Jordan so now the
[1:53:11] Lord God of Israel hath
[1:53:15] dispossessed do you know what God has
[1:53:18] dispossessed in your favor do you know
[1:53:20] what God has listen God has dispossessed
[1:53:24] things in your favor you got to know
[1:53:27] what is your own somebody give God a
[1:53:29] shout of
[1:53:30] [Applause]
[1:53:34] Praise so Jeff is saying don't hold us
[1:53:37] accountable is the
[1:53:42] Lord my my my my
[1:53:45] my the Lord God of Israel had
[1:53:47] dispossessed the amorites from before
[1:53:50] his people Israel and shouldest thou
[1:53:52] possess it in other words after God has
[1:53:55] told me the land is my land after God
[1:53:57] has told me healing is mine after he
[1:53:59] told me my family is mine after he told
[1:54:02] me the Holy Ghost is mine after he told
[1:54:04] me good health and strength is mine
[1:54:06] after he told me victory is mine after
[1:54:09] he told me joy is mine and peace is mine
[1:54:12] you want to tell me I shouldn't possess
[1:54:14] it you mean to tell me after God has
[1:54:17] done that for me I will let you take
[1:54:19] what God has given me you get out of
[1:54:22] here I know who I am I know what belongs
[1:54:25] to me I know where I come from I know
[1:54:28] where I'm going can the church say
[1:54:33] [Applause]
[1:54:40] Amen you may be seen it Jeff to so
[1:54:44] inspired he says Thou should as thou
[1:54:47] possess it in other words I've got to be
[1:54:49] crazy after we've been through all this
[1:54:52] stuff to let you take what God has given
[1:54:54] me and if I know what God has given me
[1:54:56] and it's mine there's no way I'm giving
[1:54:58] it to you it's mine healing is mine
[1:55:00] victory is mine peace of mine sickness
[1:55:03] is not my portion depression is not my
[1:55:06] portion frustration is not my
[1:55:08] [Applause]
[1:55:16] por brother
[1:55:19] gie Jeff's lawyers are so good
[1:55:24] that after that argument they say will
[1:55:27] thou not possess will thou will not thou
[1:55:30] possess that which CH much thy God give
[1:55:32] thee to
[1:55:34] possess you catch that he said in other
[1:55:37] words if the God I serve give me
[1:55:38] something it is my right to live in the
[1:55:41] realm of what God gave me if your idol
[1:55:44] give you something then you should fight
[1:55:46] for that but don't fight for what God
[1:55:47] give me if you're chamers God give you
[1:55:50] something well go and find whatever that
[1:55:51] is and you take that but as for me and
[1:55:54] my house we will serve the

[1:56:55] yet it's just his lawyers he send
[1:56:58] brother GOI and the brothers
[1:57:01] later he just said his lawers will thou
[1:57:04] not possess that which Cham must thy God
[1:57:06] giveth thee to possess so and and and
[1:57:08] this is my declaration this morning so
[1:57:10] whomever the Lord Our God shall drive
[1:57:13] out from before us them will we possess
[1:57:16] in other words if the Lord is clearing a
[1:57:18] path for me to blessing I am possessing
[1:57:20] It All Holy Ghost Dynamics adoption my
[1:57:24] family my children whatever it
[1:57:27] is if the Lord goes before me I am more
[1:57:31] than able to possess every inch of
[1:57:39] ground
[1:57:41] Hallelujah I'm not asking for
[1:57:43] forgiveness if God drove a away for me
[1:57:46] to go I'm going right there every place
[1:57:48] my foot go that's what I'm going to take
[1:57:51] can the church say
[1:57:52] [Applause]
[1:57:58] [Applause]
[1:58:03] amen so after and these brothers are
[1:58:07] finishing their legal argument brother
[1:58:09] Goki is so solid after they deal with
[1:58:11] the history they switch to the spiritual
[1:58:13] Dimension now they see and now having
[1:58:17] said all of this and now add th anything
[1:58:20] better than
[1:58:21] baac the son of zapor King of the Moab
[1:58:25] did he ever strive against Israel or did
[1:58:27] he ever fight against them while Israel
[1:58:30] dwelt in heshbon and her towns and in AO
[1:58:33] and her towns and all the cities that be
[1:58:36] along by the coast of anon 300
[1:58:39] years why therefore did ye not recover
[1:58:43] them within that time that's what we
[1:58:46] call in law statute of limitations the
[1:58:48] matter was statute bad if the devil had
[1:58:51] to get you he should have done it a long
[1:58:53] time ago it's too late
[1:58:59] [Applause]
[1:59:00] now in other words Jeff's men said your
[1:59:06] legal argument your whole case should
[1:59:09] have been tried 300 years
[1:59:12] ago statute of limitation run
[1:59:15] out can't even stand up in court it's
[1:59:18] too late now it's already our land go
[1:59:22] God already give it to us and if you
[1:59:24] wanted to fight us for it you should
[1:59:25] have done it at Calvary but it's already
[1:59:28] finished all the way back
[1:59:30] [Applause]
[1:59:33] there give the Lord a shout of
[1:59:38] Praise too late devil too late devil too
[1:59:43] late devil I've come too far to turn
[1:59:46] back now what God has done for me oh I
[1:59:49] tell you I can't but tell it all
[2:00:04] brother oil I'm trying to find a place
[2:00:06] to
[2:00:07] [Music]
[2:00:14] land so verse 27 wherefore I have not
[2:00:19] sinned against thee but thou do with me
[2:00:22] wrong to war against me the Lord the
[2:00:26] judge here is a judge my title is the
[2:00:29] outlaw who became a judge here is a
[2:00:33] judge that's acknowledging the judge he
[2:00:35] said the Lord the judge be judged this
[2:00:39] day between the children of Israel and
[2:00:42] the children of
[2:00:43] Ammon verse
[2:00:45] 28 how be
[2:00:48] it the king of the children of Ammon
[2:00:52] hearken not unto the words of jeffa
[2:00:54] which he sent
[2:00:57] him and you know to to for the young
[2:01:00] people all them movies they're trying to
[2:01:02] make this is such a powerful story
[2:01:05] because if if the head of Ammon did just
[2:01:09] comply the story wouldn't get
[2:01:16] better so the fact that he say I hear
[2:01:19] and all of that now jeffa gets to beat
[2:01:22] JEA he said I try the Diplomatic way I
[2:01:26] try to talk to you I send my lawyers to
[2:01:28] negotiate with you if it's War you want
[2:01:31] then it's War you're going to
[2:01:36] [Applause]
[2:01:40] get how be it the king of the children
[2:01:43] of Ammon Harker not unto the words of
[2:01:45] JEA which you send them and this is
[2:01:48] verse 29 and I made reference very early
[2:01:50] that an angel came to Gideon
[2:01:52] an angel went to Samson's family we know
[2:01:54] this but jeffa had no spiritual
[2:01:57] encounter in that sense but verse 29
[2:02:01] then the spirit of the Lord Came Upon
[2:02:06] jeffa so all that jeffa was doing before
[2:02:09] brother GOI was under inspiration but
[2:02:12] now the spirit of the Lord Came Upon
[2:02:14] jeffa there something happens when the
[2:02:17] spirit of the Lord comes upon you woo
[2:02:21] Glory
[2:02:22] [Applause]
[2:02:25] so if jeffa was inspired before now he's
[2:02:28] Anointed The Spirit of the Lord is upon
[2:02:31] him he is moved by the spirit
[2:02:39] Hallelujah then the spirit of the
[2:02:42] Lord Came Upon jeffa and he passed over
[2:02:47] Gilead and manisa and passed over misp
[2:02:50] of Gilead and from m of Gilead he passed
[2:02:52] over unto the TR of Ammon and verse 30
[2:02:57] now this is where the story shifts now
[2:02:59] and I want to tie something to as we
[2:03:02] begin to land this
[2:03:05] message and jeffa vowed a
[2:03:08] vow unto the
[2:03:11] Lord and said if Thou shalt without fail
[2:03:15] deliver the children of Ammon into mine
[2:03:18] hands then it shall be that whatsoever
[2:03:20] cometh forth out of the doors of my
[2:03:23] house to meet me when I return in peace
[2:03:26] from the children of Ammon shall surely
[2:03:28] be the Lords and I will offer it up for
[2:03:30] a burnt
[2:03:38] offering so jeffa passed over unto the
[2:03:42] children of Ammon to fight against them
[2:03:44] and the Lord delivered them into his
[2:03:46] hands and he smed them from aror even
[2:03:49] till th come to minute even t 20 cities
[2:03:54] hallu he went from Cross
[2:04:00] River to
[2:04:02] anra from anra is it Delta to to enugu
[2:04:06] an Inu
[2:04:22] 20 cities and under the plain of The
[2:04:25] Vineyards with a very great Slaughter
[2:04:27] thus the children of Ammon was subdued
[2:04:30] before the children of
[2:04:32] Israel now this is where it gets serious
[2:04:36] now and jeffa came to misper unto his
[2:04:42] house and behold his daughter came out
[2:04:45] to meet him
[2:04:54] I
[2:05:02] have let me finish the verse
[2:05:05] first and jeffa came to misper onto his
[2:05:08] house and behold his daughter came out
[2:05:10] to meet him with timbrels and with
[2:05:12] dances and she was his only
[2:05:16] child beside her he had neither son nor
[2:05:20] daughter I said to the church when I
[2:05:22] read
[2:05:24] this I have one
[2:05:27] daughter I have tried my best to speak
[2:05:30] with her every day that I've been out
[2:05:31] the country and I know the excitement
[2:05:34] she will have when I get
[2:05:38] home and I'm picturing this gangster
[2:05:42] turned the
[2:05:43] judge this man who has had to overcome
[2:05:46] so many challenges in
[2:05:48] life makes a statement and brother
[2:05:52] Branham speaks about it and we'll get to
[2:05:54] a short
[2:05:55] quote that maybe he didn't think it all
[2:05:58] the way
[2:06:01] through because by the brandham calls it
[2:06:03] a rash
[2:06:06] vow and me going to land talking about
[2:06:08] vows and commitments but here it is now
[2:06:11] he is
[2:06:13] confronted with the words that he said
[2:06:15] unto God
[2:06:18] [Music]
[2:06:25] amen verse 35 man it came to pass when
[2:06:28] he saw her that he rent his clothes and
[2:06:33] said alas my daughter thou has brought
[2:06:36] me very
[2:06:38] low and thou art one of them that
[2:06:42] trouble me for I have opened my mouth
[2:06:45] unto the Lord hallu and I cannot
[2:06:51] I
[2:06:53] cannot go
[2:06:55] [Music]
[2:06:57] back do you understand the Power of
[2:07:05] Words and the critical importance that
[2:07:08] stringing sentences
[2:07:11] together stringing words together and
[2:07:15] uttering something carries consequences
[2:07:18] that you may not even realize
[2:07:22] maybe the experiences that jeffa went
[2:07:25] through because I don't think gangsters
[2:07:27] sign agreements
[2:07:31] no no one has a let me see your lawyer
[2:07:34] and your lawyer meet my lawyer and we'll
[2:07:36] discuss this no you will deliver it if
[2:07:39] you don't deliver it you're
[2:07:42] dead it's very
[2:07:44] simple before lawyers were a thing men
[2:07:47] live by their
[2:07:49] word their word was their bond
[2:07:52] now we can't remember where's the
[2:07:54] agreement oh so I really did promise it
[2:07:56] and assign it okay well now
[2:08:00] I but the world was framed by the word
[2:08:03] of
[2:08:04] God life and death is in the power of
[2:08:07] the tongue the spoken word is the
[2:08:09] Original Seed our words have
[2:08:12] power and Jeff is saying I said some
[2:08:15] words unto the Lord I didn't say it to
[2:08:18] the pastor I didn't say it to my parents
[2:08:22] I didn't say to the Elder to the Deacon
[2:08:24] but I said some words unto the Lord and
[2:08:28] I
[2:08:29] cannot take it back how does that
[2:08:32] elevate the words when we take a vow
[2:08:34] from
[2:08:40] marriage because when you stand before
[2:08:42] the sacred desk you are taken a vow
[2:08:44] before
[2:08:45] the
[2:08:47] God
[2:08:50] hallelujah hallelujah
[2:08:52] now it gets
[2:08:57] real
[2:09:01] Hallelujah prise the daughter's response
[2:09:04] in verse 36 blew me away because it
[2:09:07] speaks to the fact that she was a
[2:09:09] daughter of
[2:09:10] training and she said unto him my father
[2:09:13] if thou Hast opened thy mouth unto the
[2:09:16] Lord do to me according to that which
[2:09:20] hath proceeded out of thy mouth for as
[2:09:23] much as the Lord ha taken Vengeance for
[2:09:25] thee for thine enemies even of the
[2:09:28] children of
[2:09:31] Ammon now I want to touch on two
[2:09:35] scriptures to help
[2:09:38] you Psalms Psalm
[2:09:42] 15 verse
[2:09:47] one Lord who shall abide in thy
[2:09:50] Tabernacle
[2:09:51] who shall dwell in thy Holy Hill he that
[2:09:55] walth uprightly and worketh
[2:09:58] righteousness and speaketh the truth in
[2:10:00] his heart he that backbiteth not with
[2:10:03] his tongue nor doeth evil to his
[2:10:05] neighbor nor taketh up a reproach
[2:10:08] against his neighbor in whose eyes a
[2:10:11] vile person is condemned but he honored
[2:10:14] them that fear the lord and listen to
[2:10:16] this verse he that sweareth to his own
[2:10:19] hurt and changeth not
[2:10:22] in the
[2:10:24] Amplified this says he keeps his word
[2:10:27] even to his own
[2:10:29] disadvantage and does not change it for
[2:10:31] his own
[2:10:33] benefit so this elevates to us as
[2:10:35] Believers how do we really keep our word
[2:10:38] to God we started this study with judges
[2:10:42] where they were repenting with their
[2:10:43] lips you may be see it where they were
[2:10:45] repenting with their lips and God said
[2:10:47] you're still keeping strange gods and
[2:10:48] not hearing your words but if you're
[2:10:50] making a vow before me many times people
[2:10:53] say well it was a mistake I said a
[2:10:55] mistake but but your words are important
[2:10:57] and here it is the psalmist David is
[2:11:00] saying you you said something even if
[2:11:02] it's to your own
[2:11:04] hurt you have to live with
[2:11:10] it is this is this hidden home let's
[2:11:14] read one more scripture the musician
[2:11:16] will begin to get
[2:11:17] ready Ecclesiastes 5
[2:11:24] verse
[2:11:25] one keep thy foot when thou goest to the
[2:11:30] house of God and be more ready to hear
[2:11:34] than to give the sacrifice of fools for
[2:11:37] they consider not that they do evil be
[2:11:40] not rash with thy mouth and let not
[2:11:44] thine heart be Hasty to utter anything
[2:11:47] before God for God is in heaven and and
[2:11:51] thou upon Earth therefore let thy Words
[2:11:54] Be Few for a dream cometh through the
[2:11:57] multitude of business and a Fool's voice
[2:12:00] is known by multitude of words when thou
[2:12:04] vest a vow unto God defer not to pay it
[2:12:10] for he hath no pleasure in fools pay
[2:12:13] that which thou Hast vowed better is it
[2:12:16] that thou shouldest not vow than thou
[2:12:19] shouldest vow and not
[2:12:23] suffer not thy mouth to cause thy flesh
[2:12:26] to sin neither say before the angel that
[2:12:29] it was an error I'm reading scripture
[2:12:32] wherefore should God be angry at thy
[2:12:35] voice and destroy the work of thy
[2:12:41] hands so this is the gravity so when
[2:12:44] jeffa realize maybe I said something
[2:12:47] unto God that maybe I didn't think this
[2:12:49] thing true but oh God I I got to keep my
[2:12:52] word and his daughter say well Dad if
[2:12:54] you said something unto the Lord you
[2:12:56] have to keep
[2:12:58] it I want to read that in the Amplified
[2:13:01] you can begin to play something
[2:13:04] softly guard your steps and focus on
[2:13:08] what you are doing as you go to the
[2:13:09] house of God and draw near to listen
[2:13:12] rather than to offer the careless or
[2:13:15] irreverent sacrifice of fools for they
[2:13:17] are too ignorant to know that they are
[2:13:19] doing evil do not be Hasty with your
[2:13:22] mouth speaking careless words of ours or
[2:13:26] impulsive in thought to bring up a
[2:13:28] matter before God for God is in heaven
[2:13:31] and you are on the earth therefore let
[2:13:33] your Words Be Few for the dream comes
[2:13:35] through much effort and the voice of
[2:13:38] fools through many words when you make a
[2:13:40] vow or a pledge to God do not put off
[2:13:43] paying it for God takes no pleasure in
[2:13:46] fools who thoughtlessly mock him pay
[2:13:48] what you vow it is better that you
[2:13:51] should not vow then you should vow and
[2:13:53] not pay do not allow your speech to
[2:13:56] cause you to sin and do not say before
[2:13:58] the messenger or priest of God that it
[2:14:01] was a
[2:14:11] mistake so jeffa made it to Hebrews 11
[2:14:14] not just because he was a brother
[2:14:17] Jonathan but because because because he
[2:14:20] was a man who understood the power of a
[2:14:24] vow and a commitment to the Lord so when
[2:14:27] you young people say Lord I want to
[2:14:30] serve you I'm making a vow to serve you
[2:14:33] how prepared are you to do whatever it
[2:14:37] takes as a young sister you take a vow
[2:14:40] to preserve your virtue your
[2:14:45] Chastity are you prepared to do whatever
[2:14:48] it takes to keep that vow as a
[2:14:52] husband you stood before the Altar and
[2:14:55] this word Angel says priest it's Pastor
[2:14:58] it's the same context so you stand
[2:15:00] before God and man to take the vow this
[2:15:02] changes this is not just don't fornicate
[2:15:04] don't commit adultery this is a vow
[2:15:06] before God he said it's better to not
[2:15:08] vow than to vow and and waste it but if
[2:15:11] you are making a declaration to God Lord
[2:15:13] I'm going to serve
[2:15:15] you I take thee as my wife For Better or
[2:15:18] For Worse for richer for poorer for
[2:15:19] sickness and health until death do us
[2:15:21] part for love and to cherish For Better
[2:15:23] or For Worse that's a vow before God
[2:15:25] hallelujah this is higher than don't
[2:15:28] commit
[2:15:29] adultery this is I made a vow before God
[2:15:32] to serve
[2:15:34] him I vow to serve him whether I
[2:15:38] maintain my family let me maintain
[2:15:42] Christ is this hitting home for
[2:15:46] [Music]
[2:15:48] anyone maybe you have made vows at you
[2:15:51] have not
[2:15:52] kept maybe you have said things that
[2:15:54] many time people come to the Altar and
[2:15:55] Lord I'm I'm going to change I'm going
[2:15:57] to do this and and you find yourself
[2:15:59] pulled into all kind of situations I
[2:16:01] want you to relook at that and if you
[2:16:04] are choosing today to make a decision a
[2:16:07] choice a vow a commitment to serve God
[2:16:11] that you really mean it and you back
[2:16:14] that word up with whatever action is
[2:16:16] required because it's not a vow to me
[2:16:19] it's not a it's not a man it's not to
[2:16:20] the Past P it's to
[2:16:29] God verse 36 back to judges and she said
[2:16:33] unto
[2:16:34] him no I I I I
[2:16:38] wonder if she was not the way she was as
[2:16:41] a daughter because there's one thing for
[2:16:43] a father to make a vow that that impacts
[2:16:47] his family and it's a whole another
[2:16:49] experience if she had said oh God daddy
[2:16:51] don't do
[2:16:57] it but she was a special
[2:17:03] girl my father if thou has opened thy
[2:17:06] mouth unto the Lord do to me according
[2:17:09] to that which proceeded out of thy mouth
[2:17:12] for as much as the Lord had taken
[2:17:14] Vengeance for thee of thine enemies even
[2:17:16] of the children of
[2:17:18] Ammon and she said unto her father
[2:17:21] let
[2:17:23] me let this thing be done for me let me
[2:17:26] alone two months that I may go up and
[2:17:29] down upon the mountains and bewail my
[2:17:31] virginity I and my
[2:17:33] fellows and he said go and he sent her
[2:17:35] away for two months and she went with
[2:17:37] her Companions and bewailed her
[2:17:39] virginity upon the mountains and it came
[2:17:42] to pass at the end of two months that
[2:17:43] she returned unto her father who did
[2:17:45] with her according to his vow which he
[2:17:47] had vowed and she knew no man and it was
[2:17:50] a custom in Israel that the daughters of
[2:17:52] Israel went yearly to lament the
[2:17:53] daughter of jeffar the gileadite four
[2:17:55] days in a
[2:17:57] year theologians have debated how the
[2:17:59] story ends but it says that she knew not
[2:18:03] a
[2:18:04] man and the words that were used in the
[2:18:06] original text would suggest that she
[2:18:09] became like a temple maid dedicating her
[2:18:12] life completely to God so jeffa
[2:18:14] potentially lost the lineage his family
[2:18:16] because this girl would have given her
[2:18:18] life to serve in the temple never
[2:18:21] getting married never having children
[2:18:23] mourned her virginity for two
[2:18:27] months because of her
[2:18:29] vow a sacrifice because of a
[2:18:34] vow maybe jeffa saw himself walking his
[2:18:37] daughter up the aisle one day and his
[2:18:40] vow shut that picture
[2:18:43] down she had to mourn with her friends
[2:18:46] because her friends may have thought
[2:18:47] themselves brid Maids at some point but
[2:18:50] the vow not The Vow that she made but
[2:18:52] the vow that her father made had an
[2:18:54] impact on her own destiny That's The
[2:18:57] Power of
[2:18:59] vows I want to shake you this morning
[2:19:02] that through this short bible study and
[2:19:05] encouragement about the outlaw who
[2:19:06] became a
[2:19:08] judge he was a judge of Israel but he
[2:19:10] was a judge who in his own home had to
[2:19:13] live something that had such an impact
[2:19:16] upon him and his daughter and his life
[2:19:18] that it was something as a Trad
[2:19:20] conditioned they could
[2:19:23] remember the sacrifice that she had to
[2:19:25] make because of his
[2:19:29] vow may we as we leave this service
[2:19:32] today and maybe you want to relook at
[2:19:35] the vows you made to the Lord maybe you
[2:19:38] have made vows to the Lord that you
[2:19:39] realize Lord I have not been even
[2:19:41] keeping
[2:19:42] it don't hold it against me Lord but
[2:19:46] today I'm ready to reconnect to The Vow
[2:19:49] amen many of us we still Lord if you
[2:19:52] take this situation away from me or
[2:19:55] deliver me from this I'm going to serve
[2:19:56] you differently I'm going to do this for
[2:19:58] you and do this for you and and you let
[2:20:00] the cares of Life swamp you and all the
[2:20:02] things you promis to do for God
[2:20:05] you and God is saying but you promis you
[2:20:08] promised me you made a vow to me where
[2:20:10] is it this is not for for God to punish
[2:20:15] you or put you into oppression but your
[2:20:18] words mean something to God your
[2:20:20] existence is by the word so I want to
[2:20:23] encourage you Church encourage you
[2:20:25] fathers mothers be very careful what you
[2:20:28] say to your children be very careful
[2:20:30] what you say about them speak positive
[2:20:34] am Speak Life speak hope speak Joy speak
[2:20:39] truth there's power in your words be
[2:20:42] careful what you say about yourself be
[2:20:44] very careful go back in your own study
[2:20:47] and look back at these scriptures that
[2:20:49] we read from Eccles Ecclesiastes 5 and
[2:20:53] from Psalms 15 and make it your study
[2:20:57] during the course of this week Lord help
[2:20:59] me to measure my words measure my
[2:21:02] statements it changes even how you do
[2:21:05] business because it says there if you
[2:21:08] make a promise to your own
[2:21:11] hurt be a man of your word be a woman of
[2:21:15] your word be a daughter you could
[2:21:17] imagine if God doesn't keep his own word
[2:21:20] this thing we love about God because he
[2:21:22] is his word and he has to keep his word
[2:21:26] and God wants us to grow up to be Sons
[2:21:28] and
[2:21:29] Daughters who keep the word every head
[2:21:32] bowed every eye closed Lord we stand
[2:21:36] here in this service this bible study
[2:21:40] this realization of our spiritual
[2:21:43] identity in you and Lord this man
[2:21:46] jeffa who came from strange Beginnings
[2:21:49] but you use him to transform history
[2:21:52] defeating the ammonites and in lord your
[2:21:54] Prophet said he made a rash vow but he
[2:21:57] stood by his word as an encouragement to
[2:21:59] us that despite the sacrifice maybe we
[2:22:01] need to lose friends maybe we need to
[2:22:04] change who we call on our phones maybe
[2:22:06] we need to change where we spend time to
[2:22:08] preserve the vow and the commitment we
[2:22:10] make to you but Lord help us to keep our
[2:22:13] vows give us the strength to stand

[2:46:58] one time and Prophet made a vow that he
[2:47:00] was not going to hunt any more animals
[2:47:02] or something like that I think I don't
[2:47:04] know if you recall that
[2:47:05] but God tested him on
[2:47:08] it and dare come right up to him and he
[2:47:12] promised he said I wouldn't shoot you I
[2:47:14] told God I made a promise that I I
[2:47:16] wouldn't do it they came right up to his
[2:47:19] face and he said I told God I wouldn't
[2:47:21] do it he said go on now go on you know I
[2:47:24] won't do you no no harm and God came
[2:47:27] down and said because you kept your
[2:47:30] promise I'm going to keep mine praise
