[49:00] condition. Speaking of leadership,
[49:32] talkingers
[49:35] leadership and if you move and you're
[49:37] not moving under the leadership
[49:48] of the leadership of the spirit. You
[49:50] will get into trouble and there's some
[49:52] trouble you can get out of there's some
[49:54] trouble you cannot get out of which is
[49:56] why it is so
[49:59] important when we were
[50:12] He was not a priest. He was not a
[50:13] prophet. He was not a king. He was not a
[50:15] soldier. He was not a deacon. He was not
[50:17] a politician. He was
[50:24] not find
[50:33] some of these points in the service.
[50:52] this
[51:06] morning. The entire church service of
[51:10] deliverance and deliverance is
[51:20] just by
[51:23] thinking most of our problems come from
[51:26] the way we think the way we
[51:29] think of
[51:39] oursitut number
[51:52] Amen. Amen. And if you are following,
[51:55] you get in
[51:59] trouble. I have to have your own
[52:02] relationship to know how to
[52:04] follow. And if you are following a move,
[52:07] a friend, a friend, an associate, even
[52:10] church, you can end up in trouble
[52:12] because you can be following the
[52:16] wrong leaders in whatever we are in
[52:20] because we have a direct relationship
[52:21] with God and being led by the spirit
[52:23] allows you to stand alone because you
[52:25] can't be standing alone and be a
[52:27] follower to stand alone to take
[52:32] in a decision that might be contrary to
[52:36] some
[52:38] people say amen.
[52:40] We're going to have a conversation this
[52:42] morning because at the end of this
[52:43] journey I want us to understand that we
[52:45] are under attack and the devil is not
[52:48] going to sit down and allow you to
[52:56] overach and how the enemy will do it and
[52:59] do it this way and do it that way. And
[53:01] if this doesn't work, he come at you in
[53:03] this way. And if this doesn't work,
[53:04] he'll come at you with one
[53:07] objective to get you to
[53:11] recl. If he can't kill you, he tried to
[53:14] throw you into
[53:16] sickness. If he can't get you in, he
[53:19] deceive you, make you feel like you're
[53:21] all right. If he can't do that, he'll
[53:22] distract you. And all of that is
[53:30] inhered by words which if it's one thing
[53:34] we're going to leave here this morning
[53:36] saying I am doing a great work and I
[53:40] cannot come down. What I'm about is too
[53:43] important for me to stop now. I am doing
[53:46] a great work and I
[53:48] cannot come down. There has been too
[53:51] much work put into this for me to not
[53:54] working now. I'm doing a great work and
[53:57] I cannot come down. Don't call me today
[54:00] because I'm doing a great work and I
[54:02] cannot come down. Don't call me on
[54:05] Sunday for whatever you want to do
[54:07] because I'm doing a great work and I
[54:09] cannot come down. Don't call me for
[54:12] family gathering on Sunday morning
[54:14] because I'm doing a great work and I
[54:17] cannot come down. Don't disturb me in my
[54:20] prayer meeting because I'm doing a great
[54:22] work.
[54:23] and I
[54:24] cannot cannot come down. Don't don't try
[54:27] to distract me. Don't try to interrupt
[54:30] me. Don't try to dissuade me. Don't
[54:32] present something attractive to me
[54:34] because I'm doing a great work. It's an
[54:36] important work. There's never been a
[54:38] work like this work. I'm doing a great
[54:40] work and I cannot I refuse I cannot come
[54:45] down. I refuse to come down. We've been
[54:47] building upon faith and virtue and
[54:50] knowledge and I'm building something.
[54:52] I'm doing a great
[54:54] work and I cannot come down. Brick upon
[54:57] brick, we are building
[55:01] something. Can the church say you see
[55:04] where I'm going this
[55:05] morning? This family was hard to build.
[55:08] I'm doing a great work and I
[55:11] cannot come down. I can't leave a post
[55:14] yet. I can't step away from my post of
[55:17] duty. What I'm doing is too important.
[55:20] My lives are depending on it. My family
[55:23] is depending on it. Brother Brham is
[55:25] depending on it. The saints who died and
[55:27] went on, they cannot be made perfect.
[55:30] I'm doing a great work and I cannot come
[55:32] down. I can't stop now. I can't give up
[55:36] praying now. I can't stop worshiping
[55:38] now. I can't stop building now. I can't
[55:41] stop fighting now. I can't walk away
[55:43] now. I cannot give up now.
[55:49] I'm doing a great
[55:51] work and I
[55:53] cannot I cannot
[55:56] come. We will get back to this because
[55:58] it's in context but I want to rewind the
[56:02] tape a bit to talk
[56:04] about because all of us in our roles in
[56:07] our lives in our situations have to
[56:10] become like
[56:20] repeating these
[56:23] things so that we can be established.
[56:30] Jesus's defense against the enemy was
[56:32] the power. His defense was it
[56:35] written. It is written. It is also
[56:39] written. Without power, you could defeat
[56:41] the enemy. If you could stand on the
[56:43] ground of the
[56:45] word because the word is more than
[56:48] powerful enough to defeat the devil any
[56:51] place
[56:57] under any
[57:00] condition. But if you don't know the
[57:06] word, then what will your defense
[57:13] be in your
[57:15] heart? The Holy Ghost comes to give you
[57:18] power. Until that time comes, we
[57:21] have to be able to defend our homes,
[57:25] defend our families, defend our lives,
[57:28] defend our bodies. By his stripes, I am
[57:31] healed that it is written.
[57:34] You have to call upon what
[58:02] he put on your
[58:13] Bible tells us
[58:33] one of my
[58:37] friends. I asked them
[59:12] He's not witness.
[59:36] wall of Jerusalem.
[59:56] He saw the death of his people, the
[59:59] death of the defense of
[1:00:02] Jerusalem. In other
[1:00:05] words,
[1:00:19] there
[1:00:25] is pray.
[1:00:33] Just
[1:00:52] trouble in trouble.
[1:01:16] Financaffected
[1:01:21] tears upon
[1:01:33] We live in a world where people
[1:01:55] left
[1:02:18] it. When I
[1:02:28] message. There's no burden
[1:02:33] for the world. There's
[1:02:41] no time to
[1:02:46] destroy people out.
[1:02:54] While Jerusalem was in
[1:02:59] trouble, one
[1:03:01] man
[1:03:03] is praying
[1:03:15] fast. We find one person
[1:03:19] begin
[1:03:42] to let that air
[1:03:57] children. He put
[1:04:01] himself and my father's
[1:04:04] house
[1:04:06] very kept norm
[1:04:20] I
[1:04:28] was
[1:04:37] there. These are thy servants.
[1:04:49] great to the prayer of thy servants and
[1:04:52] the pray of thy
[1:04:58] servants. I pray
[1:05:07] thee circumstances.
[1:05:43] This was not
[1:06:07] You should never be sad. You should
[1:06:09] never be down. You should never be
[1:06:11] upset.
[1:06:43] You're not
[1:06:47] supposed
[1:06:52] to be there
[1:07:04] consequences. Yes, you have troubles.
[1:07:35] How can
[1:07:36] I be
[1:07:47] happy? One brother is in
[1:07:50] trouble. If one sister
[1:07:54] one
[1:08:00] family in the body is in trouble.
[1:08:37] So the first resping.
[1:09:09] He hates it
[1:09:17] when you hear
[1:09:32] somebody appearing.
[1:09:43] The
[1:09:48] moment there's a rumor that God is about
[1:09:51] to do
[1:10:03] something about your brother or sister
[1:10:13] The
[1:10:19] first
[1:10:21] situation that is
[1:10:33] The problem of this age is
[1:11:01] came up to the
[1:11:15] prophetship that you don't hear me. You
[1:11:19] got to know that you want change. You
[1:11:21] got to know that healing issan.
[1:11:57] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:12:17] Prayer moves. Prayer changes things.
[1:12:21] You want a
[1:12:23] deliverance and respond to
[1:12:30] that
[1:12:42] blesset of the
[1:12:48] hear this
[1:12:50] Somebody help me this morning. May God
[1:12:52] touch the fathers in the house. May he
[1:12:54] touch the daughters in the house. May he
[1:12:56] touch the sons in the house. We are
[1:12:58] seeking the welfare of the walls broken
[1:13:01] down, but we don't want to leave them
[1:13:02] down.
[1:13:04] The enemy has done all he could do, but
[1:13:06] it's time to rebuild. It's time to
[1:13:11] resto
[1:13:12] everything. We take him back. God is
[1:13:14] going to raise up
[1:13:20] some
[1:13:24] seated was not a soldier but he had a
[1:13:27] burden was not a priest but he had a
[1:13:30] burden was not a prophet but he had a
[1:13:34] burden just a
[1:13:36] burden in the house who captures a
[1:13:41] burden a burden a burden for lost soul
[1:13:44] A burden for revival, a burden to
[1:13:46] rebuild, a burden to heal, a burden to
[1:13:50] see families restored, a burden to see
[1:13:52] the sick heal, a burden to see the
[1:13:54] devils cast out, a burden to see a
[1:13:57] revival. burden to see a spiritfilled
[1:14:04] church. Lord, we have enough sick people
[1:14:06] in here that need healing, catch a
[1:14:09] burden this morning that by the end of
[1:14:11] this service, every sick person in our
[1:14:24] midst of praise.
[1:14:28] Hallelujah.
[1:14:34] Satanry also we are here to make a
[1:14:37] church and make a revival. What has been
[1:14:39] broken down must be rebuilt. Behold our
[1:14:41] Elijah the
[1:14:43] prophet of the
[1:14:47] Lord of the fathers. It's a time to
[1:14:49] rebuild to restore to establish to build
[1:14:53] up into the statue of a perfect man.
[1:14:57] church. We're not going to sit down and
[1:14:59] hear that this brother is in trouble and
[1:15:01] let him stay in trouble. No, we're going
[1:15:03] to catch a burden this morning. We're
[1:15:06] going to catch a burden. Where do we
[1:15:07] need to go? What do we need to
[1:15:14] do? I want to encourage
[1:15:20] you. He left with material. He had such
[1:15:24] a testimony on his job that the king
[1:15:27] said, "Whatever you need, take it."
[1:15:35] You had such a testimony in
[1:15:39] his bless.
[1:15:41] God used a pagan enemy to deliver the
[1:15:45] wood.
[1:16:18] everything. You know the Bible
[1:16:31] says what is yours until you have the
[1:16:34] character to handle what is yours.
[1:16:45] learned everything.
[1:16:50] So God knows when he
[1:16:57] work. So now he has built into the
[1:17:00] system for you to
[1:17:16] get. In other words, the owner is you.
[1:17:29] for the kingdom of the walls of
[1:17:31] Jerusalem, for the bridge, for the gate
[1:17:34] that's going down, for the walls that
[1:17:35] are broken
[1:17:46] down.
[1:17:56] Here it
[1:18:14] is. Hallelujah. Jesus.
[1:18:20] Have you come to
[1:18:22] church? Have you come to church prepared
[1:18:25] to answer that if Jesus was a knock on
[1:18:27] your shoulder this morning and say
[1:18:29] whatever you ask for, you're going to
[1:18:30] have it. Do you know what will change
[1:18:33] your home? Do you know what change your
[1:18:35] family? Do you know what change your
[1:18:37] financial situation? You've got to
[1:18:40] know because you ask. That's
[1:18:44] the miss.
[1:18:51] Anybody
[1:19:00] say this?
[1:19:25] There you have it. Watch
[1:19:43] I
[1:20:07] hope you want this.
[1:20:30] Lord, please.
[1:20:48] understand
[1:21:03] what's better for you on this side of
[1:21:06] promotion from man.
[1:21:14] Nehemiah is a Jew.
[1:21:34] Hallelujah.
[1:21:52] Anybody?
[1:22:03] before the king.
[1:22:33] But here it is.
[1:23:07] This is
[1:23:09] about something.
[1:23:14] It's not
[1:23:16] about how we live in church.
[1:23:42] pressure
[1:23:45] compromise. Anybody with me this
[1:23:47] morning?
[1:24:15] This
[1:24:19] was not a
[1:24:22] build situation.
[1:25:02] reaction. Please keep
[1:25:18] for us.
[1:25:25] I'm going
[1:25:27] to
[1:25:41] hope you
[1:26:03] Liberals.
[1:26:45] 4 is an animal. I'm going to
[1:26:58] spoke
[1:27:07] What
[1:27:24] about what kind
[1:27:26] of what kind of
[1:27:53] What is that?
[1:28:16] verse
[1:28:24] build was too important.
[1:28:27] The work was too great. The world was
[1:28:30] too important.
[1:29:00] began to be
[1:29:11] very mocking to now fighting the war
[1:29:15] without you.
[1:29:27] And
[1:29:33] our third
[1:29:36] the enemy
[1:30:01] trying out. But I sh
[1:30:06] to
[1:30:08] declare in the world.
[1:30:12] This work is
[1:30:20] too handicep
[1:30:42] This work is too important. This work is
[1:30:45] too important. We have got to rebuild
[1:30:47] the wall. We have got to rebuild what
[1:30:49] was
[1:30:52] broken.
[1:31:05] Hallelujah.
[1:31:07] Afid people were concerned.
[1:31:12] fighters
[1:31:22] coming and fight for your brethren. If
[1:31:26] you don't want to fight for your
[1:31:28] brethren, your sons and your daughters,
[1:31:31] your wives, and your houses, I'm giving
[1:31:34] you a reason to fight. Fight or
[1:31:38] die. Fight or die. I giving you a reason
[1:31:41] to fight. If you don't want to fight for
[1:31:43] yourself, fight for your brethren. Fight
[1:31:46] for your sons and your daughters and
[1:31:48] your wives and your houses. And the
[1:31:51] church say amen. The enemy tried to stop
[1:31:54] us with anger. He couldn't do it. He
[1:31:56] tried to mock us to stop the work. We
[1:31:58] didn't do it. He's trying to attack us
[1:31:59] to kill us. Let's stand up and fight.
[1:32:04] And the Bible says, "And it came to pass
[1:32:06] when our enemies heard that it was known
[1:32:08] to us." In other words, the enemy was
[1:32:11] hoping that we didn't know they were
[1:32:12] coming. When the enemy he knew what was
[1:32:16] about to happen and we prepared
[1:32:18] ourselves for war. Hallelujah. And God
[1:32:21] had brought their north. In other words,
[1:32:23] they had a plan to take us out. But God
[1:32:26] let us
[1:32:27] know. You don't hear me. Just like when
[1:32:39] Elsa, the prophet
[1:32:47] Elphicight, you don't hear me. The enemy
[1:32:50] doesn't stand a chance because they are
[1:32:52] more for
[1:32:54] us. Every time they try to attack the
[1:32:56] children of Israel,
[1:33:13] Elmen's devices stand a
[1:33:17] chance. He cannot this way. He cannot
[1:33:20] attack us. This way he finished this
[1:33:23] morning. Our swords are in our
[1:33:30] hands. You don't hear
[1:33:32] me. I want you to
[1:33:45] understand you're too weak. You can't do
[1:33:47] it. You can't make it.
[1:33:54] And here it comes
[1:33:56] down. Let's go and kill them when
[1:33:58] they're
[1:34:00] sleeping. And tell
[1:34:07] everybody
[1:34:09] whatever
[1:34:13] go with your sword. Be on point. Don't
[1:34:16] be ignorant.
[1:34:18] If he
[1:34:26] see the sound of the trumpet, look for
[1:34:28] your brother. Look for your sister. Come
[1:34:30] together and fight together. The enemy
[1:34:32] doesn't stand a
[1:34:40] chance. When our ene
[1:34:47] return to the wall.
[1:34:50] Everyone
[1:35:09] seeks
[1:35:14] the rulers all the houses.
[1:35:28] We are soldiers. We are warriors. We are
[1:35:32] fighting for our families. We are
[1:35:33] fighting
[1:35:34] for healing. We are fighting backsiders.
[1:35:38] We are fighting for those that are
[1:35:39] trapped in the world. The enemy thinks
[1:35:41] he has them. But when we put this wall,
[1:35:43] he cannot come in. Understand that the
[1:35:45] wall is to protect us. The wall is our
[1:35:48] defense. The wall is our separation.
[1:36:13] everything. But after
[1:36:16] Sunday, they did something about it. Oh,
[1:36:19] come on
[1:36:21] now. Hallelujah. Glory to God. Come on,
[1:36:26] Sister. Come on, brother. Let's close
[1:36:28] the preaches. Come on, brother. Let's
[1:36:31] close the preaches. Come on, brother
[1:36:32] Thompson. Let's close the
[1:36:35] brides. Every day there's a higher
[1:36:37] brick. There's a brick being added brick
[1:36:40] by brick. The en brick by brick. Every
[1:36:45] is one less space for the enemy to move.
[1:36:47] We are going to cut him off today. We
[1:36:49] going to stop him today. We're going to
[1:36:51] finish the work
[1:37:02] today. Some of you
[1:37:16] What is a preach?
[1:37:47] In other
[1:38:01] words, the wall, we cannot protect you.
[1:38:03] But if you're behind the
[1:38:05] wall, we
[1:38:07] fight. We have the towers. We have
[1:38:10] soldiers on the wall. There are men who
[1:38:12] will not duty to watch the enemy. And
[1:38:16] when you wake up in the morning, there's
[1:38:17] a different group that get into position
[1:38:20] to watch out for the enemy. There's
[1:38:22] safety in Jerusalem. There's comfort in
[1:38:25] Jerusalem. You don't hear
[1:38:28] me. Anybody in the house?
[1:38:53] Everyone
[1:38:56] neither neither I nor my
[1:39:01] brevants nor the men
[1:39:04] which followed me. None of
[1:39:21] us uniform.
[1:39:35] uniform. I'm in my uniform on a
[1:39:43] Sunday
[1:39:45] because you don't hear me when I go to
[1:39:48] work on
[1:39:50] Tuesday
[1:39:52] or uniform.
[1:40:23] realized at
[1:40:25] all. What can I try?
[1:40:34] Please.
[1:41:18] Hallelujah.
[1:41:41] [Music]
[1:41:45] Imagine your cousin to your worldly
[1:41:48] friend.
[1:41:50] You have lost your
[1:41:51] appetite for the things of the
[1:42:13] world. The war was attempt to kill it
[1:42:15] before it finished. All of this has
[1:42:17] failed.
[1:42:18] Enemy
[1:42:46] knows us
[1:43:01] together. The enemy
[1:43:28] Send me.
[1:43:51] This is
[1:44:08] not the most diplomatic moment.
[1:44:17] I'm not
[1:44:19] accepting. I am
[1:44:34] doing a
[1:44:39] distracted call when I have church.
[1:44:46] I
[1:44:51] cannot work. You may not see it. You may
[1:44:54] not understand it. You may not like it.
[1:44:56] But I'm doing a great work. And I cannot
[1:45:32] It's
[1:45:39] notice I'm trying to distract
[1:45:51] was a
[1:45:55] plant. So it was
[1:46:22] What is it?
[1:46:44] You have destroyed a
[1:47:09] Your actions
[1:47:12] behavior when you spend time reflect
[1:49:20] That's good.
[1:49:55] Every single one of
[1:50:09] us Africa.
[1:50:15] What
[1:50:21] people
[1:50:27] successful Facebook
[1:50:44] born. Not
[1:50:49] every good work.
[1:51:16] What is
[1:51:24] your
[1:51:29] finent
[1:51:32] that there are some people when they
[1:51:44] remember the mother of Johnesley did a
[1:51:57] great
[1:52:01] purpose. And if you do not know your
[1:52:04] You will spend your
[1:52:10] time. You cannot achieve
[1:52:15] anything. This is a call to action for
[1:52:17] the church. You
[1:52:24] cannot make a
[1:52:26] church. That is not something that
[1:52:28] happens organically. It is even a
[1:52:38] great understand.
[1:53:11] because
[1:53:13] he wanted to
[1:53:22] situation. What is your excuse? You have
[1:53:25] to know you are doing a
[1:53:31] great
[1:53:50] asal. I am doing a great
[1:53:57] work. It's a wake up call to all of us.
[1:54:22] What is happening in my home is too

[2:15:39] That's a great
[2:15:56] amnotes. That's a great
[2:16:09] the person I used to be. I'm not what

[2:19:24] that is on the
[2:19:25] earth that brings on the resurrection.
[2:19:28] Isn't that a
[2:19:31] great church?
[2:19:35] But there
[2:19:37] must be dynamics and mechanics
[2:19:40] together. I am doing a great work and I
[2:19:46] cannot preach anything. We cannot preach
[2:19:49] anything.

[2:22:22] in. I'm doing a great work and we are
[2:22:25] almost finished.
[2:22:27] to our 52
[2:22:29] days. The work started when the prophet
[2:22:31] left. But when the prophet left, the
[2:22:33] angel didn't leave. The angel was here
[2:22:34] all along directing our steps all the
[2:22:36] way from the east, from the west, from
[2:22:38] the north, from the south. He is our
[2:22:40] Nehemiah. He is our director. He is the
[2:22:42] captain of the host.
[2:23:09] He didn't have to
[2:23:10] go this knew it was a great work and he
[2:23:14] couldn't
[2:23:16] come
[2:23:19] down and abandon it but stood

[2:32:42] needs in the house, but Lord, all of us

[2:32:47] guilty of stepping away from
[2:32:49] our many of us have stepped down into
[2:32:53] things that we're not supposed to be.
[2:32:55] But Lord, this morning we want to be
[2:32:57] renewed, restored. We want to rededicate
[2:32:59] our lives to realize the greatness of
[2:33:02] the world. If there's a backslide in our
[2:33:04] midst, Father, may be a turning point
[2:33:06] for them. Someone who's been struggling,
[2:33:09] Lord, may today be a turning point for
[2:33:10] them. May you break every chain, break
[2:33:13] every shackle, break every hindrance,
[2:33:15] and may we, Lord, make this our pledge
[2:33:18] that we are doing a great work and we
[2:33:20] cannot come back. Lord, may you be with
[2:33:22] your children today. Father, may your
[2:33:24] Holy Ghost Lord do something powerful
[2:33:26] and special with your people in the
[2:33:28] precious name of Jesus Christ. Amen.
