upon your life amen oh praise the Lord God bless you thanks are coming god bless you welcome one and all we so glad to be in the house of God this morning we want to go straight to the word if I have your Bibles I like a return to Luke chapter 17 we want to read verse twenty to thirty we want to turn after the first Corinthians chapter four 1 verse death was twenty and we want to read mark 16 it was 15 to 20 so Luke chapter 17 reading from verse 20 and when he was demanded of the Pharisees when the kingdom of God should come he answered them and said the kingdom of God commit not with observation neither shall they say lo here or lo dear for behold the kingdom of God is within you and he said to his disciples the days will come when you shall desire to see one of the days of the Son of Man and shall not see it and they shall say to you see here see there go not after them nor follow them for as the lightning that lightened out of one part on the heaven shun it unto the other part on the heaven so shall also the Son of Man be in his day but first must he suffer many things and be rejected of this generation and as it was in the days of Noah so shall have also been the days of the Son of Man they did eat they drank they married wives they were given in marriage until the day that noe entered into the ark and the flood came and destroyed them all likewise also as it was on these of lot they did eat they drank they bought they sold they planted they builded but the same day that lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from hell and destroy them all even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of Man is revealed and first Corinthians chapter 4 verse 24 the kingdom of God is not in word but in power murder again for the kingdom of God is not in word but in power our last scripture from mark 16 verse 15 and he said unto them go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature he that believed in his baptized shall be saved he that believeth not shall be damned these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover and so then after the Lord had spoken unto them he was received up into heaven and southern on the right hand of God and they went forth and preached everywhere the Lord working with them and confirming the word with signs following may God blesses wood let's pray one more time father we have read your word and any man can read scriptures Lord but I take the Holy Spirit to come and breathe life into it Lord we pray the breath of God would breathe life into your people Lord that is son like a mighty much an army granted Lord in Jesus and my Oscar amen you may be seated and I just said don't give God some praise welcome again is good to be in a house of God always good to be in God's house this more important than your job whom family this is where you get divine instructions this is where you come under covenant this is where you get the connection with the supernatural but the protection with a word with a direct the seer the Lord into your life or glory to God not everybody's ordained to speak into your life but God have ministry to speak into your life by the Word of God the right things that you must hear coming into your life we believe that whatever title this morning call back to the original faith the bride that's a title called back to the original faith the bride and I've an inspiration faith is the key that lock unlocks every treasure in the kingdom of God faith is the key that unlocks every treasure in the kingdom of God hallelujah now the script we read first Corinthians chapter 4 verse 20 and the amplified every script we read for the kingdom is not in word but in power but in the amplified is written for the kingdom of God consists of and is based not on talk but on power moral power and excellence of soul Alleluia that's when we talk about the kingdom of God John was preaching the kingdom of God is at hand Jesus was preaching the kingdom of God my kingdom is not of this world so he was presenting people another Kingdom that they never saw they never heard about they never experienced and he was about to introduce the name this thing called the kingdom of God because they were living in the kingdom of this world but he was talking about a higher level a higher order a higher world called the kingdom of God amen no mystery back so describing Pharisees they demanded of him when the kingdom should come this came when it should come and Jesus said the kingdom come it not with observation so what you're looking for you're looking for clothes you're looking for they look at what what are you looking for looking for this he looking for that but what are you looking for you see he said behold the kingdom is within you oh my hallelujah so he was dismissing all the physical and notable things to precede the kingdom of God come in and he said this kingdom had to be within you but that itself is a revelation how does the kingdom come into someone because God's object is to get the kingdom within you and we find out what was above us pillar fire Moses time God with us and Jesus Christ and then the Holy Ghost come into you and Jesus told them I if I don't go the comforter will not come and I am the comforter which is the power which is the dynamics is not with you but it shall be in you so I have to get some way to reconnect you to the power that's supposed to come within you you don't have it no but you have there to get you don't have it no but you have a promise of it you don't have it yet but you're gonna get it because it was something in you to receive it you can't get it if there's nothing on you to receive it you have to have the ability to receive so God put the receiver inside you first and cover that receive I'm a dirty with mud with filled with unbelief with all kind of things around that but it's still inside of you you went to hell you went to trials went to tribulations but it's still there you fall sick but it's still there somebody can go crazy but it's still there nothing can change that because that God put that seed in your soul and the devil don't have the authority to go inside your soul he can mess with your mind he can mess with your body but he can't mess with your soul that she has predestinated that she is elected [Applause] let me say it again he could fool with your body he could fool with your spirit but he cannot fool with those soul because only the word is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart the devil is not the word he cannot go inside of your heart and mess up inside our dear God but that German Saturday that's why he told her who you are he didn't know who Jesus was he keeps saying Toby and Toby if they'll be he watching your stinking flesh and misinterprets and who you are because of what you was because what you're doing right now but he's not seeing what you had to become look at the Lord a shout hallelujah he's trying to nail you by your failures he's trying to nail you by your sins he's trying to nail you by your past but God already consider your future already done so he told you before the foundation of the world and he's not gonna lose you he's not Pointer hallelujah maybe season he's not going to undo his choice before I was even born he said Jacob I love he so I hate Oh glory to God because he knew what they will do and God knew what you're gonna do glory to God you know you will repent yes yes yes you know you're gonna make things right he's not gonna say I am sorry forgive me he know all of that before you even lorina God hallelujah oh boy we love God hallelujah glory to God hallelujah hallelujah glory to God fire is in the building you may be seated you think God didn't see your life messed up piled up tangle up and wrapped up and all kind of foolishness you think Gore didn't understand that why do you think a life get so messed up and tied up they'd ever want to finish you a long time do they will always try to cut off potential because once I get into maturity he is finished or glory to God that's why I kill all them babies - yes and under kill what is the potential but once you come into maturity is finished because he had a prophecy handle over you at that day Saint John 14 20 you shall know I am in the father you and me and I in you the devil don't you just come to that day but that day is coming for you or give the Lord a shout the devil told want you to come to that day [Applause] because that day brings you some partial realization into perfect realization that that brings you know I'm impact that you will know as you unknown okay the Lord a show maybe see you maybe season the way God know you is the how your father knew you or your mother knowing you or your husband or you or your wife know you the way God know you is different people see you a sinner but when Jesus was praying he said father won't glory record you they were with me before the world was keep them keep them keep them keep them Oh tell the Lord a show revelation is breaking in this morning maybe season God is not now waking up this morning and getting an idea I want to help them a fiddle he'll pitch this morning I want to bless them I feel and blesses God is not waking up there an idea about who you are no no no no no all that the father Hat pastels given me shall come not maybe not perhaps shall come I'm gonna lose none of them Porter loses thoughts that is eternal that's the pack patterns mine I don't care what adultery what lie what phony case and what until living how much man how much man you live with it doesn't matter that's why he found the woman of the well that's why I called the prostitute act in adultery that's why you from rehab that's ready for all them believers all through the ages he found them because the name was on the book and Satan Lucifer himself can't stop you from coming forth I am confident this morning that the one who start to work in you is ever is able to complete that he's not finished with you yet Teletubbies Alya God is not finished with you yet [Applause] the be seated [Applause] Jesus Jesus already said the kingdom that come for observation so you can't go him some bush somewhere on some money somewhere with some old clothes meet anybody come on the Lord bring some bond covered some tinned food stuck enough with God come in those four regions plant like he come in live like you come in tomorrow climb like could come in twenty years from now normal is not abnormal live a normal living Jesus even said as wasn't Lisa no he said they eat they

something there if you don't empty dude open oh look you open the door it's empty but if they have treasures behind that door you have to put a lock on it the carpod jokey look anybody just pick that lock you have to put a special kind of a look because they don't want no teeth breaking inside ideas so quad lock up the kingdom he locked up healing he locked up our he locked up gifts even shut up the heavens and all he's a wait til them seven thunders after the voices that a cube [Music] they're gonna slice and cut that means seven thunders get faith and faith is the key done luck Paulina God

ready key and academic intensive the key you wait the e ready key made or the thing that we purpose of a key the key have ad or your try destroyed hope is not that goes for that key you have to get the right key for the right door but there's only one door to the kingdom and Jesus said I am the door or give the Lord a show give the Lord a show there is one door and you have to get the key to

surely goodness and mercy shall follow me [Applause] no starting to get excited all glory to God hallelujah the next time come to me here let me just check this out oh boy in Oh God before we this one year can we read this year look at in it after Luke 17 today son of man revealed himself he said when the Son of man cometh shall he find faith on earth is that a faith or fear [Music] it is that two things Fiat or fear this gospel come to remove the fear from you because it cannot be perfected on the fear it is made perfect by love you have to comment and love for faith to be perfected you can operate on the fear see how the devil theory market appeased a depressed common dog and feared it closed only churches fear for what he did well it in the secret place of the Most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty I will say of the Lord he is my refuge and my fortress my god in him will I trust surely he will deliver thee from the snare of the Fowler from the noisome pestilence he shall cover thee with his feathers under his wings shalt don't trust his truth shall be thy shield and buckler thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night nor the arrow that's fired by day nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness nor for the destruction that wasteth at noonday a Thousand shall fall and I say and thousand at thy right hand but it shall not ninety-two ahead shout in the house how many going to agree with that how many could unite themselves with this word therefore more evil befall thee neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling for he shall give his angels charge over thee to keep thee in all thy ways Oh glory to God hallelujah [Applause] [Music] this is our premise not virus coming and play coming to come in but our promises sons of always stop the plagues stop the virus stop whatever coming that's the power that God wants in the sons of God or glory does not run from the Sun run for stop it [Applause] behold there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon the same man was just a devout waiting for the consolation of Israel and the Holy Ghost was upon him and it was revealed unto him by the Holy Ghost that he will not see that until the Lord see the Lord scrap this revelation brought feet which brought an expectation for manifestation so faith is the talk have faith what are supposed to do a revelation brings expectation for something faith is the key to get you to where you're going the Bible says faith is the substance of what you're hoping for so a lot of things people think they have they really don't have because they make you act different talk different live different see different [Applause] [Music] there must be feet to accompany expectation and there are only two elements in the world that controls the wood tonight fear and feet Russia is trying to get everybody to fear them and we are trying to get everybody to have faith in God that's the difference that is the two element control nations control all people control all churches control individual it is fear or faith I wanted to do it today but it was just I just simply do it what a glass here for you and put it halfway with water in it and ask you what you see so could imagine a glass here and it's halfway and I asked what do you see and some will say I'll see a glass half full and somebody's will see I see a glass half empty psychologists will say the person will say half empty is negative base the person will see how full is positive base but both of what the scene is right the half empty person seen as halfway down to finish the half full person seen is halfway down the fault to get it up what do you see it comes a question of perspective so if your perspective in life is negative its affects your marriage its effect how you view the world it affects how you see others because your base is negative Jesus taught us to get these guys under one base which is under the promise of God which is always positive I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you a little while the world's yet me no more but you shall see me and because I live shakily also all this promises is positive all this promise is true you shall receive power after the Holy Ghost is come upon you Oh glory to God hallelujah all this promises it's true you shall be delivered you shall be free you shall be delivered Oh glory the courser and God bring promises is real it is true it is tyreq to you or glory to God so God is trying to change your mind if we can get you to change your mind your entire life changes your entire world changes your perspective changes oh you see brethren oh you see a husband how you see a wife how do you see cause order or glory the hood because part of our order he say husband love your wife or glory to goddess cross-program wife's objections after your husband is you can't do that y'all to order or hallelujah because good after speak to him you're praying for him to get revelation inspiration discernment and power because you want them to be under power not under your mouth well get the Lord I shall go get me started this morning don't get me started this morning you want that money allowed to be under the power of God under the influence of God [Applause] fear has no value to it it's perfectly unless it hasn't got one good thing about it if I was to be shot in the morning I was going to be

looking on building on further than them do so touch after once they get very accurate so that's a big target we miss the target when Goliath see there that so because see you see you see Galactus on

against my feet there's only one feet there's only one Lord there's only one baptism no people say well I have a faith and I go to my own church but that's not what Judas speaking of here he is talking to the people that contend for the faith don't forget it not a state not necess it a defect that was once delivered to the Saints you have to contend fit and fight fit now if we can only find out here we go what defeat is then we can ill Missy contend for that fate is that right hallelujah if we can find out what what the fear is then we can only see concern for that fate what deviant now the fate was once a liver to the scene so if you go back to where they were called sins and find out what kind of fate they had we will know more or less what they content for now when the church was called Saint they were called sanctified hallelujah see it means clean pure holy on adultery and so forth that was the beginning of the church when was inaugurated under their Pentecost now let's look what they had back tear what the church contended for you know June wouldn't be talking about the Old Testament on the Levitical laws he is a Christian he was talking about when the church was set in order was inaugurated on the day of Pentecost now we will notice what kind of fate that they had they had a faith here we go in a resurrected living Christ someone who rose from the dead and was living among them that wasn't a man on Velen teachings and revelations and mysteries not that the Living Christ resurrected among them they knew he was among them when they come to church to not just come at the church they come to see him moving in and out then healing the sick him casting out Devils all glories of God one time but a brand walk in Germany didn't preach as he walk in Cooper said

praising and blessing God continually shall God continually every time they're just praising understand God what were they doing they will create an atmosphere now you want solution to your family

she went there too Peter was dead John was there what are you saying the pastor was there the Apostle was here the Prophet was there three factions was there the believers was there all man Jack was up earlier there was waiting for power or chlorine oh god nobody exempted nobody else cluded be that yeah say I am Peter I feel had to go out and take a walk no stay there until stand the word until stand the promise on until you with power from on high Paul vomit hi I don't want to man explain to me I have power I want power from on high not power from explanation okay the Lord a shout a member englette explain it over generally re power ya see it comin somebody said about fight or missile incoming the door I said come in a simile have it well you have it sure you have it the kind place are to take no signs no want to makers and their power some you feel the adopted alone because of some some biblical long time they speak of would be any kind of word they speak and they speak a word Lord it was you sometimes sometimes sometimes I'll get frightened you see less like a little too much today amplifier and this and that and lights and whatnot or bunch of lights that mess up want to be following you I see a light I didn't see it so I can follow me so don't often alight look for your life to be changed [Applause] you want these life you don't want to be blessed you want a transformation when Jacob let me see Jacob tricking everybody mother-in-law fight a lot you name it Iike trick because this is neat yeah he's a real rapport factious but he's a son it has some ripple artists were sons now if you watch the artistry and it watch the behavior you will close it I doesn't know but Gordo see us man see so that's why when you have strange eyes you don't like this one your blood catalyst one you need help you need to deliverance you need that not like a demon to be cast out because Gordon loved you as you are but he's not really let me remain as you are he is changing you for what you are to what you had to become or glory to God and this purpose and desire is that you be conformed to the image of his son you have your nature and he of his nature you might be a man like Peter was an aggressive man a bold man learning that you will be to come there are people who are aggressive the sick people acquire there's a bit of a shine that's your nature but he have his nature and all of us have to be partakers of his divine nature so his nature has to come into you and that will take out your shyness that will take all this but will take out your anger and temper because you are surrendering his nature and his nature is a nature of power man was destined to have power man is supposed to be in power or grow in that polo and another but power very creeping things over sickness over devils over diseases man one Power Man or glory decorum before God give power you have to show power over you come on say Amen somebody you have to have power over you [Applause] and the first stage of getting power over you is when you could own your behavior i'ma say it again when you could own up to your behavior because decisions produces actions and actions of consequences and when you reap the fruit of your consequences being based upon your actions then you have a decision whether to make excuses or own up the prodigal son was not wrong and asking his father for money that was his right he was a son he had access to the father and what was his own he's taking my portion now I don't want to wait till they're dead just do me know I feel I could be responsible for what you give me he was not ready he was not mature he went a far country deliberately so nobody can monitor or give account in his behavior actions he spend his money wisely and then he find himself in the pic then call he can pay no more rent he broke he tell people now where he is living they seen the big mansion they are seeing the hot there Cindy found behind the homes so as far as he friends concerned he live in a bigger house he just said come on up and spending these days that time money is done money is finished no more pizza no more KFC no more outside diamond they just not seen him he say he taken a sabbatical he taken a rest that time is there none lajjun any pigsty eating pig slop and he was so proud that's the father's killer he pray he was so proud he didn't pick food for a while but style maybe blisters and put some ketchup on it but eaten pigs until he came to himself until he came to himself and began to accept responsibility for the fruit and consequences of an accent is that I will arise I will say unto my father I have sinned anima or give the Lord a show this is the problem here I know personally many people don't accept the behavior no acceptance say you are responsible no not me I'm not take enough of that and I said I take enough have you first response I remember talking of a New York about the time and I open my radiator and blow up and I get boom still have things from it and I was saying I was responsible for that I'm not a child [Music] you definitely hold my hand and said I didn't want to but the devil hold my hair no no no devil in that that is me and folly and I get boon for my fault you I know better than that before you touch that pour water on it before you touch that had a cloth to open that that was foolishness and I was responsible and pay for that they become as I see it right in turn Lucifer don't know I came from I got burned painfully and Lucifer sin I was not there I did not touch him I did not tell him to do that he did that on his own even see it an ordinary night and this is the first time me telling the truth to begin with because because I am lying if I say that I know better than that and you know better than that to stop lying be honest with yourself accept responsibility for your behavior tell the Lord a show and whenever you begin to accept responsibility behavior that is the first step for you to be changed that's how you're going to be changed you cannot change at all if you're not prepared to accept you may feel as a wife it's not really a failure you do what you know you may feel as a husband it's not ready a failure or a father or mother maintain they try the best there's no school of motherhood there's no school of fatherhood there's no school of husband and wife there's none you do your best you say away as I say and you didn't see it right and whatnot but if you get the tools you would have done better and you have to forgive yourself there's another problem we people have people turn forgive their own self you have to come to a spot where you could forgive you because if you can't forgive you the devil will wipe you out because you will always walk under a condemnation but there are no condemnation to them who are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit somebody get them free insider this morning somebody going free insider this morning be honest with your actions when you start to accept responsibility then you could say Lord change me why do I say that Jacob his nature was a ripoff thing he's tricking everybody and treated until he came to the endgame because all these have an EM you know people don't understand that so now when I was creeping Street I'll tell I'm used to look at that young people they don't know next 40 years of know that tall spiky shoes that they were in and I figured I had the balance and played gymnastics with us they went flats next 40 years perfect flats if they don't weigh them flats they will fall when they fall they win Hospital and at that age a bones to meander normal so right now dance Tillis and because they have uten the bones they could balance and them stilts that the walking on but all that comes to an end 40 50 years from them did not seem that so Jacob when he met the angel because afterwards he recognized his fear ezel all this money all this wealthy have all the land and house and everything he conquer and he filled me powerfully family so cord already naked boy you could admire he know you report from money that he Republic all family he know he not right and the other face is so any frightening fear grip room insanity what said we send babies and then God catch him alone for the first time most cellphone he said my cellphone at all either one a nobody no YouTube no Facebook just take up the moopan and then God came to him when he volunteer in Jersey poor you the just last week and I reasoned I see a lot of other prayer you know I never steal anything from the man next door maybe one you know but and you could talk about Hannah talk but Jacob wasn't that foolishness he was so desperate he said I am Jacob I am no good I need a change of life I want a blessing I want a sprinklin I want some preacher I believe you richer no no no I want a change of life [Applause] and the angel lay hands upon shaker me say ah you have it no no no no no cancel take a chicken satay wrestle it just like gonna have to go because it not yet not yet I had the gab listen before you leave I don't want to get testimony since ameeta hindi ameesha LC but angel told me you know Jacob and so on no no he don't want that kind of testimony that testimony too easy emitter in said it tell me this what about the change walk after your meeting angel the life change you know same life just put didn't obey the angel I know we come from but when Jacob hold on to the danger he say I will not let you go until you bless me that's when they're getting serious and listen he had to wrestle all night long my god II locked the angel by the foot he sleep out he hold him by the neck he's reported by his ways not as well as catch a handle there and Paula until dear and he grabbed a hand here I went in 2010 I'm a holy shoulder me get my shoulder lock I might even jailbreak or that I behaved my waist look so he gave my metal up the falling on the ground hallelujah my foot lock or cogito bird wrestling Oh glory to God all night long if this reaction if you see anybody work their roles so they're all city left the roles anyway he doesn't let me go he said no not until you bless me come on same as somebody if you want this thing you prepare to wrestle the kingdom of God is preached and every man every man every man rest away into it come on brother sister you better press on into the kingdom of God [Applause] Oh glory to God this message more longer talk about pressing this message Northover talk about wrestling this message no longer talk about meeting this pillar fire all you hear about some man coming to bring some word oh god help us tonight this is to give you faith to activate the plug that you promised the Cora conserve this is the give me affair so they have faith in a resurrection live in Christ someone who rose from the dead and was even among them just the same as he was before he ever died there wasn't content for some historical of fear Oh God weather history church what songs always the same well it come from what I doing good now like I know when I go overseas and preach overseas and songs I bless them to do it across there but how you listen to them I can explain who whole fire fallen Africa and it blessing that were here but then you are your problems you gotta connect with what happen across there you have to connect with what happened right here so I will talk about all them things of love that yes support they see me up there like Superman and you know I am normal man no keep no s so I stay put I suppose I come at a big cape and a big s here Superman you say so I you know I'm not Superman and I know unless woman so I ain't any soup you up with Superman Superman have to have stand yet to have cape and do all other stuff but when you know who Jesus is that he is you Superman and you want him among us then whether I am here or not here you're looking for him you understand that whether I am here or not here it doesn't matter God isn't a miss of his people oh god I want to free you up Oh God you're close enough you're close to it you know that's a little more again in the break room let's continue you see there wasn't contended for some historical affair but they were contending for the living Christ our resurrected one who was in your midst so what good will it do to tell people where we come from in Thailand history of the church and all the trials we've been true and how it tries to build Istres and then every new come Pope everybody would come we had informed him the whole history nobody Bible say you know the Bible have a parable of men who worked in the field some early morning they see penny can eat and eat honey and on the last time last holiday they see some fellas slackers they say no I'm doing nothing you say you want to work one more over to work penny you say are we going to work they make butter wait who was working hold it hold a ones except a penny when come to pay they start with the last I saw the Peden penny Holy Ones looking for penny plus master-disciple agree to offer penny is he simply God not selfish the same pair Peter had the same day Paul had we going to have quarter chitinous and cinahl again assent and then a penny the same paid damn hat we have to have what is talking about silver and gold have I none such as I have I give it unto you rise up and walk in the name of Jesus Christ yeah we have to have it that's what we're talking about what a random says he said yet a little while they will see me no more you shall see me the church the believer I'll be with you even in you to the end of the world no that was the Apostles believed they believed that he was in the flesh he was also more in the spirit that is what they taught that is what they believed that is what they practiced that is what God confirmed he was in the fresh no he's more in the spirit that's what they believe now when your family walk inside of here the very full service dog is out of here there are 19 the presence of power but do something for them that they will know God is dealing with your hearts you don't have to tell a word the spirit speaking to them directly give the Lord a shout I have not don't you love one we delivered alone I know cancer and miniskirts right now at a smoking tanti under smoking my one and on drugs God will deliver them he went to prove he is God and your faithfulness and your faith and blood is not in vain you have to believe the same what about him he said you know I like this that says what they believed that is what they practiced that is what God confirmed but during this time this 33 years of laughs they became many false brethren not few many false brethren who raised up and brought in heresies and brought people off the theology and different things like that and all had a private revelation because they want to get big up they want to get high up the one people see them a certain way so therefore the exercise of their knowledge people oh I never hear a true and if I see it so never cease console but did he supposed it's the Lord was working with them when they speak what confirm if they don't noodle explanation of that the manifestation was the interpretation it had mobilized to explain or the government war well you know if I went all him out and I remind my winning man Jesus heal and it's they say God heal the sick or the man was blind no easier gdgs is the sinner so to say Jesus heal they say quote here Jesus a man say whether he mother said I don't know but this one thing I know I once was blind but now I see explain that to me all this in a talk and sinner talk and he off the word and he had it off the word but I was not blind but now I see no steeple she has contrary not because they know us you know not because they hear what we preach and I know because somebody tell them that not know for silence no first-hand information they think we off like one man channel myself often if I think I say listen we have over how much tips on YouTube I say finally one message just one when I preach off the wood just one I said all the messages are unedited it's unusual it's not highly demeanor Hyden and seen anything and Trinity no be seen is unedited it's right there for anybody to listen to it and see if will preach in the world or in a preach in the world Oh hallelujah couldn't send nothing after that no Chloe they got all these years that that's my statement avoid you know that's why I like the court the world I am a reader I call to this thing I call to preach by this I am a reader hallelu a long time people smile Capricorn in reason you know what are doing here opinion promises because I have a revelation Peter said by

King within the camp so during the time there came many fourth bedroom who raised up and brought into heresies and what people of the theology and if anyone he said god help us to have that kind of credential today let us contend for the feet the true faith that was once delivered to the Saints the Saints believes in the dead burial and resurrection they believe in the baptism of the Holy Spirit let me pause here a minute the Prophet said you can have the bat-signal goes 24 hours every day and still be lost what is he talking about you could be baptized on your spirit you could be baptized in your flesh or you can be baptized in your soul so that 24 hours being lost is not for the Soul so teachings are going on the ceiling you're sure you don't need a baptismal holy ghost because it Baptist was not the real thing he says because you are son you were to receive the spirit the spirit that making you my son this spirit is empowering you as a son but Peter didn't bypass the upper room and say have a seat on his soul at only the upper room he needed the upper room he needed the power house he needs to be activated in the anointing you need this power let me say it again you need it [Applause] you know what this boys this is power to pray I want the little holy life power to overcome power to forgive power to make things right or for evil God power to live power to add the list of the life let me check my descriptions upon scriptures as many receive him to them gave he power not more laptop power the kingdom is nothing letter power well glory to God the kingdom is preached is a kingdom of power or glory to God God's kingdom is a kingdom of power and before you to be subject to the king you have to come into the kingdom because the king is responsible for everybody in the kingdom or come and preach back to me somebody Oh hallelujah hallelujah the reason is called a kingdom is what is a king and the dumb part is the domain is the king of all domain and

the tango with jealousy you have to have the blood or forgiveness god help me [Applause] this fit that is the key to lock this door this feat is based on forgiveness and Jesus said when you stand praying forgive if you have a ought you drop it somebody do you something and sometimes nobody are doing at you know you do your self but if somebody do you you forgive them God not testing them go testing you [Applause] you Hollenbeck is healing with unforgiveness you holding back your breakthrough with unforgiveness you holding back your deliverance not forgiving you have got to forgive I don't care what they did look what they did Jesus he says Father forgive them they know not what they do or give the Lord a show it is based upon forgiveness [Applause] forgive us of our sins as we forgive those that trespass against us [Applause] or glory glory people who call us up Christians and still it flow still bitter you may be seated one of the worse things could get a touch to you is bitterness I was sharing something with my son I said listen there's a way to handle rejection so I'm gonna give somebody advice and I turn it down and then I take somebody else good at my advice on the ticket and you get offended because take it personal there listen to you and look what the bearment this and that and that and you take it personal then you get bitter and angry bitterness the squeeze the spirit out that's right don't ever listen business good land but do that stay somebody that gets you mad as hell but don't let stay the person could mess with your head but don't let him build a mess on your head torch will come but don't let that stay free yourself from that [Applause] free yourself from all man forgive them god bless you so much forgive them God love you so much forgive them Lord let it go let it go let it go don't know why I'm saying that this morning but let it go you've got to let it go come on you inside of here I think in your heart that you have to let

about you god I love that but see how you will not deal with that and once you're ready for your healing ready for your deliverance ready for the baptism the Holy Ghost you are ready to forgive [Applause] some of you need to forgive yourself a [Music] hardy human and that what is it truth some of you need to forgive yourself let me say it again some of you need to forgive yourself I can't do that for you Jesus himself said behold I stand at door knock If any man would open the door of that door is have enough on the inside he's not going to break down your door you are going to choose to love you are going to choose to forgive it's a choice I have in my heart to share something with you I didn't plan do it today about certain principles and what has kept me over the years and to share some tips if I could call it or whatever it is Oh what has he me over the years I like the power of choice I like the power of decision I'll see the fruit of decision with actions and the consequences of that when you choose to love and choose to forgive it changes everything you're not looking for reward I scratched my back I scratch your back because I will you scratch mine no no we're not talking about the ice crush my your back because your back needs to be scratched I help you because I want to help you I choose to help you so there is no reproach Oh God let's help him I have her I look what she's doing no no you have none of that you do it because they want to you do it because they choose to because when God was helping you he did it because he wanted to he wish you this song that said when you reach down his hand for me I was lost and undone without God or his son when he reached on his hand for me or glory to God hallelujah how could you forget that how could you forget where God brought you from hallelujah don't you ever forget that and usually when people get blessed to forget God because alimony get ammo Hoffa SMO higher order and more disarm or that and they forget God but God want to reach you so but but Ivan said his faith God want somebody the more he get blessed is the more humble he becomes it's a tough combination because normally when we get blessed to get puffed up you get oversized they don't care no more when God when there was in tears when if they forget when when when when the others was driving them to service when they get the kadek they do want to pick up somebody to bring them to church but if I get when other people was given another hiker service but when they get a car to have the news up in the air and the making style I am either knock anybody or me to say it I had sure in worse for me to say it you have to remember where you come from or glory to God he brought me off the merry clear he set my feet upon a rock Christine he put a shock in my soul today Oh glory to God hallelujah I remember look what a gorge right here he will never forget that I was in Belmont she was in KY well at a pump pump pump gas lamp in those days go to the well and get water and and before we even build this smaller wooden church was up in a house pumping gas lamp and praying it's right up this way so my first vision I heard a travel walk into KY well I'll have about three people in service and brother George tell me you say why why didn't still you will leave quite from bellman p2g people told him I say when you repent go go forgive you and he repented next day because I didn't come to keep you people I came to preach the word it didn't matter it were three people well from them three people we have a group here now a church here now you see we don't know why God will take us when we broke into brotherly kindness 1981 it was a vision was a premium and I showed this vision and I saw a sheet drop down and even words the second commercial awareness and I went to find that message to find out if that was a message preached by brother Branham and was and then that message you see when the church finds its brother love when it's chill Phi holds and I said church this have to be revealed and God broke the revelation and then pour it on top of it listen carefully God brought the revelation and put this spirit on top of it that changed my life completely and I can't hold out against anybody I could bus it to your face I could tell you like it is but there's not one behind that I could slam me on the ground and roll on the floor with you but there was not one behind that I still love you but I will tell you the truth I wouldn't fool you I wouldn't I'm a guy I will tell you the truth because the truth alone would set you free so I'm not going to set you up if a cappella truth I may as well get on the pulpit ok Fatah be honest with you act a be honest with God won't give the Lord some breezes or glory that God hallelujah so certain things are like part of me is green inside of me I hope that I could impact and share some of it with you along life's journey that you could be empowered in your marriage in your as a husband as a wife as a father as a mother that you could be effectively empowered to deal with your challenges and issues or glory to God Amen see I can tell you love your wife and I not loving minds you go have a problem with brothers talking nights and sisters and between diseases nice and I catch either wife nice that's a problem that's a serious problem because charity because at home so that love how to express love is not talking him for poor soul of the world you say Oh Paula Danube unknown I'm not talking he gave His only begotten Son so love is not talk I will say better than the Bell till till you ring it it may look like a bell but it was not nothing inside to make me noise as song as there are something to sing it it could be a poem love is not love until you could give it away love wasn't given for you to stay love was given for you to give it away so you have to give love not you're looking for love looking for love is a final any wrong person come to introduce you to love don't look for love receive love receive God's love be empowered love get off your selfishness and as soon as you begin to look out for others the quadrille look out for you I don't know why I'm saying all these thing but a punch I don't know why I am inside out there this morning but as soon as you begin to look out for others gobble look what for you or look

to begin to fall away Jewish said that men of all was foreordained to do this now God is suffering of course he is not willing that any should perish but at all might come to repentance but in order to be God he has to know and he does know before the thing ever come to pass who would be sieve and who would not yes sir listen we need every step ladder every stepping stone we need everything the building here we go over the glass is still in making and when it is completed this gospel is preached to every kindred Tala nation then Jesus will return we pass top 20 trucks ante ology around the world but the gospel is not the Bible altogether Paul said the gospel came to us nothing would only but you power and demonstration of the Holy Ghost and in order to preach the gospel before you can make it the gospel preach you've got to have the power and demonstration of the Holy Spirit to prove the gospel then letter collect but the Spirit make it a life it is not a ritualistic of fear it is absolutely a real living reality of the resurrection of Jesus Christ living among men what is he saying this power this glory this gospel could be taken to your home to your house I don't know what

do restore back the original fate yet the resurrection faith what is the faith that they seen Jesus after he was raised from the dead seen him working among them they were men of few words they went forth and preached the word oh my and I come to the last quote and I wrap up the service right here this is the part this is some condemnation by representation and he was praying he said let us pray now you think it's over it can play something he said Lord knowing that I'm immortal and soon I shall go my days are getting many nouns soon I'll be 52 years on this earth and Lord I want to be faithful I want to be true to the end around the world many many Nations people's tongues races seen many creeds and seen them how them mix them up and all their different emphases and frustrations when in those places there are many true children many men and women in those places over in that hybrid field that truly don't want to be there they think they are doing God's will I pray father this morning to take away all doubts from my little group here today and from those who will be listening on to the tapes that you will take away all the man-made creeds as Jesus when he came the first time he found them teaching thing that wasn't from the beginning father so it is now at the near coming of Jesus again just like the vine the divine put forth a branch and that branch was a Pentecostal branch filled with the Holy Ghost and signs and wonders of fruits fall in that branch if that vine ever put for another branch it will be the same kind of branch we know that father by nature itself but we do know that you can graft any fruit that's pertinent to that into the vine and we'll live by divine and we know that we can take orange tree and grow citrus fruits of different kinds seven or eight we can put lemons on it and it'll grow right in citrus fruit they will grow grapefruit or many others tangerines and so forth but if that tree brings forth its own branch it will be orange Lord as we like the first one was here we go and this is where I get the inspiration from for this morning and we believe there is to be a church in these last days that will receive both former and latter rain it will be scattered throughout the world in this loud Eastern Church age it will be a church that is called back to the original faith in God it will be a church that have Jesus Christ walking in it manifested himself and the shout of the king will be in it may the Lord bless she was we want to stand and worship Father God I pray in the name of Jesus to break every
