daughters lord we are here tonight lord because we all have needs lord we are not here just to be present and to be part of a roll call as it were but lord when you were here you said they are well have no need of her physician and you made it clear that you came to deal with situations you came to deal with challenges you came to deal with people who realized that they were not whole father so lord when you would ask the question will thou be made whole you were giving an opportunity to help close the gap to be where someone didn't even realize they could be because man didn't realize that he could even be complete he could even be whole he could even be perfect so lord may you speak to us through your word through your scriptures tonight lord for the next few moments lord that we don't take it for granted we law realize that time is just fading away lord and lord we want to be ready we want to be lord mature sons and daughters father that could apply this word lord in in in in a practical way father lord understanding that this whole message of the hour is to produce a life producer demonstration lord of lord how you were when you were on this earth lord through the different ages through the different prophets the different kings the different messengers the different leaders you had through scripture how we take encouragement and inspiration from them and we can look at it and realize that we could do better lord and we want to understand how we could do better we want to understand how we can grow we want to understand how father lord we can look into your word that you left us your mind to us that we could go in at any time to catch a glimpse of your thinking on certain matters certain issues so lord as the word goes forth may you minister to your sons minister to your daughters minister to marriages minister to the young people minister to the caleb's may you give hope and comfort lord to those that need hope and comfort and if there's anyone who is in that valley of decision or at that crossroads where they're not sure where to go and how to do and how to move and how to live and how to act lord may you speak to them through your word lord that they would find themselves in you and understand that you are the author and the finisher so father we commit the service into your hands we commit the time into your hands in the precious name of jesus christ amen and amen and amen certainly want to greet uh one and all tonight in the precious team of jesus christ it's certainly a great privilege to be able to gather another time around the sacred word of god that we have grown to understand is our source is our strength is our refuge is our comfort and it's a break uh in in in uh what has become our routine you know having to go to work having to do school and now work and school blends in this blended learning situations and all of these new experiences that 2020 has presented that with it has brought its own challenges and its own tests and its own frustrations and its own concerns and and we have not been this way before it's both in the natural and it's also in the spiritual but we are comforted by the fact that every situation we ever have to uh encounter we could find strength in scripture we could find somewhere where god could allow us to to get encouragement so uh last week uh we were speaking uh on on solomon and the book of proverbs and for those who have been following we would have addressed and introduced solomon a few weeks back and and last week we continue it and into exploring the book of proverbs and i've said it a few times that many times we have part ones and we never get to part twos and these things because we we know we need to get there but we also depend on on leadership to move forward um but tonight i wanted to continue in proverbs uh there's so much in there that could help us and uh it it it is it's it's a lot uh when you kind of take your time and go through it but uh for the sake of of a title of tonight it'll be exploring the book of proverbs part two and i trust will be an encouragement to you we would have introduced uh last week a context for the book of proverbs and for those who may be joining us on this journey tonight uh for the first time um in the book of proverbs i do want to refresh us by just reading that uh snippet uh from what introduces the book of proverbs in my king james bible and reference our characters before we continue by the grace of god tonight so just to lay a foundation the key word in proverbs is wisdom the ability to live life skillfully and those are powerful words live life skillfully a godly life in an ungodly world and if there ever was a time wherein an ungodly world is now however is uh a godly life in an ungodly world however is no simple assignment proverbs provides god's detailed instructions for his people to deal successfully with the practical affairs of everyday life how to relate to god parents children neighbors and government solomon the principal author uses a combination of poetry parables pathy questions short stories and wise maxims to give in strikingly memorable form the common sense and divine perspective necessary to handle life's issues and life is full of issues every day it's a it's a different issue we have to deal with and sometimes it feels as if all we're dealing with is issues so it's important for us to have a compass a north star a place where we can look to and get guidance uh into how to move and how to live we would have also introduced last week the tapestry that indicated that going true proverbs although it sometimes could feel somewhat disconnected and it's a quote here and a phrase here when you really go above the book you see ultimately only three individuals broadly being described we spoke about the wise we spoke about the fool and we spoke about the simple and just to refresh our memories in defining this we learn that the wise are defined as the wise characters show skill in the art of godly living this is the person who continues to work hard at applying the grace of god the story of the gospel to everyday situations he is not perfect at it but over months and years he sees more and more how the promises of god apply to every square inch of his life and we understand as we go through this and we have the the the opportunity to look at scripture through the fought light of the messenger malachi 4 to understand that we are predestinated to adoption and we do have a promise of perfection so we understand where this is and by contrast the fool is the person steadily opposed to god's covenant he's the one who rejects the forgiveness offered by god who can be dangerous in his influence and who grieves his parents and we'll see it pronounced all through the book of proverbs as well and our last main character you will find in proverbs is the simple the character described as a simple in the book of proverbs is the one not firmly committed to wisdom or foolishness or anything for that matter he is easily misled he easily falls into believing the majority opinion of the crowd he can be religious when surrounded by religious people he can be sinful when surrounded by sinners he can be lazy when surrounded by slackers etc he is not actively opposed to god but he doesn't really care that much either the simple is not as far gone as the fool but he tends to be the guy who when in the presence of wise teaching remains unaffected it whistles through his head so this is a bit of a reflection of what we said last week as we begin to build on where we were at and if you recall we would have ended last week on uh proverbs 3 around verse 26 um quite honestly it will be a monumental task to read every verse of proverbs and by no means uh is that uh my objective so i want to kind of highlight some some aspects of it but you would recall we closed out last week rejoicing about when thou liest down thou shalt not be afraid yea thou shall lie down and thy sleep shall be sweet that was proverbs 3 24 and we went on to be not afraid of sudden fear neither of the desolation of the wicked when it cometh for the lord shall be thy confidence we spoke about the lord being like confidence proverbs 3 uh this is verse 26 the lord shall be thy confidence and shall keep thy foot from being taken so the desolate foundation for us tonight i don't want to be too long but just to encourage you i want to continue in three then we're going to touch four then we're going to jump a little bit to 10 and if time permits a little bit of 15 and 16 i'm going to try to see uh how we could bring some some closure there all right are you with me tonight i trust that you're having a a wonderful time in the lord and that you are enjoying your trials and enjoying your testings and enjoying your chastisements and enjoying the reproof because if you are enjoying these things that cons that counts you as wise that's one of the the benchmarks of wise because when you read about the fool before go like reproof the fool doesn't like correction you know so so let's start with verse 27 tonight and we'll see how uh god could work with us tonight so verse 27 says withhold not good from them to whom it is due when it is in the power of thine hand to do it so withholding good here is not just this is not just physical withholding as in a physical thing but sometimes you can give a word of encouragement to somebody it's in your power to do it and you just and you just don't want to tell somebody yeah you have people who don't like to to give you know so this is with whole not good from them to whom it is due so they they are entitled to do it it's in the amplified it says you rightful recipients you know there are some people who you meet them they don't have much good to see you know their people we sometimes call them negative focus you know they only will critique they will only say negative but but if there's something good to say you'll never hear any good you never hear the positive so the bible is saying here if you have the power the ability to to give good it's in thy power to do so don't hold it back there's nothing wrong with blessing somebody encouraging somebody there's nothing wrong with giving a compliment there are people who are so caught up in themselves somebody make a nice cake somebody cook a nice pot of food and because they didn't cook it they want to say something good about it you know it's in that power to give a compliment it's in your power to give all right verse 28 say not unto thy neighbor go and come again and tomorrow i will give wendell hasted by thee so in other words somebody come and say um brother so and so i need you know somebody said you say well listen come back to mourinho and you know right next to you and you draw you have what he puts in need but you're there are you saying you're not ramming yourself are they trying to to come across a certain way so look at the simplicity but look at the fact that it is written in scripture to give you conduct to give you behavior and recognize that this whole message is about the life that's what we stress in that and we find the pattern of the life not just in the prophets quotes but when you go to scripture you see the kind of life that god is trying to reflect and we are quoting here from proverbs because we understand outside of the ministry of jesus christ solomon was the wisest man who ever walked the earth all right so we're looking to get context here right so devise not evil against thy neighbor seeing he dwell it securely by thee all right so again this is not being addressed now as in to fool or wise in this context this is just instructions these are instructions devise not evil against thy neighbor seeing he dwelled securely by thee all right strive not with a man without cause if he had done thee no harm all right in the amplified do not quarrel with a man without cause if he has done you no harm you see people who like to pick other people fight this is the scripture for your idea you're getting into a quarrel for a man without cause especially when the person has done you nothing so you have just think of it within the church context it's not just the message alone it's it's everywhere people picking a fight because of somebody else's situation and suddenly they have words with you you never meet them before but they know 29 reasons why they shouldn't be talking to you all right this here is it is it strive not with a mammoth of course if you have done thee no harm he ever hurt you no why is your problem with him well he talked to my pastor so i vex with him all right so this is it envy thou not the oppressor and choose none of his ways all right and specifically this oppressor is deemed a man of violence in the amplified so do not envy a man of violence so this is the young brothers in particular who want to try to be you know you want to be a gangster you're looking at the are the people on the street and saying i want to be i wish and and that is your role model so he said envy not the oppressor don't try to envy the man of violence and choose not any of his ways for the fraud or a devious uh is an abomination to the lord but his secret is with the righteous the curse of the lord is in the house of the wicked but he blessed the habitation or the dwelling place of the just surely he scorned the scorners but he gave it grace unto the lowly the wise shall inherit glory but shame shall be the promotion of the fools so fools have promotion come in but the promotion that fools get is actually shame when they process that so the fools have their promotion but the promotion they get is actually shame all right so let's move into into into chapter four hear you children the instruction of a father and attend in other words pay attention that's what a ten means to no understanding all right so i want to read that in the amplified so you understand the depth of this initial statement hear all children the instruction of a father and pay attention and it says and be willing to learn so that you may gain understanding and intelligent discernment one of the challenges we have not just in the spiritual but in a natural and as in natural within your spiritual is people don't want to take their time to learn all right mastery takes time being skilled takes time so i was sharing and i've shared it before i may have shared it in in this room before and i shared certainly uh in business conversations that a lot of people look to professions such as i want to be a doctor i want to be a pilot i want to be and these are the kind of things and i say you know what if you really study how a pilot uh operates no matter how bright you are as a pilot you cannot leave the airport without checking off certain things on the checklist you can't say well i know in my memory all right so as good as you are as a pilot the the the authority of the airport will not let me say you know well he's a bright pilot so let me just take off there has to be because of the risk involved they kind of depend purely on his memory purely on his intelligence so there are measures in place to ensure that there's a disciplined approach to operating and this is what many of us lack in our daily lives we lack it in our business lives we lack it in our spiritual lives a disciplined approach to life and we're going to see more of it as we go into proverbs about a disciplined life there right verse two this is chapter four verse two before i give you good doctrine for seeking not my law so this proverbs four is one of the only times in the book of proverbs where you already see solomon is almost speaking about his particular situation all right so verse 3 said for i was my father's son tender and only beloved in the sight of my mother all right so he's speaking about his relationship with his father david and his mother bathsheba all right he taught me also and said unto me let thine heart retain my words keep my commandments and live all right get wisdom get understanding forget it not we spoke about this last week so you will see this theme repeated true proverbs the fact that has been repeated means to give more credibility more uh a commitment to it more dedication get wisdom all right so from last week to this week what activities have you done to to get wisdom all right so we get into to to dig get wisdom get understanding so it means that wisdom can be acquired it means understanding can be acquired you cannot sit down and do nothing about it when it's a command to get it all right so every week your wisdom should be increasing every week your understanding should be increasing and as your wisdom increases and as your understanding increases your conversation should be changing the way your lives should be changing the way your act should be changing the way you conduct your affairs in your home in your marriage in your business in your situation should reflect a growth of your understanding a growth of your wisdom get wisdom get understanding this is we're in verse five forget it not all right so make it is so important to you that you forget it not neither decline from the words of my mouth all right so do not decline from the words of my mouth right six forsake or not and she shall preserve me love her and she shall keep be he's talking about wisdom here so don't forsake wisdom do not turn away from her and she will guard and protect you love her and she will watch over you verse 7 wisdom is the principal thing therefore get wisdom i mean all thy getting get understanding exalt her and she shall promote thee she shall bring thee to honor when thou dost embrace her this is powerful stuff i want you to see the power of wisdom the importance of getting understanding all right verse 9 she shall give to thine head an ornament of grace a crown of glory shall she deliver to me so this is not your boss doing it this is not your family doing it this is not the ministry doing it this is when you pay attention to wisdom and we spoke last week how solomon was personifying wisdom making wisdom a person trying to catch your attention making it a person that that that want to be present in your life making it so clear to you of how important this thing about skillful living and we're not talking about your version of wisdom or the university version of wisdom or the church understanding of wisdom we're talking about godly wisdom the way god thinks everybody with me all right so verse 10 hear o my son and receive my sayings and the years of thy life shall be many so this is powerful here we have another life extension here we have another scripture that's tied god is finding ways to tie to your life being extended i heard somebody say recently what's the good to try to to to extend life and not have a good quality of life all right and that is what man tries to do using yes just health you know you're you're trying to live life a certain way but without god no matter what you have to extend life with the right quality of life and the right quality of life comes from being spirit-filled comes from living the way god wants all right so here oh my son and receive my sayings and the years of thy life shall be many so if you hear and receive my sins and the life and the years of your life shall be many all right let's go i have thought thee in the way of wisdom so wisdom can be taught so coming to now because listen if you don't understand and i've said it before you don't know what you don't know so the more you get exposed to hey i recognized i didn't realize i could get wisdom i didn't realize that wisdom could be taught i didn't realize that there was a better way now that these things are identified it now makes you approach it a certain way because you want to get it anybody with me all right i have taught thee in the way of wisdom i have led thee in the right paths that's verse 11 verse 12 when thou goest thy steps shall not be straightened all right so this straightened here is impeded or slowed down right and when the run is thou shalt not stumble take fast hold of instruction and let her not go keep her for she is thy life all right everybody fine everybody doing good okay let's go on now verse 14. now this here i really want to focus on this one with the young people but it applies to everybody all right enter not in the path of the wicked so i want you to see the path of the wicked is like a road of the wicked so enter nothing to the path of the wicked and go not in the way of evil men all right or the behavior of evil men and then it goes deeper all right and you'll see scriptures and message but about avoiding shady places and and shady situations but verse 15 says avoid it so avoid it pass not buy it turn from it and pass away let me say that one more time avoid it pass not buy it turn from it and pass away so this here removes every kind of excuse that you could possibly have because the scripture is saying don't go buy it and if for some reason yeah and then it passed not by it if your friend was in the car and it was in the car okay you turned from it and passed away all right these are scriptures as a young man and whatever will tell you as a young christian proverb is like the the marching orders this is what protects you all right enter not in the path of the wicked go not in the way of evil men avoid it pass not by it turn from it and pass away and verse 16 and i shared this with the young people before for they sleep not these evil people except they have done mischief you know they are people they can't sleep until they cause trouble you you you process that for a minute the bible is saying you know for they sleep not they can't fall asleep except they have done mischief and their sleep is taken away unless they cause some to fall so they're tossing and turning because their spirit is is driving them to do evil and that we have people in the world like that you can't be ignorant of the environment we're living in all right verse 17 for they eat the bread of wickedness and drink the wine of violence but the path of the just is as the shining light that shine it more and more onto the perfect day so the part that we are walking on is as a shining light that shining more and more onto the perfectly hallelujah aren't you looking for that perfect day hallelujah i'll be walking in the light you see the parallels there all right the way of the wicked is as darkness this is the opposite now they know not at what they stumble so you see somebody lost their way they don't know where they're going they don't know how to that is the result of it so verse 20 my son attend to my words incline thine air unto my sayings 21 let them not depart from thine eyes keep them in the midst of thine heart for their life unto those that find them and health to all their flesh so your health is tied to this thing too you know i want you to catch that tonight your health healing of your body healing of your mind healing of your soul is tied to this thing here oh somebody say amen so verse 23 keep thy heart with all diligence i've preached this before guard your heart but always spoken this as well with all diligence with all your effort with all putting in measured in place for out of it are the issues of life the issues of your life come from what's in your heart the successes you have come from what in your heart the challenges you have come from what in your heart you have to understand the impact of the inputs in your life to the outputs of your life let me say that one more time you have to understand the input of your life and how it's connected to the outputs of your life because the bible is saying out of your heart the issues so if the issues is anger and the issue is jealousy and the issue is envy and the issue is is is you don't want to talk to people and the issue is you don't want to come to church and the issue is is you don't want nobody to tell you what to do and the issue is you don't want to save and the issue whatever the issue is it's coming from your heart and if you don't guard your heart if you don't control the inputs those who study computer no garbage in garbage out so if you feed your heart foolishness it'll produce in itself if on your workplace you there living in an environment you're on your job you're in the lunchroom and people having conversations that are negative negative to something that affects your christian walk and you keep feeding on that yeah god in your heart your heart open whatever they talk about you processing it you have to know what conversations to walk away from you have to know when it's not your time to be in the lunchroom you have to know when to have your headphones on so that you don't listen to what other people seeing around you because you want to guard your heart because it is not dear issues you're concerned about it's your issues i want to say that one more time it is not dear issues you're considerable so no it's it's the issues of life your life because you want to have a good quality of life so we say out of the abundance of the heart you don't speak so when you compliment somebody you're casting something good it means your heart is where the problem isn't and and and i can't take responsibility for god in your heart but the overconnecting responsible guardian in your heart you there on in city gate you there in a maxi you there driving on the road you there listening to music feeding your spirit with with music that have you all over the place who's supposed to comment somebody's supposed to come in you can't you think gorgeous going to enjoy the change the radio chaser new yorker that if you want to put god on that duty so the challenge here is you and god or or keep or protect your heart with all diligence all diligence means all effort i want to stress that point for from it comes all the issues of life put away from the a forward mouth lying misleading mouth most of the problems we end up in and we will see it in scripture shortly is what we say you know we say the wrong things and we see the parallel where sister had you right but i'm talking about she said the right thing and the way god can say you say the right thing is the same way you could say the wrong thing you can say the wrong thing on your job and get a different response you said your wrong thing to your wife your husband your child a completely different response so put away from the afraid mouth and perverse lips put far from thee let thine eyes look right on right on means directly ahead and nine eyelid look straight before me hallelujah in other words god is saying don't get distracted all right and i pray that these bible studies and these opportunities get together it's about focus so here you have a director let the eyes look right on and that right on means directly ahead in the amplified it says toward the part of moral courage that's powerful moral courage it takes something to push you on moral courage and let the eyelid look straight before thee let your fear your gears be fixed straight in front of you in the amplified towards the path of integrity this is the challenge to us all i don't know if this is helping anybody tonight maybe you read this before maybe it's the first time maybe you you're tired of hearing this but at the risk of being repetitive i'm nailing it down again tonight right ponder the path of thy feet and let all thy ways be established i want to nail that down again consider well and watch carefully the part of your feet so as a christian you're not just jumping into anything anybody with me as a christian you are pondering the part of thy feet you are thinking before you act you are in the ambulance say consider well and watch carefully the path of your feet i want you to reflect in your life when you made a hasty decision when you didn't consider well and you didn't watch carefully the part of your feet what was the result of it and when you think back because most of us we don't like to do introspection and reflection and self-analysis let's see wait a minute you know i really messed up there why did i mess up you know what i moved too fast i didn't pray i didn't seek wisdom i didn't get any knowledge i didn't have understanding of the situation and look at the outcome of it so verse 26 ponder the path of thy feet and let all thy ways be established turn not to the right hand nor to the left remove thy foot from evil right so we're making some progress now let's jump to 10 proverbs 10. we're doing we're doing good with time so far proverbs 10 verse 1 warmer places the proverbs of solomon a wise son make it a glad father so young people well it's not just young people because you could be you know a little older as well but you want a glad father becoming wise is the key to a glad father but a foolish son is the heaviness of his mother in the amplified it says a foolish and it says stubborn so it ties the foolishness here to being stubborn who refuses to learn is a grief to his mother i remember in school the teacher said two want to learn this one there's one stubborn this one this one easy to teach and a teacher you speak with a school teacher and and one of the greatest frustrations of a teacher you don't have different kinds of teachers you know and uh i want to shout out brother stephen and and there are many teachers but i i talked about this even because but seems only a few teachers i know who has really missed school when it's holiday time you know it's one of the most passionate teachers i mean it's a paradox to me because you have teachers who love teaching and they have teachers who just you know is a whole job now you know but no matter the skill of the teacher whether they love teaching or is a job to them there's nothing more rewarding or exciting even to the worst teacher when a student who has the ability to perform performs that has its reward you don't have to be passionate about teaching but it's something else because you feel a level of validation when you put the effort into a lesson plan and you have a syllabus and a curriculum and you have goals and you see somebody there catching the revelation of it or the inspiration of it or the idea of it but it's nothing more frustrating than when somebody has the potential they have the ability and they refuse to learn and as it is in that situation in your school so you have it in the natural you have it in in marriages you have it in homes everything you choose people refuse to learn so this scripture here but a foolish stubborn son who refuses to learn is a greek day's mother all right so everyone in nearly only context right treasures of wickedness profit nothing and you've seen it time and time again people going after where they're going after treasure but it is of wickedness ill-gotten gains profit nothing but righteousness deliver it from death this the lord will not suffer the soul of the righteous the famish powerful but he casted away the substance of the wicked so the righteousness your righteousness is connected to you having i want us to see this because god will not suffer he will not allow the soul of the righteous to famish so your trust in the lord and you are choosing this path of righteousness blessed are they that hunger until after righteousness not only shall they be filled this is not just a spiritual connotation but he's saying here that the soul god will not allow the soul righteous to famish but he cast it away he will destroy the substance of the wicked all right verse 4. and this is where i say proverbs now even reaches into the realm of business he become it poor that deal it with a slack hand so if your hand slack then becoming poor is your trajectory let me say that one one more time right he becoming poor that dealing with a slack hand so brother isaac are you saying that that that god is interested in us not managing a slack hand and if you fix the slack hand in your life that you could actually avoid being poor according to this scripture this is some this is some deep things knowing all right so but he handled the diligent make it rich now this is about your thinking now this is about your mind i remember years ago i met people who making huge salary and spent not all day saving nothing and people making a fraction of what they make by the diligent deceive now that group who had a little who or didn't receive have more than those who had a slack hand it's the same reason somebody who wins the lottery who didn't know about having a a diligent hand it doesn't take too long for the money to disappear because a slack hand would lead to poverty so you can win the lottery and in two three years statistically do you know that statistically people who win the lottery within two years by the popular they have no money zero money you know after two years on average people were electronic two years the average score it was in two years they have no money at all it's as if they never had the lottery so it goes to show that it's not getting him an easy problem it's how you manage all right so he become employed at dealing with a slack hand but the hand of the diligent make it rich let's go on he that gather it in the summer is a wise son but he that's sleeping in harvest is a son that causes shame all right so these are parallels and you will recognize that exactly connected so this is talking about steven this is talking about understanding time and season because in the summer time you're supposed to be gathering you can't be sleeping anytime i have this you don't honest i know things work if that so this thing is about your life it's about your career it's about everything in here and i wanted to see how this is unfolding here all right blessings are upon the head of the just but violence covered the mouth of the wicked the memory of the just is blessed but the name of the wicked shall rot the wise in heart will receive commandments but operating fool will fall and preaching at me is a babbling fool so people talking talking talking talking the wise in heart will receive commandment but a praying fool shall fall he that walk it uprightly walk it surely but he that perverted his ways shall be known all right so this known here is about being discovered all right so i want to encourage you friends you have to walk uprightly you have to do things the right way because if you perverting his ways and your pervert in your ways or you're not doing it the right way it's only a matter of time it will be discovered anybody would be tonight hear that wink it with the eye this is about maliciously looking at something cause it's sorrow but again operating fool will fall the mouth of a righteous man is a well of life all right so in the amplified the mouth of the righteous the function of life and his words of wisdom are a source of blessing are your words a source of blessing to anybody or or are your words one of negativity do you know how important it is for you to speak positively into your life and those around you do you know that's a requirement do you know how much damage you do to children when you say you're not gonna amount to nothing and and and you're stupid you're what and when you say these things was the impact of these things the mouth of a righteous man is a well of life so if i want to look for a righteous man and one of the attributes of a righteous man is how he speaks it's a well of life are you a well of life and i want to read it from the amplified one more time the mouth of the righteous is a fountain of life and his words of wisdom are a source of blessing can people say that about you that when they speak to you that you when you speak it is words of wisdom that are a source of blessing are you a source of blessing to others and it's not just this is this is just being a blessing by your words this is you being an encouragement by your words this is you blessing somebody by your words all right but violence covered the moat of the wicked hatred stir it up stripes but love cover it all sins in the lips of him that hut understanding wisdom is found but a rod is for the back of him that is void of understanding in the amplified on the lips of the discerning skillful and godly wisdom is found but discipline and your rod are for the back of the one who is without common sense and understanding is the amplified one so when you see people in life and they say boy manga relics it's not just physical robbie talking you know it's the concept of discipline and punishment because i remember being when i was younger my dad had a statement if something internal don't control you something external will and that was code that was a code when you say if something on the inside who control me something external will and when you hear that you have to read between the lines and understand what that translates towards and the reality is for a lot of people that is how life still beats them upon because void of understanding they happen sought after understanding it cannot be friends after all these years in this message which is so rich of understanding knowledge and wisdom of god in fact not just rich but the fullness of it every mystery revealed that the simpler things in life is where we're tripping up does does it make sense all right and we're going to get to it in a bit verse 14 wise men lay up knowledge but the mouth of the foolish is near destruction you see again how much it is hitting against your mouth and your words and what you're saying you remember the prophet saying he could stand with somebody and in five minutes after talking let me know if they have the holy ghost anybody remember that quote he had to talk to him for five minutes and he know that the holy ghost in that same five minutes they cannot ever fool you talking to wise men lay up knowledge but the mouth of the foolish is near destruction the rich man's wealth is his strong city the destruction of the poor is their poverty the labor of the righteous tender life the fruit of the wicked to sin he is in the way of life that keep it instruction so solomon's making clear this way of life versus the way of death so if you want to be in a way of life you have to keep instruction but he that refuse it reproof through it so he that refuses instruction he who refuses guidance he who refuses advice is making a mistake let that not be your testimony tonight friends he that hided hatred with lying lips and he had uttered a slander is a fool these are these are so he is he is starting to make some definition now he will spread slander you know what land is his guess who anything for that kind of you know you have no evidence but your day you hear so and so do so and so and and that person is so and so on that person you have no evidence it wasn't you it's here say here say here say sometimes somebody say i heard someone say you know and it's also where your head from well i was in a maxi had some money back was talking about it in the multitude of words there wanted not sin but he that refrained it his lips is wise listen carefully to what that is in the amplified when there are many words transgression and offense are unavoidable in other words some of us will just talk too much when there's plenty talk going on the bible is saying transgression and offense are unavoidable but he who controls his lips and keeps thoughtful silence is wise so this is stressing on listen as brother braham say if you have nothing good to see someone is good to just say nothing you know this applies in your life in your job in your business in your marriage the tongue of the just is as choice silver i want this to catch that in the amplified the tongue of the righteous is like precious silver in other words greatly valued something that is greatly valued is why do we greatly value certain things diamonds gold whatever value is placed on things based on scarcity when something is scarce or rare it increases the value of it when something is in abundance the value falls so in economics and in the market if there is a shortage of sugar the value of sugar will rise that's all the souls will say so solomon is using a precious metal to parallel to how you use your tongue so the tongue of the righteous is like pressure silver meaning it is it has a great value and to to bring it here the heart of the wicked is little wood so it is underscoring the fact that he's speaking about value so the wiser you become you become more careful in how you use your words so you can't be saying anymore but this is me take me how i am and i say i don't put water in my mouth it's 40 years i end the message don't try to tell me how to say it no you see you see that you have to graduate this class you cannot say what you see is what you get that worked when you're a child when i was a child i speak as a child i understood as a child but when i became a man i put away childish things the same as they get more wise the words that come at your mouth become more precious like silver so when you speak people people want to hear you more because when you speak you're speaking substance that is why i say i reserve comment on all these political things local and abroad wherever it is because people saying what kind of thing i went away it is not silver [Laughter] i want when i speak it's precious silver i want when you speak especially silver i want when your son your daughter your neighbor your cousin your relative say tell me how i should approach something that you could hold back you could weigh it you could wear your words and when you give a response it will be like flowing of a blessing coming from you when that's ever happened people want to talk to you more you know anybody with me because you become a source of blessing you have to move above the can all conversation and a lot of what we're talking about here comes to what people see and i'm pushing it in the realm of the message because people say the wrong things with a lack of understanding all right so the tongue of the righteous it's like precious silver greatly valued the heart of the wicked is worth little and we're going on verse 21 the lips of the of the righteous feed many the lips of the righteous feed many and in the amplified it means feed and guide many so this feed is not just it's not food we're talking about here no but feed and guide many meaning your words have such value that you are now a leader i'm not a follower anybody with me tonight so the pentecostals love to know about being the head and no detail and above and not beneath we're going now to say listen that that your righteousness that the lips of the righteous feed and guide many you no longer follow what you're actually providing guidance all right let's go on but fools die for want of wisdom the blessing of the lord it make it rich and he added no sorrow with it can we just pause there a little bit in the amplified the blessing of the lord brings true riches so solomon is speaking out about true riches and he adds no sorrow to it for it comes as a blessing from god so it means that god is interested in you having substance he's interested in you being blessed and once it is god's blessing there is no sorrow there's no stress with it because it's his blessing and his blessing is not tied to your effort you know remember we were talking about in proverbs 3 in all ways acknowledge him and he will direct your path and all and all these things and when you do that there's a blessing that comes with it all right so the blessing of the lord did make it rich and he added no sorrow in it 23 it is a sport to a fool to do mischief you know when people say i just joking i just kidding it's just a joke now and it's stupidness did they do it this is this is descriptive with them right here it is a sport to a fool to do mischief as far as you can send his kicks so what you will understand is the difference between having joy and doing mischief and finding it funny because kid behavior as we go deeper in scripture we're talking about maturity maturity not as an aids but maturity in terms of conduct and behavior anybody with me tonight right but a man of understanding had wisdom the fear of the wicked it shall come upon him but the desire of the righteous shall be granted verse 25 as the whirlwind pass it so is the wicked no more so the wind is blowing away but the righteous is an everlasting foundation anybody wants to be an everlasting foundation nothing could move you this is this is the foundation we talked about no much hurricane pass blow away the roof body foundation there come on now your roof go on and off by the foundation you can move the foundation all right you write just an everlasting foundation as vinegar to the teeth and i smoke to the eyes so is the sluggard to them that send him so he amplified like vinegar to the teeth and smoked in the eyes so is the lazy one to those who sent him to work so the bible talked about laziness and we preached about it but this applies to the natural inspiration verse 27 the fear of the lord prolonged days but the years of the wicked shall be shortened and it's really sad because you see the only time news here news and news here this gangster this bad boy it is whatever whatever life snuffed away it's scripture it is it is scripted being fulfilled you live a certain pathway you live a certain life it's really a matter of time because the principles of god are unbreakable all right the hope of the righteous shall be gladness but the expectation of the wicked shall perish the way of the lord is strength to the upright but destruction shall be to the workers of iniquity the righteous shall never be removed but the wicked shall not inhabit the earth the mouth of the just bringing forth wisdom but the floral tongue shall be cut out the lips of the righteous know what is acceptable but the mouth of the wicked speaking fraudness let me say that one more time the lips of the righteous no and in the amplified it says speak what is acceptable but the mouth of the wicked knows or speaks what is perverted or twisted so i want to make that point again not because your could say something means you should say something there's such a thing as acceptable to say or not see can i say that one more time we have to be sensitive to what is acceptable so the lips of the righteous know what is acceptable too many of us we are dangerous in how we use our words and words have a way of having a a dangerous effect on people let's move on to chapter 15. and this builds on acceptable and not acceptable on what we see it starts off with chapter 15 and chapter 15 speaks and i want to i want to focus this one particularly it's of everybody but i really want to focus on this one on on marriages a soft answer turn it away rather but grievous words stir up anger let me read it in the amplified a soft and gentle and thoughtful answer turns away wrath but harsh and painful and careless words still up anger let's just let that sing for a little bit conflict argument disagreement situation where people don't agree that is part of life it is impossible for people to be in the same room and agree on everything but over us preach it some people like juice some people like soft drink some people like apple pear grape that is life but how we respond to conflict how we respond to situations that maybe we did not expect so i said it before when we have an expectation that is not met that is when disappointment takes place so you're disappointed the food is not what they expected but your responsibility food had been expected you thought it was going to be roti but it's not roti you dreamed roti you put all the chicken for roti you buy the ingredients for roti you thought it was going to be roti you'll come home and evening and it's not roti and instead of you saying you know what you have okay no problem i'll work with this a soft and gentle and thoughtful idea soft gentle thoughtful soft so controlling decibels gentle there's no aggression and thoughtful you win what you're seeing determine where you're at you go and i make a whole certain thing and what you get back is more food than you thought you would get back because you get a whole plate full of harsh and painful and careless words i know that builds into something else and before i knew it but it would fall off the ring and all of this could have been avoided because you didn't treat it the right way so i want to encourage your friends a soft answer to the minute or where you're at and it's not just soft but when it really amplified soft and gentle and thoughtful so soft so control the volume check is that before i speak what volume am i on am i on volume one or ten if it's volume one to ten make sure you're bringing on your own volume gentle thoughtful turn turnaround try it it works it's scripture don't escalate situations in your house don't escalate it in front of your children so many things could have been avoided in life and in situations and this applies not just to couples it applies to young people who raise their voice and challenge their parents all of this is here a soft answer turn it away wrath but grievous words they still have anger the tongue of the wise use it knowledge or right so the tongue of the y speaks knowledge that is pleasing and acceptable so we were just talking about what is acceptable so you could know something and want to treat with something and by acceptable it means there's a better way to do it so you could you could know well you could notice your wrong way and your wife dude but but there's a was the best way to communicate this if you don't manage that this is wisdom we're dealing with now if you don't manage it this thing could backfire the tongue of the wise use it knowledge all right or the tongue of the wise speaks knowledge that is pleasing and acceptable but the amount of fools pour it out foolishness lord help us but a tongue of this of of of a body babbling but the babbling mouth of fool spouts fully so you know the problem no no but you just you just open and let's let the word just flow and your words is like atomic bombs you're blowing up everything so the food is not till you like it how do you treat your situation wise with the handler wonder panda hallelujah verse 3 the eyes of the lord are in every place beholding the evil and the good in the amplified the eyes of the lord are in every place watching the evil and the good in all their endeavors so it's about your activities all right verse four a wholesome tongue is a tree of life but perverseness therein is a breach in the spirit so a soothing tongue speaking words that build up and encourage is a tree of life i pray tonight that these words are building up and encouraging you and challenging you and this is by extension what you should be doing speak in words and build up and encourage but a perversive tongue this will be still in verse four speak words that overwhelm and depress and if i say crushes the spirit so our objective tonight is to build up is to encourage it you can do better you can find the acceptable words to speak to your children friends there's a key to every relationship you know but sunday want to talk to me what's the key what's the acceptable way to get in there if now in this season you don't understand how to reach your children or to reach your loved ones you lose them because there's so many distractions you have to find the acceptable way you have to this is where wisdom steps in all right a fool verse 5 15 we in chapter 15 verse 5. a fool despise it his father's instruction but he that regarded reproof is prudent there has to come a point in your life where you begin to look forward for correction where you want people to give you advice where you want people to tell you you might be going wrong you know you see it's a dangerous place to be where nobody can tell you anything you know and we see it in all aspects of life let me read this verse five in the amplified a flippant arrogant fool rejects his father's instruction and the correction but he who is willing to learn and regards and keeps in mind a reprimand acquires good sense so you have to have a willingness to learn i come to these meetings with a willingness to learn them i just happen to be the one sharing but i come with a willingness to learn and it's an attitude that you have because that's the only way you could grow where you're willing to learn and you can learn from anybody all right in the house of the righteous is much treasure but in the revenues of the wicked is trouble the lips of the wise disperse knowledge but the heart of the foolish do it not so you see the difference again and i see how much emphasis and i don't think many of us realize how much god places importance on the words coming out of your mouth and for us to understand the message we should understand the significance of this because when he sees them spoken with that is that is a part of our commission so if spoken word which is your original seed if you shall say to this mountain speak to the rock all these things it means that god now is is is placing a lot of focus on how you use what you see and not just what you say but how you say it because you could say the writing the wrong way so what you want to say is the right thing the right way all right the sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination of the lord is that an abomination to the lord but the prayer of the upright is his delight so solomon is really really powerful in how he brings this so the sacrifice of the wicked and there are many types here of the wicked that he's talking about as well but his sacrifice here is an attempt at spiritual sacrifice you know because he's contrasting this against the prayer of the upright it's his delight so god loves the prayer of the upright but when you operating and wickedness don't have to be external it can be wickedness in your heart when you come to bring a sacrifice to the lord god says an abomination i'm not moved by it an abomination is something that god hates because you're bringing a sacrifice but your heart in your heart is wickedness i want to challenge you friends let's look at ourselves through the word and let us fix the things that need to be fixed so he goes beyond verse eight spoke about his sacrifice and prayer and goes beyond verse 9 the way of the wicked so the the heart is one thing or the wicked or the sacrifice or the expression of it is an abomination but he said the very way of the wicked is an abomination the part where the approach of the awakening is an abomination but he loved him that follow it after righteousness can we follow after righteousness do we want to follow righteousness friends let's move on verse 10 correction is grievous unto him that forsaken the way i want to pause on this one let us read it again correction is grievous unto him that forsaken the way so we're not talking about now reproof about advice we're talking about people for signing ways backslide that's what forsaken anyway is all right so in the amplified he said there is severe discipline for him who turns from the way of righteousness so as you come to a greater level of understanding knowledge and wisdom and you understand this way you're walking in the way you understand what god expects of you you're moving in this pathway and you forsake this forsake this way he said severe discipline i want us to understand because to whom much is given much is required we cannot have all this word all this scripture all this revelation all this inspiration i'm going to ship with this i'm going to do what we want to do when we hear all night long without saying it the right way acceptable words avoid certain things don't pass by certain things don't do certain things don't listen to certain music don't have certain clothes in your closet don't have certain books don't watch certain movies let's bring it home now this is what he's talking about it's the way of the wicked not just the wicked the way there's a way there's a weird and wicked people operating there are things that they do there's music they live with there's what they feed their spirit guard your heart when we nail all this down and you can choose to do what you want to do then they see their discipline this is where the prophet would say now if love don't get you desperate then the conditions will because severe discipline will bring you back to the truth i much rather do it by loving my revelation than i'm gonna have to break my foot break my hand blow up my car do it to get back the attention to bring me back to the wood let us make a commitment to the discipline of the world we spoke about it before the discipline of the word correction is grievous so it's not just correction but so solomon is making a distinction between correction and grievous correction correction is not easy you know can i say that again people do it it is not natural for you to love correction you have to be careful somebody you tell somebody don't do things and you see them in church the kind of simple things you tell people to adjust their lives and they take offense for a year they holding out what and this is solomon going beyond correction just saying we'll turn up the heat on correction when you know what to do but you don't do it you know you're supposed to pray but you don't pray you know you're supposed to read the word but you don't really would because all that is forsaken the way and you will see this thematic element through all of these studies that we have done where god talk about because you're forsaking my commandments because you didn't keep my law because i didn't stay in my way these are the consequences of these things but we take it so casually until we have to hit our head against the wall to bring us into subjection and the discipline of the word why because god wants to give us an inheritance he wants to give us the spoken word and we cannot be careless with how we use words if out of our mouth will come power spoken word salvation spoken word healing spoken word deliverance can the church say amen correction is grievous unto him that forsaken the way and he listen now that hated reproof shall die so when you hear the psalmist david saying i shall not die but live to declare the words of here you have solomon i'll say listen if you hate reproof you shall die so death is tied to not getting correction isn't this powerful and i know parents would be concerned because any parent no matter how wrong your child are you want the best for your children you could have fallen out with them be in disagreement with them have not reconciled with them but in your heart you want the best for them i want to challenge you tonight if you have to reconcile with a son a daughter a family member i want to challenge you to pray and ask god this is the prayer i want you to ask god lord give me the acceptable way to reach them because that's what we're reading tonight the acceptable way is the right way you have love for your loved ones you have love for your son your daughter your brother your sister and you have a burden in your heart you could have the burden on how expressive burden the wrong way you know i heard years ago there were people in the message who you see somebody's street journal say you're jezebel are going to hell that that may not be the effective obtainable way being a fisher of men jesus called these happen to be fishes of men you can't bring fish by scaring them you can't bring fish by abusing them you can bring fish by ordering them you have a you have to put a beat you have to put a lure you have to put something to attract the attention and so too even in the prophet's ministry the first pull was about attracting the attention the first pull was signs and wonders so that people would see something be pulled to it and when he caught their attention then his second pull he was rebuking spirits bringing doctrine bringing clarity all these things but i want to hold in because a lot of the teaching tonight is focused on how we speak i know many parents with back seating children but you have been saying the right thing to them the wrong way the key to reaching them is to understand the acceptable way this is not compromising what you believe but it's going to god because he said if any man lacks wisdom let him answer it so if your approach has been failing it is time to take all these scriptures and this context we are building upon now and saying lord i'm now seeing the issue because you know maha's desire is to see my son reconcile to you maha desire to see your daughter reconcile to you not just my daughter but your daughter give me the acceptable words to use because the words i've been using have not been effective now i hear tonight that there's an acceptable way to bring reconciliation between my family there's an acceptable way to close the gap that's what we're fighting for tonight now this is the practical application of the word the acceptable way to say it in the prophet's word it's saying the right thing like sister hattie she said the right thing you could see the right thing if it's one lesson you leave with tonight it's this acceptable way ninety percent of what we spoke about tonight has to do with how you express how you speak you don't think your children who grew up in this message know right i'm wrong the sea that has been sown in their heart is real but the enemy tied them up but there is a key to unlock there is a grace to unlock there's a power to unlock can the church say amen verse 11 chapter 15 11 hell and destruction are before the lord how much more than the hearts of the children of men you know how powerful that scripture is this is saying that god could see straight into hell and solomon is making a comparison if god could see down what's happening in hell how much more he could look into the hearts of the children of men verse 12 a scorner loveth not one that reproved him neither will he go unto the wise so it's painting his character so yes yes yes there are people who don't want reproof there are people who don't want to go to the wise the people who don't want advice that people don't want to tell them what to do but you have to discern because any young person you talk about who has been here who has been under the covenant of this great message of the hour who have been turned off because of many times it's foolishness turn them off and seniors in a message who were inappropriate in their actions and behavior they are not trying to push away reproof and guidance they are looking for direction in a dark world can the church say amen let's build now verse 13 a merry heart make it a cheerful countenance so god is interested in you having a cheerful countenance people in this message walk alongside the president is that serious or was a serious hour a merry heart making a chair becoming you could be in a serious hour until i'm a chef you cannot be looking all sad depressed frustrated and attract anybody to this kingdom this kingdom is not full of people who are sad and depressed and frustrated your heart has to be merry yes your children give in trouble but there's a merriness in your heart based on the revelation that your house shall be saved and you are the wave sheet for your house can the church say man a merry heart make it a cheerful countenance but by sorrow of the heart the spirit is broken i'm gonna try a place to close off i'm not gonna reach my destination tonight but i trust that this has been a blessing to you tonight verse 14 the heart of him that had understanding secret knowledge so the more understanding so if you're getting understanding tonight and i trust i pray and i trust that your encounter with scripture is not just this bible study session i trust and pray that during the week and every day you make it your business today i find myself just using my phone and playing the bible on my phone just to hear the words while driving you have to figure out your system to get connected because if you're not connected to something you die you will die if you're not connected to something you will die but it's because i have understanding i'm striving just like you i'm striving the heart of him at heart understanding secret knowledge i want to know more about god i want to know how to live for god i want to know how to be effective to those that i meet i want to know how to move how to live in this hour but the amount of fools feed it on foolishness all the days of the afflicted are evil but here that is of a merry heart had a continual feast i love it better is little with the fear of the lord than great treasure and trouble deal with this is serious singing better is little with the fear of the lord this is dealing with people who they so want to get this i want to get this so i want to get this so when they get you're working overtime over time over time over time over time and with that over time and getting and getting and doing and doing and doing there's so much stress that they don't realize you know what let me just cut back on this here cut back this here and make sure that the fear of the lord is in my house that i take that time if you have children to spend a little time with them discussing the scriptures discussing how god works discuss any principles because you want success it's here you want to to to be achieving your job it's here you want to be successful in school it's here you want to be successful in marriage it's here you want to make the rapture it's here you want to avoid the judgment it's here better is little with the fear of the lord it's context there's nothing wrong with having much but if having much you lose the fear of the lord then it's better to have little will you fear of the lord if you could have much with the fear of your lord no problem but if getting much you lose the fear of the lord and you believe it's your ability it's your strength if you do it and if you study and you achieve and you work overtime and you build the thing up if you lose your balance and the fear of the lord because which is the beginning of wisdom if you lose it then god is better i get little better is little will the fear of the lord than great treasure and trouble dear with verse 17 better is a dinner of herbs hollywood man anybody with me a dinner of herbs where's our hooves there's the one um by george um is that one boy the watercress one better than a dinner of herbs where love is than a stored ox that stored ox is is a fattened ox stall meaning the ox couldn't really move because the ox so fat that he stole the ox car shut down is better is a dinner of herbs no meat just yes just [Laughter] in the hallelujah better that dinner of vegetables and herbs where love is present than a stolen ox and heat should deal with so you have good food and table no but it's hatred but you can get some herbs chop them day with love some vegetables that they would love and that's better and roasted roasted fattened ox the stored ox this ox so fat he can't even move that is the oxy and you have it by hatred in there let me try to close out a wrathful man or a hot-tempered man steward of strife but he that is slow to anger appeases strife verse 19 are trying to race into her clothes here the way of the slothful man is as a hedge of thorns swattleman is a lazy man so you see god is saying is is how you speak it's how you live it's how you control your emotions it's how you control your anger and he said is yakka be lazy so you can't tell me you're a christian and you're lazy it has scriptures in here and proverbs about how later you're sleeping in them you have david saying earlier will i seek thee you you're early as 11 a.m no i'm not deliberative working shift and thing but but it's a principle i guess that it's a it's a mindset so you have slothful man yeah i want to do nothing you know what to do yeah you just can't understand it the way of the slaughtered man is a hedge of tones but the way of the righteous is made plain verse 20 repeating a wise son make it a glad father but a foolish man despises his mother folly is joy to him that is destitute of wisdom but a man of understanding walk it uprightly i love verse 22 without counsel purposes are disappointed but in the multitude of counselors they are established this is a life principle it's a business principle it is where the concept of a board of directors comes from because you rap you surround yourself by people who could give you advice without counsel because you have to realize in life you don't know everything it's impossible for you to know everything but if you surround yourself in the multitude of counselors they are established so you have an endeavor you have a thing you want to do you have people around in the fellowship people who can give you the tools you need it's established let me try to close out here a man had joy by the ends of his mouth and a word spoken in due season how good is it and i will end with that verse tonight and my takeaway tonight friends in a spirit of reconciliation is as we read tonight finding the acceptable way the acceptable approach the acceptable way to speak the acceptable way to live and it's different from being right as opposed to wrong because you could have the right motive and objective and say it the wrong way and i believe i shared it last week i was in a meeting with somebody and the professional was there and they did it and i realized how we could have added value but it would have been foolish for me to go to that meeting and cut down the work that the other person did just to give you an update on that that person was able to say you know what it'll be a fantastic idea to work with this new team because they could take your vision beyond where we could that could already happen if the approach was right there's an acceptable way to do things and god has an expectation that we who profess who claim to be sons and daughters live in an acceptable way that's pleasing to god you believe that tonight so i want to encourage you friends understanding wisdom knowledge seek after it get it acquire it and i want to challenge you like i said close the gaps in your family close the gaps in your loved one don't just approach it anyhow we read the scripture the righteous man the wise man he considers before he steps he let us walk and put his foot and and hope he land where he's supposed to land he watches he wears it he's deliberate we talked about the precious silver of the words of the righteous that and the words of the wise that after a while you're such a way you start to reduce your word count your word count becomes smaller because your water becomes a little scarcer so when you speak it is valuable you have time for foolishness the fools have time for foolishness because out of the mouth of fools only proceed fully but ultimately wise and righteous is value it's a blessing it's an encouragement so i pray that tonight these few words broken from the book of proverbs from the mind of a man god anointed if the ministry of wisdom would be an encouragement to you shall we bow our heads to our word of prayer oh gracious heavenly father we thank you tonight for your love for your mercy for your grace to us lord in this bible study around the book of proverbs and lord we have had so many different studies that touch on so many different things lord from characters in the bible lord brought in the old testament and lord we went to the new testament lord we have touched on timothy we have taught on james we have talked on peter we have touched on elisha we talked about this tsunami lord we went back and forth and lord now we hear lord look at the words of solomon lord looking at our character our behavior and how to live with godly skill in this world that we live in and lord we talk about out of the heart and the issues of life father and how we're trying to deal with our own issues in our own little corner in our own little home in our own little context in our own little situation and sometimes lord we feel as if we have it covered and other times we feel so vulnerable we feel like we don't know what to do next but we are reminded by a word tonight that you have the answer and we are encouraged by a word tonight that there is a better way there is an acceptable way there's a way that's pleasing to you there's a way that will reach those that we love that we care about that we want to see this way this walk father and we want to be careful to not forsake this walk because there's grievous discipline there's grievous correction for if we forsake this world so give us the strength and the courage lord the moral courage the spiritual courage lord to stand firm lord to be rooted and grounded in this love so we can be counted amongst the righteous we can be counted amongst the wise lord may you bless the word tonight may you bless the hearing of your word may you bless your church and bless the saints in the precious name of jesus christ amen and amen and amen may the lord bless you tonight remember tomorrow night we have service at the tabernacle which will also be streamed
