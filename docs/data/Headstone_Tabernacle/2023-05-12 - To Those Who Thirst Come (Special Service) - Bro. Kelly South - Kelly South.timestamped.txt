[14:27] could have Fellowship around your word
[14:30] and every word of encouragement every
[14:32] word of inspiration is my goal in this
[14:36] Dark Hour Lord the prophet saw a vision
[14:38] of Hell on the earth and we are actually
[14:41] passing through hell almost every single
[14:44] day

[15:07] in Jesus name I ask it amen and amen God
[15:11] bless you at this time I want to uh
[15:13] bring on Brother Kelly's out
[15:15] brother Kelly God bless you and welcome
[15:17] God bless you it's good to see you with
[15:19] a little bit
[15:23] um
[15:24] uh this game is sort of a short notice
[15:27] brother Ovid asked me to speak I believe
[15:29] it was Wednesday I think
[15:31] but uh honestly there was already
[15:34] something on my heart and so you often
[15:38] can you hear me brother Ovid
[15:40] Okay so
[15:42] as brother Branham has often said that
[15:45] their God works on both ends
[15:48] so there is something that happened that
[15:50] I really was touched by Brother Isaac's
[15:54] message to other week uh motives of the
[15:57] heart
[15:58] and uh so I'll speak a little bit more
[16:01] on that but I wanted first to
[16:03] acknowledge the ministry there I write
[16:05] brother over little little Snippets of
[16:07] thanks and testimonies and things
[16:10] centers
[16:11] so many wonderful services and I wanted
[16:14] just to thank all you brother over the
[16:16] pastor and brother Isaac associate
[16:19] pastor brother Anthony ministering the
[16:21] word and sometimes Wednesday night doing
[16:23] it all that's wonderful uh Billy Stefan
[16:27] uh on prayer meeting and sometimes
[16:29] ministering brother Gideon you're
[16:31] blowing our minds thank you and also
[16:35] it's very special brother Anthony you're
[16:38] playing the guitar for us on Fridays uh
[16:41] and when we had prayer meetings it meant
[16:44] so much that it still does I want to let
[16:45] you know that and brother Gideon
[16:47] sometimes you're playing the piano and
[16:48] singing by the Stefan uh singing one
[16:51] time playing the guitar and I'm grateful
[16:54] for that we're all grateful for that
[16:56] so
[16:58] brother Isaac's message was the motives
[17:00] of the heart
[17:02] and um
[17:04] I was listening to that and I was we had
[17:07] heard before the week before uh he came
[17:10] to himself as Pastor Ovid and it's like
[17:13] the gospel was really being made clear
[17:16] and preached beautifully and I heard
[17:18] with Isaac's message and I was like
[17:21] Lord he's saying so much he's saying the
[17:24] gospel he's telling the truth he's
[17:26] really dropped it in there when he said
[17:28] it's kind of the word something the holy
[17:31] ghost in your heart this is where it's
[17:34] at this is where all this comes together
[17:36] you need the the heart doctor the
[17:39] surgeon to come in and take care
[17:41] and he was preaching that and I was so
[17:44] uh touched but I remembered that there
[17:49] were times and past um some of you may
[17:53] remember my testimony in October in 19
[17:55] 2021
[17:58] and uh
[17:59] I was in the crowd many times and heard
[18:02] such sermons and I was like I've heard
[18:07] this before
[18:08] I've I've
[18:10] heard this before I've had no change
[18:12] nothing's happened to me I'm still stuck
[18:16] I I'm still stuck in sin the same things
[18:20] over and over and so listening to
[18:23] brother Isaac
[18:25] I was bleeding in my heart because I
[18:28] said Lord what if there's some folks
[18:29] there like me
[18:31] that like I was that couldn't hear that
[18:34] said I've heard this all before you know
[18:36] they always say come up to the altar
[18:38] they always say you know and they're
[18:40] supposed to do this let the ministers
[18:42] you know come up pray for the holy ghost
[18:43] or whatever
[18:45] but they're actually doing the right
[18:47] thing
[18:48] and um so brother Isaac preached it
[18:51] perfectly and I was so grateful for that
[18:53] so I wanted to
[18:55] I was really concerned and burdened for
[18:58] people that were maybe there that was
[19:01] like I was way back when
[19:03] and so I wanted to I really thought boy
[19:08] I would love to say something to them
[19:10] and then lo and behold then brother Ovid
[19:15] says hey I'll we like for you to share a
[19:18] testimony and a word man on a Friday
[19:20] night well as he said I was already
[19:23] I was already ready I had all these
[19:25] things I wish I could tell people
[19:28] and basically all I can tell you is my
[19:30] experience
[19:32] um
[19:32] and what I have found so far and hoping
[19:36] that it will help you along the way
[19:37] these are some
[19:39] Footprints and the sayings of time that
[19:41] God has given me
[19:43] sure it has and maybe you can see them
[19:46] and take some hope if you're in a
[19:48] condition where you wish that you could
[19:51] be free you wish that you could
[19:53] understand what they're talking about
[19:55] you wish you knew what that pyramid was
[19:57] about you wish that you could stop
[19:59] you wish the condemnation would go away
[20:03] and so that's my heart today
[20:06] so I've never given a title before but
[20:09] my title is to those who thirst come
[20:15] so I took it from Isaiah 55 which is so
[20:19] beautiful and it says Ho everyone is
[20:22] thirst
[20:23] come you to the waters
[20:25] and he has no money
[20:28] and that's like no righteousness of your
[20:31] own you've got nothing good to give to
[20:33] God you just feel you ain't got nothing
[20:35] he says come and buy eat come and buy
[20:41] wine and milk without money and about
[20:43] price
[20:45] they said why where do you why do you
[20:47] spend money for that which is not bread
[20:48] in your labor for that this doesn't
[20:50] satisfy hearken diligently unto me and
[20:53] eat that which is good and let your soul
[20:56] Delight itself in fatness
[20:58] so the Lord has put out a beautiful
[21:00] invitation for everyone
[21:03] and um
[21:04] so
[21:06] um
[21:08] in this message also I I also if I may
[21:12] brother Isaac is a seasoned minister
[21:16] and sometimes though I think we should
[21:18] also remember the ministers go through a
[21:21] lot and to appreciate them and I wanted
[21:25] to when I was watching the message even
[21:27] though he knows it I wanted to tell
[21:29] brother Isaac don't look at the faces
[21:32] don't look at the faces just preach the
[21:34] word it'll do the job it'll do the job
[21:37] don't you know don't worry because if
[21:39] your father brother over here it paid
[21:42] attention to my face you know in 2014
[21:44] 2016 we saw each other he had a
[21:47] but he doesn't I know the word has got
[21:51] something in it it's just super powerful
[21:54] um I know
[21:56] people say you know I'm not worthy
[22:00] uh I did this I can't stop doing that I
[22:04] quit smoking I still want to quit I
[22:06] still want to smoke it's still in me I I
[22:08] I'm a young lady but I like makeup I I
[22:12] want to wear a certain dress I want to
[22:15] dress a certain way I want to be a
[22:16] certain way but I don't want to but it's
[22:18] it's in me and I understand that I
[22:22] understand it's exactly what brother
[22:24] Isaac said it's in our hearts we're born
[22:26] in sin shaped in iniquity we're just
[22:28] that way and it does take the great
[22:31] heart surgeon to come in and take that
[22:33] out and we're going to talk about that
[22:35] very thing
[22:37] so
[22:39] um
[22:40] in my experience my problem uh I
[22:45] struggled for years because I was trying
[22:47] to make myself good enough for God I was
[22:51] trying to be good enough to receive the
[22:53] Holy Ghost I was trying to overcome I
[22:55] was trying everything to try to pray and
[22:56] I tried fasting I was one of those that
[22:59] way in my early days of the message read
[23:01] the prophets message on receive the Holy
[23:03] Ghost and volunteered to stay all over
[23:05] Christmas holidays pray every day to try
[23:08] to receive the Holy Ghost
[23:09] you know just trying but
[23:13] um
[23:13] but I was telling someone at work that's
[23:16] given a testimony and said you know what
[23:18] I was doing was you know take sin it's
[23:22] and you wrap it up in a suit and tie and
[23:25] you take it to church you know and
[23:28] you're supposed to really that's only
[23:30] Where You're Gonna Go free let's go to
[23:31] church you know let the ministry of the
[23:34] word speak to you but it year after year
[23:36] after year and after a while that suit
[23:39] and tie won't hold it no more
[23:41] you know God lets things happen he lets
[23:44] pressures happen and the Damage begin to
[23:46] burst and what's in your heart really
[23:48] comes out
[23:50] so uh as you all know I'll probably hear
[23:53] my testimony that I went really really
[23:55] way down
[23:57] but I was brought down to his brother uh
[24:01] Gideon called it that last cry which God
[24:05] bless everybody that was beautiful
[24:07] Wednesday
[24:08] and I just had nothing left I had
[24:12] nothing left nothing to offer God
[24:15] nothing
[24:17] so I simply said Lord I have this and I
[24:20] confess my sins
[24:22] I am right right in the bedroom next
[24:23] door here and just said is this what I
[24:27] am I can't stop it
[24:30] but I'm now going to accept your
[24:33] sacrifice that you've made for me
[24:36] because that's the only thing on this
[24:37] Earth I have
[24:39] and that's all I did and one day I
[24:43] realized everything that bothered me for
[24:46] decades
[24:47] was gone
[24:49] totally gone all the sins and things I
[24:52] couldn't get rid of were gone
[24:55] and I was blown away I didn't know what
[24:58] it was uh I couldn't understand it so
[25:02] one of my favorite things that brother
[25:03] Branham said about Paul Paul the Apostle
[25:06] Paul he saw the the pillar of fire you
[25:09] know going up to Damascus to arrest the
[25:11] Christians
[25:12] and he had this great experience of the
[25:15] pillar of fire and brother Branham said
[25:18] he went down to Arabia for I think three
[25:20] years or something he said what I
[25:22] believe he did and I believe brother
[25:23] Brown was speaking this because he had
[25:25] this experience
[25:26] he said he went down and checked in the
[25:29] scriptures
[25:30] see what his experience was
[25:33] and so Paul just didn't run off and say
[25:36] hey I saw the Lord and you know he went
[25:38] and checked it in the scriptures to make
[25:39] sure it was scriptural
[25:41] so I took that and I said well I don't
[25:43] know what has happened but something has
[25:47] changed me and I'm not sure what it is I
[25:50] went into the word I just started
[25:51] looking and it was amazing it was
[25:54] identified everywhere
[25:56] and uh was so shocked but more than
[26:00] anything and for those of you who
[26:02] struggle this is why I'm saying this
[26:05] um you know with with men there's all
[26:09] kinds of issues nowadays with uh the way
[26:13] ladies you know forget it you go out
[26:16] into the summer time everybody's dressed
[26:19] a certain way and it's can be for a
[26:22] unconverted heart uh forgive me we can
[26:25] be hell on Earth it's terrible
[26:28] and you're like I'm a Christian I'm not
[26:31] going to pay attention but the devils
[26:33] are like crawling on your like slides
[26:35] and I'm being very honest
[26:38] now after my experience it's like I'm in
[26:42] another world
[26:43] um my wife and I were out west recently
[26:46] and we were in the kind of tourist town
[26:48] it was just all kinds of stuff and I was
[26:50] just like it was like you felt like
[26:52] there were thousands of Satan's tools I
[26:55] started dragging thousands of men to
[26:57] hell
[26:59] and I was amazed because of my I don't
[27:01] feel religious I don't feel particularly
[27:05] anointed I don't feel special but I'm in
[27:08] another world
[27:09] I am not affected by anything around me
[27:13] none of this nothing
[27:16] and uh
[27:18] and it was and so I was so deeply moved
[27:22] by it that's when I wrote brother Ovid
[27:23] the testimony uh of the blood of Jesus
[27:27] Christ the powers and the blood
[27:30] and um
[27:32] so anyway
[27:35] um one thing I was trying to do prior to
[27:37] that I said was was works I was trying
[27:39] to make myself holy I could not do it so
[27:42] that's the thing I'll tell my friends
[27:44] that were in the meeting with brother
[27:45] Isaac you can't make yourself holy
[27:48] you can't do it you gotta surrender and
[27:52] you gotta let God just accept what he
[27:55] said that he provided for you
[27:57] that's a sacrifice a lamb sacrifice for
[28:01] you just accept it when you accept it
[28:04] from your heart he'll come right in and
[28:07] he'll take all that out of you
[28:09] so one of the things that recently this
[28:14] this life
[28:15] this being this person that's in me
[28:19] that come in
[28:21] identifies itself in the word
[28:24] and so one of the most recent ones is I
[28:27] saw beautifully it was Hebrews 4 9 for
[28:29] he that entered into his rest he that is
[28:32] entered into his rest that's the
[28:34] believer
[28:35] he has also ceased from his own works
[28:39] as God did from his you know in creation
[28:44] so I thought wow that's right I don't
[28:46] even try anymore it just lives itself
[28:49] this life that's inside lives itself out
[28:54] so
[28:55] it's a different thing
[28:57] so I'm saying this to give hope not to
[28:59] say
[29:00] because I I didn't think it was possible
[29:03] I never thought it'd be here but I am
[29:06] so
[29:07] I would say another thing that when I
[29:10] was in my condition
[29:12] and I felt I truly didn't know if I died
[29:15] where I was going to go
[29:18] but I also did not believe I was
[29:21] desperate enough because you got to get
[29:23] desperate you got to get desperate you
[29:24] got to get desperate and you affect a
[29:27] while you're well I'm just not desperate
[29:28] enough that's why I can't ever receive
[29:31] the Holy Ghost that's why I can't ever
[29:32] change God doesn't see me desperate
[29:34] enough but I found out you know what
[29:37] it's not what we see it's what God sees
[29:41] he saw I thought you you you can't
[29:45] figure out what you think God thinks
[29:48] it's no way he saw it and he saw it and
[29:51] he knew I was ready
[29:53] and he knew I was ready to die
[29:56] to myself
[29:58] so what is death to self I know at least
[30:00] one part of it is and it's and greatest
[30:04] battle ever fought I believe
[30:06] you believe God's word
[30:08] be for your own thoughts
[30:11] before your own reasoning you take his
[30:14] word above your own thoughts your own
[30:16] reasoning because your own reasoning
[30:18] will say
[30:20] you know I did it again
[30:22] I messed up again
[30:24] I did that thing I'm ashamed I can't
[30:28] talk to God because I'm sure he's mad at
[30:30] me
[30:31] and you're like I'll I'd like to ask
[30:33] well pray tell how do you know what God
[30:36] thinks how do you know you know the only
[30:39] way you can know what God thinks about
[30:41] you
[30:42] is not your imagination the only way you
[30:44] can think is the Bible
[30:48] that's his thoughts about you and then
[30:51] he sent us a prophet to reveal this word
[30:54] right here
[30:56] in that word he revealed and shows what
[31:00] he thinks of you you go in there and see
[31:02] what he thinks of you as Satan will show
[31:05] you the bad stuff no no no you stick
[31:07] with the good because the prophet stays
[31:09] if you watch he doesn't preach
[31:12] it's encouraging all the time
[31:15] so I'm saying don't try to guess what
[31:17] God thinks of you
[31:19] you know you've got to stick with the
[31:21] word
[31:22] take your thoughts okay that's the next
[31:24] one
[31:25] okay Isaiah 55 7. love this one he says
[31:29] let the wicked forsake his way and the
[31:32] unrighteous man
[31:34] now that's that's a
[31:37] you know all there's none righteous you
[31:40] know everyone sins short of the glory of
[31:42] God and all that born it's in Chapin
[31:44] iniquity
[31:46] and the unrighteous man his thoughts let
[31:48] the wicked forsake his way and the
[31:50] unrighteous man whose thoughts he didn't
[31:52] say his unrighteous thoughts he said his
[31:55] thoughts
[31:57] period forsake your thoughts
[32:00] and let him return unto the Lord and He
[32:04] will have mercy on him and to our God
[32:06] for he will abundantly pardon so you got
[32:09] to forget what you're thinking about
[32:12] yourself and what the devil is telling
[32:14] you about yourself he don't think that
[32:16] way about you
[32:17] he made a way for you to come in
[32:21] okay
[32:22] um
[32:24] and this is something that also is true
[32:27] and this is from the unchangeable god
[32:30] working in an unexpectable way to say
[32:32] incredible beautiful message brother
[32:34] Brandon says but sometimes
[32:37] when God performs something and does
[32:40] something we ask for
[32:42] it it comes in an unexpected way and
[32:46] sometimes in an unexpected place and at
[32:49] an unexpected time
[32:51] but God will answer his own way if
[32:54] you'll just believe it
[32:56] so that's what happened to me I was
[32:59] totally unexpected
[33:01] gave up completely just I'm I'm yours I
[33:05] don't know what they do I accept what
[33:06] you gave me in unexpected time
[33:09] unexpected way I myself
[33:12] felt nothing saw nothing is just
[33:15] something changed a Life come out of
[33:17] began to live that I did not I couldn't
[33:21] explain
[33:23] so
[33:25] um
[33:27] so I talked about Paul Arabia
[33:31] um one thing that
[33:33] when my wife and I went out west and all
[33:35] those situations were out there with the
[33:38] way people were and you know there were
[33:41] the LGBT and all that all that stuff
[33:43] going on there
[33:44] and I was so
[33:47] divorced from the world it was that's
[33:50] the only way I can say and I came back
[33:52] and I was so amazed and I realized in
[33:55] that really really dark situation the
[33:59] gospel in me shown really really bright
[34:02] it's shown the brightest in that dark
[34:05] place you know and we didn't go into
[34:07] into any place we're just walking up and
[34:09] down the street you know maybe it was a
[34:10] restaurant
[34:13] um I would also say that there is
[34:17] um
[34:18] there is power in the spoken word
[34:22] um when I after I was I'll call it saved
[34:27] because I was I was saved from sin and
[34:30] misery and death hell and a grave
[34:33] and uh I look back at messages that uh
[34:36] brother Ovid started playing from years
[34:39] previous
[34:40] and I was like oh my goodness he was
[34:42] saying exactly what was going to happen
[34:44] to me
[34:46] it was just exactly you know he would
[34:49] say you're going to be delivered and you
[34:50] know all these things and I was like
[34:52] yeah yeah I was I was you know so
[34:56] there is something in the word that is
[34:59] alive
[35:01] and you hear the minister speaking it
[35:03] but it's actually alive and it's looking
[35:05] it's a seed it's looking for a round
[35:08] it's looking for moisture is looking for
[35:11] some place to grow
[35:13] and so brother Branham said
[35:16] um it's an unchangeable guy working an
[35:17] expectable way the same same message
[35:19] it's talking about basically the power
[35:22] of word under inspiration uh well
[35:26] anyway he says every promise has the
[35:29] same power of creation behind it he was
[35:31] talking about the power of the word when
[35:34] the world was created said every promise
[35:37] has the same power of creation behind it
[35:40] uh that God's word did at the beginning
[35:43] if we believe it to be the word of God
[35:47] so it's
[35:49] unbelievable but every promise in here
[35:52] has the same power of Creation in it
[35:56] so
[35:58] he's a moisture uh it falls into the
[36:02] ground a ground that can create this
[36:04] kind of moisture or nourishment around
[36:06] the promise of God it will bring forth
[36:09] every promise the Bible made
[36:12] it's just that he says why the right
[36:14] mental attitude towards any Divine
[36:16] promise of God will bring it to pass if
[36:18] you just look at it and take care of the
[36:20] word just right
[36:22] so
[36:24] when the minister the pastor speaks
[36:26] those are those are inspired living
[36:28] words that go out to us that's what
[36:31] changed me because I was so messed up
[36:33] and I'm like I would hear something
[36:35] about the blood and it just struck me
[36:36] and a huge one small sentence whole
[36:40] service and it was
[36:43] the blood is still relevant you don't
[36:46] hear much about that anymore but the
[36:48] blood is still relevant amen something
[36:50] in me caught that in the midst of my
[36:53] despair that really
[36:55] you mean you mean I can walk forward
[36:58] even in my condition under the blood the
[37:01] way I am and it'll cover me
[37:04] and it it set me in in motion to start
[37:08] getting up and walking even though I was
[37:11] busted up inside
[37:13] and uh so the word spoken has power
[37:16] that's promises in the Bible have they
[37:19] are living they have Spirit they have
[37:21] life they just kind of hit the ground
[37:23] the right place
[37:25] so
[37:27] forgive me I forgot to look at my time
[37:29] brother always let me know if I go too
[37:31] far
[37:33] um
[37:33] so you might ask some of those maybe
[37:36] that were in brother Isaac's audience so
[37:39] why can't I see all this
[37:41] you know you know the Lord said it set
[37:43] the man be born again he cannot see the
[37:45] kingdom of God
[37:47] well there's my wife and I we went to
[37:49] see the Grand Canyon for the first time
[37:51] it's a huge huge chasm in the mid middle
[37:54] of the Earth it's 18 miles wide at this
[37:58] widest point it's a mile deep it's just
[38:02] massive and brother banham says that we
[38:04] are sin places a Chasm between us and
[38:08] God
[38:09] that we absolutely positively cannot get
[38:12] back to God because of this huge Chasm
[38:15] that would separates us
[38:18] and it's even mentioned it seems to me
[38:20] in the Lord when he talks about Lazarus
[38:22] uh you know after he dies he's in the
[38:24] bosom of Abraham and the rich man is in
[38:27] hell and a rich man asked Abraham Sin
[38:29] Sin Lazarus to give me some water
[38:31] because these Flames torment me
[38:34] and he's basically saying well even if
[38:36] we wanted to we couldn't because there's
[38:38] a giant Gulf between us
[38:40] so like even on the other side this
[38:43] Chasm that separates men from God that
[38:46] are in sin is there
[38:48] but
[38:50] no Lord Jesus by his death burial
[38:52] Resurrection
[38:54] then he bridged that for us so when you
[38:57] accept the Lord Jesus
[38:59] simply on the basis I mean you can't use
[39:02] your head well why did he no he just say
[39:06] Lord
[39:07] you said it there's a sacrifice for me I
[39:11] accept it and I thank you for it he
[39:13] takes you across that Chasm to him
[39:16] and you're no longer separated from God
[39:19] and I can tell you the truth I I've
[39:22] Marvel every day every day
[39:26] of of this experience just in me having
[39:29] a burden and then brother over reach out
[39:31] and say hey we'd like to share your word
[39:33] that's that's the kind of thing I'm sort
[39:35] of getting used to because it happens a
[39:37] lot
[39:39] and um so you might ask okay
[39:42] so how do I
[39:44] uh you know
[39:47] let's see here
[39:49] so he said except a man be born again
[39:52] you can't see it so you're on this other
[39:54] side this Castle you can't see nothing
[39:56] because you're separated from God
[39:58] so the question is then a person would
[40:00] say well how do I get born again
[40:04] and said so the question would be look
[40:06] for number one thing what is the birth
[40:09] and uh I defer to brother Ovid for
[40:13] anything you know if I go off a little
[40:15] bit or whatever but I'm trying to this
[40:17] is what I'm just digging into the word
[40:18] like Paul did and this is what I found
[40:22] he said first brother Branham how can I
[40:25] overcome it's a message first under
[40:27] justification the water baptism
[40:30] second
[40:32] under the new birth
[40:34] of Wesley
[40:36] sanctification
[40:38] so he identifies the new birth with
[40:41] sanctification
[40:43] and my experience is that's what it is
[40:47] because something changed me and he says
[40:51] that later and I was completely
[40:54] sanctified
[40:55] which he said sanctification with
[40:57] cleanses and then thirdly under the
[41:00] baptism of the Holy Spirit put that
[41:02] Sanctified vessel into service
[41:05] so I'm just I'm not there I will be I'm
[41:09] so happy to be on the road that's all
[41:11] I'm happy to be on the road
[41:13] so he said well how do you get
[41:15] Sanctified how you how do you get
[41:17] Sanctified this born again
[41:19] and brother Brandon says you say brother
[41:22] banham when I can quit smoking when I
[41:25] can quit drinking when I can straighten
[41:27] this thing up I'll do it
[41:29] and he says oh it'll never be done right
[41:33] you will never that's the brother random
[41:35] you will never be able to do it
[41:37] why don't you just just come the way you
[41:40] are smoke and drinking just come the way
[41:42] you are and by faith go to that stream
[41:45] the flowing room Supply then redeeming
[41:49] love to be your theme
[41:50] shall be till you die why take a
[41:54] substitute
[41:55] why I try to get it by your church like
[41:58] you know doing in the Methodist or
[41:59] whatever why to come in because
[42:02] why try to come in because you quit
[42:04] drinking or quit lying come by the way
[42:06] of perfection now I used to stumble over
[42:10] the word Perfection I used to think oh
[42:14] I could never be you know you look at
[42:16] yourself but he's not talking about you
[42:18] he says come by the way of perfection
[42:20] four by one sacrifice he the Lord has
[42:24] perfected
[42:25] forever those that are sanctified
[42:28] so it's not you trying to be perfect
[42:29] it's him perfecting you
[42:31] because brother bam said if he said be
[42:34] you therefore perfect as my Father in
[42:36] Heaven is perfect that he had to make a
[42:38] way for you to do that
[42:40] because you know he knew we couldn't do
[42:42] it so then brother Randall says how do I
[42:46] get sanctified
[42:48] he says confess your sins
[42:51] in the presence of the blood of Jesus
[42:55] and the life
[42:56] that come from that blood when the Lord
[42:59] died on the cross
[43:01] comes back to the worshiper
[43:03] and sanctifies him from the desires or
[43:07] the things of the world
[43:10] for so for you know I keep hearing
[43:13] sisters and you know that want the mini
[43:15] skirts and things you know that's in
[43:17] your heart
[43:19] that's what happens he sanctifies you
[43:22] from the desires or the things of the
[43:24] world for by that all sufficient
[43:26] sacrifice he has Sanctified us one
[43:30] Spirit we're all baptized into one body
[43:33] and then he quotes Romans 8 now there is
[43:36] no condemnation to them which are in
[43:39] Christ Jesus to them that walk not after
[43:41] the flesh but the spirit
[43:44] if you're trying to walk by the spirit
[43:47] and still lusting for the flesh to
[43:48] sacrifice hasn't been sufficiently
[43:50] applied to you but this is true right
[43:54] here I used to read this in the Bible
[43:57] but it says the worshiper weren't once
[44:00] purged has no more desire of sin
[44:03] so I tell my precious sister she has uh
[44:07] you know trouble she smoked all her life
[44:09] I said here it is because I know for a
[44:13] fact that you'd have no more desire for
[44:16] the things that used to plague you as a
[44:18] sinner it's gone the blood completely
[44:21] takes it away
[44:24] so then brother Branham says so my
[44:27] question then you say
[44:28] so brother Kelly how do I know that I
[44:31] have been born again
[44:33] so brother Branham says he's like
[44:36] someone's asking a question how will I
[44:38] know then brother Branham that I'm in
[44:40] there that's in the body
[44:42] you know born again
[44:45] watch what kind of life you're living
[44:48] just look around see if it's just lived
[44:51] out of you automatically
[44:54] or do you have to strain and pull
[44:57] that means like I used to just fighting
[44:59] and fighting trying not to sin trying to
[45:01] be holy trying to stay in the atmosphere
[45:03] trying to do this trying to do that all
[45:05] these dead works
[45:07] he says see if it lives out of you
[45:08] automatically or do you have to strain
[45:11] and pull see then you're doing it but
[45:14] don't try to do it
[45:17] don't you ever did you ever try he says
[45:21] yeah don't what's this brother Branham
[45:24] he says it's like putting a uh
[45:27] um a little baby's arm in in the sleeve
[45:29] hole you know like putting a coat on a
[45:31] little baby
[45:32] he's the babies he's just up and down
[45:34] and over everywhere else see he can't do
[45:37] it he's too small you know he's put your
[45:40] coat on honey but he can't do it his
[45:43] little arms up and down it takes your
[45:45] Steady Hand so you know he's talking
[45:47] about a toddler trying to put on his
[45:49] coat he can't do it
[45:52] so he says how glad I am that I can just
[45:54] yield my hand to the father and say Lord
[45:57] Jesus I can't get in there you help me
[46:00] put the coat on me I quit trying just
[46:04] let him do it see
[46:06] if the baby keeps trying oh I can do it
[46:09] I can do it and he's just everywhere he
[46:12] can't do it
[46:13] so he says neither can you
[46:16] and neither can I
[46:18] but if we'll just hold still and let him
[46:21] do it just yield to him here Lord here I
[46:25] am just let me be nothing I yield you
[46:28] put my hand in the right place
[46:31] that's the victory he says that's
[46:33] overcoming
[46:35] so
[46:37] the thing he says you have to overcome
[46:40] and I found this to be true is yourself
[46:45] your idea you're a saying surrender
[46:49] yourself to him he overcome for you he
[46:53] knows the way we don't so this is one
[46:56] thing I have so greatly my wife and I
[46:59] talk about often in the prayer meetings
[47:01] that the pastor says if you don't feel
[47:04] desperate ask the Lord to make you
[47:06] desperate if you don't feel you know a
[47:09] burden for prayer ask the Lord for a
[47:11] burn for prayer
[47:13] and I remember uh brother a Sigmar
[47:15] colombrenner you remember me passed away
[47:17] a few years ago a couple of years and
[47:20] brother Ovid played a testimony of his
[47:22] that was there in uh in Trinidad and he
[47:26] said that uh he wanted to receive the
[47:28] Holy Ghost but he couldn't repent
[47:30] he said I was like the Son of a Preacher
[47:32] you know almost like I never did
[47:34] anything wrong it's kind of way I think
[47:35] he was saying I couldn't repent and so
[47:39] he was in a I think a Christian business
[47:40] kind of prayer group or something and
[47:43] one of the sisters said well you have to
[47:44] ask the Lord
[47:46] to help you repent
[47:48] and he did and the Lord helped him
[47:51] repent so I'm saying whatever you know I
[47:53] don't feel like that well ask
[47:55] and he will answer
[47:58] he's very quiet but he answers
[48:02] okay here we go
[48:05] so when you're uh born again then so you
[48:09] removed from Romans 7 to Romans 8.
[48:12] Romans 7 I try and I try and I try and I
[48:15] try and I fail
[48:16] and but in Romans 8 the law of life in
[48:20] Christ Jesus because our life comes into
[48:22] you has Set Me Free from the law of sin
[48:25] and death
[48:27] and another one of my favorites that
[48:30] I've read for many years I didn't get it
[48:33] but of him or ye in Christ Jesus
[48:36] so Christ Jesus who is Made Who of God
[48:39] is made unto us wisdom and righteousness
[48:42] and sanctification and Redemption
[48:46] and I used to read that and didn't quite
[48:48] get it but he's saying that Jesus the
[48:51] Lord is our righteousness and in Isaiah
[48:54] it says a couple of places says um I
[48:57] believe it's basically that in one shall
[49:01] say in the Lord is my strength and in
[49:03] the Lord is my righteousness
[49:05] and so that's what it is is his life
[49:09] his righteousness in you living its way
[49:12] out
[49:14] so
[49:17] um
[49:18] I will say this also then so we looked
[49:21] at what born again is a look at what
[49:24] how you
[49:26] get there and of course these are just
[49:28] what I have found the Lord does the work
[49:31] I can't do anything for you no more than
[49:34] but I just want to encourage you that
[49:36] the gospel is real it really can be born
[49:39] again you really can get started
[49:41] and so this is something I've got a few
[49:44] notes on my phone
[49:45] that I wanted to read
[49:48] um one thing is that I used to way
[49:52] overthink and brother Brown said you
[49:54] know we're so educated these days you
[49:56] know he said to go to places in Africa
[49:58] where there was just you know Natives
[50:00] and they didn't have the stuff that we
[50:01] have and they just believed you know but
[50:04] we over educate we think too much we got
[50:06] to figure everything out and that's a
[50:08] big problem
[50:10] and uh so he said it's in God hiding
[50:13] himself in simplicity
[50:15] we know
[50:17] that God is so great do we expect it
[50:20] just fill in the blank whatever it is we
[50:23] expected to be some great something
[50:26] and we miss the simple scene
[50:28] we stumble over Simplicity that's how we
[50:31] miss God Is by stumbling over Simplicity
[50:34] God is so simple
[50:37] let that one soak in my friends because
[50:40] he is God is so simple until the
[50:43] scholars of these days which were all
[50:45] educated and all days miss him a million
[50:48] miles because in our intellects they
[50:51] they know there's that that there is
[50:53] nothing like him so great
[50:55] but in Revelation he makes it so simple
[50:58] they go Plumb over the top of it and
[51:00] miss it
[51:02] and uh I remember brother Olu in one of
[51:04] the tapes we watched I think last winter
[51:06] he's like the gospel's so simple I was
[51:09] like yeah
[51:10] it is
[51:12] so and then now let's get to one more
[51:16] thing
[51:16] and that is you may say Okay born again
[51:20] and all that so what's this got to do
[51:23] with that pyramid we see up there on the
[51:25] hanging on the right side as we look at
[51:28] the pulpit
[51:30] you know the sport again thing how does
[51:32] that fit into that pyramid
[51:35] so
[51:36] brother random now we're born again
[51:39] sanctification now there's there's more
[51:41] to it I'm just talking about getting
[51:43] started
[51:44] you know being free getting delivered
[51:47] he said a lot of people go up this is a
[51:49] statue of a perfect man
[51:50] he's talking about the pyramid
[51:52] a lot of people go up to the Altar and
[51:54] pray and say Lord forgive me and a great
[51:57] experience of sanctification comes upon
[52:01] them and things
[52:03] then you have a great time
[52:04] and get up from The Altar and you go
[52:06] back and say bless God I got it
[52:08] and you know you just started to a place
[52:12] you can grow
[52:13] you ain't done nothing yet see you've
[52:16] only laid the foundation
[52:19] so what's he talking about
[52:23] still talking about the pyramid because
[52:25] we're trying to put what's this
[52:26] born-again thing have to do with that
[52:28] pyramid on the wall he said now notice
[52:30] you must be born again and when you're
[52:33] born again you can't be born again
[52:36] without having faith
[52:38] so that's right so you see on my chart
[52:41] here I got the very Foundation faith is
[52:45] the foundation of it all
[52:47] so
[52:49] I don't know how to put it properly but
[52:51] when you're born again you're placed on
[52:54] the foundation of that pyramid you're
[52:56] looking on the wall up there
[52:58] and by the band said that that begins to
[53:01] add to itself
[53:02] you know I mean there's things we do of
[53:05] course forgiving everything but and you
[53:08] know and that's where I'm at and I see
[53:11] things in myself that I never thought I
[53:13] would see coming out
[53:15] so I'm also happy when I saw that I just
[53:18] I'm here years looking at the pyramid
[53:19] you know man everybody else is way up
[53:22] there and I'm not even on it I'm way
[53:23] down here in the dirt you just
[53:25] intellectually thinking about it
[53:28] so he said now notice you must be born
[53:31] again that is he explains it changed
[53:36] there's got to be a change
[53:38] the blood of Jesus Christ now this one's
[53:41] from the Holy Ghost what the Holy Ghost
[53:43] given foreign man I'm sorry the blood of
[53:46] Jesus Christ cleanses us changes our
[53:48] Nature by sinning upon us the Holy
[53:51] Spirit then we become into the divine
[53:55] nature of God and then we become a
[53:58] dwelling place for God
[53:59] so so that's the relationship you say
[54:02] what's born again got to do that's what
[54:04] it has to do with the pyramid when
[54:05] you're born again you're placed in faith
[54:07] on the foundation and you've got the
[54:10] most wonderful opportunity ever given to
[54:13] mankind to be able to grow into faith
[54:16] and virtue and knowledge and Temperance
[54:17] and so forth
[54:19] so
[54:22] um I think that's pretty much it but
[54:24] there was one scripture that
[54:27] um
[54:28] it's Revelations 3 when the Lord's
[54:30] addressing the angel to the Church of
[54:32] led to see and and this scripture uh
[54:35] used to scare me but
[54:38] I'm just saying there's so much more now
[54:40] you're talking about born again but he
[54:42] says
[54:43] uh to the angel of the church or the
[54:45] laodiceans and of course he's writing
[54:48] the Lord's addressing us because that's
[54:50] at the last age that's our age these
[54:52] things say at the amen the faithful and
[54:54] true witness the beginning of the
[54:56] creation of God
[54:58] I know that works that you're neither
[54:59] cold nor hot I would that you were cold
[55:02] or hot so then because you are lukewarm
[55:04] and either cold or hot I will spew you
[55:06] out of my mouth you know I used to
[55:09] cringe real bad
[55:11] because you say I'm rich and increase
[55:13] with Goods that have need of nothing and
[55:15] know not that you are wretched miserable
[55:18] poor blind and naked and I looked at
[55:23] that this last time and I thought oh wow
[55:26] that was me I was wretched miserable
[55:30] poor blind and naked and you know if you
[55:33] feel that way about yourself you know
[55:36] what a blessing it is to know that
[55:38] you're miserable
[55:39] and poor and blind and naked
[55:42] that's a blessing
[55:45] um I know it's kind of hard to think of
[55:47] it that way but a lot of people don't
[55:48] see it
[55:50] he said I counsel and this was a
[55:52] blessing I said the Lord himself come
[55:55] down hid in a very simple man that we
[55:58] know is William Branham and he come down
[56:00] and he counseled us and he he said I and
[56:03] no other age where he come and said I
[56:06] counsel you
[56:08] you know what it's like to sit with the
[56:09] pastor and get some counsel this is the
[56:12] Lord Jesus I counsel you I said wow the
[56:15] Lord Jesus is counseling me
[56:18] and uh I counsel thee to buy me gold try
[56:21] it in the fire that you may be rich
[56:25] and white Raymond that you may be
[56:27] clothed and that the shame of your
[56:29] nakedness do not appear and anoint your
[56:31] eyes and eyes after that you may see
[56:34] and
[56:36] and he said as many as I love I rebuke
[56:38] and Jason be zealous therefore and
[56:40] repent and that's the love of a father
[56:43] the best father there ever was is the
[56:46] one that corrects you and keeps you on
[56:49] the right track
[56:50] and uh
[56:52] that's tremendous
[56:54] so yeah here's the beautiful part behold
[56:58] I stand at the door and knock If any man
[57:00] hear my voice
[57:02] oh and open the door
[57:05] I will come into him in to him and sup
[57:09] with him and he with me
[57:12] and then here that's
[57:15] where we're coming into him coming into
[57:17] us and then he steps right up into our
[57:21] age of adoption
[57:23] to him that overcome
[57:25] overcome it I will grant this set with
[57:28] me and my throne even as I also overcame
[57:31] and sat down with my father in his
[57:33] throne he that hath an ear let him hear
[57:36] what this spirit says to the church so
[57:38] he that overcomes I'll Grant him to sit
[57:40] in with me and my throne is
[57:44] the son's name being just as good on the
[57:48] check as his daddy's
[57:50] so we've got some big stuff in front of
[57:53] us so that's what I wanted to say I
[57:57] wanted to encourage you all
[57:59] that those had are that are trying to
[58:02] live right and struggling they don't
[58:05] know how to get there God will answer
[58:07] you he sees it and you cannot look at
[58:11] yourself you got to look at what he says
[58:13] about you in the word and believe that
[58:16] you know don't don't listen to anything
[58:18] else because it's impossible for you to
[58:21] know outside of the word what he thinks
[58:23] of you
[58:24] anyway God bless you and uh I pray that
[58:27] this will help somebody because I am
[58:30] blown away with the gospel I I used to
[58:34] lose brother Brown say oh I read my
[58:36] Bible every day at lunch and I used to
[58:37] go how in the world did you read your
[58:38] Bible every day at lunch
[58:40] now it's I read my by I mean I want to
[58:44] know so much more about this Lord who
[58:47] saved me this I can't get enough of him
[58:50] so you will be there too I encourage you
[58:53] God bless you and thank you thank you
[58:55] brother over
[58:58] praise the Lord God bless you brother
[59:00] Kelly we certainly appreciate we give
[59:03] you a lot of praise praise God for our
[59:05] brother tonight
[59:06] I know that it was something that is
[59:09] inspiring and there's a word from the
[59:11] Lord to encourage all of us about the
[59:14] blood of Jesus and you know
[59:16] it was amazing because
[59:19] um my reader's here for you what he sent
[59:25] I just want to read this here
[59:28] he said this
[59:31] every service we are
[59:34] privilege to have deserved some sort of
[59:38] testimony of Thanksgiving but the Lord
[59:40] is so gracious and sends us so much
[59:42] service after service it's nearly
[59:44] impossible to get something written
[59:46] before he has another blessing at hand
[59:48] but a knight deserves at least a woe and
[59:51] a praise God the Beauty and the
[59:54] Simplicity of the inspiration given to
[59:56] brother Gideon was stunning we are so
[59:58] sincerely blessed may the Lord bless you
[1:00:01] all brother Kelly
[1:00:02] so I reply to him I say thank you it's
[1:00:05] very encouraging I would like you to
[1:00:07] give a testimony and share a word maybe
[1:00:09] on Friday before prayer meeting you say
[1:00:11] he said I I'm sending a small squeaky
[1:00:14] voice truthfully I would love to is
[1:00:16] there but um and so on either so it was
[1:00:19] quite quite an experience even for me
[1:00:22] um that's the true life out and I was he
[1:00:25] imagine I I'm asking him inviting him
[1:00:28] and I am stunned at his reaction is
[1:00:31] because he is Prime and ready to go to
[1:00:33] share
[1:00:34] and I was praying for the special
[1:00:37] service today and I was praying that God
[1:00:39] be glorified and that Jesus name be
[1:00:41] magnified and you know what I look
[1:00:44] forward to hear
[1:00:46] is to hear about Jesus Christ
[1:00:48] you know we talk about the prophet we
[1:00:50] talk about God for William Branham and
[1:00:52] so on but the truth is brother Branham
[1:00:55] came to point us to Jesus Christ so when
[1:00:58] I hear somebody giving testimony about
[1:01:01] the Lord Jesus how about the blood of
[1:01:03] Jesus this is something you don't hear
[1:01:05] much in this message about the blood of
[1:01:07] Jesus and that is where you get the
[1:01:09] legalism you get the people judging and
[1:01:13] condemning others with shock and who
[1:01:15] can't make it and as if they Alberta
[1:01:18] Kelly were sharing like as if they know
[1:01:20] what God thinks and what God sees
[1:01:23] and like The Prodigal Son
[1:01:26] um we could see what we want about his
[1:01:30] behavior in terms of him going out and
[1:01:33] and spending his father's money he
[1:01:36] didn't earn it it was something from his
[1:01:37] father and when you really see her in
[1:01:41] the older brother was was in the worst
[1:01:43] condition and yet he was the one who had
[1:01:47] the testimony I never did that I never
[1:01:50] did that I never seen I never did that
[1:01:51] whatever whatever but he had a heart
[1:01:53] issue and he had issue was exposed when
[1:01:57] his riotous brothers came back home and
[1:02:00] sometimes as we see like how God said he
[1:02:03] would leave in 1909 and go after that
[1:02:05] one and if you have a problem and an
[1:02:07] issue with with that one coming on on
[1:02:10] the shepherd's shoulder and getting what
[1:02:12] they call a shoulder ride you know and
[1:02:15] and and you could say well I never get
[1:02:17] that right before and if I get that kind
[1:02:19] of comfort and encouragement and what
[1:02:21] the material is God said he will leave
[1:02:23] the 1909 it's it's a it's a powerful
[1:02:26] lesson and what this does is could we
[1:02:30] really write somebody off could we
[1:02:32] really say this one can't make it and
[1:02:35] this one could make it and and but the
[1:02:37] Kelly's testimony is a powerful one
[1:02:39] because what you see there is the
[1:02:41] operation of God it's not a matter of
[1:02:42] stopping smoking stopping drinking
[1:02:44] stopping running around it's a matter of
[1:02:47] something happening on the inside
[1:02:50] that you can't explain
[1:02:52] when Bob ramadi 10 vision and they were
[1:02:55] passing through that little room and the
[1:02:58] sick past you on the other side come out
[1:02:59] here they said what happened I said we
[1:03:01] don't know
[1:03:02] I was crippled for 20 years now I'm you
[1:03:05] know something just happened and this is
[1:03:09] the sort of testimony we want to hear we
[1:03:12] want to see we want to see and this ties
[1:03:15] in with what guinea but again is
[1:03:17] not a time for giving up it's the time
[1:03:19] to fight back it's a time to pass on
[1:03:22] it's a time to encourage your own self
[1:03:25] and say you know what God you who called
[1:03:27] me and some time ago we talk about the
[1:03:30] Anchor Point when the devil have you all
[1:03:32] better than you all confusing you go
[1:03:34] right back right back there's an anchor
[1:03:37] point of your colon there's an anchor
[1:03:39] point where God spoke to you whether
[1:03:40] it's 13 years old 14 years old 12 15 20.
[1:03:44] when God did with your heart yes you may
[1:03:47] have Street and you have fallen in the
[1:03:49] different conditions and stuff but if
[1:03:51] you go right back and pick up that
[1:03:53] Anchor Point it was never a man
[1:03:56] a man
[1:03:57] was not responsible for your Anchor
[1:03:59] Point somebody could have given you a
[1:04:01] book share your testimony play a tip or
[1:04:04] whatever it is give it a Bible you read
[1:04:05] and you come to the Lord but that Anchor
[1:04:08] Point was the operation of God and that
[1:04:10] is where after many years we forgot we
[1:04:14] forget about it we we make light of it
[1:04:17] and of course the burden of the enemy
[1:04:19] and with reasoning and this is a
[1:04:21] powerful thing he expressed tonight that
[1:04:24] really die not have to do with you
[1:04:26] accepting God's thoughts as he taught to
[1:04:30] receive because the devil job you see
[1:04:32] the devil have nothing original
[1:04:35] so he's asking of Eve what did God see
[1:04:38] is not intentional to learn of God no
[1:04:42] it's it's a see how you could twist it
[1:04:44] and this is the job twist and and that
[1:04:47] is where God has to help us with these
[1:04:49] element to try to see regardless of what
[1:04:52] somebody carry on with what is a heart
[1:04:54] what is the intention what is their
[1:04:56] motive what is the objective well Kelly
[1:04:59] went through stuff and he is burdened to
[1:05:03] just tell himself you know their Artisan
[1:05:05] is true the others will write there
[1:05:08] about it he said snap out of it
[1:05:12] will take more than that
[1:05:14] you know it's almost like hell
[1:05:18] is the house of hell and people are
[1:05:21] under more pressure than we think people
[1:05:22] are no more strained and stressed and we
[1:05:24] think the milk and smile the mother God
[1:05:26] bless the mother hallelujah praise I
[1:05:28] thank you but they're under pressure
[1:05:31] and and that is why we ought to really
[1:05:33] sincerely pray for another I thank God
[1:05:35] for tonight I thank God sometimes we try
[1:05:39] to do something a little different so it
[1:05:41] was not the normal routine of things and
[1:05:44] I trust then that you would listen to it
[1:05:46] again are we going to put it up and take
[1:05:48] heed because God is speaking I see God
[1:05:52] using but either called using but uh
[1:05:54] Anthony called using for the Stephen
[1:05:57] called using bergerian God is using he
[1:06:00] has no other voice but your voice your
[1:06:03] ears and hands and feet he wants to use
[1:06:06] you of course the devil will say you are
[1:06:09] not usable or or why uh we'll look at
[1:06:12] the condition I'm in there's no way God
[1:06:14] could use me but sometimes God take it
[1:06:16] through stuff and the stuff that God
[1:06:18] take you through is to help somebody
[1:06:19] else I remember somebody came to me
[1:06:22] counseling abused as a child and said
[1:06:25] but what if God have your abuse
[1:06:28] condition to help other abused people
[1:06:29] because they have people that have been
[1:06:31] abuse and they don't want to manage it
[1:06:33] or go through their mind and thoughts
[1:06:35] and the stress of the whole experience
[1:06:37] but here it is somebody who gets
[1:06:39] strength and inner strength and say you
[1:06:40] know what I've been there and God has
[1:06:42] made me whole you see and I talk to
[1:06:45] people I say you know they get a cut on
[1:06:47] the outside together in your hand you
[1:06:49] could Stitch it up you could see it heal
[1:06:51] up and whatnot but what about the inside
[1:06:53] hurts what about the inside Cuts who
[1:06:56] sees that is it really healed and that's
[1:06:58] why I love the question will you
[1:07:00] remember all
[1:07:01] whole to be wholesome in Mind and Spirit
[1:07:05] not one put up not Twisted not religious
[1:07:08] not not fanatical but balance all orange
[1:07:12] not not not not lemon and tangelo sweet
[1:07:16] on one side and so on your next side
[1:07:17] come on the Middle with the orange it's
[1:07:20] tough to find out right now because it
[1:07:22] has some crazies out here and we don't
[1:07:25] want you to be crazy
[1:07:26] right so you cannot self-righteous
[1:07:28] yourself and think that yourself right
[1:07:30] but you could trust God trust in his
[1:07:33] blood trust in his Providence and his
[1:07:35] ability the one and the Bible says who
[1:07:38] started the work is able to complete it
[1:07:41] at the end that is Heavenly Father we
[1:07:45] thank you tonight and as the Believers
[1:07:47] pray Lord may they confess their sins
[1:07:49] and may the crowd unto you and call upon
[1:07:52] your name this may be a lash cry this
[1:07:54] may be the door just before that
[1:07:57] breakthrough father that that you sent
[1:08:00] brother Kelly is out here tonight to
[1:08:01] share this Lord and he says God works on
[1:08:04] both sides I just love it because that's
[1:08:06] how you work you put it in my heart to
[1:08:08] ask him and he was ready to receive it
[1:08:11] act upon it Lord it was just yesterday
[1:08:14] oh God and after the Wednesday night
[1:08:16] service and I could just send him a
[1:08:18] message and so on today's Friday and he
[1:08:21] was ready to share and poured his heart
[1:08:24] and I told him take the limit to share
[1:08:27] what you wanted to share he has that
[1:08:29] Liberty that's what we we do father we
[1:08:31] want to know what's in people's heart
[1:08:33] and he has a burden that other people
[1:08:35] might be delivered and the experience
[1:08:36] you have he says he's in another world
[1:08:38] and this is where brother Branham lives
[1:08:40] another world unless where the bride is
[1:08:42] going to be in the little world in this
[1:08:44] world but there's another world but
[1:08:46] Jesus said he prayed for them not that
[1:08:49] they'll be taken out of the world but to
[1:08:50] keep them in the world oh God we pass
[1:08:52] through hell every single day but we
[1:08:55] pray for preservation we pray for
[1:08:57] deliverance we pray for restoration we
[1:08:59] pray is that those who struggle they
[1:09:01] can't seem to snap out of it may they
[1:09:03] snap of it I'll snap out of it tonight
[1:09:05] here is a genuine testimony Lord you
[1:09:07] give yourself some money about two three
[1:09:09] years ago and it still holds it's not
[1:09:11] something fraudulent or something
[1:09:13] temporary is a work that you have done
[1:09:15] there's a work that have a witness it is
[1:09:18] a work that you have confirmed and
[1:09:20] father the work that you began is it it
[1:09:22] shows up in you it reflects you oh God
