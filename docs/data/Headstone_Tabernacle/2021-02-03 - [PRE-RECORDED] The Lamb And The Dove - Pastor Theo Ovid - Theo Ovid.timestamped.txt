[20:25] heaven
[20:26] father god may you send grace upon every
[20:28] soul here tonight
[20:30] and those that would hear this message
[20:32] speak to our hearts and transform our
[20:34] lives
[20:35] we say yes to your word to your truth in
[20:38] these difficult times
[20:40] guide us by your word great jehovah may
[20:42] the fire of god go before us the dove
[20:44] come and
[20:45] lead the eagles this evening in gsm we
[20:48] ask it
[20:49] amen and amen we have one scripture this
[20:51] evening from sin john chapter 1
[20:54] from verse 29 to 33 we want to go
[20:57] straight to the word of god
[20:58] this evening
[21:09] so in john chapter 1 verse 29 we read
[21:14] the next day john see jesus coming unto
[21:17] him and saith behold
[21:18] the lamb of god which take away the sin
[21:21] of the world
[21:23] this is he of whom i said after me
[21:27] commit a man which is preferred before
[21:30] me
[21:31] for he was before me and i knew him not
[21:34] but that he should be made manifest to
[21:36] israel therefore i might
[21:39] come baptizing with water
[21:42] and john bear record saying
[21:46] i saw the spirit descending from heaven
[21:49] like a dove
[21:51] and it abored upon him and i knew him
[21:54] not
[21:55] but he that sent me to baptize with
[21:58] water
[21:59] the same said unto me upon whom
[22:02] thou shalt see the spirit descending
[22:07] and remaining on him
[22:11] the same is he which baptize it
[22:14] with the holy ghost may god a bless the
[22:17] blessing of the reign of his word father
[22:18] we pray
[22:19] that you would take this word and take
[22:21] like an arrow and drive it straight into
[22:23] our hearts
[22:24] we ask in jesus name amen you may be
[22:26] seated
[22:28] i like that description that john harvey
[22:31] in verse 33
[22:33] upon whom thou shall see the spirit
[22:37] descending and
[22:40] remaining on him the same is he which
[22:44] baptized it with the holy ghost
[22:46] so what he's also seeing the spirit
[22:48] could descend and not
[22:50] remain but you want the spirit to
[22:53] descend
[22:54] and remain so this evening i have a
[22:57] title
[23:00] the lamb and the dove i'll have an
[23:03] inspiration
[23:04] dove leading eagle
[23:08] oh blessed be the name of the lord
[23:10] praise god
[23:12] give the lord some praising
[23:14] [Applause]
[23:19] hallelujah the dove
[23:23] to lead the eagles not some man to leave
[23:26] the eagles
[23:27] the dove to lead the eagles
[23:31] god promised eagles in the last days
[23:33] hallelujah
[23:35] eagles that could gather together
[23:38] eagles that could soar isn't that right
[23:42] eager to have built-in things in them to
[23:43] overcome to fly into this storm
[23:46] so i want to share some things from the
[23:49] message of the same title lama
[23:50] and dove and and i read the scripture
[23:53] this morning remember the former things
[23:54] of old
[23:55] for i am god and there is none else i am
[23:57] god and there is none like me
[23:59] declaring the end from the beginning and
[24:02] from ancient times the things
[24:04] that are not yet done saying my counsel
[24:07] shall
[24:08] stand and i will do all
[24:11] my pleasure and i love that that god
[24:14] could declare
[24:15] the end from the beginning so he doesn't
[24:18] have to wait for everything to unfold
[24:20] he could speak a word and that word is
[24:23] yet to be but you believe it and that's
[24:26] fate
[24:27] it's the substance of what you're hoping
[24:29] for he could speak a word
[24:31] of your life ten years from now to come
[24:33] and that can't fail
[24:34] because whatever god said got to come to
[24:36] pass it gotta it's truth
[24:39] isn't that right it can't fail like i
[24:41] think one time in the prayer line or
[24:42] disagreement
[24:43] uh but obama must call on a woman and
[24:45] say i live in such and such a place in
[24:46] such a simple place
[24:47] and her friend was nearby but she's not
[24:49] living there i know and whatnot
[24:51] and she was doubting and afterwards when
[24:53] he wouldn't get exposed she said hey i
[24:54] forget to tell you i move out last week
[24:57] praise god she taught me woman was lying
[24:59] it wasn't true
[25:00] but god would can feel god knows all
[25:03] things
[25:04] so you are challenged to lift your feet
[25:06] up and trust god
[25:08] and watch the devil and laugh in his
[25:10] face because god counsel will stand
[25:13] i'm not hearing you this evening glory
[25:15] to god
[25:16] he said my counsel shall stand and i
[25:20] shall do all my pleasure oh glory please
[25:23] god to pour his spirit upon you that's
[25:26] why he said this is my beloved son
[25:28] in whom i am well pleased to dwell in
[25:31] oh glory to god john didn't know who it
[25:33] was all he know god tell him a sign
[25:36] the one upon whom you see the spirit
[25:38] descending and remaining
[25:40] that's the one to identify oh glory to
[25:43] god that me the spirit have to come down
[25:45] nobody could stop it because the spirit
[25:48] is promised in the last days
[25:49] it shall come to pass afterwards i will
[25:52] pour out my
[25:53] spirit young men shall see visions old
[25:56] men shall dream dreams
[25:58] upon my handmaidens i will pour out my
[26:01] spirit
[26:02] in the last days no demon could stop it
[26:05] the little hell has been uncovered and
[26:08] that can't even stop it
[26:10] filthy demons can't stop it i don't care
[26:12] what the devil put out there
[26:14] god's purpose and counsel must stand
[26:17] we letting the devil know that today i
[26:20] don't care what
[26:20] happened in your life in the times past
[26:23] he has declared
[26:24] the end from the beginning oh give the
[26:26] lord a shout
[26:28] praise god where was thou when i lay the
[26:31] foundation of the earth
[26:32] and the mornings i sang together and the
[26:35] sons of god shouted for joy
[26:37] you didn't have depression back there
[26:39] you wasn't struggling to pay your bills
[26:40] back there
[26:41] no you were having a great time when you
[26:44] saw the cap coming on the pyramid
[26:46] isn't that right you were shouting you
[26:48] were praising god
[26:49] you wasn't teary-eyed and depressed and
[26:52] fed up and wanted to give up
[26:53] and you can't take it no more he wasn't
[26:55] talking like that
[26:57] you were shouting and praising god

[27:03] from we're here to tell you
[27:06] where you go in and the devil have no
[27:08] part with you
[27:09] because he came in the beginning but you
[27:11] were before the beginning
[27:13] that's why we are here this evening
[27:15] that's why the spirit had to find jesus
[27:17] because jesus was a son he was a born
[27:20] son
[27:20] he was a predestinated son and the
[27:23] spirit had to find him
[27:25] at the appointed time when his time came
[27:28] nothing could stop it the pharisees
[27:30] couldn't stop it
[27:31] the sadducees couldn't stop it the
[27:33] spirit of god
[27:35] descended upon him and john saw it
[27:38] he said the spirit jesus is upon me
[27:41] because he had anointed me and if jesus
[27:44] had to be anointed you have got to be
[27:48] anointed give the lord a shout of praise
[27:51] therefore you are here to dare to

[37:18] meet unto repentance and all you've seen
[37:20] is a natural progression
[37:22] of humans being baptized in water

[37:28] didn't see a human
[37:29] this day john saw a dove he saw the
[37:33] spirit

[37:38] this was the first time they saw
[37:41] the spirit descending as a dove
[37:45] upon the lamb oh glory to god

[38:49] us how to get out of the way
[38:52] all those virtues was to bring us to a
[38:56] place
[38:56] where our spirit is broken where we lost
[39:00] our own will our own choices and our own
[39:03] way
[39:04] where we surrender totally and
[39:07] completely

[43:51] oh glory let me read something brother
[43:54] branham
[43:55] you may be seated it's a strange thing
[43:58] to think that when god chose to
[44:02] represent the son on
[44:03] it he represents him in a creature
[44:06] called a lamb
[44:07] and many times we might wonder why he
[44:10] was called a lamb
[44:12] a lamb is the meekest of all creatures
[44:15] of the earth
[44:16] there is nothing more mika than a lamb
[44:20] and the orthodox church knew they had to
[44:22] offer up a lamb
[44:23] as a substitute for sin knowing that god
[44:26] had passed the penalty of death
[44:28] and something must die and the life was
[44:31] in the blood
[44:32] and the life was in jesus christ and he
[44:35] was the lamb of god
[44:36] and the virgin mary was overshadowed
[44:39] by the holy spirit and god created in a
[44:42] womb
[44:43] a blood cell that brought forth the
[44:46] messiah
[44:47] jesus christ it was the blood cell of
[44:49] god
[44:50] that when he died and the bloodshed was
[44:52] broken
[44:53] the spirit was released to call and
[44:56] bring forth
[44:57] other sons of god you heard what i said
[45:00] when he died at calvary and his blood
[45:03] cell was broken
[45:04] the spirit was released in every age
[45:08] and not one of them missed it because
[45:10] god purpose
[45:11] must stand he has declared the end
[45:15] from the beginning in other words he see
[45:18] it here
[45:19] and come back here and work it out right
[45:21] here
[45:22] you not hear what i am saying he sees
[45:25] the
[45:25] end he come back to the beginning and
[45:28] start from here
[45:30] we are going to where we come from and
[45:32] we come from where we are going
[45:34] give the lord a shout in the house this
[45:37] evening
[45:38] [Applause]

[45:53] creature

[46:00] we can't make our own way we have to
[46:03] lean upon his arm
[46:04] upon his guidance notice the makers of
[46:07] birds
[46:08] is the dove and many times it represents
[46:11] the holy spirit
[46:13] and notice the dove is a sign of peace
[46:15] wonderful peace
[46:16] the dove is one bird the crow is a
[46:19] scavenger another bird
[46:21] he can't eat the diet of a scavenger
[46:24] because his makeup is different he has
[46:26] no gall
[46:27] he has no bitterness he has no god he
[46:30] has no bitterness
[46:32] he can't digest the things of the world
[46:35] he can only eat clean and pure things
[46:38] he's the type of the christian that
[46:40] packs the dove in his heart

[46:44] bitterness they do you this or what

[57:02] hallelujah hallelujah in every age
[57:05] the heart of a people that god must
[57:07] anoint but listen to this
[57:09] why did he choose the lamb and the dove
[57:12] it's because the dove could not abide in
[57:14] nothing else
[57:15] but a lamb the natures are the same let
[57:18] me drop this in here
[57:20] all these ministers impersonating
[57:23] ranking the self criminal self himself
[57:25] pretending himself playing himself
[57:27] and the beef on display but abram said
[57:30] it takes a humble heart dedicated to god
[57:34] to bring jesus christ in the present
[57:36] tense
[57:37] so after a while all he talked where get
[57:39] exposed you know all the male champions
[57:42] all who are only voicing and talking and
[57:44] yapping and they're not leaving anything
[57:46] and they have nothing to show god all
[57:49] that can get exposure
[57:50] because it takes a humble heart
[57:52] dedicated to god
[57:54] so when jesus took his belt and beat
[57:57] them out the temple
[57:58] that was humble heart wrecking the show
[58:02] and telling them my father's house shall
[58:04] be called a house of prayer
[58:06] don't miss the take mistake for
[58:08] arrogance or bad behavior no
[58:09] no he was angry
[58:11] [Applause]
[58:13] you ever see a man angry with a smile
[58:15] what kind of anger is there
[58:19] he was angry he was angry because he was
[58:22] corrupting the house of god
[58:24] with money changes and selling of doves
[58:27] and birds
[58:28] and he beat them up and showed them over
[58:30] the tables and whatnot
[58:31] he was angry say my father's the zeal of
[58:34] my father's house
[58:35] had eaten me up this passion for the
[58:38] father's house
[58:39] and that's what god bringing inside of
[58:40] here certain things we have tolerated we
[58:42] will no longer tolerate
[58:44] we will smoke you up or smoke you out or
[58:46] you will choose your way out
[58:48] but this church is not going to be the
[58:50] same we're going to take some fire bombs
[58:52] and just throw it
[58:53] praise god that's what the trainers are
[58:55] going to do
[58:56] my god after you cross a border you'll
[58:57] blow up the bridge behind you

[59:39] back on ours
[59:40] he forced them to fight he forced them
[59:42] to press
[59:43] he forced them to say you know what my
[59:45] bird bone i've got to get the boats that
[59:47] they have
[59:48] and to get them you have to fight
[59:50] they're not giving you their boats

[1:08:33] together their natures were meek
[1:08:35] lonely humble they could pray together
[1:08:38] when god and christ became one
[1:08:39] then the dove came unto the lamb heaven
[1:08:41] and earth kissed each other
[1:08:43] god and man was reconciled together one
[1:08:45] of the greatest moment
[1:08:46] when the dove and the lamb came together
[1:08:49] if you watch the dove the reason it
[1:08:50] stayed
[1:08:51] on the lamb because the nature was the
[1:08:53] same and the reason the dove stays on
[1:08:55] the christian
[1:08:56] he will stay there as long as he's a
[1:08:58] lamb
[1:08:59] but when he takes a different nature the
[1:09:01] dove takes his flight

[1:09:55] willingness have you faced
[1:09:56] you're fussing forcing for what you have

[1:11:33] that challenge the demon powers in seven
[1:11:36] churches
