said after me cometh the man which is preferred before me for he was before me and I know him not but that it should be made manifest to Israel therefore am I come baptizing with water and John bear record saying I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a door and it bore upon him and I knew him not but he does sent me to baptize with water they same said unto me upon whom thou shalt see the spirit descending and remaining on him the same is he which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost and I saw on their record that this is the son of God amen verse 35 again the next day after John student two of his disciples and looking upon Jesus as he walked he saith behold the lamb of god chapter 2 verse 23 now when he was in Jerusalem at the Passover in the fish day many believed in his name when they saw the miracles which he did but Jesus did not commit himself to them because he knew all men and needed know that any should testify of men for he knew what was in man amen a lot an expense will be nervous or wash our heads on a prayer at wishes Heavenly Father what we thank you for grace to be back in your house this morning all we thank you for the tremendous times of fellowship and feasting on the world that you have given us though we're blessed beyond measure already and lo if you had a go home already even from the very first day Lord it was worth the effort to be here like a prophet

individual to be here again I think this is a fourth year of the meetings 40 of the minutes and for his deliverance under the talkin so we think got to be here thinking about the feel for the imitation to be here and just unmarried was brought the family the church the great hits in seven are go for the tremendous feeling of welcome and hospitality that we have filled these past few days we always feel that when we come here it always feels like home I want to thank you so very much for everything on behalf of my wife and the family and our personal budgeting leaders with you as you thank you also what our skin craves all the you know may said we have a few have to introduce quite a little nice just from between that and thank you for coming to be with us fellowship with us on our little confirmation here and thank you very much for the church is I've been here the believers from the Church of different ones like what idealistic yesterday if the believers are here we can pursue to to Cheers other other wall so I know women is that sometimes say like I know if one person comes will preach you know but I know if only one person is sitting here I can say it will not be as exciting I can tell you that so thank you for coming thank you for taking the paints Islam God richly bless you amen and to my ministry brethren what is it thank you I always see these and everybody thinks that you're saved but frankly speaking the brothers I mean I'm looking for the Regis now and that's the preacher I want to be like when I grow up seriously and brother very happy on the look at you nine when you roll up your sleeves I somehow I always miss it but I'll keep my eyes glued open tonight to see when you roll up those sleeves and what can we say brother Peter Chandler Peter Peter I always say I tell my folks they don't come any more gentlemanly number the peerage and he's always been the same gentlemanly as Porteous respectful just as soon as they can come when Peter thank you for your message a man thank you for the message the New Testament in my blog and you know in in I mean this is cricket country right these run Lara's country right all right because I know in cricket I play some cricket growing up so I wasn't that good but I didn't talk all the time either seriously but even cricket you want to get an opening batsman who can you don't want to get maybe the first ball he's bored out it demoralizes the whole team so you want to get somebody who can be there I'm blocked the balls and make some runs some for some six hit the boundary a few times I'm gonna challenge like that on this team here but the channel on always had to like you know just grip the world and so it gives those of us coming behind some confidence to come like that brother Peter code would be a Vosges in the back in the hip pin them to the wall come on we get most trained thank you for the China now as the man owes the New Testament in my blog and burp it has always been like that and then when Solomon mechina came behind and he was make me feel old Solomon approaches I'm not that old [Applause] because Salamone they're talking about you know we young for classic and truly true I mean to see this young man growing up brother Isaac brother Solomon but a deli is now focusing on boy isn't a category really he's not in my group he's in their group you know so to see like you see like your children coming behind and you know pushing the battle to the enemies come you just want to thank about the ceremony thank you for your lovely message thank you so much I should less you thank you thank you and what can I say about brother Jesse Robledo brother Jesse you know that Jessie and we thank God for you and thank you I said easy I'm almost every year but but adjacency about you you know young men you know like in their thirties even and they you know like fairies and they will come to Nigeria you know the early nineties and leave their children behind Lee the families behind over Christmas to minister to us and we never forgot that because those meetings did a lot to establish you know Orson v Nigeria so brother Jesse you think it's a very much thank you for your message there was really tremendous tremendous never changed to the same fire growing WJZ and yesterday morning my young man but ideally at the Lord thank you for delay for your message and what I love about him is you know he is very respectful and very low-key and he's got a rich man's gift and you saw that yesterday morning and the dealer thank you so much my message to question and last night I can't be sure but it doesn't let me sing that so I'll do what the obvious is the Liana of Cote d'Ivoire from Apollo 9 JK what can we say about last night hello Paul that was absolutely outstanding thank you so very much and you should know there was so much power coming through here because the first time I'm symbol 18 first time I'm seeing wiped out brother Etienne Dawson get tired three services for services 576 services at the end of it you were tired and you Pete only wants and he's gone from sick son is strong well last night there was so much power brother 18 in Estill he'll thank about the palm but Etienne thank you amen brother Ballentine thank you thank you amen and so you should after the premise is your you like crumb cake seriously Maurice there maybe we'll give them crumb cake I said I don't even think this is going to be up to what you call crumb cake maybe sponge cake maybe sponge cake is which is maybe sponge cake well you take a choice you know you take a peek because after those messages that have gone forth I don't want to say they took my notes that's like a cliche you know but I don't know notes brother Raymond says same here I'm just trying to warn you up front so you don't have the messages to write the preachers are preached now brother ray is the preacher he is coming to preach tonight but so you have all the pigeon so I can just talk right I can just oh I can just talk alright thank you so I can just talk to you your other preachers I'm not I mean I say that but you know for a joke or whatever I'm not half the preachers these brothers are but somehow it's my lot but the fume ones going to speak a little warts or a few words so I will try my best and I really feel sorry for me if you don't feel sorry for me I feel sorry for me amen well so I got a little title this morning God shall declare a lump again amen okay I'm trying to keep track of my time here so I don't hold you up too long so God shall declare lamb again and a little inspiration lamb for one house which of course but the fuels inspirational ease the inventor message is to apply the talking and we know the even ten messages brother branham's message that God sent to us through that great larger profit of Malachi 4ma now we call the message the event a message but the evening time message if you don't know what it is is to apply the talking and the main sense of trying the series of the services to like let us understand what it means to apply the talking and I'm going to carry on the same trend this morning and brother Branham said and he's been quoted back and forth so I don't really have to quit but maybe I just read to you but the velum said the talk and when you pray the talk in September 1st 1963 started talking when it came in the night and picked desperations he said the talking message this morning he said it was the highlight of my ministry is in terms of regular service preaching the message this money was the cap impact of my ministry the talking the caffeine pad amen let me just let me just get a quote for you from brother Branham here all right he said this morning the message this morning was to me the highlights measure of my internal ministry this morning she had mercy on my entire ministry some day I'll tell you how I come about and I know that everything has worked for months and months and months up to that one message moving up to come to that place that was the cap in of time of it you see and I'm sure I hope you get what the talking meant the talk is the sign that the blood has been applied now that the price has been asked require of God Jesus paid the price by shed his own blood he did that then from his life came the Holy Spirit and when the blood is applied to you the Holy Spirit talking that your price is paid God has received you and as the talking remember that is the talking now what is saying here is that God gives you the talking which is the Holy Spirit when you have applied the blood amen very simple very simple but you know too many times so many of these things become clichés tours we just say the things without really looking at what it means and if we just here's the world and you don't really apply it the Bible says if you hear the word and you don't apply it you are like a man who looks in the mirror and straightaway he forgets what he looks like so we look into the mirror of the world and see what it tells us are way cooler from there and I apply to our lives to let the word mix with our lives amen glory to God amen amen nice a product of 28 now this man I told you been not with you I thought we had another two or three our message this morning but I just got started and I thought I just carried that over for tonight but it was just such a menace I don't know what other people got it or not I hope the two every I hope they do everywhere and I hope there was some good tips on it so he can be carried out to be known that I believe it all the mister I ever brought that that that that solidly was ordained of God outside of a cause the regular Commission like the seven states and things that was directly the Word of God I'm talking about a message to preach I believe that one was it see the one that's needed to follow these seven seals now watch what's come after the seven seals that uniting of the people your Nana's signs red light flashing you know he said you know he said after the mysteries in the book of finished and finished all over then it's time for the cyst on the backside which is the seven thunders on the back of the book because Malachi fought the great and larger profit he had the authority the seven thunders and put them speaking for the back of the book in the world but it said when the inside with the mysteries are finished then it's time for the back side seven thunders so watch what is saying here he said now watch what's come after the seven seals the you none of the people united signs the red light flashing in the last days the son of the women getting prettier and man what they would do all these signs of the holy sprit leenock then come right back here to the capping off of all those messages in the seven seals is captive in this one thing the token that we are all right now put a better prick the token you can be sure you can you're talking I don't know it's all right is the right talking for the right Johnny at the right price you cannot make sure amen the talking that way all right see just check ourselves and see if we're in the faith a miracle it was a man in the Bible Jesus was called the Lamb of God when John saw him coming he said behold the lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world not the scenes of the world for the parent since the attributes of sin since a lion fornication and all that stuff those are attributes of sin but Sheen is unbelief so Jesus Christ the lamb came to picks in at its roots to get sin at its origin to uproot and root at unbelief that's why Jesus came behold the lamb of God which taketh away the sin of the roll glory to God a man when you see the lamp on the scene you're no redemption is taking place when you see the lamb in the picture you're no sin has made its master I said sin has met its master when you see the lamp of God on the sin Oh Lord oh god hallelujah amen glory the holy man so when the lamb comes in the picture you know right away it's time to be talking to yourself to be having a conversation see ugly as hell that sin has made its master seen as marriage Waterloo and to rejoice them to tense them to shout because you know the difference they're at the door the master is come and they call it for thee oh where are you here this morning you got some same problem because some pundits problem you can tell rejoice in the master is in the house master Jesus the great lamp of God is in the house behold the lamb of God we together with the scene of the world he will get your sin and it's very roots and root it out and set you free Morry Oh Laura don't call him an amen you know in the Bible when you see a lamb right down through the Bible when you see the lamb the animal the lamb is a 10 if our redemption every papal reader knows that but the bleeding blood lamb like we see in Revelation 5 that's the Redeemer because not just the lamp is the lamb that has shed his blood so the lamb represent redemption amen but the linen body lamb represents the Redeemer who are shed its blood but if people can be redeemed Oh hallelujah question why would God use the lamb and an email to the pure redemption why would God like many times use the lamb to the police children you and I why will God use even himself as a lamb behold the lamb of God which takes away the sin of the world very simple answer simply because this animal and though the critic treated it like every other sin equation but the animal of the lamb has the qualities that God expects to see in sons and daughters of God who are walking the road to redemption and that's why he uses the lamb as a symbol of redemption is the lamb as the article of redemption use the land to represent Redemption all the time that's why he call him stuff also the Lamb of God amen Oh glory to God a man I know the story another story is missing his nose already so crumb cake or sponge cake now animals I to fall bean you know that you know that's the amen Aya's don't have you all and we human beings that go use the redemption I mean they are the lamb to represent our Redemption we are three full beam we have a soul and the animal doesn't have a soul now there's a disconnect nation where all through the Old Testament years all through the course of many years from their sojourn in Egypt all the way to when they came out and God will reap our of them immemorial down through the years when they came out of Egypt the talking and in the assessment years in the wilderness years all around the world have the ceremony and every year they will come to the high priest and lay they bring their lamb leave their hand upon that lamb or he could or whatever and it would take it has seen away for one year and they'll come back again which we know the story what I'm going to show you something I want to show you something you know we know that the life of the lamp could not come back upon the believer the worshipper how many know that say Amen we know that so why will God do it when the life of the lamb could not come back simply because the lamb doesn't have a soul and we have a soul so where's the life the life can come from a spirit of the lamb into man's soul does it is connect there but God let versus happen to let you see there's a need for redeemer and this is just a substitute that we are gonna go to no pick+ gonna allow and accept and that alone lets you know there's a real thing to come in there's a real lamb coming down the road this is not the real am all those substituted autism and I'm not the real thing and there were only a super until the real lamb become a man the Lamb of God which takes away the sin of the world amen I want to follow up on the dealer and brother Peter so I'm all school but I feels trying to get me to a new school all these years and so I wonder can you give me the first pitch oh it's alright alright I do this once once before in about three years ago and some information Nigeria it feels good to or I take a look at this take a look at this an animal has a body and a spirit all animals have their own nature too just like you have your nature a lion is the king of the jungle it will grow back oh and every other animal will keep quiet and don't go back you know it could will do whatever they have the different nature's animals everybody and their spirit that's where the nature is controlled from because they have my soul but look at man that's you and I we have three compartments a body I mean a soul a spirit anybody for us our our nature is controlled from the soul and that's what the branch that the soul is the nature of the Spirit in other words the soul gives them give the spirit its nature so whatever nature you sure you have it's hiding somewhere in your soul that's the origin of the control center that gives you the attitude thing character whatever it is that you have is right in the soul is not the things that anti Amanda polluting man is the things that go from inside man to the outside are pollute him can you say Amen no God so here's the problem this animal here even though a seamless but it can transfer its spirit into men's so where men's nature's control from so all the two tools lay hand on your sacrifice identify your sacrifice and course is the innocent life of that lamb and forgive you for one whole year but because the lamb didn't have the power to transfer its own power to not sing to them they just go and I cannot show you right a few days after they were back doing the same things again back doing the same things again I'm just hoping that next year we'll go again and put a handle it was almost like a license to the scene there was no real labor and effort to like steal the tool that's why Israel so many times so many times Israel pursuing title Israel sinned Israel ditched off when Coe will punish them right after they'll go back again because the blood of bulls and goats did not have power to take over to take else in and so their men perpetually sinners can you say man and thus I was in the Old Testament years and anybody and everybody knew this cannot be the prophet pattern no it can be this was just a substitute amen to just show they had a clear conscience they don't want to do wrong and God will increase forgive them that's how it was amen onto the Lamb of God Jesus Christ came but why Israel Wow will they not be able to do the right even though they know what is the right thing to do why don't they do the right thing what I want you and I to the wrath and even though we know they were thing to do that's why the talking come class while the talking come behold the lamb of God which takes away the scene of the wall it comes to you today comes to you tomorrow come see wherever you are to take care of the same problem I'm not talking about being the message I'm talking about this same problem being taken care of because Israel know what was the right to do but they could not do it so it's not it is not knowing the right thing to do it is not knowing the message is the power to leave about the scene that's what we are talking about that's what the talking is about the swapper Roberto preached Redemption by blood and by power oh you know why Israel could not even though the new could not leave above the wrong and they say you know why the emotions the emotions università for image crumb cake thank you I know you're trying to make me feel good you are very kind of very lovely all right just bear with me my you know but I want to show you why Israel the new water ready to do and they still won't do the right thing you know when the man fell in the camera Vidan the Bible said ah nothing but a regret over the deal if somebody mention it but Adam knew what was right Adam wasn't deceived Adam noon and the same way many times were not deceived when you're too wrong you know that can I get a witness can I get a witness Adam wasn't received Eve was beguiled to see but Adam was not deceived so what happened emotions emotions the next slide please next picture all right forgive me I did a few years of medical school so you gotta forgive me I'm an ex doctor don't tell me I have a headache watch it I have a headache drinks some what a lot of water or something I mean forget it now forgetting all about medical stuff I forgot me I wasn't a good scene in school anyway so - leave it for so many years together forgotten - forgive this now Israel like you and I human beings don't make Israel they're very rebellious just like you and I are very rebellious and that's what the token each one knew was what to do and even do the right thing when Adam sinned Genesis 3 oh I didn't get my conduct Kryptos but when Adam sinned and either sin and the fair and God drove them out of the garden God said God said now that the man has become like one of us knowing good and evil let's drag him out so he won't take his him and taught you cannot achieve life and live forever and then the Bible says for eternal roaring do testament to his that know to do good and to I did not dream in the scene can somebody give me an amen no you didn't hear me you did not hear me no he did not hear me God sent Adam out because he has become like one of us the ability to be like God is to know good and evil like God looks upon the earth it is the same it is the wrong is this the fitness but doesn't kill you is he still does good all the time but landed the money come like one cost and he knows the man doesn't have the capacity to do good all the time like that and just straight his head in his political state to the tree of life and live forever don't drop him out these were only shown improve the atoms children can run by the same atomic nature that the flower brought in knowing good and evil but no ability no power no no no no no where we fell to show the wrong and to the right not just Israel using the same for today amen already talking about the talking but delay my little bad husband wife and you know your family try to get them in I'm gonna see how long they're but I want to focus on you on you to make sure that the talking really is taking effect in your life our emotions nobody teaches us how to manage them how to take care of them how to recognize them how to overcome them how to dominate them nobody teaches us that we got to school will end all the MBAs all the things i'ma go into the workforce going to life nobody teaches how to ahem let me turn on in children in school and many times on at home either but the parable says baba says paul romans heaven they love debate about paul room and seven where was he was he saying it or not say know that i'll answer that question for you know you can keep it there today Paul said what I want I would not when good is present with me when I want to do good evil is very present what's wrong with me who shall deliver me from the body of this death who shall deliver me parked right out the great Apostle Paul but we make like normal mean I'm all for calming and overcoming I'm overcoming lie many times sly know that when overcoming what brother Panza is the little things you leave undone those are things our eternal destination all right oh yeah wait Ryan bean and I said the head let you know all the senses of the body see smell taste hear feel or touch whether you recognize it or not when you see or feel or hear what happens they're sent into your body by what they call electrical impulses going to your body your body don't your body that's why you can't see my electric shock because your body's like an electric station so you can receive a shot because it get connected and you get shocked so when you see all your feelings what you see is a feeling where it talks filaments everything just the touch know is beyond the torch what you see what you smell if you smell good food it's a feeling if you taste that sponge cake mmm it's the feeling that's right if you have a sound like Braille errors causing you know boundary like a six or something and healthy push out is a feeling and every feeling what happens it pass through your body and go is going to the brain is headed for your frontal lobe right behind your forehead that's where all of the signals are interpreted I'm sorry little science labs right Oh science labs okay all right why do you do this to me so because you took you took it away like the Meccan see but delay take it away and you took their way so but delicious right for these signs one zero one class this morning so when the things they enter this is your spinal cord the comb ranchers manicott and enter through the base of your brain they're headed for the frontal lobe where you can think and this feeling is like smell well this flame is like a torch this feeling like a dish this is what I'm hearing are you with me all that is can trust in the period here in the frontal lobe but here's the problem I read this Jesus even that any much will generate by man because he knew all men and he knew also what was a man like this he made us equally knows he knows what we are made of he knows how we are wired consumerism [Applause] [Music] so all these sensations are your feelings I had a frontal lobe to interpret them he has the problem they have to pass through what they call the limbic system where your feelings take place where emotionless ticklish that were really should issue emotions why emotions take place so I spit spray Lawrence Hey and that sound comes to him as a feeling and it goes through his spinal cord base of his brain and before he gets the frontal lobe at the oh but I always talk to me for my own good it goes with emotions look at how shouted at me Cheryl I mean and if you're bad and you took back what she shot at me like that weight added to you la pata Tennessee yesterday husband gets home wife gets home while says honey great well the process in it by you it comes here enters here emotions mother and so what yes I had it so so later later this office business split second things be my field my wife is just trying to compliment me too we know how we are we do the action first stupid irresponsible and then we think later that's who we are that's who you are me I'm not like that that is who you are that's how you are wired can you say Amen I'm almost done almost done so we are wired to react before we think our emotions just reactive before we think I know what that's how animals are because the animal only has the brain don't have a soul I must have a brain and they're thinking since that is very primitive but animals are based on especially the ones close to human beings the chimpanzees and all that they are like people who study mama I mean primal behavior knows our brains that fashion the same way this primitive brain here is all about your emotions your feelings and unfortunately for us we are wired to respond by emotion before we even think and that's where is the problem that is the problem it's your problem my problem is a human problem it is not just your watch problem is your problem to you he's not your husband swap it's your problems you and when it gets this put here you don't care who else has the problem you see Lord have a problem I want my problem solved hey man so we have come to the great convention applying the talking not even to a message and we know all these things but that's here that's here the frontal lobe so won't we leave here tomorrow morning and we go home we think automatically we're going to stop doing the things no no I'm not going to pour cold water on your excitement just trying to tell you the truth because the same session would happen exactly is this a hotel her husband and that emotions can run while he's reacting he's thinking right I will have the action between this but he just can't stop himself so that's our problem there that's the problem right there before the ticket I'll just take a look at it for finish crumb cake class right just ready for a few minutes and just thinking about you all the things you've read in this minute here the boy speaking to you like that son daughter you're gonna make you got to make amends here you're gonna change here this here he's gonna stand in the way amen Thank You brothers so God knew all of this don't you that and that's why he knew men will hardly ever be able to live by the commandments of God on their own because of the way they are structured because of the way they are made and that's why he will let them come every year I wouldn't tell them that why do you do this in again no I didn't notice it again because you knew that's just how they are structured is waiting for the time when the Lamb of God who is gonna take away the sin is gonna solve for you this problem the Lamb of God will solve for you this problem can you say Amen and he has already solved that problem MA [Applause] amen so what he got do what he got do what he got you God in the beginning when he made Adam and Eve he knew right away that this year he's gonna make them have a pram with even keeping the word so what he did they had a control center outside of the brain a control center which is an S soul like the king when he speaks these ones will learn up when he speaks emotions Lana when he speaks feelings manner when he speaks reason legs up [Applause] so God you made money 3 for Ben let me have this frosted picture back again I'm in the soul of man he put the control center you know was this calm person that I put there we each know the story already God before the foundation of the world and all of that I don't want to go over that because you know that but God you put your seed which is the person of himself which is your connection with God it put that seed in the soul and that's see I don't wish that all the time but that seed is what will bring from the miracle hallelujah is not a sin like your mango seed is a seed of God and everything is in that seed and that seed will bring for his own time and it's just seed it were people of God's kind and whatever you are supposed to be is already in that seed [Applause] so what happens what happens the fillings come into your body Jai emotions we want to react the control center in the soul tells it no don't to that these are split-second things but that's exactly what happens that's what a Christians behavior is different that's why Christian doesn't you can't even explain yourself because the silicon remains in you the sinner God the sinner God contains every bad behavior until have Reaper habits let me read you some things I knew that let me do some things in memory some things here but the problem said intellectually we're hearing the message and intellectually we have heard all these things here not because we're the lecturers no it simply means by our brains we understand these things but don't let the devil fool you but because you are understand actually is automatic you will do them because your emotions are gonna stand in the way Oh glory [Applause] let me read you this go for mother banner I'm almost done when I say I'm almost in that means I've got about one foot of the way thank you for your kind of understanding thank you all right so that's right that's two three quarters I have from the deli once after what is the message of the hour it's not message message of the minutes measure the hour so I should do at least an hour but Peter I gotta come to your school I can two of us in 45 minutes with two minutes I say man is like gurantee playing games alright great run oh ho chi long are you following me [Applause] alright let me just read this good here intellectually we have fought we're hearing the message but the Branum said here Amazing Grace this is from gospel a little washing practice of washing he said Amazing Grace how sweet the sound see just know we're ever explained what it is just take my word if you believe me he was talking about you know go me on the cotton of time be sure to make sure on every breach of the wall behind you I believe the judge is begin to hear the message and begin to understand it people say we don't have to understand it's true in other words you don't have to do intellectual honest time to do it that's right but the Holy Spirit gives you some little understanding that will help you along the way but truly we don't have to understand like you explained by your intellect and all that but instead they try to be to understand the message but friends listen but you're on your intellectually understanding we've got to lay in the prints of a song we've gotta be ripened our faith even after you read all these glorious things this weekend our faith isn't a rapper yet intellectually we're here in the message that God has given us and seen the science that is shoulders I'm proving it by the Bible is there but all how the chat needs to lay in the presence in its presently ten days of you know and gets which in the spirit to come beat down sometimes in speaking the message you get hash you'll get hash and that limbic system emotions and say like well they talking to me like that doesn't say that you know it's my good it's the message it's the talk in sometimes with a message you can hash you have to break in like that because you've got to clinch and nail to make it home but well when the chat ones gets it the locker is called out and separated then in the presence of God I know it means something like the people was there when it takes its rapture so let's have the talking deal with this problem for all put emotions in its place so that would be you know act on what we know so that we will not be found sinful because it he that knows what to do and to a did not is not iniquity the Browse it to him it is seen that's why other was driven are they got a villain and we are not going to go back to Eden doing the same thing when what's right and not ruin it expect to go back to Eden that's why the talkin share the Lamb of God that takes away all the scene of the world Oh hallelujah it will take your every problem he will deliver every package or it'll God many men all right now I emotions and sickness is a big issue because we rise and fall on the ability to control our emotions what was in first Romans 7 the emotions of sin is the emotions of sin most every sin that you and I to our emotions make us do it so they can learn to master and control our emotions we will live much better than many of us are living even though we know the message we know what other plan I'm set to do we know love your brother loved your sister we know all of these things don't mean more young people know go to school and be a Christian Brothers know grown the job and be a Christian as you're talking now they're talking don't come to pat you on the back we're talking comes my house cleaning time a man to clean the stable to apprenticeship and make sure you are right with God Oh hallelujah glory the problem is many of us don't even know that we are controlled by these emotions we explain them away we justify them sure the reason why we act before we think and because of our ego because of our pride even when we have caught ourselves that what we did or said or or acted is wrong we would not say I am sorry we will say well yeah I talk like that because of the way you talk to meet you so well you know so what about that what is it even when you know this practical Christian living that's what the talking represents glory to God amen let me let me show you something here when we talk about emotions many of us can't even explain what it is we know if you study those things that you can check them out those of you who say those things there are five basic emotions that we have and every other emotion we have options of these emotions happiness anger sadness fear and shame happiness sadness fear anger shame run through your Bible you'll see you know this in different place in the Bible but these are the five major categories but every other emotion is under there anger can be you can be you can be sold so frustrated assuming that's some form of anger fear you can be scared stiff or you can just be like little afraid the different levels of the emotions and we think I'm no longer a slave to fear many of our second February bondage with so many other things some of us from the church hey brother Guido's we chose just know no harm we're just angry why we don't know why you took your cylinder just what is wrong with me why did I react to that brother like that you see I don't know then go meet him and say I'm sorry no let me give you a few a few things here happiness there's so many unions you can check them out happiness you can put there elation excitement your 3-yard amen you're fired up you don't follow when you're sad you're fired or you were you're cheerful you were glad you are contented you're pleased and so many other shades of emotions can come under happiness and sadness you can feel hurt you can feel sorrowful you can feel miserable you can feel heartbroken like Jesus was that broken on the cross you can feel let down you can feel unhappy you can feel disgusted you can feel on you can feel upset now be mad let sadness and so many other emotions that go with sadness and anger you can be enraged some are angry they're spitting fire some are angry you don't even see it they are very good at controlling their emotions they're angry they are born on the inside where they're just who this cool anger you can be annoyed irritated touchy Josep just please miss miss miss miss what did i do please just pochi just 30 what is it just angry it's an emotion you know you shouldn't do it but the limbic system your emotions are holding you captive fee is the big one fear I am no longer a slave to fear many of us I am going to fear that these guys are so many things and we just don't know it fear can come as fearful it can be petrified you can be apprehensive just the apprehension apprehension like I don't know something in the car everything that's fair that's fair and fair her torment despair the emotions just feel insecure just feel insecure just insecurities just don't know like that they don't love me in this church they don't want me the structure the way the process put to me way that they can talk to me they don't love industry that insecurity he is affair and those things were always a bondage never that was a for fear worried from a fear team eat fear and shame that's the last category where Isaac spoke to us and spooky elastin a I believe or two centers ago my people shall never be ashamed Shem you feel shame when you feel disgraced look anyways pastor talk to me look at the way that they can said look you feel disgraced before people shame when you even admonished for something that's your doing people just react with shame because the one is coming in and the Lummi stances I look at that is Grace in you that is Grace in you how do you talk to you like that how dare he because I'm in this church here on that church or whatever if you're disgraced you feel guilty when you are secretive like brother Isaac said when you don't things annual secretive it's change that makes you hide the things I should bring out in the open so you can get help and deliverance ship makes you had it under the table and the devil lost that shame and regret that's a big one shin regret you oh if only if only if only just live your life you look back 10 20 30 years just regrets like that Jim each of these emotions the limbic system or some day even when you know that's what was bomb said when the humanistic realm just walking by the debates of your mind you can make real progress as a Christian you were like any other man as Norfolk you are like an animal because animals only listen from this year they live from this year that's that's what you were like Amen glory to God amen and sleep by emotions you can see right away emotions can be a very very destructive force you can see in the fall in the for what happened sitting him to Eve have God said so sure what I said you shall not she's quoting from her frontal lobe what she need to be the right thing and she was right and the devil knew the Bible said but the venom said the serpent man he understood the principles of life he understood the principles of life he knew a prince that close to that's why you just a friend it was on his feet like a chimpanzee they're driven by the emotions and most are brings that close to that so what did he do to get her to drop what she knew God said what'd he do he said you shall not surely die you said no I shall die so he took it to her eyes and when she saw that the fruit the tree was Pooja and to make one wise have feelings she saw it she smelt it he put his hand upon her it felt good he felt it felt good so she began to say yeah this was good she was good disconnecting her from what she knew to be what God said disconnecting her disconnecting her and the Bible said when she tasted so it was a fruit to make one wise she took of it clean her mouth and get to a husband with her and that's how Cain and Abel came forth our parents who came straight from God could not beat this pathway and the devil knew that make them slaves to their emotions make them bound up to the emotions with any time so intellectually we have the message it's not enough that is not enough because too many things you and I know is the right to do and yet we will not do it because of our emotions can somebody say Oh hallelujah God amen amen amen Oh glory all right I'm skipping all this here amen so what are we here in this convention for we're here in this convention to meet the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world in other words he gets seen at these very roots no sins those that just those that just a small characteristics of sin to get at his various and I'm telling you the very roots of it know that Jesus knew all men here know what sin man then knows why they are acting the way they're acting where they are and where they are reacting where you understand these things you don't stand why your wife can get angry when there's no need for anger why your husband can be mad I mean when there's no need for it you know what's going on you know why your husband has been mean nasty the way he's or your son is just crazy the way is you understand those things because you understand these things here can you say Amen let me read you in France are you from Romans 7 Paul said verse 4 wherefore my brethren you also have become dead to the law by the body of Christ there should be married to another even to him who is raised from the dead that we should bring forth fruit unto God for when we were in the flesh humanistic the motions of scenes which were by the law did walk in our members to bring forth fruit unto death but now we are delivered from the law that being dead where we were held that we should serve in newness of spirit along the ordinance of the letter let me tell you here we know those we know that Peter Peter the great Apostle Peter who would mention that Alesana many now are the christ the son of living and i just given the keys you should have the keys of the kingdom peter knew you know he had a revelation so is not it not to have a revelation a revelation is not enough because with cheapen I have a revelation and then we live anyhow the talking is coming in calling me halt to all of them Peter had a revelation but what did you Jesus want him Jordan a mystery transmitter he said not me me and when the battle came to it Peter denied the Lord three times he cursed he denied Christ you talk about Christ in the third person I don't know that man when Peter came face-to-face with death these emotions fear gripped him and what he knew he had been warned what in you he pushed aside said no no I'm not to die yet that man I don't know him and yet we have the keys you have the keys to the kingdom so don't tell me I have a revelation it is not enough in me something more than that can you say Amen glory no God in me all right what to care of this in Adam before the fall God talking to Adam soul God spirit from heaven and that's why you and I need the baptism of the Holy Ghost with other part of the Holy Ghost you don't stand a chance you don't stand a fighting chance life of the Panem said you don't stand a chance they might go ready no riddle God amen amen amen amen Oh glory well thank God this ought to make you afraid our faith is based upon his finished work because you know the reason why God he told Israel take a lamb for one house I know the reason why God he took a lamb for his own house way before the foundation of the wall he took a lamb to settle this situation he took a lamb for his house hallelujah Oh glory may be seated Oh hallelujah God took a lamb for his house for the financial of the world God been thought he knew what was gonna be he knew who would who would receive him who would not receive him

beginning and then created angels and angels spirit represented us I represented everybody that was going to be on the face of this out here except this happened CJ and that's the other half of the book of life everybody's there except the serpent seed under Lucifer was perfect until sin was fine his heart so the Lamb of God knows where the scene is at it's in the heart it's in the heart that's where you deal with it and when Lucifer Rosa he came against the world came against Michael which is the spirit the Holy Spirit Gordon is angelic form this fight him against him Michael fought back a listen for fault Michael fought back Michael didn't stop the fight Lucifer stratified because when I worship the fact was of worship when Lucifer could not overcome his place was not found any more in heaven and he was kicked out so don't be surprised apologies who was prettier than that about uh Pharaoh bin stubborn as Lucifer spirit but it was spirit just resist the things of God we see the trailer of the for so long and eventually spur was kicked out of heaven and became a wandering star get on through the earth and after the wine in heaven the book of life was put together the names that was splashing blood before the beginning and all the names are observed by angel spirits were put together the Tanner section and the regular section the book of love was expressed after the war
