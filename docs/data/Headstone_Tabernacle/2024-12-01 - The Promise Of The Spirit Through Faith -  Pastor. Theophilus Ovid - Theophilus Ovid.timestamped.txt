[1:11:02] chapter 3 want to read from verse one of
[1:11:05] Galatians chapter 3 for scripture
[1:11:07] reading this
[1:11:11] morning thank you musicians thank you
[1:11:13] sister in for that
[1:11:14] special thank you for all coming out
[1:11:17] this morning even though it's raining
[1:11:19] but God is good sometime we have rain
[1:11:22] sometime we have sun we need a rain we
[1:11:23] need a sun
[1:11:26] oh foolish Galatians Paul speaks who had
[1:11:29] Bewitched you that he should not obey
[1:11:31] the truth before whose eyes Jesus Christ
[1:11:35] had been heavly set
[1:11:37] forth crucified among you this only
[1:11:41] would I learn of you receiveing the
[1:11:43] Spirit by The Works of the Lord or by
[1:11:46] the hearing of Faith are ye so
[1:11:49] foolish having begun in the spirit are
[1:11:51] you now made perfect by the flesh have
[1:11:55] you suffered so many things in vain if
[1:11:57] it be yet in vain he therefore that
[1:12:00] Minister it to you the spirit and
[1:12:03] worketh miracles among you doeth he it
[1:12:05] by The Works of the law or by the
[1:12:08] hearing of Faith even as Abraham
[1:12:12] believed God and it was accounted to him
[1:12:15] for righteousness know ye therefore that
[1:12:18] they which are of Faith the same are the
[1:12:21] children of Abraham and the scripture
[1:12:24] fore
[1:12:26] that God would justify the Heathen true
[1:12:29] Faith preached before the gospel unto
[1:12:32] Abraham saying inde thee shall All
[1:12:35] Nation be blessed so then they which be
[1:12:38] of Faith are blessed with faithful
[1:12:41] Abraham for as many are of the works of
[1:12:46] the law are under the curse for this
[1:12:49] written curse is everyone that
[1:12:51] continueth not in all things which are
[1:12:53] written in the book of the Lord to do
[1:12:55] them but that no man is justified by the
[1:12:59] law in the sight of God it is evident
[1:13:02] for the J shall live by faith and the
[1:13:06] law is
[1:13:09] not of Faith but the man that doeth them
[1:13:13] shall live in them Christ ha redeemed us
[1:13:18] from the curse of the law being made a
[1:13:20] curse for us for it is written curse is
[1:13:23] everyone that HTH on a tree tree verse
[1:13:26] 14 that The Blessing of Abraham might
[1:13:31] come on the Gentiles through Jesus
[1:13:34] Christ that we might receive the promise
[1:13:38] of the spirit through faith let's bow
[1:13:41] our heads father we thank you for your
[1:13:42] word and we pray a bless it and in our
[1:13:45] hearts in Jesus name we ask it amen you
[1:13:46] may be seated have title this morning
[1:13:49] the promise of the spirit through faith
[1:13:53] of a subject the Jos are live by faith
[1:13:56] and have an inspiration the fate of the
[1:13:59] fathers to bring down the power of the
[1:14:02] Holy Ghost amongst the people the fate
[1:14:04] of the father is to bring the power of
[1:14:06] the Holy Ghost amongst the people so
[1:14:09] this title is from that last scripture
[1:14:12] that the blessings of Abraham might come
[1:14:14] to the Gentiles through Jesus Christ
[1:14:16] that we might receive the promise of the
[1:14:19] spirit through faith so it's important
[1:14:22] you understand Faith being Revelation
[1:14:26] and you have to get a revelation to
[1:14:28] truly access the spirit amen praise the
[1:14:32] Lord andrah was praying in prayer he
[1:14:34] said Lord Jesus master of Life Giver of
[1:14:37] every good gifts by thy Grace at one
[1:14:40] time we were aliens cut off from God
[1:14:43] Gentiles working worship Him dumb Idols
[1:14:45] but in due season Christ died the
[1:14:48] innocent for the guilty and now we are
[1:14:50] Sons and Daughters of God it does not
[1:14:53] yet appear what we shall be but we know
[1:14:55] when we shall have a body like him for
[1:14:57] we shall seem like he is you see how
[1:14:59] Faith speaks Lord how we grown in these
[1:15:02] bodies to be clothed upon with
[1:15:03] immortality to be clothed upon with his
[1:15:06] Spirit we know that in the Old Testament
[1:15:08] the blood of bulls and ghosts could only
[1:15:10] take away sin it only it could not take
[1:15:12] away sin it only covered sin but waiting
[1:15:15] the paradise from one day that sin will
[1:15:17] be taken away but when Jesus came the
[1:15:19] Son of God the Messiah he took away sin
[1:15:22] he divorced it never covered it he took
[1:15:25] it away then now since then in this
[1:15:27] Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved we have
[1:15:30] won waiting in glory we go straight into

[1:31:50] say let the weak say you have to speak
[1:31:54] it out of your mouth God want to hear
[1:31:56] from your mouth he's the high priest of
[1:31:58] your confession Oh Glory to God
[1:32:02] hallelujah
[1:32:05] amen amen so the Oneness of God is the
[1:32:08] word anointed in you so the secret is
[1:32:11] the word and the bride but this same
[1:32:13] word that's inside of you have to be
[1:32:14] anointed Jesus came to the temple and
[1:32:16] read the scripture said the spirit is
[1:32:17] upon me for he had anointed me so the
[1:32:20] word itself must be anointed Living Word
[1:32:23] written word spoken word has to be
[1:32:25] anointed then that becomes the anointed
[1:32:27] word of Messiah that's why we press here
[1:32:29] could come in the spirit oh my come
[1:32:32] earlier to pray up the service oh my
[1:32:35] hallelujah praise God so the Oneness of
[1:32:38] God is the word anointed in you then you
[1:32:40] become a son a messiah of the age and
[1:32:43] the highest Heavens hasten to honor
[1:32:45] Earth's most humble and unlearned the
[1:32:47] highest of Heaven came down to make
[1:32:48] himself known to the lowest on Earth
[1:32:50] they bypass all the common herds men
[1:32:53] they come they come to not the common
[1:32:54] herdsmen come to give these common
[1:32:56] herdsmen the greatest message of all
[1:32:58] time and the greatest message of all
[1:33:00] time was the what what's the message the
[1:33:02] Messiah is here now because the prophecy
[1:33:05] was he's coming he's coming Dynamic is
[1:33:08] coming charity is coming super church
[1:33:10] that's coming too doted son's coming
[1:33:13] power of God coming that's the prophecy
[1:33:15] for 50 plus years but all of a sudden he
[1:33:17] is here that's different oh G he ain't
[1:33:20] coming again he is here Messiah is on
[1:33:22] earth now Oh Glory to God if Messiah is
[1:33:25] an earth he's coming to your house oh go
[1:33:28] give the Lord a praise Hallelujah if
[1:33:31] Messiah is on Earth he is coming to your
[1:33:33] house oh give the Lord some
[1:33:36] Praises hallelujah hallelujah you still
[1:33:39] love
[1:33:40] Jesus amen all right so some bring it to
[1:33:44] church some bring it to a Creed this the
[1:33:47] best Church there the best Creed there
[1:33:49] the best teaching and so on so bring
[1:33:50] people to that and what I recognize now
[1:33:53] is that um people have been brainwashed
[1:33:55] so so now I catch it now in the message
[1:33:57] message people have been their
[1:34:00] brainwashed I was reading something from
[1:34:02] a wife somebody who escaped North Korea
[1:34:05] and they say as a baby as a child they
[1:34:07] teach them to hate America hate this all
[1:34:10] the action they get is to fight with
[1:34:12] toys hitting American soldiers and
[1:34:14] whatnot and whatnot they train
[1:34:17] indoctrinated and when she escaped she
[1:34:19] in London now and another guy in London
[1:34:21] too from North Korea he say it take a
[1:34:23] while
[1:34:24] to get this brainwashing off out of the
[1:34:28] system so I see now how people bind to
[1:34:30] their Church bind to their Pastor not to
[1:34:32] the word they really bind to their
[1:34:34] organization and church they have been
[1:34:37] brainwashed not with the word it have
[1:34:39] the washing of the Water by the word not
[1:34:41] that that's not that we're talking about
[1:34:43] now them them brain have been washed by
[1:34:45] something else it's not the word it's
[1:34:47] something else but the word because when
[1:34:49] you get your mind and your head washed
[1:34:51] with this all they could speak is this
[1:34:54] this is this is what it
[1:34:56] is not even my dream could show you off
[1:34:59] my dreams has get you think I B with
[1:35:00] that Satan no better than that is this
[1:35:03] the word you know my dream is not God
[1:35:05] the word is God you know oh the Lord I
[1:35:07] shout in the
[1:35:11] house don't let no dream Tire up you
[1:35:14] know
[1:35:23] yes sir so sometimes because are we born
[1:35:25] our brains is washed right we are
[1:35:27] brainwashed to say we are defeated we
[1:35:29] are brainwashed to think we can't make
[1:35:31] it we are brainwash and somebody said
[1:35:33] only Sinners only Christians remember
[1:35:35] your sin you
[1:35:37] know there a big one s
[1:35:41] remember he do this he do this pet CHR
[1:35:45] three
[1:35:49] times they don't think he can make it
[1:35:53] you know all time you can't make it you
[1:35:55] can't make it and when you get to the
[1:35:56] top his
[1:35:58] but shoot and shoot you from Over the
[1:36:01] Top all the time you're climbing can't
[1:36:04] make it friends I'm preaching these
[1:36:07] things and saying these things because
[1:36:09] you have to be stronger for what lays
[1:36:12] ahead you have to be sharper for what
[1:36:15] lays ahead and some of you just too
[1:36:17] laast in your head in your mind in your
[1:36:20] spirit you have to press harder than
[1:36:22] that
[1:36:23] don't even say you're
[1:36:31] tired you know was talking preaching I
[1:36:35] was talking about um when husband help
[1:36:37] wash words that doesn't count or you
[1:36:39] laugh I talk from
[1:36:44] experience wife all these years watch
[1:36:47] two way you I mean you looking for a
[1:36:49] book in a
[1:36:50] crown and that's that's regular you know
[1:36:53] that extra you know but I'm says what
[1:36:55] you do extra for
[1:36:56] God what you do normal what you're
[1:36:58] supposed to do that is not the real
[1:37:01] blessing you know is what you do extra
[1:37:03] do you do extra is when you do the extra
[1:37:05] service God can reward that oh give the
[1:37:09] Lord some
[1:37:12] Praises so I'm not talking just head
[1:37:15] knowledge talk from
[1:37:17] experience all right Hallelujah so they
[1:37:20] bring you to a Creed to Christmas you
[1:37:23] you see Santa Claus they bring it to
[1:37:24] church you see an organization but
[1:37:27] Christ these Greeks who say we see Jesus
[1:37:29] brought them to the Cross this is the
[1:37:31] Bossman now there's not no Pastor
[1:37:33] evangelist or or what this is Jesus the
[1:37:36] Messiah Serv we will say Jesus Jus say
[1:37:39] accept a corner we fall in the ground
[1:37:40] and die abide alone he said listen if
[1:37:42] you want to see me look at the
[1:37:46] cross so when you get a real disciple
[1:37:48] that will point you to Christ
[1:37:51] Christ you hear that a real disciple or
[1:37:54] a real Minister will point you to Christ
[1:37:57] Christ will bring you to the Cross where
[1:38:00] you are crucified with him so they not
[1:38:02] cany chicken when they come to Christ
[1:38:04] everything will be all right and no so
[1:38:05] blessed to be
[1:38:07] stressed is that
[1:38:09] special that's a song Somebody finish
[1:38:11] right yet that's not the word you come
[1:38:14] to Christ Christ pointed to the Cross
[1:38:17] where you are crucified with him and his
[1:38:20] eternal life and your life meets
[1:38:22] together your life dies and you take on
[1:38:25] his eternal
[1:38:27] life and then you are Son of
[1:38:32] God your life dies you repeat it again
[1:38:35] and you take on his eternal life and
[1:38:37] then you are Son of God what difference
[1:38:39] from a disciple of old and disciples
[1:38:41] today amen if you mention to a disciple
[1:38:43] I would love to know the Lord Jesus well
[1:38:45] look now we belong to a certain certain
[1:38:47] Church you know come down and join us
[1:38:49] because we don't believe like them
[1:38:50] believe up there you know
[1:38:52] we that that is what they pushing we
[1:38:55] belong to a certain Society come join
[1:38:57] but Christ himself this part I want to
[1:39:00] get to pointed people to his
[1:39:03] dead there's not the pastor there's not
[1:39:07] a prophet or evangelist or teacher
[1:39:08] Christ pointed people to his
[1:39:12] dead except a corner falls in the ground
[1:39:14] buys a loone how different it is how
[1:39:16] different it is but your life and his
[1:39:18] life find each other not at the church
[1:39:21] not in a building not in a Creed not in
[1:39:25] good works but in the cross where you
[1:39:27] are crucified with him where you find
[1:39:29] Christ you don't find him by doing
[1:39:31] better I'm going to do better that's not
[1:39:33] him turn on a new page I'm going to turn
[1:39:36] a new page that's not him start a new
[1:39:38] life you don't find Christ you find
[1:39:40] Christ only in
[1:39:46] debt now I know this is not the normal
[1:39:49] gospel thing that people likes to hear
[1:39:51] but we are not here you see politicians
[1:39:53] tell people what they want to hear not
[1:39:55] what they could do you know if the
[1:39:56] people want to hear this a lower taxes
[1:39:58] they see that a liar read my lips one
[1:40:01] time I man said that and he was lying
[1:40:04] from his
[1:40:05] lips read my
[1:40:07] lips so we are here to hear truth
[1:40:10] because the truth is what sets you
[1:40:14] free
[1:40:16] transparency
[1:40:17] Clarity what sets you free and who the
[1:40:21] son of man set free
[1:40:24] is free
[1:40:28] indeed oh glory to God so you don't find
[1:40:32] Christ in death not in a Manger not in
[1:40:34] confession to believe certain Creed and
[1:40:36] fables you find them in death you said
[1:40:39] then brother Brandon if Christ is on
[1:40:40] Earth today a real servant will take to
[1:40:43] him to him to Christ well Christ is here
[1:40:47] in the form of the word and the word
[1:40:50] brings life and I think that it's I
[1:40:53] don't know if people catching it but
[1:40:55] this word is God you
[1:40:59] know God is his own
[1:41:02] author he wrote this book two prophets
[1:41:07] everything inside of
[1:41:08] here sometimes SCP have compound meaning
[1:41:11] it's for that age it's for this age for
[1:41:13] this age it's for our age too that why
[1:41:15] Jus Clearly say as was days of Noah so
[1:41:18] shall be the days of the Common Man son
[1:41:19] of man why because him Spirit back there
[1:41:22] they leave leave
[1:41:24] those Spirits just jumping on people do
[1:41:26] you get that now so the same spirit that
[1:41:28] was on no it's
[1:41:34] here the same spirit that was on Sodom
[1:41:37] and gomorra is is here the people die
[1:41:40] but the spirit don't die it just jump on
[1:41:42] the Next
[1:41:43] Generation that why they could not get
[1:41:45] rid of sin and wickedness and evil and
[1:41:47] murder because the murderous Spirit they
[1:41:49] hang a man they kill a man they execute
[1:41:50] a man or whatever it is what Spirit upon
[1:41:52] Him jump on on somebody
[1:41:58] else it's a scary time isn't it but it's
[1:42:01] a glorious time too Hallelujah because
[1:42:04] God is dependent upon you and I that we
[1:42:07] wouldn't remain immature but we will
[1:42:10] accept the responsibility and the
[1:42:12] challenges that lays ahead for
[1:42:19] us you have a baby right one year two
[1:42:22] year the baby not a toy tell people that
[1:42:25] you know babies are not toys babies are
[1:42:28] grown men and women in baby
[1:42:32] form what they don't have yet is
[1:42:34] time babies do baby
[1:42:38] things you don't expect babies to do
[1:42:41] adult things children do children things
[1:42:44] they play they run and that's what baby
[1:42:46] do are the children D and something like
[1:42:48] that but these little guys in a couple
[1:42:51] of years they are adop
[1:42:54] and the same thing with the gospel the
[1:42:57] same thing with Christianity when you
[1:42:59] come to Christ like a babe but God
[1:43:02] expect you to be playing with pacifier
[1:43:03] and every minute go see pitching
[1:43:05] pitching pitching and you do hop scotch
[1:43:07] and you know what I mean hop scotch
[1:43:10] and God will expect that that is what
[1:43:14] children do when I was a child I spake
[1:43:17] as a child I acted as a child I
[1:43:20] understood as a child but when I became
[1:43:23] a man I had to say put away say put away
[1:43:28] again one more time say put away there

[1:44:29] so as children we are our basses we have
[1:44:33] the way we think and the we see things
[1:44:35] and so like that we sometime ago we
[1:44:37] preaching and talking about the queen
[1:44:39] and the children of the princess and
[1:44:40] princess and Prince Harry and whatever
[1:44:42] it is they don't know what they are
[1:44:44] they're born they're children they don't
[1:44:45] know somebody have to teach them you are
[1:44:49] royalty your father was a king your
[1:44:51] father was a king father father father
[1:44:52] father look look all the crowns there
[1:44:53] look all the Thrones there this Palace
[1:44:55] is ours this Palace from 1,500 years ago
[1:44:59] King Louis the 8 or 10 or all the names
[1:45:01] and Stu When the Children grew up in
[1:45:04] that just as those North Korean children
[1:45:06] are brainwashed to fight the West these
[1:45:09] royalty people have to be brainwashed
[1:45:11] too to get a understanding of their
[1:45:14] calling and placement so when they grow
[1:45:17] up is Lis and what the princess and
[1:45:19] princess and they grew in and they had
[1:45:21] cameras picked afterwards they accustom
[1:45:23] that did not say get away from me don't
[1:45:25] take no
[1:45:27] pictures
[1:45:28] talking a
[1:45:30] nonou that non Prince talking when they
[1:45:34] understand what goes on with their the
[1:45:36] pictures come normal everywhere they go
[1:45:38] the paparazzi every ton of pictures
[1:45:42] what that's job but they are called it's
[1:45:47] just like us we come into the word
[1:45:49] Catholic Baptist Methodist we come into
[1:45:51] the message then we have to be taught
[1:45:53] our brains have to be washed by the word
[1:45:55] to understand God call Baptist and make
[1:45:57] Baptist more maodus and more Pentecostal
[1:45:59] the word will produce Sons and Daughters
[1:46:00] of God we recognize Baptist produce
[1:46:03] Baptist because a Baptist seed Methodist
[1:46:05] will produce Methodist because a
[1:46:06] Methodist seed but this word seed
[1:46:09] produce Sons and Daughters of God so we
[1:46:11] are not Baptist we are not Pentecostal
[1:46:13] we are not Methodist we are not Jehovah
[1:46:16] Witness we are Sons and Daughters of God
[1:46:19] we are seeds from the book we are words
[1:46:21] of the book we come from the book we are
[1:46:24] children of the book Oh Glory to God we
[1:46:27] were sealed with the book this book
[1:46:29] belongs to us what's in this book is
[1:46:31] what is ours we can claim whatever
[1:46:34] Redemptive rights from this book healing

[1:46:57] the just shall live by faith and Faith
[1:46:59] come by hearing hearing the word of God
[1:47:02] so as the word of God is preached Faith
[1:47:04] could arise in your soul to believe for
[1:47:07] your healing to believe for your
[1:47:08] deliverance to believe for your
[1:47:10] breakthrough any kind of breakthrough
[1:47:12] not just physical breakthrough but
[1:47:14] Financial breakthrough emotional
[1:47:16] breakthrough whatever condition you
[1:47:21] have Hallelujah
[1:47:23] [Applause]
[1:47:25] you may be
[1:47:28] seated when we don't present things to
[1:47:30] God and lay it upon the altar we are
[1:47:34] actually saying God I don't believe you
[1:47:36] have the ability to deal with
[1:47:38] this so that is
[1:47:45] unbelief I'll say it again when we don't
[1:47:48] bring our issues to God lay our problems
[1:47:52] on the altar we are telling God I don't
[1:47:54] believe you have the omnipotent
[1:47:57] omniscient power to deal with what I
[1:48:00] have to deal
[1:48:01] with I am sentenced to this all by
[1:48:04] myself and God want to tell you you a
[1:48:06] big
[1:48:08] liar but you think you're Christian
[1:48:11] because you believe the word and you
[1:48:12] Comm church but you have a big set of
[1:48:16] unbelief subconscious
[1:48:19] unbelief not conscious subconscious
[1:48:21] unbelief that is unbelief and the
[1:48:24] background so he saying I believe here
[1:48:27] but he subconscious do
[1:48:32] so you ever tell a child something child
[1:48:34] want to eat this and child watch
[1:48:38] it give one of my grandson
[1:48:41] something he
[1:48:43] do that toughy and he just look at
[1:48:46] it don't want
[1:48:48] it
[1:48:50] subconscious unbelief
[1:48:53] now so when we have to repent and we
[1:48:55] have to repent every day there are
[1:48:57] things we don't even know that affecting
[1:49:00] us at the subconscious level we want to
[1:49:03] believe we want to hold on in faith but
[1:49:05] there's something hindering us and Bon
[1:49:07] talk about the subconscious is the real
[1:49:09] you that's the real engine that the
[1:49:11] heart the Mind know this is right the
[1:49:13] Mind know I'm supposed to the mind
[1:49:15] that's the mind but we have to get it to
[1:49:17] the heart now and when the heart and the
[1:49:19] mind line up trouble that is where Faith
[1:49:21] that's coming behind that
[1:49:23] and whatever you act you could have
[1:49:25] because everything in your system lines
[1:49:27] up your conscience and your subconscious
[1:49:30] and that is why I think it was I think
[1:49:32] it was last service yes Wednesday night
[1:49:34] I was say say it and say it and say it

[2:10:06] whole church collapse if Grandy if
[2:10:09] trainer split up by an earthquake into a
[2:10:11] 100 pieces and you can't ever go to
[2:10:12] church you're still
[2:10:17] standing hear this part now this the
[2:10:19] part I want to get to now when the
[2:10:21] father in the Old Testament
[2:10:24] understood number one his son was come
[2:10:26] of
[2:10:28] Age Two he has been listen to this word
[2:10:33] seasoned out unto
[2:10:39] adoption seasoned
[2:10:41] out you don't take chicken
[2:10:44] and
[2:10:46] put you have to put seasoning on that
[2:10:52] you know why I see all
[2:10:53] these in India they going to a
[2:10:55] restaurant that food St so good so I ask
[2:10:58] them a call sent for the cook I say how
[2:11:01] how you do this chicken he said boy my
[2:11:03] chicken is marinate
[2:11:07] overnight then nice cook
[2:11:10] that so that no Quicky Quicky thing that
[2:11:12] was tting you know true and true that
[2:11:15] was good
[2:11:17] stuff
[2:11:18] marinate so sometime God marination
[2:11:21] about us is not
[2:11:24] overnight sometime it might take 20
[2:11:27] years 30 years to
[2:11:30] marinate say sometime take 30 years for
[2:11:33] a man to get 6
[2:11:36] months God have your dear maturing
[2:11:41] lightening seasoned onto adoption so
[2:11:45] when he ready to release you to the word
[2:11:46] he really no half crack crank he no man
[2:11:50] to shame him and embarrass him and let
[2:11:53] him down he's releasing a man that has
[2:11:56] been thoroughly tested a Time tested
[2:11:59] Memorial oh give the Lord I
[2:12:02] shout
[2:12:04] hallelujah
[2:12:05] hallelujah so much of ministers pastors
[2:12:08] all around the world dropping down like
[2:12:09] flies some of them have too much of
[2:12:11] money the money just knocked them out
[2:12:13] Cal overtaken by this overtaking by
[2:12:16] popularity overt by woman over all kind
[2:12:18] of like God must have true Sons the have
[2:12:21] be that dark it have many false prophets
[2:12:23] many false Christ it have to have true
[2:12:25] ones true Sons born Sons filled Sons not
[2:12:29] corrupt Sons not filthy Sons righteous
[2:12:31] Sons just Sons oh give the Lord a shout
[2:12:36] so he used these words seasoned out unto
[2:12:40] adoption he said they are born a child
[2:12:43] they are son right then but then there
[2:12:45] will be no more child just a ordinary
[2:12:47] son here we go until they mature
[2:12:51] and show what they are then he calls
[2:12:55] them out
[2:13:00] then so a man called up a 12y old a 14y
[2:13:04] old that son had to become mature we as
[2:13:07] parents have to try to see how we could
[2:13:10] manage that that our children become
[2:13:16] mature I remember telling a sister your
[2:13:18] daughter of age just know she had be out
[2:13:20] of the house that's she she make get M
[2:13:21] what not let her iron let her do this
[2:13:23] cook and
[2:13:25] whatnot that mother she with
[2:13:32] me later on when the daughter get
[2:13:34] married you know what the issue was
[2:13:37] cleaning and
[2:13:40] cooking marriage break under clean and
[2:13:44] cooking because some parents raise the
[2:13:47] children for themselves because they
[2:13:49] want control
[2:13:53] it's a power play to control the
[2:13:58] children so as long as they get each
[2:14:00] other inde
[2:14:01] dependent I'm in
[2:14:03] charge so they don't want to release the
[2:14:06] children that they could become mature
[2:14:08] adults the Bible say for this cause
[2:14:10] shall a man not boy he born a child he
[2:14:14] grew up but he becomes a man for this
[2:14:16] cause Shalla m not a mommy
[2:14:19] boy shall a man leave his mother and
[2:14:23] father not his mother come with them
[2:14:26] too not his mother overshot them with
[2:14:28] her
[2:14:29] mouth not a mother trying to bring
[2:14:31] guidance shall a man leave his mother
[2:14:34] and father and cleave to his wife and
[2:14:36] they Two Become One
[2:14:44] flesh hon we have a
[2:14:48] problem so
[2:14:51] son child ordinary son until they mature
[2:14:55] and sure what they are then God's called
[2:14:57] them out he going to place them Mana
[2:14:59] says you are over here Ephraim go over
[2:15:02] there then he takes him out to a certain
[2:15:04] place the father does he sets him on
[2:15:06] high place like this he has a ceremony
[2:15:08] they all come around and he said here we
[2:15:11] go this is God speaking I want everyone
[2:15:16] to know that this is my
[2:15:19] child and I adopt my son so this is not
[2:15:22] God H sh don't tell nobody yeah no this

[2:15:54] my family although he was a son since he
[2:15:57] was born since he received the Holy
[2:15:59] Ghost he has been my son but now I'm

[2:16:09] hired is hired oh give the Lord some
[2:16:11] Praises I have adopted the son after he
[2:16:15] is
[2:16:19] proven you know let me say a faith that
[2:16:22] cannot be tested cannot be trusted
[2:16:24] because a lot of people haven't been
[2:16:26] tested yet so you don't know if they
[2:16:28] will stand it's not that we don't like
[2:16:30] people and whatnot but if somebody come
[2:16:32] and you know you have to give them time
[2:16:34] to be seasoned out and get
[2:16:38] ripen oh my hallelujah oh glory to God
[2:16:42] so when Jesus come on the scene he was
[2:16:44] the manifestation of the word all right

[2:17:25] life in order to be in a channel to
[2:17:28] manifest what is
[2:17:30] Promised faith in the call of God

[2:17:35] God that call cannot be
[2:17:38] canceled preach back to me
[2:17:43] now that call cannot be cancelled it is
[2:17:46] impossible for that to be cancelled

[2:28:41] fell on that devil on her daughter and
[2:28:44] her daughter was delivered that same
[2:28:47] moment that Jesus is here this morning
[2:28:50] you can be delivered this
[2:28:56] [Applause]
[2:28:59] [Music]
[2:28:59] [Applause]
[2:29:03] [Music]
[2:29:04] morning my
[2:29:07] God how do I do this I had to WRA up
[2:29:12] here I have 16
[2:29:14] pages and now on page
[2:29:17] seven so I'm not even halfway through
[2:29:21] but the point about it is this your
[2:29:23] faith must be anointed to receive your
[2:29:26] healing your faith must be anointed to
[2:29:29] receive your breakthrough and
[2:29:29] deliverance your faith must be anointed
[2:29:33] Moses he knew by information and
[2:29:36] intellectual what his mother told him
[2:29:38] his calling was he knew his calling he
[2:29:41] knew God calling to deliverer but his
[2:29:43] fate was not anointed that is why he
[2:29:45] killed one man and run out when he
[2:29:46] encountered the pillar of fire his fate
[2:29:49] was now anointed Ed same man same fate
[2:29:53] but anointed fate we give the Lord some
[2:29:56] Praises I'm saying to you today faith is
[2:29:59] in you the word is in you it's not out
[2:30:02] of you it's in you but that has to be
[2:30:04] anointed something have to drop on top
[2:30:07] of that a fire have to come upon that an
[2:30:09] anointing have to come upon that then
[2:30:11] your faith is now anointed to fulfill
[2:30:14] the promises that God put in your
[2:30:16] subconscious in your life
[2:30:18] [Music]
[2:30:24] so it takes fi to anoint the promised
[2:30:27] word today for that foot to live do you
[2:30:31] understand that Hallelujah so how God
[2:30:33] will test that feet as men as I love I
[2:30:35] rebuke he will chastise you to see if
[2:30:38] you want to be a bastard you want to be
[2:30:40] an ordinary normal church member
[2:30:42] tradan he hit me he buff me what kind of
[2:30:45] St talk is that you see buff in the
[2:30:48] Bible somebody buff you you feel you're
[2:30:50] in school or
[2:30:51] something God trying to straighten you
[2:30:53] as a son you see we spoil our own
[2:30:55] children God don't he straighten out
[2:30:57] Noah he's straight out Joshua he
[2:30:59] straighten out Moses he straight out all
[2:31:00] his sons every son that come un God get
[2:31:02] straighten
[2:31:05] now so what your parents escape with you
[2:31:08] and don't do to you in discipline God
[2:31:10] will
[2:31:15] do oh God help me Romans 1:16 says for
[2:31:19] another ashamed of the gospel of Christ
[2:31:21] for it is the power of God and the
[2:31:23] Salvation to everyone that believeth to
[2:31:24] the Jew first also to the Greek here we
[2:31:27] go for daring is the righteousness of
[2:31:29] God revealed from Faith to Faith as is
[2:31:32] written to Jos by faith the Amplified
[2:31:35] says for the gospel a righteousness
[2:31:38] which God ascribed is revealed from
[2:31:40] springing from faith and leading to
[2:31:43] Faith the way of faith that arouses the
[2:31:46] more faith so this this righteousness of
[2:31:49] God is from Faith to Faith not from
[2:31:51] Faith to unbelief and from unbelief and
[2:31:53] low belief and no belief from Faith to
[2:31:55] Faith that arouses more faith because
[2:31:59] Faith also come by experience not just
[2:32:01] the word David's experience of the bear
[2:32:03] and the lion in defeating them give him
[2:32:06] the courage to face
[2:32:13] golon the in my house Samuel was there
[2:32:16] building some little all children has
[2:32:18] come to build little cushion to cave and
[2:32:20] whatnot so he's doing some kind of I see
[2:32:22] you'll fail to my shock Samuel tell me
[2:32:25] no I will not I have the courage to try
[2:32:28] again you know Grandpa get
[2:32:31] rebuked grandpa said the wrong thing and
[2:32:34] Grandpa get rebuked the point about is
[2:32:36] this Faith
[2:32:38] stands Faith
[2:32:40] speaks faith is
[2:32:43] bold Faith declares
[2:32:45] itself Hallelujah let me say it again
[2:32:48] Faith speaks
[2:32:50] Faith have hair on its chest faith is
[2:32:57] muscular there is nothing effeminate
[2:33:00] about
[2:33:04] faith the J shall live by Fai brother
[2:33:08] Bram look what Fallen sons of God has
[2:33:11] did he invented automobiles radio
[2:33:12] electric lights atomic bombs jet
[2:33:16] planes turning fast in science but we
[2:33:19] are trying to linger back on some old
[2:33:21] church Creed and stand there when God
[2:33:25] wants us to unfold the word we are
[2:33:27] living in the last days we are living in
[2:33:29] a time that God's beautiful Church ought
[2:33:31] to be standing on his
[2:33:33] feet but we are back somewhere I long
[2:33:35] say Presbyterian the Methodist and
[2:33:37] somebody say well our CH believe it's
[2:33:40] so how is that so that the
[2:33:44] word brother
[2:33:46] Bram what are this Grace we should be
[2:33:49] unfolding
[2:33:50] God's spirit pouring out not just one
[2:33:52] little gusher not one little baptism but
[2:33:55] baptism after baptism not a revelation
[2:33:58] justly by faith or sanctification or
[2:33:59] gifts of the Spirit but revelation after
[2:34:01] Revelation power after power glory after
[2:34:05] Glory we ought to be way up the road
[2:34:07] ready for the
[2:34:09] translation hallelujah hallelujah praise
[2:34:12] God praise God praise God praise God
[2:34:14] give the Lord Praises hang in there you

[2:34:20] going nowhere hallelujah praise God
[2:34:22] praise God praise God and be hungry now
[2:34:25] for this word we almost now we almost
[2:34:27] true you know we half already all right
[2:34:30] but Joe had shared this in the believer
[2:34:32] in chat he said now I believe I say
[2:34:34] online here when the Holy Spirit begins
[2:34:38] to move and to give
[2:34:40] discernment and that is to bring the
[2:34:43] presence of God Among the people just
[2:34:45] like singing a hym shouting a message
[2:34:50] given in unknown tongues or something it
[2:34:53] brings the spirit of God Among the
[2:34:55] people let's reverse that now reverse
[2:34:57] engineer let's reverse
[2:35:00] engineer so you mean shouting as bring
[2:35:02] the spirit speaking in Tong that bring
[2:35:04] the spirit singing a h that bring the
[2:35:05] spirit that's right discernment is bring
[2:35:07] the spirit the spirit have to move
[2:35:10] something have to bring it Oh Glory to
[2:35:13] God so a church that not shouting what
[2:35:15] they bringing they bringing
[2:35:18] themselves amen
[2:35:20] you heard your pastor preach many times
[2:35:22] on the word until the spirit got among
[2:35:25] the people and they just screamed out
[2:35:28] they couldn't hold their peace any
[2:35:30] longer what making you stand up what
[2:35:32] making you scream what making you shout
[2:35:34] is the
[2:35:35] spirit without the spirit you sit down
[2:35:37] there and the devil sit on your top
[2:35:41] lip and the devil give you handcuffs and
[2:35:44] hold your hand down and don't talk about
[2:35:46] your foot your foot in shackles
[2:35:53] the spirit of God takes the word of God
[2:35:55] to the congregation and feeds them and
[2:35:57] they grow spiritually on the word now
[2:36:00] brother brandham now the Lord bless you
[2:36:02] each tonight I pray sincerely not only
[2:36:04] pray but believe that you would receive
[2:36:06] what you pray for now many times people
[2:36:09] has thought if I could just had more
[2:36:10] faith I doubt

[2:36:17] you he said people think I if I could
[2:36:19] just more faith I doubt that you got
[2:36:23] enough Faith you just need a little more
[2:36:26] knowledge to know what to do with your
[2:36:30] feet so the first thing you have to know
[2:36:32] is you have
[2:36:35] feet that's all you got faith enough you
[2:36:38] just don't know how to put it to work so
[2:36:41] there's a way to put Faith to work like
[2:36:44] we say if you put something in hands of
[2:36:45] God don't go and take it out you say
[2:36:47] Lord I give it to you you take it back

[2:37:14] God and Samuel became one of God's Great
[2:37:17] prophets she changed her prayer and God
[2:37:21] could honor her faith in believing him
[2:37:23] and take away her baress Oh Glory to God

[2:39:15] me now you you you'll get it listen to
[2:39:17] this here we go Mary could have waited
[2:39:19] until she had some kind of sign she's
[2:39:21] going to be mother you could wait after
[2:39:23] meeting over after the meeting is over
[2:39:25] until you feel you could move your
[2:39:27] leg to just get a little better
[2:39:29] you could hear a little better out of a
[2:39:31] DEA ear or cancer seems not bothering
[2:39:33] you so much that is not taking God at
[2:39:35] his word anytime you're looking for a
[2:39:37] feeling to feel for heal a feel you
[2:39:40] don't take God at his word taking God at
[2:39:42] his word is God said so Mary said be it
[2:39:45] done unto
[2:39:46] me be it done unto me
[2:39:50] according to Thy word Oh Glory to God
[2:39:53] that is not taking God at his word to
[2:39:56] take God at his word is to hear his word
[2:39:58] accept it and start rejoicing in
[2:40:02] it and some of you your lips
[2:40:06] still you're taking it
[2:40:08] in why you're not
[2:40:12] rejoicing I remind me of the time pepper
[2:40:16] test eating Pepper and a hot pepper and
[2:40:18] said the first person
[2:40:21] say lost and somebody say he want to
[2:40:25] say he look look he want to

[2:40:34] that person Tricky Tricky Tricky guy say
[2:40:36] look he looking like he want to
[2:40:40] say so what's something here now to take
[2:40:43] God at his word is to take his word hear
[2:40:47] it accept it and St re in so when you
[2:40:51] catch it like that Paul in prison start
[2:40:53] to Rejoice start to sing and the power
[2:40:56] came down and he got out of prison when
[2:40:59] you start to see that you start to sing
[2:41:02] and praise God before you come out to
[2:41:04] prison you're not praising God when you
[2:41:07] are free you know you're Praises God to

[2:41:22] don't have to have 500 altar we just
[2:41:25] have to take God at his word and start
[2:41:28] rejoicing something will happen that

[2:46:06] word with a amen that's his watering the
[2:46:08] word you're saying amen Lord that's
[2:46:10] truth Lord isn't that right but
[2:46:16] Bram I remember staying a year and 6
[2:46:18] months in the book Book of
[2:46:20] Revelation I that is teaching I just
[2:46:23] love teaching it's wonderful it gives
[2:46:26] the basis and settles the church and in
[2:46:29] preaching there's some people that are
[2:46:31] preachers they can pick up the word with
[2:46:34] inspiration and sway out in places that
[2:46:37] is watering the seeds that the teacher
[2:46:39] has taught so we need the teachers and
[2:46:42] we need the preachers the teachers bring
[2:46:44] the seed word the preachers bring the
[2:46:46] anointing the inspiration
[2:46:49] the water through the word and some
[2:46:51] people hate preachers they love teachers
[2:46:54] because the teachers place your position
[2:46:55] where you
[2:46:56] are and they nail to the
[2:46:59] Pew Hallelujah but we need the teaching
[2:47:03] and we need the preaching but brandham
[2:47:05] says that is watering the seeds that the
[2:47:08] teacher has taught you got to put some
[2:47:10] seed in first then water it and the
[2:47:13] watering comes from the preaching of the
[2:47:16] word not the teaching the preaching oh
[2:47:20] give the Lord I shout so I don't care
[2:47:22] how much Mighty teachers it have in the
[2:47:24] message the water when comes from the
[2:47:26] preaching of the word bring on the
[2:47:29] preachers oh give the Lord a shout to
[2:47:32] the
[2:47:35] host
[2:47:37] hallelujah hallelujah
[2:47:39] hallelujah brother Bram there's a vast
[2:47:42] difference between a teacher and a
[2:47:43] preacher that is two different gifts of
[2:47:46] the Spirit Al together two different
[2:47:48] gifts
[2:47:49] all right remember Rebecca hardly
[2:47:52] knowing what she was doing she watered
[2:47:54] the same animal the camel to go to her
[2:47:56] husband and the Beast of Burden in the
[2:47:58] Bible represent a power and this Beast
[2:48:00] was being watered Rebecca watering the
[2:48:03] same Beast she wrote on and watch now
[2:48:05] the same Holy Spirit that's going to
[2:48:07] lift it up and take it to his new home
[2:48:10] the church that is praising and blessing
[2:48:12] and watering with Thanksgiving to the
[2:48:15] Holy Spirit that's the church that going
[2:48:17] to get the power to take them home
[2:48:20] Rebecca water the camel we are watering
[2:48:23] our camel tonight oh give the Lord I
[2:48:26] shou in the house glory to God notice
[2:48:30] notice the very camel she watered took
[2:48:33] her to meet her unseen bridegroom and
[2:48:36] that's with the bride also glory to God
[2:48:38] and the very thing that the church is
[2:48:40] watering that is the seed the seed of
[2:48:43] the word is the very word that becomes
[2:48:46] alive and Carries up to our seen
[2:48:49] bridegroom oh my hallelujah hallelujah
[2:48:53] hallelujah Oh Glory this is going sweet
[2:48:57] this eating sweet this eating nice
[2:49:01] Hallelujah notice God promised that he
[2:49:04] would send us a true prophet of the true
[2:49:07] word with a message to return to the
[2:49:09] original word of God and there I get
[2:49:12] inspiration from original word and the
[2:49:14] fate of the fathers to bring down the
[2:49:18] power of the Holy Ghost amongst the
[2:49:20] people that the that's a power will
[2:49:22] raised above these things so this faith
[2:49:25] of the fathers is that to say we have
[2:49:27] faith of the fathers it's the faith to
[2:49:29] bring down to bring down what to bring
[2:49:31] down a man from America no a man from
[2:49:35] Canada how about a man from Europe give
[2:49:37] me one from you Africa no to bring down
[2:49:41] the Holy Ghost Oh Glory to God
[2:49:44] hallelujah hallelujah glory to God glory
[2:49:48] to God
[2:49:49] we see Nations uniting we see the the
[2:49:52] world uniting watch therefore never
[2:49:55] since the early church age did they ever
[2:49:56] see things we are seeing today and this
[2:49:58] was only made possible when God sent
[2:50:01] Seven Seals and give us a Sign by it and
[2:50:04] send seven angels down out of heaven and
[2:50:07] come and bring back that scattered word
[2:50:10] and tied back into the word to bring
[2:50:12] down this holy spirit so all this seven
[2:50:15] SE Revelation was to tie everything
[2:50:17] together to bring down the holy ghost in
[2:50:19] the church I am saying church we are
[2:50:21] ready for the Holy Ghost itself we are
[2:50:23] ready for Dynamics and the mechanics we
[2:50:25] have stood on this word for years I say
[2:50:28] Let the Fire Fall oh give the Lord I
[2:50:30] shout in the house the coming of The
[2:50:33] Headstone the coming of power Hallelujah
[2:50:37] glory to God let's go so does the word
[2:50:40] of God you can't you can't take a church
[2:50:43] and bring it to life on some tradition
[2:50:45] you might bring members but you will
[2:50:47] never bring down the power of God until
[2:50:49] we get back to the original word back to
[2:50:51] the foundational word back to the blood
[2:50:54] in the last days I'm almost done I will
