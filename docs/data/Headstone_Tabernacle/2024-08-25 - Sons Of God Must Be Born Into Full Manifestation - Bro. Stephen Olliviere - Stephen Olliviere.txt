God Amen so God bless you let's turn into our Bibles this morning three portions of scripture thank you musicians appreciate the musicians this morning appreciate the song service amen praise God Romans chapter 8 Ephesians chapter 1 and 1 Corinthians chapter 2 praise the Lord amen so Romans chapter 8: 19 verse 19 for the earnest expectation of the creature waited for the manifestation of the sons of God Amen Ephesians chapter 1 vers verse 4 9 and 11 according as he had chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love verse n having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he had purposed in himself verse 11 in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will amen and going down to 1 Corinthians chapter 2 verses 7 and 8 amen but we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery even the hidden wisdom which God ordained before the world unto our Glory which none of the princes of this world knew for had they known it they would not have crucified Lord of glory amen bless the Lord amen bless your word father this morning to our hearts we ask it in Jesus name amen you may be seated praise the name of the Lord amen so this morning my title is sons of God must be born into full manifestation and my subject is the three-fold mystery or purpose of God amen amen you love the Lord this morning give the Lord a hand of Praise amen glory to God Amen Hallelujah Hallelujah so from the message Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever Jeremiah 1:4 God said before you were even formed in your mother's belly I knew you and called you and Sanctified you and ordained you a prophet over the Nations amen before he was even born can we say Amen you believe in predestination amen for ordination amen we could go right on down through the scriptures yes sir it's all together by Grace it's not by desire it's by Grace amen and God called Abraham out of that whole world of people why because he was better no sir it's Grace God's chosen election and call can we say Amen amen amen you are what you are because the grace of God has made you what you are this morning can we say Amen can we say amen hallelujah glory to God Amen Ephesians 1 according as he had chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world who did it I heard it and I came no no you never did it he hath chosen you past tense had chosen and us the church in him praise God when before the world was even formed amen he had already chosen you can we say Amen this morning praise God hallelujah hallelujah praise God Amen praise God Amen so he had already chosen you before amen can somebody shout hallelujah glory amen come on now job where was thou when I lay the foundations of the world declare to me if thou has understanding where was thou when the morning Stars sang together and the sons of God shouted for Joy Hallelujah Glory C up your loins like a man and answer thou me job amen Give the Lord a shout Give the Lord a shout amen hallelujah amen this shout started way before there was a moon way before there was a star the sons of God were shouting praise God Amen shouting throughout eternity hallelujah amen glory to God are you going to stop shouting now no no no amen can't stop now amen glory Give the Lord a hand of Praise amen amen amen glory amen so Paul says he chose us in himen that we should be holy and blameless amen and Braham says not our Holiness not mine but his amen my Holiness is nothing his Holiness is perfect praise God our Holiness is like filthy rags amen hallelujah Glory St John 15: 16 Jesus himself drives it home you have not chosen me but I have chosen you and ordained you this morning amen what for there must be a purpose in all this choosen come on now somebody say amen amen you mean that even before a molecule even before an atom was created God had already chosen you come on now Hallelujah brother there must be there has to be an eternal purpose in all of this choosing this morning give him praise give him praise amen Oh Glory yes Lord yes Lord yes Lord hallelujah amen and Romans 9:1 for the children talking about Esau and Jacob being not yet born Hallelujah neither having done any good or evil that the purpose of God somebody say purpose of God that the purpose of God according to election might stand not of works but of him that calleth not who was Holier but Jacob I loved Esau I hated past tense and the twins are not even born as yet can we say Amen my so God will have mercy on whomsoever he chooses to show mercy God will have compassion on whomsoever he chooses thank god he's a god rich in Mercy today are you glad he's a god rich in Mercy oh give him praise give him praise yes Lord Glory yes Lord Jesus thank you Lord but the purpose of God Must Stand amen what is this purpose of God from the message SP Manan Church age but says you can't read it any other way the hard purpose the Eternal purpose of God was to take a bride of his own choosing Hallelujah and that purpose was in himself and being Eternal was decreed before the foundation of the world say Amen so the heart purpose of God was to take a bride of his own chosen hallelujah amen amen amen amen glory so from that same message he said the thoughts of God are Eternal they are real he says down through the centuries we find Moses and Jeremiah and John the Baptist notice each one of these was God's Eternal thought expressed in its season amen then we came to Jesus the logos he was the perfect and complete thought expressed and he became known as the word of God can we say amen hallelujah hallelujah he says he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world Amen and we were right there with him in his mind thoughts of God before the foundation of the world Amen brother brah said this gives an eternal quality to the elect Oh Glory you are the elect this morning this gives an eternal quality to the elect my my amen amen so we are not from this world we are pilgrims and strangers passing through this world we come from God and we are going back to God this world this Cosmos world this world system is not our home we don't belong here give the Lord a shout this morning we don't belong to this world Amen hallelujah hallelujah another way to say it from the Ephesians Church age the word most definitely sets forth that before the foundation of the Earth the purpose of God was to share his eternal life with man Hallelujah so man was not supposed to die man was supposed to live forever amen hallelujah praise God I want to impress upon you that we are called unto eternal life the Abundant Life don't settle for this carnal life of Le oia the bride is called out into the Eternal age a bride Age come up here this morning into the Eternal age Hallelujah come up here this morning amen out of Le oia praise God amen glory from the message looking unto Jesus the church has got to get in that condition am to receive the headstone then take the whole thing in the resurrection when the body is raised up me say that one more time the church has got to get in that condition to receive the headstone then take the whole thing in the resurrection when the body is raised up so we are going back to Eternity Oh Glory to God can we say Amen this morning amen glory amen thank you Lord hallelujah Glory so we are just trapped in these time bodies but one of these days somebody say one of these days hallelujah this Mortal will take on immortality and we'll have a body like his own glorious body these bodies will be transformed into the perfect image of the Son of God can we say Amen Give the Lord a hand of Praise glory amen we won't need Divine Healing then for the immortal body but we need Divine Healing now amen now are we the sons of God Amen you shall be healed you shall be delivered how many need a Deliverance this morning you shall be delivered you shall be set free praise God and who the son of man sets free is free indeed free indeed praise God Amen you shall be filled praise God amen glory your praise him when you are free and you praise him to be free also there's power in Praise somebody praise him this morning somebody praise him this morning hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory glory to God Amen as a son we have his authority but as a manifested son we have access to his power glory to God Amen glory amen when the policeman says stop he cannot make you stop but you stop because you respect the authority of the law that he represents can we say amen amen that's the Son of God you say Satan give me back my son Satan give me back my family give me back my peace get out of my home and he respects the authority of the word and the whole of Heaven is backing you up as he has to go say Amen this morning Hallelujah Glory yes Lord amen but with a manifested son is different way different Hallelujah glory to God when Legion saw Jesus a far off Legion ran and worship him oh my God glory to God talk about power Satan knows who is the boss Hallelujah he cried with a loud voice what have I to do with thee Jesus thou son of the most high God the demons worship God hallelujah he worshiped Jesus amen hallelujah he said I adore thee by God that thou torment me not Hallelujah this is the legion talking praise God amen hallelujah amen Jesus demonstrated what manifested Sons do amen he said come out of the man thou unclean spirit amen he said Jesus I know Paul I know those Devils will know the manifested sons from a far off hallelujah amen yes Lord yes Lord Amen brother bham said after a while the bride will not even have to say in Jesus name because the person would be in her Oh Glory to God Amen sons of God must be born into full manifestation Give the Lord a praise Give the Lord a praise this morning Hallelujah yes Lord amen amen amen glory thank you Jesus from future home see you were made for an eternal purpose because you were the manifestation of an attribute that wasn't God Amen that thought of you so you were you were in God that thought of you and expressed you and he made an earth to take you out of and to make you a human being amen he says sin came along and perverted his way but you came anyhow but you were lost with the world my so in Genesis in the beginning now God created the Earth and all its beautiful creations and he put man in the garden as Master of the earth Hallelujah god of the earth thank you Lord he was a spirit man he was something on the order of God or the Son of God the logos that was the first man he gave the man jurisdiction over the Earth amen the Earth was man's domain he could speak and it was so he could say Let There be and it was so he had spoken word power amen glory amen and great big papa God said this is my son he is ruler over all my Heritage the Earth is your inheritance go forth and be productive I give you power and authority over every cattle every bird Every Creature over all the Earth multiply and replenish the Earth Hallelujah he was a powerful creation made in the image and likeness of God somebody say hallelujah Hallelujah glory and God was pleased God was pleased with man Adam and Eve amen now now he was Jehovah God existed with his family his children in Perfect Harmony and fellowship amen yes Fellowship God always wanted to have fellowship with his people amen and if you back SL today get back into fellowship with God because God loves you and he wants to be in fellowship with you can we say amen amen if you're backslid get back into fellowship with God Amen and sin steps in and cuts the fellowship it strips man of his inheritance man lost spoken word power and authority and death comes in for the wages of sin his death and God is constrained by his own word the word itself is God my so with death comes sickness and sorrow and pain but man was not supposed to die man was supposed to live forever on this earth oh yes Lord and instead of running to God man was now running away from God and hiding behind religion What a Sad picture God hates religion my amen oh my God hallelujah Glory Hallelujah but God is always ahead of the devil amen nothing takes God by surprise Hallelujah in fact God said good let's continue to unfold my great mystery amen he was building a puzzle as it were amen nothing will stop the purpose and plan of God somebody shout Glory nothing will stop it amen [Applause] hallelujah amen yes Lord and for us here

let there be and then the word became flesh and dwelt Among Us in the person of Jesus Christ amen so God revealed himself through the person of Jesus Christ can we say amen glory so First Corinthians 2 Hallelujah but we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery Glory where bam said the threefold mystery of God which God ordained before the world unto our Glory so this wisdom of God this hidden wisdom is also referred to as the three-fold mystery of God or the three-fold purpose of God Amen Hallelujah can we say amen amen from Christ is the mystery of God revealed brother R says note God had a three-fold purpose in this great mystery secret before the world began amen before and the first PLL of it number one was that God wanted to reveal himself to the people remember he was Elohim mysterious and far off amen Jehovah God who covered all Space and Time and Eternity was too great too mysterious to reveal himself to the people in that form so he became a son a man son of man and he revealed himself in Christ Jesus Jesus can we say amen amen let me go to the second four the second fold or the second purpose was to have the preeminence in his body of Believers that is in his bride in you this morning that he might live in the people in other words Christ manifested in his church Christ Living in the bride the third fold is to restore the kingdom to its right position that fell by sin by the first Adam to restore it back to where he walked in the cool of the evening with his people and talk with them and fellowship with them in other words to redeem lost Eve back to the original condition in the garden can we say Amen can we say Amen again he says when we see all these great three-fold Revelations S one God in Christ two Christ in the church and three the kingdom coming back Adam and Eve redeemed back to the Garden of Eden in the representation of Christ and his bride then the kingdom is going to be restored according to his promise can we say Amen can we say amen glory so Christ the second Adam redeems his Fallen wife and goes back with her back to Eden that's Christ in the church today taking his wife back see the three-fold mystery now amen can we say Amen can we say amen glory amen again one God manifested in Christ two Christ manifested in the church and three all together to bring back the original Adam and Eve man and woman which are one made

glory amen so I want to spend some time in the second fold of this great unfolding mystery of God this is where God wants to get into his people and live in their hearts and to have the preeminence amen so from future home Hallelujah brother says hallelujah your soul is a part of God an attribute of God displayed here on Earth in a body the soul must be redeemed because it was in sin so God came down by a process of justification sanctification and baptism of the Holy Ghost and redeemed your soul can we say amen amen note we must be changed by his holy fire to condition and make a place for him to be contained within us that is for the Holy Ghost to dwell inside of us amen amen amen we must be changed by his holy fire amen Holy Fire amen glory question and answers talking about the process of conversion of the heart Christ Living in his bride one first justification by faith you accept your salvation two then sanctification Hallelujah your habits all the filth of the world is gone from you smoking drinking gambling all the unclean habits Leave You by sanctification hallelujah amen this is a prophet here then the Holy Spirit comes in and anoints you and puts you in service to do do something for him amen amen clean and set aside for service amen but the next thing yes is you're born again when you receive the Holy Ghost that's when you are converted only then only then amen praise God so note you might be in the process of conversion but you are not converted until it's completed and you are sealed into the kingdom of God somebody say Amen somebody say amen amen so you might be on the process of conversion amen for example yes he says when you are loading a box car yes and you throw all the things in and you are set and ready to go but then the inspector comes to check if everything is all set right and if he sees anything that is not packed just right he says no not yet not yet am amen so the Packers have to get the whole thing loaded up right packed in just right then the doors are slammed by the inspector and they are sealed in there you are then she's ready to go she's filled and goes amen Give the Lord a hand of Praise amen amen amen again note from what is the Holy Ghost if the Christian has not been filled with the Holy Ghost he is only in the process of being a Christian amen amen he's working on it but God has not given him the Holy Spirit he's not yet reached that goal with God that God has recognized it hallelujah amen amen so it is a process praise God amen amen amen a God has to test you God has to test your faith to see if

mystery amen thank you Lord glory amen from power of transformation very important now Glory that little inside of the inside that's where you start which is your soul then comes from that you have a spirit than Jesus and then you became a living being Body Soul and Spirit the outside body has five senses see smell taste and so on the inside body which is a spirit has five senses reasoning affection conscience and so on but the inside of the inside in the soul is the controlled Tower where either God or Satan is all right can we say amen amen question is the Holy Ghost sitting in your controlled Tower leading and guiding you amen Romans 8:14 as many as are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God can we say Amen is the holy spirit sitting in your country control tower leading and guiding you as a man thinketh in his heart so he is amen or so is he amen amen amen there's always a battle for control and Leadership within a man that's right God wants to Lead You by the word by the Holy Spirit and the soul the guide and the controlled Tower Hallelujah but you want to lead Yourself by what you see with your eyes or what your emotions and your human spirit feel by your affection and your conscience and your reasoning so there is a walk constantly going in going on within us amen that's where Satan deceived Eve the fruit was pleasing to the eyes but it was death to the soul see amen can we say Amen can we say Amen question is your all on the alter of sacrifice does your heart the spirit control amen I'm many want to say yes Lord come on now soul searching

expressed take a man I know I'm not supposed to commit adultery all right then the spirit tells him you shouldn't commit adultery the spirit portion of his being speaking from the second court but way down in there is still that desire that thing in there it still is there see it will kind of govern around and you better watch in other words if you are being controlled by at your human spirit level watch out you might end up falling even even though you know it's wrong all hallelujah amen glory still at the spirit level not anchored in your soul as yet amen hallelujah Glory but brother says but when it is directed from the inside that's your soul it throws all the rest of it together he said that's the guide post the control tower on the inside of the inside amen glory you know the song says

can't do it even if you tried oh praise God that's how we want to amen glory to God hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory amen amen amen amen but the very desire is not there Holy Fire of God Is Burning on the inside inside is that what you want this morning is that what you want this morning amen what is it the soul controlling the spirit and the spirit controlling the body can we say Amen

morning oh Jesus thir of my soul oh yes Jesus Hallelujah Bread of Heaven me till I want no more yes [Music] my it up and me praise the Lord what a masterpiece this morning what a blessing rece and God bless you certainly appreciate oh being used and yal himself to the the spirit the spirit could speak to us sons of God to be born into full manifestation and you know there was something that was kind of riding me up on my heart and normally we talk about there's two Spirits God's Spirit and Holy Spirit but I wrote something down about what is in between and in between is the human spirit and that's why God talk about those false prophets that speak from their own spirit from their own inner spirit and and that there lies the problem because because as humans God give us choices and choic is a beautiful thing in the Garden of Eden God to eat everything but that tree in the mid don't touch it and man choose to touch that tree and and man fell God will not take away your choice God will not force you to be a Christian forc you to serve him force you to submit yourself you have to choose to submit you have to choose to humble yourself if you don't like but Steven was so much of so much golden nuggets this morning and I recognize now why God kept it in a mystery because a mystery has to be revealed and unfolded and for him to reveal it it has to be his Spirit given Revelation the devil can't get that so the devil could never get the mystery of God that is reserve and reveal for his sons now this Earth wasn't created for the devil this Earth was created for us because we were what made him Jehovah because he had no attributes he had no children so he wanted to have a contact so he formed man to have children that he could express his love to express his word to that's why we end up in parenting that we could actually reflect what God reflected in the beginning having Sons and Daughters now because man fell God still purpose to redeem man according to what brother Stephen say that was his intent and purpose so he purposed through Christ to come back and bring back the book bring back the deed bring back the authority bring back the blood bring back all of that because we couldn't help ourselves we couldn't pull ourselves out we couldn't deliver ourselves we couldn't redeem ourselves so he had to do everything and he do did that and say you have to choose and accept that it is always your chth choice is because thou has chosen it is still your choice this day to serve him to love him it's still your choice to love your wife it's still your choice to respect your husband it's still your choice what is parenting about parenting is to bring a child to maturity and for this cause shall a man leave his mother and father not bring his mother and father with him not bring his mother with him leave his mother and father and C unto his wife no mother is supposed to be interfer with no son business in his marriage that is foolishness God never ordained that God never set that up shall this cause a man leave his mother when he leave his mother he's supposed to be a big man he's supposed to be adult man he's supposed to be a mature man to stand on his own that's how God loves it not us as helicopter parents hovering over our children hovering hovering your [Music] helicopter God want our hands off his business God want to set up his son and say That's my boy look at him oh my he's a chip of the old block this is what God wants amen but what I want to get you is this that human spirit is what have to get subjection to the word you have to want the word to be over you that your life is governed by the word itself I'm closing with this this is uh Deuteronomy chapter 28 ver1 we know it it shall come to pass if Thou shalt hekken diligently unto the voice of the Lord thy God to observe to do all his Commandments which I command you this day that the Lord thy God will set thee on high above all the nations of the earth and all these blessings shall come on thee and overtake thee if Thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the Lord thy God so listen church God was saying in your respects in your obedience in your walking in the way of the Lord here's what going to happen with you he says all these blessings shall come on thee and overtake thee if Thou shalt hekken unto the voice of the Lord thy God blessed shalt thou be in the city blessed shalt thou be in the field blessed shall the fruit of thy body the fruit of thy ground the fruit of thy cattle the increase of thy kind the flocks of thy sheep blessed shall be thy basket and thy store blessed shalt thou be when thou comest in blessed shalt thou be when th goest out the Lord shall call thine enemies that rise up against thee to be spitten before thy face they shall come out against thee one way and flee before these seven ways the Lord shall command the blessing upon thee in thy storehouses in all that thou sest thine hand unto he shall bless thee in the land which the Lord thy God giveth Thee the Lord shall establish thee a holy people unto himself as he has sworn unto thee if Thou shalt keep the Commandments of the Lord thy God to walk in his ways all the people of the Earth shall see that thou art called by the name of the Lord they shall be afraid of thee and the Lord shall make thee plenteous in Goods in the fruit of thy body in the fruit of thy

Friday will be our Zoom prayer meeting time around fellowshipping and being able to have that communion with the Lord this coming Sunday would have normally been two services but we want to have one service this coming Sunday and this Sunday we want it to be taken very seriously it's an important day I believe that it's going to be September the 1st it's the beginning of a week the beginning of a month Mon it's also the beginning of a new school year which marks quite a number of different things as you know our convention comes after the school year is over in July so we want to have a special service this coming Sunday just one service and we really want to encourage the entire church to be present and especially those that will be going out to school in this new school year whether it's Primary School Secondary School University whatever it might be both uh the students the teachers you want to have a special time of prayer for those that are going out to school in this new school year you don't have to be you don't have to to to to be an intellectual or somebody who is to to see how bad things are becoming and how the world is changing so we want to fortify our people with prayer we don't want them to go out there and walk as if it was a year ago or two years ago or 3 years ago or the lid of hell is on covered the level of things you're seeing now has never been seen before and we want to be able to cover our homes and our families with the blood brother B said apply the token over your home apply the token over your family so we want to apply the token on all of the students who are going out of school and certainly we know with the school term opening the traffic and everything changes there just a lot of things and I wanted to see it not just as a natural thing because we wrestle not against flesh and blood but principalities and powers and spiritual wickedness in places so I want to encourage you make every effort to be here in the house of the Lord next Sunday and make sure and bring all of the school children I said Primary School Secondary School University whatever it might be so we could spend time praying for them as we go into the new school year so once again this coming Wednesday service here at the Tabernacle at 8:00 p.m. we have our Friday prayer meeting via zoom and this Sunday just one service this coming Sunday and it's
