your mercy to us that lord not only would you leave eternity but you would come down to walk the earth as a man father lord to be our kinsmen redeemer to take the sin of this world to take the sin of our pastor sins of our future the issues in our lives and take it upon your shoulder and walk up to calvary's tree father and when we should have been there you stood in our place and when we should have died there you died in our place lord and against the expectations of the devil father lord when father you said it is finished lord lord it was finished father and that finishing of the great mystery of god had unfolded to now made it possible because of your resurrection that we could have life and have it more abundantly so we thank you for the grace that you have extended to us through these meetings through these services through these days and weeks and months leading up to this moment father we pray a special blessing on your people gathered from the east from the west from the north from the south father may you take me out of the way and speak to your needy children may you bless our host pastor lord brother paulo and jacob his wife his family and the church lord in every question may you bless every church every believer every one who's connected in their churches in their homes wherever they may be we give glory and honor to your holy name and as we approach the reading of your holy scriptures lord may you walk out the pages of the bible and speak to your sons and your daughters father take me out of the way and speak lip to hear to your children father not my thoughts but your thoughts not my words but your words may you break chains and shackles lord and may the enemy be routed may we put the devil under our feet this morning in the mighty name of jesus christ we already have the victory lord because you live we can live also and you said that we are more than conquerors father we thank you for your word of promise lord of our manifestation of the sons of god we commit the service into your hands with the precious name of jesus christ and the church says amen and amen while you're standing let's just read the scriptures and i'll do the greetings after reading two portions of scripture scene john 15 and reading colossians 1. saint john 15. verse 1 and reading colossians 1 verse 27. see in john 15 1 i am the true vine and my father is the husbandman the fact that jesus would use the reference of true vine speaks to the fact that they are false vines so i am singular the true vine and my father is singular the husbandman every branch in me that bear it not fruit he take it away so they are branches that do not be a fruit and they are consequences of not bearing fruit and every branch that beared fruit he pigeot it that it may bring forth more fruit now you are clean through the word which i have spoken unto you abide in me and i in you as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself except it abide in the vine no more can ye accept he abide in me i am the vine ye are the branches he that abideth in me and i in him the same bringing forth much fruit for without me you can do nothing if a man abide not in me he is cast forth as a branch and is withered and men gather them and cast them into the fire and they are burned if you abide in me and my words abide in you you shall ask what you will and it shall be done unto you that there's your promise hearing is my father glorify that you bear much fruit so shall he be my disciples and one verse in colossians 1 27 a familiar uh scripture to whom god would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the gentiles which is christ in you the hope of glory may the lord have a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated in the presence of the lord and i like to take this time to greet our precious pastor paul owner jacob his wife and family and the golden age tabernacle ivory coast for the faith in 2022 easter to host this convention yet again in this virtual setting and as we see the world moving back into normalcy uh you know it's it's a it's a telling time and a turning of the corner as it were i want to certainly greet all the ministers that would have ministered or ministers or will minister in this meeting all the ministers that would bring greetings all of the specials the song leaders the musicians the technical teams the production teams in the various churches and all the ministers and churches that would connect live as well as uh be able to catch the convention at some point all of the helps and governments in churches near and far that have supported this convention for the honor and glory of the lord we are so happy to be able to fellowship among believers of like precious faith in such a time as this and we are so blessed and so honored to be part of this meeting certainly want to greet you on behalf of my pastor but ovid and sister anne-marie and the ministry here in trinidad and my wife sister karen and my daughter for the opportunity to minister in this meeting it is not something that we take for granted and there are so many gifts that are in the body and i consider myself always a spare tire so we'll see what the lord will do by his grace today you love the lord amen so what a time we're living in and with a paul and i'm sure through the various services you know you would hear over and over what the theme of the meetings are is the life of christ in you is the vindication of the rapture with an inspiration the revelation by the life of christ what a powerful inspiration the life of christ in you is the vindication of the rapture the life of christ in you is the vindication of the rapture the word vindication means it's proof that someone or something is right so the life of christ in you is proof of the rapture the life of christ in you is proof that he is raised from the dead because he's raised from the dead there could be a life that's operating through you can the church say man the life of christ in you is proof of the resurrection the life of christ in you is proof that there's a seed in your soul the life of christ in you is proof that you are predestinated you don't need anybody else to be the proof the life of christ the very life of christ itself is the proof that you are in the bride the life of christ in you is the assurance that you have passed from death unto eternal life the life of christ in you is the token the life of christ in you is the absolute the life of christ in you is the vindication of the rapture the life of christ in you is the hope of glory it is this great mystery that has been hid but now has been opened to us as gentiles that is this great mystery that the devil wished he understood but it bypassed him how almighty god who existed alone could tabernacle himself into badger skins how almighty god who existed alone who when there was war in heaven and the devil was kicked out that god found a way found a way to place himself into sons and daughters that here in 2022 in this easter convention the devil is trembling i'm not talking to your flesh i'm not talking to how you feel i'm talking to who you are because there's a life in you there's a seed in you there's a promise in you there's a purpose in you there's a calling in you there's a anointing upon you that the devil could be mad but he cannot stop it satan could be angry but he cannot stop it because he could not he cannot stop his life oh he couldn't stop it when jesus was here he couldn't stop it when it was in peter he couldn't stop it when it wasn't paul he couldn't stop it when it wasn't brother pranam how dare the devil thinks he could stop it now it's the same holy ghost it's the same power it's the same presence it's the same angel it's the same god oh unfolding this tree full mystery oh blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah hallelujah the life of christ oh that's what this all is about friends it's not about churches it's not about conventions it's not about being in the message it's not about the message it's about god's great purpose to tabernacle himself behind individuals unlikely individuals of individuals who don't stand a chance of individuals who messed up individuals who made mistakes up individuals who backslid individuals who were hanging in there individuals who have doubt individuals who didn't know where they stood in the video was born into all kind of situations of individuals who gave up on themselves in those very individuals there's a seed in there that is a little form of jesus and when the spirit connects to that word seed it's finished hallelujah hallelujah your natural father was just a trustee your natural mother was just a trustee oh you are not the son or daughter of child or ella branham you are not the son and daughter of whoever your father your mother is you are son of the king you are a daughter of the king they are angels dispatched around you today they are angels around you they are behind you they are the side of you they are the front of you wherever you walk because they have got to guard the presence they have got to guard the life if the devil only knew what happened when he touched a life he would have left jesus to live up but because he messed with the life there's a great consequence of messing with the life he messed with jesus and the life must multiply don't mess with me it's going to multiply don't mess with my house it's going to multiply it's going to grab my children it's going to grab my son it's going to grab my daughter no weapon no demon no principality your past your mystics could separate us from this life blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah so i have a title for a few minutes i'm not going to be too long with you but my title is the manifestation of the life of christ in you because when the life of christ is in you there's got to be a manifestation something has got to take place the life of christ cannot be in you and you're dead the life of christ cannot be in you and you're defeated the life of christ cannot be in you when you're giving up maybe you're struggling right now but there's a fullness of the life that when he steps in when he steps in it's impossible for you to fail it's impossible for you to backslide it's impossible for you to go back to the world my subject i am the vine you are the branches and as an inspiration there is my spirit flowing freely we know these statements but it's at a still in my heart there is my spirit flowing freely so the spirit could flow and it doesn't have to be flowing freely freely means uninhibited it means no restrictions it means nothing blocking the flow so when you come into the presence you feel is spirit but when you go back home things happen and and the flow gets interrupted we are here in this season to reach a position where there is no hindrance nothing stopping no limitation open up the channel oh come on now somebody help me this morning help me this evening oh hallelujah oh everybody feeling fine ride with me this evening ride with me this morning whatever time zone you're in i'm not going to be along with you but let's give the devil a knockout punch but abraham said there's more power in your little finger than what the devil has so come on now you sons and daughters of the living god and that prophecy that's over you is going to come into manifestation that sickness that you're dealing with cannot stay sick when the life of christ comes fully in you it's impossible for light and darkness to live in the same house it's impossible for fate and doubt to live in the same house by the time this convention is over you're gonna walk into your home and see a different home because the life of christ in you does things around you come on now somebody help me a little bit [Applause] [Music] the manifestation of the life of christ in you that's what the whole creation is running for that's what the message is all about i'm tired of church yes i said it i'm tired of church god didn't come for us to have church he came to connect with us in a different kind of way connect with us in a way that he couldn't do before but now we in this age when the fullness of the word is restored the word is the conduct of the spirit so now for the first time there's a pipe there's a way for the spirit to move because the word has been restored the word that was scattered throughout all the ages oh he could only move a certain kind away with the measure of the word that they had but now in our day we have the fullness of the word that's what the prophet came for not for us to focus on the prophet it was to focus on connecting the branch to the vine it was focused on that connection jesus told him i am the vine and ye are the branches but for a long time there couldn't be a perfect connection but after william branham came and the word was restored there was no perfect connection that the spirit could move freely oh hallelujah you may be seated i would like to take a few minutes to just remind us that we are not of this world it is easy with the distractions that exist and the pace of life to try to get comfortable that by design the devil's job is to make things easy for you to stay here convenience easy fast that those are the key words that drives the devil's motivation make you comfortable instant coffee fast this whatever it is to get you caught up in a world that is getting faster and faster you have to do more to keep up you have to work harder you have to study more you need to do two jobs you need to do a side hustle you need to study more all of these things to keep you focused on these natural things but let me remind us that we don't belong here let us remind ourselves that we are not from this world [Music] [Applause] oh hallelujah i would like to remind us despite the technological advancements despite the architectural conquest despite 3g 4g 5g or whatever g comes despite their nfts and cryptocurrencies this world is still guaranteed for judgment it's all going to be judged judgment is hanging over the world judgment is hanging over you judgment is hanging over churches i want to remind us that judgment is already set i want to remind us that only the bride the elect lady will be in the rapture it has nothing to do with the church that you belong to it doesn't even have to do with your belief it doesn't even have to do about your doctrine it's very simple if you are pride you go into the rapture can the church say amen in every church has three kinds of believers and this church has three kinds of believers in every country has three kinds of believers i don't care who your pastor is it's still three kinds of believers but there will be a bride who will have the life of christ it will not be their life it will not be their interpretation it will not be their understanding but it will be jesus christ himself tabernacled in 16 elements and that jesus will lead them to love that jesus will lead them to forgive that jesus will lead them to love their enemies in that house because you are tabernacles of the spirit in that house don't tell me you have the life of christ and you can't live with one another that's not the life of christ because the holy spirit cannot misbehave in one person oh come on now somebody preached back to me the life of christ creates a super church creates a super race up as we near the headstone it's the life of christ i'm not talking about the life of the pastor i'm not talking about the life of the prophet it's christ we're talking about that same jesus somebody help me [Applause] saul thought he knew him saul who became paul under gamaliel he read about him he studied him he was fighting for his understanding of him he stood there and stoned stephen because he thought he had an understanding of who god was but when this man called saul was on his road to do more of what he thought was right he met jesus oh hallelujah somebody say man and when he met jesus he went through a transformation his eyes started to see different his ears start to hear different his foot start to move different his mouth start to speak different it was no longer an understanding of who jesus was he met the life and it is impossible for you to meet the life and remain the same it is impossible for the life to be in your heart and you can't drop your odds impossible impossible because when jesus stood there on the cross that life said father forgive them they don't know what they're doing they hurt me but they don't know what they're doing forgive them forgive them in his darkest moment he was still talking forgiveness and you can't forgive lord send a life into this place to that such a spirit of forgiveness could drop down into the house [Music] the bride only has one identification and it's not belief it's not church it's not country it's not association it's not group it's not affiliation it's not tenure it's not seat in church it's not how long in a message there's only one identification it's the life [Music] the life the life a living fate a living virtue a living knowledge a living temperance anybody wants it a living patience a living godliness a living brotherly kindness a living charity anybody wants it it's the seven spirits of that one perfect holy spirit seven manifestations of one holy spirit that's god he divided himself throughout all the ages but now in this age he has gathered himself up through a message he said rapture and fate it's laying in this message my life is laying in this message my power is laying in this message the restoration of your children is in this message your healing is in this message of your adoption is in this message your perfection is in this message missing limbs being restored yes it's in this message that's what the life of christ does it'll make you stop your lying oh it'll send the devil flying oh hallelujah it's all over me it's keeping me alive it's keeping you alive in your darkest moment that sea germ that god put there is why you are in the house of god today that life is calling you it's calling your name it's the mystery of who you are that's why it's a mystery hallelujah sin has got to let you go the grip of the devil has got to let you go hallelujah those demons are trying to pull you down they are no match for the life of christ hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah give him a shout out praise shake yourself shake yourself hallelujah he said a new heart i'll give you a new spirit i'll give you and i'm gonna send my spirit that's god himself up wants to take control control of your thoughts control of your words control of your actions control of your issues he could solve the problem just let him drive let him take control let him take over come on now i don't care if you're in your house get in the spirit i don't care if you're in church get in the spirit you create an atmosphere do you create an atmosphere you create an atmosphere so that god could drop down and minister to your needs oh hallelujah he's the same yesterday today and forever it was that same life that fell on the day of pentecost and when peter encountered the life he said these men are not drunk as you suppose this is a different kind of thing [Applause] without this life you're not living you know oh hallelujah people talk about only one life that is not this this life is what i want because it's an eternal life hallelujah outside of this your life has no purpose outside of this your life has no meaning i don't care how much degrees you have i don't care how much money you have i don't care what your understanding is this is the only life that matters heaven and earth will pass away but this word turn to spirit as a life oh come on now that could never fail and because god cannot be destroyed this life in you cannot be destroyed come on now hallelujah you may be seated that's why we can say watson what mistake what mind battle what test trial temptation what issue in your in your family could stop this thing from being manifest hallelujah hallelujah this life will wake anything up this life when it was on earth walking on two feet stood in from the grave of lazarus and said lazarus comfort and the prophet told us if he didn't call the name lazarus everyone who was in the grave was going to wake up because that life cannot exist with death once that life comes in contact with something that's dead it's got to come to life [Applause] [Music] and that's why the bible said because he lives you're going to live also so i don't care if you came into this service dead you're not going to leave dead something got a spark whether you lift one hand you lift two hands you stand up on your feet you jump around you spin around you roll on the floor something's got to happen to you because you can't stay the same [Applause] in the beginning the message beginning and ending of the gentile dispensation but ibrahim said what is it the mystery of god god in you the hope of glory shining forth the baptism of the holy ghost the baptism of the holy spirit that's what it is that's all god has been trying to do you know to step into your flesh to step into your hands when you recognize your hands moving and it's not you the brother who you couldn't shake his hand all of a sudden you find your hand connect with his and you can't explain it because you know you had issues and if it was up to you you know you wouldn't shake his hand but there's a different driver in the driver's seat and you're taking no taught you're just being led by the spirit because you have died to yourself but ibrahim said when these things take place time shall be no more they that know their god in the last days many shall run to and through knowledge and increase but they that know their god shall do exploits in the last days they shall do exploits oh exploits of fate is breaking around the world tonight over and over oh hallelujah over this weekend over this convention all over the nations great campaigns the blind are seeing the death by hearing the lames are walking people of all walks of life are coming in and receiving the holy spirit not just in this convention all over the world listen friends nobody has a monopoly on this thing you know god is moving right now all over the world and in groups we don't know about in churches we don't know about in homes we don't know about hallelujah we can't claim that the angel is right here and it's not somewhere else nobody could do that because god is sovereign and his sovereignty allows him to come into your home and come into your situation and come into this meeting and follow his word [Applause] why could we have this confidence brother branham says see we come out of eternity we was before there was a world did you know that god made man in his own image where was you he said to job when job thought he had some wisdom said where was you when i lay the foundation of the world before i laid it when the sons of god sang together and the morning stars shouted for joy the morningstar shouted with joy them shining ones shouted for joy when they seen that someday through a tabernacle here on earth and the king melchizedek would come in the righteousness of god and give his life to redeem us back again and outshine the styles forever and ever in the message oneness here we are in the end time coming from the east and west north and south what are we doing getting ready for that rapture getting ready for listen to the prophet's words holding ourselves steady for a few minutes till every fiber is filled with the holy ghost oh that's my desire is that your desire friends i want every fiber every fiber every molecule every cell every atom to be filled with the holy ghost or from the message i look uh the message the world is again falling apart but ibraham said i look for a rapture for just a handful of people that's right just a handful of people they'll never be missed in this world when they go you'll never know it's gone so it clearly can't be the old church you know he said a handful of people they'll never be missed that's a scary thought you know everybody clear that's a scary thought a handful of people they'll never be missing the world when they go you'll never know it's gone that's right it comes like a thief in the night hallelujah aren't you happy to know there's a way of escape aren't you happy to know there's a way out of this world hallelujah is a temporary escape you know because we got to come back to this earth because this is our territory this is our jurisdiction this is our domain this is our kingdom it's on this earth here so we shall reign on the earth but because judgment is set god has to take us and put us temporarily somewhere to deal with this to prepare this place so when we come back there's no more sin there's no more sickness there's no more depression there's no more frustration there's no more back pain there's no more gray hair there's no more ball head there's no more doctors there's no need for lawyers there's no more need for judges there's no need for engineers there's no need for chefs because when you speak it's created when you move mountains the mountain move when you need to move you could just translate yourself you don't need no cars oh come on now somebody preach back to me no more sadness no more depression no more frustration no more animosity no more envy no more jealousy no more hatred no more malice no more strife no more back biting no more gossiping you know those things can't make it over there right so you might as well stop it now because the life of christ can't oh come on now somebody help me [Applause] friends i've got to make it i've got to make it anybody feels that way i've got to make it hallelujah i've got to make this rapture hallelujah friends it's one thing to mess up and mess up with other things but don't mess up with this rapture hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah i could drop the ball on other things but not just rapture hallelujah i'm not cut out for this tribulation i'm not built for the tribulation but you see the rapture but eclipse i want to be first in line give me the opportunity to be first in line with the ticket the token called the life of christ i want to climb up those seven steps can the church say man in order for you to be a part of this rapture it takes a certain life to be working in you not a church spirit not a message spirit not your human spirit it takes a very specific life to be working in you for you to make the rapture you see you could survive in church you know but you see the rapture takes a certain life you can come to church in your condition but you see the rapture your condition can make the rapture you need something more you need something higher you need something different you need something or somebody help me preach this your good self can't take it to the rapture no you could operate nice in church on the good self but there's only one thing that makes a rapture that's the life of jesus christ and there's no impersonation to the life of jesus christ you can't act this way you can't put on a show this way hallelujah it is that life that makes the rapture possible and only that life that life the life of christ must be flowing through you flowing it has a flow this life has a flow hallelujah it's not a static thing it it moves hallelujah like the wind the wind is blowing again you can't chop it it has a flow it has a it have a movement it's with god there's nothing static there's nothing stationary he wants to move in and out move move through your life he wants to flow through your heart he wants to constantly flow he wants to flow through your mind he wants to flow through your body he wants to flow through your lips he wants to flow through your hands you want to flow through your feet he wants to flow through you to your family the the spirit of god the life of christ has to be flowing like rivers of living water it can't be it's not a dead thing is that a one-time experience and i had something years ago that's not what i'm talking about it's present tense it's a constant connection it's a constant presence it's a constant anointing it's a constant flow it's a constant movement oh hallelujah that's why when you're plugged in when you're connected to the source you can't help yourself you got to do something hallelujah somebody give god a shout out praise [Applause] hallelujah it flows it flows he wants to flow there is my spirit flowing freely he wants to flow is he flowing through you is he flowing in your house is there something stopping him hallelujah he wants to flow he'll flow if you let him he's a gentleman if you stop him he'll stop he said i stand at the door and knock if any man hear my voice open the door i'm going to come in but so i'm willing to come in i'm willing to flow but you have something to do you got to let him in you got to drop your defenses you got to drop your feelings you got to drop your ideas and let him flow you got to let his spirit flow you got to let his anointing flow you're going to surrender your will surrender your feelings surrender your sickness yes that have to die too you know oh yes oh yes you're feeling tired that has nothing to do with it let him flow yo you're feeling wary let him flow you feel like giving up that has to die too let him flow i just can't give up now that's why he said let the weak say i'm strong bring your body under subjection bring your mind on the subjection bring your life on the subjection and let him flow [Applause] he'll flow through you if you let him and it'll stop flowing if you stop him no wonder god said god wants to be able to say there's my spirit flowing freely no wonder jesus can say i am the vine and you are the branches god wants to be connected to his people so that his life can flow through them by the end of this meeting i pray that his life will be flowing through you don't let anything stop the flow friends don't let your job stop the flow don't let family stop the flow don't let your situations stop the flow don't let how you feel stop the flow don't let don't let the pressure don't let bills don't let anything stop the flow he is your source he is your strength it's a connection don't break the connection even when you feel alone don't break the connection even when you feel like god isn't answering you don't break the connection you know how many times david felt as if god wasn't helping him and god wasn't hearing him and he said hear me o god attend unto my prayers and all kind of quotes and scriptures to try to find out why god seems to be silent i am divine and you are the branches hallelujah are you connected to him what are you connected to your connection determines your fruit what you see happening in your life is directly connected to your connected too so when you say i'm not feeling the anointing what are you connected to because if you connect to him you'll feel the anointing i don't understand what all the fussing about what are you connected to because if you're connected to him you'll understand him better by and by and you'll understand that you can't tell god what to do he'll move in in his own time in his own way in his own season and he will move with you different from everybody else because he deals with us as individuals so don't look at nobody else look at your connection to god that's what's most important oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah all of this for the life of christ to be manifested in us through us oh that's been god's desire hallelujah we've preached it before when god existed alone he had nobody to connect with he had nobody to flow through he was existing by himself but he wanted to express his attributes as a father he wanted to express his attribute as a healer he wasn't able to pour himself into somebody but there was nobody to do that with so god started to create and he created his stars and the sun and the moon and everything else and there was still nobody to connect with because he wanted a relationship and when god put man on the earth for the first time he could have a real connection he would come in the cool of the evening and have fellowship with his connection and he would be able to talk about what they did and what adam did in the morning and in the evening and all this stuff and when the devil saw that he was mad so he came to try to break the connection and since that time to this time it has always been about god reconnecting with his children it has always been about god having the preeminence revealing himself taking us back to eden where he had perfect fellowship perfect connection a perfect relationship with his children hallelujah and in our world man has tried to find ways to connect manners tried to use the mobile devices and fact machine and all kinds of stuff to replace that issue of connection hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord but that is no substitute to a real connection with god hallelujah people are comfortable to be connected by technology to be connected by all kinds of stuff but there's nothing like a real connection with god oh blessed be the name of the lord god is longing for a connection he is longing to re-establish fellowship he is longing to find somebody that he could move through and he could see his spirit have the preeminence take the control hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord do you understand what you're missing and when man connection was broken in the days of the tower of babel they try to use human effort to reconnect to god they say let's build a tower to connect to god because they knew there was a connection they were missing there's something in you that is always going to have a desire that food cannot fill that reading cannot fill that knowledge cannot fill that information cannot film there's always a desire because god put a test in your soul for him so people tried to fill it with all kinds of stuff and here they were trying to build a way to get back to god and god looked at their hearts and he saw them motivate the objective he said if they agree and they keep doing this they would actually achieve it and he broke up that unity because that's not how he wanted to connect with them oh come on now somebody preached back to me but through the ages he found a way to connect with noah he found a way to connect with moses he found a way to connect with joshua he found a way to connect with daniel he found a way to connect with elijah and each one of these men had a connection with god he found a way to connect with joel we connect with ezra to connect with micah to connect with gideon to connect with deborah to connect throughout all the ages oh he connected with isaiah and said isaiah i want you to prophesy that a virgin will conceive and will be a child oh come on now somebody preached back to me but the connection brother joelle that he had with these men was not the connection that he had in his mind because he will come and visit them and it will be a temporary thing but he was longing to find a way to make it a permanent thing oh come on somebody preach back to me all these years he was attempting to connect like a wi-fi connection it connects and then sometime it breaks hallelujah they would have to go and make a or a sacrifice hallelujah and they would go and put this lamb there and they would they would kill islam and and the life that was in the lamb that was taking his place would try to be transferred but it couldn't the connection could last because that life was not compatible with the person who was offering the sacrifice these were all attempts have a connection because a sinful life had to be replaced with another life oh but then one day oh one day hallelujah one day there was a star in the sky oh and wise men say this is different this looks like something is happening we must follow this star we know something is happening we have seen this star and they begin to walk towards it because they knew something was happening they had a revelation of something was happening and this little baby that was born in a manger was god's way of creating a connection that will one day become permanent it will not be a temporary connection oh hallelujah somebody preached back to me is not what esa is we know what it is god desiring to have the preeminence but now he has put things in place to have the preeminence so jesus is growing up a little carpenter boy they don't recognize who he is they think he's just anybody no wonder they asked a question when he got older is not this joseph's son because he's moving kind of different he talking kind of different he walking kind of different what was it a mystery he stood there in the temple read the scripture and said that the spirit of the lord is upon me for he hath anointed me and he reads it and they think it's just brother jesus he was just in church and brother jesus you heard where did jesus read it and when he was finished and said this day this scripture is fulfilled something was happening it was one step closer to a permanent connection we moved one step closer to a permanent connection and jesus his whole ministry his whole purpose was not to feed the five thousand his whole purpose was not to open the blind eyes that was on the way to this great purpose being accomplished of restoring his preeminence of revealing his great mystery of christ in you the hope of glory or somebody preached back to me [Applause] [Music] oh hallelujah and when jesus died and rose again it was now in place that the life the spirit life that could not have been transferred from animals to man now this spirit life was now transferable peter and they didn't even understand it they didn't even understand it because when jesus died peter and all of them got depressed and these are to rose again and they had to open their understanding in his resurrection ministry to what was about to happen and even still they had to wait until the promise but then all of a sudden the bible says there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind and it filled the whole house oh hallelujah it was not a regular service it was a different kind of service they had been in powerful services they had jesus as their pastor but this service was different all of a sudden there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind and what was manifested temporarily before was now ready to be made manifested permanently and jesus divided himself and step into peter's heart and give peter a boldness that he never knew before give him an assurance he never had before and gave him something that he could go to the gate called beautiful and say silver and gold i don't have but i have a connection hallelujah hi i'm a branch and i'm connected to a vine harley look you say rise up and walk and that man who was crippled started to walk and started to jump and shout and then the devil knew he was in trouble because the connection was re-established and god made it so perfect that even to this day now you could still get that same connection and not a different connection because the promise of the holy ghost is just as real today as it was on the day of pentecost [Applause] not a different holy ghost and friends peter didn't even know who he was you know peter backslid peter denied christ peter made mistakes but he was still predestinated peter denied even knowing christ but that seed in him was a guarantee that there was a life to follow that word seed that even though peter was in his condition peter still found himself in the upper room and i don't care what condition you are in this day you have found yourself to the upper room may this convention be an upper room experience for you between you and god [Applause] oh blessed be the name of the lord everybody feeling fine brother branham said in the message the world is falling apart he said what we need to do is get connected that's all right now get connected with christ our lives of our emotion the lies of our mind connected to him the restoration of the full world made a way for a perfect connection the word as the conductor of the spirit so the husband and the lord himself send the prophet to reveal every mystery hallelujah so we could have the fullness of the word now in the message perfection but everybody said time now time is this little loop it loops down jesus was from eternity to eternity but he stepped into the time space and was made flesh and came through here in order to sanctify or put a streak of blood all over this place to redeem it and connect it back with god again for all eternity listen for all eternity you see it that's all time is in time-tested memorials that's the way god does his church and listen to this quote now he gives you trial after trial test after test trial after trial anybody feel this way test after test until listen what he's looking for the life of christ is reflected in your life until you become peaceful sober meek gentle humble ready submissive willing turn your head from the things of the world i'm reading the prophet's word looking straight to calvary to the one who's doing the beating many times you think it's strange because fiery trials and sickness and persecution is only done to test you to get the dirt out of you to get the sludge out of you to get the slowness out of you to wake you up to the place where you could look and see the reflection or men see the reflection of christ in you christ in you the hope of glory can the church give the lord a shout of praise [Applause] that's such a powerful quote i want to read it one more time hallelujah because this court puts the rest you're complaining this quote puts to rest your problems this quote puts the rest why me why this how this happened why this happened he said that's the way god does his church he gives you trial after trial so get used to it test after test trial after trial test after test somebody said trial after trial test after test and the where the prophet said trial after trial test after test trial after trial test after test until in other words this keeps repeating over and over and over again trial and testing trial and testing so don't complain about it because this is god's way trial after test until the life of christ so until he sees this you have another child coming you know until he sees his reflection you have another test coming what did he say in adoption he could turn your family against you he could turn the church against you he could turn your wife against you he could throw in a better sickness try it after triumph test after it's a process because when he's done with you it's no more your idea you're feeling your emotion it's just jesus it's just jesus says we would see jesus until the life of christ is reflected in your life until you become listen how much words brother branham use here peaceful sober meek gentle humble ready are you ready submissive willing turn your head from the things of the world and look straight to calvary to the one who's doing the beating many times you think it's strange because fiery trials and sickness and persecution it's only done to test you to get the dirt out of you to get the sludge out of you to get the slowness some of us just too slow but the brandon would say stand up quickly and claim your healing he said don't move don't muslim receive it quickly the word is going for respond quickly to get the slowness out of you to wake you up how much more trials and testing do you need for you to be woken up to the place where you can look and see the reflection or men can see the reflection of christ in you christ in you the hope of glory hallelujah i am the vine yeti branches and these branches supposed to produce fruit the vine doesn't produce the fruit the branches produce the fruit in the message of conflict between god and satan fruits of the spirit what she's got listen to the prophet what is this fruit is with joy that's what he's supposed to have joy of her heart knowing that he's coming soon anybody have that joy anybody looking for that joy knowing that he's coming soon he said peace of mind what peace of mind know what no matter what comes or what goes let the ship rock let the storms come let the lightning flash the thunder roar whatever takes place don't make a bit of difference atomic bombs could fall you can build rock shelter bombshell whatever you want to do but she's still saying amen amen why she is 45 fortified and what the word the word what made flesh i'm reading the prophet you know dwelling among us watching him move among us in our assembly see there he is so what difference does it make oh hallelujah from the message what is the holy ghost now the spirit of god has worked under justification understand on the luther sanctification under uh under wesley the the baptism of the holy ghost under pentecost and here it is in the last day performing and doing the very same thing that it did when it was in christ what is it the church and christ has become one that's what is it branch and vine right as soon as they connect together that last link she'll go through the sky shouting up will come where's the loot and all the rest of them back in those days there he's at first will be last hallelujah we're at the end time listen that's what the holy ghost does the holy ghost by justification see just a little shadow of it the holy ghost by sandification so what is the prophet showing that is the same holy ghost that was operating in every age it was the same holy ghost by justification the same holy ghost by scientification a little deeper shadow of it the holy ghost by the baptism of it a deeper shadow no the holy ghost by the restoration of his very person being in here forming signs and wonders like he did at the beginning oh what a hope for us friends what a reality to us friends oh what a joy to know that the person the life of christ will be made manifest and it will be a manifestation of the life of christ in us living himself out producing these things from us oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord in the message christ is the mystery of god reveal and if the life of jesus christ ever puts out another body of believers it'll bear the fruit that the first one did they'll write a book of acts behind it because it'll be the same same life listen it'll be the same same life so it wouldn't be a book of acts for us to have more church services it'll be to produce a manifestation i don't care how many people god has there will be a bunch of people that will produce another book of hacks there will be some surrendered individuals who are sold out to this great gospel that is great truth to leave you could take the whole world but give me jesus you can take all the technology but give me jesus you can take all the pleasures of this world but give me jesus [Applause] they'll write a book of acts behind it because it'll be the same same life see what i mean you just can't get away from it it's a life of christ in you listen to the prophet being injected in you by the holy spirit itself living his life through you where are you in this equation doing anything he said is the life of christ in you being injected in you so you come to church one way but there's a holy spirit giving an injection add in something putting something inside of you that that you didn't come with this morning but you're leaving with more of god you're leaving with a greater anointing a greater purpose a greater revelation and greater understanding until the fullness of the world connects with the fullness of the spirit and you become a written epistle oh hallelujah when they see you they see a manifested son when they see you they see an adopted son when they see you you see a son formed into the word image oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah i'm not going to be too much longer but god is known by simplicity and of revelation of jesus christ to the most illiterate person it has nothing to do with your education see not your theology it's a revelation of jesus christ upon this rock i'll build my church no other rocks accepted no other things accepted no other roman rock no other protestant rock no other school no other nothing but on exactly the revelation of jesus christ through the new birth there must be a transformation he burns in there hallelujah and he injects his own life and your life is gone the things you can't stop doing that's gone the things you can't give up that's gone your selfish ways gone your fears gone your emotions gone [Applause] he is born in there anybody won that this morning anybody won that this he won his life he said your life is gone he borns in there and he injects his own life friends that's how you overcome you know you have to be willing to die out to you die out to your feelings your emotions your personality all these things and the life of christ is projecting itself through you with the preeminences of the people that they see the very life the works and signs and wonders that he did is doing the same thing through you this is not to the church now this is the individual to you overcoming in your home overcoming in your marriage overcoming in your house overcoming on your job jesus multiplied jesus there jesus there jesus there jesus over there jesus in the bus station jesus driving a car jesus in the doctor's room jesus in the restaurant jesus in the gas station everywhere the messiah it's hallelujah hallelujah there's my spirit flowing freely there's another one over there there's a housewife over there there's a doctor over there there's a engineer over there there's a deacon over there there's an usher over there there's a husband a son a daughter a child in a primary school in a secondary school in a university hallelujah singing you could take the whole world but give me jesus you can take the pleasure of sin but give me jesus goodbye world good morning glory i know where i come from i know who my father is i know i'm a child of the king i know i'm not from this place i'm heaven bound hallelujah i'm not what i used to be i'm not all away what i'm supposed to be but i'm leaving this place hallelujah when you miss me i'm gone goodbye world good morning glory i can't wait to leave this place kinda church say amen oh blessed be the name of the lord outside of that the rest of it don't even call two at all you see that outside of that you're leaving call you're sitting along in church and you're not even called if you're not producing this life um by lack of this revelation is why we have so many different divisions among us and so much mockery so much division among us is because the people lack that revelation see they lack the revelation to teach us oh i'm getting ready to wind down in christ is the mystery of god revealed continuing his body was not held in the grave this is eastern ah recognized with him in the resurrection same as he is now listen which means this his word listen carefully which he is has been begin to be risen the word that down through the age of luther where's the sea has begun to raise up to its power so brother branham is speaking here and christ is a mystery of god reveal the word coming alive rising into power in the measure of luther's day in the measure of wesley's day the word through the age of luther where they see has begun to raise up to its power there it begin to move and it moved a little more now see it's coming up to identification and remember we said only that the light the very life of christ is the identification of the bride not your group but your revelation to that identification see watch now to the life in the body is a vindication of the rapture is at hand when you see the headship and the body becoming one and the fullness of the measure of his manifestation shows that the body is about to be received to the headship see what i mean he has begun to give life unto his body why the one that he has redeemed the mediatorial work is done he's bringing his life to the body oh hallelujah i'm getting ready to wind down the restoration of the bright tree easter is the resurrection restoring to restore back its god restoring time and if there was ever a time of restoration that's what we are in now because the great prophet elijah malachi 4 was to restore to reconnect to reestablish a scatter all the loose ends and all the mysteries and bring it back into one great mystery you look out over the earth god is restoring restoring what nature that's right he restoring the flowers he's restoring the leaves he's destroying the fruit of the field what is it god is restoring its easter means to bring it back hallelujah oh my listen no other life could work in her listen close now i want you not to fail to get this no other church no other sign no other fellowship no other government i'm reading the prophet no other testimony no other creed no denomination is accepted outside of this god accepts nothing else but christ in you the hope of glory the only thing that god recognizes no fellowship no church no creed no denomination no nothing everything else is dead it's fragments that has to be cut off pruned off away from the thing that christ might live with preeminences in you oh hallelujah in scriptural signs of the time the prophet said he that believe it on me the works that i do the thing that i do shall he do also that's your promise the same works and even greater don't need any interpretation that's the prophet you don't need any interpretation your son is in trouble you're going to have power to speak back to your son your family is sick god's gonna give you power to deal with it you won't even have to come to the elders it's gonna be christ in you in your house and your job dealing with situation the same life in the vine is in the branches the same branch that come forth on the day of pentecost hallelujah in spoken word is your original seed all right now here's what i'm trying to say to you the law of reproduction bring forth of its kind these last days the true church bride comes to the headstone will be the super church a super race as they near the great headstone they will be much like him so much like him even they will be in his very image his very image that's only possible when it's his life in order to be united with him because he could only connect to his life born of my bone spirit of my spirit but that's me the same spirit oneness can the church say amen oh there will be one the prophet said there will be the very manifestation of the word of the living god not your idea of it not your interpretation of it not even your understanding of it it'll be the very manifestation of the word of the living god what an encouragement to know that the same god who gave us the word is going to come down to live this word and to make this world live it won't be even you living the word out it'll be his spirit living his own word [Applause] [Music] you know that's like the unconditional covenant god tell man don't do this and man broke the confidence he went and eated a tree so go make an unconditional covenant swore by himself no one greater that if your name is on the book no devil could take it out unconditional covenant that even if you have to drag you you're coming dna believing himself but because his name written gideon almighty man of allah you say who me i don't feel valor i don't feel that i have nothing to do with come come i'll show you who you are i'll show you what you're called to do you don't have self-confidence moses stood there you see i can't talk when moses was done he said any more excuses you're still going down to egypt because i already wrote the book and i'm not changing what i wrote in the book i'm not changing the story for anybody if i wrote that moses is going to deliver the children of egypt whatever condition moses is in he need to get in line with what i wrote in the book gideon was written to deliver them from the chief from the media knight whatever gideon feels thing doesn't matter that is what he's written for and all through the ages god finding one here one here that he wrote about before the foundation aren't you so glad about predestination that we fully recall who oh come on now nothing going to stop this word from being manifested in your life oh hallelujah winding down they will be the very manifestation of the word of the living god denominations can never produce this they will produce their creeds and dogmas mixed with the word and brings a hybrid product oh hallelujah friends i'm not talking about you trying to do something trying to be a christian trying to be a good person trying to be holy i'm talking about christ the person of christ the holy spirit himself the mighty conqueror revealed in you as the pillar of fire not in your mind but in your heart you will walk into your house with the pillar of fire you will go to sleep with the pillar of fire you will wake up in the morning with the pillar of fire the pillar of fire will keep you on your job it'll keep you in your school it'll keep you in your family it'll protect your house the pillar of fire will keep you on fire the lord himself is going to step into you go tell my disciples this easter that sirs the time is at hand and the very manifestation of the life of christ in you is a vindication of this rapture oh hallelujah trying to close out question and answers but iran said before there was a world you were in god's thoughts to give you the holy ghost so even before the world was created it was god thinking about you getting the holy ghost before you knew there was such a thing called the holy ghost before you could sigh and cry for the holy ghost before you could ever desire the holy ghost but abandonment saying before there was a world you were in god's thoughts to give you the holy ghost because he knew you'd be wanting it oh hallelujah all over the building dear sons and daughters who want the holy ghost and he chose you himself because you desired he chose you in christ before you or jesus any of you was on the earth and he sent jesus to die to prepare the way to send the holy ghost to bring you to himself so that's what the holy ghost is for to bring you to himself oh that's i know this is the church so i'm at home now i'm reading a prophet he said oh this is so rich to me to think listen to think it's not what i wanted it wasn't my desires it wasn't my will it wasn't my choosing i had not one thing to do with it but before the world ever started god saw us and put our name on the lands work of life before there was ever a world talk about god and you want to have doubt and fear i want you to rejoice because you shall be filled you shall receive the holy ghost and the very manifestation of the life of christ will be in you mrs jesus christ god richly bless you ivory coast god richly bless you [Music] glory to god hallelujah oh give him praise give him praise hallelujah hallelujah oh hallelujah glory be to god oh
