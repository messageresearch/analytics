Jesus and when you finish greet and when you open your Bibles I'm not a speaker this morning but I going to bless you with the word this morning we appreciate brother Anthony praise the Lord amen so we want turn our Bibles to Ephesians chapter 2 and we want to read from verse 11 wherefore remember that ye being in time pass Gentiles In the Flesh who are called un uncircumcision by that which is called the circumcision of the flesh made by hands that at the time you were without Christ being aliens from the Commonwealth of Israel and strangers from the Covenant of Promise having no hope without God in the world but now in Christ Jesus ye who sometimes were far off are made nigh by the blood of Christ for he is our peace who had made both one and had broken down the middle wall of partition between us having abolished in his flesh the enmity even the law of Commandments contained in ordinances for to make himself of Twain one new man so making peace and that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the cross having slain the enmity thereby and came and preached peace to you which were a far off to them that were nigh for through him we both have access by one Spirit unto the father now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners but fellow citizens with the Saints and of the household of God and are built upon the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets Jesus Christ himself being the Chief Cornerstone in whom all the the building fitly framed together grow it unto an Holy Temple in the Lord in whom ye are buil together for a habitation of God through the spirit let's pray father we thank you for your word and a few uh thoughts to share with your people before the speaker come this morning I pray that you would bless it interpret it our hearts as we wait upon you we commit Our Lives unto you bless the speaker as he comes forth May the anointing the Fire Fall upon him give him the unction to speak your word may ministering Spirits drop down to minister to those who are ears of Salvation we commit Our Lives once more unto you in Jesus name we ask that we pray bless those connected to us this morning and those who are hear the witness the testimony the preaching and in all may you be glorified in Jesus name we ask it amen and amen you may be seated oh praise the name of the Lord well greetings in Jesus name amen as always it's a privilege to be here in the house of God Amen well praise the lord it's a blessing to be here and uh we want to even welcome those who are connected with us this morning on the internet want to say greetings and God bless you so we are looking for a wonderful time in the Lord amen so I trust you were blessed last Sunday Hallelujah that Ephesian bride comes into view there's a picture that you have to see amen of what God requires of us because we still fighting up with church membership hallelujah it's a battle church membership and I believe it was identifying that part of Ephesians that I was talking about uh last Sunday you are no longer strangers but you are fellow citizens of the household of the saintsall so I was doing some studies and I was looking at the Amplified of that scripture and I want to read it for you this morning what Paul was saying here in Ephesians okay listen carefully therefore this is verse 19 in the Amplified you are no longer Outsiders Exile migrants and Aliens excluded from the rights of citizens but you you now share citizenship with the Saints God's Own people consecrated and set apart for himself Hallelujah and you belong to God's Own household Hallelujah now this is very powerful and very important because Jesus said to Nicodemus except you be born again you can't enter into the Kingdom of Heaven amen so Jesus was talking about something to get into am amen so I begin to realize that God's kingdom will have no illegal immigrants amen [Music] amen and to be a citiz you have to be born yes sir into the kingdom yes to get citizen rights on so I'm now beginning to see that once you are citizen you have rights if you are not a citizen you don't have the rights amen but once you a citizen you have a [Applause] right Hallelujah because you are citizen of that country oh could we give the Lord some Praises people Glory all the benefits in that country belongs to you if you call they have to answer if you protest they have to respond because you belong to that country nobody can boot you out kick you out cut you out because you belong there can somebody say Amen you have a right to Healing you have a right to breakthrough you have a right to Revival you have a right to overcoming because you are a citizen of that country Oh Glory Hallelujah glory to God Amen you believe that amen and Jesus said Matthew 18 verily I say unto you except you be converted and become as Little Children You shall not enter into the Kingdom of Heaven whosoever therefore shall humble himself as a little child the same is the greatest isn't that right Matthew 10 he said when Jesus saw it he was much displeased and said unto them suffer the little children to come unto me and forbid them not for such as the kingdom of God verily I say unto you whosoever will not receive the kingdom of God as a little child he shall not enter therein it's that simple there's a kingdom and we have to belong to it amen we have to become a citizen of it yes sir do you believe that oh glory to God and church membership conflicts with that citizenship yes Hallelujah so you could be a good church member and not a citizen amen because to a citizen you have to be born into it and then the rights belong to you when you walk you don't walk afraid you're not ducking the immigration you're not ducking the authorities you ducking anybody you belong you are no more stranger but you are citizen glory to God you belong to that country you belong to that Kingdom Oh Glory to God you can be pouring it but you still belong to that that Kingdom you can be struggling it but you belong to that Kingdom you're not a stranger you're not a foreigner you're not an alien you're not out of place to go to the father and ask for this and ask for that you're not out of place to tell the government we need to fix the roads you're not out of place to ask for electricity to ask for water you're not out of place because you have a kingdom Oh Glory to God and there's a king in that Kingdom and that domain is where he rules and Reigns it have a language it have a people it have a order it have rules it have laws oh that anything goes oh could be say Amen somebody Hallelujah so you to bring your own stuff in that Kingdom you have to conform to that Kingdom you have to find out what the king wants in that Kingdom you have to find out the order in that Kingdom you know there's strips in that Kingdom and say you are in the Kingdom there's a program that is there there's a system that is there there's an order that is there and this Kingdom you can't vote it out you can't put it out this kingdom is a kingdom that cannot be moved oh could we give the Lord a shout of praise that's the kingdom you come out of what you're in to belong to and there's going to be an Ephesians people there's going to be a church that's going to be a real kingdom of God people oh give you Lord a shout of Praise that kingdom is not in a building that kingdom is the kingdom of the most high God [Music] hallu glory Hall you may be seated have a stinger for you now you can't live your private life in that Kingdom hallelujah hallelujah in other words you can't have a private Kingdom in the king's Kingdom no you got to have to have a transformation you got to conform what the kingdom have in it you got to eat what they eat wear what they wear do what they do that's the kingdom that we talking about it is not your kingdom is his kingdom he's the king of the kingdom and he have Messengers he have servants that bring instructions from the kingdom they don't have their own message they represent a message when they come forth they don't speak of themselves they come to preach the kingdom that come for word from the kingdom oh Hallelujah when they come they come to represent the kingdom when Moses went up to Pharaoh they say whose kingdom are you from he said the kingdom of the most high god oh it wasn't Egypt it wasn't Syria it wasn't Libya it was a kingdom that the eyes could not see but he had the authority and the power to influence and to produce from the [Applause] kingdom Hallelujah [Applause] may be seated hallelujah hallelujah you see he can join a church and become a church member but they canot join the kingdom if you say you are in the Kingdom there must be something to separate from other peoples because you're leaving one Kingdom to enter into another kingdom and you have to give your citizenship from one Kingdom to get the citizenship of another kingdom amen you have to give up you have to leave what's behind to go forward into this new kingdom if you are not giving up you can't be a citizen of the country that you are proposing that you going be sit now come on now say Amen somebody so you have to give up what you think and what you feel and how you feel to operate because you coming in a new kingdom you coming in a new system you comeing on a new order your family say this but that has nothing to do with them hallelujah [Music] hallelujah so that's why people fight to become citizens yes yes I was doing some searching and I I got the pledge that they ask the people who become citizens of United States to see and I was looking at it and just checking it out YouTube one particular place that 49 people from I think 50 uh or 51 people from 49 countries gu in my room have all the dignitaries and the people have them holding the American flag and this is what they have to pledge the oath of Allegiance I he by declare on oat and I absolutely and entirely renounce and obsure all Allegiance and Fidelity to any foreign Prince pented state or sovereignity of whom or which I have here to for been a subject or all right that's good as saying I renounce the works of darkness the devil his forces the world the things of the world the cares of this life are you hearing me preaching this [Applause] morning this is what they have to say before they attain citizenship right

the way amen praise God certain want to appreciate the pastor this morning and brother Isaac ID say God bless you praise God certainly appreciate those three messages that went forth before [Applause] amen I don't know if I can say anything to really do it justice but I think I'll just read the titles again I think that speak volumes an open Vision has been released by Malachi 4 uh the second message in succession was let us Cross Jordan to uh an open vision of another Ephesians and then last Sunday what we heard the Ephesians bride comes into view amen what a what a series of messages syney appreciate amen the inspiration has been a real blessing amen now let's turn to our Bibles amen real quick amen I have a thought to share with you this morning and well I don't think it would be hard for you to believe but it Dove tailes right into what brother ID was talking about just now so praise God we'll get into it amen so let's turn to three portion of scripture we want to go to Genesis Genesis chapter 13 read from verse 8 there and then um also you can find St Luke 12 and 1 Peter chapter 2 okay but first we we go to Genesis 13 and um praise God we'll start from there pick up this story with Abraham amen and um praise God Genesis 13 and reading from verse 8 speaks about Abraham's separation from lot and we'll just read a small part here but praise God from verse 8 says and Abraham said unto Lord let there be no Strife I pray thee between me and thee and between my heard men and thy heard men for we are Brethren amen I'll read on it says is not the whole land before thee separate thyself I pray thee from me if thou Willl take the left hand then I will go to the right or if thou depart to the right hand then I will go to the left and lot lifted up his eyes and behold all the plain of joy G that it uh was well watered everywhere before the Lord destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah even as a garden of the Lord like the land of Egypt as thou comest into zor and then lot shows him all the plain of Jordan and lot uh journeyed East and they separated themselves then one from the other Abraham dwelt in the land of Canaan and lot dwelt in the cities of the plain and pitched his tent towards Jordan uh Sodom sorry so what Sodom but the men of Sodom were Wicked and sinners before the Lord exceedingly okay so we'll stop there well let's go over now to uh St Luke 12 we want to read from verse 51 to 53 okay and then we'll go over to 1 Peter 2 amen praise God so St Luke Chapter uh uh 12 amen um down to verse verse 51 amen St Luke 12:51 and it says suppose ye that I am come to give peace on Earth I tell you n but rather division for from hence forth there shall be five in one house divided three against two and two against three the father shall be divided against the son the son against the Father the the mother against the daughter the daughter against the mother the Mother-in-law against the daughter-in-law and the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law and let's turn over now to First Peter chapter 2 and we'll read from verse 9 amen and then we'll uh say a word of prayer praise God 1 Peter chapter 2 okay amen 1 Peter chapter 2 reading from verse 9 it says but he are chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation A peculiar people that you should show forth the Praises of him who hath called you out of Darkness Into His Marvelous Light which in times past were not a people but are now the people of God which had not obtained Mercy but now have obtained Mercy amen isn't that right let's bow our heads for word of prayer Heavenly Father we've read your word this morning Lord father we thank you for your word that has gone forth already but I pray oh God for a few minutes Lord father that your presence would come down lord father in a special way Lord we are nothing without your presence Lord I nothing without your presence father and Lord these people Lord we need you Lord father more now more than ever Lord go before us this morning and Lord May uh uh divide the scriptures father rightly among your people Lord Lord May edify strengthen Lord may you build up Lord father take complete control of my vocal cords Lord the words that I speak Lord father my mind Lord father May anoint my every fiber of my being Lord father and help me to be a servant today Lord father to your people people Lord father Lord let Lord that your people could come into this glorious Vision that you want to unfold to us Lord but it only come oh god father by a separation Lord father so Lord we pray your Holy Spirit come down now Lord and anoint your word Lord father and anoint this day Lord we give it over into your hands in Jesus name we pray and ask it amen and amen you may have your seats praise God Hallelujah to God hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah thank you Lord amen do you love the Lord this morning amen are you happy to be in the house of the Lord hallu praise God hallelujah it's always a good thing to serve God it's a good thing to be able to come into his house and give him praise and worship not many people have this opportunity and yet there's only one life to live but God saw it fit to choose you and to love you and to bless you the way he has and he wants to bless you more this morning but there's something we've got to do there's something something we've got to fulfill and we want to get into that this morning is that right praise God so for a title I've chosen this morning a total separation for a total Deliverance amen amen do you love him this morning amen glory to God you know when a thief goes into a house he normally goes in and he has a little limited time to work with because the sun's coming up and he can't get caught so a thief goes into a house and he starts turning stuff up turning this over flipping this over ripping out everything upheaval destruction because he's looking for possessions he's looking for Treasures he's looking for things that he could sell he's looking for things that he could use for money isn't that right that's how a thief Works isn't that right and I can't help but sometimes we as preachers we come sometimes to turn some stuff up Hallelujah because we only have a short time to work with so we come to turn over some things this morning and to pull out a few things and to rip out a few things because we are looking for Treasures this morning we're looking for valuable things this morning we're looking for valuables this morning isn't that right hallelujah hallelujah so we come to turn some stuff up this morning so I hope it's it's okay with you if we turn some stuff over this morning I hope it's okay if we open some doors this morning I hope it's okay if we invade the the space this morning but but sometimes we need a little Invasion this morning Hallelujah cuz we get too comfortable in our comfort zone things are all right and things are in a bed of ease but but God doesn't operate like that God doesn't have a plateau God doesn't just get to one settled place and he's all right with that no God always looking for Progress God always looking for what's the next thing what's the vision what's the purpose what are we trying to achieve amen isn't that right and once this vision is open to a man he gets into that Vision then there's nothing stopping him because God shares something with him God breaks open a seal to him and he's inspired he is enthused his whole mind is different his whole approach is different his whole way of doing things is different his whole anointing is different his whole approach is different so we want to change our approach this morning we want to change the way we approach this service this morning we want to change the way we praise we want to change the way we worship we want to change the way we do things because God is looking for results oh Hallelujah is that right God is not satisfied with you just coming to church and going back home you'll go to hell in that condition until you change something about your attitude this morning oh because with what you have you're not going to make it don't kid yourself this morning don't fool yourself this morning with what we have we are not going to make it it's going to take a power like we have never known before to take us up into glory and into the rapture [Music] oh is that right amen a total separation huj for total Deliverance am God's word always call for total separation isn't that right separate yourself the same thing brother over is talking about this morning you come out of one country you're a citizen of this country and they have their way of doing things and then when you migrate and go to another place there's a different place there's different houses there's different streets the people talk different they greet each other different they wear different clothes there's a different climate you can't wear the same clothes you was wearing in one country and wear it in another country where there's another atmosphere and another setting isn't that right you have to be outfitted for the battle you have to be prepared to go and meet what you're going to meet in there and if we go into another Ephesians you can't go in there in a vest and a short pants no put on the whole armor of God that you may be able to stand having done all to standall oh Hallelujah is that right it's a battle it's a Warfare It's one day up one day you're down but you've got to make it because God promised the land God give us the land and we not going to back down we've come too far to turn back now not when we on the threshold of the greatest anointing that has ever struck a bride in any age prior oh hallelujah hallelujah come on now church we haven't seen power yet but you wait till them seven Thunders utter their voices to that group you wait till that group could take the word and hand it to you wait till it slice and cut oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah isn't that right it's all is preaching Sunday to Sunday and weekday services and you getting in the word and in the spirit is to prepare you for what's coming is to prepare for you for what's about to take place you have not yet gone into the Wilderness we are still being prepared for that you have not yet gone to meet the Lucifer face to face you are being prepared for that right now by Revelation and by the word to stimulate you to motivate you to show you what you are to possess isn't that right glory to God wonderful wonderful cuz it was such groups that didn't possess the land that was they were supposed to possess isn't that right they contended oh hall for a little while but then they got slack concerning their promise they got lazy concerning what God had spoken to them and the amorites became a dwelling with them and different ones was dwelling with the jebusites was dwelling with this group and they were contented to sit around and lay around with demons and lay around with demons in their home and lay around with Supernatural forces and they were contended to to have Fellowship the Bible says can light have fellowship with darkness no it cannot light is light darkness is Darkness flesh is flesh spirit is Spirit Marvel not that you must be born again oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah but Caleb Caleb was an individual yes notice Caleb didn't represent any particular group Caleb was one man by himself Caleb say I have strength I can't speak for anybody else in this church but I myself have strength for war both to go out and to come back in he wasn't depending on anybody he wasn't waiting for nobody to say hallelujah he wasn't waiting for nobody to stand up in the service if Caleb want to scream he scream if Caleb want to shout he shout nothing was holding him back don't let nothing hold you back this morning you are individual this morning in God you can possess your land if you want it oh Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah my God my God hallelujah you see the thing I realize is that oh praise God Malachi 4's message was designed specifically not for church members to survive there was actually actually it was actually tailored that way so the ones who trying to fight for church membership really don't have a clear understanding of what Malachi 4's message was to produce it was to produce another Ephesians it was supposed to produce a bride marching on to Perfection made up of individuals who have made up their mind to give up the world citizenship and to adopt Christ citizenship and to become citizens of his kingdom to renounce the world to separate themselves from all unbelief and to follow after God with all of their heart oh hallelujah hallelujah brother brandham said I didn't come to build no denomination he come to call Members into the bride he come to call us out of leosia for us to make up that Pride age that headstone age oh Hallelujah there's only perfection in [Applause] [Music] there amen amen isn't that right Hallelujah I think I'll just take my time it wasn't meant to encourage organization it wasn't meant to encourage denomination he blasted that right he was calling to the individuals it was five people in the service understood he was saying but the Brandon was preaching to those five people but he had a vision of a bride coming into view he had a vision of a bride Marching In Step marching in perfect order nothing out of kater nothing in chaos no no no no lights on this side Darkness on the other here's the church passing in all their mockery and in all their fleshling and in all their carnality but when that Bride come back into view oh she was beautiful oh she was dressed right oh she looked right oh she was beautiful to behold oh it was a bride of Jesus Christ Jesus been waiting a long time to get this bride and he's not going to settle for less he wants the same prde that he had down a Pentecost that same bride will emerge again out of the darkness a bride will come forth emerge praise God forg in the fire of God's love hallelujah hallelujah I counsel the by of me gold tried and fire oh hallelujah hallelujah isn't that right amen gold what is that that's character and character is not a gift character is a victory you have to fight to get character you have to go through the fire to get character you have to go through something to get character you have to give up something to get character you have to get there Hallelujah into that place that God has called you to be at in order to get cold tried in the fire amen amen hallelujah they say that pure gold gold gold in its purest form Hallelujah isn't that yellowish thing that we we call Gold like you know to make rings it and so on gold in its purest form it's almost Crystal I think it's it's like a mirror you could look in it and see yourself that's gold in its purest form that's what they say and I believe that's what that's the kind of goal that God was talking about he must be able to see himself reflecting when he looks at you he must be able to see his character in your mirror of your life reflecting back Christ when people look at you they must look and see the reflection of Christ in the mirror of your life because your life is now a mirror the purest gold tried in the fires of God reflecting the life of God reflecting the virtues of God oh Hallelujah when that white light strikes that mirror out comes those rainbows flashing 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 what is it the pure word of God being man manifested in your life is that what we're looking for this morning amen amen so God is a god of Holiness isn't that right God is a god of Purity God has his own character God has his own nature amen isn't that right isn't that right but over is likening it to the the a kingdom Hallelujah is that right and God has a kingdom set up in such a way and it it it it it has its own way of doing things it has its own modus of arandi you cannot move as normal in this Kingdom you cannot operate the way he was always operating no you have to change the way you've been looking change the way you've been doing things change your approach change your direction your motive your objective everything must line up with the word of God for the hour hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah and if it's not lining up then you need to find it you need to find out what God wants and go do it quickly isn't that right Glory I saw a quotation on Facebook it was kind of funny this uh Russian scientist I think was said that um he said they if there is a God then we should try to find him and find out what he wants for us he said but if there isn't a God he said and this Earth is spinning somewhere in the Galaxy at 100 something thousand mil hour and nobody is in control of it but if there is a go we should find him we should seek him out with all of our hearts and find out what he wants for our lives because there has to be some purpose there has to be some meaning for us to be here or we would not be here this morning isn't that right oh Hallelujah so many have gone into the ground and died but you are still here this morning their deaths their murders all around the country but how come you still alive there's got to be some purpose for your life there's got to be something that God hasn't store for you there's got to be something oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah is life really meaningless as it seems is life really hum drum Jerry as it looks or is there some purpose for your life this morning or is there some meaning for your life this morning I don't even know what I'm saying anymore this morning but I feel God is in control and God is ministering to somebody this morning that needs to hear what is being said this morning there has to be a purpose there has to be some reason why you are sitting in this church this morning you didn't just come because you're feeling cish there has to be some reason there has to be some call in your heart that God is speaking to and something inside of you is responding to that call oh hallelujah [Applause] [Music] [Applause] hallelujah I don't know I was trying to explain Christianity to somebody they were saying Anthony what's Christianity like I said well I know the person like technology so I kind of reference it to that I said it's like you have a tablet or cell phone and you can get calls and texts that's fine anybody could use a cell phone that way that's a general purpose of a cell phone but when you turn on the Wi-Fi then that cell phone or that smartphone or whatever it becomes so much more there's a lot more that you can do with it it could become your personal planner it could become your calculator your programmer you can download an app for literally anything you want in the universe of apps there's over hundred thousand thousands and thousands of apps I don't know they've reached a million yet or I don't know but but but there's so much to access with that Wi-Fi but without the Wi-Fi you're limited to calls and texts it's about it that's about what any good cell phone provider could give you outside of Wi-Fi isn't that right and I said there's some people that have cell phones but they it's underutilized they never turn on the Wi-Fi as far as they're concerned they get calls and they get texts and they're happy with that but there are some people that just are burning with a desire to get this wi-fi because they know with that Wi-Fi they could get so much more with that Wi-Fi they could access so much more programs and they could get into that universe that is out there somewhere they can't touch it with their hands but they can interact with it through this smart phone or this smart device isn't that right isn't that right so so so when you are connected come on now to this Supernatural world that we're talking about when you are supernaturally connected to this Unseen World that we're talking about this this unseen reality it's like when you flip on your Wi-Fi all of a sudden God begins to start downloading downloading updates and your phone is pinging and something is happening and every day something is happening to you why because you are connected oh say Amen somebody that's why you must be born again you no longer become a creature of this time you become a creature of Eternity you belong to God and his kingdom oh Hallelujah and then through you you could heal the sick through you if there somebody has diabetes and they need a healing God could download something through your Wi-Fi and outcome healing to heal the sickness of whatever they have need of touch them by the infirmities oh you become all things to all men oh that by all means you might save some oh hallelujah hallelujah outside of that calls and texts it's up to you what kind of device you want to be amen but I want to be total used by God in whatever way he has for me to use me I'll be used that way but it'll be the grace of God to me amen how God has a gift for you he'll give it to you and you'll use it for the purpose and the furance of the Gospel but this gospel must be preached and then the end shall come don't look for signs don't look for distresses and uh Wars of Nations and that's supposed to happen Jesus talked about those things but he told the disciples don't look for that he said your sign is the gospel being preached into all the world and then the end shall come in other words while these things are happening God is seeing about his business God is seeing about his people I want his matter fix then end shall come oh hallelujah hallelujah say Amen somebody oh Hallelujah God is seeing about you this morning huh amen he's not going to leave one no no no no he's a good shepherd this morning he leaves a 99 and he goes after that one that one that's C in the thicket that one that's in the bush he'll go after them he hear them bleaching in the corner he knows where they are this morning he's got to find you he's got to get you you are the expression of his heart how can he forget you this morning he loves you 24/7 oh Hallelujah 365 days a year God loves you oh Hallelujah God is not feeling your love feel your love is is subjective to the other person loving you back isn't that right it has to be that kind of a way it's a human love but God's love is without condition he loves you regardless of what regardless of your condition you don't even have to love him back but he love you oh Hallelujah he died for you he died for the whole world oh Hal that right his blood covers the whole world going round and round like that and every sin is being bumped back off by that blood isn't that right that's what brother Bram saw in the vision he's about to condemn that lady in the bar God turned him around and showed him a different picture yeah see he was looking at the picture through his his lens through his glasses isn't that right God drop a blood lens in front of him and begin to see something different he begin to see a vision of what Calvary was and what it really means and what it was meant to show isn't that right then he turned around come back to the lady and begin to testify to her and tell her of what he was thinking and that testimony brought Deliverance to her because she was a Christian and something in her awakened she knew about the love of God but she'd got so far away from it that that maybe she felt that she couldn't go back but here was this Prophet telling her of an experience and all all of a sudden that call that was in our heart long time ago all of a sudden reemerged all of a sudden it came back all of a sudden it resurrected isn't that right and dark there in the B room he was able to save Souls by his testimony by his experience isn't that right of the power of the love of God oh Hal that's what the power of God's love does oh Hallelujah isn't that right is that love that's going to go out and it's going to call your families it's going to call your loved ones it's going to call your neighbors come come and rejoice with us we have found something it is the love of God it is forgiveness it is brotherly kindness oh Hallelujah that's what it is amen oh Hallelujah still in my intro so if we claim to be the children of God if we claim to be the children of the light then we have to stand for righteousness we have to stand for Holiness isn't that right amen if you claim to believe a certain thing then you have to stand for it otherwise what you're saying and what you're doing and become two different things you see and then it becomes do as I say and other as I do isn't that right but no that's not the way God operates isn't that right your actions have to line up with the word of God your thoughts speak louder in heaven than they do in words God is hearing what you are thinking oh Hallelujah H more than what you just shout in church or what you just tell a brother God bless you and you shake hands and so on that's fine that's wonderful but God is seeing deeper than that God is seeing the desires of your heart oh how he doesn't look on the out of the appearance that's why he could anoint David in the midst of his Brethren because he is not looking at who you are now he is looking at what you could become he is looking at the potentials that is laying inside of you that if you could just give a little then he could give of himself and the more you give out is the more he come in and the more you give out is the more he come in oh hallelujah amen for message called words called for total separation from unbelief amen and I have a a huge chunk of inspiration from here but I'll just read this here he said now now when he said that the Earth uh that God was going to use the Earth right he said and it was in total darkness is that right the spirit of God spoke out and he said let there be light and he separated the light from the darkness he said and it's been doing that ever since separating light from Darkness isn't that right there was the earth laying in chaos us up was down down was up you couldn't tell left from right here from there and all of a sudden God begin to bring order to the picture amen because that's what God is God is a god of order he's a god of planning and he's a god of organization he he likes to put things in a certain perspective according to the way he see it fit not man's organization now God's organization that's different amen amen hallelujah hallelujah so when he come he give it to speak let there be light then he separated the light from the darkness and he called a light day that he called The Darkness night and that was the first day isn't that right in the Bible praise God hallelujah and he's been doing that ever since Hallelujah separating light from Darkness because they can have no communion they could really have no Fellowship light is light and darkness is Darkness oh hallelujah hallelujah isn't that right said God's word also separated the water from the land in the beginning isn't that right so it was a constant separation going on he separated the fillment of the Heaven from the fillment of the earth and so on isn't that right God spoke and the water was separated from the land and he had a reason for that isn't that right the prophet says God never speaks a word unless he's got a reason for speaking that word right he said he's not like you and I that that we just especially myself he says that speak so many foolish things he said God speaks every word with a meaning and something that he's trying to achieve and will achieve it by his word and it will perform exactly what he said it will do he said and now if God said let there be light and there was no light then then it wasn't God that said that see but when God says anything he must back up what he says and when the word of God has been Vindicated the word has been Vindicated he said that is light and God backs up what he says so if if he says you are going to be delivered God backs up what he says if he says he's going to fill you with the Holy Ghost God backs up what he says if he said healing is a children's bread then God backs up what he says oh hallelujah hallelujah [Applause] hallelujah amen amen God anything he must back it up isn't that right Hallelujah he said now the word itself isn't light until it's a Vindicated light see so it was spoken but it wasn't Vindicated yet the light had not yet come the manifestation that Vindication is what makes that word real living and present tense that's what manifest it as light that's right isn't that right so it's a word until it come to a manifestation so you can't just be happy with word you got to want a manifestation oh come on now God said I give you the land but you've got to want to take it oh we're pressing into something now I feel something dropping down God told Joshua this border and that border and this border and that border and it's okay I'm sure you could put that up on Facebook and say God told me that this is my land you could broadcast it to the media and tell everybody that this is my land but unless you go and take it for yourself you have nothing to get because that's still a word until become manifested and God is not satisfied with just a word but he wants to see a manifestation of that word in your life oh Hal isn't that right or else it just remains a word calls and texts is that right oh my see okay where was I he must back at what he says right okay um so if God said let there be light and there was no light then it wasn't the word of God this it wasn't the word of God but when light sprung up upon sprung upon the Earth that showed the word was Vindicated and it was light he said and now today if God's made a promise and when that promise is Vindicated then that is light that is the light of the day when the word is Vindicated the word for the hour is a Vindicated oh so when the word of the hour is Vindicated in us when this seven tunder manifestation come upon the bride then we will become the light of the world to this generation then we will be the light for the hour then there shall be light in the evening time when cross Darkness cover the Earth cross Darkness cover the people but there's promised to be a glorious bride without spots without wrinkle washing the blood of the Lamb portraying the light to the world Amen oh amen isn't that right amen hallelujah amen okay I'll read it quickly from his INF feeling words a promise amen but the B says faith is by hearing the word of God the Word of Promise isn't that right he said if you don't have a promise he said then you venture out upon your own fate but if you take a promise of God that's God's promise to you he said the woman that touched His Garment she had no promise of that isn't that right he said but her fith without a promise got her healing isn't that right the Bible says she told herself if I could just touch she ventured out upon her own fate she didn't have a scripture to show what she was doing but she just had a desire and that little fate like a mustard seed did so much that she pressed her away she pressed past this one she pressed past that one and she got her blessing isn't that right without a promise isn't that right Joshua didn't have a scripture didn't have a Bible he could open to say son stand still he didn't have a promise for that but he spoke to the son because he had a need he spoke to the Moon he said Moon hang over the aelon valley I've got to finish this I can't let the enemy get the one upon on me I've got to get the one upon them and if God be with me then I shall be able and they drove into the battle he spoke the word and started chopping and slicing and guess what the sun Stood Still without a promise oh this morning if Joshua can get his Blessing without a promise if that woman can get her blessing without a promise then what about you this morning God has seven promises for you this morning Faith virtue knowledge Temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness a Sevenfold manifestation promise for you this morning how can it fail it cannot fail that's God's promise word to you it's got to be fulfilled I don't care what condition your wife is in I don't care what condition your son is in what your condition your home is in God spoke it it's got to happen it's got to materialize it's God's promise and God backs up what he [Music] says hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah he promised it he promised it he promised you the Holy Ghost he promised you Victory you are not always going to feel like this no no no there's going to come a Sunday when the fibers of your being will be enclosed with light and power you are going to walk with a witness the Bible said is that right the angel of the Lord went everywhere with them confirming the world with signs with wonders with Miracles God is going before us this morning who can stand against us there's not a demon in this realm or world to come that can stand before the bride of Christ this [Applause] morning oh Give the Lord a shout of Praise amen amen you're not always going to be defeated no don't accept that don't believe that because that's not the word of God there's no scripture in here that says I'm always going to be depressed there's no scripture in here that says I'm always going to be frustrated there's no scripture in here that says I'm always going to be down and out God told Joshua every place the soul of your foot shall tread upon is yours if you put your foot on it it's yours so put your foot on something this morning come on now try God and see if he's real or not try God and challenge you to try God hallelujah hallelujah if God is big enough to make a promise he's big enough to keep it if he's big enough to speak it he's big enough to make it happen this is better than Republic Bank they got make it happen loans God's bigger than that God making it happen all the time God made it happen for Abraham he made it happen for Moses he made it happen for Joshua and he's going to make it happen for you say Amen somebody hallelujah praise God oh I feel Faith in the building believe God

[Applause] hallelujah come on this is God we're talking about this is God we're talking about this is not some man a politician can make promises they're Liars whole bunch of them but God he changes not if he spoke it it's got to happen if he said it's got to take place and he promised us a Revival and we are going to have it let's make ready for it because it is [Applause] [Music] coming yeah amen amen amen oh Hallelujah there's somebody going across Jordan you know there's somebody going to return in power there's somebody going to come down from the mountain humble lowly it'll be Christ in there speaking the word of God rainbows flashing somebody's going to cross over Hallelujah somebody I can't tell you who it is cuz I'm not God but I know somebody is going to Cross Jordan because God spoke it [Applause] hallelujah oh amen okay so let me get back to this here now H but Abram said now if she could get her healing by faith what about a promise without a promise and what she was doing how much more ought we to get our healing by faith in a promise that God is manifesting and vindicating before us and brought it Down To Us by his word come around and confirmed his word oh isn't that right from the quote here the world once again uh the world is again falling apart he said we're like Abraham we receive the word and anything was contrary to the word he called it as if it wasn't and any true born child of God receive God's word he says and I don't care what anybody B buny but he says I don't care what anybody says what system speaks against the word he said the word is true anyhow and he said God he this part is obligated to meet you on the basis of them promises outside of them promises he can't meet you because you done cut yourself off from him brother I come too far to cut my own self off I'm going to believe every promise every promise if he spoke it if the prophet said it I believe it and that settles it oh Hallelujah hen amen do you believe that this morning amen 2 Corinthians 6 Bible says be not equally yolked together with unbelievers for what Fellowship had righteousness with unrighteousness and what communion had light with Darkness isn't that right and what Concord hath Christ with bah or what part hath he that believeth with an Infidel and what agreement had the temple of God with Idols isn't that right a separation Hallelujah God is God the world is the world we didn't leave the world to come in Christ to find the world no we leave the world to come in Christ to find God isn't that right we leave the world and all its things and all its cares and all its images and all that it has to offer us to come into something that God has in store for us a higher wisdom a higher purpose a higher knowledge David said knowledge so high for me I cannot attain unto it oh take God to break it to you if any man lack wisdom let him ask God and only God could give you wisdom only God can give you Revelation and when God give you Revelation the Gates of Hell could never Prevail against it they might rock it they might shake it but they can't Prevail against a man or woman who has revelation from God Revelation is prevailing power hallelujah praise God Amen oh hallelujah amen [Applause] am so pray for Revelation cuz no matter how hard you study no matter how much you read takes God to show you something in the word it takes God to pour Revelation on the pastor or on the ministers to show you something that that that that only God could open to you isn't that right hallelujah amen yet still take God to break upon you and to open the word to you as an individual so that you could see your promises because you are the prize ladies and gentlemen you are God's trophy you are what he is coming back for God not coming back for this

sudden a nice big car pulls up food clothes that person is some family member some father some Aunt somebody who cares and was well enough to to give it to them God put it up how to do that to give to give to somebody who didn't have anything isn't that right takes a consciousness of God to bring that to your reality to make you do that God put that upon their heart as a family member they felt the need to go and find this homeless person this stranger this person who cut herself off from society and maybe they call their crazy or maybe they got on drugs or there's different situations but but but but there's always some family member there's always somebody that's reaching out to them God put that upon their heart that they wouldn't see them go hungry that they wouldn't see them go clothesless or or or without shelter or food and if God could put that upon a natural man how much more God the Father having children out there out there in the darkness out there in the grime of the

all we can preach to you there a promises God has in store for you but you've got to take it you've got to want to go in there you got to want to be a part of that move come on now otherwise it's just

that right show me to your leader no not Jesus not Jesus said I come to bring a sword I come to chop slice praise God anything that is not of God one time he told a man Let the dead bury the dead but come follow me isn't that right he that eat my flesh and drink my blood has no part with me in this Kingdom but if you're willing to make the extra mile if you're willing to go the distance God can have something for you amen he could blow your mind there's things that God could do for you that you are yet to understand you can't even wrap your mind around that this morning don't even try eyes have not seen ears have not heard what's recorded in God's word what God has in store oh hallelujah hallelujah Hal for his chosen ones this [Applause] morning oh Hallelujah isn't that right Hallelujah isn't that right it's like that Rich Young Ruler come towards Jesus said Rabbi Rabbi what shall I do Great Master what shall I do to be inherit in life and so on Jesus said call me good master I'm not that but but you know you could obey the Commandments do the right thing pay your tithes come to church early you know do all the nice things say Amen say hallelujah shake hands in the church and you'll be fine young man said I've been doing all that since my youth what am I lacking and you see that question that question is what turned the key for Jesus because he was along down the the the normal theological path amen of of what a preacher would tell somebody else and I'm sure that young man went to other people and asked them the same thing isn't that right I'm sure he went to Pharisees there were Sadducees in those times there were the sex of the scribes they knew the scripture inside out he could probably ask them what what shall I do to inherit eternal life and maybe they W able to WR the same thing so he wasn't satisfied with that answer because they were all telling him the same thing and here was Jesus saying the same thing but but he knew there was something special about this man he knew there was something special about this this Jesus of Nazareth so so he he prodded a little further he said I do all these things already but but what am I lacking and the Bible said when he said that he said right there at that moment Jesus loved him and down come the love of God and saw what was in his heart and saw what he needed to give up and saw what he needed to separate himself from come on now and he said listen listen you have a spirit upon you you're doing all the right things but there's one thing that you're lacking he said you need to go and and and sell go and sell all that you have go and give up your worldly Treasures go and give up your worldly Associates go and give up your worly come on now hallah excuse me go and give up all that you're accustomed to go and leave everything that you're normal with and you're fine with give up the big screen TV give up the cars give up the houses give up the cell phone give it up give it up give up everything that you love so daily and that your hold so close to you and follow me and he couldn't do it he was grieved and went away grieving because he couldn't come to the fullness of what God was Qui of him he couldn't pick up his cross and follow after Jesus he couldn't walk in those steps not everybody can do that friends but thank God for the grace that he has given you and me that we could come to the knowledge of the truth that we could walk in Christ's bloody Footprints oh hallelujah hallelujah only the bride could walk in those Footprints oh Hal only the bride is worthy of those Footprints oh she be walking holy holy unto the Lord down to the resurrection uh down to the uh uh to the cross cross and then to the Rapture isn't that right oh my Hallelujah isn't that right so here we find in Genesis and we read the scripture here talking about Abraham's separation from lot isn't that right amen and I just love this story I read it over and over how Abraham had left his Kindred God spoke to Abraham isn't that right let me go back here maybe I could finally just pick it up real quick you love him this morning you got some time all right well praise God Amen what if you say so uh amen now the Lord said unto Abraham this is Gen Genesis 121 says the Lord now the Lord said unto Abraham get thee out of thy country and from thy Kindred and from thy Father's House unto a land

everybody and pick up your things and leave get out of here go go to a land that I'm going to show you isn't that right and as Christians we leave where we are our comfort zone we leave what we accustomed to Peter was accustomed with the fishing business but when the call of God come upon Peter heart he had to leave that behind and follow after Jesus isn't that right oh Hallelujah Elisha was busy plowing the fields and he was accustomed doing that he was that was his ordinary life but God was calling him to something higher he felt the anointing from Elijah's Mantle and he had to leave that and follow after this man who had an anointing he liked that anointing he wanted that anointing but in order to get it he couldn't stay where he was and get the same old say and get that blessing no no no no he couldn't stay where he was and get that mantle blessing no he had to follow he had to go he had to follow where that man was and in order to follow he had to leave come on now and in order to follow Christ we have to leave the world the world behind us and the cross before us that's the pledge that we take that's the commission that we take as Christians not as message Believers come on now not as church members but as Christians to follow after Jesus Christ where he rose he rose where he die we die where he goes we goes and where he lead we follow oh Hal hallelujah hallelujah [Applause] hallelujah get thee out of thy country get out in other words leave pack your things pack your bags whatever you need for the journey but get out because I'm going to show you

towards another glorious Church make a step towards a Revival make a step towards a prayer life come on now make a step towards Holiness make a step towards Purity make a step towards sanctification make a step praise God all it starts is with one step if you're willing to make that step this morning I encourage you do it do it quickly we don't have all the time in the world you're only given so much time to do what you have to do to fulfill your purpose here on Earth amen and save for the rapture we all have an expiry date over our heads we don't know when our time will be what what what day that's a reality I was faced with that reality two weeks ago I'm still under the pressures of it it's a reality friends it's a death there's death hanging over isn't that right from time man's born but soon as man God man broke God's word in the Garden of Eden isn't that right from since that time death hangs over every man's life and every life is required before God you have to give an account for what you do in this body that's right for the Deeds that you do in this body you have to give an account the Bible says I saw the the sea give up the dead but great and small all the books were open and every man from Adam go all the way down was judged for the things that were in those books there's a book this morning recording your attitude there's a book this morning recording what you are doing in this service in this life in your home in your family it's recording your attitude it's recording the way you come it's recording your approach to God it's recording it don't take God for granted God will not be mocked on the day of judgment you have to answer for the deed you do in this party oh Hallelujah Hal I want to give a good report I want to say I've done run the race I finished my course I want to say there's a treasure laid up for me somewhere out y [Applause] hallelujah it's not easy friends you're called out and you have to leave what you're accustomed to to go into a place you don't know this was Abraham's story but the part I love about this was that Abraham was a father of Nations isn't that right he represented everything that God was about to do down Through the Ages isn't that right he represent the the the the seed of that the the the the the first fruit of that he represented the first one that was to step out and and and the father of Faith isn't that right this first great patriarch he represented prophets that were to come he represented kings that were to be raised up he represented Nations that were to be brought out by the hand of God he represented prophets and holy men he represented priests he represented David he represented Moses he represented all these prophets of old in him was Samuel in him was all these great prophets out of his loins were to come for these Great Men of God come on now Hallelujah and if he hadn't steep out and done what God told him to do it'll be a different Bible that's right isn't that right because this is the Book of Genesis what would Exodus be what would judge judges be it'd be a mess but he stepped out anyway because in him represented all those Souls that would have come forth and this morning you might think much of yourself but you sitting here in these pews represent people that are yet to hear this gospel you represent people that are yet to come into this church you represent people that before the darkness spreads they are going to come to the gospel by your life by your signs and wonders by your manifestation of Jesus Christ life they're going to come oh Hallelujah Hall that changes the picture huh changes how you see church now you're not coming because well I'm tired but I got to make it you know got to pay my ties today so I came changes the picture now now now now we begin to realize that that there's more to you there's more to your life there's more there's more that what God want to fulfill that you are representing a great move of God because it took 120 to bring 3,000 and those 3,000 brought more and brought more why why the gospel begin to spread because God had a nucleus that he could work with God had a group that he could use God had a group that he could move with oh hallelujah hallelujah to spread the gospel the good news amen amen isn't that right this ought to separate you from all the material things because that means nothing what about the souls of your children what about the souls of your family what about the souls of people who are yet to understand the love of God they might be able to read a tract or a Bible or a spoken word book but your life is going to bring them in your life have to become so salty your life have to become so full of God's love and mercy that they want to come that they feel the need to ask you something about Jesus because they seeing it they're seeing it you're Hallelujah gold tried and fire standing before them as a witness to this Dying World that there is a Jesus out there somewhere and he's standing on two feet he's Healing The Sick raising the dead Hallelujah that's the Jesus I want to see one that walked in Galilee the one that healed the leper the one that spoke amen hallelujah and there it was that's the Jesus I want to see this hour that's a Jesus we need in this hour the darkness is coming and end the end is coming but God promised oh Hall that group that their hearts would turn back to the original fate and we are that group this morning because we heard the call of this Malachi four Prophet that was sent to turn our hearts back to the faith of the fathers oh Hallelujah to go back to the faith that Paul preached to go back to the fate of that Ephesians church we have to go back there to pick up what they had and reproduce Christ again in the natural praise [Applause] God [Music] hallelujah my God that's the call of a Christian Life come out into a land that I will show you Abraham never been there before Abraham never seen it before you're 75 years old I think when he left home decided to go out and follow the word of the Lord yes he didn't have a map he didn't have a guy he didn't have a guy dog he didn't have anything he went out and he followed the word of the Lord and that's what we're asked to do as Christians we are here to follow the word of the Lord we're not here to follow a man we are here to follow the pillar of fire wherever he leads we follow we here to follow his word his word only isn't that right when that pillar fire dropped down and they were leading the children of Israel out of Egypt down to Moses had to subject himself to the leading of the pillar of fire Moses himself couldn't say well I feel to go this way no it wasn't up to Moses it was up to the fire it was a fire that led them down to the Sea the Red Sea because he wanted to prove himself before Moses and for all the people and before Pharaoh that God was the god of Israel H to show how Mighty he was to show how powerful he was he led them down to a situation where they seem that they can't make it where they seem that there was nothing else where there was no more answer but the eyes of the Lord look through the pillar of fire and was angry at the Red [Applause] Sea Hallelujah so that's what we're following this morning the spirit of God the supernatural not the natural flesh is flesh but spirit is Spirit that's what God told Nicodemus isn't uh Jesus told Nicodemus isn't that right said you must be born again amen or else you cannot even see the kingdom of God that which is of the flesh is of the flesh but that which is of the spirit is of the Spirit light is light and darkness is Darkness it's two different things it's two different worlds we are leaving this world to go into another one you cannot go into that other world in an imperfect State you've got to come to Perfection to get to that world of perfection because in that world is perfection you can't go into a perfect world with an imperfect State you have to become perfect that's what the Rapture is for to changes Mortals into immortality to change this corruptible into incorruption that we can be changing the body in the moment in the twinkling of an eye and go up to meet our savior isn't that right was a god of perfection then he became imperfection to die for our sins isn't that right Hallelujah that we could become Perfection the god of perfection died isn't that right uh on the cross isn't that right and took all sins the sinless one became sin took on our sins bore our faults bore our failures bore our mistakes bore our situations isn't that right bore everything praise God hallelujah you was to be on that cross but he died for you he paid the price for you you he took on your sin oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah he paid the price so that you could become like he was sinless holy righteous without blemish wash white as snow that's the purpose of the Gospel that's the purpose that he died for oh Hallelujah hallelu no wonderers Prophet cried out he said Lord let these things live in me let these seven Thunders live in me oh lord is my prayer because that's the purpose he died for he said let Faith live in me let virtue live in me let knowledge live in me oh hallelujah hallelujah isn't that right God wants you to live for him he died for you so that you could live for him oh isn't that right my God let me get on Amen trying to keep this in the time here but uh even though Abraham came out of his household and so on and began walking he still had lot with him isn't that right he still had lot tagging along now lot could have chose his own Road a long time ago because he had his own household he had his own thing was going on he had his own Hersman his own cattle and even though we come out even though we come out to follow Jesus sometimes there are some things that still hanging on to us there's some things that still they were not yet willing to let go of yet just yet because just in case this Christianity thing don't work out I got something I could fall back on isn't that right sometimes that's the way we do because we not fully yet to trust him in all things we're not ready yet to put everything in his hand and say Lord you take it and not take it back say Lord I know I I know I know I give you the finances there but I just need just need a little bit from it no no give it all to God give it all to him and see what he does with it Hallelujah see how he could take it and use it see how he could provide for you Jesus said consider the birds consider the bees they don't they don't worry about what's going to happen tomorrow they trust in the Lord they they everything is there for them God provides for them Jesus said seek ye first the kingdom of God and all other things shall be added unto you don't worry about tomorrow don't worry about what this going to happen or if that's going to happen don't worry about the floods David said if 10,000 fall on my right side and a thousand on my left I shall not be moved because the Lord is my keeper the Lord is my shade upon my right hand and the sun shall not Smite be thy day the moon shall not smite me by night but he shall preserve my soul he shall preserve me from all evil that's the God we serve the god is able to preserve you to preserve the children of Israel were walking out in the wilderness and their shoes never wore down their clothes never wore down that's crazy they were 40 years in the wilderness but God was keeping the very clothes on their back and the Very shoes on their feet and and if God can keep shoes if God can keep clothes then what about you this morning God is able to keep you I I say he is more than able to keep you this morning to teach your fingers to fight and to keep your feet from falling hallelujah oh my lot was hanging around I think it was his nephew was his brother's son they were good I guess they had a nice relationship all that started to get messed up when the blessings start to fall blessings is do some strange things to human beings true you see it all through the years soon as God bless a man get all puffed up feel like he's got it all he could move he could do what he want say what he want you don't need God no more you got blessings you know I guess that was lot's state after a while because he didn't understand where these blessings were coming from cuz he God wasn't speaking to lot he talking to Abraham he said Abraham come out I bless thee I'll multiply thee as a sign of the seashore isn't that right it was God speaking to Abraham but those blessings were falling upon lot and upon the herdsmen and he was in the right place at the right time I guess isn't that right they had water when they needed they had food when they needed they had gold they had silver they had flux everything was going fine but but there was Strife between them there was war between them there was enity between them there was there was all kinds of situations come up fighting for little foolishness all of a sudden a fight Breakout Abraham and lot of go there and separate them say no no wait wait Abraham said listen this cannot continue that's right it can amen I prefer you go anywhere you want to go and I will go anywhere I want to go but please in the name of Peace don't let us fight that was Abraham's plead with lot isn't that right and his herds men so it come down to a time where all these natural attachments all these natural things that Abraham was connected to after a while he had to give it all up that's right God began to bring situations to show Abraham that God was getting ready to bless him but there was something he had to do first before he could F fully be blessed and this morning I can't help but feel that there's some things that you've got to do before you could really get the blessing that you're looking for you see Abraham was walking in God's permissive will and allowing him to be blessed and to have cattle and to so on but that wasn't the purpose that God brought him out of his father's house for God brought him out of his father's house to bring him into a land where he will show him where he was to multiply and replenish like Abraham was to do in uh like Adam was to do in the beginning when the fall of Eden took place isn't that right here was God now trying to reestablish his kingdom on the earth through men and through the Mortal Seed of Abraham isn't that right called him out separated him from his father and mother and so forth Hallelujah it was God trying to reestablish his kingdom on the earth among a people on the earth a separated people he was trying to establish a royal priesthood a holy nation A peculiar people A peculiar treasure he wanted something that was different from what was out there God knew all the kings of the earth God knew Sodom God knew gomorra and their wickedness and their foolishness but God is getting ready in the middle of their foolishness in the middle of their evil isn't that right God was establishing a new kingdom God is establishing a new people and I can't help but feel that that's what God is doing in this hour in the middle of Sodom in the middle of gomorra while all the evil is taking place and while all the kings of the Earth are enjoying their riches and enjoying their wisdom God is getting ready to establish his people on the Earth a royal priesthood a holy nation A peculiar people a called out people a separated people hallelujah so you can't really serve god with your whole heart because if cuz you still have some Desires in there you're not yet really to give up there's still some secret stuff that you're hiding like a backup plan you know just go back to this if this doesn't work out you know I'll just serve God at 99% see that's the way some people think but but God wants your whole heart see if if you've got a vessel and there's stuff in it God really can't fill the vessel until you empty it out get all that stuff out of there and then God could fill it with all of himself then God could put all of himself into it isn't that right God wants to bless you more than you are willing to be blessed more than you could understand it isn't that right there was once a woman in the Bible when Elisha had crossed Jordan and the the power of God was visible in his ministry one of the early records of what he began to do in the Bible there was this woman who had a pot of oil and she had some Sons there and she was in debt she was in need she owed some money or something like that I don't know but she was running out of money and all she had was a pot of oil and she came before Elisha and she said Elisha your servant you know your servant Hallelujah is gone I think one of her husband was a prophet or something like that and she was in a condition she had a need and she said Lord what shall I do and and and and Elisha looked at her and here come the Z and drop down and Elisha begin to minister to her and tell her listen listen take that pot of oil what do you have in the house what do you have that you could give she said all I have is a is a pot of oil all I have in my whole household left she said I've sold everything but all I've got left is a pot of oil he said bring that pot of oil what do you have this morning is it a pot of oil you could bring it before the Lord this morning it might be something small but but he could use it this morning he could transform it this morning he could multiply it this morning he could do anything this morning he's a god that is able to provide every need amen he said bring it bring it bring the pot of oil and she brought it before him waiting for hear what he would say he said listen go out into the streets he said go out into the neighborhood he said and ask of them for some vessels to borrow he said but listen this was a most this is a key part of it borrow not a few in other words don't limit your blessing get anything that you could get go get it go find it oh hallelujah hallelujah what a situation here was she and and her sons I sure they had some neighbors that they weren't accustomed talking to but she had to knock on some doors that morning I sure there were some people she wasn't accustomed saying hello to but she had to Humble herself a little bit cuz she was in a situation and she needed a helping hand so she went out and began to ask people for some PO for some pots of oil isn't that some pots I need some pots to get some oil to to to to get to feed my family and she began to ask she going to ask around can you do you have anything that you could give and I'm sure the neighbors had stuff in it I'm sure they were using it for plants I'm sure they were using it for flowers but when they got it they had to throw it out they had to throw out all the trash throw out everything that was in those old pots and get those pots ready because God was fixing to do something and I challenge you this morning if you could just get some things out of your life this morning if you could just get some things ready if you could just get everything cleared out clear out the space in Your Heart Take the junk out take the trash out take everything of the world take all the old stuff take all the old Styles take all the old Fashions and get with God and clear your life out and make some room for Jehovah make some room for the king of kings make some space for the one who created heaven and earth I believe God is able this morning to provide all of your needs to do something in your life hallelujah hallelujah amen GL GL GL amen amen amen isn't that [Music] right separate yourself yes lot Abraham told lot said separate ourself from me cuz that's it we can go no further on this journey until we get some stuff cleared up amen and I feel this morning that you can go no further on this journey until you get some stuff cleared up yes till you get some stuff fixed because until you fix that God can't really speak to you the way he wants to speak to you amen he's speaking to you yes yes but but not in the fullness of it not not the way he really wants to communicate with you because you got some other channels on got to turn that stuff off you got some other things that are in your ears you got some other things that are in your heart that you got to pull out that you've got to seek the Lord while he may be found this morning hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah you wouldn't have all the time in the world oh H isn't that right and this message come down to individuals now it's individuals are going to cross over you look to the left and you look to the right and you see a church this morning but when you get to that Rapture it won't be a church there it'll be individuals who took their stand it'll be individuals who applied the token it'll be individuals Hallelujah isn't that right [Music] Hallelujah God's word always calls for total separation from unbelief um I'll read from here he says Jesus had has constantly told us that there is a separation and we find that the last thing that's predicted okay to to the human race before uh the great final day uh when we Ascend into the presence of God there will be a final separation he will separate the sheep from the goats God will continue has been separating separating and that's what he's doing tonight that's what he always does he can you can see it in every meeting he separates Faith from unbelief he speaks out he declares himself to those who will believe him and have faith in him he said and I believe tonight that every man and woman every boy and girl that's born of the spirit of God is a Nazarite unto the Lord because they have separated them things themselves from the cares of the world and whatever the world has got to say amen amen amen amen isn't that right Hallelujah he said you live in a city here okay where there's great schools and so forth he said and we see our nation calling for higher standard of Education which is all right he said nothing to say about that but that education cannot give you salvation he said a scientist can split a grain of wheat and tell you how many different chemicals is in it but it can't find the life that's in there and education can learn you or teach you mathematics and they can teach you history and whatever more but they cannot bring light to you your education will not do that amen Co give me a bit of trouble here amen amen says God has one way of bringing light to you that's when you're ready to separate yourself from all of the things of the world and all of the cares of the world and cling only to God's promised word isn't that right he said Paul was a Nazarite unto the Lord he was separated from his Orthodox Church to the word of the Living God oh that's the reason he could be so sold out that's the reason he could preach the way he preached why because Paul was separated unto God isn't that right he said Aaron was a Nazarite unto the Lord he was separated from among the Brethren to Bear the birth stones and to be the high priest oh Hallelujah so he couldn't hang around and mingle with people like he wanted to because he was set apart from the rest of them he was Paul to be a holy man to go into the holies of holies he had a special role to play isn't that right said it was a total separation we not to go back to the world no more or have anything to do with the world but cleave un only unto God Jesus is coming after a bride a woman a church that's separated from the things of the world or the cares of the world she is separated from the Fashions of this Modern Age that we live in she's separated from the cares and the tradition itions of the churches she's separated only to God and God is the word and as a husband and wife is one so does the bride and the word become one for the word is living through the bride that's how he said that's her credentials he said that's her identification her identification will be with her Lord it will be with the word oh Hallelujah if anybody ask who I am tell them I am been redeemed Washed by the blood of the Lamb identified by the word of God oh H that should be your identification card not what church you belong to not what group you belong to not your church membership not where you pay ties oh Hallelujah isn't that right but are you separated unto God is he your all in all is he your everything is he the reason why you're living is he the reason why you come to church this morning oh Hallelujah let a man examine himself amen said she separated from the cares of the traditions of the churches oh my it's big she separated only to God and God is the word and as a husband and wife is one so the bride and the word become one for the word is living through the bride amen isn't that right okay let me skip down here now he says if I could pull out a PhD or lld and show you my credentials from a certain organization or for some school then that school would recognize that credential he said but the only credential a Believer has is the word of God living in him declaring Jesus Christ lives in that person isn't that right he said that's a separate Nazarite unto the Lord separated for the word's sake the Bible said the word is sharper than a two-edged sword cut into the asunder and the marrow of the bur of the bone and deser the thoughts that's in the heart that's the reason Jesus could look upon the people and perceive what they were thinking he was the word isn't that right Hallelujah separated unto God for the word's sake not you separating his own self now now don't get me get don't get it twisted now I'm not saying go up to your brother today and say hey I'm going to separate from you no that's not what we're talking about amen amen don't cut people off and we're not we're not preaching that this morning we talking about the things of the world isn't that right Hallelujah yeah sure you have love for your brother sure you want to pray for one another but separate yourself from things of the world from worldly associations from anything that would endanger your Christian Life anything that would endanger you praise God hallelujah anything that would get you away from the kingdom anything that would get you away from God's principle from God's desire from God's motive from God's objective for God's purpose being fulfilled in your life separate yourself amen from those things but pray for your brother pray for your sister amen pray that we all make it into that Kingdom isn't that right but by one Spirit we're baptized into that Kingdom and everyone's got to search their own salvation out in fear and trembling amen isn't that right Jesus said I see I take one and I leave one one will be taken and one will be left every man's got to search his or her own heart out her own salvation I can't do it for you I wish I could but I can't that's on you this morning it's on you if you want to be saved it's on you if you want to repent it's on you if you want to give your life to the lord it's on you if you want to make things right it's on you if you want to rededicate your life to the Lord that is totally up to you God not holding no gun to nobody head and forcing them to love him he that loveth me keepeth my Commandments and it is he that loveth me and he shall be loved of the father and I'm going to come to him Jesus said I'll manifest myself to him but it's he that loveth me oh Hal it's up to you this morning oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah it's not a begging contest GL Hallelujah God's not begging and dragging people into this Kingdom it's either you want it or you don't want it oh Hallelujah but God put a desire in our hearts this morning A Cry of the spirit to get into what he has in store for us isn't that right Romans 8 uh says there there therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit isn't that right flesh is flesh but spirit is Spirit I'm closing out Jesus makes a clear differentiation between the two isn't that right that which is flesh is flesh and that which of the spirit is Spirit he said Marvel not that I say unto thee you must be born again it's not a natural birth it's a spiritual birth what made them natural Jews isn't that right was a natural circumcision but our sign of circumcision today is a holy spirit it's a supernatural thing that takes place that's what makes us spiritual Jews oh Hallelujah isn't that right you've got to want that and it's a circumcision it's a cutting off of the excess flesh it's a cutting off of the things of the world it's a cutting off of those things that are hanging on to you are those things that you are holding on to that you are putting your trust in the Bible says don't put your trust in men don't put your trust in princes where there is no help but our help comes from God that's where you got to put your trust because when the world begin to fall apart when the world which is already falling apart when things begin to happen your trust can't be in your job one day there'll be no more job there your trust can't be in your car or your house one day there'll be no more house there there there be no more car there the only thing that you'll be able to put your trust in is in the Lord your God oh Hallelujah I'm getting ready to close musician can come amen for to be cly minded is death but to be spiritually minded is life and peace amen last quote and now finish God's word call for total separation he said but when a man is born in the world for a Believer he becomes a Nazarite when he separates himself uh he becomes a Nazarite watch when he separates himself from anything that's contrary to the word a total separation Jesus said I come to separate a man from his wife tear up a family that sounds harsh but it's the word he said and that won't take uh and he he that won't take up his cross and follow me is not worthy to be called mine a separation from everything anything from church from a community from a belief or from family or anything that would stand between you and believing the entire word of God he said and if your soul won't punctuate every promise for this hour you can start a play something softly with an amen there is something wrong somewhere he said you need a separation Hall oh Hallelujah hallel you need a separation this morning we need to get away from everything everything that is hindering us everything that is keeping us back from our blessing but said last Sunday I think it was he said what if you were really free what if you had nothing holding you back what if you had no chains holding on to you what if you could really do it what would you do would you run the race would you believe with all that you've got would you do all that you could do would you give all that you could give what would you do how would you live your life life how would you live for God and there was one time he also said he said what if you had 30 days left to live what would you do how would you approach life how would you do things How would how would you come to a church how would your attitude be how would you treat your family how would you treat your loved ones how would you treat your neighbors how would you treat the word of God hallelujah hallelujah would you search it out in feir and trembling or would you be casual with it like you are sometimes like we are sometimes we all sin we all fall short of the glory of God but friends God is calling us higher God is calling us to a total separation from all unbelief from everything that is keeping us back from everything that the devil is trying to throw in our Direction the lust of the eyes the lust of the flesh the pride of life we've got to stand that test and in order to stand that test there has to be a separation you can't continue the same way you've been going you can't go on the same way you've been doing it all the while you've got to separate yourself from everything that could be a threat to your Christianity to your to your stand to your testimony the Bible says they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb by the word of their testimony you've got to have something to say about how you overcome how you going to approach Joshua and Caleb and all these Great Men of old who died for the faith who Liv for the faith who who who who who were parent in Peril and died by the edge of the sword as it was why you going to see them face to face and you've got no testimony you've got nothing that you could say that you took a stand for your God in your hour in your season let's all stand and finished so lady that could come Hallelujah friends you've got to want to cross over this morning you've got to want to do all that God has requiring of you because this world is dying this world is coming to end there's nothing left there's nothing left there's nothing that you could put your hope in family values being destroyed men women children the Bible said slay utterly old young doesn't matter who they are slay them utterly but come not n anyone who has the mark God is marking this morning that incor rider was said to go right on first before those slaughtering Angels come to put a mark on those that sigh and that cry for the Abomination that's been done in the city it's a dark hour friends I pray for the young people because it's worse than when I was in school it's worse than when I was walking the street it's worse now it's 10 times worse and it'll get worse amen as the days go on but you've got to be ready friends you've got to bear that Mark that reproach for Christ Hallelujah Hal because if you stand for him then he'll stand for you if you stand on his promise he'll manifest his promise to you he will do something for you maybe this morning hallelujah oh why don't you lift your hands close your eyes I'm finished hallelujah praise God

precious name of Jesus Christ and the church says amen and amen you may be seated for a few announcements amen so this week we have midweek Services as normal Wednesday at 7:30 in Deo Martin and we've been having quite a time uh in Deo Martin last Wednesday we weren't even able to preach because the holy Spirit interrupted the service from the beginning to the end and we under great expectation for what will happen this coming Wednesday so if you are in the west or you want to make the sacrifice to come out we encourage you Wednesday at 7:30 uh this Thursday we have two Services here at the church at 7:30 and in canopia at 7:30 as well and this coming Sunday is a very very important service very more than Sunday rather um in Super Sunday we have two services this coming Sunday at 10:00 a.m. and at 3:00 p.m. brother o and I would be speaking the services and um it's going to be the Lord's supper and it is absolutely critical um that you make every effort to be here and I'm challenging you and I'm pushing you to make sure and call somebody who is not here today and let them know that they need to be in church this coming Sunday in the message let your light so shine before men brother Bram said for I truly think that is the duty of every Christian to take communion the Bible said if you take this not you have no part with me and I believe it is a showdown time for the Christians if we do not take it we have no part with him and if we take it unworthily then we are guilty of the body and death of Christ amen so it gets to a place where it keeps the Christian prayed up when he comes to communion we should come reverently solemnly sacredly walking up confessing all of our wrongs praying one for the other not only that listen carefully but we should feel if there's a brother or sister Among Us that we feel is just a little bit out of line somewhere our hearts ought to be burdened for that person on communion night especially to see them that they'll be able to walk up and take communion not be condemned with the world because they are our brothers and sisters and I read that quote to leave that burden with the church as we go into this week as we prepare for Sunday service to take the opportunity this week as brother Anthony said to separate from the things of the world separate from our worldly desires and really consecrate ourselves for this coming Sunday I I know in my heart God has something special for this coming Sunday and I really desire that all the Christians in the church not the message Believers the Christians in the church who are really serious about God could come prayed up and be identified with the Lord Jesus Christ in the Lord's supper and be under expectation for God to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we could ask or think I want to encourage you as well catch a burden for somebody it's so easy sometimes to look at your own situation your own struggles your own experiences and and focus on yourself but many times when you step out of you and your stuff and look at somebody else and catch a burden for somebody else God begins to deliver you and all of a sudden you feel but wait a minute all I've been looking at was me all this time and now I'm praying for somebody the weight that I was carrying just disappeared and that's really what Christianity is really about it's about living for somebody else because Jesus could have looked at himself but he said not my will but thine be done because he look Beyond his need his pain his situation and so that if he didn't do this we wouldn't be here today can the church say Amen you love the Lord this morning lastly there'll be a short choir practice after church so once again just to recap the announcements Wednesday Deo Martin if you can make it you're encouraged to do so Thursday Two Services uh here at the church and in canopia all midweek services are at 7:30 and this coming Sunday we have Super Sunday two Sundays with the Lord's Supper
