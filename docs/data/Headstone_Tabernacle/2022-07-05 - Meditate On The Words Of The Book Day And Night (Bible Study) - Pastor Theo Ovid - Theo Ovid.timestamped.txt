[15:29] timothy 3 16
[15:31] in joshua 1 8
[15:34] and the 2nd timothy 3 16 says all
[15:37] scripture
[15:38] is given by inspiration of god
[15:40] and is profitable for doctrine for
[15:43] reproof
[15:44] for correction
[15:45] for instruction and righteousness
[15:48] joshua chapter 1 8
[15:51] is a familiar scripture
[15:53] it says this book of the lord
[15:55] shall not depart out of thy mouth
[15:57] but those shall meditate during the
[15:59] night
[16:00] that damian's observed
[16:03] to do
[16:04] according
[16:05] to all
[16:07] that is written therein
[16:09] for then thou shalt make that way
[16:10] prosperous
[16:12] and then thou shalt have good success
[16:14] let me read that chapter part again this
[16:16] book of the law
[16:18] shall not depart out of thy mouth
[16:20] but thou shalt meditate during day and
[16:23] night
[16:23] the dao means observe
[16:26] to do
[16:27] so this book will release the knowledge
[16:30] and i want to use it with accurate
[16:32] knowledge tonight as part of this
[16:33] knowledge
[16:35] based upon what is written dearing
[16:37] and you shall make your way prosperous
[16:39] and you will have good success
[16:42] so this is the uh platform in which
[16:44] we're going to base what we're going to
[16:45] share tonight
[16:46] and i'll have a title meditate on the
[16:48] words of the book
[16:50] day
[16:51] and night meditate
[16:53] on the words of the book
[16:55] dear night
[16:57] i trust this be a special bible study to
[16:59] you
[17:00] that it will inspire you
[17:02] by the scriptures by what has been
[17:04] shared by the thoughts of god
[17:07] that has been expressed by the word
[17:09] we wanted to know bible jeremiah 36 and
[17:12] i discovered this
[17:13] this chapter 36 a very interesting story
[17:16] and i want you to pay close attention
[17:18] i know sometimes we don't get put much
[17:20] into the old testament characters in
[17:22] this way but i want you to look at
[17:24] jeremiah 36 you want to read from verse
[17:26] 1.
[17:27] okay so god bless you jeremiah 36 one
[17:30] and it came to pass in the fortier of
[17:32] joachim the son of josiah king of judah
[17:36] that the word came unto jeremiah from
[17:39] the lord's seeing
[17:40] so this is jeremiah get an instruction
[17:42] from god
[17:44] take thee a roll of a book
[17:47] and write therein
[17:48] all the words that i have spoken unto
[17:51] thee
[17:51] against israel
[17:53] and against judah
[17:55] and against all the nations
[17:57] from the day i speak unto thee from the
[18:00] day
[18:01] of josiah even to this day
[18:04] it may be that the house of judah
[18:07] will hear
[18:09] all the evil
[18:11] which i purpose to do unto them
[18:13] so let's just go back again go should
[18:15] take a book a rule of the book i begin
[18:17] to write write the words
[18:19] and the words that i'm seeing and to use
[18:21] against israel
[18:22] it's against judah it's against all the
[18:25] nations
[18:26] and god is saying
[18:28] that
[18:29] when the host of judah will hear all the
[18:31] evil i purpose to do unto them that they
[18:34] may return every man from his evil way
[18:36] so god is saying i want you to put this
[18:38] judgment call
[18:40] in written form
[18:41] and get it spoken to these people
[18:44] and his objective the objective of god
[18:47] is for these people to return every man
[18:50] from his evil way that i may forgive
[18:52] their iniquity and their sin
[18:54] so it is not that god would just want to
[18:56] judge for judging sake god is even
[18:58] presenting a word
[19:00] a written word
[19:02] in order that they will repent in order
[19:05] that they will turn around let's go to
[19:06] verse 4.
[19:08] then jeremiah called barack
[19:10] the son of niraya
[19:12] and barak wrote
[19:14] from the mount of jeremiah
[19:16] all the words of the lord so barack
[19:18] would have been like described the
[19:19] writer right which he had spoken unto
[19:22] him
[19:23] upon a rule of a book
[19:25] and jeremiah commanded barak saying i am
[19:28] shut up
[19:29] i cannot go into the house of the lord
[19:33] therefore for six go down
[19:36] and read in the role
[19:38] which thou has written from my mouth the
[19:40] words of the lord in the ears of the
[19:43] people
[19:44] in the lord's hopes
[19:46] upon the fasting day and also thou shalt
[19:49] read them in the ears of all judah
[19:52] that come out of the cities nobody we
[19:55] know amos 3 7 surely the lord god will
[19:57] do nothing but reveal the secrets and
[19:59] distribute the prophets so here it is
[20:02] god have to speak to the people this
[20:04] channel is the prophet the prophet at
[20:06] that time was jeremiah jeremiah got the
[20:08] word of the lord he got barak to write
[20:10] all what he had to say from god
[20:13] and he himself under a commandment of
[20:15] god he said i'm shut up i kind of go in
[20:17] the house but you go and read this to
[20:19] the people so therefore
[20:22] it verse
[20:23] it may be they will present their
[20:25] supplication before the lord
[20:28] and will return everyone from his evil
[20:31] way
[20:32] for great is the anger and the fury that
[20:35] the lord has pronounced against his
[20:36] people
[20:37] we see it and barak the son of nirah did
[20:40] according to all the jeremiah the
[20:42] prophet commanded him
[20:43] reading in
[20:45] the book
[20:46] the words of the lord in the lord's
[20:49] house
[20:50] and it came to pass in the fifth year of
[20:52] jehoiakim the son of jose king of judah
[20:54] in the ninth month that they proclaim a
[20:56] fast before the lord to all the people
[20:58] in jerusalem and to all the people that
[21:00] came from the cities of judah unto
[21:02] jerusalem
[21:04] then
[21:05] read barack
[21:07] in the book the words of jeremiah in the
[21:10] house of the lord
[21:11] in the chamber of jeremiah
[21:14] the son of shaphan described
[21:16] in the higher court at the entry of the
[21:18] new gate of the lord's house in the ears
[21:20] of all the people
[21:22] when maita the son of jamar
[21:25] the son of chapan had heard out of the
[21:28] book
[21:29] all the words of the lord
[21:31] then
[21:32] he went down to the king's house
[21:34] onto the scribe's chamber although all
[21:36] the princes sat there even elijah
[21:39] described the liar the son of shimaya he
[21:42] will undertand the son of akbar and
[21:44] jimariah the son of shafan and zedika
[21:47] the son of hannah and all the princes
[21:49] then my child declared unto them all the
[21:52] words that he had heard
[21:54] then barack read the book in the ears of
[21:56] the people therefore
[21:59] all the princes
[22:00] sent judea
[22:03] jehudi
[22:04] the son of nathaniel the son of
[22:06] shillinia the son of kushi and the barak
[22:08] saying take in thy hand the
[22:19] unto them they said unto him sit down
[22:22] now
[22:23] read it in our ears
[22:25] so barak read it in their ears
[22:27] now it came to pass
[22:29] when they had heard all the words they
[22:31] were afraid
[22:32] about one and another other ascensible
[22:36] we will surely tell the king of all
[22:38] these words they asked barack saying
[22:41] tell us now
[22:42] how does though write all these words at
[22:45] his mouth
[22:46] then barack answered them he pronounced
[22:49] all these words unto me with his mouth
[22:52] and i wrote them with ink
[22:55] in the book
[22:57] then said the princess and the barack go
[23:00] high d darwin jeremiah let no man know
[23:03] where he be
[23:04] and they went in under the king onto the
[23:07] court they laid up the rule in the
[23:09] chamber of illasama described and told
[23:12] all the words in the ears of the king
[23:15] so the king sent dehudi to fetch the
[23:18] rule
[23:20] he took it out of elisha the scribe's
[23:23] chamber
[23:24] and jihoody read it in the ears of the
[23:26] king
[23:27] so the king gets it both ways hear it
[23:28] first from somebody and then out to the
[23:31] rule and then get it spoken to him and
[23:33] in the ears of all the princes which
[23:35] stood beside the king now the king
[23:38] sat in the winter house in the night
[23:40] month
[23:41] and there was a fire on the hood
[23:43] burning before him
[23:45] and it came to pass
[23:47] that when jihudi had read three or four
[23:50] leaves
[23:51] he cut it with a pen knife
[23:54] and cast it into the fire
[23:56] that was on the earth
[23:58] until all the rule was consumed
[24:00] in the fire
[24:01] that was in the head
[24:03] yet they were not afraid
[24:05] nor read the garments neither the king
[24:08] nor any of his servants that heard all
[24:11] these words
[24:12] nevertheless
[24:13] el nathan
[24:14] and eliae
[24:16] and jamal had made intercession to the
[24:19] king that he would not burn the rule
[24:22] but he would not hear him
[24:24] but the king
[24:26] commanded gerard neal the son of hamales
[24:30] and syria the son of azrael and shalinia
[24:34] the son of abdil to take barack
[24:36] described and jammed a prophet but the
[24:38] lord hid them
[24:40] then the word of the lord came unto
[24:41] jeremiah
[24:42] after the king had burned the rule
[24:45] and the words which barack wrote at the
[24:47] motor drama are saying
[24:48] take thee again
[24:50] this is god speaking another role
[24:52] right in it
[24:54] so that scroll or that rule that was
[24:57] written was burned by the king
[25:00] god telling jeremiah take another rule
[25:02] write in it
[25:03] all the the former words which were in
[25:05] the first rule
[25:07] which joha joachim the king of judah
[25:10] burned
[25:10] and those shall say
[25:12] to king king of judah
[25:14] thus faith the lord
[25:17] there was burnt this rule saying
[25:20] why has thou written therein seeing the
[25:22] king of babylon shall certainly come and
[25:25] destroy this land and shall cause to
[25:27] cease from dense man and beast
[25:30] therefore
[25:31] thus saith the lord of jeopard
[25:34] king of judah
[25:35] he shall have none to sit upon the tune
[25:38] of david and his dead body shall be cast
[25:41] out in the day to the heat
[25:43] and in the night to the frost and i will
[25:45] punish him and his seed
[25:47] and his servants for the iniquity i will
[25:51] bring upon them upon the inhabitants of
[25:53] jerusalem upon the men of judah all the
[25:55] evil that i have pronounced against them
[25:58] but they had not
[26:00] then took jeremiah another role give it
[26:03] to barack described the son of nira who
[26:06] wrote therein from the mount of jeremiah
[26:08] all the words of the book were joking
[26:10] king of judah burning the fire
[26:12] and they were added besides them
[26:15] many
[26:16] like words may god bless this word what
[26:18] are inspired
[26:20] reading tonight from the scripture
[26:23] and to show you
[26:24] the power
[26:25] that all scripture is given by
[26:27] inspiration and these men these men of
[26:30] god wasn't figuring out things and
[26:33] reasoning they were genuinely motivated
[26:36] inspired and directed by god and all the
[26:40] books and all the words and all the
[26:44] mysteries that god wanted that is in the
[26:46] book is in the book
[26:47] god could take care of his own words
[26:49] could we give the lord a shout on that
[26:51] god could cover from the end to the
[26:54] beginning there is not one punctuation
[26:56] there is not one comma there is not one
[26:59] full step that is all the order god
[27:01] knows every punctuation every line it is
[27:04] perfectly in order and god knows every
[27:06] punctuation and every line of your life
[27:08] prayer is the name of the lord so he
[27:10] could direct and he could guide and you
[27:12] could see how he could really make all
[27:14] things to work together for your good
[27:16] according to romans 8 48 all blessed be
[27:19] the name of the lord so i want you to
[27:21] see
[27:22] this book
[27:24] and these words look at something dead
[27:26] this is not like a novel you put down no
[27:28] one again and you take a read and you
[27:30] know you read something no this book is
[27:32] a life it's the word of god
[27:36] look at jesus in luke 4.
[27:39] look for
[27:40] and verse 16 this is jesus now this is
[27:43] new testament he came to nazareth where
[27:45] he had been brought up and as his custom
[27:48] was
[27:48] he went on the sabbath on the synagogue
[27:52] on the sabbath day and stood up for to
[27:54] read
[27:55] so jesus
[27:57] is going and get this scroll this book
[27:59] and it was delivered unto him the book
[28:01] of the prophet isaac and when he had
[28:03] opened the book he found the place
[28:06] where it is whether it was written now
[28:08] friends
[28:10] if you don't know the word
[28:12] if you don't meditate on the word
[28:15] if you don't go into the word how could
[28:18] you find the place
[28:20] where it is written
[28:22] jesus found the place where it is
[28:23] written scripture
[28:26] he was quoting isaac 61 the spirit of
[28:28] the law is upon me because he has
[28:30] anointed me to preach the gospel of the
[28:32] poor he had sent me to heal the
[28:34] brokenhearted the pre-deliverance of the
[28:36] captives to recover in his fight after
[28:38] the blind that set up liberty them that
[28:40] are bruised
[28:41] to preach the acceptable year of the
[28:43] lord he closed the book
[28:45] he gave it against the minister sat down
[28:48] and the eyes of all them that were in
[28:50] the synagogue
[28:51] were fastened on him
[28:53] and he began to say unto them
[28:56] this d
[28:58] is this scripture fulfilled
[29:00] in your ears
[29:02] i want to challenge you tonight
[29:05] not
[29:07] you know like
[29:09] the bible says the word of the lord is
[29:10] sharper than to its sword i've got
[29:12] scripture written
[29:13] don't let it ever make you feel the word
[29:15] is about tonight
[29:16] don't let it ever make you feel the word
[29:18] have no value the word doesn't carry the
[29:21] strength
[29:22] the word has value
[29:24] the scripture has strength notice is no
[29:27] problem reading the article in facebook
[29:28] there's no problem reading an article a
[29:30] newspaper there's no problem reading and
[29:32] listening to some inspired speaker or
[29:34] some inspired lecturer or whatever it is
[29:36] but it seems there's a problem reading
[29:39] the word
[29:40] there's a problem going to the bible
[29:43] maybe it might look stale maybe it
[29:45] doesn't look like it's old-fashioned me
[29:47] i don't know
[29:48] but it seems like the devil himself
[29:51] trying to ensure and you know
[29:53] when you think about it when the bible
[29:55] was the book had
[29:57] i know the bible become an app to me it
[30:00] even more i wouldn't say difficult even
[30:02] though they have it on their phone
[30:04] if
[30:05] if the effort if
[30:07] how should i say it
[30:08] uh barramundi may pray in a habit if it
[30:11] doesn't come into a discipline and i had
[30:13] it
[30:14] then you could miss it so i saw brother
[30:17] had this phone and it had an alarm and
[30:19] the lamp went on i said what is it about
[30:21] he said that is reminding him to read
[30:23] the scripture i thought it was so good
[30:24] right that was to remind him for
[30:26] scripture reading something so i guess
[30:28] maybe
[30:30] he has to go to a scripture i find that
[30:32] is very very great because with this
[30:34] technology and so on it could get you
[30:36] away from
[30:37] turning the pages
[30:39] reading the words of the book
[30:41] getting your daily word yourself
[30:43] that you could find your scripture
[30:45] find your word a word from the lord so i
[30:47] want to encourage you you have to read
[30:50] your word
[30:51] mention your word and don't limit what
[30:54] that word can do for you descript
[30:56] yourself
[30:57] now
[30:58] first thessalonians 2.
[31:01] and this is paul
[31:03] speaking
[31:05] and paul
[31:06] very sincerely
[31:08] was shane himself
[31:10] and his approach
[31:12] um paul wasn't arrogant
[31:15] paul went to his own stuff that made him
[31:18] what he was and he said for yourselves
[31:20] veteran knew our entrance in unto you
[31:24] that he was not in vain
[31:27] but even after that we had suffered
[31:29] before and were shamefully entreated as
[31:32] you know at philippi we were bold in our
[31:35] god to speak unto you the gospel with
[31:38] much contention
[31:40] for our exaltation was not of deceit
[31:43] nor of uncleanness no in guy
[31:47] this is beautiful
[31:48] so he said we didn't exhort all your
[31:51] with deceit or on penis
[31:54] but but as we were allowed of god here
[31:57] we go to be put in trust with the gospel
[32:00] even so we speak
[32:02] not as pleasing men
[32:04] but god we tried our hearts
[32:07] and neither at any time
[32:10] use we
[32:12] flattering words as you know
[32:14] no a cloak of covetousness god is a
[32:17] witness
[32:18] nor of men sought we glory neither of
[32:21] you
[32:22] not yet of others which we might have
[32:25] been burdensome as the apostles of
[32:27] christ
[32:28] but we were gentle among you
[32:31] and hear this comparison even as a nurse
[32:35] cherished our children
[32:38] then paul switches here
[32:40] be so being affectionately desirous of
[32:44] you
[32:45] we were willing
[32:47] to have imparted unto you
[32:50] not the gospel only but also our own
[32:53] souls
[32:54] because you were dear unto us
[32:58] but ye brethren
[33:00] remember brethren our labor and travial
[33:04] for laboring knight and b and paul they
[33:07] had selling and they were doing their
[33:09] own business and so on because verse 9
[33:12] we would not be chargeable unto any of
[33:14] you
[33:15] we preach unto you the gospel of god
[33:18] we are witnesses and god also
[33:20] how holy and justly and unbelievably we
[33:23] believe ourselves among you that believe
[33:26] as you know how we exhorted and
[33:29] comforted and charged every one of you
[33:31] as a father that his children
[33:34] that you should walk
[33:36] worthy of god what calls you into his
[33:39] kingdom and glory
[33:41] and this is the verse i want to get
[33:44] for this cause
[33:48] also thank me god without ceasing
[33:51] because
[33:53] when you receive the word of god which
[33:55] you heard of us
[33:57] you received it
[33:58] not as the word of men
[34:01] but as it is in truth the word of god
[34:05] which
[34:06] effectively work it also in you that
[34:09] believe
[34:09] this verse here is a powerful verse
[34:13] paul is seeing he's thanking god
[34:17] we don't see sin because of how these
[34:19] people received the word from them
[34:21] the word that came out of their mouth
[34:23] he said you didn't receive it as a word
[34:25] of men all right so and so i said no you
[34:27] receive it in truth
[34:29] the word of god
[34:30] which
[34:31] here we go which effective effectually
[34:36] wicked also
[34:37] in you that believe
[34:40] so what this tells you
[34:42] the word
[34:43] cannot
[34:44] effectively work in people that do not
[34:46] believe
[34:48] paul went on to say first convergence
[34:50] and okay so this is the amplified
[34:53] all right okay let's continue here right
[34:55] this is our chapter two verse one this
[34:57] is so we continue
[34:59] and i brethren when i came onto you came
[35:01] not with excellency of speech or wisdom
[35:04] declaring unto you the testimony of god
[35:07] i determine not to know anything among
[35:09] you save jesus christ and i'm crucified
[35:11] i was with you in weakness and in fear
[35:14] in much trembling and my speech does
[35:17] that sound like um
[35:19] uh
[35:20] this manner speak your word and you know
[35:22] carry on no no that doesn't sound like
[35:23] that right paul i was with you in
[35:26] weakness and fear and much trembling and
[35:28] my speech and my preaching was not with
[35:32] enticing words of man's wisdom
[35:34] but in demonstration of the spirit and
[35:37] of power
[35:38] reason was fine give the reason that
[35:40] your faith should not stand in the
[35:42] wisdom of men but in the power of god so
[35:45] he's saying if the preaching switches to
[35:48] wisdom to knowledge then the fate of the
[35:51] people will be in the wisdom of men
[35:53] but he said my preaching is not in that
[35:55] my preaching is with the demonstration
[35:57] of spirit and power
[35:58] what that your faith should not stand in
[36:00] the wisdom of men but in the power of
[36:02] god how be it
[36:04] we speak wisdom among them that are
[36:06] perfect that will perfect this mature
[36:09] yet not the wisdom of this world
[36:11] nor the princes of this world that come
[36:13] to north but we speak the wisdom of god
[36:16] in a mystery even the hidden wisdom
[36:18] which god ordained before
[36:21] the world unto our glory unto our glory
[36:23] which none of the princes of this world
[36:25] knew had they known it they would have
[36:27] not have crucified the lord of glory but
[36:30] as it is written
[36:31] i had not seen or they have heard
[36:33] neither have it entered in the heart of
[36:35] man the things which god had prepared
[36:37] for them that love
[36:38] him but god had revealed them unto us by
[36:42] his spirit
[36:44] for the spirit switches all things he
[36:46] the deep things of god
[36:48] for what man what the things of a man
[36:50] see the spirit of a man which is in him
[36:52] even so the things of god know it no man
[36:56] but the spirit of god
[36:58] and here's what i want to get to now we
[37:00] have received
[37:02] not
[37:03] the spirit of the world
[37:05] but the spirit which is of god
[37:07] that we might know the things that are
[37:09] freely given to us by god
[37:11] which things we speak
[37:12] or note what he's saying after this
[37:15] allah back up a bit right he is saying
[37:18] god released us by his spirit right he's
[37:20] saying that the things of man is known
[37:22] by the spirit of man right then he says
[37:24] the things of god is known by the spirit
[37:26] of god
[37:27] and then he went on to say we have
[37:29] received
[37:30] not the spirit of the world but the
[37:32] spirit is of god that we might know the
[37:34] things that are feeling enough of god no
[37:36] watch he's saying here in our way things
[37:38] we speak
[37:39] watch the words now
[37:41] not in the words which man's wisdom
[37:44] teacher
[37:45] but which the holy ghost teaches
[37:47] comparing spiritual things with
[37:50] spiritual so he's identifying that the
[37:53] words
[37:54] are let's say this way spirit spoken
[37:56] words
[37:58] or spirit given words
[38:00] that comes from the holy ghost
[38:02] what he is also saying and not seeing is
[38:05] that words can be spoken that is not
[38:07] spirit given
[38:09] or not spirit released and that is why
[38:11] brother branham could say say what the
[38:13] tapes say
[38:14] see he could say it's dear everything is
[38:17] there on the tape
[38:19] so when you get from the tape or the
[38:21] message
[38:22] the word because he came to reveal the
[38:24] word itself is the revealed word you get
[38:28] in spirit given words words that was
[38:30] given to him to speak he said which
[38:32] thing also we speak not in the words
[38:34] which man's wisdom teach it but which
[38:37] the holy ghost teacher
[38:39] oh my
[38:40] so then those that believe or let's say
[38:43] this way receive and believe inwardly
[38:46] and willingly
[38:47] you find an effective working in their
[38:50] life
[38:51] hebrews 4 2
[38:53] explains and shared with us
[38:55] that israel
[38:57] all who heard the word for unto us was
[38:59] the gospel preached as well unto them
[39:01] comparison but the word preached did not
[39:03] profit them not being mixed with faith
[39:06] in them that heard it so even though
[39:08] everybody hears the gospel or the word
[39:11] or the message or malachi 4 teachings or
[39:13] whatever it is not everybody has this
[39:16] effective working
[39:18] in their lives
[39:19] because
[39:20] it's not being mixed with feet to them
[39:22] not hearing so this same gospel could
[39:24] become a debt trap almost without faith
[39:27] because unbelief will screw up things
[39:29] and method things that's why jesus took
[39:31] the people out of the room and only want
[39:34] believers around him those with faith
[39:36] because of much unbelief he couldn't do
[39:38] much miracles because of unbelief okay
[39:41] for under us was the gospel preached as
[39:43] well unto them oh this is scary
[39:46] this is scary
[39:48] because people could be hearing and not
[39:50] hearing
[39:51] seeing i'm not seeing this is scary
[39:53] hebrews 4 if we go down to verse 12 and
[39:57] 13
[39:58] and this is a key part tonight for the
[40:02] word of god this is the bible
[40:04] word of god is quick
[40:06] and powerful
[40:08] and sharper than retweet sword
[40:11] piercing even to dividing the son of
[40:13] soul and spirit of joint and marrow and
[40:16] is a designer of the torch and intents
[40:19] of the heart
[40:21] so even as we read the word
[40:24] as someone said the word is reading us
[40:28] oh my do you get that tonight
[40:31] how in here how can you see that tonight
[40:34] that as you
[40:35] study the word
[40:37] the word itself
[40:39] reads you
[40:40] so if you're not in order and you start
[40:42] to read the word about getting your
[40:43] heart right get yourself in order that
[40:46] word begin to bring conviction on you
[40:49] because that word is given
[40:52] from the mount of the prophets
[40:54] so now you can understand the depth what
[40:56] jesus told the devil man channeled by
[40:59] bread alone and jesus is hungry
[41:01] man charlie my bread alone and jesus was
[41:04] fasting 40 days man shout out alone and
[41:06] jesus could turn stone into bread but
[41:08] every word that proceeded out of the
[41:10] mouth of god or give the lord some
[41:12] praise in life
[41:13] man shall live by
[41:15] these words that are written in the book
[41:18] and when you understand
[41:20] that god's manual
[41:22] or god's instructions or god's law or
[41:26] god's plan for your life is wrap up in
[41:29] this book
[41:30] it's not wrap up in some university
[41:32] lecturer
[41:33] is that wrap up in a prime minister or
[41:35] government or something like that or
[41:37] your mother or father your purpose
[41:40] the purpose of your life is wrap up in
[41:42] this book
[41:43] so you have to have a burden a
[41:46] if that is so then then it has to be the
[41:49] enemy that is keeping me away from this
[41:51] book
[41:52] it has to be the enemy that making me
[41:55] feel like if this book is is not not
[41:58] what it's supposed to be but i just
[41:59] heard a word for hebrews 4 12 this book
[42:02] is sharp this word is sharp it is
[42:04] powerful it is a life in other words
[42:06] this bible is a living word it is god in
[42:09] print or give the lord some praise
[42:11] tonight this is god's truth it is sharp
[42:15] it is alive it is the sun it is the word
[42:18] of god do you believe that tonight oh
[42:20] blessed be the name of the lord
[42:22] so watch
[42:24] and um neither are there any creature
[42:26] that is not manifest in his sight but
[42:28] all things are naked and open unto the
[42:30] eyes of him with whom
[42:32] we have to do now when he amplified it
[42:34] says this here
[42:35] for the word of god speaks is a life
[42:39] and full of power
[42:41] making it active
[42:43] operative
[42:45] energizing
[42:46] and effective it is sharper than any
[42:49] two-edged sword penetrating to the
[42:51] dividing line of the breath of life soul
[42:55] and the immortal spirit as i say that
[42:57] you know some people
[42:58] in the head go on cuckoo when i say
[43:00] coconut nuts but
[43:02] they they kind of fight and they under
[43:04] depression and
[43:06] then they go to a psychiatrist or
[43:08] psychologist or whatever it is and they
[43:10] set them in a chair and they let them
[43:12] talk and they talk it out and they feel
[43:14] better they talk about the problem they
[43:16] talk like situation
[43:17] and then of course they pay their money
[43:19] and they get a receipt and so on they
[43:21] signed and
[43:22] all the person almost there to do is to
[43:24] listen to your talk talk it out and
[43:26] whatnot no the word of god is better
[43:28] than all them people all them sort of
[43:30] head shrinkers or psychiatrists and
[43:32] whatnot because this this could discern
[43:33] between the bone and the mouth the soul
[43:35] is spirit to see what's going on on the
[43:37] inside of you and could bring a
[43:39] deliverance so it is energizing is
[43:41] effective the word penetrating to the
[43:43] dividing line of the breath of the life
[43:45] soul
[43:46] and the immortal spirit of the joints
[43:49] and marrow of the deepest parts of our
[43:51] nature exposing
[43:54] and sifting
[43:56] and analyzing and judging the very
[43:59] thoughts and purpose of the heart or
[44:02] give the lord some praises and we go to
[44:04] ephesians 4 familiar scripture 11-16
[44:08] and we know it but let's look at it
[44:10] again he gives some apostles some
[44:12] prophets
[44:13] some evangelists from pastors and
[44:15] teachers
[44:16] for the perfecting of the saints woke up
[44:18] the ministry
[44:19] they defined the body of christ
[44:21] till we all come into the unity of the
[44:23] faith one
[44:24] not of the son of god to
[44:27] perfect man tree unto the measure of the
[44:30] stature of the fullness of christ
[44:32] purpose verse 14 of that that we
[44:34] henceforth be no more children
[44:36] first one through
[44:38] carried about with every wind of
[44:39] doctrine by the slayer of men and
[44:42] calling craftiness but by the lying way
[44:44] to deceive so paul is saying men
[44:47] who wearing ministry clothing okay
[44:50] and they understand
[44:53] they are have an anointing to lie and
[44:56] wait to deceive not this fight for
[44:58] ministry here now
[44:59] he said this purpose of coming to this
[45:01] maturity is to escape these guys
[45:04] but who's fifth 15 says but speaking the
[45:07] truth
[45:07] in love
[45:08] not speaking lovely the truth speak in
[45:10] the truth in love may grow up into him
[45:14] in all things which is the head even
[45:16] christ
[45:18] from whom the whole body fit to join
[45:19] together
[45:20] and compact it by that which every joint
[45:22] is applied
[45:23] according to the effectual working in
[45:26] the measure of every part see that it
[45:28] would effectually come there again make
[45:30] an increase of the body or the eddy find
[45:32] yourself in love now
[45:34] the amplified verse 13 says
[45:37] his intention this wealth was the
[45:39] perfection and the fully cryptin of the
[45:42] things his consecrated people that they
[45:44] should
[45:45] do the work of ministering towards
[45:48] building up christ's body's church
[45:52] it was fitting
[45:53] that it might develop
[45:56] until
[45:57] we attain
[45:58] oneness in the fate
[46:00] and in comprehension of
[46:02] the full and accurate knowledge of the
[46:05] son of god that's the power i want to
[46:06] get on the line there accurate knowledge
[46:09] that we might arrive at really mature
[46:13] manhood the completeness of personality
[46:17] which is nothing less than the standard
[46:19] height of christ's own perfection the
[46:21] measure of the structure of the fullness
[46:24] of christ and the completeness found in
[46:26] him
[46:27] so we may no longer be like children
[46:29] tossed like ships to and fro between
[46:31] trans gusts of teaching and wavering
[46:34] with every changing wind of doctrine the
[46:37] prey of cunning and cleverness of
[46:40] unscrupulous men gamblers engaged in
[46:43] every shifting form of trickery in
[46:45] inventing errors to mislead
[46:48] but here is another part of respectfully
[46:50] rather
[46:51] let our lives lovingly express truth in
[46:54] all things speaking truly dealing truly
[46:58] living truly and fold it in love let us
[47:01] grow up in every way in all things into
[47:03] him whose head
[47:05] even christ
[47:06] oh my isn't that wonderful tonight
[47:09] so just think about it for because of
[47:11] him the whole body the church in all his
[47:14] various parts closely joined and firmly
[47:17] knit together by the joints and the
[47:19] ligaments which is supply when each part
[47:22] with power adapted to its need is
[47:25] working properly in all its functions
[47:28] grows to full maturity
[47:30] building itself up
[47:32] in love i just love that tonight
[47:35] it shows that this is not like you know
[47:39] your order can occupy chicken three
[47:41] parts three pieces or two pieces with
[47:42] fries and they get it almost instant
[47:45] this is not this is building up this is
[47:47] growing this is like a child and a child
[47:50] a baby and then six months and then two
[47:52] years and then the child walk talk and
[47:54] they try to add in knowledge and
[47:56] understanding and child growth from
[47:58] babies to young child to young man to
[48:01] maturity
[48:02] this is god's church upon this rock i
[48:05] will build it doesn't say instant i will
[48:08] build layer upon layer line up online
[48:11] block up and block we trying to get
[48:13] things fast we try to get it now we try
[48:15] to understand everything now he said you
[48:17] know in part but when that which is
[48:19] perfect is come then that which is in
[48:21] part shall be done away with so
[48:23] therefore you could see
[48:25] god himself is interested in his growth
[48:27] process now adam didn't have that adam
[48:29] had let there be and adam was in god's
[48:31] image and like this and that imagined
[48:33] and righteousness fell when he got in
[48:34] flesh
[48:35] okay he fell when he got into flesh no
[48:39] this is the part i want to get to know
[48:41] in that um
[48:44] the mind
[48:46] is the travel to the heart
[48:49] that is why we have to hear the word
[48:52] that is why we have to meditate on the
[48:54] world
[48:55] and i want you to see this tonight there
[48:56] is one thing attached on it going to
[48:58] catch this
[48:59] the
[49:00] mind
[49:02] gets the word you hear the word
[49:04] and then the heart
[49:06] is where you almost regret it and you
[49:09] meditate and you think on these things
[49:12] and then
[49:14] this word has to be reflected
[49:18] in
[49:19] and through our bodies
[49:21] this is so important
[49:24] if you see this tonight you see
[49:26] something really powerful
[49:28] so it doesn't end upon a confession or
[49:31] profession it doesn't end
[49:33] on what you believe
[49:35] it really comes to fruition
[49:37] when it start to have an effect
[49:40] where it's expressed in the natural
[49:43] give the lord some praises i'm saying to
[49:45] you
[49:46] that this gospel cannot be something we
[49:48] talk about
[49:50] and just express and just speak
[49:53] it has to be something that begins to
[49:56] ooze out of our very being in other
[49:58] words this word
[50:00] has to become flesh
[50:02] in your flesh
[50:04] in my flesh
[50:05] this is god's plan
[50:08] this is god's objective
[50:10] this is god's motive as god was in
[50:13] christ
[50:14] reveal himself through christ christ
[50:16] coming to us revealing himself through
[50:18] us to the world
[50:20] so when peter
[50:22] got this power
[50:24] out of him to tell the man
[50:26] rise up and walk in the name of jesus
[50:27] christ and then tell the man it's not by
[50:29] our righteousness or holiness this might
[50:31] have been all but by faith in jesus
[50:33] christ he was expressing god to the
[50:35] world and the only way we can express
[50:37] god to the world
[50:38] correctly
[50:39] is not just by hanging out a book or
[50:41] giving another tape or something
[50:42] somebody you're teaching but to let that
[50:45] word be manifested in us
[50:48] through us
[50:49] by us could we give good lord a shout
[50:52] this this takes you all to church all
[50:54] together this is not just member thing
[50:55] church members like confessions they
[50:57] like to know what they believe and
[50:58] they're going to turn through the
[50:59] passages and so on they're not church
[51:00] thing now this is back to eating
[51:01] business this is actually trying to get
[51:04] you into a position where you see
[51:06] yourself as a son and daughter of god
[51:08] not a church member belonging to some
[51:10] group or to some organization but you
[51:13] are son of god who is actually fighting
[51:15] your way back upstream back into your
[51:17] place back into a position that you have
[51:19] to be a success for god that you have to
[51:22] do something that will glorify god
[51:23] failures doesn't glorify god
[51:25] defeat doesn't glorify god
[51:27] depression doesn't glorify god
[51:30] you in the dumps doesn't glorify god
[51:32] you're struggling that doesn't work like
[51:33] god
[51:34] it doesn't know if god does not
[51:35] gratified but
[51:36] god would be glorified in your success
[51:38] could we email somebody
[51:40] that i told joshua merited on the word
[51:44] can you feel like no they are night
[51:47] they have good success in other words
[51:49] the word give you
[51:50] the powerful
[51:52] thought insight into my mind
[51:54] and upon the word that you are drawn
[51:56] from from the words in the book
[51:59] i could release my spirit to bring back
[52:01] things i remember i could use my spirit
[52:03] to bring back point reference in my word
[52:05] to you that will activate a bigger faith
[52:07] in you because faith doesn't only come
[52:09] by hearing the word as the prophet said
[52:10] faith also come by experience
[52:13] so these things are written oh glory to
[52:15] god hallelujah these things are written
[52:18] for all examples
[52:19] to whom the end of the will have come
[52:21] so we have
[52:22] both positive
[52:24] and negative
[52:25] the positive things to draw us into
[52:26] faith to god the negative thing to see
[52:28] the effect of disobedience rebellion and
[52:32] plain evil and wickedness and the effect
[52:34] of those things because we have come to
[52:36] a spot where the decisions we make have
[52:39] fruits
[52:40] we consequences and actions sometimes
[52:42] seen and unseen known and unknown
[52:44] and this is where we are at so let's
[52:46] continue
[52:48] i trust tonight this is helping you in
[52:50] some way
[52:51] god and have this with me on display in
[52:53] and through our body
[52:54] through the channel of your mind and
[52:56] spirit and soul in receiving the word
[52:58] the word
[53:00] the full
[53:02] accurate
[53:03] knowledge of god
[53:05] coming down to our mind
[53:07] with the meditation of the word in our
[53:09] heart
[53:10] right now i have this written
[53:12] tender until it be done he says coming
[53:15] into presence so much so
[53:18] that it shows in our flesh
[53:20] just think
[53:22] god on display
[53:23] in
[53:24] and through our flesh
[53:26] display to the world
[53:28] this is more than a confessional
[53:29] profession this is more than i believe
[53:31] this or believe that
[53:33] this word will become flesh in your
[53:35] flesh
[53:36] in my flesh
[53:37] okay
[53:38] let's see if we could hold anything now
[53:41] first corinthians 6
[53:43] 15 i want to find the scripture first
[53:45] corinthians 6
[53:46] we want to look at verse
[53:48] 15 to 20.
[53:51] it says this know ye not that your
[53:52] bodies
[53:54] are the members of christ
[53:56] shall i then take the members of christ
[53:58] and make them the members of a hallett
[54:01] god forbid
[54:03] what
[54:04] know you not that he which is joined on
[54:06] harlot is one body
[54:08] for the two states he shall be one flesh
[54:11] but he that is joined unto the lord is
[54:12] one spirit
[54:14] free fornication
[54:16] every sin
[54:18] that a man do it is without the body
[54:20] but he that commit fornication sinners
[54:23] against his own body
[54:25] what
[54:26] know you not
[54:28] that your body
[54:29] is the temple of the holy ghost
[54:32] which is in you
[54:33] which you have of god and you are not
[54:35] your own
[54:37] for you are bought with a price and it
[54:39] doesn't want to get to you know
[54:41] therefore
[54:43] glorify god in your body
[54:46] and in your spirit which are gods
[54:49] so honor god
[54:50] and bring glory to him in your body
[54:53] but
[54:55] you know
[54:56] i didn't realize i didn't see that i
[54:58] have to glorify god in my body yes
[55:01] because what you are
[55:03] what you are receiving by way of the
[55:05] word by his thoughts that would come
[55:07] into you by you meditating but you are
[55:08] hearing read the words after the book
[55:10] and you have to hear the words in the
[55:11] book
[55:12] that's supposed to actually work an
[55:14] effective way
[55:16] till the strike and hit your body
[55:18] first corinthians 10 31 is a great
[55:20] scripture and all young people
[55:22] should get this scripture and make it on
[55:24] this particular one first corinthians 10
[55:26] 31 and share it with the other young
[55:28] people friends when therefore you eat or
[55:30] drink whatsoever you do do all to the
[55:34] glory of god
[55:38] the amplified so then whether you drink
[55:40] or eat whatever you may do do all for
[55:42] the unknown glory of god
[55:44] so if it cannot be done for the honor
[55:45] and glory of god then what don't do it
[55:50] don't
[55:51] do it
[55:53] isaiah 43
[55:55] interested in scripture verse 5 isaiah
[55:58] 43
[55:59] fear not i am with thee
[56:01] i will bring thy seat from the east and
[56:03] gather thee from the west
[56:05] i resisted to not give up until the salt
[56:07] keep my back to bring my sons from fire
[56:09] by doctors from the ends of the earth
[56:11] even everyone that is called by my name
[56:15] for i have created him
[56:18] for my glory
[56:20] i have formed him
[56:21] i have made him
[56:25] what creatures for
[56:27] for his
[56:28] glory for the brown
[56:30] or if people could only realize
[56:32] that's why i come to this morning and
[56:34] ask you to remember me as i go overseas
[56:35] and all things pray
[56:37] someone come the other day and said
[56:38] brother branham do you think it is wrong
[56:40] to do a certain thing
[56:42] i said why do you question why do you
[56:45] question an about if there's a question
[56:47] in your mind
[56:48] leave it alone
[56:50] don't do it at all
[56:52] just stay with that
[56:54] when you start to do anything
[56:56] if it's a question whether it is right
[56:59] or wrong stay away from it don't go into
[57:03] it at all then you know you're right
[57:06] now all things ought to be considered
[57:08] prayerfully so that's why i said if it's
[57:10] not going to work for the glory of god
[57:12] don't do it
[57:13] all things will be considered pressly
[57:15] first seek ye first the kingdom of god
[57:18] and his righteousness and all these
[57:20] other things shall be added
[57:22] and this is what i want to get to i am
[57:24] positive sure this morning
[57:29] listen to this one
[57:31] if men and women
[57:33] could only get into a position
[57:36] to weigh their soul
[57:38] their thinking their attitude
[57:41] will be perfect in the sight of god
[57:44] that would be one of the most powerful
[57:46] teachers ever existed
[57:49] oh my you hear that
[57:51] i am positive sure this morning if men
[57:54] and women could only get into the
[57:56] position
[57:57] so what if everybody inside this room
[57:59] tonight
[58:00] begins to receive this word as god just
[58:02] the scriptures believe this is what god
[58:05] wants you to hear
[58:06] this is what god wants you to know and
[58:08] you hear brother branham says that if
[58:11] people can get their attitude and their
[58:13] soul and their mind
[58:15] it will be one the most powerful church
[58:17] don't you want to ask god lord get me in
[58:19] that order give me a right attitude give
[58:22] me a healthy attitude you know attitude
[58:26] that pleases god
[58:28] then
[58:29] your you you know god could freshly
[58:30] anoint you
[58:32] and bring you into the place you want
[58:33] you to be
[58:34] let me just wrap up here
[58:37] the home stretch
[58:39] first peter 1
[58:41] 22-23
[58:44] peter speaketh
[58:45] seeing you have purified your souls
[58:50] in obeying the truth
[58:52] through the spirit
[58:54] unto unfake love of the brethren
[58:57] see that you love one another with a
[58:59] pure heart certainly
[59:02] purify your souls
[59:04] in obeying the truth
[59:06] purify your souls
[59:08] and obeying the truth so the truth comes
[59:10] for you to not only hear
[59:13] he told joshua meditate on the word day
[59:16] and night that you're able to do all
[59:19] that is written
[59:21] so the meditation of the word or you
[59:24] getting into the scriptures
[59:26] you know my wife tell me something she
[59:27] was listening to she said you don't want
[59:28] to be hearing and not applying
[59:31] that is great because you are hearing
[59:33] stuff
[59:34] and if you hear stuff it sounds good i
[59:36] like it
[59:38] before but that is not the purpose of it
[59:42] you know it's not the sweet and remote
[59:43] part it's very going to be effective
[59:45] sweeten him up is part of this book
[59:48] where you enjoy hearing you enjoy taste
[59:51] and you enjoy participating you enjoy
[59:54] seeing even in glory but you have to
[59:56] digest it it has to go down you have to
[59:58] act upon it you know i mean like i said
[1:00:00] angela coming to sweep your house to get
[1:00:02] your house stripped so clean you have to
[1:00:04] clean that you have to get empowerment
[1:00:06] your car is god's turning around and
[1:00:07] joining us i need a cleaner to be no no
[1:00:10] you have to get empowerment and you have
[1:00:12] to take up the broom and you have to do
[1:00:13] this sweeping yourself you can ask god
[1:00:15] for strength to get the cleaning done
[1:00:17] all right so watch brother brown let's
[1:00:19] give the scriptures first peter 22
[1:00:21] seeing you have purified your souls and
[1:00:23] obeying the truth through the spirit
[1:00:25] under fake love of veteran that you love
[1:00:28] one another
[1:00:29] with a pure heart favoritely being born
[1:00:31] again
[1:00:32] not of corruptable seed but of
[1:00:35] incorruptible by the word of god which
[1:00:38] live it
[1:00:39] and bite it forever
[1:00:41] so the born again
[1:00:43] or the holy ghost experienced
[1:00:45] or the new birth
[1:00:47] does not disconnect you from the word
[1:00:49] it's not just a spirit thing the only
[1:00:51] spirit and you don't care what does it
[1:00:53] say
[1:00:54] no
[1:00:54] this bird
[1:00:56] is by the incorruptible seed of the word
[1:00:59] this bird is the word turn into the
[1:01:01] spirit because you said my words are
[1:01:03] spirit and my life so i'm showing you
[1:01:06] that you cannot
[1:01:08] bypass the word you're almost through
[1:01:10] you belong tonight
[1:01:11] romans nine if you have the bible switch
[1:01:13] to romans nine you wanna go
[1:01:15] for verse twenty two this is a beautiful
[1:01:17] scripture just
[1:01:18] love it who's trying to tell you to i'll
[1:01:21] be your go down for a minister
[1:01:23] what if god
[1:01:24] willing to show his wrath and make his
[1:01:26] power known endured with much long
[1:01:28] suffering
[1:01:29] the vessels of rat fitted to destruction
[1:01:33] and that he might make known the riches
[1:01:36] of his glory on the vessels of mercy
[1:01:38] which he had before prepared unto glory
[1:01:41] even us
[1:01:43] whom he had called
[1:01:45] not of the jews only but also the
[1:01:47] gentiles so paul is saying this this
[1:01:50] glory this vessels of mercy it's not
[1:01:52] just jews only but also the gentiles
[1:01:55] he went on to quote scripture in verse
[1:01:57] 25 as he said in oc i will call them my
[1:02:00] people which were not my people and her
[1:02:03] beloved which was not beloved
[1:02:05] verse 26 it shall come to pass that in
[1:02:07] that place when it was said unto them
[1:02:08] you are not like people there shall they
[1:02:10] be called the children of the living god
[1:02:13] is also cried considering israel though
[1:02:16] though the number of the children israel
[1:02:17] be as the son of the sea a remnant shall
[1:02:19] be saved for he would finish the work
[1:02:23] and cut his shot in righteousness
[1:02:24] because a short work will the lord make
[1:02:26] upon the earth and so isaiah said before
[1:02:29] for note how paul is locked in to
[1:02:33] quoting the scripture from exams
[1:02:35] as a basis for presenting this
[1:02:37] revelation and as i said before except
[1:02:39] the lord has fabot has left us a seed we
[1:02:42] have been as sodom as we may like unto
[1:02:44] gomorrah
[1:02:45] what shall we say then that the gentiles
[1:02:48] which followed not after righteousness
[1:02:50] have attained to righteousness over
[1:02:52] hallelujah even the righteousness which
[1:02:54] is of faith
[1:02:56] so paul bringing out this great
[1:02:57] revelation here that the gentiles which
[1:03:00] followed not after righteousness
[1:03:02] have attained to righteousness even the
[1:03:04] righteousness which is of faith but
[1:03:06] israel which follow after the law of
[1:03:09] righteousness had not attained to the
[1:03:11] law of righteousness wherefore because
[1:03:13] they sorted not by faith but as it were
[1:03:16] by the works of the law for this
[1:03:19] stumbled at this tumbling stone for it
[1:03:21] is written and paul lay in scripture
[1:03:23] again he's going he quotes in psalms 18
[1:03:26] as written behold i lean inside a
[1:03:28] stumbling block a stumbling stone a rock
[1:03:30] of offense whosoever believes on him
[1:03:32] shall not be ashamed
[1:03:34] continuing to romans 10 he continues
[1:03:36] brethren my heart is zion prayer to god
[1:03:39] for israel is that they might be saved
[1:03:41] for i bear them record that they have a
[1:03:43] zeal of bored but not according to
[1:03:45] knowledge
[1:03:47] so you mean you can have zeal
[1:03:49] but don't have the accurate
[1:03:52] knowledge
[1:03:53] to back up that's to you
[1:03:55] have a zeal of god but not according to
[1:03:59] knowledge
[1:04:00] for they being ignorant of god's
[1:04:02] righteousness are going about to
[1:04:04] establish your own righteousness have
[1:04:06] not submitted themselves unto the
[1:04:08] righteousness of god for christ is the
[1:04:10] end of the law for righteousness to
[1:04:12] everyone that believes it for moses
[1:04:14] describes the righteousness of the law
[1:04:16] that the man which do it these things
[1:04:18] shall live by them but the righteousness
[1:04:20] here we go witches of faith speaks on
[1:04:23] this wise see nothing like that who
[1:04:25] shall ascend to heaven that is to bring
[1:04:27] christ from from above or who shall
[1:04:29] ascend to the deep that is to bring
[1:04:30] christ up again from the dead but what
[1:04:33] see at it here we go saints the word is
[1:04:35] 90 where is it even in thy mouth where
[1:04:38] is it in thy heart that is the word of
[1:04:42] faith that we preach that thou shalt
[1:04:44] confess with my mouth the lord jesus
[1:04:46] shall believe in thine heart that god
[1:04:48] has risen from the dead though shall be
[1:04:50] saved for what saith the scripture
[1:04:54] who am i
[1:04:57] for if i shall confess right for okay
[1:05:00] and we are
[1:05:01] for god raising from the dead and thou
[1:05:03] shalt be saved for what for with the
[1:05:05] heart man delivers unto righteousness
[1:05:08] but with the mouth confession is made
[1:05:10] under salvation for the scripture said
[1:05:12] whoever believes in him shall not be
[1:05:14] ashamed
[1:05:15] for there is no difference between jew
[1:05:16] and greek for the same lord over all is
[1:05:19] rich unto all them that call upon him
[1:05:22] for whosoever shall call upon the name
[1:05:24] of the lord shall be saved here we go
[1:05:27] then how shall they call on him in whom
[1:05:29] they have not believed
[1:05:32] how shall they believe in him whom they
[1:05:34] have not heard and how shall they hear
[1:05:37] without that preacher
[1:05:39] and how shall they preach without being
[1:05:41] sent
[1:05:42] are just written or beautiful at the
[1:05:44] feet of them that preach the gospel of
[1:05:46] peace and bring glad tidings of good
[1:05:48] things so that's reversed the whole day
[1:05:51] sent
[1:05:52] preacher to preach that they might hear
[1:05:55] the word that they might believe that
[1:05:57] they could call upon him
[1:05:59] so then fate come by hearing
[1:06:01] but for okay for they have not all
[1:06:03] obeyed the gospel for isaiah said lord
[1:06:06] who i believe or report so then faith
[1:06:09] come by hearing
[1:06:10] and hearing by the word of god could you
[1:06:12] give god some praise speak up my hearing
[1:06:14] and hearing by the word of the lord so
[1:06:16] the more you listen to the word hear the
[1:06:18] word study the word measured in the word
[1:06:21] is the more faithfulness begin to grow
[1:06:23] and take a hole in your heart in your
[1:06:26] life and in your mind that is why the
[1:06:28] prophetic sort is to try to read the
[1:06:30] bible and pray every day and you get
[1:06:31] closer to god
[1:06:33] it sounds simple it's some child like it
[1:06:35] sounds so easy
[1:06:36] what is it
[1:06:38] read the bible and pray
[1:06:40] every day
[1:06:41] read your bible as a key
[1:06:42] your bible is what's going to start you
[1:06:44] read your is what you're connected to
[1:06:47] your your your your heavenly language
[1:06:49] your your cell phone above before you
[1:06:51] use your physical cell phone you have a
[1:06:53] you have a cell phone to connect heaven
[1:06:54] you have a fleet line going to profit to
[1:06:57] connect us to the feet of the fathers
[1:06:59] that we can have access
[1:07:00] to get the god's blessing so we're
[1:07:02] almost true praise the lord amen
[1:07:05] all right
[1:07:06] so
[1:07:07] [Music]
[1:07:08] so then feet come a hearing hearing by
[1:07:10] the word of
[1:07:13] first of all god 23
[1:07:16] 12
[1:07:17] 5 23 says and the very god
[1:07:20] of peace
[1:07:21] sanctify you holy
[1:07:24] and i pray god
[1:07:26] your holy spirit and soul
[1:07:29] and body
[1:07:31] be preserved blameless
[1:07:33] unto the common beloved jesus christ
[1:07:35] so note
[1:07:36] paul here did not leave all the body
[1:07:39] part so this is not an esoteric and a
[1:07:42] philosophical and an intellectual
[1:07:44] whether kind of mind game thing and
[1:07:47] hearing things that were not no
[1:07:49] it has to do spirit
[1:07:52] soul
[1:07:53] and body
[1:07:55] second timothy 2
[1:07:57] and i was talking and mentioning sister
[1:07:59] isaac today how is interesting how like
[1:08:02] in ephesians paul referred to like
[1:08:04] soldier talked
[1:08:06] you know and i was still like that
[1:08:07] that
[1:08:08] i realized you cannot just throw ammo on
[1:08:11] somebody and throw gun and and so on
[1:08:13] instead of the battle they will get
[1:08:14] killed
[1:08:15] there's a training procedure there's
[1:08:17] actually no using gun
[1:08:18] i i'm not never click on i hear when you
[1:08:21] when you hold a gun in your shooting and
[1:08:23] recoil them different things that you
[1:08:24] might be prepared for that all that is
[1:08:26] possibly packaging and training and
[1:08:28] and everything else discipline shine
[1:08:30] your boots making up your bed getting an
[1:08:32] order the bluegill the song the trumpet
[1:08:34] the certain song and they called to
[1:08:37] retreat the call to go forward although
[1:08:39] for the meals whatever it is the
[1:08:41] training that is there to become a
[1:08:43] soldier and this is what paul is saying
[1:08:46] here to timothy in timothy ii timothy 2
[1:08:49] is his doubt therefore my son be strong
[1:08:52] in the grace that is in christ jesus
[1:08:54] notice
[1:08:56] all what we see in here is not paul
[1:08:58] having a bunch of babies and stuff
[1:09:00] something like that solid christian
[1:09:02] solid encouragement doubt therefore my
[1:09:05] son be strong in the grace that is in
[1:09:07] christ jesus and the things that you
[1:09:10] have heard of me
[1:09:12] among many witnesses the same commit
[1:09:15] thou the faithful men who shall be able
[1:09:18] to teach others also so paul saying
[1:09:21] please pass on this teaching what you
[1:09:23] heard what you see what your witness let
[1:09:25] faithful men carry about and teach
[1:09:28] others thou therefore endure hardness as
[1:09:31] the good soldier of jesus christ i guess
[1:09:33] a lot of christians don't do wouldn't
[1:09:34] like that scripture at all that
[1:09:35] scripture yeah jump over that one no
[1:09:38] paul's told timothy endure what hardness
[1:09:41] as a good soldier of jesus christ
[1:09:44] no man that wore it
[1:09:46] entangled himself with the affairs of
[1:09:47] this life that he may please him who has
[1:09:50] chosen him to be a soldier and if a man
[1:09:53] also strives for masteries the next
[1:09:55] level
[1:09:56] yet he is not crowned except he strives
[1:09:59] lawfully
[1:10:00] the husband man must and that labor must
[1:10:04] be put was the first particulars of the
[1:10:06] fruits
[1:10:08] and this last verse here is very
[1:10:10] interesting
[1:10:12] and
[1:10:13] i guess
[1:10:14] you know how paul would say these words
[1:10:16] consider what i see
[1:10:19] and the lord
[1:10:20] give the understanding in all things in
[1:10:22] the amplify it says these words here
[1:10:26] think over these things i am singing
[1:10:29] understand them
[1:10:31] and grasp their application
[1:10:34] for the lord will grant you full insight
[1:10:36] and understanding in everyday
[1:10:39] wow
[1:10:41] so
[1:10:43] is almost as if paul is saying hear this
[1:10:47] i'm giving you ingredients
[1:10:50] and god will give you the understanding
[1:10:52] to put them together to mike to get a
[1:10:53] nice meal
[1:10:55] think on these things
[1:10:57] think on
[1:10:58] the what i'm presenting to you
[1:11:00] in other words don't ignore them i want
[1:11:03] to pay careful attention
[1:11:06] to what i'm presenting to you
[1:11:08] and god will grant you insight and
[1:11:11] understanding because what i'm given to
[1:11:13] you is given by the spirit
[1:11:15] that is paul is presenting about giving
[1:11:17] you things that is given by the spirit
[1:11:19] and the spirit will further reveal it
[1:11:21] or unfold it
[1:11:23] do you catch that tonight
[1:11:25] because you see the things that of god
[1:11:28] and i i just say it this way what god
[1:11:30] give
[1:11:31] brother branham is spirit given words
[1:11:34] the spoken word is originally seen why
[1:11:36] would he say that not just words
[1:11:38] it have different philosophers have
[1:11:41] played two one confucius and what now
[1:11:42] they're not originally i talk
[1:11:45] in people in the market please and share
[1:11:47] a nice torch and and so on like that all
[1:11:50] that is good it's very philosophical and
[1:11:52] it's logical and whatnot that's not
[1:11:54] original seed
[1:11:56] that is man's energies
[1:11:58] that is man philosophizing and
[1:12:01] meditating on the world and the things
[1:12:03] of the world and
[1:12:05] to yourself be true maybe i don't know
[1:12:07] quote that or what not dynamite but you
[1:12:08] know this is all kind of quotation and
[1:12:10] stuff right
[1:12:11] it sounds good someday sometimes it's
[1:12:13] good but that's not original seeded
[1:12:16] the original seed is what comes from the
[1:12:18] mouth of god the original seed is what
[1:12:20] come from the
[1:12:21] everyone sees what's in the bible
[1:12:24] so that's why i want to encourage you
[1:12:25] tonight to meditate on this word
[1:12:28] day
[1:12:29] and night we're going to close
[1:12:32] second timothy 2 12 and 16 lower down 12
[1:12:35] to 16
[1:12:36] if we suffer
[1:12:38] we shall also read with him
[1:12:40] if we deny him
[1:12:41] he'll also deny us if we believe not yet
[1:12:44] he abides faithfully he cannot ignite
[1:12:46] himself
[1:12:47] all these things
[1:12:49] put them in remembrance
[1:12:51] charging them before the lord that they
[1:12:52] strive not about with words to no
[1:12:54] prophet but to the subverting of the
[1:12:56] years
[1:12:57] study
[1:12:58] to show thyself approve unto god
[1:13:02] a workman that needed not be ashamed
[1:13:05] rightly dividing the word of truth but
[1:13:07] shun profane and being babbling for they
[1:13:10] would increase on the more
[1:13:11] ungodliness
[1:13:13] and that last part
[1:13:15] it says reminded people the amplified of
[1:13:18] these facts
[1:13:19] and solemnly charge them
[1:13:21] in the presence of the lord to avoid
[1:13:24] petty controversies over words
[1:13:26] which does no good but upsets and
[1:13:28] undermines the fate of the hearers
[1:13:31] study and the eager to do your utmost to
[1:13:34] present yourself to god approve
[1:13:37] tested by trial a workman who has no
[1:13:39] cause to be ashamed correctly analyzing
[1:13:42] and accurately dividing rightly handling
[1:13:45] and skillfully teaching skillfully
[1:13:47] teaching the word of god but avoid all
[1:13:49] empty vein useless idol talk for it will
[1:13:52] lead people into more and more
[1:13:54] ungodliness
[1:13:56] and it's so good when you could pull
[1:13:58] yourself aside
[1:14:00] and talk to the lord
[1:14:02] pull yourself aside and make it from the
[1:14:03] word of god and ask god for
[1:14:06] strength
[1:14:07] ask god for good health
[1:14:09] ask god for your ability to do your best
[1:14:12] in the short time we have young hood
[1:14:14] he will cut the work short in
[1:14:15] righteousness
[1:14:16] when he first started out we
[1:14:18] had all black hair and everything else
[1:14:20] all our energy and strength
[1:14:22] no we agreeing are we seeing a whole new
[1:14:24] crop regional
[1:14:26] and every generation gets almost like
[1:14:28] weaker but we believe in our hearts
[1:14:30] that before they call the lord
[1:14:32] there will be a strong bunch of people
[1:14:35] that will be here to witness christ
[1:14:37] they will understand by revelation
[1:14:39] that the church that jesus built he said
[1:14:41] punishment i've been my church which is
[1:14:42] the faith foundation
[1:14:44] that church is coming to a head
[1:14:46] a camp
[1:14:47] that will be the omega bride of jesus
[1:14:50] christ the capstone church
[1:14:52] on the earth this church is supposed to
[1:14:54] be glorious this church going to glorify
[1:14:56] god he said this bribe will form the
[1:14:58] headstone that he could come into it
[1:15:01] so this will be the capstone bride this
[1:15:03] will be the eve that will not feel the
[1:15:05] eve that will not fall this bride will
[1:15:07] be the very word itself in other words
[1:15:10] the word made flesh this bride will
[1:15:12] continue the scripture that he is left
[1:15:14] out because he stopped in the middle of
[1:15:16] that statement the spirit is upon me for
[1:15:18] this day the scripture is fulfilled he
[1:15:20] actually stopped in the middle of a
[1:15:22] scripture not by chance but by design
[1:15:24] and the prophet revealed to us that the
[1:15:26] bride who will have the ministry of
[1:15:29] christ will pick up the rest of that
[1:15:30] scripture to declare that they are
[1:15:32] vengeance of all god we can't declare
[1:15:34] vengeance we can't declare judgment
[1:15:35] because we are sinners saved by grace
[1:15:37] but
[1:15:38] the ministry of christ can do that
[1:15:41] that same ministry is promising written
[1:15:43] the evidence of that ministry is not
[1:15:45] just you know talk
[1:15:47] that ministry would be emanated to the
[1:15:50] flesh of men
[1:15:52] god
[1:15:53] will take men as his agency once again
[1:15:56] a channel of god and channels of god to
[1:15:59] show god
[1:16:01] and in showing god we glorify god that
[1:16:03] is how we grow if i go to the world he
[1:16:05] said you you take a light and hide it
[1:16:08] under a bush you take a light and put it
[1:16:10] in the lampstand there's a bit of light
[1:16:12] and that is he said
[1:16:14] the men that men may see your good works
[1:16:17] and glorify the father in heaven men
[1:16:19] will see what your good words know give
[1:16:22] us words
[1:16:23] and give us works and people will
[1:16:24] glorify god when they see the word and
[1:16:27] the works let us borrow it

[1:16:46] to know that this word is alive
