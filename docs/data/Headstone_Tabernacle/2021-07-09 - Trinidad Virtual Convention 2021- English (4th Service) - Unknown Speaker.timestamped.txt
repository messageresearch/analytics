[1:06:26] wonderful opportunity to greet brothers
[1:06:29] and sisters
[1:06:30] far away from my place from here in
[1:06:33] germany
[1:06:34] in a virtual meeting i thank you
[1:06:37] pastor theo for your kind invitation to
[1:06:40] let me give a greeting to you
[1:06:43] also theo it is a very nice topic
[1:06:46] that you have chosen for this convention
[1:06:49] the dispensation of another
[1:06:52] ephesian and it is a continuation
[1:06:56] of the other conventions that are behind
[1:06:58] us
[1:07:01] i want to share a little thought with
[1:07:03] you all
[1:07:04] and i hope it helps us to approach a
[1:07:07] good understanding
[1:07:09] that we are living in a time of a new
[1:07:11] dispensation
[1:07:13] with many promises for this day
[1:07:17] certainly it is interesting to see that
[1:07:20] the prophet
[1:07:21] used two words in this context
[1:07:27] ephesus and ephesian
[1:07:31] ephesians on one side
[1:07:35] we see a person a group of people
[1:07:39] an ephesian on the other side
[1:07:42] we see an age called the ephesian age
[1:07:46] and we understand that this kind of age
[1:07:49] will be on earth during the days of
[1:07:52] laodicea
[1:07:54] we are all familiar with the thought
[1:07:56] that god has called a bride
[1:07:59] out of laodicea to live in her
[1:08:02] bridal age
[1:08:05] i made a little drawing a slight to
[1:08:08] express
[1:08:09] what is in my heart
[1:08:20] let's look at israel they came out of
[1:08:24] egypt moses
[1:08:27] led them but not by himself
[1:08:31] they was led by the cloud and
[1:08:35] the pillar of fire
[1:08:39] joshua took them across the jordan river
[1:08:42] and had them move into the promised land
[1:08:46] but the people could not immediately go
[1:08:49] to their promised land
[1:08:51] joshua met the captain of the lord
[1:08:54] there he received a message and through
[1:08:58] that message israel went into their
[1:09:01] promise
[1:09:01] into their land
[1:09:05] now we see in the days of our lord jesus
[1:09:08] christ
[1:09:13] that there were also four steps
[1:09:16] it speaks of deliverance
[1:09:19] it started with john the baptist and he
[1:09:22] said
[1:09:23] he must increase but i must
[1:09:26] decrease when this great man
[1:09:31] jesus christ came on the scene went to
[1:09:34] calvary
[1:09:35] crossed the jordan for us and purchased
[1:09:39] a
[1:09:39] bride through his shed blood
[1:09:42] he himself came back and met 120 people
[1:09:48] with the pillar of freya and isn't it
[1:09:51] interesting to see
[1:09:52] that there were 11 of his disciples
[1:09:55] 11 apostles when this happened
[1:10:00] then the people had to wait for about
[1:10:04] 20 years until the 12th
[1:10:07] apostle could come in and in those
[1:10:10] days the real
[1:10:14] emphasis days started
[1:10:17] but on the other side judgment
[1:10:21] came upon israel because they were
[1:10:23] unbelieving
[1:10:27] the enemy destroyed the temple
[1:10:31] israel went into the long period of
[1:10:33] diaspora
[1:10:34] and the church ages began
[1:10:38] now the time came for the gentiles to
[1:10:41] come in
[1:10:44] if we compare this with what happened in
[1:10:47] our day
[1:10:48] we see the same pattern
[1:10:54] william mary and branham came on earth
[1:10:57] prepared a way for the lord jesus the
[1:10:59] son of man
[1:11:01] to come here and this son of man
[1:11:04] let us know that the bride of christ
[1:11:09] will come to her promised land through a
[1:11:12] third pool
[1:11:15] now i want to end with a reference to
[1:11:18] the time in which we live
[1:11:22] the bride is called
[1:11:26] out by a loud voice
[1:11:30] come out from among them
[1:11:35] she grows as she eats the open book
[1:11:40] how long will it be before she sees her
[1:11:44] promise
[1:11:45] to dine with him at the table
[1:11:50] we understand that it will be very
[1:11:54] different from what people think will
[1:11:57] come in
[1:11:59] the bible says the lord has created
[1:12:03] something new
[1:12:06] and we know after the last predestinated
[1:12:10] soul will come
[1:12:11] in into the mystical body of christ
[1:12:15] there will be a rapture grace will
[1:12:18] now no longer be available to the
[1:12:20] gentiles
[1:12:22] it will go to israel to call out
[1:12:25] a small group these 144
[1:12:29] 000 jewish people
[1:12:33] so we see it is all done
[1:12:36] through the lord jesus christ
[1:12:43] this great message is brought to us
[1:12:48] through the seventh angel through
[1:12:50] malachi 4.
[1:12:53] god is doing a hidden but
[1:12:56] a wonderful thing among his people
[1:12:59] we are going to a climax of which we
[1:13:02] never had any idea
[1:13:05] it is his work the great pillar of fire
[1:13:09] brought paul in in his day
[1:13:13] it was god's election not matthew
[1:13:17] who people thought was the one but
[1:13:20] this pillar of fire is dealing with his
[1:13:23] bride
[1:13:24] right now to bring in the final
[1:13:27] predestinated soul
[1:13:30] soon we will gather together not in a
[1:13:34] virtual space
[1:13:35] but in a higher place may god bless you
[1:13:39] all
[1:13:40] let us stay close to each other
[1:13:43] let us put aside all our own
[1:13:46] ideas we know that it is no longer
[1:13:50] a one-man show
[1:13:54] god this great person
[1:13:58] is drawing his bride together to come
[1:14:02] inside man to manifest himself
[1:14:06] here on earth as he did
[1:14:09] in paul's and brother branham's time
[1:14:14] what a glorious day
[1:14:17] we have the privilege of living
[1:14:22] god bless you all and many greetings
[1:14:26] from the little bride here in germany

[1:25:09] glory for the privilege
[1:25:11] and the opportunity that the lord has
[1:25:14] given me
[1:25:15] to be to give a testimony to create

[1:25:36] uh it is a terrible time the world is
[1:25:38] going
[1:25:39] through a kind of emergency and the
[1:25:42] the whole world is in fear but we thank
[1:25:45] god
[1:25:46] uh that after such a time like it is we
[1:25:49] are not to be afraid
[1:25:50] because the lord told us in the psalms
[1:25:53] 46
[1:25:54] that he is our refuge the lord is our
[1:25:57] refuge
[1:25:58] the lord is the ever-present help in the

[1:26:01] and the name of the lord is a strong
[1:26:04] tower

[1:26:07] shall we not fear
[1:26:08] so thank you very much and without
[1:26:10] wasting time
[1:26:13] let us read a scripture uh jeremiah
[1:26:16] 33 because i have only 10 minutes so
[1:26:19] jeremiah chapter 33
[1:26:21] this is what he says verse 3 jeremiah 33
[1:26:24] verse 3
[1:26:25] he says like it is yeah maya 33 verse 3
[1:26:28] he says call unto me this is god
[1:26:32] speaking to us so in this hour of
[1:26:34] imagining that we are living in
[1:26:36] god is calling on us call unto me that
[1:26:39] is jeremiah 33 verse 3
[1:26:41] call unto me and i will answer thee and
[1:26:44] show the great and mighty things
[1:26:46] wicked doubt no it's known blessed be
[1:26:48] the name of the lord
[1:26:49] so god is calling on us to call on him
[1:26:51] and then when we got to
[1:26:53] uh uh in the second column chapter 7
[1:26:56] verse 14 this is what god promises
[1:26:58] chapter 7 second chronicles
[1:27:00] verse 14 he says if my people a
[1:27:04] man that are called by my name that's
[1:27:06] right
[1:27:07] if my people that are called by my name
[1:27:09] shall humble themselves
[1:27:10] that is that that is the second
[1:27:12] chronicles chapter seven
[1:27:14] the paper the pages are we are not
[1:27:17] separated
[1:27:19] and it's a new bible so but i read from
[1:27:22] here
[1:27:23] it says if my people which are called by
[1:27:25] my name
[1:27:26] shall humble themselves and pray and
[1:27:29] seek my face and turn from their
[1:27:33] wicked ways they will lie here from
[1:27:36] heaven
[1:27:37] and will forgive their sin and
[1:27:40] will heal their land blessed be the name
[1:27:42] of the lord may the lord add his
[1:27:44] blessing on the reading of the word
[1:27:45] father
[1:27:46] in the mighty name of the lord jesus
[1:27:48] this is your word
[1:27:49] thank you for the opportunity to read it
[1:27:51] and lord god we ask you
[1:27:53] to speak to us in these closing moments
[1:27:56] of the times of the gentile
[1:27:57] blessed brother ovi bless the virtual
[1:27:59] convention bless my fellow ministers all
[1:28:01] over the world
[1:28:02] bless all your children all over the
[1:28:04] world that are hearing in the name of
[1:28:05] the lord jesus christ we pray
[1:28:07] i pray amen and amen in that massive
[1:28:10] desperation
[1:28:11] the prophet said talks about a time of
[1:28:15] emergency
[1:28:16] there will be a time of emergency upon
[1:28:18] the bride
[1:28:20] which will come upon the earth to force
[1:28:23] us
[1:28:24] into desperation because god has three
[1:28:26] things
[1:28:27] that he uses to get his student into
[1:28:29] desperation
[1:28:30] the first thing is the love of god
[1:28:34] in our hearts pushes us into desperation
[1:28:37] because we love
[1:28:38] god and then the second thing that
[1:28:41] pushes
[1:28:42] us into desperation he said it's the
[1:28:44] signs of the times
[1:28:46] when we see what was prophesied by the
[1:28:49] prophets in the bible
[1:28:50] when we see what malachi for prophesied
[1:28:52] on the tips and the books
[1:28:54] manifesting coming to pass being
[1:28:57] fulfilled
[1:28:58] it it steers up our hearts
[1:29:01] it gets us on on
[1:29:05] our it gets us on our toes
[1:29:08] it wakes us up
[1:29:11] so the second thing that brings a
[1:29:13] desperation
[1:29:14] is is fulfillment of the world that was
[1:29:18] promised
[1:29:18] and then the third thing when the
[1:29:20] children of god are very sourceful
[1:29:23] and they are procrastinating and they
[1:29:26] somehow are not getting into the
[1:29:29] desperation
[1:29:30] then what god does he has one lastic
[1:29:32] card he uses
[1:29:33] and that is bringing a time of emergency
[1:29:36] upon the world
[1:29:37] and reverence right now beginning with
[1:29:39] last year
[1:29:41] we are seeing a time of emergency upon
[1:29:44] the earth
[1:29:46] cities are being locked down entire
[1:29:48] nations are being locked down
[1:29:51] businesses are being locked down
[1:29:52] churches are being
[1:29:54] locked down uh
[1:29:58] football uh
[1:30:01] stadiums where they go for football and
[1:30:03] other games are all being locked down
[1:30:06] rather it is so hard it's so terrible
[1:30:11] when this time of emergency comes in
[1:30:14] then
[1:30:14] it wakes up god's children and that's
[1:30:17] the dusty cat that god wants
[1:30:18] that that god has according to the
[1:30:20] message of desperation
[1:30:22] to wake us up the bride we've had the
[1:30:25] word we thank god for voice of god
[1:30:27] we thank god for its partners that are
[1:30:29] sponsoring it
[1:30:30] to scatter the message all over the
[1:30:32] world so we have had
[1:30:34] the message we have had in the tips we
[1:30:36] have read the books
[1:30:38] we have it on the we have the message
[1:30:40] now on
[1:30:41] other devices and we know what the
[1:30:44] message
[1:30:45] says we thank god for the fight for the
[1:30:48] ministry
[1:30:49] over the years they have leveraged to
[1:30:51] bring what malachi first said
[1:30:53] to the bride but now the promises
[1:30:56] and the prophecies for the bride that
[1:30:59] are in the word
[1:31:00] oh blessed be the name of the lord need
[1:31:03] to be manifested and there's no way they
[1:31:06] can be manifested
[1:31:08] until we get into desperation that's why
[1:31:11] in jeremiah chapter 33 verse 3
[1:31:14] we see the lord calling on us we that
[1:31:17] have received
[1:31:18] the promises we that have the revelation
[1:31:21] of the prophecies of the hour we who
[1:31:24] know our inheritance
[1:31:25] our redemptive rights what god promised
[1:31:28] the bride
[1:31:29] in this hour before the rapture must be
[1:31:31] manifested
[1:31:32] what god promised the bride before the
[1:31:35] rapture takes place
[1:31:36] must be actualized must be manifested
[1:31:39] must be put on fresh musty come to pass
[1:31:42] must become a reality
[1:31:44] must be must become a reality
[1:31:47] so now we are in a time for the
[1:31:49] manifestation
[1:31:51] of what god promises the bride
[1:31:56] that's the only thing that is keeping
[1:31:58] off the rapture
[1:31:59] there has to be a manifestation of what
[1:32:02] god
[1:32:02] spoke about the bride and that's why
[1:32:05] he's calling on us to call on him
[1:32:08] that's why god is calling on us to call
[1:32:10] on him he says call unto me
[1:32:13] and i will hear thee and show you great
[1:32:15] and mighty things
[1:32:17] that you didn't know we have the
[1:32:19] promises but god
[1:32:20] is waiting for us to call on him for
[1:32:23] these promises to be manifested
[1:32:25] it cannot be manifested when we just sit
[1:32:27] back and relax
[1:32:29] and take it easy no in the basic
[1:32:33] desperation
[1:32:34] brother says until we get to our knees
[1:32:37] in prayer in intercession and
[1:32:40] suffocation and call on the name of the
[1:32:42] lord
[1:32:42] what god promised cannot be manifested
[1:32:46] so my brother my sister we have
[1:32:48] procrastinated a lot
[1:32:50] we have kept it off for a long time we
[1:32:54] have been complacent for a long time
[1:32:56] we've been complacent for a long time
[1:32:59] we've dragged our feet for a long time
[1:33:02] we have not
[1:33:04] taken care about it for a long time but
[1:33:06] now this is the time
[1:33:08] that we have to get into desperation
[1:33:11] we have to call on the lord for the
[1:33:13] manifestation of
[1:33:14] every seven thunder prophecy and seven
[1:33:17] thunder promise
[1:33:18] that that is that that god gave us
[1:33:21] through malachi
[1:33:22] 4 which is on the tapes and the books
[1:33:24] those promises those prophecies
[1:33:25] for the bride we are not given to remain
[1:33:28] on the tips and the books and the bible
[1:33:30] they must be manifested before the
[1:33:32] rapture takes place
[1:33:33] these promises must manifest but they
[1:33:36] will never be manifested
[1:33:37] until we call on the lord we go to our
[1:33:40] knees
[1:33:41] daily and begin calling on the lord
[1:33:43] because the time of emergency is upon us
[1:33:46] calamity after calamity after calamity
[1:33:49] is striking the earth therefore we have
[1:33:52] to
[1:33:52] call on the name of the lord for the
[1:33:54] manifestation
[1:33:55] for the bride's promises what we need is
[1:33:58] the talking
[1:33:59] the dynamics the creator deity
[1:34:03] stepping into the perfected adopted
[1:34:06] bride
[1:34:07] and that to happen we need to go to our
[1:34:11] knees
[1:34:12] in this time of emergency when calamity
[1:34:15] after calamity is striking the earth
[1:34:17] we don't have to procrastinate anymore
[1:34:20] remember
[1:34:21] only the wise working that are all
[1:34:24] in the love which is the token which is
[1:34:26] the dynamics which is the creator deity
[1:34:28] stepping into the perfected adopted
[1:34:30] bride are the ones that went
[1:34:33] so what we now need in this time of
[1:34:36] emergency
[1:34:37] is to get this quality all perished but
