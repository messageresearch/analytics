[47:48] extracted from the invitation and every
[47:52] time we see these Bibles say anything
[47:54] it's a seed and it's absolutely and we
[48:01] are sought with the incorruptible seed
[48:04] of God and if a man will take any divine
[48:07] promise of God in his heart and what it
[48:12] would face it will produce just exactly
[48:15] what it said it would do the Prophet
[48:18] said Amen don't care what it is
[48:22] just take God's promise in your heart
[48:26] pray the Lord now some years but
[48:33] chandler's spoke about the bridge
[48:35] builder who in South Africa I think it
[48:39] was problem state the bridge builder had
[48:43] to build a bridge he must do it or lose
[48:47] his reputation because other people her
[48:53] comments said the job could not be done
[48:57] and this man came looked over the whole
[49:00] place and he told the person that wanted
[49:07] the bridge built as I can do the job you

[49:20] you could do it and the man said I'll do
[49:24] it pres a lot what was he going to lose

[49:35] reputation are you hearing me friends

[49:49] uh sought the world the seed is the word
[49:56] and will Malachi forced end of time
[50:01] message know that we have a reputation

[1:14:47] remain o because I live he shall live
[1:14:50] also oh my is it if the Old Testament
[1:14:54] Saints could think that what ought we to
[1:14:59] think this morning and I said this
[1:15:02] afternoon after 1900 years of seeing
[1:15:07] sufferings and toils and so forth
[1:15:10] knowing that we are right into the front
[1:15:13] door of the resurrection amen the church
[1:15:17] has moved right up to the hour now where
[1:15:21] the resurrection can come at anything
[1:15:28] and I'm thinking what would it mean to
[1:15:32] us at that day the believers what will
[1:15:36] it mean on the day I can see on that
[1:15:39] early morning when Matt and Mary went
[1:15:43] out to the grave they were coming along
[1:15:46] the side of the hill after a night think
[1:15:50] of that poor mother's heart her baby all
[1:15:53] the way when she was when it was born
[1:15:59] they said it was an illegitimate child
[1:16:03] very absolutely didn't belong to Joseph
[1:16:07] and
[1:16:07] and it was or it was Josef's and the
[1:16:12] where the baby was born out of holy
[1:16:15] wedlock she had all of that to go
[1:16:18] through I know think about your baby and
[1:16:24] I had been rejected and despised and
[1:16:28] spit yet he claimed it think of this
[1:16:33] message how it has been despised spit on
[1:16:37] whatever yet
[1:16:43] through whatever situation we still
[1:16:46] claim that the message of Malachi 4 is
[1:16:49] right but let's see how it went with
[1:16:56] Mary amen praise the Lord
[1:17:01] okay let me see where it was so she her
[1:17:08] ought to go through and think about your
[1:17:10] baby and how it been rejected and
[1:17:12] despised and spit on yet acclaimed it
[1:17:14] and she's somehow with a quivering heart
[1:17:19] said God brought me that baby how could
[1:17:22] it be seeing him yonder in that great
[1:17:26] crucial hour she thought surely when
[1:17:30] they went to put a crown of thorns on
[1:17:32] his head and beat him till the blood
[1:17:35] shot through his back striped him up and
[1:17:44] down and all these things she thought
[1:17:48] surely that any moment he will trot her
