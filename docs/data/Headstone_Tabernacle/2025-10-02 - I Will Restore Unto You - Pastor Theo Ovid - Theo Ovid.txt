========================================

Ed, Father, may you come and confirm your word to your people. Take me out of the way and be glorified in our midst tonight in Jesus name I ask it. Amen. You may be seated and give God some praises while you take your seat. Praise God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Hallelujah. The Bible said, "Behold, I send you Elijah the prophet before the great and territory of the Lord." &gt;&gt; So God sent Malachi 4 as the final sign before judgment. &gt;&gt; I want you to think about that. There's no need. There's no other sign to come. &gt;&gt; There's one sign. Behold, I send you Elijah the prophet before the terrible day of the Lord come. &gt;&gt; And Elas has already come. &gt;&gt; So, we know we have had the last sign. Is that right? &gt;&gt; So, Malachi 4 himself was God veiling human skin. &gt;&gt; According to Luke 17:30, &gt;&gt; according to Malachi 4, &gt;&gt; God veiling a man in the end time &gt;&gt; as a last sign before judgment. &gt;&gt; So, we are living in the judgment hour. What we have is blood applied. Mercy amidst judgment. &gt;&gt; That is what we have here right now. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The judgment is fixed. It cannot be cancelled. It cannot be changed. And whenever God send a prophet, it means he sending a word of warning that we could prepare ourselves. &gt;&gt; So once a prophet come on the scene, he comes with a word of warning. He come with blessing. He come with warning of oncoming judgment. &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; Praise God. We believe that. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Glory. &gt;&gt; Jesus final ministry was preaching to the eternal lost. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. His the quickening power brought him down to preach into hell &gt;&gt; to souls that cannot be saved. &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham saw that. That was Jesus pull &gt;&gt; preaching to the lost. So they got to have a ministry on the earth once more that will preach to the lost. &gt;&gt; So this is not a game. This is real. &gt;&gt; All the warnings, all the rebukes, all the instructions is that we might be prepared. Amen. &gt;&gt; The question that was asked and brother Martin asked the question when the son cometh shall he find faith on the earth. &gt;&gt; The amazing part about that scripture that is after Luke 17:30 &gt;&gt; that is that is Luke 18. After the Solomon being revealed the question was that shall he find faith in the earth &gt;&gt; or would unbelief hit the message world? with unbelief take over and we have to have to dismantle the unbelief &gt;&gt; and I am reading the scripture tonight and meditating on the scripture tonight wanting do people believe this &gt;&gt; that I will restore &gt;&gt; do people believe this thing here &gt;&gt; what God said in this word and God is not a man that would lie he said I will restore he's not dependent upon you for restoration he's saying what he will do and God can't lie oh give the Lord some praises God is going to restore all All the canerable, all what the palmer, all what the caterpillar, all what the locust, God himself said that and we believe that tonight he going to restore back another book of Acts. He going to restore back another day of Pentecost. He going to restore back another day of dynamics to the mechanics. God promised that. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I tell several ministers, brothers, &gt;&gt; one of the things that trouble me in the message was the unbeliever part. &gt;&gt; I understand true believer. &gt;&gt; I understand make believer. But the unbeliever in the message was a tough one. Now I realize it have unbelievers. &gt;&gt; It have preaching unbelievers. It have ministers who are unbelievers. Yet they quoting brother Brandham, but they don't believe this thing. They don't believe Joel too that God said I'm going to restore. And God say shall come to pass afterwards. I will pour my spirit. They don't believe you shall eat in plenty and be satisfied. They do believe he'll pour out upon sons and daughters of God, upon maids and handmaidadens when I pour in my spirit. Oh, old men will dream dreams. Oh, young men will see visions. The young men have a vision to fulfill the visions. The old men have to dream about it. Oh, the Lord, I shout. They're going to dream dreams, but young men going to see visions. Oh, give the Lord a shout in the house. We are here. You are people called out for his name's sake. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Glory to God. &gt;&gt; So when God called his prophets, he call them to give them give the prophet secrets &gt;&gt; to reveal to the people &gt;&gt; because we don't have a clue what going on. &gt;&gt; We don't God doesn't give the us the ability to know what's going on. &gt;&gt; That's why he's in a prophet &gt;&gt; to reveal what is happening, what has happened, and what will happen. &gt;&gt; Is the Lord a shout? So you talk about former rain and latter rain, right? &gt;&gt; Praise God. God sent Noah to warn them about the flood. Isn't that right? God sent Abraham give a warning concerning Sodom. God must them warning &gt;&gt; before judgment. Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. And God has reserved the six seals for the church members. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. For the foolish version, the sixth seal is there. The sixth seal is judgment. The bride is for the seventh seal. &gt;&gt; Under they have seven tenders under there. That's the card of the bride together. That's the gift by faith to fight the unbelief. Oh, blessed be the God. Seven voices, seven voices, seven thunders, seven thunders, seven virtues. Oh, seven manifestation of the Holy Spirit to fight the unbelief. God going to prevail in you. He say one day you're going to wake up and see God is in you. &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord some praises. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Is a message of rapture for the bride and judgment for the church. Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; So therefore, there must be a ministry to preach to the lost, not a book and tape ministry. That books and tapes are preaching to no loss. There's be a live bride. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Preaching to the lost. Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; So therefore, God sent this word to do it for a purpose &gt;&gt; to clean you, &gt;&gt; to wash you, &gt;&gt; to sanctify you, &gt;&gt; to prepare you &gt;&gt; for what is yet to come. &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord some praises. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Hallelujah. And we find out the Baptist almost take over the message. When you believe they have the Holy Ghost and that's false because all because the prophet said evidence of the Holy Ghost is when you receive the message. &gt;&gt; But he was talking to Pentecostals who claim to have the Holy Ghost. He said if you have this quickening power, if you have the spirit, you going to receive what I am preaching. &gt;&gt; And they turn it down. But here come a bunch of people from Catholic, Methodist, Hindu, Muslim, whatever, whatever, whatever. And believe this message and think they have the Holy Ghost because they believe the message. Even the devil believe and he trembling &gt;&gt; and he don't have the Holy Ghost. Even the devil believe and he's trembling and he doesn't have the Holy Ghost. The Holy Ghost is a promise of God. &gt;&gt; He told his receive the Holy Ghost. He wasn't talking about some mystery or some talk or some education. He was talking about as something to receive, something to possess, something that you must have. That's why he say you must be born again in of the word and of the spirit. So he sent the word to give you a seed in your soul. And then he sent the spirit to water that seed in your soul to give you an experience. Oh give the Lord a shout. I'm going to say it again. To give you an experience not without sensation with sensation with an experience something that you know that you are alive unto God. Oh give the Lord a shout in the house. Hallelujah. But when he talk about without sensation, he's talking about the person of Christ. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Glory to God. &gt;&gt; This is brother Bron. The Holy Spirit. You are believing unto eternal life. But when the Holy Spirit come, it is eternal life. &gt;&gt; You are begotten of the spirit at sanctification. begotten. &gt;&gt; That is womb and and and flesh upon flesh and and bone and everything adding and the cells the belly getting big and the baby being formed inside it. That's begotten. &gt;&gt; The born is when the baby come true. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Here he say now he said you are begotten of the spirit at sanification but never born of the spirit until the holy ghost comes in. &gt;&gt; That is correct. A baby got a life in the womb of the mother. &gt;&gt; Little muscles are quivering. It's a life, &gt;&gt; but it's a different life, but it breathes the breath of life into its nostrils. &gt;&gt; So the baby bouncing, kicking, and I feel a kick in his stomach. That is a different kind of life that he shouting, the praising God, hallelujah, glory. That he's singing specials and writing message song, all that. He's kicking. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But until the baby come forth, that's a different kind of a life. So you have a message life and have a born again holy spirit life. Would we give the Lord a shout in the house? I will say it again. Have nice message folks. But there I get the burnt there get the fire. The fire is what burn the snake out. They could baptize the snake still there. They could dip him in water seven times. The snake is still there. You can wash him with mysteries. The snake is still there until the fire come. Oh give the Lord a shovel need fire. Fire from God. Give the Lord some praises. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Brother Brandham, I read it again. He said, "A baby got life in the womb of their mother. Little muscles are quivering. It's a life, but it's a different life, but it breathes the breath of life into his nostrils. It's a different." He said, "My dear Methodist brother, Pilgrim, Holiness, Nazarene, the baptism of the Holy Ghost is different from sanctification. &gt;&gt; Sanctification is the cleansing, which is preparation of life. But when the Holy Ghost comes, it is life. &gt;&gt; Preparation is cleaning the vessel. The Holy Spirit is filling the vessel. &gt;&gt; Sanctification means cleaned and set aside for service. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost puts it in service. &gt;&gt; Then you are the vessel that God has cleaned up. &gt;&gt; Oh, do we get that tonight? Praise the name of the Lord. Hallelujah. Praise God. Praise God. So in the bride gets word on top of word on top of word because the prophet brought a board message. Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? And then the come upon that wood message like what Jesus did. Jesus breed upon them receiving the Holy Ghost. It wasn't the Holy Ghost when he said it. He just gave him a promise. But the Holy Ghost has yet to come. &gt;&gt; Oh give the Lord a shout in the house. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. One time he cried, "If any man test, let him come unto me and drink. And he that believeth on me, as the scripture had said, out of his belly shall flow raise of living water." This spake he of the Holy Ghost which was not yet given because Christ had not yet died. Oh get the Lord as though he is prophesying that a sin coming, a power coming, an anointing coming, a desperation coming. Hallelujah. If I don't go, comforter will not come. I will not leave you comfortless. I'm going to come to you. That's a while the world seeth me no more. But you are going to see me because I let you shall also. He was prophesying of what was about to come. And tonight we are here prophesying what is about to come. Who prophesied that? God said it. It shall come to pass afterwards. I will pour out. I will pour out. I believe that tonight. I don't want to stand in the unbelieving shoes. I want I believe that tonight. And if I believe that, I want to act on it. I want to create an atmosphere. I want to praise and worship God. [Applause] I believe &gt;&gt; you're going to pour his spirit. &gt;&gt; Not just generally, &gt;&gt; which is generally too, but you going to pour it on me. [Music] &gt;&gt; The title of the message tonight is I will restore to you. &gt;&gt; I want to stop it right there. To you. &gt;&gt; Not to every everybody. To you. &gt;&gt; You have to see how to have a personal restoration. &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord some praises. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Abraham didn't feel nothing. Abraham just believe God. &gt;&gt; He feel turning back. He feel you have a child. He say Sarah was in the flesh. Hallelujah. Sarah was under sanctification. Sarah was feeling feeling feeling feeling that when she felt that Abraham could take a &gt;&gt; hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But Abram was just believing what God said. God said so. God said so. That's the original faith. That was the faith in Abraham. That was the faith in Genesis. The original faith is not feelings, emotions, and you don't like this and they get in a fight like foolishness. The original faith is God said so and God is in a man that would lie. If God said it, it has to come to pass. Oh, give the Lord some praises. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. He said, "Rejoice. [Music] &gt;&gt; Rejoice because I'm going to do something. I'm going to cause something. I'm going to start something. Just start to shout. Start to rejoice. He said fear not to land and rejoice for the Lord will do great things. What can the Lord a shout? We don't have the US going up or down. We don't know what going on with the money, what going on with the economy, but God said rejoice because he is about to do great things. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Another scripture says, "Spread your bands. Spread your tent. Spread spread. Spread. Don't stay where you are. Show your expectation. Show what you believe. So where you think God is going to take you the Lord a shout in the house? I'm excited tonight. The devil didn't want this series, but God wanted it. He want to let you know I am going to restore unto you. I don't care what happened in your past. This is what you you're concerned in your future. [Applause] Lori, Lori, &gt;&gt; Sarah was in his in her flesh to tell Abraham, go and check. &gt;&gt; She seen with she eyes maybe, you know, she young. She she &gt;&gt; and look at look what he got produced. &gt;&gt; Look at Mary. &gt;&gt; Mary was in the spirit. &gt;&gt; Mary said, "Pay it done unto me &gt;&gt; according to thy word." Immediately when the angel spoke to her, Holy Ghost overshadowed the children to Elizabeth to say they're not having a baby. You know, &gt;&gt; somebody got said, "You feel anything?" No. You're emotional about something? No. You feel any sensation? No. I just believe what God said. &gt;&gt; Do you believe what God said? &gt;&gt; You come in the service all these years and the word coming word on top of word on top of word. Do you believe what God said? Do you believe what coming to you is the word and that word can't return void. He says, "So shall my word be that goes out of my mouth." Oh give the Lord a shout as you sow seed. Oh, glory to God. When a man saw a seed, you don't be looking at it, looking at it. You just sow it and walk away. And you know it going to come forth with the rain, with the sun, with the weather, it going to comfort. God said, "So shall my seed be." God send a seed out to go get that bride. Oh, give the Lord a shout. I don't care what church it was in. Go get that bride. And as we come down closing off to 2025, he's saying go get that elect before we preach the eternal loss. It has some lost people in the message. That's my fallen brothers. That's for fallen sisters. This is what the bride ministry is about. There's a five-fold ministry yet. Oh, give the Lord a shout. A five-fold ministry is going to come forth. Go get that bride. [Applause] Brother Brandon, &gt;&gt; he's talking about seeing the sea and the waves and so and beating up and so like that. And he talk about having the same amount of water is not no more new water. It's just turning up. He said revival is not so much bringing in new members but revive what you already got in you. &gt;&gt; You have seed your water but some get stale. They get dull, &gt;&gt; get tired, they get weary. Even the Bible say even young men shall faint and utterly fall but they that wait &gt;&gt; upon the Lord shall renew. &gt;&gt; Renew your strength. &gt;&gt; When an eagle get old crusted up against a rock and then they get young again. Renew your strength. When you get a revival in faith, a revival towards God, a revival in prayer, a revival in spirit, a revival to walk right, to talk right, to live right, to do right. It's a personal revival. It's an individual revival. It's not a church revival. It's your revival. And I'm going to restore to you. Oh, give the Lord some praises. He said, "Watch. God got the same amount of water. No more additional water, but it shake all the trash out of the water on the bank." &gt;&gt; So that is what a revival does. It whip it up to get all the sticks, &gt;&gt; all the crooked ways, all the trash off the back. That's what the church needs today is a revival. We will get we we we we we will get all the unbelief shook out of us until we can be clean. &gt;&gt; So that's why oft times it get a message like what it brings to stir to shake to rock. What for? To get the trash out the system &gt;&gt; because a purpose there. &gt;&gt; This message not getting rid of trash system. You know that message the trash getting rid of is for purpose. &gt;&gt; The cleansing of the is for purpose. God want to fill you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But he got fill up the trash inside. &gt;&gt; He got fill you when you already fill up. &gt;&gt; Come and turn you upside down and shake you out. &gt;&gt; When you turn your son, he shake out. Good. Right. Put your right side back up. And then he could pour something inside of you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. Now, Joe, let's go. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Me long with you because we most of the time we went with this. So, &gt;&gt; Job went by inspiration because he had no Bible to read. So Job wasn't a text man. &gt;&gt; Job wasn't an intellectual man. &gt;&gt; Job was a man that moving by inspiration. &gt;&gt; He was a prophet and he only had to be inspired because he know his position. &gt;&gt; So once you know your position, you don't go and pray and say Lord God. No, no, you know your position. &gt;&gt; So when Jesus had to pray for a sick or something, you don't have to say hallelujah, glory. And I woke up and said sweat. Jesus had to walk up and swe you know who he was. &gt;&gt; He said pick up your bed and walk. &gt;&gt; That's what I'm telling you to do. Pick up your bed and walk. He had faith to speak it. The man had faith to receive it. And the man pick up his bed and walk. Oh, give the Lord a shout. And the bride will have that same authority, supreme power and control. Because there's a faith from the innermost. There's a faith on your position. It's not a faith because the anointing is there. When the anointing there not have to do with that give the Lord a shout, these signs shall follow them that believe. It didn't say the pastor, the preacher, the elder or the deacon shall follow them. Not if you follow them, it shall follow you. Do you believe they're going to follow you? Oh, give the Lord some. You ought to believe that in them. When you look back, you're seeing signs. When you look back, you're seeing wonders. When you look back, you're seeing miracles following you. Oh, give the Lord some praises. Who said that? God said that. God said that. But over them is Pentecost. Tell you come message keep &gt;&gt; keep advance. &gt;&gt; The brother tell me now the message so dead to somebody so dead like in the Catholic church man preaching on people looking depressed. That's the worst &gt;&gt; in this message &gt;&gt; preaching on people looking depressed. &gt;&gt; How many you can look depressed? &gt;&gt; Read what the Bible say rejoice. The Bible said they were in the upper room praising and blessing God continually. [Applause] &gt;&gt; When the wise men saw the start, they rejoice with Bible script with exceeding great joy. &gt;&gt; They're not normal smiling, you know. They not that know exceeding great joy. &gt;&gt; What God doing? He's roughing you up. Let your rejoice be it happen. Let your shout be happen. You're not waiting to get a breakthrough to shout. You're getting your shout now. Your shout and your breakthrough coming after. You shout your healing coming after you. Praise God. And you [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; All right, let's go. &gt;&gt; So Job now the only thing had to happen for was for inspiration to strike him. &gt;&gt; So these guys were positionally placed and ready for the anointing to strike him. Amen. &gt;&gt; When they strike him so they could speak, right? &gt;&gt; That's the church. Here we go. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If it's in order. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Oh, the church have to come in order. &gt;&gt; Yes. You don't hear much about that, but that is in the word. The church itself have to come into order. &gt;&gt; What order? Man's order or God's order? &gt;&gt; Order. &gt;&gt; It's God's order. He said, but watch. If it's if it's in order, it got the mechanics ready. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; It only need the dynamics. &gt;&gt; Amen. Then he said this tonight if we could get the mechanics ready, &gt;&gt; get our hearts right. &gt;&gt; So that the mechanics then &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Not just text and mystery and words and quotes. No, get your heart right. There we go. The things that we can do &gt;&gt; and the things that you can do is the labor part, &gt;&gt; is the sanctification part, &gt;&gt; is the working part, &gt;&gt; is the hard part, is the grinding part. That is what you could do because you cannot produce dynamics. &gt;&gt; Come on, preach back to me. Preach back to me somebody. Let's go a little deeper here. Watch this. Follow him. What? Follow him in baptism. Follow him in every order he told us to do. Get every mechanic ready and stand there. &gt;&gt; Then we are ready for dynamics &gt;&gt; to be lit off. &gt;&gt; How you ready for dynamics and you had order against somebody &gt;&gt; that can't work. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You had condemn. &gt;&gt; You know you have a hindrance. You know you have some obstacle inside your life. &gt;&gt; You have to be clear &gt;&gt; about your own objective motive desires and everything else. Look at those brothers when B say have oil somewhere &gt;&gt; and them brother said boy if we get if they tell us what he say but can't use the gift of commercial &gt;&gt; you see if we get it we go go do this for the Lord and that for the Lord. &gt;&gt; All right they went and after they get a little oil there what for the Lord &gt;&gt; none for the Lord &gt;&gt; they gone only to find out they get it dripping &gt;&gt; and it drop after a while. &gt;&gt; See God was testing them. Yes. &gt;&gt; They say they say with the mouth they do for the Lord &gt;&gt; and when things people say you know when they get a blessing they do that for the Lord. Which Lord &gt;&gt; they are the Lord. &gt;&gt; They serve their own self. &gt;&gt; You see and afterwards now somebody come now and strike the main vein &gt;&gt; to vindicate the prophet did see oil down there. &gt;&gt; But them other guys church folks mind you. &gt;&gt; They had the wrong motive and objective. &gt;&gt; Something was messed up inside their heart &gt;&gt; called heart issues. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Is the inside job. Oh, praise God. As B say get heart attack that's inside job. &gt;&gt; Won't heart attack you inside job. &gt;&gt; So watch then we are ready for dynamics to be lit off and only God can do that. &gt;&gt; So there's no need to manufacture nothing. Amen. &gt;&gt; When when Elijah challenge them, let the God of answer my father let him be God gone. &gt;&gt; And them fellas carry on because they custom doing stuff you know them fell afraid for the challenge you know them them seven altars them fellas jump and cut the self and man god they carry on. They wasn't dead believers like me. You know the words on fire brother they off the word but they on fire. &gt;&gt; Blow them off the word but they on fire. That's a different kind of group all together. You know when he light when they finish so he say oh god like going for a trip boy only go but he going to bagel or go by the beach where only God go. You understand or go a little louder because he can not hearing because I ask you no fire. When his time come he said pour water. He restored the altar. He said pour water. You said pour water again because I I want them to know there's no kerosene. There's no diesel oil. There's no nothing under no wood there. I want you to know it's water, water, water, water. It's so wet. The fire had to come from God. Okay. The Lord I shout and God take the word. Seven seals, seven thunders. And we wet. We dripping with water. Water. Word. Word. Water. Water. They laugh at us. They mock us. Let them laugh. But we dripping with water. Water. But one day, the Holy Ghost and fire, the Holy Ghost and power. Oh, hallelujah. Let the God that answer my fire. Let that God be God. [Applause] &gt;&gt; This is going to be a short quick message tonight. Don't worry. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So, watch. When you get your heart right, when you follow everything you could do, you in baptism, whatever, and you stand there, we are ready for the dynamics. And only God can do that. Here we go. And this detail now that's to drop into your heart that faith that says I am now healed. &gt;&gt; So when when brother pray for the blind man and then make spend money come back in the prayer line because he other people healed man say you're healed. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; He's a Catholic his faith have to hold on to. &gt;&gt; His faith have not hold on to. So but a man tell him say by stripes I'm here. By strip I'm here. So he say by stripe I'm on here. What is happening there? Mental faith at work. &gt;&gt; His mouth. &gt;&gt; His mind. &gt;&gt; His mouth. His mind. By faith, I'm healed. By faith, I'm healed. By faith, I'm healed. And one day in the barber saloon, it dropped down to his heart &gt;&gt; and he was healed. &gt;&gt; Then he jump out the barber chair &gt;&gt; and the man finish cutting here. &gt;&gt; You understand what I'm saying? Then make half zed, half cut. He's out because he's now cut his own hair. He's out of the Bible chair because something connect from here to here. This is the problem. This is the unbelief. Subconscious unbelief. Unbelief you don't even know it's there. But when the word hit you, then you realize, wait a minute, when I look at myself, I have problems. I have issues. Do I believe what God said? It shall come to pass afterwards. I will pour out. I will restore. Oh can the Lord I shout when them conquer them crack the teeth and break down the God's tree when they come to the end they say that no more is a stump &gt;&gt; they walk away &gt;&gt; and God wait for it to come to a stump &gt;&gt; and baron said nothing is stopping it now &gt;&gt; I will restore Luther Wesley Pentecost William Brandon and here comes the bride nothing going to stop this bride it have false anointed it have unbelievers it have interpreters It's a pop center in the message &gt;&gt; that spirit bold you know &gt;&gt; that pill right coming in the message right trying to take over trying to make unity and not unity of the faith just unity and if you don't hear him he vex he upset &gt;&gt; go say unity you know he say unity of defaith &gt;&gt; then you have to go back to def faith &gt;&gt; to get it united give the Lord a shout and it don't have six faith and four faith and three faith you know it only have One faith. &gt;&gt; Eva has one Lord. &gt;&gt; Them crazy but seven thunders. Give that one faith. &gt;&gt; Oh give the Lord a shout in the house. &gt;&gt; That's a reserve faith. &gt;&gt; God leave that only for the bride. The church can have everything else. They can have trumpets, fires, woes, woman of the sun, pope, all kind of thing. They could have this mystery, hidden mystery, underground mystery and top mystery. &gt;&gt; All kind of mystery they could have. But you see the seven thunders that the mighty angel came and threw out. Oh give the Lord a shout. It have resurrection in that. It have rapture in that. It have change your body in that. Oh give the Lord some praises. I am preaching all this for no tribulation. Hallelujah. I'm preaching to leave you correctly. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory. What will happen on Sunday? Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; No, but preach started perfect man and night he preached blasphemous names. You can't really clarify or get it clean without really studying blasphemous name. Blasphemous names. Get clarity to what he preach in the morning. And then the blasphemous names. No blasphemous right in the morning. Okay. Is right. Then he preach that. So watch he said now when you talk about he say you say automobile. Now I've got several mechanics in the church and he said I'm not a mechanic but it has co coils plugs points valves &gt;&gt; to make up the automobile. &gt;&gt; Now when you talk about the baptism of the Holy Spirit &gt;&gt; there's a lot goes with that. &gt;&gt; He say there's a lot that goes with that. &gt;&gt; It have coils plugs and points into in the Holy Ghost too &gt;&gt; to make it up. It's not just one thing. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Now Peter now he is putting it back in the word. Amen. &gt;&gt; Peter said faith first. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Now watch. Add to your faith virtue, virtue, knowledge, knowledge, temperance, and from this bring in seven church ages and so on like that. Are you right? Then he said he has built a bride, born a bride. Hear the words begotten a bride on earth for Christ. &gt;&gt; And the same way he beggets his bride, he has begotten individuals. &gt;&gt; So the churches is a reflection of what's supposed to work in you. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; The church age people didn't wasn't conscious and aware what they were living out &gt;&gt; but they were rocking Satan's kingdom &gt;&gt; turning out God's life &gt;&gt; in every age. &gt;&gt; And what God sent the prophet to do was to gather the entire life. &gt;&gt; Now the Holy Ghost was born at the river Euphrates &gt;&gt; because of priests and dogmas &gt;&gt; like an electric wire. You can't put a PVC pipe and say current flowing through that. &gt;&gt; Water will flow through a PVC pipe, &gt;&gt; not current. &gt;&gt; It have to have a wire for it to flow. &gt;&gt; And through the ages because the word was broken, the wire was cut. &gt;&gt; What brother Brandham did, he stitched the wires together, &gt;&gt; connected through seven angels. And once the wire line up and he jam it and flick the switch, &gt;&gt; it start to flow through the current start to flow. And this is the same thing he want in his last day that he can said there is my spirit flowing freely from them men. &gt;&gt; That's why I keep saying the first sign of the ministry of Jesus Christ is virtue &gt;&gt; going out &gt;&gt; from the man's body. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because when virtue come at Christ, the woman say he say he say um she say um he say who touched me? &gt;&gt; Watch this. The disciples say everybody touching you. Where's the point? &gt;&gt; They miss the boat clean. He said, "No, I feel I felt a drawn. &gt;&gt; Somebody pulled something out of me. &gt;&gt; That woman pulled virtue." And when Jesus saw the woman, he said, "Thy faith." &gt;&gt; Look where virtue is in the pyramid. And look where faith is. &gt;&gt; Faith is at the bottom. And what's next? &gt;&gt; Virtue. So faith pulls virtue. &gt;&gt; Virtue is power. Power to stop the blood issue. Power to heal you. Power to give you the breakthrough. Give me a scripture. As many as receive him, to them gave he power to become. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Is that instant power to become? &gt;&gt; So God give you a start &gt;&gt; that you could run to the finish. &gt;&gt; So with your faith, you pull down virtue. &gt;&gt; Virtue left me. I'm feeling weak. Brother, &gt;&gt; now these things here &gt;&gt; talking about the temperance and everything else virtues must be in the Christian s &gt;&gt; before the Holy Spirit &gt;&gt; ever seals them. &gt;&gt; And makes a complete unit. &gt;&gt; He's not talking about the baptism now. &gt;&gt; He's talking about the person of Christ. &gt;&gt; He's talking about the Holy Spirit &gt;&gt; coming and seal the virtues in. &gt;&gt; Then you become a living moving monument. Then you become a vindicated son. Then you become a vindicated daughter. Every devil in hell know your name. Okay. The Lord I shout. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Then sister gave him a dream. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Sister shepherd. &gt;&gt; We know the dream. &gt;&gt; And she was wondering if she had the Holy Ghost. Yes. &gt;&gt; And in the dream, she said, "I dreamed she was up on a mountain." &gt;&gt; Now, if I didn't feel that, I know we know it. If I didn't feel it to say tonight, I was going to say it. &gt;&gt; A reason why I saying this thing tonight. &gt;&gt; I want to show the context of the message. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; She dreamed she was up a mountain and this mountain she says now she saw a large man standing there with work clothes on, sleeve rolled up, bailing, bailing the most pure water she ever seen, &gt;&gt; pouring into this box. this rock box sitting on the top of the mountain and the rock box would not hold the water. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It rolled right out of there and just boiled up all the trash and sticks and everything in there and boiled it out and rolled down the mountain and it rolled over her feet and she was standing there right in that stuff only it didn't stick to her. And when she asked why the box didn't hold it, the man said, "That is not water." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Nothing will hold it. &gt;&gt; And then he went and got another big bucket. It was full of honey. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And he poured honey into there. Said, "Now it will hold this." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do people still believe this message? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do people still believe what he is saying here? &gt;&gt; Now she thought the box was a rock box. It was going to burst out and spill the honey, but it didn't. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It finally stuck together. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And held it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; She turned, went down the mountain, going on the mountain, she stopped at the bottom of the mountain. She saw five streams of pure Christian water, not contaminated with the things it has went through. &gt;&gt; Isn't that the dream says the shepherd? No more. I picked up the letter and opened it. I saw her dream. &gt;&gt; So now she wrote the dream, but now he's seen a vision &gt;&gt; of the dream itself. Yes. &gt;&gt; So that is how we end up interpreting the dream. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. Let's go now. Now &gt;&gt; here how he backdrop this dream. Now you cannot make a holy church. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; There's no such thing as a holy church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So so so you sisters were in just above the knee. Well, I I I I didn't know that but somebody come inside here somebody seat that way they tolerating and they're judging the whole church by one person that they don't even know if they are saints you know or if they just come inside just get baptized in Jesus name. &gt;&gt; You see what I'm saying? &gt;&gt; And yet this prophet said you cannot make &gt;&gt; a holy church &gt;&gt; there is no such thing as a holy church &gt;&gt; or a holy organization. &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit can be preached in it &gt;&gt; but in there you find good &gt;&gt; bad Renegades, &gt;&gt; indifferent, &gt;&gt; and everything else. Everything else means everything else. &gt;&gt; Everything else. &gt;&gt; I even like to talk about everything else tonight. &gt;&gt; There's the next sermon all together. Let me leave everything else alone. &gt;&gt; So an organization will not hold it. &gt;&gt; You can't say we got it. None of the rest of them has it. Our ministers preaching that &gt;&gt; not exact words, &gt;&gt; but their life and the reflection of arrogance and pride on their believers reflect that they believe this. &gt;&gt; I want to repeat that. &gt;&gt; They're not saying these exact will be on the pullpit but their life and the arrogance and attitude and pride of their believers reflect this &gt;&gt; that we have it &gt;&gt; and the others don't have it. So we are special and the rest of you in other words like we &gt;&gt; we are able That's exactly right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So watch. So an organization will not hold it. You can't say we got it. None. The rest of them has it. No sir. The Holy Spirit is poured out on individuals. &gt;&gt; Well, that should make you shout tonight. &gt;&gt; That should make you This should be the greatest revelation striking you &gt;&gt; that the Holy Ghost, you don't need a church for the Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; because the Holy Ghost is part of individual. You get bought it in your bathroom. You get bought it in your bedroom. You get bought it in the drawing room. You can pour it in your kitchen. You get poured on your in your car. &gt;&gt; You get p on you in the church. &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit is poured on individuals. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So the man pouring the water was brother. Yes. &gt;&gt; This was the seals, &gt;&gt; the thunders, &gt;&gt; the mysteries, &gt;&gt; the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The revelation because the mysteries of God come from God is the word of God. And this word was supposed to boil out &gt;&gt; the trash &gt;&gt; trash. &gt;&gt; In order to receive &gt;&gt; the honey. &gt;&gt; I know people make light of this. Every time I talk about honey canisters, somebody tell me I have fake B can them check my B can fake them have a thermometer that checks whether B kind is real or not. Anyhow, leave that alone. Now look where brotherly kindness is &gt;&gt; and on top of brotherly kindness is the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Therefore you can't access Holy Spirit &gt;&gt; outside of brotherly kindness. &gt;&gt; So let's change Jesus prayer a bit. When you stand praying &gt;&gt; for charity, &gt;&gt; forgive, &gt;&gt; forgive, &gt;&gt; if you have ought against any, &gt;&gt; let's change it further. When you stand praying for dynamics, &gt;&gt; amen. &gt;&gt; Because if you can't manifest bodily kindness, you're short and mechanic. &gt;&gt; Because bodily kindness, the blood have to be displayed. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Because that's a virtue for our age. &gt;&gt; God put it correctly. So the bride, yeah, listen carefully. Have to be positionally placed. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. on the seventh step &gt;&gt; to receive the groom. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Do you get it tonight? &gt;&gt; Let me say it again. &gt;&gt; The bride has to be placed positionally. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; On the seventh step. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To receive the groom. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What is below bod is godliness. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; To be like God. &gt;&gt; That's a godly man. &gt;&gt; And yet on top of that godliness, God say you have to get somebody on top of that godliness. &gt;&gt; Godliness alone can't make it. &gt;&gt; Give the Lord a shout in the house. &gt;&gt; You have to act to godliness. brotherly kindness. &gt;&gt; God have to see the spirit of forgiveness. &gt;&gt; Look at Joseph. The quote in him wasn't by chance. Look at Joseph when his brothers came. Now if Joseph was a train, you know what happened? When the brothers come &gt;&gt; wood, you know, not wood, you know, wood cut a piece of wood and licks. You're so wicked, so long. That mean unconverted unchang now and the same v temper and anger talk about the man dying and the man said of foolishness dead don't change you &gt;&gt; if you're a foolish man you're dead a foolish man &gt;&gt; Joseph says to his brethren these wicked men they were wicked very hard. &gt;&gt; You know, it wasn't wicked. &gt;&gt; He told those wicked brethren, God, not you. &gt;&gt; God, &gt;&gt; send me ahead &gt;&gt; to preserve life. &gt;&gt; That's a powerful man. &gt;&gt; That's a man who have a lot of grace for you. &gt;&gt; Because that they make him learn a new language. They make him hit a new culture. They make him leave him in a whole new environment. They could let his father grieve and father suffer in tears because he lost his favorite son. &gt;&gt; And yet he was sent ahead to save the entire world by putting a pyramid in Egypt. And when all other bands are empty, only Jose B of green. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. I have a time tonight when all the bands are empty. &gt;&gt; Only ch band of green. What was Joseph sent for? To warn them. We have seven years plenty coming &gt;&gt; and seven years of famine. &gt;&gt; Get ready. Get ready. Get ready. &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord a shout. &gt;&gt; Malachi 4. What did he come to do? Judgment is coming. &gt;&gt; Get ready. Get ready. &gt;&gt; Today Putin had a dry run of nuclear warming warning for the entire nation &gt;&gt; because Trump Trump sent a nuclear you say he sent a nuclear submarine close up to Russia. Now if he didn't say that he might not do nothing but now that you see that &gt;&gt; as you see that &gt;&gt; so alarms went out all over Russia and they know what to do. &gt;&gt; We don't even have a basement. &gt;&gt; Them have bunkers &gt;&gt; things to go along to hide to protect. We we we don't even have a subterranean. Forget it. &gt;&gt; Bible says is a small thing in court. &gt;&gt; My lord. So we find out that the messenger, right? So watch this man. Okay. So this tabernacle we will see that's where she comes to church. This tabernacle. Listen to these words &gt;&gt; and you could see if people really believe the prophet but George. This tabernacle is not a Holy Ghost tabernacle. &gt;&gt; There is no such a thing. &gt;&gt; Individuals that come into this church &gt;&gt; is Holy Ghost tabernacles. &gt;&gt; There are tabernacles that contain the Holy Ghost, &gt;&gt; but not the church in the body &gt;&gt; or a group. &gt;&gt; Therefore, it runs out. Amen. &gt;&gt; So that's why the church the box couldn't hold the Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; because the Holy Ghost is not going into that box. It boil the trash out but the Holy Ghost goes into individuals &gt;&gt; so watch &gt;&gt; they are tabernacles contain the Holy Ghost not the church in the body or group. Therefore it runs out. Mission come please. Now this man, here we go. Who was pouring the water, the messenger to the church, &gt;&gt; pouring the message into the church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That is the seals. &gt;&gt; That's the thunders. &gt;&gt; That is the mysteries. &gt;&gt; Both written and hidden. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They like to talk that talk. So talking that talk too are written mysteries and hidden mysteries. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; So that the whole message &gt;&gt; was poured into the church &gt;&gt; and the objective of it was to clean it out. &gt;&gt; Amen. to pour honey. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Because the Holy Ghost is only coming on &gt;&gt; honey. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Let's fight that. &gt;&gt; That's why that's why God tell John the one &gt;&gt; who you see the dove &gt;&gt; resting and remain &gt;&gt; not one without order day. &gt;&gt; Because sometime the dove rest and not remaining. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; You see, oh, I see a dove hit him &gt;&gt; and you look back just gone. &gt;&gt; Gone. &gt;&gt; Amen. The dough can't stay &gt;&gt; when you start to react. So say you catch so &gt;&gt; that is doing it this way. He said do it the other way. &gt;&gt; I know me coming. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; There's a wolf there. You understand I'm saying? So that dove meow meow dove landing think a cat thinking humble thinking lamblike. And when the arrogance come up and the temper come up and the attitude come up say I gone. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he does not fire the dove on a little waiting. He's waiting for you to change. &gt;&gt; He's waiting for you to adjust. He's waiting for you to repent. He's waiting for you to get a different kind of attitude and atmosphere and spirit because the lamb only hanging up with dove. Dove only hanging up with lamb. &gt;&gt; Dove and wolf don't mix together. &gt;&gt; Let me finish. &gt;&gt; This man was pouring the water, the message of the church. Pouring the message into the church. But what was the water doing? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It was boiling all the trash out of it. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; That is what the Holy Spirit does. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It boils it out. &gt;&gt; Now the honey. There we go. This is brother Ram teacher, not this brother over teaching. The honey represented brotherly love. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brotherly kindness which is this age. &gt;&gt; And you say I shout like brother Jones. I shout like brother Jones sometimes. But let something happen to him. Your heart is broke because we can obtain brotherly kindness and feeling for one another. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why you can't be brotherly kindness by yourself. You go shake your hands. Happy birthday to me. Washing in the mirrors and tell yourself I love you. That makes no sense. In a group is where there are issues, problems, you know, disappointment. That is where you get to exercise this thing called brotherly kindness. &gt;&gt; Why do you care for that brother? Because you book bread with him. &gt;&gt; You was at the altar. I'm going to close. You fellowship with him. You shook his hands. Here we go. You worship with him. He's your brother. Now, he might do something in the flesh that you would disagree with. And because you just kind of stay which you ought to do and shun him a little bit, but in the bottom of the heart, if something happened to that brother, it would nearly kill you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, "No." And then he went and continuing on. Oh my. I'll close with this quote here. We continue on Sunday. Before this body can ever be perfected, the spirit will bring it in submission to God. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; To make you &gt;&gt; That's a big one. &gt;&gt; It's a war all the time. A constant war. Paul said, "When I will do good, evil is near me." &gt;&gt; There's a constant war, the flesh against the spirit. &gt;&gt; But he prophesied that the spirit will bring it in submission. You got a soul beside your senses. God never give you those senses to trust him with. God give you his spirit to trust. &gt;&gt; Your senses is only to contact, see, smell, taste, and hear and so on. All right. I I had done here already. No, I'll leave it at this. But I close with this line at top of I thought I had here. The spirit here we go. Will bring the people right back to where they were at the beginning. Amen. &gt;&gt; So when God say I'll restore and you know the prophet said this the the the uh when the church is believing that the same Holy Spirit &gt;&gt; is just as real &gt;&gt; as it was at the day of Pentecost. &gt;&gt; How they are born and positionally born. He is saying that we are going right back to that. &gt;&gt; I will restore. Let's all stand &gt;&gt; and give God some praise and begin to pray. Father God we thank you for tonight. We thank you for your presence and spirit. May you have the prayer minister among your people. We commit their lives unto thee. In Jesus name I ask it. Amen and amen. God bless you.
