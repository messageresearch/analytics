are grateful and we acknowledge your goodness and your grace towards us father keep and preserve your people I may you bless them tonight as we approach your word interesting we ask it amen God bless you I'm excited about tonight to see what we'll always do in your heart in your life and tonight I have a thought I'd like to share with you and this is from taking some stuff from out of it just do scriptures tonight sharing with you about this early church and this early church after receiving the Holy Ghost they wrote a book of Acts and it has been spoken that if the tree put forth another original Branch it would be another book of Acts we know every seed being fought after this crying baptism Baptist letter discipline Methodist you always testing your witness Every Single Seed will bring forth of these kind but this biblical seed of your original feet of our heart turned back to defeat of the fathers must produce the original kind that he had in the book of Acts and prayer as we are about to do tonight was an integral part of what they did in the book of Acts so I want to read if I have your Bibles with you you could run with me I'll quote the scripture and I know I would share this afterwards with you I'll put this uh the scriptures on this text up and just want that you could look at it again because this is what we're going back to all right acts 1 14. and I want to read from dear this is before acts 1 8 was released Jesus said you shall receive power after the Holy Ghost count on you so the promise to these ordinary folks like you and I was to receive power and this power was to come after the Holy Ghost come not after Stillman not after uh guarding together joining Church something must have called pundit and this is acts 1 all right acts 140. these all continued with one Accord in prayer and supplication with the woman and Mary the mother of Jesus which is better so the entire Bunch was still they all continued with one Accord in prayer and his application with the woman and Mary the mother of Jesus acts 1 23 26 we know Judas he fell off the scene and and from verse 23 they wanted to know who is to replace Judas because before fire fell before the fire would fall the church had to be such an order so rihad was to still have this correct number which was 12 Apostles and Judas was one of them of course he betrayed Christ and then it was down to 11. so they had to stick somebody in there and God reflecting on showing how things have to be in order before this Dynamic power strike the church so acts 1 23 it says and they appointed to Joseph called bathabath was the name Justus and Matthias now here we go verse 24 and they prayed and said Lord so it wasn't a matter of taking a brother and say all right I think you should tell him no they prayed and said look thou Lord which lowers the hearts of all men show whether of these two that was took me that he may take part of this ministry an apostleship from which Judas by transgression fell that he might go to his own place and they gave for their lots and the Lord fell upon Matthias and he was numbered with the 11 apostles let's go to Acts 2. I'm going to read from verse 39 this is after the king of the upper room now remember the power fell down they were all filled with the Holy Ghost they start out like drunk men and Peter began to speak to them and when they asked what shall we do to be safe he said repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the mission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost and from verse 39 is what we want to read tonight Peter continued for the promise which is this Holy Ghost is unto you and to your children and all that are files even as many as the Lord Our God child called so if God is calling today this promise is still applicable I mean again for this promise which is the Holy Ghost promise is unto you and your children to them that are far off Gentiles even as many as the Lord of abortion called and with many other words that he testify and exhorts him save yourself from this unto us generation look at verse 20 41. then did gladly receive his word were baptized and the same day they were added unto them about three thousand Souls but this is the verse I want to get to verse 42 and they continued steadfastly not in today or tomorrow not one service and then yes here for next three services no they continued steadfastly in the apostles Doctrine one and fellowship two and in Breaking of bread which is communion tree and in prayers so that's why don't we do that again verse 42 and they continued steadfastly in the apostles Doctrine and fellowship in Breaking of bread and in Prince and fear Came Upon every soul and Many Wonders and signs were done by the apostles praise the Lord so this is how God wants us this is what we have to strive onto to be steadfast in the doctrine steadfast in Fellowship that fast in breaking up break communion and steadfast in prayer you shouldn't miss a Friday pregnancy you should always strive to be in it and get God blessing and get God grace and and God's grace remember is Sovereign and God could open up a door for you tonight open up a channel for you tonight by the word and by history let's turn to act three and we want to look at Peter and John and the Bible talk about the Hour of Prayer and look what happened and you know we always talk about none and so on like that but just look what happened prior to that Acts chapter 3 verse 1. now Peter and John went up together into the temple at The Hour of Prayer being the ninth hour so you could see that the atmosphere was one of Prayer this book of Acts was there was interdisting deep into it and a certain man lean from his mother's womb was carried whom they laid daily at the Gate of the temple which is called Beautiful to ask arms so they brought this Layman put him in from the temple where people passed in uh of them that entered in the temple who seen Peter and John about to go into the temple ask an arms and Peter fastened his eyes upon him with John said look on us and he gave heed unto them expect him to receive something of them and Peter said Silver and Gold Have I None but such as I have give ID in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise upon and he took him by the right hand and lifted him up and immediately his feet and anklebone receives fate and he's leaping up stood and walked and entered with them into the temple walking and leaping and praising God I trust you are feeling the anointing that I am feeling here right now while reading God's word so this is Peter he's going up to pray and he is this is his custom now this is not uh no one again stuff he is regular he is steadfast he's going to pray he all our prayer the quality our prayer line Tower and so on like that and here it is this man was completely delivered acts 4 and this is where the Dynamics of this church will be a refilling of the Holy Ghost and Peter given testimony after they get blues and everything else acts 4 we want to take it up from verse 22. so I kind of just leave another old stuff you can go back and read the whole chapter from the very beginning but I'm going to start from verse 22. for the man was about 40 years old this man who was here on whom this miracle of even was showed I'm being let go they went to their own company so after they get the blues because now the power is on demonstration Christ being reproduced they thought Jesus was dead but now this resurrected spirit this Dynamic this power resident permanent part in the lines of these disciples and Dickens and Believers is on display and the devil is mad so the devil anointing the authorities to come down on the Church of this of course we know we repeat when the power and the presence and the signs and wonders and miracles begin to unfold then the devil going to anoint the authorities and and so on to come down on the church the real elect Church by laws and everything else to force and shut us down let's continue and being let go they went to their own company and reported all that the chief priests and Elders had said unto them and when they heard that here we go this is corporate now this is a bunch now they lifted up their voice to God we'd want to call and said Lord God gone which has made heaven and dead and the Sea and all that in them ears who by the mountain by Stephen David has said why did the Hebrew reach and the people imagined vein thing the king of the earth stood up and rulers were gathered together against the Lord and against his Christ forever truth against thy holy Child Jesus whom that was anointed both arid and Pontius Pilate with the Gentiles and the people of Israel were gathered together for to do whatsoever thy hand and I come to determine before to be done and now Lord behold their treatments and Grant unto thy servants with all boldness that they may speak Thy Word by stretching forth dying hand to heal so these brothers wasn't backing up they was asking God to drop on us more signs and wonders power to heal by stretching for the hand to heal and that signs and wonders may be done by the name of thy holy Child Jesus all glory to God my God and the verse verse 31 says and when they had prayed that's the title of what I want to have tonight when they had prayed and when they had prayed and this when they had prayed when you are free tonight when they are prayed the place was shaking where they were simple together and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and they speak the word of God with boldness now this feeling of the Holy Ghost and acts 4 is a refilling of the Holy Ghost that the god in Acts 2 so Acts 2 they were filled with the Holy Ghost and they come back and get Phil again it's like a second filling we call it a refilling they were refilled but the Holy Ghost and they speak the word of God with pullness or give God Lots on Praises tonight I trust you are blessed by the word just a few more praise God and this is how the birth of deacons what we call deacons in the church and in those days this is Acts chapter six if you want to find it Well one to seven and in those days when the number of the disciples was multiplied with more disciples they arose I'm rumoring on the grecians against the Hebrew we call their widows when neglected in the daily Ministry situations so in other words because of the volume of work because of the volume of people because the volume of needs there were gaps in the administration operation we have got some resources called Help Us those gaps will be filled continue to pray for us verse two then the twelve called the multitude of the disciples under their mindset it is not a reason that we should leave the word of God and serve tables wherefore brethren look ye among you seven men of honest report full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom whom we may appoint over this business but we will give ourselves continually to prayer unto the ministry of the world understand please the whole multitude and they show Stephen A Man full of Faith one and of the Holy Ghost and Philip and procterus and nikano and Timon and palmina and Nicholas apostolite of Antioch whom they set before the apostles who glory to God and when they had prayed they lead the hands on them so it wasn't a matter of telling Brothers do this and do that and do that no the order was they brought him before the apostles and they prayed and then they lay hands upon them that they will be anointed to serve tables to help the widows to whatever needs people have at the difference this is where that was born those seven says and the will of God increased and the number of the disciples multiplied in Jerusalem greatly and a great company of priests were obedient to defeat ask it we want to look at verse 14 to 70. and this is a great one this is a powerful scripture as I said I'm excited tonight because see where we are going I see what God is pointing to you too and how we're going to get there ask it verse 14 to 17. now when the apostles which were at Jerusalem hood that Samaria I received the word of God they sent unto them Peter and John so Samaria got the word why are they sending Peter and John no we have been taught that Peter and John they had the full syndrome a life could only come from the body and they were part of that body and in the body of Jesus Christ and they were carrying life life was coming out their lips the spirit spoken it was God's spirit and then that was speaking and listened to why they sent Peter schools 15 who when they came down prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Ghost now these people have received the word the seed these people had the seed in them in their soul as we would see today they have the seed in his soul and they can't say well obviously some more wood no no no no not yet when they will come down prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Ghost why verse 16 explains why for as yet he who is he the Holy Ghost was Fallen upon none of them only they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus so these were believers that received the message of the hour and they were baptized in Jesus name but they had not yet received the Holy Ghost because he was informed upon none of them verse 17 gave the chiote that or the answer to that then laid the hands on them and they received the Holy Ghost they received what the Holy Ghost what did they receive the Holy Ghost Acts 9. and this is Peter now acts 9 36-42 let's continue and we want to jump verse 36 now there was a chopper a certain disciple named Tabitha which by interpretation is called Dorcas this woman was full of good works oh that is great that is very good she was what full of good works and arms Deeds which he did and I came to pass in those days that she was sick and died whom when they had washed they lead her in the upper chain and for as much as Lydia was 90 Chopper and that his father had fear that Peter was dear they sent unto him two men Desiring him that he should not delay to come to them in other words come quickly okay sister has died then Peter arose went with them and when he come they brought him into the upper chamber and all the widows stood by weeping and showing the coats and garments which doctors need while she was with them but Peter glory to God put them all fought and look at his posture look Peter's approach and kneel down and prayed so this thing about kneeling down is part of that posturing before God okay you have an opportunity you could sit and pray stand and pray you could also knead and pray but Peter kneeled on and prayed and turning him to the body said Tabitha arise and she opened her eyes and when she saw Peter she sat up and he gave her his hand lifting her up and when he had called the sins and widows presented her alive oh glory to God that is that had to be some kind of experience and and verse 42 said and it was known throughout all Japan and many believed the Lord praise the Lord could we give the Lord some Praises Right Where You Are Tonight okay ask them familiar one and this is about Cornelius acts 10 verse 1 there was a certain man in switzera at this area called Cornelius a centurion of the band called The Italian so this man is not a Jew the Gentile and those two describes this man a default man who won that fear God with all his house which gives much arms to people and pray to God always I was thinking about this how this man who don't even know the real God praying to God all these verse 29 and this is I just skipping right I want to read all about jumping from 2 to 29 so Peter was asking him what what what what what made you stand for me and he said full screen I therefore came I unto you without getting seeing because Peter had a vision and we know the story as soon as I was sent four I asked therefore for what intent you have sent me and Cornelius said now this is Cornelius Testament four days ago I was fasting until this hour now this man is not a Jew but he was fasting until this hour at the ninth hour I prayed in my homes and behold a man stood Before Me In Bright closing and said Cornelius thy prayer is heard thine arms are hard and remembered in the sight of God send their footage up call hit us Simon whose surname is Peter he is lodged in a house of one Simon atana by the seaside very specific you can't miss this with God's GPS he tell you exactly where to go who to call UDA fight and when he comment shall speak unto thee now this is an angel addressing Cornelius a angel is the messenger but the angel can't release life the angel can point you to somebody in the body that can release life but it's 33 immediately therefore I sent to thee and thou has well done that thou art come now before are we all here present before God to hear all the things that are commanded of thee of God and Peter opened his mouth and said our truth I perceive that God has no respecter of persons but in every nation he that feared him and look at righteousness is accepted with him so when they begin to testify and preach the word to tell the house of Cornelius and verse 44 said while Peter yet speak these words the Holy Ghost fell the same holy ghost that we talked about just before the same holy ghost that people don't want in this hour now because they figure they are something higher the same only goes that this message came to pointers back to the face of the fathers this same Holy Ghost fell on all them that heard the word and they of the circumcision which believe was punished as many as came with Peter because that on the genitals was also poured out that's the word no poured out the gift of the Holy Ghost Acts 12. you want to read verse from verse 1. I believe this is important tonight so I have to complete this so you have to forgive me but this is tremendously important and I believe that the Lord want this shared with you tonight acts 1 acts 12 rather reading from verse 1 and about that time Herod the king stretched for his hand the back footing of the church and he killed James the brought up John with the sword so here in a bad mood here and some demons upon this guy for Street and because he saw it please the Jews he proceeded further to take Peter also they then were the days of the unleavened bread and when he had apprehended him he put him in prison this is Brother Peter delivered him to four or three quaternions of soldiers to keep it intended after Easter to bring him forth to the people so this dude have his plans verse 5. Peter therefore was kept in prison but here we go church and this is important tonight but prayer was made without season of the Church of God for him no you have often heard that prayer changes things and I want you to know it does individual prayer and corporate prayer the church was informed that Peter was in prison and they had Believers that was bringing without ceases they will continue to praying for Peter verse 6 when Herod would have brought him forth the thing like Peter was sleeping Between Two Soldiers born with teens and the keepers before the dog kept the prison and behold here we go the angel of the Lord came upon him a light shine in the prison he smoked Peter on the side raised him up saying arise quickly and his chains fell off from his hands the angel said good thyself buying on thy standards and so he did and he said unto him cast thy garment upon thee and follow me no it is Barefoot he didn't say come with me would there be a foot and run out with a big Stone you have all kind of stuff there he said buying on your sandals put on your shoes get your garment including one and follow me and he went out followed him and was not if it was true which was done by the Angels he taught he saw a vision and when they were passed the first and the second ward they came onto the Iron Gate that leaded into the city which opened them on his own accord and they went out passed on to one street and fought with the angel departed from him in other words the mission of the Angel was over his commission was to get Peter out when Peter come to himself Peter was in the days Peter almost thought he was a vision he said no I know maturity that the Lord had sent his Angel not all of this is an ebuka act in just coming to the rescue Angels assisting you the ministry of angels okay sent his angel had delivered me out of the hand of Herod and from all the expectation of the people of the Jews and when he had considered the thing he came to the house of Mary the mother of John whose city was Mark where many were gathered together praying go give the Lord some prison many were gathered together pray praying for Hope praying for Peter and as Peter knock on the door adamzel came and happened named Rhoda and when she saw Peter and heard Peter knew Peter's voice she opened up the gates for gladness but ran him and told how Peter stood at the gate so she she got so excited she didn't even open the gate she just said pizza oh dear understand but she constantly affirmed that it was even so then said the it is his Angel oh they see it is the Sea of an e but Peter continue knocking and when that opened the door I saw him they was punished but he beckoning them with him the hand to hold their peace declared unto him or the Lord had brought him out of the prison he said go show these things unto James unto that Brethren and he departed and went another place as soon as it was dead there was no small still among the soldiers what has become of Peter oh praise and he also we're almost done it's 14 23. this is how the elders were ordained one versus 123 and when they had ordained them elders and when they had ordained them Elders in every Church and had prayed with trusted so now there are times when they just pray alone there are times they pray and lay hands and they also prayed with fasting I like to call that Amplified prayer and when they are prayed with fasting they commended them to the Lord these Elders on whom they believed acts 13 1-4 this is how ministers were sent out no they were in the church acts 13 verse one you're going to read it no they were in the church that was at Antioch certain prophets and teachers as Barnabas and Simeon that was called Niger and Lucius of Cyrene and mana and manayan which had been brought up with Herod at the church and so on as they minister to the Lord and fasted the Holy Ghost said separate me panamas and soul for the work we're on to I have called them and when they are fasted and prayed here we have it again laid hands on them and they send them away so they're being sent forth by the Holy Ghost the president and from density still disciples and I believe this is the final reading we have tonight are we getting in prayer and this is acts 16. we want to read verse 20. okay so low they come to complain about Paul Silence Paul acts 16 20 and brought them to the magistrate and said these men being Jews do exceedingly trouble our city and teach Customs which are not lawful for us to receive leaders to observe the enrollments and the multi rules up together against them and the mother Street rent off their clothes and command it to beat them okay this is Believers this is Apostles this is Prophet Paul getting blows okay so if you get Blues they'll say you know I mean the Lord forsake me and I ain't supposed to get that now let's read the scriptures this is acts we're talking about okay watch and the multitude rules up against them and the management rent off their clothes for money to beat them and when they had laid many stripes upon them they cast them into prison leaks past prison there's a powerful combination charging the Jailer to keep them safely who haven't received such a charge trust them in the inner prison and made their feet fast in the stocks so their feet was iron on them they're in an inner prison and because they have a charge to keep them safe who's 25 but at midnight we'll give them out some Praises tonight Paul and Silas pray what did they do they prayed and some Praises unto God and the prisoners with them she was not kind of whispering him they were praying they were calling upon God so suddenly you know who the prophet said you had to do something and suddenly there was a great little creek so that the foundations of the prisoner were shaking and immediately all the doors were open and everyone bands were loosed or praised me of the Lord and The Keeper of the prison awakened out of his sleep and seeing the prison doors open if we saw it I would have killed himself supposedly not the prisoners had fled but Paul cried will love us say do do lights have no harm for we are all here and then he called for a light sprung in and came trembling and fell on me for Poland Silas and brought them out and said sirs what must I do to be saved and they said believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shall be saved and thy house may God bless his word tonight I trust tonight that this has been quite something for you to see what we're going back to we are going back to another book of Acts and God going to honor his word god going to send Angels who are going to bless his people I'm excited about this there's going to be in Trinidad another book of Acts there's going to be around the world another book of Acts let us pour His heavenly father I thank you for these scriptures tonight and singing what the church has called on to seeing what happened in their Ministries and the life of the early church and you said I'm Alpha and Omega I pray that a special anointed will be released here tonight by your word and by your spirit upon your people and their homes and their lives may it have such a dynamic effect that they would see that something Supernatural is on its way it's taking place it's present tense right now bless them as they cross unto you and call upon your name in Jesus
