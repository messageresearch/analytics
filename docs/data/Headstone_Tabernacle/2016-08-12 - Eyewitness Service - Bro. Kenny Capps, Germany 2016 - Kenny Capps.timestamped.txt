[28:30] brother Kenny has to tell Lord may they

[28:39] God today Lord we love you we praise
[28:42] your holy name amen God bless you you
[28:45] may be
[28:54] seated I'm surprised that so many people
[28:56] came back
[29:00] looks like some
[29:02] didn't hope I didn't step on their
[29:05] toes and if I did they need to be
[29:07] stepped
[29:12] on this
[29:16] afternoon I just want to give testimony
[29:19] and and maybe some late some little
[29:22] stories um uh both um you know I I I've
[29:27] met the prophet people asked me they
[29:28] said brother Kenny uh how old were you I
[29:31] said well look this is no secret I was
[29:33] born in 1950 so in 1965 when the prophet
[29:37] died I was 15 years old I remember quite
[29:39] a bit and yes I did have chance to meet
[29:42] the prophet being his home so maybe
[29:44] we'll tell a couple of those little
[29:45] stories
[29:49] um in a small humble
[29:52] way I have been
[29:54] privileged to see a few things and and
[29:58] know just a few things that God has done
[30:01] in this
[30:01] generation but it's not only we are a
[30:04] privileged generation every one of us
[30:05] sitting here today you know and the
[30:07] Bible tells
[30:09] me more blessed are those who have not
[30:13] seen and still
[30:15] believe you know I've I've seen a lot of
[30:18] things a lot of Miracles sometimes I've
[30:21] questioned God
[30:23] why why did he allow me to see these
[30:26] things and you know really it just
[30:29] speaks to a weakness in Me God knew I
[30:32] think God knew I had to see what I saw
[30:34] you know God's infinite he knew I had to
[30:36] see what I saw in order to be at this
[30:39] place in my life but you are more
[30:41] blessed if you're sitting here and
[30:42] you've never seen those things you are
[30:44] even more blessed that you can believe
[30:46] them without seeing so more blessed are
[30:49] those who have not seen and still
[30:53] believe I guess he just allowed me to
[30:55] see those things because I had a big
[30:57] mouth
[30:58] he knew I would tell him I wouldn't hold
[31:03] back amen you know I told Brother I told
[31:06] Brother colen Brer I said now when I do
[31:08] this I like to do it in an informal
[31:13] setting you know I I like to I like to
[31:16] do this around a campfire you know in in
[31:19] somebody's Den you know and and uh just
[31:22] kind of relax a little bit but I think
[31:24] with this many people this is about in
[31:27] as informed formal as I can get pull my
[31:29] coat off and roll my sleeves
[31:32] up so I guess in some sense I am in an
[31:35] informal
[31:38] setting church I have I have been
[31:41] privileged to see see things
[31:46] and but before I relate those stories
[31:50] I'd like to ask my brother Brian to come
[31:52] on the
[31:54] piano um and I'm doing that for this
[31:56] reason
[31:59] I always remember brother George Smith
[32:02] remembers I always remember growing up
[32:05] at the brandham Tabernacle in
[32:06] Jeffersonville and we sang this little
[32:08] song now when when they cut all the
[32:11] singing out of the tapes maybe some of
[32:13] you younger people have never heard this
[32:14] song but I want to sing this little song
[32:17] for you this is a song that we sang as I
[32:20] was growing up at the brandham
[32:22] Tabernacle and I think I actually think
[32:25] somebody in Canada uh wrote it or
[32:28] something and maybe if somebody here
[32:30] would know and they can tell me but the
[32:32] little song goes like

[37:45] don't know all those people uh we
[37:49] had we had two different crowds when I
[37:52] was growing up at the Tabernacle we had
[37:53] the the crowd that uh would lived there
[37:56] and went there on a reg your bases then
[37:58] we had the the huge crowds that came in
[38:02] uh when brother random was in town
[38:04] brother George was one of those he
[38:05] wasn't a regular he was just one of
[38:07] those that came in where brother brandom
[38:08] came in but we always counted him as one
[38:10] of
[38:11] us but we uh we had two different crowds
[38:16] and uh now a lot of people that came in
[38:19] from just for the meetings I didn't know
[38:21] them I didn't know their name I knew
[38:24] they got healed but I I'm going to dwell
[38:26] to today on on those that I did know
[38:29] most of the local people that I knew and
[38:31] that we knew for a fact that they were
[38:34] they were having problems and they spoke
[38:36] to the the man of God and they they were
[38:38] healed so you bear with me this morning
[38:40] pray for
[38:42] me uh growing up in Jeffersonville
[38:46] Indiana in the 50s and 60s we lived in
[38:50] such an atmosphere of
[38:54] Faith anything that happened anything
[38:57] that the devil brought would bring into
[38:58] our lives we
[39:01] knew if we could get a hold of that
[39:04] prophet he could speak the word it's
[39:07] much like the prophet Elisha when he
[39:10] spoke to the little widow woman or or
[39:12] all the great prophets when they spoke
[39:14] to somebody and and and spoke the word
[39:16] and it became manifested so that's the
[39:19] that's the uh atmosphere that we grew up
[39:22] in and uh the first one I will tell you
[39:25] about my brother is healing my brother
[39:29] was uh 5 years younger than me and when
[39:33] he got to be about 12 years old he got
[39:35] sick and the family took him to the
[39:37] doctor and uh the doctor couldn't find
[39:40] out what was wrong with him so they took
[39:42] him home and he kept getting sicker and
[39:44] sicker and so so then after a few days
[39:46] they took him to another doctor he had
[39:48] great pain and
[39:50] uh he just still kept getting sick they
[39:53] didn't know what was wrong with him
[39:54] finally it got so bad and the pain got
[39:56] so bad that they rushed him to the
[39:58] hospital one night the emergency room
[40:01] and in the emergency room they did some
[40:03] tests and some scans and
[40:06] everything and they found out that his
[40:09] appendix had burst and that there was uh
[40:12] poison from those bursted appendix
[40:14] running all through his body and I was
[40:17] standing there and the doctor came out
[40:19] of the emergency
[40:21] room he turned to my father and he said
[40:23] Mr caps he said I'm sorry to tell you
[40:26] your son
[40:27] appendix had bursted said there's too
[40:30] much poison in his body said he probably
[40:33] won't live till
[40:35] morning many of you parents have been in
[40:38] those
[40:39] situations and you know it was strange
[40:43] my father didn't get real
[40:45] excited he just after the doctor left he
[40:47] said we got to call brother brandom so
[40:50] at that time they had the pay phones he
[40:51] went with a pay phone and started
[40:53] putting coins in the pay phone and he
[40:54] called brother ROM's house but there was
[40:57] no
[40:58] answer and still he didn't get too
[41:00] excited he said well he said I'll call
[41:02] Billy Billy will know where he's at so
[41:04] he called Billy's house Billy Paul's
[41:06] house and
[41:09] uh Billy answered the phone I was
[41:11] standing by him my father said uh Billy
[41:13] Billy he said uh do you know where your
[41:15] father is he said they say my son's
[41:16] going to die he said I need to speak
[41:18] with your father and uh brother Billy
[41:21] said well I I don't know exactly brother
[41:23] caps but he said uh he said uh
[41:28] Daddy went target shooting with
[41:31] Joseph and said uh I don't know when
[41:34] they'll be back but said uh whenever I
[41:37] see him today I'll have him call you
[41:40] well he got ready to hang up the
[41:42] phone and Billy said wait a minute
[41:45] brother caps he said Daddy just pulled
[41:47] in the
[41:51] driveway brother brandom came to the
[41:54] phone now we found out later
[41:58] the reason he stopped at Billy's house
[42:02] was because he and Joseph were out
[42:03] target shooting and this is the first
[42:05] time that he had outshot his dad in
[42:08] other words he had shot better than his
[42:09] dad and so Joseph was excited because he
[42:12] had done better than his dad and he
[42:14] wanted to go by Billy's house to tell
[42:17] his big brother that he had beat his dad
[42:20] in target shooting but we know the real
[42:23] reason the real reason because brother
[42:27] brandom could speak to the
[42:28] situation so brother brandom came to the
[42:30] phone and and uh of course I heard my
[42:34] father's side of the conversation and I
[42:35] was told later the other side but my
[42:38] father said
[42:39] U brother brandom he said I need to talk
[42:43] to he said the doctor say my son's going
[42:45] to die he may die before morning he said
[42:48] brother Brandon would you pray and still
[42:49] he wasn't really excited and we just
[42:51] didn't get excited about those things
[42:53] because we knew the prophet would take
[42:54] care of it and he said would you pray
[42:56] and and and and that God would heal the
[42:58] boy you know and
[43:02] uh he said told me later he
[43:05] said brother brandham did not even
[43:08] pray he just said thus sayith the Lord
[43:11] Brother caps your son won't die your son
[43:13] shall
[43:20] live my brother went home the next
[43:23] morning he lives today in cooko Indiana
[43:34] there was a time when brother Brandon
[43:35] was in a meeting in Louisville Kentucky
[43:37] at the church of the open
[43:39] door and uh my grandfather really wasn't
[43:42] a message person he really wasn't a
[43:44] Believer but he was a Christian so he
[43:46] went over to the church there to see uh
[43:49] to see the man of God and he had been
[43:52] having heart problems and uh the doctors
[43:56] didn't expect him to live he he he had a
[43:58] bad heart and at this time my my
[44:01] grandfather was in his late
[44:03] 40s and uh he was sitting in the meeting
[44:06] there in that
[44:07] church and now brother Rand did not call
[44:10] his name but he said there's a man
[44:12] sitting back way back in about the 18th
[44:16] row I think it is and he said he's got
[44:19] on a gray suit he's got on a gray and
[44:21] red tie he said oh brother he said the
[44:24] the Lord shows me you've got a bad heart
[44:26] the doctor said you won't last
[44:28] long he
[44:31] said God heals your heart go home and be
[44:33] made
[44:40] well my
[44:42] grandfather lived to be in his
[44:45] 80s before he
[44:48] died and there's another little story
[44:50] about my grandfather I'll relate while
[44:51] I'm there and I don't have any
[44:52] particular order I'm just I told my wife
[44:55] coming over here I said you know I need
[44:56] to get all these things things organized
[44:57] and and uh and and put my notes together
[45:01] a little better and she said well you're
[45:02] going to have to start using your iPad I
[45:04] guess but
[45:07] uh my
[45:09] grandfather uh my dad and I supp I
[45:13] suppose most of you know my father was
[45:15] brother branham's uh song leader when he
[45:17] was in Jeffersonville he was uh brother
[45:19] Neville's assistant uh he was the adult
[45:21] Sunday school teacher at the Tabernacle
[45:23] he uh he he preached most when brother
[45:27] random wasn't in town brother Neville
[45:28] would preach Sunday morning and usually
[45:30] my father would preach Sunday
[45:32] night and uh now when my father was a
[45:36] boy growing up his parents my
[45:39] grandparents lived in burksville
[45:41] Kentucky and I hope every one of you
[45:43] know where brother Brandon was born in
[45:46] burville Kentucky so it's was kind of
[45:47] strange they were they were they came
[45:49] from the same area and then when uh when
[45:53] my father was just a little boy like
[45:54] when brother Brandon was a little boy uh
[45:57] my grandparents moved to Jeffersonville
[45:58] the same thing that brother brandom's
[46:00] parents did I don't know I'm not trying
[46:01] to make something out of that I'm just
[46:02] saying it's kind of odd but U my
[46:06] great-grandfather down in burksville
[46:07] Kentucky was a Methodist circuit writer
[46:11] and I think most of you know what that
[46:12] is he would ride around from Village to
[46:14] Village and on Horseback and he would
[46:16] preach at churches along the
[46:18] way uh my grandfather that was my
[46:21] great-grandfather my grandfather was not
[46:23] a preacher but then my dad became a
[46:25] preacher and uh my grandfather had left
[46:28] the Methodist Church and joined the
[46:31] Nazarene
[46:32] church so my father grew up in the
[46:35] Nazarene church and uh he was he had
[46:39] been ordained in the Nazarene church and
[46:41] he was and then he he uh in
[46:44] Jeffersonville he started hearing about
[46:46] brother brandham and the message and he
[46:49] tells many stories of seeing brother
[46:51] random out around town and so forth and
[46:53] uh but he uh he was working in Chicago
[46:57] Illinois and my uh or brother brandom
[47:00] was in uh I think it was ma High School
[47:02] auditorium in Chicago Illinois and he
[47:04] went and visited and the Lord got a hold
[47:06] of it and so he he grabbed a hold of the
[47:09] message and he'd been serving the me uh
[47:11] serving the lord in the message for many
[47:13] years so he began praying he began
[47:17] praying for his father my
[47:20] grandfather and uh we would pray as a
[47:22] family he would pray you know Lord
[47:26] give Dad give Granddad the the
[47:29] revelation of the message he wanted him
[47:30] to come out of the Nazarene church and
[47:32] come into the
[47:34] message but even in the late 60s in
[47:39] 1965 it still hadn't
[47:43] happened and so he had an interview with
[47:45] brother brandham one time and he said
[47:48] brother brandham can you tell me
[47:50] something about my father he said I keep
[47:53] witnessing to him I want him to come out
[47:55] of that Nazarene system I want him to
[47:57] come to the message he said can you tell
[47:59] me something about my father he said
[48:01] brother brandom sit in the office there
[48:03] and he had a way of looking up for just
[48:06] a minute or so and he looked back at my
[48:08] father and he said oh brother caps he
[48:10] said the Lord shows me your
[48:14] father he said don't worry about your
[48:16] father he'll be
[48:21] there he said now brother caps he said
[48:24] let me explain why he said
[48:27] your father came up under the Wesleyan
[48:31] message he said that's all he's
[48:34] responsible
[48:35] for but said he'll be there on that day
[48:39] now and I've thought a lot about
[48:42] that
[48:44] 65 the seals had been open we had the
[48:47] full revealed word and yet my
[48:50] grandfather was still in the Nazarene
[48:52] Church the prophet said he'd be there
[48:56] could it be that we're a little quick to
[49:00] judge
[49:01] sometimes you know I hear years ago I
[49:04] heard many times people say oh don't
[49:07] don't mess with them they're just in
[49:08] Pentecost hey there may be some people
[49:11] now granted they would probably be old
[49:13] people but there may be some people who
[49:16] was raised in Pentecost and they'll be
[49:18] there because that's their message and
[49:21] that's all they're responsible
[49:24] for I'm just saying it could could be so
[49:28] we shouldn't be so quick to put people
[49:31] in and put people out but that one
[49:33] little interview with brother brandom
[49:37] that I later heard about convinced me I
[49:40] don't have all the answers and I don't
[49:43] know everything so I try to just love
[49:46] everybody share what I can with
[49:49] people and just go about my
[49:54] business than you Lord Jesus
[50:00] we had
[50:02] some stories of some personal friends oh
[50:06] let me just say this before I do that
[50:08] how many here has heard about Hatty
[50:13] Wright I knew hady right there's not too
[50:17] many people alive today who can say that
[50:19] but I knew hady right uh those two boys
[50:24] that received their salvation
[50:28] were friends of
[50:29] mine now my brother-in-law had horses
[50:33] and we would go riding horses and they
[50:35] lived about 10 miles from Hatty ride so
[50:38] whenever the the horses needed to have
[50:40] new shoes put on them we would ride the
[50:42] horses over to Hatty Wright's house and
[50:44] the boys would put those two boys they
[50:47] would uh put new shoes on the horses and
[50:49] I've been in Hatty Wright's house and
[50:51] when I was in it it was still a dirt
[50:53] floor she didn't have anything just poor
[50:57] as poor as could be but she was a real
[51:00] True Believer and I believe with all my
[51:02] heart that Hattie Wright is a type of
[51:04] the Bride of Jesus Christ if the bride
[51:07] can get to the point where they say
[51:09] that's nothing but the truth brother
[51:11] brandom then I think we've made
[51:15] progress hady Wright was not much to
[51:17] look at I'm sorry I don't know about
[51:20] your new shoes and your new suit and
[51:21] your new dress but the bride ain't too
[51:23] much to look at sometimes but she wasn't
[51:26] much to look at she'd come to church and
[51:29] she'd have
[51:30] old grandma clothes on and she was a
[51:34] cook and she'd have sometimes food on
[51:36] her dress and she had long hair and
[51:39] sometimes she didn't have much style to
[51:40] it she just kind of piled it up on her
[51:42] head and it was going everywhere and she
[51:45] only had one tooth left in her
[51:47] head and as a small kid in my early
[51:51] years most of us kids were afraid of
[51:54] her cuz she just she wasn't a well she's
[51:57] just an old ugly woman that's all she
[51:59] all you can say about her and boy they
[52:00] they've really people really hit me for
[52:02] that saying that Hatty Wright was an
[52:04] ugly woman but that was my impression at
[52:06] the time but I've I've noticed how that
[52:09] when we would have the big meetings and
[52:10] brother Brandon would come in
[52:13] town after
[52:19] church there would be all these big
[52:22] ministers some from Texas with their big
[52:24] cowboy hat and their boots
[52:27] their nice Fine Suits and they'd all be
[52:29] gathered around hadie right they'd don't
[52:31] go around asking now which one is hady
[52:33] right which one is hady right and so
[52:35] somebody would point out had and she
[52:37] always had a crowd around her and she
[52:39] had to always tell the story well she
[52:41] said when brother Brenham said he spoke
[52:42] those squirrels into his she said I knew
[52:45] it was true she said she said uh it had
[52:48] to be true because he said it and she
[52:50] said he said hadie for this saying I
[52:53] give you the desire of your heart he
[52:55] said you can have your your sister's
[52:57] Health you can have money you can have
[52:59] uh uh your your mother and father extend
[53:01] their life he said whatever you say is
[53:05] the way it'll be and she said I just I
[53:08] just looked at him and I said brother
[53:10] brandom my greatest desire in my heart
[53:13] is to see my boy
[53:15] saved well you know the
[53:21] story those two boys were friends of
[53:25] mine uh and in case you do most of you
[53:27] probably know this by now but people
[53:29] would come into town and they say I want
[53:32] to see those two right
[53:34] boys well they weren't right
[53:38] boys their last name was
[53:40] moer so people they they spend many
[53:43] hours trying to find out those right
[53:45] boys there was no right boys because
[53:47] what had happened hadie right that was
[53:49] her maiden name and brother brandom knew
[53:52] the family and he'd always known her as
[53:54] little Hatty rright and that's what he
[53:55] called her well she had gotten married
[53:58] she had those two boys and her husband
[54:00] died just very shortly after those two
[54:02] boys came along so the boys were
[54:03] actually Mosers they were Arville moer
[54:06] and Koy moer but everybody was looking
[54:08] for Hatty Wright's boys they couldn't
[54:11] find them so uh and and if you've got
[54:13] one of George's books the generation
[54:15] book one of those boys is in there and
[54:17] it gives his real
[54:18] name so we we we knew those boys and and
[54:22] the
[54:24] listen they were Rough Boys they were
[54:27] country
[54:29] boys they didn't shave very often maybe
[54:31] twice a
[54:33] year and they didn't care about nice
[54:36] clothes I don't think either one of them
[54:37] ever owned a suit and
[54:41] uh they'd come to church my they were
[54:45] rough seemed like they didn't even comb
[54:47] their hair you know but they're just
[54:49] rough country
[54:50] boys and one of them started liking my
[54:54] sister he tried
[54:56] he tried to be a boyfriend to my sister
[54:59] and she was so embarrassed she
[55:02] said keep him away from
[55:04] [Laughter]
[55:09] me but you know those boys they were
[55:12] good boys after you know they actually
[55:14] had given their their life to the Lord
[55:16] at a very early age when that event
[55:18] happened so I knew them as teenager
[55:20] teenage
[55:21] boys uh very rough you know they've had
[55:24] a rough life one of them's been married
[55:26] married uh three times I think but you
[55:29] can't tell me that those boys aren't
[55:31] saved cuz one of them died last year but
[55:34] I believe that there's ever two boys
[55:35] that's going to be there those two boys
[55:38] [Applause]
[55:44] will how
[55:46] many how many of you remember who Banks
[55:50] Woods
[55:51] was brother Banks
[55:54] Woods was brother brandham best
[55:57] friend he lived next door to him there
[55:59] was Brother brandom's house there was an
[56:01] empty field and then there was Brook
[56:03] Banks Woods house and he became brother
[56:05] brandom's best friend they traveled
[56:07] together they hunted together they did
[56:08] everything
[56:11] together and there's quite an
[56:13] interesting story about brother
[56:16] Banks because people have said and maybe
[56:19] you've heard it I've heard it people
[56:22] have said boy it was a shame about
[56:24] brother Banks wasn't it I what are you
[56:26] talking about well brother brother Banks
[56:29] he left the message he
[56:30] backslid I said man you're crazy he
[56:34] wouldn't he wouldn't he wouldn't
[56:36] backslide but it's true when brother
[56:38] brandom died I think it was like the
[56:40] next week he went down to the church and
[56:43] he resigned his position as
[56:46] trustee and he left the church as far as
[56:49] anybody knows he never went to the
[56:51] brandom Tabernacle again so they started
[56:54] get making rumors about him he left the
[56:56] message he left the church he he backed
[56:58] he did this he did
[57:00] that and so we heard this for we
[57:04] probably heard this for several
[57:05] months so finally my dad was my dad was
[57:09] friends with him also so he said come on
[57:12] Kenny he said we're going to go see
[57:13] brother Banks so went to Brother Banks
[57:16] house knocked on the door and brother
[57:18] Banks come to the door he said brother
[57:20] Banks he said I'm concerned about you he
[57:22] said people are saying this about you
[57:24] and saying that about you he said is
[57:26] everything all right but the bank said
[57:28] yeah brother caps everything's fine he
[57:30] said well we haven't seen you around the
[57:31] church we heard you resigned he
[57:34] said uh are you sure everything's all
[57:36] right brother Banks started
[57:39] laughing he said brother caps I've got
[57:41] to tell you the story and I was standing
[57:43] there and heard him tell my dad the
[57:45] story he said not long before brother
[57:49] brandham died said he came over to my
[57:51] house one
[57:52] day he walked in and he said brother I
[57:56] want to talk to
[57:57] you he said this is very important I
[57:59] want you to listen to me he said I'm not
[58:03] going to be with you
[58:05] long he said the Lord's going to take me
[58:08] and he said when you've heard that the
[58:09] Lord has taken me I want you to do
[58:11] something in fact he says you have to do
[58:13] something he said you have to leave the
[58:16] Tabernacle and you have to take your
[58:18] wife sister Ruby and you have to go back
[58:21] to Louisville to the Assembly of God
[58:23] Church there almost impossible to
[58:26] believe you know he said I know it's
[58:29] hard to believe brother caps but he said
[58:30] that's exactly what happened he said he
[58:32] told me he said brother Banks if you
[58:34] don't do what I tell you he said you're
[58:37] going to lose your wife sister
[58:40] Ruby he said now she's already had two
[58:42] nervous breakdowns and he said after I'm
[58:45] gone he said there's going to be so much
[58:47] fanaticism rise up about my
[58:50] message he said they're going to drive
[58:52] your wife crazy he said it will destroy
[58:55] her neres he said you're going to lose
[58:57] your wife if I don't if you don't do
[59:00] what I tell you he said now take her
[59:02] back to brother Rogers Church which was
[59:04] the Assembly of God Pastor in Louisville
[59:06] Kentucky he said that's the church she
[59:08] grew up in as a little girl and he said
[59:12] you're to take her there and you're to
[59:14] stay there in that church and she that
[59:16] will be a comfort to her nobody will
[59:18] know where to find her nobody will will
[59:20] uh be able to uh get a hold of her and
[59:23] he said you'll be able to save your wife
[59:31] so brother
[59:34] Banks seeing what he seen knowing what
[59:37] he knew he knew well enough to do what a
[59:40] prophet of God said amen I wonder how
[59:42] many of us really know enough to do what
[59:45] a prophet of God said when he said
[59:47] sisters don't cut your
[59:52] hair when he said Brothers put away
[59:55] those cigarettes
[59:56] quit deceiving people don't be a
[59:59] hypocrite Church some of us better start
[1:00:02] doing what he
[1:00:04] says but he brother Banks took his wife
[1:00:08] sister
[1:00:11] Ruby and they went back to brother
[1:00:13] Rogers Church in Louisville
[1:00:16] Kentucky they put a big fence up around
[1:00:19] their house you couldn't get in to knock
[1:00:21] on their
[1:00:22] door all people tried all they had
[1:00:25] reports of people craw crawling over the
[1:00:27] fence and everything else
[1:00:31] fanaticism but brother Banks did what a
[1:00:33] prophet of God told him to
[1:00:35] do and they actually she outlived him I
[1:00:40] think he died about 10 years ago she
[1:00:42] died about seven years ago but uh they
[1:00:46] were doing what the prophet of God said
[1:00:47] to
[1:00:51] do we have another friend
[1:00:56] the West
[1:00:58] family and the West family were from
[1:01:03] they were from New
[1:01:04] Mexico and they would come to the
[1:01:06] meetings in Jeffersonville Indiana it's
[1:01:08] a long drive and they had a daughter
[1:01:11] named Rebecca
[1:01:13] West and during the park viw meetings if
[1:01:16] you remember the
[1:01:17] story the park viw meetings was in an
[1:01:20] auditorium and on this side they had the
[1:01:23] nice Auditorium seats the padded seats
[1:01:25] the C cushion seats but on this side
[1:01:27] they had a gymnasium and they had seats
[1:01:30] chairs much like what you're sitting in
[1:01:33] here and brother Brandon when he would
[1:01:36] preach on the
[1:01:39] stage sometimes he would look to this
[1:01:41] side and sometimes he would look to this
[1:01:43] side but he was preaching to both
[1:01:48] sides this particular night I think it
[1:01:52] was during marriage and
[1:01:54] divorce he was was looking this way and
[1:01:57] he was he had finished the sermon he was
[1:01:59] starting to do the discernment he was
[1:02:01] looking this way and he go oh he said
[1:02:03] the Lord shows me oh I see it's a little
[1:02:07] girl oh the family's from New Mexico he
[1:02:10] said the little girl two years old oh he
[1:02:13] said she's got a cleft pallet which
[1:02:16] means she doesn't have a roof in her
[1:02:17] mouth and she couldn't talk he said oh
[1:02:21] he said oh it's the West family brother
[1:02:23] West from New Mexico
[1:02:26] he said brother West he said God will
[1:02:28] heal your
[1:02:29] daughter but then he
[1:02:31] said it'll come slowly it'll be many
[1:02:35] years before she's totally
[1:02:39] healed
[1:02:41] well she really still couldn't talk she
[1:02:44] was uh not in pain or anything after
[1:02:48] that but the West
[1:02:52] family and and and within just a year or
[1:02:55] two after brother brother brandom died
[1:02:56] my dad went up to Northern Indiana and
[1:02:58] started his own
[1:03:00] church and the West
[1:03:03] family they fell in love with our family
[1:03:05] they fell in love with my father and
[1:03:07] mother and and so they decided to move
[1:03:09] from New
[1:03:11] Mexico to Indiana where my father had a
[1:03:16] church and
[1:03:18] so time went
[1:03:20] on and Rebecca West the little
[1:03:22] two-year-old that brother brandham spoke
[1:03:24] about she got to be about 13 years
[1:03:33] old and one Sunday they came to church
[1:03:37] and they just started rejoicing in
[1:03:41] church the Clift pallet had been fully
[1:03:44] healed she actually God had recreated
[1:03:47] the mouth of the of the roof of the
[1:03:49] mouth she could talk normally everything
[1:03:52] was normal
[1:04:00] and she
[1:04:01] lives in Muny
[1:04:03] Indiana and don't youall put me out of
[1:04:05] the message for this but I'm a friend of
[1:04:07] hers on
[1:04:09] Facebook and her name is re Rebecca West
[1:04:13] Coleman and if you want to get a hold of
[1:04:15] her I'm sure she'd be glad to tell you
[1:04:16] the story The
[1:04:19] testimony but we've seen all kind of
[1:04:21] things like that
[1:04:22] happen
[1:04:23] uh we we had a real close family that
[1:04:27] was friends of ours there it was the
[1:04:28] shepherd family and I'm sure you
[1:04:30] probably read about this in the
[1:04:32] message but the shepherd family they had
[1:04:35] two boys one boy was uh three years
[1:04:38] older than me I think the other boy was
[1:04:39] two years older than me but brother
[1:04:42] Shepherd the dad he had been very
[1:04:46] sick and
[1:04:49] uh she had told the mother had or the
[1:04:51] wife had told my my mother and different
[1:04:53] ones there she says I don't know what
[1:04:56] we're going to do about Alex he says uh
[1:04:59] he's convinced he's he's got a bad heart
[1:05:01] or bad back or whatever it was I think
[1:05:03] he's a bad back and he's convinced he's
[1:05:05] going to die because he can't live in
[1:05:07] this pain any
[1:05:08] longer and so everybody in the church
[1:05:10] they knew the story but nobody that came
[1:05:13] in in the in the big crowd when brother
[1:05:15] Brandon was at they really didn't know
[1:05:16] the
[1:05:17] story and so the the mother or the wife
[1:05:21] had had told everybody said we were out
[1:05:23] shopping the other
[1:05:24] day and said I wanted Alex to buy a new
[1:05:29] pair of
[1:05:30] shoes he saidoh I'm not buying no new
[1:05:32] pair of shoes he said I'm not going to
[1:05:33] spend the money he said he said I'm
[1:05:34] going to die I don't need a new pair of
[1:05:36] shoes she said oh Alex don't talk like
[1:05:38] that he said no I'm going to die he said
[1:05:40] I don't need he wouldn't buy the new
[1:05:41] pair of shoes now the story came back
[1:05:44] later she never told Brother brandom
[1:05:45] that story so one Sunday morning I'm
[1:05:49] sitting about six or seven rows back and
[1:05:52] what you have to understand at the
[1:05:53] brandom Tabernacle at that time they had
[1:05:56] a baptistry pool behind the pull pit and
[1:05:58] they had a curtain back
[1:06:00] there you really couldn't see unless the
[1:06:02] curtains were open but the the crowds
[1:06:05] were so
[1:06:07] great that they would set chairs in the
[1:06:12] baptistry I think they had a a a board
[1:06:15] or something they'd set chairs back
[1:06:16] there and and they would have many
[1:06:19] people sitting back in the
[1:06:21] baptistry they couldn't see brother
[1:06:23] brandom he couldn't see them so he's
[1:06:26] preaching one morning and he stops in
[1:06:28] the middle of his service he says oh he
[1:06:33] said there's a brother he's he's got
[1:06:36] serious back problem I think it was back
[1:06:38] he said he's got serious back problem he
[1:06:42] said the Lord's going to heal
[1:06:47] him and he kind of looked up you know
[1:06:50] he he said oh he said it's our precious
[1:06:54] brother Shepherd
[1:06:56] oh and he's back in the baptistry behind
[1:06:58] the
[1:06:59] curtain he said oh he said I see he said
[1:07:02] he was out shopping with his wife she
[1:07:04] wanted him to buy a new pair of shoes
[1:07:06] and he wouldn't buy the shoes because he
[1:07:08] thought he was going to die he said
[1:07:09] brother Shepherd go home and be
[1:07:19] healed these are people where I that I
[1:07:22] knew a lot of things I didn't know I
[1:07:24] knew I saw it happen but I didn't know
[1:07:26] them but these are people that I
[1:07:29] knew and I may
[1:07:34] just I don't know if look some of these
[1:07:38] stories were going to sound real
[1:07:41] spiritual some of them are
[1:07:43] not some of them are funny some of them
[1:07:46] are sad and some of them are just
[1:07:51] stupid brother Shephard had two teenage
[1:07:54] boys
[1:07:55] one was three years older than me and
[1:07:58] one was two and a couple years after
[1:08:00] their dad was
[1:08:01] healed we were out playing
[1:08:03] basketball oh we love basketball in
[1:08:06] America we were out playing basketball
[1:08:09] shooting B you know and uh so
[1:08:14] let's let's go to town get something

[1:09:56] front seat next to brother brandom and
[1:09:58] me and the youngest boy we're sitting in
[1:10:00] the
[1:10:04] back and so we're riding along and the

[1:10:46] half dressed oh she was dressed
[1:10:50] poorly ah very poorly dressed very
[1:10:53] immodest

[1:11:41] one then he said boys don't you ever do
[1:11:44] that again and he wasn't laughing and we
[1:11:47] stopped
[1:11:48] laughing and I never did it again
[1:11:55] it's one of those stupid stories I was
[1:11:58] talking
[1:12:01] about
[1:12:05] um you know there's a famous
[1:12:08] story there's a famous story in the
[1:12:10] message and I'm sure many of you but
[1:12:11] probably all of you have heard it I
[1:12:12] think it took place in Germany and it
[1:12:14] might have taken place over here at
[1:12:16] Carl's Rua I don't but you would
[1:12:17] probably be able to tell me there's a
[1:12:19] famous story where brother Brandon was
[1:12:22] praying for people and a little blind
[1:12:24] girl came up and she had no eyeballs
[1:12:26] yall know was did that happen in Germany
[1:12:29] I thought it did
[1:12:30] yeah okay and
[1:12:34] uh you know the story then she was she
[1:12:37] didn't have any eyeballs and she came up
[1:12:40] before brother brandom and and I don't
[1:12:42] remember it in detail but it was
[1:12:43] something like this he said uh honey if
[1:12:48] you had
[1:12:50] eyes what color would you like and she
[1:12:53] said something about I think blue wasn't
[1:12:55] it blue yeah and so the prophet of God
[1:12:58] prayed for her and she turned around and
[1:13:00] and she had eyes God had created
[1:13:02] eyeballs for that young
[1:13:10] sister I did not see that but in about I
[1:13:14] think it was the fall of 1964 I believe
[1:13:17] it was brother brandom had come back to
[1:13:19] Jeffersonville for a meeting and there
[1:13:21] was another little girl and she was
[1:13:24] blind now she had eyeballs but she was
[1:13:28] blind and I was sitting just maybe four
[1:13:30] or five rows back and I saw very clearly
[1:13:33] what
[1:13:35] happened and she walked up her and her
[1:13:37] mother walked up before brother brandom
[1:13:39] he said oh he said the child is
[1:13:42] blind he said God bless you mother he
[1:13:45] said oh he said this precious little
[1:13:47] sister he
[1:13:50] said little sister do you believe that
[1:13:53] God can give you back your
[1:13:56] sight the mother was saying yes and the
[1:13:58] girl was saying
[1:14:00] yes he said now I want everybody in here
[1:14:03] to close your eyes he said because if
[1:14:06] you don't close your eyes he said God's
[1:14:09] going to heal her and you may have the
[1:14:11] sickness and I was sitting there and I
[1:14:14] watched that little girl turn around and
[1:14:16] she started screaming I can see I can
[1:14:19] see and the mother was screaming I saw
[1:14:22] that with my own eyes
[1:14:30] Church a man can't do that a man cannot
[1:14:33] do that it takes God to do
[1:14:37] that and I keep referring to my notes
[1:14:40] here let's see what else we got to
[1:14:57] we
[1:15:00] uh went to the Tabernacle there for a
[1:15:03] lot of years and it was always
[1:15:06] strange in the late 50s and the early
[1:15:10] 60s that I remember
[1:15:13] because late 50s and early 60s that's
[1:15:16] right because Church would start I think
[1:15:20] it started at
[1:15:23] 10:30 but in order to get a
[1:15:26] seat you had to get there about 4:30 in
[1:15:28] the morning and
[1:15:31] so you you could arrive at 5:00 and 5:30
[1:15:34] and the crowds would be so great at at
[1:15:36] the front door and they would just be
[1:15:39] waiting to get in and
[1:15:42] uh in later years they actually reserved
[1:15:46] a seat for brother branham's family and
[1:15:50] my dad's family and we we we didn't have
[1:15:53] to wait in that line because they would
[1:15:54] save us as seat but but in in that in
[1:15:56] those first years we would get there
[1:15:58] real early and we'd have to wait in line
[1:16:00] like everybody else and then when the
[1:16:01] doors would open they'd open them
[1:16:04] usually about
[1:16:05] eight people would just rush in now you
[1:16:08] all have heard the story of brother Ben
[1:16:10] Bryant brother Ben Bryant was a big
[1:16:13] supporter of brother brandham he was a
[1:16:14] huge mountain man and uh he had brother
[1:16:18] Brandon told the story where he had been
[1:16:20] in the war and he'd gotten uh uh
[1:16:22] shrapnel I think it was shell fragments
[1:16:24] in in his head and he wasn't just wasn't
[1:16:27] quite he was a good guy just wasn't
[1:16:29] quite right though and uh he he was a
[1:16:32] big tall he must have been about six'
[1:16:34] six uh very big tall guy big guy great
[1:16:37] big guy and many times when those doors
[1:16:41] would open he would push people he would
[1:16:43] push ladies he would push little girls
[1:16:45] he didn't care he had he said I've got
[1:16:47] to be on the front seat for my prophit
[1:16:50] and that's where he ended up every time
[1:16:51] and there was many times where he
[1:16:54] couldn't be in the
[1:16:55] to get up in one of the front seats and
[1:16:57] he would actually step over the
[1:16:59] pews until he got to the front he was
[1:17:02] going to make sure he got to the
[1:17:05] front one funny little
[1:17:08] story I'm in Jeffersonville one day and
[1:17:10] this is in the 70s brother bram's done
[1:17:13] gone Ben's still there I'm downtown
[1:17:17] Jeffersonville and I see a big crowd
[1:17:19] over here in front of JC
[1:17:22] Pennies so I go over I want to see
[1:17:25] what's going on so I go over there and
[1:17:27] look and I look and there's a man down
[1:17:31] on all
[1:17:32] fours and he's barking like a
[1:17:38] dog and I look closer and it was brother
[1:17:41] Ben Bryan and he was down on all fours
[1:17:43] he started barking like a dog just a
[1:17:46] barking you know people look at him like
[1:17:48] he's weird they're about half scared of
[1:17:51] him and then he would stand up he stood
[1:17:54] up
[1:17:55] and he said 'ow that I've got your
[1:17:57] people's attention he said' I want to
[1:17:58] tell you about God sending a
[1:18:03] prophet he was dedicated wasn't
[1:18:05] he you know I just kind of walked
[1:18:12] away well that was old Ben Bryant he was
[1:18:14] a rough
[1:18:19] character I told you my family came from
[1:18:23] burksville Kentucky
[1:18:25] and I would go down in the summertime
[1:18:27] and visit my
[1:18:29] grandmother so one
[1:18:32] summer I went down to visit my
[1:18:35] grandmother and I
[1:18:38] decided that I was going to research and
[1:18:40] find a copy of brother bram's birth
[1:18:44] certificate I thought now this is you
[1:18:46] know how we do in the message this is
[1:18:48] something nobody else is God I can get
[1:18:50] this you know so I went down to the
[1:18:52] courthouse and I started searching
[1:18:54] through files
[1:18:57] and I couldn't find anything so I went
[1:19:01] to the lady at the desk and I said ma'am
[1:19:02] I said I can't find what I'm looking for
[1:19:06] and she said what are you looking for
[1:19:07] and I said I'm looking for the record of
[1:19:09] a
[1:19:10] birth uh of a man I know she goes well
[1:19:14] those kind of Records over here in the
[1:19:15] microfish file which was what they used
[1:19:18] at that time I said okay so I went over
[1:19:21] there and I looked through there and I
[1:19:21] couldn't find anything and she I went
[1:19:23] back to her and I said I I just came she
[1:19:25] said what are you looking for I said I'm
[1:19:27] looking for the man a record of birth
[1:19:28] for a man in their n uh that was born in
[1:19:30] 1909 she goes oh honey she said you
[1:19:33] won't find those records she said we had
[1:19:35] a fire here in 1921 and it burned up all
[1:19:37] those
[1:19:38] records but a little later a few years
[1:19:40] later when I heard that people were
[1:19:43] leaving the message because they didn't
[1:19:44] believe the story about the bridge you
[1:19:46] remember
[1:19:47] that I thought my God we can't even
[1:19:49] prove the man was alive what are you
[1:19:51] worrying about a bridge for
[1:19:57] but about that story about the
[1:20:04] bridge there's a lot of
[1:20:08] reasons a lot of things that can be said
[1:20:12] about why people don't find a record of
[1:20:15] that in the
[1:20:17] newspapers in the first
[1:20:20] place back in that
[1:20:22] time labor unions
[1:20:25] were very very strong and they actually
[1:20:29] controlled the Press they controlled the
[1:20:32] newspaper
[1:20:35] business
[1:20:38] and the labor unions were
[1:20:42] having problems finding people to work
[1:20:47] on the
[1:20:48] bridge
[1:20:51] because you're over 100 feet over the
[1:20:55] water and it was a very dangerous
[1:20:58] job and so there's people there that
[1:21:01] will tell you and we actually found a
[1:21:04] witness that actually saw people fall
[1:21:08] off the bridge and you've probably seen
[1:21:10] it on the voice of God
[1:21:12] website and
[1:21:14] uh but the newspapers were controlled by
[1:21:17] the labor
[1:21:19] unions and it's and I don't know this to
[1:21:21] be a fact but it's very likely they
[1:21:24] didn't want the word to get
[1:21:27] out that people had been
[1:21:29] killed working on the bridge because
[1:21:32] they would have problem getting people
[1:21:33] to do the work we don't know for
[1:21:37] sure but
[1:21:43] uh give me a minute I'm past 25 the
[1:21:47] second
[1:21:52] time I became very concerned and others
[1:21:55] did because we heard had reports of
[1:21:58] people leaving so a friend of
[1:22:01] mine he he said brother Kenny what about
[1:22:04] this he said what can we do to what can
[1:22:06] we do to turn this thing around he said
[1:22:09] you was born there he said do you
[1:22:12] remember anything about that
[1:22:15] time I said yeah I said I remember a lot
[1:22:17] I
[1:22:18] said I remember the mayor who the mayor
[1:22:21] was at that time
[1:22:24] he said 'well why don't you check around
[1:22:25] see what you can
[1:22:28] find so U I wrote a
[1:22:30] letter first I called then I wrote a
[1:22:33] letter to the
[1:22:34] Jeffersonville um city hall and I asked
[1:22:40] if that man was still alive that was
[1:22:42] mayor when brother brandom was
[1:22:44] alive and
[1:22:47] uh they
[1:22:48] responded that no that man wasn't still
[1:22:52] alive but his son was an attorney in
[1:22:55] town and so the other brother and I we
[1:22:59] contacted the
[1:23:00] attorney and he began telling the story
[1:23:03] and I I suppose most of you have seen
[1:23:05] the story um we talked to the attorney
[1:23:08] and he wrote us a letter how that his
[1:23:11] family was good friends with brother
[1:23:13] brandham and his family actually owned
[1:23:15] the Jefferson Villa Motel where many of
[1:23:17] the people stayed and he told the story
[1:23:19] about how many how that many many many
[1:23:22] sick people would come in they'd be on
[1:23:25] cots or stretchers they'd be sick and
[1:23:27] they'd come into the motel and they
[1:23:29] they'd go to the meetings and they'd
[1:23:31] come back and they weren't sick
[1:23:33] anymore and they knew that this was a
[1:23:35] man of
[1:23:36] God and uh so then he told the story
[1:23:40] about back in that day he remembers his
[1:23:44] grandmother talking about them building
[1:23:47] that bridge and he said his grandmother
[1:23:50] and another woman would go down and sit
[1:23:53] on the river bank and and watch the
[1:23:56] bridge being
[1:23:57] built because there was nothing else to
[1:24:00] do in that day they didn't have TV and
[1:24:04] and there just wasn't much going on in
[1:24:06] Jeffersonville I don't think there's a
[1:24:08] whole lot going on
[1:24:10] now
[1:24:16] but but he said Grandma and her friend
[1:24:19] would go down and sit on the riverbank
[1:24:21] and watch the bridge being built and he
[1:24:23] said they were down there one day and
[1:24:26] they saw some
[1:24:27] men fall off that bridge and they went
[1:24:30] in the concrete that had been poured you
[1:24:32] couldn't say there's no way they could
[1:24:33] ever recover him said they saw that so
[1:24:36] he said yes he said that's true that's
[1:24:38] true Mr caps he said if Billy he called
[1:24:41] him Billy he said if Billy brandham says
[1:24:43] that he said that's true that's exactly
[1:24:45] right but people because they can't
[1:24:48] prove something because you can't prove
[1:24:51] something don't mean it's not true
[1:24:54] I can't prove the man was alive but that
[1:24:57] don't mean it's not true but that's one
[1:24:59] of the little stories that we get into
[1:25:01] sometimes you know how it
[1:25:03] is people think they know better than a
[1:25:12] prophet what time is somebody tell me
[1:25:14] what time is
[1:25:16] lunch or
[1:25:18] dinner one hour okay
[1:25:26] let me tell you because this takes just
[1:25:28] a little while let me tell you about the
[1:25:31] time I first met brother brandham now
[1:25:35] this is a funny
[1:25:37] story George has heard it many
[1:25:46] times I believe it was 1965 I think it
[1:25:50] was and and uh as you know brother
[1:25:54] brandom went out
[1:25:56] west in the fall and he would after
[1:25:59] after school uh let out out in Arizona
[1:26:02] he would bring the family back to
[1:26:04] Jeffersonville well that year they he
[1:26:07] brought the family back to
[1:26:08] Jeffersonville now you know we had all
[1:26:10] these kids around Jeffersonville there
[1:26:12] and we'd all go to the Tabernacle we
[1:26:13] were friends and and sometimes we'd have
[1:26:16] little boyfriends and girlfriends you
[1:26:19] know nothing serious just friendships
[1:26:21] you know but one day
[1:26:24] my buddy Frankie Neville brother
[1:26:27] Neville's son he brings me a
[1:26:32] note and this note has written on
[1:26:36] it dear
[1:26:38] Kenny I like you do you like
[1:26:43] me and there was two little boxes there
[1:26:46] one you could check yes and one you
[1:26:48] could check
[1:26:50] [Applause]
[1:26:52] no he said here he said
[1:26:56] uh Sarah brandham gave this to Ruth
[1:26:59] Collins to give to me to give to
[1:27:02] you he said what are you going to do
[1:27:04] with it I said I don't know he said do
[1:27:07] you like her I said well I
[1:27:11] guess he said check yes so I checked yes
[1:27:15] and I gave it back to him and he gave it
[1:27:17] back to Ruth Collins and she gave it
[1:27:19] back to Sarah
[1:27:22] Brandon so
[1:27:25] I guess we were official friends then
[1:27:27] you
[1:27:29] know and uh so this went on I didn't you
[1:27:33] know I didn't get any more notes for a
[1:27:34] while
[1:27:37] and next thing I
[1:27:40] know my friend Frankie Neville he comes
[1:27:43] to me and he says Kenny Sarah wants to

[1:30:02] him but you
[1:30:05] see as a kid we weren't allowed to have
[1:30:07] comic books in our
[1:30:09] house but I would sneak
[1:30:11] away and I would go to the corner
[1:30:13] drugstore and I'd stand there on
[1:30:15] Saturday morning read the comic books
[1:30:18] I'd read about
[1:30:20] Superman and all those Heroes you know
[1:30:23] but I always knew that brother Brandon
[1:30:25] was the real
[1:30:27] Superman and I'm tell you
[1:30:30] something my
[1:30:31] parents gave me 50 cents a day for
[1:30:37] lunch half a dollar man we could eat
[1:30:40] good back
[1:30:42] then and I would take that 50 cents and
[1:30:46] I'd go to school and I'd gamble with the
[1:30:50] boys I gambled my money man there was
[1:30:54] many days I'd go home with three or four
[1:30:56] dollars there was many days I didn't get
[1:30:58] to eat
[1:30:59] [Laughter]
[1:31:02] lunch and you know what I was telling
[1:31:05] little stories that wasn't too nice at
[1:31:09] school I knew that if brother brandom
[1:31:13] came close to me he would know
[1:31:15] everything about
[1:31:17] me and I ain't
[1:31:20] going he said I mean they tried for two
[1:31:23] weeks said you come on you can go it's

[1:31:28] I'm not going I can't do it I don't want
[1:31:31] to meet
[1:31:34] him finally finally after about two
[1:31:39] weeks two and a half weeks they
[1:31:40] convinced me brother or Charlie came to
[1:31:43] me and he said listen Kenny he said I've
[1:31:45] talked with Uncle Bill he said you don't
[1:31:47] have to meet Uncle Bill he said but now

[1:31:52] summer he said will you go out with her
[1:31:56] I said ' if I don't have to meet brother
[1:31:58] brandham I'll go
[1:32:00] out he said all right I'll set it
[1:32:04] up

[1:32:51] summertime the windows were down the
[1:32:54] birds were
[1:32:55] singing and he picked me up and we drove
[1:32:58] to Brother brandom's house and I started
[1:33:01] to get real
[1:33:02] nervous I really started to get
[1:33:05] nervous I said maybe this wasn't a good
[1:33:07] idea he said too late
[1:33:13] now he pulled into brother brandom's
[1:33:16] driveway and he sat there and I sat
[1:33:20] there and I sat there he said you got to
[1:33:23] go to the door and get her I said I got
[1:33:25] to go get her he said yes you got to go
[1:33:28] knock on the door and get her I said

[1:33:32] the horn can't you do something he goes
[1:33:34] no Kenny you got to go that's what guys
[1:33:36] do when they go out with the girls I'd
[1:33:38] never been out with the girls I didn't
[1:33:40] know you know and uh he said you got to
[1:33:43] go well I got out of the car and I
[1:33:47] walked up to the brother vandam's door
[1:33:49] and I stood there for just a minute or
[1:33:52] two and I want to tell you brother
[1:33:54] something this is now this is a gospel
[1:33:56] truth I was so scared my knees were
[1:34:00] shaking I could hear
[1:34:03] them and I was trying to think of every
[1:34:05] way not to go ahead and go through
[1:34:10] this finally I got enough courage walk
[1:34:14] it up knocked on the
[1:34:16] door and I'm just I'm petrified because
[1:34:20] I just know brother Brandon's going to
[1:34:21] come to the door
[1:34:24] but he doesn't sister brandom comes to
[1:34:26] the door she opens the door she goes oh

[1:34:48] all over the world so I'm sure you young
[1:34:50] people enjoy this
[1:34:54] I didn't want to see it I was just
[1:34:55] wanted to get out of there but I had to
[1:34:57] sit there and the whole time I sat there
[1:35:00] I'm looking around and I'm thinking
[1:35:03] where's he at where's he at you
[1:35:08] know but he didn't
[1:35:11] come man Sarah come down oh she's
[1:35:14] beautiful you know so sister brandom
[1:35:16] gave us our instructions you know and so
[1:35:18] we went out the door and went and got in
[1:35:21] the car I was feeling pretty good now
[1:35:23] you know I I I put Sarah in the front
[1:35:26] seat between Charlie and
[1:35:28] I and uh so we're ready to go I'm
[1:35:31] feeling good
[1:35:33] now so Charlie backs out of the
[1:35:37] driveway and he starts down the street
[1:35:41] now remember I told you there's an empty
[1:35:43] field between Brother bram's house and
[1:35:44] brother Banks Wood's house so he starts
[1:35:47] down the street and as we get in front
[1:35:49] of that empty
[1:35:51] field I see brother banham back here
[1:35:53] here with banks wood and they've got
[1:36:01] guns and about that
[1:36:04] time about that time brother random
[1:36:08] screams out hey Charlie wait a minute

[1:36:35] eternity brother brandom and Banks wood
[1:36:39] starts walking up to the car from this
[1:36:41] field it seemed like it took
[1:36:44] forever and I'm sitting by the passenger
[1:36:47] door and that's the side he walks up
[1:36:51] to didn't have a shirt

[1:37:08] his gun
[1:37:11] and brother brandom had his gun I'm
[1:37:14] going what is going on here you
[1:37:19] know and he sticks his hand in the
[1:37:22] window to shake my hand
[1:37:25] man and I'm this far from his face now
[1:37:29] brother Bisal said something the other
[1:37:31] day about in his presence in the
[1:37:34] presence of brother

[1:37:39] was in his presence I don't know if it

[1:38:12] hardest to sound like a sensible human
[1:38:15] being and nothing comes
[1:38:17] out and I I feel feel it really bad you
[1:38:22] know and he took my hand and held it for
[1:38:25] a minute and he looked in my
[1:38:28] eyes and you know how they they talked
[1:38:31] about his eyes getting
[1:38:33] narrow and I looked in his eyes and
[1:38:34] there was those lights in his eyes and I
[1:38:37] saw the eyes of an
[1:38:39] eagle I had been to the Cincinnati Zoo
[1:38:43] where he saw those Eagles and talked
[1:38:45] about the eyes of the eagle I had been
[1:38:47] there and seen those
[1:38:49] Eagles and to me he had the eyes of an
[1:38:52] eagle that's all I could think of his
[1:38:54] eagle eyes and there's something that
[1:38:56] came over me brother I don't know what
[1:38:58] it was but it was that presence I'm sure
[1:39:02] but something came over me as a
[1:39:03] 15-year-old boy I knew he knew
[1:39:05] everything about me and I felt so
[1:39:11] bad and I'm still haven't said
[1:39:14] anything and he said uh still holding my
[1:39:17] hand he says where you taking her boy
[1:39:30] nothing comes
[1:39:34] out is oh so this is that caps boy I've
[1:39:37] been hearing so much
[1:39:46] about you know I should have said yes
[1:39:48] sir you know or something you know I
[1:39:49] couldn't say
[1:39:50] nothing he asked me again he said where
[1:39:52] are you taking
[1:39:58] boy well Charlie's getting kind of tired
[1:40:01] of all this he said oh Uncle Bill leave
[1:40:03] him
[1:40:04] alone he said we're going to go we're
[1:40:07] going to go play Miniature Golf and then
[1:40:09] we're going to go out to eat we'll be
[1:40:10] home in a little
[1:40:13] bit so brother brandom says oh that's
[1:40:16] fine that's real fine he shook my hand
[1:40:19] again he said you kids have a good time
[1:40:27] I still can't say a
[1:40:29] word and of course he knows you know he
[1:40:31] knows the situation
[1:40:34] you and so he starts to turn him and
[1:40:36] Banks start to turn away from the
[1:40:39] car and I'm starting to feel a little
[1:40:42] relieved I feel bad because I haven't
[1:40:44] said anything but I'm starting to feel a
[1:40:46] little
[1:40:47] relieved but then he turns back around
[1:40:50] toward the car window and this time he
[1:40:54] takes his gun his rifle or whatever it
[1:40:56] was and he puts it he puts it through
[1:40:59] the
[1:41:03] window and he lays the barrel of that
[1:41:05] gun on the back of my
[1:41:15] neck and he says in a real rough
[1:41:19] voice he says you are going to bring her
[1:41:22] back tonight aren't you you
[1:41:24] boy gun on your back man talking to you
[1:41:27] like

[1:41:31] voice but it was about 10 octaves too
[1:41:34] high I said yes sir yes
[1:41:37] [Applause]
[1:41:40] sir he laughed and he laughed and he
[1:41:44] laughed he slapped his leg he said I got
[1:41:48] him Banks I got him Banks said you got
[1:41:50] him bill you got him
[1:41:57] that was my first time to to meet the
[1:42:03] prophet so several times after that that
[1:42:06] summer I
[1:42:08] would get my parents to take me to their
[1:42:12] house and Sarah and I would have it set
[1:42:14] up that me and her would would see each
[1:42:16] other
[1:42:17] right but every time I got there sister
[1:42:21] random would have something else for
[1:42:23] Sarah to do she she'd always say no you
[1:42:25] just go in the backyard and play with
[1:42:26] Joseph Sarah's got a work to do I never
[1:42:29] got
[1:42:31] to and then many times I'd stay a couple
[1:42:34] hours and be out in the back with
[1:42:37] Joseph and uh then it would they'd have
[1:42:40] to go somewhere he said uh brother BR
[1:42:42] say uh Kenny can I take you home he said
[1:42:44] are we can call your mom I said no you
[1:42:46] can take me home you know he'd put me in
[1:42:48] the car and he joke with me all the way
[1:42:50] to my house only about two miles he'd
[1:42:52] joke with me tell me jokes and say funny
[1:42:54] things you know just a common good good
[1:42:57] guy you know made me feel so good and uh
[1:43:00] but that
[1:43:01] was that was that summer was my first
[1:43:05] time to meet brother random face to face
[1:43:07] I got to be in their home a little bit
[1:43:10] be with the family just a little bit not
[1:43:12] quite like George Smith but
[1:43:17] uh now I treasure those
[1:43:21] times and I've had people tell me I had
[1:43:24] a brother tell me just out here the
[1:43:26] yesterday I think it was he said you
[1:43:27] know some of us would give our right arm
[1:43:30] if we could just meet the man you know
[1:43:32] and I understand that now but at that
[1:43:34] time I didn't I wasn't comprehending
[1:43:36] fully I knew who he was but I didn't
[1:43:39] have a revelation of who he
[1:43:41] was and I'm thankful to God that as I
[1:43:45] got older and God dealt with me that I
[1:43:48] got a
[1:43:48] revelation of who he was and of these
[1:43:51] things that I'd say let me tell you one
[1:43:52] other story about court I just it's a
[1:43:54] little story about brother George's son
[1:43:55] I hope he doesn't
[1:43:58] mind there's a message and I I I had one
[1:44:01] time I had it wrote down I don't have it
[1:44:02] with me I don't remember when it was
[1:44:04] exactly but brother random talked about
[1:44:08] uh I think he talked about
[1:44:13] when when he no when his when his father
[1:44:17] courted his
[1:44:18] mother he did
[1:44:20] so by horse and buggy
[1:44:23] youall know courted that means dated you
[1:44:25] know when his father courted his mother
[1:44:28] he did so by horse and buggy he said now
[1:44:30] when I when I courted my wife I did so
[1:44:33] by I think it was a Model A Ford one of
[1:44:37] those Fords model a Model T or something
[1:44:39] he said uh now when my son
[1:44:43] Billy courted his wife he did so with
[1:44:46] the fancy new sports
[1:44:49] car he said now this is what brother
[1:44:51] Bram said he said I suppose
[1:44:56] Someday my grandson will Court his wife
[1:45:00] by jet
[1:45:04] airplane now we are finding out more and
[1:45:08] more all the
[1:45:09] time that even the little things that
[1:45:13] the man of God said are coming to pass
[1:45:16] in this generation and I believe it has
[1:45:17] to be that because he said I'm as one
[1:45:19] born out of season to you Pentecostal
[1:45:21] people and I believe this is the season
[1:45:23] he was born for these are the times and
[1:45:25] we see many of those prophecies and many
[1:45:28] of those things he said coming to pass
[1:45:29] is that right but he said I suppose
[1:45:32] Someday my grandson will Court his wife
[1:45:35] by jet
[1:45:37] airplane and brother George's son he had
[1:45:39] a son his name was William they called
[1:45:41] him will we call him will
[1:45:45] today will was like a young a lot he was
[1:45:49] like a lot of young people around the
[1:45:52] message in American I'm sure here you
[1:45:55] know people young people have been
[1:45:57] brought up in message
[1:45:58] churches and uh they become
[1:46:03] interested in the other gender which is
[1:46:06] quite a blessing in this
[1:46:10] day
[1:46:12] and will I suppose was like all the
[1:46:14] other young people you know we we man
[1:46:17] listen I remember when I was single I
[1:46:19] would go to Every meeting I could I only
[1:46:21] worked enough to get enough gas G money
[1:46:23] to go to the next
[1:46:24] meeting and yeah I was there for the
[1:46:26] spiritual food and the spiritual benefit
[1:46:28] I loved it but I also had one eye
[1:46:33] open in
[1:46:36] fact I had one eye
[1:46:41] open at Tim Prince Youth Camp one
[1:46:46] year I had one eye open down at his
[1:46:48] Youth
[1:46:50] Camp I was a counselor
[1:46:53] and there was a little girl there that
[1:46:56] was a
[1:46:57] camper and she caught that one eye that
[1:46:59] was
[1:47:04] open but to continue with my
[1:47:07] story so will was like a lot of the
[1:47:09] young people he would go to different
[1:47:11] meetings and so forth now George at that
[1:47:14] time they lived in Tucson
[1:47:16] Arizona it's where will lived and
[1:47:19] somewhere along the line he was in a
[1:47:21] meeting I believe it was in mon
[1:47:24] Georgia and he met a
[1:47:27] girl which was Jack Palmer's
[1:47:33] granddaughter and
[1:47:35] uh you know you're just young people you
[1:47:37] meet people
[1:47:41] right I got to tell you I got to stop
[1:47:43] this and tell you stand up see this
[1:47:44] young man
[1:47:47] here we was in Youth Camp in Romania two
[1:47:49] years ago
[1:47:54] no no no stand
[1:47:57] up and so we decided to go on a little
[1:48:00] uh little Adventure away from the youth
[1:48:02] camp and so we were going to the where
[1:48:04] were we going to the salt mines where we
[1:48:06] going some sort of salt salt mine yes
[1:48:11] yeah we were going to a big attraction
[1:48:12] which is a salt mine there in in Romania
[1:48:14] they've got Carousel rides and
[1:48:17] everything there and so we were all it
[1:48:20] was it was a couple hours away and we
[1:48:21] were all just
[1:48:24] we were all going in different cars you
[1:48:26] know and I think I was riding with
[1:48:28] brother Gabriel and back here and this
[1:48:31] young man he had his own
[1:48:35] car and we were all kind of trying to
[1:48:37] stay together you
[1:48:40] know and he must have had a nice car I
[1:48:43] don't remember but he would come he
[1:48:46] would be behind us and he would come
[1:48:49] real fast and pass us and he'd go way
[1:48:52] down the road
[1:48:53] and a little while he'd slow down again
[1:48:55] and we'd catch up to him and he'd take
[1:48:58] off and go real fast again and we
[1:49:01] wouldn't see him for a while and pretty
[1:49:03] soon he did it again he'd slow down and
[1:49:05] he'd take off and go real
[1:49:08] fast it's all right if I'm embarass you
[1:49:12] yeah and so we he was he had passed us
[1:49:15] and we were going down the road and
[1:49:16] looked up
[1:49:18] there and there was a policeman that had
[1:49:20] a car pulled
[1:49:21] over and it was our brother now you can
[1:49:24] sit
[1:49:27] down but he had some girls in the
[1:49:31] car and I think some of those girls are
[1:49:33] here too aren't they
[1:49:36] yeah but you know message young people
[1:49:38] they can be normal young people you know
[1:49:41] all right back to brother
[1:49:44] will
[1:49:45] so and I'm just I don't know all the
[1:49:47] details but I just know how it ended up
[1:49:50] okay and so
[1:49:53] will became friends with her name's
[1:49:57] ranell right George ryell Palmer yeah
[1:50:01] Will became friends with ryell
[1:50:03] Palmer and uh from what I can gather
[1:50:07] they became
[1:50:09] friends and then they became better
[1:50:12] friends and then they became better
[1:50:15] friends and they became better friends
[1:50:18] and the next thing you know they were in
[1:50:21] love
[1:50:25] well there was a
[1:50:28] problem will lived in Tucson Arizona she
[1:50:32] lived in mon Georgia there's almost
[1:50:35] 2,000 miles between those two
[1:50:39] cities what are we going to do but you
[1:50:42] know them Smith
[1:50:46] boys they got a little bit on the
[1:50:50] ball pretty smart will got a job working
[1:50:56] with American
[1:51:00] Airlines and I don't know how it is now
[1:51:02] but I think back at that time if you
[1:51:04] worked for American Airlines you could
[1:51:05] fly free and from what I understand and
[1:51:08] I may be I think it's right from what I
[1:51:11] understand will would work all week long
[1:51:13] at American Airlines and then come the
[1:51:15] weekend he would hop a free jet ride to
[1:51:18] make in
[1:51:19] Georgia and where they had a little
[1:51:21] courtship with him and his his
[1:51:22] girlfriend his engageed or his his
[1:51:24] fiance and he eventually married this
[1:51:28] girl and they're living in Johnson City
[1:51:30] Tennessee
[1:51:31] today and
[1:51:33] thereby fulfilling the prophecy where
[1:51:36] the prophet of God said Someday I
[1:51:40] Suppose my grandson will Court his wife
[1:51:43] by jet airplane
[1:51:53] and we got to move along I just kind of
[1:51:56] cut this short
[1:51:57] here in 1963 after the seals were
[1:52:02] preached the crowds became so great at
[1:52:04] the brandham
[1:52:09] Tabernacle we would have the young
[1:52:11] people sitting on the altar in the front
[1:52:13] of the the pews we would have people
[1:52:16] sitting in the baptistry we would have
[1:52:17] people sitting in the Sunday School
[1:52:19] rooms we'd have people everywhere there
[1:52:21] was people standing along the wall
[1:52:23] sometimes there would be three and four
[1:52:24] people
[1:52:26] deep and it was such a a glorious thing
[1:52:29] to see that you know these were long
[1:52:31] sermons that brother Brandon priest and
[1:52:32] a lot of times you could see a brother
[1:52:34] get up and and another brother would sit
[1:52:36] down for a while and he would get up and
[1:52:37] give his seat uh really really Christian
[1:52:42] attitudes and uh but the the crowds were
[1:52:45] were just so great and
[1:52:48] one one day my father came home and he
[1:52:52] he said I was in a meeting today with
[1:52:55] brother brandom and the deacons and he
[1:52:59] said they asked that all the that that
[1:53:04] all the young men 13 years of age and
[1:53:08] older give up their
[1:53:10] seat 12 years of age and older I think
[1:53:13] all the young men 12 years of age and
[1:53:15] older give up their
[1:53:17] seats that somebody from out of town or
[1:53:20] across the out of the country could have
[1:53:22] a seat to sit and listen to the prophet
[1:53:25] he said and they said you young people
[1:53:27] uh can go out in the car and listen to
[1:53:29] it on the radio because they had the
[1:53:31] radio broadcast and there would be there
[1:53:33] would be 500 600 people sitting in cars
[1:53:35] listening to the message on the car
[1:53:37] radio because they couldn't get in the
[1:53:38] church he said now you just tell your
[1:53:41] your boys to to go out and and and uh
[1:53:44] sit in the car and and listen to it on
[1:53:46] the
[1:53:48] radio and uh so Mom and Dad decided that
[1:53:52] I was old enough and mature enough to
[1:53:54] give up my seat and go out and listen to
[1:53:56] the message on the car
[1:53:59] radio so I gave up my seat for somebody
[1:54:03] else now we would go out and sit in the
[1:54:05] car and probably for the first 15 20
[1:54:07] minutes half hour we would listen to the
[1:54:10] message then we would get sidetracked
[1:54:14] we'd get to talking and we'd get walk
[1:54:16] into the gas station and buy Coca-Cola
[1:54:18] and we didn't always listen to the
[1:54:21] message
[1:54:23] like we would have if we were inside the
[1:54:26] church so one
[1:54:28] day father come home and he said Kenny I
[1:54:32] want to tell you
[1:54:33] something he said we were in a meeting
[1:54:35] with brother
[1:54:37] brandham and he said
[1:54:39] uh he wasn't in the original meeting
[1:54:42] this is something the deacons did and
[1:54:44] the trustees did when brother Brandon
[1:54:46] was out of town he said we were in a
[1:54:47] meeting with brother brandham and the
[1:54:49] deacons told him what they had done how
[1:54:52] they had asked the young men 12 years of
[1:54:54] age and older to give up their seat so
[1:54:56] we'd have more seating for
[1:54:58] people and he said when the he said I
[1:55:01] was in that meeting he said when they
[1:55:02] told Brother brandom that he said
[1:55:04] brother brandom kind of looked up for a
[1:55:06] minute and then he looked back and he
[1:55:09] said God will bless those boys for that
[1:55:13] someday now if a prophet of God says
[1:55:17] that his grandson will Court by jet
[1:55:20] airplane it's going to come to
[1:55:24] pass prophet of God says God will bless
[1:55:27] those boys for that I stand before you
[1:55:31] as a spoken word blessing of a prophet
[1:55:33] of
[1:55:39] God I have been tremendously
[1:55:42] blessed traveling across the world you
[1:55:45] know I always had a desire to travel see
[1:55:47] the world our family was not wealthy but
[1:55:51] um
[1:55:52] I that was the desire of my heart to
[1:55:54] travel so when I started preaching the
[1:55:57] word offers started coming fund started
[1:56:01] coming by God's grace I've been to over
[1:56:03] 50 countries God has given me the desire
[1:56:06] my
[1:56:08] heart but that's not the end of the
[1:56:10] [Applause]
[1:56:13] story brother brandom died as as we know
[1:56:16] in
[1:56:17] 1965 after a while my father left
[1:56:20] Jeffersonville and went and started
[1:56:21] another church

[1:56:57] hot I had my own job had my own car had
[1:57:02] my own
[1:57:07] money and I
[1:57:10] decided that I didn't need church
[1:57:15] anymore I quit
[1:57:17] church I started running with a rough
[1:57:20] crowd a wild crowd
[1:57:33] you see I didn't need church
[1:57:35] anymore in my mind I'll tell you why

[1:57:43] brandham Tabernacle every Sunday
[1:57:45] morning and every Sunday night my father
[1:57:48] was a minister they used to have what
[1:57:51] they call Cottage prayer meetings house
[1:57:53] meetings and on Monday night brother
[1:57:56] Neville the pastor he would preach at a
[1:57:58] house meeting a cottage prayer meeting
[1:58:00] and my dad would always take the family
[1:58:02] and go and be the song leader for
[1:58:05] him well then the next night was Tuesday
[1:58:07] night my father preached at a house
[1:58:10] meeting a cottage prayer meeting and
[1:58:12] brother Neville would go and Lead songs
[1:58:14] for

[1:58:25] Church on Friday night they had a men's
[1:58:29] meeting at Brother Don rutles
[1:58:31] church and me being the oldest son I
[1:58:34] always had to go with my dad to the
[1:58:35] men's meeting now Saturday night I
[1:58:38] didn't have to go to church unless dad
[1:58:41] was preaching a Revival somewhere and
[1:58:42] then I had to go to church Saturday

[1:59:47] place my own job I had everything I
[1:59:49] didn't need nothing from nobody I was
[1:59:51] doing good good I thought in time we had
[1:59:55] two little
[2:00:08] boys married for about four
[2:00:11] years a little boy three and little boy
[2:00:15] two one Sunday night when I wasn't in
[2:00:18] church there came a knock at my door
[2:00:24] it was a police
[2:00:27] officer he said sir are you Mr
[2:00:32] caps I said yes sir he said I'm sorry to
[2:00:36] inform you your wife has been killed in
[2:00:39] an automobile
[2:00:50] accident what was I going to do
[2:00:52] do I had a little boy three a little boy
[2:00:59] two at the time's 22 years
[2:01:06] old young
[2:01:09] people you were raised in a in a Godly
[2:01:12] home I know you was you're reason you're
[2:01:16] here God put you in that home for a
[2:01:19] reason listen to your parents listen to
[2:01:22] your
[2:01:24] pastors God has never left a one of his
[2:01:27] own he's never lost one of
[2:01:30] his and if you're a child of God God's
[2:01:34] going to get you you can come hard or
[2:01:37] you can come
[2:01:40] easy say maybe maybe some other kid can
[2:01:43] do those things and nothing happens but
[2:01:46] you're a child of
[2:01:47] God God will get your attention one way
[2:01:51] or another God will get your attention
[2:01:53] young
[2:02:03] people being a single parent is the
[2:02:06] hardest job in the world you don't want
[2:02:08] to go through it if you don't have
[2:02:14] to but I stayed single and I raised
[2:02:18] those two
[2:02:20] boys they're alive today one of them's
[2:02:22] uh 47 one of them's
[2:02:26] 46 living up in
[2:02:29] Indiana I've got uh three
[2:02:32] grandchildren I've got one great
[2:02:44] grandchild but it's something you don't
[2:02:46] want to go
[2:02:49] through if God
[2:02:52] allowed you to be raised in a Christian
[2:02:55] Home a message
[2:02:57] home it's for a
[2:02:59] reason God doesn't do anything out of
[2:03:09] order life was
[2:03:12] hard life was hard working a full-time
[2:03:16] job
[2:03:22] getting up early in the morning before I
[2:03:23] go to work and take the children to my
[2:03:26] mom's house or whatever whoever was
[2:03:27] taking care of them getting off work
[2:03:30] late going picking up the children
[2:03:33] giving them a bath giving them
[2:03:35] everything they need giving them dinner
[2:03:37] and then this next day the same thing
[2:03:40] over and over
[2:03:41] again you know I had a lot of time to
[2:03:47] think life was really hard
[2:03:53] but you know I was raised in the
[2:03:54] brandham
[2:03:55] Tabernacle I knew the prophet I was in
[2:03:58] his
[2:03:59] home I'd never given my heart to the
[2:04:02] Lord I believe we've got young people
[2:04:05] here you've been raised in a message
[2:04:08] home you go to a church a message church
[2:04:12] and maybe you've never given your heart
[2:04:13] to the
[2:04:16] Lord I hope that's not the case but I
[2:04:20] suspect that it is
[2:04:25] and one night on Sunday
[2:04:29] night an Indiana cornfield I walked
[2:04:32] about three miles from my house and I
[2:04:34] walked out into the cornfield the corn
[2:04:35] was high it was over my head and I said
[2:04:38] Lord
[2:04:41] Jesus I I I'm sorry I've never asked you
[2:04:44] to come into my life but if you'll come
[2:04:47] into my life I'll live for you I'll
[2:04:50] serve you the rest of my life
[2:04:54] I walked home that
[2:04:57] night I didn't speak in
[2:04:59] tongues I didn't shout I didn't sing I
[2:05:03] just walked home that night and went to
[2:05:06] bed but the next morning when I got
[2:05:09] up there was something in
[2:05:12] me that told me that for the first time
[2:05:17] in my life God had heard my prayer
[2:05:29] and young people when you get serious
[2:05:31] with
[2:05:32] God you'll know that you've heard from
[2:05:37] God I got up that next morning and I
[2:05:40] felt so different I
[2:05:43] thought he's heard my prayer he's done
[2:05:47] what I asked him to
[2:05:49] do and then it became a miss mission for
[2:05:53] me to start studying God's word I
[2:05:56] studied it day and night I studied these
[2:05:59] books and listen to these tapes day and
[2:06:02] night I got back into a message church
[2:06:06] first church I went to Brother colen BR
[2:06:08] was brother Ed hunter in M Indiana you
[2:06:09] know
[2:06:12] him God began to deal with my
[2:06:16] heart I learned how to praise God listen
[2:06:19] what I told you this afternoon or this
[2:06:21] morning
[2:06:22] it's not just a story it's not just
[2:06:23] something to make you feel good it's not
[2:06:24] just something to cause a a lot of
[2:06:26] emotion it's true if you will praise God
[2:06:29] you say brother Ken are you sure I'm
[2:06:31] sure it happened to
[2:06:33] me just praise God you don't have to be
[2:06:37] a big fantastic thing but just praise
[2:06:40] God in your own way you need the Holy
[2:06:43] Ghost

[2:06:48] without the Holy Ghost you might have
[2:06:49] made it 50 years ago but you're not
[2:06:52] going to make it in this world without
[2:06:53] the Holy Ghost you need the Holy

[2:07:40] without you
[2:07:42] receiving what you have need of from
[2:07:46] God you know as God started to deal with
[2:07:49] me I began to think back on all the
[2:07:52] things I've seen and heard and I
[2:07:55] remembered what my dad told me that
[2:07:57] night he said brother Brenham said God
[2:07:59] will bless those boys for that

[2:08:15] years God blessed me with a wonderful
[2:08:19] wife God blessed me with another little
[2:08:21] boy boy he's 14 years old I believe he
[2:08:24] needs the Holy Ghost y'all pray for
[2:08:35] him but the thing is I gave up my seat I
