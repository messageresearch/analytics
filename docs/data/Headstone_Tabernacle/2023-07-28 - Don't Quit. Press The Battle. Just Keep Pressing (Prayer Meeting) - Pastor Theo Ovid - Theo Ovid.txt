different gifts different talents and Ministries to get his will across to us so this is the title don't quit press the button just keep pressing and sometimes we get despondent sometimes we feel to quit and to quit is to give up and let go to resign to depart the given to drop out the criticism stop doing something stop stop praying stop worshiping stop reading your Bible stop having Fellowship the acquitted I want to encourage you tonight don't quit now for the Brian give a story here and rejected King and I thought that it would be good to bring this to you he said I woke up I thought I'm Dreaming so much I wonder why I looked down and told his wife laying by me I raised up on my pillow and many of you people have done with my head upon the headboard of the bed and put my hands behind me I was laying there like this and said wow we just wonder what it will be the other side I'm already 50. I haven't done nothing yet if I can only do something to help the Lord if I know I won't be mortal half of my time is gone at least more than half live to be as old as my people still half of my time is gone I looked around I was laying there fixing together it was about seven o'clock I said I believe I go on to church this morning if I'm hoarse I'd like to hear but I'll never preach so I said are you awake honey and she was sleeping very soundly now I don't want you to miss this it has changed me I can't be the same brother Brandon that I was I looked and I heard something kept saying you're just starting press the button just keep pressing I shook my head and then I thought I probably was just thinking like this you know a person can get some imagination and I said I just probably imagined that it said press the button keep going keep going and I said maybe I said it so I put my lips between my teeth put my hand over my mouth and here it come again just keep pressing if you only knew what was at the end of the road I heard something say would you like to see just beyond the curtain I said it would help me so much and I looked and in just a moment one bread I come into a little place that and I look back and there I was laying on the bed this is a strange thing now I would not want you to repeat this this is before my church my sheep that I'm pastoring whether I wasn't like this body or not whether it was a translation I was like in a vision and I could look there and then I hit this little place I seen so many people come running screaming oh oh precious brother and I looked and a young woman maybe in the early 20s 18 to 20 they were throwing their arms around me and screaming our precious brother But Here Come a young man in the Brilliance of Young Manhood the eyes glistening look like stars in a dark night their teachers Fighters Pro they were screaming and grabbing me and screaming oh precious brother and I stood and I looked and I was young I stopped and I looked and I was young I look back at my old body laying there with my hands behind my head I said I don't understand this and this young woman threw in the arms around me no I do realize this is a mixed audience and I see this with the sweetness with the numbness of the spirit men kind of put your arm around woman without a human sensation but it wasn't deal there was no yesterday no tomorrow they didn't get tired I've never seen such pretty woman in all my life they had their hair way down to the waistline long skirts to their feet and they were just hugging me it was not hug like even my own sister sitting here without me they were not kissing me I wasn't kissing them it was something I have not got the vocabulary I haven't got the words to say perfection wouldn't touch it superb would even touch it nowhere it was something you have to beat here I look this way and that way and they were coming by the thousands I said I don't understand this and here come hope that was my first wife she run and never said my husband she said my precious brother and when she hugged me there was another woman standing there that hugged me and then who hugged this woman and I thought this has to be something different I taught oh would I ever want to go back to that old carcass again I look around dear and I thought what is this and I look real good and I said I can't understand this but hope seemed to be like a guest of honor she was not different but just like a guest of honor and I heard a voice that spoke to me that was in the room and said this is what you preached was the Holy Ghost this is perfect love and nothing can enter here without it I am more determined than ever in my life that it takes perfect love to enter there was no jealousy there was no tiredness there was no death sickness could never India mortality could never make you old they could not cry it was just one joy for my precious brother and they took me up and set me on a big high place and I thought I'm not dreaming I'm looking at my body laying there on the bed and they set me up here and I said oh I shouldn't be set here and here come women and men from both sides just in the bloom of Youth screaming and one woman was standing there she screamed oh my precious brother we are so happy to see you here I said I don't understand this and then that voice that was speaking from above me said you know it is written in the Bible that the prophets were guarded with their people I said yes I remember that in the scripture said why this is when you will gather your people I said then they are real I can feel them oh yes I said there are millions but there's not that many Brahms and the voice said they are not Brahms they are converts they are the ones you have led to the Lord and said some of them women dear that you think are so beautiful were better than 90 years old when you led them to the Lord no wonder they are screaming or precious brother on the screen all at once if you hadn't have went we wouldn't have been here I looked around and I thought well I don't get it I said oh where is Jesus I want to seem so bad they said no he's just a little higher right up that way someday he will come to you you see you were sent for a leader and God will come and when he does he will judge you according to what you taught them first whether they go in or not and we will go in according to your teacher I said oh I'm so glad that Paul does he have to stand like this your speech up this time like this and say yes I said and I preach every word I did preach I've never did it from it one side to the other where they baptized the name of the Jesus Christ I did too but they taught the baptism of the Holy Ghost I did too whatever they thought I did too and then people scream and said we know that we know we are going with you someday back to Earth said Jesus Will Come and you'll be judged according to the word that you preached us and then if you are accepted at that time which you will be said you will present us to him as your trophies of your ministry said you will guide us to him and all together we'll go back to Italy forever I said do you do I have to return back now yes well keep pressing on oh my keep pressing on things I never met another message my angels shall go before thee he said we who are in contact with the spiritual realm of God you said I was prayed for and it didn't get me healed I guess there's nothing to it what a poor crew beat you make for God see God warned somebody who will not give up a winner never quits and a quitter never wins if you've got to stay and call it call things right before Satan tell him it's this way God said alone the Lord has said it so and it is written it is written no matter what is this it is written you said brother never got to touch me it is written but Abraham never got done no healing God done your healing it's already did it it's written whatever I ask and believe God I shall receive it it is mine my personal property and since we have to begin to claim things as our personal property don't generalize it healing is mine uh Deliverance is mine Joy is mine Victor is mine you're claiming it as your puss not profit for the brown now go and let's do some conference now God lets it gets that way he brought Israel right into a trap mountains and deserts on both sides federal army pursuant potions of Chariots and Spears and a bunch of humbly report slaves not armed with nothing come down to the dead Red Sea to his bank here was the dust of the Chariots coming and here was a mountain on either side no weed looked like God was a bad military man let his people with no retreat then the prophet slipping here this year now sometimes he does that he let the doctor walk away and say they ain't going to live you're going to die that cancer are going to kill you you will never get out of that chair he seemed like he leaves you with no retreat but he is your retreat climb back into his arms Rod he is my refuge he's my multi-tower the name of the Lord is a magic Tower the righteous ruins and are thief the towers of Refuge he's our refuge no other Refuge but him I don't want to know any other Refugee he's my refuge he's my rock in the weary land a shelter in a time of storm I remember the first time I ever spoke in tongues I was preaching at the Milton Baptist Church and I was out there preaching and I got wound up and all those doctors sitting there looking at me and the Holy Ghost Came Upon me like jumped out in the middle of the eyes I began to speak with tongues I thought well what's happening now I never knew anything about it when I started back I heard my lips say this I'm the rock in a weary land the tower The Refuge at the time of stroma who I wondered and everyone look at one another like geese in a yard looking like and I felt the same way because I didn't know but I know that something had happened to me and I found the tower a hiding place I never wanted nothing else since then but that spot that blessed had in place right in the line of duty right under the fire of the enemy they was look like all Native was trembling for them what is to do what kind of whole a conference when the church gets to a place that this one is doing that this one doing this everything upside down don't quit the church hula conference of a permitting somewhere Moses elected a place he got behind a rock I said Lord God greet Jehovah who met me in a burden Bush that experiences have never left I've done everything they told me to do I'm standing in the line of duty I brought your people here I just said he under has the pillar of fire deer stands for your army he has the mountains and the Red Sea what must I do Lord must I give myself up what must I do in other words do I quit what do I do and I could see Angels begin to set on wrong each I want a conference and after a while this Spirit of the Lord I can see the pillar of fire move over what was it there was a decision made what are going to do give us and go back and try again listen I take this tonight God never goes backward never send these people to go back to what Moody said sanki said Simi said go forward amen and I'm all the clues and this is this key scripture I wanted to get to tonight on Proverbs 24 reading from verse 15 16 to 18 of community of 15 minutes from 16. and it says here for just man Proverbs 24 16. for a just man fallet seven times and Rises up again but the wicked shall fall into mischief verse 17. Rejoice not when thine enemy falled let no thine heart be glad when you stumbled least the Lord see it and then displease him and he turned away his right from him we want to take a little peek at this scripture for just man fallet seven times and Rise it up again but the wicked shall fall into mischief now I want you to note that there are two fallings here the Fallen adjustment and the Fallen of Awakened I want to say tonight Fallen is part of this journey the difference is how you are living when you fall the just man falls and the wicked for just or righteous is being upright and honest walking before God a just man will fall someone walking upright will face failure but it's his condition when he falls so thinking because you are serving the lord believe in his word you will not or cannot face failure is not correct if you think that way you will have disappointments a just man will fall not just once more than once the scripture declares seven times we tend to wipe out others on just one fall but adjustment Follet seven times more than once adjustment the key here he rises up again this is it friends don't quit press the button get back up and keep pressing on failure is not final Jehovah has the final scene that is Paul Hayes heavenly father I thank you Lord I don't know who this is for but Lord this is the word this is the truth sometimes we have fairy tales in our mind about saving you but this is your word Lord a righteous man may fall but you would hold them up God falling doesn't mean finish fully doesn't mean object failure and that's the final thing as the song says Jehovah has the final thing oh God we were born in sin and shape iniquity and they call us out and as we walk different things happen different tragedies different things we can't explain and we hold on to Romans 8 28 we know that all things work together for good to them that love you to them what they call the quantitative purpose sometimes they instruct us sometimes they rebuke us sometimes that guide us to grow us to mature us to form character in us but whatever it takes long it will take all these experiences to make us who we are it's not just what when we fall but the condition we are in in fallen father bless the people tonight those who are here in this virtual room here struggling those who are here who might be in some condition here Freedom tonight that they wouldn't think about quitted they wouldn't think about letting go and giving up or walking away but they will think about pressing the button press the button keep pressing on bless them tonight as they're getting in prayer in Jesus might ask it amen and amen God bless you I trust this exhortation tonight would have helped you in some way and be a blessing to you in some way that God what that your feet will be anointed in God and struggles and battles is part of this whole program that God has God be with you as we get on in prayer at this time thank you [Music] [Music] foreign [Music]
