[13:15] knock lord and the cedar door open to
[13:18] ask and for lord our request to be made
[13:21] known and to our request to be answered
[13:23] so we commit this teaching and this
[13:25] service into your hands tonight may you
[13:27] take complete control in the precious
[13:29] name of jesus christ amen amen and amen
[13:32] certainly appreciate everyone tonight
[13:34] for being here it's been a while i was
[13:37] uh saying to my wife i i feel like i'm
[13:40] i'm in strange territory a little bit
[13:43] but um but it's good to be back in
[13:45] fellowship where the purchase of the
[13:47] blood of jesus christ i said we want to
[13:49] salute our pastor in a special way for
[13:52] uh the last series of bible studies i
[13:56] have been truly blessed and verified and
[13:58] i know you have been as well and we
[14:01] salute him
[14:02] uh for that and uh salute the church
[14:05] as we become
[14:06] you know seasoned out and more mature in
[14:09] in so much of the word that is opening
[14:12] up to us
[14:13] uh in so many different ways to bring us
[14:15] closer to him closer to each other and a
[14:19] greater clarity of god's thoughts
[14:22] uh to us you know so
[14:24] i'd like to get straight into tonight i
[14:27] i'm not quite sure how long i'm going to
[14:29] be tonight and i'm i'm trusting god to
[14:32] unfold this so i can't see if it'll be
[14:34] short i can't say if it will be long but
[14:36] we are here in our homes are connected
[14:39] by faith connected by the blood of the
[14:41] lord
[14:42] and on the expectation for god to help
[14:44] us in some way so before i get into the
[14:47] actual teaching you know i want to kind
[14:49] of lay a little background um
[14:52] taken uh something from paul
[14:54] uh in philippians so we're gonna go to
[14:56] philippians 1
[14:58] and we're going to start there only
[15:00] because it kind of sets the tone
[15:02] for where i want to go it's not our
[15:04] substantive text tonight
[15:06] but i just feel led to start there
[15:10] to kind of help us uh as we go into this
[15:13] tonight
[15:14] so
[15:15] philippians one and this one i trust you
[15:17] have your bibles i trust you're here
[15:20] ready for action i trust that you have
[15:22] you know
[15:23] taken your coffee you have put things in
[15:26] place you have you know to know of all
[15:28] the distractions you have you know put
[15:30] your cell phone on silence you've done
[15:32] everything in your power to do to be
[15:34] able to be fully present and fully
[15:37] engaged you know um we want to be able
[15:40] uh you know for the time that we are
[15:42] here and when you really look at it
[15:44] it's not much time we get together you
[15:46] know when you really look at it
[15:48] compared to how much time you spend on
[15:50] work and and commuting to work or doing
[15:53] other things you know if you are like
[15:55] those who are really into watching the
[15:57] news and and stuff you know people who
[15:59] are consistent at that you know when you
[16:01] do that seven days a week you might
[16:02] actually challenge the time you spend
[16:04] together in church and a wrong church
[16:06] business you know so we don't want this
[16:08] to be you know a side show for us but we
[16:10] are here tonight because we want this to
[16:12] be the main thing you know we want to
[16:14] come tonight you know for this to be our
[16:16] our excitement our joy we are we are
[16:19] under great expectation for this to
[16:21] unfold to us that we could be stronger
[16:23] all right so i want to read philippians
[16:25] one
[16:26] and we're going to reach the philippians
[16:28] uh pretty quickly only because it's
[16:30] still a foundation of where we want to
[16:32] go
[16:33] so this is paul
[16:34] and he is he is writing actually um in
[16:39] prison he's writing in in prison and and
[16:41] i want us to to kind of see the
[16:43] perspective here
[16:45] um
[16:46] or
[16:47] he's writing kind hannah you know so
[16:50] let's take it so paul and timotheus
[16:52] which is timothy bond the servants of
[16:55] or servants of jesus christ i'll be
[16:57] happy five years so i cannot jump in
[16:58] between paul and timotheus the servants
[16:59] of jesus christ to all the saints in
[17:02] christ jesus which are at philippi with
[17:04] the bishops and deacons so
[17:07] paul is addressing all the believers so
[17:09] so it's a call to action to all of the
[17:11] believers tonight all right i want us to
[17:13] take a cue from paul and how he
[17:15] approaches things because we now truly
[17:17] would that when brother branham
[17:19] referenced paul he would always say that
[17:21] paul was the gold standard he was the
[17:23] the the measuring rod by which every
[17:26] messenger would come afterwards you know
[17:29] and and for for as much as we go through
[17:32] our adversity
[17:34] it is really something else to watch
[17:35] paul speak through his adversity
[17:38] grace be unto you and peace from god our
[17:41] father and from the lord jesus christ i
[17:43] thank my god upon every remembrance of
[17:47] you
[17:49] that's a powerful statement
[17:52] how lightly how how casual do we take
[17:56] the remembrance of the brethren
[17:58] sometimes when i read these things it
[18:00] makes me pause to look at myself and say
[18:03] but wait a minute look at how paul
[18:05] approaching this thing i thank my god
[18:08] upon every remembrance of you every time
[18:10] he remembers the believers he thanks god
[18:13] for it
[18:14] doesn't that kind of shake you a little
[18:16] bit to how paul's love for the people
[18:18] and the brethren well
[18:20] let listen to verse four now always in
[18:23] every prayer of mine for you all making
[18:26] requests with joy so so in his prayer is
[18:30] not a case of he ever run out of things
[18:33] to pray for because in every prayer he
[18:36] was praying for them with a request for
[18:38] joy for your fellowship in the gospel
[18:40] from the first day until now
[18:42] being confident of this very thing that
[18:45] he which have begun a good work in you
[18:48] will perform it until the day of jesus
[18:50] christ what what an encouragement you
[18:52] know so so reading this should kind of
[18:54] give us a lift kind of increases but
[18:56] anthony would say sometimes getting
[18:57] temperature we're testing in temperature
[18:59] a little bit
[19:00] verse seven even as as it is meat for me
[19:04] or fit for me to think this of you all
[19:06] because i have you in my heart in as
[19:08] much as both in my bonds i want us to
[19:11] catch that there
[19:13] all right
[19:14] so
[19:14] so
[19:15] i want to read that personally amplified
[19:17] it is right for me to feel this way
[19:19] about you
[19:20] because you have me in your heart
[19:23] as i have you in my heart
[19:25] since both in my imprisonment and in the
[19:28] defense and confirmation of the good
[19:30] news
[19:32] all of you share in grace with me
[19:37] verse 8 for god is my record how greatly
[19:40] i long after you all in the bowels of
[19:43] jesus christ
[19:46] and this i pray that you'll love me
[19:48] abound yet more and more in knowledge
[19:51] and all judgment i want to capture that
[19:54] in the amplified we are building
[19:56] somewhere and this i pray you that your
[19:58] love may abound more and more displaying
[20:01] itself in greater depth in real
[20:04] knowledge and practical insight now i
[20:06] love that
[20:07] because one of the challenges we have as
[20:10] believers is the practical application
[20:13] of the word our daily lives and this is
[20:15] what we really are contending for that
[20:18] we are not super spiritual beings
[20:20] floating around
[20:22] but we have a practical application of
[20:24] the word to deal with the real issues
[20:28] that come up every day from a real
[20:30] seasoned mature perspective so paul is
[20:33] saying i pray that you'll love me about
[20:35] yet more and more in knowledge so we are
[20:38] here tonight in our bible study to grow
[20:41] in our knowledge and in all judgment and
[20:43] our understanding in our decision making
[20:46] our situations arise and come to us that
[20:48] we have never had to deal with before
[20:51] decisions and questions and but but but
[20:53] because we are getting stronger and
[20:55] because we are growing and because we
[20:56] are getting more mature we can handle it
[20:59] and paul's prayer
[21:01] itself speaks to the fact that there was
[21:03] more growing to be done that there was
[21:05] more knowledge to be acquired that there
[21:08] was more insight and judgment to begin
[21:10] right listen to verse 10 that he may
[21:12] approve things that are excellent
[21:15] you see how paul speaking
[21:17] in the amplified it says so that you may
[21:19] learn to recognize and treasure what is
[21:22] excellent
[21:24] you see how paul is challenging them to
[21:27] step beyond mediocrity
[21:31] this is not the substantive text you
[21:33] know this is just paul writing in prison
[21:37] that he may approve things that are
[21:39] excellent so he's challenging them
[21:41] here in verse 10
[21:43] so that you may learn to recognize and
[21:46] treasure what is excellent
[21:48] listen in the amplified it says
[21:50] identifying the best
[21:52] and distinguishing moral differences
[21:56] you see what paul is desiring what was
[21:59] in paul's heart
[22:01] for those believers
[22:04] and see why this bible study and these
[22:07] sessions have so much meaning to us
[22:09] because it is helping us to become more
[22:11] discerning in what we treasure
[22:13] discerning in the conversations we have
[22:15] discerning and how we spend our time
[22:17] discerning and what we do where we go
[22:19] what we see
[22:22] that and continuing verse 10 that he may
[22:24] be sincere and without offense till the
[22:27] day of christ
[22:28] so he's challenging them that you may be
[22:30] in the amplified pure and blameless
[22:33] until the day of christ listen
[22:36] actually living lives that lead others
[22:39] away from sin
[22:41] my my mind
[22:42] you see that there
[22:44] so you see it it's not a selfish life
[22:46] you know i in the message and and the
[22:48] bride i know the bride is called and you
[22:50] in your little cubicle yeah it is paul
[22:53] is challenging them
[22:55] that you would be sincere and without
[22:57] offense and in the amplified it speaks
[22:59] of living lives that lead others away
[23:02] from sin
[23:03] what a challenge to us all what kind of
[23:05] encouragement to us verse 11 being
[23:08] filled with the fruits of righteousness
[23:10] which are by jesus christ
[23:12] unto the glory and praise of god
[23:16] but listen this is where i really want
[23:18] to get to now this is that's just paul
[23:20] you know getting to his own point as
[23:22] well and bringing me closer to my point
[23:25] as well
[23:26] but i would you should understand
[23:28] bredrin
[23:30] and this is how we should speak you know
[23:33] and and and this reminds me if i can
[23:35] mention it of sister palms no to praise
[23:38] last sunday that blew me away completely
[23:41] it's very rare to see but somebody write
[23:44] a note of praise that speaks of going
[23:46] into a situation you know until they
[23:48] really get our revelation the clarity of
[23:51] what this all means but fear paul saying
[23:54] it speaking since about speaking like
[23:56] like paul
[23:57] but i would he should understand regin
[23:59] that the things which happened unto me
[24:01] have fallen out rather unto the
[24:03] furtherance of the gospel in other words
[24:05] i don't want to totally feel sorry for
[24:07] me
[24:08] because a greater thing has happened
[24:11] because of my situation
[24:12] okay so listen to this in the amplified
[24:15] now i want you to know believers that
[24:17] what has happened to me this
[24:19] imprisonment that was meant to stop me
[24:22] has actually served to advance the
[24:24] spread of the good news regarding
[24:26] salvation
[24:28] all right
[24:29] verse 13 so that in my bonds in christ
[24:32] are manifest in all the palace and in
[24:35] all other places in other words paul is
[24:37] saying my imprisonment in the course of
[24:40] christ has become common knowledge
[24:43] throughout the whole imperial god
[24:45] so they put paul in prison and he was
[24:47] convincing the imperial god he pales god
[24:50] to become christians
[24:53] only seeing this so not because paul in
[24:55] prison he abandoned the call upon his
[24:58] life
[24:59] not because in prison he said only
[25:00] moping i wonder the believers praying
[25:02] for me i wanna i know nobody come and
[25:04] check me and nobody come and call me i
[25:06] go into a hard time paul in his prison
[25:10] and he instead of walking on the streets
[25:12] he's had to walk in the prison oh lord
[25:14] help me anybody with me he's had to
[25:16] convert the imperial god and to everyone
[25:19] else the bible says now let's go verse
[25:21] 14
[25:23] we're building into where trying to go
[25:24] tonight
[25:25] and many of the brethren in the lord
[25:29] waxing
[25:30] confident by my bonds are much more bold
[25:34] to speak the word without fear
[25:36] so paul is saying that because of how i
[25:39] am living my life in my trial
[25:42] because when you're living and
[25:44] everything is good there's really not
[25:45] much learning to come from that but paul
[25:48] is saying
[25:49] that many of the brethren waxed him
[25:51] confident by my bonds you don't realize
[25:55] tonight how much how you deal with your
[25:58] trial could affect somebody else
[26:01] let me say that one more time
[26:04] how you deal with your situation your
[26:07] trial your obstacle your prison whatever
[26:09] that is tonight has an impact on other
[26:12] people
[26:13] so clearly paul was addressing other
[26:16] brethren who were perhaps weaker than he
[26:18] was who when they saw how he was fearing
[26:22] in the face of his challenge they got
[26:24] courage and confidence from it anybody
[26:26] with me
[26:27] all right
[26:29] now we are still building to where i
[26:31] want to go verse 15
[26:32] this is where it gets interesting for me
[26:34] now
[26:35] some indeed preach christ
[26:38] listen evil of envy and strife
[26:42] and some also of good will
[26:45] now just blow my mind completely
[26:49] so paul is said
[26:51] christ is being preached
[26:53] some of envy and strife and in verse 15
[26:55] and he amplified
[26:57] some it is true are actually preaching
[27:00] christ out of envy and rivalry toward me
[27:06] for no better reason than a competitive
[27:09] spirit or misguided ambition
[27:13] so this this thing here with
[27:16] church conflict and ministry conflict
[27:19] and competition and ambition is not a
[27:21] new thing you know
[27:23] paul is in prison acknowledging listen
[27:26] here
[27:27] that that some it is true are actually
[27:30] preaching christ out of envy and rivalry
[27:33] toward me so paul had rivals
[27:36] there were other preachers who were
[27:38] rivals to paul there were other
[27:40] ministers who were envious of paul and
[27:43] he says and he amplified for no other
[27:46] reason than a competitive spirit
[27:49] so there are people who just have a
[27:51] competitive spirit and paul was calling
[27:54] it out
[27:55] or misguided ambition the issue is not
[27:58] ambition the issue is misguided ambition
[28:00] all right so some indeed preach christ
[28:03] even of envy and strive to be
[28:05] contentious and some also of good will
[28:08] in the amplified they say others out of
[28:10] good will and a loyal spirit toward me
[28:13] listen to verse 16 the one preached
[28:15] christ of contention
[28:19] not sincerely
[28:21] supposing to add affliction to my bonds
[28:25] no this is this is serious stuff here
[28:28] so paul is saying here the latter
[28:30] the troublemakers preach christ out of
[28:33] love the latter preach uh christ out of
[28:35] love
[28:37] because they know that i've been put
[28:38] here by god for the defense of the
[28:40] gospel but the former preached christ
[28:42] insincerely out of selfish ambition
[28:46] just self-promotion
[28:48] thinking that they are causing me
[28:49] distress in my imprisonment that is the
[28:51] amplified version of it but others have
[28:53] love in verse 17 knowing that i am set
[28:57] for the defense of the gospel
[29:00] and listen to how paul concludes this
[29:03] so what then notwithstanding every way
[29:07] whether in pretense or in truth christ
[29:10] is preached and i there and do rejoice
[29:13] here and will rejoice
[29:15] so paul takes a super mature position
[29:18] he is saying i'm locked up there are
[29:20] people who are preaching because they
[29:22] want to cause issue they're preaching
[29:24] because i can be out there preaching so
[29:25] because of that they are taking full
[29:27] advantage of my absence from the field
[29:29] and there are those who are preaching to
[29:31] encourage me they are those who are
[29:32] preaching and i want you to catch this
[29:34] with selfish motives
[29:36] with different agendas and they are
[29:38] those preaching with good motives
[29:41] different motives at work but they all
[29:44] have the same objective to preach christ
[29:46] and paul is saying you know what
[29:49] in verse 18
[29:50] notwithstanding
[29:52] so i'm overlooking the motive at this
[29:54] point
[29:55] because
[29:56] once christ is
[29:58] preached i am rejoicing in this thing
[30:02] but what really caught my attention
[30:04] friends and this is where we want to
[30:05] kind of spend some time tonight
[30:07] by the grace of god
[30:09] is really
[30:11] this issue of motive
[30:14] because paul
[30:15] up until this point was highlighted to
[30:18] the believers in filipi listen
[30:21] people could be doing things
[30:24] and their motives
[30:26] is a whole different story
[30:29] and tonight
[30:30] for a few minutes i want to ask a
[30:32] question which is the theme of my bible
[30:34] study tonight and a statement what is
[30:38] your motive
[30:40] secret motives
[30:42] bible study
[30:43] what is your motive
[30:45] secret motives
[30:47] bible study
[30:49] let's have a conversation tonight
[30:51] behind every action is a motive
[30:56] it's impossible for you to do anything
[30:59] without a motive
[31:01] behind every word there's a motive
[31:06] behind anything that is created there is
[31:09] a motive
[31:11] motive is the why
[31:14] behind what we do
[31:16] motive the why behind what anybody does
[31:22] the action may be a good action
[31:24] but the why or the motive
[31:27] may not be good
[31:30] when satan started his conversation with
[31:33] eve he had a motive
[31:36] he wasn't feeling as bad over would say
[31:38] conversationish
[31:39] he wasn't feeling to just have a
[31:41] conversation
[31:42] he came to have a conversation with a
[31:45] motive
[31:46] eve did not understand the motives
[31:50] if eve knew
[31:52] where this conversation would have led
[31:54] or understood the intent of the
[31:57] conversation the reason behind the
[31:59] conversation
[32:00] the motive of the conversation
[32:03] she would have hit the bricks
[32:05] because she didn't understand the road
[32:07] that she was going down anybody with me
[32:10] and here's our first lesson tonight if
[32:14] we don't understand the motive it
[32:17] doesn't change the fact
[32:19] that the motive is there
[32:21] now
[32:22] motives drive us
[32:25] motives don't have to all be negative
[32:28] they are positive
[32:30] motives could be positive
[32:32] motives could be negative
[32:34] and motives are connected to words
[32:37] and to actions
[32:38] so i found myself thinking recently you
[32:41] know my daughter picked up something and
[32:42] i said you know if she put it in her
[32:44] mouth that's a problem so when i take it
[32:46] from her
[32:47] she of course is disappointed she cries
[32:49] she will draw a tantrum
[32:51] she doesn't understand at this point in
[32:54] time that that could be a danger
[32:57] my motive is not to make her cry
[33:00] my motive is not to get to the throat
[33:03] tantrum
[33:05] my motive is to protect her
[33:08] because she doesn't understand the
[33:10] danger or the motive
[33:12] we have a conflict
[33:15] anybody with me
[33:17] motive is all about the heart
[33:20] so we're going to kind of get a bit
[33:21] deeper tonight because this year could
[33:23] be a turning point for somebody in this
[33:25] room tonight we're speaking about motive
[33:28] why we do what we do why we say what we
[33:32] see and i had like four questions what
[33:34] is your motive
[33:36] what is their motive
[33:39] what is god's motive what is satan's
[33:42] motive and it comes all down to motive
[33:45] because you
[33:47] who have a motive for what you do
[33:49] there are people around us who may
[33:52] appear to be our friends who have
[33:55] very very
[33:57] demonic motives behind what they do
[34:01] and they are people who may be
[34:03] rough or unfavorable to us who actually
[34:06] have good motives
[34:09] how many people say well but robert
[34:11] spoke rough to men oh yeah
[34:13] what what was the motive
[34:18] when god corrects somebody through
[34:20] certain things
[34:24] why god do that what is the motive
[34:28] so i'm going to come and i'm going to
[34:30] come into your house a little bit but i
[34:31] want to kind of
[34:33] build a little bit into that
[34:35] motive is all about the heart
[34:39] motive speaks our deeper desires
[34:44] which can be good or bad
[34:48] so somebody you have a friend you have a
[34:50] family member you have somebody who you
[34:53] know living a certain kind of life and
[34:54] you're and you're drawing closer to them
[34:57] what is your motive for doing that
[34:59] because i've come to the realization
[35:01] that when somebody backslide
[35:04] it is because of an issue of motive
[35:06] before it became an issue of action
[35:09] anybody with me tonight
[35:12] now
[35:12] let's kind of go a little deeper
[35:15] there are many types of motives it will
[35:17] be impossible to go through them all
[35:19] tonight
[35:20] for somebody their motive is recognition
[35:23] and all they really want is recognition
[35:26] that doesn't have to be a
[35:28] bad motive
[35:30] but sometimes in the desire for
[35:32] recognition
[35:34] people compromise
[35:36] and the motive of wanting to be
[35:39] recognized the motive of wanting to be
[35:42] respected so that's emotive so they want
[35:43] respect so because they want respect
[35:45] they they they they join a gang
[35:48] befo because they want respect and
[35:50] emotive is like nobody respect me nobody
[35:52] noticed me nobody when you dig deeper to
[35:55] the reason and they are motives that are
[35:57] surface level and they are even deeper
[36:00] all right arrive at
[36:01] me ride with me
[36:04] maybe our motive is to teach somebody a
[36:06] lesson
[36:07] you find you had it hard
[36:09] so nobody must have it easy
[36:13] so your motive is to make things as hard
[36:15] for people as possible
[36:19] anybody with me
[36:20] i want to just help you process some of
[36:23] this tonight
[36:25] as we get closer to god
[36:29] we need to start to look at both actions
[36:32] and motives
[36:34] we need to begin to look at both words
[36:38] and motives
[36:41] when we look closely at our lives and i
[36:43] want us to catch just tonight if it's
[36:45] one thing we catch tonight is this
[36:47] when we look closely at our lives there
[36:49] are really only two things that affect
[36:51] us on a daily basis
[36:53] we're dealing now with the issues of
[36:55] life
[36:56] we're dealing with life and godliness
[36:58] we're dealing with challenges and
[37:00] stresses they're really only two things
[37:02] that affect us when a day comes it's
[37:05] words and actions that's it you know
[37:09] that's it
[37:10] somebody says something to us that we
[37:12] don't like
[37:13] that could throw your whole day in a
[37:15] tailspin
[37:16] somebody says something to you that's
[37:18] good
[37:19] that could change your whole day
[37:21] because somebody said he write words to
[37:22] you
[37:25] but somebody can say something to you
[37:27] that is a bad thing get you upset and
[37:29] they can actually have the right motive
[37:31] behind it
[37:33] and somebody can at least see something
[37:36] good that have you feeling like like a
[37:38] queen or a king
[37:39] but behind here is evil and you riding
[37:42] the wave of that
[37:45] how many young brothers young sisters
[37:48] get trapped with nice words and bad
[37:50] motives
[37:54] anybody with me tonight can i can we can
[37:56] we can we go a little bit all of our
[37:59] challenges issues and frustrations come
[38:02] from our failure to understand motives
[38:06] i will say that
[38:07] twice
[38:08] all not some all of our challenges
[38:12] issues and frustrations come from our
[38:16] failure to understand motives we're
[38:20] gonna get into the scriptures in a bit
[38:22] how many arguments in your home could be
[38:25] avoided if you paused to understand the
[38:30] motives
[38:32] i'll say that one more time
[38:34] how many arguments in your home could be
[38:37] avoided if you paused to understand the
[38:41] motive
[38:43] sometimes people desire to do a good
[38:46] thing
[38:46] a nice thing a right thing but it will
[38:49] come out too good and you fly off the
[38:52] handle because it'll come out good but
[38:54] you fear to even consider the motive the
[38:58] desire what are they trying to achieve
[39:01] so simple things
[39:03] why decide to eye on these shirts
[39:05] and the the line not holy i i hear big
[39:08] arguments over the way the shirt was a
[39:10] hand
[39:12] the wife trying to do a a favor blessing
[39:16] and i said and a man said well he got
[39:18] ironic so you ever seen him i should
[39:19] also
[39:20] and that turned a whole break in the
[39:23] home
[39:24] because the man couldn't see beyond the
[39:26] action to go to the motive
[39:30] the motive wasn't to put a new crease on
[39:32] your shirt the motive was to be a
[39:34] blessing by surprise junior by ironing
[39:36] his shirt and because you can't see
[39:38] beyond the action to the motive you will
[39:40] become a volcano
[39:42] a dormant volcano explode because you
[39:44] couldn't separate action
[39:47] from motive i don't know who this is
[39:48] going to help tonight
[39:50] but as we become more like god because
[39:53] the scripture speaks about god filtering
[39:55] way in both actions and motives he
[39:58] doesn't look at one in isolation
[40:02] so we talk about wanting to be more like
[40:04] jesus we want to be more like god well
[40:07] the closer we get to god we suddenly
[40:09] develop this ability to consider both
[40:12] the action and the motive behind the
[40:15] action
[40:17] how many conflicts or situations in your
[40:20] job could be mitigated if you pause to
[40:23] understand
[40:24] the motive
[40:27] would you have the same friends in your
[40:30] neighborhood
[40:31] in your family on your job
[40:33] if you really knew the motive
[40:38] you see because god could discern the
[40:42] the heart and the issue that he had you
[40:44] know somebody bring food for you
[40:47] and if you
[40:48] is my connection fine
[40:51] yeah and if you don't understand the
[40:54] motive and you
[40:57] realize what's going on
[41:00] say
[41:01] my wife don't cook sooner
[41:08] it might sound simple friends but if you
[41:11] don't know the motive
[41:14] behind the action you'll find yourself
[41:17] in the problem
[41:21] this is not no deep mystery but i've
[41:23] seen too many brothers fall with it
[41:26] with this so i don't want to act i don't
[41:28] want us to act as if we we don't know
[41:30] these these things happen we are not
[41:32] naive we we want to be we want to be
[41:34] sharp and understand
[41:37] if we don't pause
[41:40] now i had to learn to walk around with a
[41:43] magnifying glass on everybody and try to
[41:45] figure out what's the motive i'm not
[41:46] telling you walk
[41:49] because they are spirits operating upon
[41:52] people
[41:55] and we see it when we get into the book
[41:57] of acts
[41:58] about the door being open
[42:00] to spirits operating and you now
[42:03] recognize that you are now exposed
[42:09] let's talk about family a little bit
[42:12] before we get into the scriptures this
[42:14] is what the lord put on my heart i don't
[42:15] know if if it's helping anybody
[42:17] because it's one of the things that i
[42:19] think troubles me with young people and
[42:21] their relationships with their parents i
[42:23] would have touched on husband and wife
[42:25] and on it any motive so so
[42:28] for example you grew up in your house
[42:31] eating food a certain way and your wife
[42:34] make it different and because of that
[42:36] uvex
[42:37] you know i know how it's supposed to
[42:39] make it and that's a whole issue
[42:42] friends it might be your issue but there
[42:44] are people this is the issue
[42:46] so bear with us
[42:48] while i help somebody with this issue
[42:52] and you fail to see the motive behind
[42:54] trying to prepare a meal and you so
[42:56] focus on the action of the food not the
[42:59] way you thought it's supposed to be
[43:02] that it creates contention in your home
[43:06] and if you
[43:07] can't i want to say this look beyond the
[43:08] action even the word people say things
[43:10] they don't mean
[43:12] because the motive behind it is to
[43:13] actually improve the situation but they
[43:15] don't know how to do it
[43:17] so they said the wrong thing in an
[43:19] attempt to improve the situation the
[43:20] more previous right you know
[43:23] but the words they use to try to fix
[43:26] this situation maybe the wrong words but
[43:28] they already genuinely honestly have the
[43:31] motive of commentary resolution
[43:34] anybody with me
[43:37] so i want us to become more mature
[43:40] because paul in the scripture we read
[43:43] was beginning to highlight this nuance
[43:47] in motive and action and showing that
[43:49] there is a difference
[43:51] there are times to focus on the action
[43:53] that
[43:55] times are really warning on the motive
[43:57] because the motive
[43:59] ultimately is what is what is most
[44:01] important so back to the parents i find
[44:04] it very hard i wrote it here no i find
[44:07] it hard to believe that a believer has a
[44:10] negative motive when it comes to their
[44:12] children that's what i wrote in my notes
[44:16] i find it hard to believe that a
[44:18] believer has a negative
[44:21] motive when it comes to their children
[44:22] and if the younger ones not just
[44:25] children but as we mature as we get
[44:27] older to really deserve and understand
[44:31] i may not be a hundred percent in
[44:32] agreement
[44:34] but what is the motive
[44:35] because if i try to understand a motive
[44:37] that could help bring resolution to a
[44:39] conflict
[44:40] why believers have so much conflict in
[44:43] home in marriage on the job among
[44:45] believers
[44:46] too much conflict paul spent a lot of
[44:48] time through different
[44:51] letters dealing with conflicting
[44:56] anybody with me have you stopped to
[44:59] consider the motive
[45:01] so your parents said don't go so and so
[45:03] don't i don't waste spending time with
[45:05] someone so
[45:06] my parents are either help they're
[45:08] trying to scrap my style they try to
[45:10] think anything
[45:11] and you don't understand that they're
[45:13] trying to protect you
[45:15] because of love for you because of
[45:16] concern for you because they don't know
[45:18] how
[45:19] that will turn out
[45:23] they don't know where that road will
[45:24] lead
[45:27] and you're going on a road that you may
[45:28] not see and and they may not have the
[45:30] education you have but in their heart
[45:32] they see this thing and they know
[45:33] something not adding up
[45:36] and the motive is to protect you but you
[45:39] and your arrogance
[45:42] because you have two subjects
[45:44] and two piece of paper
[45:46] decide to say well i know better and
[45:48] then when you hit your head you still
[45:50] come back home to the same home
[45:52] to the same father the same mother the
[45:54] same person who cramped your style why
[45:57] do we have to go through that cycle of
[45:58] pain before we come back to resolution
[46:01] because if we really understand the
[46:03] motive
[46:07] i look back at my own life and i
[46:09] contemplate
[46:10] conversations when i was younger i asked
[46:13] myself if i really had listened and
[46:15] understood
[46:17] and paused and really considered the
[46:19] motive
[46:22] what would have been different
[46:25] now we can't live and regret because you
[46:27] can't change your past but i'm
[46:28] challenging us as a people to
[46:31] reboot the system as it will
[46:34] be transformed the bible said by the
[46:36] renewing of your mind
[46:38] a paradigm shift as it will
[46:41] to recalibrate into what god's motive is
[46:45] whatever i'm saying you could take it to
[46:46] a better sickness he could turn your
[46:48] wife against him turn the church against
[46:50] you what is the motive to frustrate you
[46:51] was he
[46:53] the motive to punish
[46:56] need to
[46:57] bring your character into a level of
[46:59] maturity and you can say there's my
[47:02] spirit flowing freely
[47:06] so if you see god's motive for what he's
[47:09] doing then should our attitude be
[47:11] different our approach different our
[47:13] response different front
[47:16] is this helping anybody tonight
[47:20] so go deeper into this issue of motive
[47:24] is about really asking deep questions
[47:30] why do you do what you do
[47:34] i have seen people remove from being a
[47:36] deacon and leave the church
[47:41] because a change in the situation
[47:43] uncovered deeper
[47:45] motives
[47:49] could you do
[47:50] what you do for the lord if nobody says
[47:53] thank you
[47:56] because if you're feeding on the thank
[47:58] you and the recognition
[48:00] the moment that is not there because
[48:02] that becomes some people that is the
[48:04] motive
[48:05] they long for appreciation and intention
[48:08] and these things so when you feed them
[48:09] that give them that gasoline there's
[48:11] some people you tell them great job
[48:12] great job great job just every time
[48:14] you're doing a great job they get wings
[48:17] they're ready to fly
[48:19] because i'm feeling it at the moment you
[48:20] take away the great job great job
[48:23] they can't fly anymore
[48:25] so the motive for doing what they do
[48:28] is not so much that they want to get
[48:30] their job done you know it's because
[48:31] they feed off of something else anybody
[48:34] with me
[48:36] all right
[48:37] so again it's a lot i want just taking a
[48:40] look at
[48:41] why we do what we do
[48:44] what we do and why we do it all right
[48:48] in a message seeking after jesus just
[48:50] two sentences
[48:52] we're looking to get somebody closer to
[48:54] god that's our motive
[48:56] of being here no other motive at all
[48:59] and i drop that in there because this is
[49:01] what we pushed in towards we have a
[49:03] motivational agent
[49:06] and the motive is for us to get closer
[49:08] to god
[49:09] to be more like him to think like him to
[49:13] act like him to live like him
[49:19] let's look at some scriptures we're
[49:21] doing we're doing good with time
[49:23] proverbs 16 2. you could take note of it
[49:26] if you if you could move
[49:28] quickly you could get to it
[49:30] a little equalism to tape as well but
[49:32] but listen to
[49:34] what solomon says here in proverbs 16 2
[49:37] all the ways of a man are clean in his
[49:41] own eyes
[49:45] but the lord with the spirits
[49:49] this one verse is mind blowing
[49:52] all the ways of a man are clean in his
[49:55] own eyes but the lord with the spirits
[49:58] so what we're talking about tonight is
[50:00] waving spirit i'm going to get to the
[50:01] amplified and you're going to see where
[50:02] this is going
[50:04] in the amplified it says all the ways of
[50:06] a man are clean and innocent in his eyes
[50:11] and he may see nothing wrong with his
[50:14] actions but the lord weighs and examines
[50:17] the motives and intent
[50:22] of the heart and knows the
[50:24] truth now i really find this is powerful
[50:27] because
[50:28] you may not realize that you have a
[50:30] hidden motive
[50:34] because in your eyes what you doing
[50:37] seemed like the right thing to do and
[50:40] this is when this is where the rubber
[50:42] meets the road or the real issue is
[50:44] because people sometimes move by their
[50:46] conviction which is wrong
[50:49] and they cannot see that they are wrong
[50:51] they cannot see that this thing this
[50:53] road in this thought this approach this
[50:55] way of thinking because i have
[50:57] grandfather tell you how to do it
[51:00] and you genuinely believe that
[51:02] and the approach you're taking
[51:06] so in your eyes as the scripture said
[51:08] it's clean it making sense
[51:14] but the lord goes beyond
[51:17] the action and examine the motive
[51:20] and the intent
[51:23] why are you spending all that time with
[51:24] him why are you spending time with her
[51:26] why are you giving that money why are
[51:27] you doing that thing why are you
[51:29] why you didn't say that why you did that
[51:31] and we're going to get into some
[51:32] examples right
[51:34] jeremiah 17 9
[51:37] jeremiah 17 and verse 9
[51:40] the heart is deceitful
[51:43] above all things
[51:45] and desperately wicked who can do it
[51:49] the heart
[51:50] is deceitful above all things
[51:54] and desperately wicked
[51:56] who can do it
[51:58] i want to read it in the amplified
[52:01] the heart is deceitful above all things
[52:04] and it is extremely sick
[52:07] this is not the sick of health sick
[52:09] who can understand it fully and know its
[52:12] secret motives
[52:16] this is where i get the second part of
[52:18] my title tonight
[52:19] secret motives
[52:21] what is your motive secret motives
[52:24] because there are motives that you may
[52:25] very well be aware of but there'll be
[52:28] motives that you're not even conscious
[52:29] of
[52:30] anybody with me tonight
[52:32] is this helping anybody
[52:39] no
[52:41] let's push even deeper
[52:43] james four and verse three
[52:49] james four and verse three
[52:52] now let's really come to the heart of
[52:53] your spiritual work noah
[52:56] and listen to what james is saying here
[52:59] ye ask and receive not
[53:03] so you're praying
[53:04] and your prayer not getting answered
[53:06] listen carefully to this one he asked
[53:08] and receive not because you ask a miss
[53:12] that he may consume it upon your lusts
[53:17] now what does this really mean
[53:20] because if you don't pause to really
[53:22] consider this and now check back what
[53:25] god really tested for let's look in the
[53:28] amplified at this same scripture we just
[53:31] read
[53:32] you ask god for something
[53:35] and do not receive it because you ask
[53:38] with a wrong motive
[53:41] out of selfishness
[53:43] or with an unrighteous agenda that's
[53:45] what the armistice is referring to
[53:49] anybody with me
[53:50] so you asking god and god looking at the
[53:53] request and the motive
[53:55] he's not taking the request alone when
[53:57] the prayer requests come he asking what
[53:59] is the motive for this request so so you
[54:01] want a new car
[54:03] and the motive is to impress somebody to
[54:06] impress a girl on the walk
[54:10] you want a car but it's really because
[54:12] of jealousy
[54:14] so when the request comes to god you see
[54:16] the request for the car and his jealousy
[54:18] is emotive because your neighbor buy a
[54:20] new car so he getting bought to them at
[54:22] the same time you know you didn't submit
[54:24] the motive you submitted requests but
[54:26] the motive came when you request
[54:28] any anybody say i didn't see the picture
[54:30] you want a promotion on a job and the
[54:33] request comes and he said promotion come
[54:36] and we have a scripture
[54:41] you send it to the lord and the lord
[54:42] said where is he motive
[54:44] anybody with me tonight
[54:46] and when he motivates up
[54:48] because the request might come before
[54:50] the motive when we so i want us to see
[54:53] it like that so you request reach up
[54:55] brother so-and-so looking for a
[54:57] promotion on the job
[55:00] and and and and the motive when he
[55:03] motivates up and he look at him what if
[55:05] he say but this motive this motive here
[55:08] is he want this money to do something
[55:11] and if he do this he he he did
[55:13] you want a job in some quite quite too
[55:16] and the motive is is that the other day
[55:17] you want to spend more time away from
[55:18] your family
[55:21] denied
[55:23] anybody seen it
[55:27] i remember about over the years ago
[55:29] saying people pray lord give me if
[55:31] i get a car i'll serve him more i'll
[55:35] beat any moment again
[55:37] by the beach
[55:41] sometimes god denying your loan
[55:43] application denying stuff because if he
[55:46] don't know the motive he said if you get
[55:48] instinct
[55:50] you won't find you in him
[55:53] the deacons can't find you
[55:56] i want this to sink in
[55:58] so every request coming to god out
[56:01] saying before i even act on angels check
[56:03] the motive
[56:06] so i want the reader to give me
[56:07] amplified
[56:08] you asked and again i want us to nail
[56:11] down
[56:12] body quality overt motive and the covert
[56:16] the known motive and the unknown
[56:18] because there are things in us that we
[56:20] sometimes don't realize are there and we
[56:23] have been through this
[56:24] jonah didn't realize part of what was in
[56:28] him that these situations around him
[56:30] elevated
[56:32] so god is able to go and understand
[56:36] what's in you
[56:37] and
[56:38] his desire his motive to protect you his
[56:41] motive to keep you his motive to bring
[56:44] you to perfection his motive to adopt
[56:47] you
[56:47] he is also making certain decisions and
[56:51] actions and blessings and closing doors
[56:54] and opening doors and closing windows
[56:57] because he has a motive
[57:02] he said i know the plans i have for you
[57:04] i know the thoughts i have for you
[57:06] thoughts of peace taught a blessing to
[57:08] give the unexpected end he has made that
[57:10] very clear but if you are a danger to
[57:13] yourself
[57:15] because of either a motive or desire you
[57:17] have to be a somebody so whatever it is
[57:20] or a motive you don't even know you have
[57:26] god he has this element
[57:28] thank god he can know the taught and the
[57:29] intent of our heart anybody
[57:31] so again i want to nail this down
[57:34] no
[57:35] god not saying no acts of big things
[57:42] whatever i'm talking you say ask god for
[57:44] big things that's a direct quote
[57:47] but the issue is not just asking for big
[57:49] things you know there has to be the
[57:50] right motive behind it
[57:53] because if god see him giving you a
[57:55] million dollars will get into trouble
[57:57] you will never get it to know nothing
[57:59] you could ever do because god don't want
[58:00] you to get injured into trouble now if
[58:02] you can act more mature and then your
[58:04] motive would be different now god could
[58:06] trust you because if you get a million
[58:09] dollars and you you you couldn't party
[58:11] behind your house
[58:12] and it starts off innocent you know but
[58:14] in your heart deep down you even know
[58:15] you had a party spirit
[58:18] you you always had a little desire to to
[58:21] be a place where you will come and lie
[58:22] there's nothing wrong with with linemen
[58:24] and fellowship and anything you know but
[58:25] a little piece of you deep down inside
[58:26] you never knew you knew it was there
[58:28] that if this thing happened every single
[58:29] week
[58:30] afterward you feel like you you you are
[58:32] the king what's in that spirit is what
[58:34] are going against
[58:38] i don't know if this helping anybody
[58:45] james 4 3 we still there you ask god for
[58:48] something and do not have selfishness
[58:52] so again
[58:56] here is james talking about selfishness
[58:58] so you're asking
[58:59] but what is for your own
[59:01] you're selfish you're not looking for
[59:02] god's will you're not looking to bless
[59:04] somebody it's me is i is myself
[59:09] or with unrighteous agenda
[59:13] so james is actually equating
[59:15] unrighteous agenda with selfishness
[59:20] mind-blowing
[59:22] so that when you get what you want you
[59:24] may spend it on your hedonistic desires
[59:28] that's the same james 4 in the amplified
[59:34] let's go on a little bit
[59:36] i just have a few more examples
[59:39] i want to go to acts 5.
[59:42] i want to look at this a little bit and
[59:44] then we have one more scripture we're
[59:46] going to go back to samuel we're going
[59:48] to bring some closure here on this one
[59:49] this one is
[59:51] we we know it but our water's still
[59:53] going so acts 5 1.
[59:55] and how many know we're going back to
[59:57] another ephesians we're going for
[59:58] another book of acts anybody anybody in
[1:00:01] the house
[1:00:02] wonderful wonderful so when the book of
[1:00:05] acts come back acts five you can't get
[1:00:07] any booker acts without acts 5.
[1:00:10] so if we're going back to the book of
[1:00:11] acts then we won the whole book right we
[1:00:14] want we want to be able to measure up to
[1:00:16] these standards all right so act five
[1:00:19] verse one
[1:00:21] let me just get it in the amplified as
[1:00:26] well but a certain man named ananias
[1:00:34] with sapphira his wife sold a
[1:00:40] possession now
[1:00:43] to put things in context
[1:00:46] and it is brought out a bit but students
[1:00:48] of history biblical history would
[1:00:50] understand that in the book of acts the
[1:00:52] bible speaks of they had all things in
[1:00:54] common
[1:00:58] which meant at that time there was no
[1:01:00] big me little you
[1:01:03] the church operated as a family a bond
[1:01:07] the believers would bring what they had
[1:01:10] and the diaconated deacons would ensure
[1:01:13] that everybody had what they needed and
[1:01:15] these these kind of things so
[1:01:17] this certain man named ananias with
[1:01:18] sapphira his wife sold a possession it
[1:01:21] was a piece of property all right so i'm
[1:01:23] going to parallel this with the
[1:01:24] amplified
[1:01:26] solar piece of property
[1:01:28] and verse 2 and kept back part of the
[1:01:31] price
[1:01:32] his wife also being privy to it and
[1:01:36] brought a certain part and laid it at
[1:01:38] the apostles feet
[1:01:40] now
[1:01:42] the first point i wanted us to
[1:01:43] appreciate here is
[1:01:45] there was no obligation to do this
[1:01:48] this was not a mandatory thing
[1:01:51] this was a choice
[1:01:52] that ananias and sapphira
[1:01:54] came to the bedroom and say since
[1:01:57] i am going to sell a piece of property
[1:01:59] and i'm going to bring it for the
[1:02:01] benefit of the saints and the church and
[1:02:02] that kind of stuff all right so you
[1:02:04] understand the context so it was not
[1:02:06] that it was an instruction ananias was
[1:02:08] given he was to operate from his heart
[1:02:10] so we're going to read one other
[1:02:11] question we're not going to descript it
[1:02:12] with that as well
[1:02:15] verse 3
[1:02:16] but peter said ananias and this is what
[1:02:19] i was referring to
[1:02:21] why had satan filled thine heart
[1:02:24] to lie to the holy ghost
[1:02:26] so in other words
[1:02:29] basically ananias allowed
[1:02:33] because the only way the devil will come
[1:02:35] into your heart
[1:02:38] is if you allow it let me
[1:02:40] let me kneel this down
[1:02:42] the devil has no authority
[1:02:44] this is not the devil came into his mind
[1:02:51] all right in the amplified wires it
[1:02:53] unfilled your heart to lie to the holy
[1:02:55] spirit right so peter said in time why
[1:02:58] had satan filled that heart to lie to
[1:02:59] the holy ghost and to keep back part of
[1:03:02] the price of the land
[1:03:05] verse 4
[1:03:06] while it remained was it not thine own
[1:03:09] in other words as long as you would
[1:03:11] remain unsold
[1:03:14] did it not remain your own to do as you
[1:03:16] please so in other words you had a
[1:03:18] choice
[1:03:19] you didn't have to sell it
[1:03:21] you could have kept it you had a choice
[1:03:23] of what you're doing so so then it
[1:03:25] brings up a big question
[1:03:28] if
[1:03:29] ananias could have kept the property and
[1:03:32] not sell it
[1:03:33] why
[1:03:34] would he offer to do it
[1:03:38] because no any action any word is driven
[1:03:41] by a motive
[1:03:45] anybody with me in other words
[1:03:48] ananias was doing something
[1:03:52] and the real issue here we're reading is
[1:03:54] one of motiva
[1:03:56] because he had a choice he wasn't forced
[1:03:58] to do it he made a choice to do it
[1:04:01] now i cannot tell you what it was maybe
[1:04:03] he wanted to come across well i'm the
[1:04:06] biggest donator
[1:04:07] maybe he wanted to come across
[1:04:10] i don't know
[1:04:11] it doesn't tell us the motive but there
[1:04:13] had to be a motive
[1:04:15] all right let's go
[1:04:18] why has thou conceived this thing in
[1:04:20] thine heart remember motivism body heart
[1:04:23] thou has not lied onto men but unto god
[1:04:27] and ananias hearing these words fell
[1:04:29] down and gave up the ghost
[1:04:33] died on the spot in the amplified and
[1:04:35] here are these words
[1:04:37] and an eyes fell along suddenly and died
[1:04:41] and great fear came on all them that
[1:04:43] heard these things
[1:04:46] and the young men
[1:04:48] in the congregation
[1:04:50] arose wound them up and carried them out
[1:04:53] and buried him
[1:04:56] and it was about a space of three hours
[1:04:58] after
[1:05:00] when his wife
[1:05:01] not knowing what was done came in
[1:05:05] and peter
[1:05:06] answered unto her
[1:05:10] tell me whether he saw the land for so
[1:05:12] much
[1:05:14] and she said yeah
[1:05:16] for so much
[1:05:19] and peter's then peter said unto her how
[1:05:21] is it that he have agreed together to
[1:05:24] tempt the spirit of the lord what was
[1:05:26] the motive
[1:05:28] it still perplexes me for the clarence
[1:05:30] still to this day
[1:05:32] because you had a choice you didn't have
[1:05:34] to sell it even if you sold it you could
[1:05:38] have come clean and say listen this to
[1:05:40] what i want to do you had a choice
[1:05:43] so what why would somebody do this and
[1:05:45] also agree to lie about it
[1:05:48] what would the motive be
[1:05:50] and that's to show you
[1:05:52] peter caller doesn't know he said why
[1:05:54] alexa didn't come into your heart to do
[1:05:56] this thing in other words
[1:05:57] what driving your behavior this what i
[1:06:00] can call almost irrational behavior
[1:06:02] because if you have the power to sell
[1:06:04] your land or not sell it and he choose
[1:06:06] to do it and they say you got to do
[1:06:07] something and then you you hold back on
[1:06:09] your promise because you promised it to
[1:06:11] god and peter's saying here lying to
[1:06:13] manny are you lying to god
[1:06:20] how is it that he have agreed together
[1:06:22] to the term the spirit of the lord
[1:06:24] behold the feet of them which have
[1:06:26] buried thy husband that itself is a
[1:06:28] statement there in other words them
[1:06:29] brothers no come back inside you say
[1:06:30] look look they walk in there the jazz
[1:06:34] burial bunny see that dirt on the on the
[1:06:36] foot look look at the feet
[1:06:40] they are the door and shall carry the
[1:06:42] out
[1:06:45] then fell straight down straight away at
[1:06:48] his feet and yielded up the ghost and
[1:06:50] the young man came in and found her dead
[1:06:53] and carrying her fault buried her by her
[1:06:55] husband and great fear came upon all the
[1:06:58] church and upon as many as heard these
[1:07:00] things now we still dealing with motive
[1:07:04] your heart what's your desire last
[1:07:06] scripture in the new testament before we
[1:07:08] finish up in the old testament second
[1:07:10] corinthians 9 6.
[1:07:18] second corinthians
[1:07:20] chapter 9
[1:07:22] verse 6
[1:07:23] but this i say he which sow it sparingly
[1:07:26] shall reap also sparingly
[1:07:29] and he
[1:07:30] which sow it bountifully shall reap also
[1:07:33] bountifully
[1:07:36] for
[1:07:37] every man or corning as he had purpose
[1:07:39] it in his heart so let him give
[1:07:43] not grudgingly or of necessity
[1:07:46] for god love it a cheerful giver
[1:07:49] no
[1:07:51] we know this scripture but i want us to
[1:07:52] understand what god is saying here he is
[1:07:54] saying your motive forgiven is
[1:07:59] is critical to how i receive what you're
[1:08:01] given
[1:08:05] and this giving could speak to many
[1:08:07] different things you know so so it is
[1:08:10] not just financial gonna be talking
[1:08:12] about you know you're giving to the lord
[1:08:14] you're giving up your time so even being
[1:08:16] here tonight is giving you know
[1:08:20] but are you here out of necessity
[1:08:24] are you here grudgingly
[1:08:26] or are you here giving up your time
[1:08:28] cheerfully
[1:08:32] anybody you have a processor that way
[1:08:35] or even financially you put in your
[1:08:36] offering and putting your ties you know
[1:08:38] but you're doing it grudgingly because
[1:08:41] or you're doing out of necessity because
[1:08:44] you would say you have to wait but
[1:08:45] there's no chair there's no there's no
[1:08:46] joy cause you don't understand what god
[1:08:48] doing so there's no chair
[1:08:51] i don't want to start tonight you know
[1:08:55] and gossip as your purpose in your heart
[1:08:58] this here
[1:09:00] is also tied to that acts five you know
[1:09:02] because
[1:09:03] purpose in your heart to give
[1:09:06] but not grudgingly
[1:09:08] god i really
[1:09:10] are giving it to no but
[1:09:12] uh
[1:09:13] oh ugliness says to me well the law says
[1:09:17] that's ultimately lord the lord the
[1:09:18] legal you say give your giving you're
[1:09:20] not giving it because you want to give
[1:09:21] way or you understand why to give but
[1:09:23] because it's a necessity you're given
[1:09:25] because you're afraid judgment that's
[1:09:26] the only reason if it wasn't because of
[1:09:28] judgment he wasn't going to give
[1:09:31] that is necessity
[1:09:34] what is the difference between because
[1:09:36] the fact that paul have to address this
[1:09:39] issue meant it was an issue that existed
[1:09:42] he not addressing issues out of i'm
[1:09:44] never feeling i feel that dress up
[1:09:46] tonight yes nobody has addressed
[1:09:48] something no he is confronting
[1:09:50] situations that people were battling
[1:09:53] with to help them
[1:09:55] anybody with me
[1:09:57] all right i
[1:09:59] hope this helping somebody tonight all
[1:10:01] right so let's go back to the old
[1:10:03] testament
[1:10:04] two bible studies ago
[1:10:06] two that the second the last one before
[1:10:08] that that i did we dealt with when
[1:10:11] you're under attack and we dealt with
[1:10:13] david and goliath and we would have
[1:10:15] addressed basically battles that david
[1:10:17] had to overcome
[1:10:19] to even deal with goliath that goliath
[1:10:21] was the end game the big battle but
[1:10:22] before that he had to deal right before
[1:10:25] with saul saying you can't do it you're
[1:10:27] too young you can't make it and just
[1:10:28] before that he had to deal with eliab
[1:10:30] his own brother with the family issues
[1:10:34] the family stresses the family
[1:10:36] questioning if you could why you're here
[1:10:38] that kind of stuff so i want to look at
[1:10:40] firstly
[1:10:42] first samuel 17.
[1:10:44] 28
[1:10:47] just to re-look at this conversation
[1:10:49] with eliab
[1:10:52] and if you recall eliab was the first
[1:10:55] born of jesse
[1:10:58] i believe i would have mentioned if you
[1:11:00] would have looked at his graduation card
[1:11:02] he was most likely to succeed he was
[1:11:04] tall he was handsome
[1:11:06] even when samuel saw it samuel said this
[1:11:08] have to be the king
[1:11:10] if god didn't stop samuel he was going
[1:11:13] to anoint eliab king of israel god had
[1:11:16] to stop samuel and say hold up
[1:11:19] don't look at the outward appearance i
[1:11:21] look at the heart anybody anybody with
[1:11:23] me
[1:11:24] and this is just represent being hard
[1:11:26] because david was a man of the godhead
[1:11:28] samuel the prophet samuel
[1:11:31] unhindered or stopped by god was about
[1:11:35] to anoint elia the next king of israel
[1:11:38] if god didn't interrupt samuel we would
[1:11:40] have never had a king david
[1:11:44] and god's saying my issue with elia is
[1:11:47] the hat and the heart speaks the motive
[1:11:49] because out of your heart is what drives
[1:11:51] your motive anybody with me right so
[1:11:54] first samuel 17 28 and elia his eldest
[1:11:57] brother hood when he speak unto the men
[1:12:00] that's when david they asked him what
[1:12:02] going on who is this philistine thing
[1:12:04] and elijah's anger was kindled against
[1:12:06] david and he said why chemists dull down
[1:12:10] hither
[1:12:12] in other words here is a man with issues
[1:12:15] in his heart
[1:12:17] questioning david's motive
[1:12:20] i want us to see this now so i want to
[1:12:22] understand now there are people around
[1:12:24] us
[1:12:25] because of their own issues will put
[1:12:28] pressure on us and actually make it
[1:12:29] about your motive
[1:12:33] so
[1:12:35] in other words some time ago somebody
[1:12:37] asked a little bit why are you going on
[1:12:38] the fields
[1:12:40] if you don't want to go on the field
[1:12:41] that's your issue you know
[1:12:46] anybody with me
[1:12:49] in other words you
[1:12:52] could i could just keep it
[1:12:54] motive is such a thing and here it is i
[1:12:56] want to see elias you want me with the
[1:12:58] issues and oh god listen we're not
[1:13:01] wondering if elijah had issues in them
[1:13:03] we're not suggesting god said because of
[1:13:05] his issues hika you're not qualified
[1:13:10] you have issues to deal with and here is
[1:13:12] the man with issues to walk into human
[1:13:15] after god's own heart and the man with
[1:13:17] issues questioning the motive of the man
[1:13:20] after god owners
[1:13:22] anybody with me
[1:13:24] why came as down here hither question a
[1:13:26] motive
[1:13:27] and with whom has thou left those few
[1:13:29] sheep in the wilderness
[1:13:31] and listen
[1:13:32] not only is it a question he's now
[1:13:34] stated stating
[1:13:36] the issues in
[1:13:39] david's lives he said i know thy pride
[1:13:43] i know as pride is your motive
[1:13:46] and the naughtiness of thine heart i
[1:13:48] know what's driving you i know what
[1:13:50] makes you tick
[1:13:51] and know why you're doing what you're
[1:13:53] doing
[1:13:54] for though i come down that don't make
[1:13:57] the cd battle that is
[1:14:02] anybody's anybody's anybody seeing this
[1:14:04] here
[1:14:05] and david's response is what have i done
[1:14:08] or what have i now done is there not a
[1:14:10] cause in other words the cause is motive
[1:14:13] or anybody help me tonight
[1:14:14] the cause is my motive because i came
[1:14:17] here my father sent me david didn't
[1:14:19] choose to be there you know i wanted to
[1:14:21] appreciate how backstage elia was david
[1:14:24] didn't ask about and applied to go there
[1:14:26] he father sent him
[1:14:28] but the questions he was asking was
[1:14:30] because of goliath anybody with me no
[1:14:34] last
[1:14:34] body of scripture
[1:14:36] next chapter
[1:14:37] last time we did david we would have
[1:14:39] ended in first samuel 17. now let's go
[1:14:41] to both samuel 18 and this is where we
[1:14:43] will end tonight
[1:14:45] first time you are 18
[1:14:49] verse one
[1:14:51] are you being blessed tonight anybody
[1:14:54] anybody enjoyed this anybody being
[1:14:56] blessed anybody i know i can't see all
[1:14:58] the faces i trust everybody is awake and
[1:15:00] and on fire and getting inspiration and
[1:15:03] and and we're looking at themselves and
[1:15:05] you know
[1:15:06] so let's deal with this situation in
[1:15:08] full samuel 18. and it came to pass now
[1:15:11] we will recall for samuel 17 ended with
[1:15:14] saul asking who is this boy david whose
[1:15:17] son is he
[1:15:19] all right and david say well i am son of
[1:15:21] jesse and nothing right good so first
[1:15:23] time 18 verse 1 and it came to pass
[1:15:26] when he had made an end of speaking unto
[1:15:29] saul
[1:15:30] that the soul of jonathan was knit with
[1:15:33] the soul of david and jonathan loved him
[1:15:37] as his own soul
[1:15:39] all right we're building and saul took
[1:15:42] him that day and would let him go no
[1:15:45] more home to his father's house so saul
[1:15:47] is so blown away by this young boy named
[1:15:49] david that he said listen you're not
[1:15:52] going home back again you're staying
[1:15:53] here with me boy because i really like
[1:15:55] your style i like you you think there's
[1:15:56] something about you
[1:15:58] so and i mean that that is itself is our
[1:16:00] honor when the king say listen stay here
[1:16:02] in the king's palace something you know
[1:16:03] so so it's a great honor david clearly
[1:16:06] had something going for him
[1:16:07] to cut the attention of saul but let's
[1:16:09] build verse 3. then jonathan and david
[1:16:12] made a covenant because he loved him as
[1:16:14] his own soul
[1:16:15] and jonathan stripped himself up the
[1:16:17] robe that was upon him and gave it to
[1:16:19] david and his garment even to his sword
[1:16:22] and to his bow and to his girdle and
[1:16:24] david went out with us whoever saul sent
[1:16:27] him and listen i love this and behaved
[1:16:29] himself wisely
[1:16:32] we will see this repeated multiple times
[1:16:34] in this chapter behaved himself wisely
[1:16:37] that itself is mind-blowing to me
[1:16:39] because this is a young david at this
[1:16:41] point in david's life he is actually too
[1:16:44] young to be in the army
[1:16:48] so this is not the issue of age
[1:16:52] it's an issue of spiritual wisdom
[1:16:53] because this is an anointed david he's
[1:16:55] already anointed
[1:16:57] but the fact that it is mentioned that
[1:17:00] he behave himself wisely it's the
[1:17:02] highlight not only that he did but it
[1:17:04] also gives us the contrast that that he
[1:17:06] did he also was not behaving ridiculous
[1:17:09] anybody with me can people say the same
[1:17:11] of us that we behave wisely
[1:17:14] because behaving wisely means we deal
[1:17:16] with situations a certain kind of way
[1:17:18] right
[1:17:20] and as a young man listen to it saul set
[1:17:22] him over the men of war so saul is so
[1:17:26] blown away with this young man who
[1:17:28] behaves wisely he sets him
[1:17:30] over the men of war big season men men
[1:17:33] of war in this context are the seasoned
[1:17:36] soldiers
[1:17:40] and he was accepted in the sight of all
[1:17:42] the people and also in the sight of
[1:17:44] saul's servants let's go we're not going
[1:17:47] to meet too much longer ride with me and
[1:17:50] it came to pass as they came
[1:17:52] when david was returned from the
[1:17:54] slaughter of the philistines that the
[1:17:55] woman came out of all cities of israel
[1:18:00] singing and dancing to meet king saul
[1:18:03] with tabret with joy and with
[1:18:05] instruments of music
[1:18:10] but over when he preaches they said they
[1:18:11] sang the wrong special
[1:18:13] when they came back from the battle
[1:18:15] brother thompson the special that the
[1:18:17] sisters started to sing in the
[1:18:19] convention
[1:18:20] is very seven and the woman answered one
[1:18:22] another as they played and said saul had
[1:18:26] slain his thousands and david his ten
[1:18:28] thousands
[1:18:30] and there's rejoicing there's jubilee
[1:18:32] and saul in verse eight is furious
[1:18:37] saul is losing it
[1:18:39] the bible says and sort where saul was
[1:18:41] very wrought which is very angry and the
[1:18:43] saying displeased him
[1:18:45] and he said they have ascribed on the
[1:18:48] david ten thousands
[1:18:51] and to me they have ascribed by
[1:18:53] thousands
[1:18:55] what can he have more body kingdom
[1:18:59] in other words
[1:19:02] saul was so caught up in that song that
[1:19:06] he said david don't have every single
[1:19:08] thing he could ever have in other words
[1:19:10] saul attributed that praise as valuable
[1:19:14] as to everything in the world except the
[1:19:16] crown on his head he said the only thing
[1:19:18] david missing is this room
[1:19:21] this is a little boy in the palace who
[1:19:23] have a few men under him and that song
[1:19:26] affected king saul so much he said the
[1:19:29] only thing this man missing is this
[1:19:31] krong
[1:19:32] anybody with me
[1:19:34] i love i love verse nine and you have to
[1:19:37] get a joy when you read a new scripture
[1:19:38] there
[1:19:39] and so i that david from that day i
[1:19:43] thought
[1:19:47] i didn't even
[1:19:48] possess
[1:19:50] in other words every
[1:19:52] after that soldiers i endeavor it's just
[1:19:55] affecting them yes i ain't given but
[1:19:58] listen this wasn't david's doing
[1:20:00] this wasn't david choose to be this way
[1:20:02] anybody with me this wasn't this was
[1:20:05] just he was living what god put in him
[1:20:08] out
[1:20:09] so don't be bothering people eyeing you
[1:20:12] when you live in what god put you here
[1:20:13] to do there's not anybody with me
[1:20:17] you just living you doing you
[1:20:19] based on what god plan is for you and
[1:20:22] people eyeing you it's not it's not your
[1:20:24] fault don't feel bad about that anybody
[1:20:26] with me
[1:20:28] verse 10
[1:20:28] [Music]
[1:20:30] and it came to pass on the morrow
[1:20:33] that the very next day that this thing
[1:20:35] take place did they have to require sin
[1:20:37] and require the right they got fired and
[1:20:39] ending the very next day
[1:20:42] that the evil spirit from god came upon
[1:20:44] saul and he prophesied in the midst of
[1:20:46] the house and david played with his hand
[1:20:49] as at other times and there was a
[1:20:51] javelin in seoul's hand
[1:20:54] and saw casty javelin
[1:20:56] so an assassination attempt for instead
[1:20:58] i would smile david even to the wall
[1:21:01] with it so he was eyeing him eyeing him
[1:21:04] eyeing him eyeing him until he couldn't
[1:21:05] i am no more decided to take this
[1:21:08] i need to kill this boy
[1:21:11] and david avoided out of his presence
[1:21:14] twice
[1:21:16] verse 12 let's go and saul was afraid of
[1:21:19] david you see the tone of scripture
[1:21:21] changes
[1:21:23] now fear is upon soul
[1:21:26] david hasn't made a move
[1:21:28] there has been no attempted coup
[1:21:30] there has been no cry for david to
[1:21:32] assume leadership
[1:21:35] saul is afraid of david because the lord
[1:21:38] was with him
[1:21:40] so all those soul is backslidden he sees
[1:21:43] the presence of god
[1:21:48] anybody with me
[1:21:50] you know what the comfort it is i have
[1:21:51] the presence of the lord
[1:21:53] oh my
[1:21:55] hallelujah
[1:21:57] to know that the lord is with you
[1:22:01] you stumble here your your
[1:22:03] your shake up here but the lord is with
[1:22:05] you
[1:22:06] you can't help yourself the lord is with
[1:22:08] you because he promised to never leave
[1:22:09] you never forsake you anybody with me
[1:22:14] so listen now to soil dealing with this
[1:22:16] situation and i want to see all this
[1:22:18] unfolds let's ride with me we're going
[1:22:20] to be a few more
[1:22:22] therefore saul remove him from him in
[1:22:24] other words he want to create distance
[1:22:28] between him and david and made him
[1:22:30] captain over a thousand and he went out
[1:22:33] and came in before
[1:22:35] the people
[1:22:37] listen to verse 14 again and david
[1:22:39] behaved himself
[1:22:41] wisely in all his ways you see the
[1:22:43] repeating of it
[1:22:46] and the lord was with him
[1:22:51] verse 15 wherefore when saul saw listen
[1:22:54] listen listen to what bothered skin soul
[1:22:57] when saul saw that he behaved himself
[1:23:00] very wisely he was afraid of him so this
[1:23:02] is his second fear the first fear was
[1:23:05] based on the lord being with him
[1:23:07] the other fear was he behaved himself
[1:23:09] wisely that itself created fear for soul
[1:23:12] do you know that when you conduct
[1:23:14] yourself the right way the devil gets
[1:23:16] afraid
[1:23:17] you understand when you're supposed to
[1:23:19] blow your top lose your cool act all
[1:23:22] crazy and you act wisely you never say
[1:23:25] now boy this one different oh you don't
[1:23:27] hear me tonight
[1:23:30] anybody with me
[1:23:33] when you act wisely that is a problem
[1:23:36] for the devil
[1:23:38] look at
[1:23:39] i don't think you catch listen up the
[1:23:41] fact that david behaved himself wisely
[1:23:45] created fear do you know when you act
[1:23:47] wise on your job it creates fear
[1:23:54] we're 16 but all israel and judah love
[1:23:58] david because he went out and came in
[1:24:00] before them listen why
[1:24:04] in the amplified but all israel and
[1:24:05] judah love david because he publicly
[1:24:07] associated with them
[1:24:11] you see that king saul never lived in
[1:24:13] the palace
[1:24:18] i could go places but i would reverse
[1:24:19] the car
[1:24:21] verse 17
[1:24:24] and saul said to david
[1:24:28] behold my elder daughter mira
[1:24:31] who will i give thee to wife only be the
[1:24:34] valiant for me and fight the lord's
[1:24:37] battles now we get him closer to where i
[1:24:40] want to go to now
[1:24:43] so listen to how saul positions it
[1:24:46] i will give you my elder daughter
[1:24:49] who will i give thee to wife listen but
[1:24:52] it is conditional
[1:24:54] you need to be valiant for me
[1:24:56] and he actually bring god in it he said
[1:24:59] and fight the lord's battle in other
[1:25:02] words he threw in terminology in there
[1:25:05] that david could identify because if
[1:25:07] you're on the lord's side you'll want to
[1:25:08] fight the lord's battle all right but
[1:25:11] but this is being said but there's a
[1:25:13] motive
[1:25:15] behind it right let's go first
[1:25:24] by the road back to right
[1:25:26] for saul said not left not my hand be
[1:25:28] upon him but let the hand of the
[1:25:30] philippines be upon him so in other
[1:25:31] words
[1:25:32] saul is seen
[1:25:34] in his heart
[1:25:36] it is in his heart
[1:25:38] for saul thought in the amplified
[1:25:41] my hand shall not be against it but let
[1:25:42] me handle the philosophy against him so
[1:25:44] saul is thinking if i send david out
[1:25:48] promise him my daughter
[1:25:50] tell him it's for the lord
[1:25:53] i don't have to kill him myself but he
[1:25:54] philistine will kill him
[1:25:56] that is what saul is thinking you know
[1:25:58] so the motive and i want us to catch us
[1:26:00] here saul put in the lord in the air and
[1:26:03] the motive is the devil
[1:26:05] the motive is to kill david but he using
[1:26:07] words and terminologies to persuade
[1:26:10] david to do certain things but he
[1:26:12] motivated it so it's for the lord
[1:26:15] anybody seeing this
[1:26:18] how many but truly lord to get people to
[1:26:20] manipulate people
[1:26:24] because that's what really he using the
[1:26:26] lord he's in his office he's in his
[1:26:28] position to manipulate people
[1:26:32] you know
[1:26:33] the lord wants you to watch my car
[1:26:40] i've seen it happen
[1:26:41] but i've seen abusive ministries
[1:26:46] meri versica
[1:26:50] verse 18. let's go and david said unto
[1:26:53] saul
[1:26:55] who am i so david himself you know
[1:26:57] trying to figure out what's going on
[1:26:59] because you know he conducts himself
[1:27:00] wisely
[1:27:01] can we think we almost died
[1:27:06] nobody falling asleep right
[1:27:08] so and davidson said who am i
[1:27:11] and what is my life or my father's
[1:27:13] family in israel that that i should be
[1:27:16] son and to the king
[1:27:19] is it this office is too high for me all
[1:27:21] right
[1:27:22] verse 19.
[1:27:24] but it came to pass at a time when marab
[1:27:26] no this is the height of manipulation
[1:27:28] reference
[1:27:30] saul offered his daughter what kind of
[1:27:33] man are you when he will offer your
[1:27:35] daughter in a whole plan to assassinate
[1:27:37] not only that you layer on top of your
[1:27:39] daughter the lord name and says the lord
[1:27:42] battleground fight and your goal is that
[1:27:44] this man and die in battle
[1:27:47] because of the special that was sung two
[1:27:49] certainly
[1:27:53] but it came to pass at the time when
[1:27:55] marab saul's daughter should have been
[1:27:58] given to david
[1:27:59] that she was given unto adriel the
[1:28:01] mahala side to wife
[1:28:03] right
[1:28:04] so
[1:28:07] so that didn't work out
[1:28:11] so to show
[1:28:13] you how serious saul is in his heart
[1:28:16] meaning the motive is there so he told
[1:28:18] the first daughter
[1:28:20] air worker because she ended up getting
[1:28:22] married
[1:28:24] listen to verse 20. and misel
[1:28:27] source daughter
[1:28:28] love david
[1:28:30] and they told soul and the thing please
[1:28:33] him
[1:28:35] and so i said i will give him her
[1:28:38] that she may be listen a snare to him
[1:28:42] so again motiva
[1:28:44] he had given him her to be a good wife
[1:28:47] to be a help mate to be a support to be
[1:28:51] an encouragement to be a shoulder to cry
[1:28:53] on to be somebody you go to when you're
[1:28:55] feeling down no no no no
[1:28:58] wrong message he is giving her to david
[1:29:01] to be a snare to him
[1:29:03] anybody with me
[1:29:07] listen to the amplified
[1:29:08] sword said i will give her to him so
[1:29:11] that she may become a snare bad
[1:29:14] influence source of trouble to him oh
[1:29:16] lord help us help us jesus
[1:29:23] and that the hand of the philistines may
[1:29:25] be against him in other words so also it
[1:29:28] as a way to weaken david so that he's
[1:29:30] not vulnerable
[1:29:33] go on now wherefore saul said to david
[1:29:36] thou shall this day be my son-in-law in
[1:29:39] the one of twin
[1:29:42] let's go almost done verse 22
[1:29:44] listen to the lengths that saul is going
[1:29:47] to and this is about motive and it's
[1:29:49] also this is
[1:29:51] this is really a deep teaching because
[1:29:53] this is a king somebody in power
[1:29:55] somebody in authority somebody who was
[1:29:58] once anointed because samuel did anoint
[1:30:00] him anybody with me
[1:30:03] and saw commanded himself and saying
[1:30:05] commune with david secretly
[1:30:07] in other words take david into your
[1:30:09] confidence do it don't let him be
[1:30:10] overwhelming
[1:30:12] and say behold the king had the light in
[1:30:14] thee and all his servants loved thee now
[1:30:17] therefore be the king's son-in-law early
[1:30:19] on tonight i say people could say nice
[1:30:21] things to you that you're in your feed
[1:30:23] off of it
[1:30:25] but look saul is telling them in secret
[1:30:27] don't make it a public show invite david
[1:30:29] out carry him pizza hut carry him
[1:30:31] somewhere cut him nice place commune
[1:30:33] with him talk with him fellowship with
[1:30:35] them tell him the king like you you can
[1:30:37] please richard they couldn't want to
[1:30:38] promote it he can't impress with you
[1:30:42] you see how motive could now turn into
[1:30:44] situations that if you are not guided to
[1:30:47] what you're dealing with you're in
[1:30:48] trouble
[1:30:50] verse 23 and saul's servants speak these
[1:30:53] words in the ears of david
[1:30:55] and david said submit it to you a light
[1:30:58] thing to be a king's son-in-law
[1:31:00] seeing that i'm a poor man
[1:31:02] and lightly esteemed
[1:31:04] so one thing i want to highlight here is
[1:31:06] that
[1:31:08] clearly
[1:31:09] the song that his sister sang never got
[1:31:11] to be
[1:31:13] he never changed the perception of
[1:31:15] himself he never saying well i deserve
[1:31:17] this i'm entitled to this all you know
[1:31:20] who i am i'm the one who killed goliath
[1:31:22] i threw out all of the conversation with
[1:31:24] david we see david asking are you sure
[1:31:27] i'm not sure i qualified you know my
[1:31:29] family a small family i'm a poor man i'm
[1:31:31] likely esteemed he never even pay
[1:31:34] attention to how the people treated him
[1:31:38] no wonder god called him a man after his
[1:31:40] own hand
[1:31:41] there's a few voices left verse 24
[1:31:46] and the servants of saul told him seeing
[1:31:48] on this manner spake david so in other
[1:31:50] words they went back to seoul and
[1:31:52] telling saul this is how david talking
[1:31:55] all right so it's almost like david had
[1:31:57] taken he beat in that kind of way then
[1:31:59] right
[1:32:01] verse 25 so so now in response to david
[1:32:04] not falling because he didn't accept the
[1:32:07] offers
[1:32:08] he didn't accept the first offer he
[1:32:10] didn't accept his second offer every
[1:32:11] time they bring me offer he played down
[1:32:13] he said listen i'm not worthy i'm not
[1:32:16] qualified i'm a nobody this thing's too
[1:32:18] good i don't know what's going on
[1:32:20] verse 25 and saul said thus shall he say
[1:32:23] to david
[1:32:24] the king desired not any dory if you
[1:32:27] know anything about that culture a dory
[1:32:30] is a mandatory thing the king said to
[1:32:32] bend in law
[1:32:35] the law started to get twisted
[1:32:37] for his agenda he said the kings are not
[1:32:40] any dory in other words don't bring no
[1:32:43] money
[1:32:44] don't bring because in that culture you
[1:32:45] had to bring sheep goat cattle thing to
[1:32:48] show how much you really validity
[1:32:50] daughter it was supposed to be a tree to
[1:32:52] show listen this is what you're doing to
[1:32:53] me i've given you all this and let's say
[1:32:55] but a hundred four skins of the
[1:32:57] philistines in other words and when they
[1:32:59] go and kill a hundred philistines and
[1:33:01] bring the four skins
[1:33:03] to be revenge of the king's enemies but
[1:33:05] soul again look at the motives
[1:33:08] now friends this is not david against a
[1:33:11] philistine
[1:33:13] this is david against
[1:33:18] not our brother you know this is
[1:33:21] the king of the brothers this is to show
[1:33:23] you this is spiritual wickedness in high
[1:33:25] places disappear
[1:33:27] this this is serious you know
[1:33:30] this is in the church this is in your
[1:33:32] house it's in the family
[1:33:34] but david thought to make david fall by
[1:33:37] the hand of the philistines
[1:33:40] now dear soul is thinking everything
[1:33:42] you're doing it's not being seen
[1:33:44] i got it
[1:33:47] saul is doing all of this thing with an
[1:33:49] evil motive against you talking about
[1:33:52] king david we're addressing you know all
[1:33:54] right let's go
[1:33:55] and when his servants told david these
[1:33:57] words it pleased david well to be the
[1:34:00] king's son-in-law and the days were not
[1:34:02] expired
[1:34:04] so when david here know that there's no
[1:34:08] dory the king one just fell assigned
[1:34:11] dead david cannot he kind of could roll
[1:34:13] with that because he only felt his ankle
[1:34:15] in business
[1:34:16] he he he kills it so where for verse 27
[1:34:20] david arose and went he and his men and
[1:34:23] slew of the philistines two hundred men
[1:34:26] he he killed double the requirement well
[1:34:28] let's see it this thing what's now when
[1:34:30] you're readers things so and again this
[1:34:32] thing's here isn't them the king acts
[1:34:34] are a hundred now bear in mind
[1:34:36] i wanted a picture of this movie the
[1:34:39] king's expectation is a hundred
[1:34:41] philistines should be able to wipe out
[1:34:43] david
[1:34:44] he and his mind thinking if i say is a
[1:34:46] hundred men at least by the time he
[1:34:48] killed 95 the last five go wipe him out
[1:34:51] he can't make the hundred because the
[1:34:53] king wouldn't give up figure that is
[1:34:54] attainable if he's trying to get him
[1:34:56] killed if you want it easy say kill ten
[1:34:58] men he said kill a hundred men in his
[1:35:02] mind he thinks that's impossible david
[1:35:04] could never kill a hundred men by then
[1:35:06] he should be dead for sure here it is
[1:35:09] david said no problem challenge accepted
[1:35:12] david slew 200 men double the
[1:35:14] requirements
[1:35:17] and david brought their foreskins and
[1:35:20] they gave them in full teal to the king
[1:35:23] that he might be son-in-law
[1:35:26] hallelujah
[1:35:29] and saul gave him mitchell his daughter
[1:35:31] to wife
[1:35:32] and soul soul
[1:35:34] and new i like that
[1:35:37] let that be your testimony let it be my
[1:35:40] testimony and saul saw and knew that the
[1:35:43] lord was with david
[1:35:47] and that mitchell saw's daughter loved
[1:35:49] him and saul looking again this is now
[1:35:52] all the way volume all the way up was
[1:35:55] yet the more afraid of david we this is
[1:35:57] the third time or more we see him
[1:36:00] saw his fear for david keep rising it
[1:36:02] arrived when he said god is with him and
[1:36:04] rise when he saw you
[1:36:06] was behave wisely it rise even more now
[1:36:09] and saul was yet the more afraid of
[1:36:11] david and saul became david's enemy
[1:36:14] continually
[1:36:17] last verse to close out tonight then the
[1:36:20] princes of the philistines went fought
[1:36:23] and it came to pass after they went
[1:36:24] forth that david behaved himself more
[1:36:27] wisely
[1:36:30] and all the servants of soul
[1:36:32] so that his name was much set by and in
[1:36:35] the amplified so his name was highly
[1:36:38] esteemed
[1:36:39] friends
[1:36:41] this brings to a close tonight's
[1:36:43] teaching
[1:36:44] and i highlighted this because one would
[1:36:46] expect
[1:36:48] that
[1:36:49] someone anointed by the prophet samuel
[1:36:52] would have always had pure motives one
[1:36:55] would expect that someone anointed by
[1:36:57] the prophet samuel
[1:36:59] would
[1:37:00] only want the best for somebody under
[1:37:03] their care
[1:37:05] but here we see how much attempts
[1:37:08] saul made to destroy david's life
[1:37:12] and as far as so all concerned he wasn't
[1:37:15] showing what he was doing it was in his
[1:37:17] thinking it was in his heart it was the
[1:37:20] motive that was there but david as we
[1:37:22] know was protected he was anointed he
[1:37:25] would be part of the lineage that jesus
[1:37:28] would come from so there was nothing
[1:37:30] that could come his way but it didn't
[1:37:31] take away from the fact that there were
[1:37:33] motives that are ugly i want us to
[1:37:35] realize tonight in closing that motives
[1:37:38] are real
[1:37:39] and we need to try these spirits we need
[1:37:41] to see what's around us family friends
[1:37:43] relatives word spoken what is the
[1:37:46] objective of it what are people trying
[1:37:48] to achieve
[1:37:50] and we have to discern tonight that
[1:37:52] in all of these things and then coming
[1:37:54] to these bible studies and these
[1:37:56] sessions is for us to become more
[1:37:58] sensitive
[1:37:59] for us to become more mature so when
[1:38:02] people tell you stuff you could unfilter
[1:38:03] it from the word and say well i've seen
[1:38:05] this player before you know
[1:38:06] because your motive is not right i will
[1:38:09] close out with this quote from the
[1:38:10] prophet in jesus christ the same
[1:38:12] yesterday today and forever let your
[1:38:14] objective be right let your motive be
[1:38:17] right for anything outside of the right
[1:38:20] motive and the right objective god can't
[1:38:24] use it
[1:38:25] so i want to encourage us tonight as
[1:38:27] believers
[1:38:28] let this be what we take away tonight
[1:38:31] let your objective be right let your
[1:38:34] motive be right because anything outside
[1:38:37] of the right motive and the right
[1:38:39] objective god can't use it shall we head
[1:38:42] so would have prayed
[1:38:43] our heavenly father tonight we thank you
[1:38:45] for your grace your love your mercy we
[1:38:46] thank you for this teaching on motives
[1:38:50] secret motives motives of the heart what
[1:38:52] is your motive
[1:38:54] lord may you open our understanding so
[1:38:57] your motive for us your desire for us
[1:39:00] in so much that you sent a prophet so
[1:39:02] that we could see and look into the word
[1:39:05] and see our name and see our purpose see
[1:39:07] our inheritance see the promises that by
[1:39:10] these promises lord we could become
[1:39:12] partakers of your divine nature help us
[1:39:15] to discern lord the motives of those
[1:39:17] around us even our own motives what we
[1:39:20] are trying to achieve what drives us
[1:39:22] what inspires us what wakes us up in the
[1:39:24] morning because we want to be in
[1:39:26] alignment with you we want our motive to
[1:39:28] be your will and your will to be our
[1:39:30] motive we want to do what pleases you we
[1:39:33] want to subject ourselves lord to your
[1:39:36] purpose and your will to our lives may
[1:39:38] you bless every brother and sister
[1:39:39] tonight lord may you challenge us as we
[1:39:41] read in philippians and paul to that
[1:39:44] level of excellence to want the best
[1:39:46] because that's what you want for us may
[1:39:47] you bless the service tomorrow night
[1:39:49] lord may you bless the special service
[1:39:51] this coming friday may it be lord all
[1:39:54] such a blessing to your people both
[1:39:55] tomorrow night and friday and this
[1:39:57] coming sunday lord may your holy spirit

[1:40:09] you tonight you've been a wonderful
