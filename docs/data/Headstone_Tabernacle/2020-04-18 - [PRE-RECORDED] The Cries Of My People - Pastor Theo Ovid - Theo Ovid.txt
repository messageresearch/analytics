a transforming power Lord we come here to be truly transformed Lord to be conformed to the image of your word to the image of your son to reflect Christ on the earth nor we thank you for this morning service the token was made real the applying of the blood is made real alarm for house our own tabernacle is that house Lord all bodies is that house we have to have that lamb for that house we have thought that token displayed publicly can't be a secret token come they didn't open his half to be displayed on the outside father make us real Christians genuine believers genuine sons and daughters

to reflect the uncommon Sun granted father bless your word as we read it and speak to our hearts and Jesus and we ask it he Melanie may God bless you if of your Bibles likely turn to Exodus chapter 3 wanna read from verse 1 to eat and we have all the time of Prayer we do something different today for the community service after we serve say if he would sigh with all time a prayer we go straight into communion Exodus chapter 3 read in verse 1 now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father-in-law the priest of Midian and he led the flock to the backside of the desert and came to the mountain of God even to Horeb and the angel of the Lord appeared unto Him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush he looked and behold a Bush bull with fire and the bush was not consumed and Moses said I will know our paternal side and see this great sight why the bush is not burnt when the Lord saw that he turn aside to see God called unto him out of the midst of the bush and said Moses Moses and he said here am I he said draw not hither put off thy shoes from of thy feet for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground moreover he said I am I am the God of thy father the God of Abraham the god of Isaac the God of Jacob and Moses hid his face and he was afraid to look upon God and the Lord said I have surely seen the affliction of my people which I in Egypt and have heard their cry by reason of their taskmasters find no dis Horrors and I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them up out of that man onto a good land a large and land floor and milk and honey unto the place of the killer' nights and the Hittites and amirite son the parasites and the Hittites and the jebusites may God bless the novice world you may be seated oh praise the name of the Lord thank you lord well a small exhortation today maybe 10 minutes 8 minutes there's a few minutes the cries of my people that's the exact Tichenor how a user this evening the cries of my people and the prophet said from a message why now to you people that wanted to renew the joy of the salvation somebody lost joy Tim back what you did did you neglect parameter neglect within your Bible neglected praying at your home asking the blessing at the table it may look like little stuff but all these little Adso that's right oh my that is so be uncommon of Christian no matter where you are bow your head and pray don't be a shame of him pray anywhere if ever they left that joy whatever weeded out not a root of bitterness remember when a man gets saved here we go when a man gets saved there's this button here becomes eternalized in your heart that is God as you are able here we go to push out all the roots of bitterness then God begins to spread in you then you become a son of God a man was made to be God small G and to be a God did you know that he's in the image of God he's a son of God he is like him he was given my domain Genesis 1:26 dominion over the earth that's right he ruled the earth here the animal kingdom all the other king number the kingdom of God above he was God an amateur God because he was image image of God what happened because he disbelieved God's Word it sent him back out of shift for himself no God here we go is trying to get him back and when you have faith and accept him my brother just let that doesn't like begin to grow out and take all the roots of doubts and bitterness yield yourself to the spirit then you become a son of God a daughter of God you begin to grow in the grace of God the Holy Spirit begins the bill is kingdom within you so that's why the Prophet could say make yourself a Christian don't assume you're Christian because it come to church but make yourself a Christian isn't that right so you say brother branham wise is that we do not do the things or then we should do how is it that our gifts and things in a church does not come to its color where we should be how is it our church does lift up into the spot where it should be the people in the testing time drops away like Israel did they think God has left them oh my but remember the rock never left Israel Israel left the rock it forgot about a rock being with them all the time was right there to the end of the road it followed them and that rock is following you not even Gideon knew that God was with him because the people was just beating them out and taking the crops but the Lord came down on television the Lord is with you the Lord is with you then Gideon challenged God if you could be with us where the miracles praise let's have a discussion go glory to God I don't wanna get caught is with me port is with me I want to see the power I want the seed of vindication I want to see the healing power I want to see the liver in power or glory to God and prophets that dealing with a structural man healer scriptural man he said if God is here they talk to the miracles if God is here it cut the how supernatural if God is here they cut to be a manifested reality or give the Lord a shout glory to God yet coming to sit up on your food your coming together God praise and worship Oh hallelujah no glory to God hallelujah hallelujah but remember the rock never left Israel if I left the rock it followed him it wasn't out of speaking distance it wasn't out of here in distance it wasn't out of seeing distance and neither is Christ in the church today some of you have back slid and done thing which is wrong you lost that joy your water is dried up he is still in speaking distance of you he follows you he knows every move you make he was longing to hear you call him on the scene [Applause] he's waitin on you what for he had the cries of my people Libby season do we have done wrong he said this pentecostal moved today God is waiting for you to call him under scene he is waiting for you to get fed up with yourself fed up at your effort set up at yourself determination and your effort in your mind and you're putting on line to do this and that set up and when you get set up for that you can say god I can't do it by myself I will fail again I fail before I will fail again come to cry out unto you O glory to God hallelujah glory to God you let me see that bridge go yellow see you said like a failure but successor like a failure like a little bum you need God Moses and a feeling God wanted him to fail because a proof to Moses it's not my mate it's not my power but it's by my spirit and going out to please back to you is that by your money is that by your pocket is that by your tire house the land who you know by your job has nothing to wear [Music] [Applause] oh we have to come to this chord as a reality sing remember when the debt in was passing it wasn't asking for hide color complexion what text up here it was not
