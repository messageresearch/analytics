that could change and transform a mind a life a Heart Lord Lord I pray that I be used as a vessel take me out of the way Lord and speak to your people in Jesus name amen let's give the Lord a hand to praise foreign [Music] at this time if you have your Bibles I'd like you to thank you musicians I'd like you to open uh the scripture Exodus chapter 3. reading three verses there this is seven to nine everybody feeling fine everybody all right I don't think I could ever get accustomed to this you know so I I am often I mean I don't want to use the word shock but I am often so grateful when I have the opportunity to speak in this way and to have the confidence placed in me to be able to share I always say I do try to share my ideas but I try to to speak and encourage you and I hope I'll be an encouragement tonight amen so pray for me as you're there worship with me so if you have a Bibles and you're found from the book of Exodus chapter 3 verses 7 to 9 it says and the Lord said I have surely seen the Affliction of my people which are in Egypt and I've heard their Cry by reason of their task Masters for I know their sorrows so that wasn't strange to the Lord so they weren't going through that alone he knew the Sorrows that they were going through amen and he says I am come down to deliver them out of the hands of the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them up out of that land unto a good land and a lodge until land flowing with milk and honey unto the place of the Canaanites and the Hittites and the amorites and the parasites and the hivites and jebusites now therefore Behold The Cry of the children of Israel is come unto me and I have also seen the oppression so not only the cry he saw the oppression he saw the circumstance he saw the challenges he saw the ups and downs he saw everything that was taking place and he says I have also seen the oppression wherewith the Egyptians oppressed them you know may the Lord I had a blessing to the reading of his word you may have your seats amen let's go so for for a simple title the title I've chosen is the Last Cry how is this related to the scripture that we just read you see at the end of the day the children of Israel as we know and we just want to sit there a little bit the children of Israel were in bondage for about 400 years so they weren't in budget for a short time they weren't enslaved for five years or two years or it was a short stint and they they went in and out no it was a period it was generation after generation you would have seen your your father your your grandfather a great grandfather and a few Generations back would have gone through this and reading this scripture we should understand that it wasn't easy it was not walk in the park no type of slavery or oppression would be easy I could only imagine that Israel being the superpower of the time at that time would have put extreme pressure on the children of Israel this was free labor that's just the way it operated they had no say in in when they eat when they drunk when they did this and that outside of I want you to do this that and the other they had to follow instructions follow rules and be highly disciplined because they were oppressed they were enslaved they had to do because that that is what was required at the time however on the backdrop of all this the Lord had made a promise that he wasn't going to leave them that way he understood that they were going through and they were going through for a reason he as we read here he saw the Affliction he knew what was happening to them so it's not strange what's been happening to you he knows he saw the oppression of the task master because they said by reason of the task master he understood by their hand they were oppressed and Afflicted they were hurt they were in pain I hope you could relate to that because sometimes we feel as if we are the only individuals going through this and nobody else understands but here we can clearly see identified in Scripture that the Lord knew the scenario they were in he knew the situation they were in he knew they were going through this and some I could just imagine somebody might have sat down with their child or grandchild and say it wouldn't always be this way you know you know I remember Granddad told me that although this might be our scenario today a day will come when this will not be our present condition where we'll be able to be free and that's the way the Lord operates however and I need to pause here what is interesting about this scripture it's twofold it's almost like a sandwich I call it in verse 7 it talks about your Affliction it talks about the hurts and the pain and what you went through and in verse 9 it does the same they went through and you cried and and you had pressure and you were oppressed and we understand that but in the middle there was a knockout there they say I am come down to deliver so this is where things change I have come down to deliver them out of the hands so so the Egyptians had no right to hold them anymore because I the boss the Lord God Almighty was coming down and with a strong hand was going to bring them out and that's just the way he operates he was going to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians so there was no hand that was going to hold on to them anymore there was no bondage there was no supervisor no manager nobody could claim to be in charge and yes they were in this position for 20 years so you had to stay there this was a sign of Jubilee this was a sign of them being released from the scenario they were in so perhaps tonight you've been going through the same thing for the last 10 years but tonight that could change because he said I am come down right now present tense to deliver them out to the hands of the Egyptians and to bring them out up out of that land until good land he didn't want to bring them from A to B just to be in the same condition he want to bring you out into a good land into a better land into a better place and he goes on to describe you say a land that is large not small not small you're not going and you're shrinking and you're timing and you're not sure if to step this way or that way it's large you could look to the east west north south you're considers the sunrise and nobody could restrict you you can freely raise your hands and praise nobody could tell you when to shout nobody could tell you when to worship nobody could tell your song into loud or you're disturbing them because he has delivered you out of bondage out of lethargy out of sleeping out of Slumber out of sickness out of pain and oppression and affliction he has raised you up to do something different to do a new thing to do something bigger and better than before so perhaps you may have been accustomed listening perhaps it was a good servant a a a model slave you know when you build homes they have a model home and they tell you come come and see this this is what everything is going to look like this is the model in the workplace when you start to work they often tell you come come come come talk to John o'hary or Gina whoever they say she will show you are wrong she'll show you the roofs often times that's the model they expect you to emulate them and operate like them because then you can fit into the culture and you'll be all right not tonight tonight we are not looking for models the only thing we're modeling is Christ you understand so we're not trying to be like me or the brother next to you or concern about the sister behind you you're trying to be the way God wants you to be because he's put something into you and he's made certain promises to you and he is well able to meet all his promises amen thank you he went on you may have your seats he went on and he said he said unto a land flowing with milk and honey I don't want to go too deep into that but but if you do research you'll realize milk and honey are not for the poor milk and honey are not for slaves milk and honey is something that you work towards and and and you have Ambitions to to be able to to participate in which is why it's a luxury which is why when the 12 Spies went out they brought back grips not not the kind of groups the seller decided he wrote it not the small ones are they important they talk about oversized I said bigger and better different this is not slavery and you take a little end and you know if we have a good time and past you have some extras it's nothing like that this is where you are first you are on top you are in charge you are above you you are a royal priesthood and a holy General listen you're chosen you're a child King can you imagine for a second let me just show you for a second can you imagine you are the child of a king and we know it when we talk about the prodigal son and you realize your father is in charge of everything and you walk in and you see he have silver hands he have a certain operation he have a certain thing where where he have food laid out there's a banquet there's a buffet have you ever gone to all you can eat buffet it's quite interesting that you could go anywhere you could go eat anything any amount nobody could watch and say um you're taking too much chicken you know Hey listen there are other people to eat if that's the case walk out walk or that's not a buffet right I'm talking about a case where it's flowing they didn't say there's a little there's a there's a honeycomb here on the left side no they say the land is a good line it is large so there's room for everybody and it's flowing with milk and honey they say answer the place and here's the thing this here is it's very very interesting they say answer the place of so it means they exist and they already you know so he didn't tell you listen I'm gonna take you out and I'm gonna bring you into the Savannah the Queen's back Savannah everything is clear all is yours everything is cleaned up everything is scripts no he's saying no he said listen he say answer the place of Diana reading it again the Canaanites and he Hittites and the amorites and the parasites and the heavites and jebusites he identified them by name so you know listen this is God not into the pity party thing he not taking you out and say listen he wasn't sleepy for 400 years so here what I know you've been through a lot you know so here ascending into therapy for a hundred years and not only that while you do that I'm gonna clean your land I'm gonna take care of you I'm gonna prepare your place no at the end of the day God is God only time he operates a particular Wing So the same way he said listen up I put you on the tutors and governors and I test you I told Jesus say to those I love I rebuke and I chase I want to ensure if you don't bring forth fruit I will prune you I will cut you I will ensure that I want to get you a particular way because you are my child you're a reflection of me you don't have your own thought side and ideas you say your thoughts are not my thoughts he said your ways are not my ways you say my thoughts are higher than you also don't try to figure this out this is the way it is he said I'm gonna take you out of bondage out of slavery but I'm gonna give you some challenges I I'm gonna open it up I'm gonna tell you what you have to face so you say you have the key in a night the amorites parasites and each of them have their own unique way but guess what he also went on to say listen Behold The Cry of the children of Israel is come unto me just forgive me here right it's come unto me and I have also seen the oppression where with the Egyptians oppress them so I I Rise onita to assure you I said to encourage you but to reassure you that he knows everything he understands what you have been true so I don't want you to try to throw the pity party because it wouldn't work he understands listen I carry you through that and I can take you out of that right so don't feel sorry for yourself and oh gosh look at me imagine this is what I'm good you're going through that because he choose that route to send you through I do songwriter say something to the water some truly Flats I'm truly fire all through the blood he knows what you have made of he knows he tests to give you to ensure that he can develop a character that you have to be so you can line up with a statue of a perfect man that's what he wants from you [Music] there's another thing in this scripture that I want to highlight and I don't tend to be long but there's something significant that I just saw here I know it's here it's here here this is a scripture this is not my ideas this is not a revelation or Mighty mystery there is something I observed the children of Israel were in bondage for 400 years just walk with me for a second if you are in bondage for 400 years can you imagine after year one or two for perhaps five give yourself 10 years that's a long time you may have thought boy you see where we are by we are the children of God the chosen people can you imagine the kind of songs they sound songs I mean we often talk about slavery songs but you can imagine the kind of songs they had the kind of cries they had can you imagine those mothers and fathers and weeping children in the nights why why after go through this why my child have to be born into slavery can you imagine the kind of cries they have I thank God they were nurturing his day because we like to March we like to demand things pluck hard and think now at the end of the day the kind of cries these people would have had I could only imagine and and this is why I choose a title because I could only imagine they would have cried they would have had tears they would have had funerals they would have had had different things would have taken place in bondage and slavery can you imagine any type of services they had I'm sure they may have had opportunities where they tell them listen gather together a little bit not too long because we have things to build we have we have people to conquer and cities to build however I'm pretty sure they would have cried sometimes because bondages are hard they but I'm here to tell you when I read that what I observed is that in verse 7 which is the first verse we read one of the things we almost glossed over but it's there he said and I'll read it one more time he said and the Lord said I have surely seen the Affliction of my people so he's looking at it he saw it which are in Egypt so it's very very specific this is not anyway those people are my people and they're in Egypt they are being Afflicted and I'm seeing it I took notice of it and I'm telling you that that is what I'm seeing because I leave them there for a while but then he goes on to say and I have heard their cry so what I believe significantly is the fact that there was a cry that he couldn't ignore in year one they may have cried in your 40 they may have cried in year 300 they may have cried it would have been a valid cry but you know what I'm here to talk about the Last Cry can you imagine you're in year 400 you don't know when the delivery are coming you just know there's a promise of a deliverer and and here's this here's the shocker in year 400 you decide brother it's real pressure is yes my great great grandfather telling me about this you see this crying thing I I don't cry you know I cried my last cry last year this is it this is it a done a done No More Tears I'm going to accept this is my position and I'm gonna make the best of it can you imagine no that's not what God wants God wants you to cry he wants you to sigh he won't show it a depth of sincerity to know that this is not the place I'm supposed to be the enemy can have me this way I'm a Child of God has chosen me and predestinated me for this time so I'm gonna cry I'm gonna hold on I'm gonna fall on my face if I have to but this is my position that I'm not staying here you see Joseph say when you go take my bones because you know this is not a promised land this is not a place that God predestinate me to stay so the the inspiration I have is don't give up no matter how dark it seems no matter how gloomy it gets don't give up you don't know tonight might be a Last Cry The Last Cry and God respond and say you know what I heard I Cry I heard the Cry of my people I heard the cry about a London tonight and I come down to deliver him tonight he may have been crying for the last five years but tonight I can't ignorly cry anymore I need to respond because this cry is not the cry to walk away from you have reached points where I have no choice at this time I have to deliver I have to bring you out so the children that you're praying for for the last 20 years and you don't know what seems to be going on you seem like they're just going Australian they're not listening and they're Disobedience and they listen to No One don't give up don't give up the fight don't give up the prayer don't give up the crying because tonight might be a Last Cry that cause God on the scene that calls Jesus on the scene to respond and bring them out and it's not by your might it's not by your power but by his save the Lord so he gonna deliver with a mighty hand so don't stop crying when they tell you cry for the Holy Ghost I don't want you to stop it might be tiring you might be wearing but God may just be looking for that last cry and once that last cry takes place he could respond because that's the one cry that he can't ignore amen [Music] [Applause] foreign bless his name bless the name of the Lord [Applause] blessed be the name of the Lord Hallelujah Hallelujah he's the same yesterday today and forever amen amen amen Glory Hallelujah you know the prophet spoke a message the title of it is as the eagle Stir It Up her nest and I say I'm not making up any of these ideas and and in paragraph 52 he says I can prove to you by science not my ideas by science that anything that doesn't move is dead that's right you know if a baby is born and they don't cry you don't Squall it don't do nothing that baby's dead that's what the matter with the church today we've got too many stillborn babies you know what the doctor usually does he picks him up by the heels and give him a little posterior protoplasma stimulation a good old-fashioned spanking that fixes him up just right and what the church needs today is a good good old-time stimulation of the power of the Holy Ghost to come into the church tear us up shake us up still up the nest and blow out the loose feathers he said too many loose feathers you want to blow it out get it out [Music] you know the beauty of God is that he doesn't change he's not predictable but he doesn't change now in the story of blind Bartimaeus you know it's so interesting and we know the story that he wanted to be healed he wanted to be set free he wanted to be delivered in a different way he wasn't in bondage as we think about it but he had an Affliction that he wanted gone he had a Deliverance that he wanted to to be met he he wanted to be delivered from the scenario the situation in which he was in so you know at one time the story is still you know he sat there and he realized the crow was no longer around and he asked what's going on what's happening I I'm not getting arms and I'm not getting a little patterns in little coins as our custom get in and they say well you know interestingly you heard of Jesus Jesus is on the next street right and and as we go on the same he was on the expectation he was expecting and in the message expectation he says notice blind bataming as he was expecting if he could get to Jesus he or attract his attention that he would be healed so here's the thing they try to get him to set down and that's the calm down to take it easy because boss man you're blind you can't go anywhere where you're going you may have had a burden or desire but you can't do anything so what you're talking about you trying to get Jesus attention everybody have needs and you know what the scripture said to say he cried more more once again we see a a theme where he cried because he had a need he wasn't crying because I feel to cry today you know but he knew his crying was going to attract the attention of Jesus and he knew if he could only get the attention of Jesus he would be healed so he cried of them all thou son of David have mercy on me for he knew if he could ever bring the attention of Jesus to him that he expected Jesus would kill him if you expect him to be healed tonight wherever you are wherever you hear this tip if you're expecting to be healed today you will be healed whatever your expectations are and that's the prophet's words that's not mine the principle Remains the Same when you cry somehow it triggers a certain reaction that cannot be ignored it cannot be avoided and and you know what no I'm not sharing the cry it's it's that last cry because I sure blind buttermils cry before you know it wasn't the first time but you know what it was the last time because when you cry like that and Jesus respond and you call him on the scene it's not going to be the same I know because he would hear that cry that cry would transcend distance so no space could hinder it you know is not necessarily the volume doing it but he faith in the cry that could connect like a deep call into a deep and the Deep have to respond no matter what the principle Remains the Same so I hope you get a clue tonight that is not the time to give up it's not the time to stop it's not the time to be wary although the promise might might go on for one year for five years for ten years 40 years this is the time to cry all the more to see the manifestation a kite on the scene that might be a Last Cry the pivotal one the critical one that calls Jesus on the scene as we go on I want to make quick mention because I said it wouldn't be long about the parable of the unjust judge As We Know and and Jesus spoke the parable unto them in this end that men ought always to pray and not faint saying there was in a city a judge which feared not God neither regarded man he was a serious fella he didn't even fear God he had no regard for man he was just about his business by the book this is what it is black and white there's no negotiation no middle ground No No Gray at all this is how he was who he was and he says at the same time there was a widow in that City and she came onto him saying avenge me of mine adversary and he would not for a while but afterward he said within himself though I fear not God nor regard man yet because this Widow trouble at me I will avenge her less by her continual coming she weary me and the Lord said hear what the unjust judge said and shall not God avenge his own elect which cry day and night unto him though he belong with them I tell you that he will avenge him speedily nevertheless when the son of man cometh shall he find faith on the earth now we see a common theme a Common Thread so it goes on to say yes she came and she knocked yes she came he may have been a particular way he may have had certain characteristics about him that may not have been conducive to what she desired and people may have had their judgments about how he operated they might say he feels tushed he's stuck up he wouldn't respond he is not the person to go to you know you're wasting your time but you know what he said you know what it's best I Avenger unless you're wearing me less by your crying less by your persistence yes by your continuity yes by your level of commitment yet listen when God looks at your faithfulness and see Wednesday after Wednesday Sunday after Sunday on Friday nights the level of commitment the consistency the cry the faith the the fact that the promise not manifested yet but you're holding on still it's been five years but you're holding on still it's been 15 years but you're holding on still after a while you say listen I will live Avengers speedily you know because you don't want to wear him he wanted to recognize that listen that fit is a real deal that is not pretense like my father always said he said you are who you are across the board across the board he said you could pretend for a while you know you could pretend that work that you're going early to work every day but guess what after a while all of a sudden you come back into your comfort zone of course I'm coming late right so you could keep it up for a long time you know but you know what it's almost like the truth will rise to the top right no matter how hard you try it have a way of leaking out and seeping out same thing with crying when you say you have that kind of commitment that kind of passion perseverance persistence and that drive and you know I have a need I want the Holy Ghost deliver my children I want you to restore I want you to open up my blind eyes I want you to fix my female condition I want it fixed tonight I want it fixed tonight I'm not going anywhere until you do it right now tonight not tomorrow tonight he have a way he just have a way that he he is almost obligated to respond I don't know your condition tonight but he knows that he is obligated to respond to that kind of a faith that kind of commitment that kind of persistence my my my my my amen amen amen isn't Jesus wonderful we can't give up now we can't stop now we've come too far down the road [Music] you know this is a guy I admire a lot I believe a lot of people could relate to him and that's that that strong man Samson you know it's so interesting that he had a covenant on his life he was called before he was born his mother knew he would have been a special child he was predestinated to operate a particular way and it was Supernatural everything he did he wasn't this kind of muscle man as as Hollywood portray him as you know but he had a strength that was unparalleled nothing else could compare to it defeats he did people looking oh as a matter of fact go on to say the enemy used to tremble just at the name something he didn't have to walk in you know just by the name you can imagine you walking down the road and they just said Gideon and people shaking that's how powerful he was just the name alone if somebody says Samson they might have said jokingly it had an effect it reminded me when I was in secondary school the principal well I went to a unique school I went to a school that used to have lick something they used a bit I know that might be outlawed no but everybody used to beat it didn't matter who it was it could be a form teacher your deed a principal I mean anybody who is anybody used to beat so the principal had a way he was a beat first and asked questions after if you believe anything wrong licks looks like he didn't care who get licks it could be the first student the brightest student the nerd it didn't matter licks lick slicks and then oh and he used to apologize if he'd be the wrong person right as a result when he left the school even no listen he retired huh when he retired from the school even the song of his name when they say Cox everybody's straighten up he had such an impact that we respected even the name being spoken mind you this was after he physically left the school he still had that lasting Legacy and impact on us thank God for that huh Samson was like that wherever he went his story went before him he was larger than life so he would go into a place would went out Samson on his way you know so you're better take care of your business sort yourself out because Samsung comment we don't know what he up to but it's interesting and we know the story how you know he cut off his hair and and we we know that part and the part that I say that we could relate to is after the fact yes after the drama after we see he was on the straight and narrow and what happened to him and it was a nice story but there came a point in which he was grinding at the Mill you probably don't spend enough time there but he was grinding can you just imagine Samson just like us the way he felt you think he felt bad terrible horrible he felt he failed God he failed his family he was a disappointment he may have cried he may have thought Lord how I could do this why why I had to do this I knew better oh gosh next time if I had a second chance if I only had another opportunity it wouldn't be this sweet he may have made promises he said Lord if you could regenerate my eyes I will ensure you know the good I will preach I will teach I will do I will be great I will give charity I will do all I could do he may have done that but you know his conscience would have convicted him he would have felt bad he would have gone through all I call it all human emotions of what he went through and what happened to him and he beat up himself and he felt he was no good and Lord you should choose somebody else and why you choose me and I disappoint you and he would have gone through this process until one day he was grinding at the middle and it might have seemed to everybody else to be a regular d because Samsung grew accustomed to grinding at the Mill you know there's a message called Just One More Time Lord that brother Branham preached and in that message in chapter 99 he says no now we find out that while Samson stood there looking over his error looking what had been done in his inner conscience that he had he had failed God Amen that's what he did he failed God he was a disappointment at that stage if we look at Samson Samson is not a role model at that point failed be like success we like to see Heroes we like Victory but he failed and it went on to say he failed God he had failed God's people and there he stood as an example thinking back what he was and thinking no what he was it would have been so different he was Samson the man whose name people was afraid of the man who was powerful and strong people had confidence in him self Samson is on our side and now he looked down and he looked through his socketless eyes and he said I'm a failure I disappointed God I disappointed my family my parents as a matter of fact people don't don't talk about me anymore there are no memes they don't like my posts I I am I I don't come for anything you know what he said he was thinking what he was and thinking no what he was and when he did that it comes up again guess what he cried out he cried out somehow our doubted the first time I'm sure there are times when he stood alone and cried cried cried cried because of what he had done cry because where he was cried because of where he was before that so cry because of the past cry because of his present condition and he said oh if the church tonight would stand still a minute and look back to the day of Pentecost look back to where we started from and realize the condition that our Creeds and fussing has gotten us into cry out again Samson cried Lord God Revenge my two eyes if we could cry that same pension and cry Lord God these things has guided me blind all these times now he knew there was a price to pay you know it there's a price to pray for doing the wrong thing but it didn't stop Samson from coming to the realization that the god you served was greater than the scenario he was in it didn't stop Samson from crying out and saying you know what and I know brother Branham said it he said he said listen he almost rationalized that God had the same power that he had before even if Samson didn't have it that the God he served was greater than the circumstance and the fact that he had disappointed the people and disappointed God that God was the same yesterday today and forever and if he could cry out to God and call out a God the poor Adventure God would hear him and God would respond and God would avenge or Revenge him of his two eyes that were lost and although he was doing wrong to lose it they were wrong to imprison him they were wrong to take it they were wrong to afflict him they were wronged to have him in pressure in that way not him he was still a child of God it didn't change the fact of who he was the prodigal son's example was the same he was no less than a son he may have been out of position he may have been out of place like you might feel at times you may have been out of church you may have felt like you're disappointed your parents your disappointed Church you disappoint somebody else you disappoint God but it doesn't change who God is and it doesn't change what God thinks about you and Samson had the ability to cry out to God and we know the rest is history although he had a price to pay God was able to come down and he said in his death more persons were slayed than in his entire life amen foreign looking at this and I keep saying it doesn't matter how many times you cry it isn't important how hard you cry or how long you cry what is important is that when God pulls the lesson you see that last cry it had a comfort you know you're carry missing in action I mean I I travel and I like to travel and and as as many persons may know if you're taking a boat or playing a train they often is what they call a final call so you could be I I remember I was traveling recently a few months ago and I thought I had a layover that was a few hours about four hours and I'm an adventurous fella I say adventurous because I wasn't in Trinidad and I looked on my phone and I saw there's a bus taking you to a mall and there's a bus to bring you back I assuming it's not Trinidad so it's efficient and on time so I took the bus and I went and I didn't expect the boss to be an old stop bus all stop mean it's stopping at all stops everyone so as I'm going I'm thinking I have a flight to catch have a flight to catch as I'm as I'm coming back I'm praying to leave our flight to catch by God's grace I made it in the story I'm about to tell you it's kind of similar at the end of the day when in the airport they make that announcement and say I'm calling x y and z you see people sometimes running the reason because they have to be on that plane before that door closes there comes a point however when they say final boarding call for and the city name no sometimes you see people tripping over themselves racing skating sliding trying to get in because it's the final call you see at that point if you miss that the door shuttle like no idea there is no way there's no listen you could be the top negotiator in the world the kind of rules and restrictions they have they don't reopen planes or reopen flights because you were late enough you could tell them listen I have a million dollars here they're not real many flights for you you know they are no respecter of persons you know that's the way God is God operates a particular way with a level of excellence and professionalism he not Viking haphazard and you know what I go make up a rule for this one this child of mine he kind of slack on a song make her I'll have the barley lower no you have one bar everybody must have the token where they are all your young you're rich you're poor you're no calm you're here for 30 years it matters not my pay is the same pay my rules are the same rules my expectations are the same why because I'm gone and I don't change I'm the same yesterday today and forever so it doesn't matter it doesn't matter that you think you don't understand everything guess what you don't have to in this season you have to have what he is looking for right so if the flight is about to take off you have to be inside you can't say well well I didn't know that flights just be on time I thought I was in Trinidad no you can't say that there's no excuse it will leave you wherever you are it doesn't matter who you are the fact that is the first time I'm traveling you know no it doesn't matter no respecter of persons his rules is his rules he operate the way he's of operating he choose to do what he wants to do when he wants to do it how he wants to do it he doesn't have to explain it to you that's just the way he is right now the same way I said that sometimes we in our finite Minds try to figure out and explain how God operates but look how he works there's a story told us we know and sometimes we highlight it by talking about the alabaster box and in the message he leodusian Church age where Abraham said you know and we know this story in the terms of the backstory Simon invited Jesus to come to his house and when he came in he said you know he said usually there's a feet washing flunky that will will clean his feet and clean up because it wasn't tables or chairs as we know it today you sat almost on the floor cross your feet and you eat perhaps with your hands and stuff right in this particular scenario Simon would have invited him over and basically ignored him came to Simon's place and whether he was there he wasn't there it made no difference at all he was just there he existed there so there was no Provisions for him there was no special treatment or or I will go so far as to say there was no normal treatment for him because that that wasn't something for the privilege or for the rich that was something you do because they walked long long distances as well and oftentimes as sandals and the cloaks and stuff would have been going through the dirt and the dung and stuff so when you reach somebody's home it's natural and normal that you will wash your feet you know so there would be be welcome they would be comfortable in the space so as we went down and we know this lady this prostitute woman saw what was taking place and she got a burden somebody said burden she had a burden and her burden was to ensure that Jesus doesn't remain that way she saw Jesus come to Simon's house and she wanted to ensure that Jesus didn't remain that way so as a result as The Story Goes she would have brought an alabaster box and anointed his feet and you say cried and she used her hair to dry it up we know the story and after that it just brings a context as to what's taking place here in the laodice paragraph 250. Jesus I guess looks over said Simon I got something to say to you you invited me here and you never met me at the door now if you were to come to my house on a normal basis meaning you arrive at my house I'll meet you at the front I might even meet you outside to welcome you in I will open the door hey come in welcome this is where I live so here they're saying Simon didn't even meet him at the door Simon was about his own business but they invited him you didn't give me any water to wash my feet with you never anointed my head when I come in take the patch of the sun off me now the way Jesus describes this you can see that this is the norm this was a regular expectation this wasn't you know I would say you're bull face if you were to come to my house and say Gideon you didn't give me some freshly squeezed orange juice you invited me in I have no obligation to do that but if it's the norm that people are walking and it's hot like it's hot these days and I say hey when people reach behind me they must drink some cold water at least you know you must be refreshed I put on the ESC so you cool long put your shoes aside and take care of you because I'm inviting you and I'm expecting to treat you a particular way so this was the norm this is nothing special here now and he said oh my you never give me any kiss of welcome when I come in but this poor woman oh my this outsider a prostitute on the street she had no water to wash my feet she washed them with her tears she had nothing to wipe them off with so she took her hair she wiped them she continually kissed my feet now I want to say to you her sins which were many are forgiven her that's right never said nothing about his your sins which are many are forgiven now the reason I read that is because she caught a burden being a prostitute and an outsider she wasn't too Corral familiar with what may have been been missing or what was taking place but she looked in and saw a need so she went and she she cried and she wiped it and she kissed his feet and she did things that Simon was supposed to do but failed to do and in doing so although Jesus highlighted the fact that listen we know this woman is a prostitution we know she's an outsider she wasn't even supposed to be there because of her burden because of a cry because of her desire because of her commitment her sins which were many were forgiven which means that was the last cry she cried in I doubt she practiced that but when she came and washed the feet of Jesus with her tears with us level of sincerity with a burden to have this wrong made right Jesus could turn to her and say listen not tomorrow not next week not next month he said listen your sins which we all know to be many are forgiven right now so I'm still saying when you cry unto God with sincerity and musicians could get ready when you call out unto God and you catch a burden for the promises of God he has to respond and when he responds that way listen you can't say the same you know she walked in a prostitute and walked out different you know the children of Israel were slaves but when they cried he said listen I've heard the cries and have come down to deliver they were free you know when you see a cry that last cry and it resonate like that when God realized that you mean business that you're not doing this because somebody trying to woke you up and somebody trying to crank you up but but you're really sincere and you really want this and you really have a burden and a desire he is obligated to keep his promises you know and the mark of God is like that the Lord said unto him you know go through the midst of the city talking about the Marco Gordon through the midst of the city through the midst of Jerusalem and set a mark upon the foreheads of the men that sigh and those that cry for all the Abominations that are done in the midst thereof and to the others he said in my hearing going after him through the city and smite let not your eyes spare neither have ye pity and slay utterly old and young earlier on when I'm saying that that Benchmark is the same it doesn't matter where they're old whether they're young whether this is your first year whether this is your 30th year his requirement is still the same he says slay utterly old and young but maids and little children and woman but come not near any man upon whom is the mark who got the mark those outside and cry those that had that burden that those that had that level of commitment and sincerity knowing that he who made the promises able to calm down and deliver no matter what your scenario your situation your circumstance he said then they began at the ancient men which were before the house so once again there's no respecter persons it doesn't matter that you're an elder a dick not a minister his requirement is the same no matter where you are no matter where you go he still requires that kind of desperation that kind of cry to get in the spirit that kind of call to ensure that that you do have a level of sincerity yes you may have fallen yes you may have made disappointments yes you have made missteps but it doesn't change God's perception and God's view of you it doesn't change his greatness and his goodness and his ability to do above and beyond all you can have or think all that you could imagine he is well able to deliver cry that cry for who knows that might be a last crime keep on fighting keep on pressing don't give up no matter how dark it seems how gloomy it seems how wary it might be know that he is faithful and able to keep all his promises and deliver amen God bless you alone oh giving praise tonight oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory to God thank your father thank you Lord for your word thank you for
