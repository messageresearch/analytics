[35:40] verse
[35:42] uh that we read verse 44 the kingdom of

[36:34] lord some praises
[36:35] okay let's continue
[36:37] let me say this
[36:39] any doctrine
[36:40] teaching
[36:41] that hinders you or keep you from the
[36:44] kingdom is of the devil
[36:48] any doctrine
[36:50] any teaching that keeps you away from
[36:52] the holy ghost from the kingdom of god
[36:55] is of the devil
[36:56] doesn't matter who teach it
[36:58] who preach it who unveil it to unfold it
[37:01] doesn't matter who he is because the
[37:03] only two kingdoms
[37:04] there's only two forces is the kingdom
[37:06] of light and the kingdom of the darkness
[37:09] and jesus the bible speaks about he
[37:11] keeps he's the kingdom of heaven is at
[37:13] hand
[37:14] oh praise the name of the lord
[37:16] i'm going to read matthew 4
[37:18] and when jesus was 12 had heard that
[37:21] john was cast into prison he departed to
[37:24] the galilee
[37:25] leaving nazareth he came until in
[37:27] capernaum which is upon the seacoast in
[37:29] the borders of zabalan and naftalim that
[37:32] it might be fulfilled which was spoken
[37:34] by is the prophet saying the land of
[37:36] zabalan the land of nephilim by the way
[37:39] of the sea beyond jordan galilei of the
[37:41] gentiles the people with saturn darkness
[37:43] so a great light so them which sat in
[37:45] the region of the shadow of death light
[37:47] is sprung up
[37:49] oh praise god from that time jesus began
[37:52] to preach and say repent for the kingdom
[37:54] of heaven is at hand
[37:56] oh glory to god so his first message of
[37:59] introduction was the kingdom of heaven
[38:01] is at hand in other words this natural
[38:04] world kingdom with demon activity hidden
[38:08] jesus was about to expose
[38:11] satan's kingdom hidden on the earth
[38:14] he was going to expose it by casting
[38:16] devils by opening the blind eye by
[38:19] healing the sick by raising the dead
[38:21] that's showing there's a higher kingdom
[38:24] that the kingdom of this world and
[38:25] that's why jesus said my kingdom oh
[38:27] glory to god praise god the angel going
[38:29] to fight for me but i represent a
[38:31] different kingdom altogether glory to
[38:33] god isn't that right he said repent for
[38:36] the kingdom of heaven is at hand
[38:38] matthew 23 13 he said born to you scribe
[38:42] and pharisees hypocrites for you shut up
[38:44] the kingdom of heaven against men for
[38:47] you neither go in your cells neither
[38:49] suffering them that are entering to go
[38:50] in
[38:51] there is something to go in
[38:53] the kingdom you have to go in what
[38:55] killed you getting lost some praises you
[38:58] just sit and hang around you have to go
[38:59] in this kingdom the bible says the
[39:01] kingdom is preaching every man
[39:03] every man
[39:05] every man pressed their way into it
[39:07] could you give the lord a shout tonight
[39:10] i feel good being here i was excited to
[39:12] come tonight i earned a great
[39:14] expectation oh globe buy that field
[39:17] tonight oh you have something to
[39:19] purchase
[39:20] hallelujah you have a price to pay
[39:23] are you willing to pay it
[39:25] hallelujah praise god he said born to
[39:27] you scribe and parties hypocrites
[39:31] for you shut up the kingdom of heaven
[39:33] against men
[39:35] they're not going in and they don't let
[39:36] the people go in
[39:38] they're on the surface
[39:40] and it's a conference of intellectual
[39:43] or gymnast verbal gymnastics i call it
[39:46] flipping here and flipping there
[39:48] glory to god brother branham
[39:50] oh god
[39:52] make men and women rise in the power of
[39:54] the spirit
[39:57] you hear that
[40:00] oh god make men and women rise in the
[40:03] power of the spirit
[40:05] let that unconverted that dejected devil
[40:09] that has harmed the human race down
[40:11] through the age stand here and defy the
[40:14] church of living god say it and come out
[40:17] and leave in the name of jesus christ
[40:20] a rejected rejected spirit looking for
[40:23] houses he has no house he has no home

[50:30] place to hide it was in the field
[50:32] nobody looking no fear
[50:34] so when you have your treasure you hide
[50:35] it hide it from bandits sorry from
[50:37] rubbers you hide it somewhere and this
[50:40] man passed into this field see some kind
[50:41] of thing and suddenly make him dig and
[50:43] check it and he see the treasure he said
[50:48] well he no fool
[50:49] he's taking them hiding again
[50:51] you know he can't rub if you take it
[50:52] he's a rubber yeah he can walk cause
[50:54] he's a teeth
[50:55] he can't take that out to the field he
[50:58] has to hide it somewhere else because
[50:59] somebody somebody see the same thing and
[51:01] dig it up and take it so he hide it
[51:02] somewhere else
[51:04] i said how much would that feel
[51:06] when they call the price boy he said
[51:10] but i know what in that field
[51:12] it worked
[51:14] and then he's at a cell

[51:19] inspiration what are you prepared to
[51:21] give up pray

[59:09] and when you receive it that way it
[59:11] becomes your personal property then
[59:13] you're walking in faith by revelation
[59:15] hey and you could speak by the
[59:17] revelation of your faith
[59:19] oh give the lord some praises tonight
[59:21] hope you see it
[59:23] hallelujah
[59:24] so what god will bring it to pass if you
[59:26] take the right attitude towards it
[59:28] knowing if god said so the promise is
[59:31] yours and it's your personal property
[59:34] the very minute you receive it that way
[59:37] then it has
[59:38] to come to pass
[59:41] he's not hoping so i'm guessing so
[59:44] oh my praise the name of the lord mark
[59:46] 10
[59:47] 17 we read
[59:49] and when he was going forth into the way
[59:52] there came one running
[59:54] kneel to him and asked him
[59:56] good master
[59:58] what shall i do that i'm inheriting
[1:00:00] eternal life
[1:00:01] and jesus said unto him
[1:00:03] why call his dawn me good
[1:00:05] there is no good but one that is gone
[1:00:07] don't know is the commandments
[1:00:09] and jesus
[1:00:12] introduce a few to him that's what jesus
[1:00:15] is there
[1:00:16] he he
[1:00:18] almost like he beat him he he put out
[1:00:20] certain ones in him and these were the
[1:00:22] ones do not commit adultery
[1:00:25] do not kill
[1:00:27] three do not steal
[1:00:28] four do not be a false witness
[1:00:31] five defraud not
[1:00:33] six honor thy father and mother
[1:00:36] so jesus presented six
[1:00:38] and the boy and the man said he answered
[1:00:40] and seven say master all these have i
[1:00:43] observed for my youth
[1:00:45] then jesus
[1:00:47] this is the tough part now
[1:00:49] behold in him
[1:00:51] loved him
[1:00:53] i said unto him one thing though lucas
[1:00:57] now this is a class act even jesus
[1:00:58] presented to him
[1:01:00] go thy way
[1:01:02] sell
[1:01:04] whatsoever dog has
[1:01:07] and give to the poor
[1:01:09] and those shall have treasure
[1:01:12] in heaven
[1:01:13] and come
[1:01:15] take up the cross
[1:01:17] and follow me
[1:01:20] and he was sad at that scene
[1:01:22] and when we grieved
[1:01:24] for he had great possessions
[1:01:26] now obviously he missed
[1:01:29] some commandment there
[1:01:31] he missed
[1:01:33] helping his neighbor
[1:01:35] he missed seeing people who in need
[1:01:37] are not helping them
[1:01:39] he had he was in power to help them he
[1:01:41] did not
[1:01:42] there was greed there
[1:01:44] there was lust there
[1:01:46] but they are humans
[1:01:48] they could love and everything else by
[1:01:49] the spirit that is there
[1:01:51] and even though
[1:01:52] he was performing the outward church
[1:01:55] message thing
[1:01:57] there was something still lacking
[1:01:59] now let's look again at the same
[1:02:02] scripture in the same story in matthew
[1:02:05] 19
[1:02:06] and i want to read it from the script
[1:02:08] the young man said unto him all these
[1:02:09] things have i kept
[1:02:11] from my youth up what la yet
[1:02:15] so you get a confirmation
[1:02:18] that these things are what he does so
[1:02:21] i'm fine to that point what i'm missing
[1:02:24] here
[1:02:25] jesus said unto him
[1:02:27] listen matthew 19.
[1:02:29] if thou will be perfect
[1:02:34] so this gave a different spin on this
[1:02:36] whole parable now if thou will be
[1:02:38] perfect
[1:02:40] go and sell
[1:02:42] that thou hast
[1:02:43] and give to the poor
[1:02:45] and those who have treasured heaven and
[1:02:47] come follow me and when the young man
[1:02:49] heard that saying he went to be
[1:02:50] sorrowful
[1:02:52] for he had great possessions
[1:02:54] oh my
[1:02:55] buddy
[1:02:57] you see
[1:02:58] if you don't go according to the will of
[1:03:00] god
[1:03:01] the way that god has given us to go
[1:03:03] they always get messed up and take off
[1:03:06] in some organization or denomination
[1:03:09] he said watch you talk about this boy
[1:03:13] that boy was confronted with he had been
[1:03:16] a member of maybe the pharisees or
[1:03:18] sadducees some great order of that day
[1:03:20] he was religious as he could be
[1:03:23] i've observed these commandments i don't
[1:03:25] want to listen to this is a story you
[1:03:27] know
[1:03:28] i want you to see this as message folks
[1:03:32] yeah
[1:03:34] i want you to see this as religious
[1:03:37] message people
[1:03:41] he said i've observed these commandments
[1:03:43] i've been taught since i was a youth and
[1:03:45] jesus loved him for it but he refused
[1:03:49] to be guided
[1:03:51] he refused to accept
[1:03:54] the real leadership of jesus christ
[1:03:57] to give him eternal life
[1:03:59] notice
[1:04:00] he believed there was something
[1:04:02] different than what he had
[1:04:04] or he would have never said good master
[1:04:06] what must i do now
[1:04:10] no he wanted to do something himself
[1:04:13] that's the way we do we want to do
[1:04:15] something ourselves the gift of god is a
[1:04:17] free gift god give it to you you don't
[1:04:20] have wanting for it
[1:04:21] he ordained it to you and you're going
[1:04:23] to have it see
[1:04:24] notice
[1:04:25] he knew it was there
[1:04:27] he believed in it
[1:04:29] wanting it
[1:04:30] so i want the holy ghost to want the
[1:04:32] blessing i want dynamics i want
[1:04:35] breakthrough let's continue but when he
[1:04:37] was confronted with how he had to do it
[1:04:42] what he wanted
[1:04:43] i want the treasure you know it's
[1:04:45] hitting the field
[1:04:47] but how are you guys in the field
[1:04:49] you have to buy it how are you going to
[1:04:51] buy it sell
[1:04:54] all
[1:04:58] sell what you have
[1:05:00] i hope this is helping someone tonight
[1:05:05] when he was confronted with how he had
[1:05:08] to do it
[1:05:09] it was different from his ritual
[1:05:12] it was different he could hold his money
[1:05:16] and belong to the church that he
[1:05:17] belonged to and so forth but jesus knew
[1:05:20] that he knew he hoarded his money
[1:05:24] there was a demon a money demon back
[1:05:26] there a demon a lust
[1:05:28] and god want to free him from the lust
[1:05:31] not god want to make him poor you know
[1:05:34] sell to give is not to make him poor you
[1:05:36] know it's to get him delivered from that
[1:05:38] spirit because spirit having bone
[1:05:41] if he give it will lose him from that
[1:05:43] the spirit had no connection with that
[1:05:45] he can't this period can ride on that
[1:05:53] he said go and sell your gut and give it
[1:05:54] to the poor
[1:05:56] come take up your course and follow me
[1:05:57] and you'll have treasures in heaven but
[1:05:58] he couldn't do it the other leaders that
[1:06:00] he had in his beautiful days here we go
[1:06:03] this is deep
[1:06:05] had such an influence on him
[1:06:08] till he refused to accept
[1:06:11] god's provided way
[1:06:13] which was jesus christ
[1:06:15] the only one who holds eternal life the
[1:06:18] only one that could give you it not the
[1:06:20] church can give you eternal life not
[1:06:22] your neighbor not your pastor not your
[1:06:24] priest not your creed only jesus christ
[1:06:27] himself
[1:06:28] can give you eternal life
[1:06:30] why people hold on to their pastor
[1:06:32] why people hold on to their creed why
[1:06:34] people hold in their church and only
[1:06:35] jesus christ can give them eternal life
[1:06:38] or give the lord some praises
[1:06:40] hallelujah
[1:06:42] then the prophet presented this no
[1:06:43] matter how good you are one what you
[1:06:46] quit doing what you start doing you've
[1:06:48] got to accept the person of the lord
[1:06:51] jesus christ and then when you do that
[1:06:53] he is the word and then your life fits
[1:06:56] right into the word and it's manifest
[1:06:58] itself to the ease you're living in
[1:07:01] how could you be in the message and have
[1:07:03] no forgiveness that is madness when this
[1:07:06] message is forgiveness
[1:07:08] how could you be in this message and
[1:07:10] don't have the spirit of brotherly
[1:07:11] kindness and forgiveness to forgive your
[1:07:12] brother
[1:07:13] when that's the only door to enter into
[1:07:15] the holy spirit slot
[1:07:17] god put broadly kindness right there
[1:07:20] when you stand praying forgive if you
[1:07:22] have ought against any if you're fed up
[1:07:24] on me talk with early kindness you're
[1:07:25] gonna get fed up again because i'll keep
[1:07:27] talking about it praise god there's the
[1:07:29] entrance door to the holy spirit if
[1:07:31] you can't strike brotherly kindness you
[1:07:34] can't get in the holy spirit oh glory to
[1:07:36] god because faith for the holy spirit is
[1:07:38] based on forgiveness or give the lord
[1:07:40] some praises tonight
[1:07:42] oh give the lord some a shout tonight
[1:07:45] hallelujah praise god
[1:07:50] what is the kingdom of heaven
[1:07:53] the church
[1:07:54] was built upon divine revelation of god
[1:07:57] flesh and blood had no reveals unto you
[1:07:59] peter but my father was in heaven has
[1:08:01] revealed it to you and upon this rock
[1:08:03] spiritual revelation of the word i will
[1:08:05] build my church
[1:08:07] jesus talk about my church not our
[1:08:09] church here you're talking about his
[1:08:11] church his church is built upon what
[1:08:13] revelation okay that means the spirit
[1:08:15] reveal it
[1:08:16] not pastor unfold spirit reveal what
[1:08:19] he's saying my
[1:08:20] reveal pastor could speak but the spirit
[1:08:22] should not take the word and reveal
[1:08:24] and when it's revealed to you it's a
[1:08:25] revelation and that revolution is yours
[1:08:28] that is your neighbor owned by your
[1:08:30] husband now your iphone is yours you
[1:08:32] could be sitting next to a husband wife
[1:08:33] whoever and god given you revelation
[1:08:36] they cannot know your revelation
[1:08:39] or give the lord a shout because it's
[1:08:40] himself revealed
[1:08:42] to you and in you oh give the lord some
[1:08:45] praises tonight
[1:08:46] hallelujah and that's why the prophet
[1:08:48] said
[1:08:49] divine revelation is more important to
[1:08:50] you than you think
[1:08:52] not understanding
[1:08:54] revelation
[1:08:56] because people understand a lot of
[1:08:57] things but they don't have the
[1:08:58] revelation of it because revelation is
[1:09:01] fate
[1:09:02] revelation gives you authority
[1:09:03] revelation help you to stand whitening
[1:09:05] abram staggered not for 25 years it's

[1:13:07] power of the inspiration she will move
[1:13:10] right on and on and on and on and no
[1:13:13] denomination can stop it

[1:14:01] i will bind it in heaven
[1:14:03] whatever you lose on this earth i would
[1:14:05] lose it in heaven did he say in matthew

[1:14:46] oh glory to god hallelujah what is the
[1:14:48] kingdom of heaven the holy spirit the
[1:14:50] bible said the kingdom of god is within
[1:14:52] you

[1:14:56] that until they see the kingdom of god
[1:14:57] coming in power just a few days later
[1:15:00] was pentecost see some standing here
[1:15:02] right there the same thing some of you
[1:15:04] standing here you are being transfigured
[1:15:06] you won't see debt until you see the
[1:15:07] kingdom of god coming in power the bible
[1:15:10] said the kingdom is within you or when
[1:15:12] jesus rose from the dead remember he had
[1:15:14] on his side the keys of death and hell
[1:15:17] not the keys of the kingdom
[1:15:21] that was given to the church
[1:15:23] and peter had the keys
[1:15:26] do you believe jesus would keep his word
[1:15:28] if he doesn't so peter said i give you
[1:15:29] the keys to the kingdom in other words
[1:15:31] to the holy spirit whatever you bind on
[1:15:33] earth i will bind in heaven they said
[1:15:36] men and bridges what shall we do to be
[1:15:37] saved and what's peter he had the keys
[1:15:39] to the kingdom and when jesus rose on
[1:15:41] the third day he did not have the keys
[1:15:42] to the kingdom of heaven did you know
[1:15:44] that
[1:15:44] he said i got the keys to death and hell
[1:15:47] but not to the kingdom because it had
[1:15:49] been given to peter so peter had to
[1:15:51] unlock the kingdom and he said peter
[1:15:53] said whatever you loose on earth i'll
[1:15:54] loose in heaven whatever you're pine on
[1:15:56] it i'll find heaven now here he stands
[1:15:58] with the keys to open up the blessed
[1:16:00] thing to the world and here he got the
[1:16:02] keys in his hand they're asking him what
[1:16:04] shall we do to be saved no matter what
[1:16:06] the apostle said to do god has to
[1:16:08] recognize it in heaven as he give him
[1:16:10] that authority and peter said repent
[1:16:12] every one of you so god was honoring
[1:16:14] peter's word repent every one of you and
[1:16:17] be baptized in the name of jesus christ
[1:16:19] for remission of your sins and you shall
[1:16:22] receive the gift of the holy ghost does
[1:16:25] this apply or it does not apply or give
[1:16:27] the lord a shout peter had the keys to
[1:16:30] the kingdom
[1:16:31] oh give the lord some praises tonight
[1:16:34] wish the whole church was here
[1:16:35] hallelujah praise god praise god
[1:16:38] hallelujah you shall receive together
[1:16:40] the holy ghost that's right and that's
[1:16:41] the reason the key is turn in heaven to
[1:16:44] any other name any other way any other
[1:16:46] form it turned on earth it turned in
[1:16:48] heaven and jesus didn't keep his word to
[1:16:51] peter and it or jesus didn't keep his
[1:16:53] word to peter and every place in the
[1:16:54] bible they were baptized after that they
[1:16:57] were baptized in the name of jesus
[1:16:58] christ and their they were baptized
[1:17:01] before had to come and baptize over
[1:17:02] again in the name of jesus christ to get
[1:17:05] the holy ghost because peter unlocked
[1:17:07] the holy ghost by the key of the lord
[1:17:09] jesus christ or give the lord a shout in
[1:17:11] the house and therefore god can't honor
[1:17:13] any other thing but the baptism of the
[1:17:15] holy ghost by way of the lord jesus
[1:17:18] christ repent every one of you and be
[1:17:20] baptized in the name of jesus christ and
[1:17:22] you shall receive something you shall
[1:17:24] receive something not a message book not
[1:17:26] a message but the gift of the holy ghost
[1:17:29] and you can put the message book and
[1:17:30] tape on top of that or give the lord
[1:17:32] some shouts in the house
[1:17:33] oh
[1:17:34] hallelujah praise god praise god
[1:17:37] hallelujah
[1:17:40] jesus said if a son acts a bread in your
[1:17:42] view that is a father luke's 11 11 will
[1:17:45] you give him a stone or if he ask a fish
[1:17:48] will for a fish give him a serpent or if
[1:17:50] he asks an egg will he offer him a
[1:17:52] scorpion if he then being evil know how
[1:17:55] to get good gifts onto your children how
[1:17:57] much more shall your heavenly father
[1:17:59] give the holy ghost to them that ask him
[1:18:01] oh my if thou
[1:18:03] would be perfect
[1:18:05] so we read the scripture
[1:18:07] about that young man
[1:18:08] and the other scripture brings a
[1:18:10] different context of it that that
[1:18:12] selling all has to do with perfection
[1:18:15] if you want to be perfect
[1:18:17] you have to call a seal
[1:18:20] you have to pay a price
[1:18:22] it's not a huge price it's an individual
[1:18:24] price
[1:18:26] it's not a church cost it's an
[1:18:27] individual cost
[1:18:28] it don't be perfect
[1:18:30] sell oil
[1:18:31] so brother i'm talking about burnley
[1:18:33] kindness holy decency place in christ
[1:18:35] three steps three phases however you
[1:18:37] want to call it isn't that right
[1:18:39] very love holy since he placed in christ
[1:18:42] in this step and stage nobody forcing
[1:18:44] you
[1:18:45] this is powerful
[1:18:48] nobody forcing you
[1:18:50] and this is important to understand
[1:18:53] if doll will be perfect
[1:18:56] you have a choice to sell or not to sell
[1:18:58] you have a choice to buy the field
[1:18:59] although by the field you know the body
[1:19:00] feeling nobody forces anybody
[1:19:03] it's up to you
[1:19:06] if they will be perfect
[1:19:09] sell all
[1:19:12] so i want to read the scripture read
[1:19:13] again again the kingdom of heaven is
[1:19:14] like about under treasure
[1:19:17] hid in a field
[1:19:18] this is the kingdom now
[1:19:20] describing what the kingdom is like
[1:19:22] it's not the king of it like mangoes and
[1:19:24] a mango tree or apples and apple tree
[1:19:26] and you're walking there and you pick it
[1:19:27] and you pick the kingdom
[1:19:29] no it describes the kingdom as a
[1:19:31] treasure
[1:19:33] hid in a field
[1:19:35] that you discover
[1:19:37] hallelujah
[1:19:39] and when you discover it you want that
[1:19:41] treasure
[1:19:42] but to get the treasure you have to buy
[1:19:44] the field
[1:19:46] the whole field it doesn't matter the
[1:19:48] course you know because you are prepared
[1:19:50] to sell all
[1:19:58] right brother branham
[1:20:00] i want to say this
[1:20:01] he said rapturing feet
[1:20:03] is lean in the message
[1:20:06] in other words rapturing faith the faith
[1:20:08] will leave here is hidden
[1:20:11] in the word
[1:20:14] did you get that
[1:20:16] the thing to leave here is in the wood
[1:20:21] let's read
[1:20:22] when he started to write his other seven
[1:20:24] thunders he said don't write it you have
[1:20:26] to be commissioned to write everything
[1:20:27] he's seen but when those seven thunders
[1:20:29] open version 10 uttered he said don't
[1:20:30] write them at all they are mysteries
[1:20:32] we don't know what they are yet
[1:20:34] but my opinion they'll be revealed right
[1:20:36] away
[1:20:37] and when it do it will give faith
[1:20:40] for that rapture and grace
[1:20:42] for the church to move out
[1:20:45] we want to receive rapture in grace
[1:20:47] we want to be able when that mysterious
[1:20:49] thunder turn is out younger and the
[1:20:51] chase is taken up we want to be ready to
[1:20:53] receive it
[1:20:54] lord granted
[1:20:57] one more
[1:20:58] that's the reason i do believe
[1:21:00] when the bride is called out
[1:21:03] one
[1:21:04] and elected
[1:21:06] to
[1:21:07] and set in the book of life
[1:21:10] tree
[1:21:11] there will come a song from heaven
[1:21:13] that will take such a baptism of the
[1:21:15] holy spirit
[1:21:17] into that pride
[1:21:19] that will take her from the eight
[1:21:21] in a rapture in greece
[1:21:23] god
[1:21:24] promised it
[1:21:26] is no mystery doing that channel he said
[1:21:29] a baptism coming
[1:21:31] that will come into the bride
[1:21:33] such a powerful baptism it will take her
[1:21:35] off the earth
[1:21:37] oh are you in the church i am front are
[1:21:39] you in the savior's bride come and be
[1:21:42] baptized into the body
[1:21:44] and forevermore abide.
[1:21:50] so god is not forcing anybody to do
[1:21:52] anything
[1:21:53] you don't have to sell
[1:21:57] but if though would be perfect
[1:22:00] jesus said to the man go and sell oil
[1:22:02] that thou hast
[1:22:04] so tonight
[1:22:05] is up to you
[1:22:07] because matthew 5 40 it says be there
[1:22:09] for perfect
[1:22:10] as your father
[1:22:12] in heaven
[1:22:13] is perfect
[1:22:15] how does this perfection come
[1:22:17] for the brown
[1:22:19] eternal life has no end
[1:22:22] because it had no beginning it can never
[1:22:24] die because it never was born
[1:22:26] it has no beginning of days it has not
[1:22:28] enough time now the only way that we can
[1:22:31] live eternally is to receive in
[1:22:32] something that is eternal
[1:22:35] and god you see how he's saying that
[1:22:37] he's bright and born bright and thinking
[1:22:40] gotta receive something
[1:22:42] that is eternal
[1:22:44] and god was before there was anything it
[1:22:47] was god god never had a beginning on end
[1:22:50] and god he's digging down deeper was
[1:22:53] this great spirit we pictured him seven
[1:22:56] colors of the rainbow the bow would
[1:22:58] cover the earth right he says now this
[1:23:00] eternal god he was the perfect love
[1:23:03] perfect peace perfect joy perfect
[1:23:05] satisfaction all
[1:23:07] those
[1:23:08] seven spirits as we get in revelation
[1:23:11] they come out was make up god
[1:23:15] was perfection
[1:23:17] so he said the seven spirits
[1:23:19] which make up god
[1:23:20] was
[1:23:21] perfection
[1:23:23] so when you see that pyramid you know
[1:23:25] that is
[1:23:26] perfection or give the lord a shout in
[1:23:29] the house
[1:23:30] everything else outside of that has been
[1:23:34] something that has been perverted from
[1:23:36] that
[1:23:37] so that seven rainbows
[1:23:39] that seven rainbow is
[1:23:42] that perfection
[1:23:43] yeah he get a bum now and the only way
[1:23:46] that we could come back to perfection is
[1:23:49] to come back with that perfection which
[1:23:52] is god
[1:23:53] then we come back to perfection as we
[1:23:55] come back to the rainbow
[1:23:57] in the beginning was the word but before
[1:23:58] the beginning was the rainbow
[1:24:00] in the beginning was the logos but
[1:24:01] before the lowest was elohim
[1:24:03] self-existent one seven perfect spirits
[1:24:05] so he said to get back to perfection we
[1:24:07] have to get back to the semi-spirits all
[1:24:09] glory to god but in the beginning was
[1:24:10] the word to get back to perfection they
[1:24:12] go back before there was a word oh glory
[1:24:14] to god the word beginning argument there
[1:24:17] is no argument before the beginning oh
[1:24:19] give the lord a shout it was perfect oh
[1:24:21] glory to god perfection the rainbow
[1:24:24] elohim oh glory to god hallelujah so
[1:24:28] perfection come by the seven spirits of
[1:24:30] elohim
[1:24:31] forming us into this word image
[1:24:35] form in form and that's why the trials
[1:24:37] come
[1:24:38] to form and to change and to transform
[1:24:40] you that's why your faith had to be
[1:24:41] tested
[1:24:43] our feet have you have to be approved
[1:24:45] hallelujah
[1:24:47] we said it before we said it's more than
[1:24:49] more than once the dynamic struck the
[1:24:51] pentecostal and it couldn't bring the
[1:24:52] perfection
[1:24:53] because all that was the gifts
[1:24:55] they didn't have the word
[1:24:57] so god put the word in that when the
[1:24:59] dynamics strike us
[1:25:00] we could unfold and we could come to
[1:25:02] that perfection
[1:25:03] isn't that right because we have the
[1:25:05] opportunity now to be formed into the
[1:25:07] word image
[1:25:08] forming this touch of a perfect man this
[1:25:11] is the being
[1:25:12] hallelujah that's going to tie this
[1:25:15] there's a message i'm teaching that ties
[1:25:16] the man that's going to be redeemed
[1:25:18] oh glory to god
[1:25:20] talk about the redeemed life but this
[1:25:22] teach him such a perfect man seven
[1:25:25] virtues
[1:25:26] hallelujah is what tied a man that's
[1:25:29] going to be redeemed
[1:25:30] and this that this being when it's
[1:25:32] completed
[1:25:33] completed
[1:25:34] is the servant of god
[1:25:36] in the church of god that's going in the
[1:25:38] rapture if that is not completed he's
[1:25:40] not going in a rapture i don't care
[1:25:42] faithful how loyal how long we're
[1:25:43] preaching how long the gray hair is it
[1:25:45] doesn't matter how much mystery review
[1:25:47] that has to be completed at the end of
[1:25:48] the sermon he has to have seven virtues
[1:25:51] tunneling inside of him that the devil
[1:25:53] could recognize that's the thunder that
[1:25:55] shake the devil oh glory the god exposes
[1:25:57] the devil shows up the devil oh give the
[1:26:00] lord some praises
[1:26:05] perfection coming by
[1:26:07] seven spirits
[1:26:08] forming us into the word image
[1:26:10] through ii peter one four through seven
[1:26:13] by these promises we become partakers of
[1:26:15] his divine nature having escaped the
[1:26:17] corruption of this world through lust
[1:26:19] giving all diligence up to your faith
[1:26:21] virtue and devote your knowledge into
[1:26:23] knowledge temperance and patience and

[1:31:40] what cuba is stature why take a total
[1:31:42] arraignment consider the leaders of the
[1:31:44] field how they grow the toilet nut
[1:31:46] neither do they spin yet i say unto you
[1:31:48] that even solomon in all his glory was
[1:31:50] not arrayed like one of these wherefore
[1:31:51] if god so clothed the grass you saw
[1:31:53] jesus talking simple is that jesus
[1:31:55] connecting the death to them showing
[1:31:56] them lily feel valley he's talking to
[1:31:58] them that they understand anybody could
[1:32:01] understand the parable that he is
[1:32:03] of the kingdom of god
[1:32:07] he said take no thought you say
[1:32:09] wherefore if god so close the grass of
[1:32:11] the field which today isn't the more his
[1:32:12] casting day of them shall not much more
[1:32:14] clothe you
[1:32:17] and he busts them oh ye of little fit
[1:32:19] you're doing my faith to get close you
[1:32:21] don't have faith god of fear
[1:32:22] are you know what the amazing page you
[1:32:24] never went hungry hungry
[1:32:27] you never went in starvation you know
[1:32:29] only god kept you all these years come
[1:32:30] on
[1:32:33] for after all these things to the
[1:32:35] gentiles seek
[1:32:36] your heavenly father know it that you
[1:32:37] have need of these things
[1:32:39] but seek first
[1:32:41] first
[1:32:42] first
[1:32:44] the treasure
[1:32:45] first the kingdom
[1:32:46] seek first the kingdom of god and his
[1:32:48] righteousness and all these things shall
[1:32:50] be added to you
[1:32:53] so make this your fullest parody
[1:32:56] i'm going to close
[1:32:57] paul i'm going to skip now
[1:33:00] paul
[1:33:02] paul became a prisoner he said the love
[1:33:04] of god has been so tremendous on such a
[1:33:07] revelation that he could not get away
[1:33:08] from it
[1:33:10] that's the true experience of every
[1:33:12] believer who meets god
[1:33:14] you come in contact with something so
[1:33:16] great
[1:33:17] you become a prisoner to everything else
[1:33:20] you get away from everything
[1:33:22] to imprison yourself to this
[1:33:24] it's expressed one time where jesus said
[1:33:26] the kingdom of heaven
[1:33:28] is something like a man behind pearls
[1:33:30] and when he find that great pearl he
[1:33:32] sells out everything he's got to get
[1:33:35] that one and that's the way here
[1:33:38] you have had intellectual conception you
[1:33:40] had theological experience but when it
[1:33:42] comes to a time
[1:33:43] when you really find the real thing
[1:33:47] you just sell out
[1:33:49] everything else
[1:33:50] and you close yourself into this
[1:33:53] and paul knew what it was
[1:33:56] he found out that he was harnessed to
[1:33:58] something
[1:33:59] like the fellow
[1:34:00] horse is a harness to pull something
[1:34:02] paul knew after this experience and
[1:34:06] three years and a half of typing the
[1:34:09] experience he had with the bible he
[1:34:11] realized that god had chosen him and had
[1:34:14] harnessed him by the holy spirit the
[1:34:15] experience he had to pull the gospel in
[1:34:18] the presence of the gentiles the spirit
[1:34:20] itself harnessed him
[1:34:22] and today as servants of christ we
[1:34:23] become harnessed hooked up we can't go
[1:34:26] anywhere without
[1:34:28] us harness to the word no matter what
[1:34:31] anyone else says you harness it there is
[1:34:33] something about it it's it's that you
[1:34:36] just can't get away from it you have
[1:34:38] been yoked up by the holy ghost
[1:34:40] has yoke you to the word
[1:34:42] no matter what anyone else say is the
[1:34:45] word that has harnessed up with it put
[1:34:47] the yoke with it to the word unto the
[1:34:50] spirit
[1:34:51] and i'm done with the final scripture
[1:34:52] reading from second corinthians four
[1:34:55] one to seven are we going to close
[1:34:56] you'll begin to play something
[1:34:59] paul speaks therefore seeing we have
[1:35:01] this ministry
[1:35:03] as we have received mercy we think not
[1:35:06] but have renounced the hidden things of
[1:35:08] dishonesty
[1:35:10] not walking in craftsness no handling
[1:35:12] the word of god deceitfully now he is
[1:35:14] saying that because it is possible for a
[1:35:16] man to handle the word of god
[1:35:17] deceitfully that is why paul is saying
[1:35:19] that here
[1:35:21] but by manifestation of the truth
[1:35:23] commending ourselves to every man's
[1:35:25] conscience in the sight of god but if
[1:35:27] all gospel be hidden
[1:35:29] it is hit to them
[1:35:31] that are lost
[1:35:32] in whom the god of this world has
[1:35:35] blinded the minds of them that believe
[1:35:37] not least the light of the glorious
[1:35:40] gospel of christ who is in the image of
[1:35:42] god should shine unto them for we preach
[1:35:45] not ourselves
[1:35:46] but christ jesus the lord and ourselves
[1:35:49] your servants for jesus sake for god who
[1:35:52] commanded the light to shine out of
[1:35:53] darkness had shine in our hearts to give
[1:35:56] the light of the knowledge of the glory
[1:35:58] of god in the face of jesus christ
[1:36:01] but we have this treasure
[1:36:03] in earthen vessels that the excellency
[1:36:06] of the power
[1:36:08] may be
[1:36:08] of god
[1:36:10] another verse has bought hers
[1:36:19] heavenly father we thank you for your
[1:36:21] presence lord
[1:36:23] what you
[1:36:25] give me i have given to your people
[1:36:28] this kingdom of heaven
[1:36:30] this treasure
[1:36:32] hidden a field
[1:36:34] is hid lord
[1:36:37] and that man went and bought that whole
[1:36:40] field
[1:36:41] we exhorted tonight
[1:36:43] to go by
[1:36:45] that field
[1:36:48] god made that treasure
[1:36:50] that treasure coming eating vessels here
[1:36:53] tonight
[1:36:54] fill them with your presence lord
[1:36:57] fill them with your love and power
[1:36:59] and may you pour your spirit and
[1:37:00] especially upon them

[1:37:18] maybe something like another day of
