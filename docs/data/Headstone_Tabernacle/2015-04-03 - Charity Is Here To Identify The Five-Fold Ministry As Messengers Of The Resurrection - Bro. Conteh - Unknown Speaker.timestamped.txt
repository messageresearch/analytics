[5:26] the I'm so excited tonight
[5:30] to know that the spirit of God is
[5:34] moving I want to thank all the brothers
[5:36] thank the
[5:38] convention bring greetings to
[5:40] you from the little flock back in freet
[5:43] town the grace of God has been with us
[5:47] there and your
[5:49] prayers was a mighty
[5:54] force your prayers for us proved very
[5:57] effective
[6:00] God stood by
[6:02] us and we thank God for his
[6:05] grace so to me it was a
[6:09] training for this
[6:12] season God has to prove his
[6:15] word we in a real season
[6:19] church and I came here with a
[6:24] heavy before the year ends last year
[6:29] the watch night towards the year of this
[6:34] year believe the voice of God spoke to
[6:36] my heart
[6:40] clearly strong
[6:43] voice the season we are in
[6:49] 2015 and my heart still beat towards
[6:55] that but this year 2015
[6:59] a key is going to
[7:06] be faith is
[7:09] Anointed to believe
[7:11] tonight that ke can be turned in
[7:15] Co if you can believe
[7:18] that you can't have
[7:20] faith by just reading the
[7:24] word the third
[7:26] pool was to connect the bride
[7:30] to voice
[7:32] words bring us back to
[7:35] L somebody say Amen to that the voice of
[7:39] God will come back to the
[7:41] church like it was in
[7:44] Eden where Adam and Eve had the ability
[7:49] to hear from God they did not have a
[7:51] written
[7:53] bible the voice of God come to them
[7:57] somebody say Amen to that praise God
[8:01] Amen like the
[8:03] prophets of
[8:05] old have Bible like
[8:08] this but they had the
[8:10] ability to hear the voice of God and
[8:14] that is your
[8:15] promise because it takes the voice of
[8:18] God to bring forth a
[8:21] manifestation until God
[8:24] speaks there cannot be a
[8:27] manifestation so therefore tonight
[8:30] we going to be raised up into the next
[8:34] level like said this
[8:37] morning that God will send another
[8:41] comforter the word gave them a measure
[8:44] of
[8:46] comfort that was all right but there was
[8:50] another
[8:51] comforter that comforter is called
[8:55] Dynamic the voice of God so the voice of
[8:59] God came
[9:03] hallelujah praise God
[9:05] Amen you have two types of word in the
[9:09] Bible you have the written
[9:12] word written
[9:14] seal then you have seven
[9:17] Thunders that's not
[9:20] written so which one do you
[9:23] want when the bride goes over
[9:29] this Bible becomes a
[9:32] voice and that gives you
[9:34] Faith so therefore tonight the voice of
[9:38] God will speak to your hearts that you
[9:42] are here the voice of God will speak to
[9:45] your heart that you receive the Holy
[9:48] Ghost voice of God will speak to your
[9:51] heart Hallelujah it has got to be a
[9:56] voice it can't come any other way
[10:01] intellectualism has killed the
[10:04] message but God is raising up a fful
[10:08] Ministry a people with the
[10:12] ability to hear from
[10:15] God said this Omega bride will have the
[10:20] Lord or she keeps
[10:23] still so but we cannot keep
[10:26] Ste because the voice of God is moving
[10:29] that is your promise for
[10:31] tonight th the Lord we keep still so we
[10:36] are coming to the
[10:38] season you can only speak for
[10:41] God because the mouth
[10:45] of is going to be put into the mouth of
[10:47] the fal
[10:49] Ministry the fal ministry will speak for
[10:53] God hallelujah praise God that is my
[10:57] burden that's where I'm heading for
[11:00] because I came from logos I'm going back
[11:03] to logos you came from logos we going
[11:07] back to Lo and nothing can stop that
[11:09] praise Hallelujah so therefore tonight

[11:16] position to be able to hear the voice of
[11:20] God the voice of God is coming tonight
[11:23] God is going to speak tonight somebody
[11:26] say Amen tonight praise God hallelujah
[11:29] we are not
[11:31] de God gave us
[11:34] here the Bible say to him that hear Let
[11:40] Him hear what the spirit is saying but
[11:43] thank you tonight that we have the
[11:46] ability to hear from
[11:49] God the Lord you shall be seal you shall

[19:25] title charity is here
[19:29] to identify the Bible
[19:31] ministry as messengers of the
[19:35] Resurrection that's our
[19:37] burden I believe the next move of the
[19:42] spirit bring will will will is to bring
[19:44] the F Ministry on the
[19:49] SC because you can't get nowhere as you
[19:52] are
[19:55] now except by a Ministry
[20:00] somebody say Amen to that
[20:02] church for all these
[20:04] years you have been
[20:07] trained how to operate a
[20:11] Revival because a Revival
[20:15] signifies a move of God in
[20:18] power but you have been
[20:21] trained how to get the best out of your
[20:27] Revival like God has to also train
[20:31] men say God cannot send a
[20:35] Revival God men a
[20:39] train not in the School of
[20:42] Theology but they trained in God's R
[20:45] School of
[20:48] training they know who God
[20:50] is they know God

[21:08] hallelujah praise God they understand
[21:11] that amen amen so this has been a
[21:15] prayer amen Build Me Up Lord into
[21:19] this let Christ be my
[21:22] head this is my prayer as a

[22:03] revealed faith is not flow out faith
[22:07] comes by
[22:08] Revelation somebody say Amen Fai has got
[22:11] to be revealed amen
[22:14] hallelujah praise God Amen now reveal
[22:19] Faith reveal faith is a faith that opens
[22:23] your
[22:25] understanding to understand the
[22:27] scriptures
[22:29] reveal
[22:30] faith will help you
[22:33] recognize it helps you to
[22:36] align your
[22:38] inside with your
[22:41] outside Jesus came back 4 days he opened
[22:46] their
[22:47] understanding but the understanding was
[22:51] to understand
[22:53] scripture to understand what is
[22:56] written but the
[22:59] understanding was Jesus making events
[23:02] clear by prophecy in other words it was
[23:07] a
[23:08] revelation it was a type of
[23:11] faith that makes you see what God is
[23:13] [Music]
[23:15] saying that means Jesus was able to
[23:19] align events with
[23:23] proy
[23:25] saw then they saw that the death of
[23:27] Jesus on the
[23:30] was
[23:31] prophecy they saw the resurrection of
[23:34] Jesus was
[23:36] prophecy he aligned the
[23:40] events of that day with
[23:43] prophecy then their understanding open
[23:47] up so this is
[23:50] 2015 where where are we
[23:53] at are we in the
[23:55] bride now what has God done
[23:59] as a bride of Jesus
[24:01] Christ since
[24:04] 1965 where the went to be with the
[24:08] Lord can we say nothing has
[24:11] happened or something has
[24:14] happened when I believe something has
[24:17] happened praise God
[24:19] hallelujah because I am here I am an
[24:24] event of Prophecy I did not just appear
[24:29] I
[24:30] Ament you
[24:33] are you
[24:36] are of
[24:38] Prophecy you did not just
[24:40] come we did not just
[24:43] appear came according to
[24:46] prophecy you've got to see that to be
[24:49] able to receive the Holy Ghost You' come
[24:53] to see that to be able to be seen
[24:56] tonight you did not just come
[24:59] man did not bring you
[25:01] here brother not bring you
[25:04] here God brought you
[25:06] here the Holy Ghost brought you here
[25:10] you've got to understand that shout
[25:13] amen hallelujah praise God
[25:18] Amen so
[25:20] Jesus 30 days was aligning
[25:25] events of that day with
[25:28] prophecy because the confusion was these
[25:32] guys were
[25:33] Believers but they don't have revealed
[25:36] Faith they had faith in
[25:39] Jesus Peter had faith in
[25:41] Christ Peter said thou are the
[25:44] Christ there was a revelation but it was
[25:47] not a revealed
[25:50] Faith because it did not understand the
[25:54] scriptures praise God
[25:56] hallelujah they could not see the
[25:57] scripture in
[25:59] action so on the third day of the
[26:02] Resurrection they were walking
[26:05] around and they were
[26:07] complaining how there was a man that was
[26:09] supposed to be called
[26:12] Jesus how this man said thought he
[26:14] should res
[26:17] again they did not
[26:19] know that Jesus Christ had already
[26:22] died they did not
[26:24] know exactly where they were at
[26:28] did not know that we are almost in the
[26:30] land of
[26:32] Charity
[26:34] Hallelujah they did not know that the
[26:37] Holy Ghost was about to
[26:39] fall they did not know that charity was
[26:44] only 10 days
[26:47] away praise God
[26:50] Amen can you imagine
[26:52] that
[26:54] charity was only 10 days away
[26:58] and they did not know where they were
[27:01] at they were still asking
[27:04] questions this man said rise
[27:06] again and today is the third
[27:09] day nothing has happened then Jesus
[27:12] Christ was working with
[27:14] them the Bible says their eyes
[27:17] with that they should not know
[27:20] him thank God tonight your eyes are not
[27:24] withhold you will know Jesus because I
[27:28] know
[27:29] charity the spirit of God is hanging
[27:32] over you right
[27:34] now charity is not far from
[27:38] you charity is close to your
[27:44] heart that's how I feel
[27:47] tonight praise God
[27:53] hallelujah can you believe
[27:55] that charity
[27:58] this great promise of
[28:00] God that they were looking for was only
[28:03] 10 days
[28:06] away and they were still
[28:09] confused don't know where they are
[28:11] at don't know their
[28:14] position Jesus was walking with them but
[28:18] they could not see
[28:19] Jesus Faith was not revealed then Jesus
[28:23] Christ had to Blas
[28:24] them say oh ye fools
[28:28] and St to
[28:30] believe all that the prophets have
[28:33] said and he began to expound the
[28:36] scriptures he began to open their
[28:39] understanding that they must understand
[28:41] the
[28:42] scriptures he to align the effect of the
[28:45] day they might know where
[28:49] they praise God let their eyes
[28:53] open let their understanding open
[28:58] breath on
[28:59] them receive the Holy
[29:02] Ghost then they were are
[29:04] placed under the
[29:07] atmosphere of the Holy Ghost that is
[29:10] what I came to do to place you under the
[29:16] atmosphere of the Holy Ghost because the
[29:19] Holy Ghost is close to you you shall be
[29:24] seal you shall be healed young people
[29:29] your day is come your season is come
[29:33] hallelujah praise
[29:40] God very
[29:42] important there
[29:46] important so outside of that
[29:52] understanding they could not have been
[29:54] placed in a position
[29:58] to believe for
[30:00] charity because if they kept
[30:04] believing that Jesus Christ had
[30:07] died and he did not
[30:09] rise how could he have
[30:11] faith to bring down the Holy
[30:14] Ghost so in meetings like
[30:17] this you just don't come
[30:19] here you came here to receive something
[30:22] from
[30:23] God but you have to be in a
[30:26] position you have to know who you are
[30:29] you have to understand your
[30:31] place you are not a Pentecostal
[30:34] chicken you are God's
[30:37] e you are anointed for the

[38:55] to you
[38:58] said if you God's Bride for this
[39:02] day you came straight from elohim's
[39:08] thought God has you know these
[39:11] things if your faith is not
[39:14] anointed you can believe
[39:16] that you just you just explain
[39:20] intellect so that's where the voice
[39:22] comes
[39:24] in the faith has got to be anointed
[39:28] so believe I came from
[39:33] Elohim you by
[39:36] your you byass the
[39:39] logos now the
[39:41] L is also called voice
[39:45] world when elohim's attribute elohim's
[39:49] thought when God expressed his
[39:52] thought God materialized himself into
[39:56] voice words
[39:59] the L is not written
[40:02] word that was God's written bible up in
[40:07] heaven word
[40:11] [Music]
[40:13] in when God
[40:15] speaks it goes as a voice because your
[40:19] word is a
[40:20] voice your voice is a
[40:23] word your voice carries a words
[40:31] spoke it went out as a
[40:34] voice the voice of God so John one man
[40:42] reads the word there is
[40:45] logos but to make it really
[40:49] Spirit you have to call that logos voice
[40:54] word so you know it is not just written
[40:59] it's God's
[41:01] voice
[41:04] that's
[41:06] beginning before God created
[41:09] angels before there was a
[41:12] demon this was how you
[41:14] began Elohim became
[41:20] voice then God expressed you as a word
[41:28] Lo
[41:30] that's the seven
[41:32] thund of
[41:34] Revelation they utter their
[41:37] voices where did those voices
[41:40] go they did not go into the
[41:44] Aires went back
[41:48] toos seal those
[41:50] voices into the
[41:53] word that is why you have to find the
[41:56] seven th back in the
[42:00] world voice is slided back into the
[42:04] world but those seven
[42:07] voices that was God expressing your name

[52:12] an you did not come
[52:15] from you came from
[52:17] El you came
[52:22] fromom Hallelujah
[52:24] [Music]
[52:29] so that
[52:31] service he went to the
[52:34] meetings he said his
[52:37] wife and I was just preaching the word
[52:41] he had a gift of
[52:43] prayer it was a
[52:45] mystery that when he
[52:47] prayed something
[52:49] happened there was a
[52:52] mystery others can
[52:54] pray hours and hours and
[52:58] hours
[53:00] Happ but most
[53:02] times when the answer
[53:05] comes emphasize how much we
[53:09] pray we keep talking if I didn't
[53:15] happen we emphas the first
[53:19] thing I fasted 21
[53:24] days you don't see others have also
[53:27] faster than
[53:30] you and they get
[53:32] nothing so we are not really
[53:36] conscious of this hidden
[53:39] Mystery that lay inside of
[53:42] you the Bible said he said a good
[53:47] man out of the good Treasure of his
[53:51] heart bring for good
[53:54] things and an evil man
[53:58] evil of his heart bring it
[54:01] for everything is inside
[54:06] of so
[54:08] Revelation is not God telling you things
[54:11] that you don't
[54:13] have you can't believe in what you don't
[54:18] have
[54:19] Revelation help to
[54:22] recognize what you have inside of you
[54:27] what
[54:29] is
[54:31] ration makes you
[54:33] recognize what God has done inside of
[54:37] you you come to these
[54:39] meetings you
[54:41] recognize I'm a Son of God I'm a Child
[54:45] of
[54:46] God God has to give the Holy
[54:49] Ghost I'm going to be
[54:52] healed to recognize
[54:54] that that is what call reveal
[55:06] [Applause]
[55:08] [Music]
[55:12] face
[55:14] Glory so therefore when
[55:18] Falls it will fall as the father's
[55:24] kindness the kindness
[55:28] that's your part
[55:31] nature the
[55:33] pyamid you see all those
[55:36] seven they all had the nature of
[55:40] God that was God dividing his
[55:44] nature seven Church
[55:47] ages but God took back those
[55:51] natures and put it back into the Holy
[55:54] Spirit
[55:56] making God's
[55:59] nature in agreement with his
[56:03] mind what we
[56:06] Byers
[56:07] our is not in agreement with our
[56:12] mind that makes it hard to have
[56:15] [Music]
[56:18] faith because if your
[56:20] mind is not in agreement with your
[56:24] nature you find it had to
[56:27] believe so you have to come back to that
[56:31] order where your mind
[56:35] runs in the dire of your
[56:38] faith which is in your
[56:41] soul then God backs that
[56:44] up so you have the SE of God in your
[56:48] soul but the devil messed up your
[56:52] mind because he knew before 21
[56:57] when God will save you he must have
[57:00] messed up your
[57:02] mind with Fallen Angel
[57:07] Spirits messed up your
[57:10] emotions you don't feel
[57:13] good you feel
[57:16] oppressed when there supposed to be a SE
[57:18] of God in
[57:22] you when the Bible says we're raised up
[57:24] in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus
[57:28] we raised above
[57:31] principalities they supposed to be
[57:33] feeling good and
[57:36] high but your
[57:38] emotions are so messed
[57:41] up you are feeling
[57:44] bad you feel
[57:46] oppressed and the devil through the
[57:49] years has allowed your
[57:52] emotions to dictate your thinking
[57:57] so it makes you think in accordance with
[57:59] your
[58:03] emotions that is how you
[58:06] talk so when your emotions tells you
[58:09] you're
[58:10] sick because you feel
[58:13] sick and your emotions that
[58:17] feeling of malaria or
[58:20] diabetes that
[58:23] feeling prod a thinking in you
[58:27] that when I feel this
[58:30] way it means I am
[58:32] sick then you say I am
[58:36] sick but that is not
[58:38] true your
[58:41] emotions are not supposed to dictate
[58:43] your
[58:46] thinking because you are Elohim
[58:49] thought you're supposed to think like
[58:53] eloh El says
[58:56] by SCP you we are
[58:58] healed that's how to
[59:01] think hallelujah praise God Elohim says
[59:07] there's nothing against
[59:08] you that of things El says your name is
[59:14] in the
[59:16] Eternal and under no
[59:22] circumstance that is how to think
[59:26] you don't have to think the other way
[59:29] around so the
[59:31] devil has worked on our
[59:35] [Music]
[59:36] mind because before we got
[59:40] saved we had no fight in our
[59:44] minds ours was a
[59:49] man so while you
[59:53] sleep when you were in a sleep mode
[59:57] sleep for lack of
[1:00:02] Revelation the devil came
[1:00:08] and and after God has woken you
[1:00:11] up you just realizing
[1:00:15] now that the enemy has s bad in your
[1:00:20] mind there some wrong in your
[1:00:23] mind messed up your emotions
[1:00:29] people tell you Pastor I am
[1:00:33] depressed I am
[1:00:35] depressed you are not
[1:00:38] depressed you are not
[1:00:41] oppressed because your
[1:00:44] feelings feelings of
[1:00:46] Oppression has dictated your
[1:00:50] thinking you are not supposed to
[1:00:53] think like a depressed person
[1:00:58] because you are not
[1:01:00] depressed hallelujah
[1:01:03] hallelujah you are not
[1:01:06] depressed you're free you're supposed to
[1:01:09] be happy you're supposed to receive
[1:01:18] Jo hallelujah hallelujah praise God
[1:01:22] hallelujah huj so we think
[1:01:26] in line with our
[1:01:30] emotions if we have if we have negative
[1:01:33] about the
[1:01:36] brother we allow our feelings to tell
[1:01:39] us that something else wrong with the
[1:01:44] brother we judge
[1:01:47] people by the way we feel about
[1:01:53] them you can just be my feelings
[1:01:57] those you feel good
[1:02:00] about to you the good
[1:02:03] people and those feel bad
[1:02:09] about because your
[1:02:12] feelings controls your
[1:02:15] thinking for me my
