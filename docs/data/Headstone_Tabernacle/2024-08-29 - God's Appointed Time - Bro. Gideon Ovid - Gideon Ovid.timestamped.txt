[36:38] Lord Lord I pray that revelation will
[36:40] come down and you will Lord Minister
[36:42] unto your people gathered here tonight

[37:11] careful to give you all the praise honor
[37:12] and glory in Jesus name we pray amen you
[37:16] may have your seats at this
[37:18] time amen blessed be the name of the
[37:22] Lord
[37:25] hallelujah we read that scripture about
[37:27] time and seasons and purpose and the the
[37:32] title tonight is God's appointed time so
[37:35] we're going to speak a little bit about
[37:37] time tonight and we want to take our
[37:39] time to do so amen now I just want to
[37:42] start simply by
[37:44] saying as we as we put a context to it
[37:48] that God's time is perfect he doesn't
[37:51] make mistakes he doesn't have accidents
[37:53] he doesn't have mishaps he doesn't have
[37:55] things that are out of his will and out
[37:58] of his plan because he is
[38:01] God time doesn't wait on anybody it
[38:05] doesn't stop it doesn't need you or me
[38:07] it doesn't depend on us it doesn't
[38:09] matter our opinion time is time it
[38:12] doesn't stop for us it doesn't pause or
[38:15] slow down or speed up even if your
[38:18] battery and your clock fails time
[38:20] continues it doesn't matter where you
[38:22] are time still rolls on even if you
[38:25] don't believe it or you deny it
[38:28] time is Time and Time continues it might
[38:31] feel like it's moving slow but you can't
[38:33] slow it down sometime it appears to be
[38:36] running away you'll say the time is
[38:38] moving so quickly but that doesn't
[38:41] depend on you your belief doesn't
[38:44] influence it that's good that's good
[38:46] there is always an appointed time and
[38:48] God always has a time appointed to
[38:52] achieve his purpose and to achieve his
[38:54] will amen and that applies to your life
[38:57] in every aspect no matter how you feel
[39:00] tonight whether you were tired coming
[39:02] here tonight whether it's Montana and
[39:04] you have bills du it still is time that
[39:08] God has set aside to meet with you
[39:10] tonight nothing happens by chance so
[39:13] even people that are looking at this
[39:14] right now it's your opportunity to hear
[39:17] this right now he has selected this time
[39:20] for you to hear it amen he has
[39:22] predestinated you for this time amen you
[39:26] know some in school a a a student may go
[39:30] whe whether standard one or form one or
[39:32] what whatever grade or whatever stage
[39:34] and you feel like it's a long journey
[39:36] it's a long process the beauty about
[39:38] school is that there's a very specific
[39:41] time that's appointed beforehand for the
[39:43] test to come exam time be it end of term
[39:48] end of year end of the period so in in
[39:51] in in our context here we may have CXC
[39:53] or Cc or something like that after form
[39:55] five that time that doesn't change if
[39:58] the teacher stays home it doesn't change
[40:01] if there's a holiday or or school over
[40:03] early it doesn't change the exam date
[40:06] the exam date Remains the Same because
[40:08] that is the time appointed for exams
[40:11] that's the time in which you'll be
[40:12] tested on whatever you were supposed to
[40:14] learn it's just like with God he selects
[40:18] his time in advance the difference is he
[40:20] doesn't tell you when the exam coming
[40:23] exam could be tonight exam could be
[40:25] tomorrow it could be next year there
[40:27] could be next month but one thing for
[40:29] certain is that it's coming you're going
[40:32] to be tested you're going to be tried
[40:34] and we'll see it he said he never
[40:36] promised to make it easy he never
[40:38] promised that it'll be a bed roses but
[40:41] he promised that you'll be victorious he
[40:43] promised that you'll overcome he
[40:45] promised that you're more than a
[40:46] conqueror that whenever that time comes
[40:49] his word will not return void and he
[40:52] will fulfill his purpose that he has set
[40:55] forth for you amen
[40:57] amen so he always operates with a
[41:00] purpose in mind he doesn't do things by
[41:02] chance it is not random or haphazard not
[41:04] viky VI and he didn't come to call a
[41:07] group he came for individuals so you'll
[41:10] be tested as individuals he's calling
[41:13] individuals he didn't call you out of
[41:16] leysia into the bride age to just leave
[41:18] you there he didn't just call you for
[41:20] calling your sake he called you out for
[41:23] a purpose he didn't just bring you out
[41:25] to the Methodist Church and the Baptist
[41:26] Church the Anglican and Catholic church
[41:29] and wherever you came from to put you
[41:30] into another denomination no no no no no
[41:33] no no he called you out with a specific
[41:35] purpose and he has an appointed time for
[41:38] you to become a manifested son and
[41:41] daughter of God to prove to the devil
[41:44] that you're not like Eve that's his
[41:46] purpose that's his plan
[41:49] amen now if I were look in in in in the
[41:52] Book of Genesis Chapter 18 and you're
[41:55] familiar with the scripture because we
[41:56] talking about abraam abam from verse 10
[41:59] it said and he said I will certainly
[42:01] return unto thee according to the time
[42:04] of life and lo Sarah thy wife shall have
[42:07] a son Sarah heard it in the T door which
[42:11] was behind him now Abraham and Sarah
[42:13] were old and well stricken in age and it
[42:16] ceased to be with Sarah after the manner
[42:18] of woman therefore Sarah laughed within
[42:20] herself saying after I am waxed old
[42:23] shall I have pleasure my Lord being old
[42:25] also and the Lord said unto Abraham
[42:29] wherefore did Sarah laugh saying shall I
[42:32] shorty bear a child which I'm
[42:35] old and in verse 14 he says is anything
[42:39] too hard for the Lord at the time
[42:42] appointed I will return unto thee
[42:45] according to the time of life and Sarah
[42:47] shall have a
[42:48] son so I want to tell you that when God
[42:51] visited Abraham and told him you'd have
[42:53] a son by Sarah his wife God dropped time
[42:56] on him that was a promise when God
[42:58] leaves a promise for you he drops time
[43:01] like a time capsule he just leaves it
[43:03] there and walks away because he knows if
[43:05] he made the promise he is more than able
[43:08] to bring it to pass whether you believe
[43:10] it whether you clap tonight whether you
[43:13] say Amen his promise is his promise and
[43:16] it will be achieved
[43:18] amen now in a message the junction of
[43:22] time I just want
[43:24] to want to want to put this here he said
[43:27] when in paragraph 68 he said when lot
[43:31] and Abraham another time when Abraham
[43:33] was to be the ruler of the world his
[43:35] seed was to scatter over the Earth so
[43:37] this later on he had lot his nephew with
[43:40] him which was a relative as we know and
[43:42] what a beautiful picture today of the
[43:44] cold formal indifferent Church to the
[43:47] spirit born elected called out separated
[43:50] Church of the Living God so that's the
[43:52] contrast we have there Abraham and
[43:55] lot they dwell together on the same
[43:57] plane but it finally come to a time
[43:59] where lot took his great group and went
[44:01] down into Sodom and Gomorrah where
[44:03] they'd be popular where they' take a
[44:05] choice of the land and Abraham stayed in
[44:07] the will of God and took the poor of the
[44:09] land Sarah his beautiful wife and
[44:11] Abraham stayed on the pore of the ground
[44:14] in order that they could serve the Lord
[44:16] God doesn't promise listen he doesn't
[44:19] promise a flower bed of ease don't
[44:22] falsify a Christian and don't falsify
[44:25] the message by telling them that
[44:27] everything is going to be all right
[44:29] there's nothing going to harm you don't
[44:31] tell them that there's nothing going to
[44:33] ain't no trials or nothing don't tell
[44:35] them that that's wrong as a poet said
[44:37] must I be carried on to heaven on a
[44:39] flower bed of ease While others fought
[44:41] to win the prize and sail through bloody
[44:43] seeds no sir God doesn't promise ease
[44:46] and prosperity this is not Prosperity
[44:48] Gospel tonight this is not just a jump
[44:50] and shout and shout hallelujah and you
[44:53] go back home no no no this is the word
[44:55] of God he promised Grace to endure in
[44:58] every time is the grace that we look to
[45:00] that's what you need to overcome to be
[45:03] able to accomplish that that that he set
[45:05] out to you amen so when God gives a
[45:08] promise and he sets a plan in motion he
[45:10] drops time on it I want you to remember
[45:12] that he drops time on it at that point
[45:16] nothing could stop it no word no
[45:20] necromancy no obia nobody say and I I
[45:23] don't feel that that I don't feel like
[45:25] work out to know I tell you if somebody
[45:27] tell you it don't feel like it that's
[45:29] one sure sign that God probably made
[45:31] that promise because if man could
[45:34] understand that you don't need Faith you
[45:36] could just do it of your own accord amen
[45:39] so I just want to quickly look at Noah
[45:41] in Genesis 6 verse 6 and it says and it
[45:45] repented the Lord and you know it that
[45:47] he made man on the earth and it grieved
[45:49] him at his heart so God was upset he
[45:52] couldn't believe that man had become so
[45:55] evil and in verse 7 said and the Lord
[45:57] said I will destroy man whom I have
[45:59] created from the face of the Earth both
[46:01] man and Beast and the creeping thing and
[46:04] the fowls of the air for it repented me
[46:05] that I have made them but Noah found
[46:08] Grace in the eyes of the Lord so it
[46:11] doesn't matter if a thousand on your
[46:13] right side or 10,000 you could find
[46:15] Grace in the eyes of the Lord you could
[46:17] live a life pleasing to God it doesn't
[46:20] matter what your wife think or your
[46:21] neighbor think or your boss says about
[46:23] you you can have a testimony that you
[46:26] please God Amen that was Noah's
[46:29] testimony tonight and in verse 9 he said
[46:32] these are the generations of Noah he was
[46:34] just a man and perfect in his
[46:37] generations and he walked with God who
[46:40] do you walk with
[46:41] tonight who are you walking with tonight
[46:44] are you walking with the radio walking
[46:47] with a book or magazine who you walking
[46:49] with they say he walked with God and in
[46:52] verse 10 he begat Three Sons Shem ham
[46:55] and jaffet
[46:57] the Earth was corrupt before God and the
[47:00] Earth was filled with violence and God
[47:02] looked upon the Earth and behold it was
[47:04] corrupt for All Flesh had corrupted his
[47:06] way upon the Earth and God said unto
[47:09] Noah the end of All Flesh is come before
[47:11] me for the Earth is filled with violence
[47:14] through them and behold I will destroy
[47:16] them with the earth now I'm here to tell
[47:19] you that when God told Noah his plans to
[47:24] destroy the people of the Earth God
[47:27] dropped time on that
[47:30] promise he made the promise and he
[47:32] dropped time no I going to destroy
[47:34] everything I'm upset I'm vexed I can't
[47:36] believe the violence he dropped time and
[47:38] he walked
[47:39] away the rain was coming whether Noah's
[47:43] family believed it or not whether it
[47:47] took 10 years or 120 years it was coming
[47:51] at the time appointed in the message of
[47:54] statue of a perfect man paragraph 250 1
[47:57] he said speaking of Noah Prophet said he
[48:00] had
[48:01] patience cuz he had Faith yes sir he had
[48:05] virtue he had knowledge that God was
[48:08] right he had Temperance he didn't fly
[48:10] loose say well I don't know what it's
[48:12] all about I've lost my popularity out
[48:15] there no no people don't care for me no
[48:17] more I'll go out there and start all
[48:19] over New again no no he had patience God
[48:22] promised God will do it God will do it
[48:25] cuz God said so
[48:27] what has he said about you tonight God
[48:29] said so and I could see his son coming
[48:32] around and say dad you know stroke his
[48:35] hand over his long gray hair you know
[48:38] and he was hundreds of years
[48:40] old you know sitting there said I know
[48:43] you're a old
[48:47] patriarch that sounds like a compliment
[48:49] to
[48:50] me you know Dad I know you're old and
[48:54] responsible and you are the head of the
[48:56] house and the family and we look up to
[48:58] you and we respect you I love you
[49:02] Daddy but could it been possible that
[49:05] you could have been a little bit wrong
[49:07] oh no no no no no why God said so well
[49:12] Daddy this is six days that we sit up
[49:14] here and and you know the door closed
[49:16] and and everything exciting is going on
[49:18] outside that we can't
[49:21] see at the end of the day his Fai was
[49:25] pegged and pitched on the fact that God
[49:27] said so and if God made a promise to him
[49:30] God just Dro time on it am just drop
[49:33] time on
[49:35] it setting up there with his big old dry
[49:38] Ark sitting right there it's all pitch
[49:41] inside and out
[49:43] and we've been all these years building
[49:45] on it and you stood out there and preach
[49:47] till you turned gray and bald and here
[49:50] you are up here now trying to say such
[49:52] and such a thing and the people are
[49:53] laughing and throwing Rotten Tomatoes
[49:55] and things against the s of it look
[49:57] there what you're doing why you know be
[50:00] patient son that's Noah's encouragement
[50:03] be patient son amen sometimes the vision
[50:07] might take
[50:08] longtime the promise don't unfold just
[50:10] yet but be patient son God dropped time
[50:14] on it it must come to pass be
[50:18] patient he went on he said are you
[50:23] sure it will rain his daughter in law
[50:27] said father you know it will rain but
[50:29] we've been all these years waiting we've
[50:32] been preparing and you told us it's
[50:34] going to rain a week ago and we were in
[50:37] here and the doors are all shut and here
[50:40] we are walking around in here and the
[50:42] the sun just scorching right down like
[50:43] it was but it'll rain how do you know
[50:48] God said
[50:50] so now when you get that way add it but
[50:54] if you ain't got it that way don't don't
[50:56] try at it it won't work it won't work on
[50:59] healing it won't work on nothing else
[51:01] see it's got to blending with the
[51:03] materialist vulcanized to that's right
[51:06] got to add it patience with God's
[51:08] promise yes sir Noah believed it and he
[51:11] had patience with God 120 years which is
[51:15] why when God give him the plans to
[51:17] destroy the people of the earth God just
[51:20] dropped time on it
[51:24] am although 120 years
[51:27] pass that was time God dropped that on
[51:32] it in the Book of Genesis chapter
[51:35] 37 speaking of
[51:38] Joseph he said in verse 27 come let us
[51:42] sell him to the
[51:45] Israelites and let not our hand be upon
[51:48] him because the brothers didn't want to
[51:49] kill him let's sell him into slavery for
[51:53] he's our brother and our flesh and his
[51:55] Brethren will content that sound like a
[51:57] good idea sometimes you try to
[52:00] rationalize it and you figure it out and
[52:01] you think you know what I have the
[52:03] answer I don't want to be coming across
[52:06] too bad so I will do this or I will go
[52:10] here instead or I'll do it my way he
[52:13] said in verse 28 then there passed by
[52:16] midianites merchantmen and they drew and
[52:18] lifted up Joseph out of the pit and sold
[52:21] Joseph to the Israelites for 20 pieces
[52:23] of silver and they brought Joseph into
[52:26] Egypt Egypt you know what the brothers
[52:27] didn't know when you look at Joseph when
[52:31] the brothers dropped him in the well and
[52:32] sold him into slavery the clock
[52:37] started God dropped time on it because
[52:41] God knew this is where I want him and
[52:43] this is the beginning this is his season
[52:46] here this is where his Journey Begins
[52:48] not in his father's house in Egypt
[52:51] because it was just a matter of time for
[52:54] him to become a ruler in Egypt but he
[52:57] couldn't be a ruler in Egypt in his
[52:58] father's house so when he reached in
[53:00] there and he was sold God just dropped
[53:02] time on it and watch it watch that
[53:06] promise unfold and manifest
[53:09] itself in Psalms
[53:12] 105 verse 17 it says he sent a man
[53:16] before them even Joseph who was sold for
[53:19] a servant whose feet they hurt with
[53:21] feets he was laid in Iron until the time
[53:24] that his word came the word of the Lord
[53:26] Tried Him the king sent and loosed him
[53:30] even the ruler of the people and let him
[53:32] go free he made him Lord of his house
[53:36] ruler of all his substance and verse 22
[53:39] to bind his princes at his pleasure and
[53:42] teach his Senators
[53:44] wisdom this is the the byproduct of the
[53:48] timing of God when God has an appointed
[53:51] time or a time appointed for you there
[53:54] is nothing that could hinder that that
[53:56] that that process nothing could stop the
[53:58] journey it might seem long it might seem
[54:01] slow it may seem outside of what you
[54:04] think it should be your mind may not
[54:06] even conceive the journey itself but
[54:10] once God dropped time on it it's over
[54:13] it's over if you could only get a
[54:15] revelation of that that you may feel
[54:18] down tonight you may feel like I've been
[54:20] burden for so long I've been crying out
[54:22] for my children for so long I'm looking
[54:24] for a breakthrough for so long I've been
[54:26] calling out I've been crying out I want
[54:28] to be filled I want to be healed I want
[54:31] to be delivered this sickness has bound
[54:33] my body for so long but God dropped time
[54:36] on it and when that time is up it's like
[54:40] an alarm nothing could cause the alarm
[54:43] to stop nobody could change the time
[54:47] time is only God Alone could adjust that
[54:51] only God Alone could fix that once the
[54:54] time is set the judge J M is sure the
[54:57] outcome is perfect nothing could stop
[55:01] [Music]
[55:06] [Applause]
[55:07] it switching quickly in the Book of
[55:10] Judges I know it's a lot of
[55:12] scriptures but in Judges chapter 16
[55:16] verse 21 speaking of
[55:20] Samson it says the Philistines and we
[55:22] know we know the story with Delilah but
[55:25] in this case this was was
[55:27] after the Philistines took him verse 21
[55:30] put out his eyes brought him down to
[55:33] Gaza and bound him with feets of brass
[55:36] and he did grind in the prison
[55:38] house listen to verse 22 very very
[55:42] significant verse it says how be it the
[55:46] hair of his head began to grow again
[55:50] after he was
[55:52] shaven from the time they cut his hair
[55:55] God dropped time on it amen was just a
[55:57] matter of time before his hair grew out
[56:00] again it didn't matter if they laugh if
[56:03] they make Sports if they talk about him
[56:06] if they write an autobiography God had
[56:08] already placed his time and once that
[56:11] time run out it's almost like I forgot
[56:14] what it's called you know there's a
[56:15] little time clock with sand falling and
[56:18] the sand will fall fall fall fall and
[56:20] when it's empty at the top time is up
[56:23] once every grain Has Fallen yeah there
[56:27] is no no no object no element no body
[56:31] external that could change the outcome
[56:33] of that the time is over it has elapsed
[56:36] there is no more space there there there
[56:39] is no more room to change he that is
[56:42] filthy is filthy still he that is Holy
[56:44] is Holy still he that is righteous is
[56:47] righteous still because time has elapsed
[56:50] and you have reached the appointed time
[56:52] that God has set before the foundation
[56:54] of the Earth
[56:56] Amen in verse 23 it says then the Lords
[56:59] of the Philistines gathered them
[57:01] together for to offer a great sacrifice
[57:04] on to dig on their God and to Rejoice so
[57:06] they wanted to have a
[57:07] party wanted to gather and rejoice for
[57:10] they said our God had delivered Samson
[57:13] our enemy in into our hands what they
[57:16] didn't realize is that from the moment
[57:18] they cut his hair God dropped time on it
[57:21] and he sent him inside like a secret
[57:24] agent
[57:26] inside the enemy's Camp he said imagine
[57:30] we want to have a party because we've
[57:32] captured and listen listen listen what
[57:35] it say our God Deon has delivered Samson
[57:39] our enemy into our hands Hallelujah you
[57:42] see how perspective could be skewed
[57:44] they're not seeing that God Almighty
[57:47] took Samson and put him in the midst of
[57:50] the enemy's
[57:52] camp in verse 24 when the people saw him
[57:55] they praised their God for they said our
[57:58] God had delivered into our hands our
[58:00] enemy and the destroyer of our country
[58:03] which slew many of us you remember he
[58:05] took the Jawbone of a donkey a brittle
[58:07] bone and he killed a thousand
[58:10] Philistines with steel
[58:13] helmets in verse 25 it came to pass when
[58:16] their hearts were merry that they said
[58:19] call for
[58:20] Samson that he may make a spot and they
[58:24] call for Samson out of the prison house
[58:26] and he made them Sport and they set him
[58:28] between the
[58:30] pillars talk about put him in putting
[58:32] him in the right place between the
[58:35] pillars they put
[58:36] him reminds me of Jesus has often said
[58:40] if if Satan only knew that the blood
[58:43] will make the difference they never
[58:44] crucify him if the Philistines only knew
[58:48] that putting Samson between the pillars
[58:51] would have been the demise of all of
[58:52] them they never put him there
[58:57] and Samson said unto the lad that held
[58:59] him by the hand suffer me that I may
[59:02] feel the pillars where upon the house
[59:04] standards I don't want any post any
[59:06] random pillar I want the loadbearing
[59:09] walls I want the ones that holding up
[59:12] the structure the important ones the
[59:14] ones that can't do without if I knock it
[59:16] down everything falls I want to shake it
[59:19] from the foundation and Samson said
[59:22] listen I want to feel the pillars where
[59:24] upon the house standed that I may lean
[59:27] upon them now the house was full of men
[59:29] and women and all the Lords of the
[59:31] Philistines were there and they were
[59:33] upon the roof about 3,000 men and women
[59:36] that beheld while Samson made spot and
[59:39] Samson called upon the Lord and said oh
[59:42] Lord God remember me I pray thee
[59:45] strengthen me I pray thee only this once
[59:48] oh God that I may be at once avenge of
[59:51] the Philistines for my two eyes and
[59:55] Samson took hold
[59:56] of the two middle pillars upon which a
[59:59] house stood and on which it was borne up
[1:00:02] of one of his right hand and the other
[1:00:04] with his left and Samson said let me die
[1:00:07] with the Philistines and he bowed
[1:00:09] himself with all his might and the house
[1:00:11] fell upon the Lords this is the big boys
[1:00:14] now and upon all the people that were
[1:00:17] therein so the dead which he slew at his
[1:00:20] death were more than that which he slew
[1:00:22] in his life am we talking principality
[1:00:26] Powers wickedness in high places those
[1:00:30] were the Devils that he was shaking
[1:00:32] those were the ones that that that he
[1:00:34] was fighting against the big boys the
[1:00:37] the the the the the ones with the high
[1:00:39] titles you see he had his day he was a
[1:00:42] well-renowned hero killing a thousand
[1:00:44] Philistines like we said with the
[1:00:46] Jawbone of a donkey when his hair was
[1:00:49] cut and he lost his eyes God dropped
[1:00:52] time on him and the growth had begun and
[1:00:55] it was just a matter of time before he
[1:00:58] could push down the pillars and destroy
[1:01:00] the Philistine and we go on a little
[1:01:07] bit in a message
[1:01:09] absolute paragraph
[1:01:12] 255 just like
[1:01:17] David he was a chosen King when he was a
[1:01:21] little Ruddy thing he wasn't a a a man
[1:01:25] that you would look from a fan say that
[1:01:27] stature boy look look look at that
[1:01:30] character walking there you can tell boy
[1:01:33] the qualities that that is a king in the
[1:01:35] making no no no no no he said just like
[1:01:38] David he was chosen King when he was
[1:01:40] just a little Ruddy thing see all them
[1:01:43] great big fellows speaking of his
[1:01:45] brothers won't he look pretty with a
[1:01:47] crown on his head take the older son
[1:01:50] Jesse said Samuel said God refused him
[1:01:56] so it doesn't
[1:01:57] matter the way you feel tonight you know
[1:02:01] it doesn't matter when you look in the
[1:02:02] mirror what you see you know what we
[1:02:05] matching here is what God's seeing God
[1:02:08] refused the ones that look stately the
[1:02:11] ones that look Burly the ones that look
[1:02:14] strong and bold and brave God refused
[1:02:16] that you know but God chose who he
[1:02:20] wants God had an appointed time to see
[1:02:23] the king he want in position
[1:02:26] so they say God refused him he brought
[1:02:30] all his sons up and Jesse when you bring
[1:02:33] all the son Samuel said haven't you got
[1:02:35] any anybody else because the God I serve
[1:02:38] is the same yesterday today and forever
[1:02:40] he wouldn't lead me astray he wouldn't
[1:02:43] guide me wrong so if he tells me go to
[1:02:45] the house of Jesse and anoint one of the
[1:02:48] sons to be king and I do get a testimony
[1:02:51] based on the one to show me it have to
[1:02:53] have one or two or three missing are
[1:02:56] there any
[1:02:57] more perhaps those that seem
[1:03:01] insignificant is there a little group
[1:03:03] that I could look for and find that I
[1:03:05] could pour my spirit upon is is there
[1:03:08] somebody sing and crying in a corner
[1:03:11] that that might be a little humble
[1:03:12] sister tonight that I could visit so it
[1:03:15] doesn't matter the outside appearance
[1:03:18] now hear this he said why he's a little
[1:03:22] bitty stoop shouldered Rudy looking
[1:03:25] fellow so that is not really the one you
[1:03:27] want but we have a next one this one
[1:03:30] little bitty you know he kind of small
[1:03:32] he he does sound suited because
[1:03:34] according to the thinking that I grew up
[1:03:37] with according to popular opinion he is
[1:03:41] not the kind of person you will look for
[1:03:43] to be king he don't really fit the
[1:03:46] criteria after all he he dressing
[1:03:49] modestly and she wearing long dress and
[1:03:51] she not cutting her hair and and he not
[1:03:54] smoking and drinking that's not really
[1:03:56] we were looking for somebody a little
[1:03:58] more
[1:03:59] social that's not what he's saying here
[1:04:01] he said listen this don't fit the the
[1:04:04] natural mold that we might be looking
[1:04:06] for but you know what go get
[1:04:10] him that is the one we might be looking
[1:04:12] for and as soon as he come and walk
[1:04:15] before the prophet the spirit fell on
[1:04:18] him he ran with the oil he didn't walk
[1:04:21] and say come come come you are the one
[1:04:24] he ran with the oil amen and poured the
[1:04:27] whole horn on his head and said this is
[1:04:30] your king that's it yes sir you see
[1:04:34] that's the way God
[1:04:35] is that's the way he is so even before
[1:04:40] that he had having the encounter with
[1:04:42] Goliath and he showing that H he really
[1:04:45] made us something boy he really know the
[1:04:47] word boy cuz he come and he with bravado
[1:04:50] who's that uncircumcised
[1:04:53] Philistine David was taking care of his
[1:04:55] father the Sheep that's what he was used
[1:04:58] to from the time Samuel anointed him and
[1:05:02] the Horn of oil was poured on his
[1:05:05] head God dropped time on
[1:05:08] him it was just a matter of time matter
[1:05:11] of time before he was King it didn't
[1:05:14] matter his brother's opinion you know
[1:05:16] that's right it didn't matter well uncle
[1:05:18] say he heard what took place and you
[1:05:20] know he have a different view of how
[1:05:23] things should go down it should really
[1:05:24] be the firstborn
[1:05:26] or the second born is the tallest you
[1:05:27] know so he should really be no no no no
[1:05:29] no no no God dropped time on David from
[1:05:34] the time he was anointed that was it it
[1:05:38] didn't matter what you think or what you
[1:05:40] said or what you felt or how you move or
[1:05:42] what somebody say it didn't matter What
[1:05:45] mattered is that God made a promise and
[1:05:48] dropped time so you just had to wait
[1:05:51] just had to wait and you would see the
[1:05:53] manifestation of it amen
[1:05:57] switching quickly
[1:05:59] around in a message God manifesting his
[1:06:02] gifts speaking of Moses he says then we
[1:06:06] find him one day Hing his
[1:06:08] father-in-law's sheep coming down an old
[1:06:11] familiar path he was accustomed to that
[1:06:15] and all of a sudden his attention was
[1:06:16] attracted to some great phenomena that
[1:06:20] was a bush that was burning with fire
[1:06:22] that was not
[1:06:23] consumed and Moses he never question the
[1:06:27] bush as we would today he just drew
[1:06:31] aside and walked up to it and wanted to
[1:06:33] find out what was going on and when you
[1:06:35] approached it reverently God spoke to
[1:06:38] him amen amen God spoke to him when he
[1:06:42] approached it
[1:06:43] reverently and when we approach God in
[1:06:45] the same manner God will speak to us but
[1:06:49] never in a critical way can we approach
[1:06:52] God and expect God to speak back to us
[1:06:54] we've got to approach him in a reverent
[1:06:56] way perhaps what if Moses would have
[1:06:59] said being that I am raised up as a
[1:07:01] scientist keep in mind he was the son of
[1:07:04] Pharaoh's daughter he was educated in
[1:07:08] maths and Science and and every Egyptian
[1:07:12] culture and methodology he would have
[1:07:14] been familiar with that's what he would
[1:07:16] have gone through he would have had the
[1:07:18] best tutors and governors and guidance
[1:07:20] so here he is if he were to use his own
[1:07:24] intellect this might have been in his
[1:07:26] opinion he said you know I raised up as
[1:07:29] a scientist and as a master in Egypt
[1:07:31] I've mastered all the Arts I will wait
[1:07:33] and find out when the fire goes off the
[1:07:35] bush perhaps I'll do a little
[1:07:38] test then I'll take some leaves take it
[1:07:40] to the lab and find out just why those
[1:07:42] leaves did not burn what kind of a
[1:07:44] chemical was on on those leaves that
[1:07:47] would not burn in that great heat if he
[1:07:49] would have approached it in that
[1:07:50] standpoint in a scientific research God
[1:07:53] would have never spoke to him that the
[1:07:55] reason today that people doesn't get
[1:07:57] along with God as they should is because
[1:07:59] they are trying to scientifically prove
[1:08:01] everything and God is never known by
[1:08:03] science if you can prove God then it's
[1:08:06] no more an act of Fai you cannot prove
[1:08:09] God by science you've got to accept him
[1:08:12] by an Act of
[1:08:13] Faith so he grew up as the son of
[1:08:16] Pharaoh's daughter well trained you know
[1:08:19] he was trained to rule and to fight but
[1:08:22] you see when he saw the burning bush and
[1:08:23] had an experience with the Almighty see
[1:08:26] that is when God dropped time on him so
[1:08:28] you could run your run all the time but
[1:08:30] you see after that experience the clock
[1:08:33] start that's when it now start the
[1:08:36] action and the drama now start because
[1:08:38] just a matter of time before you have a
[1:08:40] Exodus because God said way before that
[1:08:44] my people will sour in a Strange Land
[1:08:46] and they'll be enslaved and I will bring
[1:08:48] them out but at the appointed time which
[1:08:51] was burning bush season right God come
[1:08:55] down to tell Moses hey I ready appointed
[1:08:59] time
[1:09:00] reach I want you to go I want you to
[1:09:03] take them out take them to a place that
[1:09:06] I will show you don't worry about it you
[1:09:09] don't have to discuss the plan with
[1:09:10] anybody I will give you the plan as I
[1:09:13] heard recently I am the driver you are
[1:09:15] the conductor amen I have the plan amen
[1:09:21] hallelujah just moving quickly along you
[1:09:24] know there's so so many examples that we
[1:09:26] could go into I remember the story of
[1:09:29] Mary and we all know it you know she
[1:09:32] lived a simple life a devout life doing
[1:09:35] what she was taught this is the Virgin
[1:09:38] Mary and she was following what she was
[1:09:41] expected to do this is what ladies at
[1:09:44] that stage and that age would do on a
[1:09:46] daily basis when the angel appeared to
[1:09:50] her it interrupted her natural flow it
[1:09:55] inter interrupted what she was
[1:09:56] accustomed doing cuz it's not every day
[1:09:59] an angel will appear to her but you know
[1:10:00] what after that
[1:10:03] encounter God dropped time on it it was
[1:10:07] time it was now the appointed time for
[1:10:10] something to happen because way back
[1:10:14] there was a prophecy that a virgin shall
[1:10:17] conceive and when that time arrived
[1:10:20] Hallelujah this is the time when hey we
[1:10:23] had to interrupt the normal living
[1:10:26] we have to interrupt the regular flow of
[1:10:28] things we have to interrupt the program
[1:10:31] because time reach and his word Can't
[1:10:33] Fail when he decide time up it don't
[1:10:36] matter your opinion don't matter he
[1:10:39] don't care where you are because in his
[1:10:42] mind he give you time he drop time on it
[1:10:45] amen the foolish virgins is the same
[1:10:47] case I have you they all they all had
[1:10:50] access to the same books and tapes same
[1:10:53] books and tapes you know nothing
[1:10:55] different
[1:10:56] no new material yeah no new and improved
[1:10:59] or revised Edition no no no same books
[1:11:02] and tapes and God dropped time on
[1:11:07] everybody you said listen I have an
[1:11:09] appointed time he dropped that leave it
[1:11:12] alone they all listen to the same
[1:11:15] messages but theirs weren't mixed with
[1:11:19] faith they never got into action to
[1:11:22] access the extra oil that was needed to
[1:11:25] take them out so when the alarm bell
[1:11:29] rang and the check give us of your
[1:11:33] oil that we might have some to and at
[1:11:37] that point is when they were told listen
[1:11:39] time
[1:11:41] up time is
[1:11:43] over the Bell has
[1:11:46] rung you know often times when they have
[1:11:48] contest and stuff they will tell you
[1:11:50] look look the clock there you have two
[1:11:52] hours or 1 hour whatever and you could
[1:11:54] do what what you want you could make
[1:11:57] mistakes and do over you could try to
[1:11:58] fix it you could try to adjust and you
[1:12:02] trying to do this because it's a
[1:12:03] competition based on time but you know
[1:12:05] what every time that clock hits zero
[1:12:10] they tell you time
[1:12:12] up hands up walk away this is
[1:12:17] examination time we're going to evaluate
[1:12:20] what have you done because we give
[1:12:22] everybody the same
[1:12:24] time so in this case the foolish virgins
[1:12:27] had the same books same tapes same
[1:12:30] messages same ministers same information
[1:12:34] access to all these same things
[1:12:38] yet they didn't have the
[1:12:41] wisdom to get extra
[1:12:46] oil time had run out and they couldn't
[1:12:50] change at that
[1:12:52] point in the upper room
[1:12:59] even before they went
[1:13:01] in Jesus would have spoken to them and
[1:13:04] said listen I know all you're
[1:13:07] excited I know there's a lot going on
[1:13:10] some of you all very emotional some of
[1:13:13] you all can't understand what's taking
[1:13:15] place but here's what I want you to do I
[1:13:17] want to give you an instruction with a
[1:13:19] promise so T in the city of Jerusalem so
[1:13:22] don't wait here I given you an
[1:13:25] instruction T in the city of
[1:13:28] Jerusalem until you be endued with power
[1:13:31] amen up on high so you can't like me so
[1:13:35] much that yeah listening to the
[1:13:37] instruction given you can't hang on to
[1:13:40] my C tail and well I'm following Jesus
[1:13:43] what did what did Jesus
[1:13:45] say that's good that was his promise you
[1:13:47] know he say go and T until so you know
[1:13:52] what he
[1:13:53] did he dropped on it he didn't tell them
[1:13:57] go on a I will send a comforter
[1:13:59] tomorrow he said go until until so go by
[1:14:03] faith go in obedience go and have
[1:14:06] patience go and T Go and wait and know a
[1:14:11] brother might upset you and the Deacon
[1:14:13] or Usher may tell you something you
[1:14:15] don't like but it doesn't change the
[1:14:17] instruction I give the instruction is to
[1:14:20] you not the group because I coming to
[1:14:24] see who Aran
[1:14:26] until everybody have the same
[1:14:30] word
[1:14:33] hallelujah it may have taken 50 days but
[1:14:37] the Holy Ghost was about to pour out
[1:14:39] upon that 120 predestinated seeds that
[1:14:44] were in the upper room amen at that
[1:14:47] point if you were
[1:14:49] outside it didn't matter you were too
[1:14:53] late because the appointed time had
[1:14:57] come for the Holy Spirit to pour out so
[1:15:00] it didn't matter that you were there on
[1:15:02] day 49 and you're just feeling to go
[1:15:05] down the road because somebody a little
[1:15:08] hungry you know so I believe I want to
[1:15:10] go down by the bakery my lindas and get
[1:15:12] two pie for them cuz I have a good heart
[1:15:15] and I want to make sure what Jesus say
[1:15:19] t it's not your opinion and your idea he
[1:15:23] give an instruction and and it's up to
[1:15:25] you by faith with obedience and patience
[1:15:27] to act upon it and see his promise
[1:15:30] manifest because his word will never
[1:15:32] fail he has an appointed time to be able
[1:15:36] to do
[1:15:40] that you know in a message Look Away to
[1:15:47] Jesus and it's all too
[1:15:49] familiar as we talk about sister hatti
[1:15:52] right and the preamble to this is that
[1:15:55] the prophet
[1:15:57] had shot the
[1:16:00] squirrels three of them and he was given
[1:16:03] an account yeah and as he was giv the
[1:16:07] account it was new to them it was brand
[1:16:10] new cuz who created squirrels before who
[1:16:12] had seen that before who had seen spoken
[1:16:15] word Creation in action so he sat and he
[1:16:19] was telling the story he said listen
[1:16:21] this is what I did one
[1:16:25] two and a
[1:16:27] wait
[1:16:29] three and he say you know how I knew it
[1:16:32] was going to happen because Jesus Christ
[1:16:35] is the same yesterday today and forever
[1:16:38] and at that point she sat there and she
[1:16:42] says that's nothing but the
[1:16:45] truth and the prophet said she just said
[1:16:48] the right thing so much
[1:16:51] so that it interrupted the flow
[1:16:56] God spoke to the prophet at that point
[1:16:58] and said listen give her anything she
[1:17:00] ask anything she want like the woman
[1:17:04] with the issue of blood when she touched
[1:17:05] the Hem of Jesus comment and at that
[1:17:08] point it didn't matter who was around
[1:17:10] Jesus at the time he says virtue left me
[1:17:14] who touched me something happened so the
[1:17:17] prophet at this point say
[1:17:18] listen God spoke to him and said give
[1:17:21] her anything she
[1:17:23] wants and in the message Look Away to
[1:17:26] Jesus I'm just going to read part of it
[1:17:27] for you paragraph 92 she was sitting
[1:17:30] back in the corner and when I said only
[1:17:32] thing I knew is he is still Jehovah
[1:17:36] Gyra and little had she said the right
[1:17:39] word she said the right thing amen she
[1:17:42] said that's nothing but the truth and
[1:17:44] when he said that brother Banks would
[1:17:46] hear Brother Banks would hear is one
[1:17:49] that was present that room felt like it
[1:17:51] was coming apart and the Holy Spirit
[1:17:54] said the same voice that spoke about the
[1:17:55] squrrel said give her what she asked
[1:17:59] for and I said sister hatti as a witness
[1:18:03] before God this is it now if there is
[1:18:06] any doubt in your mind you ask what you
[1:18:09] want to and if it ain't laid in your lap
[1:18:12] then I'm a false prophet that was how
[1:18:14] convinced he was he was willing to put
[1:18:17] his reputation on the line his
[1:18:19] experience on the line his history all
[1:18:22] his years all his messages up to that
[1:18:24] point he said if it isn't if it doesn't
[1:18:27] come to pass if this isn't your time I'm
[1:18:29] a false
[1:18:31] prophet she said brother Branham
[1:18:35] everybody was crying said what shall I
[1:18:39] ask I said you are poor and you live on
[1:18:42] the hill over there with no money you
[1:18:45] might ask for that you got a little
[1:18:48] crippled sister sitting here Edith that
[1:18:50] we prayed for for years you might ask
[1:18:53] for a healing
[1:18:55] I said your father and mother is old and
[1:18:57] broke down you might ask for them
[1:19:00] whatever you ask for sister hati see now
[1:19:03] if it happens or not right now and I
[1:19:06] said he has just told me the same voice
[1:19:09] give her what she ask
[1:19:11] for and she looked around said what
[1:19:15] shall I say brother brandom now after
[1:19:17] getting options like these she is still
[1:19:21] saying you know I'm not sure what to
[1:19:24] choose I'm not sure what to ask for I
[1:19:27] understand the words that you're saying
[1:19:28] you're telling me ask for anything you
[1:19:31] even give me some options but what
[1:19:33] really should I ask
[1:19:35] for she looked around and
[1:19:39] said what shall I say brother brandham I
[1:19:42] said say what your desire is think of
[1:19:45] your greatest desire and say it and at
[1:19:48] this point I want to ask you what's your
[1:19:49] greatest desire right now if God were to
[1:19:52] ask you right now what's your greatest
[1:19:54] desire right now that you can have what
[1:19:56] you will right now what would that be
[1:20:01] that's and she said the greatest desire
[1:20:04] I have is the Salvation of my two
[1:20:09] sons
[1:20:11] amen I want to tell you that when she
[1:20:15] said those
[1:20:17] words God dropped
[1:20:19] time it didn't matter where they were
[1:20:23] what they were doing what they did
[1:20:25] yesterday or last week it doesn't matter
[1:20:27] how far gone you think they might have
[1:20:29] been or your family your friends your
[1:20:32] children your neighbors it doesn't
[1:20:34] matter if you think your boss is unfair
[1:20:36] at this point when she said the greatest
[1:20:39] desire I have is the Salvation of my two
[1:20:42] sons Prophet said I said I give them to
[1:20:45] you in the name of Jesus Christ and
[1:20:47] there they went and I just want to
[1:20:49] backtrack a little bit you said her boys
[1:20:51] were even snickering and laughing and
[1:20:54] she said said the greatest desire I have
[1:20:56] is the Salvation of my two sons I said I
[1:20:59] give them to you in the name of Jesus
[1:21:01] and there they went and they've been
[1:21:03] faithful in this church with communion
[1:21:05] them little fellows sitting there
[1:21:07] washing feet with a men and things like
[1:21:09] that we are all Witnesses of
[1:21:14] [Applause]
[1:21:18] that the musicians get ready
[1:21:25] you know in the message
[1:21:27] Oneness we seek to wind down paragraph
[1:21:30] 183 it says now the coming of the Lord
