camp hallelujah oh blessed be the name of the lord my you may be seated just for a short while amen so we want to take this opportunity to welcome you all again in the precious name of the lord jesus christ you appreciate the sunday school my those are the next generation that's coming up and uh so we train them in the ways of the lord our brother jabula if you don't make it to the rapture you got yourself to blame because there's enough faith in the tapes and the books to take us in the rapture hallelujah so you better make sure you find that rapture in faith in the tapes and the books and then this is the cruel i never lost my praise hallelujah no matter what i've been through i never lost my praise when the enemy thought you were down you came up praising the lord hallelujah and here you are 2018 as it's fading out brother ivan we never lost our praise man we never lost our joy so we so pray uh appreciate the the presence of the lord brother peter chandler can we can you just stand up we want to salute you for last night's message what a masterpiece wow what a blessing what a opening of [Applause] time tested faith mind that's the question we have to answer shall the son of man find faith when he returns and you heard so many of the quotes said not find a church not find christians will the holy ghost come will he be resurrected no will they find faith and you're going to find out it's not eighth faith the faith and there's only one deep thing and the ministers will reveal it to you praise god so and you know there's only one group that can answer that [Music] there's only one group on the face of the earth that can answer that question you know who's that group it's the pride of the lord jesus christ that can answer that question yes there will be faith on the earth hallelujah so may god bless you as it's my honor and privilege to bring to the pulpit a special friend our precious brother jesse reblano he's been a friend for many many many years brother ben says there's something about old friends you meet new ones and you make new friends but there's something about old friends and i like what proverbs said a friend is forever so it's my honor and privilege to bring up our precious brother jesse robledo he's been a blessing to the bride of christ across the world man he's been to so many countries preaching this message standing for this message of the hour and he's been invited to these meetings and i believe not one person is here by accident [Music] i believe god even knew what seat you'll be sitting on and i believe he knew what message would be preached this morning so we're not gonna sit back and let brother jesse preach us on fire we came with our own fire this morning we came with our own anointing we came with our own praise so let us stand to our feet as i welcome a precious friend and brother brother jesse the plato as he comes to minister what god has put on his heart amen and he wanted us to sing that city our man amen so you're gonna aim in that word amen we say amen amen amen hallelujah welcome our precious pastor jesse robledo god bless you [Music] [Music] [Music] ct [Music] a [Music] amen amen [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] one more time ctc [Music] [Music] [Applause] ct [Music] [Applause] me [Music] we say amen amen [Music] praise his wonderful name can we give him praise can we give him glory amen the bible says enter into his presence with praise and thanksgiving praise his wonderful name i appreciate being here this morning you may be seated just the moment while i greet you i tell you what this is perhaps one of the amen praise this wonderful name um but we are here you know without a fight without complications without difficulties there is no way that we could expect the victory so when the devil fights fights in the way that he has fought this meeting and i'm sure that everybody has their own testimony of how well you see the devil don't want you to receive what you're going to receive this weekend you hear what i said what you're going to receive not what you may receive or are hoping to receive but what you're going to receive this weekend hallelujah amen and i believe this is a special uh meeting and a special time amen for the bride of jesus christ and especially during uh what i believe is a very important theme of this message of this convention amen what a question when the son of man cometh shall he find faith on the earth and i like what brother thompson said that you know there's going to be a people and only a people can answer that and i'm so thankful that uh there are quotes and things like uh well brother brown said i'll just read it sometime if i if i get a chance but when god makes a promise the promise goes out and he's obligated to his word he's not obligated to what i say or what other people say and what we make up there are many made-up promises you know but he's not obligated to that he's obligated to his word and since he is obligated to his word then he himself amen make sure amen that he becomes the answering of his own word hallelujah so how can we fail amen so we by faith amen the elected of god this portion of the bride of jesus christ can say not only just by saying it but by divine revelation amen yes lord you will find faith on the earth praise god amen and i'm here to tell you is not just saying it amen is manifesting it amen hallelujah so we is manifesting time you know amen because harvest time is here but i i don't want to i do have uh should i say a schedule to follow and i don't want to keep you too long but anyway i just want to say i am so delighted to be back in south africa and the first time i walked the streets of south africa and this great beautiful country was 28 years ago i was a young man of 20 years old and so you know it seems always that when i return to south africa although i am getting a little older i just feel a little younger here for some reason i just don't know it's it's the anointing that makes you feel amen all that singing last night and the singing this morning amen i feel like aaron's old rod that just was put into shekinah glory amen it couldn't help but uh amen blossom and yield almonds amen whenever you are in the presence of god you can never be the same again glory be to god amen listen you cannot enter the presence of god and remain the same amen you're gonna either change for the better or you're gonna change for the worse but something is gonna change amen glory be to god amen hallelujah glory be to god so i just want to take this opportunity before i just get too excited and i love preaching in south africa because there are believers here that knows amen the word there was a brother one time who uh he we had a conversation and he he he said he had visited south africa and of course i won't mention any names or anything like that but you know he well he he tried to preach something that is well not quite aligned with the word you know and i told the brother i said brother when you go to south africa you better know what you're talking about because south africa knows the word knows the message amen so i'm so thankful for that you know why because we all not only south africa but the problem that i have seen in this message that too many people do not know the message [Applause] and this is why they're so easily tossed about to and fro [Applause] faith can only rest on the word [Applause] and nothing else and i love to see a believer that's resting on the world [Applause] hallelujah to the lamb amen so if you're not you you cannot rest on interpretation you cannot rest on man's ideas your faith becomes restless it you come in and out up and down but if you ever amen put your faith on the word of god that word will never return to him lord but shall accomplish the purpose he sent it for glory be to god what a mighty god we serve today hey amen i'm here to brag about jesus you know praise god amen glory you may be seated a moment in uh amen oh cc i'm just see this is what happens in south africa amen your whole message is it goes out in your comments you know and just your introduction it's just the pull hey man amen so i'm enjoying this because i have been to places obviously that you preach you try to get people to understand their promises for their day and you know they give you a nod yeah that's good good point brother i'm not talking about a good point here i'm talking about a revelation hallelujah go repeat to god i'm talking about the same revelation that john had amen nobody explained it to john he realized amen that if it wasn't for the lamb of god that stepped forward and took the book oh hallelujah he realized he was lost but when the lamb came forth and took the book he saw his name in the lamb's book of life and nobody had to tell john be quiet be quiet no no no no because now he was in division he saw himself redeemed he saw him he said i know my redeemer living glory be to god and no man can preach that to you no man can open that up to you because that comes by divine revelation and upon this rock brother peter praise god upon this rock i'll build my church and the gates of hell shall never prevail against amen oh hallelujah praise his name oh praise this wonderful name god richly bless you i uh greet you in the name of the lord jesus christ amen on behalf of my family and our little church in valley stream i call it a little church and it is a little church amen and i'm not ashamed of that you know because you see that's scriptural jesus said fear not little flock what's your godfather's good pleasure to give you the kingdom amen and i'm not envious of those that have you know thousands whatever but you see god uh likes to deal with uh the the little things you know so god richly bless you uh i am once again so privileged and honored uh to be here and i was so blessed to see yesterday some of my old okay let me correct that long time friends hey man friends that i haven't seen in a long time and it's so good to see amen friends that uh i last year i was asking trying to figure out amen who was uh present in 1980 and the last time there wasn't many hands i think there's a few more hands uh this convention amen those were so wonderful times in the lord and we've come a long way and i think we have mature amen don't ever believe that you are going through whatever it is that you're going through it's in vain god has a plan god has a purpose and i want you to realize that your trial is custom design you have a custom design trial because amen what you are strong at in certain areas somebody else may not be as strong so he has to customize the trial if you have even more trials well god knows that you can carry it more so don't worry about the trials don't worry about the burdens don't worry about oh oh all the devils have turned against me my family my church whatever well praise the lord amen because i'm gonna show i'm gonna tell you something here's the revelation when you feel that way when you feel in prison you could here's the mystery there's power and praise you know because when paul and silas was put into jail they were put into jail amen they were incarcerated they were in chains but that is the moment that they decided to have [Applause] church poor look over to silence and say you know what let's sing a little bit i will praise the lord brother they begin to sing and they begin to shake the prison and shake it and shake it and shake it in so much that the chains that was binding them fell off the chains that were on their feet amen fell off the prison door bars networks closed swung open so if you're bound here's the secret you don't praise god because you're free you praise them to get free hallelujah amen glory be to god amen hallelujah so now so many have gone before us and we miss those that are good friends and believers and great mighty men of god that have given their testimonies over the years and we learn by them what i like to do always is to take the good and take amen what is going to benefit me amen and move on and because here is what i want to say right now they are on the other side so now there's a great responsibility that has been placed upon those that alive or and remain because they now without us did you hear what i said now they without us cannot be made perfect so we have to come to perfection by the word of god not by an interpretation not by man's ideas but by the original seed word of god amen then we'll be able to call the others hallelujah that are in uh the grave hallelujah so shall we ever be with the lord and like brother thompson said yesterday we have to climb up a little higher amen into a sphere amen that's gonna shake the whole world amen shake and shake and shake brother not only the world but it's gonna shake the graves open hey amen hallelujah there's coming a resurrection amen we have an appointment glory be to god amen so we which are alive and remain shall not uh amen shall be caught up together see with those that are asleep amen so therefore we have a responsibility i want to take this moment before i just get into this sermon real quick uh i want to thank brother thompson for and his wife and family they've been so uh welcoming to me and all of us and i and the uh tabernacle uh that so has worked so hard to make this a possibility never forget to pray for the local church because believe me while we're sound asleep many of them are still probably up hours of the night and trying to make uh us comfortable for the services and the convention so we certainly want to appreciate brother raymond thompson and his wife and the end time message believers church and of course all those that cooperated and i have enjoyed the specials that have come forth i like what brother peter says certain songs you hear certain specials you hear and others you you feel and i have felt everyone amen oh i have felt everyone glory be to god it's just just just heavenly vibes coming into your heart amen so god richly bless you and i want to take this opportunity well i bring greetings as i said from my wife and uh the original faith gospel tabernacle uh in valley stream in new york where we are a little group that is waiting amen for the coming of the lord and we know that we have to stay very close and as close as possible with what the prophet said brother brown said say what i said and the problem has been over the years is that uh so many people have felt the authority i guess to to say what he said but then add a little here there and take a little here there and see but the seed has got to remain original can't be tampered with amen because god doesn't need help his seed is perfect it doesn't need any help glory be to god amen and that seed is the word of god how on earth can we help god fulfill his word because it's not you fulfilling the word it's the seed in you that's coming to perfection glory be to god we cannot make it on our own glory be to god but there's something inside of you amen striving to be perfected amen striving to be adopted striving amen to be positionally pleased amen oh hallelujah i'm feeling happy now amen would you mind if i take off my coat [Applause] amen god bless you richly amen and and what can i say bro brother my good friend brother peter chandler amen uh yesterday's message uh time tested faith amen did you appreciate the message from brother peter trump i was tremendously blessed you know because there are people who claim they have faith and you realize that after a while after several years you realize that they have their faith begins to dwayne and fade away and what is so sad that as brother thompson have said that i have had the privilege of traveling quite a bit and there's a brother who made a statement and said i have wasted 40 years of my life preaching this message and what a sad statement to uh hear from a minister who has been in the message for 40 years and say i have wasted my time amen so therefore there's a great falling away but when the son of man cometh shall he find faith [Applause] because he that endureth till the end he's the one that's going to be saved you see a falling over here falling there you see all kinds of things on the internet and let me tell you something half of those people most of those people have never even met brother branham [Music] [Applause] but i am so blessed to even hear uh a brother like uh t.l osborne amen who walked with brother branham who saw the miracles and you know what in so much he said i seen god in that man i seen god walking in that man i seen god working in that man hallelujah so i don't want this new a that's this new generation amen i don't care if you're uh a millennial or whatever it is brother i know this message is truth it is thus saith the lord and all that we have need of is in this message hallelujah rapturing faith is in this message the resurrection is in this message adoption is in this message hallelujah glory be to god the final and the great kill is in this message hey amen god bless you amen so anyway brother peter chandler thank you very much for that uh masterpiece last night amen i certainly did appreciate it was very blessed brother peter chandler has a way of just bringing uh things in a very simple way but powerful way you see because i uh he i was telling him i said you know he comes from a different angle sometimes but boom he hits the mark right there and then you have another minister come the next service and comes just slightly with different angle and boom hits the bullseye and the key i don't care how many angles you uh amen as long as we hit the bullseye amen glory be to god amen and i'm so thankful for this opportunity so god bless you richly uh right now i wish if you could uh stand to your feet amen i feel a great uh anointing here this morning and i know that god is going to bless us amen you get only what you come expecting huh so i want to turn with uh to familiar scriptures that we know of course malachi 4 malachi 4 verse 5 and 6 and i just want to pick up of course the theme of this uh ins of this convention because i believe that uh this is not just a question that we could just read look at and say okay that's a nice question this is a seasonal question this is a question for our age because if god is looking for faith he's got to provide a way to provide that which he's looking for and we're gonna find out by the grace of god even though people may or may not uh you know they may not see exactly but it's okay we're brothers and i always say the time has come amen broadly kindness never forget as we climb up the pyramid amen and as we approach amen that the great headstone has something has has got to have something to rest upon you see and never forget there's not many people that preach on the virtue of our age they talk about oh yeah all the power all the this and that but the virtue of our age let's not forget it amen because if we ignore it we'll never go to the next step amen god hallelujah because faith you know is based on forgiveness so let us turn to uh malachi 4 and uh we'll read just two verses there uh malachi 4 we'll read two verses there and um verse 4 malachi 4 and verse rather verse 5. the reason this wise behold i will send you elijah the prophet now before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the lord now listen he had a purpose he had a commission and he shall turn to heart of the fathers to the children and the heart of the children to their fathers lest i come and smite the earth with a curse and we realize and i have often tried to explain to denominational people that malachi 4 malachi 3 amen are two different messengers amen so we at the end of the age remember we uh have have a promise to receive a messenger with the requirements of what would be needed that when he comes he will find exactly what is needed in other words if i could rephrase it like this god has done his part and if we miss it is nobody else's fault but ours if we miss it it's no we we chose and have chosen to miss it we can't blame god for it all but i thought no no no no no amen he did his part so let us turn to saint luke 7 rather 18 uh 8 luke 8 18 saint luke rather 18 and verse 7. talking about the unjust judge but i do want to drop in there when the son of man cometh but verse 7 and shall not god avenge his own elect which cry day and night unto him though he bear along with them i tell you that he will avenge them speedily nevertheless when the son of man cometh shall he find faith on the earth what a great question last scripture reading found in jude and we'll have you have your seats in jude because what we realized my friend is that we realize that this faith that we are talking about is one faith there's only one faith one lord one baptism amen hallelujah we i remember i preached a message is christ divided way back way back in chile christ is never divided you know christ is never divided we divide christ it's the lack of revelation amen that brings division we're the ones that divide christ but let's read jude 1 3 beloved when i gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation it was needful for me to write unto you and exhort you that ye should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the saints our heavenly father we have read your word lord we realize that just about anyone can read the bible lord those who you know have the ability o god to read the bible but only you your spirit can follow that word so i ask dear god that you would anoint this service in a special way and lord i pray for the next few minutes that it will be an encouragement to your people father lord take me out of the way and i pray that your spirit would have liberty father and may we realize the importance of this subject that uh brother god has given an inspiration to brother raymond thompson lord i believe is timely it is in season father god we've got to recognize that god has done his part and we must do our part amen and if we do our part he will find faith on the earth amen hallelujah we ask it in jesus name amen and amen god bless you you may be seated amen are you feeling good praise god hallelujah i am feeling very well i feel the anointing of the holy spirit in this place amen and um i had a a message that i was about to bring to south africa something that i had been uh meditating on and uh but the lord gave me a message on the way here so i i put it together pretty quickly and excuse me i had to put some notes on on this notebook and a little bit on that notebook preachers know i guess what what i'm talking about amen but i trust that god had just put it all together to make us understand amen so i was speaking uh on tuesday uh to brother raymond thompson uh over dinner and we'd be good to speak on the inspiration of this meeting and what a question amen the question is asked when the son of man cometh shall he find faith to me that is a deep question amen some pete because if when we realize and we walk out of this place we're going to find out you know denominations have faith they have faith to do things they have faith for healing they have all but that's not what i am talking about this morning this is not what we're talking about this morning us we have our faith has got to reach a higher level brother branham said we hardly have faith for divine healing amen but we have to have faith amen not only for divine healing but for the changing of the body glory be to god amen just before the resurrection praise this wonderful name and i like when brother branham talk about april forth that promised son amen uh they were old and stricken in age we all know that but god promised it god promised a son amen and of course ishmael come around and you know the the promise was slightly interrupted by reasoning let's do it this way or whatever then he no no but that's not what god said and he even testified when abraham was about to sacrifice isaac he said oh because you not have not withheld thy son thine only son thine only son because a seed will not be air what the shock praise god hallelujah amen you have been elected before the foundation of the world and i'm gonna tell you something it's not because you were a better person than somebody else amen it wasn't because your parent or or your daddy was a priest that has nothing to do with it amen because of before the foundation of the world one thing i like about election is that god is sovereign he doesn't have to ask anybody amen he chose abraham and said in blessing i will bless thee and multiply and i will multiply thee praise god and i'm gonna give you an unconditional covenant amen abraham i know you you're doing a good job but you can't hold your part of the deal so therefore i am gonna give you an unconditional covenant praise god i am gonna keep both parts amen hallelujah glory be to god brother if that don't make you happy i don't know what will amen nothing present nor things to come shall be able to separate you from the love of god so devil bring it on amen bring up the big guns because nothing present nor things to come shall be able to separate me from the love of god amen that's when a person has a revelation that's a person that cannot be shaken by denomination cannot be shaken by false interpretation he's standing on a rock and that bridge will pull across the bridge there'll be no sorrow amen hallelujah amen hallelujah but listen if there is a question here is what i want to say if there is a question then there is an answer if there is a question when the son of man cometh shall he find faith that is a question and if there's a question there it's got to be an answer and let me tell you something you may think that god doesn't know the answer but he has already answered the question he just wants to get you the revelation that the question has already been answered [Applause] hey amen hallelujah has already been answered amen so this theme this convention amen is very thought provoking and ministers and believers and church members or laity deacons ushers should really go home and not only home but throughout this meeting and think about this question because it is very important amen when the son of man cometh shall he find faith amen so i trust that the convention when it's all said and done we would understand amen that this is not just uh a a question for just a short period of time this is a question for the age it sounds simple people have read it many times but the deeper you you uh read it and you go into it and you go into it and you say you know this is something i must have this is something that is not optional this is something that if i don't have it hallelujah amen i will not be able to go and there is no one to blame but yourself i like that amen you see when god made a promise and he's always throughout the ages brother branham said in each age when god said a certain thing what happened he come uh here comes that man along behold i'll send you elijah the prophet now here's the preparation of the faith that we all need to have he's taking care of his word listen because the word cannot fail or fall to the ground because his reputation is on the line now hey hey man listen so uh in each age go when god said a certain thing would happen he come here come that man along and manifest that so somebody manifests what has already been spoken [Applause] the first is a manifestation of the spoken word but let us continue here but here come that people along and live that oh hallelujah here come that people along and live that so you just can't say i agree with that it's not enough to agree with that it's only enough amen to live that same and somebody praise god amen and only the elected seed of god can ever live that you know why let me tell you the reason why amen it's god himself living in the people amen because it's the answering of his word oh i'm just gonna walk around the pulpit here just a moment amen god promised the promise he asked the question but he's not waiting on you and i to really manifest these things because we cannot do it in ourselves you know why because it'll be god in the people [Music] because it's the answering of his word [Applause] christ in you you you you you you answering the question when the son of man cometh will he find faith on the earth yes he will he will find manifested sons of god he will find adopted sons of god he will find mature sons of god you're not the believer [Applause] brother brown said you're not the believer you don't have it in your flesh to believe this god has to put something in you before the foundation of the world to believe this [Applause] amen that's the difference others are trying to figure out intellectually but the real believer he's not worried about okay explain this to me explain that to me listen god is not known by explanation he's known by revelation and once you get it brother there's not a demon that can take it from you amen you're on your way to the [Applause] resurrection hey man i'm feeling good oh my god hallelujah so therefore listen you can be seated a moment just uh so i can get my breath i'm not as young as i used to be amen so the question is and was not will he find good people there are many many good people out there not will he find churches plenty of churches and in fact i will say this with respect and everything else that uh years ago and remember uh the first time i was here was 28 years ago and everywhere i travel amen i see that uh there are more and more churches they say in america it's like mcdonald's there's a mcdonald's in every corner and we're so divided in that sense you know that everybody has to you know uh be a whatever and i'm not here to judge that at all i'm just here to make a point all right so so therefore we're more divided sometimes when we could see and recognize the move of god in some man's life and church why don't you unite with them and just put your shoulder to the wheel amen it used to be when mike when i first came here you hardly had any auditorium that can fill uh the these conventions it's d because it was an innocence of of people that just love to be together but something has happened over the years amen that has divided amen and i'm going to tell you who that person is that is the cause of division that's the devil that's the devil [Applause] the devil loves division the devil loves when you speak mean to somebody the devil loves when you don't want to call a person that just offended you he loves that so let us make it clear right now who is the the person behind that that is the devil amen but in this day and age we must be uh we cannot have these situations get us out of focus of what we're looking for [Applause] because there are so many distractions today that if we're if we get involved in every distraction we will miss the real promise to the bride [Applause] you know the bible says in in in revelation rather uh hebrews chapter 11 it speaks of this man called enoch and enoch had a testimony enoch had a testimony that he pleased god he walked with god amen he had this testimony and you know what's the beautiful thing about this is that god amen vindicated that testimony enoch was not testifying of himself now it was god who saw that enoch pleased god his testimony his life the way he lived was so pleasing to god amen that he said this is the time that i am going to call him home amen so the question that i have today we all have a testimony but what does god think of that testimony [Applause] we all had that testimony what is god saying about that testimony are we going to realize and bring it back to love you know a lot of people say oh that love is weak no well yeah love is weak but it's powerful amen but listen enoch had a testimony in hebrews chapter 11. 11 and god vouched and recognized his testimony he pleased god and one day he was found not and just to show you that this is an individual affair it wasn't just enoch and a whole bunch of people it was just enoch who was so who lived in such a way that he pleased god and i want you to realize today it is your individual walk with god that is giving testimony to god and is that testimony worthy of translation hallelujah amen so when god himself declares here's people who say oh bless god i am i am the greatest whatever you're testifying about yourself that's not what god's testifying about you praise god hallelujah you watch people that are so uh bragging about their own ministries and who they are and how big they are oh my my my i don't want to hear from you what you're saying that you are i want to hear from god what god what you're manifesting glory be to god because we have driven away we have gone away from the life the true meaning of this message it is a life behind the name that makes the demons tremble it's the life behind the name hey that makes the proud heart humble glory be to god because in you if you are true seed of god if you are a true wheat amen what is keeping you alive it is the life that is in you and whatever you hey whatever life is in you you cannot help but bear fruits others can't do it it's a different life hey hey amen let's let's let's move on but our faith has got to be ripened see amen into another level on our faith has to be matured amen has got to come to a place amen of maturity we've got to uh our faith is all these have been progressing progressing maturing you know brother brown said in 1965 intellectually we have listening we've been listening to the message but it had to lay in the presence of the son for a while to mature he realized that he see he sold the seed of the entire bible for this body [Music] one now people may uh disagree with me i heard i i've got some emails and so forth well i don't believe it's one man message and so forth yet well you know what here's the thing i always believe and i'm very very positive about this brother i say what he said it's not my words amen i say what he said the fire falls i walk out and it's still anointed today people don't even want to hear tapes anymore they no longer want to do this or that they're trying to criticize this message over the internet but i'm going to tell you something that this angel is still standing on the earth amen bringing the people back to perfection by the word of god oh hallelujah he still heals the sick he still delivers amen i've seen it jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever he cannot change amen hallelujah but let's look at ina he had a testimony praise god that he uh uh pleased god so what kind of testimony is my question what kind of testimony in this last days will we have that that christ can recognize and say oh that's a testimony that is pleasing he's a i say and you know the bible says it is impossible to please god with our faith so we must have a god-pleasing faith amen now here is uh i'm going to get into the the sermon now just have a few minutes i'm just going to try to uh uh abide by it sure but now let's look at in matthew chapter 8 the roman centurion listen to this is so beautiful this roman centurion was not of religious background in fact he never claimed that he was religious or whatever but he had a problem and the problem was his servant was very sick very very sick now oh i love this because this is not a priest this is not a religious person this is this is a gentile this is a roman but you see he got a he had a revelation no doubt he was looking at jesus from a distance and how the demons were being cast out by a word and and uh when you're laying and he's laying his hands on people they will walk and the blind will see amen and he caught a revelation now now remember faith is a revelation because what he recognized he said you know what i am a man of authority and i have men under me that when i tell them to go they go when i tell them to come they come so he recognized that this man jesus who was called jesus had authority that he himself did not even have to go he sent his servants or whoever was to go for him and he told jesus one day when he asked for the healing of a servant oh i uh oh just he said jesus master hey i have a servant who is at home now remember he wasn't christian because he said i'm not worthy you come under my house now you think that oh the religious people had the faith but this was a roman centurion oh people are going to be very shocked that day and find out who makes it and who does it amen hallelujah people are all righteous and everything else will bless god i don't need god let me tell you something let me put let me bust your bubble we all have to come down we all need the faith this faith that i'm talking about and brother branham said a righteous man is not a sinless man a righteous man is a man who recognized that when he sinned he gets right with god [Applause] [Music] hallelujah people don't like to repent people don't like to make right with god they cannot be righteous but those that recognize when they have done wrong amen and go to god lord forgive me that's a righteous man and david was a man after god's own heart amen he had his fair share of problems but he was a man after god's own heart sure he failed sure he made mistakes but he sought the lord he sought the heart of god amen and that's the bride of jesus christ we're not ashamed to apologize to a brother we're not ashamed to say i'm sorry we're not ashamed to say you know i misunderstood you amen hallelujah the devil hates that but that's a righteous man say a man somebody glory be to god hallelujah hey amen glory be to god so he said oh i'm not worthy come over the uh uh in my room you know what but speak the word only just speak the word only but here's what i want to point out here right now speak the word only what a faith and in so much that jesus marveled he said you know i've been in israel i've walked around in every village i've gone around every amen case but i have not found this kind of faith in all of israel why because somehow some way this roman centurion his faith was on another level it was a spoken word faith it was out of season back then but is in season now speak the word only the sick will be healed by a word hallelujah the devils will shake and hallelujah and he's doing his best to divide us he's doing his best to weaken the body but i'm gonna tell you satan is too late too late there's gonna be a gathering of the bride of jesus christ amen shall be flesh of his flesh bone of his bone life of his life the same power the same spirit the same anointing glory be to god hallelujah oh my my my excuse me a minute i i told brother john conte last night brother if you don't have dancing shoes you better have dancing feet amen because i don't shoes or no shoes something on the inside if that doesn't make the believers if that doesn't make the elect of god amen charge with faith hallelujah you're not the believer the seed in you is the believer because it is the answering of his word [Music] god said will he find faith yes he'll find faith because a seed of god is in you glory lauren oh listen listen i know i can do this in south africa i can't do this in many other places but while i'm here excuse me a moment i just got to shout a little bit glory be to god amen oh hallelujah glory i feel free i feel free i feel free no repeat of god amen let the redeemed say so listen if you don't know redeem keep your mouth quiet amen but let the redeemed say [Applause] that sounds like a fairy tale no it's not amen this is thus saith the lord so it just shows amen it's not to the religious it's not to the good amen it's the somebody that has a revelation of who god is now can i now you may be seated because i want to read it one quote because listen i've learned long ago i don't push any doctrine i don't but at the same time i'm not ashamed of uh if if brother branham uh said it i'm not ashamed it's okay to re-quote it's okay it's okay hey man i like that hey man so that's just some people stop reading quotes well you know uh because all kinds of like i'm not going to get into it amen but amen it's hey amen leonard church you know this now this messenger of malachi [Music] [Music] god promised before the great and dreadful day of the lord he'll send elijah he'll send malachi 4. [Applause] but now here is a message this messenger of malachi 4 and revelations 10 7 [Applause] is going to do two things he may do two things because the seventh seal vindicated the prophet so all seven seals must be broken in order for him to be vindicated [Applause] and we today we preach vindicated [Applause] prophet [Applause] number one now listen listen this is a quote so don't don't don't attack me court you better hey man just go back to the quote and just read it yourself amen i'm just i was just so just so blessed amen and have been for years according to malachi 4 he will turn the hearts of the children to the fathers and number two he will reveal the mysteries of the seven thunders in revelations 10. [Applause] hmm which are the revelations contained in the seven seals listen or number two he will reveal the seven of the mystery of the seven thunders uh in revelations 10 which are the revelations the revelations now revelations can only be divinely revealed or else it still remains a mystery and it's still a mystery to many people it was divinely revealed to the prophet and as much as he could say he said it but he knew that somebody will see the divinely revealed truth i'm talking about you and i now amen we've got to come to perfection listen no matter let me just say this no matter how much you are in the message you can never get around this [Applause] this is a message on teaching [Music] statue of a perfect man amen that ties the man in listen if you're gonna be tied in this is a message on teaching [Applause] so call it what you want to call it say what you want to say but the way to holiness the way to perfect faith is this way hallelujah amen now listen these are the seven thunders of revelations which are the revelations contained in the seven seals in the seven seals there contains seven amen there are revelations in the seventh seal amen but listen as i continue the quote it will be these divinely revealed truths now malachi 4 had a commission to restore the faith but without it being divinely revealed malachi 4 could not be accomplished it would not be able to turn the hearts of the children back to the father so these these are connected and you can't separate it revelations 10 7 malachi 4 satan luke 17 30. hallelujah because listen the prophet come amen he wasn't the son of man he was athena man revealing these son of and in the days of the revealing of the son of man so shall it be [Applause] malachi 4 he said can't you separate it now amen i am not the son of man i am a son of man we are revealing the son of man and not only that it was vindicated he had to show you that the same one that was with abraham he said let me turn my back to the audience and he began to discern just like the angel who visited abraham and discerned the thoughts of the heart of sarah sarah you laughed oh no i didn't oh yes you did brother branham with his back turned to the to the people you had this you back there amen you had this cancer you had that problem that was the son of man being vindicated through a son of man glory hey excuse me just give me a little breath you have oxygen brother amen praise his name it'll be these uh divinely revealed truth amen that will literally literally turn the hearts of the children to the pentecostal fathers exactly so hey amen hallelujah now amen as i wind down i don't have much time amen in every age i just want to say this in every age god has had a word a time a people to manifest what he promised for that day never throughout the church ages or any time has god sent out anyone without properly equipping him the messenger with a message and giving him a message hallelujah and not only that they were elected people a special elected people i want to i look i'm going to tell you how special you are how special you are do you think that those are millions probably and thousands and thousands of people way back when when brother branham was showing the signs and discerning the hearts of the people and trying to identify the revealing of the son of man they saw those things but there was nothing in them to catch it [Applause] [Music] some of them said they sat on a platform half asleep but meanwhile god was being unveiled hallelujah the son of man being unveiled scripture was being fulfilled so they did not catch it you know why the message was not for them [Applause] the prophet put it in c4 [Music] and said this seed has to lay in the presence of the sun for a while to ripen because all along the prophet was sowing seeds but he knew right then that generation wasn't going to catch it oh but there's got to be a seed that's been in the ground brother chandler about 50 years or so now oh somewhere somehow god has got a crop somewhere [Music] that seed that was in the ground is maturing it's coming to perfection glory be to god hallelujah oh i'm talking about you i'm talking about this portion of the bride of jesus christ you wasn't ready back then of course not but you had to mature listen in corinthians 13 they said when i was a child i spake as a child which means if you can just look at how the scripture is written when i was a child i understood as a child i couldn't understand my limited understanding i i thought as a child i did as a child but when i mature wonder grain becomes more mature when it comes to maturity i changed my walk i changed my talk [Applause] those little things i don't play with those things no more i am a man now and that's what god is looking for amen a statue of a perfect man amen this is what will tie that man in into that eter eternal church age at the end of the seals [Applause] now i'm not preaching doctrine i'm just saying what he said [Applause] just just just food for thought you know glory be to god amen so in every age you had to see the time so if god promised amen malachi 4. amen a messenger according to malachi 4 revelations 10 7 saint luke 17 30. these scriptures were anointed were assigned to a a specific person that was supposed to come on the scene so you've got to know your place in the scripture because then you have scriptural vindication and brother branham recognize that see now number one see a word see the message came forth it wasn't moses message see because not only has a word has to be true but it has to be rightly divided so there are no more pharaohs in this message no more dictators no more nothing dude no no no if you divided that you divided it incorrect i'm talking about our word our time amen to the elect lady and what makes you let me just say the only thing that makes you different from all the rest you want to know what that is not you not your life not how you say amen how much you shout no no no no the only difference because you know what if that was the case pentecost will outdo us brother because they can make a lot of noise they can make a lot of shout and everything else they're out to us but the only thing that makes you different from the rest because your name was written in the land book of life before the foundation of the world [Applause] but you could not know this amen you could not know this but when the prophet malachi 4 saint luke 17 30. oh revelations 10 7 when he waved way back [Applause] and pulled out the curtain there you saw your name [Applause] brother and when i saw my name that's it i'm going up i'm going up i'm going up in the first resurrection amen i don't care what the opposition is i don't care how many devils don't believe it amen that has nothing to do with me amen i have a revelation that my name is written in the lamb's book of life amen oh hallelujah listen and i'm gonna i'm gonna say this while i'm closing listen uh and the devil listen he always speaks without proof and authority whatever he can only assume that's the devil's realm and the devil's job is to tell you and i've said this many times before is to tell you know what your name is not there [Music] it's not there look at what you did yesterday look what look look what you did 12 months ago or whatever three years 10 years ago look what you did and he always puts that back in your face but there's something in your heart a predestinated seed [Applause] that speaks back to the devil [Music] and said devil show me where i actually did that let's go back let's go back a little further let you know somewhere on the journey back he's got to jump off the train you know why before satan was created you were way back then before the foundation of the world so if he wasn't there how can you he tell you that your name is not in the book before the devil was i won [Applause] what a revelation oh my god amen and one day job got that revelation amen you know trials and tribulations are good for you sometimes you know because job was once on his back he lost all that he had he lost his possessions he lost everything but one day [Applause] a whirlwind come down [Applause] joe stand up [Applause] i'm gonna talk to you like a man stop being a baby stop complaining stand up i'm gonna show you where you come from don't worry where you are now but i'm gonna show you where it was now when i lay the foundation of the world oh hallelujah where was that amen hallelujah you were beyond this condition you are beyond defeat you were with the manifested sons of god shouting and glorifying god and he stood up and said i know my redeemer living how many kids say today i know [Applause] god bless you glory hey hey hey hallelujah to the lamb come on and praise on somebody come on and thank them somebody amen glory glory glory hey amen amen now to prove this and to prove this if god is looking for the faith that was once delivered to the saints amen and god that's the kind of faith that's going to go we we need rapturing faith now because as i said what we have sometimes it's hardly enough faith or healing or whatever but this this is what i love really see uh in 1954 god has a provided way he says and now and now we're moving right on into another great age see he was referring now to the bright age because remember he come at the end of the laodicean church age and laodicea was already finished so he called up people out of laodicea and according to the scripture and i love how uh it's it's written there god took us out to put us in he doesn't just take us out and just leave us in the middle of the year see but listen this is the last chord i ran out of time but listen we're moving uh and now we're moving right into another great age coming for the rapture this is our age there's no other age after this amen i don't care how much you plan on your 401ks and amen your bank account it doesn't matter brother i'd rather have i you know where i bank i bank on the in the first uh blood bank of redemption that's where i [Applause] and you know every time i write a check it never returns void oh praise god hallelujah who cares if the stock markets go down or governments are closing whatever you know why because here we have no continuing city but we seek one to come [Applause] see a great age coming for the rapture of the church and now this we're living in the last time of the restoration of the gifts see it stumbled many of the big fine churches it wasn't for them see and it sent nazarenes backwards amen it made fanatics out of a lot of pentecostals and i'm going to tell you something it happens all the time it's i always say the message is pure and it's always right the message is not wrong amen i i challenge you to take a close examination and you realize if you are sincere and you and you study this message you realize that you are wrong i am wrong christ is not divided he remains one one faith one lord one god one baptism one truth amen so therefore see but just the same god is moving right along bringing in the rapturing faith of his church that's right so tonight here's brother branham identifying the requirement amen when the son of man come in will he find faith so therefore tonight i represent the faith the faith that was once delivered to the saints [Applause] god has done his part i represent the faith not just pentecostal faith or denominational faith he said i represent the faith amen so therefore i'm just gonna uh just ten minutes that's it ten minutes i'm done i'm really done ten ten minutes i just want to just strike one thing because i oh hey man just one thing oh my my mind i'm gonna close with this because we realize it's sea time right time if a seed is a c a chuck is a shock and a tears of terror now now it's not my responsibility to categorize anybody in my uh i have to believe that everybody's a brother and i have to treat everyone as a brother and a sister you know why because that is the nature of a true seed but if we realize in matthew the parable i'll just paraphrase it the the parable in matthew how the sower went out and he sold good seeds in matthew chapter 13 and while he rested there was someone the enemy who came in with tears and in the beginning uh you couldn't tell until they begin to bud and realize wait a minute and the question was asked by his uh helpers there uh wow they i thought we sold good seed i thought we i thought we sold uh amen every seed from genesis to revelations according to what brother branham said i thought we did you see but meanwhile they realized that amen there were tears among the fields now here's i'm going to close with this we don't have an option now the wheat must grow very closely intertwine and everything else whatever and even sometimes squeeze you to a point that that the see the the the tears will make the seas growth very tough sometimes but here in closing a we is we because no matter how that close they grew together a week could never change because it was planted with the original seed good seed so you hear sometimes excuses well you know this brother or that brother this and that look listen it's not our responsibility to say who is who is wheat and who is here but if you are wheat you will never live a life of a tear it cannot change you so don't tell me because you're so close to this and you're being squeezed this way and that way that it's because no a wheat is a weak a shock is a shock and a tear is a tear because now we've come down to seed time bride time and by their fruits you shall know them [Applause] in this last days jesus said leave them alone don't don't because you may destroy the weeds you may be more you might do more damage to the wheat but let them grow together but here remember no matter how close you get no matter how a hard time the tares may give you never act like a tear because you are weak you can say i will love you even though you don't love me i love you we have to have the love of god and it's not our responsibility to separate from them because god himself said in the time of harvest i will separate them so the test is on you're gonna walk out of here i'm going to tell you i hope and pray that when we leave this place amen we are in love with everybody [Applause] we are in love with everybody god bless you god bless you my brother listen i know you spoke very hard things about me but listen i am a weak god bless you my brother and that's the life [Applause] god will separate it don't worry about it but we're here for a season now who is wheaton who is uh uh tara i don't know that's not my business that's the you know i i'm just trying to live my life as much as i can to be a real christian and to bear the right fruit because i'm going to tell you something there's a lot of people that say hey i am a christian i am in a message and brother they are as mean denominations that treat you better but i'm going to tell you something that's not the faith that's going to make it [Music] we have the musicians okay we have to be magnified magnetized to the headstone remember brother graham told the story the gods great magnet or the great magnet that went around and just lifted up only that which was attracted to the magnet so you it means that you have to be bribed material hey you could have driven a nice car you could have sprayed it amen and it looked like a metal and it looked like the whole i mean whole thing but the test comes when it ends up in the junkyard and the magnet is turned on and you realize that your car is not going up nowhere you have to have bride material so i will close with this amen the faith has been restored i'll close with this amen it'll be these uh divinely revealed truths some people look into seven students don't see nothing because it still remains to them a mystery but to others a revelation amen and they're hearing that voice amen hallelujah prepare for the bridegroom amen the wife has made herself ready it's a warning make yourself ready and i'm going to tell you something love everybody you know why because when you love everybody you can go to sleep at night and not have nothing against each other you are rapture material glory be to god it doesn't matter if he comes at midnight noon or not you are rapture material so when the switch is turned on amen everything that is bride material will be lifted up everything else will remain on the pile amen hallelujah so god bless you i love you remember one thing stay awake if you are a wheat live like it act like it forgive your brother forgive your sister i don't care how bad they have treated you unless you have listen nothing but perfect love that bear's repeating brother brandon went on the other side he saw oh my he said i come back and tell you please whatever you do don't miss that place because nothing but perfect love will make it into that place and faith is based on forgiveness i'll close amen i'll close faith is based on forgiveness so if you tell me you have faith and you have oh great faith that's wonderful i love that amen but at the same time your fruit will tell what you are god bless you richly i'm gonna close do you love him my time is up hey man my time is up glory be to god do you know that song i love that man from galilee do you know that song you know the song i love if not then i'll i'll i'll sing something else okay i love that man from galilee amen hallelujah let's give the lord a hand of praise amen well our lord is coming back to earth again everybody knows that our lord is coming back to earth again amen satan will be bound a thousand years we will have no tempter then after jesus shall come back to earth again god bless you my time is up i love you south africa god bless you remember amen jesus said no no no let them grow together that's the trial that's the tribulation that's the the difficulties we are experiencing but the love of many uh it was predicted that would wax cold you see we should not have our love ever wax cold for anybody you see we should we should always be who we are and i've seen so many people over time say i am this i am that but their fruits testify differently but there's going surely god has got a crop somewhere that only not that not only has the mechanics but the dynamics also amen god bless you a little lower oh our lord is coming back to earth again yes our lord is coming back to earth again satan will be bound a thousand years will have no tempter then after jesus shall come back to earth again for our lord is coming back turn around and greet somebody yes our lord is will be bound a thousand years we'll have no tempter then after jesus shall come back to again yeah our lord is coming back to earth again our lord is coming back to earth again [Music] oh satan will be bound a thousand years we'll have no attempt to dead after jesus
