midst and we come to hear from him tonight amen I feel the atmosphere is right and I feel we could turn over now to the word portion of service amen so thank you so much and we thank God for his presence and so as we want to find our Bibles real quick amen I just have two portions of scripture we want to read tonight amen praise God probably yeah I want to read from Hebrew uh Ephesians 4 11-13 and we also want to read from Hebrews 11 amen for scripture reading preschool praise God so we'll read firstly from Ephesians 4 11-13 amen and some familiar scripture but we see what the Lord will do amen preschool so Ephesians 4 11 says and he gives some Apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man unto the measure of the Statue of the fullness of Christ amen now switching over to Hebrews 11. amen Hebrews 11 and we know this is here Faith scripture but I just want to go down to verse 32 and toward the end to pick this up what Paul says here so what and what shall I more say for the time would fail me to tell of Gideon and of bark and of Samson and of Japan of David also and Samuel and of the prophets who through faith subdued kingdoms wrote righteousness obtain promises stop the mouth of lions quenched the violence of Fire escape the edge of the sword out of weakness were made strong waxed Valiant in fight turn to flight the armies of the aliens women received their dead raised their life again and others were tortured not accepting Deliverance that they might obtain a better Resurrection and others had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings yay moreover of bonds of imprisonment they were stoned they were sown asunder were tempted were slain with the sword they wandered about in sheepskins and goat skins being destitute Afflicted tormented of whom the world was not worthy they wandered in deserts and in mountains and in dens and caves of the earth verse 39 and all these are these all having obtained a good report through faith received not the promise God having provided some better thing for us that they without us should not be made perfect may God have blessing to the reading of his word let's just borrow a heads as we want to pray one more time praise God almighty God we thank you for the privilege to come into your house tonight Lord and to uh uh to invite your presence father among our little church here tonight Lord Lord we thank you for these Souls gathered here Lord and father we commit ourselves now to you we pray that your Holy Spirit would come and Lord commute us Lord father abide with us tonight Lord father we welcome our presence Lord and we feel you here alone we feel I want to speak something we feel you want to do something in our midst Lord father Lord we just now for a few moments Lord we want to just open ourselves up to our father to what you would have for us tonight Lord take me all the way father Lord bless this little thought I have here tonight just to share with your people rather we pray that your anointed would come now upon it and blame you may you breathe life into it father and Lord may you minister to your people tonight Lord what you would have to say what you would have to do you Lord father Lord I just lend myself Lord as a instrument of your your working power the father that you have your way tonight may your blessed service and Lord father we be careful to give you all our honor and glory in Jesus name amen and amen bless the Lord you may have your seats amen praise God [Music] amen you love him tonight praise God it's great to be in his house amen once more we never take it for granted amen every opportunity we have to come into the house of God Amen praise God so I greet you one more time and I thank you so much for your faith and tonight I have a thought here my title is please in Christ my inspiration Heroes of Faith amen that's my little thought here tonight amen praise God it might seem a bit odd but I just this is how it come to me praise God that uh we are Heroes of Faith here tonight and what we are fighting for or placing Christ praise God I feel like uh God is identifying him and by the word who we are praise God what we are fighting for what we are pressing to achieve amen isn't that right and when you look at the Bible you always it always Marvels me it always confounds me how praise God these men that are spoken of in Hebrews 11 praise God how they had so many different battles in every age and every situation they had their own trials to deal with praise God they were men of like passions they were men just like you and I an ordinary man praise God but in the hand of God God could do something with those ordinary man and make them extraordinary it wasn't the man it was a spirit of God working in the man and rotting amen his righteousness through them isn't that right subduing kingdoms amen praise God doing this doing that that was God working through them amen and it always inspires me and it amazes me that no matter how much we get down into this Modern Age and there's all the technology and everyone's empowered by this and that but still it Remains the Same man is still the same as he ever was back then and he still needs God's help he still needs God's counsel he still needs God's instruction he still needs God's wisdom he still needs God's Mighty hand oh hello matter of fact he's probably worse off now than he was then praise God because he's not so much Creature Comforts that they've got further away from what's genuine they've gotten further away from what's real and not have gotten so caught up in their Modern Age that they fail to find the time for their family for things that are important much less for God they can hardly find it anywhere but God promised to have another people in the land and under their messenger they will be the final voice to the final age and on that third step that pride is gonna have an individual walk with God in other words you are going to come into a condition where God will have somebody he could put his hand on he can have a witness on the earth and say Here's my spirit flowing freely God will have people on the Earth that he could just touch their hearts and say stop right there turn right turn left there's something I want you to do I don't have to explain everything but just one little not from God and Away you go because you'll have those virtues in you to respond to the spirit of God oh the spirit of God tonight is getting ready to move are you ready are you magnetized are you anointed oh Hallelujah are you ready tonight are you a sanctuary for true and living God to come down in his last day and make you a witness of his resurrection power the sick he's getting ready to be healed the dead is getting ready to be raised up the blood is getting ready to see the get ready to walk God will have a church without spot without wrinkle washing the blood of the Lamb a church with power in it a Church of Jesus Christ walking in it Hallelujah he promises and so shall it be my words shall not return for it but it shall accomplish the purpose and have sent Fortress to accomplish and if your were if God's word is in your heart tonight that it cannot fall to the crown the same God that spoke it is the same God I will bring in a pass somebody say Amen [Applause] [Music] oh Hallelujah oh so it intrigues me oh it's amazing how that man fell from the beginning isn't that right man was spoken in there we planted a garden the Bible said and he put a man in it to rule that Garden is that right but he fell into sin we don't even know a story and since that time man has been out of place he's an out of his position and that creates a certain kind of a Feeling and that's why today man is always striving he doesn't even unconscious and unaware of it he is striving for perfection striving to get back into a certain kind of a place a place like what he had once when he was in Eden where he was Secure where he was covered where he was protected he's trying to get back to that place they try to use science to do it they tried to use technology to do it but the only one tonight who can give security who can give protection who can give you Hallelujah your purpose and show you who you are and what you are to be that come from God oh only God can answer the question that is in the heart of man if a man die shall he live a can it take her to answer that question hallelujah oh you got a question in your heart your question in your life you're questioning your family you're questioning your finances God tonight has an answer the omnipotent God the All-Seeing powerful God or the god of the universe he said Heaven is my Throne Earth is my footstool oh a little footstool he looked tongue and see you in there I need to know you're gonna make it he knows you're gonna overcome he knows they're gonna holla You Got What It Takes don't fight the good fight of hate to press the battle to overcome he put something in you tonight oh I'm not something is why we are here that's something is why we shout that something is why we praise God that's something that's why I came in here tonight I come from God something inside my soul just won't let go just won't let up I got to have what he got from here I gotta have the Holy Ghost I gotta be filled I gotta be seal blessed are they the hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be held somebody save it [Applause] somebody say Amen Hallelujah oh excuse me if I get a little excited but I'm excited about Jesus excuse me an alligator fanatic but I gotta fanatical about Jesus because he died for me he paid the price for me oh honey I'm not too young to praise God I'm not too young to dance I'm not too young to shout I know who my father is oh hallelujah thank God for revelation that he put on my soul he put in he also to have you stand in all these years it is not you it is a word in you it is something you God is trying testing oh Hallelujah he's gonna prove what what's inside of you it's gonna prove it to the devil right in his face right in this either all the whiteness Wicked and unadultered on adulterous age God's Gonna approve Who You Are [Applause] let's say it is written it is written it is also written oh I'll get out of head ever pray he didn't make the promise I'll have nothing to do with him is what God spoke is what God Said oh Hallelujah devil knitting give it and he cannot take it away oh hello but it's called that predestinated you oh hello he has a place for you oh and that's what they're here to talk about tonight place in Christ oh Hallelujah Thompson there's a place for you [Music] I get inspired think about it there's a place for you you know in your heart you're meant for something he went to school to try to find the answer and they couldn't tell you because they didn't know they only know what they knew they knew about math and about science and about language but I can't tell you who you are the colleges could tell you about MBA and degrees and PST but I can't tell you who you are the mentors of this world they know about oh specialized skill sets and all these things if you study medicine I guess they have cardiologists and there are people who study brain science and different things but they can't tell you who you are people keep going deeper into education trying to find themselves praise God as an education could tell them who they are well another education is just a man's experience is written in a book that you're reading about that you're not trying to learn you're not trying to catch up with stuff that he learned long time ago oh hallelujah hallelujah but the Bible said learn of me oh God wants you to learn of him by experience by a daily walk oh Hallelujah by the Bible by the word oh he said walk before me and be perfect it's a walk it's a daily life it's a daily struggle sometimes you're up sometimes you're down sometimes you don't do what praise God you ought to do praise God sometimes I sit back a couple pray but when you catch yourself you recognize whose son you are I don't belong here there's a crime in my spirit I need something more oh I need something real the world cannot satisfy not amount of money that I make won't satisfy The Thirst that God put in my soul for reality oh Hallelujah I come back again because I recognize I need more of him I need more of God I'm hungry I'm thirsty oh Hallelujah the world try to fill your tests with all kinds of things with all kinds of material things with all kinds of achievements with all kinds of things house car whatever but after a while you recognize it's not enough it's just another material thing but Jesus said come unto me all these are heavily Laden and I'll give you rest come unto me and drink the water I have for you you shall never touch again if you drink from this water or the world you to drink from their well but if you drink from God's wealth you'll never chase again it's everlasting life springing up in your soul springing up in your spirit something in your heart something more that goal something that stands a test something that stands a trial something that pushed back something that fights off the enemy something that fights off negativity fight of the devil fight off loss fight off lies fight off Hilt fight of Pride fight off hatred that is God in you working his way out oh hallelujah hallelujah glory to God glory to God [Applause] [Music] [Applause] so please in Christ what is this it's God's desire for us this is what we're striving for tonight is what he's striving for every day we wake up we found out we're on a mission praise God to find our place our place in Christ find our purpose to find our position and once you're in your position when God sets you in your position the devil cannot take you out because you're fixing it oh there's no taking it out there's no ripping it out there's no pulling it out praise God you are sealed in oh Holland the devil is sealed out that's the kind of man God wants on the earth oh Hallelujah till you get into that sealed in condition we are continuously striving and tonight we are striving striving at all that is in US earnestly contending for the faith that was once delivered to the Saints we are striving we are striving for the love

Temperance and patience and godliness and really kindness oh hello we're a seven manifestations of one Holy Spirit we're coming to you and make you a partaker of this divine nature that is in Christ oh Hallelujah keep praising them keep fighting keep pressing keep blowing a hole to the negative atmosphere with your praise amen hallelujah praise God take a little hammer and keep chopping away chopping away if only God is a slingshot tonight then wind your fling wind your fling and keep hammering away until you will pour a hole through this Earthly atmosphere into the supernatural where the glory is never fail beyond that Riven field oh Hallelujah Oh Glory Glory yes yes there is a light Beyond those dark skies there is a light don't care how dark it gets don't care how much the devil crawl into your mind and try to rip you down and try to make you feel small make you feel like you can't overcome say boo back tonight say pull back to the devil and get stronger and get stronger Amen brother praise God you've got it in you huh that's what amen that's what those Heroes of Faith believed that we all know hope there was a god out there somewhere who can answer our prayer I'll stay here until he come I'll pray until he come I believe until he come Elisha when he met the without the mantle was nobody else was just a man Elijah and Elijah was told to do it because Elijah will do nothing haphazard he don't talk all the timing and he don't do nothing unless God show him so it was God working on Elisha's life and he knew what he felt he knew the anointing had come upon him that's why he could talk the way he talked that's why he could walk the way he walked with which there was what kid in battle it was in kilgar together they were still journeying Elijah knew he hadn't got what he wanted yet and he was not satisfied until he got it so he stayed with that man of God because he never recognized that man have something he might have thought it was a mantle but he was after that something and we are after that something tonight we don't might know fully what it is we might can't explain it but we know there's something oh something about that Malachi for message something about that word something about our prophecy something about that anointing when that true anointing strikes a pride up into Glory as I promise lay in there in Scripture amen we believe it somehow we believe it pick oh you can pick anyone out of the Bible they believed it I always admire Mary such a young lady such a caution such wow such tenacity that's Admiral oh she told her parents this child is of the Holy Ghost that's what he told me I don't care what your interpretation is I don't care what you thought I did I know who spoke to me I know what's growing inside of me I know you're under persecution though you're trying Hallelujah trial you're fail to the devil and look like you're nobody but you know who you are you know who spoke to you you know why you're here tonight you're here to meet Jesus you didn't come here to meet me oh I live in arima you could have met me in arima praise God Amen you didn't come to meet me tonight you came to meet the Holy Ghost you came to meet Jesus Christ amen you came to me that same one that made the promise to you he's gonna fulfill it in his time and season oh do you believe it tonight Glory Hallelujah praise God image Heroes of feet and this is what we become when we begin to walk in this way you didn't set out to be a hero he just wanted something you just recognize something that the world didn't recognize you just became conscious of something you became aware of something that not everyone else was aware of God put something a little sliver Hallelujah of Hope in your soul hallelujah hallelujah and it wakes you up in the morning it makes you try again even though you're fail you try again oh because there's something inside of you that just won't give up that just won't believe the devil's lie oh that's that Angelic representation that you have when before the beginning hallelujah amen Michael and the angels fought praise God you resisted the devil's lie up there that's why I don't hear you can't judge you stuck just can't stomach his lies you can't believe it for too long because you know there's something more than that there's something more real than that the Holy Ghost for real there's a power more real there's a word hallelujah concerning your life Hallelujah [Applause] great faith that's what they had and Hebrews 11 Paul starts off talking about faith isn't that right he actually starts the scripture off talking about faith and then he shows by that same fate how these men of God stood stand the test yes in their time and in their day throughout scripture Paul is I mean I can't really read it all but he's he's coming through all down to the scripture by faith Eva by faith Enoch by fed Noah he's skipping uh uh chasms of time and yet in every dispensation by Fate by faith they come out by faith the Bible says Abel offer them God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain by which he obtained witness that he was righteous it was by a revelation that God put in Abel's heart oh hell is that and by pitch he offered a more excellent sacrifice oh Hallelujah isn't that right by faith Enoch walk with God and was translated that he should not see that isn't that right when you read the early part of the Book of Genesis it's like an obituary this one died this one died and this one died but when you come down to Enoch they say Enoch walk with God and was not because God took him oh hallelujah hallelujah all of a sudden God interrupted this one died this one died this Wonder to introduce a new thing pray someone who walked with God so close praise God that one day he was missing one day he was just gone and that's how the bride is gonna be here one day you're gonna be missing one day you're gonna be gone little bit of secret going away of this great pride being caught up to meet him in the air oh I want the power of this church Rises power of that church power that church it brings a Brethren and then up we go praise God Amen Hallelujah isn't that what the prophet said amen that's right see and Paul skips down through years of scripture talking about by faith Noah prophet Abraham and Sarah by faith Isaac by faith Jacob by faith Joseph when he died I made mention of his departing of the children of Israel giving Commandments concerning his bones he told them don't leave my bones down here in Egypt but take it with you when you cross that River make sure you pack my bones hey praise God somewhere I want to be over there I want to be where the promises are there's only death in Egypt but there's life who may not promised land oh man I promised land up there yonder oh oh take my bones with you oh hallelujah hallelujah I want to be there when Christ walks the Earth I want to be there when that Resurrection goes out I want to be there oh hallelujah amen in the right gonna sleep in Saints arise and appear to many amen amen to the federal Revolution amen take my bones with you with my fate it's by Revelation from God hallelujah something revealed to him hello that always was around but is a personal revelation to the individual God was always going to fill you with the Holy Ghost long time ago he predestinated it but when he reveals it to you he pulls back the little sliver of understanding and of knowledge concerning your life and give you just enough Faith to keep holding on to keep pressing on to keep coming every Wednesday keep coming every Sunday keep coming every prayer meeting holding on to the horns of the altar you've got just enough Faith to believe that tonight there's many people who started off in this race and we can't find them today but God put something in your soul tonight that's what brought you here that's what fatey put in your heart and though you don't understand it all don't you worry when you get to that Ephesians you're going to understand oh but right now hold on to that page hold on to that promise what he give you he's Gonna Fill you he's gonna deliver you he's gonna bring your children out he's gonna deliver the young people he promises he promises a the walk he promised a plan will see how do you not know that that condition is there for the glory of God to be made manifest oh in a time and season he'll manifest it oh Hallelujah just hold on to faith that's what he did not amazes me okay let me read something here quick time is going but uh prophetic question and answers on Genesis paragraph 61. amen Parker 61 he says now the first man now he made the first man in His image the prophet said that we are returning back to that image isn't that right back to that image that's right our first created image Prophet said when God created me William Branham I was before the foundation of the world and he made my being my spirit he said I wasn't conscious as far as I know but I was there he said oh and I he said I don't believe you're getting it he said but now just a minute Jesus told his disciples that he knew them before the foundation of the world oh hallelujah it's real he told them he said I knew you before the foundation of the world and Paul said here that he chose us in him before the world began oh it's predestination oh hallelujah hallelujah looks back to foreknowledge God knowing that you would be here he put something in your soul Something to Believe something to press your way past all the doubts pass all the fear pass all the unbelief oh Hallelujah be selfless and be Reckless and Faith oh honey you give you that to believe amen do you believe that now there's some part of me he said oh man oh and have all the rest of you here that is in Christ Jesus before the world ever began and he said he has my analysis of that I think that the people today are possessed with this Spirit or he breaks it down what the spirit is he said the spirit that part of these Angelic beings he said he believes that the people today are possessed with this Spirit the spirit of the Angelic beings that rotated off of God that never fell in the beginning and resisted the devil's lie in heaven hey you are possessed with that Spirit tonight oh Hallelujah that's how come you all can overcome that's how come you pass through that trial that's how come you pasture that test you had another spirit with you oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah Glory [Music] [Music] hey man praise God [Applause] okay see your possessed with that Spirit right Prophet said so I learned two-thirds of the earth is in sin he said and more than that which two-thirds of the Angels was kicked out he said and those demon spirits is what coming to people and habitate their body said see what I mean he said they're demons that once that once existed and they come into the people and give them a nature oh and that explains the behavior explains the erratic Behavior they're stripping the clothes the the LGBT and different things give them a nature see here it's unclean right amen okay is it covered their body right see what I mean he said they were

Hallelujah can we preach a little bit having done all to stand means you are prepared to stand it don't mean you're taking a stand for granted but you have to do all in order to stand you understand that it's not putting on half an hour and say God or take care of the rest no make sure your loins are good about make sure you have on your breastplate make sure your Shield is in front of you to protect you from the fiery doubt of the wicked every uh piece of armor has a function it serves a purpose and it is very important to the body of Christ it is very important to the believer it's very important to you [Applause] very important you can imagine going out there without a shield you can look up I think it was in Sparta greeson land right they were really warlike tribe of people and uh they said that in Spartan Warfare that the shield was one of the most important parts of the equipment he said they said they actually honored their their Shield more than a spear because if they lose their sphere they still have the shield and they could protect the person on the other side and they could protect the person on that side and when they form a line with their Shields you can't break that defense press four break defense press forward push back the enemy your Shield allows you to do that well the Bible call it a shield of faith so when you hide behind your face the Revelation that God give you you can take a step forward push back the enemy take yourself power push back the enemy take a step forward until you are able to take the sword of the spirit and chop the enemy the ribbons oh hallelujah hallelujah Oh Glory the God Amen that's what your feet does so stand behind your fridge believe in your conviction and let your Works do proof that the faith you have in your soul push back the enemy push him back in prayer push him back in Pitch push him back when you come into this church push him back oh push back the enemy he tried to take your joy try to take your

morning we've gotta fight in our souls amen we're fighting for inheritance fighting for adoption fighting for a place in Christ that's what they're talking about tonight amen wonderful praise God see spirits upon people so you're fighting them Spirits was made up back there when God began to make a man hold his own image created those supernatural beings those Spirits right okay so we come from God summing inside of us knows that isn't that right that's that spirit amen Caleb had another spirit with him praise God no he was out there 40 years he said give me my Mountain praise God I was promised of me it was not right he still had a thirst for his Mountain after all he had seen and after all he had heard and after all the interpretations they had in the different troops and whatever right you don't want to try that one you don't want to try that one that's your business but I have a personal revelation of the mountain that God gave me I won the whole Mountain I don't want 99 and nine tench I want what God gave me I want all of it I want all of hate all our virtue all of knowledge all of temperance all of patience Hallelujah it's not right oh my seven perfect spirits it's not you want all of it because and I was fellowship with somebody and I was saying that you know God broke himself up into seven parts it started off as one Christ one Lord One Faith one baptism right and then down through the age he's turned it out in fate turned it out and put you turned it out to knowledge tumbling Temperance and in every age it was like a mysterious thing but he was thundering out just one Thunder going out there building on top each other isn't that right and when you look down through the line when the prophet looked back and see what God was doing all throughout the ages he was rebuilding the church again color rebuilding it again layer after layer after layer isn't that right she said manifestations still one Holy Spirit but seven manifestations of himself in every age is 100 out and then oh my God God is amazing he's the only one who could do that and put himself back together again and show you Christ in every age and come back in this age and show you the fullness of himself Wesley had a dip of it Luther had a dip of it which you can have all these seven spirits in you oh hello I live for his live voice live voice thundering out thank you [Music] he builds himself back again mysteriously reflecting himself in every age as a thunder thunder comes back again praise God as a full image fully restored image into the church oh Hallelujah only God could do that praise the only God the simplified will come now praise God and deliver the children of Israel that simple if I divided itself pray in the upper room is not right and give each one day portion give each one their inheritance Place each one positionally this one here that one day Peter this James this John this isn't that right give each one day a lick of Fire praise God and set them out into the world set them out into today and to the Samaria into the outermost parts of the world a lick of fire going with each one fulfilling our purpose here fulfilling our purpose here praise God to the world and look where but God putting it all together making it work for his good making it work for his glory amen the holy spirit in control of the church that's what he wants to come back to that's why we have to have the sovereignty of the local church because God wants to walk with each Church a certain way with each group a certain way so we kept trying to be run off trying to plant corn if God didn't give us corn to plant we can't run off China plant wheat or China bring up Bali if God didn't give us that God give us all measure we got to work it on measure but when the building when Solomon put the temple together when the building goes together there won't be the sound of a hammer or bus saw or anything oh but what God put together in his wisdom he crafted everything to fit right perfectly in place oh Hallelujah and then down comes the Shekinah Glory the sound of the rushing Mighty Wind oh but in silence he's working on the church working on the bride working on you Lord look like you're nothing God is working his way out God working his way out in your trial in your test in your storm with your family with your children seem like nothing happening seem like God not hearing you when you just keep praying he is right there waiting for you to come to the river oh Hallelujah to come to separate yourself from all unbelief so the fire could fall upon you and he can make you a witness oh Hallelujah God is amazing I heard a preacher say one time God is the only one who who left is still here and he's coming back again try to figure that one out oh he said Lord I'll be with you always even in you oh the world don't see him no more but you see him and because he lives you shall have also you've got the testimony of Jesus and you know that there's a manifesting Time coming oh hallelujah hallelujah revelation will be a manifestation in your heart and life amen I was fragmented throughout the ages it's gonna come together to form a pyramid amen God tying up the Loose Ends amen and bring it all together to reveal Christ isn't that right Amen to show what he's done all right I'm running away here but uh Hey man let me just finish up so Christ is the mission of God revealed right Prophet said no we see this mystery out in his mind before the foundational world he said no you must read a little of this he said okay he said uh push up to Ephesians right uh and now what she said no how do you get into Christ by joining church he said no by one Spirit First Corinthians 12. see by one Spirit we are all baptized into one body that's what we want tonight amen the spirit of God to baptize us into that body of Grace that's how you get in there amen he said all right that's the one he's talking to he ain't addressing the outside world he can't talk to The Sinner on this email is not right because he doesn't know nothing about it Paul didn't address the Sinners he said this is to that group there oh who are we tonight amen praise God he said that grouped here see um amen uh uh where was that that in Christ Jesus yes that group that is in Christ Jesus that's who he's speaking to he said put Grace be unto you and peace from God or father from The Lord Jesus Christ who bless blessed be the governor father Lord Jesus Christ who bless us with all spiritual blessings where he said whereabouts he said in Heavenly places in Christ here's the prophet City at 182 he said Heavenly places oh how I wish I had time he said hey I've got it marked right here in my Bible about Heavenly places he said what is Heavenly places Heavenly places for just a moment he said is the believer's position in Christ oh hell he said where to believe us stands in Christ in Heavenly places he said according as he had chosen us listen close chosen Us in him before the foundation rule when did he choose us before the foundation of the world when his great hidden Mystery his great secret he chose us in Christ before the foundation of the world before he created it oh before he even started the work he knew what the end Vision was supposed to look like oh that's how our Builder operates that's how a designer operates oh and that's how God the Divine architect that's how we put it together he always had a plan oh he always had a plan he's always 10 steps ahead of the enemy he always had a plan to bring you out he always had a plan to fill you with the Holy egos he always had a plan to deliver you he always had a plan to deliver your family you gotta let go of your mind and begin to accept God's plan for your life where you lead me I'll follow where you lead me I'll go his plan is perfect oh hallelujah hallelujah oh we don't trust God enough with his plans concerning us oh honey but he had plans to prosper not for you to fall to bring it to unexpected end taxes planned for you oh it's expected it's premeditated it's predestinated Amen oh Hallelujah in God's mind isn't that right oh my see there's it says a mystery see he before Christ so anything else was ever on the earth you see his Greek mystery that he chose the bride that's you here tonight amen knowing Eve would fall no no from from disbelief in the word knowing that she would fall but he would choose a bride in the end time that would not fall that would hold to that word regardless of what all the world had to say about it that would hold to that word see they are predestinated to stand there the adoption of children by Jesus Christ according to the good pleasure of his will he loved to choose you he enjoyed electing you he many many it was a it's according to his good pleasure isn't that right amen hallelujah so he loves to see a worship he loves to see a worship on this Revelation praise is not right oh you might not have a lot of material things praise God to jump a shout about but you've got something more than gold in your soul a revelation what he spoke to you oh and that's what's holding the Rings oh Hallelujah not the things around not this black Skies that's not the sign of God's disapproval but his approval is that you are accepted and that Spirit baptizes you into the party and you are accepted and your soul is stamped with a fired brand of Jesus Christ and you could go through the trial you could go to Tom you can go to the flood you can go to the persecution you could go to the tumultuous hey it's not right like Isaac was talking about Sunday You're an eagle you're pressurized a certain way to face the storm you're not afraid of it pray because you're built to take it you're built a stand you're built to stand a test of time the trial the pressures of this life there's something inside of you built a ticket spread your wings Eagles Don't Be Afraid hallelujah oh when the birds are running from the storm the eagle has used that as air flow storm winds up other eagles eagles are pressurized to use to use strong force winds as air flow to just float on it to disconnect on it oh hallelujah hallelujah they got what it takes when the enemy blowing and you're blowing on you trying to get you to stop praising God stop worshiping you just use that as airflow I believe it is written don't don't worry about it praise hey hey praise I'm still coming I'm still coming Hallelujah [Applause] foreign [Applause] [Music] it's built in God's Gonna Give You a nature a built-in-ness yeah he's gonna build this in you and then you're gonna be able to stand the test stand the Tom you know how it's going to happen right okay explain it but I come in one way and I come out here I come out change I come out transformed I'm not what I was I'm I'm not what I used to be praise God [Applause] I see this trial just test this storm doing something and we seal me up and now I'm here praise God Amen I'll work in your life praise God it's no it's not science if you could believe him he's not right praise God see so the church will have a way of complicating the thing you know you have a way of complicating it looking at like oh it's maybe it's this maybe it's that God didn't ask you to figure it out just said believe hey Mary man either believe it on me though you were dead yet shall he live praise God Amen not figure it out if your dog can't believe all things it's not right amen all right God's okay too far he said now you see the secret see what he wanted to restore Fallen Eve see and she was a prefect of the church and now notice God opened up the side of Adam took out Eva his own flesh and blood divided his Spirit masculine feminine put it in you see uh took the rib form on the side made the evil division so on so God did the same thing God took out to the side of Christ the blood and water and Christ is the word and he take and taken the word making up his church hell with that same word isn't that right wrapping hand at Eve see back to himself again Redeemed by the blood that was come from his very own body amen you see it now congregation says amen that's right amen so God great mystery now being unfolded that's been hit since the foundation of the world but prefigured it uh all the way down through now watch we find that he he did that and here in Ephesians many other places but that will give you enough to say now go down to the agency been slowly unfolding this mystery he said can you see it now now down through the age he's been a slowly unfolding this mystery and we see it now praise God coming down to the end of the thing it starts to take form oh how do we get to see what he was doing all the time it's not like a perfect masterpiece when a masterpiece starts out it doesn't look like what it's supposed to look like big ugly Rock right the whole thing look odd and weird weird Stone what do you do with that please isn't that right big ugly Rock but as they begin to work on it it began to take form and you get less of The Rock and more of the image and when you come down to the end of the thing now you see what the master had in his mind all the time it ten began to take form it began to take shape oh hello that's why I'm about to look back and saw what God was doing he got excited and he prophesied and he said there's going to be a bride oh I hope I live to see it it's so close but I could see it coming into view that glorious Pride coming into view or she's going to come no he knew it he caught God doing something and he said it's gonna be a bride on the edge and we believe it Hallelujah by about 50 plus years later but we still believe the words of that Prophet hallelujah oh there's going to be a bride without spotted our wrinkle amen amen that's the servant of God that goes into the Rapture isn't that right amen okay so so the whole Rapture now see Luther was apart where's he was apart the prophet was apart right they were all those Heroes isn't that right coming up to all the ages there believe in all the Lord Jesus Christ praise God they had just a dip of it if we go back and tell luta what God is doing in his age he be dumbfounded he'll be like wow all of that praise God he didn't even know where he was just doing his part running his race very well praise God hallelujah doing his part but when you come to the end you see the whole picture and that's what we are privileged to see in his age and to whom much is given much is expected amen so we've got to run this race amen the race that is set before us amen oh I'm almost finished outside of that you're lost I don't care who you are what relationship is what your fellowship is or what your organization is you're lost outside of that word being in you isn't that right do you believe that okay I think we got all of this here I don't even have to touch this here I think we could skip this here hey man I think the message has gone home is not right amen I'll just read a couple things and then we close out this tonight amen praise God oh all right uh let me skip one down here right said I want you to know this this uh okay he said I want you to know just come to my mind just now when Moses sent those 10 spies over he said was an Harvest of great great time right perfect type of Pentecost first fruits Pentecostals and the Gathering of first halfways and when they was in Kadesh bani a judgment well then it was it was to be determined on whether or not they go over and get the Holy Spirit or not right you say is that a promise yes Peter said repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for your sins isn't that right he said now we got too much people saying it's too hard we can't do it he said but we can it's harvest time he said that's the reason they got this big bunch of grapes and brought it back for an Evidence and he said and I see Caleb and Joshua with that on their shoulders Heroes of Fate tonight right marching down through there he said they were just singing The Jubilee song sure they had the evidence on their shoulder they could prove that it was a good land and they brought it back and they gave all the children a grape if they wanted to him that's not right just look at what bunch of grapes they had and now Joshua and Caleb he said when they heard all this murmuring the people say it can't be done can be done Caleb run out in the midst of the people and quieted them and said yes it can be Joshua stood by him and said certainly it can be God given it to us Prophet said amen I like that oh Hallelujah I didn't go with what the Giants they saw they go out with the word that God gives them oh there's a land is a good land here are the grapes hear the evidence Malachi 4 brought back evidence of that land Healing The Sick raising the Dead cast on our Devils we didn't come all this way to give up praise God let's press on there is a land beyond the river there is an Ephesians land flowing with milk and honey oh Hallelujah Glory do you get it amen big grapes oh evidence oh a little fishy I give you your life says how do you write two boys isn't that right evidence oh there's a land beyond their friends pray let's try let's press towards it amen the final place in Christ he said adoption and Joshua knowing this by inspiration let up the Holy Spirit after being into the promised land gave each man his promise exactly what the Holy Spirit promised through the birth back there amen when they were born their names were given right he said just a quandary Revelation they will place he said and now how that God has set someone to church through the labor pains he said oh they get tremendous sometimes he said but when a church show glory is groaning under the persecution of the outside world oh on the outside world they're twisting it up they're falling away they believe in this and they believe in that oh hello but we're groaning against that we're saying God is still the same his word is still the same his promises are still the same he's promising Hallelujah believe in on the Lord Jesus what that the promise of the Holy Ghost is just as real to us as it was to Pentecost oh though it might look like it but that's what we're waiting on we're waiting on that just as real Holy Ghost just as real as it was to Peter just as real as it was to Mary it's just as real as it was tea is it to you my brother to you my sister you're gonna receive that same holy ghost that same paneer that Mary received that Peter receive you're gonna be drunk in the spirit you're gonna speak Hallelujah I know word of God will be mad manifest they will be another book of Acts God promises God promised to deliver his church we believe tonight it is just as real or just as real as promised just as real as healing power just as real his divine power tonight oh we know it perfect oh hallelujah hallelujah say to this mountain we move don't you doubt in your heart that time is coming where you gotta have whatever you ask for speak the word and move power don't be afraid of the enemy oh Hallelujah Glory take confidence be a hero fearless and adversity hold to that word amen if I died if I perish I perish amen but I'm going in oh hallelujah hallelujah amen isn't that right oh praise God musician can get ready most initiate Holy Ghost set in the church right he said I promise the Holy Ghost just as real the Pentacles how they groan and cry under labor pains all grown and crying and praying crying and travailing the spirits knowing that God promise how long Lord how long Lord oh Hallelujah and positionally Born Into the kingdom of God then the Holy Ghost set in the church some Apostles some prophets some teachers some evangelists some pastors isn't that right then he gave it into there speaking of tongues interpolational tongues knowledge wisdom Gifts of healing all these things oh my all kinds of Miracles isn't that right praise God after you're born and positionally born then God said in the church this fight for Ministry then into there he gives these gifts we restored back into the church oh Hallelujah that's the order he gave us amen so that's what they're striving for not just to be born but to be positionally born oh porn of the spirit then Place positionally into the church oh Hallelujah glory to God Amen God then God uses you in your position amen amen hallelujah amen isn't that right each man a measure of the Statue of the fullness of Christ that's why we read that right amen oh man do you see it now wonderful amen so where the church is now he said this is my purpose of doing this the church is always trying to take somebody else's corner he said but don't do that you could never raise corn in ephraim's corner that's what you're talking about is it right he said if you are Manassas what you've got to take your place in Christ positionally take it he said oh it gets deep and Rich when we get in here how that God puts one in the church to speak with tongues and then another something else right he places them that way so it's not up to me it's not up to anybody else here is who God plays to do what praise God that's their position respect the brother love the sister they're in that position praise God doing what God called him to do amen amen we believe it's not right oh man I know you've been taught many times Hallelujah he said we all have to speak with tongues see how respect is so important amen as I get closer to this I realize respect so important see because you've got to respect each other's position God wants to place the church and it takes humility respect to reverence what God's decision is concerning brother so and so sister so and so whatever it's it's very very important praise God break because the disrespect that is to disrespect God's order of things oh and that's a great offense amen so let's take Heat tonight amen my God Amen said oh wonderful we all have to speak of tongues that's wrong no we don't all God to do it no we don't taking prophet and he said they all didn't do one thing each one was uh each each land was divided up by inspiration is that provided and divided amen each land each portion of land was divided and provided by inspiration each one he said I can take the scriptures show you how exactly how you put them in place and so on like that but we're going to get through that but he said you know he said how the two half tribes this way across River and so on and so forth like that and each Place how that each place was supposed to be he said no after you're in he said that don't mean you're out free from war no you still have to fight for every inch of ground you stand on oh remember your conquer and you maintained keep fighting keep fighting amen it's constant battle praise we're going down to the resurrection so it's fighting all the way he set it up that way praise God until we all come to this isn't that right this this is it oh perfect oh I'm enjoying this coming out to the end right so now we have to see and they don't mean you're free for more you have to fight for everyone so see Canaan didn't represent that great heaven but it's because it's war and troubles and killings and fightings and so forth see it's not this new millennium thing see it's still this fight but it's this represent this and that it must be a perfect walk amen praise God it's not in order to overcome amen or final quote I'm finished you could play something so please now right Ephraim don't want to stay one of them over here he said fine Manassas sake over here oh my lords give me a good cornfield there he comes over here God said well no wait a minute I'm supposed to raise oats but I want corn too Hallelujah see he would say you ain't got nothing to do with corn get oats oats is your part to raise you're supposed to raise her sheep when you're supposed to hurt cattle and so forth like that see showing each one take their place right Oh my he said so now it's not true he said he can't place a church Prophet said see the church is supposed to be predestinated onto the adoption of children where a man can take a uh where God could take a man and adopt him into the family and give him something not first and try that first he gives it to him and then he tries it and see if it's right the Bible said try the spirit this man claims a certain thing try it and see if it's right test it prove it God is confident if he give you something it'll stand a test it's not God is confident that if you give you a gift he will try it it'll go on trial and it'll pass a test every time if it comes from God it will pass the test hey try it see if it's right the Bible said try the spirit see it is my claim a certain thing try and save it right and if it's right move right with it and then say Lord send us something else keep moving see he said just keep moving till every fellow take his place and then you're going to see the Church of God begin to get it its place well that's when the Philistines will go to Buckingham the show to go off he will go down faces will be washed cigars will be missing that's right when the church begin to get into its Mighty power when we have an anania sense of fire and a few of them yes sir you'll see when our holy church stands in power police says sons of God adopted into the family
