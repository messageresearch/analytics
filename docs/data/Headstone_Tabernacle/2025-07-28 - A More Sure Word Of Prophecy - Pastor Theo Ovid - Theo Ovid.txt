The Lord had chastened me so, but he had not given me over unto them. Open to me the gates of righteousness. I will go into them, and I will praise the Lord. This gate of the Lord into which the righteous shall enter. I will praise thee for thou has heard me and art become my salvation. The stone which the builders refuse has become the headstone of the corner. This is the Lord's doing. It is marvelous in our eyes. This is the day which the Lord hath made.

Father, we thank you for your divine love for your presence in such difficult times. We know it's dead to be out of your presence is life to come into your presence and how you have sent your angels to drive us back to that tree of life. You said that I come that you might have life and have it more abundantly. Father, may that abundant life drop down here this morning to every heart, to every son, every daughter, every bride, every sister, that something would be done or said that will transform their lives forever. May no one leave the same way that they came. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But may the Holy Spirit, the revealer of the word, come and inspire, Lord, and confirm your word with signs, wonders, and miracles. May devils be cast out, unclean spirits leave, &gt;&gt; God and hearts transformed by the fire of God. &gt;&gt; We are dependent on you, Lord. Take me out of the way and be you, may you be glorified and magnified in our midst. And at the end of it, we'll give you all the praise and glory. We ask in Jesus name. Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you and welcome. God bless you. It's good to be here this morning. Greeting to all those connected to us on the internet. We welcome you to our Sunday morning service. So before you take your seats, I want you to turn your Bibles to St. John chapter 1, 2 Peter chapter 1, and St. Mark 16 for scripture reading. Oh, praise the name of the Lord. Hallelujah. Blessed be the name of the Lord. St. John chapter 1, we want to read from 29-37. 2 Peter chapter 1, we want to read from 16-21. And St. Mark chapter 16 15- 20. Oh, praise God. Just keep remembering prayer for those believers that are in Puerto Rico who up to two weeks now. Uh lights, no lights and water and everything else. It's terrible situation, but we trust God be their guide and comfort and help and shield. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. So, readings in John chapter 1 29. The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him and seeth, behold the lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world. This is he of whom I said, After me cometh a man which is preferred before me, for he was before me, and I knew him not, but he that should made manifest to Israel, therefore am I come baptizing with water. And John bear records, saying, I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it abodeed upon him. And I knew him not, but he that sent me to baptize with water. The same said unto me, Upon whom thou shall see the spirit, but he that sent me to baptize with water. The same said unto me shall see the spirit descending and rem. The same is the Holy Ghost. And I saw and bear record that this is the son of God. Again, the next day after John stood and two of the disciples and looking upon Jesus as he walked, he said, "Behold the lamb of God and the two disciples heard him speak and they followed Jesus." Second Peter 1, want to read from verse 16. For we have not followed connally devised fables when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of his majesty. For he received from God the Father honor and glory. When there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory, this is my beloved son in whom I am well pleased. And this voice which came from heaven, we heard when we would were with him in the holy mount. We have also a more sure word of prophecy where unto you do well that you may take heed as unto a light that shineth in the dark place until the day dawn and the day star arise in your hearts. Knowing this first that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation for the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost. Last scripture we're going to have Mark 16 verse 15 to 20 Jesus is speaking and he said unto them go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature. 16 He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved, but he that believeth not shall be damned. And these signs shall follow them that believe. In my name shall they cast out devils. They shall speak with new tongues. They shall take up serpents, and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them. They shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover. So then, after the Lord had spoken unto them, he was received up into heaven and sat on the right hand of God, and they went forth and preached everywhere, the Lord working with them, and confirming the word with signs following. Amen. May God bless his word. You may be seated. Oh, praise God. Hallelujah. Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Blessed be the name of the Lord. There's a song. Let's sing. Through it all. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Through it all, I learned &gt;&gt; I learned to trust in God. &gt;&gt; Huh? You love him? &gt;&gt; Through it all. [Music] &gt;&gt; I learn to depend upon his word. [Music] So what you going to do? &gt;&gt; Well, I thank God for the mountains. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I thank God for the valleys. I thank God for the things I've been through. If I never have a problem, oh, but if I never had a problem, &gt;&gt; I never know that God can solve them. I never know what faith in his word can do. That's why we sing through it all. through it all. &gt;&gt; I learn to trust I learn to trust in Jesus. I learn to trust in God. Oh, through it all. &gt;&gt; Through it all. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, I learned to depend upon his word. Are you going to depend upon his word this morning? &gt;&gt; Praise God. This morning I have a title and the title is a more sure word of prophecy. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A more sure word of prophecy. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I have a subject changing from the prophet to the prophecy. &gt;&gt; Amen. Another inspiration, the Lord himself. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God. The Lord &gt;&gt; himself. &gt;&gt; Have a context scripture and you have to find it is on 1 Thessalonians 4. It says, "But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them which are asleep." Talking about people that have died on and gone on before or loved ones that we sorrow, we sorrow not as others who have no hope. &gt;&gt; Amen. For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him. &gt;&gt; For this we say unto you by the will of the Lord, that we which alive remain shall not hinder them or prevent them which are asleep. For the Lord himself, &gt;&gt; shall descend from heaven with a shout &gt;&gt; with the voice of the archangel and with the trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first. Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And so shall we ever be with the Lord. Comfort one another with these words. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Comfort one another with these words. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is not the only world. &gt;&gt; We are leaving here. &gt;&gt; Ready or not, this is not the only world. We're going to be out of here &gt;&gt; soon. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Soon. That's how I feel. Let us say it soon. &gt;&gt; We'll be out of here. &gt;&gt; A thousand years is us one day in his sight. &gt;&gt; So 70 years is &gt;&gt; it's like a pith. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. And you feel you're here for a long time, right? You're not here for a long time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So do what you're supposed to do when you have the strength to do it. &gt;&gt; Do all that you could do. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do right because you choose to do right. &gt;&gt; When others do you wrong, still do right. Forgive because you choose to forgive. &gt;&gt; Love. When they hate you, still love. &gt;&gt; When you feel they don't deserve it, still do it. &gt;&gt; Do what's right. &gt;&gt; Do what's good. Do what's true. Amen. You're going to come out right. Oh, give the Lord some praises, people. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. This is brother Brandon from Message Experiences. He said, "Now, when the angel of the Lord speaks like that, there's nothing can stand before it." &gt;&gt; Amen. It is absolute &gt;&gt; my faith. Well, I know it's going to happen. There's no need of seeing any more of it. It's got to happen. &gt;&gt; If that person had been dead and in the grave for 20 years, &gt;&gt; and he said, "Go there and speak." &gt;&gt; I believe, &gt;&gt; amen. &gt;&gt; All heaven would shake out of its orbit &gt;&gt; before that prayer would be refused &gt;&gt; from being answered. &gt;&gt; God will do it. Now that is really when it is thus sayeth the lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So when a word is pronounced over your life &gt;&gt; and it's th does say the lord &gt;&gt; I don't care what the doctor say, &gt;&gt; what your mother say, what your father say, what the neighbor say, what the boss say. It has nothing to do. Not even your sin could stop it. It's thus sayeth the Lord. Your failures can't stop it. Your fears can't stop it. Your weakness can't stop it. What happened last night, last year, last 20 years, nothing going to stop it. He said in this word, he said, "My word shall not return unto me for it, &gt;&gt; but it shall accomplish &gt;&gt; the purpose that I set it for &gt;&gt; to accomplish." &gt;&gt; Could we give the Lord a praise offering? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; When we come to these meetings, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I detect vibrations. &gt;&gt; Sometimes I can ask the vibrations and God will honor my prayer. He will send it away. That's true. But if there's anything between you and God and you don't make it right, it's your faith that is weak. &gt;&gt; You're just waiting for a slow line for that to be cast away. Now, if your faith isn't right, it will return right back to you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I have moved out to a place for I have prayed for them and I've kept this back from you, but I pray for them coming through the line and set them down somewhere and walk back in 15 minutes time to check them and it'll be back on them again. &gt;&gt; So, in the spirit realm, what Abraham is talking about praying for people and tell them sit right there. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It leave them 15 minutes check it back on them again. Amen. &gt;&gt; Your faith is the only thing that can do you any good. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Your belief, your faith in God. See what I mean? Without faith is impossible. Is that true? Now, you believe it with all your heart and when you come true, you are going to be well and you will get well. If you don't believe it, it won't get well. No matter what happens, you won't be healed unless you believe it with all your heart. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God. How many want to believe this morning with all dear heart? &gt;&gt; God could heal your body. &gt;&gt; God could heal your spirit. And God could heal your soul. &gt;&gt; Could somebody say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I want to say that here again because some of you sick. Sick in body, sick in spirit, sick in mind, sick in heart, sick in soul, whatever. But God can heal you. God could deliver you. &gt;&gt; The demons that affecting your life could leave today. &gt;&gt; If you want deliverance, you could have that today. &gt;&gt; The word go forth with power. &gt;&gt; The word go forth with vindication. Praise God. Hallelujah. Praise. And today we have a sure word of prophecy. &gt;&gt; It's a sure word. It can't fail. &gt;&gt; God can't lie. God is not a man. Whatever he say got to come to pass. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Amen. &gt;&gt; As we said, the thing last service we preaching or when you get saved, God put a light in a little button, you get the Holy Ghost, a little small button. And as much as you surrender yourself, as much as you expand and get make room, that light will grow inside of you. As much you throw bitterness, you throw this, you're giving that light to take over your entire being &gt;&gt; until you reflect God. Isn't that right? So, there's nothing wrong with the light, is the reflection. Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; Praise the G. Praise the name. It's how much you yield yourself. &gt;&gt; Praise God. And that light is not to be choked. Isn't that right? That light is not even for a bushel. &gt;&gt; That light is not to be hidden. That light is a step forward. When God give you something, it's not for you. &gt;&gt; It's a shine to someone else. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the L. Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; And and and praise God. Blessed be. And in Luke 22:32, Jesus told Peter, "The devil want to save you like wheat." &gt;&gt; But I prayed for you that your faith &gt;&gt; fail not. &gt;&gt; Because faith is the currency &gt;&gt; that purchase everything from God. &gt;&gt; Not your long tears, not your balling and your beaten up. That doesn't move God. If you have faith behind your tears, that's fine. &gt;&gt; If you have faith behind your emotions, that is also fine. But the thing that going to move God is your faith. Amen. &gt;&gt; When God looking to answer, you're looking with the currency of faith. &gt;&gt; You don't you're not asking how long you're serving the Lord. Has nothing to do with that. &gt;&gt; You could be whatever. Once you have faith, there's got to be a response because faith is a six sense. Faith get come from down here. Faith from up there. Oh, give the Lord a shout &gt;&gt; in the house. Oh, glory to God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You're frightened, do it anyhow. You're fearful, step out anyhow. You're not sure you're going to work out, make a move anyhow. But don't stand there and die. &gt;&gt; Do something. Oh, give the Lord a shout &gt;&gt; in the house. Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Amen, brother Stephen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I refuse to stand still and die. &gt;&gt; I'm going to die if I had to be pressing. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory. I had to be pushing. I had to be overcoming. Got to do something. &gt;&gt; Doing nothing is not an option. &gt;&gt; Come on now. Doing nothing is not an option. &gt;&gt; These signs shall follow. Damn that believe. &gt;&gt; Are you a believer? &gt;&gt; Signs going to follow you. &gt;&gt; Are you a believer? &gt;&gt; Science's going to follow you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thursday night, I ask a question to the prayer meeting. What's choking you? What is choking your life? What is choking your Christian life? Your you walk something choking it. &gt;&gt; You don't have the flow. &gt;&gt; You don't have the freedom. You don't have the liberty. Something choking it. &gt;&gt; And the first parable Jesus gave was the son of man is a swer and the seed is the word. &gt;&gt; Some fell among thorns. &gt;&gt; Some fell on the wayside. Some on the wayside. Devil come and take it away. Some fell on rocks. They jump for a while. They shout for a while. They smile for a while. Then they gone &gt;&gt; because they have no roots. Amen. &gt;&gt; So it means there's a process &gt;&gt; for this word to take a hold. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It have to take roots. &gt;&gt; You can't just come and hear and devil take it out your head. &gt;&gt; Take it out your mind. &gt;&gt; But you have to have roots. &gt;&gt; And when they get roots, the devil can't go down inside that. &gt;&gt; It's too deep inside there. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; What the devil could do is tie up &gt;&gt; with vines of cares of natural stuff. Tie up &gt;&gt; that you try and get choked. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He can't stop you coming forth. Amen. &gt;&gt; And we say brick producer focal corn with one grain on it. You don't want that.

As was in days of Lot, so shall it be in the coming of days of the son of man. They eat, they drank, normal living. They married, they giving in marriage until the day &gt;&gt; that came out. &gt;&gt; So there was no visible sign of anything happening in the spiritual realm. &gt;&gt; People was going to work, going and draw the pig, go and pay the NIS, go and pay the tax, go and buy this, go and buy groceries, go and put out the garbage and so on. Normal living, &gt;&gt; normal living. But in the spirit realm, something was happening &gt;&gt; because there's a prophecy that have to stand. &gt;&gt; Nothing going to change that prophecy. In the spirit realm, something was happening. &gt;&gt; So don't just sit around and say normal living. You come here this morning, you dress your clothes this morning, you come to church this morning, normal living. That's why you come to give God praise. You come to get out the normal. God going to mash up your normal. Oh, say amen somebody. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. Say normal. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen.

When them brothers saw Messiah coming donkey, they thosanna hosana hosana atmosphere in Jerusalem. All them priests, who is this? Who is this? But there was a bunch of people that was all excited with the faith to announce the heraldine of Messiah coming lowly upon a donkey. And one day the Holy Ghost going to come riding on in. It's prophesy. Praise God. He shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire. And this morning we have a show of prophecy. Oh, give the Lord some shouts in the house. &gt;&gt; I say the spirit is upon you this morning. [Music] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's why you can't afford to use the intellect. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Why would we be preaching that this morning? If I use that scripture this morning, &gt;&gt; I don't even know why. &gt;&gt; I don't question why &gt;&gt; it come and I come and speak it. &gt;&gt; You might feel I supposed to say something else and preach something else or what not. Sorry. This is what I offer this morning. And you have to ride with it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise God. They eat, they drank, they bought, they sold. &gt;&gt; But something was happening. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Abraham the elected. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Called out. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; By Elohim. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; On the back side of the desert, &gt;&gt; revealing the hidden plans, &gt;&gt; revealing the hidden mystery &gt;&gt; that Sodom is finished. &gt;&gt; It is judged &gt;&gt; just to be sentenced. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He says, "Shall I hide from Abraham what I'm about to do?" &gt;&gt; He said, "I can't hide it." &gt;&gt; Seeing is the air of the earth. I can't hold back from my elect what I'm about to unfold. What I'm about to reveal, I have to reveal the prophecy. And the angel said, "Seal not the saints of the prophecy of this book because the time is at hand. Time for the seals to break that you could see your name and see where you are prophesied to be here in this hour to be anointed. &gt;&gt; Oh, and commission.

He don't know who we are. He don't know who's we are. He don't know where we come from. He don't know where we are going. He don't know what we doing this morning. Wonderful. &gt;&gt; You sin, you fail, you fall, you did this, that the other. That is not God's problem. You know, &gt;&gt; because God is not now choosing you. &gt;&gt; God have no interview now interviewing how long you have been sinning, how long you have been failing, how long you have been falling. God not in that know God. If God choose you, he choose you before &gt;&gt; before &gt;&gt; the foundation of the world.

[Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; William Brandham came to fulfill Luke 17:30. Even thus shall the son be revealed. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And it's powerful because after Luke 17:30, Luke 18, Jesus asks a question, Solomon just revealed in Luke 17. &gt;&gt; Luke 18, he asked a question. When the son of man cometh, &gt;&gt; shall he find &gt;&gt; the currency on the earth? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Or are we going to lose it? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Are you going to get the currency of faith? Because see, faith have to be exercised. &gt;&gt; Faith is not talk. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. that talk. &gt;&gt; Faith is something different. &gt;&gt; Like when God tell Joshua, take the people over. He never went there before. &gt;&gt; Cross over Jordan. He never did that before. &gt;&gt; When he ready to cross and Baram says the elders came to him and tell him if he wait any longer the water will go down low and they wait across water. He said thank your elders. &gt;&gt; Then God tell him Joshua tell them three days we going over. &gt;&gt; Three days. &gt;&gt; He don't know how yet but he giving instruction structure. Three days. &gt;&gt; Three days. &gt;&gt; Go touch your wife. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God. Three days we crossing over. &gt;&gt; There was a preparation to cross. &gt;&gt; Could somebody give a shout on that? &gt;&gt; You're not crossing just like that. There's a preparation. And the saraphs from of the altar, but the coals come to prepare you by fire. &gt;&gt; Come on. Come on. Come on. You're going to get you're going to be filled. &gt;&gt; How many want the fire of God? And I love those Levites, man. &gt;&gt; When they take up the ark and Joshua and they say, "Match, we're going across Jordan." Them guys are watching with their senses &gt;&gt; and say, "You see how high the water is toward was the highest, &gt;&gt; them guys take up the ark and start to march down to Jordan because Joshua said so." And if God said it, &gt;&gt; we going to cross. &gt;&gt; That's a sure word of prophecy. We are going to cross. &gt;&gt; You are going to cross. We prophesy. [Applause] [Music] Oh, give the Lord a shout in the house. Let me see them. And those brothers, the Bible said when their foot touch, &gt;&gt; it's a good thing they no bogus and impersonating Levi then &gt;&gt; because man watch out and run back and leave drop down the ark. But them guys was trained. &gt;&gt; They were anointed. They were under obedience. They wasn't doing their own thing. The ark had to go in front. You can't go in front of the ark. &gt;&gt; The ark have to go in front. &gt;&gt; When going in front, the devil in trouble. When God in front, no weapon formed against you could prosper. When God in front, oh, give the Lord a shout in the house. &gt;&gt; Let God come in front. &gt;&gt; These Levites, they walking down to Jordan and as soon as the foot touch the river, it open up. &gt;&gt; It open up. You don't have to wait to see it open up. Keep walking. Let your foot touch. Face your trials. Face your situation. &gt;&gt; Deal with it. &gt;&gt; When the son of cometh, &gt;&gt; shall he find faith &gt;&gt; on the earth? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Or would you let them bandits rob you of defeat &gt;&gt; that was once delivered to the saints? And William Brandon was sent to turn our hearts back to the faith that we could have purchasing power. &gt;&gt; We could be rich in faith. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Them brothers with the with the man who was sick on the pallet and they tear up the roof. &gt;&gt; They had faith &gt;&gt; because they was bringing the friend to Jesus and the crowd was stick around the house and they said, "We are not turning back. &gt;&gt; We can't get through the front door. We can't get through the back door. We can't get through the window. We going to take the roof off. &gt;&gt; And I'm telling you, when you are determined, when something anchor in your soul that you have to get your breakthrough, you don't care who in front of you, who behind you, who either side of you, that has nothing to do with it. &gt;&gt; You've got to have that kind of determination. &gt;&gt; We know the story. The tear up the roof let down the man. That's it. &gt;&gt; How you going to have all that faith and don't get a response? &gt;&gt; Oh, you pray. &gt;&gt; They tear up the roof and let him down right in front of Jesus. &gt;&gt; Right in front of Jesus. &gt;&gt; That is faith. &gt;&gt; That is faith. Those guys didn't care nothing. They didn't care how much expensive the roof is, how to replace the roof. You see, faith does make you do things. It look like you're acting crazy. &gt;&gt; It is make you believe things that are not &gt;&gt; as though they were. &gt;&gt; It is make you see what your eyes can't see. Let's make you touch what your hands can't touch. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. The eyes of faith is powerful. The eyes of faith say, "Praise God. Red Sea open up." A sea, not a ravine, not a river. The whole Red Sea, you have to believe. Stand still and see the salvation of our God. &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord some praises, people. Give the Lord some praises, people. [Applause] Do you know what that prophet prophesied? &gt;&gt; He prophesied missing limbs &gt;&gt; will be restored. [Applause] &gt;&gt; You know how that's going to grow people faith? &gt;&gt; When they see somebody who have no foot, get back a foot. &gt;&gt; Get back your hand. &gt;&gt; Missing limbs, you lost a kidney, you lost whatever it is. And God restore that. &gt;&gt; That is enough faith to make you be changed in the moment. Then you believe that this rapture thing is divine healing &gt;&gt; on turbo. &gt;&gt; This is the the rapture is accelerated divine healing. &gt;&gt; Is your body actually being changed? And if you can have faith to be healed now, how you going to have faith that this mortal will put on immortality? &gt;&gt; And you're going to see the grim reaper and push his is reaping thing and push it aside. Not even death going to stop this bride. &gt;&gt; You walking on death trying to stop you. Push him. Death can't touch you. We shall not all sleep. But we shall be changed for the Lord himself descends. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. There's no pastor descending, &gt;&gt; no elder descending. &gt;&gt; This the Lord himself descending with a shout &gt;&gt; to get his pride out. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So, what's choking you this morning? &gt;&gt; The cares of life, &gt;&gt; Facebook, internet, YouTube. What's choking you this morning? &gt;&gt; What is taking up your time? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. and affecting the flow of God &gt;&gt; in your life. Shake it off. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You have to. You must. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. You have to. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You must. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Don't let them choke. Cut down the vines. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now, the word prophesy or the brand for why we not denomination does not mean to teach. &gt;&gt; All right. The prophecy means either to tell an experience under inspiration or foretell something that is fixing to take place. &gt;&gt; All right? &gt;&gt; And in the old testament they could never speak out in the building, speak out in the church and congregation as a teacher but Anna men and men in the temple they were prophetist. Women can be prophetist today absolutely but not teachers behind the platform and so forth. So therefore the Bible give a scripture young men shall prophesy. &gt;&gt; Amen. Isn't that I bought my spirit and the spirit of prophecy &gt;&gt; going to return. &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? And brother Brandon, he was a vindicated prophet. &gt;&gt; So he brought vindicated word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that word is a more sure word &gt;&gt; of prophecy &gt;&gt; of prophecy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because he went up into the intelligence of God &gt;&gt; and pulled down the word &gt;&gt; for the entire age. Amen. &gt;&gt; So when he pulled down your word, your word, &gt;&gt; did you get that? &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham had to pull out your word for you to be here today. &gt;&gt; The only reason you are here today, he pulled out your word. And your word came to you. The devil is a liar this morning. Let the devil know he's a liar this morning. How could brother pull down your word? Revelation 10:1. I saw &gt;&gt; a mighty angel &gt;&gt; coming down from heaven with a cloud &gt;&gt; rainbow over his head &gt;&gt; with a little book open. &gt;&gt; That book was in heaven, &gt;&gt; but he had to bring it down. &gt;&gt; And the word come to a prophet. You have to have a seventh angel standing on the earth to get your name. &gt;&gt; Because the angel, which angel? This mighty angel, &gt;&gt; one with the sweat back wings. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; One with the seven seal. &gt;&gt; Even Christ himself. &gt;&gt; That mighty angel &gt;&gt; bringing out your name. &gt;&gt; Your word, &gt;&gt; your name was in the book. &gt;&gt; Seven thunders. &gt;&gt; Throw their voices out. to go across the entire earth. &gt;&gt; Seven spirits &gt;&gt; to sweep across the entire earth &gt;&gt; to find your germ &gt;&gt; to find your gene to find your seed. &gt;&gt; He has found you. &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord some worship. &gt;&gt; Give the Lord some praise this people. &gt;&gt; Be seated. [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; When Prince Williams and Prince Charles and Prince whoever prince was born, &gt;&gt; they didn't automatically know their royalty. &gt;&gt; They were born as babies. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Some nanny or whatever they call them come to nurse them and see about them and train them. As they get older, &gt;&gt; they have to be training adequate &gt;&gt; as to who they are. their lineage. &gt;&gt; What they entitled to, &gt;&gt; what is offered to them, &gt;&gt; they are not commoners. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; They are not ordinary people. &gt;&gt; They are royalty. &gt;&gt; And the prophet said as we near the hedge, &gt;&gt; we become a super race. &gt;&gt; We not normal. &gt;&gt; We not commoners. &gt;&gt; We not ordinary people. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Jesus said &gt;&gt; these signs shall follow those people &gt;&gt; them that believe. &gt;&gt; We are not normal. &gt;&gt; If we lay hands on upon the sick, &gt;&gt; that's a prophecy. &gt;&gt; They shall &gt;&gt; recover, &gt;&gt; must recover &gt;&gt; because the anointing &gt;&gt; going to be there. And the Bible said, "The Lord himself &gt;&gt; went everywhere &gt;&gt; with them, &gt;&gt; confirming the word &gt;&gt; with signs, &gt;&gt; with wonders, with miracles. Maybe it might start today. &gt;&gt; Maybe it might start with you, &gt;&gt; but it will start." &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord a shout in the house. &gt;&gt; I am believing the Lord himself among you. Put a trouble among us. Oh, praise God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let's go a little further. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But Brandon, I mean, God is own interpreter. He said we live in a day of confusion. We're living in a day when men and women hardly know what to do. &gt;&gt; My God. &gt;&gt; Everything seems to be in turmoil. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's many ways to look at it. Now, God cannot judge a people righteously unless there have to be a standard &gt;&gt; that he has to judge them by. &gt;&gt; And the Bible says he will judge all men by Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; And Jesus Christ is the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's in John 1:1. In the beginning was the word. The word was with God and the word was God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the word is made flesh and dwell among us. What I mean that his thoughts a word and a thought expressed. Then it was in his thinking. Let there be let there be. And now remember you Christians, here we go. Were his thoughts before there was a world? [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. 20% say amen. &gt;&gt; I'm talking about you. &gt;&gt; I'm talking about a prophet catching the mind of God, &gt;&gt; bringing your word to you. &gt;&gt; I don't care if you smoke, you drink, your pipe. I don't care what you do. &gt;&gt; I don't care where. It has nothing to do with that. &gt;&gt; If you for to come true, &gt;&gt; you have to be taught of God in God's mind. &gt;&gt; It's God thinking. I don't care if you're rebellious. Yeah. Want God.

When it was whatever, he couldn't lose you. &gt;&gt; Oh, he can lose you now. &gt;&gt; Give the Lord a shout right now. &gt;&gt; Give him a praise offering right now. Even if it don't feel like it, still do it. &gt;&gt; Praise God. And give the devil a mind battle. Give him some praises right now. Give the Lord some praises. &gt;&gt; Oh glory. See it.

Where's the where's the offering? &gt;&gt; He said God provide for himself. &gt;&gt; When Abraham tied down Isaac coming along with knife and God said hold your hand. Look it ram right there.

Some people don't like to make no sacrifices, but God has wanted to make a sacrifice. &gt;&gt; And then he come to confirm the sacrifice of faith that you're making your life. &gt;&gt; Abraham knew he was giving up his testimony. He wait 25 years for his son and go to kill him. &gt;&gt; And he wasn't holding back. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; He wasn't taking that ship to Tashes. He wasn't holding back. He was coming down and God said, "Hold your hand. I know you love me." &gt;&gt; And because of that, I will bless your seed. &gt;&gt; And here we are today &gt;&gt; possessing the gates of the enemy. &gt;&gt; Amen. by prophecy. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You might feel like a possessor yet, but you will be. &gt;&gt; Cuz that's your destiny. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You didn't hear what I'm saying? &gt;&gt; That is your destiny. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Think about it now.

That is what that is the whole thing. The people say interpretation. I was speaking here not long ago in a meeting a man said brother Brandham you have the wrong interpretation. You don't interpret that right. We go to the Methodist they say the Baptist don't interpret it right. The Pentecostal don't and so wonders don't and so on. God is his own interpreter. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He don't need anybody to interpret for him. He does his own interpreting. &gt;&gt; Amen. Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now Peter said when God said let there be light and there was light. That's the interpretation to it. When God said anything, it was manifested. Then that is God's interpretation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So you don't have to query and question too much. Just see what God said and see how it's interpreted. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right now people arguing over scripture, over words &gt;&gt; and so forth, over dictionary and Greek and all that. But that is not the manifestation. &gt;&gt; The manifestation is the interpretation. &gt;&gt; Amen. So that is where the seed which is you come into being. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the name of the Lord. So God doesn't need anybody to interpret it. When God speaks and it's manifested, that's the interpretation of his word. &gt;&gt; But before it is manifested, he sends out it as a prophecy. &gt;&gt; A virgin shall conceive. &gt;&gt; It's hanging there &gt;&gt; 400 years. &gt;&gt; Staying right there. &gt;&gt; You could read it. &gt;&gt; They're speaking it. &gt;&gt; It's got to come to pass. &gt;&gt; That prophecy is waiting for Mary. That prophecy is circling the whole earth. &gt;&gt; That prophecy can't drop down &gt;&gt; until Mary come on the scene. &gt;&gt; And when Mary come, the prophecy hangs over Mary. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Wherever she go, &gt;&gt; the prophecy going. &gt;&gt; That's the virgin. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; She's not ready when she's 9 years old. She's not ready when she's 11 years old. She's have to be ready when she's ready. &gt;&gt; Say amen, somebody. &gt;&gt; And when you are ready, you are ready for your prophecy, &gt;&gt; which is your word. There's a prophecy for you. &gt;&gt; Oh, do we believe that? Do you believe that &gt;&gt; there's a prophecy for you? [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; So when Mary time came &gt;&gt; angel had to come to Mary &gt;&gt; had to come &gt;&gt; not to June &gt;&gt; not to John &gt;&gt; not to this one and that one &gt;&gt; Mary &gt;&gt; Hail Mary &gt;&gt; thou are highly favored. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The Lord is with thee. &gt;&gt; Blessed are thou among women. You have been elected. You are being selected. You are being chosen to bring forth Messiah. &gt;&gt; There's only one Mary. There's only one bride. There's only one you. Give the Lord some praises, people. [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; Now, if you stay in Trinidad, you ain't get nothing else. &gt;&gt; You got to translate with me &gt;&gt; in the word. You have to either go Jerusalem. You have to come down here now. &gt;&gt; You have to come and see Jesus coming to be baptized by John. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God. You have to see the transition of all what the Old Testament was prophesying. Messiah coming. Messiah coming. Oh God, it's taking so long. But he's still coming &gt;&gt; because the prophecy say Messiah coming. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. 400 years no prophet. Here come John like a wise man. Repent &gt;&gt; for the kingdom of heaven is at hand. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; John is anointed. &gt;&gt; John is on fire. John like a wman. Repent. &gt;&gt; John is anointed ass in a hole &gt;&gt; because glory to God. He is the voice of one crying. in the wilderness. Prepare ye &gt;&gt; the way of the Lord because the Lord himself, &gt;&gt; he is coming. &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord a shout. &gt;&gt; And God sent William Brandham, &gt;&gt; that Elijah to prepare the way for the Lord himself. &gt;&gt; Oh, amen, mother of heaven. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Not for a bunch of preachers, not for no bunch of elders, not to for to play in t and church, but for the Lord himself.

What people getting conviction something happening a man can't be preaching like that &gt;&gt; and nothing happening. Amen. Something happening. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You can't figure it out but something happening &gt;&gt; and they coming and getting baptized. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And as they baptize so you say for fruit. &gt;&gt; Don't come and know just this this kind of bogus repentance. &gt;&gt; Make sure there's a change after. &gt;&gt; Don't get soaked. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Come for a bath and you see &gt;&gt; my God. &gt;&gt; You come to acknowledge your sins. They come to acknowledge your wrong. They come to acknowledge to turn around. That's what repent means. To turn around. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; John is baptized in souls after soul of soul. &gt;&gt; And Jesus is in line. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He breaking the line and say, "I am Jesus." Is who I am? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Ordinary man. &gt;&gt; But 30 years old. &gt;&gt; Ordinary man. &gt;&gt; Ordinary man. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; 12 years. 18 years of silence &gt;&gt; from 12 to 18. 18 years &gt;&gt; of Jesus in the scriptures, &gt;&gt; no signs, no wonders, no vindication, no fire, no nothing, &gt;&gt; just an ordinary man. &gt;&gt; And he's just walking down to the Jordan. &gt;&gt; John see him &gt;&gt; and John said, "I have need to be baptized." &gt;&gt; Because he see the sign. The sign said, "There's one upon you whom see the spirit descending." &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And &gt;&gt; remaining. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's the one. Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't just look for the spirit to jump on because sometime the wolf under there &gt;&gt; as the spirit drop spirit gone. &gt;&gt; So you're looking for something that remains. &gt;&gt; That's Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It remains on the lamb. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It remains when I see faith, virtue, knowledge, temperance, patience, courtiness, brotherly kindness, charity, the love of God, the token, the spirit dynamics, the cap, the love. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Remain. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; That's the house. That's the temple. That's the cap. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord some praises, people. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let's go a little further. &gt;&gt; My so long. &gt;&gt; You say all you say when God makes a promise. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; He is loted his word to each age. Watch. And God always sends on the scene down to the Old Testament new prophets. And the word of the Lord comes to the prophet. And how does it do it? It manifests the word of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; God's manifestation tells whether it is right or wrong. Nobody has to interpret it. The word interprets itself. &gt;&gt; God promise it and there it happens. Notice here from see the discrepancy an angel uh in verse 14. The two spirit will be so close in the last days. He could not depend upon some certain church to separate them. So he said the angels to separate them. An angel is coming to bring the separation between right and wrong. And no one can do that but the angel of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Notice he said the swers were and what the seed was. The swer was the son of God who went forth sowing seed and enemy came behind him which was the devil and sw the seed of discrepancy. &gt;&gt; So this is a different parable now from the tears and not the tears the choking of the seed and so on falling on good grounds and so on like that. There's different. This is where the son of man sw the seed and the enemy came and sow seed in the field &gt;&gt; and then both jump up &gt;&gt; looking for rain to fall &gt;&gt; and then one say should we cut down the tears of no no leave them alone leave them alone them grow together &gt;&gt; until &gt;&gt; time of harvest. &gt;&gt; Let them grow together. Let them shout and say amen together until &gt;&gt; the time of harvest. &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh glory. Now the seed of God, the word of God, the word is a seed and every seed will bring forth after its kind. Now if the Christian, the children of God, the children of the kingdom has become the seed of God, &gt;&gt; then they must be the word of God, the word of God manifested in the age that they're living in. &gt;&gt; So he is prophesying that the children will become the seed. &gt;&gt; And that when the children becomes the word, &gt;&gt; so you becomes the word. Now you can understand how the spirit and the bride will say come &gt;&gt; because the bride will be the word &gt;&gt; and the spirit will come upon the bride &gt;&gt; to give the bride a voice. &gt;&gt; The bride have to be given a voice &gt;&gt; not just one voice. Seven voices &gt;&gt; will become one voice. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The voice of the archangel &gt;&gt; going to be in a bride. &gt;&gt; Jesus does all three. &gt;&gt; The shout, the voice and the trump. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon brought the shout. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And prophesy about the coming voice. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You will see the appearing of the Lord right here among us. &gt;&gt; You're going to see signs, one of the miracle. &gt;&gt; I can't stop it. You can't stop it. No man could stop it. God spoke it. So shall it be. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Right now, you are under prophecy. All these years, your coming is not in vain. We have not be leave fables. &gt;&gt; No, no, no. We have a sure word of prophecy. We have not believed in vain. &gt;&gt; It shall surely come to pass. Oh, glory to God. Amen. &gt;&gt; When Noah came, he was the seed of go of of God, the word for that age. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; When Moses came, he could not come with Moses, Noah's message. It wouldn't work. He was a seed at that time. Now, we have lived through Luther's age, Wesley age, Pentecostal age. Each age has his promise and the people of the age that manifest &gt;&gt; that promise word &gt;&gt; is the seed of that age. Amen. &gt;&gt; So our age, you have a word of brotherly kindness, &gt;&gt; spirit of forgiveness, &gt;&gt; that must be manifested, &gt;&gt; not just revealed &gt;&gt; but manifested. &gt;&gt; The people that manifest that brotherly love, they are the seed &gt;&gt; of the age. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because brotherly love is the thing that attract the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; That's right. Right after brotherly kindness is that slot called Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. And even when a woman is going to bring birth, giving birth to a baby, in the book we tell you read, &gt;&gt; things that are to be, &gt;&gt; he's a sweet spirit comes around a woman because she's about to get another spirit for that baby. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelu. She said, I don't care how mean the woman is, how evil a woman is, when she's about to give birth, a sweet spirit comes around the woman. &gt;&gt; That sweet spirit of brotherly kindness have to come around this woman, &gt;&gt; have to come around this bride. Is she going to bring forth &gt;&gt; that Jesus Christ baby? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So the more evil and angry and jealous and hate for somebody else is you know no baby's coming. &gt;&gt; False pregnancy. &gt;&gt; My God. &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah. Praise God. They had to go and rebong and go again. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But when that baby is coming &gt;&gt; a sweet spirit. &gt;&gt; Spirit of forgiveness. Amen. &gt;&gt; You can't hold ought. &gt;&gt; They can't hold grudges. It just won't hold. They stop blaming others. There a lot of people have a gift of blaming. They blame the mother, the father, the brother, the sister, the uncle, the job, the boss, everybody but themselves. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelu ever making excuses. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Somebody says something to me. Um, father, a son says, "Father, daddy, how to choose a a sister, how to choose somebody nice?" He says, "Son, forget about how to choose a nice woman, how to choose a nice girl or whatnot. Work on yourself. &gt;&gt; You try to become a better man. &gt;&gt; You work on you and a better man will choose a better woman. Oh, give the Lord some praises, people. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Don't try to work on the lady. &gt;&gt; You work on you. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Work on yourself. &gt;&gt; Become that man of God. Become that son of God. &gt;&gt; Reflect Christ. Reflect something. Reflect principle. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. And people going to respect you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You a woman, you're a sister. You act right, dress right, and what? People are going to respect you. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Hallelujah. Praise God. Don't be coming like the rest of the world. &gt;&gt; Don't be a photocopy. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Whatever they wearing out there, you want to wear too, forget that. &gt;&gt; Let people ask why you dress how you dress. &gt;&gt; Why you dress differently? &gt;&gt; Let them ask why you dress so different. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That they want to know the hope of your calling. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the name of the Lord. So therefore, those that manifest the promise, the manifestation of the Holy Spirit operating through his children is those seeds of the kingdom. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Of that age, the manifestation of the Holy Spirit operating and the Holy Spirit cannot behave in one person and misbehave in another. &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit makes you conform to its nature, &gt;&gt; to its behavior. And one of the signs of the Holy Spirit is somebody able to repent and make things right and humble themselves. The first sign of the Holy Ghost is humility. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Not you fighting up and carrying on to prove your point and debate and argue to prove how right you are. No. When the Holy Spirit come, it makes you humble yourself. &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says the day last day the true bride will come to the headstone will be a super race. as she nears a headstone. They will be much like him. So much like him that they will be in his very image in order to be united with him. They will be one. &gt;&gt; They will be there we go. Here we go. The very manifestation of the word of the living God. &gt;&gt; Denomination can never produce this. &gt;&gt; So Satan encountered the manifestation of the living God before &gt;&gt; in Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. and he got shocked &gt;&gt; and he take a break for a long time. He went for a season. &gt;&gt; So when he come back to this bride, he get shock again. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because that voltage is passing through that bride. &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah. After jail overcoming the devil in the wilderness without without demonstration, one sense of power, the Bible said he returned in the power of the spirit. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And then he went to the temple and found the place where it was written. Yeah. &gt;&gt; So Jesus himself had to find his scriptures. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What about you? &gt;&gt; You have to find your word. &gt;&gt; There's a word for you. You have to find your scripture. &gt;&gt; But around found the scripture. Revelation 10:7, Malachi 4, Luke 17:30. Put around found the scripture and you have to connect with that to produce that. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. You have to find your scripture and connect to that. &gt;&gt; You could live harder than that. &gt;&gt; Come on now. Come on now. You don't have to live like a devil. You don't have to live nasty and bad ways and bad behavior. You don't have to live like that. You can live higher than that. &gt;&gt; That's why Jesus could tell the woman, "Go and sin no more." &gt;&gt; Go. You're not a sin no more because you could live higher than that. &gt;&gt; There's a higher calling. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Come on. You have a higher calling. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; If you're looking for a job and they send for you for interview, how you go to the interview? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Like Raga Muffin, &gt;&gt; you ain't want that job. You snatch a hat and you just put on a new shoes that get &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You never dress or tie your or shirt you just throw on like that. You're not even iron or presses. &gt;&gt; And they walk into the interview room. They have six people. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Two just watching you alone. &gt;&gt; They not asking any questions. They just watching and soon you walk in the door they say no. All the interview after it's just formality. &gt;&gt; By sight they say no. So you have a job to be in the front desk to meet people what not and they come to you with a hard face like if you vex with interviewers like if you want to interview them they say no why they want a certain quality &gt;&gt; they want a certain face they want a certain behavior &gt;&gt; that's why they ask certain questions &gt;&gt; so God have his interview too &gt;&gt; amen &gt;&gt; God have his way of testing &gt;&gt; that's it &gt;&gt; that's why every son of God come to God not be tested Glory going to say, "Hey, is it you?" Look the ring sign. Look the checkbook. &gt;&gt; Who you got to check you out &gt;&gt; to see the son is qualified &gt;&gt; because you have all kind of sons. &gt;&gt; Yes. God want the right kind &gt;&gt; right kind of a son &gt;&gt; that he could give the checkbook to say son. Whoever you high is higher. Who your fire is fire. I know you have my mind. I know you have my way. I know you have my nature. I know you're going to think like me, act like me. &gt;&gt; When a father had that confidence, he could turn his back on the job, turn his back on the company, I know his son going to run things well. &gt;&gt; Come on now. Because that son was about his father's business &gt;&gt; and Jesus said, "I must be about my father's business." &gt;&gt; Oh, come on now. Are you about God's business? If you take care of God business, go take care about your business. &gt;&gt; Come on now. Push for God. Push for the kingdom. Oh, glory to God. We taking some more.

It fell from six sense to five senses in the flesh. And there were sex coming in. But Adam was supposed to speak for his word. Speak a son into existence by spoken word. Eve conceived and produced a next son. spoken word, son. &gt;&gt; That's why the first thing he has come, you must be born again by the word, by the spirit. You have to come back to spoken word &gt;&gt; because that is how we were supposed to be born. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. But because man fell, it come to this flesh thing. But we're going back to spoken word thing. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The second son spoken word Jesus Christ was given a bride like Adam. But before he could marry her, she fallen. She was put on free moral agency like Adam wife was to believe God's word and live doubt it and die. She did she died. No from a little group of the true seed of the word. God represent Christ a beloved bride. She's a virgin of his word.

God could speak to you. &gt;&gt; You have the ability to hear &gt;&gt; God's voice. Oh, glory to God. Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; You don't have to walk in darkness. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You could hear God's voice. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. &gt;&gt; And I love this part. The word watch from a little group of the right. Okay. By and through the bride with members of the bride will fulfill all that was promised of God to be manifest in this in the virgin. The word of promise came to the Virgin Mary. &gt;&gt; Here we go. &gt;&gt; The word of the promise came to the Virgin Mary. But that word of promise was he himself &gt;&gt; to be made manifest. &gt;&gt; I love this. &gt;&gt; He himself acted at that time &gt;&gt; to fulfill his own word. &gt;&gt; So the word was he that he promised &gt;&gt; was he's a to manifest himself. &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? Amen. &gt;&gt; And at that time, the Lord himself acted on his own word &gt;&gt; to bring his word to pass &gt;&gt; in Mary's life. &gt;&gt; What do you think he going to do in this hour? &gt;&gt; When the Lord himself &gt;&gt; descend from heaven with a shout, &gt;&gt; he wasn't chopping no elder, no minister, and no different one. He descended from heaven with a shout. &gt;&gt; There was a prophet on the earth. He took the prophet off the earth. But the Lord himself, that angel is still on the earth. That's why brother Brandham said, "When I am gone, healing is not gone. When I am gone, deliverance is not gone. When I am gone, breakthrough is not gone." Come on. Because the Lord himself has descended. The Lord is among us. The Lord is with you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You are blessed this morning. &gt;&gt; You are blessed to be in the spirit. &gt;&gt; You are blessed to be in the atmosphere. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God.

Every Sabbath &gt;&gt; hundreds of babies &gt;&gt; are coming to the temple &gt;&gt; being offered up. &gt;&gt; But this Sabbath &gt;&gt; Anna in the corner &gt;&gt; and because she in the atmosphere, &gt;&gt; Holy Spirit, &gt;&gt; tell her to move. &gt;&gt; Flying woman &gt;&gt; in the spirit, &gt;&gt; flying woman, &gt;&gt; pass in this one, &gt;&gt; pass in that one, pass in this church, pass in that church. You may be seated. &gt;&gt; Simeon, Lord, &gt;&gt; Simeon, old man. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Have a sure word of prophecy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Sure word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You shall not see death. &gt;&gt; Until you see the Lord Christ, &gt;&gt; this chariot try to bounce him down. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This brick fall right in front of his foot. &gt;&gt; Shall not see death. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brick fall behind him. &gt;&gt; Horse.

He don't break it by no oak tree. &gt;&gt; He don't break it by no mango tree. Messiah ain't coming there. &gt;&gt; Daily Messiah have to come to the temple. &gt;&gt; According to the rules, &gt;&gt; according to the law, &gt;&gt; Simeon is in position. &gt;&gt; He just waited. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. &gt;&gt; You will be seated. &gt;&gt; He's in the atmosphere. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Never about Simeon wife, but maybe she didn't make her a good coffee that day. &gt;&gt; Maybe she didn't bring her a good sandwich that day. Maybe he was supposed to get upset, but he said, "Woman, I have appointment." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Maybe the break come out too late &gt;&gt; and he leave without eating at home. But he was making sure he missing the opportunity &gt;&gt; to be a witness of the fulfillment of prophecy. &gt;&gt; So Simeon is there. Here come Mary and Joseph. They may even see the man. &gt;&gt; They walking and minding their own business. They just pass seem normal, normal, normal. But in the spirit realm when they pass, Holy Spirit touch him. &gt;&gt; Holy Spirit move now. &gt;&gt; Messiah is here. &gt;&gt; The Lord himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The Lord himself has come down. &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You may be seated. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You know what I like about God? &gt;&gt; He doesn't give you all the answers. &gt;&gt; He doesn't give you all the unfolding things. See, me and I to walk now. You don't know who is who yet. I said a baby's pass and he had to walk led by the spirit. &gt;&gt; Same spirit that reveal, &gt;&gt; same spirit. You see, prophecy is dynamics in spirit form. &gt;&gt; Dynamics in the form of prophecy because the word is spirit. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's why when people reject the word, they don't understand. &gt;&gt; They're rejecting the spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because the word is wordings. the spirit in word form. &gt;&gt; So that spirit of prophecy that was upon Simeon led him straight to the Christ. &gt;&gt; Then he could say, "Lord, let your servant depart in peace &gt;&gt; for my eyes have seen &gt;&gt; my salvation." &gt;&gt; Glory of the Lord. &gt;&gt; He could rest now. &gt;&gt; He could finish now. &gt;&gt; He could say goodbye world. &gt;&gt; Good morning glory.

But David know he had a that throne belong to him.

They would have to fight and wrestle and battle.

Hallelujah. Maybe season when Jesus crossed over to Gdara, met that man in the tomb, thousand devils. &gt;&gt; That man by choice, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; choose the crowd. Lord have mercy upon me. &gt;&gt; Free me. Free me. Free me. Free me. All them devils inside of him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Trying to hold him back. &gt;&gt; Man is naked. The man stripping himself.

The Lord take it away. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name &gt;&gt; of the Lord. Oh, praise God. Praise God. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Listen to this one. Baram said in the evidence of resurrection, there'll be a day that won't be need night nor day. The prophet said it will just be hearing the word &gt;&gt; with no manifestation &gt;&gt; but in the evening time &gt;&gt; it shall be light. &gt;&gt; So that day on right is not there's no manifestation. &gt;&gt; John had no manifestation. He was just to make a way for the Messiah. &gt;&gt; Jesus came he had manifestation. &gt;&gt; And after 2,000 years preacher of preaching the word the church still don't believe. But the even light has come &gt;&gt; the manifestation of the resurrection. There's coming another evening like in this message. But abandon was the Eden light. &gt;&gt; He manifested Christ. There's going to be a bride manifestation of Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In this message, not playing back books and tapes. A bride manifestation of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; It going to shake the whole world. &gt;&gt; It will be a shout of the king &gt;&gt; in the camp. &gt;&gt; It going to be Jesus Christ walking in it. &gt;&gt; The shout of the king going to be in that camp. &gt;&gt; You will hear a shout in the house. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Notice it was a short message talking about Jesus. It wasn't long. He didn't stay long with them. He just manifested himself and vanished out of their sight. &gt;&gt; Then they said, "Did not our hearts burn within us while he talked to us along the way?" &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said, "The seven mysteries." Watch as Daniel heard the seven thunders as was forbidden. John heard the voices and the book was sealed as skipped on this. Watch. In other words, the mission of God would be finished. In other words, God would be known to his church. Not in three people but as one person the mystery of God would reveal and when that was completely revealed then seven mysteries would open to the church. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Because in there here we go the church this is prophecy would be living under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit him moving in and out showing his signs of being alive among us. And then we are worshiping the living Christ &gt;&gt; that's among us. &gt;&gt; That's the prophecy. There is no argument with that. The manifestation of that will be the interpretation. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Them seven thunders. That's the mystery talking about will reveal Christ among us. &gt;&gt; Then we are worshiping the living Christ. &gt;&gt; Him moving in and out. Maybe he going to move in today. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I believe somebody will be delivered today. &gt;&gt; Today. Not next week. Today. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Right with me now from third seal. They miss him. The living word manifested in the flesh by the word that was promised. &gt;&gt; The word promised to do these things. Understand this church. The scribes and the Pharisees have the quotes, the tapes, the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Of prophecy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But when Jesus came, they rejected him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And he came as manifested word. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Then they are bold. They say our fathers eat mana in the wilderness &gt;&gt; and say and everyone dead. &gt;&gt; What are they talking about? 2 million people came out of Egypt. They're happy to leave Egypt and they don't even know they'll die. &gt;&gt; Two people come with the message of Moses, but they don't know the same God that bring them out going to judge them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because he want you to continue in the word. &gt;&gt; Especially when it come to your promise. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He tolerate the complain in the wilderness. They want food. They want meat. They want water. They want this. He give them all. &gt;&gt; But when it come to the kenish vania, &gt;&gt; when it come to possessing that land and bringing back evidence and brother says God called ministers ought to bring back to their congregation evidence that there's land beyond the river, &gt;&gt; not playing books and tapes. That's not no God called minister doing that. Anybody could do that. &gt;&gt; But God called ministers have to bring back &gt;&gt; to their congregation evidence that there's a land beyond the river. He is still a deliverer. He is still a healer. He is still a baptizer. That is what we're here for. [Applause] &gt;&gt; You have to want to roll back the enemy. You must want to push back the Philistines &gt;&gt; in your own life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You must want a higher standard &gt;&gt; for your own life. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. You must want to lead and tell others to follow. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Hallelujah. Your car point somebody to a place you have not gone. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. That's what we say when we go to travel and go driving up there so much times and know every pothole. &gt;&gt; I know every sink. Yes, &gt;&gt; I know every part to avoid because you have journeyi it so much at times. &gt;&gt; That's how you must be in the word. &gt;&gt; That's how you must be in life. &gt;&gt; You have been there. You have done that. You have seen that. You have to be wise. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You can't live your life loose. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; You have to take good up your loins. &gt;&gt; Strengthen yourself. &gt;&gt; Pull yourself together. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Don't live careless. &gt;&gt; Live circumspect. live like everybody watching you and you want to know how you're walking. &gt;&gt; Come on, say amen, somebody. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So what happened to the pirate Pharisees? They held on to traditions. Oh, this is what we normally do. This is what the message will do. Tradition. So once somebody come out of that, they say, "What they playing? What they playing? What they playing?" They're playing nothing. They're just out of the traditions. Let's go watch. Because she held to these tradition. Jesus the manifested word said to the Hebrew bride because you hold to traditions you make the word of God without any effect to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So if you come to church and you don't break out then it's just a word. &gt;&gt; You kill time and waste two hours here and you go back home. But if you break out to that &gt;&gt; and you recognize this word &gt;&gt; is show word of prophecy, &gt;&gt; then you're not wasting your time. &gt;&gt; Amen. You are coming to get under the anointing. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Your anointing, &gt;&gt; your word, &gt;&gt; your prophecy. You're coming to connect with that. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Because when you connect with your anointing, &gt;&gt; you have faith. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And the devil can't challenge that. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Watch, watch, watch. The Roman centurion, &gt;&gt; he had a revelation. Yes, &gt;&gt; he understood his position. &gt;&gt; He understood he was authorized. &gt;&gt; So he was under authority. &gt;&gt; He said to one go and you have to go. &gt;&gt; So when you see Jesus, no, he's not a Christian. &gt;&gt; He a smoke, drink, run a woman. You don't know what kind of life you living. He didn't come for himself. &gt;&gt; He came on behalf of his servant who was sick. &gt;&gt; He came to Jesus. &gt;&gt; He said, "My servant is sick. &gt;&gt; I recognize you. &gt;&gt; I see you as one under authority. I say to one go on you go &gt;&gt; just speak the word &gt;&gt; and my servant &gt;&gt; shall be healed &gt;&gt; not maybe &gt;&gt; not perhaps &gt;&gt; shout &gt;&gt; my faith tells me &gt;&gt; you can do it you can speak it can happen even today &gt;&gt; even now &gt;&gt; hallelujah [Applause] &gt;&gt; to prove &gt;&gt; hallelujah &gt;&gt; to prove that man was in faith That that that woman when he was going home soon as he reached almost reached the what time was he? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Not if &gt;&gt; what time &gt;&gt; then they say the same time Jesus spoke &gt;&gt; and Jesus the Bible say marveled at that faith &gt;&gt; that wasn't a Jewish faith &gt;&gt; that was a gentile faith &gt;&gt; that was a Roman that's you that's me.

You don't know all the tapes. &gt;&gt; You don't know all the books. You don't know all the codes. That is not as important &gt;&gt; as the dynamics itself. &gt;&gt; Listen, as I said, &gt;&gt; when you go and start your car to drive, &gt;&gt; you don't say that the points, &gt;&gt; the plugs, that the condenser, that the radiator, that's the fan. &gt;&gt; You don't need all that information. &gt;&gt; Keep the bonnet down. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Have the key, &gt;&gt; start the car, [Applause] &gt;&gt; if it break down, call the mechanic. &gt;&gt; You don't have to do nothing with that. You want dynamics. You wanted to turn the key, the car tumble. &gt;&gt; If the car tumble, it's trouble. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. But once your car tumble, &gt;&gt; it's time to drive. &gt;&gt; That is what you want to know. You don't want to know the mechanics. You want to know the dynamics, how this thing does work, how the devils be cast out, how the sick is healed. Oh, glory to God. That is what you want to know. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. You want to see it working &gt;&gt; in your heart and in your life. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Change what you're doing. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; If what you're doing is the same thing over the years and getting same results, you could continue doing the same thing &gt;&gt; and expect a different result. &gt;&gt; That when people going cuckoo &gt;&gt; 2 plus 2 will always equal four. &gt;&gt; You expecting five from 2 plus two. You add it last year. You add it a year before. You add it the year before that. And this year, you're looking for five to come forth. But it's still 2 plus two. Something wrong with you. Nothing wrong with the two. Nothing wrong with the plus. Nothing wrong with the next two. Nothing wrong with the equal sign. Something wrong with you. You can't expect five when 2 plus 2 is four. Come on, say amen, somebody. And if you're expecting a revival, oh glor, do something about it. Come on now. Create the atmosphere. Oh, do something about it. Glory to God.

I know we going past time, but we got to finish. &gt;&gt; We got it. See the change &gt;&gt; from the prophet &gt;&gt; to the prophecy. &gt;&gt; Let me see if we can skip down here. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But say the voice of God. &gt;&gt; How will we know it's the voice of God? &gt;&gt; Because it was then in a vinegated prophet. &gt;&gt; Today, how will we know it's the voice of God? Because it's the manifestation of the prophet's word. &gt;&gt; Not playing back the prophet's word. &gt;&gt; No, the manifestation of the prophet's word. That's how we know it's the voice of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And the prophet said once more &gt;&gt; the world will hear &gt;&gt; direct from God. &gt;&gt; Once more there will be the voice of God that will thunder out to the world. &gt;&gt; Once more the world will be shaken. &gt;&gt; A short quick message that going to shake the whole nation. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The true voice of God only brings back real supernatural God with his supernatural word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm going to sing it here. I'm going to close. Almost halfway through. Hallelujah. I think I'm going to continue &gt;&gt; in the evening service. &gt;&gt; Glory. Glory. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God. &gt;&gt; John 1:29. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We read the scripture. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Jesus. &gt;&gt; John said Jesus and said, "Behold the lamb of God." Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; This is heal &gt;&gt; of whom it was said, "A man cometh which prefer before me." Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Because he was before me. &gt;&gt; My Jesus. &gt;&gt; John bear record. I saw the spirit descending upon him. John bear record. This is not a confirmation, a vindication to the prophecy that God gave John upon the one whom you seen the spirit descended. John said, "I bear record. I see the spirit. I see the anointing. I see dynamics come upon Jesus." &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Here we go. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Again, the next day. &gt;&gt; The next day. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; John with stood with two disciples &gt;&gt; looking upon Jesus. &gt;&gt; All right. He said, "Behold the lamb of God." &gt;&gt; And here we go. &gt;&gt; Get the bomb. And the two disciples &gt;&gt; heard him speak. &gt;&gt; And they followed Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Season change. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They were John disciples. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Now they becoming Jesus disciples. &gt;&gt; Because John came to introduce &gt;&gt; Messiah. &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord a shout. William Brham came to introduce &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; Messiah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; So, brother Brandham. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; He came Malachi 4, &gt;&gt; Luke 17:30, Russian 10:7. He came in in that Elijah form to introduce &gt;&gt; Messiah. &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; Praise be to Jesus. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise God. I want to skip this. Went through time of lingering. &gt;&gt; God is obligated to meet you on the basis of them promises. Outside of them promises, he can't meet you because he cut yourself out. &gt;&gt; So God meeting is based upon &gt;&gt; promises, not church &gt;&gt; promises. Amen. &gt;&gt; Just just promises. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. So 1 Thessalonians 4:16, Lord himself, B say God does all three. Jesus does all three. Shout, voice, and trump. &gt;&gt; Jesus came in a shout &gt;&gt; that was appearing. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; He comes in the voice. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Appearing. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; And the third one is the trump. &gt;&gt; That's his actual coming. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; So came to do what? To restore back the faith. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And then introduce Messiah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Which is to reveal the son of man. &gt;&gt; My God. So it so happened that a son of man revealed the son of man. But it was two different people. It was be brother random here, son of man here. But it happened to be the same person revealing the son of man. So he was seventh angel Elijah Malachi 4 revealing Luke 17:30. So William Brandham as that Elijah could only reveal six seals because Christ was the seventh seal standing in the prophet. So William Brham veiled the mighty angel. &gt;&gt; He veiled Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He unveiled that God and put it on books and tapes. &gt;&gt; And here we are. &gt;&gt; The secret is the word &gt;&gt; is in the pride. God is now veiled &gt;&gt; in you. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; In the form of the word. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Ride with me now. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Just a little more again. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Prophet said, &gt;&gt; "All right, &gt;&gt; watch." Remember, appearing and coming is two different words. &gt;&gt; To appear then to come. Now is the appearing. All right? &gt;&gt; He appeared in the last days. Now is a sign of his coming. &gt;&gt; His appearing in his church in the form of the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; So we have to see the Lord appear &gt;&gt; before he comes. You can't say he coming and you don't see him appear. He has to appear. Then he comes. He appeared the prophet as the shout. He appearing the bra as the voice of the archangel. &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord some praises people. Give the Lord some praises. Who is doing that? &gt;&gt; The Lord himself. [Applause] Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; I'm going to close. &gt;&gt; But what's the attraction &gt;&gt; of the mountain? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He said was God's fulfilling his word. &gt;&gt; We find out that John was so positive. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He said there is one standing among you. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Whose shoes &gt;&gt; I'm not worthy to bear. &gt;&gt; He will baptize you &gt;&gt; with the Holy Ghost and fire. &gt;&gt; As I have baptized with water. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; One day. Here we go. All right. &gt;&gt; An ordinary young man &gt;&gt; about 30 years old &gt;&gt; Jesus &gt;&gt; walked down &gt;&gt; Hallelujah &gt;&gt; and was baptized &gt;&gt; and when this man come &gt;&gt; all right &gt;&gt; there was such an attraction by the prophet &gt;&gt; there was strange that day the congregation couldn't help &gt;&gt; from watching the action of the prophet &gt;&gt; as I was debating with the priest across the water &gt;&gt; I hear John said have not you read the scripture where Daniel said the sacrifice shall be taken away &gt;&gt; I am the voice of one cry in the wilderness Malachi spoke in the third chapter behold I send my messenger before my face &gt;&gt; to prepare the way &gt;&gt; don't you know this fulfilled prophecy &gt;&gt; prophecy being fulfilled &gt;&gt; and about that time here we go this is where I get inspiration from about that time &gt;&gt; the prophet turn and said behold there comes the lamb of God &gt;&gt; that takes away &gt;&gt; the world &gt;&gt; thank you Jesus &gt;&gt; what was the attraction &gt;&gt; hallelujah &gt;&gt; are you ready &gt;&gt; come up please what was the attraction &gt;&gt; it changed from the prophety &gt;&gt; Amen &gt;&gt; from the prophet from the prophet to his prophecy &gt;&gt; all Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. And I believe today &gt;&gt; it's changed &gt;&gt; from the prophet &gt;&gt; to the prophecy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They say we're not playing the tapes and so on. Too bad. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God in a prophet. &gt;&gt; But the prophet brought a prophecy of a seventh bride revival. &gt;&gt; The prophet a prophecy &gt;&gt; that people will be flying in looking for that seventh thunder manifestation. We are here. &gt;&gt; We are under the anointing of a sure word of prophecy. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let me drop this bomb on you. &gt;&gt; Christ himself. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; The gospel, the message. When once you see the message of the hour, everything else is gone. The rest of it is just filler &gt;&gt; once you see the message. &gt;&gt; My Jesus. &gt;&gt; You have a box here. A gift &gt;&gt; wrapping paper have them little kind of plastic, them kind of soft thing inside it. &gt;&gt; Right. The box is not the gift. &gt;&gt; The gift is inside. &gt;&gt; You tear off the box. It have filler things inside of there. Sometime they get small &gt;&gt; and they put in a big box all filler material. &gt;&gt; Once you see the message, everything else is just filler material because you see the real thing. &gt;&gt; Here we go. Watch. Watch. In Noah group when they saw the message, nothing else matters. Moses group saw it. Nothing matters. John group saw it. Nothing matters. When Jesus group saw it, nothing matters &gt;&gt; when you see it. &gt;&gt; Watch. John still had disciples. &gt;&gt; John had disciples. But these two disciples here when John say behold the lamb of God they say all right John I go on &gt;&gt; the Bible said they follow Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Because they saw it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Jesus was the message. &gt;&gt; Come on now. Give the Lord a shout. &gt;&gt; Jesus was the message. &gt;&gt; I'm going to close with these words. &gt;&gt; When the seven angels come from eternity, &gt;&gt; it was one way. &gt;&gt; All right. And one day the Holy Spirit told the brother Brandham, "Are you looking at the picture right? &gt;&gt; Turn it to the right." And when he turned it to the right, it formed this year &gt;&gt; the wig &gt;&gt; from seven angels &gt;&gt; to Christ. &gt;&gt; And that is what Peter, you want to make one for Moses, one for Elias. A voice said, "Shut up. &gt;&gt; This is my beloved son in whom I will please. Hear ye him." &gt;&gt; Time to see Jesus. &gt;&gt; Time to turn away from all the sevens. all the numbers runs out and you'll begin to see Christ. &gt;&gt; The Lord himself. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham came to introduce the Lord himself. &gt;&gt; And the scripture declared the Lord himself went everywhere with them confirming the word with signs following.

Can we give the Lord one more hand of praise? Glory. Amen. Many amen. We have some note of praise and some prayer requests as we approach the throne of grace from sister Kangi. I just want to give God a high note of praise for his healing power. I've been suffering from dizziness for the past five months and on the Saturday morning of the convention when I awoke all dizziness was gone. Thank you Lord. Oh, that is wonderful. As the word goes forth, as Peter yet spoke the word. Hallelujah. How many are so grateful for the convention, for the mighty visitation, for the word of God that was spoken to encourage us, to push us along the journey, to remind us of who we are and who is we are. Amen. We have two prayer requests we want to take to the throne of grace. from Sister Gloria Timothy. Please pray for Sister Marcia Nicholas. She had a bad fall and is experiencing pain in her face and body. And from Brother Anthony O'Brien, please pray for my wife, Sister Kershaw. She is she has swelling on her mouth and lips, skin breaking out in hives, allergic reactions, and chest pains. I believe by faith God can push back these symptoms and deliver her with healing in the name of Jesus Christ. And we believe that this morning and as we approach the throne of grace, if you want to show by raise of hands as we come together as a body of believers understanding the power that is in the church of the living God. Brother Raymond Thompson ended the convention with God's power is your power. All that was in God, he poured into Christ. And all that was in Christ, he poured into the church of the living God. So this morning we stand on the foundation of faith, but beyond that we stand on the foundation of knowing that there's power in the church of the living God over every sickness, over every disease, over every problem, over every situation, be it physical, be it spiritual, be it whatever it might be this morning, we approach the throne of grace this morning. Oh gracious heavenly father, we thank you this morning to be in your house, Lord. Lord, those that are here physically in the building, those that were connected online, Lord, to hear direct from you, a more sure word of prophecy that we are standing on a sure word of prophecy, Lord, that you sent a prophet, Lord, to point us, Lord, to you, Father, so that we could have clarity and plainess, Lord, that this word could never fail. Father, we thank you that you are the same yesterday, today, and forever. We thank you for the ministry that we are under. We thank you for our pastor this morning, Lord, and how you have blessed us and how you have kept us all these years, Lord. To think this message was preached in 2017 and here we are in 2025, Lord. And it's fresh food for us this morning. So, Father, may you bless your people. And as we, Lord, approach these prayer requests, Father. Lord, for Marcia Nicholas had a fall and is experiencing pain in her face and her body, Father, may you visit her even now. And may you touch her from the crown of her head to the soles of her feet. Lord, may the pain dissolve. May all that is wrong be right. May the angel of the Lord pass by way in the mighty name of Jesus Christ. And may this prayer request come back as a note of praise. Uh Lord that you are still in the healing business. You are still in the restoration business. You are still in the deliverance business. And Lord, we bring Sister Kershaw before you this morning. Lord, the enemy has been attacking and the enemy has been doing. But Lord, we come today knowing where we are, who we are, what we are called to do. And we say, Satan, take your hand off of God, daughter, in the mighty name of Jesus Christ. We speak against the swelling and the the hives and the allergic reactions. Father God, may you visit your daughter even now. May you touch her from the crown of her head to the soles of her feet. May you do a miracle in her life today. May you touch her completely. May you heal her completely. Lord, not just the symptoms, but whatever the cause of the problem, house of hell, give way to the name of Jesus. Lord, you taught us healing is the children's bread. Oh God, we pray for healing of our sister in the mighty name of Jesus Christ. And father, all over the buildings, hands were raised up. Lord, different people with different situations, different struggles, different problems, different ailies, different things. Father, Lord, we plead the blood over your house, Father. Lord, may you minister to your children. May you heal, may you touch, may you set free, may you deliver in the mighty name of Jesus Christ, Father. And Lord, as we come to the end of this service, Father, we pray that you would strengthen your people, strengthen your sons, strengthen your daughters, Father. Lord, we pray for our pastor in a special way that you would touch him from the crown of his head to the soles of his feet. Lord, Sister Anmirie, also Lord, the family, Lord, the church, Lord, the elders, the deacons, the ushers, the musicians, the technicians, the helps and governments, Lord, every single brother, sister of the church. Father, those that are here, those that are not here, Father, even around the the the local churches and around the bride around the world, Father, Lord, we are as one Lord, one faith, one baptism. Lord, may you strengthen your church. May you strengthen your believers, Father. May you be with us as we see the soon approaching of us leaving this place. We know that time is short. Father, may you touch your people one more time and may you bring us back at the appointed time in the precious name of Jesus Christ. And the church says, &gt;&gt; And the church says, &gt;&gt; "Amen." And amen. You may be seated for a few announcements. service continues here at the tabernacle on Wednesday and on Wednesday night at 8:00 p.m. We encourage you to make every effort to be here.

So we thank God for his grace, for his love and to see how God is going to keep doing tremendous things before we leave this place. So continue to remember uh the ministry in prayer as we continue to press the battle. Uh just a couple points just to bring to your attention so that you would know uh later in in August. I just want to point the church on August 31st which will be the last Sunday in August. That is our independence day as a holiday. So the Monday will be a public holiday but that is the last Sunday before school reopens. School will be opening that week I believe for most if not all the schools. And as we have been doing for the last few years, we want to have a special time to pray for all of the children going back out to school. In addition, on that day, we'll also have uh the first graduation from our Sunday school program as well on that day. So, I just want to point the church to that. Um also uh we'll send some more details on it but next week not this week we're in here but next week the 6th 7th and 8th of August um but Norris is having a special uh 3 days of meetings focused on the young people on the 6th 7th and 8th. So we want to pose you to that. Um Lord willing I'll be speaking on the 8th which is the last service of the meeting on August 8th Friday August 8th. So, if you're interested in being um in the service, uh please let brother Andy Henry or brother Adrien Joseph know so we can be able to communicate with brother Norris and the group there as well. And we're looking for a wonderful time in the Lord. All over the world, the spirit is moving and God is going to keep doing what he wants to do. So, may the Lord richly bless you. stay on the firing line and uh as Breov would have said on the group if you have not seen all of the services of the convention and sometime you sit there and you you get so caught up in the spirit you miss a few things we encourage you you have all access to all of the seven services watch all seven services feast on it it eating good you can eat again and again and again there's food to keep nourishing you it's there as preaching in 2017 you have no excuse if you want to have 24/7 church you have 24/7 church because all these services are there. So may the Lord richly bless you. Stay on the firing line, brother Anthony. And God bless you. Amen. You appreciate the Lord. Hallelujah. Glory to God. Thank you Jesus. So as you get ready to dismiss you out. Amen. God richly bless you. Blessed be the Lord God. Almighty who was and is and is to come. Blessed be the Lord God Almighty.
