[39:53] even the titles are in terms of
[39:56] presenting to the bride
[39:58] that's nothing do it church your
[39:59] convention is have to do with a bride
[40:01] elect
[40:02] isn't that right and you have to possess
[40:04] your individual inheritance because you
[40:07] have representation by predestination
[40:10] you don't have to play shy and whatnot
[40:13] no and you are predestined that are
[40:15] eternal Church age at the end of the
[40:17] seal and you have to know that you are
[40:20] bored eternal thoughts isn't that right
[40:22] and God is bringing you back to that
[40:24] first day the evening in the morning
[40:26] with the first day and that is back to
[40:28] the eighth day that is back to eternity
[40:29] praise God on what's inside of you is
[40:32] your original seed the spoken word and
[40:35] all those who laugh and mock at us
[40:37] because we caught in from the Prophet
[40:39] one day they're gonna realize that you
[40:41] are we receiving original word which was
[40:45] the spoken word not an interpretation or
[40:48] explanation of what the Prophet said but
[40:51] just what the Prophet said was seated on
[40:54] into you
[40:54] no wonder the Holy Spirit told the
[40:56] Prophet right the secret is the word is
[40:59] in the bride that mean they had to have
[41:02] ministries pouring the seer the Lord
[41:05] into you I am NOT a prophet I don't have
[41:08] the say the Lord William Branham is a
[41:10] prophet he was that Elisha and we said
[41:12] the words of that Elisha and echo it to
[41:15] you Oh blessed be the name of the Lord
[41:18] he was a messenger to call a bride for
[41:21] Isaac
[41:21] Currie say Amen William Branham was
[41:25] Ellie Eliezer to call a bride for Isaac
[41:27] who is Isaac the mighty angel of
[41:30] revelation 10 brings God first
[41:33] Thessalonians 4 the Lord Himself sees
[41:35] and remember with a shout God wasn't
[41:37] taking chances in his last day he didn't
[41:39] send an angel he said I myself will come
[41:42] down to call my bride oh praise God you
[41:45] wanna call my a man
[41:47] you don't call by a system you not call
[41:49] by a church you are called beyond that I
[41:52] am the call by a man so romantic put his
[41:54] hands on me I am free from the hands of
[41:57] man you are caused by that mighty angel
[42:00] from revelation 10:1 or plural of God
[42:04] you believe that hallelujah
[42:07] so my title comes with a burden behind
[42:11] it it's make your calling and election
[42:13] sure confirm your calling confirming
[42:18] lection don't just take for granted your
[42:20] salvation don't take for granted in the
[42:22] bride here in the message don't take
[42:24] that for granted make your calling and
[42:26] election sure get it confirmed then you
[42:30] cannot be defeated but you cannot be
[42:32] fought for because you know you're part
[42:34] of God's eternal thoughts that was in
[42:37] the back part of his name man hallelujah
[42:40] and I'm an inspiration called by the
[42:42] seven thunders of Revelation 10 the
[42:45] elected bride only she could hear that
[42:48] call and the subject elect according to
[42:52] the foreknowledge of God that's the
[42:54] script every read and Peter we not
[42:56] elected because we come to this church
[42:57] you're not elected because it gets saved
[43:00] and they get baptized in Jesus name
[43:01] you're elected based upon the
[43:03] foreknowledge of God the foreknowledge
[43:06] of God is what calls you you should
[43:08] rejoice right now in that you could show
[43:11] right now just and that alone
[43:12] no man can interrupt the foreknowledge
[43:16] of God that elected you don't man can
[43:18] interrupt that ok vanilla salt appraised
[43:21] Oh hallelujah praise God amen all right
[43:27] please God for whom he did foreknow he
[43:33] also did predestinate to be conformed to
[43:38] the image of his son that he Jesus might
[43:42] be the firstborn among many brethren
[43:45] so his foreknowledge isn't that right
[43:49] brick make way for his predestination
[43:51] because he foreknew you he could
[43:54] predestinate you despite your smoke and
[43:56] drinking food in a row
[43:58] that didn't stumble him that didn't
[44:01] fight in God but wasn't upset or get
[44:04] goggle hores in his mind it was already
[44:07] done in the back part of his mind it's
[44:10] not right your election was already done
[44:13] and the comforta fulfil it on the earth
[44:15] then as your faith increase in your
[44:18] elective quality of in God Oh hallelujah
[44:23] then you could truly embrace Romans 8:28
[44:26] so we know all things work together for
[44:31] good to them that love God to them who
[44:36] are the called hallelujah you have to
[44:42] know your have been called according to
[44:45] his purpose
[44:46] Oh glory to God amen but a Branham from
[44:50] an old money without price
[44:59] I heard all their beloved pastor but
[45:04] never make a remark on his television
[45:06] reader cast yet in the morning and just
[45:08] went over and over my mind I just can't
[45:11] forget it
[45:11] I quoted it to a friend of mine last
[45:14] night and that it was this after the
[45:19] taken away of the Holy Spirit out of the
[45:22] it this is not if this is after it will
[45:31] be done after the Holy Spirit is taken
[45:37] out of the earth that former church
[45:42] religion will go right on not knowing
[45:46] the difference
[45:47] how many hate that but Branham speaking
[45:50] that wasn't that a strong them they
[45:59] don't know the Holy Spirit so they won't
[46:04] know when it's gone and they will just
[46:08] be going on just the same and when the
[46:11] last one here we go is sealed into the
[46:15] body of Christ not a church that's the
[46:20] body of Christ
[46:22] [Applause]
[46:23] they will be still going on trying to
[46:26] bring converts to it because they don't
[46:28] know what it is and their formal
[46:30] religion will continue on just like
[46:33] there were no it may not sink into you
[46:36] like it did to me but that was an
[46:38] Estonian statement that there be so far
[46:41] away in religious rituals until they
[46:44] will not miss the Holy Spirit because
[46:47] they don't know what it is to begin with
[46:54] so you've got to know this Holy Spirit
[46:57] you got to know this comforter but a
[47:01] Branham continued and God have mercy on
[47:02] us brother I would like to live in this
[47:05] life is in my desire till if even the
[47:09] least bit of his grieving I know it in
[47:11] my heart if I should do something that
[47:14] would grieve him I'd be able to feel it
[47:17] just in a moment let alone his absence
[47:21] he was blessing God to get conviction
[47:25] that if he grieving the spirit if he
[47:27] feeling conflicted or what that it will
[47:29] be reaching him he don't want to be
[47:31] insensitive to the Spirit of God he want
[47:34] to be sensitive to the Spirit of God he
[47:36] said if I would do something would
[47:37] grieve him I believe in to feel it just
[47:39] in a moment see let alone his absence I
[47:41] don't want to be here when he's not here
[47:44] I want to be gone then there are the
[47:46] normal blood on the mercy seat it'll be
[47:48] dark smoky and black this sanctuary will
[47:51] have no lawyer to plead our case at that
[47:54] time you know the scripture say the
[47:57] Santeria or smoking there was no blood
[47:59] on the mercy seat then it is Dutchman
[48:01] there is so many entertaining
[48:04] entertainment things in our days there
[48:06] are so many things to entice people to
[48:08] what we call pleasures and it's all
[48:11] peoples and all ages their enticement
[48:14] for young people modern dances

[48:24] that child hasn't accepted the
[48:25] experience of the new belt rock'n'roll
[48:28] catches attention as quick as he hears
[48:30] it because it is in him and is born in
[48:33] in my
[48:33] Eternal Spirit and the power of the
[48:36] devil is so great today till it catches

[1:15:03] oh my and that's what Matt Hardy Malachi
[1:15:06] 1 1 2 3 the burden of the word of the

[1:23:28] of God so the light that was in the
[1:23:32] stalk the life went into Wesley and one
[1:23:37] big blade who look like the green when
[1:23:39] the problem comes the shock watch so
[1:23:41] therefore the life keep traveling on
[1:23:43] isn't that right
[1:23:44] but a brown I'm talking about so the
[1:23:46] life is what kind of really dominated
[1:23:49] after the life pass through denomination
[1:23:52] denominational denomination but they
[1:23:54] have to have something that kind of B
[1:23:55] denomination which is the life itself
[1:23:58] and that life is faith to virtue
[1:24:00] knowledge that life cannot be
[1:24:01] denominated
[1:24:02] you can't box that in you can't let you
[1:24:04] say that in you got put clothes on that
[1:24:05] and say have to be so that's the life if
[1:24:08] I break out what was pushing off isn't
[1:24:11] that right we're on set Moses call a
[1:24:13] nation of domination here we go
[1:24:15] Christ today is calling a church out of
[1:24:18] a church Christ is calling what a church
[1:24:26] out of a church taking them to that
[1:24:28] promised eternal that glorious eternal
[1:24:30] promised land
[1:24:31] so there's church but the seventh on
[1:24:34] erosion ten comes to call a bride out of
[1:24:37] the church don't stay in church come on
[1:24:41] to be bright
[1:24:42] respond to the corn this mighty angel
[1:24:45] came down and crowd when love was seven
[1:24:47] thunders trade forces out relish
[1:24:49] antennas mighty angel that's Christ your
[1:24:51] husband Russian ten seven is the
[1:24:53] messenger
[1:24:54] that's what Eliezer version 1080 level
[1:24:57] as the pride only get right now
[1:25:00] Ruffy sign from the book or plural you
[1:25:03] are speaking your deliverance speaking
[1:25:05] your it be holy convocation speaking
[1:25:07] your revival speaking equipment power
[1:25:09] coming upon your life speaking your
[1:25:11] transformation speaking rapture and
[1:25:13] faith that's that's coming from the book
[1:25:15] we can only speak from the book glory to
[1:25:19] God we're not normal preachers in the
[1:25:20] Pentecostal preacher this is the book
[1:25:22] being open the full book being open
[1:25:26] Oh glory to God are you with me no but
[1:25:29] I'm answer to refuse the person that's
[1:25:30] doing the callin I love that Christ no
[1:25:34] matter if you're Methodists Lutheran not
[1:25:36] against them not at all but in this age
[1:25:38] you have got to accept my decision that
[1:25:40] is the person of Christ which is the
[1:25:43] word so now we come down to another
[1:25:46] feeling that I emotion not a nice thing
[1:25:48] I nice feeling oh no no no it's the wood
[1:25:52] so after all after all the shout and all
[1:25:54] the praise and worship it comes right
[1:25:56] back to what God said in his word Oh
[1:25:59] hallelujah praise God
[1:26:02] so the only way to do is not say I
[1:26:05] belong to assemblies I would have to be
[1:26:07] same today this is a group this is the
[1:26:09] kingdom this is it we have the Manatee
[1:26:12] our church of the hour everything I do I
[1:26:14] belong to one this Tunis whatever it is
[1:26:17] all of them there I belong to the Church
[1:26:18] of God that don't mean a thing he said
[1:26:23] our Father shouted and danced that's
[1:26:24] perfectly all right
[1:26:25] but that was their day but the day you
[1:26:27] are confronted not with the organization
[1:26:30] they made but with the life that is
[1:26:33] going on which is Jesus Christ that's
[1:26:36] all she's trying for that life not just
[1:26:39] to belong to another group so no matter
[1:26:42] how religious you are how many churches
[1:26:43] you belong to how many books your name
[1:26:45] is on if that genuine Holy Ghost is in
[1:26:48] you which is this word manifested you
[1:26:50] will see the
[1:26:51] messes of the hour because it's the holy
[1:26:53] who that does it is the inspiration that
[1:26:56] have to strike you so dumb time you're
[1:26:58] talking about talking and sharing the
[1:26:59] wood and so on but it will take
[1:27:00] inspiration
[1:27:01] he said he elected of God see me the
[1:27:02] north time Moses time Jesus time the
[1:27:06] Apostles time leutis time
[1:27:08] Wesley time man Acosta time because that
[1:27:10] was the seed was on the earth when this
[1:27:13] inspiration was poured out now while the
[1:27:16] inspiration is poured out the gathered
[1:27:18] the bright together it is only the
[1:27:21] elected will see it so he prophesy that
[1:27:24] an inspiration will be poured out to
[1:27:27] gather the bright together only the
[1:27:29] elected could see it because elected is
[1:27:32] really the inspiration the seeds of the
[1:27:34] inspiration itself so you are seeds of
[1:27:36] God waiting for inspiration to pick you
[1:27:39] up because once you are inspired is
[1:27:41] changes all everything listen to your
[1:27:44] ordinary folks and let the spirit come
[1:27:46] upon you fire come upon you don't let
[1:27:49] the devil never playing with you play
[1:27:52] with fire the devil screaming fire
[1:27:55] hallelujah praise God because Samson was
[1:27:58] a normal guy no big muscles were when
[1:28:01] the spirit come upon him he was bigger
[1:28:03] than he looked
[1:28:04] he was stronger than he looked because
[1:28:07] there was a bigger power upon him I went
[1:28:09] as dynamics that head stole this
[1:28:11] capstone this bond of perfectness this
[1:28:13] love this child you've never faileth
[1:28:15] went up on that bright bigger than she
[1:28:18] looks more powerful and she looks where
[1:28:21] I'm says we wouldn't pray for the sick
[1:28:22] then we would command it not even lay
[1:28:25] hands on us area command endeavors to
[1:28:27] come out commander plank to see command
[1:28:31] the lame to walk

[1:28:36] see
[1:28:40] Loreena Claude do believe that did we're
[1:28:43] acquaintances say that China hallelujah
[1:28:47] so know why the inspiration is poured
[1:28:49] out the calendar by together it with
[1:28:51] doors only those elected I will see it
[1:28:53] oh praise the name of the Lord
[1:28:55] question and answers but a brand on will

[1:36:18] get the people together the shout is a
[1:36:22] messenger getting the people ready
[1:36:23] so Berta Brandon brought a message to
[1:36:26] guarded a bride together is not right
[1:36:28] revolution book of symbols but a pile of
[1:36:31] fur seals no Lucy
[1:36:33] he said it's calling for seven
[1:36:34] mysterious thunders they're not even
[1:36:36] written at all and I believe through
[1:36:38] those seven thunders will be revealed in
[1:36:42] a last day in order to get the bright
[1:36:44] together forever and fate so the shout
[1:36:47] and the tunnels is the same thing the
[1:36:49] shot was sent to Gaara the brides
[1:36:52] together to bring an interruption feet
[1:36:55] that means to bring her poor heart
[1:36:57] individual inheritance Oh glory to God
[1:37:01] you understand that this this wasn't
[1:37:03] preachy as I going on because people
[1:37:05] just wanted to be in church take that
[1:37:07] day in a church daily message but as you
[1:37:09] mature and as the years roll by you
[1:37:11] recognize had come down to individual
[1:37:13] heritance because Joshua was given three
[1:37:15] things to do cross the people over fight
[1:37:18] and divide Alan so I am saying we have
[1:37:20] cross over
[1:37:21] we have been fighting for years years
[1:37:23] years know is land division time at
[1:37:25] topsail is not a church thing
[1:37:27] I had a revelation as years ago that the
[1:37:29] people can vote their pasta to be
[1:37:31] adopted adopted adoption is not between
[1:37:35] the church and the pasta at dr. Levine
[1:37:38] Court and his son
[1:37:41] I understood that years ago that's why I
[1:37:45] never study about the people what they
[1:37:48] think and what they feel at the end I
[1:37:50] have to please him
[1:37:55] no no I'm not trying to preach you happy
[1:37:57] and trying to say what he told me to say
[1:37:59] [Applause]
[1:38:01] he gave me this information thirsty make
[1:38:05] a correlation sure I would know that
[1:38:07] talk about a little bit in the meeting
[1:38:09] and that's what I feel to bring to you
[1:38:14] this morning don't take a testimony for
[1:38:16] granted you know like we some people the
[1:38:18] backslidden and they say you know I'm
[1:38:19] I'm their China God and you know so
[1:38:22] flimsy and the day smoking you know go
[1:38:24] bring me back and I give them a motive
[1:38:27] is balance and all that it's just
[1:38:31] intelligent that's not dumb here no no
[1:38:35] that is in the lecture Samson is the son
[1:38:38] of God something he was covenant in
[1:38:40] Samson tasted the power of God he knew
[1:38:42] it but he was fooling around fooling for
[1:38:45] me you didn't mess with Delilah and in
[1:38:47] it all he still have the connection
[1:38:49] because I saw her access right the
[1:38:51] father I was thing about my own sons I
[1:38:54] said wait a minute
[1:38:54] wait we got know what they do this with
[1:38:56] my sons hadn't I them I kept change the
[1:38:59] front the money myself you know I don't
[1:39:02] know who you are to me back on them
[1:39:03] because of what they said my son's
[1:39:05] because they were booted from me under
[1:39:10] Gaza what you have been booted from quad
[1:39:12] [Applause]
[1:39:16] so regard you do how you do yourself
[1:39:18] sons but it's what time so I Dutch
[1:39:27] enough to do is father and son not
[1:39:32] Church so people have the minister love
[1:39:35] the pastime what that's fine is good
[1:39:36] everything else but that'll love and
[1:39:38] that clapping applause and she can His
[1:39:39] Highness on that doesn't make him
[1:39:40] adopted Rama's Daniel was told by the
[1:39:49] angel he heard sometimes Daniel did too
[1:39:51] they uttered a voice is Daniel grab the
[1:39:53] pen to write ingested or I did though
[1:39:55] write it on the backs of the Bible what
[1:39:57] he said John saw the same thing it was
[1:39:59] already watch it had already been
[1:40:02] written outside the Bible and had seven
[1:40:04] scenes on the back of the book that no
[1:40:06] matter open those seals first he
[1:40:08] described them as seals here is now that
[1:40:11] was them voices so the back of the book
[1:40:15] had seven voices which is also seven
[1:40:17] seals isn't that right so he took those
[1:40:20] voices on the back of the book and put
[1:40:21] it inside the book under the seven seals
[1:40:23] seven thunders uttered the voices
[1:40:25] Oh hallelujah no man know what it was
[1:40:28] but the Bible said and told Daniel and
[1:40:30] also John that in the last days these
[1:40:32] seven voices would be known by the real
[1:40:36] true church so I chose that not reaching
[1:40:39] a seven thunders forget it the present
[1:40:42] of the church material which we have
[1:40:44] lots of material oh it's an abundance
[1:40:47] but bright material this sometimes will
[1:40:49] produce that because the seventh is
[1:40:51] produced and not Ephesians which will
[1:40:53] come back to defeat and defeat in you
[1:40:56] means you survive as individual if just
[1:40:59] church collapses and demolished you
[1:41:01] still survives
[1:41:02] if trainer split up in 100 pass you will
[1:41:05] survive with your feet because it's not
[1:41:07] man that call you has got that call you
[1:41:09] you have got a revelation who called you
[1:41:12] isn't that right what chlorine has got a
[1:41:14] no man could take that call in no mental
[1:41:16] go between that calling is that you and
[1:41:18] somebody else and God knows you and God
[1:41:21] it's not right
[1:41:22] praise God oh my hallelujah praise God
[1:41:28] praise berm says there's a time a time
[1:41:31] what Jesus England to stand outside
[1:41:33] you're doing not all the time there's a
[1:41:35] time when he's getting nothing turn away
[1:41:37] then you will did not new to the
[1:41:39] knocking on you'll never find it
[1:41:40] come while it is time come why there's a
[1:41:43] knock don't you compromise with anything
[1:41:46] less than the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:41:48] like they got at Pentecost oh praise God
[1:41:50] don't let your heart settle for nothing
[1:41:52] less than that oh praise the name of the
[1:41:55] Lord
[1:41:55] so Church it come down to this hour now
[1:41:58] and I feel it's very very serious that
[1:42:01] is each individual have to make your
[1:42:04] calling and election sure it's not good
[1:42:07] enough to see Jesus sees me that could
[1:42:09] enough to know that you get baptized in
[1:42:10] Jesus name and you're see if you want to
[1:42:12] know what you're called unto you really
[1:42:14] want to know what you look on to burns
[1:42:16] the election looks back the
[1:42:17] foreknowledge
[1:42:18] that's where election comes from the
[1:42:21] foreknowledge I've got wait a minute I'm
[1:42:22] elected yes how elected if on you me I
[1:42:25] lectured on the foreknowledge of God the
[1:42:28] foreknowledge of God elected me then
[1:42:30] watch then what ROM says now I'm
[1:42:32] predestination looks the destiny what
[1:42:35] you are pretty Tillman to be
[1:42:38] so you may not be it yet but you had
[1:42:40] predetermined to be what God ought in

[2:04:00] is about so he knew what to do did not
[2:04:03] befall you are you at me now Peter
[2:04:06] understood that so be they could share
[2:04:08] that with us having escaped the
[2:04:09] corruption doesn't were chill us strong
[2:04:11] desires your own self will your own
[2:04:13] desires you want to push that aside to
[2:04:16] come into the will of God the program of
[2:04:19] God for your life
[2:04:20] hallelujah start to get a higher desire
[2:04:22] to do the will of God to connect the
[2:04:25] purpose of God and that's why this
[2:04:27] morning the Holy Spirit is saying make a
[2:04:29] calling and election sure confirm it
[2:04:32] riah film it let it be vindicated that
[2:04:35] you might know your sonship and the
[2:04:37] culture is intact that they'll have
[2:04:39] confidence to face tomorrow but

[2:04:47] through the outside with all the

[2:05:04] Lord please visit Jesus so the purpose
[2:05:07] of the bride is a comment to this bride
[2:05:09] buddy come baptized into the body coming

[2:05:17] oh praise the name of the Lord praise be
[2:05:21] to Jesus or could we give you the
[2:05:23] awesome presence
[2:05:34] so when Peter said he that luckily
[2:05:36] things as blind and can't see afar off
[2:05:38] he is showing clearly that being
[2:05:40] forgiven of your sins does not mean
[2:05:43] you're automatically grow in God let me
[2:05:48] sit again when Peter said - he did look
[2:05:52] at these things as bland can't see afar
[2:05:54] off and has forgotten that he was purged
[2:05:56] from his old sins proven that being
[2:05:59] purged from your sins doesn't
[2:06:00] automatically make you climb up that
[2:06:02] tree so it means your election to
[2:06:09] salvation your election to fate put you
[2:06:13] in a position to give all diligence
[2:06:18] press pork you have to do it every day
[2:06:23] Adam Preston push him it cannot be I
[2:06:27] might end up in forgiving rejoice eat
[2:06:29] children babes babes I write to you
[2:06:32] children because sins are forgiven it
[2:06:35] has to go beyond that because one quad
[2:06:38] wanted to go beyond young men and go on
[2:06:40] to become fathers which is adopted sons
[2:06:42] but wanted to come into a straighter
[2:06:44] maturity because he can't give children
[2:06:46] inheritance you give son's inheritance
[2:06:48] mature sons right nuisance mature sons
[2:06:50] so what ones that come into spiritual
[2:06:52] maturity and you could lose powers on
[2:06:54] you boy I'm not stingy on or going to
[2:06:58] haul him back I'm holding back because
[2:06:59] what stingy is not that it's correcting
[2:07:01] you want to connect with like if a man I
[2:07:04] can handle power power does to people
[2:07:06] money does cheap people victimless strip
[2:07:09] people God understand that as human
[2:07:12] nature power Prime Minister president
[2:07:15] whatever to see you or whatever mess
[2:07:16] people up because the character is not
[2:07:19] yet to manage it so God bring a good
[2:07:22] message to bring character in because
[2:07:25] the dynamic struck the Pentecostal and
[2:07:26] they couldn't reduce Jesus Christ to
[2:07:28] produce gifts with all the power tongues
[2:07:31] interpretation and men committed
[2:07:32] adultery and fooling wrong under the
[2:07:35] dynamic inspiration so you bought the
[2:07:37] profit with the word which you produce
[2:07:38] corrector but the trial of your faith
[2:07:41] because corrected other gifts
[2:07:44] [Applause]

[2:07:49] is you have to press into it
[2:07:52] trials and tribulations and all whatever

[2:10:02] churn had been born need haven't done

[2:10:10] works what of him that call it amplified
[2:10:14] said even so in order to carry out God's
[2:10:16] purpose are the churun were yet unborn
[2:10:18] and had so far done nothing either good
[2:10:21] or evil even so in order further the
[2:10:24] carrier God's purpose of selection
[2:10:26] election and choice which depends not on
[2:10:29] works of what man can do but on him who
[2:10:32] calls him so this election and choice
[2:10:36] has none do with you it has to do with
[2:10:39] him and your response to that election
[2:10:42] is where your labor comes in is where
[2:10:45] your present comes in is where your
[2:10:47] behavior comes in to be found worthy of
[2:10:51] the love that God extended towards you
[2:10:53] under Greece and the elective love yes

[2:11:02] charge at God's elect who can bring any
[2:11:04] charge against God's elect it is God who
[2:11:07] justify that is who puts it in right
[2:11:10] relation to himself who shall come
[2:11:11] forward and accuse or impeach those whom
[2:11:14] God have chosen blessed is the man in

[2:16:44] mystery of his will look at those words
[2:16:46] haven't made known to us the mystery of
[2:16:49] Israel let a prophet put the magnifying
[2:16:51] glass and that the mysteries of his will
[2:16:54] and remember how he hung on that how
[2:16:56] many was here this morning let's see how
[2:16:58] he spoken at the mission as well now it
[2:17:00] is not just a little thing it's a
[2:17:03] mystery
[2:17:03] God's will he's doing deeper is a
[2:17:06] mystery and each man yeah we go you see

[2:17:18] son reason God see little answer all
[2:17:22] right but listen know God's will is a
[2:17:26] mystery and each man has to seek out the
[2:17:31] will of God for his or her life so this
[2:17:37] is not automatic that's why the elect
[2:17:39] will have a certain behavior the elect
[2:17:42] will seek the mystery of his will God I
[2:17:45] born your will is not the will of God

[2:17:52] married get cheering on this day it has
[2:17:55] to have a higher purpose than that okay
[2:17:59] question and answers how does one know
[2:18:02] their rightful position in the body of
[2:18:04] Christ that's a good one
[2:18:06] how does one knows that's the kind of
[2:18:08] question amongst many of us here tonight
[2:18:09] how do you rightfully know i unproven at
[2:18:12] this brother wants to know what position
[2:18:14] what in Christ
[2:18:16] what part of Christ do I play know for
[2:18:18] instance I like to say this brother to
[2:18:20] give you the base as I know your
[2:18:22] position in Christ is revealed to you by
[2:18:25] the Holy Spirit
[2:18:28] it's one and then if you want to know if
[2:18:32] you want to know whether it's the Holy
[2:18:35] Spirit or not find out whether he
[2:18:37] blesses what you're doing or not if he
[2:18:41] blesses it then it's him if he doesn't
[2:18:43] bless like somebody said to me long ago
[2:18:45] the local me to preach I said well then
[2:18:47] preach you say well you see I really
[2:18:49] think it's Satan he can get somebody to
[2:18:52] act like that and then deceive them and
[2:18:54] just what he wants to do the whole point
[2:18:56] the world points the finger right there
[2:18:58] somebody thinks they have a give up
[2:18:59] speaking in tongues interpretation has a
[2:19:01] gift of divine healing some of these
[2:19:03] things sometimes they are mystical in
[2:19:04] those things and sometime they think
[2:19:06] they have inducted and when they have is
[2:19:08] tricky so always do this brethren when
[2:19:11] you feel you're supposed to do a thing
[2:19:12] find out if it's Scripture for you to do
[2:19:14] it not just what in one place I mean
[2:19:17] completely scriptural through the Bible
[2:19:19] we'll go and do it and so on then you
[2:19:20] talk about a motive and objective and so
[2:19:22] on like that so that is very very
[2:19:24] interested so pre is going to say if a
[2:19:26] man can be a pastor and his real flight
[2:19:28] and so on he said the Lord call me turn
[2:19:29] such-and-such to be a pastor a pastor
[2:19:32] can be a flighty person a passage solid
[2:19:34] a pasta is song just a few more and we
[2:19:36] finish Jesus our perfect faith he had it
[2:19:39] he cook it because he was the word and
[2:19:42] you become the word as you receive the
[2:19:45] world and that receiving is inwardly and
[2:19:53] willingly not outwardly inwardly and
[2:19:57] willingly so when you hear the words say
[2:19:59] you're elected you receive that when you
[2:20:01] would say you're forgiven you receive
[2:20:03] that when the worst you are justified
[2:20:05] you're not studying what is happen at
[2:20:06] know you receive that inwardly and
[2:20:08] willingly praise God no watch he said to
[2:20:12] us if you abide in me and I will abide
[2:20:14] in you you can ask what you will it
[2:20:15] shall be done then recognize the
[2:20:17] position in the scripture as a believer
[2:20:19] you've got to recognize your position as
[2:20:21] he recognized his position oh my I love
[2:20:26] this one and you are just as important
[2:20:28] as Billy Graham know he said we notice
[2:20:31] you have got so many milligrams today
[2:20:33] but you see God never meet God meet one
[2:20:36] Billy Graham and you were just as
[2:20:39] important as Billy Graham or robbers for
[2:20:40] any
[2:20:41] he must men you were just as important
[2:20:44] until you get out of your please so in
[2:20:49] your place you are in your element in
[2:20:52] your place your frame in your place is
[2:20:55] when you could have fit to be good for

[2:25:17] God has called you to I am sure you can
[2:25:20] read between the lines what I'm saying

[2:25:27] has called you
[2:25:27] well what is God doing transforming you
[2:25:30] from what you was maybe a daughter or
[2:25:32] son whatever it is from a lovely family
[2:25:35] sometimes he places you somewhere else
[2:25:39] who does that God does that take you
[2:25:43] from your lovely family
[2:25:45] because your family is your family and
[2:25:47] your family is hindering you because all
