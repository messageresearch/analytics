[13:30] you and thanks so much for being here
[13:31] tonight we always consider it a
[13:33] privilege where Believers of like
[13:36] Precious feet could gather together so
[13:39] tonight if you have your Bibles ID like
[13:41] you to turn to Genesis Chapter
[13:44] 30 and we want to read verse 22 to
[13:49] 24 Genesis Chapter 30 reading verse 22
[13:54] to
[13:57] 24 and the title of what I want to share
[14:00] with you tonight is taken from this
[14:03] scripture title is God had taken away my
[14:07] Repro and this scripture in Genesis 30
[14:10] verse 22 reads and God remembered
[14:15] Rachel and God hearkened to her and
[14:18] opened her
[14:20] womb and she conceived and be a son and
[14:25] said God had taken away my
[14:29] approach and she called his name Joseph
[14:32] and said the Lord shall add to me
[14:37] another son Psalms 42 want to go to that
[14:42] s and is a familiar Psalm this a heart
[14:45] pant after the water Brooks so my panted
[14:48] my soul after thee Oh God my soul
[14:52] thirsted for
[14:54] God for the Living God When shall I come
[14:58] and appear before God my tears have
[15:01] remind me day and night while they
[15:03] continually say unto me where is thy God
[15:07] when I remember these things I P my soul
[15:10] in me where I had gone with the
[15:12] multitude I went with them to the house
[15:15] of God with the voice of joy and praise
[15:18] with a multitude that kept holding why
[15:20] are th castom oh my soul why thou
[15:25] disired in me hope thou in God for I
[15:29] shall yet praise him for the help of his
[15:34] countenance oh my God my soul is cast
[15:38] down Within Me therefore will I remember
[15:41] thee from the land of Jordan and from
[15:44] the herit from the hill of Mah deep cth
[15:47] un deep and the noise of thy Waters FL
[15:50] all the waves and thy Billows are gone
[15:51] over me yet the Lord will command his
[15:55] loving kindness in the daytime and the
[15:57] night his song
[15:59] shall be with me and my prayer unto the
[16:02] god of my life I will say unto my God my
[16:06] rock why hast Thou forsaken me why go I
[16:10] mourning because of the oppression of
[16:12] the
[16:13] enemy as the sword in my bones my
[16:17] enemies reproach me while they say daily
[16:20] unto me there is thy God may God bless
[16:22] his
[16:23] will
[16:25] reproach and this word reproach I just
[16:28] took it from
[16:29] there are different approaches to it but
[16:30] I want to take it from one particular
[16:32] angle
[16:33] reproach a cause or occasion of
[16:38] blame
[16:40] discredit or disgree
[16:43] and you know because in those times not
[16:47] having a child was such a societal thing
[16:50] that was negative it was a prayer for
[16:53] woman to not to be Barren but to bring
[16:55] forth and that is why Rachel could say
[16:59] that God had taken away my
[17:02] reproach this was a cry this was a
[17:07] prayer and the way the scripture phrased
[17:10] it it's so powerful and God remembered
[17:15] Risha and God hearkened unto her and
[17:19] opened her womb so it mean it meant that
[17:23] there's a part that God played there's a
[17:26] part that re shall pray
[17:29] played and that part is that R was
[17:32] crying out unto God that is what we here
[17:34] to do tonight to cow unto God that God
[17:39] not only remembers what he promised you
[17:42] but he would Heen to your prayer or
[17:44] happen to your
[17:46] cry
[17:48] and whatever is the occasion of disgrace
[17:51] where reproach is
[17:52] concern whether is defeat and battle
[17:56] whether is an exile in
[17:59] enmity the psalmist David prayed for
[18:02] deliverance from the
[18:04] reproach and this is in Psalms 11 19:22
[18:07] he said remove from me reproach and
[18:12] contempt for I have kept thy
[18:16] testimonies now you don't have to find
[18:18] it but I read it from Daniel 9 when
[18:20] Daniel was praying in verse 15 he said
[18:23] now oh Lord Our God that has brought thy
[18:26] people forth out of the land of
[18:30] Egypt with a mighty hand and has gotten
[18:33] the renowned and at this day we have
[18:35] sinned we have done
[18:37] wickedly oh Lord according to thy
[18:42] righteousness I beseech thee let thine
[18:46] anger and thy Fury be turned away from
[18:49] thy City Jerusalem thy Holy Mountain
[18:52] because of our sins and for the iniquity
[18:56] of our fathers Jerusalem and thy people
[19:00] have become a reproach to all that are
[19:04] about us and
[19:07] because the time is not yet for the
[19:11] Fulfillment of the promised word we have
[19:14] to be a reproach a reproach of baress
[19:18] even one Minister say you have all have
[19:20] nothing up in Sandy you know as if well
[19:22] okay that means they have
[19:25] something but the the problem is we have
[19:30] to bear the reproach of the word and the
[19:34] reproach of the word is a reproach of
[19:37] what God
[19:38] promised and when you understand that
[19:41] there something you want to read to get
[19:43] to you would begin to thank God for his
[19:47] promised word that God is not dead He's
[19:50] Alive the fact that he made the promise
[19:52] is the fact that he will keep that
[19:54] promise because God is not a man that
[19:56] would lie so once God make a promise
[19:59] even though it's dry even though it look
[20:01] like nothing is moving but God can't lie
[20:04] and we have confidence that God will
[20:07] come down and fulfill his will but
[20:09] listen to this so when Daniel was saying
[20:12] thy people have become a reproach to All
[20:15] About Us how come he the bride and you
[20:18] say is the bride and you say when the
[20:20] power come in the church and you know
[20:22] all the scuffing and the criticism and
[20:25] but Daniel went on to pray and said now
[20:28] therefore Oh Our God hear the prayer of
[20:32] thy servant and his supplications and
[20:35] cause thy face to shine upon thy
[20:38] Sanctuary that is desolate for the
[20:41] Lord's sake oh my God incline thine ear
[20:45] and hear open thine eyes and behold our
[20:49] desolations and the city which is called
[20:51] by thy name for we do not present our
[20:54] supplication before thee for our
[20:56] righteousness but for thy great mercies
[21:00] so it is important to note the sincerity
[21:04] of these Godly characters in the Bible
[21:08] how they will talk to the lord they're
[21:10] not saying I the eye and the bride and
[21:13] and um you know a sort of swagger a kind
[21:17] of arrogant Swagger because they believe
[21:20] God like what you find now around kind
[21:23] of arrogance as if God is entitled to do
[21:26] certain things because because the
[21:28] people believe that Saints is not like
[21:31] that what God honors is his word not
[21:35] just hearers of the word but doers of
[21:38] the word and I want to prove to you
[21:40] tonight that is God's plan and program
[21:43] that each one of us bear a reproach for
[21:47] the word so let's
[21:49] continue now he said God has a time and
[21:52] season for that time to fulfill his
[21:55] Works God knows exactly L what he's
[21:58] going to do we don't we just have to
[22:01] receive it as he gives it to us and he
[22:03] knows there's nothing going to go wrong
[22:06] with it he has planned to what he's
[22:08] planned to do it has all got to come
[22:10] about and sometimes here we go rugged
[22:14] and hard things only bring out the real
[22:16] true nature of the object a see must die
[22:20] and rut and smell in order to bring for
[22:23] new life and listen to this partner God
[22:27] sets a
[22:28] and has a purpose for everything that he
[22:30] does there is nothing happen just
[22:33] accidentally to those who love the Lord
[22:36] and a call according to his calling we
[22:38] are predestinated and everything works
[22:41] just right for that because you cannot
[22:43] lie he said that was so and everything
[22:46] has its time here we go It season and it
[22:50] has its way and God is behind every move
[22:54] and this is a problem here people not
[22:56] seeing God behind things they're seeing
[22:58] flesh and blood and they're fighting
[23:00] this and fighting that but if you begin
[23:02] to pull back a bit and watch to see God
[23:06] behind what is taking place sometimes
[23:08] here we go you think that everything is
[23:11] going wrong it's up to us those things
[23:14] are put Upon Us trials and wonderings
[23:19] what is it it is testings to see how we
[23:23] will react on an action now you remember
[23:26] this story about a brandham making love
[23:28] and kind in the church and God dropped
[23:31] down and tell him what he what to do if
[23:33] they say blind they'll be blind you say
[23:35] dead they will die and so like that
[23:37] right and he said I forgive you and then
[23:40] the Holy Spirit fell and God was pleased
[23:43] and here what he said here
[23:45] now I believe all these things have a
[23:48] meaning what would you do with the power
[23:52] how what is your reaction to an action
[23:55] something that has come as an act how
[23:58] they react to that action do you
[24:01] understand remember the word and this is
[24:04] the most important part when to get to
[24:06] you tonight the word has always bought a
[24:10] reproach All Through the Ages God's
[24:14] anointed word has always been reproached
[24:18] and that's the reason it is so hard for
[24:21] people who doesn't understand would know
[24:26] how to accept that reproach so you've
[24:29] got to know how to
[24:31] accept what the world see as a reproach
[24:35] for your baroness our baroness and we
[24:37] can't produce a lot of thing that we
[24:39] speak on and preach on and teach on and
[24:41] Believe on we are yet to produce a lot
[24:44] of stuff and we could be criticized
[24:48] laughed at mocked and scuffed and you
[24:50] have to manage that you have to accept
[24:53] the fact and I remember an experience I
[24:55] had when I was in John Dawson techn Tech
[24:57] Institute doing electrical engineering
[25:00] and I used to stutter I had a stuttering
[25:03] sort of thing and they had a day I was
[25:06] talking about the prophet and the
[25:07] messenger I was testifying witnessing
[25:08] the people and I think I Shar this
[25:11] before and somebody challenged me on the
[25:13] messes of y b is a false prophet and and
[25:17] when I be to talk I be to stutter and
[25:20] the person said look at him you can't
[25:22] even talk you know and fumbling and it
[25:24] was a terrible experience people around
[25:27] laughing and everything else but I
[25:29] walked from dear couldn't finish my
[25:32] sentence but still believe what I
[25:34] believe in my heart it didn't stop me
[25:36] from testifying it didn't stop me from
[25:38] witnessing but I believe what God
[25:40] promised in this song we have to accept
[25:44] the reproach of the world even sisters
[25:46] wear in a dress long dress um people
[25:49] make make comments on it and you could
[25:51] try to Skittle that that by having kind
[25:54] of KN cutting thing and S that you don't
[25:56] want to Bear the approach you don't want
[25:59] to feel out of sort you don't want to
[26:01] feel different from the rest so you find
[26:03] yourself doing things and acting no way
[26:06] to blending with the rest of the crow
[26:07] that means you don't want no reproach
[26:08] you don't want to Bear any pain any
[26:11] suffering any upset but the word has
[26:15] always bore a reproach he said can you
[26:18] remember disciples returning
[26:20] rejoicing and he said all that live
[26:24] Godly in Christ shall suffer persecution
[26:28] that is the reproach for the world and
[26:30] here is bum you always have to stand
[26:33] this reproach in order to give you
[26:37] tested all right so here we go if
[26:41] character is a
[26:43] victory and character is based upon the
[26:46] test that we get and the test that we
[26:50] get is based upon the reproach then
[26:52] reproach should be welcomed and and your
[26:55] reproach our reproach my reproach is
[26:58] based upon our standing for the word we
[27:01] not talking about reproach for stealing
[27:02] or rubbing or holding up somebody or
[27:04] doing some crazy stuff we talking about
[27:06] for the word sake the word that you
[27:08] believe and the word that you believe
[27:11] that God promised all right so watch you
[27:15] always have to stand this reproach in
[27:17] order to give you a testing and every
[27:20] man that comes to Christ must supp be
[27:22] child trained now remember this is the
[27:25] hard partner if you can just keep quiet
[27:30] so you have to kind of carry on what
[27:31] you're going through I can't take it no
[27:33] more and you know that kind of drama if
[27:36] you can just keep quiet remember here we
[27:38] go and this is where trust comes in in
[27:41] what is about to be spoken if he has
[27:44] called you for this there is nothing can
[27:47] keep it from happening there is not
[27:50] enough Devil's in torment but what God's
[27:52] word will make manifest you are born for
[27:55] a purpose and nobody can take your place
[27:57] you might have impersonators everything
[27:59] else they will never take your place God
[28:03] word will Triumph it cannot fail there
[28:06] is where every Christian ought to stand
[28:09] knowing that God that that God would
[28:12] will tra it cannot fail and trials will
[28:14] come up and seem every way to you but
[28:17] remember God has a purpose and it will
[28:20] work right God has a purpose and it will
[28:24] work right you believe that tonight that
[28:25] it will work out right okay okay we
[28:28] on speak about Abraham right father of
[28:32] Nations 25
[28:34] years
[28:36] Sarah what did Abraham said he stack not
[28:39] of the promise of God to unbelief what
[28:42] is embarrassment God a son coming a son
[28:45] coming talking only prophesying you only
[28:48] prophesying about a son name Isaac
[28:49] coming and 5 years P 10 years past 15
[28:52] years all you is are talking Church all
[28:54] is are talking people you are talking
[28:55] man but Abraham staggered not at the
[28:58] promise of God to unbelief why and he
[29:01] said you said you pray for so and so it
[29:03] didn't get well that doesn't matter if I
[29:05] pay for 10,000 tonight and 10,000 die in
[29:07] morning tomorrow night I'm still
[29:09] anointing the sick and praying for them
[29:11] God said so it doesn't stop it a bit I
[29:15] believe it certain don't make any
[29:17] difference what they say they will Scuf
[29:20] but that's the reproach of the world you
[29:22] have to manage scuence you have to
[29:23] manage critici people criticizing and so
[29:26] on this is just part of it and then he
[29:27] said this we Abraham here we go standing
[29:30] on God's
[29:32] word finally it was
[29:35] fulfilled watch the scuff of
[29:39] baronet the scuff of baronet being
[29:43] scuffed and the reproach of barness
[29:46] sometime your wife could scuff at you
[29:48] your husband could scuff at you your
[29:50] children could scuff they don't believe
[29:53] your testimony they don't believe your
[29:55] story she had to stand the reproach of
[29:58] being Barren for all these years she was
[30:01] nearly 100 years old she was 90 Abraham
[30:04] baren both of their bodies as good as
[30:06] dead but God kept his word in that Dark
[30:09] Hour Isaac was born God always answers
[30:13] his word yes baress first then Isaac
[30:17] what baress first so God says he given
[30:22] the people opportunity to mock to laugh
[30:24] y Thunders where's the new name Thunders
[30:26] where the Revival have thunders this and
[30:28] all kind of drama and question they want
[30:30] to ask all because you confess the word
[30:34] that are 20th century Prophet brought
[30:37] and people have issues with that but bar
[30:40] is first then Isaac because when Isa
[30:43] come it shuts the mouth of the critics
[30:45] that is what that is about when the
[30:47] manifestation comes it shut the MTH of
[30:49] the critics they say we we don't a
[30:51] prophesy but the Bible said in R 10811
[30:54] don't almost prophesy again we only
[30:56] prophesy because the time is not yet
[30:58] once it is manifested then we don't to
[31:01] prophesy anymore we say this day this
[31:03] script is fulfilled all right just about
[31:05] two more and me close Mary Mary and
[31:09] Joseph Joseph Mary is showing pregnant
[31:13] and she's not married and she's holding
[31:16] on to God's
[31:17] promise and he said they could see
[31:20] Joseph say people saying you're Maring a
[31:21] prostitute remember adultery was debt in
[31:24] those days and you know God was dealing
[31:27] with him Mary know that the word was
[31:29] written the angel spoke to her the Holy
[31:31] Spirit come down and never spoke to the
[31:34] whole congregation here we go he spoke
[31:36] to them so sometimes what God is
[31:39] speaking is not to everyone what is
[31:41] speaking to you a virgin shall conceive
[31:43] and be a child Joseph know that right
[31:46] Joseph looked and before the angel visit
[31:49] him and said I love her I'm a righteous
[31:51] man I can't marry a woman like that but
[31:54] the angel of the Lord appeared to him in
[31:56] a dream Joseph thought son of David fear
[31:58] not to take unto thee Mary thy wife for
[32:01] that which has conceived in her is of
[32:03] the Holy Spirit what a comfort so Mary
[32:06] on her Road people laughing people
[32:09] mocking but they don't know the
[32:11] scriptures Shea go and hide in her room
[32:14] and say oh God I can't take it no more I
[32:16] ain't going nowhere no no no she has to
[32:18] have normal living because the Bible
[32:20] said a virgin shall conceive all right
[32:24] so when the angel appeared to Mary oh sh
[32:27] these things be see I know not a man he
[32:29] said the Holy Ghost is going to
[32:30] overshadow you that Holy thing will be
[32:33] born in you will be called The Son of
[32:35] God what about the bride today the
[32:37] secret is what the word is in the bride
[32:39] the word is in you you like a dry seed
[32:41] waiting for the upper room uh experience
[32:43] or The Upper Room Dynamics or The Upper
[32:45] Room Marine which will bring your seed
[32:48] to life so the scuffers name scuff that
[32:51] I'm carrying and here's the problem as
[32:54] we close he said the people are always
[32:57] trying to manufacture something so
[32:59] because they don't want to be a reproach
[33:01] they have to manufacture all kind of
[33:03] stuff to make it appear to be bride
[33:05] inverted comment bride um you know and
[33:09] manufacture they come like they say
[33:12] every Revival have his own songs so as
[33:14] long as the church produces songs that
[33:16] the bright songs and so on so they have
[33:19] bright songs and you know this is the
[33:21] Bride is a bride is a bride but in the
[33:23] real evidence or confirmation of the
[33:26] prophet's prophecy it is not there so we
[33:28] don't want to manufacture anything that
[33:31] doesn't make any sense he says the Sheep
[33:33] doesn't manufacture W no the Sheep Bears
[33:37] will we are not called to manufacture
[33:39] the fruit of the spirits we are called
[33:41] to Bear the fruit of the spirit the
[33:44] Sheep produce wo because what is on the
[33:46] inside so God by predestination calls
[33:50] who he will he gives the kingdom whoever
[33:52] who desires to give it to as we close
[33:56] God remember remembered
[33:57] Rachel God hearkened to her and opened
[34:01] her womb and she conceived and be a son
[34:05] and said God had taken away my reproach
[34:09] and call his name Joseph and the bride
[34:12] day will produce a son do the perfection
[34:16] even Christ that Perfection will be
[34:19] produced by an end time BR God will take
[34:23] away your reproach our reproach the
[34:27] bride
[34:28] reproved and I think the last one I want
[34:30] to the Bible talk about Abram as the end
[34:33] skip that
[34:35] Hannah Hannah is an interesting case
[34:39] because she was mocked she was scuffed
[34:42] at she was ridicule she was barring but
[34:47] like us here tonight she was praying Eli
[34:50] came out he thought he was drunk she say
[34:53] I'm not drunk I'm praying that God would
[34:56] take away my reproach he said the Lord
[34:59] God grant the thy request now here this
[35:02] part this is
[35:04] beautiful God could have placed little
[35:06] Samuel right in Hannah's arm all of us
[35:09] knows that he's the creator of all
[35:11] things just it into existence he could
[35:14] have put it right in Hannah's arms but
[35:16] instead of doing that it was the regular
[35:20] procedure n months before the little
[35:23] baby come he could have done it
[35:25] instantly but he didn't do it instantly
[35:29] if he give her the promise and she but
[35:32] and she inherit he just give her the
[35:34] promise and she inherited the promise
[35:37] here we go now Church hope you get this
[35:40] tonight if what God promis you he give
[35:45] you
[35:46] instantly you have no reproach to go
[35:48] through or give the Lord some Praises I
[35:51] want you to think about that tonight if
[35:54] what God promised you he give you as an
[35:57] instant you have no reproach to go to
[36:00] but he set it up that way that you have
[36:04] a reproach to go through a reproach of
[36:07] baress scess of baress and after you go
[36:10] through that reproach you inherit the
[36:12] promise and Hannah is that Tye oh praise
[36:16] the Lord oh give the Lord some Praises
[36:19] tonight thank you Jesus thank you Jesus
[36:24] so God when he give them the land he
[36:27] said it's a good land I give you this
[36:29] this is yours but you have to deal with
[36:31] the Hittites and the jeites and the
[36:32] parasites and you have to drive them out
[36:34] so friends I want to encourage you
[36:36] tonight don't sweat it with the reproach
[36:39] of the word don't sweat it for people
[36:43] criticizing laughing and mocking your
[36:45] face clean and they want to say you know
[36:48] do this put on a lipstick put this put
[36:50] this and just smile nicely and say thank
[36:53] you but no thanks that is not how I want
[36:55] to be I choose this Ro they laugh and
[36:59] Mock and scuff let them laugh you may
[37:00] feel bad because you have to learn
[37:05] to uh how to say you have to learn to
[37:09] understand what this is in bearing this
[37:11] Repro and accept this Repro Peter
[37:15] after fighting with Christ or working
[37:18] with Christ and tting out devils and so
[37:20] on when it come to Gethsemane when it
[37:22] comes to the cross and Jesus dying Peter
[37:25] denied Christ and he was ashamed he was
[37:28] embarrassed and he could remember in his
[37:30] mind Jesus said after he converted St
[37:32] the he had to be a reproach and how
[37:35] sheepishly Peter must have come in the
[37:36] upper room you know embarrassed of his
[37:39] behavior but he was human he was a
[37:42] normal man and he has to go through his
[37:43] stuff and yet he was under a promise of
[37:46] the Holy Ghost we tonight are under a
[37:48] promise we refuse to accept anything
[37:51] less than what God promised for this
[37:53] hour we refuse to accept less than the
[37:56] same page the Peter had and all of them
[37:58] had I as your pastor refuse to accept
[38:02] that it's just church and just talk and
[38:04] just text and just sharing stuff and
[38:06] whatnot I believe in my heart as the
[38:09] heart pant after the water we have to
[38:11] pant after God I believe with all my
[38:14] heart that we are called to thirst after

[1:33:47] recognize Lord that you have put the
[1:33:49] word in US you have put the Sword and
[1:33:51] the Shi shield and the helmet and all
[1:33:53] the equipment is Le in your word that we
[1:33:54] can dress ourselves with blessed service
[1:33:56] is coming Sunday father may your
[1:33:58] presence p in a mighty mighty way bless
[1:34:01] bless the youth service tomorrow father
[1:34:03] God may your visit young people in
[1:34:05] special all those who make it out Lord
[1:34:07] oh God we ask that you touch them in a
[1:34:10] special way in Jesus name I ask it amen
[1:34:13] and amen praise the Lord God bless you
[1:34:15] again thank you again for being here
[1:34:17] tonight want to remind you about the
[1:34:19] youth service tomorrow all is in invited
[1:34:22] even though you're not young you want to
[1:34:24] come and pray and you want to come and
[1:34:25] give support but more importantly there
[1:34:27] are things that you could always learn
[1:34:29] you know sometimes the young people see
[1:34:31] us older ones as if we were born old as
[1:34:34] we were never young the reality is we
[1:34:37] were young and many times in marriage in
[1:34:39] homes in family in parenting there was
[1:34:42] there's no school of parenting there's
[1:34:43] no school of marriage and all parents
[1:34:46] and families and families around do the
[1:34:48] best that they can with the tools that
[1:34:50] they have and sometimes as you grow
[1:34:52] older you begin to learn stuff that you
[1:34:54] wish you knew when you were much younger
[1:34:56] so sometimes the empowerment is not just
[1:34:59] for the young people but the empowerment
[1:35:01] is also for the older ones that they
[1:35:02] could Empower their children or
[1:35:04] grandchildren or other young people that
[1:35:05] they will encounter in life not because
[1:35:07] you're old you only meeting old people
[1:35:10] but you might be older but you might
[1:35:12] meet young people how do you relate to
[1:35:14] them how do you connect to them how do
[1:35:16] you communicate with them and all of
[1:35:18] this is part of the package that helps
[1:35:20] us to be who we are and how we can
[1:35:23] effectively help our people so pray and
[1:35:26] if you could come out and make it up do
[1:35:27] come out and give support and and if you
[1:35:31] want to be able to in a position to to
[1:35:34] support and encourage a young man a
[1:35:36] young woman young son or young daughter
[1:35:39] going through life trials and they are
[1:35:40] facing things that we ourselves at at
[1:35:43] that age did not face and they have to
[1:35:45] face it and we want to give them their
[1:35:46] support to encourage them that they can
[1:35:48] make it so may God bless you thanks
[1:35:50] again for being here tonight
[1:35:52] and I love and appreciate you God
[1:35:57] bless
