tonight and we thank you for this great privilege of given unto us to stand in this last day Grant your word have the prominences tonight in Jes I ask it God bless you and welcome it's good to be here tonight and have two portion of scripture Ephesians 6 want to read 10 to8 and 2 Corinthians 10 we want to read from verse 3 to 6 Ephesians 6 and 2 Corinthians 10 Ephesians 6 10 finally my brethren be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might put on the whole armor no no so they not talk about weakness talk about be strong in the Lord but under the whole armor of God that you may be able to stand against the Ws of the devil for We R not against flesh and blood but against principalities against Powers against rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness and high places wherefore take unto you the whole armor of God that you may be able to withstand in the evil day having an all to stand stand therefore having your loin sced about with truth having on the breastplate of righteousness your feet shed with the preparation of the gospel of peace above all taking the shield of Faith whereit you shall be able to quench all the far rarts of the wicked take the helmet of salvation the sword of the spirit which is the word of God praying all with all prayer and supplication in the spirit and watching there unto unto all perseverance and supplication of All Saints second Corinthians 10 want to read from verse three for though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh for the weapons of our Warfare are not caral but Mighty through God in the pulling down of strongholds casting down imaginations and every High thing that exalted itself against the knowledge of God and bringing into captivity every thought to to The Obedience of Christ and having in a Readiness to Revenge all Disobedience when your obedience is fulfilled may God bless his word you may be seated praise God we are so grateful it's always a blessing to be in the house of God and a privilege and you have to be uh you know knowing in your heart that you want to apply what you're hearing so I have a title tonight know your enemy and have an inspir ation discern and withstand know your enemy you have to know your enemy because if you don't know your enemy you say you'll get lick up you'll get wiped out because you don't know your enemy you don't know what he looks like you don't know how how the enemy coming you got to know your enemy amen praise God because remember uh Satan was kicked out of heaven God gave him and he got kicked out and he fell on the Earth yes so he really not really estab he he really doesn't belong here in that sense this is where he fell and humans are here human the Battle of angels become the Battle of men is isn't that right so let's go now but BR he said now oh my should I read this if you are the bride all right I think I'll come back to that all right there has to be a place selected for this battle to start to rage and he said the battle is where the human mind when this great battle started on Earth there had to be a mutual meeting place there had to be a place elected for the battle to begin and for battle to rage and that Battleground begins in the human mind so the devil have no entrance unless we allow him because these Tabernacles or vessels or Temple don't belong to the devil it belongs to God so in other words the devil was seeking access to what he couldn't have with Adam and that's why he approached Eve do you understand that and by getting ease to reason and disbelieve God's word the devil got access and that's how Adam end up losing his rights to the inheritance his rights to the Earth that's how Adam lost the deed because in other words a back door was open amen and the devil got access as long and and that was so powerful I so enjoyed that a Sunday Jesus said he has nothing in me I there's nothing in me that belongs to him so he can't make no claims on me there's no lust there's no trying to steal and anger and temper and hatred that is he and nothing that I have in me belongs to him therefore he has no power over me Oh Glory to God and when God do that work in you that there there is nothing in you that belongs to the devil he has no power over you oh glory to God so then you have to come to the recognition now not only does he have no power over you but you have power over him oh glory to God then you recognize the whole thing transfer Oh Glory to God for you being under the subjection of the devil to the devil under your feet oh give the Lord some Praises do you get it now right now you might be in subjection to the devil but we are saying there's a shifting that going to happen with a revelation coming to you as you find your position as you find your place in Christ you begin to understand this is a genuine war and you are part of it ready or not like it or not Oh Glory to God you are part of this war this battle is ring tonight oh give the Lord some Praises Hallelujah and the battlegr begins in the human mind there is where the battle starts the human mind was chosen for the place of the battle so don't bother with what going on praise God you have to accept the fact that that that mind battle have to come everybody have it the pastor have it the Elder have it the Deacon have it every man Jack on earth have it because that is the ground the battle is a mind and if we get that mind set up right we we'll overcome we'll get the victory praise God hallelujah praise God so the devil want to disguise himself and don't show himself as the devil devil that's what Jesus did by Jesus beginning to cast out devils and expose Satan Kingdom he couldn't hide no more the deaf can't hide the blind cannot hide the dead can't even hide nobody could hide because Jesus was like light exposing Darkness Oh Glory the lepers couldn't hide even lepers comeing to him they couldn't cure leprosy he said Go and show yourself to the priest so all the Demons of sicknesses and disease and depression and frustration and he exposed them oh glory to God and he proved they were under his feet he said I by the Finger of God cast them out oh glory to God he wasn't even using his whole hand he was only using the Finger of God oh give the Lord a shout hle if I by the Finger of God cast them out what are your sons casting them by oh give the Lord some Praises so this Battleground is in the human mind five senses affection conscience reason imagination this battle is a battle of Faith versus reasoning it's Revelation versus say reasoning Oh Glory to God is revelation versus reasoning if you could get past your reasoning tonight and break into divine revelation have your battle over Oh Glory to God hallelujah praise God when when the Revelation Shu Peter what did Jesus said th at Peter he identified who he was he talking about all the rest of the Brethren he wasn't talking to them I said that th at Peter and Upon This Rock Hallelujah God want to speak to you tonight not just generalize got on to you this rock wasn't that people get thoughts and get ideas about who Jesus is you know the issue here was he heard from Heaven that was the rock you know because somebody can tell somebody he he's Jesus the Christ you know that's information that is telling the person that see it Jesus ask them and say don't the Christ and Jesus didn't say nothing because somebody tell him to say that he's repeating somebody who has a revelation repeating the Revelation somebody has doesn't give you the Revelation do you get that saying what others say that doesn't mean you have that Revelation you know you talking the talk the message talk but we not talking about that we talking about when the spirit revealed to you as an individual that your Warfare is over Hallelujah that you are free that your deliverance had come oh glory to God that King cometh lowly Hallelujah the king come suddenly to his Temple when God revealed to you that y has come for total Liberation total Victory total Deliverance total freedom it has to strike you so I want you to know tonight Satan is not trying to play with you he's trying to destroy you and destroy your family you'll be a idiot a fool not a think so your money can't stop him your fancy bedroom or bathroom or house can't stop him he has one objective to steal to Rob and to destroy and the battle is about to start people don't want to say Amen on that did thing the battle already you see the battle yet when Dynamics come the battle begins because Satan could effectively anoint his ministers in the message under the Matthew 242 for yes and anoint the people in the message the church under second Timothy he and high minded and God will anoint a bride second Peter 1 14-7 with faith and virtue and knowledge oh give the Lord some Praises Hallelujah so Christ anointed in other words the bride anointed would be Christ the word itself not an interpretation of it and that bride have to come forward first God have to witness the bride first before anybody else because the true anointed comes forth first when they step forward first then others will get it then they going say we have it too Hallelujah but that silver dollar that original dollar going to come forth Hallelujah first you are God's money on the Earth you are God currency on the earth even though they stamp on you you're still with it as I see somebody talking about $100 $100 your stamping it is still $100 your crumit is still $100 Oh Glory to God and what the devil do to you you are still who you are and nothing will change that or cancel that Paul said it this way praise God what can separate me from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus shall trials and testings and tribulations things to come and things what and all all the devil trying do the G of the word as long as you stay in that word the devil in trouble because that's the word that bust him in the beginning oh give the Lord some Praises Hallelujah he catch Noah drinking he catch this one in slaus he get David in adultery he catch this one and that one but with Jesus Jesus said nothing it's written it's written it's written it's written you only serving him it's written it's written the devil don't know where he coming or going or give the Lord a shout in the house Jesus never declared by power who he was he didn't need that he knew who he was oh give the Lord a shout and he had faith in who he was and the bride will have that same revelation of who she is and have faith in who she is and you're going to have faith in the anointing that God put on you because God has released an anointing upon your life let Give the Lord some Praises do you get that tonight you have to accept that I have an anointing upon me I have faith in it oh give the Lord some Praises I have faith coming here tonight to minister this word and to preach his gospel you got to know your enemy oh give the Lord some Praises hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory to God the bride five-fold Ministry men in the body and Matthew 24 is fivefold too out of the body not not in the body the fivefold ministry is Pastor teacher Prophet Accord to Ephesians 4 4 to scriptures the Church of that four Ministry second Peter F your knowledge and Temperance that's the True Believer right there so don't let numbers fool you big congregation fool you everybody getting the anointing so right now we excited and talk abouted atmosphere just the atmosphere everybody even Pope getting are you shocked the prophet had a vision man SW a seed and then and then weeds come up and then everybody calling for the rain rain rain and what happened ride the fall then every seat bring after this sky so the battle my friends is about to start this church Wars un foolishness Satan just sit back relax and Minister fight another church fight another he not part of that them and the foolishness and the bad attitude and the jealousy and the envy and he let them loosen and they playing and they posing pit and playing it and Blasting this one and Blasting that one and have no all the Antics no power at all you know no zero power what brown whatever God did in the beginning remains and the tactics of reasoning is what Satan used and that what he ever uses reasoning we know our enemy because our Brethren I have I have let away from Doctrine you see but I've got to say this said these words any enemy he say this way any person any church any organization any individual that reasons against one punctuation of God's word word is your [Music] enemy a nice brother he a nice enemy then because he of the word the word not only is God you know the word is also Spirit words are Spirit yes both word word from God and word from the devil because people speak spirit yeah but BR somebody pick up in his car and he said they they spoke a Blue Streak and broke the anointing and after that he' be very careful who he let into his car because people walk with spirits and they speak and Spirit come out their mouth that's why you can't allow people to speak into your life that God didn't ordained to speak into your life do you get that and it have these spirits and people want to offer counseling want to offer guidance they married in samples but they want to marital counseling they have no husband but they want to Cel people with husband is the devil know is a spirit know and I don't think it strike us the way it's supposed to just yet that we wrestle not against flesh and Blood Brother Brown as well as these are know I'll skip that now we know we got counterfeits everywhere that's right it's a battle You' have got to know your enemy and you have got to know your armor what protects you that's why we read that scripture tonight and we find out you can't dress anyhow battle going gun shooting and you just Jersey tonight with a pant with split in it I feel like we're in a short pants the Bible talk about boots breastplate helmet it is specific it is the whole armor because the devil attacking us in no way so you can say you know what I feel to put on you know what I mean a tin cap then you put in you Patty cap like with little cone you want to put on a Patty cap you I feeling lead you feeling Le to die go will kill you when God say armor he means that I a feeling for no arm I go and pray going put on two hours of prayer the whole armor after a pray put on the armor put your armor and then go and pray but you can't just walk up with no armor and saying you're fighting so and you're fighting so and you're looking so and I it is scary for me when I hear some brethren speak the way they speak you know it is scary because God can lie you see God I say God cannot work outside his own laws when they say let Moses speak God can't change that after that he must s a prophet he can't coming down in Pillar of Fire on a mountain to talk to anybody in Trinidad and you had to go the mountain in Trinity Mountain P Spain from God he not doing that he set up a system that through the mouth of His prophets Faithful Men will come and bring the same word and Echo what the prophet said to his people and his people supposed to listen and apply the word he told Joshua Joshua the land is yours take it conquer it no he didn't tell Joshua that you know he told Joshua every place you put your foot is yours but if you want to have good success you have to meditate in the word no one again Wednesday night Sunday when I feel like it no day and night hallu are you doing thatall it's every day it becomes a habit that you're thinking about it you are meditating on it you you you it's it it it it it it affecting your mind what God is doing we talking about battle we talking about enemy we talking about a raging that is going on and you don't want to go lacad desal like if the devil not looking at you he put a Target on you he put a hit squad in you they are looking for you my God I was I said it before I say it again the devil is not concerned much with what you are now because you know what you was and he could tell himself you are the same person he know a lot of people change or they kind of what he's afraid of is what you can become if you get the knowledge Revelation and inspiration of God and that you could get God's desire in your heart because he knew what happened to Gideon and Barack and Samson and Jeffy and The Heroes of Faith he knew how they stood in their time oh CL the Lord some Praises he knew all Paul irus and Martin and Columba Luther and all these Messengers how they stood and people stood at their time because the people took the Revelation and became the word for their hour Give the Lord a shout in the house the people took the Revelation and became the word for the hour what about Malachi 4 Oh Glory to God when are we going to become the word for the hour the word that God could use the word that God could anoint the word that God could inspire you become the word itself Oh Glory to God let me change that you become the seed itself and rain looking for seed oh give the Lord some praises Give the Lord some Praises your seed life attracting rain glory to God your lamb life attracting Dove oh give the Lord a shout in the house your seed life attracting the rain the rain coming for you every SE going to bring forth after this time oh glory to God know your enemy every thought that's trying to hinder you that's your enemy Oh Glory to God every contrary and negative word coming to you that's your enemy if your wise speak is your enemy talking to your wife if your husband speak it is the Enemy talking to your husband if your mother speak it your father speak it I care who speak it enemy coming through all who speaking contrary to what God Said God can't lie God is faithful Sunday we find out he would never allow you to be tempted above what you could able to handle every test come your way God know you can handle it God said so God can't lie God is faithful oh give the Lord some Praises every test come your way you can handle it don't say you can't you [Applause] could don't come with I'm only human and we all Sinners don't come that talk all don't come with that talk we not talking that talk we talking about Jacob Grace Jo Perfection not I'm human and you know the flesh is weak Spirit willing liar you willing to fall hallelujah hallelujah you have to be willing to take the word this word hot and heavy like how God give Adam know when God dropped the word on Adam Eve wasn't there you know had no bar ROP or no marijuana no Vat 19 no cigarette no tamping no smoking no drinking no B Just the word Weighing on Adam eat of every tree but that tree don't eat that he didn't stop there because the day you eat that day you shall die surely die Hallelujah Adam claimed to love his wife so bad and CH de God run them out he cast them out who the son that he formed the son that was placed positionally you know the teacher placed positionally yeah God placed Adam positionally and kick him out 2 million people crying deliver deliver deliver 2 million people 400 years old man telling the children deliverer coming you and he Ding and the children dying too generation after generation 400 years when Moses come they come out dancing and shouting and Red Sea open up and oh we and they perish same God bring them kill them and the same God that bring people in this message will kill them in this message judgment is about to strike and judgment begins at the house of God let me say it again judgment is about to strike his years are preaching it and it going to happen God is not afraid to kill God is not afraid to judge God afraid to give sickness blind God afraid the do nothing of those things what God is concerned with is his word he is long time I haven't heard this he is no respector of persons whether somebody a prophet Pastor priest or King no respect her he respects his word and those and whoever will honor and receive and believe his word if you stand by his word going bless you he go bless you going in and bless you coming out oh give the Lord a shout hallelujah God going to bless youah what God bless no man could curse oh give the Lord some Praises tonight if your wife curs you she can't take the blessing of God from off of you oh oh glory to God I feel so good tonight that is so good to know God hand upon you oh the hand of the Lord was upon me and he carried me away in the spirit the hand of God oh glory to God people will see the hand of God upon you you know David said he prepares a table for me in the presence know your enemy in the presence of my enemy you're not running from the enemy you know God go in and set you up oh give the Lord some praise look at me excited go go and set you up to prepare a table for you in the front of your enemy in the front of them liars and accusers and everything he going to lay a table for you Hallelujah lay the cloth first lay the plate first let the knife and folk first Hallelujah a slow motion torture slow motion pressure as God lay the table so they can't believe it this not supposed to happen how could this happen I see him so I see him so they all so but you are a liar what God bless is bless Jacob I love Esau I hate oh give the Lord a shout come on Jacob Give the Lord some Praises inside of here your wrestling time coming your change coming your new name coming your Revival coming your deliverance coming your Dynamics and the mechanics it's coming [Music] too Hallelujah your armor is the word your enemy is something that reason against it now here the prophet says here now there's an old saying not so old people don't believe in demons in this day people don't believe in demons in this day but in my to my opinion is to know your enemy amen and to know your enemy and train for the contest that you're going to have when you meet him because you are going to meet him don't say Amen now you still going to meet him whether they say Amen or not but this thing just open up some things to me and to know him and know what his strength is and then train for this contest so when you do meet him for it's one thing sure you're going to meet him so train for the contest so when a boxer going in the ring the boxer say you know I mean and yes exercise a little bit and they say go and fight you go and get knock out you're not going and fight that doctor that box not ready yet he have to go through bouts of training exercise and everything else you to get knocked down because he had to learn how to take a punch you punch in the bag that you punch in the bag the bag punching you bag in the ring is not a you punching a b you punching somebody else that person come to fight you so bam says they treat you rough some people get rough treat they leave the church some get rough treatment they stop praying some people get rough treatment they still got overcome the rough treatment they can't something wrong with the pastor he treat more nicer and this and the batt even start this is what is scary you know when I see people can't manage their stories and manage their present issues they

come to his house he recognized the power on that man he recognized there's a man in a position of authority because he understood what Authority was so he was taking his revelation of authority and watching Jesus and say in the realm that that man operating in in the realm of the spirit that man is authorized to do what he does when a policeman in uniform he's authorizing if he comes out in I don't care is come out and recruit Tintin they eat enough food yet I look how thin and slim he is if he come out in the road and do so you better stop you know because he have backing of the entire

of the husband and the only place that you'll ever recognize it is to recognize what part of the husband that word you are you can't recognize being the bride how many sees that you can't recognize somebody else so you cannot recognize somebody's position he is this he is this you are not de God you're a de Placer you you could only recognize your position you see because God has to get us into that spot because only in our position we could have perfect Faith the anointing come upon you to give you a help of Faith but that's not what God really wants the revelation God wants to you is your position because in your position whether anointing is there or not is who you are so right now under your Fe thing you're feeling good you're feeling feel feel what you feel foolishness God want you completely out of that when when they say uh the daughter is sick and the man come out because time hiding daugh is sick they come and say nobody Master the daughter is dead Jesus said I go with Jesus

talking all the s seemar to me but that talking in Tong thing is to let people know well this anointing is here and them Liars living all kind of crazy lives but God have nothing to do with that God have to do with the word not your interpretation or feelings just what God Said and I believe that all of my heart I always look for God to light up the word itself there we go like Israel back there I'm going to say something National Force put Israel in a Homeland National Force will put the church in the work of the churches but press and play plain tape every service will put the people in The Bride they not here the power of God the man who knows the know all the Mysteries will put the people in The Bride the man who could explain the Mysteries I hear plenty NOS tonight give me a yes now is only no National Force will put the church in the work Con of churches but the power of God will put the people in The Bride we could stay right here what if every Minister on planet Earth preached that the power of God and if they don't have it we have to preach for the power of God we have to pray for the power of God we have to worship for the power of God we have to EXA Acclaim the power of

bride you're following me it have no word to follow me and not even using the scripture follow me as I follow Christ behave yourself behave yourself as Paul talking that talk I'm not saying that following this church doesn't put you in the bride listen to every convention that put you in bride conven bride it takes the power of God because we have to have faith that the body can be changed you have to have that faith that your body could be changed God can't stuff you down with it he said add to your faith virtue add to Virtue knowledge he said that there's a reason for that Anthony there some place when they had to meet you there's a meeting place when helicopter coming yeah not not that the meeting point the extraction point when they in war and whatnot they have um they say

it if you miss it tribulation for you oh give the Lord a shout in the house God have an extraction point and that point is at the top of the pyramid oh give the Lord I shout you have to stop on the top of the pyramid on top of Brotherly kindness that's the extraction point to come into the king sh oh give the Lord a shout you have to climb you have to get up there that helicopter is not coming on virtue and knowledge and these things it's coming on top the extraction point oh give the Lord I shou in the house brotherly kindness is that extraction point oh when the church finds his brotherly love when the church finds his holy disty when the church finds his place in Christ glory to God God have a plan God have a program and we cannot break it and we cannot change it oh give the Lord a shout I love that tonight Hallelujah the power coming on the extraction Point Oh Glory to God he said when a man have these virtues then the Holy Ghost comes upon him in the true baptism of the Holy Ghost we talking about love we talk about a baptism of love who could give that who could reveal that who could unfold that that doesn't come from a man when they were in the upper room they were in one mind they were in one Accord and when the day of Pentecost was fully come they heard a song from Heaven it wasn't a minister walking wasn't a minister talking it wasn't a minister explaining something happened at day and that's something going to happen to you same fire same power same anointing same presence same [Applause] emotions power of God am I from train that no a power of God but he of the word you you come hear liar the power of godu if we come here out of the Bride Ste it with your foolishness I will tell you shut your mouth liar you the power of God you ever forget if one thing you remember tonight is this the power of God will put the people in Bride I never sin I never come adultery never never a put you any bride never fail never fall you never you never never never never you keep your never never show God how much you never and when you hit god with that God say all have sined and come show The Glory say back to square one hallelujah hallelujah float in the air we wait till you come down and you walk in Normal normal normal keep floating Hallelujah you float you float like a brother say me he praying for me get to get deeper I say I said I come as as I could pray for my brother pray for my brother I try you find deep enough all right so the power God put the people in the briad the world forces this way the world forces that way but God for no I read so much times and I read it again tonight and it see seems so different here say the spirit of God which is the word of God my word is spirit and life will put the people in her place so the word is spirit and spirit is word so you can't take the word lightly the word that people reject is the spirit the bride will be Joseph who is that the word manifested rejected they reject us yet they we have a temporary rejection they reject us because of Revelation they affected by what we have as Revelation but they see nothing wait till they see manifestation for years the Revelation has been an issue now we not off the word we are on the word we preaching the Revelation as God revealed to us and that becomes an issue but that is nothing compared to when it get manifested but says when the stimulation of Revelation broke upon him in the upper room note my words now the stimulation of Revelation broke in the upper room they were like drunk men because Revelation is wine so when the wine hit them so them staggering like drunk men the devil the demons went and tell Satan Satan they car on up there he said he just excited but the devil didn't move because far as he concerned there is excited Bunch they just a little Above the Rest in the message they worshiping a little more they jumping and shouting and carrying on when Peter tell that man Silver and Gold Have I None such as I have I give and he man said to walk devil said this is serious we had to Calla a meeting we had to call all the elders in Hell whatever counsel you have down there we have to get the counselor together we have to stop this and then them demons drop on the counselor churches to stop them and get them l this is Apostle with licks this is Holy Ghost with licks you still want to have Holy Ghost is Holy Ghost plus licks I'm preaching tonight this is old time thing now they take them to beat them and inste them brothers take sick Le off and you know I mean I would be there tonight because I guess I'm blow close and something like that then talk that talk you know they say Lord send on your power that we can go and witness once more and he said the Dynamics of this church will be refilling of the Holy Ghost when they pray on the licks and they got a refilling on the licks okay the Lord I shout you get on Li yet you sitting on in nice Church peew oh give the Lord and praise my God you oh brother George we are so blessed tonight sitting on in nice church pews air condition hallelujah praise God sunshine in day time oh Hallelujah song service and everything else they coming to close us down oh give the Lords and praises you ain't get L yet they coming to close us down a prophet said that they comeing to press us but they can't press us out I love this message you know I love this message Hall I'm identified with what this message is it have all kind of craze house inside of it but I love it still I still love it give me the crazy house with it but I love it Hallelujah huah crazy people crazy ministers and Hallelujah crazy teaching and what not but brother here is the spirit of God which is the word of God trying to close my word is spirit and life will put the people in a place cause here what cause she would recognize her position in the word then she's in Christ that will put in the place and then I never notice this one he said no National Force will do it so no minister no group no Pastor could force a long time had a move a move of the Bride in Trinidad and a pastor tell me the time I to come to be part of the move and I wish him I laugh to myself he's on his own I said you controlling that a man declared this is the move of God's bride in Trinidad and every church had to come under this move well he had to move on you know because that's not in the word that's a man feelings that's a man idea that's a man thought and thinking that's not God thoughts God thoughts is this the bride had not a Revival yet amen there have been no uh thing manifestation of God to stir the bride he will send it he promised it that's all we have to say it's on its way because he promised it it didn't happen me yet it's on his way it it happened it past me it happen it past us so what we are foolish version what we must sit down and cry and die but I am saying the god that spoke to that Prophet don't t wait for it m come up please oh my Hallelujah let's see if we can wrap up here glory to God hallelujah praise God praise God praise God hallelujah praise God overcome means to recognize the devil and at every one of his tricks lots of people said there's no devil it's just a thought don't you believe that there's a real devil he's just as real as you are or anybody a real devil and you must recognize him real you must know he's a devil and then at the same time you recognize him know that he's a devil and he's against you to overcome you must recognize that the god in you is greater and mightier than he is so he is saying that we have to graduate from saying God is powerful God is great for you getting a revelation what's in you is greater than the devil out there he fell from heaven and you connected to God oh my brother BR I'll close with this one quote no I can't close yet we almost there we almost there remember Christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of Acts The Book of Revelation shows how the Antichrist Spirit the spirit now would come into the church the message and defile it making it lukew the message formal in the message and Powerless in the message it exposes Satan revealing works praise God isn't that right he said he cannot stand it he knows if the people get the true revelation of the true church what she is what she stands for and that she can do the Greater Works she will be an invincible Army if they get a true Revelation Hallelujah of what of the two Spirits working in the framework of the church Hallelujah and by God's spirit discern and with stand is I take a picture of him send us on WhatsApp no discern and with if you discern it stand up against it resist it fight it back you have to glory to God watch this here deser and withand the anr spirit Satan will be P before her he will be definitely tarted today as when Christ with stod his every effort to gain power desert Satan hates Revelation but we love it with true Revelation in our lives the Gates of Hell shall not preval against it Oh Glory to God I'm going to close but I have something very important that I need to share with you because you see after all we wrestling against the Flesh and Blood against Prince of power and then we have been exalted now to put on the whole armor and the whole armor is to be able to withstand in that evil day having done all to S and it came with a question have you done all this stand you see having done all the stand then he could stand all right so watch if you are not dressed correctly you will be vulnerable to the attacks of the enemy you

the full armor consists of many parts you can't have one part and say that you addressed our faith our faith our faith see which part that is it have other parts it have defensive parts of the armor and have the active parts of the armor so watch the full armor consists of many parts and you can have one part and you canot say you addressed each part is for a specific purpose the weapons of our Warfare are not carnal the first one is the Bible call it uh having your Lo good about with truth that's around your waist that's like a belt first thing is truth isn't that right and that truth means

shalt be able to number them he say so shall I he be and this is the verse I want to get to and he belied in the Lord and he counted it for him for righteousness oh give the Lord a shout in the house
