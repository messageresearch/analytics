Matthew chapter 16 reading from verse 13. when Jesus came under the coast of caesarea Philippi he asked the disciples saying whom do men say that I the son of man am they said some seed at our John the Baptist some Elias others Jeremiah's one of the prophets he said unto them but who is he that I am Simon Peter answered and said thou art this Christ the son of the Living God and Jesus answered and said unto him blessed are thou summoned by Jonah for Flesh and Blood had not revealed unto thee but my Father which is in heaven and I see unto Thou Art Peter and Upon This Rock I rebuild my church on the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it and I will give unto thee the keys Kingdom of Heaven and whatsoever though shall bind on Earth shall be bound in heaven whatever shall loosen it shall be loosed in heaven I read in James chapter 2 I want to read from verse 15. and if a brother or sister be naked and destitute of daily food and one of you say unto them departing peace be warm and filled notwithstanding you give them not those things which are needful to the body what does it profit even so fit if it had not works is dead my feet by my works they'll believe us that there is one God they'll do as well the Devils also believe on Trimble but will thou all know will thou know over in man that faith without works is dead was not Abraham or father justified by works when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar see his doll feet wrought with works and by works was feed me perfect and the scripture was fulfilled which said Abraham believed God it was imputed unto him for righteousness and he was called the friend of God you see then how that by works a man is Justified and not by faith only let us pray father we have read your word and we thank you for your word we are grateful for the scriptures that is being made alive in Israel and I pray tonight that the word become flesh and dwell Among Us father may I take the word and maybe like a direct arrow to the house of your people made anchor in their souls and maybe a transformational service where their lives will be completely transformed by this blessed word of God in Jesus I ask it amen and amen you may be seated or praise the name of the Lord It's always a blessing and a privilege to be in the house of God I don't have a title reaction of faith praise God feet come by here and here in the word is not right the last of us we had hearing receiving and acting on the word tonight we're talking about the action of Faith another inspiration the call of God I believe each one of you here tonight have a call of God upon your life is that man that called you is God that called you it's not your family called you it's a calling of God I want you to that to Anchor inside your spirit inside your heart that there's a call of God upon your life he didn't call you when he was good and nice and he was righteous he called it when he was filthy and he was no good it's a call for for Just As You Are and you came Just As You Are but he didn't leave you just as you are he began to tidy you up and clean you up because he was born in sin and they coming shaping iniquity or all Filthy all nasty and rotten and so on but he said you are my child and I coming back for you I'm coming I'm coming to redeem you praise God I'm not coming just to bless you anymore to bring you back because you were somewhere before and the scripture clearly states who even knew he called so if you have to be in God's for knowledge to get the calling of God let me say it again you have to be you had to be in God's for knowledge to get the calling of God so that is why Jesus had the ability to see Peter come and you come because he knew those guys names was on the book came to call them Direct Call Hallelujah that was Jesus word made flesh calling these disciples but he released his spirit because he has a man outstanding there in Jerusalem and in Israel and so on like that he could do so much and no more but when his spirit is released it released throughout the whole Earth seven spirits released throughout the whole earth to find every predestinated seed I think the internet have billions of people how much billions not millions billions connected to the internet that is man Science and Technology accomplish that but God don't need internet God need just a spirit what the spirit begin to move it could reach but I'm gonna say the Holy Ghost will drop will go across the world overnight overnight the entire world overnight with a wonderful glorious baptism of the Holy Ghost overnight I am standing here to you tonight and we are few in numbers that have nothing to do with this omnipotent power that is about to be released you sit here ordinary but you don't know what about to take place something great something magnificent something powerful about a Breakout nothing could stop it Oh Glory because no man could stop it not your past can even stop it the mouth of the Lord had spoken it he spoke to the prophets I will restore that I have nothing with you you can't stop the restoration that God prophesy over your life Oh Glory to God I will restore to you the years you can't even stop that God promised a bumper crop go somewhere to bring back the oil and the wine god promise me bring back the figs we produce in its strength that means you're gonna have production you wouldn't be burying it on fruitful but you will have a living faith and live in virtue living knowledge and live in Temperance I live in patience I live in godliness and living brotherly kindness this thing you're gonna live whatever I'm said the house of God will live again this Bright Tree would live again the devil cutter down but God said I'm gonna restore your glory to God hallelujah praise God oh give them some Praises tonight do you believe this is a word for you tonight Oh Glory nobody and I want to see the action of faith in your spirit in your soul in your heart Peter couldn't help it because inspiration knew upon Peter you may be seated praise God o glory to God hallelujah question Jesus asks the question who do men say I am some said this some say that and it's easy to talk about what other people say yeah yeah you could Rara and talk all night about what people talking about but when he asked the disciples who do you say I am they got caught because all of a sudden they realized they don't know they just know he's a messiah he's a master teacher he's Healing The Sick this whatever whatever but they don't know who that man really is and all of a sudden inspiration move upon Peter anoint and move upon Peter fire jump upon Peter because he's a channel to get inspiration because he's a son he's a seed he don't have the Holy Ghost yet but he could get Revelation he don't have the Holy Ghost yet but he could be inspired he don't have the Holy Ghost yet but the call of God is upon his life that's why Jesus came to him and Peter dropping that channel number toward the Christ the son of the Living God and Jesus said Flesh and Blood did not reveal that to you so Revelation is Supernatural God give the Lord a shout Revelation is not natural Leverage is Supernatural you could study that is not Revelation that is study you can get information that is not Revelation Revelation when the spirit reveals it and when the spirit reveals it it comes he confirms it okay the Lord I shout so we're not talking about knowledge we're not talking about intellectual information we're talking about divine revelation that's why the prophet these divinely reveal mystery troops not just revealed but divinely revealed not man interpreted not man revealed but divinely revealed when you hear from Heaven Oh Glory to God Seven Thunders will unlock the heaven when they are spoken by Revelation Revelation have to speak this word divine revelation Oh Glory to God praise God [Music] let me just read something here for you brother Branham he's in here I didn't feel this resentment from my other word I feel no your welcome spirit that you are a Believer and I want you to come just closer to me I am not trying to read your mind sir at all you don't believe that do you no because that would be something that you had on your mind I pray that God will go back and do something that's not even on your mind so you will know he said no uh there's something wrong with you no doubt he said you wouldn't have gotten that prayer card you you come here to be prayed for you confess your faith by believing that he will heal you no what I'm trying to do now is speak to you to contact your human Spirit your faith you see your feet operate this gift your feet brings it down on me so the prophet was going down with discernment to activate the faith because the faith is not going to bring this thing down on him oh Hallelujah another one thanks be to our Lord Jesus Christ who brought again the spirit of God and the resurrected Christ who is present tonight to heal all that is in need he is here friends I have no way of bringing him to you only your faith brings him present [Applause] so I want to show you the importance of you having faith sitting there and having the expectation sitting there you're not just going to hear the preacher expong and hear a teacher Teach an information you're here to be a participant here to get in the spirit you have to receive from God Peter was one of the disciples but Peter got involved he got caught up somehow he gets into our Channel where the spirit could drop down upon him and he can say talk about the Christ so you could get in a channel because understand this all the disciples were there all of them were called but Peter dropped into my channel that the father opened it up to him you forget that you are individual Revelation doesn't come as a group there's no group Revelation okay the Lord I shout I want to say it again there is no group Revelation it's our personal revelation that Christ has revealed himself to you and Jesus went on further and said Upon This Rock I will build my church therefore the devil can't really throw off the church because he cannot get what's in your heart yo what's in your heart is sealed he can't go there because only the word can discern the thoughts and in terms of that the devil cannot discern the intents of your heart or you should be shouting on that one down by the devil not to listen to see what you're speaking he don't know what's in your heart it's only when you speak he should hear what you're saying God wasn't given the Devil Revelation and discipline was getting no Revelation so when you step and talk to Eve what did God say go I don't know he's not talking to me and then Eve so I'd fit to explain and explain and explain and see she's the normal revelation because if even a revelation she never explained nothing to that devil she will not tell that so don't go on asking yourself because I get it from my husband my husband got the word and when I came forth I didn't know nothing about that tree my husband revealed that and spoke that and unfold that God said we get rid of everything but not that one so if you want to know about that tree go and get the one who revealed that content on that tree go to them that sell go and buy go and get the anointing then you're sitting on Church long enough where is the fire where is the oil where is the feet that's what the prophet came to turn around back to the Fate because the faith will pull down the power the faith will pull on the fire the faith is not just talking wood for 40 years mechanics only one day we're gonna wake up and said you don't even have to need you know the mechanics mechanics we're just waiting for time and season to get the same pay Glory oh God I don't want nothing less than what Peter had don't tell me to say what Peter had preaching behind some pulled me this is not what Peter had he had Silver and Gold Have I None such as have I give it unto you this guy that signs wonders God confirming every service sick being healed every service God coming down brother Branham had it also every service you know what I'm waiting on oh the angel of the Lord he is here Hallelujah I command every blind Spirit every miserable demon every depressant demon frustration demon take a leap pack up get out free in Jesus name and they have to pack up and go that is the gospel that's what signs and wonders and miracles speaking in tongues interpretation of tongues every kiss back in the church we want that we cancel we above the guests we want every gift we want the entire gift everything that early church have as Alpha church this is Omega Church if they had fire be wanted their power we wanted they had Miracles we wanted they had Vindication we wanted don't tell me we can't have it the Holy Ghost is just as real as they had a Pentecost it's the same Holy Ghost is that no new Holy Ghost that's the old time singing whole time shouting all time you say holy ghost oh God hallelujah hallelujah the same old holy ghosts all the old times singing the old-time religion devil don't want to go near it that's what the people fear it but it's good enough for me it's messaging a good old shaking made start here tonight may God rock your world tonight I believe in the all-time power brother the whole time shaken my God is two people here tonight I'm gonna preach tonight I'm gonna still say this tonight because I believe the power is belongs to God [Music] power to do signs and wonders and miracles Glory what was the word in Acts 1 8 you shall receive power when when when when when when not after Luther not after Wesley after the Holy Ghost itself and the prophet brought back the Holy Ghost he brought back the entire world so he brought back the entire Holy Ghost and that entire Holy Ghost is to come upon the church and you receive power to produce another Ephesians power for a second Revival power for the manifestation of the sons of God power do not talk manifestation of the sons of God not talk oh give the Lord a shout in the house we're not talking about talk we're talking about action of faith that produce a manifestation of our life [Applause] [Music] Glory Hallelujah glory to God [Applause] you'll be seated when when man fell and Adam you heard it preach over and over when when God lost the whole of Adam lose the whole of the Earth as long as God was in control of Adam Adam could control the Earth it's an automatic flow of the current the corn was flown from God to Adam and Adam to the earth once that line was broken Adam couldn't this dictate to no lion he couldn't speak to no elephant because all these animals the name was he wasn't born with him he was supposed to call them too just as God called Adam he's a lion come and sit down here oh what's the lion keep on walking normal normal Adam have no power when a lion there are no power of the elephant he lost the power and God had to take back the book and seal it up with Seven Seals and put seven Thunders are stamped behind there oh no man could watch on it no man can look upon it the book was sealed the inheritance was sealed the power was sealed and he promised them unseal that power unseal the book that's why we're here tonight because Seven Seas have been broken and the entire Holy Ghost has visited the church the entire Holy Ghost has visited the church to reproduce Luke's 1730 in a prophet in this hour Oh Glory to God hallelujah don't tell me that wasn't son of man that was this son of man revealing any son of man don't tell me that was indirect God said the Lord every word from that Prophet was not say the Lord a Time failed there's gonna be a pride there's going to be a bride in Trinidad there's going to be right around the world there's going to be a seven ton of Revival because I say so no because the prophet prophesied that the bride had another Revival yet it will take that what that those seven Thunders to pick that bride up again he's sleeping she's sleeping we have a promise [Music] slumber I'm gonna take off that sleep we're gonna shake off the weary you're gonna shake off the tired take that wait upon the Lord showing you their strength even young men shall faith and utterly fall but take that faith upon the Lord not dead and hang on in service no wait upon the Lord Frank will come back inside of you strength to press strength to push I'm not gonna give up Caleb was 80 plus Hallelujah he said I will if the Lord be with me I shall be able to drive them out it was the action of faith and Caleb he couldn't kill my Giants two as good as 22 it doesn't matter the numbers didn't matter this is my land God give me this month monk he brought his mind I'm coming to take it do I become a chance on that mountain I'm gonna climb on Pyramid Oh Glory Don't Tell Me Faith is too hard and brought you to hide a knowledge but I'm gonna get every one of those virtues that's my promise [Applause] I could say it differently every one of these virtues is a new one in me in seafoam getting my mountain mean that gonna unfold and manifest itself Oh Glory to God hallelujah Hallelujah The Apple Tree will take a deep breath and try to pump up apples they just keep drinking water oh glow and grow him that's all the apples you have to do just drink water and grow all these summer autumn winter spring everything passing through but he just stay in this drawing that when I was a child I speak like a child Hallelujah because a small plant you can't expect that apple tree that small plant to produce any fruit it's too small had to get mature and when you're too small you're caught what food you could produce you had to get big you have to get pacifier you have to get baby stuff but when you become a man that's different now we can produce fruit no God expect something have you [Applause] for a message expectancy but Abraham says he said no that's the way tonight many of you here may seem like your your time of Deliverance is way away but sometimes when it seems the foot is away on the darkest of our that is when you receive help from God there's an old dishonoring proverb dishonoring proverb which says God help those who have themselves that's an error God helps those who can't help themselves if you could help yourself you would need God's help but God has Mercy on those who cannot help themselves God revealed the Simeon that he will not see that until he sees the Lord's Christ it was a divine revelation to this old man emphasize all everybody expect him to drop down and dead they want him to sit at home in a rocking chair and he keep going to the temple whether he walked with a cook stick a hook stick he come at the very end of the service but he know Messiah have to come true there so he's checking every don't know when all you know death only buzzing but can't touch him because he has to see the Christ because it's a revelation he can't produce that to nobody he can spot a piece of paper signed by God and tell him that Hallelujah this thing is in my heart and a man living out something the action of faith in his heart brings me the service he can forsake the assembling because you don't know when God will come suddenly to his Temple so he can't afford a mess a Wednesday night a fire night a Sunday is there Hallelujah is coming because he knew one day the god that revealed it would confirm it to God that revealed it with indicated they're going up reveal it but manifested so you can't stop that brother because he has Revelation Revelation is not water where is this wine won't have no stimulation with it wine have that kind of thing it does make you a little dizzy it just makes you a little tipsy it is making a little happy it's making a little excited because it's the wind of Revelation you have something your neighbor don't have Oh Glory to God you're drunk but a new wine oh give the Lord a shout [Music] [Applause] because the Holy Spirit told him so and that's why there's so much a short testimonies because there's a short of Revelation because the revelation will give you a testimony oh my what was blind one time just heal a man who's blind and you see and he says say God he will say God heal you that man is a sinner which I did they put sinner on Jesus and the man here if you say a man say whether the man has sinner or not I don't know but this one thing I know I once was blind but now I see him so however all I wanted to interpret that that's all the business but don't come and tell me I don't know I just blind I have seen nothing I walk in the darkness all this time normally I big big I've seen red red yellow yellow blue blue I so happy you want to tie up my mind and bring some intellectual thing I call it intellectual gymnastics flipping something here sinner you said are you off the word I'm not kind of nonsense I am blind I was blind no I'm seeing clearly I could see through you your old hypocrite you praise all these years you couldn't pray for me and get me heal this this Nazarene come around This Man Called Jesus who only gonna fight with he come and lay hands upon me and no one made whole praise God you bunch of Rascals praise God God heal me I am free I'm free to dance I'm free to shout free to praise God hallelujah don't tell me don't tell me about that don't go bring anything negative when the manifestation is the interpretation you talk about the power coming oh my God it will be shaken it will be rocking the ministers will have to stay they will stop stop explaining it they're going to double he falls he falls and people get healed blinds I open them speaking deaf hearing and he falls he falls he falls that they're stopping the people from being healed oh Gloria God will be coming they will be coming they're coming they're coming they're coming they're sick come in Hallelujah the blind coming the death's coming the people coming there'll be one more ride oh hell your ride is still once more there'll be one more ride the Holy Spirit the white horse rider he goes to mount a bride Oh Glory to God there'll be one more ride there will be Divine Healing there will be the power of God being made manifest among God's people God will speak once more the world will hear backwards from God since the prophet never once more the world was here direct from God he will speak and the word will be confirmed he prophesied sons of God will speak and the world will be backed up just like that the word will materialize through my dissolve materialize cancer be gone materialize diabetes disappear materialize Oh Glory the God hallelujah high blood pressure normal lies every devil is being challenged Jesus challenged every man of sickness every man of disease and put a problem did the same thing no sickness no disease nothing could stand in the way of that prophet and there's gonna be a pride he prophesied going to be a super church he didn't prophesy that the Holy Spirit told him pick up your pen and write that put that down in the last days the Bible come to The Headstone will be a super Church a super race I see there's The Headstone then the Bible be so much like him they will be in his very image so the image of God will be back on the earth restored first created image [Applause] [Music] these are Adams before we go back to Eden oh Hallelujah Satan seeing Adam again but not a fallen one Adam again before we go back to Eden Adam again and Satan's Eden Adam again conquer him Oh Glory Adam again being backed up let us make man and have dominion and program came to reveal what that man consists of and once that man is restored the connection the plugin the plumbing reconnect back all the buyers connect back and there's a main switch that we written on there's a break and God flip that switch and the power because of the current Runway all the all the lines run right he could flick the switch and then the current falling through yeah is my spirit flowing freely okay the Lord some praising [Applause] so no fight for electricians the Holy Spirit the word doing some wiring on your life because when we fell all the wiring and plumbing went off key so we couldn't have that channel of the flow of God and all this gospel to clean and justify and sanctify is to make a preparation that you could become a Channel of God that the spirit could flow through and when God gets a channel brother he could do so much them Devils can't move until they find somebody to move a thief and spirit Upon A man making my teeth murdering Spirit component man or I'm called adulterous spirit it's spiritual come upon people and make them act and do a certain thing but when the spirit of the Lord comes upon my heart I will dance like David danced I would tame men like something take out a gate and lift it up and put it away where is the spirit of God was upon Samson the spirit of God was upon Gideon the spirit upon just die upon Samson upon Noah upon Moses upon Joshua it was the spirit of God look Solomon asked God for wisdom hope to govern the people and God tells Solomon because you didn't answer wealth he didn't ask for this and that and that I will give you money I will give you wealth because you ask for wisdom and Solomon was a wise man that's why he built that Temple but these guys were endured with the power of God and they were reflecting different things because God is the god of History god of poetry God of Psalms God of songs god of wisdom isn't that right God of order God of armies God of War he is God all over Hallelujah glory to God Amen when they take David family if David fighting this battle for the Lord and David come back to Ziggler how big it was all the wives gone all the people going and whatnot

shout tonight I feel power in the church tonight I feel power among you here tonight this is power here tonight all glory to God hallelujah [Applause] so he was talking about expectancy and usually a person get what you expect many people come to the meetings they go to church and say why are you see nothing I didn't expect to see nothing in the first place that's the reason you didn't see nothing I didn't get help I didn't expect to you usually get what you expect together if you come to service you're expecting this to find something to criticize Satan will show let you see it he will show you something that you can go away and criticize that meeting and if you come expect him to get help from God God will meet your expectancy because you come in you're coming to see the church and again fight with this one and that one you come in with your expectation You're Expecting water you're looking for help my help comes from the Lord David said I look under the hills and then come my
