[12:57] you and welcome
[13:00] tonight if you have your Bibles I like
[13:02] you to turn to Philippians chapter
[13:05] 4 and the title of what I want to share
[13:08] with you tonight
[13:10] pran is continue to make your Wars known
[13:15] to God and you will see where I get it
[13:19] from and this is Paul Philippians
[13:21] reading from verse 6 and it says here be
[13:25] careful for nothing but in everything
[13:29] by
[13:30] prayer and
[13:33] supplication with
[13:36] Thanksgiving let your request be made
[13:39] known unto God so we could have title it
[13:43] let your request be made known unto God
[13:45] verse S and the peace of God which
[13:48] passed all understanding shall keep your
[13:52] hearts and Minds to Christ
[13:55] Jesus finally my brethren whatsoever
[13:59] things are
[14:00] true whatsoever things are honest
[14:04] whatsoever things are just whatsoever
[14:07] things are pure whatsoever things are
[14:10] lovely whatsoever things are of good
[14:13] report if there be any virtue if there
[14:16] be any praise think on these
[14:20] things those things Paul speaks which
[14:23] you have both
[14:24] learned and received and heard
[14:29] and seeing in me
[14:32] do and the God of Peace shall be with
[14:35] you and our emphasis tonight is this
[14:39] word called peace and I want to bring
[14:44] this same scripture and he Amplified for
[14:46] you and it says do not
[14:48] fret or have any
[14:52] anxiety about anything and you know in a
[14:54] time like this you find people are so
[14:56] anxious and there so much anxiety it
[14:58] brings up on stress it brings on
[15:00] frustrations it brings on misplaced
[15:04] expectation and there's a answer for
[15:08] this in the scriptures do not fret or
[15:12] have
[15:13] anxiety about anything but in every
[15:18] circumstance and in everything by prayer
[15:21] and petition which is definite request
[15:24] with
[15:25] Thanksgiving continue to make your once
[15:29] known to God and that's I get the title
[15:32] from and the God of Peace shall be
[15:35] yours that tranquil state of a
[15:39] soul assured of its salvation through
[15:43] Christ and so fearing nothing from God
[15:47] and being content with its Earthly lot
[15:50] of whatsoever sort it is that peace here
[15:54] we go which transcends all understanding
[15:59] shall
[16:00] Garrison and mount God over your hearts
[16:05] and Minds in Christ
[16:08] Jesus for the rest Brethren whatever is
[16:13] true whatever is worthy of reverence and
[16:16] is Honorable and seemly whatever is just
[16:20] whatever is pure whatever is lovely and
[16:23] lovable whatever is kind and Winsome and
[16:27] gracious if there be any virtue and
[16:30] Excellence if there is
[16:32] any worthy of Praise think on and weigh
[16:40] and take account of these things fix
[16:43] your minds on them so this is the
[16:45] Amplified I'm reading last verse of it
[16:47] is this practice what you have learned
[16:50] and received and heard and seen in me
[16:54] and model your way of living on it and
[16:57] the God of Peace
[16:59] of
[17:00] untroubled undisturbed
[17:03] wellbeing will be with you I like how
[17:06] Paul described God here the God of
[17:11] Peace So we want to continue to another
[17:13] scripture Isaiah
[17:16] 28 verse 3 and
[17:20] 4 thou will keep him in perfect
[17:25] peace whose mind is still on
[17:30] thee because he trusted in thee trust
[17:34] the in the Lord forever for in the Lord
[17:37] Jehovah is Everlasting strength and that
[17:41] same scripture the Amplified
[17:44] reads you will guard
[17:47] him and keep him in perfect and constant
[17:53] peace whose
[17:55] mind both its inclination and its
[17:59] character is stayed on you because he
[18:04] commits himself to
[18:06] you leans on you and hopes confidently
[18:11] in you so trust in the Lord permit
[18:15] yourself to him lean on him hope
[18:20] confidently in him
[18:22] forever for the love for the Lord God is
[18:26] Everlasting Rock The Rock of Ages so
[18:29] friends these are some interesting
[18:32] scriptures powerful scriptures and by it
[18:36] you recognize peace this peace from God
[18:42] is part and parcel of this Redemptive
[18:46] rights that we have access
[18:48] to and I want to share something with
[18:51] you struck me this application of the
[18:56] mind is deliberate
[18:59] it's a choice now I'm talking about your
[19:02] mind Sunday we talk about the mind of
[19:04] Christ but we speaking about your mind
[19:07] it's a choice because the Battleground
[19:11] is the human mind Prophet said there is
[19:14] where decisions are made and there is
[19:17] where you see the fruit of your decision
[19:19] and
[19:20] actions the actual fruit and
[19:24] because you are the captain of your ship
[19:27] you are to blame
[19:30] you have to accept
[19:33] responsibility and take
[19:35] action not just looking on and life is
[19:39] just passing
[19:40] by blaming others is a cheap load down
[19:45] excuse It's a reflection of your
[19:49] immaturity refusing to accept
[19:52] responsibility or blame for your
[19:56] actions and your attitudes
[19:59] brother sister
[20:00] tonight who is
[20:03] responsible for your thoughts actions
[20:07] and
[20:08] attitude who is
[20:11] responsible for what you told your
[20:14] children or what you
[20:16] seeded into your
[20:19] children you know I ask that I don't
[20:23] want to stick to
[20:24] this 2 Corinthians 10 3:5
[20:28] Paul speaks for though we walk in the
[20:31] flesh we do not war after the
[20:35] flesh for the weapons of our Warfare are
[20:38] not
[20:39] carnal But Mighty true God to the
[20:43] pulling down of strong now people fight
[20:46] aunt and uncle and family and father and
[20:49] mother and sister and brother and pastor
[20:51] and Deacon and Elder and and all kind of
[20:53] drama and they blame accus point fingers
[20:58] but but brother Bram taught us that we
[21:00] are our greatest enemy he taught us and
[21:05] in a way that we will deal with
[21:08] ourselves now it easy to point fingers
[21:10] at others talk about others say like how
[21:13] H men say I express what men saying but
[21:17] when it come out to you that's a
[21:19] different ball game so when Paul speak
[21:22] our weapons of warfare are not carnal
[21:24] But Mighty true God look what he says
[21:26] there pulling on strongholds casting
[21:29] down
[21:30] imaginations you can't cast down
[21:32] imagination in somebody else that is
[21:35] your mind that is your thoughts casting
[21:39] down imagination and every High thing
[21:43] that exalted itself against the
[21:45] knowledge of God and bringing into
[21:48] captivity every thought to The Obedience
[21:51] of Christ so Paul here is talking about
[21:56] actively casting down imagination
[21:59] actively casting down the thoughts that
[22:01] Satan brings to your mind thoughts of
[22:04] doubt and questions because I'll tell
[22:06] you this every thought that come to your
[22:07] mind is not your thoughts some is your
[22:10] thoughts but some the devil could inject
[22:12] thoughts and that's what the prophet
[22:13] said the bird could land in your head
[22:15] but if you encourage that bird long
[22:17] enough and then the bird start have a
[22:19] family and build a nest and then you
[22:21] have a whole bird zoo on your head
[22:26] because you by choice
[22:29] allow that bird to be sitting on your
[22:31] head without sh it away and Blasting it
[22:34] away and throwing it away so the
[22:38] Philippians back to it again do not
[22:41] fret or have any anxiety about anything
[22:46] let me repeat that you who threaten
[22:50] complaining uh uh we just call it yeah
[22:54] yeah everything is a yeah yeah yeah yeah
[22:56] you're going over and over the same
[22:58] story do not fret or have anxiety about
[23:01] anything but in every circumstance and
[23:03] everything by prayer prayer alone no and
[23:07] petition which is definite request
[23:10] petition alone no how God wants this
[23:13] petition with
[23:15] Thanksgiving continue to make your
[23:19] wants known to God now this Thanksgiving
[23:23] we talking
[23:25] about is very important because brother
[23:29] he taught us that when Rebecca was
[23:30] walking the
[23:32] canel and she felt led to do that and
[23:37] he's talking about how it's the type of
[23:39] the church today watering and blessing
[23:42] the same Holy Spirit that's going to
[23:44] lift it up the church here we go that is
[23:48] praising and blessing and watering with
[23:50] Thanksgiving to the Holy Ghost who
[23:52] brought the word to you so in reverence
[23:55] in respect in glory into God for the the
[23:58] word that come to you by the Holy Ghost
[24:02] you give God praise and worship now if
[24:04] you're in a nasty State nasty mood bad M
[24:07] God have no praise to get from that if
[24:09] you're cursing and you're saying the
[24:11] wrong thing and car with a bunch of
[24:12] foolishness God cannot get praise and
[24:15] worship from that so therefore it has to
[24:18] be a heart condition that genuinely
[24:21] comes to this atmosphere of praise and
[24:24] thanksgiving when you begin to realize
[24:27] the the goodness of God the sovereignity
[24:30] of God the grace of God that allow you
[24:33] to see what you see and hear what you
[24:35] hear and know what you know in this hour
[24:37] then you are thankful you see yourself
[24:39] blessed and privileged you're not trying
[24:41] to be complaining and fretful and
[24:44] questioning no you're praising and
[24:47] blessing God he said it this way
[24:49] praising and blessing God watering with
[24:51] Thanksgiving the Holy Ghost was brought
[24:54] the word to you right if it can settl in
[24:58] your heart you in the wheelchair you in
[25:03] the cuts you with heart trouble cancer
[25:07] you in radio land in hospitals wherever
[25:10] you may be here we go if you can receive
[25:13] God's word in your heart and water it
[25:16] with praises and Thanksgiving watch so
[25:19] in other words instead of you fussing
[25:21] with Believers and Brethren and you
[25:23] upset and you hurt and this hurt inside
[25:27] your bones now your your whole burs
[25:28] hurting you your whole Spirit hurting
[25:30] you and you have issues in your mind and
[25:33] that those issues affect you so much
[25:36] that you don't even see your real
[25:38] condition you don't see your
[25:40] wretchedness you don't see your your
[25:43] miserable State you don't see that
[25:45] you're not praising thanking God and
[25:47] it's almost as if God Wast his time
[25:48] calling you but I don't think so I think
[25:51] you must have missed something that you
[25:53] need to go back and look again and see
[25:56] what you missed back there why you are
[25:58] troubled why you are fretful why you are
[26:01] complaining because complaining weakens
[26:04] your faith and the currency of God
[26:06] tonight is not tears is not fears the
[26:09] currency of God is Faith so he's saying
[26:12] if you can receive God's word in your
[26:14] heart here we go and water it with
[26:16] praises and thanks to God for giving it
[26:20] to you it will grow into a tree of
[26:22] whatever seed represents healing
[26:26] salvation whatever it is for that tree
[26:28] with Blossom but you have got to drink
[26:31] no nobody can force you to drink we are
[26:33] bringing water tonight we bringing the
[26:35] wood tonight but you have got to drink
[26:37] then you've got to water it feed it let
[26:41] it go and the more you trust in God
[26:44] watch that word trust if you're in a
[26:46] wheelchair and in the hospital and you
[26:49] are so paralyzed you can't even move but
[26:50] one finger just keep moving that one
[26:53] finger to the glory of God look at what
[26:56] the prophet saying here if you are
[26:58] paralyze and all you could move is one
[27:01] finger say thank you Lord hallelujah
[27:04] Glory one finger moving just keep moving
[27:06] that one finger to the glory of God
[27:08] tomorrow you'll move your hand the next
[27:10] day you'll move your arm and you'll be
[27:12] moving on pretty soon you'll be watering
[27:14] it pushing out growing getting bigger
[27:17] and bigger take God's word it's a seed
[27:20] it's a seed now God gave abam a promise
[27:24] and Abraham listen to some details now
[27:27] we AB and believe God but let's look at
[27:30] some details of this and Abraham let
[27:34] that seed get into his heart the promise
[27:38] and kept watering it with praises and
[27:41] Thanksgiving so now with this
[27:44] understanding you could understand why
[27:45] the scripture wrote it that way he
[27:47] staggered not at the promise of God
[27:49] through unbelief but was strong in faith
[27:52] giving glory to God are you like that
[27:56] because when you're weak there's no
[27:58] praises to God there is no Thanksgiving
[28:01] and no praises and Thanksgiving coming
[28:02] out your mouth is an expression of your
[28:06] lack of fortitude your lack lack of
[28:08] robustness your lack of strength your
[28:11] lack as a mature Christian trials are
[28:15] normal for Christians testings are
[28:17] normal for Christians uh complaining and
[28:20] baby stuff is part of the journey but
[28:23] that is for the baby's part when I was a
[28:25] child speak like a child understood like
[28:27] a child but but as you grow you have to
[28:29] be able to demonstrate and show your
[28:32] growth and your maturity and your
[28:35] strength in God so here we go again
[28:38] Abraham let that seed get into his heart
[28:40] the promise and kept watering it with
[28:42] praises and thanksgiv to God for the
[28:46] child and waited 25 years but the tree
[28:50] came forth just the same because he
[28:52] watered it with feet so with Abraham
[28:56] listen listen to this church it was a
[28:58] deliberating to water the promises with
[29:03] praises it was deliberate when the Bible
[29:06] says whatever is lovely whatever a good
[29:08] report what think on these things are
[29:12] you thinking on these
[29:14] things it it guides us to
[29:18] actually
[29:20] determine how we choose to think and
[29:23] what we are to think on so we want to
[29:26] look at Isaiah
[29:30] 263 thou will keep him in perfect peace
[29:36] whose mind is stayed on thee because he
[29:41] trusted in thee three things here
[29:44] perfect peace mind stayed because he
[29:48] trusted in deep trust this perfect peace
[29:53] is what the prophet called
[29:55] Shalom God's peace this peace is not
[29:59] dependent
[30:01] upon the
[30:03] circumstance the conditions around you
[30:06] it could be Bleak like Daniel Lions Den
[30:09] but the king asked Daniel are you all
[30:12] right inside of there because God
[30:15] deliver you Daniel then say yes the god
[30:17] deliver me somehow Daniel was able to
[30:21] connect to the source and Daniel had
[30:23] that peace amidst hung Reliance so that
[30:28] peace is not because there is no hard
[30:31] rock music around you and there's
[30:33] nothing around them no it's internal is
[30:35] what God give whose mind is stayed on
[30:39] the that's the catch there that the
[30:44] liberate focus on God that deliberate
[30:49] fixing on the thoughts of God and you
[30:52] would find out where you could meditate
[30:55] and you hear Isaac of time say meditate
[30:57] Med is not reading meditation comes
[31:00] after read so if you don't read you have
[31:03] nothing to meditate on because you're
[31:04] not reading if you're not reading the
[31:06] word you can't meditate what you
[31:08] meditating on you have to read you have
[31:09] to hear you have to listen then you
[31:11] think on it and then as you begin to
[31:13] think on it a lot of things begin to
[31:17] unfold meditation is to focus one's mind
[31:20] for a period of time in silence
[31:23] meditation is to think deeply about
[31:25] something and if you are meditating on
[31:28] something you think about it carefully
[31:30] and deeply for a long time and you know
[31:35] Wednesday night was really something
[31:36] else it was really such anointing that
[31:39] was in the church such anointing and I
[31:42] felt something I and you hear me say in
[31:44] the beginning something is right in me
[31:47] it's like some thoughts and I'm thinking
[31:48] I'm thinking I'm thinking about the
[31:51] mouth of God I'm thinking about how
[31:53] people speaking and they're speaking
[31:55] words but they're not connected to the
[31:58] of truth it's not the spirit of Truth
[31:59] speaking these words and I don't know
[32:02] how the service was going to unfold but
[32:04] it's as if God himself wanted certain
[32:06] things to be expressed so therefore this
[32:10] meditation is very important and that's
[32:12] what God tell Joshua don't depart from
[32:15] this word but meditate on it day and
[32:18] night that you'll have good success it
[32:20] means that this word is soaking in you
[32:23] you know like when you cut up meat and
[32:25] you know you put it in season I forget
[32:28] there's a word to use where you leave it
[32:29] overnight or leave it in the fridge and
[32:31] whatnot and it's all the seasoning all
[32:34] the juice the things going inside the
[32:36] meat so when it cook it get succulent
[32:38] and so like that well that's what
[32:40] meditation does meditation make the word
[32:42] succulent it it it it it it covers you
[32:46] it it's become part of you and then it
[32:48] says because he trusts in thee and this
[32:51] trust this is the Big R I think many of
[32:55] us feel in in trust in God we we as
[32:58] human beings we try to figure out a lot
[33:01] of things we have why this happening as
[33:04] Isaac say if you reframe it not why this
[33:06] happening to me but why this happening
[33:08] for me you reframe it but really and
[33:10] truly you have to let go of you in order
[33:14] to trust God let me repeat that you have
[33:17] to let go you let go your thoughts let
[33:20] go your approach in order to trust God
[33:23] so when life seems uncertain and
[33:26] overwhelming that is where trust comes
[33:28] in when worries and fears take a hold
[33:32] upon your heart that is where you want a
[33:34] sell or pause or think on this and
[33:39] refocus your
[33:41] mind through the scripture and through
[33:44] prayer and that is how David in Psalms
[33:48] 42 verse 11 David said why thou cast
[33:52] down oh my soul David is speaking to
[33:55] himself that's why when you read the
[33:56] word and you draw from it you could use
[33:59] the same scriptures the same Psalms and
[34:01] see what's going on inside of you David
[34:03] said why are thou cast my soul why are
[34:06] thou disquieted within me hope thou in
[34:11] God for I shall yet praise him who is
[34:14] the health of my countenance and my God
[34:18] and that in the Amplified David says why
[34:20] are you cast down oh my inner self why
[34:23] should you moan over me and be
[34:26] disquieted within me
[34:28] hope in God and wait expectantly for him
[34:33] for I shall yet praise him who is the
[34:37] help of my countenance and my God so
[34:41] your
[34:42] frustration is evidence you're not
[34:44] looking to him you want this you want to
[34:47] go this way you want that and God
[34:50] doesn't answer and God doesn't bring it
[34:52] to pass and you are frustrated because
[34:54] it not working out but just if you could
[34:57] catch his mind
[34:58] you don't know whether or not God is
[35:00] protecting you from you God is
[35:02] protecting you from danger down the road
[35:05] and if you're let go and trust God and
[35:08] let Romans
[35:10] 8:28 uh cover your soul cover your mind
[35:13] and we know that all things all things
[35:16] not some things not not I get a raise a
[35:19] pay or get a new job or this no no no
[35:22] all things things that might look Bleak
[35:25] things that might look negative things
[35:27] might look rain reain reain you want son
[35:30] but the farmer want rain and you say
[35:31] Lord send the son but the farmer needs
[35:34] the rain God have to bless everyone and
[35:36] and and he promised though that all
[35:39] things will work together for good no
[35:41] life is not fair forget about it don't
[35:43] expect fearness but God is good and he
[35:47] is faithful and he will work things out
[35:49] for you so David expressed this here
[35:53] Psalms
[35:54] 62 going here tonight
[35:59] and there's that one the last thing I to
[36:02] read that Psalm that blow me out Psalm
[36:04] 131 we'll get to it but truly blow my
[36:06] blow me out David said truly my soul
[36:09] waited upon God from him cometh my
[36:12] salvation could you say you're waiting
[36:15] on the Lord he only is my rock my
[36:17] salvation he is my defense I shall not
[36:20] be Moon I skip down to verse five my
[36:23] soul wait thou only upon God for my
[36:26] expectation from him he only is my rock
[36:30] look at the conviction of David has look
[36:33] at the acknowledgement of who God is to
[36:34] him and my salvation he is my defense I
[36:37] shall not be moved in God is my
[36:39] salvation and my glory the rock of my
[36:41] strength and my refuge is in God trust
[36:44] in him at all times he people pour out
[36:49] your heart before him God is a refuge
[36:52] for us you see trust give you the
[36:55] Liberty to be free
[37:00] I sometime I mention this about brother
[37:02] Blackman would talk about in the early
[37:03] years he would have no money and he was
[37:05] stand by the bus stop and somebody was
[37:08] said come I'll pay for you just like
[37:09] that and he on there people have so much
[37:12] powerful testimony want to go service
[37:14] and couldn't get no transportation and
[37:15] pray in their heart and see
[37:17] Transportation come and they get to
[37:20] service the liberty of Faith was was was
[37:25] amazing and after a while
[37:28] when they get money or things work out
[37:30] different they stop trusting God they
[37:32] trust in their pocket now they they
[37:34] trust in their wallet they trust in the
[37:35] boss trust in the pay he trust in
[37:37] everything else but
[37:39] God but David said trust him at all
[37:44] times he people p your heart before him
[37:47] God is a refuge to us now brother Bram
[37:50] he took this text and he's preached
[37:52] Shalom and he says it means peace that's
[37:55] what I want to say to the church this
[37:56] morning God's peace
[37:58] and when there's a mixture of light and
[37:59] darkness I address the church Shalom
[38:02] peace and the world is in one of the
[38:05] most chaotic times of Darkness ever
[38:07] stood in and yet it is standing in the
[38:10] Most Blessed light to ever shine in when
[38:12] God is separate light from Darkness he
[38:15] pressing it to the other side of the
[38:16] world that the light might be made
[38:19] manifest and the reason I say shalom to
[38:21] them is because it's God's peace here we
[38:25] say here we say and I want to bring to
[38:28] you this morning for the new year not
[38:31] looking back but we are looking forward
[38:34] to the breaking of a new day until
[38:37] there's something great Lan ahead for us
[38:40] where the years has been the joy that we
[38:43] have looked forward to the pressing
[38:45] coming of the great light and now we can
[38:46] see it breaking Over the Horizon the
[38:49] horizontal realm is breaking between
[38:51] Mortal and immortality we see it
[38:53] breaking Between Heaven and Earth from a
[38:55] Earthbound sickness and travel world
[38:57] into a bright shining day of immortal
[39:00] Immortal Life an immortal body an
[39:03] immortal Earth that shall never pass
[39:05] away it is shallow unto the church it is
[39:08] light time coming for the Believers but
[39:11] gross Darkness for the people now I say
[39:14] to the church Shalom God's peace it
[39:16] means good morning God be with you god
[39:19] peace go with you good morning how do
[39:22] you do it's a breaking day Church there
[39:25] Darkness upon the people but is good
[39:27] morning to the Church of Christ is
[39:30] appearing Among Us Shalom peace Shalom
[39:35] so let's look back again as we close to
[39:37] Philippians chapter 4 be careful for
[39:39] nothing it means be anxious worry about
[39:43] nothing take your worry and Pelt it bag
[39:46] it and put it let the garbage truck pick
[39:49] it your worry be careful for nothing
[39:52] that's a order that's a word in other
[39:54] words don't be anxious don't worry and
[39:59] when you think about it I'm not to worry
[40:02] I am to trust it makes a difference be
[40:05] careful for nothing but in everything I
[40:07] prayer and supplication with
[40:10] Thanksgiving let your request remain
[40:13] known to God so Paul is encouraging the
[40:18] Believers to let go of
[40:19] anxiety and Place full confidence in God
[40:24] in God's ability to handle every
[40:27] situation in our life
[40:30] Thanksgiving and
[40:33] this Thanksgiving is so
[40:35] important because this reflects the
[40:37] level of gratitude that you have to God
[40:40] you may not have all that you want you
[40:43] may not have all that you need but
[40:45] you're grateful for what God has given
[40:47] you and we commit whatever else to
[40:52] unfold making make a habit of thanking
[40:56] God
[40:59] thanking God for his blessings and for
[41:02] his faithfulness to you let your request
[41:05] be made known unto God and then he said
[41:08] the peace of God which passeth all
[41:12] understanding the peace of God that
[41:15] bypasses all human intellectual stuff
[41:19] shall keep your heart and Minds through
[41:21] Jesus Christ and that keep your heart
[41:23] and mind to mean this peace is will be
[41:26] like a god not ad man not some pitbull
[41:29] in the yard backing backing making noise
[41:33] the peace that you have the assurance
[41:35] that you have somebody give me some
[41:38] testimony of somebody oh yes I was
[41:40] hearing a testimony oh yeah a brother
[41:43] who celebrated his 17th birthday and I
[41:45] heard a big testimony of a home invasion
[41:48] and they came to Rob or something like
[41:50] that the family and the person was just
[41:53] talking about in Jesus name in Jesus
[41:55] name in Jesus name and the people just
[41:57] get out and go they couldn't rub they
[42:00] couldn't do it because that man was
[42:02] actively pleading the blood of Jesus
[42:04] Christ and calling upon the name of the
[42:06] Lord how about a close Jesus speaks in
[42:08] St John
[42:10] 14:27 peace I leave it you my peace I
[42:15] give unto you not as the world give give
[42:19] I unto you let not you had be
[42:22] troubled neither Let It Be Afraid so
[42:26] Jesus when speaking of a peace for his
[42:29] people that is not a peace today and and
[42:32] no peace tomorrow it's an internal it is
[42:36] enduring it is connected with his
[42:39] presence this peace is not as the will
[42:43] give it some people feel they have peace
[42:45] when they get the money or when they get
[42:47] the car or the house but that is the
[42:50] world interpretation of what peace is
[42:53] like and they still have fear and
[42:54] anxiety because they need protection as
[42:57] they get security dogs and everything
[42:59] else but Jesus said neither be afraid in
[43:02] other words whatever
[43:05] unty whatever danger there
[43:08] is he will take care of it finally
[43:11] Psalms
[43:13] 4610 be still and know that I am
[43:17] God I will be exalted among the
[43:22] Heathen I will be exalted in the Earth
[43:27] that word be still that is the word stop
[43:32] fighting up in your own self stop
[43:35] worrying stop trying to control this and
[43:38] control that we have too much of
[43:41] controllers
[43:43] manipulators your hand have to be in
[43:46] like salt in
[43:47] everything and because you like salt
[43:50] especially with the family you're
[43:51] handing everything in their
[43:53] lives not giving God an opportunity to
[43:56] work
[43:58] be still and know that I am
[44:03] God God speaks I will be exalted among
[44:06] the Heen no matter how crazy it might
[44:09] look he will be exalted Among the Hidden
[44:13] and this's the final thing I have from
[44:14] Psalms 131 this one just blow me up
[44:17] there's three verses in that Psalm
[44:19] Psalms 131 there a Psalm you could you
[44:22] could read it when you have time and
[44:24] meditate on it David Speak
[44:28] Lord my heart is not Hy nor my eyes
[44:33] lofty nor do I exercise myself in great
[44:37] matters or in things too high for me
[44:40] surely I have
[44:42] behaved and quieted
[44:45] myself listen to this
[44:48] simile as a child that is weaned of his
[44:53] mother my
[44:55] soul is even as a weaned
[44:59] child that
[45:01] means that David is saying I am no
[45:04] longer
[45:06] threatful I've quieted myself you know
[45:08] when a baby fussing fussing fussing they
[45:10] want the breast they want milk and
[45:12] whatnot and then they get the
[45:16] Assurance they get more mature they get
[45:18] more rip and no more
[45:21] threaten
[45:23] we mature changing let Israel hope in
[45:28] the Lord from hence forth and forever
[45:30] more no longer
[45:33] fretful but one that is full of
[45:36] Thanksgiving I want to encourage you
[45:38] tonight as we get on in prayer continue
[45:41] to make your wants known to God by
[45:45] prayer with
[45:48] supplication with
[45:49] Thanksgiving let your requests be known
[45:53] unto the Lord I trust this tonight would
[45:56] help you
[45:57] I would encourage you to be drawn closer
[46:01] to God to surrender to his will and to
[46:05] his way because he has a plan and
[46:08] program for your life and he wants to
[46:11] reveal that to
[46:13] you
[46:16] we God allows us to drop in a channel
[46:19] that we can bring a word to you I trust
[46:21] this is a word for you in
[46:24] season that it would quench
[46:27] or quiet you from your
[46:30] anxiety from your fears from your worry
[46:33] from your
[46:34] wondering and it would open up a channel
[46:37] for you of trust and confidence in God
[46:42] and last word I could give you is he
[46:45] that
[46:46] started the good work in you is able to
[46:50] complete it at the end God bless you are
[46:53] we going to get down in prayer at this
[46:55] time
