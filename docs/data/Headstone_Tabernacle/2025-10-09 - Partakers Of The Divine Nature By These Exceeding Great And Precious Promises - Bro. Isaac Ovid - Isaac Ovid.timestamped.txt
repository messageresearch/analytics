[29:59] praise ye the Lord, for it is good to
[30:02] sing praises unto our God, for it is
[30:04] present, pleasant, and praise is comely.
[30:08] The Lord doth build up Jerusalem. He
[30:11] gather together the outcasts of Israel.
[30:15] He health the broken in heart and
[30:18] bindeth up their wounds. He tellth the
[30:21] number of the stars. He calleth them all
[30:25] by their names. Great is our Lord and of
[30:29] great power. His understanding is
[30:32] infinite. The Lord lifteth up the meat.
[30:35] He delightth not in the strength of the
[30:36] horse. He taketh not pleasure in the
[30:39] legs of a man. The Lord taketh pleasure
[30:42] in them that fear him and in those that
[30:45] hope in his mercy. Let us bow our heads
[30:49] as we pray together to the Lord.

[46:20] none like you, Father. Lord, there's
[46:22] none like you tonight, Father. We thank
[46:24] you, Lord, for the victory. We thank you
[46:27] for the trials. We thank you for the
[46:30] testings. We thank you for the ups and
[46:32] the downs. We thank you for your
[46:34] promises tonight. We thank you for your
[46:36] grace because your grace is sufficient
[46:39] to us, Lord. Father, you come to this
[46:42] service tonight. May you have the
[46:44] preeminence in this service. May you
[46:46] bless those that are here in the
[46:48] sanctuary. Bless those that are
[46:49] connected online. Father, may you have
[46:52] your perfect will as we approach your
[46:54] sacred scriptures. May you speak
[46:56] directly to us. May you open our
[46:58] understanding to the word as it goes
[47:00] forth, Father. May you break chains and
[47:02] break shackles, Father. Lord, we commit
[47:05] this service over to you tonight in the
[47:07] mighty precious name of Jesus Christ.
[47:09] And the church says,
[47:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:11] &gt;&gt; And the church says,
[47:13] &gt;&gt; amen and amen. I greet you tonight in
[47:16] the precious name of Jesus Christ. And
[47:20] if you have your Bibles, would you turn
[47:22] with me to one portion of scripture,
[47:24] reading second Peter uh one and reading
[47:28] from verse one tonight.
[47:39] Second Peter 1 verse one.
[47:44] Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of
[47:48] Jesus Christ. To them that have obtained
[47:50] like precious faith with us through the
[47:53] righteousness of God and our Savior
[47:55] Jesus Christ. Grace and peace be
[47:58] multiplied unto you through the
[48:00] knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord.
[48:03] according as his divine power hath given
[48:07] unto us all things that pertain unto
[48:11] life and godliness, through the
[48:13] knowledge of him that had called us to
[48:16] glory and virtue, whereby are given unto
[48:19] us exceeding great and precious
[48:23] promises, that by these he might be
[48:25] partakers of the divine nature, having
[48:28] escaped the corruption that is in the
[48:30] world through lust. And besides this,
[48:32] giving all diligence, add to your faith
[48:35] virtue, and to virtue knowledge, and to
[48:37] knowledge temperance, and to temperance
[48:39] patience, and to patience godliness, and
[48:42] to godliness brotherly kindness, and to
[48:44] brotherly kindness charity. For if these
[48:46] things be in you and abound, they make
[48:48] you that he shall neither be barren nor
[48:51] unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord
[48:54] Jesus Christ. But he that lackth these
[48:56] things is blind and cannot see a far off
[49:00] and had forgotten that he was purged
[49:02] from his old sins. Wherefore the rather,
[49:05] brethren, give diligence to make your
[49:07] calling and election sure. For if you do
[49:10] these things, ye shall never fall. For
[49:13] so an entrance shall be ministered unto
[49:16] you abundantly unto the everlasting
[49:19] kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus
[49:21] Christ. Wherefore I will not be
[49:24] negligent to put you always in
[49:26] remembrance of these things, though you
[49:28] know them and be established in the
[49:31] present truth. May the Lord add a
[49:33] blessing to the reading of his word. You
[49:36] may be seated in the presence of the
[49:38] Lord. And it's certainly a great
[49:39] privilege to be in the house of the Lord
[49:41] tonight and to have time and fellowship
[49:44] uh in the middle of the week when you
[49:46] have a choice of what to do, but you
[49:48] have chosen to dedicate this time to
[49:50] serve the Lord. Whether it's here in the
[49:52] sanctuary or connected at home, wherever
[49:55] you might be, we are so happy to be
[49:57] connected under the power of the Lord.
[49:59] And we're looking for God to do great
[50:00] things among us.
[50:02] &gt;&gt; For a title tonight, partakers of the
[50:04] divine nature by these exceeding great
[50:08] and precious promises.
[50:11] &gt;&gt; Partakers of the divine nature by these
[50:14] exceeding great and precious promises.
[50:17] From that scripture we read, the Bible
[50:19] says in verse four, whereby are given
[50:22] unto us as exceeding great and precious
[50:24] promises that by these so there's a
[50:27] connection between the divine nature and
[50:30] the promises of God.
[50:31] &gt;&gt; So the the promises of God, these
[50:33] exceeding great and precious promises is
[50:36] the pathway or what gives us access into
[50:39] the divine nature. Can the church say
[50:41] amen? And we are promised to have access
[50:44] to that divine nature because our nature
[50:47] is no good to begin with. Can the church
[50:49] say amen? So we are looking for God to
[50:51] do something powerful in us. Everything
[50:53] has a nature. This the the the
[50:55] environment. There's a nature in a
[50:57] school. There's a nature in a church.
[50:58] There's a nature in a home. There's a
[51:00] nature in a country. There's a nature in
[51:02] a man. Everybody has their own nature.
[51:04] When people come together, it's a mix of
[51:06] different kinds of nature. When you talk
[51:07] about the nature of something, it's the
[51:10] characteristic of the thing. Some people
[51:12] their nature is they are sad. Some
[51:13] people their nature is they are happy.
[51:15] Some people their nature is they are
[51:17] positive. When you meet them you're
[51:18] happy to meet them because they're
[51:20] positive.
[51:21] &gt;&gt; There's a statement everyone lights up a
[51:23] room. Some people light up the room when
[51:25] you walk into the room. Some people
[51:27] light up the room when they walk out the
[51:28] room
[51:30] &gt;&gt; but everybody lights up the room.
[51:31] Somebody when they walk in the room
[51:32] you're happy to see them. Some people
[51:34] when they leave the room you're happy
[51:35] they gone. And it has to do with their
[51:37] nature, their disposition, the way they
[51:40] approach life. This is why brother
[51:41] Brandon would say we ought to be the
[51:43] happiest people on the face of the earth
[51:45] because our nature is supposed to be a
[51:47] happy nature. If you are called and your
[51:50] name is on the book then depression
[51:52] should not be part of your nature.
[51:54] Frustration shouldn't be part of your
[51:56] nature. Not that there won't be
[51:57] situations come that could get you into
[52:00] a feeling or a mood because Elijah end
[52:02] up on a in a in a kind of depressed
[52:04] state but something came to him that
[52:06] told him you are more than that kind of
[52:08] church. It reminded him of his nature.
[52:11] Hallelujah. And this is why when the
[52:12] prophet would preach about spiritual
[52:14] amnesia, it's to remind us of our
[52:16] nature. Our true nature, who you really
[52:19] are. You are not the house you live in.
[52:21] You are not the family you grew up in.
[52:23] You are not the product of your
[52:24] circumstance. You are not the product of
[52:26] your school. You are not the product of
[52:28] your family line. There is an eternal
[52:30] nature called a divine nature.
[52:33] And we are supposed to have part we
[52:35] supposed to partake of that divine
[52:37] nature which is God's own nature.
[52:39] Because when Adam was formed there in
[52:41] the garden of Eden in the book of
[52:43] Genesis, he was made in the image and
[52:45] likeness of God. Two things, image and
[52:48] likeness. But man fell from that and God
[52:51] had to create a way for us to get back
[52:53] into image and likeness. Hallelujah.
[52:56] Look like him, but walk like him. Talk
[52:58] like him. Live like him. Believe like
[53:01] him. Have faith like him. image and
[53:03] likeness. The divine nature of God. And
[53:05] when the Holy Ghost comes upon your
[53:07] life, it changes your nature. It changes
[53:10] your attitude. It changes your
[53:12] expectation. It changes your hope. It
[53:14] puts you into a state of mind that all
[53:17] things are possible.
[53:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[53:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. In that same scripture he
[53:23] read, he said, "For God had given us all
[53:26] things pertaining to life and
[53:28] godliness." Hallelujah. Peter is
[53:30] exalting them. The same Peter who denied
[53:33] Christ. The same Peter who made mistakes
[53:35] could come and root the church. He say I
[53:37] would not be negligent. But I want to
[53:39] remind you of who you really are. You
[53:42] have a divine nature. You have a
[53:44] theophony. You have a destination. Your
[53:46] past does not define you. Your mistakes
[53:49] do not define you. How you fail doesn't
[53:51] define you. The divine nature speaks for
[53:54] you tonight.
[53:55] &gt;&gt; Can the church say amen?
[53:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[54:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[54:01] And that's what the devil doesn't like.
[54:04] He doesn't like your divine nature
[54:05] because he cannot get that kind of
[54:07] nature. He's not made that way.
[54:11] &gt;&gt; When you meet somebody, they say, "This
[54:12] is how I'm made up."
[54:15] &gt;&gt; This is my personality.
[54:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[54:20] &gt;&gt; Sometimes our experiences affect us in a
[54:22] certain kind of a way. So when you see a
[54:24] person at a certain age behaving in a
[54:26] certain way, they are the product of
[54:28] their history.
[54:30] &gt;&gt; Yes. Hallelujah.
[54:31] &gt;&gt; They are the product of the neighborhood
[54:32] they grew up in.
[54:34] &gt;&gt; And if we live in that state all the
[54:36] time, then we will be forever a product
[54:38] of your environment.
[54:40] &gt;&gt; Psychologists and these people trying to
[54:42] understand the difference between
[54:43] nurture and nature.
[54:46] &gt;&gt; What your DNA and your your genetic
[54:48] makeup is versus your environment.
[54:51] &gt;&gt; They say you take anybody and put them
[54:53] in the wrong environment, they manifest
[54:55] the wrong thing.
[54:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Can the church say amen? But
[54:59] your DNA, the way you made up, your your
[55:01] disposition. Hallelujah. It is a
[55:03] reflection of your home and your
[55:05] environment is both.
[55:08] &gt;&gt; Now the scripture can make sense. Where
[55:09] was thou when I laid the foundation of
[55:11] the earth? What environment were you in?
[55:13] What state were you in? What is your
[55:15] genealogy? This why the prophet could
[55:17] say, I am not the son of child and Ella
[55:19] Branham. I am not who my parents say I
[55:21] am. My bloodline goes deeper than the
[55:24] house I was born into. Hallelujah. I
[55:26] know where my roots are really buried.
[55:28] And we are here in the house of God to
[55:30] be in the environment.
[55:32] Hallelujah. For God to do something upon
[55:34] us.
[55:35] &gt;&gt; Can the church say amen?
[55:38] &gt;&gt; A change of nature, a change of
[55:41] attitude, a change of disposition, a
[55:43] change of behavior, something is going
[55:45] to come over to you to remind you.
[55:47] That's why the prophet would say the
[55:49] moment the bride gets to know who she
[55:51] is, then the rapture is going to go. The
[55:53] rapture is not waiting on Russia. The
[55:55] rapture is not waiting on the pope. The
[55:57] rapture is waiting on the bride to come
[55:59] to know who she is. Then the rapture is
[56:01] going to go. It means the bride has to
[56:03] connect to who she really is. Because
[56:05] many of us, we have lost our identity.
[56:07] Because when you see your name, when you
[56:09] see your identity, when you see who you
[56:11] are, the divine mystery of who you are,
[56:14] you can't help but worship. You could be
[56:16] in your office, but you worship. You
[56:17] could be at home, but you worship. You
[56:19] create an atmosphere because you're
[56:21] built to do that.
[56:25] Can the church say amen?
[56:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[56:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[56:32] &gt;&gt; The prophet speaks about God is
[56:34] identified by his characteristics.
[56:36] &gt;&gt; So you know who is a believer by their
[56:39] characteristics.
[56:41] &gt;&gt; You don't have to ask them if you're a
[56:42] Christian. Their behavior tells you.
[56:46] &gt;&gt; Their actions tells you. Their
[56:47] characteristics tell you. The way they
[56:49] dress tell you. what they're interested
[56:52] in tells you who they are. Where they
[56:54] spend their time tells you because if
[56:56] your nature is an artist, you'll be
[56:58] attracted to art galleries.
[57:00] &gt;&gt; You'll be attracted to see what other
[57:01] artists doing. You'll spend your time in
[57:04] the business of art. If you're a
[57:05] musician, you want to hear good music.
[57:07] You want to play good music. Anybody
[57:09] with me? If you're a singer, you like to
[57:11] hear good singing. You want to practice.
[57:13] You go to to singing practice because
[57:15] your nature, you just find yourself
[57:17] liking that kind of a thing. But if
[57:19] you're a Christian, then you want to be
[57:20] in church. You want to be in the
[57:22] presence of God. You want to find a
[57:24] scripture to speak to you because that's
[57:26] your identity. It is not work to you.
[57:29] You don't have to work up something
[57:31] because your nature thirst for
[57:33] something. This is why this is not for
[57:35] everybody. We would love for this to be
[57:37] for everybody, but it's my nature.
[57:39] That's why I'm in the house of God. I
[57:42] can't help myself. Yes, we make
[57:44] mistakes. Yes, we struggle. But my
[57:46] nature brings me back to the house of
[57:48] God. Oh, you don't hear me tonight.
[57:51] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. My nature picks me up.
[57:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:57] &gt;&gt; Something in me. That's why the prophecy
[58:00] say you are not even the believer,
[58:02] &gt;&gt; but the word in you,
[58:04] &gt;&gt; that's the believer. That's who you
[58:07] really are. That's your spiritual
[58:09] identity. It's more important than your
[58:11] job. It's more important than your
[58:13] family. It's more important than your
[58:14] troubles. It's more important that the
[58:16] trials because the suffering of this
[58:18] present time are not worthy to be
[58:20] compared with the glory which shall be
[58:22] revealed in us because our nature is
[58:24] crying for something there. There's a
[58:26] deep calling to a deep there's got to be
[58:28] a deep to respond. I cannot put a desire
[58:31] in you. But if there's a desire in you,
[58:34] there's a seed in there and that seed
[58:36] must bring forth after its kind. It's
[58:39] the nature of the seed to produce
[58:42] itself.
[58:43] [Applause]
[58:45] Hallelujah.
[58:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We are not trying to make
[58:49] you seed. Because you are seed, you
[58:51] could be reborn. Because you are seed,
[58:53] you could get the Holy Ghost. Because
[58:55] you are seed, you shall be perfected.
[58:57] Because you are seed. You are going to
[58:59] be adopted. The preaching of the word is
[59:02] not to produce seeds. It's to pour water
[59:05] upon the seeds. It's to create the
[59:07] environment among the seeds. Can the
[59:10] church say amen?
[59:12] Hallelujah.
[59:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[59:15] &gt;&gt; That's why when you invite someone to
[59:17] the house of God, it's not to make them
[59:19] a seed. You can't make anybody a seed.
[59:21] &gt;&gt; But when you invite them and the word
[59:23] goes forth, it doesn't matter what it
[59:25] is. The seed in them gets quickened.
[59:28] &gt;&gt; They could come into one service and
[59:30] something gets sparked in their soul.
[59:31] They can't explain it. They don't know
[59:33] too much about it, but they say, "What
[59:34] you're talking about, that's me.
[59:36] &gt;&gt; I know I'm not from this world. I know
[59:38] there's something greater than me. I
[59:40] can't put it into words, but I always
[59:42] knew from the moment I was born, there
[59:44] was something that was pulling me in a
[59:45] certain direction. I tried a Methodist
[59:48] church. I tried a Baptist church. I
[59:50] tried drugs. I tried this. I tried that.
[59:52] But when I heard this prophet's cry and
[59:54] the prophet scream, "That's my name." It
[59:57] was the eagle to eagle call. Can the
[1:00:00] church say amen?
[1:00:02] [Applause]
[1:00:08] to think
[1:00:09] &gt;&gt; that almighty God
[1:00:11] &gt;&gt; called us to partake of his nature.
[1:00:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:00:16] &gt;&gt; What a call that you could partake of
[1:00:18] his nature.
[1:00:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You know the God I serve as
[1:00:24] a nature.
[1:00:25] &gt;&gt; His nature is forgiveness. His nature is
[1:00:27] love. His nature is mercy. His nature is
[1:00:31] grace. His nature is to avenge the
[1:00:33] brokenhearted. His nature is to lift up
[1:00:36] the weary. His nature is to comfort them
[1:00:38] that mourn. Uh his nature is to preach
[1:00:40] to the lost. Uh his neighbor is to break
[1:00:43] the yolks and chains and the bondage.
[1:00:45] His nature is to see the sick heal.
[1:00:48] That's his nature. He can't help
[1:00:50] himself. His nature is to do that which
[1:00:52] is perfect. He is perfect. He cannot be
[1:00:55] perfected. He is already perfect. And we
[1:00:58] are being called to partake of his
[1:01:00] divine nature. It's a perfect nature.
[1:01:03] [Applause]
[1:01:05] [Music]
[1:01:06] Hallelujah.
[1:01:08] &gt;&gt; Oh, I pray this encourages you tonight.
[1:01:11] Here in the house, here in your home,
[1:01:13] where you might be, you are
[1:01:15] predestinated to reflect his nature.
[1:01:18] When Adam was there on the earth, he was
[1:01:20] a perfect reflection.
[1:01:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:01:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:25] &gt;&gt; Image
[1:01:26] &gt;&gt; and likeness.
[1:01:27] &gt;&gt; God was pleased. God said it was good.
[1:01:30] He said it looks good. He walking like
[1:01:33] me. He talking like me. He has the power
[1:01:35] to name. He has the power to speak. He
[1:01:38] has the power to do what I do.
[1:01:40] Hallelujah. Image and likeness. He was
[1:01:42] in the divine nature. Nothing was out of
[1:01:45] order. And if God had left it like that,
[1:01:47] nothing would ever ever gone wrong.
[1:01:54] &gt;&gt; But there's a deeper mystery in there
[1:01:56] because God's nature also wanted
[1:01:58] fellowship. Yes,
[1:02:01] &gt;&gt; God knew what it was like when he was L
[1:02:03] l Elohim and he was the self-existent
[1:02:06] one. He didn't like the feeling when he
[1:02:08] was alone.
[1:02:09] &gt;&gt; Can the church say amen? God doesn't
[1:02:11] like to be alone. So, we know God
[1:02:13] created the angels and and the angels
[1:02:15] worship him and he was now changed from
[1:02:18] llo Elohim to God himself, the object of
[1:02:20] worship. And that was not enough for him
[1:02:25] &gt;&gt; because the angels could only have a
[1:02:26] certain kind of worship with him. He
[1:02:28] wanted a deeper, more intimate kind of
[1:02:30] relationship. Hallelujah. Not just a
[1:02:33] worship relationship, but he wanted to
[1:02:35] touch and feel and lift up and
[1:02:39] encourage. Hallelujah. And he couldn't
[1:02:41] encourage the angels because they didn't
[1:02:43] need to be encouraged. He didn't have to
[1:02:45] lift up the angels because they never
[1:02:47] Oh, come on now. Somebody preach back to
[1:02:48] me.
[1:02:50] [Applause]
[1:02:53] Hallelujah.
[1:02:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:56] [Applause]
[1:02:57] [Music]
[1:03:01] &gt;&gt; I want us to remember church, the lamb
[1:03:03] was slain before
[1:03:06] &gt;&gt; the foundation of the world.
[1:03:08] &gt;&gt; Which means that when God put Adam in
[1:03:10] the Garden of Eden, lamb was already
[1:03:11] slain.
[1:03:14] &gt;&gt; Provision already made for redemption.
[1:03:17] &gt;&gt; Provision already made for restoration.
[1:03:19] Provision already made for healing.
[1:03:20] provision already made to pay the price.
[1:03:23] Before Adam was there, Adam didn't know
[1:03:24] the mystery of it. But before Adam was
[1:03:26] there, blood was already Oh, come on
[1:03:28] now. Somebody preach back to me.
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; The divine nature of God put a backup
[1:03:34] plan in place. Put a system in place.
[1:03:37] Put a way to catch man whenever he
[1:03:39] falls.
[1:03:41] [Applause]
[1:03:42] [Music]
[1:03:45] &gt;&gt; So the God in his wisdom,
[1:03:47] &gt;&gt; he looked at man in his perfect
[1:03:49] condition. And I want us to catch this.
[1:03:51] &gt;&gt; God could have left Adam, brother Punch,
[1:03:54] in that perfect condition,
[1:03:56] &gt;&gt; untouched. Because there was no room for
[1:03:58] the devil to move in because God spoke
[1:04:00] directly to Adam.
[1:04:01] &gt;&gt; Adam was so clear on his purpose, his
[1:04:04] mission, his mandate, his objective that
[1:04:06] the devil couldn't come near him.
[1:04:11] &gt;&gt; And God could have left it like that.
[1:04:14] Hallelujah.
[1:04:16] [Music]
[1:04:18] &gt;&gt; But God looked at him
[1:04:20] &gt;&gt; and in the whole work of creation with a
[1:04:22] clearance.
[1:04:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:04:24] &gt;&gt; Every day he said, "It is good. It is
[1:04:26] good. It is good. It is good." And when
[1:04:29] you look at man, he said, "It's not good
[1:04:32] &gt;&gt; for man to be alone." Amen.
[1:04:37] &gt;&gt; And God did what we call the divine
[1:04:39] setup.
[1:04:41] &gt;&gt; Because God put Eve there knowing full
[1:04:44] well what was about to take place.
[1:04:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:48] &gt;&gt; Listen, God is not surprised when you
[1:04:50] make a mistake.
[1:04:51] &gt;&gt; God is not surprised with what your
[1:04:53] children do. There's nothing could
[1:04:54] surprise God. God knew blood was already
[1:04:56] put there in place.
[1:05:00] Amen.
[1:05:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:05:04] &gt;&gt; But friends, if you never fall or get in
[1:05:06] trouble, you will never understand
[1:05:08] mercy.
[1:05:09] &gt;&gt; Many times we talk about God wanted to
[1:05:11] express his attributes.
[1:05:13] &gt;&gt; That's one part of it.
[1:05:15] &gt;&gt; But Adam himself could not appreciate
[1:05:18] grace.
[1:05:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. So it's one thing to speak about
[1:05:23] God wanting to be a father and wanting
[1:05:26] to be a healer and wanting to be a
[1:05:28] redeemer. And by the progress of what
[1:05:30] unfolding, he could also display these
[1:05:32] attributes. But man himself, Adam, could
[1:05:35] not tell you about grace.
[1:05:40] &gt;&gt; He couldn't share what mercy feels like.
[1:05:43] He couldn't testify of how it feels when
[1:05:45] you think you could never come back and
[1:05:47] mercy holds you and holds your hand and
[1:05:49] say, "Yes, there's a way for you to come
[1:05:51] back. Put it under the blood."
[1:05:54] &gt;&gt; Adam couldn't testify about the sea of
[1:05:56] forgetfulness. You know how much I thank
[1:05:58] God for the sea of forgetfulness? Oh,
[1:06:00] you don't hear me tonight. Oh, somebody
[1:06:02] preach back to me.
[1:06:09] [Music]
[1:06:09] [Applause]
[1:06:10] [Music]
[1:06:13] Adam in his fallen condition had more
[1:06:15] revelation than he did in his perfect
[1:06:17] condition
[1:06:21] &gt;&gt; because he could speak differently
[1:06:22] through his experiences.
[1:06:25] &gt;&gt; God allowed him through a journey that
[1:06:27] he could know what it was like to be in
[1:06:29] the Garden of Eden be told you have to
[1:06:31] step out and know that there has to be
[1:06:32] better way back or you have to get back
[1:06:34] to Eden.
[1:06:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:35] &gt;&gt; Can the church say amen?
[1:06:38] And God in his mercy put things in place
[1:06:41] including now promises
[1:06:44] &gt;&gt; that the Bible call exceeding great and
[1:06:47] precious.
[1:06:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:50] &gt;&gt; Talk about the descriptive nature of
[1:06:51] God.
[1:06:53] &gt;&gt; Exceeding great and precious.
[1:06:56] &gt;&gt; The word exceeding alone is a big word.
[1:06:59] &gt;&gt; Because to exceed already means beyond.
[1:07:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:07:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:07:06] &gt;&gt; When you really see what God is
[1:07:08] unfolding, it makes you excited of them.
[1:07:10] So God say exceeding great and precious.
[1:07:14] &gt;&gt; So you see now if the promises are not
[1:07:16] identified, if the promises are not
[1:07:19] preached, if you don't speak about the
[1:07:21] promises in your home, if you don't
[1:07:23] begin to speak against the negativity in
[1:07:25] your life by the promises.
[1:07:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:28] &gt;&gt; Can I say that again? Amen.
[1:07:30] &gt;&gt; Because many of us we talk about my
[1:07:32] arthritis and my high blood pressure and
[1:07:35] my back pain.
[1:07:37] What's the promise? That's exceeding and
[1:07:40] great
[1:07:41] &gt;&gt; and precious because by his stripes we
[1:07:43] are healed.
[1:07:45] &gt;&gt; If you don't plead the promise
[1:07:49] &gt;&gt; because the promise is a mechanism
[1:07:50] brother George to get you into the
[1:07:52] divine nature. You know
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; because we are supposed to be an
[1:07:55] expression of the divine nature. Yes
[1:07:57] sir.
[1:07:57] &gt;&gt; There are many people will never read a
[1:08:00] book but you are the book
[1:08:02] &gt;&gt; that they will read
[1:08:03] &gt;&gt; the expression of the divine nature of
[1:08:06] God. Can the church say amen?
[1:08:08] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:08:11] &gt;&gt; I trust in some way this is an
[1:08:13] encouragement to you tonight
[1:08:15] &gt;&gt; that you are reminded that there's a
[1:08:18] higher nature for you.
[1:08:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory.
[1:08:23] &gt;&gt; A thing is by nature its essential
[1:08:26] characteristics.
[1:08:29] And this is why when we speak about
[1:08:31] nature, you take a pig. I talk about you
[1:08:33] take a pig and put cologne on the pig.
[1:08:36] You put perfume on the pig. You put
[1:08:39] cream, you take it into a manicure, a
[1:08:40] pedicure, whatever kind of cure,
[1:08:43] &gt;&gt; put a bow tie on the pig.
[1:08:45] &gt;&gt; You lock the pig in the house.
[1:08:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That pig will behave if he's
[1:08:50] locked in the house for as long as you
[1:08:53] keep him locked in the house.
[1:08:56] &gt;&gt; That pig, if you keep the pig locked in
[1:08:58] church, he will never live like he
[1:09:00] outside of church because there's no
[1:09:01] room for him to get out of the church.
[1:09:04] &gt;&gt; He will come to church for years and
[1:09:06] behave like a saint, smelling like a
[1:09:07] saint, dress like a saint. Once the door
[1:09:10] is locked,
[1:09:11] &gt;&gt; you will only see sane behavior.
[1:09:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:15] &gt;&gt; Anybody with me tonight? But the day the
[1:09:17] deacon forget to lock the door.
[1:09:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:23] &gt;&gt; The day the pig see the door crack open
[1:09:26] by a
[1:09:28] &gt;&gt; that pig heading straight out. And it
[1:09:32] don't matter how long the perfume was
[1:09:33] applied, how long he was dressed in the
[1:09:36] suit and tie, how long once the door get
[1:09:39] open, he heading straight for the mud
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; and doing a backflip, doing the doggy
[1:09:44] paddle, doing everything he could do
[1:09:46] because it's his nature.
[1:09:51] &gt;&gt; This is why the prophet would say
[1:09:53] falling in the mud is not the problem.
[1:09:55] You know,
[1:09:56] &gt;&gt; cuz you see when the lamb fall into the
[1:09:58] mud, it bleachs, it cries. Yes sir.
[1:10:00] &gt;&gt; But when the pig fall, he wallow.
[1:10:06] &gt;&gt; The problem with it, George has done
[1:10:08] murder him.
[1:10:09] &gt;&gt; Because both will fall into the mud.
[1:10:12] &gt;&gt; We born in sin, shaped iniquity. You'll
[1:10:14] make mistakes. The problem is if you're
[1:10:17] wallowing
[1:10:18] &gt;&gt; or you're crying
[1:10:21] &gt;&gt; because the wallow or the cry is what
[1:10:24] speaks to what is your true nature.
[1:10:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:10:29] Can the church say amen?
[1:10:32] &gt;&gt; Some people the moment they get a break
[1:10:34] to go out and this is why I say when
[1:10:35] people backslide you see them backslide
[1:10:37] and they went this and they doing that
[1:10:38] and doing that it's not they change
[1:10:42] the nature was always there.
[1:10:45] &gt;&gt; People have brought their behavior into
[1:10:47] a certain level of subjection but the
[1:10:49] nature is only changed by the
[1:10:50] &gt;&gt; new birth. Amen.
[1:10:52] &gt;&gt; When the Holy Ghost come upon you and
[1:10:54] now burn out the snake
[1:10:56] &gt;&gt; and the snake gone,
[1:10:58] &gt;&gt; you say a new heart I'll give you, a new
[1:11:00] spirit I'll give you. I'll put my spirit
[1:11:02] in there.
[1:11:04] &gt;&gt; You can't find yourself in the mud
[1:11:06] wallowing. If you slip your cry, say
[1:11:09] Lord, help me. Deliver me. I don't want
[1:11:10] to be here. I don't want to be in this
[1:11:12] position. I don't belong here. I know I
[1:11:14] don't belong here.
[1:11:16] [Music]
[1:11:18] And that's why I encourage the church,
[1:11:19] encourage the young people, don't ever
[1:11:22] lose the desire to serve the Lord.
[1:11:26] &gt;&gt; And if you want to know if you're
[1:11:28] called, if there's a desire in there,
[1:11:30] God plays a desire in there. Even when
[1:11:32] you ask the question, I don't know if
[1:11:34] I'm going to make it. I don't know if
[1:11:35] I'm called. The fact that they're asking
[1:11:36] the question speaks of a desire inside
[1:11:38] of your soul for more of God that's
[1:11:40] speaking for something greater.
[1:11:43] &gt;&gt; So don't be discouraged by your
[1:11:44] mistakes. Don't be discouraged by how
[1:11:46] many times you fall. Be encouraged and
[1:11:48] get back up.
[1:11:50] &gt;&gt; There's not one character in scripture
[1:11:52] who didn't have a mistake. It didn't
[1:11:54] fall. Didn't make a mistake. And that's
[1:11:55] what the blood and redemption is for.
[1:11:57] But we are striving to perfection. We
[1:12:00] are striving for divine love. We are
[1:12:02] striving to produce a living faith, a
[1:12:05] living virtue, a living knowledge, a
[1:12:07] living temperance, a living patience, a
[1:12:09] living godliness, a living brotherly
[1:12:11] kindness.
[1:12:15] Hallelujah.
[1:12:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:21] &gt;&gt; So we come into this world with our
[1:12:23] nature. Some people their nature is
[1:12:24] impatient. Some people have too much
[1:12:26] patience.
[1:12:29] &gt;&gt; Is your nature because this is not the
[1:12:31] spirit now. This is just you.
[1:12:32] &gt;&gt; You have so much patience. Your life
[1:12:34] falling apart and then you're doing
[1:12:35] nothing. You're just patient.
[1:12:39] Because we all have excuses to align
[1:12:41] with our nature. So some people their
[1:12:42] personality some are go-getter some
[1:12:44] go-getter nothing
[1:12:47] is their nature
[1:12:49] &gt;&gt; some people is a product of their
[1:12:50] country their background whatever it
[1:12:52] might be their nature propels them to do
[1:12:54] something
[1:12:55] &gt;&gt; but God has a divine nature
[1:12:58] &gt;&gt; and that's what we want to look to
[1:13:00] that's what we want to understand that's
[1:13:02] the spirit that we want to begin to
[1:13:03] drive us
[1:13:05] &gt;&gt; because the men of God reached a point
[1:13:07] where they said nothing unless God
[1:13:09] wanted them to speak it was no longer a
[1:13:11] feeling Let I feel in it. No. What God
[1:13:13] wants you to do, you do.
[1:13:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:14] &gt;&gt; Can the church say amen?
[1:13:16] &gt;&gt; And we have a promise to be partakers
[1:13:20] of his divine nature.
[1:13:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:13:23] &gt;&gt; Moses was a partaker of the divine
[1:13:25] nature.
[1:13:26] &gt;&gt; Joshua was a partaker of the divine
[1:13:28] nature. Brother Brham was a partaker of
[1:13:31] the divine nature.
[1:13:33] &gt;&gt; God is a spirit.
[1:13:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:36] &gt;&gt; And they that worship him must worship
[1:13:37] him in spirit
[1:13:38] &gt;&gt; and in truth
[1:13:39] &gt;&gt; and in truth. Amen.
[1:13:41] &gt;&gt; Can the church say amen?
[1:13:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:44] &gt;&gt; Glory. Glory.
[1:13:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:48] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:13:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:13:51] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:13:54] &gt;&gt; Glory. Glory. Glory. Glory.
[1:13:57] Hallelujah.
[1:13:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:58] &gt;&gt; From the message oneness.
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; Brother said that's God's purpose.
[1:14:03] &gt;&gt; And his purpose as father supreme was to
[1:14:06] be one with his family, earthly family,
[1:14:09] Adam and Eve. And the only way they
[1:14:11] could be one with the family or with God
[1:14:13] was because God's nature was in them.
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:18] &gt;&gt; So that made them with God's nature in
[1:14:21] them. Then with each other and God, they
[1:14:23] become all one. Isn't that a beautiful
[1:14:25] picture?
[1:14:26] &gt;&gt; God in his family, father over all,
[1:14:29] supreme. No death, no sorrow, no
[1:14:31] heartaches, no nothing, just joy
[1:14:33] unspeakable. Never to be sick, never to
[1:14:36] have a heartache, just one with God.
[1:14:38] What a picture. Because the very nature
[1:14:41] of God was in these people.
[1:14:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:45] &gt;&gt; And therefore what they did, they
[1:14:47] followed just in line with God and God
[1:14:49] with them made them one.
[1:14:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:14:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:14:55] &gt;&gt; From the message perseverant, brother
[1:14:57] Brandham said that's the reason that it
[1:14:59] wasn't the apostles. Jesus chose them
[1:15:01] all. Practically every one of them
[1:15:03] without even enough education to sign
[1:15:05] their name. He didn't choose priests. He
[1:15:08] didn't choose theologians. He chose
[1:15:10] fishermen and herdsmen, the ignorant and
[1:15:12] unlearned, so that he would take in his
[1:15:14] hand and take nothing and make something
[1:15:17] out of it. That's his nature.
[1:15:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:23] &gt;&gt; Can the church say amen?
[1:15:25] &gt;&gt; So he doesn't take train schools and
[1:15:27] train scholars. He takes something that
[1:15:29] realizes it's nothing.
[1:15:32] &gt;&gt; He gets into it and makes something out
[1:15:34] of it.
[1:15:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Glory.
[1:15:39] &gt;&gt; In the message, he identified Christ of
[1:15:41] all ages. Just putting some quotes in
[1:15:43] here to encourage you. You see, all
[1:15:45] these things just portrayed Christ. He
[1:15:47] was a part of it. God doesn't change.
[1:15:49] His nature doesn't change. His character
[1:15:52] doesn't change. He is still the word.
[1:15:54] See, and Malachi 3:6 proves that he just
[1:15:58] changes his form for each age. Each age
[1:16:01] he has allotted part of word which has
[1:16:03] been prophesied would happen in certain
[1:16:05] days. Well, as that age comes along, God
[1:16:08] just moves in another form. See, it's
[1:16:10] God all the time. The word, the word
[1:16:13] made flesh and dwelt among us. The very
[1:16:15] nature of God. And brother Brandham
[1:16:17] said, if he healed in this way, at this
[1:16:20] time, and the same conditions are met,
[1:16:21] he'll have to do it again. If he filled
[1:16:23] with the Holy Ghost this time, in this
[1:16:25] way, he'll have to do it again. Because
[1:16:27] the nature is God is he cannot change.
[1:16:30] He's the same yesterday, today, and
[1:16:32] forever. There's no problem that could
[1:16:34] exist in 2025 that God cannot deal with.
[1:16:37] He's the same God who could heal. He's
[1:16:39] the same God who could deliver. He could
[1:16:41] fix marriages. He could fix homes. He
[1:16:44] could break the bands of wickedness. I
[1:16:46] don't care what it is tonight, he is
[1:16:48] more than able. Can the church say amen?
[1:16:52] &gt;&gt; The nature of God. Hallelujah.
[1:16:56] So many have gotten so comfortable in
[1:16:58] the message to accept things as they
[1:17:00] are. God like to shake up the routine.
[1:17:02] He loves to break to us. God is an
[1:17:04] oddball and he wants us to be oddballs.
[1:17:06] He's not an ordinary God. He's an
[1:17:08] extraordinary God. Hallelujah. Blessed
[1:17:11] be the name of the Lord.
[1:17:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:17] &gt;&gt; In the revelation of Jesus Christ.
[1:17:20] Brother Bam said, "Let me show you
[1:17:21] another reason why Satan hates this book
[1:17:23] of revelation of Jesus Christ in the
[1:17:25] church." He knows this is Satan knows.
[1:17:30] &gt;&gt; Come on,
[1:17:31] &gt;&gt; you you catch this.
[1:17:33] &gt;&gt; And this is why people say, "I believe
[1:17:36] the message. I believe in the Lord and
[1:17:37] thing." Satan knows that Jesus Christ is
[1:17:41] the same yesterday, today. So Satan had
[1:17:43] to have a certain level of faith.
[1:17:49] No, I want us to appreciate because
[1:17:50] there are people who come to church
[1:17:52] don't realize he's the same yesterday,
[1:17:53] today, and forever. And he probably
[1:17:55] saying, "Satan knows that Jesus Christ
[1:17:57] is the same yesterday and today and
[1:18:00] forever, and he changes not."
[1:18:02] &gt;&gt; But Brandham goes on, he knows that a
[1:18:04] whole lot more than do 90% of the
[1:18:07] theologians.
[1:18:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, sir.
[1:18:11] &gt;&gt; So, Satan is coming in with a clear
[1:18:13] picture that God is still a healer.
[1:18:15] Amen.
[1:18:16] &gt;&gt; He knows that that's not changing. The
[1:18:18] only power Satan has is on your mind to
[1:18:20] tell you you are going to remain sick.
[1:18:24] &gt;&gt; And that is the only weapon he has
[1:18:25] because he can't stop the healing.
[1:18:27] &gt;&gt; He can't stop the power. He knows what
[1:18:29] it was like to go against Jesus when
[1:18:31] Jesus was being tested in the
[1:18:33] wilderness. He knows that. But the B
[1:18:34] said it was like electric volts hit him.
[1:18:37] &gt;&gt; He knows what the power of God is. He
[1:18:39] knows what faith in action will produce.
[1:18:42] [Applause]
[1:18:44] anytime, any place under any condition.
[1:18:46] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:18:48] &gt;&gt; He knows that a whole lot more than do
[1:18:50] 90% of the theologian.
[1:18:53] &gt;&gt; He knows that since God, speaking about
[1:18:55] his nature, is immutable in his nature.
[1:18:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Then he is just as immutable
[1:19:02] in his ways. Thus Satan, we talking
[1:19:05] about Satan knows assuredly that the
[1:19:08] original church at Pentecost with the
[1:19:10] power of God, Mark 16 in action is the
[1:19:13] true church that Jesus claims as his
[1:19:16] own, all else is false. It has to be.
[1:19:20] &gt;&gt; So if Satan knows that that church sin
[1:19:23] Mark 16 in action is a true church, then
[1:19:26] all hell is against St. Mark 16 in
[1:19:28] action. All hell is against signs,
[1:19:31] wonders, and miracles. All hell is
[1:19:33] against these signs shall follow them
[1:19:34] that believe. All hell is against they
[1:19:37] shall lay hands on the sick and they
[1:19:38] shall recover. All hell is against as
[1:19:41] brother Brandham said one day we won't
[1:19:43] even lay hands on the sick. We will
[1:19:45] speak.
[1:19:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:48] [Applause]
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:53] &gt;&gt; In another place where the say God hates
[1:19:55] a powerless church.
[1:19:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:57] &gt;&gt; So we need bigger faith.
[1:19:59] &gt;&gt; We need more faith. We need bold faith.
[1:20:01] feet with heel on its chest. I shall be
[1:20:03] healed. My son is going to be delivered.
[1:20:06] Hallelujah. I'm going to be strong
[1:20:08] again. I shall not die but live to
[1:20:10] declare the works of the Lord. The right
[1:20:13] hand of the Lord do it valiantly. The
[1:20:15] right hand. Oh, come on now. Somebody
[1:20:16] help me tonight.
[1:20:19] [Music]
[1:20:21] &gt;&gt; Let your faith rise to realize who you
[1:20:23] are. That you shall have the divine
[1:20:25] nature of God. Those gray hair going to
[1:20:28] get back black again. You have another
[1:20:30] body waiting for you if you drop this
[1:20:32] one because this 16 element pest house
[1:20:35] is not who you are. Hallelujah.
[1:20:38] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:20:41] &gt;&gt; We are passing through.
[1:20:44] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham is waiting on us. Moses
[1:20:46] is waiting on us. Joshua is waiting on
[1:20:47] us. Elijah waiting on us
[1:20:50] &gt;&gt; for us to come to perfection to bring on
[1:20:52] the resurrection. Somebody's got to do
[1:20:54] it. Why not you?
[1:20:56] &gt;&gt; Somebody's got to do it. Why not you?
[1:20:58] Yes,
[1:20:58] &gt;&gt; it's got to happen at some point. Why
[1:21:00] not now? It's going to happen somewhere.
[1:21:02] Why not here? We have faith to believe
[1:21:04] what we see. Hallelujah. Should put our
[1:21:07] souls into action to make a church, to
[1:21:09] make a revival. We believe that promise.
[1:21:12] And by these exceeding great and
[1:21:15] precious promises, we are becoming
[1:21:17] partakers. We are partaken tonight by
[1:21:20] the promise. The promise of revival, the
[1:21:22] promise of a seventh tender revival, the
[1:21:25] promise of a manifestation of the sons
[1:21:27] of God, the promise of a restoration of
[1:21:30] a super church as we near the headstone.
[1:21:33] And I believe tonight we are nearer the
[1:21:35] headstone than last Sunday. Oh, glory to
[1:21:38] God. We are nearer the headstone than
[1:21:40] last month. We are nearer the headstone
[1:21:42] than last year.
[1:21:44] [Applause]
[1:21:46] &gt;&gt; We are stepping into our divine nature.
[1:21:51] Not about pride and about showcasing but
[1:21:54] more humble.
[1:21:58] &gt;&gt; Because Jesus nature is humble.
[1:22:01] &gt;&gt; Humility.
[1:22:03] &gt;&gt; Jesus was coming in the church normal.
[1:22:04] Normal and
[1:22:07] &gt;&gt; he slipped in there.
[1:22:09] &gt;&gt; He was in the temple as was his custom.
[1:22:11] &gt;&gt; Humble God power. But the public could
[1:22:14] imagine all of God. He pull it to Christ
[1:22:16] and Christ walking into the temple every
[1:22:18] Sunday and they don't even know who he
[1:22:20] was.
[1:22:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The very nature of God.
[1:22:24] &gt;&gt; He don't make anybody feel
[1:22:25] uncomfortable.
[1:22:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:27] &gt;&gt; The woman caught in the very act of
[1:22:28] adultery when they're about to stone
[1:22:31] her.
[1:22:32] &gt;&gt; He looked at her. He looked at the men.
[1:22:34] He say, "All right, I know what the book
[1:22:37] say,
[1:22:38] &gt;&gt; but you without sin
[1:22:41] &gt;&gt; cast the first stone." Watch the nature
[1:22:43] of God. Hallelujah.
[1:22:44] &gt;&gt; He turn away because he don't listen
[1:22:46] them fellas in the wrong you don't want
[1:22:47] to embarrass them. So you let them leave
[1:22:49] gracefully.
[1:22:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:22:52] &gt;&gt; The nature of God. Brother George don't
[1:22:54] embarrass people in
[1:23:00] &gt;&gt; he is defending the woman because her
[1:23:02] name is on the book because the only
[1:23:03] reason he's there is because her name is
[1:23:05] on the book.
[1:23:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:23:06] &gt;&gt; And he doesn't take it out on the men
[1:23:08] who after her.
[1:23:09] &gt;&gt; He turns his back and say whoever don't
[1:23:11] have sin cast the first stone. and he
[1:23:13] let them leave with their dignity.
[1:23:18] &gt;&gt; The nature of God.
[1:23:20] &gt;&gt; So when you see people embarrassing
[1:23:22] people and and that is not God
[1:23:27] &gt;&gt; God is mercy. He's a gentleman. He's a
[1:23:29] God of judgment. Don't make no mistake
[1:23:30] about it.
[1:23:31] &gt;&gt; He's a God of judgment.
[1:23:33] &gt;&gt; But he's a gentleman. He's gracefully
[1:23:34] jud he's a graceful judge.
[1:23:37] &gt;&gt; He's a way he operates. Hallelujah.
[1:23:39] &gt;&gt; Righteous indignation, righteous anger,
[1:23:42] all that is fine.
[1:23:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:23:45] &gt;&gt; The nature of God, how you handle
[1:23:46] situations.
[1:23:47] &gt;&gt; Glor
[1:23:50] &gt;&gt; to be like Jesus.
[1:23:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; I was sharing with brother sometime to
[1:23:54] say the way the prophet lived is such a
[1:23:56] rebuke to many of us today who in the
[1:23:58] message because the behavior because
[1:24:00] brother Abbrham had a display when they
[1:24:02] say he couldn't tell his enemies from
[1:24:03] his friend. That was a nature that was
[1:24:05] they didn't even know what Judas was
[1:24:07] going to do.
[1:24:08] Amen.
[1:24:10] &gt;&gt; Young people now talk about giving
[1:24:11] people side eye.
[1:24:13] &gt;&gt; Jesus gave Judas no side eye.
[1:24:17] &gt;&gt; He look at Judah's funny. He said,
[1:24:19] "Whatever you do, do quickly." They told
[1:24:21] you going to do something that he was
[1:24:22] missing. He had to pick up some surprise
[1:24:23] thing for our G. They had no idea.
[1:24:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:30] &gt;&gt; At no point in time would they have ever
[1:24:32] suspected. And this is Jesus knowing the
[1:24:35] character of the man who was with him.
[1:24:36] My
[1:24:39] &gt;&gt; with the prophet they would say he
[1:24:40] couldn't tell his enemies from his
[1:24:41] friends
[1:24:44] &gt;&gt; us or forget it.
[1:24:46] &gt;&gt; We know your enemy. We know your friend.
[1:24:47] We know who you fall out with. Who you
[1:24:49] don't talk to?
[1:24:52] &gt;&gt; What is worse? You want to get other
[1:24:54] people to join the bandwagon.
[1:24:56] &gt;&gt; Don't talk to that one then because they
[1:24:57] fall out with me.
[1:25:01] &gt;&gt; You're going beyond you to include
[1:25:02] people in your conspiracy.
[1:25:04] &gt;&gt; That's that's the nature.
[1:25:08] But God is sending the word to us to
[1:25:10] change our nature to
[1:25:12] &gt;&gt; to make us reook our ways.
[1:25:14] &gt;&gt; The Bible say consider your ways.
[1:25:20] &gt;&gt; And there's a lot for those of you who
[1:25:21] are still desiring the Holy Ghost.
[1:25:23] There's a still a lot that you could do
[1:25:24] without the Holy Ghost.
[1:25:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:27] &gt;&gt; The promise of the Holy Ghost is yours,
[1:25:29] but there's no excuse for your bad
[1:25:30] behavior.
[1:25:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. Even without the Holy Ghost
[1:25:35] &gt;&gt; because forgiveness is a choice
[1:25:39] &gt;&gt; you can still drop your odds without the
[1:25:41] Holy Ghost.
[1:25:42] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost as the very nature of God
[1:25:44] is God in you. But what is your excuse
[1:25:46] &gt;&gt; because you still have a choice?
[1:25:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:50] &gt;&gt; When you stand praying forgive
[1:25:53] &gt;&gt; that could stand independent of the Holy
[1:25:55] Ghost, you know.
[1:25:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; But the brand of money when he preach
[1:25:59] what the holy ghost is given for. He
[1:26:01] speak but the Holy Ghost give you power
[1:26:02] to pray and power to do these things but
[1:26:05] you could pray without the Holy Ghost
[1:26:06] when the Holy Ghost come and give you
[1:26:07] power to do more.
[1:26:10] &gt;&gt; Wonderful.
[1:26:11] &gt;&gt; So people relax sometimes and say well I
[1:26:14] contending and this is me and this is me
[1:26:15] and this is me.
[1:26:17] &gt;&gt; Are you looking at the word and trying
[1:26:19] to match up and to reflect the word
[1:26:20] because there's a nature. The nature is
[1:26:22] the template. The divine nature.
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:28] &gt;&gt; I trust this helps us. Amen.
[1:26:30] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:26:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:32] Glory.
[1:26:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:35] &gt;&gt; Look here. I I I I was speaking about it
[1:26:37] and I have the quote here in why it had
[1:26:39] to be shepherd. Now you take a pig and
[1:26:41] you say to this pig, I'm really the
[1:26:42] prophet. I'm going to make you a lamb
[1:26:43] and you wash him and you paint his
[1:26:45] toenails and so forth and give him food
[1:26:47] like a sheep. This is the prophet. Give
[1:26:48] him some kind of a diet. Put him out on
[1:26:51] the floor out where the sheep herd in
[1:26:52] the alpha alpha field or something. If
[1:26:54] there's a mud hole anywhere,
[1:26:58] if you make a mistake and a mud hole
[1:26:59] anywhere, that hog will go just as
[1:27:02] straight to that mud hole as he can go.
[1:27:04] Why? Because his nature is still a hog.
[1:27:07] &gt;&gt; And that's the reason the church members
[1:27:09] today indulge in the things of the
[1:27:10] world. See, it's because their nature
[1:27:12] hasn't changed.
[1:27:14] &gt;&gt; They'll eat any kind of ecclesiastical
[1:27:16] theolog theological slop, but the word
[1:27:19] of God, they can't stand it.
[1:27:23] Can we take a little more
[1:27:25] &gt;&gt; in the message broken systems? Brother
[1:27:27] said you cannot make a man see the word
[1:27:30] of God till his nature has been changed.
[1:27:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:37] &gt;&gt; So this reframes our approach to from
[1:27:40] what you see is what you get to this is
[1:27:41] who I am to I want people to know me to
[1:27:44] I already looking to change my nature.
[1:27:46] The person who I came in here tonight as
[1:27:48] and the person I'm leaving tonight as
[1:27:50] need to be I need to see some kind of
[1:27:52] change.
[1:27:54] &gt;&gt; There must be a difference.
[1:27:56] &gt;&gt; The word comes to tell us, hey, you need
[1:27:58] to fix this. You need to change this.
[1:28:00] You cannot make a man see the word of
[1:28:02] God till his nature has been changed.
[1:28:05] And when his nature is changed from what
[1:28:07] he is to a son of God and the Holy
[1:28:09] Spirit comes into him, can the church
[1:28:11] say amen?
[1:28:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:28:16] &gt;&gt; In the message, God has a provided lamb.
[1:28:19] &gt;&gt; And now, how will he be known? How will
[1:28:21] we know him by his nature? What he does,
[1:28:23] his works.
[1:28:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:26] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:28:27] &gt;&gt; I'm just putting these quotes in there
[1:28:28] because these are the promises. You
[1:28:30] know,
[1:28:31] &gt;&gt; these are the promises that by these
[1:28:33] exceeding great and precious promises,
[1:28:35] we become partakers. Because if we leave
[1:28:38] here just with some concept or we
[1:28:40] feeling good and we don't understand
[1:28:41] that there's something higher
[1:28:44] &gt;&gt; because it's very easy to paint a
[1:28:45] picture of just keep coming to church
[1:28:47] and keep doing it and it'll be all
[1:28:48] right. But you must be clear on what
[1:28:49] you're looking for.
[1:28:50] &gt;&gt; You must have an expectation. You must
[1:28:52] have a desire to know I'm measuring up
[1:28:54] to the standard of the word.
[1:28:56] &gt;&gt; Can the church say amen?
[1:29:00] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:29:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:03] &gt;&gt; Wonderful.
[1:29:06] Brother Brandham, in the message, you
[1:29:07] must be born again. He said, "What kind
[1:29:09] of nature have you got then, brother
[1:29:10] Brandham?" His nature. If I had my
[1:29:13] father's nature, then I do the things my
[1:29:15] father did.
[1:29:16] &gt;&gt; Now that I'm born again, it depends on
[1:29:18] who my father was.
[1:29:20] &gt;&gt; If you're just born in the church,
[1:29:22] you've got a church father
[1:29:24] &gt;&gt; and you can call him father if you want
[1:29:25] to. Is he prophet?
[1:29:28] &gt;&gt; You call him anything you want to
[1:29:29] because he's your father. But if your
[1:29:31] father is God, you see, but I'm making a
[1:29:33] distinction here.
[1:29:34] &gt;&gt; People are real church father. They they
[1:29:36] born in church.
[1:29:36] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:29:37] &gt;&gt; They have a concept of this thing. This
[1:29:38] is how we do things here. And he's
[1:29:40] saying your father is supposed to be
[1:29:41] God.
[1:29:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:42] &gt;&gt; But if your father is God and you're
[1:29:44] born in the family of God, you seek
[1:29:45] those things that pertain to God.
[1:29:47] &gt;&gt; That's right. Then you are God's child.
[1:29:49] Your nature is God's nature.
[1:29:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:29:54] &gt;&gt; And brother brings it back to church
[1:29:55] context. Oh, our church believes that
[1:29:57] the days of miracle is passed. How could
[1:29:59] you believe the day of miracle is passed
[1:30:00] when the very nature of God is in you?
[1:30:03] when he is alltogether miracle.
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:06] &gt;&gt; Listen to this quote from the prophet.
[1:30:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:09] &gt;&gt; And I want to because listen and and the
[1:30:12] little grace God has given for me to
[1:30:13] travel and see a few things. There are
[1:30:15] people in the message who don't believe
[1:30:16] in miracles. You know,
[1:30:21] &gt;&gt; word, word, word and no miracles in
[1:30:24] them.
[1:30:25] &gt;&gt; Listen to brother Brandham.
[1:30:27] How could you believe the days of
[1:30:29] miracle is passed when the very nature
[1:30:31] of God is in you? When he is alltogether
[1:30:33] miracle,
[1:30:34] &gt;&gt; his nature is miracle. His habits
[1:30:37] miracle, his whole being is miracle. How
[1:30:40] can you be anything else but miracle?
[1:30:42] &gt;&gt; Your new birth is miracle. Your new life
[1:30:45] is miracle. Even your nature is a
[1:30:48] miracle.
[1:30:50] &gt;&gt; That's the prophet.
[1:30:53] &gt;&gt; They want to push miracle to the
[1:30:55] Pentecostal. The Pentecostals and
[1:30:58] &gt;&gt; but there has to be miracles in the
[1:30:59] church. There must be signs and warnings
[1:31:01] in the church. There must be notes of
[1:31:03] praises of the power of Satan being
[1:31:05] broken, of the sick being healed, of
[1:31:07] deliverance to the captives, of the
[1:31:09] blind eyes popping open, of demons being
[1:31:12] cast out.
[1:31:13] &gt;&gt; Can the church say amen?
[1:31:15] &gt;&gt; That's what we see happen to put our
[1:31:18] church into action to make a church that
[1:31:20] will make a revival. There'll be
[1:31:22] miracles in the church, signs in the
[1:31:24] church, wonders in the church, not
[1:31:26] Pentecostal because the fullness of the
[1:31:28] word restores the fullness of the spirit
[1:31:31] to see real miracles of God, even the
[1:31:33] miracle of eternal life being imparted
[1:31:36] in the name of Jesus. Can the church say
[1:31:38] amen?
[1:31:40] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:31:41] [Music]
[1:31:45] &gt;&gt; So, we're not coming to church. And this
[1:31:47] is where when Gideon when the angel came
[1:31:49] to Gideon, he said, "If you if God is
[1:31:51] God, then where are all the miracles?"
[1:31:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. If this thing is real, then
[1:31:57] where are all the miracles? Hallelujah.
[1:31:59] There must be healing. There must be
[1:32:01] deliverance. There must be the power of
[1:32:03] Satan being broken. Satan must be under
[1:32:06] your feet. The Egyptians you see today,
[1:32:09] you will see them no more forever.
[1:32:12] I don't care what the bondage is,
[1:32:14] financial bondage, marital bondage,
[1:32:17] bondage in your family, whatever it
[1:32:19] might be, there has to be a miracle in
[1:32:21] your life. He's a miracle working God.
[1:32:25] [Applause]
[1:32:25] [Music]
[1:32:26] [Applause]
[1:32:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Do you know about my God,
[1:32:30] he's a miracle working God. Hallelujah.
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:36] &gt;&gt; He's not word only, the letter killer,
[1:32:39] but his spirit brings life. There must
[1:32:41] be a manifestation in your life.
[1:32:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:46] &gt;&gt; The days of miracles are now. You got to
[1:32:48] begin to claim it. I don't I can't speak
[1:32:51] for any other church, any other group.
[1:32:53] But as for me and my house, I'm in my
[1:32:55] office tonight. As for me and my house,
[1:32:57] as for this group that's part of the
[1:32:59] mandate of God for us, we will have a
[1:33:01] church with miracles. We will have a
[1:33:03] church with healing because the
[1:33:05] requirement is faith. And we can have
[1:33:07] perfect faith on a perfect message
[1:33:10] that's perfectly dovetailed with
[1:33:11] scripture. It's a vindicated message.
[1:33:16] And the promise still stands. These
[1:33:19] signs shall follow them that believe.
[1:33:24] [Applause]
[1:33:24] [Music]
[1:33:25] [Applause]
[1:33:30] &gt;&gt; You have to believe for it. Thank you,
[1:33:31] brother Anthony. You have to believe for
[1:33:33] it. I don't care where your son is
[1:33:35] tonight. Believe for it. I don't care
[1:33:37] where your daughter is tonight. Believe
[1:33:39] for it. I don't care where your brother
[1:33:40] is tonight. Believe for it. I don't care
[1:33:42] what demon is holding up tonight.
[1:33:44] Believe for it.
[1:33:45] &gt;&gt; Satan, the blood of Jesus is against
[1:33:48] you.
[1:33:49] [Applause]
[1:33:53] &gt;&gt; The divine nature of God is to do the
[1:33:55] impossible.
[1:33:57] &gt;&gt; He specializes in the impossible. If it
[1:34:00] was ordinary, we don't need him.
[1:34:04] [Applause]
[1:34:06] He specializes when the doctor can't do
[1:34:08] anything else. Oh God, help me tonight.
[1:34:12] &gt;&gt; But Brandham said God heals through
[1:34:13] music. He heals through medicines. He
[1:34:16] can heal through all these things. But
[1:34:17] when the doctor don't know what to do,
[1:34:19] &gt;&gt; that's when you need a miracle working
[1:34:21] God. I don't need a book. I don't need a
[1:34:23] tape just to have a tape and a book. I
[1:34:26] want the God of the book and the God of
[1:34:28] the tape to make himself known as a
[1:34:31] miracle working God. The rapture will be
[1:34:33] a miracle. The body change will be a
[1:34:36] miracle. Transformation of these
[1:34:38] elements will be a miracle.
[1:34:43] [Applause]
[1:34:43] [Music]
[1:34:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:34:47] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; Musician can get ready. I'm about to
[1:34:50] close out.
[1:34:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:34:53] &gt;&gt; This is our promise.
[1:34:55] &gt;&gt; These are our promises. Your family has
[1:34:58] got to be delivered.
[1:35:00] &gt;&gt; I don't care how bad it looks. I don't
[1:35:02] care what they're wearing, what they're
[1:35:04] doing tonight, where they might be
[1:35:05] tonight. There's a miracle coming your
[1:35:07] way.
[1:35:09] &gt;&gt; Claim it. His divine nature will produce
[1:35:12] it. His divine nature will bring it to
[1:35:14] pass.
[1:35:16] [Applause]
[1:35:16] [Music]
[1:35:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:35:20] &gt;&gt; Glory. Give him praise.
[1:35:23] &gt;&gt; Give him worship. Give him glory.
[1:35:28] &gt;&gt; May the Lord bless you tonight.
[1:35:30] Hallelujah.
[1:35:32] Hallelujah.
[1:35:34] Glory. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.
[1:35:36] Hallelujah. Something is moving.
[1:35:39] Something is moving. Walk in it. Claim
[1:35:42] it. Leave with it. Take it where you're
[1:35:45] going. He's a miracle working God. May
[1:35:47] the Lord bless you.
[1:35:50] [Music]
[1:35:58] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:36:02] Oh, glory. Glory. Glory. Glory. Glory.
[1:36:05] Glory. Oh,
[1:36:08] hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:36:11] Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Jesus.
[1:36:14] Thank you, Father. Oh, hallelujah.
[1:36:17] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Oh,
[1:36:22] glory. Glory, glory. I need you, Lord.
[1:36:27] I need you, Lord, right now. Oh, lift
[1:36:32] your hand and say, "Oh,
[1:36:35] I need you, Lord.
[1:36:37] I need you, Lord,
[1:36:40] right now."
[1:36:42] Oh, just have faith tonight. Oh, I lift
[1:36:46] my hands
[1:36:48] and bow my knees
[1:36:50] and worship at your throne.
[1:36:56] I need you, Lord.
[1:36:58] I need you, Lord, right now.
[1:37:03] Oh,
[1:37:06] I need you, Lord.

[1:37:23] Oh. I lift my hands. Oh, I lift my hands
[1:37:28] and bow my knees
[1:37:31] and worship at your throne.
[1:37:36] I need you, Lord. I need you, Lord,
