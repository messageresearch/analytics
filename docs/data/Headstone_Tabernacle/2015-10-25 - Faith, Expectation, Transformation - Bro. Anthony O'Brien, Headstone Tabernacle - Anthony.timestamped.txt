[32:44] praise God things can begin to take
[32:46] place amen so I have a title this
[32:48] morning three
[32:50] words Faith
[32:53] expectation transformation amen amen
[32:57] faith
[32:59] expectation transformation and my
[33:02] subject is the things which are
[33:04] unseen amen and amen do you love him
[33:07] this morning so this morning we want to
[33:10] focus on the things which are unseen
[33:12] amen because those are the things that
[33:14] really mean something isn't that right
[33:18] the things that we see around us this is
[33:20] what we call reality isn't that right we
[33:24] call this reality because our five
[33:27] senses
[33:28] are declaring this building or this
[33:32] world or these things that we interact
[33:34] with we call this reality because our
[33:37] five senses are interpreting that to us
[33:41] as reality isn't that right these pews
[33:43] we are sitting on it these four walls
[33:46] they are real amen they keep us in isn't
[33:48] that right Hallelujah we can feel the
[33:50] sun we could feel the rain we are
[33:53] affected by the environment around us
[33:56] because of the things that we see
[33:58] because of the things that we smell
[34:00] because of the things that we touch
[34:01] because of the things that we are
[34:03] experiencing through these five senses
[34:05] these five Avenues of the human body
[34:08] isn't that right but we want to dig a
[34:10] Little Deeper this morning and to dig
[34:12] down into another sense it's just as
[34:15] real as seeing it's just as real as
[34:18] touching it's just as real as smelling
[34:21] it's just as real as tasting but it's
[34:24] just another sense and this sense is
[34:26] known as faith am amen isn't that right
[34:29] and this Faith sense is another sense is
[34:32] what we use to contact the supernatural
[34:35] hallah isn't that right hallelujah
[34:37] hallelujah hallelujah isn't that right
[34:39] and the prophet describe it as as as TV
[34:41] Rays isn't that right Hallelujah they're
[34:43] TV Rays passing through this room
[34:45] there's Wi-Fi signals passing through
[34:47] this room cell phone signals passing
[34:49] through this room you can't see it you
[34:52] can't touch it but if you rest a TV down
[34:54] in front here and turn it on it'll start
[34:56] picking it up amen once you have the
[34:58] little antennas and everything set up
[34:59] just right you begin to pick up signals
[35:02] cell phones are built to pick up signals
[35:05] isn't that right laptops are built to
[35:07] pick up Wi-Fi signals and there's
[35:09] something built inside of you this
[35:11] morning to pick up a certain sound to
[35:14] pick up signals to pick up communicative
[35:18] vibrations from another place from
[35:21] another reality from another world that
[35:24] is more real than this one oh Hallelujah
[35:28] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[35:30] hallelujah oh so we're going to take our
[35:32] time this morning but what is real what
[35:36] do we call real hallelujah what do we
[35:38] say is real something that we could grab
[35:40] or hold of the Bible says through faith
[35:43] we understand that the worlds were
[35:46] framed by the word of God hallelujah in
[35:48] other words he spoke and it happened yes
[35:52] he spoke and it materialized he spoke
[35:55] and it took place amen amen amen amen it
[35:58] was actually created by the spoken word
[36:01] what you see in front of you all the
[36:03] earth and the trees and the mountains
[36:05] and the valleys and even the things that
[36:08] man has taken with the Earth and made
[36:10] technology and building material and
[36:12] cars and houses and and and and and
[36:14] computer programs all these things were
[36:17] created by a God that spoke it in the
[36:20] beginning Hallelujah that's where it all
[36:23] started when he spoke then it happened
[36:25] when he spoke then it was created
[36:28] yes so this world actually came into
[36:31] being what you see was actually born
[36:35] into existence by something you cannot
[36:39] see isn't that right so today we are not
[36:43] focus on the things that we could see
[36:45] with our natural eyes but today we want
[36:48] to focus on the things that we cannot
[36:50] see because those things are Eternal
[36:54] what you see in front of you one day
[36:55] will fade away yes your bank account
[36:58] will fade away your house will fade away
[37:01] your car will fade away the clothes
[37:04] you're wearing will fade away everything
[37:06] that can be shaken will be shaken but
[37:09] the things which cannot be shaken will
[37:12] remain and those are the things that you
[37:14] cannot see with your natural eyes what
[37:17] what we believe to be here this morning
[37:21] by Fai we have the ability to contact
[37:24] the things that we cannot see
[37:28] oh Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah
[37:31] Hallelujah Hallelujah isn't that right
[37:33] isn't that right and so many people walk
[37:36] around in the natural walk around in a
[37:39] humanistic realm hey Hal isn't that
[37:41] right oh Hal hoping someday hoping that
[37:44] they could get delivered hoping that
[37:46] they could be set free but I want you to

[48:32] God hallelujah yes yes yes yes oh
[48:35] Hallelujah Hal I know it
[48:37] is hallelujah thanes Paul said a Reon
[48:42] thank you Jesus that the sufferings of
[48:44] this present
[48:45] time and that word reckon is actually I
[48:48] think it's a accounting word I think it
[48:51] means to balance isn't that right so if
[48:54] you'll put it on the scale and take the
[48:57] present conditions the present
[49:00] sufferings of this present time and you
[49:03] put what God has in store for you on the
[49:06] other side Paul is saying it is not even
[49:10] worthy to be compared when you take what
[49:13] you're going through right now and you
[49:15] put it on the same scale with the word
[49:17] of the Living
[49:19] God the one totally outweighs the other
[49:23] what this world has does not have any
[49:25] weight it doesn't hold anything of
[49:29] interest when you drop the things of God
[49:33] on the scale it tips over it's not even
[49:37] worth putting on the scale because what
[49:40] God has in store for you what God has
[49:43] put in his word for you no man could do
[49:46] anything about it nothing in the world
[49:49] can satisfy the desire that God put in
[49:52] your heart to be a Christian to be a son
[49:56] of God that's the greatest gift the seed
[50:00] that is in your soul that is what come
[50:03] from God that is what goes back to God
[50:07] and it doesn't matter what the devil
[50:08] does he cannot stop God's purpose God's
[50:12] purpose is already inside of you and
[50:15] it's bursting it is fighting it is
[50:18] prepping its way
[50:20] out oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[50:25] [Applause]
[50:35] hallelujah hallelujah just imagine that
[50:39] and people put so much emphasis on
[50:41] material things they put so much
[50:44] emphasis you go to the bank and driving
[50:47] a little small car and you're feeling a
[50:49] how because some guy's driving a Range
[50:52] Rover and somebody driving Alexus and
[50:55] they feeling bad and they want to sell
[50:57] your car and buy a better car you a mind
[51:00] busing the bank but you're feeling a h
[51:03] because somebody have a better car than
[51:05] you and somebody have a better house
[51:06] than you and to think that all these men
[51:09] in the Bible were sojourners they were
[51:12] strangers they were raggedy hallelujah
[51:15] how they wandered and sheep skins and
[51:17] goat skins they were destitute they were
[51:19] Afflicted they were tormented seeking a
[51:23] city whose Bild and maker was God yet
[51:26] they didn't not obtain the promise God
[51:29] having provided some better thing for us
[51:32] that day without us will never be made
[51:35] perfect we have received this morning a
[51:39] message of perfection what is inside of
[51:42] you has the ability to wake up to
[51:47] dead oh you didn't get that you didn't
[51:50] get that if you got that we'd have to
[51:53] fix the church tomorrow what is inside
[51:55] of you what is moving inside your soul
[51:59] has the ability to wake up to
[52:03] Dead who can stop the voice of God when
[52:07] it speaks praise
[52:08] [Applause]
[52:12] God hallelujah hallelujah
[52:17] hallelujah that's the authority that God
[52:20] wants to place in his sons but you must
[52:22] have faith to believe his promised word
[52:25] for your life if if you don't have faith
[52:27] you can't access the promise you can't
[52:29] even begin to believe it oh H but Faith
[52:32] goes without without understanding it
[52:34] goes without seeing it's not about what

[52:38] Says in his word concerning your own
[52:43] life praise God that is what is real not
[52:47] this world not what this world has to

[1:03:18] in a room a normal ordinary room and
[1:03:22] then it just breaks up to a million
[1:03:24] pieces and he's somewhere else
[1:03:26] in another time space in another place
[1:03:29] seeing different things experiencing it
[1:03:33] amen seeing it feeling the wind on his
[1:03:35] face he talked about it many times in
[1:03:37] these visions and things and when he
[1:03:39] come back down he wasn't sure if it was
[1:03:42] the natural world or the supernatural
[1:03:44] World there was a thin line between it
[1:03:47] one moment he's here and the next moment
[1:03:50] he's in another place yeah it's just
[1:03:52] like Beyond a curtain he steps into
[1:03:54] another Realm and then steps back isn't

[1:04:00] speaks from that Vision realm speaks
[1:04:03] from that Eternal realm what is about to
[1:04:05] happen so when he speaks anything it is
[1:04:08] not coming from a time element but it's
[1:04:10] coming from an eternal Source that's why
[1:04:12] we preach a prophet's message that's why
[1:04:15] we speak the prophet's words because
[1:04:17] they are not his words they are words
[1:04:19] that were given to him by God himself
[1:04:22] called speaking lifted air to his
[1:04:24] servants

[1:04:51] down he says brother do you see what
[1:04:53] just happened there he did his hand like
[1:04:55] this and the young girl's eyes followed
[1:04:57] his hand going all the way up what
[1:04:59] happened she began to see but brandham
[1:05:01] said her guardian her mother whoever was
[1:05:04] with her was actually standing in a gap
[1:05:06] for her her faith was standing in the
[1:05:09] gap for that young girl that was
[1:05:11] standing on the platform who couldn't
[1:05:13] see who was all in a condition and what

[1:33:55] official amen he say to one go and he go
[1:33:59] say to one come and he come he was
[1:34:01] accustomed doing his thing but all of a
[1:34:04] sudden there came a
[1:34:06] situation in which he had no control
[1:34:09] isn't that right his servant was sick
[1:34:13] grievously uhhh ill and there was
[1:34:16] nothing that he could do about it here
[1:34:18] was a situation in which he couldn't
[1:34:21] give orders here was a situation in
[1:34:23] which he had no control here was a
[1:34:25] situation in which he couldn't do
[1:34:27] anything about it he couldn't dictate
[1:34:29] the situation I'm sure he went to the
[1:34:32] doctors I'm sure you went to the
[1:34:33] Physicians and there was nothing that
[1:34:35] they could do to help this man there was
[1:34:37] nothing they could do to help this
[1:34:38] servant the doctors say we have no
[1:34:40] control we don't know what to do we
[1:34:43] don't have the Cure we don't have the
[1:34:45] antidote but the Roman Centurion
[1:34:47] understood one simple thing he knew that
[1:34:50] there had to be somebody who is in
[1:34:53] control of the situation there had to be
[1:34:56] a man in Authority there had to be a man
[1:34:59] in control a man who could do something
[1:35:03] about the matter and when he heard about
[1:35:05] this Jesus of Nazareth he pick up his
[1:35:08] helmet he pick up his shield and he said
[1:35:11] I got to go talk to this man because
[1:35:13] this man spoke and it happened this man
[1:35:15] speaks and it is created this man speaks
[1:35:18] and the blind see the deaf hear the
[1:35:21] crippled walk this man is in control of
[1:35:24] something that I am no longer in control
[1:35:29] of
[1:35:30] hallelujah oh hallelujah hallelujah what
[1:35:34] a humbling thing he accustom being in
[1:35:36] charge but now he has to Humble himself
[1:35:38] again to an authority above and he
[1:35:41] understands the concept and he knows
[1:35:43] that there's a man in here who could
[1:35:45] turn on the light so he goes to Jesus Oh
[1:35:49] hallelujah hallelujah isn't that right
[1:35:52] Jesus is accompanied with a crowd
[1:35:54] everybody's around him you know he's
[1:35:55] popular and so on and here comes a Roman
[1:35:58] Centurion approaching Jesus and I just
[1:36:01] love this part because here is a Roman
[1:36:03] Centurion and I don't know maybe he was
[1:36:05] dressed in his armor and so forth maybe
[1:36:07] he had his his helmet under his arm and
[1:36:09] his shield at his side he had his sword
[1:36:11] in his sheath and he had his knife in
[1:36:13] his side pocket he's dressed in his
[1:36:15] Battalion gar he has his praise God all
[1:36:18] of his headdress and his chest plate
[1:36:20] praise God he looks Mighty he looks
[1:36:23] powerful he has his red cape flowing
[1:36:26] behind him he's a Roman Centurion oh
[1:36:29] Hallelujah and in society society would
[1:36:31] say that he is powerful but let's look
[1:36:34] at Jesus Jesus is Meek Jesus is mild
[1:36:38] Jesus is lonely the son of man with no
[1:36:41] place to rest his head oh Hallelujah
[1:36:43] humble shoes upon his feet The Humble
[1:36:46] Master Son of God with a scraggly beard
[1:36:49] walking and teaching and preaching the
[1:36:52] ways of the Lord God hallelujah isn't
[1:36:54] that right in the natural he looked
[1:36:57] normal in the natural Jesus looked like
[1:37:00] the one with no power in the natural it
[1:37:02] looked like the Centurion was the one
[1:37:04] with all the power but if you could see
[1:37:07] into the supernatural realm the
[1:37:09] Centurion doesn't have any power it is
[1:37:13] Jesus is the one with all the power he
[1:37:16] has the ability to say the one go and he
[1:37:18] go he can say the one come and he come
[1:37:20] praise God
[1:37:24] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah are you
[1:37:26] seeing the picture this morning here's a
[1:37:28] Roman Centurion he's broken he's humble
[1:37:32] look at the approach he said my servant
[1:37:34] at home is sick oh hallelujah hallelujah
[1:37:37] and Jesus responded and said I will come
[1:37:39] and heal him and the Roman Centurion
[1:37:41] said no I am not worthy that you could
[1:37:44] come under my roof oh what a statement
[1:37:47] I'm sure the Centurion had a nice home
[1:37:50] I'm sure he had a nice paycheck he had a
[1:37:52] servant for crying out loud
[1:37:53] not many people have servants but he had
[1:37:55] a good paycheck he could have
[1:37:57] entertained Jesus well but that wasn't
[1:37:59] the issue the power that was Upon Jesus
[1:38:02] the glory that was Upon Jesus was so
[1:38:05] much that the Roman Centurion said no no
[1:38:07] no I'm not worthy for you to come in my
[1:38:09] house I am not worthy for you to come in
[1:38:11] my roof because I recognize that you are
[1:38:14] a man under Authority you say the one go
[1:38:17] and he go you say to one come and he
[1:38:19] come you say to one do and he doeth it
[1:38:22] you just speak the word
[1:38:24] and I know my servant shall be
[1:38:27] [Applause]
[1:38:28] healed oh Hallelujah Hallelujah
[1:38:32] Hallelujah Hallelujah
[1:38:35] Hallelujah time was against the
[1:38:37] situation his servant needed something
[1:38:39] now and he didn't come on his own accord
[1:38:42] he came on his servants behalf such a
[1:38:45] love that Jesus said I've never seen
[1:38:48] fate like this in all of Israel and
[1:38:51] Jesus made a statement he said said
[1:38:53] people of the Kingdom will be cast into
[1:38:56] outer darkness and he said people
[1:38:58] children who may not be even part of
[1:39:00] that uh not of the Kingdom children not
[1:39:03] of the Kingdom will actually sit at the
[1:39:05] feet of men Hallelujah and great
[1:39:08] prophets and sages what does that mean

[1:48:44] with him he wasn't walking around in a
[1:48:46] natural he wasn't walking around in a

[1:48:56] things that he was doing to fight the
[1:48:58] way he fights to believe the way he
[1:49:00] believe and no other Spirit no other
[1:49:03] life can work in this Pride than the
[1:49:06] life that is in Jesus Christ and when

[1:49:54] when you start to dig a Little Deeper
[1:49:56] people look at things and say look what
[1:49:57] happened this happened there and that
[1:49:59] happened there but when you begin to dig
[1:50:00] a little deeper and just ask yourself
[1:50:02] the question why did it happen what took
[1:50:05] place what went wrong what happened here
[1:50:08] praise God amen amen then begin to dig a
[1:50:11] little deeper then you begin to realize
