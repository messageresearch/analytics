[53:45] Lord.
[53:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. And truly, we can testify how
[53:49] great is our God.
[53:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Just be have you before you
[53:54] have your seats, I'd like to take a
[53:56] verse from the Gospel according to St.
[53:58] John
[54:00] 1 and verse 14. And it reads like this.
[54:03] And the word was made flesh
[54:06] &gt;&gt; and dwelt among us.
[54:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:10] &gt;&gt; And the word was made flesh
[54:12] &gt;&gt; and dwelt among us. and we beheld his
[54:16] glory and the glory as of the only
[54:18] begotten of the father full of grace and
[54:21] truth.
[54:22] &gt;&gt; God bless you. You may be seated.
[54:26] &gt;&gt; It is my privilege and honor to just say
[54:30] a few words before the speaker come. At
[54:33] first I was wondering who would come and
[54:37] uh but now I know brother Isaac. Amen.
[54:40] Um, it's the third time I've been asked
[54:43] to just greet you. And so now I'm fully
[54:47] identified with the Headstone
[54:49] Tabernacle.
[54:52] &gt;&gt; You see, there was a time we didn't know
[54:55] each other,
[54:56] &gt;&gt; but you know, it can go way way beyond
[54:58] that. Amen.
[55:00] &gt;&gt; When Job was asked the question, "Where
[55:02] were you when I laid the foundation of
[55:04] the earth?"
[55:05] &gt;&gt; Job couldn't answer that. But you know
[55:08] all of us could answer that question
[55:10] tonight.
[55:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because we are identified with a
[55:14] prophet
[55:15] &gt;&gt; who give us the answer.
[55:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe uh one of the brothers
[55:20] said you know uh brother Norris said you
[55:22] see he said Moses said in the beginning
[55:26] God created and he said John said in the
[55:28] beginning was the word and the word he
[55:30] said but our prophet took us before the
[55:32] beginning
[55:34] &gt;&gt; when we were in the very mind of God
[55:37] &gt;&gt; so our identification is not a present
[55:41] tense identification
[55:43] I was introduced as brother Andrew for
[55:45] long but said one day I realized He was
[55:48] not the son of Charles and Elraham.
[55:51] &gt;&gt; Who was he? He was the son of God. Amen.
[55:54] He was in the mind of God. So you and I
[55:57] we are identified with God.
[56:00] &gt;&gt; In fact when John writes here in and the
[56:03] word was made flesh.
[56:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. That is really God who was the
[56:09] word was made flesh.
[56:11] &gt;&gt; God identified in himself with us.
[56:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:17] God identified.
[56:19] &gt;&gt; The definition of identified is to
[56:22] associate someone. Associate someone or
[56:26] something closely with
[56:28] &gt;&gt; amen. So it's just not an association
[56:31] but is a close link. Amen.
[56:34] &gt;&gt; In fact, it goes on to say regarding as
[56:37] having strong links with
[56:42] &gt;&gt; not just links at strong links. Amen.
[56:46] &gt;&gt; Our links with God is strong links.
[56:49] &gt;&gt; Is that genetic link?
[56:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:53] &gt;&gt; So God was willing to be identified with
[56:56] us.
[56:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. And now we ought to be willing to
[57:00] be identified with God.
[57:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. We are not just here to listening.
[57:07] Lord, you're not a spectator.
[57:10] &gt;&gt; You just didn't come to visit.
[57:12] &gt;&gt; You come to be identified with.
[57:16] And we ought not to be ashamed to be
[57:19] identified with this message.
[57:22] &gt;&gt; You ought not to be ashamed to be
[57:23] identified with brother Brad.
[57:27] &gt;&gt; You know Noah when he came he came with
[57:30] a very unscientific message
[57:34] &gt;&gt; and as Bam said it was a scientific age
[57:37] &gt;&gt; but he came with an unscientific
[57:40] message. Amen.
[57:41] &gt;&gt; And he so believed, he was so identified
[57:45] with his message
[57:46] &gt;&gt; that he preached it for 120 years.
[57:50] &gt;&gt; He didn't get he didn't question
[57:52] himself. He didn't find it was boring.
[57:54] He didn't find it again next message. He
[57:57] hold on to the same message for 120
[58:01] years.
[58:03] &gt;&gt; Saying the same thing every service.
[58:08] I am sure if we preach the same service
[58:10] twice and you know you coming at your
[58:12] time half of coming
[58:15] because we too scientific.
[58:18] &gt;&gt; I don't hear that already.
[58:20] &gt;&gt; But the word is the same. You know
[58:21] there's going to be a rapture.
[58:24] &gt;&gt; There's going to be a bride.
[58:26] &gt;&gt; There's going to be an another
[58:28] identified masterpiece.
[58:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:34] I another masterpiece is going to come
[58:36] on the making.
[58:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. It was God among us. Amen.
[58:41] &gt;&gt; There going to come a time when you
[58:43] would be so identified with God that
[58:46] people will mistake you for God.
[58:55] &gt;&gt; You see all your afraid to be identified
[58:58] with that.
[58:59] You ought to be willing to accept the I
[59:02] could give you all the quotes I go but
[59:04] I'm not I don't want to take brother
[59:06] Isaac time. Amen.
[59:08] &gt;&gt; Hear what the prophet said in identified
[59:10] masterpiece. Perhaps you could believe
[59:11] it to
[59:14] accepted identify with it then. Right.
[59:17] &gt;&gt; And there's nothing to read wrong to
[59:18] read quotes or know
[59:21] &gt;&gt; you ashamed to be identified with
[59:23] quotes.
[59:25] That's your food.
[59:29] &gt;&gt; That's spiritual food. Int. The more you
[59:32] eat it, the more you become like it. You
[59:34] begin to talk like it. You begin to walk
[59:36] like it. You begin to you become the
[59:40] word because you're feeding on it all.
[59:45] &gt;&gt; Yeah. The prophet said, just think that
[59:48] a person can be so yielded until God
[59:52] identified himself in there
[59:55] &gt;&gt; in that body. He became him and God
[59:59] became one.
[1:00:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:00:03] &gt;&gt; I want to believe that the bride, the
[1:00:06] sculptor is doing such a good job on you
[1:00:09] &gt;&gt; that one day you will look back at the
[1:00:11] masterpiece
[1:00:13] &gt;&gt; and say, "Speak.
[1:00:17] Amen.
[1:00:20] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you what the prophet our
[1:00:21] prophet said. my prophet. If that is not
[1:00:23] your prophet, he's my prophet. Right?
[1:00:27] &gt;&gt; Listen, people follow Messi and Mbappe
[1:00:31] and whoever Yamaro, Tamaro, whoever it
[1:00:34] is come and they mad over them. Why
[1:00:38] can't I be mad for this message?
[1:00:44] They call them fans as fanatics
[1:00:47] and they fanatical for if I ask some of
[1:00:50] you who is plea half all you know who is
[1:00:52] ple
[1:00:54] not so but one time he was fanatical
[1:00:57] about ple
[1:01:00] them will come and gone
[1:01:02] &gt;&gt; but there are people the brother is
[1:01:04] immortal
[1:01:07] [Applause]
[1:01:09] &gt;&gt; oh my goodness
[1:01:12] This is a bad atmosphere and make you
[1:01:13] feel preacher now.
[1:01:17] Hear what the prophet say. Nearly for
[1:01:19] 2,000 years, God has been trying to cut
[1:01:23] him a masterpiece bride
[1:01:26] &gt;&gt; called a church.
[1:01:29] &gt;&gt; So God is cutting out, God is making
[1:01:31] this masterpiece bride.
[1:01:33] &gt;&gt; And if God start on a project, his
[1:01:36] project will never fail.
[1:01:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:01:40] It will never fail. It could never be
[1:01:43] defeated.
[1:01:45] &gt;&gt; It's going to be established.
[1:01:48] &gt;&gt; As certain as when he said, "Let there
[1:01:50] be light."
[1:01:52] You see, God is not like man. When God
[1:01:55] said something, God is identified with
[1:01:58] that.
[1:02:02] &gt;&gt; So it has to happen, he will go every
[1:02:05] step of the way
[1:02:07] &gt;&gt; to make sure. If he said it, it has to
[1:02:10] happen.
[1:02:13] &gt;&gt; And that is why God choose special men
[1:02:15] called prophets, you know,
[1:02:17] &gt;&gt; because they had something in them that
[1:02:19] connect them to God.
[1:02:21] &gt;&gt; Look, God tell a man, a virgin shall
[1:02:23] conceive. That is the most unscientific,
[1:02:26] nonbiological,
[1:02:28] physiologically, and all kind of logic
[1:02:30] that can happen.
[1:02:33] &gt;&gt; But God said,
[1:02:34] &gt;&gt; "I will give you a sign, and a virgin
[1:02:37] shall conceive.
[1:02:40] That's why when the brother preached on
[1:02:42] revelation that let us be glad and
[1:02:44] rejoice for the marriage of the lamb has
[1:02:46] come and his wife has made herself
[1:02:47] ready. That has to happen.
[1:02:52] &gt;&gt; And and may I inform you if you are part
[1:02:55] of that it means that inside of you
[1:02:58] there is an identification in you that
[1:03:01] connects you to that scripture
[1:03:03] &gt;&gt; and you can run but you can't hide. You
[1:03:06] can go where you want, but he's going to
[1:03:08] bring you because you have to complete
[1:03:11] that scripture.
[1:03:15] [Music]
[1:03:16] &gt;&gt; Do you know our prophet tried to take
[1:03:18] his life twice?
[1:03:21] &gt;&gt; But he had to fulfill Revelation 10:7.
[1:03:25] So it didn't matter what kind of gun he
[1:03:28] had, what kind of poison or what kind of
[1:03:29] rope he tried or whatever he tried, what
[1:03:31] kind of high voltage he touched, nothing
[1:03:34] could take him because he had to fulfill
[1:03:36] Revelation 10:7.
[1:03:39] And you are identified with words that
[1:03:43] you alone can can fulfill.
[1:03:48] &gt;&gt; There's a close link. There's a bond, an
[1:03:50] association with you. I am associated
[1:03:54] with brother Hashem. So when brother
[1:03:56] talk about perfect love that is the
[1:03:59] embodiment of me and you.
[1:04:02] [Applause]
[1:04:04] &gt;&gt; Are you afraid to say you are perfect
[1:04:06] love?
[1:04:09] &gt;&gt; You may not reach there but you will get
[1:04:11] there.
[1:04:12] &gt;&gt; One day you will see a raging bull and
[1:04:14] you all that love would overwhelm you.
[1:04:17] &gt;&gt; It might start in your home. It might be
[1:04:19] your husband. You had to tame him.
[1:04:24] Why you want to tame regent bull? You
[1:04:26] yourself is a regent bull. I will tame
[1:04:28] you.
[1:04:31] Listen, perfect love has to become
[1:04:33] operational,
[1:04:36] &gt;&gt; functional and I am identified with that
[1:04:38] word.
[1:04:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:41] &gt;&gt; So when I get on the other side, I will
[1:04:43] not be surprised because I've been
[1:04:45] living that.
[1:04:47] &gt;&gt; You are living forgiveness. You are
[1:04:49] living humility. You are living joy.
[1:04:56] Listen, it's more than just a word. You
[1:04:58] know these things going to be a part of
[1:05:00] your life,
[1:05:02] &gt;&gt; the essence of your life.
[1:05:06] &gt;&gt; It's just genetic makeup.
[1:05:10] &gt;&gt; The Lord bless you.
[1:05:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:14] &gt;&gt; Let's be identified with this message.
[1:05:18] Uh we were downstairs fellowshipping and
[1:05:20] our brother asked our brother Thompson
[1:05:21] asked for the the little pin with the
[1:05:23] cloud. You know why? He wants to be
[1:05:26] identified with the cloud.
[1:05:30] &gt;&gt; Some people disassociate with the cloud.
[1:05:33] &gt;&gt; Listen that is our our headship is here.
[1:05:38] &gt;&gt; It's not just a picture scientific.
[1:05:40] Listen, Noah had an unscientific
[1:05:43] message, but we have a message that may
[1:05:45] be unscientific, but is scientifically
[1:05:48] proven.
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; Moses didn't have no picture of no
[1:05:54] burning bush fire, you know. But you
[1:05:56] have a picture. What Moses didn't have,
[1:05:59] you have it.
[1:06:02] &gt;&gt; Am I talking to believers tonight?
[1:06:06] We have a picture of what the Lord Jeso
[1:06:09] look like.
[1:06:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:12] &gt;&gt; God bless you all. Be be not ashamed.
[1:06:16] Brother says, as an American,
[1:06:18] I am a I am identified with their glory
[1:06:22] and their shame.
[1:06:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's not bring shame to the
[1:06:27] message, but let us bring glory and
[1:06:29] honor to the message by the life that we
[1:06:32] live, the way we conduct ourselves and
[1:06:34] our behavior that tells us we come from
[1:06:37] God and I'm going back to God because
[1:06:39] that is our identification.
[1:06:42] May God bless our
[1:06:44] glory.
[1:06:46] Hallelujah.
[1:06:48] Hallelujah. Give the Lord praise. Give
[1:06:50] the Lord praise.
[1:06:52] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.

[1:09:43] Jesus is mine.
[1:09:48] He's been my fourth man in the fire time
[1:09:53] after time.
[1:09:57] Born of his spirit,
[1:10:01] washed in his blood.
[1:10:05] And what he did for me on Calvary is
[1:10:10] more than enough.
[1:10:14] Oh, I trust in God,
[1:10:17] my Savior,
[1:10:19] the one
[1:10:21] who will never

[1:11:05] I know the author of tomorrow is ordered
[1:11:10] my steps.
[1:11:13] So this is my story.
[1:11:18] This is my song.
[1:11:22] I'm praising my risen king and savior
[1:11:26] all the day long.
[1:11:30] I trust in God
[1:11:33] my savior.
[1:11:36] He will never fail.
[1:11:43] He will never know.
[1:11:47] &gt;&gt; Oh, tonight I trust in God. Oh my.
[1:11:54] He will never fail me. No, he won't
[1:11:58] fail.
[1:12:01] He will never fail.
[1:12:06] &gt;&gt; Oh, I trust in him tonight.
[1:12:10] Oh, he is my savior.
[1:12:14] And when I cry out to him,
[1:12:18] he will answer my prayer.
[1:12:21] Yes, he does.
[1:12:24] I sought the Lord and he heard and he
[1:12:27] answered. I sought the Lord and he heard
[1:12:31] and he answered. I sought the Lord and

[1:16:16] He's worthy of the glory.
[1:16:19] My what a time in the presence of the
[1:16:21] Lord. You appreciate the worship. You
[1:16:23] appreciate the singing. You appreciate
[1:16:25] the greeting from the furong. You
[1:16:28] appreciate the service this afternoon.
[1:16:30] You appreciate the service this morning,
[1:16:32] the service last night, the service
[1:16:34] yesterday afternoon. Can we give the
[1:16:36] Lord a shout of praise?
[1:16:39] Amen.
[1:16:42] While you're standing, I'd like us to go
[1:16:45] straight to the word. It's the third
[1:16:48] service of the evening or the day as it
[1:16:50] were.
[1:16:54] But God is not finished yet. Amen.
[1:16:57] &gt;&gt; And uh brother Furong started to preach
[1:17:00] my thought tonight.
[1:17:03] &gt;&gt; So we are in the same spirit
[1:17:06] &gt;&gt; connected to the same source
[1:17:08] &gt;&gt; fighting the same devil.
[1:17:10] &gt;&gt; And I believe tonight the devil is in
[1:17:12] trouble.
[1:17:13] &gt;&gt; I believe we're going to give the devil
[1:17:14] a punch tonight.
[1:17:16] &gt;&gt; And tonight is dedicated to the young
[1:17:18] people.
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; So we are we know that we're in a new
[1:17:21] generation. We know we're in a new
[1:17:23] season. and the devil is afraid of you.
[1:17:26] And we're going to get into that tonight
[1:17:27] by the grace of God. So, uh, let's read
[1:17:30] from Romans 8, familiar scripture, and
[1:17:33] Judges 16 tonight.
[1:17:36] Romans 8 and reading from verse 28. And
[1:17:39] we know that all things work together
[1:17:41] for good
[1:17:43] &gt;&gt; to them that love God,
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; to them who are be called according to
[1:17:47] his purpose. For whom he did forno, he
[1:17:50] also did predestinate to be conformed to
[1:17:53] the image of his son, that he might be
[1:17:55] the firstborn among many brethren.
[1:17:58] Moreover, whom he did predestinate, them
[1:18:00] he also called, and whom he called them,
[1:18:02] he also justified. And whom he justified
[1:18:05] them, he also glorified. Shall we go to
[1:18:08] Judges chapter 16 and we're going to
[1:18:12] read from verse 21.
[1:18:19] But the Philistines took him and put out
[1:18:21] his eyes
[1:18:23] and brought him down to Gaza and bound
[1:18:27] him with fetterss of brass and he did
[1:18:30] grind in the prison house. I remember
[1:18:33] the Brandon was preaching on this. He
[1:18:34] said, "This is one of the most pitiful
[1:18:36] sights
[1:18:37] &gt;&gt; in the whole of this Bible."
[1:18:39] Verse 22, "How be it, the hair of his
[1:18:41] head began to grow again after he was
[1:18:44] shaven."
[1:18:47] &gt;&gt; Then the lords of the Philistines
[1:18:49] gathered them together for to offer a
[1:18:51] great sacrifice unto Deeon their God.
[1:18:53] Could you imagine
[1:18:56] that the enemy is gathered together to
[1:18:58] offer a great sacrifice?
[1:19:00] Let's read. And to rejoice. So in the
[1:19:04] camp of the enemy there's rejoicing
[1:19:06] &gt;&gt; for they said our God lowercase G had
[1:19:08] delivered Samson our enemy into our hand
[1:19:12] &gt;&gt; and when the people saw him these are
[1:19:14] the Philistines they praised their God.
[1:19:16] &gt;&gt; Could you imagine?
[1:19:18] &gt;&gt; They actually having their own service
[1:19:20] &gt;&gt; and they having a celebration.
[1:19:22] &gt;&gt; They praised their God for they said our
[1:19:24] God had delivered into our hands our
[1:19:27] enemy and the destroyer of our country
[1:19:29] which slew many of us. And it came to
[1:19:32] pass when their hearts were merry that
[1:19:34] they said, "Call for Samson that he may
[1:19:37] make us sport."
[1:19:39] &gt;&gt; And they called for Samson out of the
[1:19:41] prison house. And he made them sport. So
[1:19:44] before Samson went to the pillars,
[1:19:47] Samson had to make sport. Sometime we
[1:19:49] don't spend time understanding what they
[1:19:51] put Samson through. It's one thing to
[1:19:54] take out his eyes. It's another thing to
[1:19:55] have the anointed of God do an
[1:19:58] entertainment round for you. And that's
[1:20:00] what the enemy wants to do with our
[1:20:02] young people.
[1:20:03] &gt;&gt; Embarrass them,
[1:20:05] &gt;&gt; humiliate them, torment them, make you
[1:20:08] run around in circles, put you in the
[1:20:10] club, put you in drugs, put you out
[1:20:12] there to make sport.
[1:20:15] &gt;&gt; That he may make sport. And they called
[1:20:17] for Samson out of the of the prison
[1:20:19] house, and he made them sport, and they
[1:20:21] set him between the pillars. And Samson
[1:20:23] said unto the lad that held him by the
[1:20:25] hand, suffer me that I may feel the
[1:20:27] pillars whereupon the house standed that
[1:20:29] I may lean upon them. Even in that
[1:20:31] moment, he didn't even indicate what's
[1:20:33] about to happen. He said, "Just put me
[1:20:34] there. I just want to lean on them."
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; Now, the house was full of men and
[1:20:38] women, and all the lords of the
[1:20:39] Philistines were there. And we know
[1:20:41] these are demonic forces.
[1:20:44] &gt;&gt; But nothing is out of chance. Nothing is
[1:20:46] out of ket. They were all there. And
[1:20:48] there were upon the roof about 3,000 men
[1:20:51] and women that beheld while Samson made
[1:20:53] sport. And Samson called unto the Lord,
[1:20:56] and said, "Oh Lord God, remember me.
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; I pray thee
[1:21:01] &gt;&gt; and strengthen me. I pray thee only this
[1:21:05] once, oh God, that I may at once be at
[1:21:09] once avenge of the Philistines for my
[1:21:11] two eyes." Can we bow our heads for a
[1:21:14] short prayer? Heavenly Father, we thank
[1:21:15] you for your word. We thank you for the
[1:21:17] convention. We thank you for the singing
[1:21:20] and for the worship and for the
[1:21:21] preaching and Lord for this service
[1:21:23] tonight that we want to dedicate to the
[1:21:25] young people, Father, that something
[1:21:26] would be said that will touch the heart
[1:21:28] of someone. Lord, I believe that there
[1:21:30] are some Samson in the building tonight,
[1:21:33] Lord, because Samson got himself into
[1:21:35] some trouble. He got himself into some
[1:21:37] problems. He was born with a purpose and
[1:21:39] somewhere along the journey, he lost
[1:21:41] sight of the purpose. But Lord, you
[1:21:43] didn't abandon Samson. And you're not
[1:21:45] going to abandon not one of our young
[1:21:47] people. You're not going to abandon not
[1:21:49] one of us, Father. So Lord, may you
[1:21:51] speak through to through your word
[1:21:52] tonight. May you touch each one, Lord.
[1:21:55] If there's someone backsliding in our
[1:21:56] midst, Father, may they be delivered
[1:21:58] tonight. Lord, is the third service. So
[1:22:00] many of us in our bodies are weary, but
[1:22:02] you are our strength tonight. You are
[1:22:04] our peace tonight. You are our reward
[1:22:07] tonight. And Lord, you saw this whole
[1:22:09] meeting before we even gathered here. So
[1:22:10] may you give us strength Lord for this
[1:22:12] short message tonight to encourage your
[1:22:14] people. Take me out of the way and speak
[1:22:16] to our hearts in the precious name of
[1:22:18] Jesus Christ. Amen. And amen. You may be
[1:22:20] seated.
[1:22:22] &gt;&gt; Certainly a great privilege to be here.
[1:22:23] I want to greet one and all in the
[1:22:25] precious name of Jesus Christ and uh
[1:22:28] certainly happy to be identified with
[1:22:31] each one that's here and those that are
[1:22:32] connected online. I certainly want to
[1:22:34] salute all the ministers that are
[1:22:35] present. Uh we appreciate all the
[1:22:37] ministers that have come from near and
[1:22:39] from far local and international.
[1:22:42] Certainly want to salute all the
[1:22:43] ministers who have greeted and those who
[1:22:45] have spoken as well as those that are
[1:22:47] yet to come. We love you. We appreciate
[1:22:50] you. I did not choose to be here
[1:22:52] tonight. I always say I'm a spare tire.
[1:22:55] Uh but the host pastor put me to speak.
[1:22:58] So I'm reporting for duty and I know
[1:23:00] there are many here that are far more
[1:23:02] qualified than I am to speak. But by the
[1:23:05] grace of God, we will endeavor to do
[1:23:07] what God wants us to do tonight.
[1:23:09] &gt;&gt; I have a short title tonight. The
[1:23:11] purpose of God can never be defeated.
[1:23:13] &gt;&gt; And brother Andrew actually started to
[1:23:15] preach on this. Hallelujah. The purpose
[1:23:17] of God can never be defeated. And you
[1:23:19] got to understand that there's a purpose
[1:23:21] for your life and there's nothing that's
[1:23:23] going to stop it. And once that purpose
[1:23:25] comes from God, the devil doesn't have
[1:23:26] enough devils. There aren't enough
[1:23:28] demons. There's not enough sickness.
[1:23:30] There's not enough depression. There's
[1:23:32] not enough drugs. There's not enough
[1:23:33] false doctrine. There's nothing could
[1:23:35] stop the purpose of God. Once God put
[1:23:38] something on your life, the devil is in
[1:23:40] trouble and he knows it. He going to try
[1:23:41] to distract you. He's going to try to
[1:23:43] keep you down. But God is faithful. Can
[1:23:45] the church say amen in the message, the
[1:23:48] evening messenger, I'm just laying a
[1:23:50] foundation. I'm not going to be long
[1:23:51] with you tonight, but just to lay a
[1:23:53] foundation. He said, "Notice, when the
[1:23:55] message is rejected and the messenger
[1:23:58] seems to be defeated, that's when God
[1:24:00] steps on the scene because God is the
[1:24:02] one who put the plan in place. He is the
[1:24:04] one who chose you. You didn't choose
[1:24:06] him. He is the one who called you. You
[1:24:09] didn't call him. You are not here
[1:24:10] because you accepted an invitation. You
[1:24:13] are here because God called you. You
[1:24:14] didn't have a choice to respond."
[1:24:16] Brother Brandham said, "The message will
[1:24:18] find itself in the hands of the
[1:24:20] predestinated." You couldn't even find
[1:24:22] the message. The message found you. You
[1:24:25] didn't choose the message. The message
[1:24:27] chose you. You didn't choose your house.
[1:24:30] God put you in your house for a reason.
[1:24:32] Whether it was a good house, a bad
[1:24:34] house, it doesn't matter because God is
[1:24:36] a God of purpose. That purpose had to be
[1:24:38] accomplished. If you were born in
[1:24:40] Nigeria, it's for a purpose. Born in
[1:24:43] Trinidad, it's for a purpose. Born in
[1:24:45] Germany, it's for a purpose. Born in
[1:24:47] South Africa, born for a purpose. And
[1:24:50] God by design, his purpose could never
[1:24:52] be defeated. God has never lost one. Not
[1:24:55] yet. His track record is unbeatable. He
[1:24:58] is the undefeated champion. And he said,
[1:25:01] "Because I live, you are going to live
[1:25:03] also." He said, "The same works I do,
[1:25:05] you are going to do also." Is there
[1:25:07] anybody in the house tonight who is
[1:25:09] ready to take their two hands? We're
[1:25:12] going to preach about Samson a little
[1:25:13] bit.
[1:25:16] Anybody sleeping?
[1:25:18] Hallelujah.
[1:25:20] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Because Samson is an
[1:25:22] interesting character.
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; We spend time on the once more Lord
[1:25:26] part. But Samson, even when Samson was
[1:25:28] in trouble, he was beating the devil
[1:25:30] left, right, and center. Oh, you don't
[1:25:32] hear me this evening. I don't care where
[1:25:35] the devil put you. I don't care what you
[1:25:37] lost. I don't care what's gone wrong.
[1:25:39] Samson was tied up.
[1:25:43] Do you know
[1:25:45] &gt;&gt; that the brothers in Judah, 3,000 of
[1:25:48] them
[1:25:49] &gt;&gt; when they looked at the Philistines,
[1:25:50] they came to find Samson. I'm ahead of
[1:25:52] my message already. They said, "Samson,
[1:25:54] the Philistines want you." He said,
[1:25:55] "Promise to not kill me." He said,
[1:25:56] "We're not going to kill you." And they
[1:25:58] tied up Samson.
[1:26:01] &gt;&gt; Samson was already given trouble,
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; but there was a seed of predestination.
[1:26:06] There was a purpose upon his life. He
[1:26:08] didn't call himself Oh, you don't hear
[1:26:10] me this evening. He didn't choose
[1:26:12] himself. He didn't put his name on the
[1:26:14] book. He didn't write his name there. He
[1:26:17] was not the angel that went to his
[1:26:18] parents' house. But because an angel
[1:26:21] went to his parents' house, there was no
[1:26:23] devil that could stop him. Oh, you don't
[1:26:25] hear me this evening. And the Bible said
[1:26:27] that the spirit of the Lord came upon
[1:26:30] Samson. If the spirit of the Lord ever
[1:26:32] come upon you, all your tiredness will
[1:26:35] leave. All of your depression will
[1:26:36] leave. Your sickness is trembling
[1:26:39] because the spirit of the Lord is able
[1:26:41] to break cancer, break leukemia, break
[1:26:44] Oh, you don't hear me tonight.
[1:26:47] Hallelujah. You have to forgive me.
[1:26:51] But Andrew started it. He said, "We are
[1:26:53] fanatics about this thing. Don't mess
[1:26:55] with me and my message. This message is
[1:26:57] too powerful. There's power in this
[1:27:00] message. There's an anointing in this
[1:27:02] message. It's a vindicated message.
[1:27:05] There's nothing you could tell me.
[1:27:08] Samson was backsliden, but the spirit of
[1:27:10] the Lord came upon him because it was a
[1:27:13] purpose upon his life. And listen, it
[1:27:16] was not just for Samson's sake. You
[1:27:18] know, it was the purpose God was
[1:27:20] fighting for. You don't hear me tonight.
[1:27:22] God was looking beyond Samson's mistake
[1:27:25] because the purpose was bigger than his
[1:27:27] mistake. The purpose was bigger than his
[1:27:29] sin. The purpose was bigger than
[1:27:32] Delilah. The purpose was bigger than the
[1:27:34] harlot. The purpose was bigger.
[1:27:39] Your purpose is your protection. Your
[1:27:42] purpose is what will keep you. Your
[1:27:44] purpose brought you here tonight. Your
[1:27:46] purpose woke you up this morning.
[1:27:50] Somebody give God a shout of praise.
[1:28:02] [Applause]
[1:28:13] There is nothing more powerful than a
[1:28:17] man with a purpose. There is nothing
[1:28:19] more dangerous than a woman with a
[1:28:22] purpose. You are born with a purpose.
[1:28:24] You are not picking up a purpose.
[1:28:30] You may be seated for a minute.
[1:28:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:28:39] Listen, Samson was the last judge. God
[1:28:43] in his plan always wanted a king.
[1:28:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:48] &gt;&gt; The era of the judges was a temporary
[1:28:51] transitional government. From Joshua
[1:28:54] entering the land
[1:28:56] &gt;&gt; to King David being anointed
[1:29:00] &gt;&gt; read the Bible
[1:29:03] &gt;&gt; in there.
[1:29:04] &gt;&gt; The Bible says that every judge
[1:29:07] &gt;&gt; was a response to a cry of the people.
[1:29:11] &gt;&gt; So the people would cry
[1:29:13] &gt;&gt; because they fell in sin
[1:29:15] &gt;&gt; and God would send them into oppression
[1:29:17] &gt;&gt; to discipline them. And after a while
[1:29:20] they would cry and God would respond.
[1:29:24] &gt;&gt; It was a response to a situation.
[1:29:27] &gt;&gt; And but the and the Bible said every
[1:29:29] judge after every judge it got worse.
[1:29:33] &gt;&gt; So by the time Samson was on the earth,
[1:29:35] it was the worst time.
[1:29:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:29:39] &gt;&gt; It was so bad. The Bible says you have
[1:29:41] to read what's there and what's not
[1:29:43] there. There is no evidence that the
[1:29:44] people cried.
[1:29:48] They cried before Jeffa. They cried
[1:29:50] before Gideon. They cried before Anne.
[1:29:53] They cried before all the other judges.
[1:29:57] &gt;&gt; And as a result of the cry of the
[1:29:59] people, just like when Moses, God said,
[1:30:01] "I've heard the cries of my people and
[1:30:03] have come down."
[1:30:04] &gt;&gt; The age was so wicked, the people
[1:30:06] stopped even crying. And they accepted
[1:30:08] for 40 years the Philistines as the
[1:30:10] oppressors until God said my purpose.
[1:30:14] I'm not even going to wait for them to
[1:30:15] cry. I'm going to go down myself. And
[1:30:19] the Bible said an angel of the Lord
[1:30:21] found a barren woman
[1:30:25] and said they're going to have a child
[1:30:26] and that child will begin the
[1:30:28] deliverance from the Philistines. I'm
[1:30:31] not even waiting for them to pray. I'm
[1:30:33] not waiting for them to cry. I am doing
[1:30:35] it myself because my purpose can never
[1:30:39] be defeated.
[1:30:48] &gt;&gt; Don't worry, mama. Your son is going to
[1:30:51] be delivered. Don't worry, papa. Your
[1:30:54] son is going to be delivered. Don't
[1:30:56] worry, grandma. Your son is coming back.
[1:31:01] Give the Lord a shout of praise.
[1:31:20] This is an encouragement to the parents
[1:31:22] &gt;&gt; because sometimes we see young people
[1:31:24] backslide and we look at the parents
[1:31:28] &gt;&gt; as if the parents messed up.
[1:31:31] &gt;&gt; What was Samson's excuse? Do you
[1:31:33] understand how Samson even came
[1:31:38] &gt;&gt; in Judges 13?
[1:31:41] &gt;&gt; And the children of Israel did evil
[1:31:42] again in the sight of the Lord.
[1:31:44] &gt;&gt; And the Lord delivered them into the
[1:31:45] hand of the Philistines 40 years.
[1:31:48] &gt;&gt; This is the longest period of bondage in
[1:31:50] the era of the judges.
[1:31:53] &gt;&gt; 40 years. And nobody cried.
[1:31:56] &gt;&gt; And there was a certain man of Zora
[1:31:58] &gt;&gt; of the family of the Danites.
[1:32:01] &gt;&gt; It was so bad. God went to the tribe of
[1:32:03] Dan. If you go to Revelation 7, you
[1:32:05] cannot even find the tribe there because
[1:32:07] that tribe did not possess their
[1:32:09] inheritance and they tried to possess
[1:32:10] what was not theirs.
[1:32:14] &gt;&gt; They do what they want to do. Come to
[1:32:16] church when they want to come to church.
[1:32:17] Behave how they want to behave. But God
[1:32:20] went in that house and found a family
[1:32:23] and said, "I'm going to visit through
[1:32:24] this family a deliverer to begin the
[1:32:27] deliverance of the Philistines.
[1:32:30] Don't tell me my God can't do anything.
[1:32:32] He is the God of the impossible.
[1:32:38] I don't care where your son is tonight.
[1:32:40] I don't care what your daughter is
[1:32:41] wearing tonight. I don't care what
[1:32:43] you're doing tonight. We serve the God
[1:32:45] of the impossible. He's the same
[1:32:48] yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:32:59] [Music]
[1:33:04] You may be seated.
[1:33:06] &gt;&gt; And my Bible tells me Judges 13 and
[1:33:09] verse three, and the angel of the Lord
[1:33:12] appeared unto the woman,
[1:33:14] &gt;&gt; and said unto her, Behold, now thou art
[1:33:16] barren, and beest not, but thou shalt
[1:33:18] conceive
[1:33:20] &gt;&gt; and bear a son.
[1:33:21] &gt;&gt; Now therefore, beware,
[1:33:23] &gt;&gt; I pray thee. Drink not wine, nor strong
[1:33:26] drink,
[1:33:27] &gt;&gt; and eat not any unclean thing.
[1:33:29] &gt;&gt; For lo, thou shalt conceive, and bear a
[1:33:33] son,
[1:33:34] &gt;&gt; and no razor shall come on his head.
[1:33:38] &gt;&gt; For the child shall be a Nazerite. Now
[1:33:40] when number six defines Nazarite,
[1:33:43] &gt;&gt; it was optional.
[1:33:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:33:46] &gt;&gt; You could choose to be a Nazarite. You
[1:33:47] could choose to take the Nazarite vow
[1:33:49] for a season. But here something is born
[1:33:53] or even before he is born he has been
[1:33:55] defined as a Nazerite from birth.
[1:33:57] Meaning his birth was already planned.
[1:34:00] His Nazarite vow was selected before you
[1:34:02] don't even hear me this evening. Your
[1:34:05] calling was before you got here. Your
[1:34:07] predestination is before you got here.
[1:34:10] God already see you delivered. He
[1:34:12] already see you with the Holy Ghost. He
[1:34:14] already see you break every chain, every
[1:34:17] shackle that's been holding you back.
[1:34:19] It's already broken.
[1:34:38] &gt;&gt; His mother is told
[1:34:41] &gt;&gt; he shall begin,
[1:34:42] &gt;&gt; hallelujah,
[1:34:43] &gt;&gt; to deliver Israel
[1:34:45] &gt;&gt; out of the hand of the Philistines.
[1:34:47] Samson's ministry was never to destroy
[1:34:50] them.
[1:34:50] &gt;&gt; It was to begin.
[1:34:54] &gt;&gt; God knew David was coming.
[1:34:56] &gt;&gt; God knew who was coming after.
[1:34:58] &gt;&gt; But Samson ministry was to begin the
[1:35:00] deliverance. And I believe that tonight
[1:35:03] will be a beginning
[1:35:05] &gt;&gt; of deliverance for somebody in the house
[1:35:07] tonight. I believe tonight is an anchor
[1:35:11] point for some wayward daughter, some
[1:35:13] wayward son who's been holding on for
[1:35:16] dear life. May this be your beginning of
[1:35:19] your deliverance. Can the church give
[1:35:21] the Lord a shout of praise?
[1:35:27] &gt;&gt; I want to skip a few verses cuz I want
[1:35:29] to help the parents
[1:35:31] &gt;&gt; before we get to the young people.
[1:35:36] The angel spoke to the woman. We don't
[1:35:38] have her name.
[1:35:40] &gt;&gt; Husband wasn't there at the time.
[1:35:42] &gt;&gt; He comes home
[1:35:44] &gt;&gt; and she tells him the testimony
[1:35:47] &gt;&gt; and he was like, "What is this?"
[1:35:50] &gt;&gt; A man of God came unto me
[1:35:52] &gt;&gt; and his countenance was like the
[1:35:53] countenance of an angel of the God. Very
[1:35:55] terrible.
[1:35:56] &gt;&gt; But I asked him not whence he was,
[1:35:57] neither told me his name. But he said
[1:35:59] unto me, "Behold, thou shalt conceive."
[1:36:01] She gives what the decree was, the
[1:36:04] positioning, what the requirement was.
[1:36:07] &gt;&gt; Then Monoah and you could see these are
[1:36:09] spiritual people.
[1:36:11] &gt;&gt; Monoah intreated the Lord and said, "Oh
[1:36:14] my Lord,
[1:36:15] &gt;&gt; let the man of God, which doubt did I
[1:36:18] send come again unto us.
[1:36:19] &gt;&gt; I want a witness. I want to experience
[1:36:22] it for myself. I was out at work and you
[1:36:24] visit my wife, but oh God, I don't want
[1:36:26] to be out of the picture. I want to know
[1:36:28] what I'm supposed to do. I want to know
[1:36:30] what I'm supposed to be expecting. I
[1:36:32] don't want to miss this blessing because
[1:36:34] we have been under the pressure of the
[1:36:35] Philistine for 40 years. And if what she
[1:36:38] is telling me is
[1:36:41] because it's been a long time we've been
[1:36:43] under bondage. But if you're telling me
[1:36:45] we about to be free, tell me we about to
[1:36:48] be free. You don't hear me tonight.
[1:36:52] Hallelujah.
[1:36:56] And the Bible says, "And God hearkened
[1:36:59] &gt;&gt; to the voice of Monoah."
[1:37:01] &gt;&gt; So I want you to appreciate God heard
[1:37:03] this. And God said, "If that's your
[1:37:05] request, this is so important to me.
[1:37:08] &gt;&gt; Even though I told your wife, I'll come
[1:37:10] down again because this son called
[1:37:12] Samson.
[1:37:15] &gt;&gt; This thing has got to work.
[1:37:17] &gt;&gt; I'm not getting a replacement." Oh, you
[1:37:19] don't hear me tonight.
[1:37:21] &gt;&gt; This thing has got to work. I've chosen
[1:37:23] him for this purpose. And as many times
[1:37:26] as I need to come, I will come to
[1:37:28] reinforce the message that I chose you
[1:37:30] for a purpose. If I need to tell you
[1:37:32] this Sunday, I'll say it. Tell you on
[1:37:35] Wednesday, I say it. Tell you on Friday,
[1:37:37] I say it. Tell you next Sunday, I say
[1:37:39] it.
[1:37:41] But you are going to be in the rapture.
[1:37:43] I say it today. I say it on Wednesday.
[1:37:46] Oh, come on now. Give the Lord a shout
[1:37:48] of praise.
[1:37:58] I'm not going to be too long.
[1:38:04] [Applause]
[1:38:09] &gt;&gt; But over the same to keep riding it.
[1:38:13] &gt;&gt; It's the third service.
[1:38:16] Brother,
[1:38:18] &gt;&gt; I heard brother Raymond said this
[1:38:19] morning, he don't want to get too
[1:38:20] anointed
[1:38:21] &gt;&gt; because if you get too anointed, we'll
[1:38:23] have you'll be here all night long.
[1:38:24] &gt;&gt; You know, one day there'll be a service
[1:38:26] we don't want to leave.
[1:38:29] &gt;&gt; You'll forget about your bills, forget
[1:38:31] about the traffic, forget about the
[1:38:33] state of emergency, forget about the
[1:38:35] government, forget about your problems
[1:38:37] because you're blending from time into
[1:38:39] eternity. The enemy wants to keep you
[1:38:41] out of your purpose.
[1:38:47] But I want to complete, you may be
[1:38:48] seated just for a few minutes. I want to
[1:38:50] paint a picture
[1:38:52] &gt;&gt; because it grieves all of us when our
[1:38:54] young people get into trouble.
[1:38:57] &gt;&gt; But here are parents who not only heard
[1:38:59] from God.
[1:39:05] &gt;&gt; Later in that chapter, Monoah, the angel
[1:39:07] came and Monoah said, "Now let thy words
[1:39:10] come to pass. How shall we order the
[1:39:12] child?
[1:39:15] So Monoah understood the purpose so
[1:39:18] much. He said how to raise him.
[1:39:20] &gt;&gt; What should I tell him in the morning?
[1:39:23] &gt;&gt; How should should we send him to this
[1:39:24] school or that school?
[1:39:27] &gt;&gt; How do we tell him how to choose his
[1:39:29] friends?
[1:39:30] &gt;&gt; What do we tell him about his
[1:39:32] environment,
[1:39:33] &gt;&gt; about the economy, about Tik Tok, about
[1:39:35] Facebook, about Instagram, about social
[1:39:38] media? What how should we order this
[1:39:40] child? Because we want to get it right.
[1:39:43] And I say to you young people here, your
[1:39:45] parents, they want to get it right.
[1:39:47] &gt;&gt; Monoah was doing everything he could do
[1:39:49] by having access to an angel.
[1:39:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:39:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:39:57] &gt;&gt; Young people say, "Well, my parents
[1:39:58] don't understand and they don't know
[1:40:00] what I'm going through."
[1:40:03] &gt;&gt; As if they were born yesterday.
[1:40:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:08] &gt;&gt; The important thing here that I see is
[1:40:10] the intent, the objective. Monoah wanted
[1:40:13] to get it right.
[1:40:16] &gt;&gt; You may not understand everything your
[1:40:18] father does or your mother does, but
[1:40:20] thank God if you're in a home that grew
[1:40:21] up in this message, your parents are
[1:40:23] trying to get it right.
[1:40:39] Amen. This helped me understand the pain
[1:40:41] that parents feel
[1:40:44] &gt;&gt; because you know in school there are
[1:40:46] some students the teachers write most
[1:40:48] likely to succeed
[1:40:50] &gt;&gt; and there are those Lord help them
[1:40:56] &gt;&gt; because Lord if you don't help them they
[1:40:58] will never amount to anything. Samson
[1:41:00] was most likely to succeed.
[1:41:02] &gt;&gt; Do you know in the Bible there are only
[1:41:04] five times that an angel came to
[1:41:06] announce a birth.
[1:41:08] Wow.
[1:41:10] &gt;&gt; Angels came to deal with the birth of
[1:41:12] Ishmael. An angel came an angel angel
[1:41:15] came to say, "Abraham, you're going to
[1:41:16] have a son, Isaac."
[1:41:18] &gt;&gt; Angel came to Mary to announce the
[1:41:20] birth.
[1:41:21] &gt;&gt; Anybody with me?
[1:41:22] &gt;&gt; And for John the Baptist.
[1:41:24] &gt;&gt; And the only other person that an angel
[1:41:27] came to announce a birth was Samson.
[1:41:29] &gt;&gt; And when you look at Samson's life, by
[1:41:31] the end of chapter 13,
[1:41:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Okay,
[1:41:37] &gt;&gt; I'll skip a few cuz we do have the full
[1:41:39] time here. But I just want to say the
[1:41:41] parents, they offered a sacrifice. They
[1:41:43] worshiped as a family to thank God for
[1:41:46] the revelation,
[1:41:48] &gt;&gt; the mystery of what was about to happen
[1:41:50] in this child called Samson. If you had
[1:41:52] asked the parents, "What you think how
[1:41:54] he's going to grow up and and will he
[1:41:55] get in trouble and will he be in church
[1:41:57] all the time?" They would have said,
[1:41:58] "Yes, an angel told me. They told me how
[1:42:00] to raise the child. We offered a
[1:42:02] sacrifice."
[1:42:04] &gt;&gt; They were even concerned. They said, "We
[1:42:05] saw God.
[1:42:07] &gt;&gt; We'll die." And the wife was spiritual.
[1:42:09] God help us. If you have a spiritual
[1:42:10] wife, you should be worshiping. The wife
[1:42:12] said, "If God was going to kill us, he
[1:42:14] to do it already."
[1:42:15] &gt;&gt; He accepted the sacrifice. He accepted
[1:42:17] the worship. We are all right. This
[1:42:19] thing is too important for God.
[1:42:24] &gt;&gt; Can we give the Lord a hand of praise?
[1:42:33] The end of chapter 13 says, "And a woman
[1:42:35] bear a son and call his name Samson, and
[1:42:37] the child grew, and the Lord blessed
[1:42:40] him,
[1:42:40] &gt;&gt; and the spirit of the Lord began to move
[1:42:42] him at times in the camp of Dan between
[1:42:45] Zora and Estrol."
[1:42:48] &gt;&gt; So the end of chapter 13 is what I would
[1:42:52] call Samson at his high point.
[1:42:54] &gt;&gt; This is young people who grew up in the
[1:42:55] message.
[1:42:59] They haven't gone to university. Maybe
[1:43:01] they haven't gone out and done this that
[1:43:02] that that and and they're like, "My God,
[1:43:04] it's so good."
[1:43:10] &gt;&gt; Judges 14 and verse one. I want you to
[1:43:13] remember that
[1:43:17] this family was located in Zora. The
[1:43:19] physical location matters.
[1:43:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:22] &gt;&gt; Whenever there's a word, a name, a
[1:43:24] description, a place in scripture, it's
[1:43:25] important. Brother Yadel said God is in
[1:43:27] numerology. He's very specific. They
[1:43:30] were in Zoro.
[1:43:31] And the Bible said, "And Samson in verse
[1:43:33] one of chapter 14 went down to Timnat."
[1:43:37] &gt;&gt; You see Timnat.
[1:43:40] &gt;&gt; That is the beginning of trouble.
[1:43:45] &gt;&gt; Because it was in Timnut.
[1:43:47] He saw a woman in Timnat.
[1:43:51] If he had stayed by the George Enzora.
[1:43:55] Yes,
[1:43:56] &gt;&gt; he would have not seen the woman
[1:44:01] &gt;&gt; of Timnut.
[1:44:04] &gt;&gt; And Samson went down to Timnut and saw a
[1:44:07] woman. Where? What are you doing in
[1:44:09] Timnut, brother?
[1:44:11] [Applause]
[1:44:16] &gt;&gt; The tribe of Dan have no business being
[1:44:18] in Timnat.
[1:44:20] &gt;&gt; What are you doing out of church on a
[1:44:22] Sunday? Come on, somebody help me preach
[1:44:24] back to me this morning. What are you
[1:44:26] doing in the club? What are you doing in
[1:44:28] shady places? Because you will only get
[1:44:30] in trouble in shady places.
[1:44:32] &gt;&gt; What are you doing on that website
[1:44:34] called Timnat? Oh, you don't hear me,
[1:44:35] don't?
[1:44:36] &gt;&gt; It's a h youth service tonight.
[1:44:40] &gt;&gt; How many friends do you have who live in
[1:44:42] Timnat?
[1:44:45] [Applause]
[1:44:53] saw a woman in Timnat of the daughters
[1:44:55] of the Philistines. And this becomes
[1:44:57] important because to this point, this is
[1:44:59] where it begins to show that Samson was
[1:45:01] now testing the edges of grace.
[1:45:05] &gt;&gt; And I want to share something because
[1:45:06] all of Samson's encounters with the
[1:45:08] spirit was actually him in trouble and
[1:45:10] God still blessing him. And Samson took
[1:45:13] for granted
[1:45:17] &gt;&gt; the grace of God.
[1:45:19] &gt;&gt; So we talk about the spirit of the Lord
[1:45:20] coming upon Samson. But God wasn't
[1:45:22] pleased with Samson. It is because of
[1:45:25] the purpose on his life. God sent the
[1:45:27] spirit upon him.
[1:45:29] &gt;&gt; Because the move from Zora to Timnath
[1:45:32] was one step away from purpose.
[1:45:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:36] &gt;&gt; We talk a lot about Delilah. Delilah was
[1:45:39] the third encounter. The woman in Timoth
[1:45:42] was the first.
[1:45:44] &gt;&gt; The harlot was the second. Delilah was
[1:45:46] the third. And each was in a different
[1:45:48] physical location that was deeper in
[1:45:50] Philistine territory. Read the Bible.
[1:45:56] &gt;&gt; The woman in Timnath and what I'm
[1:45:58] preaching on is when you go to the edge
[1:46:01] &gt;&gt; because what this was was just
[1:46:03] attraction.
[1:46:04] &gt;&gt; The Bible said he loved Elila.
[1:46:06] &gt;&gt; This woman, it was just a visual thing,
[1:46:09] you know.
[1:46:11] Can I preach?
[1:46:13] &gt;&gt; Coming for the brothers here tonight.
[1:46:15] Coming for the sisters here tonight.
[1:46:17] Coming for the young people here tonight
[1:46:19] because God is going to deliver you.
[1:46:21] There's a purpose on your life that will
[1:46:22] not be defeated. We will expose the
[1:46:24] devil any place any time under any
[1:46:27] condition.
[1:46:32] &gt;&gt; And Samson,
[1:46:34] he came up and told his father and his
[1:46:36] mother. Who would have heard from the
[1:46:37] angel?
[1:46:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. and said, "I have seen a woman in
[1:46:40] Timnat of the daughters of the
[1:46:42] Philistines. Now therefore, get her for
[1:46:45] me to wife."
[1:46:47] &gt;&gt; Then his father and mother said unto him
[1:46:49] what the prophet said, "Under no
[1:46:52] circumstance
[1:46:53] [Applause]
[1:46:55] &gt;&gt; should a believer marry an unbeliever."
[1:46:59] [Applause]
[1:47:00] &gt;&gt; Can we still preach that?
[1:47:02] &gt;&gt; Can we still say that? Is that not the
[1:47:04] word?
[1:47:06] You see this buffet style message?
[1:47:14] &gt;&gt; I'm on a vegan diet. Listen, you can't
[1:47:16] be vegan or gluten-free in the message.
[1:47:22] &gt;&gt; We taking everything.
[1:47:24] &gt;&gt; You have to eat everything.
[1:47:26] &gt;&gt; We have to take because it's to protect
[1:47:27] us. This is what started the problem in
[1:47:30] Samson's life. He desired to marry a
[1:47:33] woman from Timnat. Had that desire not
[1:47:35] been there, he would have never reached
[1:47:37] as far as Delila.
[1:47:44] Timnat is the text message you should
[1:47:46] not send. Oh God, help me tonight.
[1:47:49] &gt;&gt; The phone call you should not make.
[1:47:52] The response, oh, you don't hear me. Oh
[1:47:54] God, help me to preach tonight.
[1:47:56] &gt;&gt; The casual conversation that pushes the
[1:47:59] edge.
[1:48:00] &gt;&gt; There's nothing physical, is it? But
[1:48:02] you're saying things you shouldn't say.
[1:48:04] &gt;&gt; The desires are there that should not be
[1:48:06] there. But tonight, we are exposing
[1:48:08] Timnot and everything that lives in
[1:48:10] Timna. Because if it's a Philistine, you
[1:48:13] were raised up to be the beginning of
[1:48:15] the destruction of every Philistine. Can
[1:48:18] the church say amen?
[1:48:21] &gt;&gt; I'm trying to not be too long with you,
[1:48:23] but I hope this is helping somebody. But
[1:48:25] we are here to expose. We are not
[1:48:27] ignorant of Satan's devices. We will
[1:48:29] expose him.
[1:48:36] Hallelujah.
[1:48:39] &gt;&gt; And his father and his mother said unto
[1:48:40] him, "Is there never a woman among the
[1:48:42] daughters of the of thy brethren or
[1:48:44] among all light people? Is there nobody
[1:48:47] in your church or any of the message
[1:48:49] churches?
[1:48:53] &gt;&gt; What's your excuse?
[1:48:55] &gt;&gt; Do I need to identify the physical
[1:48:56] location of every message church?
[1:49:00] What's your reason for going to the
[1:49:01] world?
[1:49:02] &gt;&gt; Oh, you don't hear me tonight. Can we
[1:49:04] preach a message?
[1:49:08] [Applause]
[1:49:11] &gt;&gt; And that thou goest to take a wife of
[1:49:13] the uncircumcised Philistines.
[1:49:15] &gt;&gt; And Samson said unto his father, "Get
[1:49:17] her for me, for she pleased me well."
[1:49:18] And
[1:49:22] &gt;&gt; so the problem escalates though when his
[1:49:25] identity becomes compromised. And I want
[1:49:28] to skip because I'm all off of my notes.
[1:49:30] I don't even know where my notes are
[1:49:31] anymore. But somebody's pulling and I
[1:49:33] hope it's helping somebody tonight.
[1:49:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:49:37] &gt;&gt; We know Samson and the riddle. We're
[1:49:39] going to skip it. But he said that if
[1:49:41] you get the riddle,
[1:49:43] &gt;&gt; then I'm going to give you certain
[1:49:44] things.
[1:49:45] &gt;&gt; And the woman, this first woman who
[1:49:48] became his wife
[1:49:50] terrorized his life.
[1:49:53] &gt;&gt; You don't love me.
[1:49:56] Do you really love me? Because if you
[1:49:59] &gt;&gt; I know you're a Christian, but but
[1:50:01] there's something about me that you do
[1:50:02] love, right? Is it at least like because
[1:50:05] like and love is different. You could
[1:50:06] like me.
[1:50:09] &gt;&gt; She wore him down until he gave the
[1:50:12] answer to the riddle.
[1:50:13] &gt;&gt; And when they presented the answer, he
[1:50:15] was so angry.
[1:50:17] &gt;&gt; He killed 30 Philistines. Not out of
[1:50:20] purpose,
[1:50:22] &gt;&gt; but out of anger. Amen. Amen.
[1:50:24] &gt;&gt; To pay the debt for gambling
[1:50:27] &gt;&gt; because in Timna there's also gambling.
[1:50:29] Oh, you don't hear me tonight.
[1:50:34] &gt;&gt; Can we preach?
[1:50:36] &gt;&gt; This is in the same Bible we read,
[1:50:38] right?
[1:50:44] &gt;&gt; Listen,
[1:50:46] &gt;&gt; look at the pressure that they put on
[1:50:48] the wife.
[1:50:50] And it came to pass on the seventh day,
[1:50:52] this is when they supposed to answer the
[1:50:53] riddle, that they said unto Samson's
[1:50:54] wife, entice thy husband that he may
[1:50:57] declare unto us the riddle, lest we burn
[1:50:59] thee and thy father's house with fire.
[1:51:02] &gt;&gt; So under duress and threat,
[1:51:05] &gt;&gt; the other demonic Philistines put
[1:51:07] pressure on this Philistine wife to
[1:51:08] terrorize a servant of God with a
[1:51:10] purpose in his life to say, "We if you
[1:51:12] don't get the answer, we kill you."
[1:51:15] [Music]
[1:51:16] And verse 16, and Samson's wife wept
[1:51:18] before him
[1:51:21] &gt;&gt; and said, "Thou dost but hate me."
[1:51:25] &gt;&gt; Why you Why you doing this?
[1:51:29] Find any brother who have to break up
[1:51:30] with a worldly relationship.
[1:51:33] &gt;&gt; If you think break up in isolation is
[1:51:35] difficult, imagine breaking up with a
[1:51:37] Philistine.
[1:51:40] &gt;&gt; We dealing with some serious stuff here
[1:51:42] now. Because everybody looks like church
[1:51:44] on a Sunday and a Wednesday and on
[1:51:46] Monday and on a Tuesday and on a
[1:51:47] Thursday and a Friday is war
[1:51:50] &gt;&gt; because the devil is out to get you.
[1:51:52] &gt;&gt; The attack here was sponsored by the
[1:51:55] threat of killing, you know. So this
[1:51:57] woman was going after Samson because she
[1:52:00] knew if she didn't achieve the purpose
[1:52:01] she was going to get killed.
[1:52:03] &gt;&gt; You have to understand that the attacks
[1:52:05] on your life are being sponsored,
[1:52:07] financed by the enemy. Look at Delilah.
[1:52:09] The Bible said the five lords of the
[1:52:11] Philistines put up money to pay her to
[1:52:13] get Samson to give him a secret.
[1:52:16] &gt;&gt; It is sponsored terrorism.
[1:52:18] [Applause]
[1:52:22] &gt;&gt; The devil wants to destroy you.
[1:52:29] &gt;&gt; In the case of the wife, it was the
[1:52:30] threat of we kill you. In the case of
[1:52:32] the we have money for you.
[1:52:36] Amen.
[1:52:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:52:38] &gt;&gt; Can we go on?
[1:52:40] &gt;&gt; I promise you not be too long, but this
[1:52:42] thing starting to eat good
[1:52:44] &gt;&gt; because too many of us don't read our
[1:52:45] Bibles.
[1:52:48] &gt;&gt; Because the answer to everything we need
[1:52:49] is in the Bible and in the message of
[1:52:51] the hour
[1:52:53] &gt;&gt; to deal with any threat, to any
[1:52:55] obstacle, to any situation that you're
[1:52:57] facing is in the word.
[1:53:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:53:05] &gt;&gt; By verse seven, and she wept before him
[1:53:07] the seven days. You imagine your wife
[1:53:09] crying for seven days.
[1:53:12] &gt;&gt; It's not one day. It's not like a tears.
[1:53:14] And he gave seven days. She came crying.
[1:53:17] With breakfast came tears. With lunch
[1:53:19] there were tears. With dinner more
[1:53:21] tears.
[1:53:23] &gt;&gt; Samson, you don't love me.
[1:53:29] &gt;&gt; Maybe the first day he could have
[1:53:30] handled it. By day two, the tears were
[1:53:32] longer. By day three, she run out of
[1:53:34] tears
[1:53:40] &gt;&gt; to show her the devil is not going to
[1:53:41] give up.
[1:53:46] &gt;&gt; And it came to pass on the seventh day
[1:53:47] that he told her because she lay saw on
[1:53:50] him, it wore him down.
[1:53:54] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to use the word nag here,
[1:53:56] but it wore him down.
[1:54:02] and she told a riddle to her children of
[1:54:04] her people and the story goes they came
[1:54:06] and tell him and then he killed 30
[1:54:08] Philistines.
[1:54:09] &gt;&gt; So there's a parallel here part purpose
[1:54:12] but driven by the anger of this debt he
[1:54:14] now needs to pay
[1:54:16] &gt;&gt; because he lost this gamble because his
[1:54:18] wife exposed him.
[1:54:25] And the anger builds until we know
[1:54:28] Samson do a few things. I mean Samson
[1:54:30] was really like it's when I was studying
[1:54:32] this I told my wife it's almost
[1:54:33] difficult to preach about Samson because
[1:54:34] the spirit is anointing him but Samson
[1:54:36] is trouble
[1:54:38] Samson get foxes. You know what is to
[1:54:40] get a fox? Not one, two, tie them
[1:54:43] together, put a fire, set
[1:54:48] [Applause]
[1:54:52] [Music]
[1:54:55] &gt;&gt; 300 foxes,
[1:54:59] &gt;&gt; but George, not one fox, no. 300 foxes
[1:55:06] &gt;&gt; and took fire and turned tail to tail
[1:55:08] and put a fire brand.
[1:55:13] Now this is the verse I want to get here
[1:55:14] that verse six of chapter 15. And the
[1:55:16] Philistines said, "Who had done this to
[1:55:20] show you how Samson had lost his
[1:55:22] identity?" And they answered, "Samson,
[1:55:24] not of the tribe of Dan, not of Israel,
[1:55:28] &gt;&gt; not a judge, not a son of God, not an
[1:55:31] enemy." They say, "The son-in-law
[1:55:35] &gt;&gt; of the Tim Knight." In other words, his
[1:55:37] identity was already compromised. They
[1:55:39] didn't even know he went to church.
[1:55:44] &gt;&gt; You hear what I said? His identification
[1:55:47] was so compromised that when they asked
[1:55:50] who did this, brother George, they
[1:55:52] didn't say is this Israelite who married
[1:55:54] this girl? Is this son of Dan who
[1:55:56] married? This says the son-in-law of a
[1:55:58] Timite.
[1:56:01] &gt;&gt; Samson had lost himself. Now the prayer
[1:56:04] remember me
[1:56:06] &gt;&gt; starts to connect the dots
[1:56:08] &gt;&gt; because Samson knew he was so far gone.
[1:56:10] His identity was compromised and he
[1:56:12] hadn't even met Delilah yet.
[1:56:15] Hallelujah.
[1:56:17] Hallelujah.
[1:56:18] &gt;&gt; Too many of us in the message are living
[1:56:21] too close
[1:56:22] &gt;&gt; to the edge.
[1:56:25] &gt;&gt; Backsliding is not a today for tomorrow
[1:56:28] thing.
[1:56:36] &gt;&gt; I'm going to try to find a place to
[1:56:37] land.
[1:56:48] So in response to what Samson did with
[1:56:50] the foxes
[1:56:52] and when they identified was the son of
[1:56:54] the son-in-law of the Timite is when
[1:56:56] they actually killed his wife.
[1:56:59] That's what the Bible says.
[1:57:05] And Samson response was he smoed them
[1:57:07] hip and tie.
[1:57:10] &gt;&gt; So what we see here is a pattern of
[1:57:11] enrage, upset, anger, and frustration
[1:57:14] because Samson was lost. He was in
[1:57:16] trouble.
[1:57:22] &gt;&gt; And at this point, the men of Judah, the
[1:57:24] Bible said, they know what to do with
[1:57:25] Samson. The Philistines approached them,
[1:57:27] and 3,000 men of Judah went to Samson.
[1:57:32] No doubt that the Philistines are rulers
[1:57:34] over us. Now, I want us to appreciate
[1:57:36] every judge before Samson had an army.
[1:57:40] Samson had no army.
[1:57:42] &gt;&gt; In fact, the 3,000 men who came to lock
[1:57:44] him up, they actually came to lock him
[1:57:46] up.
[1:57:48] Samson's a champion and they want no
[1:57:50] identification with Samson.
[1:57:53] And this is what led to that great fight
[1:57:55] where they tied up Samson and say,
[1:57:56] "We'll hand you to the Philistines." And
[1:57:59] even though Samson was messed up, and
[1:58:02] this is here is part an encouragement,
[1:58:04] but it's also a warning to us because
[1:58:06] brother Brandham said, "Bride skies are
[1:58:08] not a sign of God's approval.
[1:58:10] &gt;&gt; God will deliver you and bless you, and
[1:58:13] he's waiting you to come out of the
[1:58:14] filth that you're in.
[1:58:16] &gt;&gt; He couldn't let this son suffer.
[1:58:19] &gt;&gt; A thousand men came to kill him, but an
[1:58:21] angel already came down. God already
[1:58:23] spoke upon his life. God already planned
[1:58:25] what his purpose was." So the Bible said
[1:58:26] the spirit of the Lord came upon Samson
[1:58:28] and Samson looked around. He had no
[1:58:31] sword. He had no shield. He had no army.
[1:58:33] This was a one-man army. The spirit of
[1:58:35] the Lord connected with the purpose in
[1:58:37] his soul. Overlooked the failures of his
[1:58:39] life. And he looked and found a jawbone.
[1:58:41] And the Bible said he started to swing.
[1:58:43] And brother Brandham said if that
[1:58:45] jawbone had connected with the helmet,
[1:58:46] it should have broken. But the spirit of
[1:58:48] the Lord was upon Samson. And Samson
[1:58:50] went to swinging brother. He swung once
[1:58:52] and one went down. And he felt better
[1:58:54] about himself. He swung again and by the
[1:58:56] time he was done a thousand Philistines
[1:58:58] were dead.
[1:59:00] &gt;&gt; Can the church say amen? Because the
[1:59:02] spirit of the Lord came upon him. And
[1:59:04] you know what I love about Samson? The
[1:59:05] Bible said Samson threw away the
[1:59:07] jawbone.
[1:59:09] &gt;&gt; Because he knew there was no power in
[1:59:10] the jawbone.
[1:59:11] &gt;&gt; If it was you, you polish the jawbone.
[1:59:13] Put the jawbone in a mant.
[1:59:16] &gt;&gt; I mean be honest.
[1:59:20] &gt;&gt; Because we love to hold on to things.
[1:59:22] &gt;&gt; Samson knew there was nothing in the
[1:59:24] jawbone. You know when the spirit of the
[1:59:25] Lord come upon him, he could use a
[1:59:27] jawbone. He could use a toothpick, he
[1:59:29] could use a spoon. It didn't matter what
[1:59:31] it was. Samson walk out throw away the
[1:59:33] jawbone. Oh, you don't hear me this
[1:59:36] evening
[1:59:37] because God was with Samson. The purpose
[1:59:40] on in him.
[1:59:42] [Applause]
[1:59:45] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to be too much longer with
[1:59:46] you.
[1:59:49] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:59:52] Hallelujah.
[1:59:58] &gt;&gt; All this was timid. But then Samson went
[2:00:01] worse. And this is the trouble with us.
[2:00:04] Unless the grace of God arrests us and
[2:00:06] we choose to repent.
[2:00:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:08] &gt;&gt; Because Samson was well brought up.
[2:00:11] &gt;&gt; He knew the word.
[2:00:12] &gt;&gt; His parents would have done all they
[2:00:13] could do. And he instead of going back
[2:00:16] home and to do his purpose, he goes into
[2:00:18] Gaza
[2:00:18] &gt;&gt; and that's where he found the hallot.
[2:00:21] He hasn't met Delilah yet.
[2:00:24] &gt;&gt; And the Philistines plot to kill him.
[2:00:26] And this is when they try to Samson got
[2:00:29] out in the night. They were waiting in
[2:00:30] the morning and they locked the gate.
[2:00:34] &gt;&gt; Could you imagine?
[2:00:35] &gt;&gt; Samson in trouble. Samson is trouble.
[2:00:39] &gt;&gt; Comes out of a worse situation than the
[2:00:41] previous one.
[2:00:43] &gt;&gt; Sees the gate
[2:00:44] &gt;&gt; and God says because of the purpose on
[2:00:46] your life, the spirit come upon Samson
[2:00:48] again. and something lift up the gate
[2:00:49] and the pose and the pillar. He said you
[2:00:51] can't lock me up. I'm in trouble but you
[2:00:53] cannot lock me up because the purpose in
[2:00:55] me is bigger than oh you don't hear me
[2:00:57] tonight. And that's why I say to you
[2:00:59] Johnny Crow, you can fly south because
[2:01:01] the purpose in you will set you free.
[2:01:03] You can go free anytime you want to go
[2:01:05] free.
[2:01:09] [Music]
[2:01:11] &gt;&gt; We know the story. It's not a
[2:01:13] complicated message tonight. It's to
[2:01:15] help somebody.
[2:01:16] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:01:20] [Music]
[2:01:22] So it went from he liked the woman in
[2:01:25] Timnat
[2:01:26] &gt;&gt; to just a physical encounter in Gaza
[2:01:28] that got them in trouble and then
[2:01:30] Delilah the Bible said he loved it
[2:01:31] shifted now
[2:01:34] &gt;&gt; to fall in love
[2:01:37] &gt;&gt; but I love him. I love her. We're in
[2:01:38] love. We're in love. You don't know.
[2:01:40] Nobody in church loves me like
[2:01:45] &gt;&gt; I've never felt that kind of love in
[2:01:47] church.
[2:01:49] &gt;&gt; This is what the church should have. And
[2:01:51] you hear all these arguments from the
[2:01:52] young people.
[2:01:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:01:55] &gt;&gt; The sisters in our church never look at
[2:01:56] me. The brothers in church never look at
[2:01:58] me.
[2:01:59] &gt;&gt; But she loves me and I love her.
[2:02:02] &gt;&gt; And the devil is in there.
[2:02:05] &gt;&gt; Because you're under a Nazerite vow.
[2:02:10] Hallelujah.
[2:02:13] &gt;&gt; Are we together tonight?
[2:02:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:02:19] &gt;&gt; And we know the story. This is this is
[2:02:21] familiar story to us.
[2:02:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:23] &gt;&gt; And Elila is paid by the five lords of
[2:02:26] the Philistines.
[2:02:29] &gt;&gt; And Samson is creative if it's one
[2:02:31] thing. He said, "If you tie me here up
[2:02:34] here and if you tie me with new ropes
[2:02:36] and
[2:02:38] until the Bible said, and I want to find
[2:02:40] a verse,
[2:02:45] &gt;&gt; we have the new ropes." She accuse him
[2:02:47] of lying. Imagine the Philistines
[2:02:52] bringing up a lying accusation. A demon
[2:02:54] telling you like, "You're lying. Tell me
[2:02:56] this."
[2:02:58] Could you imagine when you really spend
[2:03:01] time in the scriptures? So this is a
[2:03:03] this should encourage it's a paradox.
[2:03:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:03:06] &gt;&gt; Delilah said in this is this is chapter
[2:03:09] 16:15. And she said unto him, how can
[2:03:11] thou say I love thee
[2:03:13] &gt;&gt; when thine heart is not with me?
[2:03:16] &gt;&gt; When I tell you lyrics,
[2:03:19] &gt;&gt; wordsmith craft.
[2:03:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:03:22] &gt;&gt; Sam learned this a long time ago.
[2:03:27] Thou has mocked me these three times and
[2:03:29] hast not told me wherein thy great
[2:03:31] strength lith.
[2:03:33] &gt;&gt; Do you know there's a great strength
[2:03:35] that greater is he that's in you that he
[2:03:37] that's in the word. There's a strength
[2:03:38] in you that the devil wants to unlock
[2:03:40] the secret of why you are still
[2:03:42] standing. Why you in this service? You
[2:03:44] know your life is not right. But
[2:03:46] something is still in you that's holding
[2:03:48] the reigns that led you to this service
[2:03:50] tonight. Because it's a time of
[2:03:52] deliverance. Once you get between the
[2:03:54] pillars of what's holding you down, you
[2:03:56] will stand like Samson
[2:03:58] &gt;&gt; and say, "Remember me. I pray thee just
[2:04:01] this once."
[2:04:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:04:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:04:11] &gt;&gt; And verse 16
[2:04:14] of chapter 16. And it came to pass when
[2:04:16] she pressed him daily with her words. I
[2:04:19] want you to understand on your job, in
[2:04:20] your school, in your neighborhood,
[2:04:22] there's somebody pressing you daily.
[2:04:25] That's why you got to pray every day.
[2:04:26] Meditate on the word day and night. Stay
[2:04:29] in the spirit because there's no day the
[2:04:31] enemy is not trying to get you.
[2:04:36] &gt;&gt; Delilah did not let up. It was daily she
[2:04:38] pressed him
[2:04:41] &gt;&gt; daily with her words and urged him so
[2:04:43] that his soul was vexed unto death.
[2:04:47] I don't know what strategy she used, but
[2:04:49] every I don't even know what vex under
[2:04:51] death is. Maybe one of the elders could
[2:04:52] help preach on that.
[2:04:54] &gt;&gt; But whatever it was, it broke Samson.
[2:04:58] &gt;&gt; Because until this time, he was playing
[2:05:00] with grace.
[2:05:03] &gt;&gt; But this was about to be almost, and I
[2:05:06] use the word almost.
[2:05:10] &gt;&gt; Because he was on the edge of the line.
[2:05:11] Amen.
[2:05:12] &gt;&gt; There's a line that he was not supposed
[2:05:14] to cross
[2:05:15] &gt;&gt; because throughout all of this, there
[2:05:16] was something in him that he knew that
[2:05:18] if once he's here, which was a sign of
[2:05:20] the vow.
[2:05:22] &gt;&gt; Sign of the vow was in place, the devil
[2:05:24] couldn't get to him.
[2:05:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:29] &gt;&gt; Let me just drop this note here. It was
[2:05:31] not a spiritual happening. It was words
[2:05:37] &gt;&gt; that was used to break him down.
[2:05:39] &gt;&gt; Be careful who you talk to. Be careful
[2:05:42] who you have conversations with.
[2:05:44] &gt;&gt; There are people who are of illreute.
[2:05:46] People who hate the message. What do you
[2:05:48] have? They don't want it. That's them.
[2:05:51] &gt;&gt; Leave me. People want to believe what
[2:05:52] they want to believe.
[2:05:54] &gt;&gt; People believe all kinds of stuff. Don't
[2:05:55] get upset with me when I believe that I
[2:05:57] want to go to the rapture and I want to
[2:05:59] live holy and I want to
[2:06:04] &gt;&gt; the musicians. Get ready. I'm trying to
[2:06:05] wrap up.
[2:06:08] His
[2:06:12] soul was vexed unto death that he told
[2:06:14] her, listen to this scripture, brothers,
[2:06:16] if you could put it up, that he told her
[2:06:18] all
[2:06:20] &gt;&gt; his heart.
[2:06:22] &gt;&gt; King David, I believe, would say, "Thy
[2:06:23] word have I."
[2:06:31] &gt;&gt; He opened up
[2:06:33] &gt;&gt; his heart.
[2:06:39] and said unto her, there had not been a
[2:06:41] razor upon my head,
[2:06:44] &gt;&gt; for I have been a Nazerite unto God.
[2:06:46] &gt;&gt; Sisters, Brother Brandham said, you
[2:06:48] know, you are you under Nazarite bow.
[2:06:51] &gt;&gt; He said, when you cut your hair,
[2:06:53] &gt;&gt; you break the Nazarite bow.
[2:06:57] &gt;&gt; I don't care what the hairdresser says.
[2:07:00] &gt;&gt; She give me advice.
[2:07:02] &gt;&gt; Advice. You put your Nazarite vow, which
[2:07:05] is your protection on the wrist because
[2:07:07] of
[2:07:08] &gt;&gt; Philistine advice.
[2:07:10] &gt;&gt; Let's call it what it is.
[2:07:12] &gt;&gt; Because if it's not in support of your
[2:07:13] Nazarite vow, it's a Philistine
[2:07:15] recommendation.
[2:07:17] &gt;&gt; And you want to know why you can't see
[2:07:19] your way and you can't make progress.
[2:07:20] And the enemy, the enemy is always
[2:07:22] fighting you. But you have stepped out
[2:07:24] from under the Nazarite vow.
[2:07:27] &gt;&gt; Every single time the enemy attacks
[2:07:29] Samson, the spirit of the Lord come upon
[2:07:30] him. And the Bible, this is to me the
[2:07:32] most scary scripture in the entire
[2:07:35] Bible.
[2:07:38] [Music]
[2:07:39] &gt;&gt; Verse 20
[2:07:41] when he gave the secret
[2:07:43] &gt;&gt; because the wife brought someone to
[2:07:44] shave his hair and he woke out of his
[2:07:47] sleep. And he said, I will go out as at
[2:07:48] other times before and shake myself
[2:07:51] &gt;&gt; and he wished not
[2:07:53] &gt;&gt; that the Lord was departed from him.
[2:07:57] It's a scary thing
[2:07:58] &gt;&gt; to not even know that God is not with
[2:08:01] you anymore.
[2:08:03] &gt;&gt; No wonder David said, "Lord, take not
[2:08:05] your Holy Spirit from me.
[2:08:07] &gt;&gt; Create in me a clean heart, oh God, and
[2:08:10] renew a right spirit. Cast me not away
[2:08:12] from thy presence, oh God."
[2:08:15] &gt;&gt; Samson got up thinking that God was with
[2:08:18] him, but he didn't even realize
[2:08:21] &gt;&gt; that the spirit had left him. There are
[2:08:24] people have been in a message for a long
[2:08:26] time and they don't even realize
[2:08:29] &gt;&gt; that the spirit
[2:08:31] &gt;&gt; is not with you.
[2:08:35] &gt;&gt; Samson was called. He was anointed. He
[2:08:38] was under a covenant. But at that
[2:08:39] moment, the spirit
[2:08:42] &gt;&gt; had already departed.
[2:08:44] &gt;&gt; The fact that the angel came had nothing
[2:08:47] to do with the fact that the spirit had
[2:08:48] departed. Oh, you don't hear me? All of
[2:08:51] the teaching his parents gave him had
[2:08:52] nothing. God was no longer pleased. God
[2:08:55] was tired. He had reached the end of his
[2:08:57] road.
[2:08:59] [Music]
[2:09:01] &gt;&gt; At that point, Samson was backsliden.
[2:09:03] But the Brandham said it. He says Samson
[2:09:05] knew he had sinned.
[2:09:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:09:09] &gt;&gt; And when they came to get him,
[2:09:11] &gt;&gt; he thought he had the strength.
[2:09:13] &gt;&gt; And this is when people now walk out of
[2:09:15] church because all the strength you had
[2:09:16] now is gone and the enemy wipes you out.
[2:09:20] Yes, Lord.
[2:09:21] &gt;&gt; And we read the scripture that we
[2:09:24] started with.
[2:09:25] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. Thank you, Lord.
[2:09:27] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:09:28] &gt;&gt; Verse 21. But the Philistines took him.
[2:09:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:09:31] &gt;&gt; That's the first thing they did. They
[2:09:32] took him. Never before. There was never
[2:09:34] a battle that Samson lost
[2:09:37] &gt;&gt; until he stepped out from under his
[2:09:40] Nazarite vow.
[2:09:42] &gt;&gt; You play with that boy, you play with
[2:09:44] that girl, you play with pornography and
[2:09:46] fornication and adultery and all these
[2:09:48] things. You are stepping out from under
[2:09:49] your Nazerite vow. You give the pastor a
[2:09:53] horrible time because he doesn't even
[2:09:55] know sometimes what's going on. He could
[2:09:57] discern there's something wrong. But you
[2:09:58] are outside. You are out of order. He
[2:10:01] say, "Well, pray for me. Pray for me."
[2:10:03] But you're still in the thing. You still
[2:10:05] have clothes. Like brother Stephan said,
[2:10:06] like Achan where God told him, "Do that
[2:10:09] mess with the stuff from Jericho.
[2:10:13] &gt;&gt; Leave their clothes. Leave their money.
[2:10:15] Leave their music. Leave their styles.
[2:10:18] Leave their fashions. Leave their Leave
[2:10:20] it all. It's not yours. You are under a
[2:10:22] covenant.
[2:10:25] &gt;&gt; You want God to bless you? Stay under
[2:10:28] your Nazarite vow. Young sisters,
[2:10:31] protect your virginity. Stay under the
[2:10:34] vow.
[2:10:39] Hallelujah.
[2:10:40] [Applause]
[2:10:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:10:47] Samson had a choice and he knew better.
[2:10:51] &gt;&gt; You cannot tell me he didn't know.
[2:10:53] &gt;&gt; The angelic visitation would have had an
[2:10:55] atmosphere in that home.
[2:11:00] &gt;&gt; It was a spiritual home. He grew up in
[2:11:02] the message. But he made a choice.
[2:11:05] Timnat,
[2:11:07] &gt;&gt; Sorak,
[2:11:08] &gt;&gt; Gaza,
[2:11:10] &gt;&gt; spending time further and further
[2:11:13] &gt;&gt; if not but for the grace of God that God
[2:11:17] could find a way to tie purpose to his
[2:11:20] grace.
[2:11:21] &gt;&gt; And could say all things could work
[2:11:23] together for good, but he has to see a
[2:11:25] certain level of repentance.
[2:11:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:11:28] &gt;&gt; So, brother Brandon would say, and you
[2:11:30] know it, we've read his quotes. Samson
[2:11:32] knew he was wrong. He say, "Lord,
[2:11:33] remember me.
[2:11:37] Oh God.
[2:11:38] &gt;&gt; They shaved his hair. The Bible said his
[2:11:40] hair grew back. It meant Samson was not
[2:11:42] in prison for one day.
[2:11:44] &gt;&gt; He had never cut his hair for his life.
[2:11:46] So for his hair to grow back, it was not
[2:11:49] one day he was grinding at the mill.
[2:11:51] &gt;&gt; Do you know that God Deegon is tied to
[2:11:54] mill and grain?
[2:11:56] Do you know in the whole of the four
[2:11:58] chapters 13, 14, 15, 16 of judges, there
[2:12:02] is never a situation of Samson having an
[2:12:04] altar,
[2:12:06] &gt;&gt; a sacrifice.
[2:12:08] &gt;&gt; Go back to Deborah and go back to all
[2:12:10] the other judges. When there was a
[2:12:11] victory, there was worship, there was an
[2:12:13] altar.
[2:12:14] &gt;&gt; When Samson wins, he walks away. The
[2:12:16] Lord just blessed me. There's no
[2:12:18] thanksgiving.
[2:12:18] &gt;&gt; All right.
[2:12:22] The only prayer before that remember me
[2:12:24] prayer was after Samson killed a
[2:12:26] thousand men and he say well Lord yes
[2:12:28] see I win I thirsty give me some water
[2:12:31] read it no sincerity. He took his gift
[2:12:34] for granted. He took the message for
[2:12:36] granted. He took the books and the tapes
[2:12:38] for granted. He thought God was going to
[2:12:40] be with him all the time. But here it
[2:12:42] was. God stepped away so he could find
[2:12:45] himself. so he could come back to him in
[2:12:47] a new experience, a fresh experience.
[2:12:50] [Music]
[2:12:50] [Applause]
[2:12:52] [Music]
[2:12:57] &gt;&gt; You can begin to play something softly.
[2:13:06] &gt;&gt; The Philistines took him. That's the
[2:13:08] first thing. The reality
[2:13:12] &gt;&gt; in the past when they tied him, he could
[2:13:14] just break. But here it was. He's being
[2:13:16] taken.
[2:13:18] &gt;&gt; The thoughts running through his mind,
[2:13:21] &gt;&gt; they have taken me. Thank you, Jesus.
[2:13:26] &gt;&gt; I can't fight anymore.
[2:13:28] &gt;&gt; I have no army coming for me.
[2:13:30] &gt;&gt; I know what it feels like to be strong.
[2:13:32] I know what it was when I first came
[2:13:34] into the message. I know what it was
[2:13:36] when I felt the spirit of God. I knew
[2:13:38] that when the enemy came, there was no
[2:13:40] weapon formed against me could prosper.
[2:13:42] And here the enemy has taken me.
[2:13:47] &gt;&gt; But that's not the bad part.
[2:13:50] &gt;&gt; I want you to imagine
[2:13:52] &gt;&gt; Samson being taken.
[2:13:53] &gt;&gt; My God.
[2:13:55] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[2:13:56] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:13:57] &gt;&gt; And maybe there's a conversation. What
[2:13:58] are we going to do with him?
[2:14:01] &gt;&gt; And somebody decide, why don't we take
[2:14:02] out his eyes?
[2:14:04] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:14:06] &gt;&gt; Have you stopped to think
[2:14:08] &gt;&gt; about what it is like for your eyes to
[2:14:10] be taken out?
[2:14:12] There was no anesthesia.
[2:14:15] &gt;&gt; They wanted to inflict pain.
[2:14:17] &gt;&gt; I wonder why they didn't kill him
[2:14:20] &gt;&gt; after all that he had done. But they
[2:14:22] wanted Samson to suffer.
[2:14:26] &gt;&gt; Do you understand? The devil wants you
[2:14:27] to suffer. The world you think is so
[2:14:30] beautiful and so wonderful and you can't
[2:14:32] live without it.
[2:14:34] &gt;&gt; The devil that's behind that wants you
[2:14:36] to suffer.
[2:14:38] &gt;&gt; Not just go to hell. He wants you to
[2:14:40] suffer.
[2:14:45] [Applause]
[2:14:47] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham would say tears could
[2:14:49] run out of socketless eyes.
[2:14:53] &gt;&gt; Before he reached the mill, his eyes
[2:14:55] were gone.
[2:14:57] &gt;&gt; They took him first.
[2:14:59] &gt;&gt; They took out his eyes.
[2:15:03] &gt;&gt; Brought him down to Gaza. So took him
[2:15:05] down into the middle, the deepest part
[2:15:07] of the Philistine Empire.
[2:15:09] All right.
[2:15:10] &gt;&gt; At no time before this, brother George
[2:15:12] would the Lords of the Philistines even
[2:15:14] dream
[2:15:15] &gt;&gt; of coming near to Samson.
[2:15:18] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:15:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:15:22] &gt;&gt; There's somebody in prison tonight.
[2:15:27] &gt;&gt; They brought him down to Gaza,
[2:15:29] &gt;&gt; bound him with fetas of brass,
[2:15:32] &gt;&gt; and he did grind in the prison house.
[2:15:35] Some historians would say grinding the
[2:15:38] grain in the house of Deeon was a sign
[2:15:40] of worship
[2:15:43] &gt;&gt; and we read this scripture. They were
[2:15:45] having a service to their god Deeon.
[2:15:48] They didn't even say Delilah did it.
[2:15:51] They didn't say it was the money from
[2:15:52] the five lords of the Philistines who
[2:15:54] paid and financed it. They said our God
[2:15:57] Deeon had brought our enemy to his feet
[2:16:02] who have hurt many of us.
[2:16:04] Cancer is a Philistine. High blood
[2:16:08] pressure is a Philistine. Pornography is
[2:16:11] a Philistine. And they are in fellowship
[2:16:14] worshiping because they believe that
[2:16:16] they had something. Oh, you don't hear
[2:16:18] me tonight.
[2:16:20] Somebody's going to go free tonight.
[2:16:25] [Applause]
[2:16:29] The Bible said it was five lords of the
[2:16:33] Philistines had paid Delilah. But in
[2:16:36] this scripture, the Bible said all
[2:16:39] all the lords. I don't know how many
[2:16:41] lords there were. I don't know how many
[2:16:43] spirits there were. I don't know what
[2:16:45] attack it was in your home against your
[2:16:47] family. But I do know that the devil
[2:16:49] made the biggest mistake he could ever
[2:16:52] make by congregating an attack against
[2:16:55] God's son.
[2:16:58] The purpose of God by election was
[2:17:01] standing up for Samson. Something in him
[2:17:05] reconnected to his purpose. He said, "I
[2:17:08] know who I am. They call me the
[2:17:11] son-in-law of a Tim Knight, but God
[2:17:13] remember me. I am not that. That's not
[2:17:17] my name. That's not who I am. Oh God,
[2:17:20] help me tonight.
[2:17:29] [Music]
[2:17:30] [Applause]
[2:17:34] I don't know how long Samson was
[2:17:36] grinding at the mill,
[2:17:39] &gt;&gt; grinding at the mill.
[2:17:42] Thinking back to the church services,
[2:17:45] thinking back to the conventions,
[2:17:47] thinking back to the prayer meetings he
[2:17:49] missed, living with regret, living with
[2:17:52] the pain. When the pastor called for him
[2:17:55] and he didn't answer. When the deacon
[2:17:57] reached out and he switched off his
[2:17:58] phone and he ignored a phone call. When
[2:18:01] the kind sister said, "I'm not seeing
[2:18:03] you in church, Samson. Samson, what's
[2:18:05] wrong with you? Come back to church,
[2:18:07] Samson. Don't go down to Sorak. Don't go
[2:18:10] down to Gaza. We love you, Samson."
[2:18:14] Brother Brandham said he was remembering
[2:18:18] all of his victories.
[2:18:22] &gt;&gt; But something came into him. It is the
[2:18:25] first time Samson really prayed. Maybe
[2:18:28] as a child he went to prayer meetings,
[2:18:30] but this is the first time that he
[2:18:32] really prayed. Oh God, help me.
[2:18:35] Hallelujah.
[2:18:37] Hallelujah.
[2:18:39] Hallelujah. And Samson called her to the
[2:18:41] Lord. It is the first time we hear in
[2:18:44] the Bible that he really called. People
[2:18:47] talk words in a prayer meeting, but
[2:18:50] Samson called upon the Lord
[2:18:55] and said, "Oh Lord God, remember me.
[2:18:59] Remember me. Don't forget me, Lord.
[2:19:02] Don't pass me by. Lord, I'm messed up,
[2:19:04] but remember me. Remember me, Lord.
[2:19:10] I pray thee
[2:19:12] &gt;&gt; and strengthen me.
[2:19:13] &gt;&gt; I pray thee
[2:19:15] &gt;&gt; only this once, oh God,
[2:19:17] &gt;&gt; that I may be at once avenge of the
[2:19:19] Philistines for my two eyes.
[2:19:22] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said the devil had no
[2:19:25] right.
[2:19:27] &gt;&gt; Mama, papa,
[2:19:29] &gt;&gt; your son could be in trouble, but the
[2:19:31] devil had no right.
[2:19:33] &gt;&gt; Oh God, he didn't put those eyes in
[2:19:36] there. The devil had no right. He didn't
[2:19:39] raise that boy. The devil has no right.
[2:19:42] We take away the permission from the
[2:19:44] devil tonight to afflict your home. We
[2:19:48] deny him the privilege of walking into
[2:19:51] your house. The devil has no right
[2:19:54] because the purpose of God can never be
[2:19:57] defeated.
[2:20:00] You are free in the name of Jesus
[2:20:02] Christ. And who the son of man set free
[2:20:05] is free indeed. Free and teeth. Free and
[2:20:09] teeth. You can go free. House of hell,
[2:20:13] give way to the name of the Lord Jesus
[2:20:16] Christ.
[2:20:17] [Applause]
[2:20:29] And brother Brandham said Samson was
[2:20:32] willing to pay the price. He was willing
[2:20:37] to throw away his phone. He was willing
[2:20:39] to break friendships. He was willing to
[2:20:42] walk away from a girlfriend, walk away
[2:20:44] from a boyfriend, walk away from
[2:20:46] drinking, walk away from sin, walk away
[2:20:49] from filth. He was willing. He said,
[2:20:51] "Lord, let me die with these
[2:20:53] Philistines. I'm willing to die out
[2:20:56] tonight to lust, to pride, to gambling,
[2:20:59] to whatever it is." All listen. Oh, God
[2:21:03] help me.
[2:21:06] I challenge you, young brother, young
[2:21:08] sister,
[2:21:10] &gt;&gt; mama, papa,
[2:21:11] &gt;&gt; you could go free if you want to go
[2:21:13] free.
[2:21:14] &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter what the sin is.
[2:21:17] &gt;&gt; The Bible actually doesn't give a
[2:21:18] specific number of Philistines.
[2:21:24] [Music]
[2:21:34] The Bible said, "And they were upon the
[2:21:35] roof
[2:21:36] &gt;&gt; about 3,000."
[2:21:42] &gt;&gt; They didn't bother to specify the
[2:21:43] number. It meant all them demons and
[2:21:45] spirits that were supposed to be there
[2:21:47] that God wanted to destroy, they were in
[2:21:50] that gathering.
[2:21:53] &gt;&gt; High blood pressure was there. Diabetes
[2:21:56] was there. Cancer was there. Female
[2:21:59] condition. Arthritis was there. Doubt
[2:22:02] was there. Unbelief was there. Fear was
[2:22:06] there. Can't sleep at night. Your
[2:22:08] husband giving trouble. Whatever that
[2:22:10] spirit is, all of them were there.
[2:22:12] Samson said, "Leave me to the pillars."
[2:22:14] But the Stephanus touch it last night.
[2:22:16] And the mystery in him was bigger than
[2:22:19] the strength of the pillars, the power
[2:22:22] in him, the purpose in him. And because
[2:22:25] of who he was and the purpose that was
[2:22:27] upon him, God was obligated to honor.
[2:22:32] God in his mind had already seen not
[2:22:36] only Samson deliverance, he had all the
[2:22:39] laws where he wanted them. He had all
[2:22:41] the Philistines where he wanted them. He
[2:22:44] had Samson where he wanted them. God
[2:22:47] looked down and he looked at the
[2:22:49] beginning of the destruction of the
[2:22:52] Philistines. For the first time, Samson
[2:22:55] was in his purpose and Samson held the
[2:22:58] walls. He began to shake and the
[2:23:00] anointing came upon him. May his
[2:23:03] building shake tonight under the power
[2:23:05] of the anointing. May everything holding
[2:23:07] you back shake tonight. Every
[2:23:10] Philistine, you are free. You are free.
[2:23:15] [Applause]
[2:23:20] Young brother, young sister, tonight is
[2:23:22] your night. I challenge you. Hold on to
[2:23:26] your pillars.
[2:23:28] Put your hands on your pillars tonight.
[2:23:33] Hallelujah. You are a conqueror. You are
[2:23:37] more than a conqueror. I'm finished. I'm
[2:23:40] finished tonight. But it's even you can
[2:23:42] bring it to sing.
[2:23:44] Don't leave this service in bondage.
[2:23:48] Don't leave this service broken. You
[2:23:50] could go free tonight. You are free
[2:23:53] tonight. God is here to restore. God is
[2:23:56] here to restore. Young brother, young
[2:23:59] sister. Oh, every head bowed, every eye
[2:24:01] closed.
[2:24:04] &gt;&gt; That's so true.
[2:24:05] &gt;&gt; I didn't want to take this long, but Oh,
[2:24:08] God. Let me just end with this.
[2:24:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:24:14] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Brother Brandham said
[2:24:18] they never noticed the tears running
[2:24:20] down from them sockets where he once had
[2:24:23] eyes. They never noticed the moving of
[2:24:25] his lips. His eyes briney tears
[2:24:28] streaming down from the sockets. He
[2:24:30] wanted God to make his word once more
[2:24:32] vindicated to prove as I say to this
[2:24:35] Delilah today or this rather Jesus
[2:24:37] Christ the same yesterday, today and
[2:24:40] forever. Oh hallelujah. Glory to God.
[2:24:44] Hallelujah. Just once more, Lord. Once
[2:24:47] more, Lord. Once more, Lord. Brother
[2:24:50] Brandham said he didn't see what was
[2:24:52] taking place. He felt what was taking
[2:24:55] place. Young brother, young sister, if
[2:24:57] you He felt what was taking place. Young
[2:24:59] brother, young sister, if you feel the
[2:25:01] presence of the Lord, don't you leave
[2:25:03] this place. There's something taking
[2:25:05] place. Oh, I'm finished tonight. But you
[2:25:07] are free. You want to make your altar
[2:25:09] where you sit. That's fine. You want to
[2:25:11] make your altar at the church in the
[2:25:13] front. That's fine. But Samson, you
[2:25:15] could go free tonight. Brother, you
[2:25:17] could go free tonight. Sister, you could
[2:25:20] go free tonight. And parents, take
[2:25:22] courage. Tonight is your night. May the
[2:25:24] Lord richly bless you.
[2:25:29] [Music]
[2:25:36] Hallelujah.
[2:25:38] Oh, give him praise. Give him praise.
[2:25:41] Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Jesus.
[2:25:45] You call upon him tonight. Thank you,
[2:25:48] Lord.
[2:25:49] Jesus.
[2:25:51] Yes, Lord.
[2:25:54] Yes, Lord Jesus.
[2:25:57] Hallelujah Lord.
[2:26:00] Thank you Jesus.
[2:26:06] [Music]
[2:26:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Thank you Jesus.
[2:26:12] [Music]
[2:26:17] &gt;&gt; Oh blessed be the name of the Lord. You
[2:26:20] cry out this evening. You call upon him.
[2:26:23] Thank you Jesus.
[2:26:25] I want to go
[2:26:29] where the rivers cannot
[2:26:32] overflow me.
[2:26:35] Where my feet are on the rock.
[2:26:43] And I want to hide
[2:26:47] where the cares of this world cannot
[2:26:51] choke me.
[2:26:54] In your presence,
[2:26:57] oh God,
[2:27:01] in your presence.
[2:27:06] Oh, that's where
[2:27:11] your prayer.
[2:27:15] Oh Lord,
[2:27:19] when your pray
[2:27:22] and sword Jesus,
[2:27:26] that's where I belong.
[2:27:29] [Music]
[2:27:30] seeking your face.
[2:27:33] &gt;&gt; Touching your grave,
[2:27:35] &gt;&gt; touching your gra

[2:27:41] &gt;&gt; In the
[2:27:44] rock.
[2:27:46] [Music]
[2:27:47] Oh Jesus,
[2:27:50] in your presence,
[2:27:53] oh Lord,
[2:27:56] [Music]
[2:27:58] I want to hide
[2:28:02] where the flood of evil
[2:28:05] cannot reach me.
[2:28:08] Where I'm covered by the blood.
[2:28:15] Oh, I want to be
[2:28:20] where the schemes of darkness cannot
[2:28:24] touch me.
[2:28:27] In your presence,
[2:28:29] oh God.
[2:28:32] Oh, in your
[2:28:35] in your presence.
[2:28:38] Oh,
[2:28:39] somebody run into his presence tonight.
[2:28:42] Hallelujah.
[2:28:45] Oh, your purpose is attached to the
[2:28:48] presence of God. Stay in the presence of
[2:28:50] God tonight. Oh yes, Lord Jesus. Oh.
[2:28:56] Oh, that's where I belong.
[2:29:00] [Music]
[2:29:02] Seeking your face.
[2:29:05] Pro
[2:29:07] your grace.

[2:29:21] In your presence. Oh, sing it one more
[2:29:24] time with all your heart. In your

[2:29:31] Yes, Lord Jesus.
[2:29:34] That's where I am strong.

[2:30:18] oh Lord,
[2:30:21] just praise him. Raise your hands. Close
[2:30:22] your eyes and just talk to him for a few
[2:30:25] minutes. This is your time to talk to
[2:30:27] the Lord. Hallelujah. Jesus. Yes, Lord.
[2:30:33] Oh, yes, Lord. Oh, you can be delivered

[2:30:59] Stay in the presence of the Lord.
[2:31:02] Oh, don't play with the grace of God.
[2:31:05] Don't play with the grace of God. Stay
[2:31:07] in his presence tonight. That's where
[2:31:10] your strength lies, young brother, young
[2:31:12] sister.
[2:31:14] Amen. The purpose of God can never be
[2:31:16] defeated.
[2:31:18] Oh Lord, prepare
[2:31:21] me
[2:31:23] to be a sanctuary.

[2:31:51] Hallelujah,
[2:31:53] Lord.
[2:31:55] Lord, prepare me, oh Lord.
[2:31:59] &gt;&gt; Oh, make it a prayer tonight.
[2:32:02] He has sent you.

[2:33:15] brother, sister to sister.
[2:33:18] And you say a prayer for your brother
[2:33:20] tonight. Just a few minutes.

[2:33:29] [Music]
[2:33:31] get a burden for your brother this

[2:35:19] No one can.
[2:35:23] No one will
[2:35:30] who can stand against the king.
[2:35:35] No one can.
[2:35:39] No one will. Who can stand?
[2:35:45] [Music]
[2:35:46] Who can stand against the Lord?
[2:35:51] No one can.
