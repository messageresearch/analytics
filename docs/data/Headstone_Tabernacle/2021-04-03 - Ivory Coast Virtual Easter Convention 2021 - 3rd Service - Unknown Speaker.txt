church we are so glad to be invited to this meeting and uh we are still basking on this money leaving on the show we are the living waters for glory to bless you and i want to appreciate um all the ministers that are going to minister in this convention for me it's just a testimony i've been invited to give a testament of about 10 minutes or so and i pray that god is going to use it to really bless you the testimony of who jesus is and we've been testifying way back the foundation of the world we stood with michael the time that lucifer came to make her a little disturbance in the heaven of god and we kicked him out praise god remain we are back here again as manifested sons of god and we have no other program but to execute the command of our lord jesus christ against the devil and that is why we are here again to shake everything to approach anything that the enemy had planted along the way because we are marching back again to the eden of god from where we were before so sons of god are coming back and i'm glad you are there and i'm glad to be there and i'm glad the children of god are coming back again to be manifested and now is that time to be manifested god richly bless you thank you some leader and i bless all of you for making this a reality today it may just quickly i have some scriptures here but i'm going to read out one and the other ones you can read later i have to read felicia [Music] philippians chapter 2 from verse 5 to 8 and then i have mark 10 from 35 to 14 amen and if you have your bible please come with me to the book of philippians chapter 2 from verse five and they raise these wise let this mind be in you which was also in christ who being in the form of god taught it not robbery to be able with god but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of me and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the cross may god our blessing to the reign of his word in jesus name shall we pray father lord i lord commit myself before you are this time for this short moment of testimony lord i pray o god that you take a hold of my mouth my thoughts let them be turned o god to your own father because i am nothing be merciful to us oh god and father lord to them they are out there listening at this moment father oh god may the mind of christ be revealed to them let a holy spirit that wrote this word reveal itself to the heart of every predestined seat of god father we thank you lord and we bless you at this time and we know that your power we reign in this convention we know oh god that your holy spirit will reign in this convention lord that at the end of it all the sick will be healed there will be a great gospel manifestation of the word of god spoken into reality and in power and demonstration granted you of our father we thank you for the host pastor we thank you god for all the ministers and lord those that we minister here and those we now minister father we thank you for them out there even in the hoco lord that are watching this meeting now we pray holy spirit lord to take up slow control and take glory to thy self in jesus fighting and we pray amen praise god amen so i have just a little to tie to my testimony and that is the hour of us to be manifested back to the healing of god the hour of us amen the hour of us you and us believe us in christ jesus to be manifested again to the healing of god hallelujah i have a subject my subject is keep your eyes on that elijah of malachi 4. keep your eyes on that elijah of malachi 4 and for inspiration from hebrews 38 amen i just want to quickly draw your attention to this because jesus said in the scripture we're right here let the mind of that mind of christ be in us and when jesus came he didn't come with his own mind he came with the mind of god and that mind of god happens to be what was his mind and here in philly philippians and he was also telling us the things the same thing he said let this mind be in you which was also in christ jesus amen jesus didn't come to fulfill whatever he feels he wanted to fulfill he came to fulfill the will of the father and that is what the bride has also come to do has manifested the sons of god we have come to fulfill amen the mind of god now listen very closely here i have a word i want to read from these message titled identification the prophet preached in 1964 march february 16th amen here the prophet was saying something very spectacular amen and he asked a question and then he said just like you are looking at me and i'm speaking imagine christ standing here he was a man he came in the image of god was the mask of god and the prophet was saying here now what if god stood on the platform today and said what is required of a christian then where would we all be see the character isn't expressing itself now you see hear your prophet and he said his mind was to stay with the father's word their mind was the same mind that was in them was to be in us and if his mind is in us we will do like he did somebody say if his character is in us we will be as he was is that right amen all the prophets had that we know we took think about talking think about nuance how he did in his day moses how he did in his day daniel in his day the hebrew children and so forth the word most god's character to us and anything that is tried to be mixed with that character breaks the mood you can't mix creed with word amen you can't mix the world with the word jesus said you can't serve god a mama mama means the word you can't be one or the other if you love the world or the things of the world the love of god is not even in you is that true then you see you can't mix it you can't mix oil and water it just won't mix praise god to me and that is how it is today you can meet this bride with a church denomination you can mix this bride with all kinds of principles not even the message the word you can mix it with anything denominational or whatever you think praise god amen and therefore this bride is being called to manifest just that pure word and we are here today because god had had us as attributions of god taught in his mind before the foundation of the world and we were made expressed and he had waited to see us being expressed and our sons of god we had to manifest his character praise god remain and that character had to be the expression of the life zoi's life which is the life of christ eternal life and that is what's supposed to be manifested in us praise god amen therefore god identified himself as we are he took his strengths what he was his strengths as god and stretch his tent down here and become woman he made himself a tent a body to live in and that body is known as jesus god lived in christ see he become woman in order to save us and he took our and he took away upon him our form that he might mold in us his character amen therefore and his character was he he did everything that pleased god and he stayed with the world that's what he wanted us for we would stay with god's word find our place and then know where we were stay with his word and think of it we are invited to shape our own character to his now we are going to find out what we have done shape our character to his own by his own spirit then we by him are sons of god just what eyes i have expressed by having his mind in us to shape our character to his his mind let the mind that was in christ be in you if that mind is in you then you see you become manifested sons of god [Music] praise god praise god how many appreciate our brother this morning today those words of greetings and encouragement god bless you my brother we appreciate you we love you amen blessed be the name of the lord just raise your hands and close your eyes amen glory to god i need you lord right now thank you jesus oh glory to god you just talked to him right now hallelujah i need you

for easter i want to appreciate the pastor and all the brethren at the entire church in the board of the church and associated ministers who had offered me this privilege to be of service to god's people and maybe somewhere along the line we can be of a blessing we trust that christ the the resurrected christ uh will rise in our lives and with the earth when of god rise to melt out all that the winters of life are frozen in our lives in the name of the lord jesus christ god bless you i feel privileged and i'm happy uh to be in the midst of god's people in the ivory coast and by extension all over the world god bless pastor paul and all the saints god bless you all if you don't mind may we just rise up for the reading of the scriptures if you have your bibles with you i like to read from two passages that look disconnected both they are very good for history and if you bear with me it will it will get clear as we go along amen my first scripture is in the book of luke chapter 24 luke chapter 24. i'd like to read the first 12 verses and i'm also going to read from the book of ephesians chapter 5. luke 24 verse 1 to 12 and then we shall go to the book of ephesians chapter five amen now upon the first day of the week very early in the morning they came onto the sepulcher bringing the spices which they had prepared and sat in others with them and they found the stone rolled away from the sepulcher and they entered in and found not the body of the lord jesus and it came to pass as they were much perplexed there about behold two men stood by them in shining garments and as they were afraid and bowed down their faces to the earth they said unto them why seek ye the living among the dead amen i think we need to answer that question again he is not here but is risen remember i will speak unto you when it was yet in galilee saying the son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men and be crucified and the third day rise again and they remembered his words and returned from the serpoca and towed all these things onto the eleven and to hold the rest it was mary magdalene and johanna and mary the mother of james and other women that were with them which told these things unto the apostles and their words seemed to them as i do tales and they believed them north then arose peter and ran onto the sepulcher and stooping down he beheld the linen clothes lit by themselves and departed wondering in himself at that which come to pass amen ephesians chapter five ephesians chapter 5 i'll read from verse 21. uh 2 verse 30 32 submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of god wives submit yourselves unto your own husbands as unto the lord for the husband is the head of the wife even as christ is the head of the church and he is the savior of the body therefore as the church is subject unto christ so let the wives be to their own husbands in everything husbands love your wives even as christ also loved the church and gave himself for it that he might sanctify and cleanse it with a washing of water by the word that he might present it to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish so ought men to love their wives as their own bodies he that loveth his wife love it himself for no man ever yet hated his own flesh but nourisheth and cherisheth it even as the lord the church for we are members of his body of his flesh and of his bones for this cause shall a man leave his father a mother and shall be joined unto his wife and there too shall be one flesh this is a great mystery but i speak concerning christ and the church may the lord add his blessings to the reading of his holy word god bless you you may be seated this moment if the lord will be our help which i trust he will i would like to speak on for this easter a subject i called she is risen she is not here i'm mindful of the scripture that we read that the scripture did not exactly say she is risen she is not here the person who testified the angel who testified to those who were so concerned about the lord jesus christ did not use the word she is risen did not use the word she is not here the angel used the word he is risen he is not here but you see my use of she is and she is not here is not a sacrilege it is also the scripture and it is the hidden thought behind the statement of the angel because christ cannot be risen and his body remained in the grave did you catch that for there to be a personality the earth and the body must be together so if you are lying on the bed and your head raises the resin of your head raise your body and the head will not be able to move anywhere without the body even when the head eats the food do you know chewing and eating is from the edge you didn't catch that where do you eat from you use your mouth to eat where is your mouth located so am i speaking right eating is from your head but you see whatever you eat the destination it's your body until it gets to the body it does not do your entire being any good so these two these two units are connected together and you cannot they are inseparable connection until you see christ and his bride like that you will never be able to understand your life don't view christ's body as his you know his physical person in terms of redemption christ is the edge and you are the body whatever happens to the edge affects the body the edge may conceive many things to do but it is the body that actually implements it amen that is why the earth cannot move about without his body so if christ actually was risen then his body rose if christ was dead his body died if christ was buried his body was buried the prophet of the lord said christ took you in him to the cross of calvary so we were melt with him on the cross when it declared it is finished it was our statement that christ was echoing hallelujah because christ not has no other body than your body and mind now your friends you look at me amen what am i touching my head what am i touching are they just are they different do they share different complexion except i'm bleaching amen when you see people who are light all over your fanta color in their head and maybe coca-cola in their body something is wrong the body and the head usually share the same complexion because the body is recovered something it might look fresher than the one under the heat is that right but they are still the same complexion because the body and the edge are inseparable so and the prophet said christ went with his body to the cross of calvary he went with you inside of him so you were identified in his death you were identified with him in his burial and you've got to be identified with him in his resurrection [Applause] when christ rose and he said all power is given me oh man he was testifying of his church if christ has all the powers then the church has all the powers because whatever christ has all mine the inheritor of christ is his bride the bible said all that god was according to christ all that christ was he put into the church so this bride will be word of his words life of his life power of his power manifestation of his manifestation this bride will be him if you are looking for christ today you can only fight him in his body amen because his body on earth represents his physical presence and that is why what christ did this body will do and it will be so natural for them to do it they wouldn't have to struggle to do it that is why this body doesn't look for signs science follows this body because they are the believers and the scripture that spoke of them says these signs shall follow those that believe in my name they shall cast out devils they shall take up deadly things which do not hurt them they will lay ants upon their sick and they will recover if christ their ex did it they will do it there is nothing that can stop that manifestation because it's a concluded program of god enjoy your inheritance this is why all you need to do is to come to the realization of who you are don't struggle to get power you're already in power did you hear me church don't walk up manifestations you already have it in you you cannot manifest christ for this hour you cannot but demonstrate the power of god in this hour it is your inheritance it is your buildup it is your chemistry it is your makeup don't look for it it's already in you come to who you are and you will do the greater works you love him this morning in the message it is the rising of the sun the prophet was describing this and he said the same word that spoke of the groom speaks of the bride so if the word spoke of the groom and said he is not here it is risen then i can on the authority of these statements that have matched and these statements of the prophet say she is not also here because the same watch that spoke of the groom speaks of the bride amen the eating thing behind that statement is that it was the bright that god had in mind this is why if you watch the easter the last easter the prophet celebrated it wasn't the easter of the resurrection of jesus christ he called it it is the rising of the sun in church he said i want this easter to mean more to you than any easter you have ever heard hallelujah because before that time we were celebrating historical easter but we must bring history to living tense we must bring history to present tense hallelujah there is that the prophet was celebrating in the message it is the rising of the sun was the easter of the bride not that of the bright groom that was why in that message he said the whole idea of redemption is what easter stands for and that redemption idea is between the e and the sheep hallelujah so in as much as we have observed this far that you know christ had risen christ has risen we must come to a point that the risen christ what did he rise for and the prophet was demonstrating it in various ways he took it back to the shift waving in the beginning in the old testament he said when a farmer plants his vineyard or his plantations his farms and nearing the time of harvest he will be looking for the first of that plantation that will mature the first of that plantation that we mature is avested in many cases not for eating but for a symbolic celebration amen because it's to be taken to the high priest or the priest to do what to do the feast of shiva waving which is a time to pray for the rest of the harvest and to celebrate in advance so faith has to be connected and to celebrate in advance the adverts of those ones that are yet to arrive with a message that just as this one became ripened the other ones will also come that is the feast of shiva waving hallelujah and the prophet of the lord said christ was our worship wave christ was the first that much watch it was the first one from among the dead it was the first one that came up signifying there will be more of christ there will be more of resurrection there will be more of manifestation he said this is the reason he said greater than this shall you do he said we aren't going to do anything greater than what he did but the right language is more of this in that it was just a single unit doing those things he's going to bring his body which is many members doing the same thing so where christ did one is many members and millions will do millions is taking place here is taking place there if the first ship that was with was accepted is a sign that more will come so the devil cannot stop it sickness cannot stop it death cannot stop it antichrist program cannot stop it don't disturb yourself with those things they are not powerful enough to stand in the way of god because this is god's program god will have a blight and that blood will be without spots it will be without wrinkle it will be holiness unto the lord because the first place was holy the first groom was holy it was pure amen he said the prince of this world came to me and find no fault satan find no fault his agents will find no fault the prophet said this end time bride the body of that groom will be a sinless virtuous bride of jesus christ because the righteousness of their bridegroom is their covering oh glory to god when you know these things you will know christianity is a rest how many are resting it is your season and him walking hallelujah i feel good this morning and we haven't even started but let's feel good about these blessings it's good for a background i'm saying that which applies to him applies to you amen this is why when the blood appears which is you and i i'm not talking of the future bright that bride is already here many the prophet said the problem of man is that they will thank god for what is done looking forward to what he will do ignoring what he is doing amen the perfect bread has got to be now now you are talking of the rapture rapture cannot come without perfection of the bride and what it takes to bring perfection to that bread has been given oh glory to god the prophet said ezekiel saw us in prophecy amen and he saw a valley full of dry bones it might have been fulfilled in the life of israel in one way amen because ezekiel lucia they were saying the same thing you know bringing revival after two days after 2000 years amen there will be you know there will be a nation of israel again which by the grace of god we have seen but the reviewer for the hour brought ezekiel prophecy to the bride of jesus christ and the ezekiel was asked god showed him amen the valley full of dry bones and then he was asked amen can these bones live [Music] in other words will there be another revival will there be another shake amen after such a dryness isn't this the age of dryness isn't this the age of apostasy isn't this the edge of famine isn't this the edge of thick darkness can these bones live can there be another revival will there be a revival of the just will there be a manifestation of him who wants to walk on the streets of jerusalem will christ be lifted out of history oh man and ezekiel said i don't know only god know it hallelujah you see but the revival of that bones is not up in heaven he's right here on earth god was going to use a prophet amen and in that vision ezekiel types the prophets oh church are you here god did not speak directly to those bones are you here church he told the prophets to prophesy is the ezekiel professor then the prophet called our attention he said it takes the prophet to prophesy it takes the prophecy of the prophet to bring life to the dead bones for the dry bones to put flesh on them to put senior on them to put energy on them to put life in them hallelujah for them to rise up like a mighty hermit oh gosh there will be another revival there will be a revival of the just missing limbs are going to be restored it is just here the lord my brother will have need of rain i'm going to give him it is just here the lord the needs of the blood will be met among the bride it is just here the lord and even right now because another type of us is ruth that in this hour before the great manifestation which the greatest of manifestation of ruth was to reproduce the savior on two feet before that manifestation root was given and full on purpose ruth was not abandoned those and full will solidify your faith those untruthful will give you a quick name that is why right now engineers are disappearing with that answer being restored the death years have been unstopped the debts are being raised alive and blessed are those who are not offended in me for those who are doubt us we can tell them go tell john go tell this one missing lips are being resourced god is sending rain not even by prayer by spoken words in this last days amen children are being spoken into the wombs of god's children even the seas have been taken away you also just happened here two months was spoken out of existence by the word of the lord hallelujah why are those things happening the roots of this hour must know that our christ our savior our lover our head isn't a miss and all this we gradually build up they are gathering momentum they are gathering momentum it doesn't matter leave them alone they are gathering momentums they will build up to such a statue to search and hide unto this body will not be able to contain it and it will burst forth into glorification and we shall live here ever to be with our christ ever to unite physically and permanently eternally with our bridegroom the head and the body coming together this is the program of easter god bless you church [Applause] i love this he takes the words of the prophet he said he said hezekiah prophesy god didn't speak to the bones directly in these last days god spoke to us but we felt through his mouth the mad peace of god is the prophet of god amen behold i send before you elijah the prophet when the prophet was speaking about that blight in the message it is the rising of the sun he said didn't the bible promise that bride to return in order to come to manifestation by malachi 4 and that is in line with ezekiel's prophecy of

to set the prophet search did you hear me we are happy to say the prophet said we are happy to appeal to the wedge for anything we want to do because it takes that prophecy to give us life if we give us life in our marriages in our homes in our churches in our businesses in our work in our studies in all that pertinent unto us it is the prophecy of the prophet that we live by [Applause] hallelujah you love him this morning let's just rejoice and be happy and express because this is your history it could be for a child however impossible you think it is my brother that child received life it received a change of gene change of cells because only believe all things happens [Applause] in the recent missionary missionary trip to bielsa amen the people were told to believe god after the finish preaching after the man of god finished preaching after i did he said he just went to consolidate amen and they consolidated not quite long and he came back again and said brother they'll come and pray for the people then i said okay i went behind the pulpit the people who wanted to pray as such to the altar there were many i realized it's going to be impossible for us to have a prayer line like that and i want a harmony of the spirit so i said lord what do we do then the lord spoke to me he said tell them to lay hands upon each other oh so that took away every discordance amen tell them to let somebody was telling me later that when i said that oh he felt it we're coming grace you know a welcoming spirit just felt so good because he felt that that was what we needed as a le i said how many of you believe i said now you don't need my hands or the hands of any other person as much thinking is better than your own hands i said the provision the the the the the requirement for hans lane is if you believe then i gave them a testimony of a sister who fed led to pray for another sister who was by her side and when that leadership wouldn't leave her she requested of the sister and yet there was a prayer line going on she requested of a sister can i please pray for you i'm just feeling that hush in my heart and the sister submitted and the other sister laid upon this sister amen we've got to be in harmony of the spirit and when ill she let and upon that sister that condition disappeared but she never knew she came to the prayer line anyhow and when she got to the prayer line and she got to the prophet the prophet was ready to pray says the start you don't have anything any sickness again on that discernment and the prophet was looking around and say yeah there i caught it he said just a little while ago this sister [Music] he said sister stand up you felt a leadership that was god speaking to your heart to pray for this sister and you yield it to the spirit call he said let me turn to this sister he said the moment she led and then prayed for you your sickness disappeared then brother brown said you don't need my prayer he just asked a blessing and he told her to go how do you think about that amen and i said if you believe lay ends on one another and they led ants on each other and there was a brother in there who are the problem with this tricycle and the part that was going to be considered for his economy is great then he said you know he said i don't know what to do is that now they are laying hands upon me but this is my need and i said raise your request before the lord as you lay hands upon each other and i pray over you and when we finish that prayer amen he went to the tri-cycle the church dismissed he went to the tricycle he tried to start the engine it was expecting the symptoms the symptoms never came the things that appear he said it just mattered the words the lord have been prayed for and i believe the prayer of your servant do something then for a testimony to clear his doubt he went to the mechanic the next day and said that thing helped me check and the guy said what did you do what happened to this he said this thing is now okay you don't need to replace it any longer this thing is now okay the brother ran back to church the next day is that i haven't read all testimony [Applause] church is still the same god if you could replace a carburetor and replace whatever it was alternator in that tricycle it can replace jeans [Applause] he can replace anything he's still in that same business then another minister who have not been able to function for 10 months it became invalid he said ahead of the meetings i struggled to come he said as the people i stay with i'm almost like a liability to them he said but after that prayer i got up i danced i wrote i said he said that the devil told me the devil told me it is momentary it is momentary he said okay don't worry whether you think is momentary or not is spoke back to the devil is that this blessing of mine you aren't going to take it from me [Applause] if you say it is momentary i haven't done it in 10 months and i could do it now whether momentary or not i accept my healing then he went that night to go and lay down he said i went that night to lay down and in the morning because he always could not get up by himself they have to support him and things he said in the morning when he woke up the thing come back he said you see that is momentary now he said it's a lie then he said he just felt that that's such that good feeling he raised up he got up he bounced and he said since that time i have been bouncing only believe all things what do they accept the prophecy of the prophets you love him church he said hezekiah will this bulls leave it's a down rest ah if i know if i'm the one who knows then i'm gonna put my word in your mouth he says he can speak prophesy to these bones he gave him what to say and ezekiel began to say and the bones began to vibrate are your bones vibrating [Applause] hallelujah the bones began to vibrate and by the spoken word flesh came hogging to hogan sinew came the organs came the blood came the water came and reformed the the bones began to form until it formed to a man and those bones rise up by the prophecy of the prophet they rose up and ezekiel said i saw a mighty heaven this church is a mighty heaven amen what are we to do what is our commission the prophet said satan's army are commissioned to put sicknesses and affliction in our bodies but god's army are under commission to do what to cast them out we shall fulfill our commission we will cast them out the prophet said the list of the believers among us this morning has got the devil under his face hey hey hey okay let me prove it to you if you imagine this morning that you are not the hair if you imagine this money that you are not the stomach if you imagine this morning that you are not a palm if you think you are the soul of the feet of christ amen just think about that are you the soul where is the ground still under the soul did you get it can this ground rise above your soul did you guess it so whatever you stamp it's under you when the devil stumped down the devil even if you are the soul you are still on top of the devil so i said this morning the list of the believers has got the devil under him as god's sicknesses disease and affliction under them don't accept the package return to the sender because it is your heritage to condemn every tongue that speaks against you sons and daughters of god rise up and manifest for who you are [Applause] [Music] hallelujah we are no longer dead we are no longer a slave to sin amen once upon a time we were under him and he was running us up and down as he wished and as a desire but that day on calvary [Applause] what a day on calvary what a glorious day it was we are in our hedge pronounce it is finished and the body agrees with it because wherever the head goes the body follows hallelujah if the head entire place and his body cannot go what does the boy head do he goes back did you catch that that's a revelation to using meaning that there will never be a place the head will get you that his body will never be there christ is the head yeah and you are the body so whatever ground christ has claimed it is your inheritance you claim it with him when he said it is finished that was meant for you that was why the graves couldn't hold abraham [Applause] three things took place in three different dimensions you want to hear it it will help you to hear it in heaven on earth and underneath come on george let's start from under the moment he said it is finished the bible said the earthquake and the graves of the saints not the grave of everybody the grave of his own body is coming for his own the graves of his own body were opened open for what preparatory to resurrection the reason they were held down was because the author of death the one who was the king of death was responsible for this prescription that produced their physical bodies it produced the physical body to die this is why you will never need these bodies in eternity whatever happens to this body don't care there will be no blind mind no deaf man no leprous man no invalid in the hallelujah square [Music] [Applause] it will be a perfect body [Music] spoken into existence not by sex god is going to bypass sex to reproduce you back that is why you will never die and you will never ever grow old this body grows old as a symptom of death so when you are celebrating birth day amen say i'm getting older you actually celebrating death when you come to eternity it will be one long birthday it will just be one day amen are we together so when the saints died from genesis to malachi even to the coming of christ before the cross certain exercises authority over their bodies because he was responsible he had a contribution in the way that body was formed did you get that that is why sisters the prophet said don't glory in this your healthy body and don't be self-conscious and admiring your beauty because the shape you had married was inspired and given to you by satan and that is why if you don't meet god you will be more an instrument that will send more souls to earth than even bear then even be a joint amen so this is why you must come to christ and make no delay you see what is polluting the edge today it is all about sex is that right church you see it on the billboards you see it everywhere you see it in conversations at least they talk so freely on vulgar things today they are they are crossing the boundary they don't really feel is a big deal and they are promoting it you don't even have to know the person if that's what he wants if that's what you want you can go for a casual outing and never see yourself again let me tell you this world will bomb more than sudo is a satan's even every programs even for teenagers are becoming sexual watch what your children feed on we know the devil is running ring around us they hardly can do the assignments do their homework do the education without internet again without form without high pass but you've got to be alive as a parent i'm telling you because beyond that they also want some entertainment and the way they get entertainment is by their peers have you watched greenwich have you watched this one have you watched friends forever have you watched those nonsenses they don't need it the prophet said is going to blast their minds before they even get started that is why sin must be killed from its infancy this is why joshua never spared the children of the amalekites jebusites as babies as they are oh man is that they don't even have teach yet but the prophet said remember when they grow up they will be like their daddies kill sin before it has a chance and if you are talking your head in such evil to pornography you better repent because you are destroying your value you are destroying your conscience you have destroyed your morality you are destroying your spirituality you haven't destroyed your psychology everything is all losses are no gain repence [Applause] hallelujah so satan holds that key the day you hit thereof that day you die hallelujah so immature amen he has the key of death and that was why he was so bold listen to me church when moses died god was going to preserve that body amen satan was so bulged to come and confront the messengers of god i said my friend i i own that body i'm quoting your bible i'm quoting the scripture hallelujah he said it was disputed about the body of moses why was it disputing moses was a saint amen but by the power of death satan has a right to the dead body common church and he's got a right to lock them up and god cannot refuse him that right you know why because the real penalty for sin the price for it has not been paid the blood of god's bulls and lambs are only a cover they cannot actually remit they cannot restore you to your position so why that was waiting and satan knows is right he said give me that body god said no i take an exception yes sir i need this one i take an exception this is why he couldn't dis he couldn't dispute the body of elijah because he didn't die did you catch that it didn't dispute the body of enoch because he didn't die they went straight but if they died it will come like he came for moses because until that time he owes the power of death he will tell you i killed them they are my spoils if an hunter goes for hunting and he kills the game whoson is it church answer me is a practical simple exercise so one of the things god must take is the powers of death from satan if he's going to have a right unto his own people the only way satan would not be able to have had the right was if they never died so enoch went he didn't fight elijah went he didn't fight but when moses went and god wanted to keep the body he said no but you see the master must prove himself he said let me tell you even though you have that power i take exception to this no this one has a work to do so you got to leave him for me he said no then the bible said while disputing and contending micah did not bring a railing accusation ah church can we learn from that can we learn from that no matter no matter what a level of dispute or misunderstanding it gets don't use bad language did you hear me don't use unkind words don't use vulgar languages it does not belong to christians it is the unbeliever that abuses it is the unbeliever that curses amen michael never used foul language he said he never brought a railing accusation don't get under pressure to use wrong languages and you say let me tell you when you are converted those things eases out this is like christianity life is not a struggle you hear brother to brother having a conversation around the world and the next thing you a devil you are a serpent you are a liar you have this and that don't bring railing accusation even michael the arc anger never brought it on satan as satanic as he is not to talk upon your brother but your language will never be right until you are converted this is why the prophet said if you come if you become bitter about a misunderstanding he said you need the altar he said i never disagree with people except on the basis of the better enlightenment of the world and if it is on enlightenment of the world who can enlighten a man better it is god meaning what i need to do is to create the right atmosphere for god to come on the scene either help my brother or help me don't ever get on the bad end it is not christianity hallelujah so he held them under the powers of death abraham and all the rest where else that when jesus declared it is finished the grave quickened quit what happened the graves were opened by preparation for what resurrection the grace that have been opened amen the occupants of the grave are under the captivity of the devil the only thing god disagree is to put his own in the common prison house of death they must stay in the vip section that is the paradise that then was you know in all these correctional centers there are vip sections so they put all the saints in the vip section so christ was interested in that key because his own we are under captivity and luck of that key so right underneath christ went down he said i'm here satan where's the key hang me over the key he said which key you think i come here for joke satan said wait let me share testimony with you when i killed abel i thought i got you but i missed it then i killed abraham i killed this i killed that i killed isaac i killed a zika even to malachi the last prophet i thought you were the one but now i'm happy at last you are here the the lord said maybe maybe you will have time for your testimony later but right now it is not a testimony time you see this business i'm doing i have a timeline i must be i must finish everything under 72 hours so if i must finish it under 72 hours i cannot accommodate your testimony what i came here for is the key forget about you killed everybody everything you killed i want to release they must come back to life everything you are holding under your hand today not tomorrow even now even right now did you catch that even right now if you are under the bondage of the devil in any form by the finished work of cavalry you are loose [Music] in the name of jesus christ [Applause] [Music] he said which king said that key by which you lock them down amen the devil knows how to play the late tactics but christ wouldn't take that nonsense now my prophet told him if delta had kicked on him and before he could recover christ jack the key as i said this is a key off i go hallelujah off i go he peers through the realms of demons it peers through the graves hallelujah and he went into the approach of the descent and he began to knock at their door hello hello are you there who is that when he said abraham abraham said that man is back sarah come the one who said i will visit you according to the time of life the one whom i call the elohim my lord and my god he is here jesus told him he said abraham abraham come out with sarah you see we shall have enough time to tell the story but right now i've got a time limit and i need to wake up others he went to isaiah is that ha ha ah who is that isaiah come out ah that's the one i said for unto us for unto us as one is given ezekiel saw him as a wheel in the middle of the wheel hallelujah and all of them were coming out one by one and on the third day amen before the expiry of the third day right in the morning of the third day jesus christ resurrected and the bible said he rose with thousand times thousands you see that he couldn't rise without his body when he rose he rose with his body [Applause] [Music] hallelujah hallelujah that was symbolic if you say he has risen today he's got to rise with you amen otherwise there is no history glory to god and the bible said they rose and they begin to inspect jerusalem amen and then we are appearing only to those who shares the same hope who share the same prophecy who listen to the prophecy of the prophets hallelujah and they were here for like 30 to 40 days there will be one more time it will happen again all the saints who have gone down they will get up because paul told us all death where is thy sting oh grave where is the victory but thanks be to god how many can say that this morning thanks be to god thanks speak to god thanks be to god who gave us victory power over death power over sin power over disease power over satan power over demons thanks be to god it's a fear of good cheer i have overcome the world you live in the overcomers this afternoon you are more than conquerors because the conqueror conquered and he gave you the trophy so you were the one who sent jesus to go and fight satan to defeat death on the cross of calvary he was running your parents and when he had a victory he handed it over to you you are more than conquerors [Applause] [Music] hallelujah a wonderful insight will be for you it will be a resurrection of everything that the winters of life had killed a resurrection of everything that the winters of life are frozen anything dead anything frozen must receive life must thought out by the heat of the holy spirit because you must be the better for it in the name of jesus christ that's my prophecy for your lives hallelujah you love him then on the earth we have started from under let's come up on the head the bible says the veil of the temple did was rented into two and the renting was from top to the bottom is that right church from top to the bottom not from bottom up top to the bottom to let you know it was god who rented it hallelujah and what which veil was this it was the veil that separated the oldest of the holies from the middle court the outer court has no veil amen the middle court is it's a it's a shaded place amen but the oldest of the holy's was separated from all the courts by the veil and what is in the oldest of the holies the act of the covenant with that manner that can never decay inside and with cherubims on top of the heart covering signifying what christ did in hidden after men fell in mountain cherubims to gather to guide the part of the tree of life that tree of life is that undecable manner it is the lord jesus christ it is a revealed word it is the total revelation [Applause] and when men fell god mounted these cherubims with flaming swords to do what to guard god's departs so that man without proposition for his sin will not come back to eat life and eat life and become a rank devious sinner it will pollute it amen this reveal what this blessing is for sinners who are ready to repent if you bypass calvary to come and eat of the tree of life you will become an intellectual giant and you'll be a liability to the gospel ever learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth a make believer you will be because you will say amen to the world amen but you will never live the life of the wedge god does not want the word alone he wanted life by the spirit that is why apostle paul said the gospel was not preached to you only in watch but in the demonstration of the spirits [Music] we are not sweet talker we carry life whatever we testify to you will see it in our lives if our life cannot produce it no work done come on church so but that day when the veil of the temple rented those cherubims that were guiding the part of the tree of life they felt jobless they looked at themselves what we are guiding by the symbol of the temple has been opened by the one who employed us to guard so we have lost our job nothing to guide again and i can hear god speak to them no sir you haven't lost your job i am changing your job description will you accept the change and allow the cherubims to now walk on you is that before now i told you to chase them away but from today that's the uncovering with that same flaming sword go after the ones that you have chased away go after these brothers go after the sisters they are my body use the same sword to chase them inside the prophet said that is why in every service in one of the messages of influence the cherubims must be around and he gave us the scripture he said the angels of god encompass most of you who are always afraid use that scripture only for the night when you want to sleep he said let angel in capron department no sir it's a 24 hour scripture as we are here now that scripture is fulfilling how many fear the lord how many worship the lord how many are god's children angels of god and camp round about don't be afraid in the morning don't be afraid in the afternoon don't be afraid at night angels are watching over you when we go out when we come in in the here on the road in the sea on the rail under the water by the submarine angels are watching up because angels of god encompass [Music] when you know that you won't misbehave you won't embarrass the sight of the angels you won't want them to see filth you will do the right thing and right now here they are here the prophet said you may not see them but if you end the spirit you can feel their church this is why some of you are shouting him and this is why some of you got her this is where some of you are raising your hands what is that it is the talk of the angels he said you don't see them but you can feel their presence making you say amen making you rejoice at the world making your own god exorbitant expressions it is the charge of god's angel do you now realize why this end time cherubim was knighted with a sword aha aha he got that there are four living creatures is that right john saw them as living creatures ezekiel saw them as cherubims come on church and there are four of them with the face of a lion with the face of an hogs with the face of a man and with the face of an eagle these four are the closest to the throne they are the gods of the messengers after them is the 24 elders and so on and so forth so they are closer to the truth to see what is going on in the throne more than any being so they are the custodians of the tree of life are you catching it now in these last days we have the cherubims with the face of an eagle and that anointing came upon a man who found favor before god and we call him william braham i am not ashamed of the prophet whose prophecy we quicken dry bones [Applause] hallelujah it was his prophecy in more than 1000 messages that is quickening our dry bones putting flesh giving us identity and that message is going to raise us up as a mighty army to manifest for his glory is going to give us the revival of the just when they revealed what when the seven seals when the entire bible was to be opened because that is the tree of life hallelujah god told this cherubim in person to come to a mountain by the grace of god i visited that mountain with my wife it still has its allowedness for those who are believers amen because these are memorials that we never fade and he went on that mountain and he started praying instead because he didn't know why god told him to come there look friends this gospel costs the prophet of god a lot did you hear me church it cost him so much things god could have told him just in his house he would tell him go to a mountain we traveled from his house in arizona to mount sunset mountain it was more than three hours and god we ask his prophet go to that place until you get there i can't speak to you and the encounter might not be more less than 30 minutes and then we finish and drive three hours or four hours back again we drove in the solid suv we didn't get there until over three hours so about seven hours back and forth just to get a message for you come on church and somebody a backslider will sit somewhere and be condemning the message pity them because great will be their their punishment preaching them oh man and while he was praying on that sort of mountain that was closer to his house while he was praying all of a sudden he felt something in his arm boom and he had a loud voice as he beheld the king's sword a king knight a man with a sword the voice came back not a king when you say a king it would be a one among many there is only one the king there is only one the rock that's why when i sing that song jesus is the wrong i don't say a but this shade by day yes that's the only shade are you are you seeing jesus as an alternative to every other shade who can shed you better let's sing those songs with revelation hallelujah the hey the voice came back is not a king the king saw and while he was settling down to it the remarkable thing he noticed was that his unfitted perfectly the handle like it was made for him and actually it was made for ease and that is why today he is the only qualified one i don't care we either with respect or we don't due respect to any other authority he is the only qualified one to bring interpretation to the scriptures and the interpretation must run from genesis to revelation 1946 to 1965. don't just talk in the middle of the road revelation came to him progressively and that is the only way you will get it until you land in 1965 don't build a doctrine because that is what is keeping some of you stunted and making you to become a broken system if life has not stopped its traveling don't stop also oh glory to god what why was it nature with the sword right at the opening of the world is to use that sword to chase you back into the tree of life memorials that will never die so that happened on the earth can we go into glory now how many are ready to travel with me let's go into glory and we come to ephesians chapter five in glory this bridegroom has a picture of what he wants is bright to be uh-huh like i've severally told you when christ made his bride he wasn't in the shape yet of his reflection but it was determined to bring his bride to his reflection whatever state he met her is not going to discourage him this is what the bible said it wasn't until we became christians that he commended his love to us oh my you never did anything to impress his love you never did anything to attract or to gain his election his free will it is not him that we let it is not him that run it it is christ that showed mercy and i will have mercy on whom i will have mercy compassion or know my will and on whom we will if we withhold it say thank god for mercy what do you do for this mercy i will live a life of appreciation that's all you and i can do we never meditated we were not the people who pray the most we don't even go to church as much as some people but mercy rewrote all right god smells [Music] okay leave it at that leave me that ass when you talk of mercy you talk of amazing grace hallelujah will we an hopeless case avoid an empty space if not for grace he entered bar room to get some of you but as maybe prostitute come to get some of yours perhaps the gums of ruffians and hooligans to get some of us those places were filthy for christ to enter into but he had you in mind they were not filthy enough to keep him away as long as you were there while we were yet sinners god commended his love but he had a desire that no matter how this bride of mine looks i'm going to bring her up to speech she's going to become a glorious church say glorious come on george something glorious is adorable she's gonna become a church without spots without wrinkle did you hear that without one blemish and in order to get her to do that he must wash her with the water of what is wet did you hear that the water is his work which wedge by the way that's what we're going to close on because this bride must rise this bride cannot be found in some quarters which ways christ at a three-phase ministry i'm winding down now but you must see this don't forget the bible says the way christ is getting his bride is the way you and i get our bride i must quickly hurt that the bible said even us i will always repeat it to your hearing meaning that there is no difference in comparison of our christ god is bright live with his bride to the way you do yours so if you cannot marry like christ and relate like christ with your bride you are not fit to marry who can act like christ do you say why you need the nature of christ before you go into marriage are you here if god says take this for the new birth if god says if you don't talk like me if you don't smile like me gesticulate like me act or react like i do you will not make it and it makes me the standard do you know all of you are finished there are two ways to behave like me one is the counterfeit one is genuine the counterfeit way is to practice to imitate me is very stressful but you will achieve something even though it will not last you will practice some people have practice today like those twins to talk and behave like president our president that fair-skinned young man i may not know him if we talk like him he will try they say he even looks like him but you see when he's doing it he's only acting because that is not his real him unconsciously when they forget himself what will he do it will go back to himself so it's a struggle constantly to do like me you will practice you will sweat you will do everything but when you forget yourself you will behave like your real you because you know why it takes a nature in you to be you it takes a nature in me to be mean and that nature pilots your body effortlessly without you know effortlessly it's just your primary you just as you know that if you pick your foot even with your eyes closed it won't go anywhere else than your mouth see the ants already know the way of the mouth it's effortless it doesn't need to be guided this is your primary nature but for a christian its primary and single nature must be christ in order to act like christ so when you practice you can imitate but it doesn't last if you're under imitation this morning i want to call you to a higher life because imitation can be frustrating it will come to a time that you are switching between imitation acting and your real you amen and when you can get it separated you become frustrated and you say there's nothing to this christianity there's a whole lot to hit brother there's a whole lot to his sister but look at another way what if a portion of my nature is taken and they come to you do like a surgery to take out your own nature and put my nature in you by the time you wake up you would think like me effortlessly you will talk like me you will act like me you will act like me everything about my life will be primary and easy for you did you catch that this is what god wants and that is why he released the holy spirit because holy spirit is a portion of god's life is the life of god in a measure we are in christ as the fullness of god you are invited to take a measure of it amen whether it is a measure or a fullness it is the same character it is the same content it's like me going to the sea to take some sea water amen if i take a bucket of sea water i have the entire sea in a measure if you measure the entire sea water and you know and do a measurement of the contents of the one in the bucket it will be the same the same element the same chemicals the same thing but in a measure you need that nature of god in a measure to come into you then you can testify like paul it is no longer either liver so before you get married get the holy ghost it is the only way to marry like christ it is the only way to act as the blight of christ's reflection did you hear me it is the only way that no matter what happens you will remain a girl and son of god no matter what happen you will not go on a bad hand does christ beat his wife does he punch his wife if you want to be a boxer anthony joshua is there for you he's available to test your strange witch don't test it with your bride amen even if you lose if you can fight antoni joshua you will still collect millions so don't waste those energies go to the right quarters amen but if you carry the nature of god you will not do what christ will not do to his bride because the bible says even us christ will never divorce his bride no matter what happened amen is gotten up for good and for all time and the bible said christ loved his bride until he was willing to sanctify himself for all you and i you have a reflection of what you want your bride to look like isn't it the way she does things this some of you are so meticulous you have a way you arrange your table you have a way you arrange your books on the shelf slanted straight horizontal vertica and some of you are so meticulous the moment you enter the room you notice some you can tell you are that sensitive to know any change amen until your wife adapts to that your reflection you've got to have the patience of christ amen don't be a bully don't be an hyena those are not the content of love he said he loved his wife until he gave himself some of you when your husband when you're when you are coming home your wives are under tension anxious because she doesn't know what pleases you if she greets like this only welcome why didn't you say my lord if you say my lord why didn't you spice it with some romantic word by honey sweetheart you are never that one is so formal is a cake the same person you are just an impossible creator christ is not like that see what we've been showing whatever christ enjoys he gets it to the bride so he's right and i gave you just a simple experiment if the mouth tasted the body the stomach stole it but a lot of you you take care of yourself at the detriment of your wife shame on you does christ wait for you to tell your need before even supply he has the capacity and the nature to know the things you need the bible told me so he said take no thoughts hallelujah for what to eat what to drink where we shall we be clothed is that don't be anxious like the heathen for their heavenly father knows that you need those things isn't that the scriptures but she confessed the kingdom of god and his righteousness then all other things it will hurt some of you brothers you don't know the needs of your wife you stay in the same room you sleep on the same bed you don't know any you are not that concerned shame she has to ask he has to beg she has to preach and you think that is an advantage to show your lordship you are just taking advantage to show how a dictator you are swallow it and say amen [Applause] i have to say this because paul apostle paul was running a comparison he said this is a mystery and i speak of christ and his word bride you gotta love your wife and sisters because i'm saying it for the audience of the world and sisters you've got to come under absolute subjection that's your position can i hear him for that [Applause] no matter what you attain in life keep it at the door when you're coming and come reverently that man is your head amen don't marry a man who you cannot submit to because you must totally submit he is the earth you are the body the scripture use the word reference reference is stronger than respect are you hearing me reference is near worship amen so make sure you marry a son of god enough deserving of that for you because you must give it if you don't give it you are not in your position if you don't love your wife like christ will do until you can give your life for her you are not in your position is to show you the stretch of how much christ was willing to sanctify himself marriage sanctification is not justification sanctification but the ability to let go to come up from your lofty eyes amen and come so low to be able to bring your wife to your desire it will mean a lot of shaking than for you it meant for the lord jesus christ but he achieved it if christ's heart is bright glorious spotless without wrinkle you got to have yours to reflect your desire and that would be a perfect marriage hallelujah now as i close how did christ achieve it by the washing of the water of what is words which works let's go to heaven now and say the word that the uncalvary we've seen the ground we've seen on the ground we've seen what happened on earth we're going to heaven the bleeding lamp stood before the throne worthy that's when the four hell that said it was worthy the four living creatures said it was worthy even john when he came back to himself said it was worthy what is the lamb that was slain to take the book to lose the seals hallelujah revelations chapter five that's where we are now amen there have been an announcement from the throne can i go out for a few moments there has been an announcement from the tron who is worthy why was this announcement because the book that was in the end of him that sat on the throne was not meant to be resident in heaven it had always been on the earth that book was the title deed of the earth amen it was by it adam lived adam never needed any inventions to enjoy his earthly living because he lived by spoken word amen everything listened to heather that was taking his position as a son of god god make you the governor of this earth and you are going to rule you are going to reign that is the meaning of the manifestation of the sons of god we are coming back to his church when heard them has the right to die titled it he has that tattoo deed which gave him ownership not just the governance of the earth did you hear me that is why even till now don't get it in your head that you are going to spend eternity in heaven you are spending eternity on the earth because this earth belongs to us satan today might be the god of this evil age but tell him i say is an ordinary squatter he's not even dignified to be a tenant if he's attendant he'll be paying rent but scott has done parents they do i don't seek occupation so i cause satan is quarter it doesn't have the title here and it doesn't have receipts to show a patreon because the real land owner we are not willing to take filthy money from the ants of the devil he should keep his money away it should keep his rent away because whatever satan offers hallelujah it doesn't offer freebies it's a pleasure for a while and the pleasure for the world is to filthy for us that is why we will not accept his proposal we will not accept his temptations hallelujah are the children of god with me on this or you are yielding to the devil you are taking his carrot you are enjoying his sinful excesses those are his rents but we won't take it hallelujah so he will keep squatting until we are ready to take over why did he become his cutter when adam fell he lost the possession you know when satan saw somebody who could talk to the trees and trees will obey is if vedim was going in the midst of the garden and the tree had flourished and crossed his path it doesn't need an axe or a pruning fog if we just said mr tree adjust yourself i want to pass until we say oh governor and it will pass if adam got to the sea it doesn't need a yacht a canal a ship or anything it just keep walking and the sea will take an option the master is coming what shall i do shall i gather more gravity to suspend him while walking upon me and he will not sink or shall i just open up for him to pass through dry land it's flying over your head this is the message that will bring you the consciousness of that the prophet said when we fell we lost the consciousness of who we are but the time has returned for us to be brought back to it are you here don't let it fly over your head it is the truth that was why god gave you a moses amen whom did you open for and he walked on dry land he gave you a peter who walked upon the waters and he gave you a joshua who spoke to the son amen all those things are to show to you how it was in the beginning and give you appetite and faith for a return because it will happen again the prophet said now we pray very soon we shall be speaking because to us is the restoration of the spoken word the touch you did of god for this hour you love him so when he fell he lost the possession when lucifer saw that he was too jealous and envious he wanted that ability but he can have it so when adam fell he thought by that if we get the title but god brushed him aside and he took the title and he left for glory but as long as that title stay in glory we cannot take possession here our christianity will be what alone will be a bluffer and we have to take possession we have to manifest as the sons and daughters of god amen because the earth is groaning waiting for that manifestation they want to see us in the pre-genesis chapter 3 condition wearing everything is subject to the adopted sons and daughters of god are you here together come it will come friends so this was why heaven couldn't hold that book but to get that book the penalty of sin of what happened in genesis 3 must be paid so christ paid it on the cross of calvary oh before he resurrected he did a lot of things for you or not that was why his resurrection means so much to us amen because his resurrection was a seal that the work is indeed finished the rome put a stone on his grave and they put a seal on it to block the resurrection but jesus broke the seal the hinger came down broke the seal and he rolled away the stone every lid by which you are kept under by the finished work of cavalry is broken the stone is rolled away it was the same person who rode it away from the grave of lazarus he rolled it away from his own grave and today i roll it away even from your own life by the prophecy of the prophet in the name of jesus christ [Applause] you will have no limitation they said the sky is the limit we are going to fly beyond the vaulted sky amen we are going beyond all dimensions right into the mighty presence of god because the central resurrected within the sky was not their limit they broke beyond the sky they broke beyond the blues they broke beyond all the heavens and they went straight into the presence by the captain jesus lift your gate and let the king of glory come in who is this king of glory the lord mighty in battle he is the king of glory they could testify of his identity because they enjoyed it you can testify of the identity of christ by what you enjoyed of him you will enjoy him as a savior as a redeemer as a healer as a deliverer in all his redemption abilities you will enjoy that blessings they are yours the bleeding land stood and proved to be worthy and it took the book amen you see because no one was worthy john was crying do you know that was you you were represented as john in the book of revelation you sounded hopeless you sounded empty you think you wouldn't make it but thank god for the elders you were so caught up in your sorrow until you didn't even see the intervention but thank god for the elders the job of a true elder is not to tell you what christ will do is to show you what christ has done and by the preaching of the gospel take away your doubt so you can rise up and receive it the elders called unto john john whipnot amen look the lamb has prevailed not that he will prevail he has prevailed everything christ wanted to do for you he has already done by his tribes you are healed the chastisements of your peace has already been placed upon him so nothing can tamper with your peace nothing can happen with your joy all things are yours this morning those who may follow you he cults you are here this morning because he called you those whom he called him justified he sanctified he predestinated to be confirmed for abduction even your adoption is a finished work i say it all things are yours all you need to do is to only believe then all things will be possible the lamb took the book the bible said it prevails to take the book and to do what and to lose the seals because if he took the book and never lose the seals no job done because i'm trying to test them to trace the watch that washes you that makes you glorious without spot without wrinkle there are so many words in the land amen there are theological wars there are denominational wars but there was one particular word of ease that must produce the blight of his reflection that's what i'm treating for you john rejoice amen until heaven and earth stopped that is your joy there when the lamb took the book when he took it in revelations 5 in revelation 6 it started opening if you never opened it you will never be better than a denomination that thought first ministry of jesus christ is on the first two faces elin and disarmament couldn't produce the bride swallow it swallow it regardless of carnal theologies you have been taught and let me tell you that wasn't the shout god started the message rapture amen the shout came in the heaven in time the prophet said the messianic discernment and the healing by the ants they are all concluded as healing service they are signs behind their voice but the voice must come the signs attracted all manner of people all manner of congregation from among whom is the bride but those signs cannot i couldn't identify the bride just as the crowd was with the lord jesus christ when he was healing the sick raising the dead giving them bread five thousand years four thousand years mighty great campaigns hallelujah but do you know the identity of the bride among those crowds no sir until they began to sound his message except you heath my flesh you drink my blood no life in you a lot of people went back after all the bible has said they were not following him because of his words they were following because of the miracle of bread and signs and wonders science seekers are still doing the same thing today that is why they will make you try to think that there is no move no revival in the bride i don't know what a greater revival could be the reviver of the revealed watch that comes with its attendant manifestation if it is not happening in your quarters change house address because it's happening among the real believers you love him this morning the gospel is being demonstrated in manifestations not only in word alone it is the article of the believing church when jesus began to sound this message a lot of people took offense even the closer seventy left left with from among one was even the devil all the entire ministry of jesus christ on the day of pentecost couldn't produce more than 120 people at the upper room imagine that meaning some pastors even the apostles were more successful than christ in terms of gathering people amen but you know that's a mystery in itself because except the corner of this they accept the corn the seed of corn the corner of weight is buried amen it will abide by itself amen a lot of people were not meant to come until until after the dead burial and resurrection who are those people you the gentile bride hallelujah so when he was doing that so much crowd but when he began to sound his message the third face which the prophet called the deadpool the crowd left so also in this entire so the lamp started opening the seals which is the thoughtful the opening of the world in revelation 6 it was busy opening until revelations chapter 8 it completely word opened don't deny any of the seals opening because even from your scripture the bible said they were all opened what you can say is that what the seventh in particular opened to has not completely come to pass that is very true but we know what to expect from them because the prophet said 17 it's like a rocket that we blow air blood air blow here take so many things and bring the perfect picture of the scriptures are you here and they call it the end of time as long as we are in time we are still in the seventh seal it call it the end of the struggling world as long as we are still in the struggling world till we blend into eternity we are still in the seventh seal the prophet said i will speak about one fold of it the rest i will keep if he knew enough that there are three folds in the seventh seal it shows it's already opened amen if he's able to tell us one fold of it which he called the seven thunders it shows it's already opened if it wasn't open we wouldn't knew that much so don't deny the opening of the world if you want to be saved if you want to be redeemed if you want to be changed if you want to be glorious if you want to be unspotted if you want to be his bride of his reflection because it wasn't a close book that was delivered to john it will come to each the title this the book that it was opening is the same bible in your hand over three billion people among the seven billion people according to what statistics are christians who carry this bible whether that's fundamental or orthodox pentecostal different types of denomination and including the bride of jesus christ but to how many is this book opened they are carrying a close book because they have not accepted the prophecy of the prophet and it is the prophecy of the prophets that opened the book that put life into dry bones to make them a matching army for their manifestation i'm bringing ezekiel to the book of revelation 10 now by revelation 8 he had completed opening by revelation 10 is to does the mighty angel with what with the book opened can you say the language of the scripture are you saying your easter it wasn't for nothing that the bible has to specifically give specific details it didn't say with a book in his hand he could have said that it said with a book opened why was it opened because in revelation 6 to 8 it was busy opening by revelation 10 it has finished opening you caught that then he said but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when it shall begin to sound the prophet said not in the healing service so those of you who thought shout was just the first pull and second pull healing service you are confused the shout is the actual opening of the wedge and that takes oh my that removed the plank on the feet of those who felt it's another person who will come and reveal the word the prophet reveals the words the prophet wasn't the revealer it was the mighty angel amen taking over the ministry of the seventh angel of laodicea to reveal himself to the bride of christ are we here don't get confused there is no heath messenger anywhere and there is no other joshua than the lord jesus christ himself because he is jehovah's savior it is not the ministry of men that open their sails when the cloud of glory came down amen they are disputing it because it is our redemption you can take it away from us what was the testimony of the prophet about that ring of mystery it was our lord up there and when we turn it to the right angle which only god knows the right angle we can see the eyes of our lord the nose and the mouth of our lord what was he doing coming down amen in the ministry of the seven angels to give the commission for the open book christ was the seals that were opened it was the one that opened the seal it is not the ministry of a man it is a reincarnated ministry of the lord jesus christ but since he said he will not be here in his corporate body he must go through a man amen but this that man is not the one we are feeding upon amen because a man his word will fail the prophet and the message anointed once at the end time i was not the one that appeared at the ohio river i was only the person nearest hallelujah it was a present town near edmond sunset arizona mountain when the seven angels came down amen and when they were going back they left a memorial for us he was the only one near her to see the pillar of fire to even tweak an undisputable picture because it was taken by the critics he was the only one available to do it amen we don't see the pillar of fire except he chooses to reveal himself because somebody built him today is the most sensitive person to the supernatural he can tell you when he's around amen he can tell you when he leaves and when it please god by the camera of that critic it took his picture for us that we can behold that this is not a fable it is the hour of another calling out it is another exodus it is the how of another resurrection the mighty angel looked for his seventh angel and deposited the blessing to carry you to who to john of this hour he said i am not the one that appeared at ohio but i was the only person there you are not feeding on me because a man is what will fail but you are feeding on the unfailing body weight of the son of man apostle paul said that which i received from the lord the semi john was delivered with two with an open book he was given an open book and what is it to do with the open book this is your cleansing this is your purification this is your patch to glory hallelujah hallelujah laodicea rejected this when that full world was being given just as they rejected christ they rejected the message amen and the moment laudation pentecostal age who carried the prophet around the world seven times not with your money it was the money of united pentecostal assemblies of god for square and full gospel businessmen amen they were rallying around them as they rally around jesus during the healing service moment but when he began to sound his message because the ministry christ brought what the minister the prophet brought was the reincarnated ministry of christ solely for the gentiles as it was done to the jews and to the samaritan so the reaction the experience jesus art is what the prophet will have because the ministry was the same did you catch that so when they rejected it laudacian lust told the article to produce a bride lauda became dead amen now in the midst of that loudesia what the stars deceits the blood of christ something must be used to call them out and that is the voice that is the shout that is the opening of the world that has pulled you and i out so the angel can ask the people again this morning why are you looking for the living among the dead do you see why the prophet said i want this easter to mean more to you than any easter he said the easter of the groom was the resurrection of christ he said but if the head resurrected the body was also resurrected he said this last easter is the resurrection of his bride out of dark dead denominationalism out of dead laodicea into the glorious age of the bride god kept another economy because laodicea lost the article to mature you and to keep you alive laudacia became blind wretched naked miserable poor and on top of it amnesia they don't know it can the price be matured under such conditions the maturing brand must come out of that condition just as the exodus blight in the effects of us we're out of egypt by condition when there was darkness in egypt there was light in goshen is to show to you that a calling out is ready and when christ was ready to call us out it changed the condition we are in the laudacian age but we don't live by laudacian conditions god carved a new economy called the age of the bride while we are not blind our eyes have been anointed with eyesight and we can see we are clotted in his righteousness we are not filthy we are clean we are not poor we are rich we are not wretched we are children of the king we are children of dominion living a life of victory a life of possession and our eyes of understanding has been open at last so we don't suffer amnesia so we no longer live in love this year why did we come out in order to eat the open book for our manifestation amen enjoy your eating is this sweet to you as you are eating in your mouth is going to be sweet john was commanded to eat not to sympathize with it not to decorate his house with it but to eat it be glutenous about it friends because the hour is late eat as much as you could it will be sweet in your mouth when it gets to your belly it will be what bitter amen when is joy become your joy and your joy become his joy if you abide in me and my word abide in you the life that will come out of you will become a weep to the kingdom of darkness and there is going to be a reaction the prophet said there is a bitterness but you've got nothing to fear he said because john thomas professor the testimony of jesus christ is the spirit of prophecy meaning john you must testify you must give the living proof that christ is not dead but he is alive and the visible proof will beat the living world leaving himself out in you doing the same things that he did when christ was here that is our manifestation that is our blessings that is the glorious church without spot without wrinkle that is the church that has been washed by the water of his world which was the reviewer for the hour god bless you [Music] hallelujah oh just raise your hands and close your eyes praise god how many appreciate the lord
