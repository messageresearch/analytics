Bibles to Genesis chapter 22 wanna read verse 1 to 18 of Genesis up to 22 it's so good to be back here and see all of you out amen Genesis chapter 22 verse 1 says and it came to pass after these things that God did tempt Abraham and said unto Him Abraham he said of them behold here he said take now thy son thine only son Isaac whom thou lovest I like that get the internet and I'm not the one hit love and get into the land of Moriah off him up there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell the Earth's imam moussa did in the morning service and took two of his young men with him and Isaac his son cleaved the wood for the burnt offering Rosa went up into the place of which God had told him then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the place afar off and Abram said unto his young men a baggie here grass and I and the lad would go up yonder and worship and come down to you the Abraham took the wood the bull Doran lead upon Isaac his son he took the fire in his hand the knife went together both of them together and as I speak unto Abram his father and said My father he said yeah my my son he said Behold the fire in the wood but where is the lamb for a burnt offering and Abram said my son God will provide himself a lamb for burn offering so they went both of them together they came to pass the place where God had told him and even built an altar dearly the wood in order bound Isaac his son Liam upon the altar upon the wood and Abram stretched forth his hand took the knife to slay his son and the angel of the Lord called unto him out of heaven and said Abraham Abraham he said here am I he said lay not thine hand upon the lad neither do all anything of the em for now I know the doll fearest God seeing dogs not withheld thy son thine only son from me and Here I am lifted up his eyes and looked and behold behind him a ram caught in a thicket by horns if I'm went and took the RAM offering up a bullet offer instead of his son and Abram called the name of the place do-over Tyra as it is said to this day in the month of the Lord it shall be seen and the angel of the Lord called the Abraham out of heaven the second time and said by myself have I sworn saith the Lord for because that was done this thing and has not been held I son and only son died in blessing I will bless thee in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven as the Sun which is upon the sea shore and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies and in thy seed shall all nations be blessed because I was obeyed my voice may God bless His Word you may be seated who praise God this exhortation we push communion table and the title of that is because that was done this thing those words were spoken before because thou has done this thing the Garden of Eden man felt God say because that was done this thing you disobey my voice get kicked out that's what we agree here were people dying because I was done this thing but this is a different thing that was done here this was a man that was inspired by God you had inspiration to hear what the voice of God is man called Abraham and I choose to bring this as an emphasis because there's something that you have to do not because you have said this thing because you have done this thing because once it just reveals has to be tested once it reveal it has to be tested like 10 percent say Amen the others meditation of the food at 8:00 I don't know but once it has been revealed it has to be tested that's what God does he tests because he wanted best and the test brings out the best in you and I only the tester do that I want to say that again the tests bring out the best what if this students is who got no tests promoted from form 1 the form to the treat of water 5 what don't have money in their phone 5 what would happen in job market the tests filters the best from the rest the test the snack and the tests provide the cue to send the person to the higher level so as you pass this test of faith you could revert you mental knowledge then to temperance and patience and countenance there's every level of a test because one want the best at the top of it see it I'm not getting less Satan a delusion less than his best he has illusions best forces in this last day the challenge the bride two hundred thousand Thousand Devils coming loose against this bride don't have to lose his best also or glory to God so God bring the nobodies the people that they look like they are bright the people that have this condition that condition he chose you that you chose Gideon like it was just I don't pass and Samson like he told all them gurus of faith it wasn't looking like the people that were supposed to be but God made them it's not what you look at is what you have to become it's what you have to be designed into I love her and people study destiny but God I study destiny a lot of people really live for the know what God has study be under now that's right the words were spoken ever and blessing I will bless thee and multi-planar multiply thee and I see took my destiny talk about what is to come he's on top of what's in front Abram you don't want this become generations to come quad was prophesied about you since in Ezekiel days what was talking about you since then joy it is what was talking about you he was talking about you because he was

what it promised in the Bible and the next one we'll see him do it and you come around and try to do it and feel he would say why the scripture is not inspired to him he is only trying to imprison it he's trying to act like something hearing it recognizing as and acting upon it many will hear it but who recognize it so just you know the scene wait because they're not hearing it and recognized in it hallelujah if God takes I'm a young person five years old I'm speak to them I'm all dust and a lot anybody could know is good because you know the words come but I find the whole mode but that's what that's a gift that God could use and speak to a child's picture a woman or switches somebody and people who could I caught words but this is God speaking the only time and people do like is that what talk and this is what we speak to what this is God talking about talk about that donkey behind once the word coming up you know I don't speak so it doesn't matter who is behind here as long as the word you have to take it that's caught talking to me look what I'd end up tonight I'm a destiny so if the devil come and offer you something temporary no take that hold that hold that here that's

you stand for Christ regardless until something happened there is something a new hungering and move them like it was with Jacob you wrestle with the Lord you different after that something different

till one taken you better be that one that take or diligence is not inspire you to press this button brother I'm gonna close you this we should come up please short quick message by George but wonder how let's do it but he was shot today right all right we read this one before he talking about job do you have no Bible to read he went no need my inspiration and he only waited for the expression of striking he knew what he said what happened because it was an inspiration that's what the church if it is in order set in order it's got a mechanics ready it only needs them the dynamics tonight if we will get the mechanics ready so remember we talked about conversion the other day if you go to Mexico I'll convert the Mexican pieces you can use traina de la dia if we go to the King's Chamber Idaho seven steps if you want to get seven building materials to make the building it's not right so listen to this we talked my mechanics as word but this mechanics is bringing out very different he said not tonight if we will get the mechanics ready get our hearts right so when you convert all them world world would fix hot right I mean mechanics is ready oh boy we love God not doctrine right tick tick tick tick because huh fellas have right doctrine and wrong spirit you know so then you had a ask them off completely because this thing is a hat thing or all these things nothing you don't have some some some exams you'd have 10 points 10 points 10 25 50 points to this so then that is reexamine long time I saw which what see which had he moves among the points so when I see 25 25 I want to know if I get tens place value 50 pass already another five point here five paternalist I you know on top of that so if you want do is I'm smart a nervous to do by one two devices em coast and into a long time and I find five a five cents question a five percent question you but a long time and that's very time I know a twenty five twenty five percent would be lost that so my my my my objective was twenty five first twenty five first then go to tenth then go to write submission value to 25 X 59 60 I'm on my way to 19 okay the Lord a shock that's just a smart way of doing things not be overly intellectual number one number two nothing like that you're not going that way at all you're going smart that's why we call him twice version the smarter thinking different thinking differently okay the Lord our show the foolish virgins saying I just like you I belong to I could attach to other than store - OH - but the device which is a x-ray you see wise with two things that the foolish will not do the wise were coming to discipline the wise were coming to order the wise were coming to the mechanics definitely hot right you can follow every word Solomon baptism following every order you to do hallelujah you've come to service to prep the surface appear types of pale offering your country with the serving you're helping the church at all that you can do and then you're waiting for dynamics but when you know you're not doing all that you could do what dynamics is gonna fit for what did god telegram because no one's done this because parking instructions as to what to do and God will give instructions as to what to do so to bring oh there's something for you to do oh god bless you [Music] give a shout of praise fighting the angular team all the way [Music] we long [Music] don't you know I'm No Oh God left-handers [Music] Oh Oh No [Music] the doll going all the way I made my decision and um all the way who is out [Music] don't you get a lot of praise on free [Music]
