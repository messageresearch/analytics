morning lord for your grace your mercy your love your loving kindness lord what you have done for us that we could never deserve we could never earn lord we don't have the words lord we are here this morning at your mercy seeking your grace understanding the access that you have granted to us by virtue of this great gospel of truth that could look into the heart of the inner man and see who we are and in your light we stand naked in your presence so father we come this morning looking to hear a word from you may you take us out of the way lord lord not just take me out of the way but take us all out of our way because we are our own hindering blocks so father may you break our wills this morning and our desires and our lord our selfish motives and objectives that are not in alignment with you and may you get glory and honor to your holy name father lord we have so many needs here this morning lord needs for healing for a breakthrough for restoration for deliverance for the baptism of the holy ghost for joy to be restored for peace to be restored from our understanding to be opened father may you minister to your sons and your daughters may you mend the broken pieces of our lives father lord we commit this service into your hands we commit the reading of the word into your hands we commit this service into your hands both for those that are here the tabernacle and those connected on the internet father may you have your perfect will today in our lives we ask in the precious theme of jesus christ and the church says amen and amen you appreciate the worship service the song service this morning hey many many many man so i'd like to get straight to the wood in the interest of time this morning i'd like to go to three portions of scripture just to lay your foundation for us this morning reading from scene matthew thank you by anthony thank you musicians said matthew 7 romans 14 and 2nd corinthians 5. amen so reading from matthew 7 and reading verse 21 not everyone that see it unto me lord lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of my father which is in heaven many will say to me in that the lord lord have we not prophesied in thy name and in thy name have cast out devils and in thy name done many wonderful things and then will i profess unto them i never knew you depart from me ye work ye that work iniquity therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine and doeth them i will liken him unto a wise man which built his house upon a rock and the rain descended and the floods came and the winds blew and beat upon that house and it fell not for it was founded upon a rock and everyone that heareth these sayings of mine and doeth them not shall be likened unto a foolish man which built his house upon the sand and the rain descended and the floods came and the winds blew and beat upon that house and it fell and great was the fall of it and it came to pass when jesus had ended these sayings the people were astonished at his doctrine for he thought them as one having authority and not as describes reading romans 14 and verse 10 but why dost thou judge thy brother or why dost thou set at not thy brother for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of christ for it is written as i live say the lord every knee shall bow to me and every tongue shall confess to god so then every one of us listen here shall give account of himself to god our last reading from second corinthians 5 and verse nine wherefore we labor that whether present or absent listen why we labor we may be accepted of him for we must all appear before the judgment seat of christ that everyone may receive the things done in his body according to that he had done whether it be good or bad may the lord had a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated in the presence of the lord this morning i certainly want to appreciate the special service last friday what a blessing were you blessed amen and the service last wednesday and a special note about over last sunday as well we are we are really going through a real important time in our journey friends and i believe that this morning is no different god has something special in store for us so i have a title this morning but before i get into that i want to read uh just a testimony uh this is from sister ronda williams thanking god for his grace and mercy upon my life i've been in a backslidden condition for the past 21 years throughout this time god has kept me and blessed me even in this condition i have made a decision to come back to my lord and savior and serve him with my whole heart i am happy to be back in fellowship and looking forward to receiving the baptism of the holy spirit and total healing for my daughter shanika may the lord bless you surrender and may he grant that noble desire of your heart because that is a promise that's unto you and to your children including your daughter both for the holy ghost as well as for a complete healing can we identify with that this morning you appreciate the lord one soul that comes into contact with the kingdom is worth it all that is there's a reward for that it's a blessing for that that's why we are here hallelujah is for you and for your house and for those that are even on pharaoh so we thank god for that so in being conscious of time i do have a title this morning different kind of title but the title is what will you say to him and what will he say to you what will you say to him and what will he say to you and my subject the judgment seat of christ and my inspiration responsibility versus accountability the title is a striking title because it speaks of a conversation that takes place a conversation that starts with a question that is not defined in the title but whatever question is asked requires you to respond and the response is what you will say to him because he was going to ask you what have you done and you will have to respond and the question this morning is what will you say to him and then what will he say to you what will his be response to you so that's my thought for this morning when he asked a question what will your answer be how will you respond what will you say are you ready to answer him what will you say to him the scripture we read in matthew says to everyone that say it unto me lord lord shall i enter the kingdom of heaven and jesus goes on saying many will say to me in that day in other words they will be answering lord lord have i have have we not prophesied in thy name in thy name have cast out devils in other words there was manifestation and power and display of authority and what is said there is not enough to bring a favor of a response because the response in this situation is depart from me anybody with me this morning so we're going to build into that a little bit but i want to kind of take a little background and i want to go are we going to spend some time in luke 19 today as we build into this to look at it from another perspective so if you have your bibles just hold luke 19 in there we're gonna build through this scripture and teach this thought through this and connect it to the opening scriptures that we read luke 19 and verse 1 and jesus entered and passed through jericho and he amplified he says he entered jericho and was passing through and this is very notable to us because in the greek the word for joshua the way it's written and the word for jesus the way it's written is the written in the same way in the greek and by the random word type out the parallel as it were between the ministry of joshua and the ministry of the lord jesus christ it is interesting to note that the first great conquest that joshua had to deal with was jericho it is also important that at this point in jesus ministry we are just about one week away from the ending of jesus's ministry here in luke 19 and the last great city that jesus passes through before going into jerusalem is jericho anybody with me this morning so jesus this is this is at a point now just a while before this scripture we see jesus dealing with lazarus for a long time jesus had kept his ministry in secret in confidence he keep telling disciples tell no man don't tell anybody about it don't expose the magnitude of this thing but something changed when lazarus was raised from the dead they could no longer see it quiet not only that the bible says that when the people saw lazarus raised from the dead some believed and others went to the sanhedrin council to say we have to do something about this and the bible says i'm not going to get to it now but the bible says jesus he removed himself from publicly being with the people and went to ephraim where he spent some time there because he knew that they were looking for him so even though he was god on earth the fact that they were looking for him he didn't walk over there saying look me here because his time was not yet he still had certain things to do before his ministry could be completed and between the time that he was there in bethany with lazarus and baby and ephraim for spend some time and deal with certain things he finds himself now on a journey to jerusalem to complete the great purpose that he was on the earth i want you to picture it jesus is passing through and he as he approaches jericho in the scripture before he heals a blind man but that's not the mission because healing is a part of it but really god's purpose jesus coming was not just to heal that was a part of the purpose part of the mission it was just all on the journey but here it was jesus finds himself passing through jericho why are you saying this i'm building a context and a background for where we're going this morning and jesus entered and passed through jericho and behold there was a man named zacchaeus which was the chief among the publicans the publicans are the tax collectors so zacchaeus is the head of tax as it were in jericho jericho is a strategic location at that time all jericho as we know it in the days of joshua and what we call new jericho is now built as one area and king herod as it were built his winter palace there jericho was a major point and zacchaeus who was one of the jews as it were but he was attacked elector which put him in a compromised position the believers could not identify with him they had a problem with this man called zacchaeus because they would consider him in collusion with the roman government to collect taxes anybody with me but jesus finds himself moving through jericho and behold there was a man named zacchaeus which was the chief among the publicans and he was rich and this is a scripture and he sought to see jesus who he was but the brahman preaching this said this man had never seen jesus before now that is powerful it is interesting because this was a wealthy man a man in power a leader in his city and this is about one week before jesus is about to be crucified as it were and he had never seen jesus for almost three and a half years jesus had been performing miracles doing great signs and wonders i wonder why such a wealthy man a man of power a man who was a jew although backslidden had not made it his business before to see jesus billy branham in preaching this would type out that that his wife maybe it was his wife who was telling him about jesus jesus and if you could just read a little bit but it made him in psyche as the businessman said you know his wife rebecca better branham gives her a name there she was a believer and she was interested in her husband who had a business in jericho and he belonged to many societies of that day no doubt and rebecca had got acquainted with a prophet named jesus of nazareth who they claimed to be the son of god and she was interested in her husband meeting this man [Applause] i don't know what kind of testimony that rebecca had but she told her husband as it were enough to make him want to see jesus is there anybody here this morning wants to see jesus but ibraham i don't have time in the usual time but the man would type out that he didn't sleep good that night but ibrahim said he was struggling to sleep because this thing with jesus was bothering him he said we all go through night sometimes when we can't sleep too good because something's bothering you but ibrahim said it was because his wife was praying for him he wasn't sleeping god because god was disturbing his sleep so when the brother was preaching and he was comforting the people he said sometimes when your sleep is being bothered don't worry about it somebody's praying for you anybody with me this morning but it brought him a typo that maybe he was a late sleeper i can't read all the quotes but everyone said he was a late sleeper because he had a good business and he had people running his business so he didn't have to wake up early but this morning he got up early because he heard that jesus was gonna pass this way [Applause] his wife would ask why you're up so early honey i don't know i just feel like he had some fresh air i'm paraphrasing what the prophet said i want to get some fresh air but she knew in her heart something was working upon upon this man called zacchaeus something was upon him he couldn't help himself he there was something in him that was looking for something he was seeking we read the scripture that he sought to see jesus who he was he had heard many things but he want to see who is who is this man called jesus who is this i don't want to hear about him i don't i want to see him for myself i heard my wife's testimony i heard the brother's testimony i heard the sisters testimony they told me they saw him but i've never seen him and i want to see him for my self anybody with me this morning [Applause] but man i'm dramatized and we'll see it verse 3 and he sought to see jesus who he was and could not for the press the press means a crowd there were so many people around jesus that that he couldn't see him and because he was of little stature he was a short man there was a crowd around jesus but branham said in his mind he would have anticipated if jesus is coming with this crowd i need to do something different because i really want to see jesus verse 4 says and he ran before so he knows jesus is coming but he keeps so he runs ahead of time he goes in advance whatever he had heard about had been enough to convince him to take some very proactive measures he wasn't waiting to jesus to pass by him he wanted to make sure that he saw all that he needed to see so he ran ahead he didn't wait for his wife he didn't ask for permission he didn't say if this is okay to do he didn't wonder what anybody else was doing he wanted to be positioned to get the maximum opportunity to understand if this thing is real i've heard by the hearing of the air but i want to know is this gospel real will it changed my soul will it change my walk will it transform my life will it make me talk different walk different live different anybody with me this morning i'm billing into my thought now but i needed to understand the con what's leading up to this help me lord so he ran before and climbed up into a sycamore tree to see him for he was to pass that way i want to say that one more time for he was to pass that way do you know this morning that he was to pass your will do you realize this morning that he was to pass your way are you in position are you in position because he is about to pass your way are you in position this morning to see the living christ the same yesterday today and forever because he was to pass your way [Applause] billy branham when dramatizing this said that when zacchaeus tried to reach to climb the sycamore tree he couldn't reach it it's in the message go read the books zach yes the businessman but ibrahim said when he tried to reach it he couldn't he said many times he tried to reach things and he can't you got to do something else he said maybe izakiya's got a garbage can because the garbage truck didn't pass that morning and he said zacchaeus was in his best dressed business clothes but that didn't bother him he pulled a garbage can and went on top the garbage can and held on to the to the that low limb because he was a short man to pull himself up but ibrahim would dramatize the neighbors watching isn't that wealthy psychos climbing up on top the garbage pan holding on to the tree what happened to zacchaeus but he didn't business he wanted to see [Music] jesus i didn't come here this morning to hear a good sermon i came to see i didn't come just to meet people that's wonderful but i really came to see anybody with me this morning you may be seated [Applause] i love this part we're building quickly now because this is all the background in my notice is all called background and when jesus came to the place now this reminds me of when the prophet gave the example of when the plane was held back you know where the black man was he was referring it to it as well he said this lady was praying this color lady was praying lord where is your elijah so she is there there's a burden in her soul it's a crying a spirit there's a desire for something and in the meantime god is stopping the whole airport down stopping a plane now to send his elijah the way of this woman because waited a deep call into a deep there gotta be a deep to respond [Applause] and when that that woman saw where they brought him say good morning person he said how you know i'm a person he said because i asked god oh god to send me your elijah and so here it was zacchaeus doesn't even know how this will unfold he just wants to see for himself and the bible says in verse 5 and when jesus came to the place listen carefully he looked up now just to put things in context he looked up and saw him and said unto him now this may seem simple but on a whole level to zacchaeus this is a million levels incredible because for zacchaeus whole life as a short man he is normally used to looking up at people he has very little experience with adults looking up at him maybe children but here it was the man that he was looking for is looking up at him because somehow zacchaeus has positioned himself to look down at jesus and listen to jesus words and he's in them zacchaeus make his and come down in other words i know what you're looking for don't delay you know but the brandon says stand up right now and receive your healing don't even think about it make case and come down whatever you came to get to it quickly don't delay this morning you want to be healed stand up receive a healing right now you want to be set free don't even hesitate reach out raise your hand stand up on your feet and acknowledge that he's the same yesterday quickly don't even think about it don't worry about it make hiss i don't got time to waste oh my hallelujah he's the same yesterday today and forever his mercies never fail he's still a miracle-working god you may be seated zacchaeus and look how god operates it's almost out of i want to say out of character but it's so different in this case because if we read scriptures brother punch where jesus would say i stand at the door and knock and if you're open i'll come but this zacchaeus is different he said zacchaeus make his come down for today i must abide at thy house in other words i'm inviting myself into your house can you handle it are you ready for it i'm prepared for it i asked a question this morning if jesus was to invite himself into your house and say come quickly you don't have time to run inside and move stuff off your table you don't have time to oh you don't hear me this morning you ain't got time to go and fix the house that's why i asked the question are you ready to see jesus zacchaeus was ready to see jesus and his cry to jesus pull jesus with a pop well from that crowd straight to his address not his home address but the address he was hiding in because he was hiding in a tree to see jesus god didn't go to his physical address he walked up to him and said i know you're up there zacchaeus i know why you're here zacchaeus i know what you're looking for zacchaeus now if you're really serious about this thing come down now and let's go address the issues of your life i'm inviting myself to your house i'm inviting myself to your marriage am i inviting myself to see what's happening with you and your children i'm inviting myself to intervene in your business affairs [Applause] anybody here this morning are we in church this morning are we in the presence of the lord this morning you may be seated and i love it and he made with six he didn't delay and he made haste and come down came down and received him joyfully and listen to the listen to what is happening in the meantime anybody with me this morning and when they saw it they the people around jesus the people who've been following jesus the people who love jesus when they saw it they're all murmured they didn't say no to praise they didn't say hallelujah another one saved they didn't say hal remember we talk about motive what's in your heart it's only when something come up to see what's in your heart you'll see what's really there these whole group of people was like the older brother any prodigal son why are you getting blessed why are you being delivered why why jesus talking to him and listen it goes on goes on when they saw it they all murdered seeing that he was gone to be a guest with a man that is a sinner and zacchaeus stood and said unto the lord behold lord half of my goods i give to the poor and if i have taken anything from any man by false accusation i restore him fourfold and jesus said unto him this day is salvation come to this house [Applause] zacchaeus woke up that morning not knowing that that day salvation was coming to his house how do you not know that today salvation has not come to your house listen for as much so jesus is saying now for as much as he also so in case he didn't know he also is a son of abraham and being a son of abraham gives him access to what i'm giving him so he has just as right the fact that he was backslidden doesn't change the fact that he is a son of abraham the fact that he is messed up doesn't change the fact that he is a son of abraham the fact that he fell down doesn't change the fact that he's a son of abraham don't get it twisted don't mix up his failures with who he is don't mix up what he's been through with his identity don't mix up his struggles with who he is in god i hope this helped somebody go free this morning i'm not looking at your mistakes god is not looking at your mistakes god isn't looking at your failures he's looking at who you are by predestination this morning is this helping anybody this morning [Applause] for as much as he also he also i know all of you believers are sons of abraham but just in case he didn't know zacchaeus although he'd been taxing you although even leading all of that stuff he is still a son of abraham for the son of man has come to seek and to save that which was lost and the reason i read this background because this is the ghetto where i really want to get this morning that's just the preamble we need to connect it because of the way it is expressed in scripture for the bible says in verse 11 as they heard these things so jesus is actually about to teach so not only is it salvation to zacchaeus's house but he is using what they witnessed as a teaching moment don't miss this now because the bible said in verse 11 as they heard these things he added so he is building on the foundation of what just happened with zacchaeus and he added and speak a parable and it's the parable is what we really want to focus on to bring this message home this morning now a parable is a story and jesus used many parables this parable we are about to read is the last parable that jesus would teach i remember preaching a message some years ago the last words of joshua and i was referencing last words that when people are about to leave they're very careful with what they say jesus taught many parables so i went out to sow the the foolish version the wise version all these were parables the parable of the good samaritan even a parable of the good samaritan jesus was using the journey of jericho to jerusalem that was the street he was describing with the good samaritan jesus was about to take that very road of the good samaritan because he was in jericho heading to jerusalem but out of all the parables that jesus taught here it is right after zacchaeus situation god jesus is about to give his last parable before he gets ready to leave out of all the parables that jesus would bring i wonder which one would be his last and if there's anything unique about that parable that could help us understand the mind of god because parables jesus was interested because they are parables he used and he was talking about himself and he didn't tell him it was himself so i went now to sow who was he talking about you speaking about himself he didn't tell them that outright he used it he'd give a story because stories help people connect with things anybody with me so let's build and as they heard these things in context of what just happened with zacchaeus he added and speak a parable listen because because means he is doing it for a reason and he gives the reason why he is given the parallel because two things he was nigh to jerusalem that's one because so he's saying this is the parable that i've given because i'm really close to jerusalem now so i have to give it before i could go further and two because they thought that the kingdom of god should immediately appear so the believers who are around jesus were in a mindset with a punch that when we get to jerusalem this thing is all over the kingdom would be here and because he was so near jerusalem he didn't want to enter jerusalem with them having the wrong idea of what this was about and what was about to unfold bear in mind his entry into jerusalem after this is hosanna hosanna that's how you would enter jerusalem after this context that we're in so he goes into it he said there for a certain nobleman this is the parable a certain nobleman went into a far country so nobleman nobleman to be a woman is royal but noble boat all right so we know who he's talking about right a certain nobleman royal but went into a far country to receive himself a kingdom so without saying that it's a king because only a king could receive a kingdom so a nobleman he's trying to give them a story went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom and to return does this sound familiar and he called his ten servants and delivered them 10 pounds and in another translation that pounds is referred to as a meanest and said unto them occupy is not what the prophet said occupy till i come so amina is equivalent to about a hundred days salary a hundred days wages and he gives each of these men brother clarence the same thing i want to draw reference friends this is not the parable of the talents in the parable of the talents brother marlon he gave one man five talents isn't that right he gave another man what two and he gave one one so he was given measures based on their abilities but this parable is different so this is not a parable of talents in this parable he gives them all the same thing he gives them all the same responsibility he gives them all the same bible he gives them all the same message he gave them all the same promises he gave them all the same word and says do something with this thing he gives them all life he gives them all the same thing and in the amplified it says do business with this until i return in other words put it to use make profit with it don't sit down in life and say you have nothing to do i'm giving you life for a reason i'm giving you the word for a reason i'm giving you these things for a reason and do something with it until i return that's your responsibility because when i return i will want you to give an account of what you did with it anybody with me let's move on but his servants hated him are we reading this 14 this servants that is being referred to here is not the ten he gave the pounds to or demeanors to these are the citizens of the kingdom that he went to get so jesus in this type here this nobleman is going to get a kingdom to receive but the people he goes to get refuse and reject him so is it a rejected king a rejected nobleman anybody with me all right so the citizens as it were hated him and sent a message after him saying we will not have this man to reign over us in other words we don't want this king it's a rebellious spirit we don't want the king tell us how to live we don't want the king to tell us how we should pray and what we should do and how we should operate they don't want headship they don't want leadership they want to do things their own way look look this is the last parable the last one jesus is doing before he heads to calvary and look at the magnitude of what he's teaching we will not have this man to reign over us and it came to pass that when he was returned having received the kingdom he still received the kingdom then he commanded these servants to be called on to him to whom he had given the money he was away for a season he comes back now and he had left him with work to do and he comes back now he left him with the responsibility and come back now left him with children perhaps come back now left him to pray and come back no left him to read the word and come anybody getting it left then we spoke with books come back now left them with a great message come back now that he might know how much every man had gained from trading what was your profit what have you earned what have you done with this gospel the children i put into your hands how have you helped mold them and mentor them and shape them the marriage that started years ago as a seed how was it grown oh help me this morning anybody with me and this is natural and spiritual i could preach the whole natural side of this as well you could see god jesus in teaching saying listen if you have a business and you have a starting point i expect to see more when i come back you know because the bible says how much you gain from your trading so god expects profits he expects results he expects returns he don't expect to see the same thing then came the first saying and remember i'm saying this is not the talent so it's not five bring it back five two bring about two and the one ring mark the one this is now they all have the same thing they start at the same point they all have life they all have access to the word they all have access to church this morning we all in this room are in the same place that's this message here this morning i wanted to get this same starting point all start off in sin born and sin shaped in iniquity i'm no better than you you are no better than me we are the same starting point but god is coming back to see know that i've exposed you to what i've done for you where is the fruit where is the prophet where's my where's my my evidence that you are a good steward that you're a good servant anybody with me this morning can we can we take some more and the first thing lord dipowned by one pound or that one minus had gained 10 he 10x the investment he said give me one look is ten so this is this is different talents now it's not five to ten this is one to ten only reading it this one you gave me is ten and he said unto him so listen listen to my title now listen to my title you remember i asked the question what will you say to him what will you say to him and what will he say to you so this first servant in response to the question what have you done he came saying lord thy pawn had gave 10 pounds that was his response and god's response him well thou good servant because thou has been faithful in a very little without even being asked by the antwine or without the servant knowing what to expect from his faithfulness look at god's response to his faithfulness he says have thou authority over ten cities so he moved from managing now money one pound to 10 pounds to now managing 10 cities so the real so there's a reward and the reward is actually more work because it's one thing to manage money it's a whole other level of administration to manage a city i want you to see how jesus is thinking so when i am pushing for a spirit of excellence and you need to do more and i just think like managers because you are sons and daughters royalty in the economy of god you understand what i'm pushing for so god said because you've been faithful and taken one pound i'm making it ten pounds i'm going to reward you with more work i'm going to bless you with a reward but within the reward with the marlon there's more responsibility i'm gonna give you 10 cities in a city have people in a city have resources in a city have issues inner cities have things to manage anybody with me can we go on i'm using this because this this is there's so many levels to build off of this and the second came saying lord thy pawn had gained five pounds and he said likewise to him be thou also over five cities so he get rewarded he did something with it and another came saying lord behold here is thy pound which i have kept laid up in a napkin i kept it in an envelope i kept it in a box look at jesus response well in fact in every jail because he justifies for i fear thee because thou art an austere man don't take us up that down later it's not down and reapers that thou didn't sow and the nobleman says and he said unto him out of thine own mouth will i judge thee the wicked servant don't knew is that i was austere man taking them that i leave not done and reaping what i did not so wherefore then in other words if you think i was a problem and i was this fearful and this bad you should have been more more afraid because you're telling me you was scared and he didn't do anything about it but he was really scared this is what is being said here you're telling me he was afraid if he was really afraid then you shouldn't be desperate to do something with it listen and listen to jesus this is jesus teaching now this is not the prophet this is not brother branham this is jesus's teaching here wherefore then in other words the least i expected from you wherefore then gave us not though my money into the bank that at my coming i might have required my own usury so jesus same the minimum the minimum that i would have considered was at least interest but don't give me the same thing even because listen there's a difference in accounting between interest and profits huh you can take money and put it in the bank and make interest to make profit need to take money and do something with it like buy product and sell it for something else to make a profit she said if you couldn't make a profit with it the least i expected what i gave you is interest put it in the bank bare minimum this is that my teaching this number the branham teacher and this is jesus teaching this is back to the bible verse 24 and he said unto them that stood by so you see jesus have no problem using the bank right now just putting it out there are quoting jesus he'd have an issue with the banking system you'd obviously bank i want to put certain things to rest because people don't know the bible spin the prophet's message into all kind of different directions to tire people's mind this is jesus teaching and he said unto them that stood by listen to the response of the man who couldn't even put it in the bank take from him the pound take everything from him and give it to him that had 10 pounds and listen even in the parable jesus is showing the issue people had he said and they said unto him lord but he already had 10 pounds verse 26 4 i say unto you that unto everyone which hath shall be given in other words for those of you who have and you're pressing and you're working and you're tarrying and you're praying and you're pressing you have more coming yeah don't worry about it you have more coming he knows your prayer he sees your sacrifice you're pressing you're praying you're fighting you're contending you have more to get he gonna give you more and from him that hath not you're not doing nothing because i gave you before you know but now you have nothing even that that he had shall be taken away from him and then the parable ends with jesus addressing rejecting people he said but those mine enemies which would not that i should reign over them bring their and slay them before me complete judgment may the lord have a blessing to the reading of his word can we bring this home can we bring the sir close what will you say to him what will he say to you friends we all have to give an account because we have been given something on a very basic level we have been given life and we have to give an account for that life because we didn't give ourselves life so there's already no excuse because you didn't give yourself life you have to give an account to who gave you the life but beyond that for us in here this morning and those connected he has given us a message a word a way of escape a way out he has given promises and we have to give an account we have to give an answer for what we have done with this thing and more than that as my inspiration did i give i give my title my subject the judgment seat of christ we all have to deal with the judgment seat of christ now the judgment seat of christ is not the white throne judgment so i want to make a distinction as we raise this so close in the interest of time we are judged as sinners when we were judged with christ on calvary so i'm not dealing with being saved or not saved now i'm kind of building last two sundays ago when i preach about do not cross the line i was dealing with with sin and not sin and on this line and this line this is now a different story now i'm coming home to believers so the issue i'm not dealing with now is salvation or making it or even making the rapture now because you are judged as a sinner that's what calvary deals with your judgment as a son is what the tutor manages because when you're born again and you're walking in your sunshine true place of trying that is the judgment of the tutor to how your behavior and conduct is and it's based on that judgment you are now a candidate for adoption anybody with me so your judgment as a sinner is calvary your judgment as a son is through the process of place of trying so because you are born and being positionally born but i'm not even speaking about that this morning i'm going beyond that because you could be judged as a sinner you can be judged as a son but you are also judged as a servant and your judgment as a servant is the judgment of the seat of christ the judgment seat of christ is not about salvation or adoption it's about rewards what rewards will you get because our responsibility is as a christian as a son but there's a way that we can do things that get certain rewards anybody with me this morning you're running we all running the racino and listen when you cross you race you win you make it but how did you run your race what reward are you going to get after you run your race anybody with me this morning i want to build a little bit it's our responsibility to run the race how we run the race is about accountability can we take a little more listen to paul in hebrews 12 verse one wherefore seeing that we also are compass about with so great a cloud of witnesses listen let us lay aside now he's speaking to this is hebrews there guys hebrews this is believers let us listen lay aside every weight and the sin which that so easily beset us and let us run with patience the rate that is set before us so he's saying we're running a race but there are two things that we can lay aside we delay aside every week and the sin so there are people in here who need to lay a sight sin you have work to do do it quickly get rid of it because you're holding us back anybody with me because we can't go through the rapture without you so fix it it's exactly us with his make his clean your life up you need to repent get get get that in order because we want to go beyond repentance and go into the reward part of the thing the blessing part of the thing the crown party thing the jewels in a crown party thing anybody with me this morning we don't want to just run the race and say well i run and i'll barely make it no i want when i run this oh gosh give him a prize he run the race so well give him something extra he make it to no but give him something extra give him an extra reward with a punch so how did paul say do that he said lay aside two things so there are those here who they don't lay a sight singing all day did that don't bother them but you see the weight oh gosh is it just distraction it's what kind of thing holy no you know you're running the eraser but oh gosh you're dragging this foot you're dragging this foot because the cell phone is he neighbor is he politics is this brother it's his sister and all his weight so paul is saying let me run if you lay off sin then lay off all the weight every distraction anything that will slow you down in other words i want you to run faster because how you run the race i want you to know there are some rewards to the overcomers there are some rewards based on how you run the race can the church say amen so i'm not wondering if you're going to make it if you're going to get saved and i'll deal with if you get to the rapture i'm dealing with when you get there you still have to deal with the judgment seat of christ to give an account for the things we have done in this life because based on that account what you say god will respond anybody with me this morning listen to the prophet i'm going to get ready to close out soon musicians you could start to slowly get ready in the message who i believe or report listen to the brother branham and the sincerity and dear christian friends i may be having my last american meetings for all i know i'm going overseas now and i feel the call to finish up my journey overseas in africa and the different parts of the world i don't know when i can be back again it will only be through the will of god and whatever he chose me to do and i love you and i know someday so for those who are wondering about judgment someday i must stand at the judgment seat of christ to give an account for the things we have done in this life friends you could make the rapture and did a horrible job as a parent because the issue may not be your soul you know but the account of giving an account of what god put in your responsibility you could have done better it may not have been you did a bad job you know but you could have done more oh i'm pushing higher now it is not that you are a horrible parent and you did wrong things you know the real question is was that your best because in giving an account it's about you reporting back on how well he did a job because if you did a b b-plus and he could do an a god knows it anybody with me listen to the prophet again in the faith i was once delivered to the scenes now there be there may be many things that i do not know but i do know jesus christ this is the prophet i do with the bottom of my heart and someday i've got to meet everyone at you at the judgment seat of christ i've got to stand it that's right i've got to give an account for what i say and do so if i'm in error it's sincere i don't mean it so listen to the prophet now being conscious that he has to give an account as a pastor but over has to give an account as an assistant pastor i have to give an account the deacons ministers parents have to give an account in your job you have to give an account you can have a responsibility and do a horrible job and you all know it you have co-workers who are horrible the responsibility is your job description the accountability is how well you do your job [Music] you have a child you automatically have the responsibility as a parent but we all know horrible parents the issue is that knowing about the responsibility the issue is can you give an account for what kind of parent you are that's why brother branham said god don't make halfway preachers but a preacher could be halfway the responsibility is to preach but when they have to give an account they give an account of being a halfway preacher god don't make halfway christians but a christian could be halfway the responsibility is a christian but when you come to give an account what are you going to say i heard somebody say it'll be embarrassing for some of us when we hear other people at the judgment seat of christ saying lord have testified i've helped people and you have nothing to say you may have overcome but you never testify to nobody you never help nobody your whole world is about you and here it was we read jesus would have left and take a journey through jericho because he had to pick up zacchaeus all along his journey he was about deliverance and salvation even to people who the the the normal believers thought wasn't supposed to be saved because if you would ask those believers or listening that you talk to zacchaeus they say no not a sinner because when jesus say i go in to show you how their confidence in jesus was questionable it was because jesus went and looked in moment they were not with the program you know i want you to picture this they reach this is one week before the crucifixion and they're not really fully with the program you know because when jesus looked to go into zakiyah so they say look he go in the house of a sinner i agree with that you know i'm not sure the past don't know what he's doing this morning that's that that's what that's what that's what it was i with jesus and nobody see that program that brother zacchaeus he's with this morning i am not with that i am in jesus's church but there are certain things in the church i don't agree with one thing i could tell you to agree with is him meeting with brother zacchaeus you know how much taxes he take from me he overtaxed me last year the year before that the year before that i put in an appeal zacchaeus get over here and here it is jesus with brother zacchaeus anybody with me this morning thank god jesus doesn't think the way we think thank god he doesn't look through the eyes of man and when he saw zacchaeus he saw a son and when zacchaeus saw jesus he saw lord [Applause] anybody with me this morning because jesus himself had to give an account he said all that the father had given me muscle i have a responsibility for all that the father has given me can we can we finish up listen to the prophet in dealing with his understanding of his own accountability before i close out in 1961 the six-fold purpose of gabriel's visit to daniel listen to the prophet there was for about i guess the first three or four years of my ministry right here at the tabernacle i wouldn't even preach on the subject of hell because i couldn't make out whether it was a burning place whether it was a grave and every time the word spoke grave i'd get the translation said hades hades is the grave every time it spoke of hell hate is good when i just left it alone till i really found out what i was speaking about then i preached on hell so when i really found out the whole picture and seeing where it was at because i feel that a minister is responsible to god what he tells that congregation because they're going to hold right onto that and so then what if i've got them holding on the wrong place and then the time comes when that won't hold when that whole one's done and in the vision that the lord gave me some time ago with those millions when that one speaking to me said you'll be judged first by the gospel you preach i said i preach the same thing paul did and the rest of them and all those millions of voices screamed out we are resting on that anybody with me this morning so i want you to understand it's the sincerity of you given an account as a christian of you being able to give an answer as a son as a daughter lord help us i want to just touch two more things and i'm done in the message revelation chapter 4 3. but the man says forgive me if i try to take the place of a boss i'm no boss but i feel to you like paul said back there about his congregation once you are the stars in my crown meaning the reward when i cross over the land over on the other side of yonder and meet you in that glorified condition i want you to stand there to shine like the stars in my ground i want you to be there i want you to be there revelation 22 12 and behold i come quickly and my reward is with me to give every man according as his work shall be what is your work what what account will you give of your life on this earth will your testimony be well i serve the law but but my my when but in my job nobody knows a christian is that the account you're going to give did i live my life and i and i never really tried to win my son when my daughter when my neighbor i never really i could have done more you know but i just never did is that your account is that your answer i know for me i want to be able to say lord i did everything i poured out all i could when i was tired whether i was sick without i guess whatever i could do i could do for the kingdom because only what has done for the king i would last dinner you know but a man i'm thought of giving up the ministry america was making excuses you know he was actually using scripture to justify quitting you know that let me see if i can just read it at it here and remember he had a dream and in a dream he didn't realize until what it was but in the dream he had this she saw this man and this man became a a viet grant a bomb and these two different things and he realized it was him in that was he was dreaming about right and god said to him carry out your plans because he says i feel i want to just go and hunt and he say well and elijah of old was a hunter and he used that punch to kind of as an exit now maybe i just don't spend my time in the trees like elijah because he was going to get away from the people and god said listen carry out your plans you're on the one hunt and go any forest and ignore your ministry work in other words you have a responsibility you know but but how are you going to give an account for your responsibility in your office anybody with me this morning listen to it here go to prophet he said carry out your plans and you'll be like that i said lord i don't want to be like that he said your wife will go too so god told the prophet if you quit the ministry your wife will leave you you'll end up vagrant because i gave you a responsibility not only are you accountable there are consequences for you not fulfilling the responsibility that i give you you have a responsibility as a father as a mother as a believer as a deacon as a son whatever it is don't you think there are consequences to when god has an expectation of what you do for him listen to brother branham here this is in june this is june 23 1963. so he said your wife will go to she won't live up there in them hills like that do you want to live in the forest and hunt like elijah old your wife not handling that if you could handle that that's one thing by telling you go tell your wife and live in jungle with with you and you'll become a bomb just as the dream showed you would you see the thing of is not all of us have the opportunity for god to show us what will happen when we do what we're not supposed to do or we ignore what we're supposed to do we are not all given that opportunity to get you warning but but a brand i'm got the warning so i want you to take the warning for your life right now about you have a responsibility to pray a responsibility to word our responsibility and sanctification our responsibility to god our responsibility to the church and when you walk away you see some of us we know the work thing you know originally to walk you get right up you miss a deer you have to bring in sick leave hunting your understanding naturally about where god is well his church is a is it don't you know this is more important than your job people afraid that boss that's why he probably read he said if he really fear man then he would not bring back the same thing i'll give you at least you had to do something with it you tell me you're afraid remember you're showing me area refreed me your fear is a lip service because the fear of the lord is the beginning of wisdom and wisdom when i'll show you at least a bit in the bank better yet to bring back a profit to me because i'll give you the word not fair to sit on books and tapes but for it to become a life anybody with me this morning i'm trying to close out i'm trying to close out i'm trying to close out listen to the prophetess i don't want to deliver i want to do something different listen to the prophet's rationale i want you something different that you are calling me to be a prophet and i want to live in the wilderness like a prophet but really the motive behind that was to get away from the worker you remember we talked about the whole thing about motive he using words to say but i want to live like a prague but his motive is he want out of the responsibility but and he said it he says but i was using my own excuse so i could hunt my own good so the prophet now comment on maturity saying you know saying i want to be like elijah i'm going hunt anything but it's really i like to hunt and if you leave me i just hunt and i don't come and preach and don't come and minister and god said do go ahead go ahead do it go ahead you want to hunt hunt you become a bum and your wife will leave you because i call it to be no hunter he said i was using my own excuse so i could hunt my own good and he said but dad listen listen but the balance said and he said so god talked to the prophet and he said but that was the prophets of the old testament he said you've been called to be there in a much higher office than that your job description your responsibility is that hunting in the forest anybody with me this morning he said you have more gifts beside that you know how much gifts you have locked up in you that you want to you're walking here you're going to parties here having connor you do all kind of thing you're not supposed to do don't you know you have a higher office don't you know you're called for the manifestation of the sons of god don't you know you are the message jesus christ we have to be able to give an answer so god could respond god down blessed and faithful servant you have more gifts besides that he was called to pray for the sick and to preach the gospel in the apostolic form of great of things many great griefs and god goes on he said why do you wait for me to move you every time you move so god was telling prophet why you have to wait for me to push you every time i had to move to push you that's god talking to the prophet you know only seeing this that it wasn't by the bran there's always was feelings and coming to the pulpit that he had his own doubts he had his own fears he had his own desires and god didn't say listen to god why do you wait for me to move you every time you move so because i'm getting tired of pushing the prophet pushing the prophet to do we're supposed to do and but um i said he ended with where is your reward so by the brand of god i said brother yeah there's a reward for you you know where's your reward keep doing it you're going to be a reward it's not in vain i'm going to bless you i'm gonna keep you i'm gonna preserve you [Applause] hallelujah last quote and i'm done did this help anybody this morning last quarter i'm done you could pay something very very softly very very softly hallelujah friends we must be in a position to give an answer lord i took your word and i did everything i could do i prayed i cried i i sought your face i testified i i punned i put down everything that doesn't glorify your name you know how many things you could do that that you could do but it's worthless when they go could you present to god your degree in school well lord i really studied hard you know i have five certifications i studied so much what is that worth on that side lord i watched the car there was not a speck of dirt i'm not saying to wash the car but how you use your time is what you have to give an account for how many things you do that has no value i'm not saying they're not going to be saved i'm not saying you're not going to be in the rapture there was a memorial for cornelius in heaven is there a memorial for you for your prayers for your son for your daughter for yourself could the same thing be said that there's a memorial for you they took note in heaven the cornelius prayers [Music] you have to separate what is worthless from what is valuable as currency in the eternal realm of god your bank account has no value there your certifications have no value there your friendships have no value there what reward do you want son daughter of the living god what will be your reward that's what god asks the prophet you have a responsibility but how well you do it very lies your reward last caught in the sixth seal but a man i'm here he said i want to tell you a little thing happened this was a dream i was asleep i've never told this publicly before i told it to a couple of people but never publicly before as i know of i dreamed about the month after that that i was standing one day and i was watching the great time not the judgment now careful not the white drone judgment because i don't believe the church ever comes to i mean the bride goes to a judgment so we're not talking white trump judgment but i was there when the crown was being given out this is my way in your work your labor your effort your what you've done for the lord you're a believer but what have you done for the lord he said i was there when the crown was being given out and the great big throne set up there and jesus and the recording angel do you know there's a recording angel recording every word you speak recording every place you go recording everything you do recording every thought you have there's a record being made nothing is left out of that record that record has every detail of every time you lied every time you cried every time you you whatever it is but thank god for the blood because that that blood covers the sins hallelujah as far as jesus from the west he removed my transgressions from me in the sea of forgetfulness not to be found so your record no sin could show up there because you are son and daughter of the living god but in that book there are still records of your labors for the lord of your sacrifices for the lord of the time you sighed and cried for the abomination in the city and you held on for the young people that's not the sin but that's the records of the burden in your soul to make a church to make a revival [Music] some people have two items on that record some have ten some have a thousand [Music] one time a sister in branham tabernacle asked the prophet but abraham could you not travel that much could he just stay with us for a while and he said sister he said if if i stay i can maybe save help saved for 30 people he said but if i go to the fields i could bring thousands for the lord and that's where the reward is at the reward is bringing in the souls for the lord help him bring that reconciliation back to christ what's on your record what does the recording angel have on you i'm not speaking the sinners right now i'm speaking to believers who have become lazy let me try to finish out here not the judgment but i was there when the crowd was being given out the great big throne set up there and jesus and the recording angel and all was standing there and there were still steps like coming down this way off white ivory run down a circle made a little panoramic like this and went out and saw that all this great host cloud of witnesses this great host standing out there could see what was happening what is it it's a graduation ceremony it's a crowning ceremony it's a reward giving ceremony but are you there's a reward for you hallelujah there are many believers i know there's a reward for you no matter how you feel you're doing something for the lord without asking for a blessing or favor nothing and some of you do nothing what will your reward be on that day when we stand out of us [Music] and i would stand back over listen to the prophet way back to one side and i was just standing there listening to the prophet never an idea i had to walk them steps i was standing there i'd see the recording angel would call a certain name and i would no recognize that name i looked and way back out there here comes the brother walking with the sister walked up to you like that the recording angel standing there by the side of christ he said just a dream now and was watching and the name was on the there it was found in the book of life he will look out over them and say it is well done my good and faithful servant now enter in i look back where they was going there was a new world and the joys and said enter into the joys of the lord that's been for your sins the foundation of the world and oh i thought they'd go through there and meeting one another and just rejoicing and going over mountains and a great big place but i thought oh isn't that wonderful glory hallelujah just jumping up and down then i would hear another name called i think oh i know him i know him there he goes there watch him like that enter into the joys of the lord my god oh i'd say praise god praise god just say for instance like they say oh my neville did not say it that's old brother neville there he is see how he comes out of the crowd he goes up now we say enter into the
