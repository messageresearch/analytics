to nine and revelation chapter eight verse one to five thank you so much for this tremendous atmosphere that we feel in the building this morning oh praise the lord revelation chapter 5. and i saw on the right of him that sat on the throne a book written within on a backside seal with seven seals and i saw a loud angel strong angel proclaim with a lord voice who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof and no man in heaven knowing earth neither under the earth was able to open the book needed to look there on and i wept much because no one was found worthy to open and to read a book needed to look thereon one of the elders said unto me weep not behold the lion of the tribe of judah the root of david had prevailed to open the book until loose the seven seals thereof and i beheld and lo in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts in the midst of the four and the elders to the lamb as it had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of god sent forth into all the earth he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that set up on the throne and when he had taken the book the four beasts the four and twenty elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them harps and golden vials full of odors which are the prayers of the saints and they sung a new song saying god worry to take the book and to open the seals thereof for dao was slain and has redeemed us to god by thy blood out of every kindred and tongue and people and nation revelation chapter 8 reading verse 1 to 5. and when he had opened the seventh seal there was silence in heaven about a space of half an hour and i saw the seven angels which stood before god and to them were given seven trumpets and another angel came and stood at the altar having a golden censer and i was given unto him much incense that he should offer it with the prayers of all saints upon the golden altar which was before the throne and the smoke of the incense which came with the prayers of the saints ascended up before god out of the angel's hand and the angel took the censer filled it with fire of the altar cast it unto the earth and there were voices and thunderings and lightnings and an earthquake let us pray father we thank you for your word and we pray that you would take me out of the way god made the holy spirit coming in a special way and lord bless those that are here bless those that are connected to us tonight over the internet and those who would listen to the tape father may not just be a viewing but maybe a flow of the holy spirit that would minister to all those everywhere granted father may the anointing call upon the word may you get glory and honor in jesus we ask it amen and amen you may be seated praise god thank you lord jesus and i'll just sit down just give god some praise and some worship and some thanksgiving we feel we're in a special season we feel we're in a special time we feel we are transitioning to something powerful praise the name of the lord hallelujah praise god hallelujah know right now the president-elect is donald trump in america he's not yet on the throne he's titled president-elect but he's destined to sit on that throne and the bride is the bride elect lady she's not on that throne yet but that is where she is heading right now there's a transition taking place to put you in a position of power god have to actually set you up set your mind up set the things around you up in order that you could take up your place hallelujah don't just take up a place like that you have to be prepared for it you have to transition into it from the ministry of the word to the ministry of the spirit from now faith ears to the supernatural manifestation of all what god promised because wherever god is there is supernatural supernatural this morning shouted out again supernatural yeah yeah wherever god is there is supernatural he's a healer this morning he's a deliverer this morning he's a waymaker this morning when your back is against the wall and it seems like there is no way out he could remove mountains this morning oh yes that's the god we serve we serve a living one not a dead one and living one that can take care of your problem that could operate on you and your spirit and your body and your soul [Applause] summer title this morning the breaking of heaven silence and have an inspiration the prayer of the saints that's my inspiration the prayer of the saints not the prayer of the bishop not the prayer of the pope not the prayer of the faithful hallelujah but the prayer of the saints there is power in the prayer that's what the devil don't want you to know did you hear what i said this morning did you get that this morning there is power in your prayer [Applause] oh give the lord a shout in the house and there's a vial [Applause] hallelujah you want to fill up that vial you want to fill that that jar that prayer jar you want to fill it up hallelujah praise god don't be worried because nothing happening is that that violent defeat right now that fire empty and so forth but you got to keep pouring keep pouring on it one day it will be filled up and the angel gonna take it and pour it upon the earth praise god i've heard ah i've heard the cries of my people i heard i heard the groaning that they want the holy ghost i heard they're groaning that they want their healing i heard the groaning that they want to break through you got to be groaning not complaining groaning not set up groaning not giving up groanin [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah when you groan and not complain you are saying satan you are liar my god is an awesome god [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah i will be delivered hallelujah i may be not delivered yet but i will be here because he gonna break that silence come on now come on now when you talk to god and call upon god and he doesn't answer that's the very ow to be certain of god to be certain he made a promise to be certain he will confirm his word to be certain he will back it up in power to be certain he will back it up with signs wonders and miracles we are transitioning this morning oh hallelujah praise god [Applause] you may be seated i have a contact scripture you could find if they wanted some joshua chapter want to read that scripture now jericho was strictly shut up because the children of israel none went out none came in there's a tight ship shut up and the lord said unto joshua see i have given unto thine and jericho it's shut up nobody coming in nobody going out and god says see i give it to you they bind it up they block it up they put a gate around it they put walls around it but i have given it you can't miss it because the world is bigger around it you can't miss it because the tallest thing are wrong and it can't move they ain't going nowhere you're going to lose them and you're going to set them free let's read on hell the lord said see i've given one to thine hand jericho and the king thereof and the mighty men of valor you shall come past the city all the men of war go around the city once thus shall thou do six days seven priests shall bear before the ark seven trumpets of ram horns and the seventh day he shall come past the city seven times and the priests shall blow with the trumpets and it should come to pass when they make a long blast with the rams horn and when you hear the song of the trumpet all the people shall shout with a great shout and the wall of the city shall fall down flat and the people shall ascend up every man straight before him so god lay out the end from the beginning he gave the description of the order of how it's supposed to be he described the end game which is the city was to fall flat but there are fine prints to that whole plan that god give you carry out and get excited and just do your own thing you have to wait for further instruction the city has already been given your family has already been given forget what your eyes see everybody should be screaming now [Applause] you are not going with your five senses your senses are lying say man say amen your senses are lying you are not the believer the believer is the word in you [Applause] [Applause] let me just get cracking here our righteousness is filthy rags you see your best foot forward you praying and you seeking the lord and so on filthy rags that's what you do you pray you pray that you you can't even approach god holiness with that so god will even hear you yes you is because of blood over you he hears your prayer and when your prayer comes to that blood it smells sweet [Applause] like incense not just your voice but when it comes to the perfume [Applause] of that rose of sharon of that lily of the valley my god when a man of god prayer when the saints of god pray under that blood those devils tremble because you got to know there is power not your prayer but power in the blood and when your prayer boss through that blood my god the gates of heaven have to open up and i feel this morning something's gonna break something gonna take place right in this place right in this building right among you [Applause] don't bother with what the senses declare you might be seated oh our father abraham demonstrated a life of faith that was astonishing that is shocking god spoke to him about he and his wife god never told syria anything he said you're gonna have a son and his name gonna be isaac isn't that right true this old woman named sarah never had a child and past child by her own time and abraham to believe for himself and believe for his wife who god never spoke to who had horrors and fight and mind battles and she have a right to have that because she never got a revelation of what abraham had if she was in the spiritual and super spiritual not super religious behavior she might walk out on abraham until you have crack but you see the fate of abraham does make it act funny it is making act contrary to other people thinking they make an old man believe that he's going to have a child and make an old man believe his old woman wife gonna have a child and he's tagged not when his back hurt him he wasn't stuck in a little bit when he had to hold the stick he was rocking a little bit that wasn't the problem he had a cough he had this he had pain he had fever that's not the problem but what god said don't mess with that don't play with that what god said don't deny that just say god said so come on let the lord give the lord a shout don't fool with that [Applause] listen god took them out to egypt that wasn't a problem feed them in the wilderness they complained that wasn't a problem they want meat they had a light bread there's not a problem you said meat for them they would drink water from a rock whatever they want god struggled you with them because you know that's not the promise the journey is not the promise so all you're fed up and you're tired you're on your journey but when they came to kenya and god trying to say but listen friends i'm about to show you what the fulfillment is what the endgame is don't don't know i want to bring evidence back i want to send men spies to bring back evidence of a reality that this is more than quotes and books and tapes and scripture reading there is a land beyond the river there's a supernatural power there's a power to heal the shake to raise the dead to cast out better to speak in new tongues there's a power like you've never seen before that is coming to the church now hallelujah i want you to believe in that power don't just come to church to sit the bench come to church to create an atmosphere to make a church not going to make a revival even a 700 revival oh blessed be the name of the lord oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory to god glory to god my father my father my father yes six of that scripture and joshua the son of nun call the priests said unto them fine print take up the ark of the covenant let the seven priests bear seven trumpets of our homes before the act of the lord he said unto people pass on compass the city let him that is am the person before the act of the lord and it came to pass when joshua spoke unto the people seven priests bearing seven trumpets of ram horns passed on before the lord and blew their trumpets and the act of the covenant of the lord followed them and the armed men went before the priests and blew the trumpets and reward came after the act the priest going on blowing the trumpets hear this part and joshua had commanded the people saying you shall not shout [Music] or make any noise with your voice neither shall any word proceed out of your mouth until the day i beat you to shout then shall you shout so amidst the whole plan joshua introduced a a time of silence [Music] silence does mean nothing happening [Applause] silent doesn't mean that there's just nothing in effect no silence is waiting for the appointed time to execute god's plan and purpose so joshua said when i believe the show then show oh hallelujah glory to god amen hallelujah praise the lord praise god praise god and it came to pass on the seventh day when they arose early about the dawn of the day and compassed the city seven times only on that day and the compass is 87 times came to pass on the seventh time when the police brought the trumpets justice and people shout for the lord had given you the city praise god that's before the city fall before the walls fell they had to shout because the lord gave the city you're not waiting for the walls to fall to shout you have to shout before your walls [Applause] that's faith when you could shout before your eyes pop open when you could shop before your party your body get loose when you could praise god hallelujah after 25 years believe in god when you could give god a praise offering my god that like the devil said that he's out of your hands now because you reconnect to the sense you had before the fall you see right now you you born in sick you born in sin and shape iniquity and connect the five senses but when you see you reconnect to the sixth sense of fate that you had before the fall that then you come like a indeed invincible man you come like a superman praise be to jesus oh glory to god and the devil didn't want you to understand that god promised alaska some superman not men with no s mark on the chest not that kind of superman nice hollywood nice nice comic strip business we're talking about real superman like daniel was a superman praise god him every mother superman praise god them to you boys they were superman yes yes yes daniel the land couldn't eat him fires and burn them fellas them guys was different altogether they had a different kind of dna that different kind of gene that dream come from god it always came from god they were not just men of the earth they came from god going back to god and god promised in the last days for the manifestation the sons of god when real sons born sons failed sons anointed sons speak and the word is created just like that my god preaching the gospel in power you're gonna see it right here oh yeah yeah yeah you're gonna see it the word preaching it's power the clarity of the gospel the word being made plain no more questions no more unbelief no more doubts the prayers of the saints you're going to understand it and when you get a revelation that heaven is waiting on your prayers heaven is waiting on your prayer oh glory to god [Applause] oh hallelujah remember she did my why i think conditions come the drivity means why i think conditions come to get you desperate sometimes we have it too easy i really have nothing you have a good job you have this you have that but there is no burden of good no wonder john wept john had the holy ghost but when he saw no man was worthy john begin to weep because you know this is critical somebody got to take it somebody got to pull it somebody got to rip it up one sat on the throne mighty angel said who is worthy who is where they somebody got to be worthy because we have to come back on the earth oh give the lord some shouts in the house this this book this mysterious book but with names on it sealed oh hallelujah you you you can't even look on it you can't even take it no bishop think about the biggest bishop you know no pope no no poor bunny face whoever faced no bishop no archbishop could could even look on the book all of a sudden the lamb let's change the scene now so jesus didn't just come to die for our sins know when you look deeper jesus came to get this book that he could drop it on the earth to produce more sons like him or do you get that this morning oh god you are not just no sinner hanging out wrong looking for the grace of god that's not you [Applause] listen you may be seated if adam didn't fall you never want born and seem to begin with [Music] no adultery no fornication no lust no backslider no whatever felt whatever in your life none of that if adam didn't fall and god said not you said god said i will restore [Applause] it has nothing to do with you god said that i will bring back a second adam a second eve [Applause] and if jesus is the second adam question where is madame eve [Applause] oh i feel i feel this bride got me one beautiful glorious anointed rainbow colored my god you talk about the bride for jesus christ [Applause] you gotta forgive me if i dance a little bit if i walk a little bit forgive me but i feel like john i feel i'm in the spirit yeah i feel i'm in the spirit oh hallelujah or something to be in the spirit hallelujah you can't work it up but you're in it then ride it jump in it swim in it rejoice in it forget your past forget your failures forget your sins forget that let the blood splash in you this morning the blood of jesus for those redeemed us by thy blood [Applause] every government in this world belongs to lucifer everyone that is why the government will have no choice but to come after the elect brother branham said daniel shadrach they were loyal people they were qualified people they were honorable people and still things work against them you cannot escape you will not escape your testimony is important to god oh hallelujah praise god when abraham said when the church finds his brotherly love and the church finds his whole decency well by their love no big sign but they could laugh people laughing yeah i didn't see nothing all right all reasons here i see nothing you see these are virtues and revelations you can see you can't touch a candle but he said the bride will get their place in christ not place in the medicine association not placing conventions no please christ if you are placed in christ god could put you in china in australia go to lucio in a hell hole you will still survive because you are not placed in the hellhole you place in christ paul was in prison and when paul was writing his letter paul wrote paul a prisoner of jesus christ he was rejecting the person he was in he totally disannulled that he cancelled that out he do like that prison did not exist as far as he was concerned he'd lock up already you can't lock up a lockup man the italian prisoner prisoner he was already prisoned with chains of love for you to tie that man up when he already wrapped up in christ jesus my god how many feel free this morning how many feel your power of god is mortal there's power here to heal you that's power yet to deliver you that was power to set you free [Applause] [Applause] from the seventh seal now remember this seven seal is the end time of all things it's the end of the struggling world it's the end of struggling nature it's god sealed the plan of redemption how he bringing us back because you see in the beginning we wasn't supposed to be filled and getting old and getting sick and getting all this kind of pain and just going down to the dust what does that shall return in the beginning was spirit man god make dust man put spirit man in dust man and that's what we have here right now so this is not me there's a house i'm living in gokart i put you in any house any color house any country house but that doesn't stop it because dog has redeemed us by their blood out of every nation so god could have put you in a tiny house i'm gonna have to find you so your gene is known by god that's why god had no fight with prostitute with home monger with with this with with drunkards god have no fight with that what god looked at is what's inside idea [Applause] watch watch you may be seated watch watch watch the testimony was this this woman is caught we have a camera on video all of them had a cell phone doing so in the very act of adultery moses say stoner they bring the quotes for jesus they quote into the the living quote moses said to stone her jesus said okay no problem i'm not fighting with moses it's not it's not i am not having no debate with moses i want more to say you know my my challenge is what in your heart if one more just say in your heart agreeing with like something else so i will say it this way which one are you without sin drop it on her what's the first stone on her give it to her [Applause] one by one all them big shots walk out because they know they're guilty as hell of all kind of things maybe not adultery maybe greed maybe maybe envy maybe jealousy maybe hatred maybe the curse of the neighbor maybe they're born underneath the house you know what they do tear they take the neighbor ox when jesus faced that woman he's a woman wearing accusers she said there is none she said neither do i condemn thee neither jesus condemn her so jesus was on point in person to say woman i'm not even in that you know i come to let you know there's a higher order there's a higher life that you could connect to woman i'm going to free you go and sin no more and i was there to lose her let her go come on now and i believe inside of here this morning somebody gonna go loose somebody gonna go free yeah you don't have to live that life no more god could empower you could somebody say amen on that you don't have to go back and do what you were doing god can empower you power from on high glory your servant seal it's like final rocket into the air rocket explodes and it goes up and explodes again you put on five stars out of those stars explode put on five more stars then one damn star explode and break forth five more stars that's what the seventh seal it ends the time of the world it ends the time for this it then the time for that it ended time for everything is ended up on that seventh seal the breaking of the sea was so great that heaven was hushed by silence for the space of half an hour half an hour was fixed no man could change it it's only for a space of half an hour half an hour of silence god's silence heaven silence but underneath that silence he's redeeming a people by his blood by his word redemption present tense he himself came down in first thessalonians 4. scripture said the lord himself descends from heaven with a shout with a sound hallelujah with the voice of the archangel and the trump of god the lord himself here he had to trust no other angel to come to cut this bride he came down in revelation 10 and 17 through its voice result oh glory to god seven thunders throw its voices out it's not gonna catch the snakes it's not gonna catch the crabs it's gonna catch the rainbow trout they're gonna catch the elect lady therefore the seven thousand is only for the bride it's an exclusive bright promise [Applause] all glory of god and the lion of the tribe of judah he wrote it out oh hallelujah do you believe that oh praise the name of the lord no singing no praises no altar nothing silence deadly silence in heaven for half an hour all the hosts of heaven was silent when this seven seal mystery in the book of redemption was broken think of it but it's broke oh hallelujah who could say it wasn't broke it broke but it was silent hallelujah for half an hour what you're gonna think when that happened what that silence is broken oh hallelujah oh my heaven going back with noise man because heaven is full of worship you know only that's why half an hour was fixed only half an hour haven't gonna only hold that back for half an hour after half an hour is back to worship it's back to shouts because shout because the lord has given you the city after half an hour is a year of jubilee after half an hour you're going back to your family you're going back to your prayer life you're going back to inheritance you're going back to that anointing that make you a super church a super race as super people on the earth i am convinced that there is a super race on the earth [Applause] all this racist nonsense is only impersonating a true elect race that god put on the earth with the dna of god hallelujah makes you not superior but make you to be like god a god man on the earth [Applause] glory glory glory [Applause] my jesus you remember caesar that super gene make you transcend natural and supernatural look at jesus going to a wedding and wine ran out and they man i study wine right now do you say what i have to do with that what i'll do with that i'm a guest like everybody else but then he had instructions whatever he said do it got his word not normal he just speak by faith and walk by faith his word could create things just like that so don't fool with what he said whatever he said just do it he said take some bottles and just draw it draw the water out of it listen you're pouring water and you're pouring out wine you're full in water and pouring out wine you're full in water and pouring on wine don't let the water fool you you're going to pour old wine oh oh my god hallelujah you know what wine is wine is stimulation of revelation wine is what makes you stand up why is what makes you shout what is going to make it all hallelujah why make it crazy it's being revealed to you by your father flesh and blood have not reveal it [Applause] and that's the problem lacking people like revelation know the bible true and god is true and god is true but not revelation but if you get revelation a different thing like that look at simeon old man it was revealed to him that he shall see deathly lord christ cancer come flicker cancer so grim reaper come he said take a spin not yet as long as you see christ you can do nothing grim people gave me wink i went guys say wink how much i want a wink make a spin you can't touch me you could watch me but until messiah come you can do one thing because these eyes are anointed to see messiah [Applause] what are you anointed for this morning what are you anointed for this morning tell me tell me tell me what are you anointed for this morning [Applause] every day he's coming to church old man who are you coming to church for i come to see christ old man we'll be giving you a rocking chair for retirement i still communistic christ old man we improve on your bed home relax he said no one day one day every day on the expectation because you have revelation he knows he's not going to die until he sees the christ and hear what david said i shall not die but live to declare the works of the lord the lord are chasing me sure but he has not given me over under death so don't complain stand up like a man you're gonna make it stand up like a man you're gonna break out stand up like a man [Applause] come on you royal seat of abraham don't stagger don't give up [Applause] [Applause] don't ever think your prayers means nothing because when john began to praise his prayer his prayers was breaking dimensions pray prayers praises something else prayer is something else you know prayer can stop and earth and hit heaven and you don't even know when it hits heaven's door but when god hears it he says yes you know i've heard the people are desperate they really want a revival the freddie want the holy ghost they really want the supernatural to break amongst them they are hungry for god i feel it this morning there's a test in the camp i love it any preacher going to love this i feel a deep calling to a deep i feel you're groaning in spirit i feel the abilities about the comfort when zion travail zion brought fought all glory to god is a travailing zion there's got to come as travail in zion [Applause] [Music] you wanna be seated the world worries because i don't know what he done or will do but don't have nothing to do with what we get to do what he don't know what they do don't know how to do but what the bride have to do the bride have to do oh we have some some heavy stuff this morning hallelujah praise god praise god hallelujah hallelujah and then he went further to say my as certain as i stand on the platform tonight i had the revelation that will reveal of that seventh seal it is in a three-fold manner and i will speak to you of enough of a fold of it he said what happened is that those seven thunders that he heard thunder i was forbidden to write what's the mystery lane those seven consecutive thunders rolling out oh harlow the mystery under the seventh seal seven thunders that the devil knows nothing about it was silent so he can't interpret it he has no revelation of it he don't understand it he can't connect with it so anytime you talk about thunders he's totally confused his cabeza can't handle that his spirit can handle that hallelujah praise god but the bride could handle that because that restores her image and the likeness of god back into a bride that is what make her a super race and a super church and the super people they're going to be amazed at the confidence that god put in your spirit and in your heart but they're gonna take note that you have been with jesus because what jesus did you'll be doing the same thing too these things jesus began and continued to do hallelujah if the first church wrote a book of acts and next to sky write books i will say it again if the first church wrote a book of acts we can be writing books and reading books we have to write another book of acts book of acts means shaking off the snake in the fire not going to the doctor and say oh god there you go there like a snake bite me no no shake it off and the snake good is dead he dead fire kill him shake it off when the snake bites everybody looking for the dead look at me they give up looking at the write-off right then you're off before they're trying to write you off they want to write you off but god didn't write you off god put your name down in the book that's why the devil he's exposed this morning don't believe you're just ordained to get sick and die don't accept that don't accept that let god sign you off not let it ever sign you don't ever take what the devil tell you you're sick you can't make it this far breaking this door close that door closed well you close the doors and you can open any door you close the only door that you can't open it with god that god's shot don't let the devil shut not off for you let god open the door he's a waymaker [Applause] so brother berlin i believe we are so close to the coming of the lord jesus it behooves us to do all that we possibly can to bring every soul to the kingdom and to bring the kingdom to the people that we might be healed of our spirit and i believe that the body of jesus is the sickest body i know of the spiritual body of christ on earth is very sick so do you talk about physical healing but what about the healing of your soul of your mind of your past of your sins to be released from your guilt and you can't get out your own condemnation and can't condemn the rot you were in how do you get out of it how do you pull out of it they cry and seem like god not hearing you you cry you're called you pray and see my god is silent but god is not silent as if you're doing nothing amen i believe in my heart that's his response has to do with your response amen isn't that right praise god that woman told us that if i could just touch the hem of his garment i made hole she pressed away and she was made home isn't that right one time a baby brown was pretty the baby was raised from the dead next woman she heard about that baby recently that her baby was dead and she went to the convention she went to the meeting and she pressed away she passed her leg she pushed she pushed she pushed and brother bannon tell somebody go down and pray for she doesn't know who she doesn't know who i am and eventually she pressed away so much her faith was present it's not just her physical body person her faith is what was pushing her her faith went up the hill her faith break that dimension of time and went into that higher dimension heaven dropped down a vision on brother branham saw the baby smiling and that woman who was at the back had to come to the front he said bring that baby to me and the baby was raised from the dead why because feet broke through and caught heaven's attention you see faith heaven must respond to faith must it's compulsory heaven cannot ignore faith faith is like racket in heaven faith is a heavy noise that interrupt what's going on in heaven when them through a voice our god is able to deliver us but if we really deliver us we will not bow down listen one word bomb said the angel angel who handles water wanted to go down to out the fire next angel want to do this that angel everybody offering assistance god said no this is too much i go now myself [Applause] he was the fourth man in the fire listen that fate was above he joined them in the fire fire can't burn them they say we put down three but we see in four that's the supernatural that's a supernatural my god sometimes your husband fire wi-fi children fire family fire bonnie fire all kind of flash under burning up but lord have mercy i see another one in the fire praise god more more more than you bigger than you something lifting you up something raising you up you couldn't lift yourself up no but something somebody created and you lift you up oh give the lord some praises people that's what you have to do you had to worship him when it sound good give a shout when a song great let's give a god a praise offering when something strike your soul say hallelujah and you are bringing angels closer to you and as your praises go up his glory will come down upon your life atmosphere right now angel's descending right now right now glory to god amen hallelujah glory to god amen praise god so there's a vast difference between a christian and a holy ghost-filled christian isn't that right the first place is a christian professor to be a christian but if this christian has not yet been filled with the holy ghost he's only in the process of being a christian he is professed to believe it he's working to it but god has not given him the spirit of the holy ghost he has not yet reached that goal with god that god recognized it and abraham found abraham was faithful to the promise that god gave him that he will have a child and god here we go confirm his fate by giving him a sign a sign of circumcision which is a type of the holy spirit he said you talk to me you let me talk to a man two minutes i could tell you whether he received the holy ghost or not you so can you it separates them it's a mark you are so different when the holy spirit comes on you until the mind of this world don't like you they're against you they want nothing to do with you at all you're born of another world listen you are just as much alien listen ten times more alien you will be if you go to the far flung regions of african jungle you're ten times more alien than that you are different when the holy spirit comes it's a mark among the people so you are a alien amen you from outer space before there was a moon before there was a star before there was a molecule you from back there [Applause] so you belong to a higher order [Applause] you belong to a god class [Music] i see some of you looking you look like you wonder if this thing is really true you know some of you watching me with unbelief you're looking at me like sarah but i still believe for you [Applause] outer space aliens higher order god different people all together look at peter curse deny christ run cry hide on himself but when the holy ghost came upon the seed here we go that was in peter [Applause] and change him all of a sudden that cuss bud that man who cursed and swear and a writer 50 days ago that man could say silver and gold i don't have because where i come from don't even need silver and gold and the power that i'm empowered with didn't come by silver but what i have such as i have i give it unto you rise up and walk in the name of jesus and i tell you rise out of your depression come out of your frustration in the name of jesus receive your breakthrough you may be seated hallelujah glory because jesus did not bypass his theophany because jesus came from thought toward the flesh he knew all things so he knew he belonged to that god class higher class superman hallelujah god himself word made flesh so you have to let the brothers know they come from that same class too but they couldn't reveal it to them you have to come back from the father the spirit so he said i will not leave you comfortless i'm gonna come to you listen while the world see at me no more but you are going to see me because i am going to be with you even in you come on now come on now come on now come on now oh hallelujah to introduce this god class you may be seated he began to do some works and when he brought as punishment to disciples he said don't worry the same works i do shall you do also because you don't know it yet but at that day you want to know i am in the father you are in me and i am you you belong to that same god class [Applause] oh help me jesus and that's why the bible said if that same spirit that raised christ from the dead dwelling you it's gonna quicken your mortal body if that same spirit oh help me preach somebody if that same spirit [Applause] oh glory hallelujah what about him said right now he said your geophone is near by you and you're getting a charge from it yeah yeah yeah your own angel charging you your theophany anointing you like a charge going to battery you are being charged up this morning you're going to be running devils the lord has given you the victory shout for the lord i've given you the city [Applause] let me see then [Applause] job had no bible joe had no service he had no elders or some leaders he just had inspiration job was under a test not caused by himself he didn't start it he didn't invite it he didn't ask god for it it just came because god told the devil there's a man on the earth there's none like him have you considered him because i've got something in him that you cannot take out come on now and i say i say today there is something in you that that devil just can't take out [Applause] [Applause] you might be seated that's why that's right brother brown says god's love is that parental love you love your child love your child and my baby and whatnot that's not the kind of love god has his approval is in christ beloved so he could put you in the lion's den that's love he can put you in fire but that's love as long as in christ you're find what shall separate me from the love of god that's in christ jesus trials testaments tribulations [Applause] that's the reason why i sing that's the reason i shout because of him because of christ hallelujah that's the reason i stand my god hallelujah there's power in the blood there is wonder working power in the blood what can wash away my sin nothing but the blood of jesus what can make me whole again nothing but the blood of jesus oh precious is the flow that makes me white has nothing but the blood of jesus oh let's give him some worship [Applause] oh [Applause] hello [Applause] the intellectual will get a lot of fight with the service like this too much atmosphere noise no problem with noise in carnival there's no problem noise and fat then probably noise in the football that probably noise is a cricket and all the stadium and all these sports other problems that noise this noise there's a problem because you present god you're praising who you can't see that's faith you're worshiping and you're never seen that's faith you're saying amen to a word that of the promise that's faith [Applause] listen the political son was putting on sun he was always a son he wasn't cousin he wasn't this that nephew he was the man's son he's backstage but he's still a son he have cuckoo friends but he's still a son in a country atmosphere but he said a son once a son always a son take that dead [Applause] [Applause] you may be foolish don't ask me the distinguished difference don't try that [Music] man take his money and go on pick her doesn't go on spend it out run it out everything else wine money woman and son until he end up eating pig food shame shame they're right back home you can't use whatsapp text not me talking to nobody you have no money to put in his cell phone shame he can't call nobody all you have is he laughs good clothes nobody seem really going to pick them every time he spot him is the last clothes he have they couldn't pick them until he decided to watch the pigs and say this doesn't make no sense and i trust some of you come to that spot this morning that you tell yourself your life doesn't make no sense you're getting old where you want to go what the hell does that make no sense come on the devil hell and that largest mouth why you want to go there and have a hell you know oh your hell is reeling them just as that means real hell is real enough people don't talk about hell much but hell is just as real that son said i will arise i will say to my father all the excuse done but people they they're like excuse actually not me not me not me no me she see everybody else but then i will say i will go i'm going back you should want to go back listen your spirit your spiritual ball man that's not the real you you know oh sit down sit down a minute let me just get done inside right here you feel like you are you you're real you is faith virtue knowledge let me go here we go that's your spirit [Applause] your hot temper that is temporary your anger spells and it gets upset and making this oh that's that's temporary [Applause] jacob was a trickster jacob was that skullduggery guy every trick in the book jacob no one jacob handling as well your chicken father mother brother anybody you could be family and all you're smart and everybody that's jacob smart man but god let him run his run until god ready for him the bible said jacob was caught alone that's the problem with some of you you're not alone yet gonna catch in the corner yet you have plenty friends and people could talk and keep in a different kind of atmosphere but god caught him alone no wife no children he alone and he know he had a brother the face and his brother wanted to take his truth and jacob frightened because when you come to natural now we brought up blessed and multiplying and everything else just like he so he can't say brother you know you did any help the person no you need money no i have already you need the car house i have that too i want to deal with you okay brother so jacob trembling jacob had a call to get a call in heaven upstairs jesus said lord i can't handle this this is pressure amen i want you to intervene i am your son jacob the one who get the birthright is that a claim i'm a right to have access to you you can't deny me i will not be denied so angels got dispatched the minister to the son who need help a help call on the line sos on the line hallelujah calling her desk calling technical support [Applause] hallelujah praise god angel come down and jacob holding on to the angel now this is where the thing got deep now what in that man could hold on to the angel you see he said some words that was dangerous he said i will not let you go till you bless me i will not yo you have to be serious you know and you can't be jumping on piano because boom you faint and you out and no blessing no we're not talking about that yeah i will not let you go till they bless me and our battle started listen not not the devil and his angel you know this is jacob and the angel because he said not the angel said anything jacob is the one who spoke he said you're not leaving here if we had to go down all night long if we had to hang in there if we had to pray all night long if we had to seek you all night long my god i need some prayer i need to be changed i need a new walk how many feel that way this morning i need a new talk [Applause] when jacob finish angels say it's coming day i have to go because you'll bless me now then you could go if you want angel touch him i like that a man locked down the angel and said bless me and when he get his blessing so he's had to walk a little bit on a limb no he was ready what what's the difference he could face anything now he could face he could your brothers could multiply in front of him he died nothing because he met the angel when you meet god man just what is man what the blue man when you meet god what can i do with man and human you say so much a humor for the last 50 years human but when you meet god it's a different thing here come jacob he's changed now he's a new name he knows his name is changed god briefly led to him you shall no longer be jacob you will be israel oh hallelujah and you're going to have 12 sons and that's already 12 tribes of israel and that's why you get israel as a people because a man wrestles with god got a name change a nation is born 12 tribes ephraim judah god hallelujah ruben all the different tribes 12 tribes of israel isn't that wonderful how that came about a man wrestled with god how you will tell that man what you did under jacob anointing but jacob you do so and so hello israel talk to me god class higher class don't pull me down to jacob not when the higher class has been activated in me do you not hear what i'm saying did you get that when god activate the higher call the god call in your spirit in your heart it has nothing to do with what backed here [Music] [Applause] listen do you understand how clear moses could go back to egypt when he run 40 years when he met the pillar of fire you see how easy it was for moses to go back without even studying whether they have a writ out famous warrant arrest for murdering a man he had nothing to do with that the higher calling was activated in moses so god tell moses you'll be god everyone will be your prophet a man who killed a man i run away come back and play in god acting on god's behalf so when he was already saying let there be flies and flies pelting out just like god let there be light let there be frogs and fox coming on coming out of his mouth because he's a higher class he's a god class look moses god gave him a return ticket to bring the people to this mountain he said look the ticket here you're going and you're coming back guaranteed [Applause] and when you bring them out the red sea in front of them mountains on both sides and pharaoh changed his mind i decided to come after them i'm some of them unbelieving brethren always always brethren whom missing egypt missing these tires that are complaining about those bring us to the dead look feral coming behind us and you know there's caring already when people say they're currently negative it brings a spirit it brings that atmosphere it brings that influence upon you that is why be careful who your friends are be careful hopes what they're speaking they could speak negative and create atmosphere negative around you moses get caught up in that and begin to go and make you rock and begin to cry oh god oh god oh god help me jesus brahms is going to kick him god say why cry unto me speak and move forward he always don't go back to that lower class stay in the god class [Applause] stand still and see the salvation of the lord [Applause] hallelujah stretch for a rut my god look the power coming up open up the red sea and the people seeing dry ground because the same man that was crying was the same man that come back speaking speak do i hear them something amen don't let the tears fool you you may be seasoned jesus jesus see at the tomb lazarus he cried he wept below the empties fool you that was that was that was before but when he got activated even now whatever you are saying i am the resurrection in life and he's actually annoying some promises that that never came out before nobody ever pulled that out of the book before i am the resurrection and the life he that believe it on me though he would dead yet shall he live believers doubt this where have you laid him that's the god class that's the different level coming out now that's the anointing of god creating such an atmosphere to make the son of god speak lazarus come forth oh my come on you daughters come on you daughters of zion come on you sons of god you belong to a different class a higher class oh glory to god praise be to jesus that god classmate jesus take five loads and two fishes and pray bless it and multiply it that's what we're talking about oh glory to god that's that god class peter fish all night and caught nothing that god class tell them go and cast a net on the right side fish gonna be there power gonna be there your blessing gonna be dear i know you worked there all night long but this is a word from the lord present tense [Applause] things hasn't worked out all night long the fishing all night long and jesus woke up and said cast your net to the right side and they just did it and that actually helped to collect the fish that was there mike you talk about a life of faith a life of power oh glory to god i don't know we are the kind of clothes of somewhere here but so many stupid but listen this you will be seated peter was in prison and the saints were praying for peter they were covering peter with their prayer asking for peter deliverance it was the prayers of the saints it was going up to god your single prayer like a little note but when it's come together it makes a harmony it strikes a chord it plays a tune to god when the saints were praying and prayer went up to god on behalf of peter the kids open up because of the prayers of the saints that's the power of the prayer of the saints it could open my prison bars what are you doing you're sticking if you're not praying you're holding back blessings you're holding back powers you're holding back the anointing not praying not praying don't wait for somebody to pray for you you pray for somebody get a burden see somebody put get a breakthrough because you are praying sometimes god is a weaker but around the prayer for this one and pray for that one and that's the prayer that god using to respond to different things oh hallelujah and to show you something peter come at the door somebody people it's peter they said no it's his angel prayer answered and they didn't even they they even they're not even ready to believe that the prayer being answered they praying for peter become other prisoner he just ought a prisoner and he said no is his angel peter go on i'm gonna beat you for you something hallelujah god answer the prayer the prayer in front of the door free oh they shall be expecting it but they say no oh hallelujah could you take some more oh blessed be the name of the lord praise his wonderful name so the holy spirit is your assurance is your protection is your witness it's your seal it's your sign oh blessed be the name of the lord now he doesn't deal with the church as a group of people he deals with the truth as individuals each individual in the church and now it's got to a time there's no secret here we go we all see it when a man proves and god loves him he takes him out somewhere to himself and dear in the front of angel he does something for him he lifts him up and there in the presence of god gives him and fills them and sets him out that's the age we are living in that god taking his sons and daughters and blessing them and you can't do nothing about it it's just god hand upon that person's life the same holy spirit that saved the lutherans signify the methodists baptized the pentecostal is now setting in order the coming of the lord jesus when it will be so powerful that body will come into this group of church will draw the rest of them from the grave that and there'll be a resurrection that is what the holy ghost was given for it wasn't given forth just to say we have the holy ghost it was given for a purpose to bring perfection to bring on the resurrection that is what god released his spirit full what is the holy ghost without us the economy made perfect they live in one day under that we live in another day when the enemy comes like a flood the spirit of god raises standards against it the spirit of god raises the standard what is it he's pouring in the spirit then those were arrested in the grave under the altar saying crying how long lord how long how much longer god is waiting on me and you the church is waiting on me a new adoption time when god can point to us his fullness his power his resurrection here we go and when the church and christ become so close till christ becomes visible among us and raises the dead so it's not you raising the dead it's christ coming visible among us and raising the dead hallelujah because christ does all three the shout the voice and the trump christ among god people so we're creating a tabernacle a house a dwelling place for him to come in step into it we become the capstone bride the magnet bride for christ to step into it to pull up the grave all the rest of the grave oh hallelujah oh praise as long as god's other people go got a bunch a church god's got a holy ghost matching with it and god gave the holy ghost intellectuals would rise always have but god got a minority somewhere he's got a church that'll move right on with the baptism of the holy ghost and claim in the light your testimony today will make judgment against this city our testimony is the baptism of the holy ghost and the power of god a holy life will bring judgment against this city what do you need the holy ghost for what is for is to give you power of prayer power of speech power for a holy life that is what the holy ghost is given for power of prayer power of speech power for holy life isn't that right some people say i can't quit drinking i can't quit this the holy ghost comes to live in you to make all these cans get away from you or what you can't do the holy spirit will show you what you could do isn't that right it will make their mind turn your head from them half naked woman and quit lusting after them it will it's the quit making you smoke and drink and be warned to be a big shot it will take that out of you it will humble you when you do that it will quit making you want to marry somebody else's wife that's what it is it was to make you live a holy life you say i can't do it i just can't do it you can't you sure you can't but the holy ghost come for that purpose to take it to take it out of you take all the old habits and things that you're doing the old back biting separating yourself in bless god i'm a methodist i would have nothing to do with them holy rollers the holy spirit is out to you come think about it now we are preaching holy ghost we are preaching fire we are preaching the power of god and people don't want to even interfere associated with us that's crazy we're going to have where i'm going think about it now hallelujah are you going to glory when the press begin to move you think the devil asking what church you belong to is the elect you know understand is the catholic and the protestants will get together to form the image unto the beast to form the union you have to belong to it can't buy yourself unless you take the mark of the beast so the electic will be completely different no compromise with the word god will not apologize to sonoma and gomorrah gordon make adam and stevie make adam and eve no compromise whatsoever it's just the word of god hallelujah isn't that right praise the name of the lord i'm a baptist i'm a presbyterian i wouldn't go to that old holy water bunch the holy ghost come to take this touch out of you and wash you in the blood here we go it's to give unction to the preacher [Music] so you have to see unction on the preacher virtue power upon the preacher that's what the holy ghost is supposed to do no no dry intellectual lecture stuff no unction come to the preacher power of speech power to preach power to teach power of prayer power to witness christ that is the purpose of the holy ghost function to the preacher is to give holiness to the group here we go is to set the church in order it's to bring the unity of the spirit it's to unite us together with power leopard convention and books on taste with power power pull you power upon me we get united oh glory to god how many believe that you're inspired on your job you're inspired in school you're inspired when you go home you're anointed with god look what iran was praying for a woman uh praying in a prayer line a woman came up with a baby and the testimony was something like this he said baby's already healed the woman next to the woman when she was sitting down fell left to pray for that baby and she prayed for that baby her prayer god honor the prayer of that woman for that child brother branham said god knew that woman had more compassion than him to pray for that child so see what god using that you could step into somebody's shoes and feel their pain and then effectively minister to them in prayer and spirit is not a mechanical thing it's a hard thing you know how hard it was be for that woman caught in adultery in the very act do you know the shame and the embarrassment she must have felt by all these high priest looking men with all the long gong and whatnot and had the insights in and who was outside you know jesus felt dealing with that whole scenario he turned his back on them and right in the sun he gave them a chance to leave one by one he knew they would leave because he dropped the picture on them in the mirror and said look at all his elves take a peek if you like where you see all right you big stone when they look so they couldn't handle what they're seeing what's the mirror you put check yourself out first and they couldn't handle it they walk away so you could understand how the compassion that jesus dealt with to deal with that woman to tell a woman neither do i commit then condemn thee go and sin no more you could understand how he was reaching out to the woman out of the world you can understand how he caught a blind batimus you can understand and and it's interesting because a blind man come to him and jesus what will you want me to do for you and a man blind like a bat and you could see that but he still wanted to come out your mouth what do you want me to do for you lord to receive my sight that's what he wanted to hear be the hole go and see receive your sight receive your deliverance receive your breakthrough receive your healing receive your victory receive your comfort hallelujah glory hallelujah so the breastplate of aram aaron called human thumb had 12 stones and isaac shared it with you and anytime somebody got a dream of vision they would bring it and speak it the stones would blood dormant dead nothing but when you speak it a supernatural light used to glow like a rainbow light to say that's god so that's how they knew the dream or the vision of the prophecy was of god if somebody speak it and nothing happened thumbs down and that one so but i'm saying here now if that supernatural light and the human torment did not flash it was rejected because god was not in it i want you to hear listen any message regardless if it's from priests from preacher from prophet or anything else any man no matter how spiritual what his office is what he has done if he raised the dead if he healed the sick if he's the archbishop of canterbury if he's the pope of rome if he's the head of any denomination no matter how spiritual though he has spoken tongues dance in the spirit to all he preached the gospel no matter what he has done if his message doesn't come up the bible it's wrong [Applause] this is god's human family [Music] so the iran priesthood has done over it but we still have our human tongue which is the bible it has to flash isn't that right it's all a dream okay whatever he saw the secret like okay skip that down praise the name of the lord so he can't be one quote here it has to be lined up online it hasn't reached the scriptures to bring out the whole picture isn't that right oh my hallelujah the holy ghost ought to be more important to you than everything else there is in the world your prestige your life your job you anything that there is you should not cease until you have it you must receive it it must be the most you say well i'm afraid they're at my work i'm afraid that my husband don't be afraid that be the first place to let everything else go i expect to get it one of these days brother branham no not one of these days no this is the time let it be first before you before i do everything else let me have it now praise god desperate you get desperate you already got to have it or die oh blessed be the name of the lord praise be to jesus that's what the holy ghost supposed to mean to you isn't that right now joshua to divide the land what if he liked the tribe of god better than the tribe of benjamin driver ephraim what did he like to try but joseph better than judah he didn't do it that way he divided it according to the word revealed by the spirit he divided it according to tribe and notice he done it by revelation by the deserement of god's spirit each one of those hebrew mothers giving birth to those babies called their name and each one of their name had a meaning jacob when he was born being a twin she called him a planter but when he got overcoming power his name was changed a prince isn't that right and when the the creating each one of those hebrew mothers in their travailing and childbirth called the name of reuben and placed him positionally in palestine so the child birth the travail brought out the name has to place them and before we leave here you have to be placed so it will take some travel to positionally place you [Applause] it will take more than just a man it will literally take a travel [Music] you must want your position you must desire your place in christ we're not talking about the position of the church at this electricity or something we're not talking about that that's easy we're talking about place in christ because in your place you have faith in your place you have power in your place you are you anointed in your place you're not in anybody's business you can't be jealous or envious of anybody you are comfortable in your position because that is what god did for you [Applause] mary oh this was good mary didn't wait for a feeling you know when the angels are healed mary highly favored lord is with thee she know the promises all the virgins all them sisters hearing me promise version shall conceive angel drop down and hit mary with a word of promise she said be done unto me according to thy word there was something not ready to receive the word for the angel she didn't wait to feel a sign to have a sign a pregnancy or anything like that no she ran to tell elizabeth i'm gonna have a baby angel said so no feelings no evidence no witness no tests just the angel said she believed and it was so when she called the name jesus john and elizabeth boom jump up and bowl hallelujah that baby that wasn't moving along got quickened by the name of jesus when am i going to come to that spot where you can receive the word from the angel that your family is delivered your city is already taken already it's already given you just have to take it now when you go back home tell yourself it's a lie you see him everything negative is lies you believe what court said you're going to have that victory right in your house right in your home you don't want that victim nowhere else you're not running from your trial go take me out what kind of trial is that go back to luther today with that ask god to take him back to wesley ask for transfer you know god will say too late all the bright members have taken up in those ages already so if you go back now you can be right you're not going back it's not a time travel and space traveling you have to travel this way raptor travel you're going forward so god put you on the earth knowing that you have the gift and the ability to deal with the present challenging circumstance stop complaining start to begin to praise and worship god things might be bad but it could have been worse thank you jesus hallelujah i told my other morning say i'm mary i'm alive thank you lord you wouldn't want to wake up there you can't wake up dead right oh but you wake up and you say i'm alive you could raise your hands you could praise god you're still in the land of the living you're still dead to give the devil a whack you still could anoint pray in the morning and faith in the morning when you're tired pray your faith forget about yourself you pray for your children you pray for your family you pray for believers and pray for people you know see for the first time and you're asking god blessing upon them you pray that god do something praise god in your life god sent a revival you want a hunger in your spirit you want that taste in your soul oh glory that's a great thing you know as the heart pound after the water broke so my soul tastes after the living god oh it's a glorious thing to know after 30 50 years you're still testing for god that's how i feel this morning hungry for god my god i'm about to get started i ain't get started yet praise god are you striving trying to get started what is this we're going to get this thing turning oh hallelujah praise god i hope i could get turned in before i get too old so bad abraham says that's the name ephraim cornraiser so this one gone positioning land here and that land good for raising corn he's a corn specialist this one here is in cattle cattle specialist isn't that right other one she put up now watch a beautiful type today of what we need at joshua for today the trouble today when we come into the promised land god want to raise sheep like ephraim and and and god is a cattleman but he finds ephraim sheep looking real nice every man one wants to raise something like the other every man wants this to be the same let god give one man a gift for healing every man wants to give a healing ephraim and god all of them wants to mix all up and come as one but we are divided in our position that's why all the attempts to bring unity and unity has failed because unity is not coming that way it's not unity it's unity of defeat and the faith is personal you don't have a general faith with it it's defeat and defeat is christ in you that's a peter that's why in the book of acts nobody asked for bishop permission like how would evangelist philip leave the whole uh uh uh program i'm going to each he asked bishop please could i leave now he was translated to minister to that man nobody signed up to say well bishop should i should i stephen i asked that question um you think i should preach to them rascals out there stephen but you stiff neck and i'm circumcised of heart he was a deacon he didn't get a sign now singing a certificate of preaching he give it out that was the book of acts men of god speaking the word and they're being led and directed by god when paul shipped wrecking and saying i am not supposed to have a ship right because i am paul i am the apostle i am prophet paul it happened and you have to deal with it isn't that right oh praise god so we don't all have gift of wisdom we don't all prophesy we do not speak with tongues we are not all the same god give people separate gifts and talents and so on isn't that right oh glory to god to the east side praise god was judah isn't that right you say watch the ten commandments on the west side praise god ephraim praise be to jesus dan was the north side judah was the east side the salt was ruben and the the west was ephraim and that represented north side then was the eagle judah the east represented the lion the salt reuben represented the man and ephraim represented the ox and that is what was in the book of revelation the four beasts faced like a man feels like an ox feels like an eagle he's like a man and they were guarding the throne they were around the throne that's how god put them on the earth the tribes god in the ark just please just as was in heaven o praise the name of the lord isn't that something else praise god hallelujah let's go they were guarding the mercy seat and here's why praise god but abandoned even then says that the same thing applied go he was running wrong because he said matthew mark luke and john they got the book of acts here come the man again the eagle the ox praise god and the lion isn't that right matthew mark luke and john they got the book of acts hallelujah praise god the acts is what the acts of the apostle is the acts of the holy ghost in the apostles when the holy ghost get into the church is not big me and little you is till we all come into the unity of the faith into the son of god into the statue of a perfect man so there's not some preacher up there sometimes some some some high up somewhere and the people don't get low low i either send some trippings to them you know i mean like like man no no no no no no the veil is rent and you have access to that manner you have access to that blessing you have access oh do you believe that praise the name of the lord hallelujah praise god thank you jesus so barbara was praying he said let us pray heavenly father i pray [Music] that you will help this audience help me i help this audience no matter how much i would believe they have got to believe too cause here we go it's their fate that operates your presence that gets from you whatsoever they desire okay i'm gonna wrap up wow i'm only halfway through so let's see all right so here what he said you went he's praying he's praying listen his prayer you went to your own country full without measure the fullness of the goddess bodily and men and women didn't believe you he's uneducated where did he get his schooling where did he come from where does wisdom come from isn't his father with us the carpenter his mother is brother and sister they all here and the bible said many mighty works he could not do because of the unbelief and that was the son of god the fullness in him and he was couldn't do much because of their unbelief hallelujah and you are the same yesterday today and forever god take all unbelief from us let us submit ourselves to the holy ghost and give a great time after this meeting that every sick and afflicted person be healed granted in jesus name so it's very important that you understand the atmosphere and the faith that could require of you in going forward listen to this i cannot do it no minister can do it it takes all of us together in prayer and believing trust in god to see the holy spirit continue to bless his people as you wait on his coming now a minister cannot bring a revival there's no preacher that can bring a revival he doesn't pack it with him the only thing he can do is be loyal to god in his word and the revival has to come by the people in your home in your life oh glory to god revival come by say it out say it again the revival has to come by the people that mean the people have to catch something you have to see something you have to believe something that it belongs to you it's yours oh hallelujah brother brannon from true sign overlooked he said when atomic bombs and people are scared in the pentagon it's time for elijah to rise on the scene here we go let the people let that little flock that little remnant that god will give him let that little remnant go to calling out to god and watch what happens there'll be a national showdown there'll be a power that they have never seen before the trouble of it is it'll be too late then the doors will be closed remember we are the end time prairie he prophesied that the little flock the little remnant that god gonna give that elijah going to go to calling upon god the prayers of the saints when the church when that little flock whether the remnant got to calling upon god it would be a national showdown oh glory to god something going to move upon the people to push them to call upon god oh hallelujah hallelujah wait till that begin to call upon god then he said wait till them seven thunders utter their voices to that group who can really take the word and hand it dear it will slice and cut they can shut the heavens they can do whatever they want to do oh glory to god the thunders yes when they call upon god oh glory to god do you believe that oh brother give me a church full of the holy ghost god will do it one year what all theology failed to do in two thousand years you wait till the indulgence of the church while you strike home to that little remnant after the doors of the gentile is closed god will anoint the church then oh hallelujah he was filthy be filthy still he was righteous and righteous still god anointed the power of god and things will be taken place hallelujah do you believe that how many believe that the doors of the gentiles will be closed god going to anoint the church with power i can't stop now i'm in the middle put of something in prayer in a contest listen to this prayer raise up mighty men raise the mighty warriors of the faith oh hallelujah hallelujah that was his prayer the prophet is gone where are those mighty men where are those warriors of the faith when daniel prophesied the people that know their god shall do great exploits not just read books and tapes not just being a message no you can't exploit our exploits of faith the sixth sense and demonstration [Applause] come on now we're not preaching word only we preaching there's power and demonstration of the gospel [Applause] what god is waiting for god is trying to place his church in position to manifest himself getting one he can work through and say dear is my spirit flowing freely i can work here i can place him get another one maybe he could start maybe he could start here maybe he could start today that god could place one that god could say i could send my spirit my spirit can flow freely unhindered channel no politics no sin no unbelief just a pipe the spirit can flow through [Applause] glory to god glory so whenever god expressed himself by the word all the word listen if it's a hybrid the word gets short the spirit gets short-circuited so they can't flow because some creed or some dogma go trying to send the current and it's blow the fuse but when the current is flowing freely the word of god expresses itself that's why when the word becomes flesh the invisible becomes visible so don't tell me there is no god we had to say there is a lack of surrender to god because any man surrenders to god a man fully surrendered to god the prophet says omnipotent i'll say it again a man fully surrendered to god is omnipotent i'll say it again a man fully surrendered to god have more than thought [Applause] man fully surrendered god is omnipotent amen my god do you see how powerful that is elijah walked out there and said not even jew or reign will faulty like call for it and he shut the heavens up omnipotent speaking hallelujah a man words have any second nature that's the power we're talking about before the doctor's hand touches my wife the tumor will go down order the tumor to go down serve the tumor notice sentence the tumor [Applause] hallelujah god class higher dna super race before the doctor's hand touches my wife the tumor big like a grapefruit showing through a dress but a word spoken going past your time going past your space this is beyond science there's no explanation for that [Applause] fish die a little water little fishy eye give you back your life i as a son as a super son i as a dna gene of god i give you back your life i have the authority i have life in me i can release light inside of you oh glory to god silver and gold have i number what i have i could give a fish or if god could bring back our old fish give back what about you sitting here this morning don't tell me god can't break you out [Applause] don't complain about your husband believe god to deliver him [Applause] i'm praying about your wife complaining about your family complaining when i saw you pray desperate and cry long tears coming and crying and grown nuns and groaning asleep because you want that answer from god you will be seated there's a woman named hannah she couldn't have any children and she grown in a temple groaning and she had another sister terrorizing her yaki i have no child and this and that and that and that so hannah have pressure on both sides her own self her own condition her own depression her own frustration and plus a terrorist in church in church but she went past that she groaned she travailed her mouth was just mumbling the preacher backs in the light thought she was drunk but she was grown in and god heard her god heard her she told god if you give me your son i'll give him back to you god give us samuel oh glory oh my god god give our prophet god bless her womb and god gave her a prophet she said give my son i'll give him back to you through her groanings a true feeling god bless with more than a son god bless you with a prophet that coming to bossy lie a prophet a baby that gonna bring judgment [Applause] god not playing ibrahim said these men if they pick up this and go out with it they can make more sense to it and bring it to a place i just want to lay this seed and then hope it come to life i'm afraid men just making try to make more sense to it but he didn't stop there he said i hope in other words make more sense then what next we hear in more sense and more sense for 50 plus years what about the other part i hope they bring these seeds to life not just explanation not just talk talkification another word but to bring the seeds to life that it could thunder because i've attended that checks together did you hear what i said it doesn't mean the devil said i'm not impressed oh my almost done thank you jesus god will raise up a new system an international system by the power of god isn't that right by the power of god he said when the church get a true revelation of the two spirits working within the framework of the christian church and with god's spirit discern and withstand the antichrist spirit satan will be powerless before let me tell you there's coming at all where satan gonna be powerless powerless powerless you walk into a sick room but the ram says and the devil know the sickness no it have to go all right i just stepped into the room all them demons they're looking for the exit because a powered sun coming there holy holy lord god almighty you're walking in the spirit of power spirit of holiness all the bells around you women hallelujah [Applause] glory so they hold themselves in the upper room dry seeds oh glory to god i'm going to even give a tremendous exhortation in permitting on on on tuesday night prairie is gone and i want to bring some of the quotes from what he shared here no one can look at what they see and be a christian no one can look at what they see and be a christian you have got to believe the things that are unseen by faith you are healed not by sight not by feelings the supernatural is what you do not see but what you believe and act on through that we become so conscious of looking at one another like this but there's an unseen world greater than anything you can see the unseen world is is more real than this world because the world that came came from things that do not appear in other words a person that cancer humor a person dying but the unseen world saw that person healed so the unseen world is greater than this world and when you're put from the unseen world and bringing to this world eyes pop open death air you pop open tom begin to speak because this unseen world is more real than this world because this unsealed world could create a new world [Applause] oh my oh my didn't mean to keep it slow but listen this in this world man is continually getting worse choosing rather to walk by sight instead by faith then when he does he rubs the inner man which is the soul the eternal part of man in this world in this building there are evil spirits and war and christians anointed and the angels of god and camp around them to energize them with faith and here i am standing here yielding myself and the holy spirit is moving this is what you call heavenly places so when you come to church you come to be energized when you praise somebody behind you not praising god your anointing start to sweep and be all around them the whole armor of god is supernatural love joy peace long suffering gentleness meekness in the holy ghost all of that is unseen life faith joy peace all of that is unseen every arm of the is looking at the unseen the whole armor of god is supernatural if you look at your crippled hand if you look at your tumor it will remain that way look away from that and look to the promise of god dania was looking at the unseen when he went to the lions there the two huber boys are going to be unseen when they fire furnace if you're watching fiery furnace you've got a ball oh god but when you look at the unseen you say my god if my god to deliver i'm still not going to bow down i'm going to go as long as god is leading i'm going to go he's going to lead me up the mountain he's going to leave me down the valley he can leave me over the hill wherever he's going to go he's going to lead me isn't that right oh glory to god hallelujah hallelujah the sixth sense that sense of faith is what made the resty push back that sixth sense raised the dead by this success mighty miracles are be performed it's the most powerful force on earth your fifth sense delays within your brain but your sixth sense lays in your heart your five senses lays in your brains but this sixth sense come on give the lord a shout you're almost done that success leaves inside your heart guide your heart guide your heart guide your heart don't let no bitterness don't let envy and evil guard your heart because there is where that sick sense got the thunder oh hallelujah glory to god because of the sixth sense the lands could need daniel they couldn't get near him because that sixes were the supersense that same sixth sense the three voice was thrown in the fiery furnace and all reasoning could have proven that we were going to death but at six and stayed for two three hours it's that same sixth sense that have a peter paul laying in jail and we're going to be headed next day but down in mark's house they had a prayer meeting and the sixth sense here we go begin to accumulate around the jail where he was covered by prayer it was the prayers of the saints loose in the sixth sense and they created atmosphere around the prison they wanted cut off brother peter head next day but the sick sense of faith bust that prison open and lose peter from that prison and the devil won the cut off your head but today we come to guaranteeing you and with the prayers of the saints praise god to raise you out of that atmosphere that you're in oh glory to god it was the sixth sense that raised jesus from the dead after he laid in the ground he believed the word of god destroyed his body in three days i would raise it up but he is going down but i will raise it up because the sixth sense was built in oh give the lord some praises people hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah and the prophet said the sixth sense oh god pour it out on me give it to me give it to everyone who needs it paul dies sixth sense into me lord [Applause] oh glory to god hallelujah i think that no church in his practice no matter how intellectual and fundamental it might be that church cannot strive until the supernatural is made known among the people and they see it amen just a foreign hallelujah from a true sign overlook and the torture man many wonders why would those things be necessary for man to go through it's because talk about the prophets it's because people won't read the word and they won't pray so god is sovereign he sends his prophet to be a sign the people won't read they don't care to read they don't pray because they have other things to do they can't take time to pray and the bible is awesome to them it hasn't got enough action for them these days god here we go wants his people to pray and when israel got so taxed in such a condition that they could not go any further their time was fulfilled and their burden lived further than they thought they begin to pray and when the people begin to pray then god begins to hear it was time for the word of god to be fulfilled and ahmad yoshid saw it was time for god to be for word to be fulfilled they went to prayer to god and usually those who pray is the one who got the burden and i want to get something is hoopery that's ordained of god to do so watch let them all break down the prejudice and say we'll all forget our creeds and cataclysm everything else isn't it strange that god wants the people to have a part into it the prayers of the saints isn't it strange here why when jesus looked up to the harvest he said the harvest is right the laborers are few you pray the lord of the harvest that's was him you pray to me that i will send laborers into the harvest it is some part you have to do god here we go are you ready church is everybody up and alive god is waiting for his church to call on him everybody didn't hear that because then he thinks i got 100 amen god is waiting on his church to call on him he always did it god is waiting today for the people to call his servants into action the servant can't get into action until the people pray [Music] [Applause] [Music] i'm not hearing you i'm not hearing you do you want the church do you want the servant of god to come into action then you have to have the prayers of the saints and there's a vile there's a container to hold your prayer it's like incense unto god [Applause] we're looking forward for a great time in the lord with your prayers i'm sure we'll do the best we can for the glory of god prayer changes things prayer changes death to life prayer changes sickness to health sinners to saints it's prayer you may laugh too much you may shout too much you may eat too much but you will never pray too much the bible said i would that man would pray may the lord bless you pray for me god bless you [Applause] thank you jesus glory be to god oh hallelujah how many appreciate the word today i want to appreciate the message this morning oh hallelujah hallelujah i want you to know greet your brother to non-creature system [Music] oh it's coming down down down it's coming down well yes the spirit of the law is coming down oh and when the saints begin to pray for the lord to have his way then the spirit of the lord is coming down oh oh begin to pray oh [Applause] it's coming [Music] oh jesus [Music] oh oh right now oh lift him up oh me [Music] let the church [Music] say man [Music] [Music] blessed times you're free that's what we picked up we pray bless the people as they give lord follow me i bless them provide for them and jesus let me pray and ask [Music] [Music] oh at the church say amen won't let the church say amen [Music] [Applause] amen one more time take me amen [Music] amen to the world amen to the spirit amen to the holy ghost amen to every promise amen give him glory give him honor give him thanks at the remembrance of his holiness oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah give him praise oh give him praise give him praise praise him at your whole heart oh hallelujah hallelujah yes lord jesus hallelujah oh yes lord jesus hallelujah oh hallelujah give him praise come on now yeah yeah oh it sounds good to see hallelujah [Music] [Music] let the church let the church see amen
