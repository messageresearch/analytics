[13:14] and uh to be in fellowship
[13:17] around the word of god and to focus on
[13:19] the scripture
[13:21] and uh even if you're here tonight and
[13:24] it's not
[13:25] just based on zeal or enthusiasm but
[13:27] it's based on need
[13:29] and need of a word need of an
[13:31] encouragement
[13:32] uh maybe you're here tonight and and you
[13:35] have
[13:36] simply tied a knot in the rope of life
[13:38] and you're hanging on for their life
[13:40] you know looking for an answer to a
[13:42] pressing situation or pressing concern
[13:45] we trust that tonight you know something
[13:47] will be said through
[13:49] god's word that will has pushed us to
[13:51] where
[13:52] where we need to go you know and uh in
[13:54] recent times you know you
[13:57] you see situations you see believers you
[14:00] see people
[14:02] and you see people in different
[14:04] positions
[14:05] different stages or spots in their
[14:08] journey
[14:09] their journey of life and
[14:12] their challenges and their unique
[14:14] situations and
[14:16] and as you ponder and as you wander and
[14:19] in recent times
[14:20] you know you know for those who would
[14:22] have been in church on sunday uh
[14:24] a certain line i was taking and you know
[14:26] i find myself
[14:27] you know going through the wood and
[14:31] thinking more thinking you know i
[14:34] realize that
[14:35] many times we don't stop to think and
[14:38] during this whole process
[14:40] of you know the bible studies for us you
[14:42] know
[14:43] one of the burdens in my heart is for us
[14:45] to pause to think
[14:47] you know many times we don't think deep
[14:50] enough
[14:51] long enough hard enough to really come
[14:54] to the root of an issue or a matter
[14:58] and i've realized that many scriptures
[15:01] and
[15:01] quotes and words that we hold there we
[15:04] know it
[15:04] as in the root we know it as in we can
[15:06] repeat it we know it
[15:08] as in we can share it we know it as we
[15:10] can even get inspiration from it
[15:12] but then i ask myself the question do we
[15:14] really understand it
[15:15] because a deep understanding of
[15:17] something only
[15:18] happens when you spend quality
[15:22] time into something you know and all of
[15:25] a sudden
[15:26] the word that was expressed to joshua to
[15:28] meditate on the word day and night
[15:31] has begun to take on a new meaning
[15:34] you know of the significance of what it
[15:36] really means
[15:37] to meditate on the word day and night
[15:40] and and that word
[15:42] meditate as i've said before is not read
[15:45] you know you could only meditate on what
[15:47] you have read you could only meditate on
[15:49] what you have heard
[15:51] you could only meditate on what you have
[15:53] studied so there has to be a distinction
[15:55] between meditating and reading and
[15:58] meditating and studying so
[16:00] my hope and my desire is that after we
[16:02] go through these
[16:03] studies of the scripture that you would
[16:06] spend quality time
[16:07] thinking about what you have heard and
[16:10] looking at it from different angles and
[16:13] perspectives and most importantly to see
[16:15] how it applies
[16:16] to our lives you know and i was sharing
[16:19] with someone yesterday
[16:21] you know i i was reading something about
[16:25] bill gates so i asked someone today do
[16:26] you know who bill gates is
[16:28] you know and they said to me yes i know
[16:29] bill gates is
[16:31] and i said do you know that bill gates
[16:33] is known
[16:34] for when he is going on a vacation
[16:37] he reads three hours every day
[16:43] you know what i was just sharing and i
[16:45] said you know it's interesting because
[16:47] when he was interviewed and they asked
[16:49] him about learning and
[16:50] reading he expressed that it was
[16:53] critical to his success
[16:55] and for those of you who know bill gates
[16:57] is the one of the founders of microsoft
[16:59] and stuff the
[17:01] what could come to your mind is after
[17:03] you have achieved certain things
[17:05] why study why read why would you want to
[17:08] keep
[17:09] learning if you have achieved you know
[17:12] and there are many i call it super
[17:15] spiritual
[17:17] you know unbalanced christians
[17:20] and the message is a safe
[17:23] haber a safe harbor harboring ground
[17:26] for people who accept mediocrity with
[17:28] the mediocrity and the approach to
[17:30] scripture mediocrity and the approach
[17:32] to studying the word mediocrity and
[17:34] their
[17:35] in their limited understanding of things
[17:37] because either
[17:38] laziness is one and and i'm and i'm
[17:41] i'm i'm challenging our thinking because
[17:45] we are limited either by our experiences
[17:48] we are limited by what we
[17:50] may have been told we are limited by so
[17:53] many things and
[17:54] and i find as i go through scripture i
[17:57] recognize that
[17:59] there's a lot that doesn't line up with
[18:02] things that we may hold true and dare
[18:04] with the way god expresses it
[18:05] you know so i'm laying that as a
[18:09] foundation for
[18:10] this encouragement tonight i'm not going
[18:12] to be too long with you but i do intend
[18:14] to challenge you tonight
[18:16] and challenge you to move from your
[18:19] current position
[18:20] to a better position move from your
[18:23] current state in your
[18:25] spiritual walk to a better state in your
[18:27] spiritual work
[18:28] and the unction has to be yours you know
[18:32] um so i have a thought tonight
[18:36] uh change your thinking change your life
[18:41] as you thought tonight change your
[18:44] thinking
[18:45] changed your life
[18:49] i believe that if your thinking is
[18:50] changed your life will change
[18:54] how we think affects our lives
[18:57] the bible says as a man think in his
[18:59] heart
[19:00] so is he so your thinking
[19:03] is connected to your life
[19:07] what you think about god affects your
[19:09] relationship with god
[19:11] what you think about church affects your
[19:14] relationship with church
[19:16] what you think about you affects your
[19:19] relationship with you
[19:20] what you think about your wife your
[19:22] family your loved ones
[19:23] your interactions your business your
[19:26] health
[19:27] your ambition your desires it affects
[19:30] you your thinking influences your life
[19:36] the bible says in romans 12
[19:40] and verse 12 and be not conformed to
[19:44] this world
[19:46] but be transformed by the renewing of
[19:48] your mind
[19:51] that you may prove what is that good
[19:54] and acceptable and perfect will of god
[19:58] i'm not going to be too long with you
[20:00] tonight because i believe
[20:01] this teaching tonight is a foundation
[20:03] for where we need
[20:04] to go but that be not conformed to this
[20:08] world
[20:09] the way to not be conformed or the the
[20:11] opposite of being conformed
[20:14] because it's followed by the word but
[20:16] and it tells you what to do instead
[20:18] so the use of the word but in scripture
[20:21] is to give you another direction
[20:23] so the alternative to being conformed to
[20:25] the world
[20:26] so so so i want you to look at the
[20:28] center and structure and be not
[20:30] conformed to this world
[20:31] but i'm giving you another pathway to
[20:33] take
[20:35] another road to take all right but be
[20:37] transformed
[20:38] by the renewing of your mind
[20:42] to a specific outcome that you may prove
[20:45] so there's something to prove so the
[20:47] changing of your mind is to
[20:49] create a proof that what that
[20:52] prove what is that good and acceptable
[20:55] and perfect will of god
[20:56] so that's the king james and during his
[20:58] teaching tonight i'm gonna move
[21:00] quite often between the king james and
[21:02] the amplified
[21:04] because the amplified gives now a
[21:06] further wrapping or context around the
[21:08] scripture
[21:09] so romans 12 2 in the amplified listen
[21:12] to how it's positioned now
[21:14] and do not be conformed to this world
[21:17] listen any longer
[21:20] with its superficial values and customs
[21:24] so it's now giving a further context to
[21:27] the definition of
[21:28] what world is for us all right and do
[21:31] not be conformed to this world
[21:33] any longer with its superficial values
[21:36] and customs
[21:37] the word superficial is when something
[21:40] is is not real
[21:43] all right superficial right but be
[21:47] be transformed listen to the amplified
[21:49] and progressively changed
[21:52] so if i have any desire from our bible
[21:54] studies and our teachings and coming
[21:56] together
[21:57] is there must be some progression it is
[22:00] very disappointing it's very
[22:02] demotivating it's very troubling
[22:05] and it should trouble us all when people
[22:08] don't make progress
[22:11] it should be disturbing to us when we do
[22:13] not make progress in our lives
[22:16] that we haven't figured out how to be
[22:18] happier we haven't figured out how to
[22:21] pray better
[22:22] that we haven't progressed in our
[22:24] relationships with each other
[22:26] that we haven't progressed and and we
[22:28] were still struggling
[22:29] with these same struggles in the same
[22:31] kind of way we have struggled a long
[22:33] time
[22:34] and when we look back we cannot see that
[22:36] we have progressed
[22:38] we must make progress there must be a
[22:42] change
[22:42] in your life from how you were last week
[22:45] to this week
[22:48] if there is no desire to change then you
[22:50] are already
[22:51] out of line with what god's agenda and
[22:54] objective
[22:55] and purpose and focus is for us because
[22:58] we are
[22:58] being restored back to of from or
[23:01] or or back to the condition we were
[23:03] before man fell
[23:05] and it's not a overnight snap finger
[23:07] restoration
[23:08] it is the progress and we hear it in
[23:10] scripture and we see through the word
[23:12] add to your faith
[23:13] virtue and virtue knowledge and to
[23:16] knowledge
[23:16] temperance and to temperance patience it
[23:19] is progress even god and laying out the
[23:23] church ages
[23:24] it is a progression it is adding add
[23:27] progress progress progress if your goal
[23:30] is to save money
[23:32] you supposedly don't measure the
[23:34] progress anybody with me
[23:36] tonight all right so i'm going to touch
[23:39] different things because i'm trying to
[23:40] get to a point here all right
[23:42] so i want to nail this down carefully
[23:44] and and take my time to
[23:46] make sure everybody catches it because
[23:48] there are many people sitting out in
[23:50] churches sitting down in the message
[23:52] the increase of knowledge doesn't
[23:54] necessarily mean
[23:55] progress in your life because there are
[23:58] many people who have read books and
[24:00] scriptures
[24:01] and the jealousy the rock the hard stone
[24:04] of jealousy in their heart
[24:06] there's been no progress the jealousy is
[24:08] still there
[24:09] the envy is still there the animosity is
[24:12] still there
[24:12] the hatred is still there the grudges
[24:15] are still there
[24:15] the approach to things the approach to
[24:18] things
[24:19] sometimes it's not what you say it's how
[24:21] you say it
[24:23] there must be progress with these things
[24:28] in our relationships by this shall all
[24:32] men all men know you are my disciples
[24:35] when you have love
[24:36] one for another so progress is also
[24:39] measurable by the way your love changes
[24:42] one for another
[24:44] the more compassion you have one for
[24:46] another the more forgiveness
[24:48] you have one for another the more
[24:50] empathy that you have one for another
[24:52] all right
[24:53] so do not be conformed to this world any
[24:56] longer
[24:57] any longer speaks to the fact that okay
[25:00] we understand
[25:00] there would have been some level of
[25:02] conforming that took place before this
[25:04] word became clear to you
[25:06] it is understandable that you may have
[25:08] tried to fit in because it is all that
[25:10] we knew
[25:10] it is all that we understood it is all
[25:12] that we were exposed to so
[25:14] we really had no choice but now that our
[25:16] understanding is being open
[25:18] to the clarity of a different way and a
[25:20] different direction
[25:21] and a higher way and a higher direction
[25:24] and a better approach to life
[25:26] any longer with its superficial values
[25:28] and customs
[25:29] but be transformed and progressively
[25:32] change
[25:33] listen to the scripture it goes on the
[25:34] enemy fight as you mature
[25:36] spiritually by the renewing of your mind
[25:42] focusing on godly values
[25:45] and ethical attitudes so that you may
[25:49] prove for yourselves
[25:53] what the will of god is that which is
[25:56] good
[25:56] and acceptable and perfect in his plan
[25:59] and purpose for you so i want that to be
[26:03] an
[26:03] encouragement to you so you see a
[26:05] context i'm building somewhere
[26:07] and um i will ask a little bit i might
[26:10] send all these little notes i don't
[26:11] normally have much notes
[26:12] but i see buddha been signing a little
[26:14] note something i
[26:15] have to step up boy so i have these
[26:18] notes here
[26:19] i might just permission i'll see i can
[26:21] send this note out here
[26:22] you know what to encourage you know a
[26:24] little bit of the step of one sent fire
[26:25] something else so
[26:27] you know so i've been written down here
[26:30] so we'll try to email this out yeah so
[26:32] and then so i want to move on now to
[26:34] another contest and i'm building into
[26:36] something
[26:37] philippians 4 verse 8 finally my
[26:41] brethren so this is
[26:42] paul speaking now and typically
[26:45] you know and and there are many
[26:47] approaches to writing and expressing and
[26:49] communicating if you study
[26:50] the great orators and the great writers
[26:52] you study english in general paper and
[26:54] literature you study shakespeare
[26:57] and the ancient philosophers they speak
[27:00] of an approach
[27:01] to expression and one thing about paul
[27:04] the way
[27:04] paul writes his books and his epistles
[27:07] speak of a learning man in his structure
[27:10] so i always say that when you look
[27:12] through scripture and you understand
[27:14] and and and the way god would take
[27:16] different people
[27:17] and but abram said when god choose a man
[27:20] he he knows his personality he knows
[27:22] what he's trying to get out of the man
[27:23] that's why he took him a certain time
[27:24] away
[27:25] so when paul says something like finally
[27:27] paul likes a
[27:29] long his emphasis in his finales
[27:32] you know he leaves this punch for he
[27:35] just punched
[27:36] it it almost comes across as if you
[27:38] remember anything
[27:40] about what does it say tonight remember
[27:41] this thing all right so paul in
[27:43] philippians 4 verse 8 says
[27:45] finally brethren whatsoever things are
[27:48] true
[27:49] whatsoever things are honest whatsoever
[27:52] things
[27:53] are just whatsoever things are pure
[27:56] whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever
[27:59] things are of good report this is
[28:01] this is this is this is not just life
[28:04] this is
[28:04] paul is expressing deeply powerful
[28:07] things here
[28:08] if there be any virtue if there be any
[28:11] praise
[28:12] think on these things so paul in that
[28:16] entire verse
[28:17] is guiding us on where our thought
[28:20] patterns our thinking
[28:21] where it should be it's not powerful
[28:25] what have you been thinking this week
[28:27] what did you think about today what did
[28:30] you wake up thinking about
[28:32] because your thoughts influence your
[28:34] life
[28:36] anybody with me as a man thinking in his
[28:40] heart so he is
[28:42] and you're thinking influences what you
[28:44] speak
[28:45] so when you begin to speak i'm not
[28:47] feeling good
[28:48] i don't know what going on in my life i
[28:50] don't feel things working out
[28:52] it is very difficult to speak positive
[28:54] if your thinking is not positive
[28:58] so tonight you want to arrest your
[28:59] thinking because brother branham said
[29:01] you know your words is your thoughts
[29:03] expressed anybody with me
[29:05] all right so for you to begin to speak
[29:08] differently you see
[29:09] and and and and there's also this
[29:11] powerful thing about
[29:13] speaking on your mind coming in line
[29:15] with your speech
[29:16] because when you speak against your
[29:17] thinking your your mind has to start to
[29:19] figure out how to get in line with you
[29:21] with what you're saying so that is why
[29:25] if you will say it too or or speak to
[29:27] the mountain or or speak because when
[29:29] you speak
[29:29] even if your brain has to catch up you
[29:31] need to catch up
[29:35] all right so let's let me nail this down
[29:37] i want to read
[29:39] this in the amplified as well finally
[29:41] believers
[29:43] so in the king james said finally
[29:44] brethren but now
[29:46] let's put in a little more context it's
[29:48] not just brethren because
[29:49] i mean it happened who are brethren like
[29:51] that bridge who are believers
[29:54] so it's just bridging but this is
[29:56] believers so you're speaking to
[29:57] believers now
[29:58] finally believers whatever is true
[30:02] whatever is honorable and worthy of
[30:05] respect
[30:06] whatever is right and conformed by god's
[30:09] word
[30:10] whatever is pure and wholesome whatever
[30:13] is
[30:13] lovely and brings peace you see how it's
[30:16] been expressed here now
[30:18] brings peace whatever is admirable and
[30:21] of good repute
[30:22] if there is any excellence if there is
[30:25] anything worthy of praise
[30:27] think continually on these things center
[30:30] your mind
[30:31] on them and implant them in your heart
[30:35] what i'm trying to fight church is
[30:37] you see the negative thinking and the
[30:40] negative thoughts
[30:41] and the negative approach listen we
[30:43] cannot be negative people
[30:45] jesus didn't come for us to be negative
[30:48] and to be depressed
[30:49] and to be frustrated and to be upset
[30:51] with life and you're blaming the
[30:52] government
[30:53] do you know what government you belong
[30:54] to you know what kingdom you belong to
[30:56] do you know what your father
[30:58] owns do you know what your heritage is
[31:00] what your inheritance is what you were
[31:02] born to achieve and to accomplish
[31:04] even if it's not clear to you rest
[31:06] assured with confidence
[31:08] that god has a plan that's bigger bigger
[31:10] for you than you could even imagine
[31:12] anybody with me tonight what he has
[31:16] planned he said eyes have not seen
[31:18] heirs have not heard what is in store
[31:20] for you
[31:21] and that alone should be a comfort to
[31:23] you that the condition you are in
[31:25] tonight
[31:26] doesn't have to be that condition
[31:27] tomorrow doesn't have to be that
[31:29] condition next week doesn't have to be
[31:30] that condition next month
[31:32] if you can get your thinking to change
[31:34] about where you are supposed to be
[31:38] no more mediocrity so i'm building
[31:40] tonight i'm not going to be too long
[31:42] with you
[31:43] i'm laying off foundation so i read
[31:45] those two scriptures to
[31:47] kind of bring some direction i'm dealing
[31:49] with thinking
[31:51] and i just wrote this down here to
[31:53] change your thinking
[31:55] so now i'm speaking these are these are
[31:57] my words you know
[31:59] to change your thinking you need to
[32:02] question your assumptions
[32:08] you need to question your beliefs
[32:11] you need to question your experiences
[32:15] you need to question your knowledge
[32:19] you need to question your approach
[32:22] you need to question your habits you
[32:25] need to question your
[32:26] fears and most importantly you need to
[32:29] question your thinking
[32:32] now this is very very deep to change
[32:36] your thinking you must question your
[32:37] assumptions
[32:38] many of us make assumptions without
[32:41] evidence without data
[32:43] we make assumptions without knowing so
[32:45] we see somebody looking serious and we
[32:47] assume something wrong with them
[32:51] we see a situation and we make an
[32:53] assumption and without asking a question
[32:55] or understanding the context we make an
[32:57] assumption and we act on assumptions
[33:01] assumptions could be useful but
[33:03] assumptions can be problematic
[33:06] many times we assume the wrong thing and
[33:08] we make decisions
[33:10] based on assumptions
[33:13] what is worse is when somebody make an
[33:15] assumption and share the assumption with
[33:17] you and it
[33:18] influences your decision about something
[33:21] so now the assumption they make becomes
[33:23] your facts
[33:25] and when you question why am i doing it
[33:28] this way
[33:29] so i love when brad alvin says husband
[33:32] love
[33:32] your wives scripture and he puts in
[33:36] not as your father love your mother and
[33:39] the reason he
[33:39] says that because most of us we base
[33:43] what we know and what we have seen
[33:47] so we are limited by what we have seen
[33:50] we are limited by our experiences so
[33:52] most of us we
[33:53] judged what we do by but how i grew up
[33:56] this is what i went through but how i
[33:59] grew up this is what led to me
[34:01] so you have people who hoard things they
[34:03] hoard they hoard the hoard they hold
[34:05] they hold
[34:06] because maybe when they were younger
[34:08] they didn't have much
[34:10] so now that they get older they
[34:14] they don't want to ever be in a position
[34:15] where they don't have
[34:17] so they hoard
[34:21] the thinking when you these are real
[34:24] situations nowhere
[34:25] i want to tell them listen you can't
[34:27] keep bringing stuff into your house
[34:28] without putting stuff out you ever meet
[34:30] somebody who can't put stuff out of the
[34:32] house and the only tickets up in the
[34:33] house
[34:39] it's it's a thinking issue and it
[34:42] applies in so many
[34:43] areas of our lives we had a bad
[34:45] experience
[34:47] at me i share my own experience i have
[34:49] been to swimming lessons twice
[34:53] i didn't change my thinking because i
[34:56] still car swim
[34:59] i had a bad experience in the water no
[35:02] i don't know what process i have to go
[35:04] through too people always say but you
[35:06] live in an island
[35:06] and and you can't swim that is my
[35:10] reality that is my issue
[35:13] hopefully before the rapture could work
[35:15] on it
[35:18] but the reality is unless my mind
[35:20] changes
[35:22] you could be the best swimming
[35:23] instructor unless you know how to re
[35:25] reframe my thinking about the matter is
[35:28] me and a doodle
[35:31] or whoever it is he has hold on to
[35:34] because i i have faith and confidence in
[35:36] many things but don't throw many deep in
[35:39] the water i'll be like peter save me
[35:43] i'll be first i even trying
[35:47] but that is the result of your thinking
[35:50] they say if you think you cannot do it
[35:52] there's no way you could do it
[35:54] so i want to encourage you now so let's
[35:56] build
[35:58] to change your thinking to repeat you
[36:00] need to question your assumptions
[36:02] your beliefs your experiences your
[36:04] knowledge
[36:05] your approach do we always have the
[36:07] right approach
[36:08] do we have the right approach have you
[36:11] ever questioned your approach
[36:12] have you ever wondered if the approach
[36:14] you took was the right one to a specific
[36:16] situation
[36:18] because if you don't stop to think did i
[36:20] approach the right way could i have
[36:21] approached it better that's a good
[36:22] question to ask
[36:24] was there a better way to approach it
[36:26] was there a better way to speak to my
[36:27] son my
[36:28] daughter my wife was there a better way
[36:30] to deal with a situation with a bang was
[36:32] there a better way
[36:34] because what jesus came was to bring a
[36:36] better way
[36:37] he said you have heard it said this this
[36:39] this this but i say unto you
[36:41] and he giving you another way of
[36:44] thinking
[36:45] about the same material
[36:48] so the woman who was who was caught in
[36:50] adultery
[36:52] and they were about to stone her they
[36:54] were right in the approach to stay but
[36:56] moses law
[36:57] says if you're caught a stone jesus
[37:00] didn't tell them i bring in a different
[37:01] law
[37:02] he just changed their thinking only
[37:04] matter on the situation
[37:05] he said no problem i'm i'm fighting
[37:07] moses law
[37:08] moses law has this context i'm just
[37:10] asking him another question
[37:13] which of you without sin
[37:16] think about this which of you without
[37:17] sin cast the first stone that's all i
[37:20] say
[37:22] and all of a sudden he created what is
[37:24] what we call a paradigm shift a change
[37:27] in their thinking
[37:28] about their context of the situation
[37:32] he challenged them to look at themselves
[37:36] so he changed the focus by the question
[37:38] he asked
[37:39] he changed your focus from the woman
[37:42] to being more introspective he said
[37:45] which of you
[37:45] so look at yourself you're looking at
[37:47] her you're looking at her situation
[37:49] but what are your issues
[37:52] have you worked on you
[37:56] and many times as parents as leaders
[38:00] as officers as ministers as whatever
[38:04] many times we are placed in positions
[38:07] where
[38:08] we have the opportunity to speak to
[38:10] speak
[38:11] out speak about and address issues that
[38:14] don't concern
[38:15] us meaning it doesn't impact us we are
[38:18] the unaffected ones
[38:19] we are just in the external situation
[38:23] but if we take a lesson from how jesus
[38:26] presented a situation and how he dealt
[38:29] with the situation
[38:31] how many times do we look back at
[38:32] ourselves and ask ourselves
[38:35] could i have approached it differently
[38:37] that's what i mean by
[38:39] question our experience question
[38:42] our approach question our habits
[38:45] question our knowledge
[38:51] i trust in our study of scripture we
[38:54] realize that we may have overlooked
[38:56] certain things
[38:58] we have we might have spent as much time
[39:00] as we should understanding certain
[39:02] things
[39:03] and as a as our understanding increases
[39:05] you recognize that your knowledge
[39:08] and your approach to the word is
[39:09] different than it was before
[39:11] and there's a greater placing of
[39:13] responsibility
[39:14] on your spiritual future on you
[39:20] one of the greatest failures i've seen
[39:21] in many churches is this great
[39:23] dependence on the ministry to do
[39:28] that the ministry doesn't have a role
[39:29] and an important one at that
[39:31] and a responsibility but the challenge
[39:34] of what was created after the first
[39:37] church fell
[39:38] was a placing of responsibility and
[39:40] authority on the church leadership
[39:43] and the and the laity coming to the
[39:45] priest
[39:46] to be absolved and the the laity doing
[39:50] nothing
[39:50] whereas when jesus came and he revealed
[39:53] from top to bottom
[39:54] it was to place a responsibility on
[39:57] priesthood
[39:58] on the believer and he could declare
[40:01] that you
[40:02] you you everyone in this room is a king
[40:05] and a priest
[40:09] so the responsibility of priesthood in
[40:11] our homes
[40:12] in our situations now places
[40:16] a certain attitude with how we speak how
[40:18] we live because it's not just the pastor
[40:20] has to live
[40:21] a certain way it is all of us have to
[40:23] give an account
[40:24] for the element of priesthood that we
[40:27] carry ourselves
[40:31] paul was clear in how he expressed it
[40:33] because he said follow me as i follow
[40:34] christ
[40:35] which meant useless following christ as
[40:37] clearly and as focused as he was
[40:40] because if you were not knowing where
[40:41] christ was you couldn't tell paul
[40:44] paul you're off but paul
[40:47] exposed himself and made himself
[40:49] vulnerable by saying follow me as i
[40:51] follow christ
[40:55] things must never reach a point that you
[40:57] can't say but it's like show me
[40:58] in the scripture where that comes from
[41:00] show me in the prophet's message
[41:02] where i come from and my answer cannot
[41:04] be because i said so
[41:09] because the bible says clearly be ready
[41:11] to give an answer
[41:14] so we have to be able to give an answer
[41:16] because it is god's word anybody with me
[41:19] tonight so we go and change your
[41:22] thinking
[41:23] change your life is there anybody want
[41:25] to change their thinking
[41:26] so that your life changed your family
[41:28] relationship change your your business
[41:30] change your heart change your desires
[41:32] change
[41:33] and you can hear your whole approach
[41:35] your outlook
[41:38] we see a true scripture how god came
[41:40] god's
[41:41] word to every prophet through scripture
[41:44] was giving them a declarative statement
[41:46] that was changing their thinking you
[41:47] know gideon mighty man of allah
[41:50] this wasn't an outpouring of the holy
[41:51] spirit
[41:54] this was attacking his thinking about
[41:56] himself
[41:58] and gideon made it clear by his
[42:00] responsibility statement by saying
[42:02] who you're calling great i'm from the
[42:04] smallest tribe the smallest family and
[42:06] i'm despondent in my tribe
[42:08] thus illustrating what his thinking was
[42:12] and god is confronting his thinking
[42:15] so i'm trying to challenge us tonight
[42:18] how are you thinking about yourself
[42:20] because if you think you're a failure
[42:22] you might as well feel but i want to
[42:24] declare to you tonight you are not a
[42:25] failure
[42:26] that every time you step foiled down and
[42:29] you got back
[42:30] up you got stronger you know have more
[42:33] experience
[42:34] than you had yesterday than you had last
[42:36] year and they had a year before
[42:39] anybody with me all of the mistakes and
[42:42] the challenges you made
[42:44] have been preparing you for where you're
[42:45] going next
[42:47] so we're moving to change your thinking
[42:50] you need to question your assumptions
[42:52] your beliefs your experiences your
[42:55] knowledge
[42:56] your approach your habits your fears
[42:58] your thinking
[43:00] this is not the kind of baby tonight
[43:01] where we take a character and go deeply
[43:03] with the character
[43:04] i want to arrest your thinking a little
[43:05] bit tonight
[43:08] so i went on writing here what kind of
[43:11] questions should we ask ourselves
[43:16] are all questions created equal
[43:20] are there questions that have more
[43:22] impact
[43:23] on our lives than others
[43:27] are there questions that can truly
[43:29] inspire a change
[43:30] in our behavior tonight for a few
[43:33] minutes
[43:34] instead of trying to figure out what
[43:37] questions
[43:38] we should be asking ourselves why don't
[43:41] we discuss
[43:42] questions that we can agree are
[43:44] important
[43:47] when our lord jesus christ walked the
[43:48] earth
[43:50] there are many things he could have done
[43:54] but he did what he was led to do
[43:57] so when the lord jesus asks a question
[44:00] please
[44:00] understand that the questions he asks
[44:03] are among the most important questions
[44:05] we should be thinking about because when
[44:08] somebody asks you a question it's to
[44:09] make you reconsider opposition
[44:12] it's to make you rethink your approach
[44:14] as you reason if if there's no reason to
[44:16] question you then there's no reason
[44:18] if if you're not doing something that
[44:20] warrants a change then i shouldn't ask
[44:21] any question at all
[44:24] so tonight for a few minutes i want to
[44:26] think about some of the questions that
[44:27] jesus
[44:28] asked more than that i want to challenge
[44:31] all of us to work on how we will answer
[44:34] these questions and i just have a few
[44:36] questions and when we close tonight
[44:40] now the lord asks many questions in
[44:41] different ways if you count them
[44:43] individually you might find more than
[44:45] 300 questions through the four gospels
[44:49] tonight i want to focus on a few
[44:51] we have said it before but i think it's
[44:53] worth repeating again
[44:55] because many of us we find ourselves
[44:57] caught in this web
[44:59] so matthew 16 26
[45:03] for what is a man profited
[45:08] if he shall gain the whole world
[45:12] and lose his own stool or what shall a
[45:15] man
[45:16] give in exchange for his soul
[45:19] could you answer that question because
[45:21] the question jesus is asking
[45:24] and i asked myself if he were to come to
[45:26] you tonight
[45:27] as an individual because i hear lots of
[45:30] people
[45:31] a lot of people want to achieve this and
[45:34] do
[45:34] this and there's nothing wrong with
[45:36] achieving them
[45:38] but you have to understand where
[45:39] achievement and success is in relation
[45:41] to your soul
[45:42] listen to the scripture in the amplified
[46:02] oh blessed be the name of the lord just
[46:04] praise the lord
[46:05] hallelujah just give god some glory and
[46:07] worship praise god there's no
[46:09] interruption there but god be
[46:10] merciful god is good blessed be the
[46:14] name of the lord father we bless you
[46:16] father we worship you
[46:17] we thank you for your word and for your
[46:18] truth lord hallelujah hallelujah
[46:22] praise the lord
[46:26] i'm back what will you give to your soul
[46:31] because that's a question so jesus is
[46:34] saying
[46:35] what does it profit you to gain the
[46:37] whole world
[46:40] i've seen people
[46:43] choose to work overtime
[46:49] and at first it's about paying a bill
[46:52] and then it's no longer about paying a
[46:54] bill it's about achieving certain things
[46:56] and then it goes beyond achieving
[46:58] certain things to
[47:00] the ambitions and the desires of your
[47:02] heart
[47:06] you have to know you you have to know
[47:09] yourself your situation your context
[47:13] notice jesus here is not telling anybody
[47:15] what to do
[47:18] he's asking the question to make you
[47:19] think
[47:22] what does it profit to gain the whole
[47:24] world
[47:25] and to lose your soul
[47:29] because there's an inverse relationship
[47:32] between
[47:33] what you could gain and the condition of
[47:35] your soul
[47:39] anybody with me tonight when i'm done i
[47:42] just want to leave you to think i'm not
[47:43] going to be too long at all tonight
[47:47] we touched on this before matthew 5
[47:50] 46.
[47:54] for if you love them which love you
[47:58] what reward have thee this
[48:01] is something that could be plastered in
[48:03] every single message are not even
[48:06] dealing with outside the message there's
[48:07] any message here right now
[48:10] because it it's troubling how people
[48:13] could claim to be in this message
[48:16] and can't have love one for another
[48:21] greet somebody can't shake somebody's
[48:23] hand because somebody have a different
[48:25] view of the word
[48:26] and a different perspective and and and
[48:28] jason
[48:29] for if you love that much love you what
[48:31] reward of you do not the
[48:33] republicans you see him
[48:36] so jesus is saying you have to go beyond
[48:39] your circle
[48:41] you have to stretch now stretching is
[48:44] uncomfortable so what is jesus doing he
[48:46] is changing their thinking no no
[48:48] he was seeing a certain behavior and was
[48:51] not
[48:51] satisfied with that behavior and he was
[48:55] asking them a question that's supposed
[48:57] to lead to a change
[48:58] in their behavior anybody with me
[49:02] i'm almost done tonight is a short
[49:05] lesson
[49:05] you know in in school you have you go to
[49:07] lesson you go to school anything and you
[49:08] have a
[49:08] short class and then class finish early
[49:12] tonight is one of those nights class
[49:14] will finish early tonight
[49:17] but are given your homework give me some
[49:20] homework tonight
[49:23] and the homework is to work on these
[49:25] questions
[49:29] most of us we are and it's natural
[49:32] enough you're comfortable in your circle
[49:34] so for some of us it's just our family
[49:35] you know
[49:36] forgetting church we haven't we haven't
[49:38] reached a church it's just
[49:39] it's just your immediate family in your
[49:42] house and for some of us it's be any
[49:45] family homes
[49:46] it's part of the family in the house so
[49:48] we we he will do it after
[49:50] in another session but you love your own
[49:53] because you're comfortable with your own
[49:54] when last have you
[49:55] reached out beyond your own
[50:03] can we move on look at this question
[50:05] jesus asked
[50:06] and again he is asking the question to
[50:08] bring a change in thinking
[50:10] the theme tonight change your thinking
[50:12] change your life
[50:15] mark 4 21 and he said unto them
[50:18] is a candle brought to be put under a
[50:22] bushel or under a bed
[50:25] and not be set on a candlestick
[50:29] i'll read it one more time and he said
[50:31] unto them
[50:32] question is a candle brought to be put
[50:35] under a bushel
[50:37] or under bed and not to be set on a
[50:40] candlestick
[50:41] in other words he is typing out the
[50:44] light
[50:45] that we are supposed to represent that
[50:48] we are supposed to be shining
[50:50] that we're supposed to be influencing
[50:52] and impacting our environment just like
[50:54] joseph
[50:55] you know and i know we did our teaching
[50:57] on joseph if i just i just want to go
[50:59] back quickly
[51:00] to this if you would allow me for a few
[51:02] minutes
[51:04] back to genesis i think it's genesis 39.
[51:07] i just want to read
[51:09] this again because i think it's worth a
[51:12] second look
[51:16] all right and
[51:19] i want to draw attention if if you have
[51:21] your bible that's in genesis 39
[51:23] and we're going to read a few verses and
[51:25] joseph was brought down to egypt
[51:27] we remember teaching in it and potiphar
[51:30] an officer of pharaoh captain
[51:33] of the god an egyptian brought him to
[51:36] the hands
[51:38] bought him of the hands of the
[51:39] ishmaelites which had brought him
[51:41] down feather and the lord was with
[51:44] joseph
[51:45] and he was a prosperous man and again
[51:49] the context as we would have taught in
[51:51] the story of joseph i just want to
[51:52] highlight this point here
[51:54] joseph was somewhat of a spoiled child
[51:56] and he was your favorite
[51:57] so we'll spoil he's 17 years old
[52:02] he doesn't know the language he's in a
[52:04] trained environment he
[52:05] he is struggling to fit in but the lord
[52:08] is with him
[52:09] and because the lord is with him
[52:13] he is prospering and he was in the house
[52:16] of his master the egyptian
[52:18] this is verse 3 and this is where i want
[52:20] to focus here
[52:22] and his master this is an egyptian
[52:25] this is somebody who doesn't know the
[52:27] lord this is somebody who is not a
[52:28] believer
[52:29] this is somebody who quote unquote is
[52:31] not a christian and
[52:33] his master saw that the lord was with
[52:36] him
[52:37] and that the lord made all that he did
[52:39] to prosper in his hand
[52:41] how does somebody who doesn't know the
[52:44] lord
[52:45] see that the lord is with you
[52:49] and i want to ask the question now calm
[52:52] somebody
[52:53] who doesn't know the lord because this
[52:56] potiphar
[52:57] did not know the lord
[53:00] so how could scripture record
[53:03] that his master saw that the lord was
[53:07] with him
[53:11] so are you living the kind of a life
[53:15] that anybody can see the lord is with
[53:16] you
[53:19] so let me bring it back to the teachings
[53:21] tonight
[53:23] sorry so
[53:27] is a candle brought to be put under a
[53:29] bushel
[53:32] is your life pulsating positivity
[53:37] is your life shining as an encouragement
[53:39] as an inspiration
[53:40] do you know you are light do you know
[53:42] that you are a lighthouse in this dark
[53:44] world
[53:44] you know the bible says arise shine for
[53:46] thy light has come
[53:50] and if your life not shining then what
[53:53] are you doing about it
[53:57] what is your corrective approach and if
[53:59] you have a light then why are you hiding
[54:00] in it
[54:03] why are you hiding it because hiding the
[54:06] light
[54:07] hiding your this is not i'm not saying
[54:08] put a placard and walk around
[54:10] and and and you know do not one man
[54:13] protest or one man decoration of her and
[54:15] i'm not talking about that
[54:16] but i'm talking your life being in such
[54:18] a way that when people see you
[54:19] they could see like party for anybody
[54:21] else boy there's something about that
[54:23] boy there's something about
[54:25] a couple more things on it but there's
[54:26] different voice but the fact that potty
[54:28] said the lord is with him
[54:30] that to me is mind-blowing mind-blowing
[54:38] let's go on a little bit again change
[54:40] your thinking
[54:43] a lot of christians like to hide that
[54:44] the christians you know i remember over
[54:46] the years ago
[54:47] something that stalked me as a young
[54:49] young young christian i remember
[54:51] testifying about this in in secondary
[54:53] school whatever is a preaching arena
[54:55] when you go to your workplace or you go
[54:57] to a school or something truly acts
[54:58] first
[54:59] anybody remember that joey acts was tell
[55:02] them you're a christian
[55:04] true it first declared because when you
[55:06] declare it now you have to live up to
[55:08] the standard but when you keep quiet
[55:10] and and and you dare you this that they
[55:12] existed like you're
[55:13] undercover christian this is saying i'm
[55:15] not a christian you know
[55:17] you are christian in secret you are
[55:18] you're a secret agent you're a secret
[55:20] agent christian
[55:21] nobody must know this gravity people are
[55:24] supposed to know
[55:25] you're christian because when you hide
[55:27] it you can get away with foolishness
[55:30] anybody with me when you don't declare
[55:34] testimony
[55:34] you get in away with all kinds of things
[55:36] because you you you undercover
[55:39] you by saying here don't be an
[55:40] undercover be real
[55:42] be genuine on your workplace be a
[55:45] christian
[55:46] in your neighborhood be a christian in
[55:48] your home be a christian
[55:50] have a testimony don't be afraid to have
[55:53] a testimony
[55:54] don't be afraid to say there are things
[55:56] i do not do
[55:57] there are places i do not go if you have
[56:00] a light
[56:01] don't put it on that bushel let the
[56:04] light shine
[56:05] anybody with me
[56:09] look at this question and i'm going to
[56:10] close up with with these two last one
[56:12] luke 14.
[56:15] and this affects so many of us because
[56:17] some of us we take the approach
[56:19] again context we have to trust the lord
[56:23] there are many speaking of trust in the
[56:25] lord but some of us want to trust the
[56:27] lord and do nothing
[56:30] some of us want to trust the lord and
[56:31] don't plan
[56:33] so i don't know what particular
[56:35] situation jesus was dealing with but
[56:37] here he asked a question
[56:39] and we addressed this before in dealing
[56:41] with planning for 2021
[56:43] but i want to bring it to us again we
[56:45] are not thinking
[56:47] hard enough long enough in your right
[56:49] way to get the right results
[56:51] and jesus own questions suggest to us
[56:54] what we should be doing
[56:55] for which of you saint luke 14 28
[56:59] for which of you intending to build a
[57:02] tower
[57:04] sit it not down first and count it
[57:07] because
[57:08] whether you have sufficient to finish it
[57:10] that's a question
[57:13] you want to do something you want to
[57:15] change your career
[57:16] we in a pandemic you want to start a
[57:19] business
[57:19] you want to do a side hustle you want to
[57:22] do something
[57:24] you can't just walk into it
[57:28] have you considered the cost have you
[57:31] done research
[57:32] have you analyzed the situation do you
[57:35] understand where you are
[57:36] now do you understand what you need to
[57:38] do to get where you need to go
[57:42] trust in god has to be trusting god
[57:44] having done these things
[57:48] but you have your part to do
[57:52] have you sat down and put pen to paper
[57:54] you have to say write a vision and make
[57:56] it plain
[57:57] make it plain means there is no
[58:00] misunderstanding there's no gray area
[58:03] make it plain
[58:04] so they can run who read it i will shave
[58:06] ashamed but over
[58:08] a couple of weeks ago you know i tried
[58:10] to write things down and i
[58:12] sometimes go to meeting and it's not my
[58:14] favorite thing to take notes it's not my
[58:16] favorite thing
[58:17] to take notes sometime i go to a meeting
[58:20] and i have somebody with me to help me
[58:21] take notes but then i started to find
[58:22] these scriptures
[58:23] where god told moses write it down
[58:27] but that was like there's no better way
[58:28] to rebuke me than with scripture when i
[58:30] say to myself that's it i'm done
[58:32] what's a write down the men who go into
[58:34] war right down the journey you pass
[58:36] document it put it on paper put it on
[58:39] record
[58:40] that was all i that's that the matter
[58:42] was settled
[58:44] you had to convince me twice if god
[58:46] could tell moses who leading two million
[58:48] people
[58:48] that he had to take time to write it on
[58:51] who is me
[58:54] so this is saying question which of you
[58:56] intending to build a tower
[58:58] and building a tower is could be
[59:00] anything you know
[59:01] which of you intend me to do anything
[59:03] don't sit down first
[59:04] and count the cost there are different
[59:06] kinds of costs it's not just monetary
[59:08] costs
[59:09] there's time cost there's the cost of
[59:11] studying
[59:13] there's the effort to do something you
[59:15] want to be a welder
[59:16] you don't want to want to learn where
[59:17] lyn for this before you be a welder
[59:20] you want to open a well in business you
[59:21] know anything about welding
[59:23] it may not be money to study business
[59:25] but at least there's a cost to learn it
[59:28] have you considered the costs whether
[59:30] you have sufficient time
[59:31] effort energy to finish it
[59:35] i'm challenging you because if we have
[59:37] to be representatives
[59:38] but i random said it like this be god's
[59:40] advertisement board
[59:43] which means whatever we do we have to be
[59:45] best in class
[59:50] but everybody i'm saying you want to be
[59:51] a bum you said it be the best bomb
[59:54] show people what being a good bomb look
[59:56] like
[59:59] best in class so question
[1:00:02] which of you intending to build a tower
[1:00:05] sit
[1:00:05] it not down first in other words before
[1:00:07] you start
[1:00:08] count the cost analyze the situation
[1:00:11] whether you have
[1:00:12] sufficient to finish it and he goes on
[1:00:14] and i read it it's in luke 14 29
[1:00:16] lest happily after he lay the foundation
[1:00:21] and is not able to finish it all that
[1:00:24] behold it begin to mock him
[1:00:29] so jesus is questioning them saying
[1:00:31] listen i know only know better
[1:00:34] because this is the journey people take
[1:00:36] when they don't do the proper
[1:00:37] due diligence so this here
[1:00:41] is a balance again well i trust in a
[1:00:43] trusted workout
[1:00:44] i i got an entire thing oh you can be
[1:00:46] you can't be trying a thing
[1:00:49] if you're doing something you're doing
[1:00:51] it the right way you're serving god
[1:00:53] you're serving god a hundred percent
[1:00:55] you're working on your marriage you're
[1:00:57] working on a hundred percent yeah you're
[1:00:59] not trying to think
[1:01:00] you know we wasn't doing too good but
[1:01:02] trying to improve no improve
[1:01:06] improve improve don't try to improve
[1:01:08] improve do it
[1:01:10] make the improvements he goes on verse
[1:01:12] 30
[1:01:14] saying this man began to build and was
[1:01:16] not able to finish
[1:01:19] and for jesus to bring clarity to it
[1:01:22] he asked another question or what king
[1:01:25] so he's dealing with no with two levels
[1:01:27] he said which of you want to build a
[1:01:28] tower that's something that anybody
[1:01:30] could do
[1:01:30] but now he's addressing leaders
[1:01:33] leadership
[1:01:34] leadership thinking or what king he puts
[1:01:37] no context
[1:01:38] he takes it above building a tower which
[1:01:40] is something that anybody could do
[1:01:42] to the managers among us or the leaders
[1:01:44] among us or the visionaries among us
[1:01:46] or those in authority among us or those
[1:01:48] who have to do more strategic planning
[1:01:50] among us
[1:01:51] or what king going to make war against
[1:01:54] another king
[1:01:55] sit it not down first and consultative
[1:02:00] whether he be able with ten thousand to
[1:02:02] meet him that commit against him with
[1:02:04] twenty thousand
[1:02:07] and and this is the question jesus is
[1:02:09] asking and it's a question about
[1:02:10] approach it's a it's a question about
[1:02:13] strategy
[1:02:14] it's a question about having people to
[1:02:16] consult
[1:02:18] that's why i share with young people in
[1:02:19] church after church i said there are
[1:02:21] enough people in our church
[1:02:22] who are teachers and different
[1:02:24] professions that if you want that
[1:02:25] profession
[1:02:26] why don't you go ask them what does it
[1:02:29] take to be a good one
[1:02:31] i want to do this what what should i
[1:02:34] look out for
[1:02:34] what shouldn't i do that is consulting
[1:02:38] because you want to approach in the
[1:02:40] right way you want to know that you're
[1:02:42] going into something that is sound
[1:02:45] years ago when henry ford
[1:02:49] rolled out the first ford car in the
[1:02:52] early 1900s
[1:02:54] you know what what was the most biggest
[1:02:56] careers of those days
[1:02:57] the guys who were doing horseshoes
[1:03:00] because the horse and buggy age
[1:03:02] was in full force
[1:03:05] so after a while when the car come if
[1:03:08] kasata meek and you say well i really
[1:03:10] want to go in this horseshoe profession
[1:03:13] you go into a profession that really may
[1:03:14] not um
[1:03:17] much longer you know so you have to know
[1:03:20] based on what's happening in your
[1:03:21] environment what to go into
[1:03:23] i'm almost done
[1:03:26] verse 32 or else while the others yet
[1:03:29] far off or way off a great way off
[1:03:31] he send it and ambassador and desired
[1:03:34] conditions of peace
[1:03:36] and the last scripture and this for some
[1:03:39] people
[1:03:39] may be a shock because a lot of people
[1:03:41] never really looked at the description i
[1:03:43] know this
[1:03:45] we read parts of it luke 16 and verse 10
[1:03:52] he that is faithful in that
[1:03:55] which is least
[1:03:59] is faithful also in much
[1:04:03] and he that is unjust in the least is
[1:04:06] unjust
[1:04:06] also in much so jesus was given context
[1:04:09] he said
[1:04:10] he that is faithful in which is least is
[1:04:13] faithful also in much
[1:04:15] and he unless injust is unjust in the
[1:04:18] least
[1:04:18] is unjust also in much verse 11. so say
[1:04:21] in luke 16 verse 11
[1:04:25] and listen to jesus saying something
[1:04:26] here
[1:04:28] if therefore ye have not been
[1:04:31] faithful in the unrighteous mammon
[1:04:36] who will commit to your trust the true
[1:04:38] riches
[1:04:40] now this is this is real serious
[1:04:44] when you see the context of the
[1:04:45] scripture because jesus first leads it
[1:04:48] by saying who he who is faithful in
[1:04:50] little
[1:04:51] is faithful in much he that is unjust in
[1:04:54] the least
[1:04:55] is unjust in much and jesus gave a
[1:04:59] comparison
[1:05:00] that you never really see much in other
[1:05:03] places
[1:05:04] he is saying if you have not been
[1:05:06] faithful in the unrighteous
[1:05:08] mammon in other words if your salary
[1:05:10] you're getting in the month
[1:05:12] you can't even manage it how could you
[1:05:14] manage
[1:05:15] true riches
[1:05:21] think about it to see how much
[1:05:24] and jesus is using an example very very
[1:05:27] simple
[1:05:28] and he is dealing understanding he's
[1:05:30] speaking to managers
[1:05:31] he speaks we talk about adoption and
[1:05:33] taking over the father's business
[1:05:35] and i must be about my father's business
[1:05:37] i'm talking about signing a check
[1:05:39] all these examples in scripture
[1:05:42] and jesus is saying if therefore you
[1:05:45] have not been
[1:05:46] faithful in the unrighteous mammon
[1:05:49] the money you get in the world in your
[1:05:51] business in your career in your salary
[1:05:53] who will commit to your trust the true
[1:05:56] riches what are the true riches
[1:06:01] so god is watching your management of
[1:06:03] these simple things including how you do
[1:06:05] your own
[1:06:06] financial management to see if
[1:06:10] if you can manage your own little budget
[1:06:12] how are you even true riches to manage
[1:06:18] i know some of you never saw that before
[1:06:19] i want you to think about it
[1:06:21] change your thinking change your life
[1:06:24] it makes you weigh a lot of different
[1:06:25] things
[1:06:27] and listen to verse 12. this is the last
[1:06:28] one and i'm done for tonight i'm just
[1:06:30] giving you food for thought
[1:06:32] and if ye have not been faithful in that
[1:06:35] which
[1:06:35] is another man's who shall give
[1:06:39] you that which is your own no this is
[1:06:42] serious
[1:06:43] i will share this with young people and
[1:06:45] this is it here
[1:06:46] a lot of young people want to open their
[1:06:48] own business and they want to have
[1:06:50] success
[1:06:50] and they want to achieve and you know
[1:06:52] you know that's why they
[1:06:53] say he who is faithful who is he let
[1:06:55] himself all right
[1:06:57] so if you can't be a great employee
[1:07:00] you can't be a great manager
[1:07:04] if you want to be a leader you have to
[1:07:07] understand what it is to follow
[1:07:11] so the bible jesus is saying you know
[1:07:14] and
[1:07:14] if you have not been faithful in that
[1:07:17] which is
[1:07:18] another man's
[1:07:21] who shall give you that which is your
[1:07:23] own
[1:07:25] i have seen many people approach work as
[1:07:28] in are working for the man i'm working
[1:07:29] for the man and if i had my own business
[1:07:31] how to work harder
[1:07:32] god is saying that's not how it works
[1:07:33] you know
[1:07:36] he said do all you do unto the lord
[1:07:40] so so that you could perform as the
[1:07:42] fantastic
[1:07:43] employee and god will promote you into
[1:07:45] your own business
[1:07:47] if in your heart you hold them back
[1:07:49] because you waiting for your own to do
[1:07:51] your best work
[1:07:52] god's saying it don't work so
[1:07:56] change your thinking change your life
[1:08:01] most people haven't studied these things
[1:08:02] and i trust it's a blessing to you
[1:08:05] because you want the key to success you
[1:08:07] want to understand
[1:08:08] all this is worth to meditate on and
[1:08:11] rethink your approach but wait a minute
[1:08:14] the bible says whatever you do do it
[1:08:16] unto the lord
[1:08:18] you're working you're not working for
[1:08:20] the boss i don't care what the boss does
[1:08:21] you're working for the lord
[1:08:23] and you want to show that you've been
[1:08:24] fearful in another man's world
[1:08:26] in another man's business because
[1:08:29] promotional comfortably is
[1:08:31] or from the west promotion comes from
[1:08:33] the lord
[1:08:35] so may you be inspired to do your own
[1:08:38] study in different scriptures and look
[1:08:40] at
[1:08:41] the other question that jesus asked we
[1:08:43] can get to all of them
[1:08:45] in these studies because we're moving as
[1:08:47] the lord will lead us to bring
[1:08:49] shed light on areas you may have not
[1:08:50] looked at before but i want to encourage
[1:08:53] you
[1:08:53] look at yourself to improve
[1:08:58] in quality management and quality
[1:09:00] control there's something called delta
[1:09:01] plus
[1:09:03] what's working and what need to change
[1:09:05] so every day you can ask yourself what
[1:09:06] was good
[1:09:06] what needs to improve what was good what
[1:09:08] needs to improve that's typically it
[1:09:10] very simple truck yeah
[1:09:11] that was good what need to improve and
[1:09:13] everything that approach our life that's
[1:09:15] why we make progress
[1:09:18] what do i need to improve we touched on
[1:09:21] this
[1:09:22] the rich young ruler had come to that
[1:09:24] spot he realized that he had really
[1:09:26] limit
[1:09:27] to his understanding of what he had to
[1:09:29] improve
[1:09:31] so when he did his self-assessment he
[1:09:32] come to the conclusion i lacking
[1:09:34] something
[1:09:35] what like i yet because i can't put my
[1:09:37] finger in it
[1:09:39] i keep the commandments i follow the law
[1:09:41] everything that i could do
[1:09:43] are doing everything i could add
[1:09:46] i've added but he didn't realize it was
[1:09:49] no longer about adding for him it was to
[1:09:51] take something out that was
[1:09:53] insane when jesus saw that he said go
[1:09:56] sell what you have and give it to the
[1:09:59] poor
[1:10:00] because you have something in your heart
[1:10:02] you're holding more deer
[1:10:03] than eternal life
[1:10:06] and in one of the most tragic scriptures
[1:10:10] in the entire bible as i said before
[1:10:14] a man got an answer from the lord and
[1:10:16] couldn't reconcile it with his own life
[1:10:20] he would direct from god and didn't have
[1:10:22] the will
[1:10:23] the desire to change i trust that
[1:10:27] tonight
[1:10:28] you could be inspired to first want to
[1:10:31] change
[1:10:32] and to more importantly be willing to
[1:10:34] change
[1:10:36] like i said this is not a a big teaching
[1:10:38] it's not a it's not a
[1:10:39] super spiritual teaching and i don't
[1:10:41] know how you want to look at it but they
[1:10:42] say what he lord put in my heart
[1:10:44] that if we change our thinking you
[1:10:47] change your life
[1:10:48] change your thinking you change your
[1:10:49] marriage change your thinking
[1:10:51] it's changed how you interact with your
[1:10:53] co-workers how you interact with your
[1:10:55] boss
[1:10:56] how you interact with your neighbor
[1:10:58] because you can't change
[1:11:00] them but you can change your thinking
[1:11:02] you can't change your children but you
[1:11:04] can change your thinking
[1:11:06] and how you think about them can make
[1:11:08] you look at this situation
[1:11:10] differently and treat them differently
[1:11:13] and maybe ask them the right questions
[1:11:15] that make them really look at themselves
[1:11:18] but it must start with what you can
[1:11:20] control which is your own thinking
[1:11:23] think positively think happy thoughts
[1:11:26] and as we read it at the beginning from
[1:11:28] philippians and i'll close with this
[1:11:29] before we close in prayer
[1:11:31] finally brethren so this is my
[1:11:33] conclusion tonight
[1:11:34] finally brethren
[1:11:37] whatsoever things are true whatsoever
[1:11:41] things
[1:11:41] are honest whatsoever things are just
[1:11:45] whatsoever things are pure whatsoever
[1:11:47] things are lovely
[1:11:50] whatsoever things are of good report
[1:11:53] if there be any virtue and if there be
[1:11:55] any praise
[1:11:57] think on these things shall we bow our
[1:11:59] heads i would have prayed
[1:12:01] oh heavenly father tonight lord these
[1:12:04] scriptures around
[1:12:06] thinking what we think how we think
[1:12:09] lord and how you stood there walking on
[1:12:11] this earth
[1:12:12] watching the human condition and the
[1:12:16] interaction of brother with brother
[1:12:18] father with son mother with daughter
[1:12:21] families tribes people
[1:12:24] pharisees sadducees priests
[1:12:28] and common folk and you saw the
[1:12:31] challenges the situations the pains the
[1:12:34] concerns you saw people
[1:12:37] lord with hatred we saw people who were
[1:12:42] in their own cliques as it were loving
[1:12:44] their own you saw people
[1:12:46] in so many situations in their hearts
[1:12:48] you ask them why you think evil
[1:12:52] you ask them how they will consider
[1:12:54] different situations you ask
[1:12:55] questions to to teach to instruct the
[1:12:58] guide
[1:12:59] to reframe their perspective help us as
[1:13:02] believers to be inspired and motivated
[1:13:06] to ask ourselves these same questions
[1:13:09] what shall the prophet amanda gain the
[1:13:11] whole world and lose to soul
[1:13:14] if we are going to do something are we
[1:13:16] considering
[1:13:17] carefully the steps we need to take
[1:13:19] before venturing
[1:13:21] are we being grenade managers stewards
[1:13:24] can we change our approach is it the
[1:13:26] best approach
[1:13:27] are we approaching things the right way
[1:13:29] can we do better
[1:13:30] how do we do better are we improving how
[1:13:34] do we improve
[1:13:35] what do i need to do what luck have yet
[1:13:38] so many questions law that we can
[1:13:41] use as a basis to grow to change to
[1:13:44] spiritually mature laws that when we
[1:13:48] look and say yes we can give an account
[1:13:50] we can give an answer we can give a
[1:13:51] response
[1:13:52] help us lord to law to as jesus spoke
[1:13:56] lord when they had that woman there to
[1:13:58] to see which of you without stim cast
[1:14:00] the first stone he switched the entire
[1:14:03] situation
[1:14:05] from what everybody was focusing on
[1:14:08] to everybody looking at themselves and
[1:14:11] when people looked at themselves they
[1:14:12] realized listen i have to make changes
[1:14:14] in my life
[1:14:15] help us dear god to make changes
[1:14:17] positive changes
[1:14:19] help us to believe and to understand
[1:14:21] that you want the best for us
