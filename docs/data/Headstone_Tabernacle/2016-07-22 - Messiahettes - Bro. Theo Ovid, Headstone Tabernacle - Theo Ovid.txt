2 veres there verse 9 and 10 strange thought but I got to give what he give me all right Luke 7 ver 20 and 21 and when are you finally say amen amen Luke 17:20 and when and when he was demanded of the Pharisees when the kingdom of God should come he answered them and said the kingdom of God cometh not with observation neither shall they say Lo here or l over there for behold the kingdom of God is within you amen want to read from First Corinthians chapter 4 1 verse verse 20 for the kingdom of God is not in word but in power let's read it again let's read it together 3 4 for the kingdom of God is not in word but in power and we turn to Revelation 5 verse 9 and 10 and they sung a new song saying Thou Art Worthy to take the book and to open the seeds thereof for thou are slain and has redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every Kindred and tongue and people and Nation and has made us unto our God Kings and Priests and we shall re on the earth let's bow our heads father we thank you for your word your written word and Lord we we we don't even know what to say this morning but you could give us the unction and take our minds out of the way and let your thoughts drop down and

morning I have a title is one word Messiah s our subject the kingdom of God I have an inspiration Kingdom people citizens from above Hallelujah Glory that's what I have this morning glory to brother the BAM used that term Messiah little Messiah yes sir or little anointed ones amen that is what God promised little Hallelujah Messiah amen God never ordained man to rule man amen amen God give man power over the fish and the Earth and Other Things fall man raised Reign Over man that's right that's right but man was supposed to be sons of God just like God yes sir Adam was to produce more Adams yes Sons just like him attribute Son of God Spirit as it was Sir and like brother ULU so tremendously brought out because Adam was placed in the garden as a man Adam wasn't placed as a babe he made man and put man in the Garden of Eden and that man fell God when he reboot he said I'm going to do it different now I'm going to bring in process amlu I'm going to bring in a birth a babe a growing a growth process because Adam didn't experience character development he was just a place son in the Garden of Eden everything made which is a few words Thou shalt not eat of that tree and he messed up are you with me a place son messed up Adam wasn't a demon he wasn't a serpent seed he wasn't contrary no he was a son and he fell so Sons could fall but they are still Sons but God said I will restore nothing with you you could say what you want and do what he said I not you going to restore I I will restore you can't even stop it I will restore whatever he's got to do I will restore all the years that the caner woman and the caterpillar all the sickness all the disease all what what you're going through he's going to do something that's our promise Hallelujah Glory you may be seated the promise is not for us to die and go to heaven when I go to heaven when I die that's not the promise because when the lamb took the book they s a new song and they said we shall rain on the earth oh give the Lord I shout in the house so don't look today that's not your promise say like the pound I shall not die but live don't believe what the doctor tell you believe what God said I'm not hearing you I am not hearing you he said thou has redeemed Us by thy blood out of every Kindred out of every nation out of every people and you have made us Kings and pre woo my Lord You Can't Be a King Without a domain you can't be a King Without a kingdom because that's what the word kingdom comes from doain in other words to be really King and to Reign you have to rule you have to dominate you have to conquer you have to overcome you have to put your foot on the devil's neck you have to put your foot on the neck of the enemy you have to understand what God told Joshua that every place you put your foot express Dominion Express Authority Express power he said you Des shall follow them that believe they're going to cast out Devils they're going to heal the sick they're going to raise the Dead you didn't say they go send for the doctor they call for the funeral home no no no no no he we have it back to front we have to come back to what he he said in his word we have to release ourselves into God's promises oh my Where Do We Begin hallu this on the Messiah report 1961 amen when a man gets saved a light comes into him about a little white button like a little white button on

you never did it you never sin you never fail you never fail there is nothing against you you by Joseph nothing against Joseph you may be seated you know what we doing there we giving your senses a run for the moneyall glory glory because you see your conscience heing there's nothing against you amen but your subconscious saying is that so so there's a big disagreement going on you want to receive it you want intellectually hearing it hear nothing he's forgiv me of what a feeling this and feeling that that's your feeling what God Said Jesus never said feel as th this Jesus always said believe as thou this it has nothing to do with you see you have to beat them senses you have to conquer them senses you have to let the senses know they're lying vanities I don't believe my senses you don't feel like praising God praise Him anyhow you don't feel like standing up stand up anyhow you don't feel like jumping just jump anyhow spin around do something you may be seated God is so unique so awesome so different from the humanistic realm that God bypassed all them phares and scribes who since they born they learning scriptures they could say of her heart and God take fishermen cper men who can write and read and say I will make you that from a humanistic standpoint it's easy to pick all them religious freaks because that is what they were all them religious Fanatics who in the Scrolls and the reading and the kissing the Bible and kissing the Scrolls and they rocking and they praying and whatnot when Messiah come they call him B and Jesus tell them plainly the Moses spoke about me what you looking for all these years you know what happened sit down a minute 400 years there see no sign no wonders no Miracles 400 years just tradition and as the years go by getting worse beard get longer toy get higher the gongs get more classier and so on and all them is pots and pans and dress and wear and all the formality around the gospel so when John the Baptist come rugged as ever with camel skin no topy no long dead just just just rugged repent for the kingdom of God is at hand be seated people say but but he preaching like like like like what we just here but God tell John Make A Way mountains cut down crooked made straight how you making that you have to get tractor to do that get brushing Cutlass to make a way that big rug he said he ACC L to the root of the tree and tree that to Big through and chop it down what's he doing preparing our way who's coming Messiah and anytime Messiah coming God has to make a way oh give the Lord a you want Messiah coming to your life you've got to make a way John John knew the Messiah WR somewhere one day he was so convinced there's one standing among you I don't know who he is yet because God G him a sign the one upon whom you see the dove coming down and remaining you had to take all of that not Dove coming down Dove can come and land and then they see the wolf they just fly off so don't just want Landing Dove see the dove remaining say upon the one you see the dove land and remain that's the Messiah so he don't know who is who dumping everybody amen baptizing everybody all of a sudden he said Behold the Lamb of God I see Messi that's the messiah messiah is anointed word you got to see the Spirit come you hear what I'm saying you're going to read it Messiah is who anointed anointed word not the word anointed word hallelujah hallelujah still trying to get over that light hallah so watch self-will then God comes into the man into the heart which is the spirit then the spirit makes the soul and then he said now when a man is converted like that little white button starts in his heart when he's born again amen God's spirit dwells in him amen now listen to this beautiful part come on he can let that Spirit grow and take all the roots of bitterness and press God's way through him again amen he can become back in the same condition that he was when he was in the Garden of Eden Mark 11:23 amen what is he saying that white light come to you yes but then as you die out amen as you give up this Hallelujah it expands as you separate yourself from this it expands as you get rid of the bitterness it expands and afterward begin to oo through your body it taken over your memory your conscience your imagination Christ become present to you not as a service thing but as a life thing oh Hallelujah then you become ingrained in your subconscious the very word of God the life of God oh hallelujah praise the name of the Lord blessed be the name of the Lord listen to this enticing spirits put a br he say watch a few moments on the physical amen we have many times for years we call a li detector you could put it on your risk on your head and you can get in there and try your best to make a lie sound like the truth it will bres a negative every time because a human was not made to lie lying is a deceitful hard thing an evil thing I'd rather have a drunkard with me any day than a liar your body wasn't made to lie so no matter how sinful you are you're still a fallen Son of God the most sinful person in the city today God didn't intend you to be sinful he wanted you to be a son or daughter of his you are makeup your his own you are made in his own makeup but sin has caused you to do that and no matter how much you try to impersonate and try to make a lie seem right they got a scientific instrument that proves it's wrong true you can tell it with all the Innocence you want to but it will still register negative because there's a here we go there's a subconscious dong in the human being right and that subconscious knows what is the truth and no matter what you're saying out there that subconscious knows it's a lie and it will register on the subconscious so we're going a little deeper therefore if a man or woman now ever get their thoughts and their testimony and their lives so lined up with God until the channel of the Holy Spirit would be perfectly one with God what would take place if the man and woman would ever get lined up where from freedom from their hearts with Faith from their innermost oh he's going down deeper inside of there in other words he's trying to get you to line up your conscious and your subconscious to say the same not your conscious saying amen and your subconscious wondering should I say Amen is that really for me is that really so I'm back and whatnot but you see the word have to get that line up if you only get that line up your whole life transform and change because your subconscious is the real you this front part is just intellectual is the heart that's why the Bible say if you shall say to this mountain and don't doubt in your heart you can have what you what you say there we go many people come to the altar to be prayed for they have intellectual Faith they confess their sins and join a church by intellectual Faith they believe in their mind they believe because they heard it they believe because they know it's the best policy but that's not what God looks at amen oh he this mom he don't look at your intellectual Faith all right he looks at the heart so but I'm talking about people have all faith and they say they have faith but they call the prayer line and by time they come up the the black no Fai whatsoever so when they come up there there's no fate you got to tell them your name is so and so your house number is so and so and then the face that to raise yeah because they know he didn't he don't know that and then when the fith get excited and they get build up then they receive the healing and so there was an Indian woman come from the reservation and she came up with crutches and her faith was so anointed when she came to B brandham she hand him the crutches and walk off the platform he didn't have to pray for her because her faith was anointed for you to get that break your faith must be anointed and next woman take a pray CL she in a wheelchair she put the pray said th Spirit come out and she walk out the wheelchair her subconscious was lined up she believe that demon leaving right now oh give the Lord a shout you can be healed right now come on now Hallelujah that Centurion man that came to Jesus he said he recognized Jesus have authority he recognized Jesus under Authority because to have authority you have to be under Authority the police have authority because there's a whole law behind them that authorized them to have authority so he came to Jesus because he had a revelation of his authority he's a centurion is that right ahead of a 100 men or a th men or whatever he said I say to one go he explained the Revelation and he have to go I say to one come and he have to say one come if you say oh Hallelujah so that man was speaking from a reality from a subconscious reality so he know Jesus could do it he said don't even come under my roof but just speak the word and I know my servant shall be healed and Jesus said my God he said go thy way now watch to show you it was at the subconscious level when the man was going back home he didn't ask if the man heal he said what time what time what time he he know it's finished and when you know it's finished by his stripes you have got to know it's finished for you you may be seated look at John Ryan pass through the prayer line prop pray for him and pronounce you are healed but he was a Catholic he has no faith not no Foundation he come back and say you're healed he was healed it hasn't manifested yet but he was healed so he said go and say by stripe I'm Healed he's saying that by strip I'm Healed extra extra he's selling Pap by strip I'm Healed people laughing at him I'm a blind man saying by I'm Healed by St I'm Healed by I'm Healed he going on the barber chair and all of a sudden it pop up what the thing happened there the faith dropped down from conscious to subconscious what thing happened there mental Faith dropped down a spiritual Revel then it was over your troubles could be over today so don't say God feel sorry for me it's not sorry God God not in your feeling thing feeling sorry oh if God was feeling Sor oh God who you could choose said none so God say I go serve all that you know I pick them before the and lose them on the earth Satan do so much no more afterward afterwards son he came to himself my God the devil dragg you mud drag you all kind of condition but some point in time you have to come to yourself my God and about w PR a masterpiece of he came to himself and he admit and responsibility for his behavior he said I will arise I will say to my father I have sinned and I'm coming back I only a son could do that you know a cousin and Aunt ande can do that you know son could do thatall hallu you can running and see President Obama you know coming and see President can I see President Obama please who are you but his daughters that's the father am could you do you think I have an opportunity to see the president did you have that when them walk inside they walk and they open the door for them that's a son coming that's a daughter coming so when when when when God see you come on Angels when that's why we the time to dance Hallelujah that's why devil rejoices when one sinner come to repentance Heaven the S th open because another son coming home Hall you will be seated and If Heaven rejoices our son coming back home what you think heaven will do when the sons of God come into manifestation when the whole creation is groaning for the manifestation of the sons of God when born Sons spirit filled Sons Holy Ghost anointed Sons Messiah Oh Glory to God stepping forth on the earth let's go a little further be seated God don't look at your intellectual Faith he looks on the heart where on the inside and when it com from the heart then all things are possible your confession meets up with your life that's why a lot of unbelieving people come into the Bram meetings and got healed and Christians long old standing Christians with no faith went back with the sickness because God is not looking at your long standing church member your long any message forget it glory amen oh make him feel excited Hallelujah my God people feel God have do with taking with time and they come service you you come regular tick you always on time tick pay TI tick God no bookkeeper who he call God not worried nothing surprises God God does know me I big and say wo I didn't expect that I wasn't looking for that God know all things and he said all things put together for good to them that love God to them who had he called according to his purpose you better have a smile you better start to laugh because you're going to get that breakthrough your bondage is temporary your sickness is temporary your hardship is temporary Financial pressure is temporary too Lord amen hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah when your confession says one thing yes and your life lives another there was something wrong somewhere that's because you got intellectual faith and not a Faith from your heart and that shows that outside here is a knowledge of God inside is a demon doubting I believe in Divine Healing but it's not for me you see it could be so but I don't believe it outside you say yes inside your conscious say no so you're agreeing with the preacher on the conscious level but at subconscious level you're not agreeing some people take what they want they feel the words like chewing gum instead of digesting it and making it bit in the belly they m and afterwards they take it on push it on his side they push it on the Belt they push it on his side they stick it on the table and whatnot take the word like chingum God say the word of Trum he said eat it it's sweet in the mouth but you have to digest it for it to be bitter in the belly some people like the sweet in the mouth they like bit in the belly so they spit it out afterwards but God want the word to sink down you have to get an experience with the word hallelujah can we go a little further if you notice the subconscious is where you live amen that's right that's where you live that's the reason people it's hard for them to have faith up here they say yes I got faith but down here it it's not for you if you can get God to say I am the Lord that healed thee this first conscious I am the Lord that healed the and the subc conscience said I'm the Lord that healed the you are going forward hallelujah amen amen but when God say I'm the Lord Heal thee and subconscious said I believe it's so but said are you quite sure then you're not going to anywhere you run around in circles you have got to get both working together and in harmony then you can move forward amen he said now watch and this is bringing back something here from the UN song I say a few days ago speaking on a light detector notice I want you to pay close attention put a light detector on you you try to impersonate the truth try to say that truth but down on the inside of you watch in the subconscious lays a place called the soul and this intellectual mind this big this is big this intellectual mind does not govern the vibration of that system all right that is why when they put in the machine and said did you do it and they B no I didn't know it the Moine doing so he did it he did it he did it he did it he did it because your mouth saying no you seeing it nice and everything else but your subconscious half beaten fast your pressure raising up because your subconscious stay so you not seeing the machine you only had the instrument and they asking different questions and see the machine doing so yes he did it the mind is only the director it will direct you but it is here this this's a big one it is incapable of bringing you to God oh I hope God gave me the grace to finish this today I'm not going to be long in subconscious we have a message but all this is part of what I was given to present to you this morning you see because a lot of people only hear me message intellectually when the real Go gospel begin to preach you will see the difference in this very same message remember the disciples when Jesus raised from the dead remember before Jesus died they was the Weeping depressed don't go don't go he said don't go the com will not come and when he died and he rose from the dead men depressed men D out and Jesus come among them they don't know his Jesus and he said why are you sad he said you don't know Jesus of nazare a man approve of God he dead and that was the third day and they all kind of thing and Jesus bust them he rebuked them he said but my God didn't the scripture say that didn't the scripture say that oh slow slow on fools and slow of heart to believe all what the scripture had said then when he raised among them he introduced them a new kind of Fate it's Resurrection fate it's an anointed Faith it's a faith to know he's not only dead but he is raised from the dead He's Alive they can say He Is Risen oh Hallelujah when he leing this time they were happy they W him byebye he was was taken up because they knew their promis is next oh give the Lord a shout of Praise hallelujah hallelujah they know the comforter was coming they know the Holy Ghost was coming they know dyamic was coming they know power was coming they know the anointing was coming they knew they were going to be Messiah because Jesus said behold I send the promise of my father upon you then he breathed upon them receive the Holy Ghost so there was no need to be depressed they were afraid but they was confident that God will to keep the promise that's why they went in the upper room that's why they lock all the doors they were afraid but they believe they were afraid of them outside but they were waiting for the lion of the tribe of Judah anointing yet they were waiting for the super anointing it's okay to be struggling it's okay to be afraid it's okay to be unsure sometimes but you are under a promise and that's the main thing man didn't give you that promise and man can hold it back from you that is your promise you are not a little child God want you to be a man and woman son and daughter not some man over you God had promised to make some priest between you and him God had promised no intercessor except Jesus Christ he want to make you a king he want to make you a priest he want to make you have dominion in your home over sickness over every condition you don't have to call the pastor for everything you have authority as a son and daughter of God the Bible said these signs shall follow the ministers it didn't say that it said these signs shall follow them that believe give me a shout in the house say after me them that believe that believe them that believe believe say it again them that believe Give the Lord some Praises hallu hallelujah hallelujah you cannot know God by your mind intellectual it's one of the resources or channels that would lead you to it but your soul is what governs you you are what you are by your soul hallelujah amen hallelujah hallu Jesus Jesus said to the Pharisees why are you Hypocrites how can you speak good things when you call them good master and so forth he said out of the bond of the heart speaketh the lips in your heart you hate me and in your lips you call me good Master he say you're Hypocrites Jesus was seeing straight through them they hate him in their heart but he a good Master good master and Jesus seen them clean like to cellophant people see straight through Hallelujah the young man come to Jesus good Master what shall I do to herit inal life Jesus Jesus said the Commandments Thou shalt not do this th he said but but but but but all these I do for my youth what lack I yet on the word going down inside now and see that money demon inside of there see that lust inside of there he said well all you need to do is to sell all what you have and you know mean come follow me Bible say Jesus loved him man was nice shoes looking good have a nice cologne on time matching pants nice dude but unwilling to pay the price to get that light to go further there's always a price to get Revival there's a price to get power there's a price to break out there's a price there is always a price that's why the prophet said the world will bow at the feet of men and women who Cross Jordan Jordan is De Glory Hallelujah Jesus and this is the cap of what of this portion here from why we not denomination he said now when you let your faith run out to its end till you begin to believe Lord and let your subconscious go to acting then the faith of God will back it upj Hallelujah let me read it again these things you can't preach this these things are spirit-given words this is what the tape is saying your faith run out you believe for your son believe in your daughter you believe for years Keep On Believing don't stop now don't say nothing happening believe the prophet used that term when Abraham came to the fullness of believing you think you know Abraham believed God Abraham was had good miserable things to you you think every day was a night of Abraham oh Jesus is so sweet sometimes SAR didn't cook for him CU Sarah God didn't tell Sarah anything so he had what Sarah Sarah feel to cook baked she feel to cook this she feeling miserable and Abra had to believe God and Abram can't divorce Sarah because Sarah is who Abra God say he can't put Sarah out because God say it's Sarah so Sarah could be however he had to watch and believe you have to pray and believe you have to put his hand around that woman and believe you have to love her believe help me somebody preach back to me man amen believe God not Sarah Sarah didn't believe because because God didn't tell Sarah anything so Abram had to believe for Sarah and Abram say tired tired weary I tell the woman go tell me go talk to her you telling her and she hearing it right here in her subconscious in her mental fith she she has no spiritual Revelation Abraham have Isaac inside his heart he's seeing the baby he's seeing Isaac he don't know how he going to be because God can lie I don't know how all them vires go flow out but God can't lie I don't know how the ministry of Jesus Christ will come for but God can't lie there going to be signs wonders Miracles God can't lie there going to be Messiah on the earth God can't lie Give the Lord a shout you are going to be healed you are going to be delivered you are going to be filled God can't lie Give the Lord a shout you shout you worship let me see this so when your faith runs out to its end till you begin to Believe come on then your subconscious go to acting then the faith of God will back it up then you'll go right out on out cuz your faith won't do too much your subconscious has to move in the direction that your faith is moving and then God faith moves behind that and confirms it oh my Hallelujah glory and says do you believe that lady speaking that lady here sitting right here you had more faith than you thought you had speaking to a lady he said you had more faith than you thought you had see faith is a subconscious Thing lady faith is not a mental act it is something you do subconsciously do it people try to look to the intellects for Faith When Faith doesn't lay in there reason lays there Faith lays in the soul now the trouble with your foot and leg you believe that Jesus Christ make you well you accept it believe it have a that rightous too but Jesus Christ make you well you believe it all right then you can have it it was that simple it was that simple my God you could walk out here I don't care if your back stiff foot stiff knee stiff you could walk out here walking normal normal normal brother brand was on the platform and people were getting the healing in the congregation with no cards and the pillar of fire will move off the platform and say that Jesus just just heal you and he come back here and start to say your name is Pillar of Fire moving across there that woman across that diabetes Jesus just healed you praise God what happening there what happening there their faith pulling the pillar of fire their faith pulling their breakthrough they Faith pulling what they need of let me give you a stinger but said be sensitive respond because leave you so there were people who was the pillar fire upon them and they taken too long to respond and they just move off from them he said believe you he said be sensitive to respond that's when you feel the anointing do something you feel the power do something the ano come to help your faith anoint your faith inspire you droping some B like verot you're dry your home dry everything dry around you all of a sudden God drop something for you I you doing like Drop nothing hallelujah how God supposed to feel but you take it back up Hallelujah let just see a little Cloud Like a Man start to run cuz you know rain coming you wait to see a whole basket of blessings the first little sign you see your hand all cripp up your finger never move your one finger move and you're still there looking like you just want to play with one finger you got to be kidding me all these years your hand tight like that one finger move you should be shouting cuz one could move the next one could move all could move your hand could move Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah from the indictment can we take a little more of course you can take a little more Church okay the indictment the church hated him Christ why he was the very God they hated him they Deni him to be the Messiah they didn't want such a messiah as that I remember think pilot one of them I say are you the king of the Jews he say Jesus said you you say that of yourself or all others tell you that that that that your own Revelation or others tell you I'm the king of the Jews then Jesus buses in them he said my kingdom is not of this world and that is the problem people only know church but Jesus said Upon This Rock I'll build my church not this building here not this this is not the church this not what Jesus Built it's Revelation he's talking about and it's a kingdom he's talking about and in that Kingdom nobody can put you in Hallelujah and nobody can take you Hallelujah out then that make you a kingdom person and I'm declaring that you are Kingdom people I want you to leave your think indiff that you don't belong to this Earth You are citizen of above Hallelujah all right let's go further today the church has the same thing it denies the word they don't want it and the word is the Messiah you believe that the congregation says amen well the reflection of the word is what a reflection of the Messiah which is the Holy Ghost Among Us he is reflecting himself this is Brother brandham five defin definite identification of the true church as I travel around the world Amen I find every nation has his own spirit all nations are controlled by the devil all governments ruled by the devil Bible said so they fight the War till Jesus comes now Jesus know okay when you go to Germany you find a German Spirit you go to England English Spirit go to Sweden Swedish Spirit you come to America you find the American Spirit now we never compel men or woman to dress or not to drink or not to swear we just preach the gospel lay down the pattern of the Bible and many men that come to the Pentecostal faith and Holiness Faith come in and profess to be when they're not in their heart many woman does the same thing we don't tell them they have to do do it we just give them the pattern tell them what the Bible says and then they are born of a Heavenly Spirit here we go here we go then their spirit is no more Americanized it's no more germanized it is Heavenly lized for the kingdom of God I was in India when I see the Holy Ghost fell upon an El in your lady and I saw a spin around and say wo is one Holy Ghost it have one effect it fall here it fall in Africa it fall in America it's one Holy Ghost it's one Lord is one Spirit calling people from everywhere oh do you believe that now watch here we say now because we are in another kingdom a kingdom of God with decency Holiness and power exist we have access to our King do you believe that we have an interview with him whenever we want to call upon him we have no other intercessor says no other mediator between the king and us but the one man Christ Jesus so we are living in a kingdom and it is called in the chronology of the Bible the Messiah Kingdom in other words here we go the Messiah rules in every life in his Dominion amen ruling the lives of his people are called out people from every Walk of Life Gathering them together in a group and then call it his church his call out one isn't that a beautiful thing so this Messiah Empire or Messiah kingdom is where Christ Reigns in the people's lives not the minister Conquering the people beating the people pushing the people but the Messiah infecting and invading your own life then you understand what it is to be a Christian as opposed to be a church member then you really want to be a Christian because Christian be a Christian anywhere take you and drop you in Iceland in New Zealand Australia anywhere you would still be a Christian Hallelujah even if you don't have a church you will still be a Christian oh give the Lord a shout and the Israel was the people of God until they were called out from other churches other religion to walk with God alone and the Church of got today is the same thing called out to walk not being governed by a bishop or being govern by but being governed by Christ in this Messiah Kingdom we live in Christ is King Christ is the one now Christ is the head of this Messiah kingdom here we go are you ready you cannot organize a kingdom of which Christ is the head am amen you cannot denominate a kingdom which Christ is the head Hallelujah because Christ is King and you cannot take the intellectuals of man and make an organization to which Christ will govern therefore any companies any peoples any groups of men that tries to organize the kingdom of God is going contrary to the king and if they're going to contrary to the king it will be against the king and if it's against the king it will be Antichrist amen yes sir amen amen amen amen so an antichrist Spirit tries to take a people and call them from organization to organization organize them together which was never the will of God people has always fussed at me because I struck so hard at organization it isn't the people in there I'm striking at it's that dominating Spirit here we go that make the people think we are the people see that is what the organization Spirit does we are it we are it and the others not it we are on the others are off

free God church is not bound by No Boundaries because from sea to sea is God every human on earth belongs to him whether he's Catholic Protestant whatever he is God seeks those with an honest heart we are not saved we are saved by faith believe in him that's the church now you see the church is not an organization now let's go further now now the real born again Christian is a werer in the sight of of the world he's a renegade but in the sight of God he's precious I wish I had time to speak about the rise of the faith and so on I skip this down now the Church of the Living God can never be any certain group CRA crack shoot that down I want to say it again say it again the Church of the Living oh let me just back up a little bit you say um people say are you a Christian they say I'm a Baptist that don't answer the question at all am I a Christian I'm Pentecost that's don't answer the question if you are Christian you are born again creature you are in a Mystic kingdom of God your eyes are not on the things of this world but on the things above and that's when you are in the church that is the church it is not an organization it can never be an organization take me on record this words before we just said this this is brother take me on record the Church of the Living God can never be a certain group amen amen amen it cannot be an organization it has to be the mystical body the Holy Spirit what if every Pastor was preaching this this statement here I'm telling the people that people have more respects for churches and groups then the people will be judged by what group they go to they say God bless you how you doing and so what what CH you going to by brother over then the eyeb rais up so like meet brother God bless you God bless you he said what chur you go

there you see the Pentecost I'm not saying the Pentecost is just as guilty as the Catholic or Holiness na but in all watch all them guilty but yeah what you say but in all those denominational churches God has children therefore you cannot judge one person and judge the whole church she so therefore they so but I'm say you deser the individual not the church somebody coming here they don't know somebody back sitting if this is the first time they visiting they don't know what condition they in they may be somebody now getting restored and they don't like how they're looking they don't like how they're dressed they don't like this they don't like that what you like Hallelujah when God look at you what God see like sometimes somebody was playing piano they just a little short and somebody come to brother and whatnot and just short you said but her spirit is a fine spirit amen it's a long dress who horrible in spirit is not long just make you have a nice spirit a fine spirit is

children they belong get this bum they belong to this Mystic Kingdom the only thing they are waiting for is to see that something take place Hallelujah that will draw their hearts into Hall that's why when the anointing strike all the true seeds of God will run into that anointing nobody could stop it this pastor locking them locking down like if them in charge of the church I was a Catholic I was even a acolyte helping the priest but when God called me I Dro priest acolyte everything because God called me time was up my whole family was Catholic but time was up they couldn't hold me back because the call was from God amen it was from my heavenly father so had to take a walk they didn't agree with me they didn't like it but had to take a walk and this is how much years later this is 1975 I'm glad tonight to know that they coming from the east west north and south pulling themselves together worshiping waiting on the come of the Lord so he is the king could we say Amen working his own will in his Dominion not a bishop control or the church boards control but a king which is the Messiah himself working in his own domain he promised a Comon church he promised a Comon Kingdom amen then but refer to acts 18 you shall receive power after the Holy Ghost is come upon you and you shall be Witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and in Judea and in the uttermost part of the earth a common Kingdom Witnesses so you are going to be Witnesses from this Kingdom God don't want to be a spoken book saying God and a prophet that's not a witness of the Kingdom no when the power because the kingdom is not in word when that power begin to vibrate and generate through you then you become a witness a witness have to see something feel something touch something handle something to be a witness you can read and be a witness you got to be dear the car bounce this one this happened here you have to be dear that make you a witness oh God want to make you a witness of his resurrection that the power of the Holy Ghost come into your life and transform you from a church member into a son of the Living God into a messiah Oh Glory to God question who set up this church God Hallelujah Jesus Christ no Bishop I want to say Amen with me right with me these are not my words no Bishop no group of men no Pope no manmade Powers Christ spoke of it his kingdom coming into Power what was Christ's message he was preaching the gospel of the Kingdom Oh Glory to God hallelujah not join here join here join this group here that was not what he was preaching he was preaching a kingdom hallelujah hallelujah but say I'm a bishop that is not a witness I'm a pastor but a witness of what it has to be a resurrection King he quote Colossians who is the head before all things consist Who the head of the church what is the kingdom the Messiah Kingdom the church not the organization is the Mystic Body of Christ what is the church the Mystic Body of Christ who set it up the Lord Jesus Christ himself it wasn't set up in Rome wasn't set up in England by John Wesley or by Calvin or America or Baptist or the Pentecostal it was set up by Jesus Christ the King of the Messiah Kingdom that's who it was set up by he's the king and he wants to be king he wants to rule us he wants to be Lord oh praise God hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah he didn't even let the disciples go out until they got power from on high not not not power because Jesus tell them me have power it had to be power from on high he even dramatized and said somebody say we get it by faith and Peter said said no no no no wait sit down somebody want to go out they they wait after 9 days they wait they had to wait until the day of Pentecost that's right was fully come he tell them with stammering lips you say well Jesus didn't stammer no no you're looking at Jesus but you look at what God promised he promised with stammering lips he promised how it will come isn't that right so people looking at the prophet and this happened and that happened but what did the prophet prophesy because we are living under the prophet's prophecy you understand that he shall turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers the faith of the father not books and tapes reading books and tapes and list books and tapes no the faith of the father was Silver and Gold Have I None such as I give it unto you it was in them resident power permanent power active power virtue power it was in them what was it it was the kingdom of God hallelujah the kingdom was within and if the

become Kings and Priests unto God amen amen like Jesus was God high priest we become a lesser priest God in fullness dwelt in him to shine forth the expression of God to the world for God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself and as God was reconciling the world to himself God comes into this church and anoint him some Messiah amen who comes in the church God what does he do anoint mes Messiah Hallelujah little anointed ones Hallelujah the same thing he did in his church the same power he had in his church and his church becomes his dominion and he is King over his dominion and we are Kings and Priests offering spiritual sacrifices to God the fruit of our lips given praise to his name there you are Messiah little anointed ones that is why I tell you praise him that's why I tell you worship him as a priest you offering up sacrifice your lips giv praise to God and the best time in when to praise him is when you don't feel like praising him because you tell your feelings

Ages through the Dark Ages there's a little minority all the way down keeping the gospel like shining what was it Messiahs amen ones holding forth the representation of the Messiah Kingdom Jesus never failed he just did exactly what he was commissioned to do and he come to establish a kingdom and he did it the kingdom of God comes Into the Heart by the power of the Holy Ghost brings God's spirit upon an anointed Church to perform signs and wonders as he did to prove that Messiah is king of his kingdom so we have to have evidence that we are in that Kingdom we have to have confirmation that we

but Mama we made it oh give the Lord our sh God going to bless you if you go through your trial every prophet of God in the Old Testament was anointed by the Holy Ghost they were Lites he was the fullness of God being the Messiah then was Messiah smaller Messiah for they were Anointed with the same spirit he was anointed with almost done amen oh my now we say man he got a hand like God eyes like God is like God he was fashioned after God he was given on Earth and a Dominion he was made a God over the Earth to rule the Earth a Lesser God God rules the universe but man was given the Earth to rule the Earth he was a messiah yet and that is what it is tonight if he gets back to God he is a messiah at a little Messiah do you see what God want you to be yes sir a little anointed one when you go on the job you're anointed demons on your coworkers have to back up in the spirit realm you not seeing it but when you get the Holy Ghost and Holy Ghost upon you demons upon them is war going on but you have an atmosphere around you if if you're not anointed they could anoint you you know because I'm in spirit but ra driving a man and in a car one time and he said the man spoke a Blue Streak and break the anointing off of him think about it he's the prophet and he had the anointing and a man spoke afterward you be very careful who he carry in the car words are power words are Spirit wrong words wrong Spirit wrong Doctrine release wrong spirit and people don't know what Spirit upon them but they hearing wrong teachings wrong Doctrine afterward they don't even know what they believe they messed up tied up tangled up but the but but BR says the prophet and the bride and the spirit will say the same thing not no cucko thing it will say the same thing no Revelation the word is God all right my Lord my Lord hallelujah says the word is the conduct of the spirit watch and watch the first thing you know and make a blowing song across the building goes the Holy Ghost see it's the conductor of the word or the word is the conductor of the spirit because when the word is preached the spirit follows it wherever it goes so then once the word is being preached you can feel the spirit going through the word so when the word hit you the word come to the Holy Ghost come to anoint you oh my my my so the kingdom of God is the Holy Spirit you belong to that Kingdom am amen oh my they get it thought they are born from above they are different they are citizens from above then you become a kingdom person then you say you are Church boy no I'm a kingdom person I belong to a kingdom where you belong to I belong to a kingdom and and Jesus is king and the King sent a message to a prophet his name is William Marian Branham Mighty Angel brought B the king's message and God said I'm going to Reign on the earth God said I'm a king and a priest God said I'm an overcomer God said I'm more than a conqueror God said I'm I'm a seed in the last days God said I'm one of them children whose Hearts will return back to the face of the father what does that have to do with church say no man had no Li on this message no matter Li I can't say this I can't say that they will keep me out they do have Heaven hell and they can't go to the name of the books how you open the book to take my name off that's like God relasing power because people don't like it they will they will speak you out of existence they would knock you out the kingdom we we don't know you see and that's why you see the conditions are difficult we live in a real rough AG what kind of broken homes broken relationship broken marriages and all lot of things broken up and God expect us to believe him am miss all of that if we look at the condition we will scream hallah if we look at the condition we will run is that I'm righteous and you are not you are righteous and this one not it's not that all have sinned not some all but God sent a word to bring us to one Lord One Faith one baptism one Kingdom I'm almost done there about two more quotes and we done this was good woo Wonder from Oneness the Bible say in the last days there'll be churches another Tower of Babel and you know the thing about it the mistaken church for God yes that's the S thing in this message people mistaken group for security as long as they belong to a church or group or Fellowship you're on your way to the Rapture that's not true the Raptor have to be within you amen amen hallu Enoch walk with God hallu and was not for God took him but before God took him he had a testimony that he pleased God you can't please God without faith but a little deeper his mechanics turned to Dynamics where was his mechanics in him he never the machine you know and he crank up crank he jump in it and go you know en know didn't have WRA the machine the kingdom was in him he took a stroll and tell his wife goodbye we are taking a walk he didn't walk and he walked with God and walked not bam went on to depths of it and said his mechanic turned to Dynamic and he was translated amen he had power on the inside and power come on the outside and his body was in between do you see what I'm saying so the Raptor ain't coming in that sense the Raptor going to be in you because the kingdom going to be in you so you are walking with that Kingdom that's why Jesus is tell him my hour is not yet come you can't touch me don't try to touch me my hour is not yet come when his hour come he my always come oh hallelujah praise the name of the Lord how do you get the okay watch the Bible said in the last days there be churches not to of Babel they'll form uh uh they have a form of godliness deny the power on the word the power of His word what is his word the kingdom of God we've got to belong to the kingdom before we can ever be subjects to the king I like that we've got to belong to the kingdom before we can be subjects of the king well how do we get in the Kingdom the kingdom of God are you ready is the word of God made back in power that's why Jesus could say the kingdom is within you but the word comes into you as a seed and whenever God turn the word into Power that's the kingdom inside of you that's the Holy Ghost inside of you that's Dynamics inside of you so he has to get the word in first because the Pentecostal got Spirit on them but they couldn't make it through because they didn't have the word so they fail with spirit so God s a prophet to bring back the word that God could use his word as a conductor of the spirit there is my spirit flowing freely I'm not using men just men but I'm using my word in men come on now come on now do you see it do you see it because power have to connect with character without character is satanic and that's what you see with the Pentecostal there was no life there there was no word there there was no conductor there but once God get back the conductor the spirit can flow so here we go now there's only one thing you can put confidence in is the
