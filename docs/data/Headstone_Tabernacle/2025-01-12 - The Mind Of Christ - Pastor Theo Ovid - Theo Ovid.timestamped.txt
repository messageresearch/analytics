[47:00] message I do have something like to
[47:01] share before we get into the word this
[47:04] morning with Bram in the Rapture he said
[47:07] Remember the same God said that Los
[47:10] Angeles is
[47:11] doomed and she is
[47:14] finished I don't know when I Can't Tell
[47:18] You Jesus said Capernaum you have
[47:21] exalted yourself into heaven you shall
[47:24] be brought into hell for Mighty Works
[47:27] has been done in you had been done in
[47:29] Sodom it stood
[47:31] today and the same spirit of God that
[47:34] said all these things and done all these
[47:36] things it said oh City
[47:38] capernum who call yourself by the name
[47:41] of the angels Los
[47:43] Angeles how you have exalted yourself
[47:46] into heaven the very root and seat of
[47:50] Satan you have exalted
[47:53] yourself preachers it's a graveyard for
[47:55] them good good men go and die like
[47:58] rats what a Havoc you that call yourself
[48:02] by the name of the Angels if the mighty
[48:05] Works have been done in s and been done
[48:06] in you it you stood today but your hour
[48:09] has come you watch and see if it ain't
[48:13] I'm a false prophet she is yes she is
[48:16] she is laying there so we know the
[48:18] prophet prophesied that was Angel is
[48:20] going to go down to the bottom but I
[48:23] want to read a scripture from Jeremiah
[48:25] chapter 21 two verses there verse 13 and
[48:28] 14 God
[48:30] speaks he says behold I'm against thee
[48:35] Oh inhabitant of the valley and rock of
[48:39] the plain seeth the Lord with see who
[48:42] shall come down against us or who shall
[48:45] enter in our
[48:47] habitations but I will punish you
[48:51] according to the fruit of your doings
[48:53] seeth the Lord and I will Kindle a fire
[48:57] in the forest thereof and it shall
[49:00] devour all things round about
[49:04] it second scri I want to read is from
[49:06] second Peter familiar one I'm going to
[49:10] it talk about verse six about the water
[49:12] being overflowed but I want to go for in
[49:15] verse seven of second Peter but the
[49:17] heavens and the Earth which are now by
[49:20] the same word I kept in Store Reserve
[49:23] unto fire against the day of judgment
[49:26] and of ungodly men but beloved be not
[49:29] ignorant of this one thing that one day
[49:32] is with the Lord as a thousand years as
[49:35] a thousand years as one day the Lord is
[49:39] not slack concering his promise as some
[49:41] men can slackness but is longsuffering
[49:44] to usw I remember a woman telling Mar
[49:47] you know she living in sin this all kind
[49:48] of stuff she said nothing happen to me
[49:51] and she doesn't understand that is the
[49:54] longsuffering of God and people carrying
[49:57] all s of foolishness and don't
[49:58] understand is the longsuffering of God
[50:00] but here the Bible says God doesn't
[50:01] consider slackness his promise he said
[50:04] watch not willing that any should perish
[50:06] but that all should come to repentance
[50:08] but the day of the Lord will come as a
[50:09] thief in the night in which the heavens
[50:11] shall pass away with a great noise and
[50:14] the element shall melt with fervent heat
[50:17] the Earth also and the works that are
[50:19] therein shall be burnt up seeing then
[50:21] that all these things shall be dissolved
[50:25] what manner of persons ought he to be in
[50:27] all holy conversation that is living and
[50:32] godliness looking for and hasten unto
[50:35] the coming of the day of God wherein the
[50:37] heavens being on fire shall be dissolved
[50:39] and the element shall melt with a fent
[50:41] heat nevertheless we according to his
[50:44] promise look for a new Heaven A New
[50:46] Earth wherein there righteousness
[50:49] therefore uh beloved seeing that you
[50:51] look for such things be diligent that
[50:53] you may be found of him in peace without
[50:56] spot
[50:57] and
[50:58] blameless amen praise God so we know
[51:01] that uh Los Angeles have some serious
[51:04] fire going on right now it says there
[51:07] about $ 59 billion worth of
[51:10] damage and uh a lot of the Hollywood
[51:13] Elites and movie stars and whoever uh
[51:15] $20 million home burn completely down to
[51:18] the ground the satellite pictures of
[51:20] that is is like a war like a what you
[51:23] call like a
[51:25] desolation and
[51:27] you know there's a scripture that talk
[51:28] about God said I will send fire on the
[51:30] wall I will send fire to the Palace I
[51:32] will send fire and that is what God
[51:36] speaks of a individual or Country Pride
[51:40] strength and
[51:41] security and they feel you have money
[51:44] and you feel you have this and
[51:45] everything will be fine God say I will
[51:47] send
[51:48] fire righteous judgments of Nations
[51:53] cities and individuals so fire represent
[51:58] that destruction but I want to read a
[52:00] scripture from Zephaniah it's a book we
[52:02] don't really
[52:04] touch uh I'm going to just jump a bit
[52:07] the word of the Lord Z is one of these
[52:09] small guys don't get them up small
[52:13] prophets the word of the Lord which came
[52:15] into Zephaniah the son of Kushi the son
[52:17] of Jalia the son of amariah the son of
[52:20] Hezekiah hisia in the days of Josiah the
[52:23] son of Amon king of Judah I will utterly
[52:26] consume all things from of the land this
[52:28] is the God we serve there's not no
[52:30] Mickey Mouse God this is not no Santa
[52:32] Claus God this is the god what we
[52:34] reading here is the God we serving this
[52:35] morning this is the god of the
[52:38] word I will utterly consume all things
[52:41] from off the land sayth the Lord I will
[52:43] consume man and Beast I will consume the
[52:45] Falls of the heaven the fishes of the
[52:46] sea the stumbling blocks with the wicked
[52:50] I will cut off man from off the land
[52:52] sayth the
[52:54] Lord I will also strch out my hand upon
[52:57] Judah upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem
[53:00] I will cut off the remnant of Beal from
[53:02] his Palace from his place and all the
[53:04] name of CH and the priests me skip a
[53:08] little bit verse eight it shall come to
[53:11] pass in the day of the Lord's sacrifice
[53:13] that I will punish the princes and the
[53:16] King's children and all as are clothed
[53:19] with strange perel in the same day I
[53:22] will punish all I'll skip that nine but
[53:25] here one I want to go down to
[53:26] um verse 14 let's go on to ver 14 the
[53:30] great day of the Lord is near it is near
[53:34] and he said greatly even the voice of
[53:37] the day of the Lord the mighty man shall
[53:39] cry there bitterly that day is a day of
[53:42] rra a day of trouble and distress a day
[53:45] of wastesson a day of darkness and
[53:49] gloominess a day of clothes and thick
[53:51] Darkness a day of trumpet and alarm
[53:53] against the fence cities against the
[53:55] high to
[53:57] I will bring distress upon men they
[53:59] shall walk like Blind Men because they
[54:01] have sinned against the Lord and their
[54:04] blood shall be poured out as dust and
[54:06] their flesh as the dong neither listen
[54:10] neither their silver nor their gold
[54:14] shall be able to deliver them in that
[54:17] day of the Lord's wrath let me read that
[54:19] line again neither their silver nor
[54:23] their gold shall be able to deliver them
[54:25] in the day of the Lord's wrath but the
[54:28] whole land shall be devoured by the fire
[54:31] of his jealousy for he shall make even a
[54:34] speedy riddance of all them that are in
[54:37] the land and this is what brother
[54:39] brandham said in a message called the
[54:40] angel of the Lord Brother step Al very
[54:42] shared with me he said over in the east
[54:44] coast they always hollering to me why

[54:50] pulls out to Los Angeles maybe that's
[54:52] God's place that's right right here is
[54:56] probably where judgment will strike and
[55:00] that's right let's get ready my this
[55:04] will probably the first place it will be
[55:08] hit right here oh Church hold to God's
[55:12] unchanging
[55:14] hand let's put that again brother Shan
[55:16] put it up for me I want over in the east
[55:19] coast they always Hing to me why you're
[55:22] going to the West Coast everybody pulls
[55:24] out to Los Angeles maybe that's God's
[55:26] place that's right right here is

[55:33] will probably be the first place it'll
[55:36] hit right in here oh Church hold to
[55:38] God's unchanging hand and pray at this
[55:41] time I want to show you a little clip of
[55:44] what is happening across there and we
[55:45] just take a look and we continue from
[55:47] there
[55:53] shame I welcome to three news
[55:56] the struggle to save Los Angeles from
[55:58] the worst wildfires ever visited on the
[56:01] city still seems like a one-sided fight
[56:05] 120 square kilometers an area larger
[56:07] than Hamilton of both scrubland and
[56:10] Prime real estate has been incinerated
[56:14] turning affluent neighborhoods into
[56:15] Landscapes of Ash and charred ruins CBS
[56:19] is reporting that 9,000 structures have
[56:22] been lost the Palisades eaten and Hearst
[56:25] fires are still r
[56:26] while a new Blaze called the Kenneth
[56:28] fire has sprung up in San Fernando
[56:31] Valley and Incredibly only seven people
[56:34] have been confirmed dead thanks to
[56:36] mandatory evacuation orders affecting
[56:39] 180,000 people Senor reporter Juliet
[56:42] Speedy has
[56:45] more the road into Pacific Palisades in
[56:49] the aftermath of the wild fire a
[56:51] shocking journey through destruction and
[56:54] it soon becomes clear this fire is still
[56:57] consuming homes and businesses all along
[57:00] Sunset Boulevard the scenes here show
[57:03] that the mandatory evacuation orders
[57:05] saved hundreds if not thousands of lives
[57:08] and from the year the scale of the
[57:10] tragedy becomes Starker still entire
[57:13] neighborhoods lost to the
[57:15] Flames underresourced firefighters
[57:18] working in strong winds Around the Clock
[57:22] we're we're running out of water this is
[57:24] the worst one for me worst one I've ever
[57:26] SE
[57:27] no
[57:28] question this resident has briefly
[57:30] returned to see the scale of the
[57:32] disaster at less than 24 hours the
[57:35] neighborhood gone leveled disappeared I
[57:38] was in tears with my still choked up
[57:42] with um with my daughter right now it's
[57:46] you know it's a lot of lot of hard work
[57:50] building building a business and seeing
[57:53] this it's tough very
[57:57] tough you better take pictures of the
[58:00] house right now for residents daring to
[58:03] go back just a glimpse what they have
[58:05] lost the emotion is overwhelming one of
[58:08] the most desirable places to live in
[58:10] America now a
[58:13] [Music]
[58:15] hellscape it's like Armageddon when you
[58:17] can see the Flames coming up over the
[58:19] houses and you're just getting out of
[58:22] the driveway and the the smoke and the
[58:24] ash is so thick I'm surprised all of us
[58:27] got out of
[58:28] there a mailbox but no house to serve a
[58:32] child's toy and the abandoned remains of
[58:35] an attempt to load up a car Nature has
[58:38] had the upper hand in the City of Angels
[58:41] the infamous s Anna winds scale Force at
[58:44] times changing direction with a fiery
[58:46] trail of Destruction it's extremely
[58:49] difficult to predict it's extremely
[58:51] difficult to contain that's pretty much
[58:54] like a hurricane except instead of rain
[58:56] we had fire it is safe to say that the
[59:00] Palisades fire is one of the most
[59:03] destructive natural disasters in the
[59:06] history of Los Angeles a new fire gained
[59:09] traction last night this time in the
[59:11] Hollywood Hills the places where you'd
[59:13] come to dream Sunset Hollywood Boulevard
[59:16] Mal Halland Drive named synonymous with
[59:19] the movie industry that is Al's bread
[59:21] and butter it's many of those who've
[59:24] reached the top whose homes have now
[59:26] burned to the
[59:31] ground those who have reached to the top
[59:34] whose houses have burned to the ground
[59:38] and to think this is just the
[59:40] introduction the real disaster Is Yet To
[59:43] Come where it will sink straight down
[59:47] into the sea and brother brandham says
[59:50] that the ocean would go back into desert
[59:52] into the sultant it will go back to the
[59:54] desert way back into the desert it uh
[59:58] this year has been starting very
[1:00:00] dramatic as you see from the very
[1:00:02] beginning it hasn't even pass January
[1:00:05] yet and the drama and the wheels are
[1:00:07] already turning what is fixing friends
[1:00:11] is
[1:00:11] judgment is God R in other words after a
[1:00:16] while after 120 years with Noah God got
[1:00:19] fed up he repented he made man and and
[1:00:23] and and the Bible talk about Noah found
[1:00:25] Grace in the eyes of the Lord
[1:00:26] and then God came down and shut the door
[1:00:29] then everybody inside the ark knew that
[1:00:31] was
[1:00:32] Supernatural uh Noah didn't go and close
[1:00:35] the door God shut the door and this door
[1:00:38] to the Gentiles this door to Salvation
[1:00:40] this door to Deliverance this door to
[1:00:41] break through one day will be closed so
[1:00:44] we have to begin to realize that this
[1:00:45] message is not a gimmick is not a show
[1:00:48] is not a religion is God s a prophet
[1:00:51] notice what the Bible talk about the
[1:00:53] righteous shall walk on the ashes of the
[1:00:55] wicked
[1:00:56] behold I send you Elijah the prophet
[1:00:58] when before that great and Terri of the
[1:01:00] lord it's just that we have many many
[1:01:02] years waiting for this hour some of us
[1:01:05] in the 70s 80s '90s and so on but we
[1:01:09] will live to see it with our own eyes a
[1:01:11] lot of things you're going to live to
[1:01:13] see many of them in Hollywood didn't
[1:01:15] expect to see what they're seeing and
[1:01:17] there was a time when they came up in
[1:01:18] the car to hit the road now there was so
[1:01:21] much traffic nothing was moving you know
[1:01:23] what they had to do leave the cars and
[1:01:25] walk
[1:01:26] and the cars burn down if they had stay
[1:01:29] in the perish but I have to leave the
[1:01:31] fancy car the mercedesbenz and the BMWs
[1:01:34] and you name it all the fancy you can
[1:01:36] think about that to leave them and
[1:01:41] walk so when God begin to move God going
[1:01:44] to move him remember God is not a man
[1:01:47] God is no respected of persons when
[1:01:49] judgment strikes a land drop and strike
[1:01:51] the whole land not because you in the
[1:01:53] land Dr strike you when God say
[1:01:55] everybody going to Bon is everybody to
[1:01:57] Bon you know whether you Daniel whether
[1:01:59] sh whether M
[1:02:01] wheo who you are and how long you are
[1:02:04] you going into
[1:02:06] bondage so we are grateful to God
[1:02:08] tonight so let's sing that song and hold
[1:02:11] to God unchanging hand oh let's all
[1:02:14] stand we want to just switch a little
[1:02:15] bit oh to God's on my brother
[1:02:20] oh to God's
[1:02:23] unchanging hand
[1:02:26] my sister
[1:02:28] hold to God's unchanging
[1:02:34] hand you must
[1:02:37] build your hopes on things
[1:02:44] true
[1:02:46] oh to God
[1:02:48] unchanging
[1:02:50] hand when our journey is
[1:02:53] completed when your your journey is

[1:06:22] our Bibles to 1 Corinthians 2 we want to
[1:06:26] read
[1:06:26] 11-16 and Philippians chapter 2 we want
[1:06:29] to read 1 to8 1 Corinthians chapter 2
[1:06:32] reading ver verse
[1:06:35] 11
[1:06:39] okay for what man knoweth the things of
[1:06:42] a man save the spirit of a man which is
[1:06:44] in him even so the things of God knoweth
[1:06:48] no man but the spirit of God now we have
[1:06:53] received not the spirit of the world but
[1:06:56] the spirit which is of god that we might
[1:06:58] know the things that are freely given to
[1:07:01] us of God which things also we speak not
[1:07:05] in The Words which man's Wisdom teacheth
[1:07:08] but which the Holy Ghost teacheth
[1:07:11] comparing spiritual things with
[1:07:13] spiritual but the natural man receiveth
[1:07:16] not the things of the spirit of God for
[1:07:19] they are foolishness unto him neither
[1:07:21] can he know them because they are
[1:07:24] spiritually discerned
[1:07:26] but he that is spiritual judgeth all
[1:07:29] things yet he himself is judged of no
[1:07:32] man for who had known the mind of the
[1:07:35] Lord that he may instruct him but we
[1:07:39] have the mind of Christ and from Phil
[1:07:44] Philippians chapter 2 and there is a
[1:07:46] scripture we have read a couple of times
[1:07:49] if there be any consolation in Christ if
[1:07:52] any comfort of love if any Fellowship of
[1:07:55] spirit if any borrows and of mercies
[1:07:58] fulfilling my joy that you be likeminded
[1:08:01] having the same love being of one Accord
[1:08:03] of one mind let nothing be done through
[1:08:06] Strife or vain Glory but in loneliness
[1:08:08] of mind is a mindset Let each esteem
[1:08:11] other better than themselves look not
[1:08:14] every man on his own things but every
[1:08:17] man on the things of others let this
[1:08:19] mind being you which was also in Christ
[1:08:22] Jesus who been in the form of God taught
[1:08:24] not Rob to equal with God made himself
[1:08:27] of no reputation and took upon him the
[1:08:30] form of a servant and was made in the
[1:08:32] likeness of men and being found in
[1:08:34] fashion as a man he humbled himself and
[1:08:37] became obedient unto death even the
[1:08:39] death of the Cross let's bow head father
[1:08:40] we read your word tonight and I pray
[1:08:42] that you would come Among Us in a
[1:08:44] special way and take me out of the way
[1:08:46] and speak to our hearts and we can leave
[1:08:48] you change people a people drawn closer
[1:08:50] to you a people that would surrender
[1:08:53] repent and lay upon your altar Grant
[1:08:55] gred father in Jesus name we ask it amen
[1:08:57] and amen God bless you have a seat
[1:08:59] praise God
[1:09:01] Amen so this morning I have a title the
[1:09:04] mind of Christ and I have a inspiration
[1:09:07] altering our thinking to his
[1:09:14] thinking and we'll get to it but but
[1:09:16] baram says your mind makes your
[1:09:18] character we get that all right so the
[1:09:21] mind of Christ having a perspective and
[1:09:25] understand standing shaped by the Holy
[1:09:28] Spirit a mindset that affects your
[1:09:32] thoughts attitudes and
[1:09:36] action amen as a Believer it means to be
[1:09:41] truly Guided by the Holy Spirit to act
[1:09:45] and think and do and work as God will
[1:09:47] for your very life but brand so we're
[1:09:50] going to read we read this before I want
[1:09:52] to bring it back again he says Christ

[1:45:25] God door God shut no man can open and
[1:45:29] what God door man God open no man can
[1:45:31] shut don't you be borderline with God
[1:45:35] don't you just be a good man or a good
[1:45:37] woman you be filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:45:40] baptized into the body by the Holy Ghost
[1:45:43] don't take no hear say nothing about it
[1:45:46] stay there until you are dead your life
[1:45:49] is new in Christ and your whole life is
[1:45:53] is changed not a New
[1:45:58] Dress your life is changed not a new car
[1:46:03] a two tie and new shoes your life is
[1:46:07] changed don't take an emotion or
[1:46:09] sensation don't do that stay there until
[1:46:14] something actually
[1:46:18] happen that changes you
[1:46:21] completely remember I talk about
[1:46:23] altering your thinking this is where I
[1:46:25] get it from Moses begin to think on his
[1:46:28] ways how he went off in his own
[1:46:30] schooling and training he know there was
[1:46:33] a call of God on his life but he tried
[1:46:35] to work it out his own way many of us
[1:46:37] preachers get into that trouble a call
[1:46:40] of God in our
[1:46:42] life and then go off and get a schooling
[1:46:46] that tells us the days of Miracles pass
[1:46:48] there's no such thing as the Holy Ghost
[1:46:50] now they say holy ghost sensation
[1:46:53] and whatever they want to bring same
[1:46:55] Baptist style not understanding what the
[1:46:58] prophet presented them what for days
[1:47:00] gone by God let you think on your WS
[1:47:04] that same God wrote the word still lives
[1:47:06] and holds you responsible to it God is
[1:47:09] infinite here we go when he speaks it's
[1:47:11] got to be
[1:47:12] perfect we cannot alter God's word we
[1:47:17] have to alter our thinking to his
[1:47:21] thinking then you will think like he
[1:47:24] thinks let this mind that was in Christ
[1:47:29] be in you Hallelujah Give the Lord some
[1:47:38] Praises there is no need of any man to
[1:47:41] try to take his worldly knowledge and
[1:47:43] ever please God with it the scripture we
[1:47:44] read it says not with man's Wisdom is
[1:47:48] what the Holy Spirit
[1:47:50] teaches do you understand that because
[1:47:52] because these things are spiritually
[1:47:54] discerned it's an abomination in the
[1:47:57] sight of God you will never please God
[1:47:59] with worldly ambition and knowledge
[1:48:01] because it's enmity to God says the
[1:48:03] scripture and each one tries to have all
[1:48:06] the knowledge they just know what to do
[1:48:09] and the words to say it becomes
[1:48:13] listen it becomes a political
[1:48:16] speech instead of the the powerly
[1:48:19] demonstrated Holy Spirit message that
[1:48:22] sing to the heart of men and discover
[1:48:24] the sin they are trained for political
[1:48:29] talks we don't need that so he's talking
[1:48:31] about political ministers they just make
[1:48:34] the gospel into
[1:48:35] politics now Paul said the way the word
[1:48:38] come to us gospel not in word only but
[1:48:41] in power and demonstration of the Holy
[1:48:43] Ghost that brought the gospel
[1:48:45] demonstrating the powers of the Holy
[1:48:47] Ghost and all these men go off to
[1:48:49] seminaries and so on like that right
[1:48:51] around here the Paul said the gospel
[1:48:54] that I preach didn't come like that but
[1:48:57] it come through the renewing of the Holy
[1:48:59] Ghost and the power of demonstration in
[1:49:01] other words it doesn't come by right
[1:49:03] form speech that your wisdom would be or
[1:49:05] you trust in the wisdom of man praise
[1:49:08] God each one try to think he's smarter
[1:49:10] than the other
[1:49:12] one you
[1:49:14] hear each denomination we got the
[1:49:17] smartest men in other words uh we got
[1:49:20] the he have more Mysteries like a
[1:49:22] brother told me he said brother to you
[1:49:24] you know you preaching too light and
[1:49:26] he's praying for me that I could get
[1:49:27] down the de of the W he said pray for me
[1:49:29] brother next brother tell me he's ahead
[1:49:31] of me I said I'm coming on I'm coming as
[1:49:32] fast as I can pray for me pray for me
[1:49:34] I'm coming on see now watch
[1:49:38] watch all
[1:49:40] knowledge we know all about it and some
[1:49:43] of them doesn't know the first alphabet
[1:49:45] of the Holy
[1:49:48] Spirit and this I want to get through it
[1:49:50] reminds me a little book I read one day
[1:49:52] in California about 10 years ago I pick
[1:49:54] it up in an old bookstore I forget who
[1:49:56] the author was a 10 cents book but it
[1:49:58] had some good sense to it though it was
[1:50:01] jokingly and cunningly but I found
[1:50:03] something in there that some like got to
[1:50:04] me one of little story is startled like
[1:50:06] this one morning in a great chicken pen
[1:50:10] there were certain Little Rooster that
[1:50:12] thought he had all the knowledge that
[1:50:14] there was to be known so he flies out on
[1:50:16] the box and beat his little bill against
[1:50:18] the Box four or five times flew threw
[1:50:20] back his head throw like a never the r
[1:50:24] and the others he attracted attention he
[1:50:26] said ladies and gentlemen of this
[1:50:28] chicken pen I would like to speak to you
[1:50:31] all this morning on some great
[1:50:33] educational program we have designed I
[1:50:35] have required a lot of knowledge in my
[1:50:37] studying he pulls his glasses over his
[1:50:39] bill he said I have decided that we
[1:50:40] chickens can better ourselves by more
[1:50:43] knowledge therefore I can tell you where
[1:50:46] we will dig and work in certain pen and
[1:50:48] hole You' find certain vitamins that
[1:50:50] will make us grow better
[1:50:53] pry of feathers I can tell you how we
[1:50:55] can embed ourselves in many different
[1:50:57] ways and little pullets little red Combs
[1:51:00] they cackled and said isn't he a
[1:51:03] darling and they admired him oh he's
[1:51:05] such a brilliant rooster all them
[1:51:07] sisters and reminds me some of these
[1:51:10] Seminary preachers such a brilliant man
[1:51:12] there's no need of us hanging around
[1:51:14] with the rest of the chickens well
[1:51:16] before the little fellow got his speech
[1:51:17] finished there was another little
[1:51:19] chicken that didn't have much bright
[1:51:21] feathers Come Running in the rest of the
[1:51:23] chicken yard he said boys just a minute
[1:51:27] I just heard the latest bulletin on the
[1:51:28] radio chicken went up 4 cents upon P we
[1:51:31] are all going to the slaughter
[1:51:33] tomorrow what good is your knowledge
[1:51:35] going to
[1:51:38] do after that rooster make his big Crow
[1:51:41] chicken G for he said all of
[1:51:45] us how find that's a powerful
[1:51:49] lesson brother all the knowledge that we
[1:51:52] can accumulate what good does it do we
[1:51:54] are Sixt of dirt we are all dying by
[1:51:57] inches and by minutes our knowledge
[1:51:59] means nothing we want to know
[1:52:03] him give the Lord some
[1:52:06] praises and I was reminding something
[1:52:09] about a little Canary which is a bird he
[1:52:11] thought he know all the knowledge and he
[1:52:13] need to know he know all much he could
[1:52:15] tell the rest of the canary about human
[1:52:17] beings so he flies on his cage begins to
[1:52:19] speak about human being how he know all
[1:52:21] about them all of a sudden a profession
[1:52:22] Professor from puru walked up and begin
[1:52:24] to speak some high polish words to him
[1:52:26] little fellow batted his eyes and turned
[1:52:27] his head he had eyes he could see the
[1:52:30] professor he had ear he could hear him
[1:52:32] but of course he didn't know what he was
[1:52:33] talking about because he have a canary
[1:52:37] brain he par
[1:52:39] talking morning morning talking talking
[1:52:42] what repeating power
[1:52:46] brain he hads he could hear him of
[1:52:48] course he didn't know what he talking
[1:52:49] about he's got Canary brain he's just a
[1:52:51] bird brain that's all he got he hasn't
[1:52:53] got a human brain he can't think like
[1:52:55] human
[1:52:57] being get the point Propet bringing here
[1:52:59] now and neither can a human being think
[1:53:01] like
[1:53:05] God you are human and all the worldly
[1:53:09] knowledge is no more than a canary brain
[1:53:12] you all you have to do is hurt yourself
[1:53:14] with it you have got to have the mind of
[1:53:16] Christ
[1:53:22] the reason people go and join
[1:53:23] organization and substitute a handshake
[1:53:25] instead of the new bird they're trying
[1:53:27] to bypass the new bird they don't want
[1:53:30] the new birth they know we teach it in
[1:53:32] the Bible they want to substitute
[1:53:34] something for it so you in the message

[2:11:25] multiply
[2:11:30] sales think about it these people are
[2:11:34] demonized you
[2:11:35] know Hollywood is the seat

[2:12:10] they not getting the Holy Ghost they
[2:12:11] getting
[2:12:14] Spirits so when you come to church you

[2:12:42] spirit of God make you have forgiveness
[2:12:44] have brotherly kindness oh give the Lord
[2:12:46] some praises
[2:12:52] I believe the right mental attitude but
[2:12:55] towards any Divine promise will bring it
[2:12:57] to pass if you can look at it the right
[2:12:59] way so he's talking about a reframing of
[2:13:02] the mind he's talking about looking at
[2:13:04] things differently you look at things
[2:13:07] your way and you see you have
[2:13:09] failed I do have to tell you that look
[2:13:12] at yourself look at around what you have
[2:13:15] produced that is
[2:13:17] failure don't say Amen now show your
[2:13:20] hand them how successful you
[2:13:23] are because God tell Joshua meditate in
[2:13:26] the word day and night and then you
[2:13:29] shall have good success what does that
[2:13:33] mean you don't
[2:13:35] meditate what success you going have you
[2:13:38] will have your thing that you might
[2:13:41] accomplish and you feel good about but
[2:13:43] not the success God want of you because
[2:13:46] God want you to be successful how many
[2:13:48] knows that he said as my father sent me
[2:13:50] so send than you he want you to be a
[2:13:52] success failures don't show
[2:14:03] God failures defeat do show God man
[2:14:08] defeated there boy that's
[2:14:12] God I remember my early Christian
[2:14:14] journey I got um
[2:14:21] the some virus something I had and it
[2:14:23] had my body like SS and different things
[2:14:26] and shingles my shingles and I'm walking
[2:14:29] so and somebody say oh God look at that
[2:14:33] Christian Christian walking I feel
[2:14:38] bad because I walk so pain this you see
[2:14:41] that talking about they seeing but look
[2:14:45] a Christian you
[2:14:47] walking because my testimon is out there
[2:14:50] and when you put put your testimony out
[2:14:51] there where you have to put your
[2:14:52] testimony I do it on my
[2:14:54] job woman in job trying to push move I
[2:14:57] said show show them my ring she she said
[2:14:59] that
[2:15:01] nothing I push my rings
[2:15:04] so you know words back off hands off she
[2:15:07] said that nothing that's the devil
[2:15:09] talking to you if I do have it
[2:15:12] right that's a whole M
[2:15:16] finish I know Lucy when I see him and
[2:15:19] you had to be able to recognize Lucy
[2:15:21] because Lucifer a taking no no prisoners
[2:15:24] you know he come to
[2:15:25] steal to Rob and Destroy so he's a
[2:15:30] bandit Highway
[2:15:33] Bandit fight back we give the Lord some
[2:15:37] Praises fight
[2:15:41] back but BR I believe the right me
[2:15:45] attitude towards in a Divine promise
[2:15:46] he's talking about a set a mindset a
[2:15:48] mind change a mind shift
[2:15:51] asking all these things I remember
[2:15:53] people fighting in a house you with the
[2:15:56] couples in the girl house shoes and
[2:15:58] things going in the bed or his house
[2:16:01] where he come from shoes going in the
[2:16:03] cupboard that get
[2:16:06] married shoes under the bed get married
[2:16:09] to shoes in the
[2:16:10] cupboard you see that problem they going
[2:16:15] on battle over where to put his
[2:16:19] shoes well best bought them say put the
[2:16:22] roof compromise all together but I it
[2:16:26] may sound silly but I had battles with
[2:16:27] all them I had to deal with all kind of
[2:16:29] foolish is like want to say call to deal
[2:16:33] with them it because the husband had
[2:16:36] given her a chance to wash the
[2:16:38] car I said

[2:16:54] Wasing okay all
[2:16:57] right husband mash up Soo much of things
[2:17:00] but if I as a wife and my my husband

[2:17:04] get kisses every
[2:17:07] day I have no complaint he could drive
[2:17:10] the car if he want you understand saying
[2:17:13] that but to show you the foolishness

[2:19:06] anchor down and said let this stay right

[2:19:13] and and and it go on to the next
[2:19:14] generation and and granddaughter ask the
[2:19:16] grandmother Grand why we not talking to

[2:19:28] this church not talking to the other
[2:19:30] church
[2:19:32] again such a
[2:19:34] foolishness God will judge people like
[2:19:36] that you Jesus demonstrated a practical
[2:19:39] gospel you know he came and started tell
[2:19:41] oh come bring me bow let me wash your
[2:19:42] feet said no you're washing my feet big
[2:19:45] Big M Champion said
[2:19:49] Lord the Bas on me Peter want to let go
[2:19:53] Jesus you know all M Champion he want
[2:19:56] let go you know when Jesus finished with
[2:19:58] them he say see what I do you all you
[2:20:00] call me master I do that as your master
[2:20:03] do that to one
[2:20:08] another Paul come back and said Let each
[2:20:11] esteem the other better than themselves
[2:20:14] and you playing and you feel you are
[2:20:18] somebody you are embarrassing to the
[2:20:21] kingdom with that thought that is a high
[2:20:24] thought and we supposed to pull on every
[2:20:26] High thought and bring it into captivity
[2:20:30] oh give the Lord a shout captivity of
[2:20:32] the high thoughts when you could have
[2:20:35] seen your brother better than yourself
[2:20:37] you are pulling down high
[2:20:40] thoughts and you are reframing your man
[2:20:43] like Jesus did who being the form of God
[2:20:47] taught it not robbery to be equal with
[2:20:48] God and he became a silver
[2:20:51] and he humbled himself so when Jesus was
[2:20:53] ah head of the table Jesus come with
[2:20:57] you he come with the plate with the food
[2:21:00] and rested in front of you that's
[2:21:07] Jesus so all of you who don't like to
[2:21:09] serve in trouble because Jesus was a
[2:21:12] servant Hallelujah he said the son of
[2:21:15] man come to what to serve not to be
[2:21:18] served
[2:21:21] so you sitting on your throne waiting to
[2:21:22] be served take St
[2:21:27] him because sometime you to join the
[2:21:29] buffet
[2:21:31] line all right I didn't come here for
[2:21:34] that so watch remember that has been the
[2:21:38] standard in my life I have tried to do
[2:21:41] this the first thing I want to find out
[2:21:44] is whether it's the will of God or not
[2:21:47] then I know it's God's will the next
[2:21:49] thing is my objective it my motive in
[2:21:52] doing it then if it is the will of God
[2:21:54] and my objective is right and my motive
[2:21:57] is right I have faith it will be done
[2:21:59] because first is the will of God and my
[2:22:02] objective is to glorify him my motive is
[2:22:05] to give him all the glory there's no
[2:22:06] selfish motives about it if you have a
[2:22:08] selfish motive it won't work if your
[2:22:10] objective is to make money for yourself
[2:22:12] or something it will never succeed when
[2:22:14] you try to do something outside the will
[2:22:16] of God it won't work to begin with here
[2:22:18] we go this what I want to get to now
[2:22:19] there's a genuine Faith but you must
[2:22:22] come into the real channel of God to
[2:22:24] have that genuine Faith are you ready
[2:22:27] there is human faith and there's the
[2:22:29] faith of
[2:22:32] God and you must have Godly Faith to
[2:22:35] believe and to have Godly Faith you must
[2:22:38] have the mind of Christ prophecy is I'm
[2:22:42] hearing him the mind of Christ is to be
[2:22:45] in the
[2:22:47] church are you with me this prophecy
[2:22:51] the mind of Christ is to be in the
[2:22:54] church and the mind of God was in Christ
[2:22:57] and how the spirit let Christ so ought
[2:23:00] his Spirit lead the church now God meets
[2:23:04] in the circle of men sometimes in great
[2:23:05] numbers one time he met with 500
[2:23:07] Brethren another time he met with 12
[2:23:10] number time he went with three sometimes
[2:23:12] just with one so it doesn't matter how
[2:23:15] great our numbers or how small our
[2:23:17] numbers Christ has left us this word
[2:23:20] that wherever two or three are gathered
[2:23:22] in my name I'll be in the midst now you
[2:23:25] can't have the mind of the world and the
[2:23:28] mind of Christ at the same time one is
[2:23:30] caral and one is spiritual and the caral
[2:23:33] mind could never comprehend the
[2:23:34] spiritual mind so you have to understand
[2:23:37] when people in the flesh and people all
[2:23:38] natural they certainly not seeing what
[2:23:40] they're supposed to see so I will have
[2:23:42] no argument with the flesh pots and
[2:23:44] fleshly people and caral people no
[2:23:46] arguments is either you are willing to
[2:23:48] bow to this or or you just check out
[2:23:51] yourself you understand what I'm saying
[2:23:52] then we not trying to fight up the
[2:23:54] people know no but now when the
[2:23:57] supernatural comes in that's the mind of
[2:24:00] Christ you'll be so far away from your
[2:24:02] own thinking of your own mind now if you
[2:24:04] could solve your problem if you could
[2:24:06] solve your issues you don't need
[2:24:10] Christ if you could solve your problem
[2:24:13] and you could minister to your own
[2:24:14] issues you don't need Christ Christ
[2:24:16] don't need to die all you need to
[2:24:18] understand like all this humanists will
[2:24:19] talk about you know think positive and
[2:24:21] all kind of story whatnot but what we
[2:24:23] talking about now is a transformation by
[2:24:25] God doing something in your heart if you
[2:24:27] stop smoking that is you stop smoking
[2:24:28] but when something happen in you that
[2:24:30] take out desire to smoke that is
[2:24:31] Supernatural do you understand what I'm
[2:24:33] saying you could stop drinking that you
[2:24:35] stop drinking but when something happen
[2:24:37] in your heart that takes the desire out
[2:24:40] then you're
[2:24:41] free glory to God glory to God are you
[2:24:46] with me now so God want you to be free
[2:24:48] let's quick go quickly now PR pra be to
[2:24:50] Jesus brother so you don't use your own
[2:24:54] thinking you don't use your own mind oh
[2:24:57] blessed be the name of the Lord
[2:24:59] hallelujah praise God so brother bam
[2:25:02] said here now watch so you watch the
[2:25:05] mind that was in Christ is in you and
[2:25:07] when the mind of Christ is in you you
[2:25:08] are the word you are God's living word
[2:25:11] representative so when the Bible talk

[2:33:36] training so what's happening they haul
[2:33:38] themselves up in the upper room dry
[2:33:40] seeds seeds the word was laying there
[2:33:43] with life in it all of a sudden there
[2:33:46] came a song from Heaven and the waters

[2:34:24] with it that is what God give the Holy
[2:34:26] Ghost for intellectual will rise always
[2:34:29] have but God has got a minority
[2:34:31] somewhere God have a little church that
[2:34:33] will move right on with the baptism of

[2:34:37] praise God and your testimony today will
[2:34:41] bring judgment against the city our

[2:34:47] life will bring judgment against
[2:34:50] City
[2:34:53] Hallelujah talk about power of prayer
[2:34:55] power of speech power of the Holy life
[2:34:57] is given for isn't that right it's to
[2:34:59] make you quit your smoking quit your
[2:35:01] drinking quit wanting to be a big shot
[2:35:04] it will take that out of you it will
[2:35:06] humble you when you do that that is what
[2:35:08] the Holy Ghost is for it's for Holy life
[2:35:10] it make you quit gossiping quit playing
[2:35:12] cards shooting craps and all these other
[2:35:14] thing around the corner somebody said oh
[2:35:16] God I can't do that I can't do that I
[2:35:18] can't do that you sure can't but the
[2:35:19] holy Spirit come to for that purpose he
[2:35:21] said to take it out of you all the old
[2:35:24] habits things that you're doing the old
[2:35:27] backbiting separating yourself say bless
[2:35:29] God I'm a Methodist I have nothing to do
[2:35:31] with the Holy rulers the holy come to
[2:35:32] take out of you it washes you in the
[2:35:34] blood it irons you out that is what it
[2:35:37] comes to do oh glory to God hallelujah
[2:35:41] so the Holy Ghost come to bring
[2:35:42] discernment that's what the mind of
[2:35:44] Christ does the natural Man 1
[2:35:46] Corinthians 2:14 we read that receive
[2:35:48] not the things of the the spirit of God
[2:35:50] for they are foolishness unto him
[2:35:52] neither can he know them because they
[2:35:54] are spiritually discerned spiritually
[2:35:56] what spiritually what spiritually
[2:35:59] discerned so that mind of Christ is to
[2:36:01] bring on discernment that's discern
[2:36:03] right and wrong discern hypocrite and
[2:36:05] all kind of funny business sometime you
[2:36:07] can't you explain it you just know
[2:36:08] something not clicking something not
[2:36:10] clicking is that right Hallelujah the
[2:36:12] mind of Christ what Jesus had let this
[2:36:15] mind be in you it brings humility he was
[2:36:18] made in the lious a men and being found
[2:36:20] in a fashion as a man he humbl himself
[2:36:23] so this mind brings on humility not
[2:36:25] Pride not arrogance but humility praise
[2:36:28] God the mind of Christ praise God Jesus
[2:36:31] said John 4:34 he said my meat is to do
[2:36:34] the will of him that sent me and to
[2:36:35] finish his work so the mind of Christ is
[2:36:37] connected to the will of God hallelujah
[2:36:40] focus on the father's will and this mind
[2:36:43] also brings God's peace Isaiah 263 said
[2:36:46] thou will keep him in perfect peace
[2:36:48] whose mind is on thee because he trusted
[2:36:51] in thee so this mind of Christ brings
[2:36:53] you peace it brings you Assurance
[2:36:55] Ephesian Philippians 4:7 said and the
[2:36:58] peace of God which pass it all
[2:37:00] understanding shall keep your hearts and
[2:37:02] Minds through Jesus Christ Hallelujah
[2:37:05] the mind of Christ we talk about
[2:37:07] transforming your thinking reframing
[2:37:09] that point of reference in your mind
[2:37:11] what it does it transform how you
[2:37:13] think are you thinking anything saying

[2:40:44] the first time I really bounce this up
[2:40:46] in this way but but says no
[2:40:50] remember we are
[2:40:52] invited think of it to become characters
[2:40:55] like his if we are ready to lay our
[2:40:58] character down and the molding that we
[2:41:01] had H minded lovers of pleasure of God
[2:41:04] he said how can God come into a place
[2:41:06] like that when they deny the word he
[2:41:09] watches over his word to vindicate it to
[2:41:11] make it come to pass we have got to take
[2:41:14] here we go the entire Full Gospel we
[2:41:17] must being that we have identify
[2:41:19] ourselves as the Full Gospel people
[2:41:23] there's the part I got to let's mold our
[2:41:26] character we are invited to be molded in
[2:41:30] His image that we might reflect his
[2:41:33] presence the life that I live so shall
[2:41:36] you we are invited by God to take him as
[2:41:41] an example and let our character be
[2:41:44] molded like his then when we let his
[2:41:47] character be in US
[2:41:49] then we become Sons by having the mind
[2:41:52] of Christ mind and listen to the depth
[2:41:56] now which is his character your mind
[2:42:00] makes your character what you think you
[2:42:05] become as a man think it in his heart so
[2:42:09] is he so I never saw this like way he
[2:42:11] bring it let me read it again by having
[2:42:13] the mind of Christ mind which is his
[2:42:17] character so he's talking about spirit
[2:42:20] because spirit is life mind which is
[2:42:23] character your mind makes your character
[2:42:27] let the Mind Paul said of Christ the
[2:42:29] mind that was in Christ be in you let
[2:42:31] that mind of Christ be in you here we go
[2:42:34] it molds the character of a Son of God

[2:44:22] forgive him and he could forgive them
[2:44:24] and that's why he said I forgive you God
[2:44:27] was looking for that could you imagine
[2:44:29] that and God give him the exam multiple
[2:44:32] choice pick one and it will work pick
[2:44:37] anyone oh my so you have to watch what
[2:44:40] you say so without the minor Christ you
[2:44:44] might see the wrong thing and you get
[2:44:46] the wrong result praise God so this holy
[2:44:49] ghost that is Promised is to drop down
[2:44:51] over our imagination our conscience our
[2:44:54] memory our affection Christ in you the
[2:44:56] hope of glory praise God praise God so
[2:45:00] those seven voices of the seven Church
[2:45:02] ages that was God's mind for every age
[2:45:05] came now to each messenger God's mind
[2:45:09] dropped down upon each messenger and
[2:45:11] released the word for the age so when we
[2:45:13] have seven voices or seven Thunders what
[2:45:17] we actually have is the mind mind of
[2:45:19] Christ that was through the Seven Ages
[2:45:22] is now coming upon a bride Hallelujah
[2:45:26] and that seven Thunders becomes the
[2:45:28] Capstone revelation of Jesus Christ to
[2:45:31] cap off the Pyramid of Our Lives you say
[2:45:33] if that be so then the seven Thunders
[2:45:35] kept the pyramid Hallelujah might beos
[2:45:37] and we think he long say time shall be
[2:45:39] no more what happens could that be so no
[2:45:42] Brethren seriously think if it is the
[2:45:43] pyramid is capped by the seven tunders
[2:45:46] remember the pyramid message it is a
[2:45:47] Capstone what did it do the Holy Spirit
[2:45:50] capped off the individual after they add
[2:45:52] all the thing and The Headstone come to
[2:45:54] cap it off does the Thunders mean that
[2:45:56] my brethren I'm closing there's not one
[2:45:59] Mo for cult to beond the eye is that
[2:46:01] right the next is the intelligence which
[2:46:03] is Christ himself who control the whole
[2:46:07] body my and when he said he said every
[2:46:11] word in the Bible is God's thoughts laid
[2:46:14] in seed form and if it received into the
[2:46:16] human being and spoke by the same
[2:46:18] thought that materialize the Bible it
[2:46:20] brings it to pass as a man think in his
[2:46:23] heart so is he so just as God said let
[2:46:25] there be a world before it could be a
[2:46:27] word it had to be a thought isn't that
[2:46:28] right and the thought become material
[2:46:31] Hallelujah I'm going to skip down what I

[2:46:38] tumor let that tumor leave you let there
