we look away to you Jesus oh God we thank you in advance for what you about to do we thank you Lord for what you are doing and we bless your name and worship you praise God have your way Lord in Jesus I ask it amen you may be seated [Music] what you you here for you to worship you here to give him praise you here to bless his name for the Lord is good his mercy and Joy from generation into generation he is still a Healer he is still a deliverer he is still a baptizer he is still a restorer he is Hebrew st8 the same yesterday today and forever he can free you from your past he can free you from your fears he can deliver you from whatever condition he can make a way for you he is known as a way maker he is known as a provider he is known as a protector he is known as a deliverer oh give him glory give him praise Hallelujah he's wonderful this morning thank you Lord hallelujah amen amen amen thank you misss father m one what a beautiful song that ought to be our desire God didn't make us H than the animals he made us a little lower than the angels we could fall back into animal behavior and bad behavior but God called us to something a little higher I want to strive towards that calling that God plac in our hearts the devil could take some but he cannot take all oh blessed be the name of the Lord so I'm grateful to God to be here to see all of you out this morning we are appreciated for the Lord appreciate to the Lord uh Friday Friday uh Bible study man front part and back part all the animals made and there was no man there was no visible I call that first man the backp man part in the back you can't see but that's the real man that's the subconscious man that's part you can't see see what I'm talk about when somebody say Do you believe you'll be healed and you said yes sometimes that just the conscious man but the subconscious is doubting and questioning so we need to get that back part man lined up with the front man we need to get when you say amen and the front it mean amen behind that'll make a whole difference isn't that something so God couldn't instruct that Spirit man about telling his soil in Genesis 1 but when he form Man Out of the Dust of the earth which is the front part man now he could talk to man that's right and say listen till the soil sir dress it name the animals and so now they could see him and he could see them physical man isn't that right there's a reason why I'm saying those things you know because when we come back to the back of the book you realize the back of the book is only in the book is written but on the back side is sealed with Seven Seals hallelujah hallelujah and the 81 silence is the only mechanism for the back to come to the front and that's under silence so God put silence under the seven seal but there's something on the back of the book called seven Thunders isn't that something else this morning so we in for Revival because God promised it we in for a breakthrough because God promised it we in for signs wonders and miracles because God promised it and God is not a man that would lie if God give a promise he has the ability to fulfill that promise sometime we fail in our promises but God never fail and he will not fail you the devil is a liar this morning I don't care what your dream last last night what thoughts bang your mind last night God is still alive and he is still on the throne oh praise the name of the Lord let me say it again God is still alive and he is still on the throne and he going to prove himself to be the same yesterday today and forever in this generation glory to God he going to prove himself are we going to read it but I'm say when I'm gone healing is not gone he was going but healing wasn't going the mighty Angel is still on the earth the angel of the Lord is on the earth fixing things around that angel is here this morning that angel is around the world glory to God fixing things around for his coming praise God Hallelujah the race is not for the Swift or the battle for the strong but time and chance happen to all men God put you in a position where God could favor you where God could bless you don't complain don't be grumpy praise God be grateful come with a grateful heart this morning he didn't have to wake you up off your bed this morning he didn't have to bless you he didn't have to Quicken you but he did that to help you a long life's journey glory to God Amen Hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord so let's stand this time we want to go to the word and let's let's let's play have faith in God for me have faith in God for the answer have faith in God I I told you on Friday in the Bible study come or I think Wednesday night come with an expectation come to see God fulfill your don't come here without a prayer before you

red SE in front of you don't come space out say God the red SE in front of me and I don't know what to do tell him you don't know what to do my children are troubling me and I don't know what to do

faith in [Music] God God [Music] yes God for the answer one more [Music] time in God my Lord [Music] [Applause] [Music] in God for one more time close your eyes and sing it faith in God hallelujah in God oh in God yes in God for be handsome [Music] happy God bless you if you have your Bibles we like to turn to three portion of scripture Deuteronomy 29 1:29 Colossians 1:1 15-29 and Revelation 8 one verse verse one Deuteronomy 2929 the secret things belong unto the Lord of Our God but those things which are revealed belong unto us and to our children forever purpose that we may do all the words of the Lord hallelujah Colossians chapter 1 reading from verse 15 who speaking about Christ is the image of the invisible God sir the firstborn of every creature sir for by him were all things created that are in heaven that are in Earth visible and invisible whether they be Thrones or dominions or principalities or Powers all things were created by Him and for him and he is before all things and by him all things consist and he is the head of the body not the pope he is the head head of the body the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence for it pleased the father that in him should all fullness dwell and having made peace through the blood of his cross by him to reconcile all things unto himself by him I say whether they be things in Earth or things in heaven and you that will sometime elimated and enemies in your mind by Wicked Works yet now had he reconciled in the body of his flesh true debt to present you holy and unblamable unreprovable in his sight if he continue in the Fate grounded and settled and be not move away from the hope of the Gospel which you have heard and which was preached to every creature which is under Heaven whereof I Paul I made a minister who now rejoice in my sufferings for you and fill up that which is behind of the Affliction of Christ in my flesh for his body's sake which is the church whereof I am made a minister according to dispensation of God which is given to me for you to fulfill the word of God even a mystery which has been hid from ages and from Generations but now is made manifest to his Saints to whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles which is Christ in you the hope of glory whom we preach warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus where unto I also labor striving according to his working which worketh in me mightily our last scripture one verse of vertion 8 verse1 and when he had opened the seventh seal there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour let us pray father God has been acqu a couple of weeks having these things Lord laying here to prepare them for your people and now this hour has come and this is just the beginning and father I pray you take me out of the way and speak to them and feed them the bread of life granted Lord in Jesus name I ask it amen you may be seated praise God so this have been riding me for quite a while now uh and today I be I be uh believe I'm going to present this to you of a title one goal one purpose that's the title one goal one purpose let's go are you ready this morning all right there may be things that God has added to the church which stimulate FEI but now when I am gone healing isn't gone healing ought to be more than it was before we come here that's the purpose is to get the people in their mind in the spirit of the latter days we in the latter day you believe that we are the world is in the spirit of the latter day but the church is not in the latter day spirit yet did you get that we are in the latter day the world is in the spirit of the Latter day but the church is not in the latter day spirit yet that why they going how they say it say it I don't have it we could say l but there no translation for that but slow and sluggish and lazy what was the mic show up TR a new one that's a new one so so watch in other words and and you will see who we put responsible for this in other words we may be in a portion but God wants his church so in the spirit they would just fit in just anywhere God would to lead them to the latter days of the rening world man look at the places eat and drink and Mar and given in marriage all the immorals there is in the world the devil send down his troups in the latterday spirit but we ministers haven't got the church yet in that spirit so he put the rug he put the hug he put the whole hug upon the ministers to get the people in the spirit because the ministers have a choice get the people on them get the people to their group or church or get them in the spirit latter the spirit that they could look for the coming of the Lord not look for the minister look for the coming of the Lord not look for their group look for the coming of the Lord in the spirit isn't that right but talk about the John was in the spirit in the Lord's day isn't that right he said now watch was the spirit of the Lord's day he said the first thing you have to do get in the spirit how are these Revelations going to come over to you to get in the spirit let's pull back now so you see the devil's job to get you out of the spirit whole week he working on you don't say Amen now I telling you like it is whole week he working on you because he wants you to hear it with your ear only but is in the spirit you're hearing with your ear plus your spirit and when you're in the spirit Revelation could break upon you and Revelation is prevailing power all you weaky thing and you can't this and you C that when Revelation hit you Hallelujah something going to strike you that is prevailing power so the devil's job is to get you out the spirit he will use your husband he would use your wife he would use your children he will do a job he will use some friend he will some off key phone call come to you and send you off your rockers that's all that is the devil say Amen somebody all that is the devil trying to shake you out the spirit but when you recognize you was born for this thing God raised you up for this thing and you have the ability to hear from God not as a normal hearing but to hear what the spirit is saying unto the church oh give the Lord I shout in the house you can stop a man when a man in the spirit you can stop a woman when she in the spirit the spirit makes a difference the anointing breaks the Yoke it inspires you the Bible call a refreshing from the Lord oh give the Lord a shout in the house you may be seated so when the blues and the D out and whatnot and all of a sudden the spirit sweep over all the blues gone away when people outside of Blues they had to go and get Vat 19 and get some rum and liquor they get something in the head and then had the old talk with the other boys in the camp that's them out there but when we get in the Blues we get in the spirit all of a sudden everything is all right because God in control God In Charge David said I hear the rustle in the malberry tree that's rust with the spirit when he hear the spirit move you know the move is on oh give the Lord some Praises glory to God you got to feel something hallelujah hallelujah glory to God you have to know you're not just coming to church you're coming into presence oh that's that's two different thing Al together a lot of people going to church this morning but you don't want to go to church you want to come into presence and in presence there is joy in the presence there's Deliverance in your presence the yoke is broken in your presence the prison bars are open up in the presence the captive are set free in the presence of the sick is being healed in the presence of [Applause] [Music] God hallelujah the devil can't hand the [Applause] presence may be seated I keep saying I say till it strike why would the devil bring on the Press when the devil's in the church he on the inside he's the Inside Man as long as as he's raining in the church with people sitting on and staring sitting down with the unbelief the devil on the top of on top of top lip not the bottom one he pop a that already when he said on your top lip your mouth closed your lips sealed say Amen you're not r or you're [Music] dead when your rusty can spray WD40 some might move but when you're

think I'm talking to I ain't talking to the air you know who I talking to give the Lord a shout in the house I have to call no name look at yourself take a mirror and hear the word look at yourself and see if I'm speaking to you I'm talking to somebody here this [Music] [Applause] morning brother thank you Lord you remember the first thing you do when you get in the spirit how are these Revelation going to ever come to you getting the spirit bum how are you going to ever get the Holy Ghost getting the spirit this what the ministers don't understand Holy Ghost not coming on dead dry people they have no Holy Ghost to get no dead group getting the holy ghost in the upper room they were in the spirit they were praising and blessing God continually they wasn't dead waiting for some man to bring some Mysteries to them they were waiting for power from on high not power from below power from on [Applause] high Hallelujah you may be SE said those demons troubling you you need power to deal with that you come here for that you have a promise you shall receive power that is hanging over you nobody could take that promise from you you could do like if it's not there but it's still there because when it come God more he can take it back this power is for the sons he came onto his own his don't receive him not but as many as receive him to them to them to them give me power to

we talking about wine of stimulation of Revelation it's something that brings Joy it's something that want to send you crazy it's so exciting when you see what God is unfolding he's unfolding his mystery his mystery will be Christ in you the hope of [Applause] glory all right let's go all that back drop try to get started Lord help me we need some more preachers man all right but I remember in Kentucky here long ago I had a meeting I come out of the church and there's a old man standing with a lantern in his hand he belonged to a church that don't you don't believe in healing and so forth he said I different with you brother BR I said well I got a right to do that he say you see I will not accept anything unless I see it I've got to see it right plane I said did you ever see God right plane standing before you he didn't believe in visions and things he said no well I said then you are not a Believer sir I could talk to you we see what God promised and hold to that he said he said how you figure that out he said come go home with me and talk tonight I said I can't he said where you live he said you have to go over this mountain here I said how do you get there you don't see a house he said well a part runs over the hill but you don't see the part he said I have a lantern I said the lantern won't show the light right on the house he said but no but the part will lead to the house but the lantern will show light one step at a time and brother Ron says he said we walk in the light that beautiful light one step at a time yes children walk in the light and you will see more unfold so he was showing the man all this talk about you to see it and whatnot you have a lamp and you take it a step at a time to get to where you're going and that's what God does give you a lamp that you could see and as you walk in the light more begin to reveal more begin to unfold if you walk in the light oh give the Lord some Praises stay right with it keep walking with it watch it unfold and reveal itself the word is a seed and in the right kind of ground it will bring forth His Kind let's go then he said this notice ran 10 1-7 all the Mysteries are to be revealed to the bride by the messenger of the laan church not some all shout out all all not some and a man from Trinidad not some and a man from America not some and a man from Europe or South America all would be revealed and this revelation will be placed on books and tapes all oh praise God praise God isn't that right Hallelujah so in that day we seen him come down eat up the little book he put one foot on the land on the sea swore by him the L forever and when he did seven out of their voices and when the seven Turners out their voices John said he was about to write he said don't write it he sealed it and somebody said well them seven sees but a brandom that will be revealed in the last days some great mystery how we get closer to God hear the question no sir it can't be he said what it is it's a revelation on what has been missed back there to bring it's already wrote here it's in here it is to reveal what's already been written because you cannot add one word or take one word from it oh praise the name of the Lord hallelujah hallelujah God's mystery secret secret mystery he had before the world began that was in the back part of God's mind there was something he was trying to achieve he had a motive in doing it in order to let himself be Express first there wasn't even a Moon Star atom molecule or anything before he was he was God he wasn't exactly God at that time because God in is the object of worship so in the form of Elohim self-existing before Moon star and Earth he was there with his thoughts thinking his attributes as the thought huah Gene unexpressed and then when he brought the expression that Elohim became the logos word and that word is what you get in John John 1:1 in the beginning Hallelujah was the word because the begin in the beginning was the birth of time but before the beginning it was Elohim self-existent because he wanted to get to us humans a view of him or revelation of him it has always been about him not about us this message is not about us it's about him it's about Christ being revealed to his church Hallelujah do you get it now all right so watch so when he created the Angels he became God because God is the object of worship so in his great mind he wanted these attributes to be Express in him was love in him was to be a father in him was to be a son in him was to be a savior but there was nobody lost there was no children Express but it was in him hallelujah oh Hallelujah it was locked up in himl as a thought as a gene as a mind as the intelligence he wanted to be a father he wanted to be a savior but there was no lost he can't take humanity and just lost them no he had to have a plan oh give the Lord some Praises hallelujah hallelujah in my opinion the first thing he made was angels and they worship him that made him God he started from De he said what before there was a molecule there was nothing it was Darkness now God had a purpose here we go and a hidden Mystery and that is what I want to speak about the church this morning the hidden Mystery that God had in his mind Hallelujah and this is where I get a taught from one goal and one purpose and I want everything we say around this one goal and one purpose not two goals not six goals one goal and one purpose he had one objective had one motive a purpose behind what he was doing everything is revolved around this one goal and one purpose not two goals one goal and one purpose any Minister preaching have to connect with that one goal and one purpose Hallelujah every mystery reveal has to be connected to that one goal one purpose if there is seven tunders it has to connect to that one goal one purpose if there a bad Revival it has to be connected with one goal one purpose Hallelujah whatever M relation whatever teaching whatever mystery whatever inspiration has to be connected to that one goal and one purpose Give the Lord some Praises not a d move unless we say so give the Lord a shout in the house hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah Hallelujah let's go God's great mystery it's a secret he kept it a secret nobody know nothing about it even the angels didn't understand it he didn't reveal it are you ready that's the reason under our seventh mystery when the seventh seed was open there was silence first seal White Horse then red horse and black horse and Pale Horse and set of symbols but when the seven open silence you're looking you hear nothing you see nothing just silence for the space of half an hour your name was not under the first seal your name was not under the second seal your name was under the third or fourth or fifth or sixth seal your name was under the seven seal that's a seal of life that's God's seal that's a seal of completion that's the Seal of finish that's the seal to birth the manifestation of the sons of God hallelujah that's the seal to bring on the manifestation of the sons of God that seven seal and there was nothing under there oh give the Lord a sh Oh Glory to God hallelujah hallelujah silence don't misinterpret silence you know silence is a powerful thing you know when the sun come up in the morning you Creek the Sun come making no s noise no silence the sun just rise TR his rise just silence the bird the worm form a cocon around itself and after time it just breaks out into a butterfly it breaks a silence a silence is something else don't fool with silence silence have something behind it hallelujah hallelujah you see a tree with a strong trunk and great and great branches but that is not its power you know the part that is powerful is what is below the ground that what you can't see how deep it is how grounded it is hallelujah that's the silent part that's the hidden part that's the main part that's the foundation part oh praise God so that's the reason under our seventh mystery when the seventh seed was open there was silence Jesus when he was in Earth they wanted to know when he was going to come even the son himself don't know when it's going to happen God has this all to himself it's a secret that's the reason there were silence in heaven for the space of half an hour and seven tunders utter their voices so that mean those seven tunders are connected to the coming of the Lord that's right we disconnected it is connected God put silence in it because you don't know when he's coming isn't that right Hallelujah John was forbidden to write it see the coming of the Lord oh praise the name of the Lord do you believe that he showed or reveal it in every type that's in the bibleall here we go he the statement therefore the entire Bible not some of it watch these words the entire Bible is the revelation of God's mystery in Christ the entire Bible hallu is an expression Hallelujah of one goal that God had one purpose he wanted to achieve in the entire Bible one and all the acts of the Believers Hallelujah in the Bible Hallelujah has been in type expressing what God great goal is so the believer's actions and behavior was reflecting what God goal is and now in the last days he has revealed it therefore you can see the great meaning of what is to notice and then try to bring it to the people he said this what God has revealed to me now I want to read a scripture from Luke 24:24 is a familiar scripture this is Jesus withholding himself from his disciples who is walking in in a Gloom depressed mode under his ministry for three and a half years under anointing and power and these guys under depression these guys like they don't believe and Jesus he talking to them what going on why what going on why you so sad and depressed and what going on and they giv testimony so in verse 24 they explain and certain of them we with us went to the Sea fala and found it to be so as the woman had said but they saw him not no they telling Jesus that then he said unto them here this rebuke oh fools and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken ought not Christ have suffered these things and enter into his glory verse 27 and beginning that Moses and all the prophets he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself not the things concerning a man in Trad or some Archbishop or some Pope what he was showing is himself in the scripture himself in Abraham himself in Moses himself in Joshua himself in Joseph he could identify himself in the scripture because the entire Bible is God's revelation of Jesus [Applause] Christ so when he was unlocking or unfolding or expounding this word it was about himself do you get that we want to go on to verse 44 of that same chapter Luke 24:44 he said unto them verse 44 of Luke 24 he said unto them these are the words which I spake unto you while I was yet with you that all things must be fulfilled which were written in the law of Moses and in the prophets and in the Psalms concerning me then open he their understanding that they might understand the scriptures so now the word is open now their understanding is open he was giving them an understanding of himself in the lies of the Believers that is already written you can read about Isaac you could read about Abraham you could read about Moses you could read all that in Scrolls so he now go around to identify it is me here is me here is me here life here look Joseph reflect my Christ and so he could unfold all of that so they understand it was Christ from Genesis straight through not the devil Christ Hallelujah Christ is the mystery of God revealed oh give the Lord some Praises Hallelujah so brother bam says so therefore this word being unfolded to them was the revelation of Jesus Christ and you will see what you are to become as Jesus was a revelation of God you will be a revelation of Jesus Christ oh God give the Lord that that that's enough to make a Pentecostal Shout [Applause] [Music] that conscious like a conscious amen Jesus was the revelation of God you as his wife you will become and display the very revelation of Jesus Christ he's saying here what he saying search the scriptures they testify of me and then you think you have eternal life search the scriptures he said Moses and the law and so forth and the prophets and SSM spoke of him he said the scripture testify of him then he dropped this here he is the principal team of the entire Bible if you read the Bible and don't see Christ in every verse go back and read it again if you can see Christ in every verse of the Bible read it again because you miss something the Bible is Christ he is the word and when you read it in the beginning God created there is Christ from the Amen in Revelation that every word testify about Jesus Christ he's the principal team of the Bible he wasn't in the prophets he was in the Psalms he was in the history of the Bible the Bible is a prophetic book it's a historical book it's a book of love it's a book of songs it's a book of life he was in the prophets he was in the psalm he was in the history he is in the Bible he is that which is to come he was before until after what does that make him Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever oh glory to God I know you know all this already but I believe that Holy Spirit could bring it to you with Revelation bring it to you fresh Oh Glory to God he is the thing he was the prophets he was in them he was in the psalm if that is so then he are you ready should be the Principal team of our talking of our thinking of our singing of our walks not politics not Sports hallelujah amen going down am whatever else you're talking another with that too I do have all somebody not Facebook let me extend this a little bit not Tik Tok not all them little small little foolish Clips on WhatsApp that have you wasting time he should be the Principal team of our talking of our thinking of our singing of our walks he should be the Principal team of our life if he's the principal team of the Bible and the Bible is in us then he should be the Principal team of everything we say or do should be christall he is the head of all things oh my here we go now we find Joseph talking about in type nobody could touch Pharaoh without coming to Joseph no man could come to the father in by the son when Joseph left the throne the trumpet song that every knee bowed Joseph is coming and someday uh when Christ come every knee going to Bow so Joseph life watch without him knowing itall he was living out something that he was not aw of but in living it out it was reflecting Christ we notied that two types Hallelujah David we off the throne I'll skip that all all things typed him just in typed yet the mystery was hid all right them men didn't know what they were doing what about you you them men you think you know what you're doing God put the word in you and something had to live out you see nothing we had to look again because the secret is the word is in the bright this thing have to live out you if if it live out yet it will live out you now it must live out you know

head and say no that can't be she couldn't even walk now she running oh we shall leap and run over walls we shall leap and run over walls come on we are more than conquerors this morning I don't know to finish here I want to get out of here this morning on page seven of the 18 solid Pages there's no sweft and spread gospel oh we not killing time we not killing time because we have nothing to preach we have nothing to say and we just milking the cow and making a long long M we're not doing that we not doing that this morning we have a word for you but the spirit is upon Me Oh Glory to God he has anointed me to bring good Tiding this morning to bring a prophecy to you this morning to bring a word to you from the Lord oh my oh my oh my let me see if I get here to tie up somewhere [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] them men didn't know what they were doing they only knew that they were led by the spirit to do something it was holding it back in the last days for this great Revelation he expresses himself himself in Moses and David in Joseph in Elijah yet it showed Jesus Christ expressed perfectly yet never given his secret in full waiting for it to be made known in the last days as he promised waiting for it to be fully comprehended before he could express it the whole thing now the coming of the Lord is a mystery we don't know when he's coming how he is coming but we know he's coming you see all the mysteries of God was waiting for this last day Hallelujah after he already completed then he reveals and shows what he's done hallelujah so watch this this seven Church Ages was a mystery nobody knew it took a prophet to take a pyramid and put it in the pyramid because he is at the end so now he's looking back and he Paul irenius Mar Columba Luther because that is how God does it you could have to be here at the end and look back and the mystery begin to unfold so because he's at the end he could begin to unfold what took place all along now I can't get into it too much we understand by Revelation that the church ages is really the unfolding of the seed the history of the seed life because when you put a seed into the ground it doesn't come a seed right away is a young shoot it begin to unfold branches tassel it unfolding and at the top it come back to seed so when you plant a corn seed it doesn't get corn right you get a shoot right it begins to unfall that's the church age ISJ the life of the seed begin to unfold First Age second age third age fourth age then it come Luther justification Wesley sanctification Pentecostal looking like seed but they are shock looking like seed and if you put it in the message people in the message looking like seed you could tell people I say so we not making a mistake with what we saying looking like seed but they are shock and the only way you could understand what the shock is when the sun comes the sunlight exposes the shock because the shock does turn dry but the sea does turn golden brown with the same trials same testings same Sun same pressure one drying up and one getting golden brown ah if Satan had this Revelation he never let the son hit you never let the son hit you because that son only hit you you're getting rip because you can't bury a a green seed or preach back to me somebody you can only bury a ripe seed so when you are ripe and what is the evidence of ripeness Brotherly kindness Spirit of forgiveness when you can forgive you are showing that you're mature you're on top of the pyramid you're ready for Holy Spirit oh God I don't know what to preach again I don't know how to say this again brotherly kindness identifies how ripe you are hallah Hall that ministers think preaching a ton of mysteries Iden right there it for how long they could talk and explain and some of them plenty Mysteries but plenty ha plenty history Mysteries but no love but they are man of the hour and that is my pastor Hallelujah like if it's a Italian one hallelujah hallelujah forgiveness right Jesus help us to live it manifest it even before Jesus hit Resurrection Ministry he said father where did he say that on the cross not Jesus drinking wine or or Jesus doing something and father forgive them know what we do no no hallelujah hallelujah in the midst of pain nailed to the cross he said forgive them they're clueless they are not ignorant they don't know what they're [Applause] doing one old Thief say save us and save yourself too another old Thief said look at you you hypocrite you Wicked Man B we theves Hallelujah that way you talk Hallelujah under under pain you know when is shock what is SE that shock anointed say save yourself and save us too all right all right the other say Lord Remember Me Jesus turned and said today never come to a service never read a book never get bapti but today you will be with me and you don't want to shout and that come on [Applause] man give the Lord some praises hallah so before Jesus resurrection Ministry Hallelujah could step forward he had us to express forgiveness the book of Jude Hallelujah is where just before the Book of Revelation thank you Jesus that is why God placed that book that little book Hallelujah and on that book it says and of some compassion have compassion just before the Book of Revelation just before the Mysteries are revealed just before the secret is unfolded he put the book of Jude Hallelujah to say and have some not all some have compassion make a difference between Wicked evil Believers Hallelujah have them know miserable who don't want to change who don't want to adjust the behavior and those who suffering In the Flesh struggling in their flesh make a difference and have some have compassion oh give the Lord a shout and save them who them them who struggling with themselves them who struggling and love the Lord them who struggling and looking for a breakthrough they're struggling but praise God they don't want to be inside of there it's like a sheep falling in the pig side and the money is all of them but they're supposed to be a sheep and the bleeding down the help help we here to help you we here to dick you out we here to get you out you got stay down there in that mud come out the mud come and get cleaned up [Music] [Applause] I'm going to try to wrap up here [Applause] somewhere so after it's completed then he reveals hallelujah what he has done hallelujah then he said this it's just like this comparing the Seven Seals when God used Martin Luther for the coming out of that first CH age now Luther don't have a clue he making a age the Catholic Church killed how much millions of Christians 68 million Christians so they thought everybody dead stone dead that's it they reing and ruling so God had to find a man in the Catholic church so Luther reading his Bible discover the J live by FEI Hallelujah he going up on his knees and it thundered into him he heard the voice of God like a thunder the J shall live by faith and he recognize it not by rules and not by Mary and Joseph and Penance so Luther free himself so God went and find a man in the Catholic church God could find a man behind the enemy line you know God can find a man in the enemy camp you know and bring him out you know God found Luther a Catholic anoint him Inspire him and he came out to J by faith and preach [Music] justification now the Catholic chch control the text and the word and what not the people the Bible Hallelujah only the priest give signal so and something like that bless them and that's all they know not only that they preach in Latin too so they totally clueless you have nowh to get all know take your last C so God anointed Wesley hallu and heu around that time the Germans invite in invented the printing press watch how God has do things to print the word so now I have a man and Ed and now the press to print scripture text and that's how it's spread now Hallelujah with Wesley Hallelujah gospel spreading now after that God raised up the Pentecostals because know they have the word so they un expectation because God want to break the spirit age which is the open door age no messenger no man just open the door for the spirit to come in and God used them to break into the spirit realm because you have to have the spirit a platform for that Elijah to come in Make Way for messiah Oh Glory to God so when William brandham come he came to the Pentecostal he came to his own and his own rejected him they were supposed to go into the Rapture but they were expose a shock they reject the word to bring them a Perfection that's why to this day they still failing and falling and they order 30,000 people and man still falling by this one and that one man still backsliding because they never went to the word because the word is what bring character so all the pentec I have was gifts with anointing no life to this day is still gift with no life but you who came to believe this message of Malachi for you have been invited to get you shaped into the word image you have been invited to get your character to characterize to the image of Jesus Christ it's an invitation you accept it or you reject it you don't have to accept it you could say a nice Church M and love yourself I have a scripture for you men shall be lovers of their ownself you could stay right there in that scripture or you could hate yourself like job I hate myself oh give the Lord a shout and you want to be like Jesus so you ready to show [Applause] off I'm going to close if I come to this way you will kill me Hallelujah and I wouldn't allow that [Music] I can't right now finish yet so pulling you're pulling you're pulling Hallelujah almost wiped out all right so watch this now so watch when God used Martin Luther for the coming out of that first church age when he used John Wesley watch this and he gradually brought them out and was revealing in them that church age revealing where in them so they were living out something that they had no idea so Luther living a life and is living out the word in the realm of the spirit Faith virtue knowledge Temperance another Bible being written Temperance patience godness brotherly kindness on top of that Holy Spirit to cap the Pyramid of Our Lives so we are the only age having a complete revelation of Jesus Christ that identify when that which is perfect is come that was just a text Paul wrote you know but we have a revelation and understanding from partial realization to perfect realization that we going to connect to the cap of the pyramid to bring back the manifestation of the sons of God the devil can't handle that he said 340 days the anointing will be too great on the earth we have to leave here and give a timeout do you understand what's going on here now the devil we had to get we had to leave here you know the Earth wouldn't be able to handle it because we were not call to rain in the heaven the testimony was we shall rain on the earth before we rain on the earth we have to start to rain now you have to rain right now reain over them no praise demon by opening your mouth and giving God praise reain over your feelings if you feel to stay home come to church tell your feelings stay home of you want but I am going to church Give the Lord some Praises R over self re over your own thoughts come on re over your own ideas re over your [Applause] [Music] Earth hallelujah hallelujah before God give you power over others all right you have to power over yourself that's right that's is what Jesus demonstrated when he received the Holy Ghost he was led by the Wilderness into the led by the spirit into the willingness to overcome the Devil with a private Showdown I know say come on Jesus you can make it Jesus [Music] Hallelujah that what some of you want always somebody come on I with you no nobody with me therefore All Fall Down what kind of weaky we have time for that say call you because you're strong because you're weak on the contrary say let the weak say I'm strong so God want a bride to be strengthened to be strong to be strengthened the inner man that you could stand what is yet to come you see how anointing that man is in America as soon as he hit the throne he's start you know he stopping you know there anointing upon him you know he can't help it you know it's roaring out you know and when I think about that I think about the bride we had to hit a spot you know when we hit that spot another Ro hit him you know oh give the Lord a shout glory to God it has to happen you know oh glory to God hallelujah that that prop was a class you know when the anointing come he say you know I waiting on when hit him so Hallelujah he said I take every Spirit not not some of the spirits every spirit that mean the small one tall one the short one I don't know what kind of ones they have many demon tall demon giant demon I don't care if it's cancer tumor female condition every Spirit under my control for the glory of God hallelujah when he say that so every spirit's shaken every Spirit trembling because a Son of God coming forth Oh Glory to God hallelujah hallelujah that happening you [Applause] [Music] [Applause] know when Jesus Jesus cast that Demons of the Legion they say the P we want to go in the pigs because they need they need bodies to manifest their wickedness they need bodies to manifest their behavior and just as the devil need bodies God need bodies to manifest his glory to manifest his power what are you saying God need you God want you make his available to God make us available to the spirit that the spirit can use you for his honor and His glory oh give the Lord some Praises musicans come up [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] please I'm going to close with this hallelujah hallelujah now on page eight the first thing that God wanted to do remember one goal one purpose and I want to TI everything to that one goal and one purpose one goal the first thing
