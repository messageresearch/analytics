let's Worship the [Music] Lord we one [Music] let us pray Heavenly Father we thank you for your presence we thank you for your mercy and your goodness and I pray you're coming in a special way this evening this morning service and honor your word and confirm it with signs wonders and miracles we ask in Jesus name amen you may be seated praise God God bless you it's good to be here and hear the shout of the king in the camp hear the Praises of God people amen amen amen remember the scripture said the song of rejoicing is in the Tabernacle of the righteous open unto me the Gate of righteousness and I shall enter in unto them isn't that right oh praise the name of the Lord this morning we are blessed to be here this morning and uh uh Wednesday was something special brotherly kindness as a key and a sign on on Wednesday we spoke about a key of maturity and a key that Ops a channel to pull down charity and it's so strange how I got this inspiration to speak about uh the weapons of our Warfare is not caral you can't fight the devil with your car your house your money your bank account the cap your clothes your tie no Canal weapons the devil he invent carnality he's once you're going in the carnal realm you defeated already once you go in natural realm because the Bible teaches us we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities and powers and spiritual wickedness so once you see me as the enemy you finish you you finish once you see your brother as the enemy you finish love your brother you might like the spirit that's in your brother or upon your brother but love him anyhow because that's your brother he might have a spirit on him or a spirit on a sister but is the spirit and them have them how they are all crippled up isn't that right so the sign of maturity brotherly kindness Spirit of forgiveness and ask a question why would God show this Prophet who was saved filled with the Holy Ghost about condemning a woman he said I forgive you you condemn her why would he open up to the Prophet this Spirit of Brotherly kindness and he said I saw what he meant this man is saved this man is a Prophet this man is filled with the Holy Ghost and yet God had to teach him the spirit of forgiveness a higher test was coming to him and the test was people coming to church carrying on and God dropped down if you say blind they blind they said death they death whatever you say going to happen to them let me see what you're going to do so I saying not only do you get test before you get power but you get test with power what you will do with the power that God going to release to you and many people don't understand this thing about power that's why you say power satanic men will mess up with power that's why God is reluctant to give man power because they will destroy other men so God have to look to see what Cali of man and Jesus himself demonstrated this forgiveness this power and his two incense I want to put to you this this morning just before we we have a special T I like to share with you this will be a continuation of Wednesday actually this tap will be to brotherly kindness at charity never preached on it before said some things I never said before and this was in Miami had a special Mission up there in a service up there and I preach two messages when finds his brotherly love and his second messages was and brotherly kindness at charity and I want that to come today certain things were said Wednesday night that never said before about the spirit of resentment and and and and Jesus when he was praying the Our Father prayer and he Amplified and if you forgive people their trespasses their Reckless and willful sins leaving them letting them go giving up resentment your heavenly father would also forgive you so part of this Spirit of forgiveness have to do with you giving up letting go the spirit of resentment now too many people want things to happen automatically they want no effort they just want life to work out and there's going to work out it doesn't work that way life have laws life have principles life have God's way of getting things done and God's way of getting things done is that you sit back relax like you having ease in Zion no the Bible said the kingdom is preached and Every Man Press their way into it and you have to understand whether you have a goal a business a target a job whatever you have to press your way into it whether it's a student and you want to achieve subjects you have to press your way if you just read the books and just take it casual you wouldn't get what you expect so you have to actually press your way both in mind and in spirit oh praise God you know I used to say I'm too old for this I'm too old for that I cancel all of that I Chang my mind on that Hallelujah I ain't all for nothing right now we're learning French I want to speak French by the time I go April I want to be able to talk French to them brothers I saw them when I first met them years ago they couldn't even talk English now they talk English just like me why can't I talk friend just like them but I have to be determined I have to believe I could do it I have to believe his old gry head could do better than that or give the Lord a shout in the house so I am not putting anything above me if I have to go back to school I'll go back to school if I have to there's all things are possible to them not believe I'm not going to stay and die and just just fade away and have my brains all rust know I'm going to do something about what God give me God give me a hand to raise a mouth to praise a foot to stamp Hallelujah a place to dance Oh Glory to God hallelujah put joy in my soul I'm a Christian well give the Lord some Praises it's the best thing God could have do for me to save me by his grace he dropped my charges he dismissed my case he free me from my guilt he free me from my sins he free me from my past and I can't be happy you are to be a Madman oh give the Lord a shout in the way call her see that's the way I worship my God I'm not ashamed of the Gospel I'm not ashamed of the son of man I'm not ashamed of his words oh glory to God give the Lord a shout in the [Applause] [Music] house may be seated so I know and I am convinced that without the spirit of forgiveness note my words now not the text of forgiveness not brother a thought have a thought tonight I know nothing about it can't forgive nobody at all just talking just talking we not talking about that resentment is a real thing you know yeah after a while years in marriage resentment come up H wife resent husband husband resent wife want to know what marry after they say I do they want to know what I done that of thing giving up resentment resentment a feeling of angry displeasure at something regarded as wrong insult or injury so you feel hurt and that's your feelings that's your emotions and that's what the devil do occupy so once you're feeling with feeling and emotions I feel so hurt if that woman who Jesus said is not fit to take the children's bread and cast them to dogs if she was going feelings all still V with the devil she Vex the daughter Vex the devil and all everybody Vex she Vex with the devil and but she stood the ground and even the dogs get Crum some of the master table she stood at grounds she wasn't backing down because those striving phes couldn't help her and you have to know that this gospel is the only thing on the earth that could help you not your uncle not your mother not your father not your grandmother not your grandfather is this word go help you because the word is God this word could transform your life this word have power in it and Satan hates it that's why you going to preach it to you the Lord some Praises all right almost done here so watch in a relationship a mixture of anger frustration bitterness that builds up over time resentment resentment is when you hold on to the anger at not being treated as well as you think you deserve you hold on to that instead of letting it go I tell you years ago when I had my juice I make my juice I don't want me touch my juice you know I love my juice you know when I come home from work and I open the fridge and that juice missing and you know people need homes but after a while it doesn't matter who you choose you grow you learn and you know this resentment thing come out so powerful for me because it's almost like if I got an experience with this mage that I preach unto brotherly kindness at charity because I recognize sometimes people offend you people lie on you people act nasty towards you and you could develop a complex the complex is not by the personal the complex is in your mind you forgive them you know but you cannot deal with them you cannot relate to them you cannot connect with them because there is something in your mind well God free me from that so now I could ride for you oh praise the name of the Lord again free because I recognized I had the problem not them other words they hurt me they lie they whatever it is that is not the issue the Forgiveness part is not just the issue because look at brother brandham he was condemning that woman because he was looking through his eyes is this what my child grow up in look at the condition of that woman with other men and car why God why don't you just judges place what in your Purity and you feeling the anointing upon him now God in your righteousness why don't you condemn this place God tap him on his shoulder show him his sins show him the bumper show him his forgiveness show him God put pardon and God told him with a serious voice I forgive you amen and you condemn her amen that's all and he know what he had to do do you know what you have to do this morning I'm not hearing you I am not hearing you I want to hear you Hallelujah because when you get this breakthrough you can go and see enemy you know after that I could have go by Oh Glory to God I can go by anybody now you know and I go in you know I'm going to knock on the door there see me for years but I come hey Hallelujah let them have the problem now let them have the fight now praise God I could love my enemies now I could go the extra mile now I could go beyond where I've gone before oh it's 50 mes a Elbow Room woo Hallelujah Faith have Liberty now because Faith here we go is based on forgiveness oh give the Lord a praise do you get that church Hallelujah now you cannot experience forgiveness by yourself I forgive me and you're by yourself that makes no sense you have to experience forgiveness in a group and that is where the Prophet talk about when the Church finds is Bradly love so in a group where there will be issues challenges different personalities backgrounds and so on like that where you have that honey it look like it won't stick but it will stick I'm going to sign off right there so therefore you could come out your resentment and forgive for Christ's sake oh blessed be the name of the Lord and I got a little testimony here I like to read there but over it I want to thank uh want I didn't want to even to to express my gratitude for your prayer for the situation of our loved one some Kell out we spoke to her your video last night and found and and she was in a virtual pray meeting and so on and the positive spirit and attitud she projected give her strength on another note earlier just after supper his wife zida excitedly showed me a scripture that was inspired to her in prayer during the day it was the weapon of our Warfare and not caral so this one BW my mind late as we waited for our prayer meeting to start she she expressed to me I saw today that we need to look at the invisible not the things that we see with our eyes nless to say she was very moved when you started with the same scripture and began to express some of the same things she expressed to me earlier today she wanted to hear the last night's exaltation again so we did so tonight just as about an hour ago and we have been greatly strengthened and grateful for all those words spoken weapons of warfare are not carnal there's a devil we have to fight the Bible call it Warfare Warfare is not one bullet boom and War over that's not Warfare no no no Warfare is a constant kind of thing you're ducking you're thinging but you have to fight and that's why I had to put on the whole armor of God that's why you have to get in the spirit and get out your stinking flesh get out the Envy the jealousy the malice all that things you have to give up Paul wasn't exalting unbelievers he was exalting church folks about what to do let go bitterness and let go anger let him that steal they stealing Believers now letting him not steal steal no more who he's talking to he's not talking about old Thief outside he's talking about Thief inside the church let him not steal steal no more oh get the Lord some don't say Amen now it's still the word I'm preaching don't you're looking at me like if you don't know who I'm talking about I ain't call nobody no Thief inside of here you know but Paul was addressing people in the church because they want to get the life line up straighten up and that's what we want inside of here your life must line up and straighten up you must want God you must want truth you must want righteousness you must want the order of spirit oh give the Lord some Praises so this morning we want to go straight into that tape and brotherly kindness at charity and I TR be a blessing to you it was a blessing to me and it certainly give me a breakthrough so God bless you praise the Lord brother t with us this [Music] morning could you sing that song again what you just was sing song yeah what you just no no the one before that [Music]

Hallelujah hosana hosana hosana blessed be the name of the Lord oh praise God God bless you it's good to be here greetings from The Headstone Tabernacle Trinidad and my wife sister is here this morning we are glad to be here so if you have your Bibles i' like you to turn to First Corinthians chapter 13 we want to read from verse 1 to 10 and second Peter chapter 1 from verse 4 to7 reading from 1 Corinthians Chapter 13 Verse one though I speak with the tongues of men and angels and have no charity I am become a sound in brass and a tinkling symbol though I have the gift of Prophecy understand all Mysteries all knowledge do I have all Fai so I could remove mountains and have no charity I am nothing do I bestow all my good Stuffy the poor do I give my body to be burned as not charity profited me nothing charity suffer it long and is kind charity envieth not charity vaed not itself is not puffed up do not behave itself unseemly seek it not our own is not easily provoked think no evil rejoice it not in iniquity but rejoice it in the truth beareth all things believeth all things hope at all things endure at all things charity never feel it but whether there be prophecies it shall fail whether there be tongues they shall cease whether there be knowledge it shall vanish away for we know in part and we prophesy in part but when that which is perfect is come then that which is in part shall be done away second Peter reading from verse four whereby whereby or whereby are given unto us exceeding great promises precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature having escape the corruption that is in the world true lust and besides this giving all diligence at to your faith virtue and to Virtue knowledge the knowledge Temperance the temperance patience and the patience godliness and the godliness brotherly kindness and the brotherly kindness charity let's bow ahead Heavenly Father we thank you for your love here this morning and for this opportunity to speak to your elect lady father God may you take me out of the way and minister to the Saints this morning in Jesus name I ask it amen you may be seated oh praise the name of the Lord hallelujah amen it's good to be here it's a blessing to be here to serve so on on Thursday night spoke on a message when the church finds it brotherly love and it's a prophecy and brother did prophesy that that coin will be missing and we see that today we see the bitterness the hatred the disunity the Discord in this message actually I'm going to read it but the prophet said there' be no love left but among the elect so somehow Lucifer Satan has invaded this message to break brotherly love to break unity and the prophet said we have to get into the unity of the spirit while we are waiting for the unity of the faith did you get that we have to get the unity of the spirit the unity of the spirit have nothing to do with Doctrine it has nothing to do with belief it has to do with the spirit that is in the man what type of spirit amen amen amen amen and the prophet and be speaking about the spirit of Brotherly Love this issue is not a new issue this issue Jesus had to deal with it the disciple came and asked Jesus how much time must I forgive my brother should I give him seven times a day that was a issue and Jesus answered that not seven times a day but 70 times seven These Guys these men didn't have the Holy Ghost yet they didn't have the love yet they didn't have the charity yet that was a promise behold I send the promise of my father upon you now understand this the choosen wasn't those disciples choosing Jesus make the choos he got a tax collector nobody loves the tax collector but Jesus chose oh Hallelujah Jesus chose the fisherman and Jes and Jesus chose you whoever you are so when the tax collector is in front the service and Jesus said turn around and greet your brother do you see what happening there now when Peter go to put his hand like that you pull back your hand because you have nothing to do with that you don't want but Jesus call him he call you as you are whe he was a drunker whether it was a drunkard an adulterer a fornicator a liar whatever condition you are in God call you as you are God love you as you are and you have to sit down with Breen who are not like you they don't see what you see they don't feel what you feel they didn't go through what you went through but God called all of you and told you to love one another amen and Jesus he demonstrated this when he went and washed the feet when he washed the feet he said I your master could do this to you I want you to do this to one another because there's a key in brotherly love there's a key in forgiveness when you don't forgive you are connected to the person that you have the ought against you will be like Spiderman one web here one web there you here you have a here when you drop yours you cut the web you have to do it do you know why faith for your healing faith for your deliverance faith for the Holy Ghost is based on forgiveness if you do not forgive your father will not forgive you you have to for forgive your husband forgive your wife forgive your children forgive the pastor forgive the Deacon forgive the Elder forgive the sister Church forgive another Minister you got to forgive and that forgiveness bring an atmosphere over you that this morning glory to God you can addly kindness charity could act to brotherly kindness and that's the title of the message this morning I want to continue from Tuesday night and to brotherly kindness charity which is love oh praise God this thing is real you know this forgiveness is real you know hallelujah amen this is real you know you remember the son that Rascal that Troublemaker he asked the father for the money went to a far country spent all the money had a lot of pizza friends and KFC friends friends and his money ran out and he end up with big food and then he told himself I will arise go to my father father I've sinned I want to get back home the Bible said he came to himself amen and if you're drunk inside of here not literally drunk but drunk in your mind you have to come to yourself you don't have to live like that he made us not higher praise God not higher than the [Music] animals he made us Lord and the angels come on you could climb higher you could go further but when that prodal son was coming back home his father always looking out for [Music] him you know how you recognize your children how walk saw a shadow come in there he said him I was looking for him this morning I was looking for her this morning I was expecting her in service this morning I was expecting him in service this morning there he is hallelujah he said kill the fatted get some music get some food my son is coming back and when you come back the whole Heaven begins to Rejoice Oh Glory to God glory to God Rejoice Rejoice Rejoice give God Praises you're coming back but guess what his older brother he was in the field working hard and when he came back heard music and somebody say brother come back he say which one the one who take all the money the one who brought shame to the family the one who embarrass us that man come back they say yeah and your father killed a fatted cal he said no not a fed I bringing food for that car for all the time and they kill it for that brother listen to this watch attitudes watch behaviors he's a Christian a long time he never shamed his father never shamed the for mother he always in church but his back brother came back and he have a issue he said I'm not coming into the house he has an issue that his lost brother is come back you can't have that something was wrong in that older brother heart we could see sins of the flesh but what we are blind to the sins of the heart that what's in that man's heart unforgiveness anger he getting a fight that's his brother who was once lost who was once D how come he shouting his service how come he praising God and last week he was doing this and last month he was doing that but this my son was lost but now he is found friends amen Oh Glory to God all right okay all right let's go hallelujah amen there are seven steps that goes to God for the seven spirits as it come down not 20 steps not 50 steps just seven steps and Peter identified those steps Faith to brotherly kindness are seven steps then the Holy Spirit could come down on brotherly kindness so brotherly kindness is the is that outlet that could access the spirit of God so God put brotherly kindness as our virtue that must be displayed he called that the blood Jude in the book of Jude we read that Thursday night he said and of some have compassion making a difference between bad spirit and BR Beast people and struggling weak [Music] SCS it is tremendous that God choose to put that book of Jude just before the Book of Revelation just before the Book of Revelation is this book of Jude that speaks about the Faith Delivered and speak about an some of compassion in other words brotherly kindness that Spirit give you access to that Revelation that book of re that's the true Spirit now we talk about truth truth is a person truth is more than information Jesus used the terminology the spirit of truth because when the devil was speaking to Jesus quoting the scripture qu wasn't coming from the spirit of Truth the devil was telling Jesus if thou be the Son of God jump down because the word say he shall give his angels charge over thee when the devil is speaking that's not the spirit of Truth he is quoting information and he is quoting knowledge so there is the truth and there's the spirit of Truth there is brotherly kindness and there's the spirit of Brotherly kindness or the spirit of forgiveness and when we get in the spirit of forgiveness you put yourself in your brother place on the matter in other words you put on his shoes to experience why he is walking this way because there was something in his shoes that you don't know so you can't just look and judge you can't just look and condemn you put yourself in your sister's place in your brother's place and then you can effectively pray for your brother or for your sister oh give the Lord some Praises amen listen it doesn't matter what they do to you amen God is Not testing [Music] them God is testing you amen amen amen [Applause] amen can you let it go amen I am still learning I am still growing amen I am learning and I am still growing amen amen because there are people that have done things and said things and said lies about me I don't hold against them but somehow it gets a block this person said that about me now that doesn't stop me from praying for them because that's a way of keeping Spirits off you cannot pray from some for somebody that you cannot love amen you cannot amen amen amen when brother went to India there's a man that was blind from worshiping the Sun and he had no shoes and the first thing B did was to take off his shoes to see if the man could fit his because here in his heart he says wanting to be blind but he has no shoes in other words the comp open up in him to be effective to that man do you understand what I'm saying one time a woman she was waiting to to come up in the prayer line she had a baby that was sick the sister next to her asked if she could pray for the baby and the woman said fine and the sister next to her prayed for the the child and when the woman I think when the woman came up but says the child is healed he said God saw that woman had more compassion and God put it another woman's heart to pray for the child this is real this is not just words it has to live in us this has to become part of us this word must become flesh this word is not talking talking talking it's not sharing sharing sharing this word has to become alive in you and I could we give the Lord a praise amen Amen brother Bram seven CH ages seven steps God building his church is like one person into an [Music] individual and when you surrender your complete being then the Holy Spirit just pours into you through you in these virtues then you are a living Tabernacle then the people would say that's a man full of virtue knowledge Temperance full of the love of the Holy Ghost then they can say that's a Christian that's a real Christian you never seen a Kinder sweeter goder person you are sealed now listen to this when a man a woman possesses this what he's talking about these seven steps then the Capstone comes down and seals them into the kingdom of God then you are sealed with the Seal of love and Paul call love the bond of [Music] perfectness praise the name of the Lord seven steps but said in the Feast of the trumpets watch go into the prophet's chamber and watch them seven steps where did the god meet the challenge to bring the com into the presence of the king where where does they bring where do you have to stand to get into the presence of the King on the seventh step there are seven steps what's the seventh step brotherly love so in other words like Queen Esther you know the story she couldn't go in until the king call her she knew she not supposed to go in but she said herself if I perish I perish I'm going in but she was dressed right she was looking right Hallelujah so when she's accepting the the k when Esther get on that seventh step and there's a Esther here today the bride she is Queen Esther and you're going to get on that seventh step and the King said what I'm what you want me to do for you I I hand him the scepter put the anointing upon you because you are now on that seventh step isn't that something go praise the name of the Lord L he talking about this spirit is seven steps going to the king's chamber watch on the seventh step what takes out to take the uncomon to introduce the king and listen to this key here watch those who station that is standing there and you will see the day you are living in the pyramid so he's prophesying that one day you going to realize you are actually living in the pyramid what step are we supposed to be on the step of Brotherly kindness what is the battle in this message the pastors are saying the Lord delay is coming they're not preaching that you know but when you say that you could fight one another you could battle with one another because Jesus he's not coming now let's fight let's battle but God the a true Minister would say the Lord has descended with a shout amen amen so I'm talking about why wasn't the Caps put on The Headstone because it was rejected prophecy but it will be capped so this Capstone is ordained to come upon this bride do you understand this Stone was rejected this L stone this love Stone praise the name of the Lord praise God hallelujah give him some Praises amen amen amen amen glory to God Hallelujah soam says we God sent us a Seven Seals and send seven angels down from heaven to bring back the scattered word what to tie back into the word to bring down the holy spirit so the objective of the Seven Seals is to bring down the Holy Ghost we as men can't do anything God have to come down we are preaching a message sent from God brother bam he will send us a true prophet of the true word with a message to the return of the original faith of the fathers to bring down the power of the Holy Ghost do you see it now our objective of coming to church is to get to the Holy Ghost Land church is only the means of reconciling Hearts to God you not staying here permanently this is a temporary temporary holding day till we all come into the unity of the faith into of the Son of God into a perfect man Oh Praise Him of the Lord Brother BR I'm getting somewhere just bear with me a little bit I'm using a background he say in the time is this the mystery of the Thunders that will bring back The Headstone you know that you know the pyramid was never capped it may be the time for the rainbow to sweep across the skies praise God is that really them seven Thunders fixing to UT out something that the little group the ga together will receive Rapture in faith now hear this you remember the Prem message what did it do oh no I'm back up a little bit time shall be no more he announces that time is over what happens if that be so seriously think if it is then the pyramid is capped by the seventh ters I didn't see it the prophet said it the pyramid is capped by the seven tenders so he's identifying the seven tenders as the Capstone of Jesus Christ and this Capstone have to be in mechanics mechanics and Dynamics Oh Glory to God mechanics and dynamic question will the foolish version be saved no whatever happens happens now she will have to go through the tribulation period And the reason of it is because he has rejected the in its fullness now this is important listen carefully she is a Believer he's talking about foolish version now a professed believer they have to go through the [Music] tribulation why they didn't accept the atonement in its fullness in other words they take the message buffet style like a like if you're in a buffet line you take what you want and you leave back what you want so you think it's a buffet I taking this I'm taking that I am not taking that in other words I comeing to church but I'm not going to forgive my

will take perfect love to put you in that place for that's all that they want you heard that he's not suggesting that say the Lord it will take perfect love to put you in that place no matter how much religious this religious demonstration how many Good Deeds you have done whatever you have done won't count for nothing on that day so you're doing stuff do I give my body to be burned do I give all

God hallelujah amen they can't stop you they cannot stop you when you're walking in love love is like a force feel around you the devil can't touch you he can only watch you but he can't touch you because charity never fail Oh Glory to God glory to God that loveam are you ready my whole makeup is Grace a lot of people say you scratch my back I scratch yours do something for me I do something that is not Grace amen amen that is not Grace Grace is if your back is itching I will scratch it anyhow whether you scratch M or not Oh Glory to God grace is not if you scratch my back you do what you have to do you live how you have to live you act how you have to act we are here to love we are here to forgive we are here to restore we are here to act like God like God GL to God Jesus Jesus Is God Amen look look look at J Behavior with a woman caught in adultery a picture on Facebook everybody talking about her and and the the the religious world of that day have on display Moses say they have quotes Prophet mes she is to be St she is caught in the very act and Jesus he said amen amen amen amen amen amen amen hallelujah but before just before your stone get you have your Stones I know but before your stone her which one of you without sin cast the first am but the part I want to get is not that part the part I want to Jesus didn't shame them he turned his back and he begin to write giving them the opportunity to search their own house and leave so somebody say I have to go to the market I to pick up my daughter oh you had to pay the bill I'm leaving and in the meantime Jesus he's just writing maybe he is writing Faith virtue knowledge Temperance patience maybe when reach brotherly kindness turn around the woman she didn't move she's asham she's embarrassed she don't even know all those hypocritical guys WR Jesus called Court in order Court in order woman where are [Music] accusers my [Music] Lord and that Jesus not another Jesus that Jesus neither do I condemn go and S no more you are free you are free from your past you are free from your fears you are free from your accusers you are free from all of those hypocrit oh give the Lord some Praises how many feel free ins this morning how many are free here this morning to God Son amen who the son of man set free indeed amen amen amen amen glory to God all right watch this oh I read here now Ezekiel 36 said a new heart I will give you a new spirit I'll put within you then I'll put my spirit within you now brother he say he gives you new heart why the heart we born with is against God so that's why he draws you and give you a new something to then the reason to give you a new spirit is to get along with the Holy Ghost listen to this many times you get the new spirit think you got the holy spirit so first God give a new heart I want to serve the Lord you know like this year for me I think February 15th is 50 years since I give my life to Jesus Christ I was 17 years old when I give my heart to the Lord and when I came back home after getting baptized and I told my cousin I've been baptized in Jesus name he tell me give me six months in that religion and words came up my mouth I say you don't hold time and you give me six months but now it's 50 years and I'm still pumping Hallelujah 50 years Hallelujah am and the devil can't stop what God have started and the work what have started in you he is able to complete it don't give up on God don't give up on God hallelujah give praise that new spirit God had to give you a new spirit to get along with his spirit because some people are so mean they can't even get along with themselves much less when God come some people are so terrible the sister can't stand them the brother miserable so God have to change that and give you a new spirit that could work with the Holy Ghost so therefore the brotherly kindness Spirit has been released that we could work with the love of God because the Bible say how you could claim to love God and hat your brother do you see it now you can't say I love Jesus and you're just singing oh I love Jesus but you're vexed you're angry brother you don't want [Music] see you see you see your brother Tre because you have issues with that so the spirit ofly kindness was released to to work with the love of God the bride Church must come to the honey of Brotherly Love now this is not but coach I'm sharing some thoughts that I have here the Church must come into the spirit of forgiveness God has to see brotherly love how can we really approach the love of God because some point in time we have to be able to approach the love of God just like Esther had was approaching so the pyramid is Brad at the bottom but as it goes to the top it get narrow and people fall fall off now when a word comes if you turn down that word you cut off God in other words if forgiveness comes now God wants you to forgive God want you to drop your o if you if you have issues with people in the church if you have issues brothers and sisters in the church after the service is over go to them and make it right even if they are wrong you forgive them amen amen amen so the P the pyramid gets narrow on the top on the top is where you have brotherly kindness and faith that is based upon forgiveness because it will take Faith to catch the [Music] headstone the Capstone of Love do you get that now William Bram came to turn our hearts back to the Fai of the father what for to catch love will take Faith to pull down the love of God praise the god amen hallelujah hallelujah no brother Bram he interpreted this scripture here this way when that which is perfect is come that which is in part is done with and today by God's help the perfect interpretation of the word Divine Vindication he said we have that which is perfect is come the perfect interpretation of the word with Divine Vindication then that which is in part is done away with you ever hear the statement in the time of ignorance God [Music] wink I know in part I prophesy in part [Music] so when things are in part the whole is not required because the whole has not been revealed or unfolded but when that which is perfect is com you can't talk about part no more and that's what Jesus did the Scribe and Pharisees they had the documents with Moses and the qu [Music] and but the documents and the quotes and the prophecies was prophesied of the Messiah so when Jesus steep on the scene the light is now here and these guys who didn't walk in the light they walk straight in the darkness because the Fulfillment was just before the very eye are you with me so when says when that which is perfect is come and we have it the the perfect interpretation of the word with Divine Vindication men ministers take this and interpret this it to mean we have Mysteries we have plenty Revelations plenty things to preach and unfold but is the a little more than that it's not just this I'm going show you why but had an experience we talk about it a little bit I want to read part of it for you this morning with this bull you know he came out his vehicle he was passing through a field to pray for someone and this big bull stepped up he said I looked at the fence it was too far to run so he's human see the B he remember it's a killer look at the then he remember he forget the gun in the car and as a human being he said he was going to shoot the B and pay for it watch this now and here he come something happened so this not a text perfect [Music] Vindication he didn't talk Mysteries to the B he spoke I call it bull language the language of love but listen to what happen when he's looking around to run or get a Gun there's nothing there something happened I wish that it would happen all the time so he's not talking about a text or thought he talking about an experience and as the B was standing there 20 yards from me great long horns instead of hating that bull I loved him I wish I could explain it but let me tell you something brother you will never come in contact with a greater force in this life than love I do not try to conquer Demons by kicking them I I love God love is what God is God is love love is what conquers and when this big fellow started toward watchs me I know it would be de in a few moments something happened there was something happened to me and I love them I thought poor fellow he was asleep I'm on his ground I ought to be here and I said look fellow you are God's creative being I am God's servant I'm on my road to pray for one of God's servant over there I'm in the service of my Lord I'm sorry I disturb you now you go back in the name of the Lord Jesus and lay down and I won't bother you and he kept coming as hard as could the start I was no more afraid of that bull than I would be of my dear brother sitting by me with a Bible in his La so the bull he in his bull mode he in his his channel kill love came over the prophet no fear because perfect love cast it out all fear you are scared you scared people today are afraid what are you afraid of not even debt don't scare a Christian the very thoughts of people is scared oh brother Bram the doctor told me I just can't get well what are you scared of there's an atonement Lane for you well brother Bram I've done so much sins what are you scared scared of there's an atonement with for you there is someone who loves you don't be scared the words of Jesus scar not listen what he said now get that atmosphere around you atmosphere get the atmosphere listen to these words now now he's a Methodist he's a one he's a trinitarian say he's a sixce he's press play he say he's this he said get that out of your mind I love him he is my brother so these thoughts I have nothing with he he was a minister know he quick to say who is shock he's quick to say who is a [Music] shock this brother is a shock this brother this brother come make it and I would just laugh at these things because they don't have a heaven and they don't have a hell they didn't put your name in the book and they can't take it off all they have is talk they cut this one off they say he is finished his church is dead amen I'm fire in the church the the power of God is in the church but they cut you off in their minds you can't do that that is the brother there that's a sister are you going to keep the atmosphere around you of love but says she's a Catholic she's a Protestant get it out of your mind you will never standing do it out in the outer Court you got to come into the Christ to live in this pres this is the key part here the Bible says he that overcome it there is where the church is faing overcoming overcoming temp overcoming overcoming hatred listen many people tonight who shout and speak in Tong and run up the and hit their neighbor do you see it though you said when they get the Holy Ghost is like a little button a light coming to you like a little button and as you get rid of stuff as you overcome that light expands so the more you die out it expands so you are holding God you're hold like a seed then and that is where God want us to overcome that's why you have to add and go up the steps to grow in God or to get closer to God you say I'm eating Mana glory to God you come in when the man is fresh all the time whether your neighbor treats you right or not you would love him anyhow whether he agrees with you or not you would love him anyhow that is the consecrated life I don't want to hurt your feelings but I've got to stand with you on judgment someday I'm responsible for telling the truth many will come to me in that day and say Lord have I done this in my name in your name he will say depart from me notice this bull rushed towards me and he run until 5et of me no I don't know about you but if I see that b I don't think I'm standing to wait to see I will be running as fast as I could using [Music] bolt to catch me I'll be fleeing but this prophet he stood there with love five fees right there the bull press breaks Screech right there turn around and you know what that was that's a demonstration of what Adam had before the fall Hallelujah am make man and let him have dominion over everything on the earth nothing things have dominion over you you have dominion over oh praise the name of the Lord glory to God Amen so brother he prophesied he said the words of God being materialized brought To Us by the ministry of the spirit so he prophesied not only will we have the ministry of the word but we will have the ministry of the I don't know if you know this but he prophesy that the church will be rebuilt and he did that on the message of Grace he said in other words he said he shall bring forth the Cornerstone he said he say he shall bring forth The Headstone if he would think that the seventh messenger was to restore the faith of the children back to the fathers in other words words rebuild the church again under the power of the spirit now the Pentecostals when the spirit fell on them they speak in tones and only produce gifts men fell in adultery up to now their life not right after now they getting problems with their life they have 30,000 member Church 20,000 member Church church it's not the numbers it's not the money it's the life now the Pentecostal rejected this message because this message was to bring the life in the Pentecostal age God used men in this time God want to use the word in men so when the prophet brought the word which is the Bible which is the pyramid and that pyramid was to get to you and I so God is trusting himself in his sons in the last days because the secret is the word is in the bride so this word coming to you and I service after service message after message the word is coming to you what word by these promises by these promises we become partakers of his divine nature oh praise the name of the Lord so the prophecy is that God would rebuild the church and from Jehovah Gyra 1962 he said I will restore in the last days it shall be restored prophecy God shall send the Holy Ghost in such a way upon planted word that it will restore so in other words since the prophet left we have had the ministry of the word but we are promised the ministry of the spirit that's the promise of Dynamics power coming into the church now the purpose of the fivefold ministry in the Statue of perfect man he was said Build Me Lord into this let Christ be my head working on my Foundation let virtue knowledge Temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness work in me oh lord is my prayer live or die s sink or drown live or die sink or drown friend or no friend let Christ virtue his knowledge flow out that I'm able to teach those and this is the part I want again for God has set into the church apostles prophets teachers pastors evangelist for the perfecting and bringing all these virtues into it and we cannot give what we don't have so this is not virtue by Revelation this is virtue by experience so when Peter went to the house of cornelus and begin to speak the word the Holy Ghost the D the power the presence fell on Cornelius house because Peter had the germ inside of him Peter was speaking life Peter was speaking the word and the spirit was there to confirm and to vindicate the word oration he said these virtues has to be inar before the Capstone ever come into it until these things are scripturally proven and sealed into you the Holy Spirit sees you as an individual so first what do you have you have mental Faith right when you come and hear the word I believe and then he said the Holy Spirit comes down upon that mental fate and give you spiritual faith and that spiritual Faith only recognizes the word if God put a donkey to preach behind here you will not look at the donkey you will hear the word coming from that donkey that spiritual faith in you only recognize the word from your faith after the Holy Spirit seals you in Christ then you become one I'm almost done I'm going to finish then you become one and then you are sealed unit of the Lord God and then they are Vindicated and placed when that time comes they become Vindicated sons and Vindicated daughters do you believe that this morning do you see that this morning hallelujah amen remember time was given to fulfill purpose don't waste your time hallelujah amen the Bible said a time to born a time to die in between that time you are here on Earth to fulfill your purpose and by Revelation our purpose on Earth is to come into the statue of a perfect man there be a perfect Pride on the earth there'll be a perfect man walking on the earth Hallelujah give your time to fulfill the purpose that God raised you up for you waste your hours you waste your days you waste your days waste your weeks you waste your weeks waste your months you waste your month you waste your years stop wasting time time was given to fulfill purpose oh give the Lord some Praises hallelujah hallelujah the scripture we read from First Corinthians 13 as I close as I wrap up here now hallelujah amen this scripture we read Paul made a contrast of this love of Charity I speak with the tongues of men and angels Paul was saying number one Tong of men two tongues of angels three gift of Prophecy four to understand all Mysteries five to understand all knowledge six to have all Faith seven to give to the poor eight to give my body to be burn all these things and nothing the prophet me nothing do I make the sacrifice burn me nothing waste of time do I preach vials seven T new name seven seal Mysteries six hour Sermon Four Hour sermon Revelation sermon no all knowledge all Mysteries waste of time nothing nothing Hallelujah and all of a sudden he begin to speak about this thing called love the characteristics or the ingredients of this ter called love a spectrum a range that love covers now this charity we talking about is not charitable acts they have these people have pans and they looking get money inside that not that [Music] notth for people we not talking about that Paul said charity suffer it long and his kind and I want to pick up nine things nine ingredients of This Thing Called Love and this love is not for the other side it is to be not this love is not to be practiced in heaven this love is to be expressed here on Earth these virtues or qualities relates to man and relates to life there's a quote I found it is attributed to somebody called Ean theet or I don't know how to pronounce and the quote is this the quote is this I shall pass through this world but once any good therefore I can do or any kindness that I can show to any human being let me do it now let me not defer nor neglect it for I shall not pass this way again it's only once we are passing through this world it's only once if you have to do good do it now if you have to live right live right now if you have to love love now if you have to forgive forgive now because you shall not pass this way again give the Lord some prais Give the Lord a Hallelujah glory to God so let's go the first ingredient of this love charity suffered long patience love is enduring and long suffering love waiting to begin Le waiting calmly Le not rushing it maintains a steady Spirit even in difficult situation suffering long bearing all things this is love passive patience love waiting waiting on God Waiting for God charity suffer it long the next one is kindness charity suff and is kind that's number two love is active in doing good making others happy it reflects Christ example to bring joy to others never acting rashly or pridefully but being gentle and considerate in all things kindness love in action so we have love pastor we have Love In Action charity envieth not this one generosity generosity charity EnV not this is love in competition with others are you listening whenever you attempt a good work you will find other men doing the same kind of work and probably doing it better remember disciples they came to Jesus they see we see some people preach in your and not with us should we stop him po leave them they be preaching on my name and against me leave them alone they having problems with somebody not in your [Music] circle doing the same thing whenever you attempt a good work you find other men doing this and probably doing it better Envy them not is a feeling of ill will to those are in the same line as [Music] our love does not envy or resent other success it celebrates others achievement [Music] being magnanimous and free from jealousy this generosity is how love is how love behaves in oh my you love him this morning that's number three Hallelujah charity V not itself and is not puffed up humility after love works after love acts love hides and go in the background love does not seek attention or boast about its deed Love Remains modest hiding its actions and avoiding self-promotion with no desire of recognition not I am this and I am and you're beating your chest charity vaulted not itself is not love in hiding the next one do not behave itself unseemly that's love in society love behaves with politeness and respect manly embracing all people regardless of differences it is considerate it is thoughtful always polite respectful never rude or disc courtious do not behave itself unseemly the sixth one unselfishness not not selfish love seeks the good of others above its own interest the Bible talk about not mind your own things the things of others it does not pursue personal gain it focuses on serving and the scripture that is given here in love is seek it not her [Music] own is not selfish love is not seeking its own interest love want to serve love want to lift up others without bitterness without being vengeful not sour The Joy or happiness is not what you have or get but what you give it is more blessed to give than to [Music] receive Jesus said he that will be great among you let him serve good temper that's number seven Love Remains calm and this scripture praise the name of the Lord hallelujah praise God is not easily provoked there some people I I you say your blood close your skin your blood close to your skin anybody very [Music] touchy every small little thing you blow up you explode you see a little cockroach and big a big hammer cockroach don't H for that blowing your to love is not easily provoked Give the Lord some Praises Hallelujah hallelujah amen Love Remains calm This is Love and disposition selfcontrol so this is actually Temperance love never a short fuse you quick to blow your top never easily provoked or irritated or resentful amen amen but choosing patience and understand is not easy provoked amen number eight as love this one rejoices not in iniquity but rejoice in the truth love in conduct there are some people they want to see you fall they want to talk about you they don't have your interest at heart as soon as something negative happened to you you you hear what happened you know what went [Music] on love love don't do that Rejoice not in iniquity but rejoice in the truth loving conduct hating sin but covering the faults of other things it is eager to believe the best always hopeful and enduring slow to expose or judge that's love in righteousness the last one rejoices in the truth sincerity love rejoices in truth and righteousness This is Love and profession it is honest it is genuine it is free from hypocrisy always trying to uphold what is true or to be truthful in action or in words all right let's be Clos I can't stop right now just a few more things I want to get to you that maybe you know maybe you don't know but this is important but say this I believe the time is coming I believe are wonderful and we need them and respect them and I believe the time is coming when it's going to be a higher standard than that when all these things are done away that which is in love will endure forever it's the love of God and then he prophesy this we just be standing preaching like this or talking and love the love will just settle over the building this is message called God keeps his word he said we be standing talking and love could over the building do you know that could happen today do you know that that could
