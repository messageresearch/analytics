[17:31] Amen.
[17:33] Are you happy to be in the house of the
[17:35] Lord?
[17:37] &gt;&gt; Wonderful. Well, if you have your Bibles
[17:39] this afternoon
[17:41] [Music]
[17:51] uh we'll be reading from Psalm 84.
[17:55] That'll be our scripture reading
[17:59] to open up this meetings.
[18:04] [Music]
[18:06] Psalm 84 reads on this wise. How amiable
[18:09] are thy tabernacles, oh Lord of hosts.
[18:12] My soul longeth, yay, even fainted for
[18:15] the courts of the Lord. My heart and my
[18:18] flesh cried out for the living God. Yay,
[18:22] the sparrow had found an house, and the
[18:25] swallow a nest for herself where she may
[18:27] lay her young, even dine altars. Oh Lord
[18:30] of hosts, my king and my God. Blessed
[18:34] are they that dwell in thy house. They
[18:36] will be still praising thee, Zilla.
[18:39] Blessed is the man whose strength is in
[18:42] thee whose heart are the ways of them
[18:45] who passing through the valley of Baka
[18:48] make it a well. The rain also filth the
[18:51] pools. They grew from strength to
[18:53] strength. Every one of them in Zion
[18:55] appeared before God. Oh Lord God of
[18:58] hosts, hear my prayer. Give ear, oh God
[19:02] of Jacob, sill. Behold, oh God, our
[19:05] shield, and look upon the face of thine
[19:07] anointed. For a day in thy courts is
[19:11] better than a thousand. I had rather be
[19:14] a doorkeeper in the house of my God than
[19:17] to dwell in the tents of wickedness.
[19:20] For the Lord God is a son and shield.
[19:23] The Lord will give grace and glory. No
[19:27] good thing will he withhold from them
[19:30] that walk uprightly. Oh Lord of hosts,
[19:33] blessed is the man that trusted in thee.
[19:37] Amen. Do you believe that this
[19:38] afternoon?
[19:40] Amen. Let us pray together. You begin to
[19:42] talk to the Lord in your own way. I
[19:44] believe we all came here expecting to
[19:47] hear from God. We did not come to see
[19:49] one another. We came to get a blessing
[19:52] from God. So you begin to talk to the
[19:53] Lord in your own way this afternoon.
[19:57] Our gracious heavenly father, Lord, we
[20:00] thank you for the privilege that we can
[20:02] even be called your children. Lord, we
[20:05] thank you for the privilege, Lord, that
[20:06] you've given to us. Lord, there's 7
[20:09] billion people out there in the world,

[20:14] take it for granted. We just want to say
[20:16] thank you, Lord. The fact Lord that we
[20:18] even have breath in our nostrils Lord
[20:20] it's enough to give you all the praise
[20:22] to give you all the honor to just
[20:24] worship you Lord to lay aside our
[20:26] troubles to lay aside our worries
[20:29] whether things are working right whether
[20:30] things are not working right Lord we
[20:32] will love you Lord on the mountain top
[20:35] we will praise you down in the valley
[20:37] Lord we will surrender all to you oh God

[21:32] east, or west, God is a God of
[21:35] yesterday, today, and forever. You can
[21:38] visit with us. Lord, you were with Moses
[21:40] in the burning bush. Lord, you were with
[21:42] Daniel in the lion's den. Lord, Father,
[21:45] you were with David when he faced Golth.
[21:47] Father, when he faced the lion and the
[21:49] bear and Lord, today you can meet us.
[21:52] That same God is still alive today.
[21:54] Lord, may you bless the song service.

[42:34] Now listen, Satan, he don't like it
[42:39] talking about this good old way. The
[42:41] devil, he don't like it talking about
[42:45] the Lord. Oh, we'll go on. We'll go on
[42:50] talking about this through the way.
[42:53] Let's go on. Let's go on talking about
[42:57] the Lord.
[42:59] [Music]
[43:01] Hallelujah.
[43:04] Amen. You may you may please have your
[43:06] seats.
[43:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe the book of Lamentations
[43:10] chapter 3 talk says it is of the Lord's
[43:13] mercies that we are not consumed
[43:17] &gt;&gt; because his compassions fail not.
[43:20] &gt;&gt; They are new every morning.
[43:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. And sister Joy is going to sing a
[43:26] song about the mercy of God. God bless
[43:29] you.

[44:16] Now I'm alive to tell the story
[44:20] how I overcome.

[44:27] and the power of your blood. I'm so glad
[44:32] that my freedom
[44:34] wasn't based on what I've done.
[44:38] It's your goodness and mercy
[44:41] and the power of your blood.
[44:51] I thought I
[44:54] deserve
[44:57] to be six feet beneath the earth.
[45:02] [Music]
[45:04] For all the things I've done, the things
[45:07] I've said, choices made that I regret,
[45:14] I will still be lost.

[45:20] but for the mercies of God.
[45:24] [Applause]

[45:30] how I overcome.
[45:33] It's your goodness and mercy

[45:42] that my freedom
[45:44] wasn't based on what I've done. son.
[45:48] It's your goodness and mercy
[45:51] and the power of your blood.
[45:55] [Music]

[46:06] savior
[46:08] carried? Oh, I've been set free by the
[46:13] mercy of God. was the grave meant for me
[46:19] where my sin laid buried. Oh, I've been
[46:25] redeemed by the mercies of God. Oh, was
[46:30] your cross meant for me that my Savior
[46:36] carried away been made free by the
[46:42] mercies of God. Was that grave meant for
[46:47] me? Where my sin laid buried. Oh, I've
[46:53] been redeemed by the mercies of God. I'm
[46:59] alive to tell the story
[47:03] how I overcome.
[47:06] It's your goodness and mercy
[47:10] and the power of your blood. I'm so glad
[47:14] that my freedom
[47:17] wasn't based on what I've done.
[47:20] It's your goodness and mercy
[47:24] and the power of your blood.
[47:27] It's your goodness and mercy.
[47:31] And the power of your blood. It's your
[47:35] goodness and mercy.
[47:38] And the power of your blood.
[47:49] Amen. Wonderful.
[47:52] It's nothing but the amazing grace of
[47:54] God.
[47:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[47:59] &gt;&gt; Do you love the Lord?
[48:02] &gt;&gt; I always ask myself that question. Out
[48:05] of 7 billion people in the world, why
[48:07] me?
[48:09] &gt;&gt; Just think of it. Why me? Why? Why would
[48:11] God choose you and I? 7 billion people.
[48:14] There are tall people out there,
[48:16] handsome, muscular. God chose me.
[48:20] &gt;&gt; We should be We should be thankful.

[48:35] forward, let's do the song. The love of
[48:37] Jesus is so wonderful.
[48:40] Well, the love of Jesus is so wonderful.

[50:36] Love of Jesus.
[50:39] Oh, wonderful God.
[50:44] Father, we thank you and praise you for
[50:46] your presence here tonight. We invite
[50:49] you to have the preeminences in Jesus
[50:51] name. Amen and amen. God bless you. Have
[50:54] your seat. Amen. God bless you and
[50:56] welcome to our international 2025
[50:59] convention.
[51:00] &gt;&gt; We certainly happy to have you here.
[51:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:03] &gt;&gt; We have some ministers here among us.
[51:05] Like to welcome brother uh Tux Singh,
[51:07] brother Green, brother Norris, brother
[51:09] Andrew Fong, praise God, brother Alexis
[51:12] from uh from uh Kivoir, brother Etian
[51:16] man, brother Paulica,
[51:19] uh brother Stephanus from Germany and
[51:21] brother Raymond Thompson from South
[51:23] Africa. We welcome all of you.
[51:27] If there's any other minister here, we
[51:29] want to say God bless you and welcome.
[51:31] We appreciate uh what the Lord is doing.
[51:35] I just want to just say a few words. Uh
[51:37] before the speaker come, we have blessed
[51:39] this evening. We have brother Shem Ali
[51:40] going to be speaking for us this morning
[51:42] to to open up this convention. Praise
[51:45] God. We certainly appreciate him. And
[51:47] also brother Josh Gujarat will bring
[51:50] greetings and we're going to sing on
[51:51] special and bring greetings before he
[51:53] comes on. Amen. But this is brother
[51:54] Brandham. He said, "Always in the days
[51:56] gone by, the dispensation has always
[51:59] come to an end. There are junctions in
[52:01] the highway. There are junctions in the
[52:02] road. And it the junction on the highway
[52:06] that we travel to glory. And he said it
[52:08] always it takes the miraculous to speak
[52:10] of omnipotence.
[52:12] &gt;&gt; It takes the miraculous to vindicate the
[52:14] omnipotence. Teaching of the word is
[52:16] very fine and we and faith come by
[52:18] hearing and hearing the word. But it
[52:20] always take the miraculous to vindicate
[52:23] that omnipotence still lives and reign.
[52:26] &gt;&gt; Then he said this and I believe that the
[52:30] church is now standing on the threshold
[52:33] of the greatest vindication of
[52:35] omnipotence that the world has ever
[52:37] known. Oh praise God. The greatest
[52:41] vindication of omnipotence. Praise. And
[52:44] the most powerful thing in the world is
[52:46] love.
[52:47] &gt;&gt; Praise God. The most powerful thing,
[52:49] praise God, is the love of God. I'm so
[52:52] glad to hear that song. The love of
[52:54] Jesus is so wonderful. It's so high, you
[52:56] can't get over it. It's so low, you
[52:58] can't get around it. It could bring your
[53:00] mother, could bring your father, it
[53:01] could bring your brother, it could bring
[53:03] your minister, daughter, whoever,
[53:05] whosoever will, it could bring them.
[53:07] Don't give up on anyone because the love
[53:09] of Jesus is so wonderful. Amen.
[53:13] Watch God always always where he starts
[53:16] something new.
[53:18] &gt;&gt; He always show forth his power.
[53:21] &gt;&gt; Just before the junctions enter new
[53:23] dispensation, he appears on the scene
[53:25] with great miraculous signs and wonders.
[53:28] He has always done it.
[53:30] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the name of the Lord. He has
[53:32] always done it.
[53:34] &gt;&gt; Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord. At
[53:36] this time, I want to invite brother
[53:37] Joash, praise the name of the Lord, to
[53:39] come forward and he going to have a
[53:41] special for you. Praise God. Amen.
[53:43] Praise God. You're going to hear from
[53:44] God's servant going to speak to us
[53:45] today. Amen. God bless your virtual.
[53:46] Praise the Lord.
[53:51] &gt;&gt; You love him, friends.
[53:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. Good to be with you this evening
[53:55] that you're in the presence of the most
[53:57] high God. Amen. I believe it was David
[53:59] who said one time, "I once was young,
[54:02] now I'm old, but I've never seen the
[54:05] righteous forsaken."
[54:08] &gt;&gt; No, his seed begging bread. Amen. This
[54:10] &gt;&gt; this little song is uh testament of that
[54:14] truth
[54:19] [Music]
[54:33] as I kneel in the darkness
[54:37] in the middle of Tonight
[54:41] I'm praying for assurance
[54:45] that everything's going to be all right.
[54:49] Lord, I see another valley
[54:53] and it's out in front of me.
[54:57] I'm afraid I won't be able
[55:01] and I'll go down in defeat.
[55:05] But he said, "Do you remember
[55:09] just where I brought you from?
[55:13] Just take a look behind you and see how
[55:18] far you've come."
[55:21] And every time you asked me, "Didn't I
[55:26] deliver you?"
[55:29] Then why would you be thinking
[55:32] that I wouldn't see you through? Didn't
[55:36] I walk on the water
[55:40] and I calmed the raging sea?
[55:44] I spoke to the wind
[55:48] and it hushed and I gave you peace.
[55:51] Didn't I roam to your rescue? Didn't I
[55:56] hear you when you call?
[56:00] I walked right beside you just so you
[56:05] wouldn't fall. Didn't I leave all of
[56:09] heaven
[56:11] just to die for your sins?
[56:15] I searched until I found you. And I do
[56:19] it all again.
[56:22] Now she's talking to her father
[56:26] in a house that was once a home. She
[56:30] said, "My bills are getting due, Lord.
[56:34] And six days is not that long."
[56:37] Then she hears a voice both still and
[56:41] low. He said, "I move like that before
[56:45] and I'll do this little thing, child,
[56:49] but I'll give you so much more.
[56:52] Didn't I walk on the water
[56:56] and I calmed the region sea?
[57:01] I spoke to the wind
[57:04] and it hushed and I gave you peace.
[57:07] Didn't I come to your rescue? Didn't I
[57:12] hear you when you called?
[57:15] I walked right beside you just so you
[57:20] wouldn't fall. And didn't I leave all of
[57:25] heaven
[57:26] just to die for your sins?
[57:30] I searched until I found you and I'd do
[57:35] it all again.
[57:38] I put food on your table
[57:42] when the bills were due.
[57:45] When the pains were racking your body, I
[57:49] sent healing down to you. When you were
[57:53] lost in sin and sorrow,
[57:56] I died to set you free so that you would
[58:01] know just how much I love you. Let's
[58:05] sing that again. Oh,
[58:08] put food on your table. Showed up when
[58:12] the bills were due. And when the pains
[58:16] were rocking your body, I sent healing
[58:20] down to you. Then you were lost in sin
[58:24] and sorrow.
[58:26] I died to set you free so that you would
[58:30] know just how much I love you.
[58:37] [Music]
[58:41] [Applause]
[58:46] [Music]
[58:47] [Applause]
[58:52] When you are lost in sin and sorrow,
[58:56] I had to set you free so that you would
[59:01] know just how much I
[59:05] [Music]
[59:09] Glory to God.
[59:11] [Applause]
[59:19] Amen. Amen.
[59:23] Ain't God good for giving us so many
[59:25] blessings?
[59:26] &gt;&gt; Be seated my dear friends. Don't want to
[59:28] be very long. I want to bring the
[59:29] minister on.
[59:32] So good to be in the house of God today
[59:35] &gt;&gt; and to be among brethren of like
[59:37] precious faith.
[59:39] &gt;&gt; You know friends in seeking the Lord's
[59:40] guidance with respect to these few
[59:42] opening remarks and what I should say as
[59:45] a precursor to all that is soon to
[59:48] follow.
[59:49] Impressed very strongly upon me was the
[59:52] story of King David
[59:54] and his little band of faithful warriors
[59:57] as told in 2 Samuel chapter 23.
[1:00:00] beginning about uh verse 14.
[1:00:04] And friends, I have to admit, the more I
[1:00:05] meditated upon the scene which might
[1:00:07] have unfolded that day as the king and
[1:00:10] his men stood on the outskirts of the
[1:00:12] city,
[1:00:14] looking on in dismay
[1:00:17] as Bethlehem, the house of God's bread,
[1:00:20] was garrisoned about by the invading
[1:00:22] Philistine armies.
[1:00:25] The more I meditated upon that scene,
[1:00:27] the more convinced I was that in this
[1:00:30] particular convention meeting where
[1:00:33] there is assembled this afternoon from
[1:00:35] different parts of the world another
[1:00:37] little band of mighty gentile warriors.
[1:00:43] Perhaps the greatest thing that we could
[1:00:45] accomplish over the course of the next
[1:00:47] three days, the one thing that would
[1:00:49] make all the planning and all the
[1:00:51] preparation worth its weight in gold is
[1:00:54] if we like those brothers back there
[1:00:57] could supernaturally pick up the mind of
[1:00:59] our king,
[1:01:02] &gt;&gt; the great lion king,
[1:01:04] &gt;&gt; the one who has descended and is now
[1:01:06] calling for his queen to come and stand
[1:01:08] at his side.
[1:01:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:01:11] If we like those brethren back there,
[1:01:13] friends, we could supernaturally discern
[1:01:16] the desires of our king's heart
[1:01:20] &gt;&gt; and be just as determined as they were
[1:01:22] to do all that it takes to bring him a
[1:01:25] fresh drink,
[1:01:29] &gt;&gt; not just from any old broken sister now,
[1:01:32] &gt;&gt; but from the living waters of that well
[1:01:34] in Bethlehem,
[1:01:36] &gt;&gt; from the fountain that is even right now
[1:01:38] open in the house of David. If only we
[1:01:40] could accomplish these things. And I'm
[1:01:42] saying to you, maybe our coming would
[1:01:44] not be in vain.
[1:01:48] &gt;&gt; In December of 1963, God and prophet is
[1:01:51] in Phoenix, Arizona.
[1:01:53] He's preaching a message entitled Why
[1:01:56] Little Bethlehem?
[1:01:58] &gt;&gt; And somewhere around paragraph 138, the
[1:02:01] same spirit that anointed David back
[1:02:03] there, it begins speaking through the
[1:02:04] prophet in a very peculiar way. And it
[1:02:07] begins throwing out the very same
[1:02:10] challenge. Here what he says. Oh, come
[1:02:12] stand with me
[1:02:14] &gt;&gt; by my side.
[1:02:16] &gt;&gt; He says, "I'm standing in a terrible
[1:02:18] place. I challenge you today."
[1:02:21] &gt;&gt; These tapes go all over the world. I
[1:02:24] challenge some man, some warrior who
[1:02:27] loves Jesus Christ that knows that these
[1:02:29] things got to be fulfilled today.
[1:02:30] Brethren, come stand by my side
[1:02:34] &gt;&gt; and pull the word of God.
[1:02:37] &gt;&gt; Forget those dried sisters and stagnated
[1:02:39] denominations that you're living in.
[1:02:41] Pull the fresh word of God. He says,
[1:02:43] "Let's give Jesus a good drink of fresh
[1:02:46] Pentecostal water."
[1:02:52] &gt;&gt; He says that's his desire today. Back to
[1:02:55] the original Pentecost. Back to the
[1:02:57] word. Amen.
[1:03:00] &gt;&gt; He continues in paragraph 143 saying,
[1:03:02] "Oh men of God, where is that sword?"
[1:03:07] &gt;&gt; Our Lord desires a fresh drink.
[1:03:10] &gt;&gt; I don't care if it's life or death.
[1:03:12] Let's cut through this thing. It's so
[1:03:14] hard standing by yourself. I'm calling
[1:03:16] for men to stand by me. Stand with the
[1:03:20] word.
[1:03:21] &gt;&gt; What that word says, do it just the way
[1:03:23] the word said.
[1:03:24] &gt;&gt; I don't care what anything else says.
[1:03:26] Stay with it that way. But that's the
[1:03:28] only thing that will cut.
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; Let us get to Bethlehem for the true
[1:03:35] water of God. He says
[1:03:39] &gt;&gt; then in paragraph 145, the prophet says
[1:03:42] here what he says. Bashm, God is going
[1:03:44] to have a people
[1:03:46] &gt;&gt; that will drink from that well.
[1:03:52] &gt;&gt; Prophet screams out, hallelujah.
[1:03:54] [Applause]
[1:03:58] Now friends, what we need to understand
[1:04:00] is this. At the time when this challenge
[1:04:02] was being made,
[1:04:04] no one present quite understood
[1:04:07] why bringing the Christ the king a fresh
[1:04:09] drink would prove to be such a daunting
[1:04:12] task.
[1:04:13] &gt;&gt; Nobody understood it.
[1:04:15] &gt;&gt; But almost exactly two years later in
[1:04:18] November of 1965,
[1:04:20] the prophet of God is approaching the
[1:04:21] climax of his ministry now. And just
[1:04:24] about a month before he's called off of
[1:04:26] the scene, he's in Shreveport,
[1:04:29] Louisiana.
[1:04:30] &gt;&gt; And he's preaching a message now,
[1:04:32] brother Norris, God's only provided
[1:04:34] place of worship. Amen.
[1:04:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:38] &gt;&gt; And it is only when you consider the
[1:04:40] many things which he proceeds to lay out
[1:04:42] in his delivery of this sermon do you
[1:04:44] begin to really understand why it is
[1:04:46] virtually impossible but for anybody but
[1:04:49] the true anointed of God to bring the
[1:04:52] king a fresh drink today.
[1:04:58] &gt;&gt; Hear why it's such a challenge.
[1:05:00] &gt;&gt; Paragraph 49. And you hear the prophet
[1:05:02] saying there is the possibility of a
[1:05:04] person worshiping God in vain with
[1:05:06] sincere worship.
[1:05:09] &gt;&gt; And you ask yourself where is this
[1:05:11] coming from? Just about a month before
[1:05:12] the messenger fades off the scene. And
[1:05:14] this is the message going forward. Being
[1:05:16] sincere is not even enough anymore.
[1:05:20] &gt;&gt; Paragraph 50. You hear the prophet
[1:05:22] saying God just has one key now.
[1:05:26] &gt;&gt; There's just one key to every door. He
[1:05:28] has no skeleton key. He has got one key.
[1:05:31] You've got to have that key. He says or
[1:05:33] the door won't open no matter how
[1:05:35] sincere you are.
[1:05:39] &gt;&gt; Paragraph 52, you hear the prophet
[1:05:41] saying David was an anointed king. He
[1:05:43] was he was genuine in his desire to do
[1:05:45] God a service. He said, but when he
[1:05:46] commissioned the construction of a new
[1:05:48] cart to carry the word, the prophet says
[1:05:50] God dishonored the whole move.
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; Why? Because he did not use the right
[1:05:54] key. Hallelujah.
[1:05:57] &gt;&gt; Paragraph 79, you hear the prophet
[1:05:59] saying, "If there is one place that God
[1:06:01] meets with man today, then we had better
[1:06:04] be very careful."
[1:06:06] &gt;&gt; He says, "Let us lay aside our
[1:06:08] traditions now and be very sure that we
[1:06:10] find that one place."
[1:06:15] &gt;&gt; Paragraph 82, Brother Abraham showing us
[1:06:18] how finding that one provided place goes
[1:06:20] beyond sincerity. He picks up the story
[1:06:22] of Cain and Abel. He says Cain's
[1:06:24] sacrifice was not vindicated but Abel's
[1:06:27] sacrifice was vindicated. Why? Because
[1:06:29] Abel struck the true channel of God.
[1:06:34] &gt;&gt; And I dare say friends, this is what we
[1:06:36] are here to do in this convention this
[1:06:38] evening. This is what every worshipper
[1:06:40] is supposed to be striving for. This is
[1:06:42] what every God call ministry has been
[1:06:44] commissioned to do to strike the true
[1:06:46] channel of God today. Break into an
[1:06:48] inspiration that will elevate the people
[1:06:50] into the realms of rapturing faith.
[1:06:58] Paragraph 86. The prophet picks up Balam
[1:07:00] and Moses.
[1:07:02] I'm just showing you why it's a
[1:07:04] challenge.
[1:07:06] &gt;&gt; He picks up Balon and Moses. He says,
[1:07:07] "Fundamentally, Balam and Moses, you
[1:07:09] couldn't tell them apart.
[1:07:12] &gt;&gt; Both of them erected seven altars. In
[1:07:14] numerology, they were exactly the same."
[1:07:17] But Brandham says, "As fundamental as
[1:07:19] one was, the other one was also." He
[1:07:21] said, "But who did God vindicate?" The
[1:07:23] one that was in his word.
[1:07:26] &gt;&gt; Fundamental doesn't mean too much. He
[1:07:28] says, "It is the revelation of God."
[1:07:32] &gt;&gt; Paragraph 89, we hear the prophet
[1:07:34] saying, "You could take a good live egg,
[1:07:37] put it under a dead, and it will not
[1:07:38] hatch."
[1:07:40] &gt;&gt; He says, "The conditions have to be
[1:07:42] right, brother."
[1:07:44] &gt;&gt; And you ask me something, friends,
[1:07:45] listen. When it comes to this meeting
[1:07:47] and what we are able to accomplish for
[1:07:48] the kingdom, this is the bottom line.
[1:07:50] The overall conditions have to be right.
[1:07:53] The word inspiration has to be right.
[1:07:54] Our individual lives must be in the
[1:07:56] right condition. Our attitude to the
[1:07:58] Lord's service must be right. Our
[1:08:00] attitude towards each other has to be
[1:08:02] right.
[1:08:05] [Applause]
[1:08:08] &gt;&gt; Come to paragraph 90.
[1:08:11] And the prophet really begins to put the
[1:08:14] icing on the cake. He says, "Well,
[1:08:15] that's the way it is in this age that
[1:08:17] we're living in." You've got to find
[1:08:19] what is God's way of doing it for this
[1:08:21] age.
[1:08:24] &gt;&gt; Not everybody has access to that. Well,
[1:08:28] &gt;&gt; amen. The prophet says you got to find
[1:08:29] what is God's way of doing it for this
[1:08:31] age. That is what Martin Luther found.
[1:08:33] That is what John Wesley found. That is
[1:08:35] what the Pentecostals found in their
[1:08:36] age. God's age and time to do it.
[1:08:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:40] &gt;&gt; So, I'm saying to you friends, this
[1:08:41] thing does not come automatically. Every
[1:08:44] individual believer has to find that
[1:08:47] place where the anointing oil has been
[1:08:49] poured out again.
[1:08:52] &gt;&gt; Our spiritual Bethlehem, where our king
[1:08:55] has been anointed.
[1:08:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:58] &gt;&gt; And so what we're going to do as I
[1:09:00] conclude my few remarks, we're going to
[1:09:02] pray the same prayer
[1:09:04] &gt;&gt; that the prophet prayed when he came to
[1:09:06] the end of that sermon, Why Bethlehem?
[1:09:09] Hear the prayer. Paragraph 176. Oh God,
[1:09:13] &gt;&gt; anoint us with thy word
[1:09:15] &gt;&gt; and bring thy word promised to for this
[1:09:18] day to pass.
[1:09:20] &gt;&gt; May we leave this building this morning
[1:09:22] as shining instruments of God. May we go
[1:09:25] with the sword, it glittering in the air
[1:09:29] &gt;&gt; to cut away every weight and everything
[1:09:31] else
[1:09:32] &gt;&gt; till we can get the people back to
[1:09:35] Christ
[1:09:36] &gt;&gt; and bring a cool, fresh drink to our
[1:09:38] Lord instead of all these old stagnated
[1:09:42] creeds. Let the people drink from the
[1:09:44] fountain. a real cool refreshing
[1:09:48] Pentecostal blessing
[1:09:50] &gt;&gt; that it might bless his heart and bring
[1:09:53] him back among us again.
[1:09:55] &gt;&gt; Grant it Lord in Jesus name I pray.
[1:09:58] &gt;&gt; Let the bride say amen.
[1:10:01] &gt;&gt; God bless you
[1:10:07] church say amen.
[1:10:10] &gt;&gt; You appreciate brother Josh.
[1:10:13] Wonderful.
[1:10:16] Hallelujah.
[1:10:18] Amen. It's an honor and privilege to
[1:10:20] invite brother Shem Ali to the pulpit.
[1:10:22] And as he comes, let's do the song. I am
[1:10:27] redeemed.
[1:10:29] I've been bought with
[1:10:33] a price.
[1:10:35] Oh Jesus,
[1:10:38] he has changed my whole life.
[1:10:45] Oh, if anybody
[1:10:49] asks you
[1:10:52] just who I am.
[1:10:56] Oh, tell them. Oh, that I am
[1:11:02] redeemed.
[1:11:05] Oh, sing it again. Oh, I am
[1:11:10] redeemed.
[1:11:12] I've been above the weight
[1:11:15] of cross.
[1:11:17] Oh Jesus,
[1:11:20] he has changed my whole life.
[1:11:25] If anybody ask you, if anybody
[1:11:31] asks you
[1:11:33] just who
[1:11:36] I am,
[1:11:38] who tell them that I am
[1:11:44] redeemed.
[1:11:47] [Applause]
[1:12:05] [Applause]
[1:12:08] Hallelujah.
[1:12:11] &gt;&gt; Kindly take your seats tonight.
[1:12:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:19] God bless you saints.
[1:12:22] &gt;&gt; I would like to first
[1:12:25] greet the elect lady,
[1:12:29] the lovely bride
[1:12:33] of the Lord Jesus Christ,
[1:12:37] without whom these meetings
[1:12:41] would not have been possible.
[1:12:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. is also with great joy
[1:12:47] and respect.
[1:12:50] I salute my minister, brethren,
[1:12:55] particularly
[1:12:58] those who master
[1:13:01] &gt;&gt; brother to you.
[1:13:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. the one upon whose
[1:13:06] heart the Lord has seen fit to place a
[1:13:10] desire
[1:13:12] for staging
[1:13:14] of this special event.
[1:13:17] Amen.
[1:13:18] &gt;&gt; May the Lord reward you a hundfold.
[1:13:23] for your efforts
[1:13:29] and my humble prayers
[1:13:32] that over the course of these three days
[1:13:36] something will be said to inspire
[1:13:39] &gt;&gt; and encourage
[1:13:42] the entire body of Christ
[1:13:46] represented here this afternoon. Amen.
[1:13:50] &gt;&gt; I am deeply honored
[1:13:53] and humbled to be
[1:13:55] with you at this convention
[1:13:59] &gt;&gt; and I thank God for this opportunity.
[1:14:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:15] &gt;&gt; Of course, these three days
[1:14:18] We will worship together.
[1:14:22] &gt;&gt; We will pray together.
[1:14:24] &gt;&gt; We'll open the scriptures together.
[1:14:28] &gt;&gt; But more than anything,
[1:14:31] I pray we encounter
[1:14:35] Jesus in a most outstanding way.
[1:14:41] Not just as a concept of doctrine,
[1:14:46] &gt;&gt; but as a living Christ
[1:14:50] &gt;&gt; who walks among us
[1:14:53] &gt;&gt; and speaks to us
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; with an everlasting love.
[1:15:01] So thank you again
[1:15:04] for the invitation
[1:15:07] &gt;&gt; and for the trust
[1:15:09] and for the grace to be among you.
[1:15:13] &gt;&gt; Let us approach this convention
[1:15:17] not just as an event
[1:15:20] but as a sacred appointment.
[1:15:25] &gt;&gt; May our hearts be open.
[1:15:27] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:15:28] &gt;&gt; May our minds be attentive.
[1:15:31] Amen.
[1:15:31] &gt;&gt; And may the Holy Spirit
[1:15:35] have his way.
[1:15:39] I am quoting from the message
[1:15:42] faith once delivered
[1:15:44] to the saints 1953
[1:15:47] 57
[1:15:49] paragraph three
[1:15:52] where the prophet of God was saying
[1:15:56] I am trusting
[1:15:59] that this convention
[1:16:02] &gt;&gt; will be one of the most outstanding
[1:16:05] conventions
[1:16:09] that this group
[1:16:11] &gt;&gt; has at any time.
[1:16:14] &gt;&gt; Not because I am with you again this
[1:16:17] time, but because I think it's time
[1:16:22] that the great church of the living God
[1:16:26] stand to her feet.
[1:16:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. And shook
[1:16:32] &gt;&gt; herself and get ready.
[1:16:36] Amen.
[1:16:38] In a message what here is thou Elijah
[1:16:41] 1959
[1:16:43] paragraph five the prophet is praying.
[1:16:46] He says
[1:16:48] I pray Lord
[1:16:50] that you will bless this convention.
[1:16:54] Just let this be a different convention.
[1:17:00] Amen.
[1:17:02] &gt;&gt; Different convention
[1:17:05] than what we have had.
[1:17:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:10] &gt;&gt; Make it in the same manner
[1:17:12] but greater Lord.
[1:17:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:17:18] &gt;&gt; May there be may there just be something
[1:17:23] that will sit down by the side
[1:17:26] of the burning bush and listen
[1:17:30] to what he has to say
[1:17:32] during this time.
[1:17:35] &gt;&gt; May we wait upon him
[1:17:38] for we know that he is our strength
[1:17:43] &gt;&gt; and our life. Amen.
[1:17:45] &gt;&gt; Help us, Father,
[1:17:47] &gt;&gt; in the time of these meetings.
[1:17:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:51] &gt;&gt; As we sat under the shade tree
[1:17:54] &gt;&gt; as it was
[1:17:56] in the school,
[1:17:58] help us to know more of thee
[1:18:01] &gt;&gt; so that we can go from this convention
[1:18:05] &gt;&gt; better equipped
[1:18:07] &gt;&gt; than we were
[1:18:09] &gt;&gt; when we came in.
[1:18:11] But we ask it
[1:18:14] in the name
[1:18:16] amen of Jesus Christ.
[1:18:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:28] Hallelujah.
[1:18:31] &gt;&gt; Just invite you to stand, saints of God.
[1:18:36] Amen. As we bow heads, we like to pray.
[1:18:41] Gracious heavenly father,
[1:18:45] &gt;&gt; we are very thankful tonight that
[1:18:49] &gt;&gt; this convention was in your mind
[1:18:53] before the foundation of the world.
[1:18:57] &gt;&gt; You thought of it, Lord.
[1:19:00] You thought of your people,
[1:19:04] Father.
[1:19:06] You thought of all those that would be
[1:19:08] here this evening,
[1:19:11] &gt;&gt; the different ministers
[1:19:14] from the different countries that are
[1:19:16] represented here today.
[1:19:19] You thought of Lord
[1:19:22] what they would minister on.
[1:19:24] You thought of the subject Lord.
[1:19:28] You thought of everything. Father,
[1:19:31] you thought of the members of the lady
[1:19:33] that would be here.
[1:19:35] Father, we pray this evening
[1:19:39] that your great Holy Spirit will take
[1:19:42] complete control of the convention. Oh
[1:19:44] God, conduct it as you see fit to your
[1:19:48] honor and glory. Father, may your name
[1:19:51] be glorified. May your name be
[1:19:54] magnified.
[1:19:55] May we come, Lord God, to the end of the
[1:19:58] service. will give you all the praise
[1:20:02] and all the honor and all the glory that
[1:20:05] belonging on to your great name. We
[1:20:08] realized without you Lord we could do
[1:20:11] nothing Lord we are totally dependent
[1:20:15] upon you Lord uh part of your spirit uh
[1:20:19] upon your children uh upon the speakers
[1:20:23] uh upon Lord God uh every member of the
[1:20:26] lady is my humble prayer father
[1:20:31] &gt;&gt; in Jesus name I pray
[1:20:35] &gt;&gt; amen I draw like to draw your attention
[1:20:37] [Music]
[1:20:39] to first John.
[1:20:41] Amen. 47-12.
[1:20:47] Amen. And also to first Corinthians.
[1:20:52] Amen. 13.
[1:20:55] Let's read from 1 John 4:7-12.
[1:21:00] Amen.
[1:21:04] It reads,
[1:21:06] "Beloved,
[1:21:09] let us love
[1:21:11] one another,
[1:21:13] &gt;&gt; for love is of God."
[1:21:16] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:21:18] &gt;&gt; And everyone that loveth
[1:21:21] is born of God,
[1:21:24] &gt;&gt; and knoweth God.
[1:21:27] He that loveth not
[1:21:30] knoweth not God,
[1:21:33] for God is love.
[1:21:38] &gt;&gt; And this was manifested
[1:21:42] the love of God towards us
[1:21:45] &gt;&gt; because that God sent
[1:21:48] his only begotten son
[1:21:51] into the world
[1:21:54] that we might live through him.
[1:21:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:57] hearing his love.
[1:22:00] Not that we love God,
[1:22:03] but that he loved us.
[1:22:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:06] &gt;&gt; And sent his son
[1:22:09] to be the propitiation
[1:22:12] for our sins.
[1:22:14] &gt;&gt; Beloved,
[1:22:16] if God so loved us,
[1:22:18] we ought also
[1:22:22] to love one another. Amen.
[1:22:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:25] &gt;&gt; No man has seen God at any time.
[1:22:29] &gt;&gt; If we have love one to another,
[1:22:32] God dwelleth in us
[1:22:35] and his love
[1:22:37] is
[1:22:39] perfected in us.
[1:22:42] &gt;&gt; Like to read one more scripture.
[1:22:45] First Corinthian 13.
[1:22:48] It says, "And now abided
[1:22:52] faith,
[1:22:54] charity, faith, hope and charity, oh
[1:22:58] love,
[1:22:59] these three,
[1:23:01] but the greatest
[1:23:04] is charity."
[1:23:06] &gt;&gt; Kindly take your seat, saints.
[1:23:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:23:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:23:18] When our prophet,
[1:23:22] when our vindicated prophet
[1:23:25] was quartered beyond
[1:23:28] the curtain of time
[1:23:32] and had returned,
[1:23:35] he faithfully shared
[1:23:39] his experience
[1:23:41] with the universal bride
[1:23:44] of Jesus Christ.
[1:23:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:48] &gt;&gt; Which the true bride
[1:23:50] believes without question.
[1:23:53] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:23:54] And in the message rejected, King
[1:23:58] reed of his wonderful
[1:24:02] and most encouraging
[1:24:06] and most enlightening experience
[1:24:11] as he related it
[1:24:14] in 1960 paragraph
[1:24:18] 146 of rejected king.
[1:24:22] He went on to say,
[1:24:25] "I heard a voice
[1:24:28] that spoke to me."
[1:24:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:33] &gt;&gt; Which means, saints of God,
[1:24:36] it had to be a supernatural voice.
[1:24:41] &gt;&gt; That was in the room.
[1:24:44] And it said
[1:24:46] this is what you preached
[1:24:50] &gt;&gt; was your Holy Ghost.
[1:24:53] &gt;&gt; This is perfect love.
[1:24:58] &gt;&gt; And nothing.
[1:25:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:03] And since he was speaking
[1:25:07] to bride to persons,
[1:25:10] Amen.
[1:25:12] He said no person sorry and nothing
[1:25:19] &gt;&gt; or no person
[1:25:22] or not a single person
[1:25:26] no exception
[1:25:29] can enter here
[1:25:31] &gt;&gt; without it.
[1:25:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:38] &gt;&gt; Can enter here without it.
[1:25:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:42] that perfect love.
[1:25:45] &gt;&gt; I am more determined
[1:25:48] &gt;&gt; than ever in my life
[1:25:51] &gt;&gt; that it takes perfect love
[1:25:54] &gt;&gt; to enter there.
[1:25:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:03] &gt;&gt; And that includes me.
[1:26:08] lose this philosophy.
[1:26:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; There was no jealousy.
[1:26:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:19] &gt;&gt; In other words, there was no envious
[1:26:21] feeling
[1:26:23] &gt;&gt; of resentment.
[1:26:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:28] &gt;&gt; There was no tiredness.
[1:26:31] &gt;&gt; There was no death.
[1:26:34] &gt;&gt; There was no sickness.
[1:26:37] can never enter there.
[1:26:39] &gt;&gt; Mortality
[1:26:42] can never make you old.
[1:26:46] They couldn't cry.
[1:26:48] Paragraph 164.
[1:26:52] Oh my precious friends,
[1:26:56] my precious darlings
[1:27:00] of the gospel.
[1:27:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. My begotten children unto God,
[1:27:07] listen to me, your pastor.
[1:27:11] I wish there was some way
[1:27:14] I could tell it to you.
[1:27:17] There's no words.
[1:27:19] I couldn't find it.
[1:27:22] It's not found anywhere.
[1:27:26] &gt;&gt; But just beyond this last breath
[1:27:29] is the most glorious thing.
[1:27:34] Amen. You ever
[1:27:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:39] &gt;&gt; Most glorious which means
[1:27:42] very beautiful
[1:27:44] &gt;&gt; and very impressive.
[1:27:48] &gt;&gt; There's no way to explain it.
[1:27:51] &gt;&gt; I just can't do it.
[1:27:54] &gt;&gt; Whatever Whatever you do, friends,
[1:27:58] &gt;&gt; lay aside everything.
[1:28:02] In other words, lay aside the glitter
[1:28:06] and the glamour of the womb
[1:28:10] &gt;&gt; till you get perfect love.
[1:28:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:18] &gt;&gt; Which is tremendously
[1:28:21] important
[1:28:23] to each one of us.
[1:28:26] Get to a spot
[1:28:29] that you can love everybody,
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; every enemy.
[1:28:34] &gt;&gt; That one visit there.
[1:28:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:40] &gt;&gt; To me
[1:28:42] has made me a different man.
[1:28:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:28:47] &gt;&gt; I can never
[1:28:49] never
[1:28:51] be
[1:28:52] &gt;&gt; the same brother Bernie.
[1:28:56] that I was.
[1:28:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. Proverb 172.
[1:29:03] &gt;&gt; I am sure Lord
[1:29:06] &gt;&gt; if this little church this morning can
[1:29:10] look just look past the curtain.
[1:29:14] &gt;&gt; Not an affliction
[1:29:16] among them.
[1:29:18] No,
[1:29:20] never could be
[1:29:23] &gt;&gt; not a sickness,
[1:29:25] &gt;&gt; nothing but perfection.
[1:29:29] &gt;&gt; And it's just one breath
[1:29:32] &gt;&gt; between here and there.
[1:29:35] &gt;&gt; From old age to youth,
[1:29:38] &gt;&gt; from time to eternity.
[1:29:41] &gt;&gt; And truly, Father, nothing can enter
[1:29:46] &gt;&gt; that holy place.
[1:29:49] with that type of love,
[1:29:53] &gt;&gt; the new birth
[1:29:56] &gt;&gt; to be born again.
[1:29:59] &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit,
[1:30:02] &gt;&gt; God is love.
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; And we know that
[1:30:08] that is true.
[1:30:11] &gt;&gt; No matter if
[1:30:14] we move mountains by faith, Amen.
[1:30:19] &gt;&gt; If we did great things
[1:30:23] still without
[1:30:27] still without that day or that perfect
[1:30:31] love,
[1:30:32] we can never climb
[1:30:35] that great ladder
[1:30:37] &gt;&gt; yonder.
[1:30:40] In other words, without
[1:30:42] perfect love.
[1:30:45] But that with but without
[1:30:48] love
[1:30:50] it will take us beyond this earthly
[1:30:54] cares.
[1:30:56] Paragraph 176
[1:30:59] in his prayer.
[1:31:02] Amen. four and with the people that he
[1:31:06] was ministering to,
[1:31:09] he asked them to repeat, "Say, Lord,
[1:31:13] place within my heart
[1:31:16] &gt;&gt; and in my soul
[1:31:19] &gt;&gt; that I may love and honor and have that
[1:31:23] divine love
[1:31:25] &gt;&gt; in my heart today that would take me to
[1:31:29] the land
[1:31:31] when my final breath
[1:31:34] leads me. Amen. Leaves me.
[1:31:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:46] &gt;&gt; So without perfect love, friends,
[1:31:49] we cannot enter into the six
[1:31:52] &gt;&gt; or the seven dimension
[1:31:56] which is the dimension of love.
[1:32:00] It's the dimension
[1:32:03] of eternal love.
[1:32:05] And I'd like to read to you first John 4
[1:32:09] and 8.
[1:32:11] For it says that God is love.
[1:32:15] &gt;&gt; It's what is it's what he is.
[1:32:19] &gt;&gt; He is love. Yes sir.
[1:32:22] &gt;&gt; For love is not just an attribute of God
[1:32:28] &gt;&gt; or divine quality of God
[1:32:31] &gt;&gt; or divine virtue of God.
[1:32:35] &gt;&gt; Love is the very nature
[1:32:38] &gt;&gt; of almighty God.
[1:32:41] &gt;&gt; Love is what he is.
[1:32:44] [Applause]
[1:32:46] He is the very source and fountain of
[1:32:49] love.
[1:32:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:57] &gt;&gt; Love
[1:32:59] or gapy love
[1:33:01] or divine love
[1:33:04] had its origin in God.
[1:33:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:10] And since God is eternal, then this love
[1:33:15] is eternal also.
[1:33:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:21] &gt;&gt; So there's no end to this love.
[1:33:24] &gt;&gt; This love is eternal.
[1:33:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. There's absolutely
[1:33:31] no end to this love. It will continue on
[1:33:35] from time
[1:33:38] &gt;&gt; into eternity.
[1:33:40] &gt;&gt; It will continue on
[1:33:43] &gt;&gt; from earth to heaven.
[1:33:47] &gt;&gt; I'm quoting from the message love
[1:33:51] &gt;&gt; 57 paragraph nine. And the reason I
[1:33:55] chose
[1:33:57] this tonight
[1:33:59] because my team
[1:34:02] has always been love.
[1:34:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. My subject matter. In other words,
[1:34:09] I think love
[1:34:12] is the most powerful force
[1:34:16] &gt;&gt; the world has.
[1:34:18] It's the most powerful force
[1:34:22] &gt;&gt; that the world has
[1:34:25] &gt;&gt; because God is love
[1:34:28] &gt;&gt; and there is no more powerful force
[1:34:32] &gt;&gt; than God.
[1:34:35] [Applause]
[1:34:38] &gt;&gt; And love
[1:34:40] is one of the greatest things
[1:34:43] I can speak on.
[1:34:47] Amen. And that's why first Corinthian
[1:34:51] Paul under divine inspiration
[1:34:54] he said now abide it
[1:34:57] faith hope and love.
[1:35:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:03] &gt;&gt; But the greatest of these
[1:35:06] is love tonight.
[1:35:09] &gt;&gt; The greatest of these
[1:35:13] &gt;&gt; is love.
[1:35:15] No one can fully explain
[1:35:18] the love of God.
[1:35:20] Though many have tried, the poets, the
[1:35:24] songwriters,
[1:35:26] Amen. They have failed.
[1:35:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:28] &gt;&gt; We ministers preach.
[1:35:32] Amen.
[1:35:33] The love of God.
[1:35:36] But we cannot explain it. This
[1:35:40] &gt;&gt; we cannot explain it fully.
[1:35:44] This wondrous
[1:35:46] love,
[1:35:48] &gt;&gt; this wondrous love,
[1:35:50] &gt;&gt; we cannot fully explain it.
[1:35:53] &gt;&gt; I think
[1:35:56] if one thing
[1:35:58] that is needed
[1:36:00] in the great universal church tonight.
[1:36:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. I think if one thing, not two
[1:36:12] things, not three, amen, if one thing is
[1:36:16] needed in the universal church of God
[1:36:20] tonight is love.
[1:36:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:34] quote continues.
[1:36:36] &gt;&gt; We do not need our gifts
[1:36:41] &gt;&gt; and our emotions
[1:36:44] as much as we think we do,
[1:36:47] &gt;&gt; though they are wonderful.
[1:36:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. To God and to God we give praise
[1:36:55] &gt;&gt; that we have them.
[1:36:57] &gt;&gt; But if these gifts
[1:36:59] &gt;&gt; are not governed by love,
[1:37:03] Amen.
[1:37:05] &gt;&gt; They must be governed and controlled by
[1:37:09] love.
[1:37:11] [Applause]
[1:37:18] &gt;&gt; If these gifts are not governed by love,
[1:37:23] they are not effective.
[1:37:26] [Applause]
[1:37:28] Instead of resting our faith on some
[1:37:32] kind, some emotion
[1:37:34] &gt;&gt; which is all right like shouting or
[1:37:38] speaking in tongues, we should rest our
[1:37:40] faith upon the love of God.
[1:37:46] &gt;&gt; We should rest our faith upon the love
[1:37:50] of God.
[1:37:56] Amen.
[1:37:58] &gt;&gt; Go continues.
[1:38:01] &gt;&gt; Love is the main thing.
[1:38:06] &gt;&gt; Love is the main thing.
[1:38:11] This the main thing
[1:38:14] may tren us tonight. That love is the
[1:38:19] main thing. Brother
[1:38:21] [Applause]
[1:38:30] Amen.
[1:38:32] &gt;&gt; Is the main thing is the most important
[1:38:35] thing. It's loving God.
[1:38:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:46] Is the most important thing.
[1:38:49] In other words, saints of God, love,
[1:38:53] amen, is of great importance to us. Is
[1:38:57] of great significance and of great value
[1:39:01] to us tonight.
[1:39:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. Quote continues, "Whether it be
[1:39:05] prophecy,
[1:39:07] &gt;&gt; they shall fail."
[1:39:10] &gt;&gt; Whether there be tongues,
[1:39:13] they shall cease.
[1:39:16] Where there be knowledge, it shall
[1:39:20] vanish away.
[1:39:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:39:28] &gt;&gt; Now abideth,
[1:39:30] &gt;&gt; fake, hope.
[1:39:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. But the greatest of these
[1:39:39] &gt;&gt; is love.
[1:39:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:43] The greatest of these is love. Love is
[1:39:48] the greatest. Nothing will ever be
[1:39:52] greater for God is love. Nothing will be
[1:39:57] greater than love because God is love.
[1:40:02] [Applause]
[1:40:11] quoting from faith is the substance.
[1:40:14] &gt;&gt; 51:16.
[1:40:17] &gt;&gt; Now love
[1:40:19] one another
[1:40:22] &gt;&gt; above everything you do.
[1:40:29] &gt;&gt; What a challenge for us today.
[1:40:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Love one another
[1:40:36] above everything you do. Love one
[1:40:39] another.
[1:40:41] As you love one another, you will love
[1:40:44] God.
[1:40:45] [Applause]
[1:40:47] &gt;&gt; God
[1:40:49] is love.
[1:40:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:40:54] &gt;&gt; A man that walks in love,
[1:40:56] &gt;&gt; walks in life and perfect love, Amen.
[1:41:01] casted out
[1:41:03] &gt;&gt; all shame.
[1:41:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:07] I'm quoting from God.
[1:41:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Perfecting the church
[1:41:12] &gt;&gt; 549.
[1:41:14] &gt;&gt; All Christianity
[1:41:17] &gt;&gt; is wrapped up
[1:41:19] &gt;&gt; in one big Amen
[1:41:23] love affair tonight.
[1:41:26] &gt;&gt; All Christianity
[1:41:29] &gt;&gt; is wrapped up
[1:41:31] &gt;&gt; in one great love affair.
[1:41:34] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that?
[1:41:36] Love is the most perfect thing
[1:41:39] &gt;&gt; in the Bible.
[1:41:43] &gt;&gt; God is love
[1:41:48] &gt;&gt; and they that love
[1:41:50] &gt;&gt; are of God.
[1:41:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:56] All saints of God.
[1:41:59] &gt;&gt; And they that love,
[1:42:02] amen, are of God.
[1:42:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:07] &gt;&gt; And I want you to know, saints, that if
[1:42:10] you are born of God,
[1:42:13] &gt;&gt; it's impossible for you not to love.
[1:42:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:23] &gt;&gt; It's impossible.
[1:42:25] for you not to display the love of God
[1:42:29] in your
[1:42:32] &gt;&gt; impossible.
[1:42:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:49] &gt;&gt; This morning,
[1:42:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:55] Hallelujah.
[1:42:58] &gt;&gt; I want you to see saints.
[1:43:01] &gt;&gt; Love
[1:43:04] is the distinctive
[1:43:07] &gt;&gt; characteristic
[1:43:10] &gt;&gt; of the bride
[1:43:12] &gt;&gt; for it stands
[1:43:14] above the rest.
[1:43:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:20] For Jesus said this,
[1:43:23] &gt;&gt; "By this
[1:43:26] shall all men know
[1:43:29] &gt;&gt; that ye are my disciples."
[1:43:32] If Amen. If we have love,
[1:43:36] [Applause]
[1:43:57] &gt;&gt; not by this.
[1:44:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Not by these.
[1:44:04] &gt;&gt; But by this
[1:44:08] &gt;&gt; shall all men know.
[1:44:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. That ye are my disciples.
[1:44:14] &gt;&gt; If you have love one to another.

[1:44:49] again and not love like Jesus loved.

[1:44:58] love life.
[1:45:03] Hallelujah.
[1:45:06] &gt;&gt; He became your perfect
[1:45:08] &gt;&gt; and my perfect example
[1:45:11] &gt;&gt; in the love life.
[1:45:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:16] &gt;&gt; Oh saint.
[1:45:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.

[1:48:26] &gt;&gt; Oh saints.
[1:48:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[1:50:20] It says, "And everyone that loveth
[1:50:23] is born of God."
[1:50:26] &gt;&gt; To be born of God means to be begotten
[1:50:29] of God.
[1:50:31] &gt;&gt; It means to be born again. It means to
[1:50:33] be regenerated. It means to become a new
[1:50:36] creation. All things have passed away
[1:50:40] &gt;&gt; and all things have become new.

[2:06:16] Love influences

[2:07:24] mountains.
[2:07:26] Amen.
[2:07:28] But if you don't have love, brother,
[2:07:31] &gt;&gt; it must be in proportion
[2:07:35] &gt;&gt; to your love. Amen.
[2:07:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:07:41] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[2:07:43] &gt;&gt; Oh, saints.

[2:07:56] and have not love.
[2:07:58] &gt;&gt; He's only saying he have faith.

[2:08:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:09] &gt;&gt; All sins,
[2:08:12] his boasting is in vain.
[2:08:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:20] &gt;&gt; If he says, "I'm a person of great
[2:08:22] love."
[2:08:25] Amen.
[2:08:27] Then you'll see the manifestation
[2:08:30] of great faith, saints of God.
[2:08:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:08:39] &gt;&gt; In 1 Corinthians 13,
[2:08:42] Paul gave us an inspired description,
[2:08:47] amen, of love
[2:08:50] &gt;&gt; and being anointed by the Holy Spirit.

[2:08:58] between the gifts.
[2:09:02] Amen.
[2:09:04] Tongues of men and of angels.
[2:09:09] Amen.
[2:09:10] He began to show
[2:09:13] the difference between
[2:09:16] Amen. and man's eloquence
[2:09:19] and the tongs of angels.
[2:09:22] Then he continued to show the difference
[2:09:26] between the gift of prophecy
[2:09:28] and understanding all the mysteries.
[2:09:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:34] And having faith to move mountains.
[2:09:38] &gt;&gt; And these are the things
[2:09:42] that man in that day.

[2:10:05] their personal magnetism,
[2:10:09] and how deep they are in the word.
[2:10:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:16] Hallelujah.
[2:10:18] But Paul says,
[2:10:21] "Amen." You can boast of all of that.

[2:11:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. So let me close.

[2:11:13] this evening.
[2:11:15] Amen.
[2:11:18] And saints of God, Paul
[2:11:21] concluded his remarks.

[2:11:30] &gt;&gt; Not ever,
[2:11:32] &gt;&gt; not at all.
[2:11:33] &gt;&gt; Surely not.

[2:11:50] &gt;&gt; Whether there be tongues, they shall
[2:11:52] cease.
[2:11:55] &gt;&gt; Shall come to an end. Whether there be
[2:11:57] knowledge, it shall vanish away.
[2:12:01] &gt;&gt; Completely cease to exist.
[2:12:05] &gt;&gt; Now abideth.
[2:12:07] faith, hope, love, deep free.
