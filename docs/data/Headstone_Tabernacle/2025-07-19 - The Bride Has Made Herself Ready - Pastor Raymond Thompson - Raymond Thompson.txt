So, we're here this morning to give God the praise. We want to represent the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. So, we had um it's this convention, you know, we we always under expectation for this convention. &gt;&gt; And to me, we we in a season, we in a time, &gt;&gt; we in the time of adoption. God is going to do something, friends. And we're going to read a little quote here just to see a little something else for a little 10 minutes quickly that we can try to understand where we located, what God is doing right now. &gt;&gt; We believe that we are the final voice to the final age. &gt;&gt; That's who we are. The bride has a voice. &gt;&gt; Amen. The bride will leave here tremendous. She will leave here with power. She will leave her with glory because God said so. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we want to we want to give God thanks. You know we had a little uh brother read a quote and he talk about uh the uh miraculous two miraculous meeting and and when God is doing something he bring it with power &gt;&gt; and he said we on the verge and something is happening on the earth right now &gt;&gt; and then here we had brother uh uh brother uh uh this brother Josh and he start to speak about the gentile warriors &gt;&gt; and that's who we are so so everything is coming into in in in a unity amen it's coming inside us so we have these warriors Yes, that's who we are this morning &gt;&gt; to bring a clean fresh drink for the king. &gt;&gt; And then we had brother brother Shem come and he let us know, hey, this can't work without the love of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The love of God had to work this thing. &gt;&gt; Yes, it cannot. Amen. &gt;&gt; And and then we had brother Stephan last night talk about, you know, the shina glory &gt;&gt; and we fellowship him with this mystery and this glory. So we we come to to continue this this this talking because I believe that the church is on the their place. She's on the verge. season and a place right now to shoot for this power that God has released to the church, friends. Amen. We don't want to just walk around and barely get along street. Amen. There's a power in us that God has invested in the church of the living God. Amen. And the devil had to flee when this bride is on the scene this morning. Amen. So here the prophet is telling us in the beginning was the word. Now as far as your mental theology could think the the the word before it was a word, there's a thought. And Moses said in the beginning &gt;&gt; and John said in the beginning but then when the prophet came he said we're going to go before the beginning. Before the beginning in God's mind where we were as the thoughts of almighty God that's who we are and that power amen has invested in this bride in the thoughts and these thoughts now are manifested on the earth. &gt;&gt; So we've been the thoughts of God have a quality in God gene. We belong to God so so strong that we have the attributes of God in us. So we're going to be like God is a promise in the word. But in the beginning the man fell. He lost his godship. He lost his sunship. But something is happening. Amen. In this season God has sent a word. The seals has been revealed. The book has been opened. And now God a people is on the earth where God is going to deal with this people what he did what he promised in the word. She's going to have that power. He's going to have that authority. And here he's telling us here, we go right back to Genesis again in the original. What is it? It's God moving. His nature is groaning. There's crying. Everything is moving for what? The manifestation of the sons of God. &gt;&gt; Listen. When true sons, &gt;&gt; born sons, fil sons speak and their word is backed up. And that God is here this morning to back up your word that the bride is speaking this morning. It's moving forward with that power. Listen carefully. He had a prophet. What kind of people would we be this morning? Amen. &gt;&gt; He says if the brand tabernacle &gt;&gt; I am saying if this headstone tabernacle &gt;&gt; if this convention this morning &gt;&gt; was so filled with the presence of God &gt;&gt; by when you didn't even use your own mind &gt;&gt; not even your own thoughts not your own alternative but there are sons of God led by the spirits of God when the human element goes out and the spirit of God fills the vacancy. &gt;&gt; Amen. where you are empty, empty yourself. Then will be when the church in its power of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ will walk in his steps, &gt;&gt; in his power, in his thoughts, in his being, in his moving. Amen. Hear what he says quickly. Now he says, then your will, your thoughts will become words &gt;&gt; and your words will become material. &gt;&gt; That's when the church in its power. &gt;&gt; You believe this morning, friends? I believe to be on the road right now. I believe she's on the verge. I believe what is happening upon the earth. The bride is ready. Amen. Satan is already defeated. &gt;&gt; Here is this brightest morning, friends. We on the road with the power of God to move all the thing that was lost. Brothers, restored his back to the church. She's here this morning to manifest the power of God again. Amen. One piece again. Here it says, I believe it's on this road. &gt;&gt; Amen. When the church will be so wrapped in Christ, &gt;&gt; the Holy Spirit, &gt;&gt; mankind so away from themselves, &gt;&gt; he says, and their thoughts move on, &gt;&gt; they refuse the things of the world. &gt;&gt; They just move in the spirit. &gt;&gt; They live in the spirit. &gt;&gt; They walk in the spirit. &gt;&gt; So fulfilling love of Christ. Then the love of Christ, here it is. Now &gt;&gt; it come back. the love of Christ will go forth with the power and deity because deity will be revealed in human beings by the Holy Spirit. We believe this morning, friends, that deity is here. He's in the bride. He's moving to bring it to pass. God bless you this morning as we continue to give God the praise. He's worthy of it. Amen. God bless you this morning. Blessed be his name. You appreciate Norris coming is the old time Holy Spirit and the devils won't go near it. &gt;&gt; That's the reason they bear it. &gt;&gt; But it's good enough for me.

So is your word. But we need the anointing of the Holy Spirit to blend in and become one with this word Lord. So bless everything that will be said and we commit everything into your hands in Jesus precious name we ask it. Amen. And the great church shall say &gt;&gt; I didn't hear that. The great church shall say &gt;&gt; amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God richly bless you. Amen. &gt;&gt; So uh while we standing just two portions of scripture it's uh Hebrews 12 1 and 2 and then Revelations 19:7. If you have it, say amen. Wherefore seen we are compassed about with so great cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight and sin which dot so easily beset us. And let us run with patience the race that is set before us, looking unto Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith. Who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and he sat down at the right hand of the throne of God. &gt;&gt; Isn't that beautiful? &gt;&gt; So, we have to lay aside &gt;&gt; the weight and the sin that bogs us down. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And then we go to Revelations 19:7. Let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him. &gt;&gt; For the marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife has made herself ready. And to her was granted that she uh should be arrayed in fine linen, clean and white, for the linen, fine linen is the righteousness of the saints. Amen. And he says here, "And he said unto me, write blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper of the lamb, and he saith unto me, these are the true saints of God." &gt;&gt; So may he bless the reading of his word. You may be seated. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So uh just reading the scripture brother Benham says that you are blessed just by being called. &gt;&gt; You are blessed just by being called. &gt;&gt; And I believe in this meetings there's almost I won't say it's the final call but it could be the last call &gt;&gt; to individuals. &gt;&gt; And I this morning I want you to know I'm going to preach to individuals. &gt;&gt; Beautiful group, &gt;&gt; beautiful church. Amen. &gt;&gt; Beautiful friends we have in the church &gt;&gt; speaking to individuals this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. So may God bless you. &gt;&gt; I got a title here. The bride has made herself ready. &gt;&gt; Now uh many times we can preach as a brother Norris and I told brother Isaac it's so easy. I have a message lined up here and I was praying till about half three this morning. Lord which way do I go? Because it's easy to say you predestinated your name is in a book. It's easy like that &gt;&gt; and it's it sort of puts a general thing over you and many people feel once I hear that I can just sit back and I don't have to do nothing I'm going to heaven &gt;&gt; but the the Bible says &gt;&gt; now this is a bit different and I want you to listen as an individual &gt;&gt; and I said Lord do I do it so easy to preach a message it just flows and runs &gt;&gt; but to preach this is going to be very hard &gt;&gt; but it's going to make you ready is going to prepare you. &gt;&gt; It's going to do something to the inner man. &gt;&gt; And if you take it, &gt;&gt; you're going to make the rapture. &gt;&gt; Just a little more on the on the on the speakers. Thank you. So, uh, he says here in sudden secret. So, I'm going to float on the coach because I have to preach another me message on Sunday. So, uh, I don't want to get too anointed because then I'll be going down the aisle and if you don't aim in at the back there, I'm going to come shake your hand. So, I need you to preach back to me. &gt;&gt; You know what brother Brandham says? The guy came to the service and he said, "Brother Brandom, I enjoyed your service until that lady screamed and cried." &gt;&gt; He said, "If she didn't do it, I can't preach." &gt;&gt; So, if you don't amen and do that, I can't preach. So you have your part to play. I have my part to play. &gt;&gt; So if you sit there with a long face and folded arms and I get mind battles. &gt;&gt; But when you preach back man kawa preach it then I know I can preach the word. I can say anything I want to. The Holy Spirit will anoint it. [Applause] &gt;&gt; And it we should be matured Christians by now. We long in the message. We don't have to keep saying these things to the people. You should know by now. The preacher, the preacher labored how many hours to study that message. And when he comes and preach it, you sit there and look at him. &gt;&gt; Brother, it should be a shame on you, sister. Shame on you, brother. It should be a place where we say, "Come on, preach it, pastor. I need it. I want it. I need to be right with God." Amen. We tired. We old men. But we can't at this late stage still come and uh beg people to worship, &gt;&gt; beg people to come to church. And you're going to find out this message, if you don't prepare, you're not going to make it for the rapture. [Applause] &gt;&gt; They have to, brother Theo. We have to. &gt;&gt; Sometimes you think it's easy for the preacher. Brother says, "Sometimes it's harder for the preacher than the people in the bench. cuz you don't know what we go through. &gt;&gt; And we can't tell you everything we're going through. &gt;&gt; So what you must do, lift our hands up, man. &gt;&gt; We're tired and weary, but lift our hands up. I'm lifting brother Theo's hands up. I'm keeping it there. He's tired and weary. So am I. And many. But keep the hands up. &gt;&gt; And while the hands is up, Israel won. &gt;&gt; You don't want defeat in the church. keep his hands up and you'll stay in victory. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; So he says he has sudden secret. If that isn't just about the way the world, you may see that he's saying today about the coming of the Lord. Your oldfashioned folky back numbers, what makes you dress and act the way you do? But we're looking for the secret sudden appearing of the Lord. &gt;&gt; For there's something in the air. Listen, &gt;&gt; a message of the Holy Spirit &gt;&gt; that tells us the coming of the Lord is at hand. &gt;&gt; So that's why I say individuals is going to pick it up. There's a message already in the air. &gt;&gt; It's in the air. &gt;&gt; That the coming of the Lord is here. &gt;&gt; Now I'm going to say something. You watch nature. When winter comes, it kills everything. The leaves get dried, falls off. &gt;&gt; But you know what? When summer comes around, there's a silent secret that goes out. &gt;&gt; We don't hear it. But nature hears it. And before you know, here come the leaves. Here come the branches. Here everything. Why? There's a sudden secret message that goes out. And brother Bam says there's a message in the air that the Holy Ghost is telling us the coming of the Lord is here. So, we can't play around. We can't take chances. We can't say, "I'm going back to the world." It's too late. &gt;&gt; Too late. Brother Goi, [Applause] &gt;&gt; Brother Theo, I said at home in my time when I got saved in 1967, &gt;&gt; they did the twist. You know the twist. Then this what they were doing. I said, "If I go back now, they're dancing on the head. How am I going to do that? It's too late to go back. Man, it's easier to go forward because on the other side, they're saying, "Come on. Come on. You're almost home. Keep pressing. Keep going. Keep coming." Listen what he says. You may be seated. What we need today in this pullpit is prophets of the Lord who is not afraid to blast out God's thunderbolts of judgment upon this generation of sinful people that we preach to. We need prophets like Isaiah who cried out a weaker generation how that he did condemn that generation and tell them of the coming judgments. What is it today? That education in societies and little frenentical delicate things of societies, their own feelings has took the place of the Holy Ghost in the church. Watch what we need today is cry out. &gt;&gt; America is a godsend, godful man with the power of the Holy Ghost who is not afraid to cry out against the thing that's wrong and warn the people of oncoming judgment. &gt;&gt; So I'm here to speak to individuals. The coming of the Lord is upon us. The coming of judgment is here. We need to be right with God. We can't wait until this happened. Until that happened. Come and tell you something. You may be seated. &gt;&gt; I was telling the brothers, you know, when you look at the political stage and you look at the world, the stage he said, brother Goki and brother Isaac that everyone was preaching on the pope and things. We preach those years back. &gt;&gt; We knew he's coming out of America. We knew Israel will do that. We knew America will be the image. But now the stage is set. So when we look at the stage, there's Israel. We look at the pope, there's a pope. We look at the Rome, there's Rome, the World Council of Churches. We look at America image of peace, they're there on the stage. We look at Russia on the stage. So when we look at God's stage, &gt;&gt; it's complete. &gt;&gt; Everything is there. &gt;&gt; But brother, I'm not worried about that. You know what I'm worried about? How to go in the rapture? How do we get out of here? This man in Rome is not for me. Russia's not for you. But the rapture is for you. There's a coming of the Lord. And we got to get out of here. And what what prepares you for that is these seven thunders that will show the bride how to go, brother. how to get out of here. That's what I'm interested in. Don't tell me of Rome. Don't tell me of the Pope. Don't tell me of that. Tell me how to get out of here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You may be seated. This the stage is set man. &gt;&gt; So so why must I go back and preach on that? &gt;&gt; We just seen the fulfillment of it. &gt;&gt; So we can say this day the prophecy is fulfilled. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's fulfilled. &gt;&gt; Pop out of America. Russia doing up thing. Israel recognizing the position. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Brim says, "And before he can go back to Israel in his fullness, the Gentile bride must get out of the way." &gt;&gt; So today, you can't keep up the rapture anymore &gt;&gt; because the bride that's elected will make herself ready. &gt;&gt; So you better be sure you're elected. Get sure that and make sure in this meetings, Lord, I want to be right. I don't want to come to another convention and go back and do the same thing. I want to go a changed person filled with the Holy Ghost, anointed with the power of God. Young man, young girl, God has given you another chance. Mother Father, [Applause] &gt;&gt; Brother, I came here to put my shoulder to the wheel to make this thing work, to make the people get ready. The Holy Ghost will make you ready, brother. And if you if you disobedient, he'll bring you to a place &gt;&gt; where you have to heal yourself &gt;&gt; and it might be a hard thing. &gt;&gt; You know what he says? If mother don't want to walk straight, &gt;&gt; he takes the lamb. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And then mama must look up &gt;&gt; cuz God took the lamb. Cuz mama don't want to walk straight. &gt;&gt; It's time we line up, friends. It's later than what we think it is. &gt;&gt; So the Holy Spirit tell us there's something there. What we need today is pulpits. He says the wicked generation. What is it today? Education in all this. We need today a cry. He says I'm not afraid to cry against the thing wrong and warn the people of the oncoming judgment. &gt;&gt; Now you know me. I could have preached a very a positive message but something told me half past 3 this morning. Preach this. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God won't let the church exist long under such conditions. &gt;&gt; And the world is corrupted. Politics is corrupted. The church is corrupted. What we need today is more to do more about it. &gt;&gt; God-fearing people &gt;&gt; to get together and call on the name of the Lord. That's what the brand table needs to do is get together. Listen, get together and call upon the name of the Lord. So when you see these things happen, what do we do? We don't stay away from church, we don't have to beg the people to come. No, you come to church and the pastor calls a prayer meeting. You make sure you're there, brother, because the coming of the Lord is upon us. &gt;&gt; And the bride has made herself ready. &gt;&gt; We're going to find out who's bride and who's not bride, brother. He says you won't let the list Brandon Tabern Tabernacle still on the same compromising preachers. What we need is an oldfashioned God- sent heavenborn preachers who will tell the truth regardless of who it hurts. Like John said, the ax is laid to the root of the tree and every tree that bringeth forth good fruit uh bringeth forth uh fruit is bringeth not forth good fruit. It's yuned down and cast in the fire. We need precious prophets like that who will bombard and use the judgments of God for ammunition to tear out this wicked condition that we living in. And that's how I feel this morning. If you're not living right, the Holy Spirit is here to tear out that condition, break it apart. The judgment of God is here, brother. And I'm using the ammunition from Brother Brenham, &gt;&gt; and the Holy Spirit is here to back it up. And if you don't listen to the Holy Spirit, then you will have to suffer for it. &gt;&gt; But if you listen, my brother, sister, hey, if you listen, my brother, you will win, man. You will go in the rapture. You will be changed. You will be anointed. [Applause] He says you can never r sin by patting it on the back. You can never r sin by educating people. Our programs has become demolished, have failed. There's only one remedy for sin and that is Christ. He's the remedy and not Christ through intellectual confession. And that's what the Holy Spirit is busting. &gt;&gt; Too many people know him by intellect. &gt;&gt; You know him by intellectual &gt;&gt; but nothing in the heart. &gt;&gt; So you come here with your intellectual and say why does he say that? You judging with your intellectual. Judge with your heart and say God is that you speaking to me, not your intellectuals. Your intellectuals will fail, brother. But this can't fail. And if God is speaking to this, you better respond. And if you are living up here, you will walk out of the service and say, I want to have nothing to do with that people. Because you judge it with your intellect. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Hallelujah. Away with that intellectualism. You know, brother, the preachers now want intellect. They give motivational speakers. They give lectures. They don't want noise in the church. Everyone must sit quiet. Nonsense, man. We want God's children to be on fire for God. I'm not here to give a motivational speak. I'm not here to lecture to you, but I'm here to bust that spirit. that spirit that's on you. I'm busting that spirit this morning. Go free, man. &gt;&gt; Tell the devil, I'm free. &gt;&gt; No more are you going to keep me bound. No more are you going to let me be like this. I'm free. [Music] He says, "Listen here, and not Christ through intellectual confession, but through the baptism of the Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; to a new life &gt;&gt; and a a generation that's that uh that that's the only remedy for sin. The only remedy for a nation is the only remedy for this church and all of us. It's the only remedy for the people. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's the only remedy for you that's watching on the line. &gt;&gt; Even my church, if you're watching, it's the only remedy. We can't pat sin on the back. &gt;&gt; But where's Christ? Yes. Grace. He's the only one that can set you free, man. &gt;&gt; Wow. What we need today is is calling together, getting ready, not depending on the preacher. &gt;&gt; And that's a trouble in the church again. We don't come with our own fire. We don't come anointed. The chorus leader must sing us on fire. Brother Theon, Brother Isaac must preach you on fire. Man, you must have your own fire. &gt;&gt; We so long in a message, but we still come get to service. &gt;&gt; You must have your own fire. &gt;&gt; We must not even be able to preach because the place is filled with fire. The glory cloud is all here. &gt;&gt; Come with your own fire. Don't depend on the preacher. depend on yourself. You're an individual. I must be on fire. [Applause] And that depon depending on the preacher, but you as an individual before God, make yourself ready for the coming of the Lord to escape the corruption. &gt;&gt; Now you're going to find out, brother, why are you preaching like this? If you know what is coming, &gt;&gt; you'll be running to this altar &gt;&gt; and laying aside the weight and the sin that has so easily beset you. &gt;&gt; You'll be running away, friend, if you know what is coming. &gt;&gt; Some people say, "Well, I go to church on Sunday morning. I listen to our pastor." Which is fine. Which is fine. A fine preacher. That's good. I appreciate that. And you are in America, the world way over. But takes more than a good message from the pulpit. &gt;&gt; It takes your life. &gt;&gt; It takes you to get ready. &gt;&gt; Did you hear that? So I'm a good Christian. I come to church. I listen to a good sermon. I go back and I feel good. He said, "But that's not it." &gt;&gt; You must have a change of life. &gt;&gt; The life must come into you. It takes a life and it takes you to get ready, brother. Oh guys, can you give me more poo here? &gt;&gt; In Revelations 19th chapter 7 verse the Bible said that speaking of the bride of Christ, she has made herself ready. She made herself ready. And you as a member of the bride, you got to make yourself ready. &gt;&gt; Oh, how many of you all perhaps have read of the virgins? Some are wise and some were foolish. &gt;&gt; Virgin means purity. &gt;&gt; And they were all good people. Now please I want you to listen to this. &gt;&gt; You know the five wise wasn't separate &gt;&gt; and the five foolish wasn't separate. &gt;&gt; They were all in one church. &gt;&gt; So you couldn't say that's foolish, that's wise, that's fool. No, it couldn't. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; They were all in the same church. &gt;&gt; They were all in the message. &gt;&gt; Please listen to this. It says everyone there with them, virgins, sanctified vessels of God. &gt;&gt; But those who had oil in their lamp, listen, they went in. &gt;&gt; The others was left out. &gt;&gt; They were all virgins. Everyone &gt;&gt; people that you couldn't put a finger on &gt;&gt; anything wrong. They everyone believed in the coming of the Lord. Watch. They were ready to go meet him. &gt;&gt; But some of them left. Let the oil go out. &gt;&gt; Oh, please listen, friend. Don't let nothing distract you. &gt;&gt; Don't. He says, "Don't let be don't let that be your case. &gt;&gt; Keep oil in your lamp." What is the oil? The Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit. Never let it drain from you. When you feel your love is dying away, your sincerity to Christ, he says, and quickly go to him who has the fountain of oil to buy for yourself a filling of the Holy Ghost. I say in this meetings if you feel that your oil has drained out no more joy no more happiness no more prayer revail when you feel you're losing that quickly not slowly run to him that has the oil the baptism of the Holy Spirit my my &gt;&gt; glory be to God. &gt;&gt; It says here questions and answers, brothers. When you see the fig tree putting forth their butts, &gt;&gt; it says here &gt;&gt; blessed be the name of the Lord. Okay, it says here every one of them was virgin. &gt;&gt; Don't let it be your case. So I said I'm speaking to individuals. &gt;&gt; So don't let it be your case. Don't say when I'm preaching, oh she needs that or I hope she hears it. &gt;&gt; I hope he heard it. &gt;&gt; No, brother. That's a wrong motive. But did you say Lord what about me? &gt;&gt; Do I have oil in my land? &gt;&gt; So it takes it away from the group. It now puts it on the individual. &gt;&gt; You can't even speak for your wife. &gt;&gt; You can't even speak for your husband. &gt;&gt; You can't speak for your children. &gt;&gt; But you got to have enough oil for yourself. &gt;&gt; And you're going to find out there comes a time when it runs out. Now you can't wait till that time &gt;&gt; because at midnight oh &gt;&gt; something laying here at midnight brother Olu the bridegroom came &gt;&gt; and the shout went out behold the bridegroom cometh &gt;&gt; it was at midnight &gt;&gt; if you go to Egypt when they apply the blood it was at midnight when the death angel sweep into the country I want to tell you friend it's about midnight if you don't have the blood I tell you the Death angel is going to take so many people out. He's already packed out so many people. They don't have joy. They don't have love. They don't have forgiveness. They're walking with malice. They're walking with jealousy. So many things are they already spiritually dead. Nothing can move them. But I'm here to tell you, the Holy Spirit is here. He moves above this man. He moves above me. He can go into your heart. Turn it around, brother. mess up that whole thing and put the Holy Spirit in there. Don't you want that this morning? Don't you want to say, "God, I want to be ready when this thing happened. I don't want to be caught." Not want to be ready, Lord. Did you ever see a wedding? How that bride dresses herself? She prepares. She gets the veil. She gets a dress. She gets all the ornaments. She's ready. Why? Because she's the bride. Amen. &gt;&gt; She makes herself ready for who? For the bridegroom. I want to tell you this bride. Hey, there's something about her. She doesn't care about the world. She doesn't care who's the next president. She's not worried about Mr. Trump. She's not worried what's happening and and the petrol and the inflation. No, she's worried about the husband. When he comes, will I be ready? That's the question, brother. Are you ready for the bridegroom? [Music] [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; He says, "This generation will not pass." &gt;&gt; And look at the coming revival going to the Jews. They're watching for the coming Messiah. If you look now, the Jews, &gt;&gt; they're back in the homeland. They're watching for the coming Messiah &gt;&gt; and the church spiritual, the bride, uh, the virgins with oil in the lambs will go into the wedding supper. So, as they are watching for the bridegroom, so is the gentile bride watching for the Oh, come on now. &gt;&gt; You see, there's the same thing. God can't deal, brother Olu, with the Jews and the Gentiles. So everyone is speaking of the Jewish revival. &gt;&gt; No, brother. They they can't have their revival before we have our revival. So we got a revival before the Jews. And there's only one revival. He promised a seven thunder revival, brother. And that's what the Gentiles is waiting for. That's our expectation. I don't know how you came to this convention, but I came to expect 100fold. I don't know if you brother, you better expect 100fold. I'm going back change. My life mustn't be the same again. Mommy don't have to beat me up to go to church. I'm going to church myself. Mommy don't have to wake you up and say, "Come on, it's church. You have church in your heart." God wakes you up for church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, we must beg people to come to church. &gt;&gt; You're not doing the pastor a favor. &gt;&gt; This is a man and you're going to find out. Oh, I'm getting ahead here and I'm getting anointed. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. I feel the anointing, man. I feel the power of God here. I feel the presence of God. I feel somebody's going to go free. Somebody will break through this morning. Forget about your prestige. Forget who's sitting next to you. Forget I I'm so and so. You nothing, man. I'm nothing. Everyone is nothing. Here's the man that's something. He's the man and we want to please him. [Music] Brother Stephanus, we were read in the quote. Brother Paul says, "If I'm a pleaser of man, then I can't please God." &gt;&gt; So if I come in here and I'm worried I can't say this and I can't say that, then I'm a pleaser of man. But if I'm here to please God, I'm going to say what he put on my heart, brother, because we're not here to please man, brother Theo, and they get fed up for this kind of preaching. Then they leave the church. But that's okay. God will put someone else. He'll raise up a rock. He'll raise someone to take your place. &gt;&gt; You can't bluff God. &gt;&gt; Listen, you can't bluff God. [Applause] God don't need you. We need God. &gt;&gt; He says here 10 virgins church just as I know in the 10 virgins went out to meet the Lord. All sanctified, all holy, every one of them sanctified. Five were diligatory and let their lights go out. Five had oil in the lamps and behold the bridegroom cometh. And the five that had oil in their lamps went into the wedding supper. &gt;&gt; And the others was left outside &gt;&gt; where there was weeping and whailing and nashing of teeth. &gt;&gt; Be ready for you don't know what minute he the Lord comes. &gt;&gt; What is the oil? It represent the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; So this thing is run so close. I mean other quotes are read. He said almost deceive the very elected &gt;&gt; because they come so close until the wedding supper &gt;&gt; brother. They come so close until the wedding supper. &gt;&gt; That's how close they come. &gt;&gt; So they be walking side by side with you all the time. &gt;&gt; But you're going to listen to this. &gt;&gt; Remember the three verses. You could be inspired. Listen, the sleeping virgins, you say, could be inspired by the devil. Absolutely. Still living clear. Yes, sir. Judas did the same thing. Sanctified, preached divine healing, cast out devils. Why? He's just right straight up almost the same thing the rest of them was. But when it came to Pentecost, that's where he showed his colors. He did not receive the Holy Ghost and turn his heels up and deny the Lord Jesus. That's exactly what the church did when it come to Pentecost blessing. They got away from it. And don't you see it in this class? &gt;&gt; He came right until the baptism of the Holy Spirit. And when he had to go to the upper room, you know what he did? He turned his back and he walked away. He walked out. &gt;&gt; But there was Peter who denied the Lord. Hey, on the day of brother &gt;&gt; in the upper room, did he walk back? No. He walked in. He walked in, brother. Even if he was backsliden, it's time to walk in. Don't walk out. Don't leave the message. Don't leave the church. It's time to walk in. Hallelujah. It's time to walk in. Judas walked out, but Peter walked in. And Peter received the Holy Ghost. Filled with the Holy Ghost. He became the speaker on the day of Pentecost, but Judas walked out. And he was anointed and counted part of the disciples. &gt;&gt; Don't you see it class? Yay. The sleeping virgin. This sleeping virgin. Now you want to know what will become of her? &gt;&gt; Is that it? &gt;&gt; One thing I want to explain. What will happen to this churches? &gt;&gt; What will happen to these people who come part of the way with Christ? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. and didn't come or did not go all the way with Christ. &gt;&gt; Here's a big difference. &gt;&gt; That's why it's so hard. You must have discernment. &gt;&gt; They come all the way, &gt;&gt; but not they come some of the way, &gt;&gt; but not all of the way. &gt;&gt; So, this is where you must discern &gt;&gt; and say, "Wait a minute. I I I can't be a foolish virgin. &gt;&gt; Please don't whatever you do, don't be a foolish virgin. &gt;&gt; In Romans 1 uh I believe uh uh Romans 2:22, the Bible said Paul said if the spirit of God is not in you, you are none of gods. &gt;&gt; You belong to an organization but not to God. &gt;&gt; If the spirit of God isn't in you, you're not of God. &gt;&gt; You have to have the spirit of God to be of God. Certainly &gt;&gt; all sanctified but five was wise enough to have wisdom of revelation. Amen. To catch the door to be filled with the spirit. They had oil in their lamps and others had no oil when they were awakened. Why? Here come them up to the them. Now here there says this wise virgins had wisdom of revelation. &gt;&gt; They knew the door is going to close. They knew something is going to happen. But before the door gets close, I'm putting my foot in the door and footsteps are possession. Put your foot in the door until your children comes. Keep your foot in the door until your husband come. Keep your foot in the door. Wisdom of revelation until you're adopted. Until you're full with the Holy Ghost. Until you seal. Keep your foot in the door. Hallelujah. They had wisdom of revelation. Not just revelation. You need wisdom with your revelation. Hallelujah. Amen. Brother Paul, put your foot in the door and your family will come in. My backsliden children. Brother, why are you standing there? I'm waiting for my children. I'm waiting for my grandchildren. The Bible says the promise is for you and your children and your children's children. Come on, brother. Hold your foot in the door. Stand there. Let no one pull your way. Here I stand. [Music] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Stand. Stand. When you done all to stand. Stand. [Music] Hallelujah. Let's give the Lord a praise. Is there a shout in the house? &gt;&gt; Put your foot in there. Keep the door open. They had wisdom of revelation to catch the door. [Applause] [Music] Mama, if your husband don't do it, you put your foot there. Keep it. He will come. The children will come. Hallelujah. Listen young people. If your parents are not saved, stand there. Your parents will come. &gt;&gt; You see, it takes one person. Just one person that can stand for the family. &gt;&gt; And you might be that person. And God is speaking you to this morning. He's warning you, get ready. The rapture's here. prepare. Are you ready, man? If he must come today, are you ready? Are you saying, "Lord, I'm not ready yet because so and so, I still have to." Hey, there's no time. You better fix it up now. If you got malice and hatred, fix it up now. If there's things in the world that bind you, fix it up now. Don't leave the service. Don't leave the service. Don't leave with that in your heart, man. He might come today. And that's why I believe God called these meetings. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Wow. And when they were awakened, &gt;&gt; why here come up them and said, "Now watch. Here come the foolish virgin &gt;&gt; and they come to the wise virgin. Listen what they ask. &gt;&gt; Oh. Oh, give us some of your Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Give me some. &gt;&gt; Now listen. At that time, &gt;&gt; there's no brotherly kindness. &gt;&gt; I only got for me. &gt;&gt; You were in the same service. What did you do? &gt;&gt; Don't say I must have brotherly kindness &gt;&gt; because I only have some for myself. So I want to go and if I give you I can't go. &gt;&gt; So that's going to be a very very tricky time &gt;&gt; and say this church don't have brotherly kindness. Hey, how many service were you in? How many times did God warn you from this pullpit? How many times did God speak to you and you were right in the same service but there were some who was wise that took the oil that fill the lamps. They come every service. They didn't just park. They didn't just sit. They wanted the filling of the Holy Ghost, brother. So that took them all the way to the wedding supper. And brother, when he came there, now they ask of you give us oil. &gt;&gt; Too late. &gt;&gt; Too late, friend. That's why you better pay the warning today. &gt;&gt; If if it's not today, the rest of the ministers take the warning. Don't wait and say we're not sure if which church is right. &gt;&gt; So we'll wait until that happened and then we'll see and then run. Too late. Come and tell you something. &gt;&gt; Noah it rained for 100. You remember I preached for 120 years &gt;&gt; and when he went out God shut the door. Not Noah. &gt;&gt; And everyone was saying when the rain come then we'll run. &gt;&gt; By the time the rain came what happened? The door was shut. &gt;&gt; So, you know, it takes identification now. &gt;&gt; And when they ran and says, "Noah, my mother, Noah, my baby," it was too late. &gt;&gt; God is not going to wait till everyone is married. &gt;&gt; He's not going to wait till everyone has got their degree. He's going to interrupt somebody's program. &gt;&gt; And you better get ready today. Lord, I want to be right because if he interrupts your program today, you must be right. Oh, help us God. Helping Lord Jesus, help us, God. What a day we living in. [Applause] &gt;&gt; You see, there's a thing back home. They say, "No, I don't want to be identified with that group. Maybe he's wrong and I'll identify with this guy. So when the rain comes, we'll run. &gt;&gt; Brother M, it's too late. &gt;&gt; God shut the door. &gt;&gt; Seven days it was shut. Noah was shut in. He couldn't backslide. &gt;&gt; There's going to come a time you can't backslide. God shut the door. &gt;&gt; And he couldn't even go out. &gt;&gt; He couldn't go out and no one could come in. &gt;&gt; And I'm here to tell you, be ready. Get ready, bride. There's coming a time he's going to shut the door. And what does that quote say? He's going to anoint the church at that time. &gt;&gt; He says, "And the Gentiles time will be over. &gt;&gt; The Gentiles is winding up." Friend, if you see it, the Gentiles is winding up. &gt;&gt; How long you going to play church? &gt;&gt; God, help us to make our lives right. &gt;&gt; And not intellectually, but heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. You must have mean headful, heartfelt. &gt;&gt; And if you are head, you know what they say, a corner wheat when the head is full, it bows. &gt;&gt; Very full of themselves. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I want to fire quick here. &gt;&gt; You ready to see this? So listen, what is the answer? Give us some of your oil. Give us some of your Holy Spirit. Give us some. &gt;&gt; And they said, "Sorry, sister. Just got enough for myself. &gt;&gt; I sure ain't got any to spare." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So that's coming a time. &gt;&gt; But it doesn't mean we don't have brother kindness. &gt;&gt; We made use or the bride made use of every service. &gt;&gt; Every service they came to, they didn't just park then. Their mind was somewhere else. &gt;&gt; Oh God, help us. &gt;&gt; Go pray up. Listen, they said go pray up. &gt;&gt; So in other words, the oil that they needed was to go pray up. &gt;&gt; But it was too late to even pray up &gt;&gt; cuz the bridegroom has come and the wise went in and the door was shut. The Bible says, brother Emmy, when they came back, they knocked on the door &gt;&gt; and the door was shut. &gt;&gt; Now you want to wake up when that's there &gt;&gt; and you didn't make ready. You heard the warning of God. &gt;&gt; That's why I pray today. God touch your heart. &gt;&gt; God speak to your heart. &gt;&gt; God come in there and con conflict you and say you can't run this race with that weight. &gt;&gt; You wait down with the staircase of the world. You're trying to run this race and you wait down with every circumstances and you're trying to run but you're making no progress. &gt;&gt; No progress. You're still the same like you were 10 years ago. &gt;&gt; No progress. &gt;&gt; You're still like Yahweh 15 years ago. &gt;&gt; No change, no progress. &gt;&gt; You know the branch, the bride was marching in that vision. Brother Theo onward Christian soldiers, &gt;&gt; brother Olu, they were marching. &gt;&gt; There was progress. They didn't say on the same place. There was progress. &gt;&gt; But you see what has happened in the message. &gt;&gt; There's a thing called mark time. Yes. &gt;&gt; So, you're still marching, &gt;&gt; but you're on the same spot. &gt;&gt; The pastor look at you say, "But this guy's 10 years in the message. He's still on the same spot. &gt;&gt; He's 20 years in the message. He still hasn't paid tithe. &gt;&gt; He's 15 years in the message. He can't come to church." But the bride that's marching, hey, there's progress, brother. They can see, hey, I've gained ground. I gone forward. I'm going to my objective. I'm going in the rapture. I'm laying aside every weight of sin that does not so easily beset me. You make progress. Progress, mother. Progress, young people. That's what the march is. Onward Christian soldiers marching as to war with the cross of Jesus going on before. But my time Isaac. &gt;&gt; Sure. going through the motions and we think you're marching. &gt;&gt; But we spiritual man. We can see. &gt;&gt; We can say marking time. &gt;&gt; We might call you sister Mark time or brother marking time. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And brother Theo didn't ask me to preach. Listen, this is all my notes. Listen, they said go pray up. And while they were gone together, the bride came and they went into the wedding supper and they was left without where they go through the watches. They go through the tribulation. &gt;&gt; Watch just a little couple more verses and you'll see the right thing here. &gt;&gt; Wise virgins. Now listen to this one, brother Theo. This one blows him. Brother Isaac, &gt;&gt; he says here in in 10 virgins, he says, "There's your five wise virgins &gt;&gt; who had oil in their lamps." Watch his next words, "Rapturing faith." &gt;&gt; You mean the wise virgins, &gt;&gt; brother Emmy had had oil in their lamps, &gt;&gt; rapturing faith. &gt;&gt; Now, what gives you rapturing faith? &gt;&gt; Seven fundness. So you mean in their lambs, brother Raymond, that oil that they had was raptured in faith. Yes, my brother. And that took them into the wedding supper. Brother Brandham says a man, a church that has these qualities is a church going in the rapture. An individual that has this is an individual that's going in the rapture. So what do they have in their lamps? Come on now. Preach back, man. Preach back. They had rapturing faith and the seven thunders gives you rapturing faith. Come on my brother, sister. That's what takes you to the wedding supper. That's what takes you in is those seven thunders. Don't refuse the seven thunders. That's the extra oil. [Applause] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Wow. &gt;&gt; Uh can I read it again? There's your five wise virgins who had oil in their lamp, rapturing faith, &gt;&gt; believing all the signs and wonders, prophecies and everything. These five cut out from the remnant was taken away. &gt;&gt; So they had raptured in faith. &gt;&gt; Many churches don't want to pre preach it. &gt;&gt; They feel it's a doctrine. &gt;&gt; It's not a doctrine. It's a life. &gt;&gt; It's a life. Listen, man. &gt;&gt; I said back home, if it's a doctrine that makes you to be like Christ, then I want that doctrine. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Don't give me some uh church theology and some uh motivational speaking. &gt;&gt; Give me something to get me out of here. &gt;&gt; And if that's going to get me out of here, I want it, brother. The bride wants it. That makes you ready for the wedding supper. That takes you in, brother. So, we have to preach it. And here's the quote. They want a quote. Here's the quote. &gt;&gt; The oil in the lambs, brother Goki was raptured in faith. &gt;&gt; And they taking it out of their churches. &gt;&gt; No blood. &gt;&gt; No blood. &gt;&gt; That's why the premises where there's no blood, you know, the enemy can come in anytime he wants to. &gt;&gt; He says, I walk into that church because there's no blood. &gt;&gt; Come on, man. But he has a blood covering over this people. Oh, this morning I see the seven color coat of Joseph hanging over this people, brother. Every demon is running from you, brother. There's no devil can overpower you. There's no demon can take your place. There's no demon can take your name off the book. There's no eraser. There's no bleach. Your name is on the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world. You're going in the rapture. You're keeping your foot in the door. Your family is coming. Your children is coming. Why? You have a wisdom of revelation to get to the door. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Brother Gi, I feel good, man. &gt;&gt; I feel like running. I feel like jumping. My I got to contain myself because I know something is going to happen today. Something is going to happen. The Holy Spirit told me, "Tell them this." And someone is going to examine themselves and say, "I want to be right." You're going to run to the altar. You're going to run and say, "Brother, I want to make it. I don't care about the world. The world is fading, brother. Your money won't help you. Your cars won't help you. Your buildings won't help you. There's one man that will help you. This is the man, Christ Jesus. Hallelujah, brother Charles. He will help you. He will heal you. He will deliver you. He will set you free. He will baptize you with the Holy Ghost and fire. Don't you want this, man? Don't you want to be ready? Say, "God, today I want to be ready. Fill me with the Holy Ghost. Fill me with the power. Fill me with that anointing. Give me the oil that takes me in the rapture, Lord. [Applause] [Music] My my what an anointing here. &gt;&gt; I see individuals taking it. &gt;&gt; Mama don't mark time. &gt;&gt; You know why your children is watching you? &gt;&gt; They see mama does nothing. So the children sit &gt;&gt; cuz mama's sitting. &gt;&gt; And then we wonder why our children backslide because we do nothing. &gt;&gt; They don't amen. &gt;&gt; They don't shout. &gt;&gt; They don't worship God to be an example. &gt;&gt; Someone is watching you. &gt;&gt; That's why you see me. I come down the aisle. I worship. I want the young people to see I worship. &gt;&gt; I don't only Amen. I don't I don't like uh sit there when any minister preach. I'm here down the aisle. I want to show the young people, the ministers. Amen. Also, we Amen, man. We Amen. Preaching, pastor. Preaching, pastor. I need it. I need the warning. I need the correction. I need the blasting. I need the overturning in my life. Preach it. Preach it. Preach it. God need blasters, man. Not compromises. We compromise to keep the church full &gt;&gt; because so and so pays a lot of tithes. [Applause] &gt;&gt; You know what? I better not say it. &gt;&gt; Must I say it? &gt;&gt; You know when there's big tithe payers and the pastor can't see nothing &gt;&gt; because that guy or that woman keeps him the pastor under his thumb. Now he must go and when he comes to that person he's got to make a you &gt;&gt; brother &gt;&gt; I know brother thing is not like that &gt;&gt; tithe or no tithes &gt;&gt; money or no money &gt;&gt; the word of God and this message comes first if I'm a pleaser of man I can't please God but we're here not to please you to please our heavenly father and we preach the word with thunderbolt and Lightning brother blasting that thing. [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; I'm going to close very soon. I don't like to go long. &gt;&gt; He says here Christ is missing. Now you say certain things will take place then it will make it then I'll make ready. He says, "Make ready now." &gt;&gt; Now, you know what's happened in the message? We stand apart now. I know I got a thing with Goki. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So, I'm waiting for him to come. &gt;&gt; He's waiting for me to come &gt;&gt; and nothing happens. &gt;&gt; But we go on like that convention to convention to convention to convention, but nothing is solved. &gt;&gt; Instead of me just going up to brother Goki, say, "Brother Gouki, I love you, man. Forgive me, man, for whatever I said or done. He says, he says to me, &gt;&gt; I love you, pastor, with all my heart. God bless you, my brother. &gt;&gt; You know what it is? It's a time for action, not lip service. A time for action. Love is a word of action, brother Paul. It's a word of action. God didn't say uh uh John 3:16, "For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believed in him will not perish but have life eternal." &gt;&gt; When God said it, did he sit back in heaven? &gt;&gt; What did he do? &gt;&gt; He went into action &gt;&gt; and he came to redeem a bride. You know, we want to see the power of God in church. Make right with one another. Get over jealousy. Get out the malice. Get out the hardness. Come soft. Become sweet. Become loving. Let love take control. Brother, that's easy, man. When you allow God to come in, oh, I must make this illustration, brother Theo. And I'm going to close very soon. Listen to me, people. Watch me. Just watch me for a moment. The Bible says when the enemy comes in like a flood, &gt;&gt; the spirit raises the standard. Right &gt;&gt; now if you stay on the same level &gt;&gt; and someone comes and says something bad it buffets you &gt;&gt; now you human what do you do? You say back poof &gt;&gt; and now you buffeting one another &gt;&gt; left right and center &gt;&gt; but if the spirit raises stand it &gt;&gt; you raise. &gt;&gt; So what happened? You don't stay on their level. &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit told me go higher. Go higher, brother. So no matter what they say, it comes. &gt;&gt; There it goes. Another one says it comes. &gt;&gt; Why? You went higher. &gt;&gt; That's why you got the victory. &gt;&gt; They scandal. They backbite. They stab you in the back. Did it affect you? &gt;&gt; The spirit raised a standard. [Music] goes all the way brother Emmy &gt;&gt; and they can't understand you still standing &gt;&gt; he told John come up high are you John &gt;&gt; come up either &gt;&gt; in this meetings come up either &gt;&gt; and you'll find out no criticism affects you &gt;&gt; what you don't know don't hurt you &gt;&gt; stop letting your ears out what did that pastor say what did that one say and before you know you can't handle it But you know, I made up my mind. I don't need to listen to nobody. &gt;&gt; This bride has got no headquarters. &gt;&gt; We don't have to consult anyone. Can I say this? Can I preach it? No. &gt;&gt; We get our headquarters. This is Christ is our headquarters. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Olu, we hear from him, man. &gt;&gt; He's our headquarters. &gt;&gt; So don't make your ears a rubbish pin, man. That's right. &gt;&gt; Then you can't handle it. And before you know, there's division in the church. &gt;&gt; Did you hear that one? Did you hear that one? Come on. Keep it to yourself. &gt;&gt; I don't even want to hear it. &gt;&gt; Come on. We too far up the road for those childish things. Too far out the road. We must be mature, man. Oh, I like mature people, you know. Baby still need a what you call this? New nappies pumpers nappy nippers. &gt;&gt; Listen man, that time is pass &gt;&gt; that we needed when we start. We had piles and piles of pampers. &gt;&gt; But you know what? We chucked it out. &gt;&gt; So if you're still a baby, you're going to stay messed up. [Applause] I tell you, I'm going by inspiration now. &gt;&gt; If you still want pampers and nappish, &gt;&gt; you you you're going to stay dirty. &gt;&gt; The pastor don't have time for that. &gt;&gt; No sir, &gt;&gt; Isaac, &gt;&gt; they need to grow up. &gt;&gt; When are you going to grow up? We need matured people. &gt;&gt; This bride has made himself ready &gt;&gt; by the stature of a perfect man which is the life of Christ &gt;&gt; manifested in your life. Then your walk is his walk. Your talk is his talk. Your hands is his hands. Your eyes is his eyes. Then in in in uh in uh in Trinidad, there'll be a people that's anointed with a revival. Wherever you walk, angels walk. Wherever you go, the angels of God are with you, brother. Why? You're a son and a daughter of God, and you made yourself ready. &gt;&gt; I better close here. My, there's so much, but it's finally my my. [Applause] Please, please, I want you to listen and I want you now to zero away from who's next to you. I want everyone to stand. Even at the back there, just stand for this moment. I'm busy closing. &gt;&gt; And I want you to examine your own life if Christ will come today. Can you say, "Lord, I can take you right through my house, through every door. I can swing them open. I can swing the kitchen, but there's certain doors we keep closed." &gt;&gt; That mean you're hiding something. &gt;&gt; Now, I got a I got a quote here, brother, over it. He says, you know, uh, he told that young man that proposed, you remember the rancher son, he proposed to that poor girl, &gt;&gt; and he promised he'd come back &gt;&gt; and all the cousins made fun of her. &gt;&gt; But she was getting ready. &gt;&gt; Every penny she had, she bought the dress. She made ready. &gt;&gt; She was so under expectation. &gt;&gt; And they said, "What? Marry you?" &gt;&gt; That church forget it, man. But she made ready. &gt;&gt; You see, we got to make ready. Never mind what we hear &gt;&gt; and what this church is saying about us. We got to make ready. &gt;&gt; You see, that church will go on and you will stuck. &gt;&gt; And if you have unforgiveness, it's like you drinking poison, but you want the next person to die. Really, &gt;&gt; and I'm saying this from a heart to help somebody. &gt;&gt; We can't walk for years with that. &gt;&gt; God help me, man. I'm I'm even becoming emotional. &gt;&gt; We can't. &gt;&gt; If we didn't mature after 10, 20 years, I there's nothing left. I can't say there's 10 years back. when you going to make it ready. &gt;&gt; But I know today there's grace. I can't promise you tomorrow. I know today. &gt;&gt; So I want to close with this. &gt;&gt; Brother B says they went to uh Okay, let me take Aliza quickly. So he had to get the bride for Isaac. &gt;&gt; So he took with him all the garments and everything that she needed that was sent by Isaac. And when he met the damsel Rebecca, they asked, "Are you ready to go?" They said she's of age. Let she speak for herself. &gt;&gt; Now here you got to speak for yourself. &gt;&gt; Her auntie and her uncle wanted to keep her. &gt;&gt; But she says the damsel is of age. Speak for yourself. &gt;&gt; And this morning, speak for yourself. &gt;&gt; I need God. &gt;&gt; I need to be free. Lord, I need to be delivered. &gt;&gt; And she went to meet. And you know how Isaac recognized her? &gt;&gt; By the garments. He sent. &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah. Oh, how will our Isaac know us? By what Eloha brought us, brother. He will recognize this message and he recognize what he sent. That faith, virtue, knowledge, temperance, patience, godliness, the seven funders. He will recognize it. The garment, the wedding garment, the shaw. What brother? She was dressing everything he sent. So when he saw her, he said that's her. What did she do? She made herself ready. &gt;&gt; Come on, church. Don't walk out of here and you don't make yourself ready. &gt;&gt; You might be standing up. &gt;&gt; Brother B says he went to a world show &gt;&gt; and they were standing there and they waited the whole day. They said, "Listen, you got to stay till the evening time." &gt;&gt; Oh, this is beautiful. &gt;&gt; Evening time is Elijah's time. Amen. &gt;&gt; Evening time is a bright age. &gt;&gt; And they say wait till the evening. &gt;&gt; There's going to be a fireworks display. &gt;&gt; And Bible says they waited and they waited and they waited. Now sometimes you have to wait long. &gt;&gt; But don't give up waiting. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Now can you hear me in the back there? Just raise your hand. Thanks. &gt;&gt; So what happened? They wait and brother stand &gt;&gt; and over the loudspeakers yaka voice &gt;&gt; all things are ready &gt;&gt; brother I want to tell you when you look at God's stage all things are ready the pope is on his position Russia's on their position America's on her position Rome is on her position &gt;&gt; everything &gt;&gt; now the same word that hanged over them fulfilled the prophecy Tonight, today, this morning, the same word that hang over them is hanging over you this morning. There's going to be a bride. She'll be without spot or wrinkle. She's chosen of God and she will make ready to be the bridegroom. &gt;&gt; Oh, while you're waiting. And brother says they waited and he says all of a sudden it was like getting dark. It was evening time and they waited for the promise and he the last speaker said he says all things are ready &gt;&gt; he says and the man next to him &gt;&gt; brother says you know in this tabernacle there's a man here &gt;&gt; the Holy Spirit &gt;&gt; you think it's his man &gt;&gt; there's a man here the Holy Spirit &gt;&gt; he says he knows every thought &gt;&gt; he knows what's going through your mind &gt;&gt; he knows if you resisting this message this morning &gt;&gt; and he goes and give report you can't lie.

Oh people, I'm telling you, all things are ready. Let the fire fall. &gt;&gt; Oh church, I want you this moment to close your eyes, raise your hand and say, "Lord, all things are ready. I want to be right with God. I'm not leaving this place." And you say, "Lord, I need I need a touch from God. &gt;&gt; I got to a place I can't go on like this, Lord. I need to be ready with you."
