[0:00] Amen.
[0:00] &gt;&gt; Walking among us.
[0:01] &gt;&gt; Nobody knew. He came with names.
[0:04] &gt;&gt; Had to call Peter come.
[0:05] &gt;&gt; Andrew come.
[0:07] &gt;&gt; Philip come.
[0:08] &gt;&gt; He just called them.
[0:09] &gt;&gt; And they were called to be manifested
[0:11] sons.
[0:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:12] &gt;&gt; They don't know that yet.
[0:14] &gt;&gt; They're just following this man like
[0:15] Messiah.
[0:16] &gt;&gt; They're just following this man with his
[0:17] long gong and this beard.
[0:19] &gt;&gt; He cast in devil and healing the sick.
[0:21] &gt;&gt; And he begin to throw promises over
[0:23] them.
[0:24] &gt;&gt; The same works I do shall you do also.
[0:26] Amen.
[0:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[0:29] &gt;&gt; I will not leave you comfortless.
[0:31] &gt;&gt; I will come to you.
[0:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[0:33] &gt;&gt; Little while the world seeth me no more,
[0:34] but you shall see me.
[0:36] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. If you shall see it in
[0:38] this mountain be moved and no doubt in
[0:40] your heart, you can have what you say
[0:42] because you come from the same source I
[0:44] come from. You come from the same gene
[0:46] germ. You come from the same birth word.
[0:51] [Applause]
[0:54] Then to cap it off in his resurrection
[0:56] ministry, he tell them as my father sent
[0:58] me, so send you. And the father that
[1:01] sent him was in him. So he said, I'm
[1:03] going to be in you. At that day, you
[1:06] going to know I'm in the father, you in
[1:08] me, and I in you. St. John 14:20, he
[1:11] prophesy upon them that the day is
[1:13] coming. They'll move on from partial
[1:15] realization into perfect realization
[1:17] that they will come in that they will
[1:19] know where they come from, where they GO
[1:21] IN. PERFECT REALIZATION COME FROM GOD
[1:24] GOING BACK TO GOD. OH, HALLELUJAH.
[1:27] Praise God. My God. These brothers had
[1:29] no degree. These brothers didn't have
[1:31] education, but they had revelation
[1:34] because when the spirit reveal it to
[1:35] you, brother, it's good as getting
[1:37] whatever. Praise God. It's the greatest
[1:40] thing that could strike your soul. When
[1:42] the spirit break upon you by revelation,
[1:46] [Applause]
[1:49] &gt;&gt; it change the way you dress. IT CHANGE
[1:51] THE WAY YOU LOOK. YOU STOP FOLLOWING
[1:53] PEOPLE AND YOU WILL SEE PEOPLE START TO
[1:55] FOLLOW YOU BECAUSE YOU BECOME PART OF
[1:57] THE BOOK. YOU BECOME PART OF THE CALL OF
[1:59] GOD. GOD USING YOU TO CALL OTHERS, NOT
[2:02] THE DEVIL PULLING YOU OUT,
[2:03] &gt;&gt; BUT YOU PRAISE GOD PULLING OTHERS IN
[2:09] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE OBJECT OF CALLING THESE MEN
[2:11] WHAT I WILL MAKE YOU FISHES OF MEN.
[2:16] &gt;&gt; In other words, in other words, here
[2:18] here what it is. I call you
[2:20] &gt;&gt; because your name is on the book.
[2:21] &gt;&gt; I call you to become a fisherman to call
[2:24] other names in the book.
[2:26] [Applause]
[2:28] So that is how you going TO GET ALL THE
[2:30] SONS together
[2:33] &gt;&gt; because the word has to come from the
[2:35] mouth
[2:36] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE GOD WORD COME FROM HIS MOUTH.
[2:37] LET THERE BE LET THERE BE.
[2:39] &gt;&gt; SO IT HAD TO COME FROM THE MOUTH OF A
[2:40] SON.
[2:41] &gt;&gt; So the son OF GOD COME AND SPOKE. YOU
[2:43] MUST BE BORN AGAIN OF THE WORD AND THE
[2:46] SPIRIT
[2:46] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE ADAM WAS SUPPOSED TO SPEAK TO
[2:48] HIS WIFE
[2:49] &gt;&gt; AND SHE WAS SUPPOSED TO BRING FORTH A
[2:51] SPOKEN WORD SON
[2:52] &gt;&gt; BUT THEY FELL IN THE FLESH AND WENT ON
[2:54] TO SEX. BUT ADAM WAS TO speak and eat,
[2:57] CONCEIVE AND BRING FORTH THE NEXT ADAM.
[3:00] &gt;&gt; JUST LIKE YOUR FATHER,
[3:02] &gt;&gt; SONS OF GOOD,
[3:06] &gt;&gt; BUT WE FELL FROM THAT. BUT WE ARE GOING
[3:09] BACK TO THAT. OH, GIVE THE LORD A SHOUT
[3:12] IN THE HOUSE. WE ARE GOING BACK WHERE WE
[3:14] FELL FROM.
[3:23] DON'T STAY FALLEN. DON'T SIT FALLEN.
[3:26] DON'T SIT IN YOUR SIN. REPENT THIS
[3:29] MORNING.
[3:31] [Applause]
[3:41] &gt;&gt; We're going back.
[3:43] &gt;&gt; Going back.
[3:45] &gt;&gt; Man trying to hold us in church.
[3:47] man trying to churchify us.
[3:50] &gt;&gt; My God.
[3:52] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[3:52] &gt;&gt; Be a nice church member.
[3:54] &gt;&gt; All right.
[3:54] &gt;&gt; And you will make it. That's a lie from
[3:56] the pit of hell.
[3:58] &gt;&gt; Direct.
[4:04] &gt;&gt; Bible says THE KINGDOM OF GOD IS
[4:07] preached
[4:09] &gt;&gt; and every man
[4:13] &gt;&gt; press their way.
[4:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[4:15] &gt;&gt; Into it. Every man. Amen.
[4:16] &gt;&gt; You got to push your way into it.
[4:18] &gt;&gt; You got to press your way for
[4:19] righteousness.
[4:20] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[4:22] &gt;&gt; Resurrection about to take place.
[4:23] &gt;&gt; Some going to resurrect to glory
[4:25] &gt;&gt; and resurrect to shame and contempt.
[4:27] &gt;&gt; And many who turn people to
[4:28] righteousness shall shine as stars.
[4:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Who have you turned to
[4:32] righteousness?
[4:33] &gt;&gt; Who you have encouraged into
[4:34] righteousness? You encourage people to
[4:36] slackness. You encourage people to sin.
[4:39] Shame on you.
[4:40] &gt;&gt; If you encourage people into slackness
[4:41] and sin, don't do that. Encourage others
[4:44] to righteousness. We leave the world to
[4:46] encounter righteousness. We go into a
[4:48] righteous place. We serve in a righteous
[4:50] God. A God who keep his word.
[4:53] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Praise God.
[4:56] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[4:57] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. Praise God.
[5:01] So, let me read this again. The last
[5:02] name goes on that book.
[5:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[5:04] &gt;&gt; Or the last name that's redeemed that
[5:06] was put on that book that settles it. He
[5:08] comes to claim what he's redeemed. It
[5:11] might be a strange time, but Brown. Did
[5:14] you ever think people will go right on
[5:16] preaching? The church will go right on
[5:18] even thinking they're getting people
[5:20] saved. It is too late. Then it's over.
[5:23] &gt;&gt; And the message will go to the totally
[5:25] lost.
[5:26] &gt;&gt; What? Wait a minute. Brother, you mean
[5:27] we have to preach to people who are
[5:29] totally lost.
[5:30] &gt;&gt; Oh yes.
[5:32] &gt;&gt; Once had opportunity to repent, once
[5:34] opportunity to get it straight and
[5:36] rejected it.
[5:37] &gt;&gt; It was done in days of Noah, seven days
[5:39] in the ark. It was done in the days of
[5:41] Sodom preaching to the eternal lost that
[5:43] were in prison that repented not
[5:46] longsuffering and know souls in prison.
[5:48] I hope you're not one of them tonight. A
[5:50] soul in prison.
[5:52] &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah. That the gospel stop
[5:54] having effect upon your life and you
[5:56] figure you're running your own show and
[5:57] you forget God called you out.
[5:59] &gt;&gt; God bless your life. God forgive you.
[6:02] God splash blood upon you. When you look
[6:04] back you this invisible God working
[6:06] around you all the time. But you're
[6:08] you're blinded to see the effect and the
[6:10] power of God's preserving and God's
[6:13] protection.
[6:14] [Music]
[6:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[6:20] &gt;&gt; And I begin to see in my own life. I
[6:22] didn't give myself a vision. God did.
[6:24] &gt;&gt; I don't give myself inspiration. God
[6:25] does.
[6:26] &gt;&gt; All that is God.
[6:28] &gt;&gt; Praise God. What to preach this morning?
[6:29] He give me
[6:31] &gt;&gt; to share this with you. that where we at
[6:33] we coming into the fullness of time
[6:36] &gt;&gt; and we can look forward to see sons of
[6:37] God coming forth
[6:39] &gt;&gt; to be manifested
[6:41] &gt;&gt; not more talkless talk
[6:42] &gt;&gt; more action
[6:44] &gt;&gt; sir
[6:44] &gt;&gt; Satan time for Satan to see some drama
[6:47] &gt;&gt; see all the time in the upper room Satan
[6:49] didn't didn't believe they're coming for
[6:50] &gt;&gt; there was only staging and speaking in
[6:52] tonga in the upper room he said that
[6:54] didn't serve the devil say oh they
[6:56] getting excited glen rest but when Peter
[6:59] &gt;&gt; came to the gate called beautiful
[7:01] &gt;&gt; and the man was laying Yeah.
[7:02] &gt;&gt; And Peter said, "Silver and gold have I
[7:04] none."
[7:04] &gt;&gt; Such as Baram said, "The devil came over
[7:06] and said, "No, we have to stop that."
[7:08] &gt;&gt; That's a manifested son. Now
[7:10] &gt;&gt; that is Jesus reproducing himself.
[7:12] &gt;&gt; You thought Jesus was trouble. Now we
[7:14] have more trouble.
[7:15] &gt;&gt; There was only one Jesus. Now we have a
[7:16] whole bunch of them,
[7:18] &gt;&gt; acting like Jesus, talking like Jesus. A
[7:21] bunch of Jesus.
[7:23] &gt;&gt; Satan recognized his kingdom in trouble
[7:25] &gt;&gt; because JESUS WAS ONE MAN. But it seem
[7:27] he has reproduced himself. It seem like
[7:30] the pillar of fire have divided.
[7:32] &gt;&gt; It seem like EVERYBODY GET THEIR
[7:33] PORTION.
[7:34] &gt;&gt; IT SEEM LIKE THEY GOT THE INHERITANCE
[7:36] AND THEY'RE MOVING OUT WITH IT.
[7:38] &gt;&gt; THEY'RE MOVING OUT WITH IT. THE TOKEN IS
[7:41] PART OF THEM. THEY SHALL LAY HANDS ON
[7:43] THE SICK. THEY DON'T EVEN HAVE TO PRAY
[7:46] JUST TO LAY HANDS ON THE SICK. YOU'RE
[7:48] NOT HEARING WHAT I'M SAYING because the
[7:50] quickening power was all over them. THE
[7:53] QUICKENING POWER GOING TO BE ALL OVER
[7:55] YOU. OH, GIVE THE LORD A SHOUT IN THE
[7:58] HOUSE.
[8:00] [Applause]
[8:06] YOU HEARD THE TESTIMONY. YOU MAY BE
[8:07] SEATED. But Abraham wife have this big
[8:10] tumor, big like a grapefruit showing
[8:12] through her stomach or whatever his
[8:13] things like that. He on the fields
[8:14] preaching. God tell him speak for his
[8:16] wife. He next country
[8:19] &gt;&gt; and he's saying before
[8:21] &gt;&gt; hallelujah
[8:21] &gt;&gt; the doctor's hand touches my wife. She's
[8:24] supposed to want your operation
[8:25] operation. Before the doctor's hand
[8:28] touches my wife, the tumor will go down.
[8:32] &gt;&gt; He's speaking to the tumor. Watch this.
[8:35] &gt;&gt; Time, space,
[8:38] &gt;&gt; distance.
[8:40] &gt;&gt; Can't stop IT, YOU KNOW.
[8:41] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THAT TUMOR is right in next
[8:43] dimension there. That demon, that tumor,
[8:45] that spirit is in the next dimension. So
[8:47] he is talking it right there, you know.
[8:49] &gt;&gt; When he speaking, that demon have to
[8:51] respond, you know. Amen.
[8:54] &gt;&gt; That demon take the exit and get out.
[8:56] She would
[8:58] [Applause]
[8:59] &gt;&gt; be
[9:00] &gt;&gt; healed.
[9:02] &gt;&gt; Before the doctor's HAND COULD TOUCH MY
[9:05] WIFE,
[9:06] &gt;&gt; TUMOR GONE
[9:07] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE A SON SAY GONE.
[9:13] COULD YOU IMAGINE COMING BACK TO THE
[9:15] SPOT WHERE GOD START TO HONOR HIS SON'S
[9:17] WORD
[9:19] [Applause]
[9:22] &gt;&gt; WHEN ELIJAH BELIEVE IT CURSED THE
[9:24] CHILDREN BEARS COME AND EAT THEM. HE
[9:25] said God has to honor his word.
[9:27] &gt;&gt; But a son talking there,
[9:29] &gt;&gt; it's scary.
[9:32] &gt;&gt; That's why he said be careful what you
[9:34] say.
[9:35] &gt;&gt; Power is in your tongue.
[9:37] &gt;&gt; Power of deliverance, power of
[9:38] restoration is in your tongue, in your
[9:40] mouth.
[9:41] &gt;&gt; Be careful what you say.
[9:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. As a man think in his heart,
[9:45] so is he.
[9:46] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. If you think you you're
[9:48] done, you're done.
[9:49] &gt;&gt; If you think you can't make it, you
[9:50] can't make it. You
[9:52] &gt;&gt; think you got to get a victory? You
[9:53] can't get a victory because you that's
[9:55] you.
[9:56] &gt;&gt; them two those those 12 spies come and
[9:58] say we we land is a good land but we
[10:00] can't take it. But have chance in the
[10:01] land they couldn't take it.
[10:03] &gt;&gt; Caleb said we are more than able to take
[10:04] it. Let's go up at once.
[10:06] &gt;&gt; God honored Caleb.
[10:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:07] &gt;&gt; 40 years seeing all his brethren falling
[10:10] one by one and dying. Endless funeral
[10:12] services had to endure all of that. And
[10:15] Caleb and Joshua and a bunch of young
[10:17] people cross over.
[10:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:19] &gt;&gt; To possess that land.
[10:20] &gt;&gt; Yes sir. Okay, I still have to say,
[10:21] "Give me my mountain."
[10:23] &gt;&gt; It's still not easy.
[10:25] &gt;&gt; Mountain not
[10:27] flat.
[10:28] &gt;&gt; Mountain not plain. You have to climb to
[10:30] get where you're going, brother.
[10:32] &gt;&gt; You need strength to climb.
[10:34] &gt;&gt; You need grace to climb.
[10:36] &gt;&gt; Some of you looking tired.
[10:38] &gt;&gt; Hope you're not tired.
[10:40] &gt;&gt; I don't want physically tired, you know,
[10:42] spiritually tired. You can't be tired
[10:44] now. You know, you can't afford to be.
[10:46] &gt;&gt; So, if you lose your teeth, use your
[10:47] gum.
[10:48] &gt;&gt; But you have to climb. Hold yourself up.
[10:51] &gt;&gt; Pull yourself up by your socks.
[10:53] &gt;&gt; But you got to climb. Climb a little
[10:54] higher
[10:56] &gt;&gt; because Jesus is higher. You got to
[10:57] climb a little higher.
[10:58] &gt;&gt; Climb up with faith and virtue and
[11:00] knowledge. You need that temperance,
[11:01] that patience, that gunness. You have to
[11:02] have all seven virtues.
[11:04] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God.
[11:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[11:06] &gt;&gt; My be warned.
[11:08] &gt;&gt; Just don't stand around. Let's do
[11:10] something about it. If we are not right
[11:13] with God, let get right with God. Amen.
[11:17] &gt;&gt; My and this self-sided church needs
[11:20] today to humble itself back again. It
[11:22] got to a place there's no confession.
[11:24] There's no love among the people. It
[11:25] seem like dying daily. Church is cooling
[11:27] off. Everywhere you find revival is
[11:29] over. You find a cooling off. We need a
[11:31] humiliating.
[11:32] &gt;&gt; They asked for a general and got a lamb.
[11:34] God knew what they needed. That's what
[11:36] the world needs today is a savior. A
[11:38] savior to this condition. Something that
[11:40] can hold it together. Not an educated
[11:41] regime. Not some mechanical system. not
[11:44] some educational system. What we need is
[11:46] the power of the Lord Jesus Christ and
[11:49] saving grace back in the church where
[11:51] men and women and girls can be saved.
[11:54] &gt;&gt; Not not you go to church. You are saved.
[11:57] &gt;&gt; So you can tell somebody, "No, I'm not
[11:58] going there. I am saved."
[12:00] &gt;&gt; I'm not going with you to smoke, to
[12:01] drink, to party. I am a saved person.
[12:03] Jesus saved me and I'm grateful to God.
[12:05] &gt;&gt; And the life that I live, I'm not living
[12:07] that life anymore.
[12:09] &gt;&gt; If any of my in Christ is a new
[12:10] creature, is a new creation. I am
[12:12] changed. I am changing. I want something
[12:14] better for my life.
[12:18] [Applause]
[12:22] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory. Hallelujah.
[12:25] &gt;&gt; Could we take some more?
[12:27] &gt;&gt; Hear this one. It may be almost past
[12:30] feeling time.
[12:34] &gt;&gt; Almost past
[12:36] feeling time.
[12:38] Because there will come a time like that
[12:40] when the spirit of God will be retaken
[12:42] from the earth.
[12:45] &gt;&gt; So people can't feel like how they want
[12:47] to feel. Past feeling time. There will
[12:51] be no more. The church will remain a
[12:54] while preaching cause it has to preach
[12:59] to the eternal lost.
[13:02] &gt;&gt; That is just part of the church
[13:04] ministry.
[13:05] &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah. has to preach to the
[13:08] eternal loss. Are you with me this
[13:10] morning?
[13:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:11] &gt;&gt; And if he doesn't cut the work short for
[13:13] elected sake, there is some that's
[13:15] elected to eternal life. We all know
[13:16] that they got eternal life. And if you
[13:18] don't cut it short for their sake, no
[13:20] flesh shall be saved. The world mets a
[13:22] doom every 2,000 years. We know systems
[13:24] that fall apart in the days of Noah, in
[13:26] the days of Christ, and so on. Now the
[13:29] spirit the dynamics of the promised word
[13:32] to drive to get into the church and
[13:35] drive them to Calvary yonder and then to
[13:37] the rapture.
[13:38] &gt;&gt; So he prophesied that the spirit will
[13:40] come to drive us to Calvary.
[13:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:42] &gt;&gt; Where we have a crucifixion with Christ.
[13:44] Isn't that right?
[13:45] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Now you say, "Wait a minute.
[13:48] Now what? The prophets rebuke those
[13:49] women in them days. They call them woman
[13:51] haters." Now wait a minute. You're
[13:52] writing the scriptures down. A woman
[13:54] that lives in worldly pleasure can't be
[13:56] the pleasures of God. So the woman that
[13:58] lives in worldly pleasure is dead while
[14:00] she's living. And that's what the
[14:02] prophet said St. Paul. The woman that
[14:04] lives in this worldly condition is dead
[14:06] while she's living. And if she rejects
[14:08] mercy, she can cross the separating line
[14:11] where there is no place for her no more.
[14:13] And then where is she at? With her
[14:15] painted eyes, her cut here, she crossed
[14:17] the line with nowhere to come back.
[14:19] There's got to be, listen, listen.
[14:22] There's got to be a ministry preached to
[14:24] her. But remember, it's all over. It is
[14:28] done. It's just a haunting. There will
[14:31] be a ministry that will show great signs
[14:33] and wonders. Jo said so. There will be
[14:35] no time for redemption. It's all over.
[14:36] The lamb done took his book. His
[14:38] redeemed is over. As Jesus first
[14:40] preached and was rejected, and then went
[14:42] and haunted those that were there,
[14:44] preached to them that were in prison,
[14:46] could not repent. No time for salvation.
[14:48] That same ministry will have to repeat
[14:50] again.
[14:52] &gt;&gt; What if that could be the third P to the
[14:54] eternal lost? What if it is there? I
[14:57] hope it's not. What if it is? Think of
[14:59] it a minute now. What if it is? God
[15:01] forbid I got children, but it looks
[15:03] pretty close.
[15:05] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Noah's ministry, all
[15:08] ministry done the same. Noah preached
[15:11] exactly went into the ark. Hallelujah.
[15:13] &gt;&gt; And when he went into the ark, there
[15:14] were seven days nothing happened. And
[15:16] the testimony preached to the doom. All
[15:18] right.
[15:19] &gt;&gt; Not by speaking in tongues, not by
[15:21] dancing in the spirit, not by joining
[15:23] church, not by the fruit of the spirit.
[15:25] Watch. But it's the word living.
[15:29] &gt;&gt; There it is. If they only have looked,
[15:30] he was Messiah. He was the living word
[15:33] made manifest.
[15:35] &gt;&gt; You say the church, they'll go right on
[15:36] just the same. But remember all this
[15:38] time, Noah was in the ark. The bride,
[15:40] you compare it now. The bride is sealed
[15:42] with Christ. The last member has been
[15:44] redeemed. The sixth seal produced
[15:47] itself. And we know that the earthquake,
[15:48] we know that judgment. Isn't that right?
[15:50] &gt;&gt; The seventh seal brings him to the
[15:52] earth. Tree is perfection. The ministry
[15:55] comes to perfection when it's reproduced
[15:57] Christ again in natural among human
[16:00] beings. He did not say the ministry come
[16:02] to perfection when the ministry could
[16:03] preach mysteries.
[16:05] &gt;&gt; He said when Christ is reproduced. So
[16:08] somewhere along that line, we've got to
[16:10] see Christ oozing out all our flesh.
[16:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:12] &gt;&gt; We got to see this word become flesh.
[16:14] &gt;&gt; Not talk, not doctrine. And we had THAT
[16:17] FOR 50 YEARS. IT HAS TO BE SOMETHING
[16:19] MORE than that.
[16:20] &gt;&gt; It has to be alive.
[16:22] &gt;&gt; Because that's the thunder that shakes
[16:24] the devil.
[16:25] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God.
[16:27] &gt;&gt; Could you imagine YOU ON YOUR JOB
[16:29] TESTIFYING ABOUT THE love of God?
[16:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[16:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[16:33] &gt;&gt; What female could come around that?
[16:38] &gt;&gt; You're not compromising.
[16:40] &gt;&gt; You're on the word. Your testimony is
[16:41] true.
[16:42] &gt;&gt; You're saying your testimony out.
[16:44] &gt;&gt; I'm a Christian. Yes.
[16:46] &gt;&gt; So then if you say you want to get a
[16:47] drink with us, you know, I said I'm a
[16:49] Christian.
[16:52] &gt;&gt; You didn't say a drinking Christian. I
[16:53] don't have that.
[16:54] &gt;&gt; You have church members to drink.
[16:57] &gt;&gt; I'm a Christian.
[16:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:58] &gt;&gt; I'm a son of God. I'm a daughter of God.
[17:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[17:00] &gt;&gt; You're living for Christ.
[17:03] &gt;&gt; G.
[17:04] &gt;&gt; It's just three things that knock out
[17:06] men, you know. Woman, money, and
[17:07] popularity. Just three. Not a hund of
[17:09] them.
[17:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[17:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:11] &gt;&gt; And all them compared to the lust of the
[17:12] eyes, lust of defection, the pride of
[17:13] life. It's just three things. All men of
[17:16] God through the Bible, three things.
[17:18] &gt;&gt; Woman, money, and popularity.
[17:23] &gt;&gt; They catching money, catching woman.
[17:26] Catching fame.
[17:27] &gt;&gt; Want popular. You want to be looking
[17:29] everywhere. You're looking for selfies
[17:30] or looking for somebody take your
[17:31] picture.
[17:32] &gt;&gt; You're looking out for you.
[17:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[17:35] &gt;&gt; Long as you see that desire cut inside
[17:37] of there. Devil have no room inside of
[17:39] you.
[17:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:41] &gt;&gt; For your purpose in your God. You're not
[17:43] going to fall by no woman.
[17:44] You're going to stay with the word.
[17:46] &gt;&gt; You're going to stay with the word, you
[17:47] not be popular
[17:48] &gt;&gt; because to be popular, you got to
[17:49] compromise.
[17:50] &gt;&gt; You got to please everybody.
[17:53] &gt;&gt; And then you become a dish rag.
[17:55] &gt;&gt; Everybody can wipe the floor with you
[17:57] &gt;&gt; because you're not making no stand. But
[17:59] when you make a stand, people respect
[18:01] you. Not what you're giving to. People
[18:03] respect you for what you stand for.
[18:08] &gt;&gt; I want to say it again. PEOPLE DON'T
[18:10] RESPECT YOU FOR WHAT YOU'RE GIVEN TO.
[18:12] People respect you for what you stand
[18:13] for. What are you standing for?
[18:16] &gt;&gt; What are your principles?
[18:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[18:20] &gt;&gt; And when YOU START TO STAND LIKE THAT,
[18:22] FORGET IT. YOU'RE GOING STRONGER EVERY
[18:24] DAY.
[18:24] &gt;&gt; Because the devil can't get stronger.
[18:26] Don't tell me that.
[18:27] &gt;&gt; You could get stronger. The devil is
[18:28] still the devil.
[18:30] &gt;&gt; He permanently the devil. He can't
[18:32] change. But you are not permanent
[18:36] &gt;&gt; sinner. Permanent church member. know
[18:38] you're growing in grace
[18:40] &gt;&gt; and in knowledge
[18:42] &gt;&gt; every day you're coming closer
[18:44] &gt;&gt; to your fullness of time when you going
[18:47] to be manifested when your life will be
[18:49] confirmed. EVERY DAY YOU'RE GETTING
[18:51] STRONGER. BELIEVE THAT.
[18:53] &gt;&gt; BELIEVE THAT.
[18:54] &gt;&gt; Say every day.
[18:55] &gt;&gt; Every day
[18:56] &gt;&gt; I am GETTING STRONGER.
[18:57] &gt;&gt; SAY IT AGAIN. EVERY DAY
[18:59] &gt;&gt; every day
[18:59] &gt;&gt; I'm getting stronger.
[19:01] &gt;&gt; I'm getting stronger.
[19:01] &gt;&gt; ONE MORE TIME LOUD. EVERY DAY
[19:03] &gt;&gt; EVERY DAY
[19:03] &gt;&gt; I'M GETTING STRONGER.
[19:05] &gt;&gt; Give the Lord some praises.
[19:11] Glory,
[19:13] glory, glory, glory.
[19:19] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[19:21] &gt;&gt; WHAT A BRAND SAID WHEN THE HOLY GHOST
[19:23] COME TO YOU, IT COME like a little
[19:24] light,
[19:25] &gt;&gt; like a button.
[19:26] &gt;&gt; And as you die out,
[19:28] &gt;&gt; as you give up this and give up that,
[19:29] that button, light expands
[19:32] &gt;&gt; to fill your entire being. So the more
[19:34] you GIVE UP THIS, LET GO THIS, THAT
[19:36] LIGHT BEGIN TO EXPAND, take over your
[19:38] mind, take over your spirit, TAKE OVER
[19:41] YOUR DESIRES, TAKE OVER YOUR MOTIVES,
[19:44] TAKE OVER YOUR OBJECTIVES, YOU HAVE THE
[19:46] OBJECTIVES OF GOD, YOU HAVE THE MOTIVES
[19:48] OF GOD, YOU HAVE THE PURPOSE OF GOD,
[19:50] YOU'RE BECOMING THE IMAGE OF GOD BECAUSE
[19:52] THAT LIGHT IS EXPANDING SO MUCH TILL THE
[19:55] LIGHT BEGIN TO OOZE OUT. THEN THAT LIGHT
[19:58] CAST A SHADOW AND PEOPLE WERE HEALED IN
[20:00] PETER'S SHADOW BECAUSE THAT LIGHT WAS IN
[20:03] PETER THROWING THE SHADOW OF GOD. WHEN
[20:05] PETER WALKED OVER THE SICK, THE SICK
[20:07] COULDN'T REMAIN SICK. GOD HELP ME THIS
[20:10] MORNING. DUCK IS COMING BACK.
[20:16] &gt;&gt; USC power yet. Oh, hallelujah.
[20:20] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Glory to God. So,
[20:24] that's what I look at. What is a
[20:26] minister trying to introduce to the
[20:28] people? What is a man focusing on? What
[20:30] is his objective?
[20:32] &gt;&gt; Who is he pointing the people to?
[20:34] Himself, the church, or to Christ?
[20:37] &gt;&gt; Because we supposed to point people to
[20:39] Christ.
[20:40] &gt;&gt; And Christ will point you to the cross
[20:42] &gt;&gt; WHERE YOU DIE.
[20:44] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[20:45] &gt;&gt; EVERYBODY WANT TO GET TO HEAVEN, but
[20:47] nobody want to die. BUT YOU'RE GOING TO
[20:49] DIE.
[20:50] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. TO CROSS JORDAN, YOU'RE
[20:52] GONNA DIE.
[20:52] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. JORDAN WAS THE TYPE THAT HAD
[20:54] TO CROSS OVER TO POSSESS THE LAND.
[20:58] &gt;&gt; Stop using binoculars, looking over
[21:00] Jordan through binoculars, seeing the
[21:02] land long distance. Go where you cross
[21:04] over.
[21:05] &gt;&gt; Cross Jordan
[21:06] &gt;&gt; and face them Hittites. Face them
[21:08] Jebusites. Face them devils out there.
[21:10] Face them personal demons. FACE THE LUST
[21:12] OF THE EYES. FACE THE LUST OF THE FLESH.
[21:14] FACE THE PRIDE OF LIFE. FACE ALL THE
[21:16] DEVIL OUT THERE AND OVERCOME. SAY, "I AM
[21:19] GOING TO OVERCOME. I HAVE TO OVERCOME.
[21:23] Come on, give the LORD A HIGH SHOUT AND
[21:25] ARMS.
[21:26] &gt;&gt; Got to overcome.
[21:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[21:30] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[21:32] &gt;&gt; Overcome Hollywood. Overcome movies.
[21:35] Overcome television. Overcome all these
[21:37] STYLES AND FASHION. FORGET THEM
[21:38] MAGAZINES. DON'T LET THE MAGAZINE
[21:40] DETERMINE YOUR STYLES,
[21:42] [Applause]
[21:43] &gt;&gt; YOUR HAIRSTYLE,
[21:45] YOUR LIFESTYLE. LET THE HOLY GHOST
[21:47] DETERMINE THAT. GET INSPIRED BY GOD.
[21:50] DON'T BE A PHOTOCOPY. BE ORIGINAL.
[21:53] &gt;&gt; OH, HALLELUJAH. Praise God.
[21:56] [Applause]
[22:03] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[22:05] [Applause]
[22:09] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[22:11] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[22:13] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[22:15] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Trees perfection. The
[22:17] ministry comes to perfection when it
[22:19] reproduce Christ again in natural among
[22:23] human beings.
[22:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:25] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Christ being reproduced a
[22:28] longing for the word to become flesh.
[22:31] &gt;&gt; Not the word to become more word and
[22:32] more talk but the word to become flesh
[22:34] in your flesh
[22:36] &gt;&gt; that you could react correctly. You
[22:38] could react like a scripturally. You
[22:40] could react like a true believer like a
[22:41] true son. Not out of order but really in
[22:44] the spirit.
[22:45] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God. Look at Paul. Paul had
[22:47] this demon following him and praise that
[22:48] he couldn't rebuke the spirit until God
[22:50] tell him.
[22:51] &gt;&gt; That's discipline.
[22:53] &gt;&gt; That order spirit's following you. And
[22:56] you can't do anything until God say
[22:57] because he's led by the spirit
[23:00] &gt;&gt; directed by the spirit.
[23:01] &gt;&gt; Look at them two characters want to say
[23:03] come out devil in the name of of Jesus
[23:04] and Paul preaching.
[23:07] They want what power they want to show
[23:08] somebody you have something. Come out
[23:10] devil in the name of Jesus Paul
[23:11] preaching.
[23:13] &gt;&gt; The devil say Paul I know.
[23:15] Peter, I know,
[23:17] &gt;&gt; but who are you?
[23:18] &gt;&gt; Then they jump on him.
[23:20] &gt;&gt; Jump on them.
[23:24] &gt;&gt; Now, what that says, those demons know
[23:26] Peter and Paul.
[23:28] &gt;&gt; They know the Holy Ghost when the man
[23:29] have the Holy Ghost.
[23:35] &gt;&gt; Bible say he suffer no man to do them
[23:37] wrong.
[23:38] &gt;&gt; Saying touch not my anointed,
[23:41] &gt;&gt; I'll do my prophets no harm.
[23:44] God suffered no man to do them wrong.
[23:46] &gt;&gt; While they were few in number,
[23:48] &gt;&gt; he said he while THEY WERE FEW IN
[23:50] NUMBER,
[23:50] &gt;&gt; HE SUFFERED no man to do them wrong.
[23:53] &gt;&gt; My God. God just have a purpose
[23:56] &gt;&gt; that the seeds of the righteous comfort.
[23:59] &gt;&gt; Remember, even though cut short, all no
[24:01] flesh shall be saved.
[24:03] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God. Could we take a little
[24:04] more?
[24:05] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon, I'm praying here in
[24:07] souls in prison. He said, "Lord Jesus,
[24:09] I've done the best I know. I've done all
[24:11] that I know. Grant Lord that the mercy's
[24:13] doors are still open of these hundreds
[24:16] literally hundreds seeking thee at this
[24:17] time. Take away every sinful blood. Take
[24:20] them in today. I plead with all my heart
[24:23] as we see not only somebody talking but
[24:26] scripture itself bringing us to this
[24:28] hour and that vision of a little boy
[24:30] seeing those people in that condition
[24:31] and now think that hell itself mercy
[24:34] have been blotted off from the earth and
[24:36] how hell itself is here and the people
[24:38] Lord are in this hideous condition. He
[24:41] said, "Almighty God, on this elected
[24:43] church, I pray God that you would pour
[24:45] out your blessings that they might
[24:47] receive a ministry of testimony like Lot
[24:50] had, like Noah had, like Jesus had onto
[24:53] the eternal loss. If it be there that
[24:55] they themselves are sealed into the
[24:58] kingdom of God, but giving witness to
[25:00] Jesus Christ being the same yesterday,
[25:02] today, and forever." Oh, blessed be the
[25:05] name of the Lord.
[25:06] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord Jesus. So friends, we
[25:08] coming down to them scriptures
[25:10] &gt;&gt; of him that's filthy be filthy still.
[25:12] &gt;&gt; Righteous righteous still holy holy
[25:14] still.
[25:14] &gt;&gt; And amidst all of that, God promised a
[25:17] message of grace.
[25:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:19] &gt;&gt; In the time of the coming of the
[25:20] headstone. And he said, not by might,
[25:22] not by power, but by my spirit. Isn't
[25:24] that right?
[25:25] &gt;&gt; And that messages of grace coming in the
[25:26] midst of judgment.
[25:28] &gt;&gt; In the midst of judgment, sir,
[25:29] &gt;&gt; God still have grace for your elected
[25:30] ones, your loved ones, the grace of God
[25:32] coming to you. And that's why you should
[25:33] be praising him and worshiping him
[25:35] continually.
[25:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh God, your life is not
[25:38] your own. I sure you have some loved
[25:39] ones. Somebody you're concerned about
[25:40] and burdened about. Praise God. And you
[25:43] could press your way to live for them.
[25:45] &gt;&gt; The woman at the well wasn't ordained to
[25:47] get books and tapes. She was ordained to
[25:48] meet Messiah.
[25:50] &gt;&gt; She ordained to meet the word made
[25:51] flesh. And there are some people not
[25:52] ordained to get books and tapes. They
[25:54] ought to meet you.
[25:55] &gt;&gt; And you becoming a living testimony, a
[25:57] written epistle read and known of all
[25:59] men. Some of the people wouldn't win by
[26:01] a book or or some pamphlet, but you're
[26:03] going to win by your life.
[26:05] &gt;&gt; Now you having a testimony. Isn't that
[26:06] right?
[26:07] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the name of the Lord.
[26:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[26:09] &gt;&gt; What the Bible say, I thought of the
[26:10] grace of God. He's not all. Just back up
[26:12] a little bit here now. He said, Paul
[26:14] said, "Do I speak with tongues of men
[26:15] and angels? Do I have discernment? Do I
[26:18] have gifts? Do I take my goods to feed
[26:19] the poor? Do I can move mountains with
[26:21] faith? Do I have knowledge to understand
[26:22] all things? I am nothing till love comes
[26:25] in, which is grace."
[26:27] &gt;&gt; God has to do it.
[26:29] &gt;&gt; You can do all these things and still be
[26:30] lost. It is grace that saves you.
[26:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. I thought of grace of God how he
[26:37] could do that save to the uttermost and
[26:39] would take a power rest like myself give
[26:40] me the opportunity to preach the gospel
[26:42] to see others saved and see them healed
[26:44] see homes and be broken up straighten up
[26:45] again see lives that have been ruined
[26:48] made right again and to give me grace I
[26:49] said it's amazing grace then come to a
[26:52] degraded low squirrel hun out in the
[26:54] woods form himself into a form of a
[26:55] rainbow which means covenant with a
[26:57] message he g me to preach and formed it
[26:59] here for as a covenant and he's behind
[27:01] it this is the message of Jesus Christ
[27:04] &gt;&gt; oh hallelujah Praise God. In the garden
[27:07] of Eden when Adam was cut off, God grace
[27:09] came down. He cut lamb skin and give
[27:11] them lamb skin to cover them. Isn't that
[27:12] right? Praise the name of the Lord. The
[27:14] grace was promised in the garden of Eden
[27:16] and grace came to Adam and Eve. Nowhere
[27:18] to go, nowhere where to turn. But grace
[27:20] made a way. Let me say this, my sinner
[27:23] friend. You may be here this morning a
[27:24] prostitute. You may be here this morning
[27:26] a woman chaser. You may be here a
[27:28] drunkard, a gambler, a murderer. You
[27:30] might be here an impure husband and
[27:32] impure wife. You might be the violence
[27:34] of sinner. You say, "I'm past that seed
[27:36] of redemption." No, you are not. Or you
[27:37] wouldn't be at church this morning.
[27:39] &gt;&gt; Grace will make a way for you in this
[27:44] dark hour if you will accept it.
[27:48] &gt;&gt; Adam had to be willing to accept it.
[27:51] Stop studying this one do you and this
[27:53] one do you. Forget the others. Forget
[27:55] human. Study what God has already done
[27:57] for you. Study how God put your name on
[28:00] the book. Study the grace of God come
[28:01] into your life. You could be dead a long
[28:03] time ago
[28:04] &gt;&gt; and so can I be myself also.
[28:07] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Hallelujah. Praise
[28:09] God.
[28:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[28:12] &gt;&gt; OH, GLORY TO GOD. SHOUT
[28:15] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE I'M NOT DONE YET.
[28:17] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. I have more fire in this
[28:19] thing in here.
[28:21] &gt;&gt; We now ABOUT TO GET STARTED.
[28:22] &gt;&gt; WE NOW GET INTO THE MESSAGE HERE.
[28:25] &gt;&gt; RIGHT NOW, WE ABOUT TO GET INTO THE
[28:26] MESSAGE.
[28:27] &gt;&gt; All that was a backdrop.
[28:29] &gt;&gt; OH, GLORY TO GOD. BUT WE NOW COME INTO
[28:30] THE FULLNESS OF TIME
[28:32] &gt;&gt; because once you come to your time, your
[28:33] time has come.
[28:34] &gt;&gt; Oh, GLORY TO GOD. PRAISE GOD. YOUR TIME
[28:37] OF FULFILLMENT,
[28:38] &gt;&gt; YOUR TIME OF HARVEST.
[28:40] &gt;&gt; OH, HALLELUJAH. Praise God.
[28:43] &gt;&gt; Put a man. I'm in adoption. The mission
[28:44] of his will according to his good
[28:46] pleasure.
[28:47] &gt;&gt; According to his good pleasure, which he
[28:49] had purposed in himself
[28:52] &gt;&gt; that in the dispensation of the fullness
[28:54] of time, we learn that the fullness of
[28:57] time is waiting for what? the fullness
[28:59] of all time. The time that sin will
[29:01] cease. The time that death will cease.
[29:04] The time that sickness will cease. The
[29:06] time when sin will cease. The time when
[29:08] all the perversion will cease. The time
[29:10] where time itself will cease.
[29:12] &gt;&gt; That is the dispensation of fullness of
[29:14] time by gather together in one all
[29:16] things in Christ.
[29:17] &gt;&gt; Now, so watch. He says, "So I obtain an
[29:19] inheritance. Somebody had to leave you
[29:22] something to inherit it." Is that right?
[29:23] An inheritance. What inheritance do we
[29:25] have? What inheritance did I have? I
[29:27] didn't have any.
[29:29] &gt;&gt; But God left me an inheritance. When he
[29:32] put my name on the lamb's book of life,
[29:36] &gt;&gt; that is when
[29:38] he left you an inheritance.
[29:40] &gt;&gt; So if you believe YOUR NAME IS ON THAT
[29:43] BOOK, YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE ALSO THAT YOU
[29:46] HAVE
[29:47] &gt;&gt; AS OF NOW,
[29:49] &gt;&gt; RIGHT NOW,
[29:50] &gt;&gt; you have
[29:51] &gt;&gt; an inheritance.
[29:56] Come on now.
[29:58] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory. TELL SOMEBODY, I HAVE AN
[30:00] INHERITANCE. TELL SOMEBODY THAT.
[30:03] [Applause]
[30:09] [Applause]
[30:10] [Music]
[30:11] [Applause]
[30:18] [Music]
[30:19] [Applause]
[30:22] [Music]
[30:23] [Applause]
[30:31] [Music]
[30:32] [Applause]
[30:36] What inheritance do we have?
[30:38] &gt;&gt; I didn't have any. Amen.
[30:40] &gt;&gt; But God left me inheritance
[30:43] &gt;&gt; when he put my name in the land book of
[30:45] life
[30:46] &gt;&gt; before the foundation of the world.
[30:48] &gt;&gt; So when he put your name, the
[30:49] inheritance was right next to it.
[30:53] &gt;&gt; And it was sealed
[30:55] &gt;&gt; with seven seals.
[30:59] &gt;&gt; DID YOU HEAR THAT?
[31:01] &gt;&gt; YOUR NAME AND INHERITANCE WAS SEALED
[31:06] WITH SEVEN SEALS. SO WHEN THE SEA IS
[31:08] BROKE, IT BROKE YOUR NAME AND IT BROKE
[31:12] INHERITANCE. IT BROKE YOUR NAME AND IT
[31:15] BROKE WHAT YOU'RE GOING THROUGH.
[31:17] OH, GLORY TO GOD. HALLELUJAH.
[31:22] &gt;&gt; Devil's a liar this morning. THE DEVIL
[31:25] IS A LIAR THIS MORNING. HALLELUJAH. A
[31:27] LIAR EVERY TIME YOU OPEN HIS MOUTH.
[31:30] &gt;&gt; GLORY TO GOD. HALLELUJAH. Praise God.
[31:35] Now you say, "Wait a minute, brother.
[31:36] Jesus did when he died for you. No.
[31:39] Jesus come to purchase that inheritance
[31:41] for me. No. He said now God before the
[31:44] foundation of the world. He said no. We
[31:46] see God was self-existent
[31:48] and there was nothing there.
[31:50] &gt;&gt; So his own self, his own good counsel
[31:54] produced these things that he might
[31:57] through this one man through Christ
[31:59] Jesus gather it up again.
[32:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, if I have a right inheritance
[32:03] of something, if God is knocking on my
[32:05] heart and say, "William Brandom, I
[32:06] called you a long time ago before the
[32:08] foundation of the world to preach the
[32:09] gospel. I have an inheritance of eternal
[32:11] life." God
[32:14] sent Jesus
[32:16] &gt;&gt; to make that inheritance
[32:19] &gt;&gt; real to me.
[32:22] &gt;&gt; So, the inheritance is fixed.
[32:26] &gt;&gt; You can't remember it. AMEN.
[32:28] &gt;&gt; SO HE SENT JESUS TO BEGIN TO UNFOLD THIS
[32:30] BOOK.
[32:32] &gt;&gt; TO MAKE SURE YOU UNDERSTAND THIS IS THE
[32:34] real deal.
[32:36] &gt;&gt; This is the real THING
[32:38] &gt;&gt; THAT YOU'RE GOING BACK
[32:40] &gt;&gt; TO THE MANIFESTATION
[32:41] &gt;&gt; OF YOUR SUNSHIP
[32:43] &gt;&gt; OF YOUR GODSHIP
[32:45] &gt;&gt; OF YOUR INHERITANCE. IT IS REAL.
[32:50] [Music]
[32:55] WATCH.
[32:57] &gt;&gt; God sent Jesus to make the inheritance
[33:00] real to me
[33:01] &gt;&gt; because there was nothing I could do to
[33:02] inherit it.
[33:03] &gt;&gt; It was blank. There's nothing I could
[33:05] do. But in the fullness of time,
[33:08] &gt;&gt; God sent his own good time.
[33:11] &gt;&gt; Jesus the lamb slain from the foundation
[33:13] of the world. His blood was shed.
[33:16] &gt;&gt; Here we go. Are you ready?
[33:17] &gt;&gt; THAT I MIGHT GO BACK TO MY INHERITANCE.
[33:20] AMEN.
[33:23] &gt;&gt; SO HIS BLOOD WAS SHED NOT FOR YOU TO
[33:25] occupy a church pew
[33:26] &gt;&gt; and say I'm a church member. I belong to
[33:29] this tabernacle. That's not what his
[33:30] blood was SHED FOR. HIS BLOOD WAS SHED
[33:32] FOR YOU TO GO BACK TO YOUR INHERITANCE.
[33:35] &gt;&gt; Oh glory to God. GLORY TO GOD. WHAT
[33:39] INHERITANCE? SUNSHIP.
[33:42] &gt;&gt; Good ship.
[33:44] &gt;&gt; THAT'S YOUR INHERITANCE. GOING BACK
[33:46] WHERE YOU COME FROM. AND THE STRONGER
[33:48] you get, the less the devil have
[33:50] anything to do with you.
[33:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God. He said, "Not
[33:53] this bunch."
[33:54] &gt;&gt; Not this people.
[33:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God. You become a
[33:58] dangerous man on the earth.
[33:59] &gt;&gt; You become God's agent.
[34:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[34:04] &gt;&gt; Let's read on.
[34:06] &gt;&gt; Now, this may choke you to death.
[34:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[34:08] &gt;&gt; But did you know that all men that are
[34:11] sons of God are amateur gods?
[34:18] [Applause]
[34:21] God didn't come for you to be more man
[34:23] and you're more man like a star boy.
[34:27] &gt;&gt; You some flash something. God come that
[34:30] you be could become a amateur god.
[34:34] &gt;&gt; A small one of the big one.
[34:38] &gt;&gt; That what Adam was supposed to be
[34:40] &gt;&gt; a small one. So when you pray you
[34:42] supposed to pray with confidence. You
[34:44] supposed to pray with target.
[34:48] &gt;&gt; I thank thee father for that. You always
[34:50] hear me
[34:52] &gt;&gt; but I pray not for my sake but for their
[34:53] sake.
[34:59] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[35:01] &gt;&gt; Disciples even asked Jesus teach us how
[35:03] to pray.
[35:05] &gt;&gt; They know how to pray. How how this
[35:07] fishermanmen what praying?
[35:09] &gt;&gt; They know what the Pharisees praying
[35:11] &gt;&gt; cuz the Pharisees are repeating prayers.
[35:13] prayers of Moses and what them saying
[35:15] their own thing. When Jesus comes to say
[35:17] he said teach them how to pray our
[35:19] father who art in heaven hallowed be thy
[35:20] name and to worship and title them come
[35:22] and what and he run them through the
[35:23] whole prayer and on top that he said I
[35:25] give us this our daily bread.
[35:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:27] &gt;&gt; He start give us daily bread pray give
[35:29] us our daily bread. Lord is our prayer
[35:31] say after I get the bread.
[35:35] &gt;&gt; No adoration and worship and everything
[35:37] else and then we cap it off with
[35:39] forgiveness. forgive us our trespasses
[35:41] as we forgive those who trespass against
[35:44] us.
[35:46] &gt;&gt; Everything inside the prayer,
[35:49] &gt;&gt; faith in their virtue and their
[35:50] knowledge, everything inside that
[35:51] prayer.
[35:52] &gt;&gt; Write up the forgiveness and then thy
[35:54] kingdom come.
[35:58] &gt;&gt; When you can forgive, you're ready for
[35:59] the kingdom to come.
[36:02] Help me preach somebody.
[36:04] [Applause]
[36:07] THAT'S RIGHT. WHEN YOU'RE READY TO
[36:09] FORGIVE, YOU'RE READY FOR the kingdom to
[36:11] come.
[36:12] [Applause]
[36:16] &gt;&gt; How many ever know? How many know Jesus
[36:17] said? So, the Bible said, "Do you not do
[36:19] your not do did not your law say that
[36:22] you are gods
[36:23] and you call them gods?" Which God said
[36:25] in Genesis 2 that they were gods had
[36:27] full domain over the dominion of the
[36:29] world. He gave him dominion over all
[36:31] things. He lost his godship. Speaking
[36:33] about Adam, he lost his sunship. He lost
[36:35] his domain and Satan took it over. But
[36:38] brother, we are waiting for the
[36:42] manifestation of the sons of God
[36:44] &gt;&gt; who will come back and take it over
[36:47] again.
[36:49] &gt;&gt; Waiting for the fullness of time.
[36:53] &gt;&gt; That's my title.
[36:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[36:55] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[36:56] &gt;&gt; WHAT ARE WE WAITING FOR?
[36:58] &gt;&gt; THE FULLNESS OF TIME
[37:00] &gt;&gt; FOR GOD'S SONS
[37:02] &gt;&gt; TO COME back
[37:03] &gt;&gt; when THE P OH, GLORY.
[37:06] &gt;&gt; MY GOD, HELP ME, JESUS. AMEN.
[37:08] &gt;&gt; Let me let me read it back again. This

[37:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[37:12] &gt;&gt; Honey in the honey shop.
[37:14] &gt;&gt; Watch. Waiting for the fullness of time
[37:17] when the pyramid gets to the top.
[37:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:21] &gt;&gt; WHEN THE FULL SONS OF GOD WILL BE
[37:23] MANIFESTED.
[37:25] &gt;&gt; When when when when is the fullness OF
[37:27] TIME? WHEN THIS PYRAMID GETS TO THE TOP?
[37:30] &gt;&gt; FAITH, VIRTUE, KNOWLEDGE. SEVEN CHURCH
[37:33] AGES, SEVEN VIRTUES. Bring the pyramid
[37:36] to the very top. TOP OF BROTHERLY
[37:38] KINDNESS, SPIRIT OF FORGIVENESS, NO
[37:40] ARTS, NO GRUDGES. YOU COULD WALK INTO
[37:42] THE KING'S CHAMBER. IF I PERISH, I
[37:45] PERISH. TIME FOR CHARITY. TIME FOR
[37:47] DYNAMICS. TIME FOR OFFERING MEN WITH
[37:49] FIRE. TIME FOR THE PILLAR OF FIRE. TIME
[37:52] FOR WHERE IS THE LORD? GOD OF ELIJAH.
[37:58] &gt;&gt; OH, glory to God.
[38:01] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[38:02] THE FULLNESS OF TIME
[38:04] &gt;&gt; WHEN THE PYRAMID COMES TO THE TOP.
[38:07] [Applause]
[38:11] &gt;&gt; OH, glory to God. Praise his wonderful
[38:14] name.
[38:15] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[38:17] &gt;&gt; When the full sons of God will be
[38:20] manifested when the power of God will
[38:22] walk out and will take every power that
[38:25] Satan got away from him.
[38:28] &gt;&gt; So, Satan can flick your family with
[38:29] cancer and you take that away. What
[38:32] next? take that away. BLIND IS
[38:35] BLIND. SEE, TAKE THAT AWAY. DEATH,
[38:37] SPEAK, HEAR, DUMB, SPEAK, TAKE THAT
[38:40] AWAY.
[38:42] &gt;&gt; Take it away.
[38:44] AS SICKNESS COME, WE SEND IT BACK.
[38:47] &gt;&gt; AS DISEASE COME, WE SEND IT BACK.
[38:49] &gt;&gt; GLORY to God.
[38:56] Brother said, "Nothing will stop this
[38:58] bride,
[38:59] &gt;&gt; not even death.
[39:01] This bride ordained to be changed and
[39:02] transformed.
[39:03] &gt;&gt; She's walking to the resurrection debt
[39:05] proof.
[39:06] &gt;&gt; We shall be changed. Not even death
[39:07] going to stop this bride.
[39:09] &gt;&gt; No sickness going to stop this bride.
[39:11] The cripples going to walk. The deaf
[39:13] going to be raised up. THE BLIND GOING
[39:15] TO SEE. THE DUMB GOING TO SPEAK. The
[39:18] deaf going to hear. AND THE CHURCH WILL
[39:20] HAVE a revival.
[39:27] &gt;&gt; I'm on expectation for it. AND IT'S JULY
[39:30] HARVEST TIME.
[39:32] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. JANUARY, FEBRUARY, MARCH,
[39:35] APRIL, MAY, JUNE, JULY. ONE DAY, 7
[39:40] MONTHS WILL REPRESENT SEVEN CHURCH AGES.
[39:42] THEN WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A HARVEST. WHAT
[39:45] IF IT'S NOW?
[39:47] &gt;&gt; What if it's you?
[39:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[39:56] &gt;&gt; Fullness of time.
[39:57] &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus. Glory to God.
[40:01] &gt;&gt; When the power of God will walk out
[40:03] &gt;&gt; and will take every power that seal and
[40:05] God away from him.
[40:06] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[40:06] &gt;&gt; All them ministers and preachers that
[40:08] feel they own the people.
[40:09] &gt;&gt; They don't even understand the people
[40:10] don't belong to them.
[40:12] &gt;&gt; But they feel they're married to the
[40:13] people.
[40:13] &gt;&gt; Abraham say the bride should be in the
[40:15] word to know how the reveal word.
[40:17] &gt;&gt; Your husband,
[40:19] &gt;&gt; your husband not the man in the pulpit.
[40:20] &gt;&gt; You're crazy.
[40:22] &gt;&gt; That was taken way out of context.
[40:24] &gt;&gt; Your husband is Christ.
[40:27] &gt;&gt; That's your husband. He looking for a
[40:28] bride.
[40:29] &gt;&gt; That's why he's an ela. Not have a bunch
[40:31] of husbands all around.
[40:32] &gt;&gt; His one husband is Christ.
[40:34] &gt;&gt; He's the head of the body called the
[40:36] church.
[40:36] &gt;&gt; I want to say he is the head.
[40:39] &gt;&gt; The cap.
[40:40] &gt;&gt; The church is the bride's body.
[40:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:42] &gt;&gt; Which is the mystical body of Jesus
[40:44] Christ.
[40:44] &gt;&gt; So you can't fit the bride into one
[40:46] building
[40:46] &gt;&gt; into one country or one language or
[40:48] tongue
[40:49] &gt;&gt; out of many nation, tongues and people
[40:51] all over the world.
[40:52] &gt;&gt; God have a people for his name's sake.
[40:54] this gentile bride
[40:56] &gt;&gt; THAT JESUS CHRIST DIED FOR
[40:58] &gt;&gt; coming to a close
[41:00] &gt;&gt; because we're coming to the top of the
[41:01] pyramid.
[41:02] &gt;&gt; We have more to preach this morning.
[41:04] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God.
[41:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[41:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[41:08] &gt;&gt; WE ARE NOW COMING TO THIS GREAT HIDDEN
[41:10] MYSTERY THAT HAS BEEN HID FROM THE
[41:13] FOUNDATION OF THE world now being
[41:15] revealed to the last days to the sons of
[41:17] God.
[41:18] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. YOU BELIEVE it to be true
[41:20] that the son of God are to be
[41:21] manifested.
[41:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's a hidden mystery.
[41:24] &gt;&gt; Sons of God to be manifested.
[41:26] &gt;&gt; People preachers preaching but we not
[41:27] talking about that. But Abraham was an
[41:29] example son.
[41:31] &gt;&gt; So you can say storm coming and rebuke
[41:33] the storm
[41:34] &gt;&gt; and the sun come and shine for days
[41:36] &gt;&gt; because a son a son of God spoke it.
[41:39] &gt;&gt; Little fish dead in the water. All of a
[41:40] sudden the pill sermon that's not an
[41:42] exhortation. THAT'S A MANIFESTATION.
[41:44] THAT WAS EVENING CHURCH. Oh give the
[41:46] Lord a shout.
[41:49] &gt;&gt; GLORY. GLORY. IT WASN'T EVEN IN CHURCH,
[41:52] IT DON'T HAVE TO BE IN CHURCH.
[41:54] &gt;&gt; GLORY TO GOD.
[41:56] &gt;&gt; YOU COME IN CHURCH, YOU GET EQUIPPED.
[41:57] You come in church, you get empowered.
[41:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[42:00] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Hallelujah.
[42:02] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. What is manifestation?
[42:05] Making known. Oh, glory to God. And as
[42:08] we grow from Lutheran age, Baptist age,
[42:11] Methodist age, Pentecostal age, we are
[42:13] right up to the capp stone, waiting,
[42:16] longing for that captain stone to set
[42:17] down in the building. The Bible said
[42:19] we're living in the last days, the top
[42:20] of the pyramid, the crossfishes of
[42:22] cancer age. Coming the time of Leo the
[42:24] lion. Oh my, where are we at? We are the
[42:28] right watch. We are coming at the
[42:32] the time of the coming of Leo the lion,
[42:34] the captain stone. So that's why when
[42:36] the thunders came, the land roar,
[42:39] &gt;&gt; it was the end of time. Amen.
[42:41] &gt;&gt; That's why when the angel swore, time
[42:42] shall be no longer.
[42:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:44] &gt;&gt; It was time itself runs out. Amen.
[42:45] &gt;&gt; But in the days of the voice of the
[42:47] seventh angel, he's coming. Behold, I
[42:49] send Elijah watch before the terrible
[42:51] day of the Lord.
[42:52] &gt;&gt; So Elijah come to close off the age.
[42:55] Introduce a bright age. Amen.
[42:56] &gt;&gt; Where is a short time?
[42:57] &gt;&gt; This age is one of the shortest age.
[43:00] &gt;&gt; A short time
[43:01] &gt;&gt; because they getting darker and darker
[43:02] and darker
[43:03] &gt;&gt; according to the prophecy of Isaiah.
[43:05] Gross darkness cover the earth.
[43:07] &gt;&gt; Go around put by faith a little light to
[43:08] represent you.
[43:10] &gt;&gt; The bright coming forth. Remember all
[43:12] the homosexuals, all the sodommites,
[43:14] they're increasing in strength and
[43:15] power. They're growing in recognition
[43:17] and everything else. They're legalizing
[43:19] them and everything else. All that is a
[43:21] sign. The Bible said nothing happened
[43:22] yet until the iniquities of the Amorites
[43:25] are full. So God waiting until the cup
[43:27] full to make his move. He waiting for
[43:29] you to make your move. To make it to
[43:30] make his move.
[43:32] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Everything have to have its
[43:34] place. Sodomites have to have his place.
[43:36] Lot the lukewarm church member have his
[43:38] place. And Abraham the elect WITH THE
[43:40] ANGEL HAVE TO have his place also.
[43:45] &gt;&gt; Do you SEE IT?
[43:47] &gt;&gt; SODOM CONDITION RETURN
[43:49] &gt;&gt; AS prophesied as was days of Noah.
[43:52] &gt;&gt; Oh glory to God. So we are back in
[43:54] Noah's day.
[43:55] &gt;&gt; We are back in those days.
[43:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[43:57] &gt;&gt; The spirit that was back there is back
[43:58] here
[43:59] &gt;&gt; and they having a time.
[44:01] &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah.
[44:03] &gt;&gt; My God. So we in the days of the capp
[44:06] stone in the days of the manifestation
[44:08] of the sons of God we are right at the
[44:10] end time. You believe in dispensations
[44:12] Bible said in dispensation of the
[44:13] fullness of time. What is the fullness
[44:16] of time? There have been dispensation of
[44:18] the Mosaic law, dispensation of John the
[44:20] Baptist. There was the dispensation of
[44:22] Christ. There's a dispensation of church
[44:24] organization. There's a dispensation of
[44:26] the of the Holy Spirit. Now is the
[44:28] dispensation of adoption. What the world
[44:31] is waiting and groaning. When the
[44:34] fullness of time comes, when the
[44:36] dispensation of the fullness of time,
[44:38] what is the fullness of time? When the
[44:39] dead rises,
[44:40] &gt;&gt; when the sickness ceases, when all the
[44:42] earth ceases to grown, the fullness of
[44:44] the dispensation of time. Tell me, my
[44:47] brother, when was there a time that the
[44:49] sons of God was to be manifested outside
[44:51] of this time? Now when there was a time
[44:53] in history that this was a manifestation
[44:55] the time to deliver all nature nature
[44:58] itself is groaning waiting for the time
[45:01] of the manifestation which I believe
[45:02] will be in the fullness
[45:04] &gt;&gt; of time.
[45:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:05] &gt;&gt; Now all things have been brought coming
[45:06] up chap to headstone to the
[45:08] manifestation of sons of God coming
[45:10] back. Here we go. Are you ready?
[45:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:12] &gt;&gt; The spirit of God coming into these men
[45:15] so perfectly.
[45:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. until their ministry will be so
[45:21] close like Christ till it will join him
[45:25] and the church together.
[45:27] &gt;&gt; This have nothing to do with this pastor
[45:28] fighting this pastor, this church
[45:30] fighting this church group and church
[45:31] war, which is foolishness, which is all
[45:33] over the message. We're not talking
[45:34] about that.
[45:35] &gt;&gt; We're talking about the ministry
[45:36] becoming so much like Christ.
[45:38] &gt;&gt; Not so much like a politician.
[45:40] &gt;&gt; No, so much evil
[45:42] &gt;&gt; and sewing down the people with nasty
[45:43] seeds. Not that. That's not Christ.
[45:46] Amen.
[45:47] &gt;&gt; That is human.
[45:48] &gt;&gt; That is natural. Okay. The spirit of God
[45:52] coming into these men so perfectly until
[45:55] their ministry will be so close like
[45:57] Christ till we join him and the church
[45:59] together.
[46:00] &gt;&gt; The church. Are you ready?
[46:02] &gt;&gt; Throw in the next gear. We got to go
[46:04] now. I can't finish it right now.
[46:06] &gt;&gt; This is the last before the con
[46:07] convention and we have no communion
[46:08] service next
[46:10] &gt;&gt; this evening. So it's one service.
[46:12] &gt;&gt; So we making a combine.
[46:14] &gt;&gt; All right. The church, the church is
[46:17] supposed to be predestinated into into
[46:19] the adoption of children where God can
[46:21] take a man and adopt him into the family
[46:24] and give him something.
[46:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:27] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that?
[46:28] &gt;&gt; God could adopt a man and give him
[46:30] something.
[46:33] &gt;&gt; God could adopt Anthony O'Brien here,
[46:35] brother Anthony, and give him something.
[46:40] &gt;&gt; What's the first thing you do? Not the
[46:41] second or third. The first thing to do,
[46:42] he said the first thing try that
[46:48] &gt;&gt; see if it's right.
[46:49] &gt;&gt; So my brother get some kind of power
[46:51] whatnot and he come and my job is to
[46:54] &gt;&gt; try that.
[46:55] &gt;&gt; And if he don't want me to try it, we
[46:57] know something little wrong.
[47:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:01] &gt;&gt; So I say come, bring it, bring it, bring
[47:03] it, bring it,
[47:04] &gt;&gt; bring it and come bring it to the pastor
[47:07] and come.
[47:08] &gt;&gt; He said I'm not bringing it. Go with it.
[47:12] Wherever it come from, go back with it.
[47:15] &gt;&gt; Because if you have it and it right,
[47:16] you're not afraid to bring it and come.
[47:18] &gt;&gt; When the Lord tell me, don't tell nobody
[47:20] about it.
[47:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[47:21] &gt;&gt; Go back with it.
[47:23] &gt;&gt; Lord, I tell you that, brother. He said,
[47:24] bring it and come.
[47:26] &gt;&gt; That's the authority to try it first.
[47:29] &gt;&gt; Let's continue.
[47:30] &gt;&gt; See if it is right.
[47:32] &gt;&gt; If it is right, we thank God for it.
[47:34] Move right with it.
[47:36] &gt;&gt; But we have to try it. So any minister
[47:39] say you have to take it and and rebuke
[47:40] you because you you're questioning me.
[47:43] You're questioning me. Yes, I'm
[47:44] questioning you.
[47:46] &gt;&gt; Don't question me. Don't question me.
[47:47] What do you mean don't question me? Is
[47:48] it the word of Pentecostal age? You know
[47:51] &gt;&gt; this is sharp like a razor. You know I
[47:53] am here not only to question but to
[47:55] challenge you. AMEN.
[47:57] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE PAUL SAID, "IF a angel come from
[47:59] heaven,
[47:59] &gt;&gt; marches from the pulpit,
[48:01] &gt;&gt; IF A ANGEL COME FROM HEAVEN AND preach
[48:04] any other gospel,
[48:06] &gt;&gt; crack the box shuttle,
[48:08] &gt;&gt; let him be accursed."
[48:11] &gt;&gt; Don't even question him. Just crack and
[48:13] shoot, you know.
[48:15] &gt;&gt; Oh, because that DEMON WANT TO DESTROY
[48:17] YOU
[48:18] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THAT WORD IS DESTRUCTIVE.
[48:21] &gt;&gt; A FALSE TEACHING, FALSE DOCTRINE IS
[48:23] DESTRUCTIVE. YEAH,
[48:24] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT THE DEVIL INTRODUCED IN THE
[48:26] GARDEN OF EDEN.
[48:27] &gt;&gt; YEAH, GOD SAID YOU SHALL NOT SURELY DIE.
[48:29] GOD DID NOT SAY THAT.
[48:31] &gt;&gt; GOD SAID YOU SHALL SURELY DIE.
[48:33] &gt;&gt; DEVIL TWISTED. DON'T LET THE DEVIL TWIST
[48:35] NO WORD. WE COME TOO FAR TO TURN BACK
[48:37] NOW.
[48:41] &gt;&gt; WE COME TOO FAR TO BRING STRANGE FIRES.
[48:45] [Applause]
[48:48] &gt;&gt; Too far to bring some offering of
[48:49] strange fire.
[48:51] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[48:53] So, so watch now. Watch this man claim a
[48:56] certain thing. Try it. See if it's
[48:57] right. If it's right, move right with it
[48:58] and say, "Lord, send us something else."
[49:00] Keep moving on. Watch until everything
[49:02] take its place. Every fellow take his
[49:04] place. That is when the Philistines go
[49:05] to backing up. Shorts will go off. Hair
[49:07] will go down. Face will be washed.
[49:09] Single will be missing. That's right.
[49:10] When the church begins to get into his
[49:13] mighty power, when they'll have a nasty
[49:15] safar few of them, you will see that
[49:17] holy church stand together in its power
[49:20] positionally placed as sons of God
[49:22] adopted into the family of God. POWERFUL
[49:25] CHURCH STANDING THERE.
[49:26] &gt;&gt; That is what he's coming for.
[49:29] &gt;&gt; What he's coming for a powerful church.
[49:31] &gt;&gt; Not no flimsy church. Not no wimpest
[49:33] church. Not no cified church. A powerful
[49:36] church. Amen.
[49:37] &gt;&gt; Man and woman know how to pray,
[49:39] &gt;&gt; know how to call upon God, know to shake
[49:41] themselves and get out of the way.
[49:42] &gt;&gt; That's a real gift when you could get
[49:44] out of the way.
[49:45] &gt;&gt; Oh my. He said, "Look, I'm going to skip
[49:47] here. We should be so on fire for God.
[49:49] We should be going day and night.
[49:51] Nothing should be able to stop us. We
[49:53] should be so sweet, so pleasant, so
[49:56] kind, so Christlike in our lives. It
[49:59] takes an everyday life."
[50:01] &gt;&gt; Let's take these three words again.
[50:03] &gt;&gt; So sweet.
[50:09] I hear that they're like 116. Amen.
[50:13] &gt;&gt; Sweet.
[50:15] &gt;&gt; After service, I'll give you the honey.
[50:18] Take take two dose. Drink it and go make
[50:20] it sweet. But that's how you have to be.
[50:23] So sweet.
[50:24] &gt;&gt; So pleasant.
[50:25] &gt;&gt; There are some people so unpleasant.
[50:28] They look unpleasant. They carry the
[50:29] self unpleasant. The way they look, you
[50:32] want to talk to them. They're so
[50:33] unpleasant. A smile has go a long way,
[50:35] you know.
[50:36] &gt;&gt; I hear that better the be muscles. It's
[50:37] easier to smile and to frown. You take
[50:39] the pressure to frown, you know. So you
[50:41] pushing a hard face because you won't
[50:42] talk to you and what. But if you ease up
[50:44] on things, it will ease your stress when
[50:46] you smile.
[50:47] &gt;&gt; It's a healthy thing to smile, you know.
[50:49] You don't know you light up somebody
[50:51] day, you know.
[50:52] &gt;&gt; Beam them smile.
[50:54] &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah. Praise God.
[50:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God. Remember when I
[51:00] come back my grandson Grace and I knock
[51:02] on the door and knock on the door and he
[51:04] be there looking forward and he be
[51:06] smile. He know his mother going to open
[51:07] that door and when she open that door he
[51:09] just beam that smile. She has to smile.
[51:12] &gt;&gt; He is waiting with that smile. He's
[51:13] waiting. He's just waiting expectation
[51:15] with that smile. That's why you must
[51:16] come to service
[51:18] &gt;&gt; under a smile of worship, a thanksgiving
[51:20] to God, a gratefulness and whatn not.
[51:23] You don't come back. You come with your
[51:24] shoulders hope like that. You come you
[51:26] raise back. You shake back your
[51:27] shoulders. This is the place to ease the
[51:29] pressure.
[51:31] &gt;&gt; Don't come here to get pressure. Please,
[51:32] please stay home. Stay back. Go back.
[51:37] &gt;&gt; Here's the place to ease tension.
[51:40] &gt;&gt; Like a back boat. Here's the place of
[51:42] easy tension.
[51:43] &gt;&gt; Pressure you pressing your job. Pressure
[51:45] when you come here. Oh my. So good to be
[51:49] here. Hallelujah. Isn't Jesus sweet,
[51:52] sweet, sweet? You can make a song on
[51:54] that one. Jesus so sweet. How sweet
[51:56] song. Hallelujah. Why? You're coming to
[51:59] worship God. Praise God. And God could
[52:01] say in heaven, "Look at my people down
[52:02] there. They're under trials. They're not
[52:04] testing, but they're worshiping me. They
[52:05] love me. I have to do something for
[52:07] them. I have to bless them. My God, look
[52:09] how they love me. I send them some
[52:11] through the waters. I send some through
[52:12] the flood. I send some through the fire.
[52:14] But all them come through the blood. But
[52:16] look at them. All them praising me. Some
[52:17] in the lion's den. Some the fiery
[52:19] furnace. Some through high trials. Some
[52:21] lose this and lose that. But they love
[52:22] me anyhow." Oh, hallelujah. Praise God.
[52:26] then become a love of fear. Then you
[52:28] have no fear in your spirit and your
[52:29] heart for the future. You're not living
[52:31] by anxiety. You're not living biting
[52:32] your nails. You have confidence in your
[52:34] God. He brought you out all these years.
[52:36] He took you through up the mountain down
[52:38] the valley. When you was in a hell hole,
[52:40] he pulled you out your hell hole. He set
[52:42] your foot upon a rock. He deliver you
[52:43] from this. He deliver from that. Oh,
[52:45] praise God. Hallelujah. You deliver one
[52:47] child. One child get back bound. He
[52:49] deliver next child. Praise God. But he's
[52:51] showing you that he could deliver. YOU
[52:53] YOU YOU had testimony before. You see
[52:55] the power of God come upon them. If it
[52:57] come upon once, it could come back
[52:58] again. Come on. If it hit you once, it
[53:00] can hit you again. COME ON, SAY AMEN,
[53:03] SOMEBODY.
[53:05] &gt;&gt; IF FIRE STRUCK YOU BEFORE, IT COULD
[53:06] STRIKE YOU AGAIN.
[53:12] &gt;&gt; It takes a everyday life to have this
[53:14] kind of life.
[53:15] &gt;&gt; Not a Sunday life, a everyday life to
[53:17] pressing your way as a Christian. God is
[53:20] calling his children aside by
[53:23] manifestation. Amen.
[53:24] &gt;&gt; They don't have to say one word about
[53:26] it.
[53:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:27] &gt;&gt; No paper testimony necessary.
[53:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:34] &gt;&gt; So kind, so Christlike, God calling his
[53:38] children aside by manifestation. They
[53:40] don't have to say one word about it. You
[53:41] see something happen positionally placed
[53:43] sons of God. God getting into him into
[53:46] order exactly with the same thing. And
[53:48] he just has as much authority. His word
[53:50] is just as good as an archangel. Even
[53:53] better. The son was adopted, put on a
[53:55] high place, set out there, change his
[53:57] robes, change his colors. The father of
[53:59] ceremony. This is my son from
[54:01] henceforth. He's governor. He's ruler.
[54:03] He's over all my heritage. All I have
[54:06] belongs to him.
[54:07] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God. That's the reason the
[54:09] coming of the seals. At the finishing of
[54:12] the seventh seal,
[54:13] &gt;&gt; the mystery of God should be finished to
[54:15] know who God is, what he is, how he
[54:18] lives, his nature, his being. You are
[54:21] supposed to be all the way up there by
[54:23] that time
[54:25] &gt;&gt; to bring us into the full stature of the
[54:27] sons of daughters of God.
[54:29] &gt;&gt; Can you come right back to the mystery
[54:30] of the seventh seal and under the
[54:32] seventh seal have seven thunders and he
[54:34] said WE SUPPOSED TO BE ALL THE WAY UP
[54:36] THERE BY THAT TIME. ALL THEM VIRTUES
[54:38] supposed to be in there BY THAT TIME.
[54:40] WHAT TIME? THE FULLNESS OF TIME.
[54:42] &gt;&gt; And when the FULLNESS TIME HAVE COME,
[54:44] IT'S TIME TO SEE THE manifestation
[54:46] &gt;&gt; of the sons of God.
[54:48] &gt;&gt; We are waiting on it. Hallelujah.
[54:49] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Hallelujah. Praise be
[54:52] to Jesus.
[54:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[54:55] &gt;&gt; Seventh seal, brother now for the end
[54:57] time message.
[54:59] This seal.
[55:00] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[55:00] &gt;&gt; He revealed all the six seals. But he
[55:03] don't say nothing about the seventh.
[55:05] &gt;&gt; So the seventh seal is for the end
[55:08] message.
[55:11] &gt;&gt; First four seals history also. Fifth
[55:13] seal ses on the altar. Fourth seal be
[55:16] system and so on. Sixth seal earthquake.
[55:18] Seven seal silence.
[55:22] &gt;&gt; It don't say nothing about the seventh
[55:23] seal, but the end time seal when it
[55:26] starts
[55:26] &gt;&gt; will be a total secret.
[55:28] &gt;&gt; Only when it starts,
[55:30] &gt;&gt; but at the finishing,
[55:31] &gt;&gt; we just read that
[55:32] &gt;&gt; you're supposed to be way up the road.
[55:34] Now,
[55:35] &gt;&gt; all faith and virtue, knowledge, and
[55:36] temperance at the finishing.
[55:37] &gt;&gt; What is this for? The top of the
[55:39] pyramid.
[55:40] &gt;&gt; When the pyramid comes to it stop,
[55:42] &gt;&gt; we are at the end time, the opening of
[55:44] the seventh seal.
[55:45] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. So when he made man a
[55:48] god, he gave him a domain. As the domain
[55:50] goes from sea to sea, from shore to
[55:52] shore, he had control over it. And Jesus
[55:54] came being the one without sin. He
[55:56] proved it. When the winds blowed, he
[55:58] said, "Peace be still."
[55:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[55:59] &gt;&gt; So it was more than talk. He proved it
[56:01] by manifestation.
[56:02] &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? Then he said, "If you
[56:04] shall say to this mountain, be moved.
[56:05] Don't doubt you shall have what you
[56:06] says." So go back to Genesis. Now the
[56:09] world and nature is groaning, moving for
[56:11] what? For the manifestation of the sons
[56:13] of God. When true sons, born sons, fil
[56:15] sons speak and their word is backed. I
[56:17] believe on the it's on the bord of it.
[56:19] Now say this mountain and brother desire
[56:22] so and so I give it to you in the name
[56:24] of Jesus Christ.
[56:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:25] &gt;&gt; Oh praise God.
[56:27] &gt;&gt; From future home I'm almost done. Now in
[56:29] Ephesians 1:10 he said you put it down.
[56:31] It's called the fullness of time. It's
[56:33] it's called not the seven days. It's
[56:34] called the fullness of time. When the
[56:36] fullness of time has come when time has
[56:39] been fulfilled when there is no more
[56:40] time then you go into eternity. After
[56:43] the seven church age is over, Luther's
[56:45] age is over, Methodist is over,
[56:47] Pentecostal age is over. Now you're
[56:49] going to what? Eternity. No more
[56:51] servants, no more trees, no more other
[56:52] than eternity. Oh my. That is where the
[56:55] fullness time is at. Give me a church.
[56:57] Oh, we said that. Oh, praise God.
[56:59] Hallelujah. Blessed be the name of the
[57:02] Lord.
[57:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[57:03] &gt;&gt; Praise God. So this coming of the stone,
[57:05] I'm going to close up music, please. The
[57:07] coming of the stone upr glory because it
[57:10] ended the gentile dispensation. God
[57:13] ended it up with the coming of that
[57:15] stone. So friends, the coming of the
[57:17] capstone ends this gentile dispensation.
[57:20] &gt;&gt; And the capstone is in two parts.
[57:22] Revelation and manifestation. Oh, I'll
[57:25] close with this. Hallelujah.
[57:28] &gt;&gt; My my my my
[57:31] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God.
[57:33] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[57:35] &gt;&gt; Jesus. Praise God.
[57:37] &gt;&gt; Let the worshippers arise.
[57:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[57:42] &gt;&gt; And the only way, okay, Jesus said the
[57:45] message is to go to all the world. Then
[57:47] at the end shall be after this message
[57:49] go to all the world. And the only way
[57:53] that God can preach the gospel today is
[57:56] through that lump of clay.
[57:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[58:01] &gt;&gt; So God can't preach the gospel through
[58:02] mechanical tape. He had to preach it
[58:04] through lumps of clay, dust, men. And
[58:07] that's the reason you sick people had
[58:08] the right to come and say, "Lord Jesus,
[58:09] if you only heal me now, I may not be a
[58:11] preacher. I'll talk about it. I'll do
[58:13] everything I can. You are the vine. I'm
[58:14] one of the branches." And so forth.
[58:16] Okay. Now, let's go on. Let's go further
[58:18] now. In order to preach the gospel,
[58:21] before you can make it a gospel preach,
[58:24] you have got to have power and
[58:26] demonstration of the Holy Spirit.
[58:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:29] &gt;&gt; To prove the gospel.
[58:31] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[58:31] &gt;&gt; The letter killth. and the but the
[58:34] spirit maketh alive.
[58:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:36] &gt;&gt; So the gospel is truly the gospel when
[58:38] it is preached in power and
[58:39] demonstration. Could we all stand and
[58:41] give God some praises as we worship the
[58:43] Lord? And brother Anthony going to lead
[58:45] us in some songs and we're going to
[58:46] close. Oh, praise the Lord. Let's all
[58:48] stand and give God some praises.
[58:51] &gt;&gt; Oh, give him praise this morning. Oh
[58:59] hallelujah. Do you love him today? Oh,
[59:02] glory be to God. Hallelujah.
[59:05] Thank you, Jesus. Glory be to God.
[59:09] Hallelujah.
[59:11] This is my season.
[59:16] Oh,
[59:18] this time.
[59:23] And with my hands lifted.
[59:27] [Music]

[1:00:04] Holy Spirit.
[1:00:06] Oh,
[1:00:09] this is well, this is my season.
[1:00:15] Oh, and I
[1:00:17] [Music]
[1:00:20] Oh,
[1:00:22] with my hands lifted.
[1:00:27] Oh, hand my hand out.
[1:00:33] Oh, sweet home, please.
[1:00:37] Oh,
[1:00:39] won't you fear me now?
[1:00:43] Oh, give the Lord a praise offering
[1:00:45] right now. You lift your hands. Oh, and
[1:00:47] worship him today. Thank you, Jesus. Oh,
[1:00:51] sweet Holy Spirit, sweet heavenly dove.
[1:00:55] Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:00:57] Manifestation of the spirit of God. Oh
[1:01:00] hallelujah. How we need his spirit
[1:01:02] today. Oh hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:01:04] Hallelujah. Oh, you worship him right
[1:01:06] now. You lift your hands and praise him
[1:01:08] right now. Give him glory right now. Oh
[1:01:11] hallelujah. Hallelujah. The fullness of
[1:01:14] time has come. Oh hallelujah. Time for
[1:01:17] your anointing. Time for your
[1:01:18] breakthrough. Time for your spirit of
[1:01:21] God.
[1:01:23] Spirit. Oh, fill me now. Fill me now.
[1:01:29] One more time. Sweet Holy Spirit.
[1:01:32] Sweet Holy Spirit.
[1:01:36] Oh,
[1:01:38] sweet Holy Spirit.
[1:01:42] Oh,
[1:01:44] this is my se
[1:01:46] [Music]
[1:01:49] time.
[1:01:52] Oh,

[1:04:55] honor and glory of God and the kingdom
[1:04:58] of God. In Jesus name we pray and ask
[1:05:00] it. Amen. And amen. Praise God. As they
[1:05:03] hand it out, oh,
[1:05:06] have you been baptized into the body?
[1:05:11] baptized with the Holy Ghost. Oh, there
[1:05:16] is but one way to enter in it just as

[1:08:58] Oh, there is power, power, wonder
[1:09:02] working power in the preious blood of
[1:09:07] the lamb. Can we give the Lord a hand of
[1:09:10] praise? Are you happy to be in the house
[1:09:13] of the Lord?
[1:09:16] Amen. You appreciate the message today.
[1:09:18] You appreciate your pastor. You
[1:09:21] appreciate the word. My, it felt fresh.
[1:09:25] And I think this was in 2017, I believe
[1:09:28] it was. So, you see how God could
[1:09:30] preserve food for us. That's present
[1:09:32] tense redemption.
[1:09:34] &gt;&gt; Can we give the Lord one more hand of
[1:09:36] praise?
[1:09:40] Amen.
[1:09:42] Uh we have two notes of praises and a
[1:09:45] prayer request. Our first note of praise
[1:09:48] is from brother Hugh Williams. Thanking
[1:09:50] God for being able to come out today and
[1:09:52] to be back in fellowship, my family and
[1:09:55] I. So we are so grateful.
[1:09:58] Can we give the Lord a hand of praise?
[1:10:01] And brother Hugh, we are looking for God
[1:10:04] to complete to complete a perfect
[1:10:06] healing, to complete a perfect work, not
[1:10:09] many days hence. Can we give the Lord a
[1:10:12] hand of praise?
[1:10:14] Amen. Not just for brother Hugh, but for
[1:10:17] every single person that's sick.
[1:10:20] Hallelujah. Brother Brandham taught us,
[1:10:22] he said, "How could you have faith for a
[1:10:24] rapture if you can't have faith for
[1:10:25] divine healing?" So divine healing is on
[1:10:28] the journey to the rapture. This body
[1:10:30] has got to be changed. Hallelujah. You
[1:10:33] got to believe it. You got to claim it.
[1:10:35] You got to speak it. You got to walk in
[1:10:37] it like Abraham and stagger not at the
[1:10:40] promise of God. Because it is a promise
[1:10:42] of God that you are supposed to be
[1:10:45] healed. Not just healed, delivered. Not
[1:10:48] just delivered, sealed all the way until
[1:10:51] your redemption. Can we give the Lord a
[1:10:52] hand of praise?
[1:10:55] Glory.
[1:10:57] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:10:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:00] &gt;&gt; We have another note of praise. This is
[1:11:02] from uh brother and sister Sabu. Uh this
[1:11:05] month marks a milestone for us in this
[1:11:08] ministry. 31 years. Wow. That's
[1:11:12] tremendous. We would like to thank
[1:11:13] brother and sister oid for their
[1:11:15] dedication and caring abilities to
[1:11:17] brother Oid. It was uh tough in the
[1:11:21] beginning but when I learned your ways
[1:11:22] it was smooth sailing.
[1:11:26] But over is not in the house today. But
[1:11:28] I got to got to make sure he sees this.
[1:11:30] Once I learned your ways, it was smooth
[1:11:32] sailing. May God bless you and bless us
[1:11:35] all together as we press into the coming
[1:11:36] of the Lord. Brother and Sister Sabo, we
[1:11:39] appreciate that.
[1:11:41] You know, one thing about you know, he's
[1:11:45] he's a he's a sword fighter.
[1:11:48] He doesn't he doesn't play around. It
[1:11:50] can be rough around the edges, but once
[1:11:52] it happens, you learn his ways, then
[1:11:54] it's smooth sailing. You know, he
[1:11:56] believes in saying it direct, saying it
[1:11:58] the way it meant to be said, you know,
[1:12:00] and we appreciate him for that. He
[1:12:02] appreciate your pastor.
[1:12:05] Amen.
[1:12:08] We do have a prayer request at this time
[1:12:12] from brother Popwell for John Knight's
[1:12:15] salvation of his soul. A total healing
[1:12:18] of his prostate gland which is reading I
[1:12:21] think it's 100 g
[1:12:24] and is very much swollen. A biopsy test
[1:12:27] is needed to determine if it's
[1:12:28] cancerous. He has lost a lot of weight
[1:12:31] and unable to walk properly because one
[1:12:34] of his legs has no strength and he may
[1:12:36] have to do a hip replacement. So quite a
[1:12:38] lot here. But our God is able. He's more
[1:12:40] than able in fact. And if you have a
[1:12:43] request today that you want to bring to
[1:12:45] the throne of grace as we approach the
[1:12:48] Lord this morning by raising hands. and
[1:12:51] those in the sanctuary. Maybe you're
[1:12:53] downstairs, maybe you are connected
[1:12:55] online, wherever you might be this
[1:12:57] morning and you have a need for whatever
[1:12:59] it might be, our God is more than able
[1:13:01] to minister this morning. Our gracious
[1:13:03] heavenly father, Lord, we have seen so
[1:13:06] many requests become notes of praise,
[1:13:08] Lord. Lord, and Lord, the pastor was
[1:13:11] preaching about how Lord, you bypassed
[1:13:14] the process when you were there at the
[1:13:16] wedding of Kaa and they said the wine
[1:13:18] ran out. You didn't ask for grapes. You
[1:13:21] didn't ask for where can we set this up.
[1:13:24] You said just pour water, Lord. And you
[1:13:27] bypassed the process the prophet brought
[1:13:29] out, Father. Lord, you are more than
[1:13:31] able to do a work of transformation to
[1:13:33] bypass the process. We are believers
[1:13:36] that missing limbs could be restored. We
[1:13:38] are believers that the God who created
[1:13:41] is able to restore and replace and reset
[1:13:44] and remove. And Lord, so we come today,
[1:13:47] Lord, with our hearts, with our faith
[1:13:49] and expectation, knowing that you've
[1:13:51] done it before and you're able to do it
[1:13:53] again. Lord, we pray for John Knights,
[1:13:56] Lord, for the salvation of his soul, for
[1:13:59] the total healing of the prostate gland
[1:14:01] condition, Lord, that the test, Lord,
[1:14:04] would come back negative, Lord. That
[1:14:06] even as this prayer will go forth, he
[1:14:08] would be completely healed, Lord. That
[1:14:10] you would regulate what need to be
[1:14:11] regulated. You would fix what need to be
[1:14:14] fixed. you would restore what needs to
[1:14:16] be restored. And for every hand that was
[1:14:18] raised all over the sanctuary, Lord, my
[1:14:20] hands are raised also, Lord. Raise
[1:14:23] downstairs, raise on the internet, you
[1:14:25] know, every need, every cry, Lord. Every
[1:14:27] sick person in our midst, everyone
[1:14:29] that's connected to us that we love
[1:14:31] that's being affected to know that
[1:14:33] that's the reason you came, Lord. You
[1:14:35] not now healing, but healing already
[1:14:37] took place, Father. And by your stripes,
[1:14:40] we are healed.
[1:14:41] We walk in faith and confidence Lord
[1:14:44] knowing that you are more than able to
[1:14:46] deal with every situation. So father
[1:14:49] Lord we commit your people into your
[1:14:50] hands Lord. We pray for every brother
[1:14:52] every sister. Lord we lift up our pastor
[1:14:55] before you Lord flying back from the
[1:14:57] meetings in India Lord. Lord may give
[1:15:00] him traveling mercies and bring him back
[1:15:01] to us in health and strength. May you
[1:15:03] bless all the officers. May you bless
[1:15:05] the believers. May you bless everyone
[1:15:07] that's here Lord. May you grant
[1:15:09] traveling mercies, Lord. May you bless
[1:15:12] the baptism service after Lord this
[1:15:14] service. Lord, may you anoint the the
[1:15:17] the the young people in a special way to
[1:15:19] take the step if they have not taken
[1:15:21] that step already. And may you take the
[1:15:23] church from strength to strength. We
[1:15:24] pray in the mighty precious name of
[1:15:27] Jesus Christ. And the church says,
[1:15:29] &gt;&gt; And the church says, "Amen." You may be
[1:15:32] seated for a few announcements.
[1:15:37] Firstly, I'd like to welcome
[1:15:40] Rondell Allen. Good to see you, brother
[1:15:42] Rondell. It's been it's been quite some
[1:15:44] time. Happy to have you here. I see
[1:15:46] invited by sister Dborah. Uh welcome. I
[1:15:49] know Rondell well. May God bless you
[1:15:51] richly. Certainly happy to have you
[1:15:53] here. Jayen, so good to see you as well.
[1:15:56] And uh we are so happy to be able to
[1:15:58] come to the house of God. You have to
[1:16:00] see this as the most important decision,
[1:16:04] the most important appointment. Because
[1:16:06] when there are things that you think you
[1:16:07] need to do and you need to sort out and
[1:16:09] you need to fix and man could only do so
[1:16:11] much, but when God gets involved in the
[1:16:13] matter, then it could be completely
[1:16:15] resolved. It could be completely dealt
[1:16:17] with. And the word says to seek ye first
[1:16:19] the kingdom of God and his
[1:16:21] righteousness, and everything else you
[1:16:23] could ever look for. Anything else you
[1:16:25] could ever ask for will be taken care
[1:16:26] of. So, we are so happy. Can we give the
[1:16:28] Lord one more hand of praise?
[1:16:31] Amen.
[1:16:33] And do remember the pastor. He's on his
[1:16:34] way back. I think one of the flights is
[1:16:37] a 14-hour flight. If you have ever
[1:16:38] flown, a 14-hour flight is like, Lord,
[1:16:42] help us. But may God give him strength
[1:16:45] as he returns to us by tomorrow. Lord
[1:16:47] willing, he should be back into the
[1:16:49] country. So we thank God. So we are very
[1:16:52] happy. We have a baptism service after
[1:16:55] this service. Brother Andrew Henry,
[1:16:57] young brother Andrew Henry. He might be
[1:16:59] downstairs. He's going to be baptized.
[1:17:01] We are so happy. I had the opportunity
[1:17:05] to interview him uh for this last week
[1:17:08] and I said to his father afterwards, "He
[1:17:11] reminds me of me when I was young as a
[1:17:14] young boy. He has a heart for the Lord
[1:17:17] and the Lord has been dealing with him
[1:17:19] and he has had some experiences and
[1:17:21] that's a really tremendous thing."
[1:17:23] Brother Brandham said, "You make
[1:17:24] yourself when you're young." And the
[1:17:26] best and greatest decision you could
[1:17:28] ever make is to serve the Lord while
[1:17:30] you're young. So, we are so happy. We
[1:17:32] are overjoyed to see a young man in such
[1:17:36] a time as this make a decision. I want
[1:17:38] to serve the Lord.
[1:17:39] &gt;&gt; You know, and when I asked him why you
[1:17:40] want to do this because we don't want to
[1:17:42] get baptized because other people get
[1:17:44] baptized. Why do you want to do this? We
[1:17:46] want you to answer from your own mouth
[1:17:48] with with your parents not there. It was
[1:17:50] just him and I alone tustling
[1:17:52] to see why you want to do this and he
[1:17:54] had an answer. You know, he really want
[1:17:56] to serve the Lord. So, we are happy
[1:17:58] about that. So, we encourage you to join
[1:17:59] us for the baptism service after the
[1:18:02] service today. Service continues this
[1:18:05] coming Wednesday here at the tabernacle.
[1:18:07] Come under great expectation. We're
[1:18:09] looking for God to do something
[1:18:10] tremendous. This coming Friday, we'll
[1:18:12] have our Zoom prayer meeting. Be
[1:18:14] present. Be active. Looking for God to
[1:18:17] do something. God operates when we pray.
[1:18:22] We have to understand that prayer is an
[1:18:24] invitation into this terrestrial realm.
[1:18:26] We will remember that when Daniel was
[1:18:30] praying, the angel was fighting and the
[1:18:32] moment Daniel stopped praying, the angel
[1:18:34] stopped fighting. So I want us to
[1:18:36] recognize that the access that God has
[1:18:39] into our jurisdiction is open by the
[1:18:42] channel of prayer. So I want to
[1:18:44] encourage you, don't take it lightly.
[1:18:45] And prayer is not just a prayer meeting
[1:18:48] thing. It's a way of life. It's
[1:18:50] something you do in the morning. It's
[1:18:51] something you do in the evening,
[1:18:52] something you do in the day, and it's
[1:18:54] something should should be to practice
[1:18:56] the presence of God. And this coming
[1:18:57] Sunday, we have our double service this
[1:19:01] coming Sunday, Lord willing. And um
[1:19:04] these are the final, this one and the
[1:19:06] one in December, Lord willing, will be
[1:19:08] the final two for this year. And I
[1:19:10] believe I was preaching recently and
[1:19:12] speaking about do this in remembrance of
[1:19:14] me. It's a command from the Lord. It's
[1:19:17] not an option. And if you are a
[1:19:18] believer, this is something that you
[1:19:20] want to be here for. So we encourage you
[1:19:22] to make every effort to be in the house
[1:19:24] of the Lord next been faithful at this
[1:19:26] mission. We certainly appreciate you
[1:19:28] very much. Can we put our hands together
[1:19:29] for the cleaning crews and the different
[1:19:32] teams? It's on a roster. It's on a
[1:19:35] rotation. So the work is supposed to be
[1:19:37] shared. But I do know there are some
[1:19:39] believers who it doesn't matter what
[1:19:41] group is serving. They actually join
[1:19:43] because they have a heart for the
[1:19:44] things. So, we want to appreciate you
[1:19:45] very much uh for that support and we
[1:19:48] want to encourage you uh this is our
[1:19:51] church. You know, we all wear different
[1:19:53] hats and responsibilities and we
[1:19:54] encourage you to be able to support in
[1:19:57] some way. Next week, Lord willing, group
[1:19:58] one, which is what the Pop Wells group
[1:20:00] will be carded to serve. We would have
[1:20:03] announced last Sunday that our end of
[1:20:05] year church dinner is scheduled for
[1:20:07] December the 20th. It'll be Saturday,
[1:20:10] December the 20th at 5:00 p.m. We want
[1:20:13] to invite the entire church to
[1:20:15] participate. The menu is downstairs.
[1:20:18] They have withheld it from me because
[1:20:20] normally I would stand here and read it,
[1:20:22] but they're trying to protect you and
[1:20:24] protect me at this point. So, I was told
[1:20:26] here the menu is downstairs. So, we all
[1:20:29] have to go see it afterwards. But I I um
[1:20:33] I have a note. It is an attractive menu.
[1:20:36] Delicious food.
[1:20:40] So adults 150 and children uh I think
[1:20:45] this will be $80 and under five will be
[1:20:47] free. So I mean this is a fantastic
[1:20:51] cost, fantastic fellowship,
[1:20:55] attractive menu, delicious food. I'm
[1:20:57] quoting from the note that I have here.
