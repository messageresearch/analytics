[17:00] hallelujah that's what god put us on
[17:02] good for i have a word for you this
[17:05] morning you can't get victory without
[17:06] conflict
[17:10] you're not going to preach just yet we
[17:12] just want to see some things before we
[17:14] start to preach but you can't get
[17:15] victory without conflict
[17:17] brother branham preached a message
[17:18] called conflict between god and satan
[17:20] and conflict is a struggle for power for
[17:23] property
[17:24] conflict is strong disagreement between
[17:26] people groups the results in angry
[17:29] argument
[17:30] differences
[17:31] isn't that right competitive comparative
[17:33] opposing action antagonistic state or
[17:36] action mental struggle resulting from
[17:39] incompatible or opposing needs
[17:42] drives
[17:43] wishes external or internal demands
[17:48] conflict
[17:49] the opposition of persons or forces that
[17:51] give us rise to dramatic action or drama
[17:54] or fiction
[17:55] active disagreement between people
[17:58] with opposite opinions
[18:00] in fightings all this conflict to fight
[18:03] to contend to back up the fight to
[18:06] struggle prolong struggle and strife
[18:10] discord of action isn't that right and
[18:12] brother branson eden god knew his enemy
[18:14] and all the attacks
[18:16] of his enemy gordon god is infinite and
[18:19] the infinite god is the perfection of
[18:22] the perfections
[18:23] he knew all things before they ever was
[18:26] and therefore this infinite god could
[18:28] have looked forward and seen the end
[18:30] from the beginning
[18:32] so he could declare your end from the
[18:34] beginning
[18:35] so you could know that you're going to
[18:36] get the victory that's why you can shout
[18:38] right now you could know you're going to
[18:40] get the victory that's why you could get
[18:41] rejoice right now so the conflict and
[18:43] struggle and mind battle you're going
[18:44] through in your mind today and even now
[18:46] that's fine
[18:48] they don't want to say amen that's very
[18:50] fine oh yes you get upset and this that
[18:53] all is good
[18:54] because you're going to get the victory
[18:56] do you believe that
[18:58] all the pressure is good that's right up
[19:00] the mountain and then going in the
[19:01] valley all that is part of the package
[19:04] that give us life
[19:06] hallelujah doesn't make it like a
[19:07] stuffed toy we just like this yeah

[21:38] the prophet said if the devil see if you

[21:41] marijuana then cocaine and you catch
[21:43] what you're doing he will keep you on
[21:44] cigarettes alone because you see where

[21:47] where you're going you think from
[21:48] cigarette the marijuana the cocaine to
[21:50] be a junkie and to send you to hell but
[21:52] if you catch where he's going he'll keep
[21:54] it right there
[21:55] if you see your take from my man of the
[21:57] cooking and you'll catch that he will
[21:59] keep you on marijuana but when you

[22:01] marijuana cocaine cigarette you don't
[22:04] have to belong to him you can be loosed
[22:08] loosed
[22:10] yes yes he came to break
[22:12] the chains
[22:14] you don't have to walk around with a
[22:15] chain like in some labor camp and you're
[22:18] walking in some big big heavy load with
[22:20] you and everywhere you go you're walking
[22:22] with the chain oh you're here in a
[22:24] service that you can get those things
[22:26] broken you don't have to go back and do
[22:28] what you did before
[22:30] do you believe that
[22:32] there's still power in the name of jesus
[22:36] glory to god hallelujah
[22:39] we're going to start a revolution
[22:41] a revolution like the world i've never
[22:42] seen before
[22:44] we are not church members we are who
[22:46] daniel saw but people that know their
[22:49] god we are not church joiners no no no
[22:53] no it shall come to pass afterwards that
[22:56] i'll pour out
[22:57] my spirit
[22:59] hallelujah hallelujah we are the
[23:02] tabernacles
[23:04] we are the vessels

[23:13] glory glory glory glory
[23:21] [Applause]
[23:24] hallelujah
[23:26] praise god
[23:27] so then he was the perfection of
[23:29] perfection amen he knew all things that
[23:32] before there ever was
[23:33] and therefore if this infinite god could
[23:36] have looked forward and dead and seen he
[23:38] end from the beginning and knew he would
[23:40] have churned on his earth his blessed
[23:42] children don't you believe that he would
[23:44] provide the best thing for him to them
[23:47] would you not deny to your children that
[23:49] was helpless little fellows who can't
[23:51] take care of themselves don't you
[23:52] struggle and work
[23:54] and do everything that you can to
[23:55] provide the best that you can for those
[23:57] children
[23:58] because you are father a parent
[24:01] and that's trueness the thought of
[24:03] earthly parent and parenthood originated
[24:06] in god
[24:07] because he was the first parent
[24:09] and don't you think that god seeing
[24:11] that's what satan would be what satan
[24:13] would do he gave his children and
[24:15] provided for them the best thing that
[24:17] could be valid for them
[24:18] knowing what the enemy attack would be
[24:21] god fortify his children
[24:23] we take the war the general goes out to
[24:25] meet another general and this general if
[24:27] he's a true citizen of this nation he
[24:30] surely would be to be a general the
[24:32] first thing he studies the enemy tactics
[24:35] and attacks he knows what he's going to
[24:37] do how he's going to work and he send
[24:39] and get spies to spy out and so forth
[24:42] god knew this great warfare was coming
[24:44] on
[24:48] he called it a great
[24:50] warfare
[24:51] not no picnic so shake that off this
[24:54] morning great
[24:56] warfare isn't that right
[24:58] what's coming between right and wrong he
[25:00] knew what the enemy was going to do he
[25:03] know how to equip his people so we
[25:05] noticed the very first thing that god
[25:07] did being infinite he knowed what it
[25:10] took to defeat satan anytime
[25:13] anywhere under any condition
[25:16] i'll give them something
[25:18] oh hallelujah
[25:20] something to defeat them anywhere any
[25:22] place anytime
[25:24] under any condition
[25:26] so when satan see a man walking like
[25:28] that satan says look trouble coming come
[25:31] on see him and somebody you see the
[25:33] devil coming in my look trouble but when
[25:35] the devil see a man on the word with

[32:44] it's a substance of things what you're
[32:46] hoping for it's the evidence of what
[32:48] you're not seeing
[32:49] so that's why god could go and declare
[32:51] your end from the very beginning
[32:53] that is why god could say jacob i love
[32:56] he so i hate
[32:57] because jacob he knew jacob was a scamp
[33:01] jacob was a skull that's why you can
[33:02] look at people and say she's so
[33:05] he's so
[33:06] they so cut that out
[33:09] because if he was looking at esau and
[33:11] jacob he was in a fine easter to be very
[33:13] impressive
[33:15] [Applause]
[33:18] his suit was just right he talked right

[36:38] when i walk the devil must run that's
[36:41] what we talking about when you walk when

[38:34] free
[38:35] the spirit comes to release
[38:39] people from their condition

[45:45] because you said you didn't need any
[45:47] ammunition here
[45:48] let me read the ammunition
[45:56] so god equipped children
[45:59] with what was freedom from the into the
[46:01] rapture what was it the word
[46:04] that
[46:05] is what defeat satan
[46:08] is the world
[46:09] it will defeat him anywhere any place
[46:12] now why do we want to substitute
[46:14] something else
[46:15] when we get the best thing there is
[46:18] it's the word
[46:21] we find jesus on earth to prove this was
[46:24] the best equipment when satan come in
[46:26] and come back with jesus like that you
[46:28] know the distant drone thing and
[46:29] fighting they like it they tend nothing
[46:31] this is hand to hand come back
[46:33] in the wilderness
[46:35] he never reached out to his power and
[46:36] tied his hands he just took the weapon
[46:38] god gave in the garden eden
[46:41] and say it is written
[46:43] it is written and you punch him out of
[46:45] the ring
[46:48] because the devil left jesus for a
[46:49] season
[46:50] so when jesus finished with him boom
[46:52] what is it written several side gone
[46:54] i'll take a break on that one that man
[46:56] is underweight
[46:58] hallelujah so man on the word a woman on
[47:01] the word is a dangerous woman
[47:04] a dangerous man
[47:06] because it means that she could get
[47:07] anything she asked for
[47:09] hallelujah because she is underweight
[47:14] do you understand what 10 john 15 really
[47:17] saying to us

[47:27] and it shall be done
[47:30] [Applause]
[47:32] i don't think people get that
[47:35] nothing is withholding from you
[47:38] [Applause]
[47:44] it means you could walk into a hospital
[47:46] room
[47:47] on somebody that is on the dead bed
[47:50] that the that the doctors have no more
[47:52] to do for them and you could walk up and
[47:55] say rise up
[47:56] but if i don't walk into a room
[47:59] the woman was just bones there and he
[48:02] said rise up
[48:03] and bones run

[48:09] and i am saying jesus christ
[48:12] is the same
[48:14] yesterday
[48:16] today
[48:17] and forever

[57:08] are you living out past
[57:10] you remember what you're doing in the
[57:10] past you're looking to the future you're
[57:13] in the present but god is outside of

[57:16] so your past is present to him
[57:19] your future is also present to him
[57:21] your presence is present to him
[57:23] so he knows the end from the beginning
[57:25] so when you're struggling look like
[57:27] jonah
[57:28] jonah run we know the story i close off
[57:30] with her
[57:31] jonah ran and got out of fish prepared

[58:27] the fish can bring him to

[1:00:19] and jesus when he was baptized went up
[1:00:20] straight away out of the heavens out of
[1:00:22] the water
[1:00:23] although the heavens were open unto him
[1:00:25] and he saw the spirit of god descending

[1:00:54] and except those days should be
[1:00:56] shortened
[1:00:57] there should be no flesh be saved
[1:00:59] but for the elect's sake
[1:01:01] those days shall be shortened
[1:01:04] then then if this any man shall say unto
[1:01:06] you no here is christ or there believe
[1:01:08] it not for they shall arise false
[1:01:10] christs
[1:01:12] false prophets

[1:01:19] that if it were possible they would
[1:01:21] deceive the very elect

[1:03:02] morning
[1:03:03] dove
[1:03:05] leading eagle
[1:03:07] another inspiration
[1:03:09] the spirit of truth
[1:03:11] a context scripture
[1:03:13] which i want to read now from sin john
[1:03:15] you'd have to find it i'm going to read
[1:03:17] it for you
[1:03:18] uh which is from verse 12
[1:03:20] jesus speaking
[1:03:23] i have many yet many things to say unto
[1:03:25] you but you can't debate him now
[1:03:27] how be it when he
[1:03:28] the spirit of judas come
[1:03:30] he will guide you into all truth for he
[1:03:32] shall not speak of himself but
[1:03:34] whatsoever he shall hear that shall he
[1:03:37] speak and he shall show you things to
[1:03:39] come
[1:03:40] he shall glorify me for he shall receive
[1:03:43] of mine and shall show it
[1:03:45] unto you may god
[1:03:47] bless his word
[1:03:48] and we know
[1:03:50] brother branham says
[1:03:51] we have to receive a messenger and when
[1:03:53] we come down to the end the last message
[1:03:56] is supposed to straighten all up you're
[1:03:58] talking about the loose ends the
[1:03:59] reformers didn't live long enough
[1:04:01] alexander campbell so forth but the man
[1:04:03] the reformers didn't live long enough to
[1:04:05] get it all together so let a loose end
[1:04:07] were left
[1:04:08] and so forth and he said now when we
[1:04:11] come up to the end
[1:04:12] the last message is supposed to
[1:04:14] straighten that up and bring these
[1:04:16] things to one feet
[1:04:17] one lord
[1:04:19] one baptism
[1:04:20] he talking about
[1:04:22] that the capstone the church will come
[1:04:25] into such a minority and a ministry will
[1:04:27] be among those people
[1:04:29] till it will be exactly the same
[1:04:31] ministry that jesus did and that will
[1:04:34] bring jesus and cast the whole bride
[1:04:36] away
[1:04:37] and all those honest lutherans true
[1:04:40] lutherans
[1:04:42] presbyterians baptist methodists and
[1:04:44] whoever is born of the spirit of god
[1:04:47] will be caught away with jesus when he
[1:04:49] comes
[1:04:50] i believe that
[1:04:52] and i love how he plays that he didn't
[1:04:54] say uh uh message people he said all who
[1:04:57] are born of the spirit of god
[1:05:00] because the coming of the lord is that
[1:05:02] the coming of the magnet that will pick
[1:05:04] up all those who are magnetized to it
[1:05:07] so you have to have the characteristics
[1:05:09] that the magnet can pick you up now you
[1:05:11] know a magnet can't pick up wood
[1:05:13] or stone
[1:05:14] or paper it has to pick up metal that
[1:05:17] have the properties that could be
[1:05:18] magnetized there but the holy ghost have
[1:05:20] to be in you
[1:05:22] for the magnet of god
[1:05:24] to pick you up
[1:05:25] so this bring the raptor very simple
[1:05:27] connection to connection
[1:05:29] once the spirit is running through you
[1:05:32] and the magnet of the holy ghost comes
[1:05:34] you're gonna pick up all those so god
[1:05:36] will send this sweeping magnet to sleep
[1:05:38] across the world and pick up
[1:05:40] all across the world isn't that right
[1:05:42] hallelujah isn't that right do you
[1:05:44] believe that
[1:05:45] amen no i believe by the grace of god
[1:05:48] and my descriptive support because it
[1:05:50] didn't come in the first watch he could
[1:05:51] the seventh watch and when he come all
[1:05:53] those virgin arrows and trim the lamps
[1:05:55] presbyterian lutheran that's born of the
[1:05:57] spirit of god so all those brothers in
[1:06:00] the ages gone past they were born of the
[1:06:03] spirit of god for their time and season
[1:06:06] justification signification they had a
[1:06:08] word and spirit they had mechanics and
[1:06:11] dynamics
[1:06:12] for their season in their time but in
[1:06:15] this hour god requirement is perfection
[1:06:18] it's a little more than what they had
[1:06:20] because david and us are not made
[1:06:21] perfect
[1:06:22] isn't that right
[1:06:24] so watch in the last days what the
[1:06:27] spirit of god whosoever is born of the
[1:06:29] spirit of god shall go in that rapture i
[1:06:32] believe that the bride will be called
[1:06:33] out during that time
[1:06:35] i believe that there will be some in the
[1:06:37] last days won't have to taste debt but
[1:06:39] will be changed in a moment
[1:06:42] in a twinkling of an eye
[1:06:43] isn't that right and the holy spirit is
[1:06:46] the divine love isn't that right
[1:06:48] tremendous victory in the love divine
[1:06:51] hallelujah so jesus did the works of his
[1:06:53] father because the father was in him
[1:06:55] that's why the works was done do you
[1:06:57] believe that god the father which was
[1:07:00] the father of jesus christ the great
[1:07:01] spirit dwelt in the fullness of his
[1:07:03] power in jesus christ which is the
[1:07:05] tabernacle of god made flesh
[1:07:07] representing the word
[1:07:09] jesus was the word and the word here we
[1:07:12] go was invisible
[1:07:15] until it was made flesh
[1:07:19] then the world becomes visible
[1:07:22] so people are looking for manifestation
[1:07:24] but god wants the word to become flesh
[1:07:27] that means the word come alive in you
[1:07:30] in your flesh
[1:07:32] then god could not be unveiled
[1:07:34] because you have not veiled god
[1:07:37] in your flesh
[1:07:39] not just word in the heart not just word
[1:07:42] in the mind not just word that you
[1:07:44] understand but the word become flesh a
[1:07:48] living moving monument an expression or
[1:07:51] extension of god almighty you become an
[1:07:54] attribute son of a spirit
[1:07:57] oh hallelujah
[1:07:59] wow
[1:08:03] hallelujah
[1:08:04] how many want to see the word visible
[1:08:07] then you're asking for the word to
[1:08:09] become flesh
[1:08:11] oh glory to god hallelujah hallelujah
[1:08:13] there got to be something take place for
[1:08:15] that word to become flesh inside of you
[1:08:18] then it's no more you
[1:08:20] it's the word in you
[1:08:21] jesus is not me that dwight the world is
[1:08:23] my father
[1:08:25] because he dwelleth in me
[1:08:27] oh give the lord some praises
[1:08:29] oh hallelujah
[1:08:31] oh glory to god this is gospel
[1:08:34] oh this is not a pentecostal
[1:08:36] another conflict thing this is gospel
[1:08:38] this is what we pressure not onto isn't
[1:08:40] that right don't listen to this untrue
[1:08:43] his sacrificial debt at calvary and his
[1:08:45] resurrection here we go positionally
[1:08:48] places church in that realm
[1:08:50] that the same invisible god could come
[1:08:54] into the individual
[1:08:56] and make the word visible
[1:08:59] he said oh my i wish my church could get
[1:09:01] that
[1:09:02] if you could see friends the invisible
[1:09:04] god
[1:09:05] made visible
[1:09:07] hallelujah
[1:09:09] so the grace of lazarus jesus wept
[1:09:11] shortest words in the bible jesus wept
[1:09:14] he cried
[1:09:15] he felt their pain amen he said when he
[1:09:18] said
[1:09:19] enter into their sufferings when he
[1:09:21] finish
[1:09:22] where have you lead him
[1:09:25] oh hallelujah he cried like a man he was
[1:09:28] tired like a man he was hungry as a man
[1:09:32] but when he set that off and say where
[1:09:34] has you lead him he was more than a man
[1:09:36] it was god in a man don't get messed up
[1:09:39] this was god in the man and it's gonna
[1:09:42] be god inside of you oh glory to god so

[1:10:10] presence of god

[1:10:20] hallelujah how would you feel to be

[1:10:28] how you should be in church
[1:10:30] [Applause]
[1:10:33] oh hallelujah because jesus is here
[1:10:37] where the twos and trees are gathered
[1:10:38] together he promised to be in the midst
[1:10:41] of them and if jesus is among us he
[1:10:44] ought to be worshipped

[1:10:54] [Music]
[1:10:56] glory to god amen
[1:10:58] hallelujah
[1:10:59] but the bran of my often wanted to come
[1:11:01] to the church
[1:11:02] how long to see it i guess
[1:11:05] i could walk in the back door front door
[1:11:07] wherever it was
[1:11:08] look across the audience see a perfect
[1:11:10] church
[1:11:11] all in order
[1:11:13] sin couldn't stay there
[1:11:15] the spirit would call it out
[1:11:17] it just couldn't stay
[1:11:19] like alas as a pharah you couldn't do it
[1:11:21] there'd be there'd be no sin in that
[1:11:22] group
[1:11:23] the spirit will quickly speak it out no
[1:11:26] matter what it was how little it would
[1:11:27] be done
[1:11:28] see woman sitting under the power of the
[1:11:30] holy spirit the spirit moving perfectly
[1:11:33] somebody done something wrong in the
[1:11:34] congregation they would quickly confess
[1:11:36] it before the spirit
[1:11:38] take a hold of it that's when the spirit
[1:11:41] moving in the coming
[1:11:42] people trimming they come to church
[1:11:44] they're making sure means right they
[1:11:46] can't even walk in the building like
[1:11:47] that spirit is dear
[1:11:49] that proven spirit that deserving spirit
[1:11:51] you can't hide you're naked before god
[1:11:54] oh hallelujah praise god
[1:11:57] hallelujah hallelujah that's the church
[1:11:59] of the living god oh my old poor heart
[1:12:02] is getting old now i long to stand and
[1:12:04] see a church like that
[1:12:06] perfect works without sin
[1:12:08] oh glory to god
[1:12:10] hallelujah
[1:12:12] hallelujah
[1:12:13] so there are many spirits going out
[1:12:16] to lead others
[1:12:18] to lead people
[1:12:20] to lead church
[1:12:21] to attempt to lead the bride
[1:12:24] many spirit has gone out into the world
[1:12:27] but the bible says believe not every
[1:12:28] spirit
[1:12:31] have a ton lord of them gone out
[1:12:33] christ is one singular spirit
[1:12:39] so first john
[1:12:41] four one says beloved believe in every
[1:12:43] spirit
[1:12:44] but try the spirits
[1:12:46] whether they be of god because many
[1:12:48] false prophets are gone into the world
[1:12:51] not a few
[1:12:52] not one here and one there
[1:12:54] satan just producing them
[1:12:58] a mass production of mad false prophets
[1:13:02] hallelujah crazy doctrine
[1:13:05] and we are commissioned
[1:13:07] to try
[1:13:08] the spirits
[1:13:10] by the word
[1:13:12] endless number of seducing spirits
[1:13:14] taking people off the world
[1:13:17] all kind of doctrines of devils private
[1:13:19] revelations and visions dreams of their
[1:13:22] own human spirit but in every age the
[1:13:24] spirit cried out he the heart hair to
[1:13:27] hear
[1:13:28] let him hear
[1:13:30] what the spirit said unto the churches
[1:13:34] therefore the holy spirit
[1:13:36] can only speak the word
[1:13:39] come on now come on now
[1:13:41] come on now
[1:13:43] oh hallelujah
[1:13:45] so it's not just a preacher wearing a
[1:13:47] tie somebody behind a pulpit the holy
[1:13:51] spirit which is the spirit of truth
[1:13:54] can only speak
[1:13:56] the word
[1:13:58] oh give the lord a shout
[1:14:00] oh hallelujah hallelujah
[1:14:04] so don't listen to any private
[1:14:05] revelation
[1:14:06] do any person in this church or oldest
[1:14:08] church
[1:14:09] because you can only defeat the enemy by
[1:14:11] the word
[1:14:12] oh hallelujah do you believe that
[1:14:15] hallelujah and the spirit of truth is
[1:14:16] here
[1:14:17] which is the word
[1:14:19] my word are spirit and they are life the
[1:14:21] word is spirit and spirit is word so the
[1:14:24] spirit of truth is here because the word
[1:14:26] is in the bride the word is amongst the
[1:14:28] bride god send the prophet to release
[1:14:31] the spirit of truth to follow this
[1:14:33] message
[1:14:34] do you believe that
[1:14:36] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:14:38] listen to the prophet many people have
[1:14:40] been deceived in receiving the holy
[1:14:41] ghost
[1:14:42] they've got doctrine like elijah garment
[1:14:45] manifested sons of god
[1:14:47] all kind of stuff people fall blindly on
[1:14:49] there and go through some kind of
[1:14:50] sensation raise back up with arrogant
[1:14:53] spirit here we go
[1:14:54] indifferent fussy
[1:14:57] high-tempered that's not the spirit of
[1:15:00] god
[1:15:02] amen they don't know how to behave
[1:15:04] themselves in the house of god
[1:15:07] no manners
[1:15:08] just no audacity at all
[1:15:10] no feeling towards god all i think about
[1:15:13] is my church it shows they receive a
[1:15:16] church spirit
[1:15:18] so the church spirit talk about the
[1:15:20] church my church our church that's true
[1:15:23] spirit
[1:15:24] holy ghost speaks the word
[1:15:26] [Applause]
[1:15:28] hallelujah
[1:15:29] so watch
[1:15:31] anything
[1:15:33] almost anything have characteristics
[1:15:36] just like many people are left-handed or
[1:15:37] right-handed
[1:15:38] they are characteristic of the way to
[1:15:40] handle themselves
[1:15:41] so then
[1:15:43] i drop a point here jesus in matthew 24
[1:15:45] said
[1:15:46] the
[1:15:47] characteristics of the spirit
[1:15:49] would be somewhat alike in the last days
[1:15:52] so close
[1:15:54] it will deceive the very elected if
[1:15:56] possible
[1:15:57] now that's the way the spirits are in
[1:16:00] the last days
[1:16:01] they are somewhat alike
[1:16:03] here we go but they have a
[1:16:05] characteristic that identifies them
[1:16:08] one of them is right
[1:16:10] the other one is wrong
[1:16:12] and it can be identified by its
[1:16:14] characteristics
[1:16:16] the spirit of god
[1:16:18] can be identified by its characteristics
[1:16:21] amen isn't that right
[1:16:23] the spirit of god here we go and the
[1:16:26] spirit of the church
[1:16:29] there is a church spirit
[1:16:32] and
[1:16:33] a spirit of god that is absolutely not
[1:16:37] like the church spirit at all
[1:16:40] so but abraham is nailing it down there
[1:16:42] is a church spirit
[1:16:44] and there's a spirit of god
[1:16:46] hallelujah isn't that right there is a
[1:16:48] denominational spirit
[1:16:50] there's a national spirit there's a
[1:16:52] spirit of the nation
[1:16:54] every nation i go to have a different
[1:16:56] spirit i go to finland find people
[1:16:58] there's a famous spirit i go to germany
[1:17:00] there's a german spirit so every country
[1:17:03] has their own spirit and sometimes
[1:17:05] people live in that spirit they're not
[1:17:07] even christian
[1:17:09] they are in the spirit of the country
[1:17:11] going to church
[1:17:14] so to be a christian you have to die out
[1:17:16] of the spirit of your country
[1:17:19] because the country's spirit is not the
[1:17:21] spirit of god
[1:17:22] so the trinidad spirit is not the spirit
[1:17:25] of god
[1:17:26] god's spirit is the word
[1:17:28] god is not a trinidadian come on now
[1:17:31] sam and somebody god is the word
[1:17:39] hallelujah
[1:17:40] oh give the lord
[1:17:42] [Applause]
[1:17:46] so this challenges you to shake out the
[1:17:48] spirit that you're in
[1:17:50] you know homes are spirit yes amen
[1:17:56] churches and spirits
[1:18:00] sometimes people have this predatory
[1:18:02] person
[1:18:03] any pastor do you answer everybody
[1:18:04] talking really answer afterwards
[1:18:07] people who know about this know what
[1:18:08] this but we're not talking about
[1:18:18] didn't get the holy ghost you know
[1:18:19] getting man sprayed upon them
[1:18:21] got a man putting himself into the
[1:18:22] people
[1:18:24] and the spirit people covered by that
[1:18:25] spirit yeah
[1:18:27] but god wants us to be individuals
[1:18:29] have your unique way
[1:18:31] that's right your unique characteristics
[1:18:33] god love you as you are if god wants you
[1:18:36] taller he was gonna make you born any
[1:18:37] longer
[1:18:41] isn't that right
[1:18:43] god loves you as you are you are
[1:18:45] fearfully and wonderfully made
[1:18:47] so enjoy yourself
[1:18:49] [Applause]
[1:18:51] my god behind again for that enjoy who
[1:18:54] you are
[1:18:56] hallelujah you are wonderful in god

[1:19:13] is that god love but god wasn't seeing
[1:19:16] that god know the end

[1:19:21] god know the world will become a
[1:19:22] butterfly you thank god seeing you where
[1:19:24] you are
[1:19:27] my god
[1:19:29] that's why god backing you up
[1:19:34] that's why when the satan want to accuse
[1:19:35] you god say what sin
[1:19:37] check the blood
[1:19:39] check the cross
[1:19:41] what you talking about what they did

[1:20:32] last days

[1:20:35] of the church people
[1:20:37] and the bright spirit
[1:20:39] of the bright people
[1:20:41] will be so close together it will
[1:20:43] receive the very elective as possible so
[1:20:46] the church people have a church spirit
[1:20:48] but the bright people oh give the lord a
[1:20:50] shout
[1:20:52] the pride people have a bright spirit
[1:20:54] oh hallelujah
[1:20:56] so watch luther

[1:21:00] will reveal the bright spirit
[1:21:05] they come like the banks the bank don't
[1:21:07] train the tellers with false dollars
[1:21:10] did us train them with real money
[1:21:13] genuine dollars

[1:21:16] come to the money something's feeling
[1:21:18] nothing right they take the pen and do
[1:21:20] so
[1:21:21] say nah boy
[1:21:23] there's a count defeat
[1:21:25] there's a copy of the original

[1:21:31] word
[1:21:32] with original seed
[1:21:34] with original spoken word quotes
[1:21:37] books
[1:21:38] tapes
[1:21:40] words from malachi 4
[1:21:42] the evening messenger the style the
[1:21:44] right hand of god
[1:21:46] because the prophet said what the bible
[1:21:47] said
[1:21:48] isn't that under five always say what
[1:21:50] the prophet said
[1:21:51] and the people say what the prophet said
[1:21:53] all say the same thing oh give the lord
[1:21:56] a shout
[1:21:58] the spirit the prophet and the bride say
[1:22:02] the same thing

[1:22:17] glory to god
[1:22:19] so the bright spirit

[1:22:22] virtual
[1:22:23] knowledge
[1:22:24] temperance patience godliness bravely
[1:22:27] kindness charity and the other spirit is
[1:22:30] everything else
[1:22:32] oh give the lord some praises people
[1:22:34] oh glory lord god you talk about the
[1:22:37] thumbnail that shakes the devil that's
[1:22:39] why brother brown said he could talk to
[1:22:40] a person in five minutes and know if
[1:22:41] they're a christian
[1:22:43] how much were you gonna talk in five
[1:22:44] minutes
[1:22:46] how much mysteries you could talk in
[1:22:47] five minutes
[1:22:49] how much hidden ones it could be in five
[1:22:51] minutes it's not the mysteries make you
[1:22:53] a christian it's christ
[1:22:57] it's christ
[1:22:58] it's the holy ghost makes you a
[1:23:00] christian
[1:23:01] oh holy christ in you
[1:23:03] the hope of glory
[1:23:05] peter was ignorant
[1:23:06] peter was unlearned
[1:23:08] but he had christ in him
[1:23:10] oh hallelujah christ coming to you
[1:23:13] oh hallelujah that's the gospel
[1:23:16] oh hallelujah praise god
[1:23:19] this is nothing right
[1:23:21] so the bride
[1:23:22] have to connect to the bright spirit
[1:23:24] that's right you hear what i'm saying
[1:23:26] the pride have to connect to the bright
[1:23:28] spirit
[1:23:29] isn't that right and once the bride
[1:23:30] connects to her spirit
[1:23:32] which is the husband
[1:23:34] which is the lord which is elohim seven
[1:23:37] perfect spirits bright spirits once you
[1:23:40] connect to that then that church spirit
[1:23:42] pulls away
[1:23:43] because the church spirit is a shock
[1:23:46] isn't that right
[1:23:47] hallelujah and the seed shall not be
[1:23:49] heir with the shock
[1:23:51] god of a special promise of inheritance
[1:23:53] for the seed of the righteous
[1:23:55] hallelujah praise god you will not
[1:23:57] inherit with what the church members are
[1:24:00] your inheritance is different isn't that
[1:24:01] right brother branham received his
[1:24:03] inheritance he was a manifested adopted
[1:24:05] son
[1:24:06] he demonstrated it hallelujah god was
[1:24:09] with him god spoke to him nobody had to
[1:24:12] explain whether he's not there's an old
[1:24:14] chinese proverb i might say it word for
[1:24:17] word there's an old chinese that say
[1:24:19] this it goes something like this
[1:24:21] the person who says it cannot be done
[1:24:25] should not stop or hinder the man who is
[1:24:27] doing it
[1:24:34] the person who says it cannot be done
[1:24:37] should not stop or hinder the person
[1:24:39] that is doing it the manifestation will
[1:24:41] be the interpretation every
[1:24:43] [Applause]
[1:24:48] hallelujah
[1:24:50] glory to god where's the point of making
[1:24:52] boasts and god not backing up one of the
[1:24:54] votes
[1:24:56] god not backing up words
[1:24:58] isn't that right god not backing that up
[1:25:00] that's why elijah calling that challenge
[1:25:02] let the quarter answer by fire let that
[1:25:04] god be good

[1:39:46] the eagles
[1:39:48] going to be carried together
[1:39:50] and we have the carcass this morning
[1:39:52] of the full body word

[1:40:18] but at branham for margin of earth
[1:40:20] now that the seeds are open amen the
[1:40:23] spirit of truth
[1:40:24] directs us to the word
[1:40:27] that explains why all the mixes have
[1:40:29] been made
[1:40:30] down to the ages because the seas was
[1:40:33] not open
[1:40:34] it was not revealed
[1:40:36] so the spirit of truth
[1:40:38] come to guide us
[1:40:40] so the dove
[1:40:41] came upon jesus
[1:40:43] to lead him amen into the wilderness
[1:40:47] that dove
[1:40:48] is coming again
[1:40:50] to lead the eagles
[1:40:52] it will be dove
[1:40:54] leading the eagles
[1:40:55] oh hallelujah
[1:40:57] are you with me
[1:40:59] so there are two systems at work isn't
[1:41:01] that right esau and jacob isn't that
[1:41:04] right
[1:41:05] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:41:08] hallelujah so what do you think the
[1:41:09] shock was for
[1:41:11] but abandoned said when the pentecostal
[1:41:12] first come out it was so close it was
[1:41:15] very likely possible what was it to do
[1:41:17] support the grain that's right
[1:41:20] so you're not vexed with your support
[1:41:23] you happy
[1:41:25] and value and treasure
[1:41:27] those that give you the support
[1:41:29] but as you grow
[1:41:31] as you spread and mature and they pull
[1:41:33] back they're giving you room
[1:41:35] to receive your inheritance
[1:41:37] so you're not upset when people pull
[1:41:39] away from you
[1:41:40] when people forsake you and leave you
[1:41:42] and abandon you and they don't have one
[1:41:43] nothing do it you they're giving you
[1:41:45] more room to grow
[1:41:47] don't weep for them
[1:41:49] they don't belong to what where you are
[1:41:51] going
[1:41:52] you are going to inherit god have a
[1:41:54] purpose for that
[1:41:55] for the shock to pull back
[1:41:58] is it not right
[1:41:59] whenever the messenger coming the
[1:42:01] messenger comes to bring birth pains and
[1:42:03] if a genuine fight for ministry come
[1:42:05] forward is to produce birth pains
[1:42:08] because the message world in lethargy
[1:42:10] the comfort zone everybody's settled now
[1:42:12] it's over 50 plus years since the
[1:42:14] prophet left and everybody's settled now
[1:42:16] i went to chile some people would tell
[1:42:18] me the tribulation some people are
[1:42:19] actually waiting they're waiting for the
[1:42:20] coming of the lord so they say
[1:42:22] did not consider what being prepared
[1:42:24] they just waiting for they come i was
[1:42:26] scared of that when i first came to this
[1:42:28] message i was scared to be like the
[1:42:30] pentecostal waiting for the rapture but
[1:42:32] they're living anyhow waiting for the
[1:42:34] rapture and doing anything i know they
[1:42:36] can't wait for the rapture there has to
[1:42:38] be a preparation
[1:42:39] god gave
[1:42:41] twenty year message that it will rain
[1:42:44] with the same sermon he just flavored
[1:42:46] this way this sunday next sunday add
[1:42:48] some more to it but at the end of it all
[1:42:50] the core was it was revealed
[1:42:52] it couldn't be challenged because we
[1:42:53] never felt before but noah stood with a
[1:42:55] message let me build the ark then he
[1:42:57] said come in and go and all your house
[1:42:59] into the act come into the act what's
[1:43:01] the message come into the holy ghost god
[1:43:04] even give noah a kind of queer thing
[1:43:07] given by somewhat ability act people had
[1:43:09] to laugh at him because they knew they
[1:43:11] would show off
[1:43:12] it poured us
[1:43:13] it absorbed
[1:43:15] but god had given all the revelation yet
[1:43:17] he given it in stages
[1:43:19] the revelation was it has to pitch the
[1:43:21] act
[1:43:21] and seal it
[1:43:23] to inside and outside to make it
[1:43:24] waterproof
[1:43:26] so god give that absorbent
[1:43:29] wood
[1:43:30] so it could receive a seal
[1:43:32] [Applause]
[1:43:36] and god has to break your spirit
[1:43:39] to make you absorbent
[1:43:44] because god wants to give you a seal
[1:43:47] a seal on the inside
[1:43:49] and a ceiling outside so going after
[1:43:52] bread
[1:43:53] [Applause]
[1:43:58] that's what i'm saying weakness
[1:44:00] weakness is not weak because you might
[1:44:01] be seized
[1:44:02] some people feel brokenness is
[1:44:04] defeat it's not really you're in tears
[1:44:07] you're the cross in the altar that
[1:44:08] doesn't mean
[1:44:09] jesus was in the garden of gethsemane
[1:44:11] and he was praying father his
[1:44:12] possibilities could pass
[1:44:14] and when that was interpreted by the
[1:44:15] prophet he said that is where the lion
[1:44:17] of the tribe of judah
[1:44:19] was prevailing tears
[1:44:22] hallelujah travailing
[1:44:24] disciples sleeping and he did travailing
[1:44:27] and that's the land of the tribe of
[1:44:29] judah conquering
[1:44:31] oh hallelujah humility you're conquering
[1:44:34] simplicity you're not conquering a lot
[1:44:36] of noise no no no
[1:44:37] the plant growing in the morning you
[1:44:39] don't have quick crack creek
[1:44:43] you don't hear leaf and flower
[1:44:44] blossoming no cool
[1:44:46] look at me

[1:52:21] climbing up high many of you know the
[1:52:23] vision about the indian chief riding
[1:52:24] with the wall to the west
[1:52:26] something attracted me off the big rock
[1:52:28] about noon time i said lay your hands
[1:52:31] against it and pray
[1:52:32] god in heaven knows that is true
[1:52:34] i laid my hands against the rock look up
[1:52:37] towards him and started praying
[1:52:38] i heard a voice coming out of the top of
[1:52:40] the rock said what are you leaning
[1:52:42] against over your heart and i raced back
[1:52:44] like this bare shoulders naked from my
[1:52:46] waist up hot i looked back and there was
[1:52:49] root in quartz in the stone white eagle
