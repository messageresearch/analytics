which means this his word which he is has been begin to be risen the word down through the age of luther wesley has begun to raise up to its power there begin to move moved a little more now it's coming up to identification see watch now to the life in the body is a vindication of the rapture is at hand when you see the headship and the body becoming one and the fullness of the measure of his

identified in him in the resurrection the same way that he is now now listen this means this here's the words what he hears they begin to raise again the word that through the age of wesley luther they began to arise with power as he started to move on and afterwards he moved a little bit more now he's getting to the identification now see watch it now it's getting to the point where life is in the skin which is a confirmation and that the rapture is nigh this is a confirmation that the rupture is tonight when you see the head and the body become one and the body is almost ready to be a receiver to the head then life is in the body it's a vindication that the rapture is nigh blessed be his only name our nation is falling apart israel is rising 5 38. now you mean what we see what i mean he began to give life to his body why the one who redeemed it the work of mediation is self-fulfilled now he brings his life to the body as the communication for the rapture as a medication for the rupture he brings us life to the body as a medication amen that the rupture is nigh men know himself that this this earth belongs not to him and nothing can hold him down on his earth and the life

this time we have a greeting from all of our precious minister and brothers amen so you amen you may have a seat amen and be blessed god bless you amen praise god god bless you all i would like to greet you in the name of the lord jesus christ i thank god for the privilege given to me through this platform to greet to greet you i would like to firstly thank pastor theovid from trinidad my god uh obviously we cannot see each other and we have never met possibly let me quote this famous saying from paul when he said but though i be absent in the flesh yet um am i with you in the spirit but there is a possibility though we have oceans and minds between us uh for the opportunity given to me to speak during 10 minutes i will do my best to speak in this time you know the ministers we love to speak on behalf of god of jesus speak to you and advising you as much as possible honestly let me say this i find myself too small the reason is that i didn't spend enough time in this message in comparison to many who came before me who fought great battles for years to bring this message to the people to add value to it you see when i mention the word message maybe some people will not understand why am i emphasizing this word message if the lord grants me one day to explain it to you it is good to introduce myself and tell you who am i two million people on a 2 400 square meters surface though it is a little highly but god found good to send us the message we have not been forgotten in the spreading of these bread descended from heaven of time that's the reason why brother branham said in the massive spiritual food inducing program and it gives me great pleasure to get to see when you know that you have a message from god is clear about it when we know that we have a message from god and we share it to the children welcoming gives us a great pleasure to see that it is the bread of heaven it's like jesus in john chapter 6 the bread of life this is what the message is to us today we welcome this message you cannot know how much it is for us i come from a pagan religion called talmud [Music] from when i was 16 years old my father met some people who went through christianity and i found myself on friday on a friday 1970 75 i found myself in the church listening to pastor and that was the first time i had to hear the word of god that was the first time they preached the bible to me the men were speaking about the prodigal son i was crying and wondering what it what is that book that which can make me cry solid and i finally i was called to go through the prayer line when it was my turn to go through it i was pounding i could hardly breathe the man asked me do you believe max 16. i didn't have a clue about max 16 he got it to me the chalet hands on the seat and they shall recover he said to me do you believe it i said yes i do i say yes like a child it was it was the fate of a child in ladies and gentlemen me and i was healed on the spot that happened in 1970 16 i was 16 years old and i'm 63 years old 40 years later i was never never suffered an asthma attack in my life to shorten my story i was a trinity assembly of god believer i spent the four years there i found out something was wrong with it i had a test for deepest thing leaving that church i joined the unitarian church i've been a pastor for nine years i was pastor of many churches even then i couldn't satisfy the death and hunger within me and finally after five years of a backsliding line i wanted to commit suicide i suffered for schizophrenia and depression i wanted to commit society when i was a unitarian pedicure believer i remember i was persecuting and then in 1993 i came across the message i started reading the message quickly i was sincerely sorry for all the troubles and difficulties i did to the merciful leaders i had to pay for it i tell you a six electroconvulsive therapies due to my sickness the doctors couldn't find what i was suffering from it is a long story it will take me time to tell it in the day the message was a turning point in my life and it turned my life around at night 1993. i have been in touch with this message for 29 years let me tell you the truth i've been going higher and higher concerning the theme of the convention which i love very much the life of christ 200 years story of mauritius i had a privilege to be allowed to go to prison and preach i was telling the prisoners you know nowadays the people are no more listening with their hears but they observe with the eyes they want to see how much the things you preach are literally lived in our lives the life of christ i really love the example of brother branham when he was speaking of a man a drinker he was walking on the street on a christmas but how much i can leave it it is not how much the message books i how my message i can carry but how much i can leave the message of christ which will attract people to realize that we are not just preachers but there is a light behind it behind our preaching our sermons so i believe this thing to be of interest a theme to think about i don't know yet who will preach in the convention i'm sure they will emphasize the messages on this very important theme and may we meet the requirements for the message we believe i would have loved to say a little more but let me go something to you before i close your there is a warning here when we preach on these kind of subjects i hope that some people will not go off on deep i mean that they will try by themselves to produce the life of jesus christ this can be dangerous doing so it can discourage or even disappoint those who will fail and it is just because they are trying to do it by themselves and sometimes when we speak about the life of christ people are trying to manufacture it but it is something natural in his heart we are not asked to manufacture something we are acting [Music] artificial this life of christ doesn't need to be manufactured many fail doing so in the pilgrimage trying to to manufacture to impersonate christianity one last call february 1963 but if you are alone another goal see lames is what it is they'll be separated someday manufacture the fruit of the spirit but to bear the fruit of the spirit and as long as it is a sheep it will burn it don't have to manufacture the cleanse and everything in it is the extra time i do i pray your conviction to succeed may god rich bless you as it will emphasize on the interpretation of the world in the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen oh praise god praise god praise god we appreciate those words of greetings hallelujah give the lord a hand of praise thank you my brother we appreciate those words god rich bless you amen amen amen praise god and welcome holy spirit [Music] fill us with your power live inside of me oh you surrendered him welcome holy spirit [Music] we are in your presence [Music] fill us with your power is that your prayer this morning [Applause] you're the living water you're the living water [Music] take complete control complete control oh you're the living ever flowing [Music] take complete control take complete control you're on the living water hallelujah [Music] holy spirit welcome holy spirit [Music] oh yes lord fill us with your powers live inside [Music] [Music] amen to bring him on to the minister god's word to his people amen we appreciate you brother peter and then god richard bless you and may your hearts be blessed today amen hallelujah one more time as we sing welcome [Music] fill us with your powers [Music] let's cut those hands and give god glory hallelujah hallelujah you can be seated god bless you god bless you all locally on site and also online we want to bring on behalf of my wife family and the ministry and the officers and the saints of lca a very warm greeting from london england to our precious pastor paul on anger wife and family and support workers and the church out in ivory coast we greet you with all of our hearts we appreciate this convention and the inspiration thereof dealing with the life of christ in you amen the virtue of christ the knowledge of christ the godliness of christ it's all been transfused supernaturally into the bride of christ so a very big greeting to one and all and all online that would be following we greet you and we appreciate each other in times like this a very uh warm appreciation to pastor theo ovitt and brother isaac overt and the amazing uh tech team in in trinidad who will be facilitating and i want to appreciate all the ministry who will contribute to this convention may god bless each and every one and may we have another victory in the love divine is my prayer for god's glory shall we stand as we go to the word of god today and we take our bibles praise be to god and uh we're just gonna start with genesis 5 24. and enoch walked with god and he was not for god took him [Music] [Music] it goes beyond just a quoting it's a walk a walk with god acts 2 24. whom god hath raised up having loosed the pains of death because it was not possible that he should be holding of it how shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation which at the first began to be spoken by the lord and was confirmed or vindicated unto us by them that heard him god also bearing them witness both with signs and wonders and with diverse miracles and gifts of the holy ghost according to his own will come on manifested and we have seen it and bear witness and show unto you that eternal life which was with the father and was manifested onto us hallelujah let's bow our heads in a word of prayer lord in the name of jesus christ we thank you for that the prophet said it's a thunder that shakes the devil oh the life behind the name god we give you glory and praise that we could understand these things that it has been manifested unto us and now lord i pray that this uh small contribution may bless the convention both on site and online we give you glory and honor keep us by your power lord we give you praise and the lord may you be glorified and oh god we all have individual messages but thank you that we're all centralized around one message that vindicated message in jesus christ's name amen and amen praise the lord you can be seated and online as well may god bless you richly and trusting that bro god is bringing us to a place where we can't disbelieve any longer praise be to god we're at an hour where god is going to move amen and my title today is the true easter vindication we've all heard the message true easter seal and with that in mind we talk about the true easter vindication because if the same spirit that rose christ from the dead dwell in you it shall quicken your mortal bodies hallelujah more about that later on we give god the glory for the message like this amen that can be vindicated about [Music] the picture we all know and as we go forward i want to start with this opening statement vindication of omnipotence that the world has ever known how many believe that that is nothing but the truth we're on the threshold amen the greatest vindication of omnipotence that the world has ever known i hope the children and the young people because it belongs to them too it is revealed to our children also and the prophet goes that that cain was just as religious as abel they both built altars they both loved god they both made sacrifices they both pay [Music] which is the revelation the word of god revealed made plain showed out amen and vindicated bananas but god never vindicated it amen but god required worship cain made the offering that god didn't vindicate the virtue of jesus christ the godliness of jesus christ and the love of god which is jesus christ amen that's what shakes the devil is the life behind the name praise moses amen he was vindicated he went down to egypt you remember he was challenged in the house of pharaoh and uh the film records this statement a cheap magician's trick but god knew amen and his stick was more powerful than the armies of egypt praise be to god moses was vindicated amen with the god of heaven behind him and he performed that miracle praise the lord amen and we know that this is a reality because god trusted moses he gave him that vindication another example if you like of course elijah amen was uh i think a great example because this was the mount carmel uh showdown you wait till we strike the mount zion showdown oh man that's going to shut a lot of mouse and when elijah lay the bullock upon there and poured and here it is if you if you say you're a believer god vindicates it you don't have to presume vindication is the opposite to presuming amen it's it's god who consumes he said you don't have to presume that's right it is a vindication and when god came down they screamed out he is the god he is the god hallelujah and the prophets of baal had to run amen amen and it's the same thing today oh the false hoods amen it's a very good one as brother branham talked about the temple you could not make the temple anyway because there was a specific instruction make the temple because thy will be done the pillar of fire came in and the priest couldn't even minister oh my god it was a what a vindication that was you can't just do things your way like we we say like frank sinatra i did it my way you can't do it your way you've got to do it god's way amen he said this is my way it is the harder way but this is that which will bring and come to pass the glorious victory in the love divine because it is his way praise be to god what can we say to these things we have to do it the according to the pattern god will vindicate his pattern amen and look how brother says it in a message called dedication for its resting place glory upon the whole building and the glory was so great till the priests couldn't even minister because you've got to allow the world to come in when as well hallelujah glory to his name the glory was so great the priest couldn't even minister what a great vindication that was now you see the vindication we've given you examples of of moses of elijah of solomon's temple there are many more but i want to just back up one step and go back to moses when he smoked a rock and the water came was he vindicated that's an interesting question because in reality the water came because god respected the gift but he made the biggest mistake that he could have ever made [Music] he said regardless if it wasn't god's will we know it wasn't god's will we admit that but watch moses had power to bring it he says whether it was god's will or not is that true we know it was against god's word but god had entrusted his servant with was he vindicated is that always vindication when we use the word vindicated we have to be careful because god has to check you out even as abraham had to pass his final test final test amen and then it was said to him your seed shall possess the gates of his enemies these are great things to reflect on let's give god a big hallelujah a man god bless you online amen i want to go into here now jesus the day john baptized him god vindicated him amen the dove came down he didn't do that god did that god spoke from heaven john saw him coming in the form of a dove immediately anointed with god [Applause] one of these days you shall become god man so when this vindication happens it's a very great uh it's a very great signal that god is approving of you confirming amen amen another example the greatest ministry of them all had had seen jesus in a pile of fire and commissioned him to do what he done paul who could question paul we have to appropriate ourselves to the ministry of paul that is our template that's what we are watching but now let me come to another hallelujah i go to this slide with the greatest of pleasure what about our day what about our day church let me tell you it will be a prophet a vindicated message hallelujah i am so glad everybody i'm so glad to be one of them to be identified and this message has rapturing faith in it because this man because because this man will of necessity have the capstone prophetic ministry a this man will have the capstone prophetic minister minister because he is one to introduce but god will show him then he said he's here now i take every spirit under my control praise be to god god will speak for him by the voice of the science senior praise be to god i give god praise to to know these things and to know what it what vindication really really means amen god is real and he's got this capsule prophetic message and when love projects because grace just takes over you can't even explain it if love can project that's [Music] that amen coming down there to complete everything praise be to god what can we say to these things he says now listen to brother branham i've said some things that might have been kind of strange this is the seven seal here he admits you know some things he said kind of strength the prophet he says look some things might have been strange to some people sorry it might have been strange but when god comes around behind it and vindicated and says it is the truth then that is god's word and then it goes into those uh the seven consecutive thunders and the mystery laying behind those seven consecutive thunders rolling out this is how the seven seal was broken hey man and here i love this he admits it's uh what uh kind of strength but it's vindicated and we give god glory it will happen by itself praise be to god because they are the thunders of jesus praise be to god i want you to notice here the holy spirit today the manifestation of the holy spirit is that angel sit on amen
