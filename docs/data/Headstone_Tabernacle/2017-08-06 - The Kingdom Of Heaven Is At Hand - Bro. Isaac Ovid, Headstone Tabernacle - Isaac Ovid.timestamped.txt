[47:17] church says amen and amen and amen so
[47:22] greetings once again if you have your
[47:23] Bibles would you turn with me to two
[47:25] portions of scripture reading both uh
[47:28] within the book of St Matthew we want to
[47:31] read from Matthew
[47:32] 3 and we're going to read from uh St
[47:36] Matthew 4 as
[47:42] well s Matthew
[47:49] 3 from verse one in Matthew 3 from verse
[47:52] 1 and in those days Came John the
[47:55] Baptist preaching ing in the wilderness
[47:58] of Judea and saying repent ye for the
[48:03] Kingdom of Heaven is at hand and reading
[48:08] from St Matthew chapter 4 reading from
[48:11] verse 10 now this is after Jesus is
[48:15] tempted of the devil from verse 10 then
[48:17] say Jesus unto him get thee hand Satan
[48:20] for it is written Thou shalt Worship the
[48:22] Lord thy God and him only shalt thou
[48:25] serve then the devil leaveth him and
[48:27] behold Angels Came and ministered unto
[48:30] him now when Jesus had heard that John
[48:33] was cast into prison he departed into
[48:35] Galilee and leaving Nazareth he came and
[48:38] dwelt in capernium which is upon the Sea
[48:40] Coast in the borders of zabulon and
[48:42] nepalm that it might be fulfilled which
[48:45] was spoken by isaas the prophet saying
[48:47] the land of zabulon and the land of
[48:50] nepalm by the way of the sea Beyond
[48:52] Jordan Galilee of the Gentiles the
[48:56] people which sat in darkness saw great
[48:58] light and to them which sat in the
[49:00] region and shadow of death light is
[49:02] sprung up from that time Jesus began to
[49:05] preach and to say repent for the Kingdom
[49:08] of Heaven is at hand may the Lord add a
[49:11] blessing to the reading of his word you
[49:13] may be seated in the presence of the
[49:16] Lord this morning and I trust that you
[49:19] are happy to be in the house of the Lord
[49:21] happy to be in the presence of the Lord
[49:23] there are so many people who don't have
[49:25] the Blessed privilege
[49:27] that we do to be in the house of God
[49:29] this morning there are so many people
[49:32] they are tied down to hospital beds
[49:34] there are so many people tie down into
[49:36] all kinds of different conditions and it
[49:38] is such a blessed privilege to be able
[49:41] to lift Your Hands In Worship be able to
[49:43] sing the songs of Zion and to be able to
[49:46] escape for a few hours from the cares of
[49:49] life and the hustle and the bustle and
[49:51] the routine and and and having to wake
[49:53] up in the morning to go to work it's
[49:55] it's good to to go to work and make
[49:56] money but there's more to life than
[49:58] going to work there's there's something
[50:00] more important than paying bills there's
[50:02] something more important than paying
[50:03] rent and morgage there's there's
[50:05] something more important than this
[50:07] natural life that we live in can the
[50:09] church say Amen so I have a message this
[50:13] morning my title is the Kingdom of
[50:15] Heaven is at hand and a and for my
[50:18] subject citizens of the kingdom and an
[50:21] inspiration only perfect love can enter
[50:24] in can the church say amen so we read
[50:28] the scripture in Matthew 3 where John
[50:30] the Baptist he came and forun Christ as
[50:33] we all know isn't that right and he
[50:35] preached a message repent the Kingdom of
[50:38] Heaven is at hand when John was
[50:41] preaching that message it was a message
[50:43] of possibility it was a message of hope
[50:47] it was a message the people had never
[50:48] heard before the Kingdom of Heaven is at
[50:51] hand most people who heard John
[50:53] preaching didn't understand what he was
[50:55] talking about but John was doing as he
[50:58] was led by the spirit under the spirit
[51:01] of Elijah to forign Christ and he was
[51:03] preaching repent for the Kingdom of
[51:05] Heaven is at hand he broke the mold he
[51:08] broke the routine he went against the
[51:10] way the other ministers were ministering
[51:13] he went against the way everybody else
[51:15] was teaching repent for the Kingdom of
[51:17] Heaven is at hand many people of that
[51:20] day didn't know they even needed to
[51:23] repent they were so used to their
[51:25] rituals so used to their Traditions so
[51:28] used to going into the temple and give
[51:31] and giving up their offering and their
[51:33] sacrifice But Here Comes John repent
[51:35] that the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand a
[51:39] message of possibility a message of Hope
[51:41] message of redemption a message a way
[51:43] out a message to give people the the the
[51:46] the the the inspiration to do something
[51:48] different but it was also a message of
[51:50] judgment because whenever God gives a
[51:52] message his message always comes in
[51:55] twofold Mercy and judgment always comes
[51:58] together to accept it is Mercy to reject
[52:01] it is Judgment so John was standing
[52:03] there repent for the Kingdom of Heaven
[52:06] is at hand hallu can the church say amen
[52:10] and from the days of John that message
[52:13] still applies to today the Kingdom of
[52:16] Heaven is at hand now the world has had
[52:19] many
[52:20] kingdoms the Kingdom of Egypt the
[52:23] kingdom of Babylon the kingdom of the
[52:26] and Persians the kingdom of the Greeks
[52:29] and the kingdom of the Romans and later
[52:32] yet still after John would have died and
[52:34] gone on we would hear of the kingdom of
[52:36] France and the kingdom of Spain and the
[52:39] United
[52:41] Kingdom but this Kingdom we're talking
[52:43] about this morning is not like any of
[52:45] these kingdoms this is a different
[52:48] Kingdom we are talking about the Kingdom
[52:50] of Heaven hallah the kingdom that the
[52:53] whole of creation has been waiting for
[52:56] and years we've been hearing it's at
[52:58] hand it's at hand means I could reach it
[53:01] it means I could touch it it's it's
[53:03] within reach it's the Kingdom of Heaven
[53:06] it's at hand it's it's just a couple
[53:08] millimeters away it's it's just right
[53:11] there when you enter into the economy of
[53:14] God measurement and Mathematics changes
[53:16] brother Shane so when Jesus said the
[53:18] Kingdom of Heaven is at hand he was not
[53:21] speaking in our time because he's not a
[53:23] creature of time he said a thousand
[53:29] a thousand years it's like a Daye ACC
[53:32] God the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand can
[53:35] the church say Amen you may be seated
[53:37] are we here this morning are we in the
[53:39] house of God this
[53:41] [Applause]
[53:43] morning so this Kingdom of the kir that
[53:45] we are speaking about there are many
[53:48] similarities to other kingdoms amen
[53:53] amen this Kingdom of Heaven is similar
[53:56] to other kingdoms because the Kingdom of
[53:59] Heaven has a king that's right that's
[54:02] and natural kingdoms also have
[54:05] Kings hallelujah it's also similar to
[54:09] Natural kingdoms because there's a royal
[54:12] [Applause]
[54:16] family and power only moves from a king
[54:20] to a member of the Royal Family
[54:25] [Applause]
[54:27] and the thing of it is it doesn't matter
[54:29] how sometimes that member of the royal
[54:31] family acts the fact that they are part
[54:33] of the royal family bring certain
[54:37] privileges bring certain
[54:40] benefits there are certain things that
[54:42] just come with the territory you cannot
[54:45] be the son of the king and and not have
[54:47] security you cannot be the son of the
[54:49] king and not be escorted you cannot be
[54:53] the son of the king and not have the red
[54:55] carpet roll out for
[55:00] you you may be seated for a minute when
[55:03] you study the quote unquote modern
[55:06] kingdoms of the world when when Prince
[55:08] whatever his name was I can't remember
[55:10] got married the whole world said almost
[55:11] a billion people was connected who was
[55:13] it Kate and who will and Kate that's
[55:16] right and the whole world paused and
[55:19] stopped in awe because a ceremony was
[55:23] taking place to marry somebody in the
[55:26] Royal
[55:27] family and there were parades and there
[55:29] were trumpets and there were cars and
[55:32] there were horses and there was red
[55:34] carpet and there was all kinds of stuff
[55:36] because the child of royalty was getting
[55:40] married and if man in all of his glory
[55:43] can put that kind of
[55:46] display for moments of
[55:49] Celebration how much more about this
[55:52] Kingdom that we are talking about when
[55:55] there's a reason to celebrate when one
[55:58] Soul comes back to God there's a
[56:01] celebration if you could only open your
[56:04] eyes this
[56:06] morning to see the parade that passed
[56:09] here this morning to see the trumpets
[56:13] that blew here this morning before you
[56:16] enter this building Angels had already
[56:19] lined up because
[56:22] royalty royalty was coming into the
[56:25] house of God oh can I get a
[56:31] witness Hall you may be seated so there
[56:35] are
[56:35] similarities between these natural
[56:38] kingdoms and this Kingdom we are talking
[56:40] about this
[56:44] morning in this Kingdom there's an
[56:48] army how could you have a kingdom
[56:50] without an army because you need to
[56:53] protect your
[56:54] domain you need to prot protect your
[56:57] subjects you need to protect your land
[57:00] so this Kingdom of Heaven also has an
[57:04] army can the church say amen and because
[57:09] Elisha was a citizen of that Kingdom
[57:12] when they went out to investigate who
[57:15] was happening to find out what was
[57:17] happening in the secret chambers of the
[57:20] king of Syria anybody with me and they
[57:23] say we don't know who telling the
[57:25] children of Israel what's going on they
[57:27] say we suspect is that man Elisha he's
[57:30] always praying he's always in the spirit
[57:32] he's always on
[57:35] fire and when they send the Syrian Army
[57:38] to surround him the little boy the
[57:40] little servant with Elija got so scared
[57:43] he said what are we going to
[57:45] do and Elisha told that servant Open
[57:48] Lord open up this boy's eyes and when he
[57:50] opened up the boy eyes and he looked
[57:53] around he saw the Army from the kingdom
[57:55] he but wait a minute they are more for
[57:58] us than against
[58:01] us and that's because Elijah was a
[58:04] citizen of the
[58:06] Kingdom you may be
[58:09] seated we can we talk about his kingdom
[58:13] you may be see I want you to understand
[58:15] why I'm kneeling it down this morning
[58:17] because John the Baptist when he was
[58:20] preaching he didn't say repent for a
[58:22] church is at hand come
[58:25] on and when Jesus was finished dealing
[58:28] with the devil and said get there behind
[58:30] me Satan he continued and picked up
[58:32] John's message and said repent for the
[58:35] Kingdom of Heaven is at hand Jesus
[58:38] didn't come to start a church or start a
[58:40] group he came to introduce a kingdom and
[58:44] to remind you as Royal seeds of Abraham
[58:47] that you belong to a kingdom you don't
[58:50] belong to a church you don't belong to a
[58:53] group you don't belong to a pastor you
[58:55] are Sons and Daughters of the king of
[58:58] kings the Lord of lords he is mighty in
[59:03] battle royal blood flows through your
[59:06] veins oh somebody say Amen somebody say
[59:12] hallelujah you may be
[59:15] seated and because you are royalty you
[59:18] have to act a certain way before will
[59:21] what is it where princess what Kate Kate
[59:25] Kate
[59:26] before Princess Kate could get married
[59:29] to Prince Will she had to go to
[59:32] Etiquette training because she had not
[59:35] grown up in the Royal house but to be
[59:37] able to do the Royal things she had to
[59:39] be royally trained so that she could do
[59:42] the right things and not embarrass the
[59:45] throne because the throne has to be
[59:47] protected the kingdom has to be
[59:50] protected the monarchy has to be
[59:52] protected and God is also interested in
[59:55] protecting his monarchy he is interested
[59:58] in protecting his throne he's interested
[1:00:00] in protecting his kingdom so all these
[1:00:03] years we have been under training under
[1:00:06] the ministry of the word and how to
[1:00:09] behave ourselves how to conduct
[1:00:11] ourselves because the kingdom cannot
[1:00:14] come into view until we are in position
[1:00:16] to step into the kingdom and take our
[1:00:20] position in the
[1:00:24] Kingdom you may be
[1:00:28] seated I'm just here to encourage you
[1:00:31] this morning so the kingdom has an army
[1:00:34] Hallelujah whose role and rank and and
[1:00:37] and and role is to protect to defend
[1:00:42] right
[1:00:43] hallelujah our kingdom has an
[1:00:46] economy Hallelujah every Kingdom has an
[1:00:51] economy and it has a
[1:00:53] currency and I said in our convention
[1:00:57] the currency of our economy is
[1:01:00] different we have a different currency
[1:01:02] we don't need to take out dollar bills
[1:01:04] to pay for stuff in our economy in our
[1:01:07] in our kingdom you speak the
[1:01:10] word hallu our currency is spoken word
[1:01:13] our currency is faith if you shall say
[1:01:15] to this mountain you don't need to call
[1:01:18] moonan moving Mountain you don't need to
[1:01:20] call whoever else moving stuff now you
[1:01:22] don't need to call them and pay them if
[1:01:23] you shall say to this mountain Peter
[1:01:26] removed and cast in the sea there's no
[1:01:29] excavator tractor truck that can do what
[1:01:32] you could do if you have faith like a
[1:01:35] mustard seed to activate the spoken word
[1:01:38] power that was locked up inside of you
[1:01:41] before there was a moon be before there
[1:01:43] was a star be before you had a problem
[1:01:46] be before you had a trial that seed germ
[1:01:49] was placed inside of your soul what
[1:01:52] devil what demon What Spirit could take
[1:01:55] it out of you you are predestinated to
[1:01:58] be a son and daughter of the most high
[1:02:01] can the church say
[1:02:03] Amen the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand
[1:02:07] Get Ready Get Ready Get Ready oh
[1:02:10] Hallelujah can we give the Lord a hand
[1:02:12] of
[1:02:17] Praise we're going somewhere this is
[1:02:19] just the
[1:02:21] background every Kingdom has laws
[1:02:26] and the laws is to govern
[1:02:28] Behavior the laws is to keep things in
[1:02:32] check and if natural man would have
[1:02:35] laws laws like
[1:02:38] treason there certain Kingdom if you
[1:02:40] speak against the king that TR in jail
[1:02:42] one time
[1:02:44] life
[1:02:47] sword it's
[1:02:49] true laws to protect Hallelujah laws to
[1:02:53] keep people in order
[1:02:58] so why should it be any
[1:03:00] different that this Kingdom also has
[1:03:03] laws the laws are not what we put in
[1:03:06] place the laws are the laws of the
[1:03:09] Kingdom because God put the laws in
[1:03:12] place to keep his kingdom in
[1:03:15] order so if you are a citizen of that
[1:03:18] Kingdom once the word comes forth and
[1:03:21] it's the law of God you readily take it
[1:03:24] because God told Joshua meditate on this
[1:03:26] Lord day and night and you shall have
[1:03:29] good success in other words God didn't
[1:03:33] want Joshua to forget the words of the
[1:03:35] law amen and the law is to guide you in
[1:03:38] how to act how to move when you should
[1:03:42] do certain things how you should conduct
[1:03:44] yourself how you should resolve conflict
[1:03:47] that's what the law is for kend the
[1:03:50] church
[1:03:52] amen in the Kingdom there are servants
[1:03:55] in the Kingdom
[1:03:56] but you are not servants this morning
[1:03:58] I'm not speaking to servants this
[1:04:00] morning I'm speaking to Sons and
[1:04:02] Daughters of the
[1:04:04] king and because you are Sons and
[1:04:06] Daughters of the king you have certain
[1:04:09] benefits amen and with the brandom said
[1:04:12] the problem with many of us we are
[1:04:14] living under our god-given rights we are
[1:04:17] living under our privileges in other
[1:04:19] words there are benefits for us that we
[1:04:21] are not even accessing because we are so
[1:04:24] caught up in our problem and in our
[1:04:26] trial and our limitation and feeling
[1:04:28] sorry for ourselves but when you
[1:04:31] understand that the kingdom is here now
[1:04:33] and the kingdom is within you all of a
[1:04:35] sudden you recognize that there are
[1:04:36] certain benefits you have access to
[1:04:39] certain things and can the church
[1:04:43] amen so there are many similarities
[1:04:46] between this Kingdom and natural
[1:04:47] kingdoms but there are also some
[1:04:50] differences because in this Kingdom
[1:04:52] there is no hatred in this Kingdom we're
[1:04:54] talking about there's no jealousy in
[1:04:56] this Kingdom there'll be no sin in this
[1:04:59] Kingdom in this Kingdom there'll only be
[1:05:01] Joy there'll be no crying in this
[1:05:03] Kingdom there'll be no sighing in this
[1:05:05] Kingdom there'll be no up and down in
[1:05:07] this Kingdom this kingdom is is a
[1:05:10] kingdom that never had a beginning so it
[1:05:12] will never have an ending it's an
[1:05:14] eternal Kingdom can the church say
[1:05:18] amen hallelujah so friends don't lose
[1:05:22] sight of the importance of why we are
[1:05:25] here this morning morning we are not
[1:05:26] here to build Church we're not here to
[1:05:28] have church there are many people going
[1:05:30] to church this morning and they will not
[1:05:32] be in the
[1:05:40] Kingdom good church
[1:05:42] members good Church
[1:05:45] Believers they love the Lord you
[1:05:48] know but they are not citizens of the
[1:05:52] Kingdom amen amen they are good church
[1:05:54] members
[1:05:56] friends the world is preparing for a
[1:05:58] funeral
[1:06:00] service and the foolish virgin is
[1:06:02] preparing for the
[1:06:06] tribulation but the wise virgin is
[1:06:09] preparing to step into that Kingdom the
[1:06:12] wise virgin is preparing for a Rapture
[1:06:14] the wise virgin is preparing for the
[1:06:16] wedding supper the wise virgin is
[1:06:19] preparing for the
[1:06:22] resurrection why are you speaking about
[1:06:24] the wise and foolish because Jesus
[1:06:25] himself said the
[1:06:27] kingdom is like unto 10 virgins come on
[1:06:31] now so as Jesus was speaking about the
[1:06:33] kingdom he was bringing Parables and
[1:06:36] examples so that in
[1:06:38] 2017 we will not be caught
[1:06:41] unawares and take for granted that
[1:06:43] because we are in the message we are all
[1:06:45] right take for granted because we
[1:06:48] believe God s a prophet it's going to be
[1:06:51] okay he said the Kingdom of Heaven is
[1:06:53] like unto 10 virgins and five were wise
[1:06:56] and five were foolish they were all
[1:06:59] virgins they were all Sanctified they
[1:07:02] were all living good but some were wise
[1:07:05] and some were
[1:07:06] foolish they were all in church but some
[1:07:08] were wise and some were foolish they all
[1:07:11] believe God sent a prophet but some were
[1:07:13] wise and some were foolish they all
[1:07:16] believed in the Rapture but some were
[1:07:18] wise and some were foolish they all
[1:07:20] believed judgment was coming but some
[1:07:23] were wise and some were
[1:07:27] foolish they knew that God is real but
[1:07:30] some were wise and some were foolish
[1:07:34] they knew they were supposed to be in
[1:07:35] church but some were wise and some were
[1:07:38] foolish they were virgins they were pure
[1:07:41] but some were wise and some were foolish
[1:07:44] they all knew the message but some were
[1:07:47] wise and some were foolish they all
[1:07:50] believed it but some were
[1:07:52] wise and some were foolish
[1:07:58] the Kingdom of Heaven is like unto these
[1:08:01] 10 virgins this
[1:08:05] morning you must be able to answer for
[1:08:08] yourself if you are wise or if you are
[1:08:12] foolish it's not a subjective thing
[1:08:17] that's
[1:08:18] right on it's not left up to speculation
[1:08:21] what's wise and what's foolish the Bible
[1:08:24] makes it very
[1:08:27] clear the difference between the wise
[1:08:30] and the
[1:08:32] foolish the difference between the wise
[1:08:34] and the foolish was not in how many
[1:08:36] services they
[1:08:38] attended the difference between the wise
[1:08:41] and the foolish was not in who the
[1:08:43] pastor was the difference between the
[1:08:45] wise and the foolish was not how long
[1:08:48] they were in the message the difference
[1:08:50] between the wise and the foolish was
[1:08:52] that if they were jumping all service
[1:08:58] [Applause]
[1:09:04] nothing to do Hallelujah with that at
[1:09:07] all the difference between the wise and
[1:09:09] the foolish was nothing to do with
[1:09:11] conventions and rituals and
[1:09:14] ceremonies Hallelujah but there was a
[1:09:16] cry went out behold the bridegroom
[1:09:21] coming go out to meet him
[1:09:25] and those that were wise the Bible said
[1:09:28] had
[1:09:29] [Music]
[1:09:31] oil not just had oil but they had
[1:09:38] extra they had something more than just
[1:09:41] the
[1:09:42] [Applause]
[1:09:47] oil those that were foolish they
[1:09:49] understood the oil but they had no
[1:09:53] extra amen amen
[1:09:56] what brother brandom teach us he said
[1:09:57] oil signifies the Holy Ghost the Holy
[1:10:01] Ghost Hallelujah so the wise were
[1:10:04] interested in getting more of this holy
[1:10:06] ghost
[1:10:08] thing we can't afford to run out of this
[1:10:11] holy ghost thing we can't get enough of
[1:10:14] this Holy Ghost we cannot be satisfied
[1:10:18] with one touch we need a refilling and
[1:10:21] brother Bram taught us the Dynamics of
[1:10:23] this church would be a refilling of the
[1:10:25] Holy Ghost a refilling of what was
[1:10:28] worked in a small
[1:10:30] measure but now it's greater it's more
[1:10:34] powerful it's all over me it's all
[1:10:37] inside of me
[1:10:43] it's can't afford to run out can't be
[1:10:47] satisfied with being a church member can
[1:10:50] be satisfied with just coming to church
[1:10:53] I need oil I need to Holy Ghost I need
[1:10:56] an experience I need to get a touch I
[1:10:59] need God to fill this vessel can't
[1:11:02] afford to run out because the Kingdom of
[1:11:04] Heaven is at hand we got to go out to
[1:11:07] meet
[1:11:09] [Applause]
[1:11:20] him I pray that this will help you this
[1:11:24] morning
[1:11:26] in some way Hallelujah to get
[1:11:30] extra we need extra we need
[1:11:34] more so if you're used to praying a
[1:11:37] certain amount you got to pray more if
[1:11:40] you want more are you with
[1:11:43] me anybody who's into working out
[1:11:47] exercise know that after a while your
[1:11:49] body if you're used to doing 10 push-ups
[1:11:52] after a while the 10 push-ups has no
[1:11:54] effect on you
[1:11:55] because your body gets accustomed to
[1:11:57] doing 10 push-ups so if you get want to
[1:11:59] get more results you got to do more
[1:12:01] push-ups you got to do 15 and they got
[1:12:03] to do 20 why because your body will get
[1:12:06] adjusted and to get more results you
[1:12:09] have to put out more
[1:12:12] effort everybody with me you want to
[1:12:15] pass an exam you want to there are those
[1:12:17] who just want to pass you
[1:12:19] know just happy woo I pass what was he
[1:12:22] pass Mark if you just get 60 you pass I
[1:12:25] get
[1:12:27] 60 there are those that are happy with
[1:12:30] that but there are those who want to
[1:12:32] excel amen amen they don't want to just
[1:12:36] pass you see the problem with just
[1:12:37] passing is that it's one point between
[1:12:39] failure and
[1:12:40] success that's too close to comfort for
[1:12:43] me because if you mess up once it's 59
[1:12:46] and you
[1:12:47] fail so I want to work to excel so I
[1:12:51] getting 72 78 81 so if I miss it I drop
[1:12:55] down to 69 70 there's no possibility of
[1:12:59] me failing this exam and there are many
[1:13:02] people in the message are living to be
[1:13:07] pass they want to get 60 they just want
[1:13:10] to do the minimum entry
[1:13:13] requirements to make this
[1:13:16] Rapture that's why some people ask what
[1:13:18] are the rules of the
[1:13:20] church what they need to do because they
[1:13:22] just want to Bear pass
[1:13:25] they don't want to make sure that they
[1:13:27] inter Raptor they just want to be you

[1:14:29] you're not making it important enough to
[1:14:31] have a prayer life because what you make
[1:14:34] important you find time to do that's
[1:14:37] right that's right oh can I get a
[1:14:38] witness in the
[1:14:40] house give us back the oldtime religion
[1:14:43] it's good enough for me it's good enough
[1:14:45] for
[1:14:46] you years ago people spend hours praying
[1:14:50] every day every day
[1:14:55] if we talk to God as much times as
[1:14:57] Facebook say people go on to
[1:15:00] Facebook you you you'll be
[1:15:03] [Music]
[1:15:05] Invincible brother R said we could sing
[1:15:07] too much we could shout too much we can
[1:15:09] never pray too
[1:15:12] much and prayer is that communication
[1:15:14] that relationship with
[1:15:17] God it's a relationship it's not thee
[1:15:20] thou thy thine it's not that it's that
[1:15:22] communication with God
[1:15:26] Lord I worship you Lord I love
[1:15:29] you Lord I woke up this morning and I
[1:15:31] had this little pain in my shoulder but
[1:15:32] I speak against it and I'm walking out
[1:15:34] to work to be an overcomer today and you
[1:15:36] talking you talking let people think
[1:15:38] you're crazy but you having a
[1:15:40] conversation with god because that's
[1:15:43] where your strength comes
[1:15:44] from that's where your encouragement
[1:15:47] comes from here do I walk to the Valley
[1:15:49] of the shadow of DEA fear or evil you
[1:15:52] walking down Fredick Street and you
[1:15:54] talking to your if you talking to the
[1:15:56] Lord there's an anointing around you
[1:15:58] there's an atmosphere around you what
[1:16:00] demon could break that barrier when you
[1:16:02] are covered by the blood and you are
[1:16:05] speaking and walking into your promises
[1:16:08] give us more Christians like that can
[1:16:11] the church say
[1:16:12] amen amen hallelujah in the message
[1:16:16] modern events are made clear by
[1:16:19] prophecy I'm taking my time this
[1:16:21] morning the pastor told me not to rush
[1:16:24] we do have a flight to catch this
[1:16:26] evening but we we going to we're going
[1:16:29] to do what the Lord wants us to do this
[1:16:31] morning because the Kingdom of Heaven is
[1:16:33] at hand amen and the nearer we get to
[1:16:36] the kingdom of heaven then the rules of
[1:16:38] the Kingdom takes over the rules of this
[1:16:40] world so if this service is 5 hours that
[1:16:42] plane will have to wait because sons of
[1:16:46] the king need to be on that plane and
[1:16:49] the Pilot Air Force controller are
[1:16:52] subject to this Kingdom that that we
[1:16:54] represent it's a Kingdom of the most
[1:16:56] high that's why when the doctors give up
[1:16:58] on you we could overrule the
[1:17:01] doctor
[1:17:05] overruled when the bank says you can't
[1:17:07] get the loan we could overrule the
[1:17:10] bank when they say you can't buy the
[1:17:12] house we could overrule the real estate
[1:17:14] agent when you trying to get the best
[1:17:16] price God could overrule that price and
[1:17:19] give you your price because you are
[1:17:21] citizens of the kingdom and there are
[1:17:23] certain benefits you access to you are
[1:17:26] supposed to be happy you are supposed to
[1:17:29] be on fire you are supposed to have good
[1:17:31] success no weapon formed against you

[1:17:38] the Kingdom oh the joy of the Lord is
[1:17:41] your strength that's the benefit of the
[1:17:45] Kingdom I was young now I'm old I've

[1:18:37] frustration is not my promise being fed
[1:18:40] up is not my promise being pushed around
[1:18:42] by the devil that's not my promise it's
[1:18:44] time we push the devil around it's time
[1:18:46] when we walk the devil and say I'm
[1:18:48] crossing the street because a son from
[1:18:51] the kingdom is walking Frederick's
[1:18:53] Street there are sons being activated
[1:18:56] their sons being
[1:18:58] activated Oh

[1:19:02] hallelujah
[1:19:04] hallelujah oh you may be seated it has
[1:19:08] always been God's
[1:19:09] way to let his people know what's going
[1:19:12] to happen before it happens he doesn't
[1:19:16] let everybody know but he lets his
[1:19:18] people no are predestinated people are
[1:19:21] called out people are chosen people amen
[1:19:25] friends I want to kneel this

[1:20:03] God bless and we have these things
[1:20:06] locked
[1:20:09] down but the real thing about being a
[1:20:12] citizen of the
[1:20:13] kingdom and I spoke this in Nigeria and
[1:20:16] I spoke to the young people is what
[1:20:17] really happens what I call
[1:20:20] between Sundays
[1:20:23] [Music]
[1:20:25] [Applause]
[1:20:28] because right now everybody looking like
[1:20:30] the
[1:20:31] [Music]
[1:20:35] pass look at your neighbor they look
[1:20:37] like the
[1:20:39] [Applause]
[1:20:40] [Music]
[1:20:44] [Applause]
[1:20:46] past but you know brother brandom
[1:20:49] preached one time about
[1:20:52] that slave
[1:20:55] owner that had a conversation with
[1:20:57] somebody who was looking to buy slaves
[1:20:58] and he walked and he looked around
[1:21:01] and he didn't see anybody he wanted and
[1:21:03] then he saw one guy just was just
[1:21:06] different and he asked the slave owner
[1:21:08] is is that one for sale and the owner
[1:21:10] said no he's not for
[1:21:11] sale he asked the question does he sleep
[1:21:15] somewhere different he said no he sleeps
[1:21:17] where all the other slaves sleep does he
[1:21:19] eat something different no he eats the
[1:21:21] same thing that everybody else eat does
[1:21:24] he have a work schedule no he has the
[1:21:26] same work schedule as everybody else so
[1:21:28] what's different about
[1:21:30] it and that slave owner said I always
[1:21:32] wondered
[1:21:34] myself about this
[1:21:36] one because even though he was a slave
[1:21:39] and he is forced to work he always
[1:21:42] carried himself a certain way and I
[1:21:45] found out that way back in Africa where
[1:21:47] he came from his father is the king of
[1:21:50] the
[1:21:51] tribe and he has a prince
[1:21:55] despite his situation he walks like a
[1:21:57] prince talks like a prince acts like a
[1:22:01] prince lives like a prince whether he
[1:22:03] sleep on a bed or the floor he knows
[1:22:06] he's a prince whether he has a big house
[1:22:09] or a small house he knows he's a prince
[1:22:12] whether he has a car or he traveled to
[1:22:14] church he knows he's a prince whether he
[1:22:17] has money in his pocket or no money he
[1:22:20] knows he's a prince oh God help me this
[1:22:23] morning
[1:22:27] you may be
[1:22:29] seated so what I'm speaking about church
[1:22:31] it's not about your situation and job

[1:26:25] Kingdom that's that's right Hallelujah
[1:26:28] you know the kind of friends I'm talking
[1:26:30] about those that influence you to do the
[1:26:33] things that you are not supposed to be
[1:26:36] doing instead of you putting pressure on
[1:26:39] them you're suffering from peer
[1:26:43] pressure what are you talking about you
[1:26:45] are a prince you are a princess you are
[1:26:48] a daughter of God you are a son of God
[1:26:51] Shake yourself and get back in step the
[1:26:54] Kingdom of Heaven is at hand and you are
[1:26:58] citizens of that
[1:27:00] Kingdom can the church say amen I hope
[1:27:04] that helps
[1:27:06] somebody this
[1:27:09] morning
[1:27:13] friends we all have a
[1:27:16] conscience and brother random speaks
[1:27:19] about being sensitive to that still
[1:27:21] Small Voice that tells you no don't do
[1:27:25] something and brother Bram said it like
[1:27:27] this he said if you have a question in
[1:27:30] your heart about something don't do
[1:27:33] it protect yourself don't take chances
[1:27:37] we have too much gamblers in the
[1:27:39] message people taking a chance with
[1:27:41] their life taking a chance with their
[1:27:44] walk with God if there's a doubt or
[1:27:47] question in your heart the prophet said
[1:27:49] do not do
[1:27:51] it stay away from shading places it's
[1:27:55] okay to sit at your desk if everybody in
[1:27:57] the lunchroom is doing craziness it's
[1:28:01] okay because this world is
[1:28:04] temporary if you cannot influence them
[1:28:07] stay away from them that's it because if
[1:28:09] you don't have the strength to influence
[1:28:11] them they will influence
[1:28:13] [Applause]
[1:28:15] you let me say that again if you do not
[1:28:17] have the strength to influence them they
[1:28:19] will influence
[1:28:22] you Hallelujah praise
[1:28:25] God and you pray until you are strong
[1:28:28] enough pray until you are empowered
[1:28:30] enough to go after your loved ones don't
[1:28:34] go after your loved ones if you know
[1:28:35] you're not even living right how could
[1:28:37] you even influence
[1:28:39] them there has to be something in you
[1:28:41] that that has strength a Dynamo to push
[1:28:44] you because it's not flesh and blood
[1:28:47] it's principalities and powers and the
[1:28:50] devil knows you are different he can't
[1:28:52] figure it out all together but knows
[1:28:54] that you are different can the church
[1:28:57] say
[1:28:57] [Applause]
[1:29:05] Amen so we are not ignorant friends of
[1:29:08] what's
[1:29:09] coming we know how the story is going to
[1:29:12] end and we will not be
[1:29:14] surprised every backslider has to be
[1:29:17] restored I don't care what condition
[1:29:19] that they in because this bride has the
[1:29:22] power to speak like Jesus did to Lazarus
[1:29:25] and if Lazarus was dead and had to come
[1:29:27] forth what about our young people what
[1:29:30] about our children we will speak for
[1:29:32] them and see them come forth because the
[1:29:35] kingdom is a kingdom of power and the
[1:29:37] kingdom suffered violence and the viol
[1:29:40] and take it by force the devil has done
[1:29:42] too much in your house in your life it's
[1:29:45] time you pick up your sword pick up your
[1:29:47] Shield pick up your spear pick up your
[1:29:50] pruning hooks pick up your fork pick up
[1:29:52] whatever you have and say devil enough
[1:29:55] is enough I'm a citizen of the kingdom
[1:29:58] and I'm exercising my right for
[1:30:00] deliverance my right for my family my
[1:30:03] right can the church say
[1:30:06] Amen oh
[1:30:08] hallelujah oh
[1:30:11] Hallelujah my my my my my from the
[1:30:14] message the world is falling apart
[1:30:15] brother the B said friends we are not
[1:30:17] promised a system Jesus wouldn't have
[1:30:19] nothing to do with a system we wasn't
[1:30:21] promised a system we were promised what
[1:30:24] we promis a kingdom how do we get into

[1:30:51] the prophet is saying by one spirit we
[1:30:54] are all baptized into this Kingdom

[1:30:59] baptism

[1:33:43] right job said where was you when I laid
[1:33:45] the foundation of the world when the
[1:33:47] morning Stars sang together and the sons

[1:33:55] that's right witness
[1:33:59] my in that same message uh in message

[1:34:04] John since then it's the kingdom of
[1:34:07] heaven now tonight the holy spirit is in
[1:34:10] the church to fulfill what the New
[1:34:13] Testament said that will come to pass in

[1:34:38] going to be too much longer with you
[1:34:40] Hallelujah Hallelujah on December the
[1:34:43] 24th 1965 we know this brother Brandon
[1:34:46] went on to be with the
[1:34:48] Lord in a simple humble
[1:34:51] way unrecognized by the world the
[1:34:55] greatest Ministry outside of Christ had
[1:34:59] been walking the Earth
[1:35:02] amen similar to that of John the
[1:35:05] Baptist his purpose was to forerun the
[1:35:09] coming of Christ amen John's
[1:35:12] responsibility was to forun the first
[1:35:14] coming and brother brandham was to forun
[1:35:16] the second
[1:35:17] coming and the message has been the same
[1:35:20] from John to brother brandham it's the
[1:35:21] same message the kingdom of Heaven is at
[1:35:27] hand we know it we know about Abraham
[1:35:31] Moses Noah David Elijah but when be
[1:35:34] branam died his name would not be
[1:35:37] mentioned like Abraham and Moses but
[1:35:40] this great Elijah Prophet had unfolded
[1:35:44] the story of his life through three
[1:35:46] poles amen and it was a great purpose
[1:35:49] for this Prophet right to deliver a
[1:35:52] Seven Seals sth and the message Amen to
[1:35:56] prepare an elect Omega word bride
[1:35:59] Hallelujah for a Rapture yes sir and for
[1:36:02] a
[1:36:04] kingdom Hallelujah it was not to build a
[1:36:08] church it was not to build a
[1:36:10] denomination it was to prepare a people
[1:36:13] yes sir to leave this place because
[1:36:15] judgment was coming am Hallelujah and
[1:36:19] the Rapture was a
[1:36:21] temporary pulling away
[1:36:24] because judgment had to come to this
[1:36:26] Earth because our promise is we shall
[1:36:29] reign on the
[1:36:30] earth and the Bible said John said I saw
[1:36:33] a new Heaven and a new Earth because
[1:36:37] fire had to consume this Earth amen but
[1:36:41] the Bram spoke he said that's the reason
[1:36:43] today he said the devil is the prince of
[1:36:46] the power of the air he said there are
[1:36:48] demons everywhere demons in the
[1:36:51] atmosphere he said it'll take fire to
[1:36:54] destroy these
[1:36:56] demons he see when Noah was here it was
[1:36:59] water upon the earth when Jesus was here
[1:37:02] blood dripped on the earth water blood
[1:37:05] he said there's one more thing that's
[1:37:07] waiting and that's fire to consume this
[1:37:11] Earth to purify this Earth and to
[1:37:14] prepare this earth once more for
[1:37:17] royalty and brother brand said the same
[1:37:19] way that's done is the same way for the
[1:37:21] believer you are baptized ties in water
[1:37:25] then the blood sprinkled Over You by the
[1:37:28] wo Ministry of the word but there's
[1:37:32] another element despite the Revelation
[1:37:36] despite the preaching despite the word a
[1:37:39] supernatural element Still
[1:37:43] Remains there's a need for
[1:37:46] fire because the fire burns the snake
[1:37:49] out the fire burns the evil out the fire
[1:37:54] burns the lust of the eye lust of the
[1:37:56] flesh pride of life the fire takes out
[1:38:00] armor somebody the fire takes out the
[1:38:03] jealousy the fire takes out the Envy the
[1:38:07] fire takes out the cold stch
[1:38:10] [Applause]
[1:38:18] formal Holy Ghost Fire amen Holy Ghost
[1:38:22] Fire amen and when that fire comes upon
[1:38:24] you that fire comes to place you into
[1:38:27] position that fire comes to place you
[1:38:29] into the Kingdom so you are walking in
[1:38:32] time walking on the Earth but when the
[1:38:34] fire consumes you there's a shift that
[1:38:36] takes place you are no longer of this
[1:38:38] Dimension you are no longer of this time
[1:38:41] but you are a creature of Eternity
[1:38:43] walking in time you are a rule breaker
[1:38:47] you are a trend Setter you are just
[1:38:49] different you become like your bigger
[1:38:52] brother because we are had joint ears
[1:38:54] with Christ so it means Jesus is our
[1:38:56] bigger brother and if he could walk on
[1:38:58] water that means we could walk on water
[1:39:00] too if he could speak and say Lazarus
[1:39:03] come forth somebody in this church will
[1:39:06] speak and see the dead raised somebody
[1:39:10] in this church will speak and see a
[1:39:12] mountain move uh somebody in this church
[1:39:15] uh will speak and see the sick heal and
[1:39:18] see the cripples walk that's what I'm
[1:39:20] talking about the Kingdom of Heaven is
[1:39:23] at hand can the church say Amen somebody
[1:39:27] give God a shout of Praise oh I can't
[1:39:30] hear you somebody give God a shout of
[1:39:33] [Applause]
[1:39:48] Praise
[1:39:50] Hallelujah God always has an order
[1:39:53] and he will never break his order Peter
[1:39:56] walked with Jesus Peter walked on water
[1:40:00] and Peter still had to go into the upper
[1:40:01] room there was no bypassing the upper
[1:40:04] room there was no way around the upper
[1:40:06] room Peter still had to get his personal
[1:40:08] experience with the pillar of fire can
[1:40:12] the church say Amen is there anybody
[1:40:14] this morning once their personal
[1:40:16] experience with the pillar of fire not
[1:40:19] an experience with the pastor or the
[1:40:21] preacher but God himself
[1:40:23] self divided himself in the upper room
[1:40:27] and give each one their portion it was
[1:40:30] not just for the ministry but every
[1:40:32] individual got their portion Lord I want
[1:40:35] my portion do you want your portion this
[1:40:38] morning oh
[1:40:41] hallelujah oh
[1:40:44] Hallelujah
[1:40:46] hallelu I'm not going to be too much
[1:40:48] longer so we have been in a time of
[1:40:51] preparation for the kingdom of heaven
[1:40:54] because the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand
[1:40:56] and you can't just walk into it you need
[1:40:57] to be prepared for it and God has always
[1:41:01] had an order and he will never break his
[1:41:04] order the word of the lord always came
[1:41:06] to the prophets Amos 3:7 surely the Lord
[1:41:09] God will do nothing but he revealed his
[1:41:11] secret unto his servants the
[1:41:13] prophets kings were made subject to
[1:41:16] prophets the high priest had to subject
[1:41:19] himself to the prophets all the Levites
[1:41:21] had to subject themselves to the the
[1:41:23] prophet amen hallelujah and when the
[1:41:26] word of the Prophet came that word would
[1:41:28] stand until the next Prophet came
[1:41:35] along and we know what day we are in is
[1:41:38] this age to be any different according
[1:41:41] to my Bible there's no other major
[1:41:43] prophet to
[1:41:45] come there'll be no other Ministry like
[1:41:48] the ministry of brother brandham our
[1:41:51] Elijah our John the Baptist
[1:41:53] when brother Bram spoke it was not manp
[1:41:56] speaking when brother Bram spoke it was
[1:41:59] the son of man veiled in a son of
[1:42:05] man brother bam said in the lean Church
[1:42:08] it listen to the authenticated prophet
[1:42:10] of God who appears in this last age what
[1:42:13] he says from God the bride will say Amen
[1:42:16] the spirit and the prophet and the bride
[1:42:19] will be saying the same thing and what
[1:42:22] they will say will have already been
[1:42:24] said in the word amen it brings us back
[1:42:27] to the Bible amen and the Holy Spirit
[1:42:30] today the manifestation of the holy
[1:42:33] spirit is that angel trying to get the
[1:42:36] people not back to church but back to
[1:42:39] the word amen because the holy spirit
[1:42:42] will only vindicate the word amen back
[1:42:45] to the word means back to the Bible amen
[1:42:48] the Bible has always been a sealed book
[1:42:51] and without the message of this hour the
[1:42:54] Bible is close to you it's close to the
[1:42:57] Pentecostals they could have all kind of
[1:42:59] services but it's close to them that's
[1:43:02] why we thank God for a prophet who could
[1:43:05] point us that the Kingdom of
[1:43:07] Heaven is at
[1:43:10] hand amen
[1:43:13] Hall friends I'm saying all of that to
[1:43:15] tie this message together that we are
[1:43:18] leaving this place
[1:43:21] amen and I'm troubling my Soul church
[1:43:24] because I don't see a lot of people
[1:43:27] making desperate preparation true to
[1:43:30] leave this place amen people are more
[1:43:33] concerned about preparing to live
[1:43:38] here brother brandham didn't say stop
[1:43:41] building houses and stop living He said
[1:43:43] live as if God is coming
[1:43:47] tomorrow
[1:43:48] hallelujah our goal should not be
[1:43:51] getting ready it should be staying
[1:43:58] ready I'll say that again our goal
[1:44:01] should not be getting ready it should be
[1:44:03] staying ready am there are some of us if
[1:44:07] God says I'm coming today some of you
[1:44:09] might have second thoughts because you
[1:44:12] know what you have planned
[1:44:15] tomorrow you're so caught up in the
[1:44:17] world of your plans your Ambitions your
[1:44:20] dreams your goals that you're not
[1:44:21] sensitive to the fact that this world is
[1:44:24] finished amen this world has nothing and
[1:44:28] we don't belong
[1:44:30] here can the church say
[1:44:34] Amen so I'm preaching to Overcomers this
[1:44:37] morning who are ready to overcome the
[1:44:40] lust of the eyes the lust of the Flesh
[1:44:43] and overcome themselves and say Lord I
[1:44:46] want to surrender
[1:44:47] all because I want to be in that Kingdom
[1:44:51] I want to be a citizen of that Kingdom
[1:44:54] and brother Bram taught us that only
[1:44:56] perfect
[1:44:57] love will make it over
[1:45:00] there so it cannot be our interpretation
[1:45:03] our idea well this is me and my friend
[1:45:06] and we go in no it has to be as the
[1:45:10] word
[1:45:16] requires
[1:45:18] Hallelujah Friends The Rapture will be a
[1:45:21] defining moment you can begin to play
[1:45:23] something softly Hallelujah not going to
[1:45:25] be too much longer with
[1:45:28] you brother brandham said
[1:45:30] Jesus will be the showdown between the
[1:45:33] denominations and Creeds for he will
[1:45:35] come to back up his word and take his
[1:45:39] bride in the Rapture amen I said this
[1:45:42] before in the Eternal Mind Of God as he
[1:45:45] looks at time time is divided into two
[1:45:48] categories before the Rapture and after
[1:45:51] the Rapture
[1:45:53] whether it's one person or a thousand
[1:45:55] people the message is the same get ready
[1:46:00] for the Rapture amen let us not lose the
[1:46:04] focus of why God send the prophet amen
[1:46:09] the purpose of this evening time message
[1:46:12] is to bring the bride into rapturing
[1:46:15] condition or into a condition to be in
[1:46:19] that Kingdom amen can the Church Say
[1:46:22] Amen not Church condition not message
[1:46:26] condition but rapturing Hallelujah
[1:46:31] condition and brother Brandon brought
[1:46:33] the type of the horse and buggy age and
[1:46:36] the airplane age and the astronaut age
[1:46:38] and he said that we Are Spiritual
[1:46:40] astronauts
[1:46:41] yes and we know that astronauts have to
[1:46:45] be prepared and trained because the air
[1:46:47] is different out

[1:48:15] version in the message God doesn't call
