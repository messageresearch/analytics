an harlot's house named rehab and lodged there and it was told the king of jericho saying behold there came men in hitherto the night of the children of israel to search out the country and the king of jericho sent unto rehab saying bring forth the men that are come to thee which are entered into thine house for they become to search out all the country and the woman took the two men and hit them

of stalks of flax which she had laid in order upon the roof and the men proceeded after them and on the way to jordan onto the fords and as soon as they which were pursued after them were gone out they shut the gate and before they were laid down she came up onto them up onto up on upon the roof and she said unto the man i know that the lord had given you the land and that your terror is fallen upon us and that all the inhabitants of the land faint because of you for we have heard how the lord dried up the water of the red sea for you when he came out of egypt and what she did unto the two kings of the amorites that were on the other side of jordan scion and og whom ye utterly destroy and as soon as we had heard these things our heart didn't melt neither did there any remain any more courage than any man because of you for the lord your god he is god in heaven above and in earth beneath now therefore i pray you sway unto me by the lord since i have showed you kindness that you

day praise god hallelujah hey many man hallelujah but i have a great story to tell this morning and it's a story that has not been often told but it's a story about a woman preschool hallelujah a woman who got an opportunity hallelujah an opportunity of a lifetime an opportunity that not many people get many of us this morning are sitting here this morning because we took advantage of an opportunity hallelujah same as somebody hey many man so my title this morning is give me a true token hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hey many man so we're going to tell a little story here this morning amen amen hallelujah hallelujah people love stories isn't that right bible's filled with stories stories of the heroes of faith and how they stood throughout the years paul said up these things are for all commendations isn't that right these things are for all reproof hallelujah amen for instruction and all correction amen amen isn't that for all encouragement isn't that right hallelujah hallelujah so we're going to take a little encouragement this morning straight out of the bible praise god straight out of the peaches of joshua this morning we're going to take a little encouragement this morning this morning this message is to encourage you about a little woman called rehab the harlot praise god a prostitute woman who was given an opportunity hallelujah prayed that was once in a lifetime hallelujah hallelujah and she took it this morning we're gonna find out how she took it praise god amen so my title is morning give me a true token amen and our story begins this morning on chapter one in jericho amen the great wall city of jericho jericho was a great wall city isn't that right bible spoke about jericho briefly in these scriptures and um to my knowledge a wall like the size that was around jericho it's not the kind of wall that you could build in a day it was a huge wall matter of fact that wall was there before joshua came on the scene it was always there it was there so long that people built houses in the walls so secure were they in their fortification amen isn't that right i'm gonna start real slow i'm just gonna take my time but you say man when the word strikes you don't be afraid praise god amen i'm not saying anything strange hallelujah but if you're at the book of joshua you know that these walls were there a long time and um i did a little research on jericho and so on and that city that dwelt so long ago and it was it was that when joshua had crossed this river of jordan isn't that right and they had come over into the land of promise that jericho was this first city that they had to encounter it was a great city it was a great powerful city amen isn't that right they had a military they had a government system they had money they had an economic system they had cars they had buildings they had fancy technology they had medical science they had everything that you could ever want hallelujah that was dwelling in jericho it was a real nice place to live if you had money and you had a good job it's a real nice place kind of like the condition of the world that that the world is in today oh hallelujah some people didn't want to leave hollywood some people want to stay isn't that right this great jericho city praise god hallelujah hallelujah are you with me this morning jericho lay in a low-lying area apparently in a geographical state so if you had to get anywhere into canaan the land of the jebusites or the hittites or the paris acts if you wanted to get there you had to pass through jericho amen it's not right joshua knew it so this was his first great campaign praise god to take jericho city amen but it was very big it was very great now it was a fortified structure behind those walls was their greatest uh defense isn't that right it was their probably their only line of defense was this great wall from behind that wall they would fight all their battles i guess and jericho stood for all those years because of that war that kept them hemmed in isn't that right i kept them fenced in isn't that right hallelujah that protected them from the outside world as far as the bible goes and history goes jericho is a place that did a lot of marketing they did a lot of trade and commerce people came from all over egypt different places to do trade and barton the different things and trading and money and expenses and so on in in jericho that's how come a babylonian garment ended up in jericho it wasn't made in jericho somebody brought that there paid money for it and so on so you're understanding the story now praise god amen amen hallelujah so this is jericho great rich place rich in agriculture rich in wealth witch and money hallelujah i have need of nothing praise god that was their condition that was jericho's condition praise god hallelujah they were the great gateway to the land of canaan however they they esteemed themselves in their position they felt pretty proud about who they were holly but not knowing that there was a joshua that was on the scene not knowing that god had already accused that city isn't that right he called it a cursed city and i guess after true trade and speaking and communicating with different nations different people brought their gods and their idols and their different ways and forms of worship after all the police came become corrupt hallelujah isn't that right the place got mixed up with all kind of funny interpretations there's my preaching on the street and that guy trying to do this here and all kind of weird religions was taking place in jericho is a it was a melting pot of societies and and religions and and what people thought and and and it built walls walls physical and world spiritual hallelujah all around jericho praise god amen isn't that right hallelujah amen amen but the people were afraid because of their financial position that jericho found themselves in they had to protect themselves from outside elements and outside forces so they built a wall to protect themselves from the outside to protect themselves from everything else isn't that right hallelujah hallelujah amen and i began to think about walls and that wall that jericho built and you know sometimes we in our lives we we feel pretty secure about who we are isn't that right we feel pretty secure we feel pretty good about what we've done what we've achieved what we've accomplished as individuals isn't that right some of us have great education some of us have gone to different schools and things some of us have good jobs and so on and sometimes you feel real secure about these things and sometimes these things these very things that we feel so secure about build a wall they tend to block people out sometimes we even block god out because we're building a wall a wall made of bricks and each brick is something that happened or something that took place some experience and it just keep building building brick after brick after brick and sometimes people come to church and they say amen and they shake hands but there's a wall there oh same and someone people come to church for years but that wall is still there i can't lock you in a prison more than the wall that you've built for your own self same and somebody hallelujah one time paul and silas was in prison isn't that right and they began to worship and praise god isn't that right hallelujah they were in a prison hallelujah but what the jails keepers didn't know what the people of that time didn't know hallelujah was that paul was already a prisoner of christ if you couldn't lock up a locked up man he was already locked up in car he was already wrapped up come on he was already tied up come on he was already tangled up in god you couldn't lock up a locked up man oh hallelujah just about midnight when he began to praise and worship god all of a sudden all of a sudden you'd began to shake something can be gonna happen somebody began to take place hallelujah that they did not expect all of a sudden those walls began to give way the bible said every door opened up it was a long jail was a door here a door here a door here a door here but that angel dropped down on the scene and when he began to praise and worship god when he began to thank him and praise him and get in the spirit something began to happen every door that they walked through was kicked wide open oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah praise god this morning i don't care what toy's trying to keep you in i don't care what wall's trying to keep you in you stay in the spirit you stay in the atmosphere you keep praising god you stay in that atmosphere this morning and god will do something for you you watch god begin to open every door open every door in your life open every circumstance break everything down to make a way for you because you are his son same and somebody you are his daughter this morning oh hallelujah hallelujah hiding behind those walls that's what we do sometimes put a wall up hide behind it smile shake hands do all the nice things play ties hold the little babies and kiss them great walls standing there the pharisees sadducees were like walking walls jesus knew it said yo you're like you're like your father's uh you are you're like your forefathers you're a dead man he looked at them and he could see those walls standing there great tall and proud they were all studied up they knew everything in a scripture and yet they couldn't see god manifested in front of them because there was a wall blocking them from seeing the messiah in his trueness and his fullness and his sweetness and his humility they failed to see messiah why because there was a wall there a wall of the education a wall of their schooling and a doctrinal a wall that was built isn't that right just kind of touch and taste a little bit in move on my a wall isn't that right and i read in the bible we read in the bible just now that it was something called the shutting of the gate in the evening time isn't that right so i'm guessing at some point in time during the day the gates will be open and they would allow trade and commerce people to come and go as they please and of course there would be a time in the evening i don't know if it was six o'clock nine o'clock or whenever but there would be a shutting of the gate yeah the evening time they would shut the gate close the gates no one could go away no one could come out nothing could happen until i guess next morning isn't that right please go so that's my introduction this morning chapter one of the story praise god hallelujah jericho the great world city now we're gonna go over to chapter two rehab the harlot who was a type of the bride this morning he many many men now the bible describes rahab as a harlot she was a prostitute woman isn't that right this woman is considered i guess low level in society there were a lot of esteemed politicians in the day of jericho there were kings there were priests there were great men there were leaders there were great leaders in society they were great influential people great men politicians people would vote for congress and and commerce and people big business owners and so forth isn't that right people who drove fancy cars and lived in nice houses nice people rich people rich in goods have need of nothing they were good people wonderful people people he would put up there on a pedestal sure if god was to speak to anybody they would speak to that person but here was rehab a hard woman a prostitute woman hallelujah is not right she's living a very descriptive life isn't that right hallelujah she was nothing that you would desire isn't that right she was entertaining men and so forth and you know how it goes amen rehab the harlot amen someone that you would not desire you would look upon that woman and say who her you'd put her in the corner you'd say no no no we wouldn't invite her to the party we would invite her to the social gathering when jericho looked at rehab they saw a harlot but when god looked at rehab he saw someone special oh hallelujah hallelujah and i was reading this story and i began to feel like rehab because i didn't start out okay bible says i was born in sin the bible said i was shaped in iniquity the bible said i come into the world speaking lies the bible said foolishness is bound in the heart of every child every single child i don't care how nice they look how sweet they look how nice they smell every one of them has got foolishness in their heart everyone the bible says so and the bible gives us instruction as parents to take a wrong correction and try that foolishness away not a rock and spawn not a child isn't that right i'm taking on my position as daddy this morning hallelujah praise god amen hallelujah hallelujah hey many many men they want to ban corporal punishment they better read the bible again brother amen praise god hallelujah hallelujah spread out the word amen drive it away from them amen hallelujah hallelujah don't let them touch that unclean thing talk to them encourage them amen isn't that right hallelujah all right where was that when did the under the daddy move amen praise god hallelujah amen well anyway i was born in sin shape and iniquity isn't that right i come in a world almost a prostitute listening to this one listening to that one and trying to glean something from here and trying to get some kind of satisfaction over here still looking for something real something important something i knew was out there hallelujah isn't that right every one of us had desire in our hearts but we were prostitutes because we were looking for it for here looking for it from this person looking for it from that person looking for it from this church from that brother from that sister we didn't know where to go we didn't know what to do we were prostitutes once once we were like rehab we were in that same condition oh so don't you ever get puffed up we were like rehab once oh glory but the grace of god oh same men somebody i was like rehab once brother i feel like rehab this morning oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh hallelujah oh hallelujah why isn't that right she was a prostitute a harlot low-level society who pairings and makeup not the kind of person you want to hang out with my my god isn't that right but she was predestinated for a purpose she was predestinated her story is written in the scripture harlan it's a story we're going to get to that story in a moment hallelujah hallelujah he many many men makes me think about that woman at the well one day when the messiah stepped down into into flesh isn't that right here come that hard woman isn't that right she was a prostitute too you know woman at the wheelchair with an ill feigned woman the bible says she come walking down the road one day doing her ordinary thing going about her ordinary way but that day was different she didn't know that that day was different she was just going about her normal routine when all of a sudden there was a man sitting there on a well people don't hang out at the well they know that woman they know what time she comes it's a routine it's every day every day they know what time she comes so they're not going to hang around because they know the ill framed woman is going to show up at the 11 hour but at that same 11 hour here come jesus sitting at the well oh this was weird oh this was different it felt strange and wonderful oh hallelujah here was a stranger sitting at the well he knew what he was there for he had an appointment praise god with this special lady she was a special lady they didn't know she was a special lady on earth she was black on urge she was all scarlet but when god looked through his blood glasses when god looked through his bloodlands he saw how white as snow hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh same and somebody same man somebody this was a special lady oh hallelujah oh hallelujah he's come walking yeah she comes whistling doing a normal thing sees a stranger all of a sudden he breaks his silence he asks her for a drink and begin to talk to the woman the prophet said he began to hunt her soul the prophet did the same thing people would come up on the platform he'd say brother i i perceive you a christian he said yes sir i am he said uh how are you doing this morning someone he's communicating with him and he's talking to them and all of a sudden the holy spirit begin to travel through the intellect we're going to go past the flesh we're going to go past the thoughts and we're going to discern the thoughts in their hearts i'll begin to see the desire begin to begin to see the need there and then the prophet had said your name is so-and-so you live on certain streets somebody came up to you yesterday and they told you a certain thing and you feel real bad about it go back brother you don't have to worry about that no more god has forgiven you praise god hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah it was that same holy spirit that same jesus he was on the scene i began to talk to the woman and he said woman if you know who i was you would ask me for a drink hallelujah she thought he was unnatural stuff but all of a sudden he began to transition from the natural into the spiritual i believe this morning we will begin to transition this morning from the natural god's gonna flip the coin this morning you thought you came to a noble service you thought you came to a natural calling this is not a natural call this is a spiritual call god is going to flip the coin this morning and show you a thing shame and somebody hallelujah hallelujah how many want to meet god this morning oh holla he is here to speak with you he is here to meet your need he's here to set the captain free he's here to bring those walls down oh keep got a shout out pray hallelujah hallelujah she was a prostitute woman he knew it he had already seen it in the vision he said go call your husband test let's see what she'll say let's see if she has a good and honest heart let's see if she's the one that the world has prophesied to be here this time this hour this season this here right here now let's see if this is the harlot holy that god has sent me to send to there was jesus on the test hallelujah he said go call your husband a test what do you do what will she say she said i have no husband holly isn't that right i had six men i want to live in it it's not my own isn't that right she spoke the truth she was honest and sometimes that's what's called all that goes looking for from you is honesty same and somebody hallelujah some people want to put walls up and say lord god in the name of jesus hallelujah might make up heaven and earth and lord and master savior and the universe sometimes all he wants you to do is admit you're wrong sometimes all he wants you to do is admit your faults admit your failures a broken heart and a contrite spirit i will not despise say the lord isn't that right sometimes god wants from us his honesty bring those walls down this morning will you do it this

nobody could come in but in joshua 6 that chapter starts if you remember it says that jericho was strictly shut up that's right none went out and none came in isn't that right it means somewhere

something happened between joshua 2 and joseph 6. isn't that right the cause great still among the people what was it let's get to chapter 3 now of my story the two messengers so two messengers went into jericho isn't that right hallelujah honolulu went into jericho and actual joshua sent two spies out of to view jericho isn't that right to go undercover to go and talk to the people bring back some feedback bring me back some word gotta be on the right path holiday things are in its place hallelujah they were to bring back word to joshua but it got into a little bit of trouble these two messengers had to take refuge in rahab's house isn't that right of all the people that they could take refuge they were great prime ministers in those days they were great presidents in those days there were people at real nice houses but god chose these two men the bible said they lodged in rahab's camp they lodged in rahab's house the house that was upon the war and when they got in there i guess they spent a little while there and they were able to testify to rahab rahab knew those men were different she had met men from all over the world she had met men from in egypt and met men from babylon and this place and that place she knew what they looked like by their clothes and by their conversation and by their they words and so forth the dictation it was different but she knew that these men were different she could tell that these men were israelites and she knew the stories about the israelites and she put these two men to sit down and she said i want you to tell me all about what's been going on all about what's been taking place tell me about this great god that you serve tell me about this great call that you have encountered this great god that is walking with you tell me about the testimony tell me about moses hollywood come on out tell me about herod tell me about joshua tell me about the captains tell me about caleb tell me about israel tell me about the tribes tell me about how you do tell me about how you walk tell me a little about how you talk praise i want to know i want to experience it oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh my god we're going to testify i believe you're going to tell ray ham all about what they've seen and heard how they've seen jericho open up how they've seen it amen isn't that egypt and the plagues and this had happened and that had happened and all the stories that happened way back since the beginning since the books of genesis they began to tell her all about the history of the god that they serve and how that god was able to deliver them how that god had brought them through great triumph great pestilence and how the day was standing only because a generation after generation had sought the word of the lord and god had delivered them generation after generation and here they were standing as a testimony of all that god had done and they began to testify all about what was god i was going to do how god was going to take jericho how god was going to destroy the land and slay the land utterly isn't that right hallelujah she heard the testimony isn't that right it fellowshipped a little while hallelujah amen amen so advice it was by god's grace these two messengers came by to rehab a harlot a unknown person a jane doe as it was she was unknown to jericho not very uh person that would be you know what you would elevate but god saw it fit to send these two messengers her way this was the grace of god to her hallelujah and she began to realize how dark the situation was getting she began to get become concerned she began to become convinced she began to realize that there was something she had to do in order to escape the destruction that was coming upon jericho because if god could open a red sea if god could open a jordan river if god could cause flies and frogs and plagues to come upon egypt then she knew that jericho was nothing in god's hands god was going to spy jericho just as sure as he had smith in egypt just as sure as he had smoked smith and those two kings over the river of jordan she knew the situation was beginning to get dark she realized that time was getting short oh hallelujah hallelujah oh hallelujah the people knew it but she knew it more because she had a direct testimony from two witnesses who were sent to her at a point at a time of deliverance hallelujah this was her opportunity and she had to take it and i can't help but think that i was in a situation once i was like rahab once but then all of a sudden here come two messengers here come william branham a prophet of god sent from before the foundational world as a manifestation of malachi 4-5 hallelujah is not right to call praise god out hallelujah hallelujah out of the walls of the nomination after the walls of the churches out of the walls of the groups after the walls of the people god send a messenger supernatural joshua the holy spirit same and somebody you know i'm going this morning god sent a messenger our way to preach the unsearchable riches of jesus christ hallelujah hallelujah isn't that right and god sent his first messenger to the church hallelujah my people be not particularly pleased isn't that right 1945 to 1965 there was a prophet going out hallelujah and he prophesied and he prophesied first full first pull great signs and wonders is narayan second paul republican of spirits third paul the opening of the world mysteries revealed in that right there was that prophet the first messenger was sent to the church and then god said i'll send another one revelation 10 1 2 7 down come that angel isn't that right that was the taste of the voice and then here come revelation 10 8 through 11 brother coleman coming on the scene to echo back the promises of malachi 4 to echo back those same promise here come another witness there come another witness on the scene who stood in the gap from 1965 to now the shot of the king is in the camp another messenger come on the scene to echo back every word every promise line up online line up online hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah to preach back the promises isn't that right i will lay down by malachi 4. i like to acknowledge that ministry i had to acknowledge another ministry coming i fight for ministry on the scene hallelujah a joshua generation that was going to take the people over oh isn't that right it's not right hallelujah i hope we had received two messengers oh holly i feel a little bit like rehab this morning my when i get to the other side hallelujah i want to go and shake rehabs huh oh holiday i want to find and find out how she's overcome i want to tell you my story praise god amen amen hallelujah amen two witnesses praise god we have received amen in the church just before the coming of the end hallelujah amen isn't that right so word came back to the king of jericho isn't that right and uh that they were these two spies from israel and they were lodged there in the camp of rehab and he sent out he sent out men said go and find those men i don't think he sent them out to have a talk i don't think he sent him out to have a conversation he sent those two men out he sent those men out there to go kill those guys amen to get rid of them isn't that right hey man people are going to talk you know how people are people get to talking to one another said i saw two men going by rehab they didn't look like egyptians they didn't look like people from the jebusites or parasites they look like israelites they look like different kind of people they had a different kind of walk they had a different kind of talk and they had a different kind of message and right now ray habene is having a revival and i ain't having no revival so i want to know what's going on i want to know what's inside of there going on and taking place rehab is jumping and shouting and screaming rehab is getting a revelation and the people are going to get jealous people want to tell the king we're making too much of noise we're worshiping too much something going on inside our house better go check that out oh my the king was wrought with anger sent his messengers to go and see what's going on inside there go and see what the revival was going try to stop that revival hallelujah isn't that right and rahab did a wise thing she said i don't know what you're talking about i don't know who you're talking about he said those guys they came and they went in some other direction and she sent them away isn't that right and she hit them in the roof hallelujah she hit him in a safe place praise gone and she began to tell them how they would escape isn't that right they came down from on the roof and they had already shut the gate the bible says the only way out was through the window thank god rahab's house was against the wall because right where the window was there's a wall to let them down hallelujah they were in the right place at the right time to get the right message to the right lady and get out before the shouting of the gates hallelujah and we have received the right message we have received a prophet hallelujah william prana probably for the foundational world to get the right message to the right lady before the shouting of the gates hallelujah hallelujah oh my hallelujah we have heard the story rehab heard all the testimonies but it wasn't good enough for her to hear there was a longing in rehab's heart raham knew that in spite of the god that she had heard about she needed something from those men she needed something that jericho couldn't give she needed a blessed assurance she needed a token she needed something to show i took them for good she began to get desperate oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah she showed kindness to these two men she received those two messengers in the name of the lord god of heaven above and the name of the lord of the earth beneath she received those two messengers in our hearts but still there was something missing still it was something she needed still there was something she required she knew that jericho was going to be destroyed everybody in jericho was doomed to destruction they were doomed to peril they were doomed to shadow to the flame and to the sword everyone was going to die she knew it she needed an assurance she needed something to know that she was going to make it in spite of all the destruction in spite of what was going to happen oh hallelujah brother sister you need something this morning you know you need it this world is going into chaos this world is going to be destroyed this world is heading for a great funeral service hallelujah john said i saw a new heaven and a new earth and a new jerusalem coming down from god out of heaven this world is going to burn by fire malachi 4 prophesies a world burning like an oven isn't that right but just before the time at the end behold i send you elijah hallelujah hallelujah before the great and dreadful day of the lord to turn our hearts back to the original fate hallelujah hallelujah to turn our hearts back literally turn our hearts back to the faith of the fathers to receive the same penny that they received back there you are predestinated to receive that same holy spirit of promise same man somebody same and somebody that's what we come for amen me arrow that's what you drove here for you drove here for the holy ghost and you're gonna get it god's gonna reward your faith this morning glory to god hallelujah whoa hallelujah isn't that right we're happy going to get desperate real began to realize how dark it was getting riha began to realize how late it was getting real was concerned not only for her but for her father for her brothers for her sisters for her children that's the true spirit of a christian you're not looking to save yourself you trying to save somebody else you receive a message to take you out of here brother hallelujah praise god there's a promise for your family there's a promise for that wayward son there's a promise for that wayward daughter there's a promise for them that are far off and as many as the lord god shall call there's a ministry for the pride to go after the lost this is what was in rehab's heart rehab began to cry out those two men were getting ready to leave it was evening time it was getting dark the shadows were falling they had to get back to israel followed before the great shutting of the gate before we come to us place where no flesh could be safe before we come to no one out and no one come in before it come to that these men had to get out quickly while they could and rahab took a call and she tied to the window and when she tired she grabbed a hold of those two men and she said listen

authorization she needed a stamp of approval she needed to know in her heart and in her life that she had passed from death onto life that no matter how dark the situation got in jericho that no

said but to god it is the only way amen amen young people it is the only way i don't care how old-fashioned the token is the only way hallelujah for you to enter in it hallelujah have you been baptized into the party how long have you been in the savior's bride hallelujah come and be baptized hallelujah let that token come into you isn't that right he said it's the only way he says the only thing that he requires is that token this is the prophet he said it must be there you cannot have the token until the fare is paid until the price is paid isn't that right said then you are a possessor of the token which gives you the privilege of of a free pass so then i'll see the blood i'll pass over you oh it's not right he said what a time he said what a privilege to know that you pack within you the past may god pack within you this morning the past the past from death on to life hallelujah the pastor enter into the kingdom of god how about the baptism of the holy ghost by the token being applied to you isn't iran he said when i see the blood i pass over you it's the only thing that he recognized it's nothing else that can take its place no substitute no denomination no nothing else it takes that god said that alone will i see he said no matter how righteous they were talk about israel and their journey to the wilderness said how good they was how much education they had how much they dress he said the token was the only thing when i see the token i'll pass over you the blood was a token that the requirement of jehovah had been met that it had been done and the blood stood for a token the blood was a token see the life god said the day each day of you die that day you die and there had been a substitutionary life taken for the life of the believer god in mercy accepted a substitute for the life of the defiled person and when his child had defied himself with sin of disbelieving the word then god rich in mercy made a substitute and that was something that had to die in its place nothing else could work he said that's why canes apples and peaches and so forth it didn't work it had to be a life that had blood in it it had to be a literal life isn't that right to take place to take to take our place isn't that right he said and the life was gone from the sacrifice and now the blood was a token that god's order had been carried out now what did god require the life and the blood showed that there was a life gone so the blood was the token that the life had been given that something had to die god's requirements isn't that right that a life had been given and the blood had been shed and that blood stood for a token that the life was gone the life of the animals and so forth and so on isn't that right he goes on okay let me skip down here real quick i want to touch on this here before i move on hallelujah amen hallelujah okay he said uh amen he said the blood was a token or identification the blood identified that the worshiper had slain the lamb and accepted the lamb and applied the token to himself and that he was not ashamed he didn't care who saw it he wanted everybody to see it and it was placed in such a position that everybody passing by could see that token oh hallelujah hallelujah and everybody could see rahab's token hanging out that window people might have laughed at her they might have told her that scarlet cause wasn't in fashion but she didn't care about that she applied her token she did what call required of her she met god's requirement didn't matter how much people laughed didn't matter how much people laughed at how she dressed and the way she walked and the way she talked she was applying her token she was doing all that she could to meet god's requirements oh come on my brother are we doing all we can this morning to meet god's requirement before the time of the end oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah he said the blood is a token identification isn't that right he said now we have a lesson here maybe you could really bring it to your thought just a moment look before it happens for there's coming a time will you not be able to have any blood applied he said the lamb was killed in the evening time after being kept up for 14 days and then allah was killed the blood is applied in the evening time he said you get it the token never come into existence until the evening time and this is the evening time or the age that we're living in isn't that right he said this is the evening time for for the church this is the evening time for me he said this is the evening time of my message amen he knew he was about to go isn't that right he said i'm dying i'm going i'm moving out this is 1963. he said in the evening time of the gospel and we've come up through justification and so forth but this is the time he said this is the time that the token has to be applied he said i told you last sunday there's something i want to talk to you about he said this is it he said the time that when you just can't play with it it's got to be done you can't play with it no more you've got to cross this jordan you've got to apply that token praise god hallelujah in this time in a season oh same and somebody he said you can't play with it it's got to be done oh it's got to be done this morning you've got to receive the holy ghost it's a life-and-death situation hallelujah hallelujah
