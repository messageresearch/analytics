[1:05:05] ticket got not allowed just yet but the
[1:05:08] point about it is this things are moving
[1:05:10] very very quickly to bring us to where
[1:05:13] we supposed to be and this hour I want
[1:05:17] to let you know quickly that there's no
[1:05:22] way you will just sit in church and go
[1:05:25] into the rapture there's no way you were
[1:05:28] sick not when a prophet lost his child
[1:05:30] lost his wife lost the anointing went to
[1:05:34] his own place of trying that character
[1:05:38] could be formed in him when he was
[1:05:40] condemning the woman in the restaurant
[1:05:41] Gortat
[1:05:43] and shown his own sins that was forgiven
[1:05:45] and he is condemning her when he when he
[1:05:48] has forgiven him and he arose to go past
[1:05:51] all of that and break into brotherly
[1:05:53] kindness and break into a nizam of
[1:05:55] compassion and break into an open door
[1:05:58] that he could see the way God sees
[1:06:00] because if we could only see the way God
[1:06:03] sees this morning our whole lives will
[1:06:05] be changed our whole lives will be
[1:06:07] different because we are what we are
[1:06:09] by the grace of God we didn't earn it we
[1:06:12] didn't deserve it is the grace of God so
[1:06:15] stop being arrogant
[1:06:17] stop being puffed up understand that you
[1:06:20] are what you are but for the grace of
[1:06:23] God if God didn't keep you you would
[1:06:25] have fallen if God didn't hold you you
[1:06:28] would have been lost if God didn't seek
[1:06:30] after you you would not have been found
[1:06:31] but for the goodness of God oh we should
[1:06:34] be grateful and thankful when we walk
[1:06:36] into the house of God careful in our
[1:06:39] hearts what we should be often
[1:06:40] illiterate praises and Thanksgiving what
[1:06:43] are you complaining about
[1:06:45] you woke up this morning activity in
[1:06:48] limbs if your body of pain is they

[1:07:21] breakthrough this is where the line is
[1:07:24] forming outside the church but blind hog
[1:07:26] leading people coming to be prayed for

[1:07:38] believe that that's the core of the

[1:09:44] this church nor a Jesus says we would
[1:09:49] see Jesus
[1:09:50] [Applause]
[1:09:52] I want to see the same power of love sin
[1:09:58] forgiveness it's a power you look the
[1:10:02] Pharisees and scribes the cat has
[1:10:04] outlawed ever the cat humor sick they
[1:10:06] just talk in wood no power no anointing
[1:10:10] I'm challenging the Messiah
[1:10:13] Moses see this woman caught in the very
[1:10:15] act of adultery should be strong what
[1:10:17] you see they taught us and just poke you
[1:10:21] see in them if Moses see that let's go
[1:10:25] do it
[1:10:25] if you were talk to him just to what
[1:10:29] Moses say if you made out sin those guys
[1:10:32] had to walk away because they know they
[1:10:33] was just as guilty as that woman maybe
[1:10:35] not about you but other things because
[1:10:37] the Hat is what speaks back to you your
[1:10:39] hat is what condemn you is out of the
[1:10:41] abundance of your hat that define you
[1:10:44] what comes on inside idea
[1:10:46] will you the world won't you doctor
[1:10:49] change for you not a thought for you
[1:10:55] that's why he released Jesus to come and
[1:10:58] deliver you goddess will is much into
[1:11:01] hell you may not think that but a
[1:11:03] balance all the makeup all the mascara
[1:11:06] all the pink pieces he saw it in hell
[1:11:09] when he saw it on the earth he say hell
[1:11:12] has come up to the it so all them
[1:11:14] tattoos and all I'm thinking doing the
[1:11:16] wind and air in here and this side here
[1:11:18] what kind of stuff is on hell but heaven
[1:11:20] also came down and heaven consists of
[1:11:23] the will and a power cane don't heal the
[1:11:25] sick and raise the dead cast out Devils
[1:11:28] and when God took that prophet he didn't
[1:11:30] take the power I don't care what power
[1:11:32] let's the message you would look like
[1:11:34] but did not take the power took the
[1:11:37] prophet but not the power took the
[1:11:39] prophet but not the angel he took the
[1:11:40] prophet but not the Holy Ghost or glory
[1:11:43] not God the whole verses here the angel
[1:11:45] is here the word is here
[1:11:48] Loreena thought you know when I said the
[1:11:51] angel is here the Holy Ghost is here and
[1:11:55] don't put this here do anything about
[1:12:01] what God is about to do or glory not God

[1:14:11] we're gonna turn our Bibles to thank you
[1:14:14] positions marked up to 16 and also we
[1:14:19] wanna read from this 50 to 20 we want to
[1:14:22] read revelation 10 1 2 7 and revelation
[1:14:24] 13:1 50 of us each on a tank the
[1:14:28] assistant possible isaacman the
[1:14:30] lanthanum welders who'll in the fort our
[1:14:36] absence we certainly appreciate it
[1:14:38] amen so reading from mark 16 verse 15
[1:14:47] and he said unto them go ye into all the
[1:14:50] world and preach the gospel to every
[1:14:51] creature he was believed in as baptized
[1:14:54] shall be saved
[1:14:55] either believeth not shall be damned
[1:14:56] these signs shall follow them that
[1:14:59] believe in my name is cast out Devils

[1:15:06] any deadly thing it shall not hurt them
[1:15:07] they shall lay hands on the sick
[1:15:09] condition recover so then after the Lord
[1:15:12] had spoken unto them he was received up
[1:15:16] into heaven and sat on the right hand of
[1:15:20] God and they went forth and preached
[1:15:24] everywhere the Lord working with them
[1:15:27] and confirming the word with signs
[1:15:30] following amen he's not interested
[1:15:32] the Lord was receivable to heaven sat at
[1:15:37] the right hand of God and they ran for
[1:15:39] everywhere the Lord working with them
[1:15:41] confirming the word side that's
[1:15:43] interesting
[1:15:44] relation 10 is one on a mighty angel
[1:15:46] come down from heaven clothed with a
[1:15:49] cloud and a rainbow was upon his head
[1:15:51] his face was where the Sun is feet as

[1:16:00] loud voice when a landlord and when it
[1:16:02] cried seven thunders uttered a voices
[1:16:04] and when the seven thunders uttered a
[1:16:06] voices of the porter bright yet a voice
[1:16:10] I've never seen it to me seat up those
[1:16:11] things which the seven thunders uttered
[1:16:13] and write them not in the injuries I saw
[1:16:16] stand upon this
[1:16:17] see upon it lifted up his hand or heaven
[1:16:20] and swear by him that liveth for ever
[1:16:22] and ever who created heaven among the
[1:16:24] things that are there now on the earth
[1:16:26] and the things that therein are the sea
[1:16:28] and the things which are therein are
[1:16:30] that there should be here we go time no
[1:16:33] longer in other words time runs out but
[1:16:35] in the days of the voice the seventh
[1:16:37] angel when he shall begin to song the
[1:16:40] mystery of God should be finished as he
[1:16:42] hath declared to his servants the
[1:16:44] prophets revelation chapter 13 verse 8
[1:16:50] and all that dwell upon the earth shall
[1:16:53] worship Him whose names are not written

[1:30:06] folks like you and I fishermen and tax
[1:30:09] collector but they had a porter Lord and

[1:30:43] order in this year yeah they're going
[1:30:46] call back to zero at home because
[1:30:48] somebody drop dead but in this kingdom

[1:30:52] higher order in that King on the other
[1:30:54] one picked up the bills but then this
[1:30:56] day come there is no sickness he can't

[2:04:18] [Music]
[2:04:19] listen and when I said back to Eden I'm
[2:04:23] speaking about back to even before the
[2:04:24] fall
[2:04:29] before the for what's the let us make
[2:04:32] man in our image and likeness movie
[2:04:34] season violet image unlike this if I put
[2:04:49] a picture of me here image of me same
[2:04:51] height everything else as a commission
[2:04:52] me neither me you can make the image of
[2:04:56] the cardboard your committee image out
[2:04:58] of of wax but I know me that's the image
[2:05:02] well God made an image of himself but
[2:05:05] the material was spirit form
[2:05:11] he called Adam listen the seed of the
[2:05:15] wood but Jesus was the flesh of the
[2:05:20] world
[2:05:21] [Applause]
[2:05:22] [Music]
[2:05:24] so the full spirit life that was locked
[2:05:28] up in Adam and seafoam did not really
[2:05:31] unfold because he was a seed and seed
[2:05:40] have to unfold to becoming the full
[2:05:43] maturity so when God was producing the
[2:05:47] second Adam
[2:05:48] he never said let us make again you
[2:05:51] didn't say that no he's not virgin shall
[2:05:53] conceive he say I'm gonna put seed and
[2:05:56] say that you process to not possess this
[2:06:04] learned obedience my detective suffered
[2:06:10] that he had come and kurata that the
[2:06:14] first Adam did not have and the measure
[2:06:16] that was the approver image like this
[2:06:32] season is I mean of the wood
[2:06:34] I'm stone spirit here's a materialist
[2:06:39] spirit he was created in the beginning
[2:06:42] the Casaus interest is God even though
[2:06:46] the lodge and ambassador were you not
[2:06:48] lucky
[2:06:54] but because he angel fell the whole
[2:06:58] spirit of their bein become duck felt
[2:07:01] Elliott and Angels became Devils because
[2:07:05] they make a coup in heaven cause God
[2:07:08] didn't free choice and remain free reign
[2:07:10] whatever and say we was in nothing even
[2:07:12] back there he the angels that did not
[2:07:15] fall represented us

[2:28:39] God pretty report because you are seed
[2:28:42] you're gonna get the Holy Ghost because
[2:28:44] your name is on that book because you
[2:28:47] are son awesome praises praise God
[2:28:54] Island New York what God has done for us
[2:28:57] he said open up the new land a new
[2:29:00] message for this day there's seven seals
[2:29:02] which are the seven mysteries of the
[2:29:05] seven churches was sea with seven seals
[2:29:07] reformers enough time to do sanity it
[2:29:10] isn't long enough but this blessed
[2:29:12] revelation of seven seals open up the
[2:29:14] last days was from a prophecy that meant
[2:29:17] for them Arizona Luther preached
[2:29:19] justification but he didn't live long
[2:29:21] enough it went wild and after he died
[2:29:24] they organized it so it Wesley many of
[2:29:27] those things was left loose and when we
[2:29:29] come down to the end are you ready the
[2:29:33] last message is supposed to straighten
[2:29:36] it all up to bring these things to one
[2:29:39] fate one Lord one baptism what is that
[2:29:43] another vision so this last message is
[2:29:46] really another vision
[2:29:47] everybody could you make under visions
[2:29:49] because under fusion we have one faith
[2:29:51] one baptism
[2:29:52] I'm sorry fishes will be interpretations
[2:29:55] so all this revelation and mysteries and
[2:29:57] tunnels and seals supposed to bring the
[2:29:59] church and build a church and not
[2:30:01] Ephesians which is the same alpha church
[2:30:03] back here in the Omega and this of
[2:30:06] Ephesians in this last day is a hidden
[2:30:08] mystery that the devil knows nothing
[2:30:10] about because all the devil knows of the
[2:30:12] law this year but there's a prophecy
[2:30:14] hallelujah of another Ephesians the
[2:30:17] tongue in the Saudis year they forgot
[2:30:19] expecting that a perfect Church that a
[2:30:22] perfect holy spirit to book perfectly
[2:30:25] true a glorious church without spot or
[2:30:28] wrinkle men who has become the world and

[3:15:16] Saturday January 26 I'm saying it now
[3:15:19] just so you have duty notice will be our
[3:15:22] first youth service youth oriented
[3:15:24] service of 2019 Saturday January 26 at 5
[3:15:29] p.m. so marketing your calendars we will
[3:15:32] continue to repeat this announcement and
[3:15:34] as we would have said before it's used
[3:15:36] oriented all are welcome and for those
[3:15:40] who would have been in our youth
[3:15:41] services in the latter part of last year
[3:15:44] our youth services are very unique we
[3:15:47] don't preach in those services we have a
[3:15:49] conversation with the young people we
[3:15:52] take questions we answer questions we
[3:15:55] deal with current issues current
[3:15:57] challenges 245 the young people and by
[3:16:01] extension the entire church in such a
[3:16:03] time as this it's a great opportunity to
[3:16:06] learn from one another and to search
[3:16:08] through this
[3:16:09] and the prophets message with how to not
[3:16:12] just survive but overcome and thrive and
[3:16:15] succeed as as God wants us to so
[3:16:19] last and certainly not least if you are
[3:16:23] interested in volunteering we are
[3:16:25] looking for some volunteers to support
[3:16:28] the maintenance teams in the church so
[3:16:31] if you are interested in supporting the
[3:16:32] main Tina's efforts for the different
[3:16:35] groups and I really want to salute
[3:16:37] brother Steven for the vision of how
[3:16:39] this is managed the way it's done it's
[3:16:41] not a continuing or every week burden
[3:16:45] it's it's five or it's five or six it's
[3:16:47] six groups that rotate every six weeks
[3:16:49] and you have a responsibility to
[3:16:53] ensuring that God's house is kept in
[3:16:56] order so this way over the rotation
[3:16:59] cycle it's once every month and a half
[3:17:01] or so but you are on duty and this way
[3:17:05] the burden and the responsibility is
[3:17:07] shared as we work together for the
[3:17:11] kingdom of God amen
[3:17:12] as we went into 2019 is really about us
[3:17:17] getting more involved in supporting what
[3:17:20] God wants done and I truly believe in my
[3:17:22] heart that we who are here firstfruits
[3:17:25] for our families and for our loved ones
[3:17:28] who are coming brother Branham taught us
[3:17:30] that you know there are some people who
[3:17:32] they wouldn't come to church or see what
[3:17:34] happens here but you're our lives as we
[3:17:36] go out to them we'll be a testimony to
[3:17:38] reach to them you know and real
[3:17:40] Christianity is about service real
[3:17:42] Christianity is about living for other
[3:17:45] people and beloved Minister today the
[3:17:47] last message the last Commission the
[3:17:49] last name we encourage to go beyond our
[3:17:53] comfort zone your blessing always lies
[3:17:55] outside of your comfort zone but a
[3:17:57] random piece of message beyond the camp
[3:17:59] going beyond the camp their blessing
[3:18:01] always lies beyond your comfort zone
[3:18:03] where you go away of not going before so
[3:18:06] in this year I challenge you to put your
[3:18:09] shoulder to the wheel as a word
[3:18:11] helped in Samaria and we certainly
[3:18:14] looking for help in the maintenance area
