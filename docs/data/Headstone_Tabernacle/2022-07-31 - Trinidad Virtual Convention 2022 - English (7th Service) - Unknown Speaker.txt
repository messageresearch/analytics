hallelujah thank you jesus amen at this time we want to invite one of our minister and brethren to come and bring some greetings to us i know that will be a tremendous blessing you may have your seats says he comes forward god bless you so we bring greetings to the pastor brother theo ovid and the saints of headstone tabernacle on this virtual convention uh from the saints and trinidad at yadal tabernacle so tonight has fallen by lot to greet you all in the name of the lord jesus christ i want to take a short little thought on the war horse because cena we're talking about preparing for battle and that's the inspiration we want to look at the warhorse because we're under the message of elijah and elijah left a mantle for elisha so elisha when he got the mantle it was already a working mantra he left a inspired mantle hallelujah so our elijah in this day brother he left us a war horse brother a white charger by god's grace brother and he said i'll ride this trail one more time but he also said she will ride this trail one more time he also said we will ride this trail one more time so brother we are we have been left a horse to ride a trail so we find that horse in the scripture we find that was in job 39 19 so let's see if we can look at it quickly has doubt given the horse strength god is accent joe god continuing the parable as thou given the whole strength so he's a strong powerful anointed omnipotent supernatural horse god taken in natural type in the spiritual brother the strength is identified god's earthly strength is his word made flesh in his body so as much as god's word is made strengthen you the bride brother that is how strong god could be on the face of the earth and you realize just that question that god put the job there it shows predestination because has dow given the horse's strength where the horse get it from he was getting from almighty god he was didn't get his strength from his father he got his strength from almighty god who gave his grandfather grandfather grandfather the strength so all things that we have whatever man is brother he has got it from god so paul said why both why pretend to be better than somebody else when what you have you got it from god so brother it shows us predestination it shows us that we have inside of us the ability to ride at us the ability to be the other half the matching piece so that that that masterpiece hallelujah hallelujah the horse is the masterpiece we are the adapt piece of that masterpiece we are the merchant peace predestination and this this let's look a little bit at the horse here quickly just one or two verses uh has dog given the horse strength has dog clothed his neck with thunder so the neck of the horse is clothed with thunder and that word occluded clothed means dress where it means fully clothed and from the time we see dress where we realize brother that that is a terminology that the prophet used the prophet says that the fivefold is god's inner address where hallelujah the inner dress you're not the altar the inner one the one that is closer soul rather the five fold is god's inner dress wear so clothed the horse is clothed his neck is clothed so me just look at it here quickly has dough clothed his neck with thunder thunder is the main the main is the horse here the main is the tuck is the hair or the horse but his neck the horse here is on the back of the neck so the clothed represents the bride the dress wheel the the the five-fold that is the dress we are funny for the bride and the five-fold is what joins the head to the body so funny funny for they had anybody to be joined brother is truly the five-fold the prophet says this ministry of the son of man that unites the marriage of the bride the son of man joins the bride to the head hallelujah hallelujah but this the son of man brother is clothed in the mystery of the seven thunders that is that is where the son of man is clothed so on the back side of the book which is on the back part of the neck brother is where it is clothed and the fifo is clothed in thunder so let's continue by god's grace so verse 20 says can dao make him afraid as a grasshopper that horse is an anointed horse that horse is understanding the mystery of the seven thunders in his own life seeing himself seen christ in him the hope of glory and brother with christ in him he becomes a giant and all giants become grasshoppers so he's not afraid he's not afraid of any situation but he is the one that is an overcomer in all situations hands down make him afraid as a grasshopper the glory of his nurses his nostrils is terrible he pour it in the valley he keep pouring in the valley the horse as he ready to go out ready to go on into battle he scrapes with his foot in the valley pouring that is digging down and the prophet said we had to dig down deep to get his spiritual revelation so it's only when we get done in the spirit of revelation brother is there we could have the victory by the grace of god glory to god in the eyes so we look at that same point in the valley and in the valley brother the elijah elisha brother he told the kings that they have to dig ditches in that valley so a part of the victory is digging ditches in your valley brother to dig out all the trash and all the old tin cans and all the old uh social media links and all them things brother you gotta dig out all of that by god's grace to make room for brother for the inspiration to flow by god's grace you gotta dig that altar make room for the inspiration brother i said we gained a victory by the grace of god and he rejoices in his strength and he goes to media men so he's not afraid of the battle that horse brother is ready for the battle by god's grace it is us now who has to get in the spirit hallelujah so that we know we'll be ready to ride that horse by god's grace he said among the trumpets haha trumpets so he lived in a time of seven trumpets he lived in a time when the six seal is on the face of the earth he lived in a time when the jews have gone through their six trumpets and awaiting their seven trumpets and he lives on a in a time when the seventh trumpet is the same as the seven seal to us over here on the gentile side brother and you know is a is a war atmosphere that he's living in brother and he's not afraid of the troubles he said among the trumpets ha ha he smelled the battle of fire of the thunder of the captains and the shelter so there are other captains and there's others shouting and there are other men claiming brother to be the man of the hour brother but the only man of the hour is the lord jesus christ brother and under the lord jesus christ the only man of the hour is malachi 4 and the bride under her messenger is a final voice to the final age so the other captains could be talking about thunders the other captains could be shouting and making noises and having messages but brother he says haha to that brother because he has not listened to they are shouting he is listening to these shouts which is the message of the hour by god's grace [Applause] 65 or 8 15. and when it did 262 i seen this man that called himself a prophet you know and he come up on a horse that was mixed with white and black together and said he got up behind this great big horse and said it was way up above the clouds so you see the horse a horse don't ride in the clouds but brother eliza was caught up on a chariot of fire brother and elisha said lord open the boy's eyes and when his eyes were open he saw horses and chariots of fire all around the mountain so there are supernatural horses that ride in the clouds brother and what has come to take us is a supernatural horse by god's grace so we are heaven-bound creatures hallelujah living in bodies our time so way up above the clouds and the road wasn't over about that wide and that was just dance and to the wind blowing the feathers and everything on on your garb and then the horse and the mane and tail blowing great master big white horse walking right in line and said this guy that's the other captain run up behind you and come from towards canada and the man lives in canada and he said come back and said he took his little horse trying to knock your big horse off trying to turn him around make his hips hit against uh it never moved the big horse he just kept walking he says ha ha he laughed because whatever they try against you brother you are standing on christ the solid rock all at the ground is sinking zone whether we stay in plum direct center in the messenger of the hour and then all of a sudden said you turned around and said that would be the third time you spoke but the second time you said all right and you didn't speak like you did you commanded said you turned around and called that man by name so sometimes you have to confront the other captains oh my gosh and get said get off of here you know that no man can ride this road here without god being ordained him to do it brother get out of here so that's what so the war is not out there with america and the missiles the pelton at ukraine but the war is right in here brother in the two spirits in the framework of the church brother god be the glory to god be the glory god bless you headstone tabernacle thank you for the little time of inspiration and time to give a greeting

undertake for each one of us lord as we all such a needy people we thank you father and command the blessing in jesus name amen amen god bless you and it's so good to be back in the convention again and i want to say firstly to brother theo ovie and his specialist wife and family and the church to say bro we thank you one more time for uh bringing us together for this convention and um for the invasion to speak to a portion of the bible jesus christ one more time and also to my vision uh uh to the ministers the pastors and the believers from around the world who are watching and or who will watch we thank you for um making the convention because without you there will be no convention and to my ministering brethren my way of preaching or testimonies i want to say thank you thank you very much for your ministries always but especially in this convention here and i always consider myself privileged to be numbered among you to put my shoulder to the wheel with you to push it all on to the coming of the lord god richly bless you if you have your bibles election my attention to um three portions of scripture genesis 3 ephesians 6 and revelation 21. genesis 6 6 genesis 3 ephesians 6 and revelation 21. genesis genesis 3 are read from verse 15. and i'll put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed it shall bruise the head and thou shall bruise his heel ephesians 6 verse 10 through verse 13 finally my brethren be strong in the lord and in the power of his might put on the whole armor of god that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places wherefore take unto you the whole armor of god that you may be able to withstand in the evil day and i haven't done all to stand and finally revelation 21 and verse 2. and i john saw the holy city new jerusalem coming down from god out of heaven prepared as a bride adult for her husband may lord harry's blessings the reading of his holy words may please be seated and my title uh for this service here is the preparation and i got some connect scriptures here colossians 3 and verse 16 and hebrews 4 12. the preparation now we've got a great subject here brother theo's um inspiration for this convention here is um preparation for the battle and we know what battle are we talking about the battle is the coming of the lord and brother banham taught us that that's the great battle the rapture the coming of the lord and we know elijah was prepared by the word for his rapture enoch was prepared by his what by the word of god for his rapture and thank god god sent a prophet in this end time here with the word of the living god and he has prepared a bride for the rapture in the skies so the battle we are talking about is the coming of the lord but then we know life is also a battle life is a battle life is an ongoing constant battle day in day out day in day out and we have got to prepare for that battle also because if we don't fight the battle we can never hope to win the battle in the coming of the lord at the end of the road so this battle here the daily battles that we fight every single one of us as human beings as are in this battle we have no choice in the matter just being here at all human beings we are part of the battle because the original battle was the war in heaven and brother banham taught us that war became human battles when the devil was cast out of heaven and that war came upon every man every woman boy and girl on the face of the earth or who would ever come on the face of the earth when adam and eve fell by sin and so the battle of angels in heaven has become human battles and we are part of this battle so we have these daily battles that we have as human beings raging in the human mind and then we have the battle the great battle for the coming of the lord so we are all in this battle whether we are christians and all christians is a battle it has become the battle of human beings the war in heaven and the battle of human beings are connected together the battle that you and i face every day is the war in heaven in continuum so here we are talking about the preparation and so we have got to prepare for a daily everyday battles because really if you do not prepare and overcome in the daily everyday battles we are not going to be able to be there overcomers in that great battle when the law shall come to take his wedding bride and capture when the rapture in the skies so these two battles are connected together as a matter of fact they are one and the same battle they only deal with different aspects of our lives one dealing with life daily life daily grind of life and one dealing with the godliness aspect of it amen to go in the rapture in the in the skies when the lord comes to catch his by the way so this battle here is addressing two segments of our lives the life ungodliness elements and segments of our lives as peter ii peter one tells us let us understand and the bible demarcates our lives into those two segments life and godliness but it's all one and the same thing on the greatest battle ever thought brother banham said here paragraph 62 and paragraph 63. um brother branham said um just a minute here all right this great first battle that was fought begin in heaven when michaels and his angels fought against lucifer and his angels it first chatted the first battle was in heaven so sin did not originate on earth it originated in heaven and then it was thrown down from heaven cast out of heaven to the earth and this battle fell on human beings and it fell on human beings then the battle from angels became human battles and satan come to destroy god's creation what god had created to be for himself he had satan come to destroy that's what his purpose was was to destroy it then the battle begin here on earth and begin in us and has been raging ever since amen so the war in heaven the original battle has become a battle that all of us are involved in and thank god he sent a prophet with a message to prepare us to know how to overcome in this battle so there are two battles here the battle of daily life and the battle the great battle the coming of the lord now at the fall when adam and i fell by sin and god came down adam adam where are thou and what happened and all of that then when they told him and then god began to give his verdict began to speak about the new order where before they were called equal he's changing the order now amen to where adam was head and if was going to be you know uh uh uh accountable to her husband and then god spoke to the serpent and that's where we saw how the battle from heaven became human battles genesis 3 15 and i will put enmity that's a war that's a battle between thee and the woman in other words between you and the human race the woman representing the human race and between thy seed and her seed and the seed of the woman every bible reader knows that's jesus christ so here is god demarcating two battles here but all one and the same thing lucifer is behind all both of the battles one with the human race every day grind battling you day in and out to detail you and distract you from the purpose of god in your life and the other battle with the seed of the woman christ jesus the coming of the lord brother banham said so we see the battles here these battles here will go on the daily battle the human battles that we all go through will be here with us and we'll go on every single day until the coming of the lord when the lord will consume it all and there will be no more war so means these battles will be here with us until the coming of the seed of the woman jesus christ and you know he comes three times firstly he came to israel as a little baby in the manger secondly he comes for his bride for the rapture undergoing home and then nextly the third time he comes he comes with his bride for the millennium and the kingdom age so when this battle and because we're in the battle we're going to know how to prepare for the battle because jesus said no man goes to war without preparing for it no man goes to war without sitting down and knowing how to face the enemy and when he has he sits down you know do i have enough men to do it do i have enough ammunition do i have enough what it takes do i have the wherewithal to face this enemy you prepare for battle you prepare for war you prepare to take on the enemy and that's only human to do so the preparation in these battles here because the battle is one and the same just addressing different segments of our life the daily grind home school work play food shelter and all of that and then the the the things that that pertain essentially unto salvation the weightier matters of life that have to do driving you to the coming of the lord because they are one and the same thing just different aspects of the same battle the preparation for the battle for the two battles is one and the same thing the preparation is based upon a simple but profound bible principle what is the preparation how do we prepare for this battle we said malacca for came with the world to prepare a bride for the coming of lord we know that but let's go in the scriptures and and and see how this preparation actually takes place the preparation is based upon a simple premise a simple principle genesis 1 26 28 that was god preparing adam because brother banham said god never does anything without preparation he always prepares before he does anything and before god will bring adam or any man on the face of the other dog he prepared him to face the challenges and the battles they would face on the face of the earth here god never does anything incomplete and that's what god did he prepared the man that is sent on the face of the earth to face the battles he will find on the face of the earth here brother branham on the message preparation 11 11 53 he said now preparation god before he does anything he always prepares for it and it spoke in the bible before we go over to fight a war first we have to prepare for that war if you're gonna get married why you prepared for that time and you have preparations and before you come to church you made preparations the ambulance to bring you or your loved one to bring you or you had to get a certain amount of money ready before you could come it's preparations and god always prepares the people for the events that's just about to happen so god prepared adam before he sent him to the world and that's why god every age every time he's always been there with his word to prepare his people for what's going to come on the scene on the message he said also here now he's preparing for the opening of those seven seals of redemption see that's what the fifth chapter is this is revelation chapter five that's the reason i kind of read it and then just take it from there and talk on it and give the other parts of the scripture it's because it isn't vast by verse but something that's happening it's preparing for something to happen and watch this provence profanity many made here and if you get the preparation then you are ready for it then so in other words if we get this preparation for battle right we are ready for the battle then ready as in we are going to overcome in the battle our success in the battle is a foregone conclusion if we get the preparation right and if you get the preparation right then you are just ready for it then and that's the way it is by faith or anything else whatever it is school work play whatever career get the preparation right and you are ready for it then that's why we go to school to get the preparation and foundation right so we can have a a a career and anything for that's how it is by faith or anything else get the preparation right first and then the main event is a walk over so this principle here of preparation how do we prepare very simple but very profound principle found in the bible god in preparing adam he made him a spirit man first and that was the preparation and then after that he put him in a body of flesh and the spirit man the soul of adam lived out through his body of flesh so the preparation was there first and then the preparation lived out through the flesh and that side is with with faith or anything else we prepare first on the inside and then the outside carries it out simple but very profound principle of scripture in other words the spirit on the inside the sword on the inside is what lives out on the outside in other words this flesh here is only carrying out what the inside inner man is determined to do on the outside in other words is the inner man that lives out it's never the other way around the inner man is the control tower the inner man is the power the inner man is the boss that controls what happens on the outside so whatever we want to achieve in our lives must take place on the inside first in the soul first in the inner man first in the spirit man first the inner man must be in agreement or will be fighting a losing battle will stand no fighting chance no fighting chance if the inner man is not in agreement with what we want to do on the outside in other words you want to live a christian life on the outside and the inner man is not changed in agreement with the christian life and christian principles of the life of christ you cannot do it whatever you do is that fill the rocks before god but when the spirit of god comes inside and changes the inner man then the change is affected and seen on the outside very simple but very profound principle preparation takes place within preparation takes place on the inside and that's how it is with faith or anything else get preparation right you have the event then you have the major event the main event as a walk over we want to prepare children for life that's why it says in the bible train up a child prepare the child by training him to face life train up a child in the way that he should go when he is old he will not depart from it if that training is done right and properly done right it's done to train that child's inner man on the inside of him so that child himself has an appreciation of the training why this and why that why he should and why should not do this or do that and when that child has been properly trained then he can face life and take the battles of life and stand a chance of succeeding in life at all so god who knows that man is going to face a lot of like bad tools in life because god is the author of life the author of all life he sees the beginning from the end this is the end from the beginning so god knowing what's putting adam here bringing adam here and he knows the challenges adam was going to face he knows the battles that i'm going to face he knows what's going to happen so he prepared him and the best way god could prepare adam with the best way he knew then the best way he knows now the best way to always be because god never does anything wrong his best his first decision is always the best decision so god he created man a spirit man made him a soul made man is soul a spirit man and spoke to that spirit man and gave all the capabilities of the spirit man and gave that man all that he needs that soul that spirit man all he needs to live a phenomenal life on the face of the earth here facing any challenge and triumphing over them in it facing every battle and triumphing over every battle of life that he was going to face why did god do this god's walking from a place of experience god is coming from a place of experience because god knows the spirit is what overcomes the spirit is what can can overcome in the battle because when the original was said in heaven lucifer and his angels what overcame the spirit body michael and his angels michael the holy spirit today is the mention of the angel michael the holy spirit up in heaven which stood lucifer and his angels lucifer fought michael for lucifer fought michael frost the spirit of god eventually pushed the devil out of heaven and their place was found normal and they came on the face of the earth so god coming from a place of knowledge a place of knowing that the spirit of god the spirit is what can overcome every battle and when he came on the face of the earth before he created man the earth went into like chaos and genesis one and verse two let us let us know the earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the earth genesis 1 1 and 2 let us know that and before god said let there be light the bible says in all that chaos in the midst of all that chaos on the face of the earth nothing like that since that time nothing like that ever since where there was a flood all over the earth not in one county not in one state not in one nation all over the earth you could not have a greater problem than that you cannot have a greater challenge on your hands than that you're gonna have a greater battle on your hands than that but what did god do the spirit of god moved upon the face of the deep the spirit came down to face the challenge and then god said let there be light on those and in seven days in seven days that major chaos that was on the face of the earth was torn over into a beautiful garden of eden because of the presence of a spirit of god so god knew there's nothing better than he's gonna do for this is creation than to put the spirit on this make them a spirit man so that they can confront all of life's challenges with the spirit and the spirit is the power amen that's going to push every challenge back i'm going to overcome every difficulty in this case with god it was the spirit of god that did the battle and won and so god knows let's make them in our image after our likeness let's make them a spirit man like we are spirit let's make them spirit and with the spirit they can face life with a spirit that can face every battle with the spirit they can overcome and let's prepare them by the spirit to face every battle and so to properly equip his children in his image god made them a spirit man first the spirit man was the preparation and he had the power to face and triumph in all the battles that he would face and that's how god meet adam and send him here and spoke to him be fruitful be not the flesh the flesh wasn't in the picture yet be fruitful be be multiplied be subdue b replenish be dominant just be it go ahead and live a life beyond limits go ahead and demonstrate the greatness and the awesomeness and the glories and the power of god subduing every every enemies of doing every trial overcoming every battle because the spirit of god is on the inside of you so adam came here with the spirit of god within him which was the image of god on the inside of them the word image in adam seven spirits because god is a spirit and god is his spirit is of a seven-fold nature and he put that into adam and from the image he looked just like god the spirit of god amen in a measure was living in adam and with that adam lived a life on the face of the earth as an amateur god traversing the universe like the amateur god under god his father that he was living in greatness living in preeminences amen living a life beyond limits amen the glories and the power of god shining through him if a tree was too tall adam would have to calm down if a tree was blocking his view adam would try to move to the side whatever challenge whatever difficulty adam overcame them because the spirit of god was on the inside of him and then god put him into flesh and the flesh only carried out when he put in the flesh man became a living soul this spirit on the inside is the soul of man this what image was a soul of adam and the flesh only was there for the what image the spirit on the inside the soul on the inside to express itself through and the bible says man became a living soul the soul on the inside lived out through the flesh of man is the soul that leaves friends is the preparation on the inside when you get it right the main event is a breeze and god got it right unprepared adam by the spirit on the inside of him and every battle was a success in every battle was a conclusion for him adam lived a life of preeminence a life of greatness until the fall another for notice adam wasn't deceived but as a type of christ he went over and followed his wife eve so when adam told god the woman who you gave me he wasn't telling exactly the truth because the woman had nothing to do with it adam the bible tells us that adam was not deceived he of his own volition chose to go after his wife and brother let us know that was the type of christ too so at the fall adam lost it all he lost it all he lost the glory he lost the power his soul became polluted the glories and power and the majesty and the eminence and the preeminences that emanated from his soul he lost it all it fell from that great glory and when you fall you go right back to the ground again and adam felt like a little seed back into the ground again and this glory this what image became like a little seed a little button on the inside of adam god detect determining that for man adam or any man to get back to that glory and the magnificence and the greatness of eden before the fall they would have to grow into it they will have to grow into it and that's been the gospel story of redemption because right then then god restored back adam lost three things his eternal life his fellowship with god and his inheritance in life but right there and then god restored his eternal life glory stood his fellowship back but that inheritance in life that glory and majesty and power and from preeminence and greatness was not restored that was left as a journey man has to grow into it adam and eve very cheap they got character thrust upon them but character is not a gift they had it gifted to them from then on god said if they're going to get character they're going to have to label and fight for it character is a victory and that's why we're in preparation to get the character of jesus christ from in us to take us right back to the spot that adam and eve were in before they fell by sin in the garden of eden so the gospel story of redemption has been to take a joint has been a journey to take a journey back to this glory and power uh uh uh uh that that adams was veiled in the what image that lived in adam before the fall adam and sit after him will have to grow back into this glory now in all areas of life both in life and godliness they'll have to be prepared to grow into this air and in growing into it they'll have to face the bad tool every single day between thy seat between between you and the woman and between thy seed and her seed they have to face that every day and if you notice god changed the order and brought in elements of life and godliness and things there he probably changed the order where they were equal they were no longer equal adam was the head representing christ and the bride and then adam had to work he introduced into his work he had work in the garden of eden but now he had to walk and from the sweat of his brow from the sweat of his face from the heart walk the sweat of his brow the thinking the labor he had to walk to able to eat now not not punishment no god was changing the order that through these challenges here through this daily battles here adam and eve and their generations and their offspring after them will be would would fight their way back into the glories of eden so that no more will character be gifted to any man but they will have to label and fight and get character as a victory so they they they the the new order uh um spelled out for them uh um work and sweat and labor and parenthood and marriage and husband and wife and headship in the home and headship a generalian and motherhood and bringing up children all of the new order was what adam and eve had to face now and they had to battle and overcome those battles and keep those battles on and those battles have been answering them and they are still here with us labor work school play food shelter parents children upbringing leadership they are still here with us and will be here with us until the seed of the woman comes he was there with them in the autism many years until the pseudo-woman came and is still here with us today because the seat of the woman comes three times first to israel as a little baby in the manger then he we are waiting on his second coming now to come to this bride to take her away to take her away in the rupture in the skies and then he will come back again with his bride in the millennium for a thousand years so god identify for them the areas where they're going to do battle every single day career work sweat labor husband wife um mother parent father son daughter leadership all of that were battles they were going to live from here on out and those battles were designed by god so that adam and eve will add to themselves and grow in grace and add back on the character that they lost in eden at the fall this this this life was so designed by god to let these challenges come not to kill them not to destroy them and neither is to destroy us but so that through these battles the glory and the greatness of god will be built back in adam and eve and their offspring after them and every seed of god will grow back into the glory uh and majesty of eden that adam and eve had before the fall so this gospel story the story of redemption since the fall has been a battle of life a battle of godliness and we have got to be prepared we have got to be prepared to face these battles and god from the day one from very beginning send them messenger after messenger prophet after prophet and god himself was was originally the the king over them but he was rejected god got israel out of egypt you want to make a special nation off of them and he was the the king over them they lived not in a democracy they live in a theocracy where god control their life control everything about them it was a kingdom that lived under life and godliness it was a system of government where god was the ruler they had and control every aspect of their lives for their own good for their own benefit so they can grow back in grace and go back to the glory and the power of eden the road back to eden and the glory that adam lost in eden was veiled in the 3-4 mystery of god god started to play that right out right at the fall what is the threefold mr you and i know it god in christ in preeminences the preeminence that adam displayed that we saw the glory the power the majesty the life beyond limits the life where everything is possible in the natural in the spiritual where adam was absolutely an amateur god on the face of this idea that that life of preeminences why because the preeminent god had preeminences and control over adam adam's life was a testimony and a testament to the preeminence of god in the life of a man but when he lost that god began to walk towards this threefold mystery which was going to be unveiled at the coming of the seed of the woman to where the preeminences of god the greatness of god will be brought back into the life of human beings again through the seed of the woman so the first one of the three four mystery god and christ in preeminences how did the preeminences of god get into adam by the spirit of god the spirit of god brought the preeminence into adam and god spoke to that spoke his words into that soul be fruitful multiply replenish subdue the earth and dominate the earth and god he did that on adam when he fell when he lost all that the second adam jesus christ here he was to demonstrate again that preeminence the glory and the grace of god the power and the greatness of god in the lives of his children in the lives of his heritage god demonstrating that through jesus christ to be fruitful to multiply to replenish to subdue to live in domination never remain like jesus christ never a man on this face of the earth like him this was the second adam he showed us and demonstrated to us what life was under the first adam he showed us the glory and the power and the majesty of the word of god having a man a woman a boy and girl in absolute total control under god so that the preeminent god is their king and ruler right in their souls right on the inside of them and when they are in that state then they also will be in preeminences their life will exceed their life will show forth their lives will shine forth the greatness and the greatness and the glory and the preeminence of the god that they serve both in life and godliness and we saw jesus christ because growth was they had to grow back into it adam and eve didn't grow into it but every seed of adam had to go into and jesus christ even though he was god himself when he came here and lived in galilee he gave all men a chance what god intends for them to be and how they utterly so jesus the bible said he grew in faith he grew in grace he grew growth first fault of the threefold mystery jesus christ growing in grace and in favor and in stature with both god and man god and man life and godliness jesus grew [Music] in favor with both god and man growing in grace growing in stature growing in stature with both god and man said luke 2 i believe let us know that that jesus grew in favor and in stature and in grace with both god and man and that's what we saw when he came the glories of his power we saw the second adam and like romans 5 17 said by one man's sin we all fell and we lost it all but one man's obedience we are going to reign in life by one man that man jesus christ and that's what jesus christ came to do oh hallelujah glory to god amen and when jesus came here he spoke his words he spoke his words and the word of god that he spoke was the same spirit that was poured into adam in the preparation but you know the word is the spirit and the spirit is the word god is a spirit and there that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth but we are natural canal human beings fleshly human beings our human nature that's what it is only god's spirit changes anything about us there's no good thing in this flesh cannon natural and we cannot understand spiritual things we can understand the things of the spirit so god he can pour spreading to us like that so he broke it down and the spirit of god he it condescended into the world just like it in the beginning elohim the eternals be condescending to the a word body and so the same way the spirit of god become disguised as the world and when jesus came he was speaking the spirit of god but disguised as the world and he spoke the world he spoke the world and they who received the word of god they were receiving the spirit of god into their souls building them up like god built adam up he said the words that are speaking to you their spirit and their life and those disciples received his word they received the word because he said i've got to go away i came from the world i came from the father i came from the spirit and became the world i've got to go back to my father in other words i came from spirit i became the world i'm going back to the spirit because if i don't go away the spirit cannot come but when i go away i will come back to you again and he came back to the money of pentecost and the word that he spoke to them turned into spirit again and exploded and wrote a book of acts behind them and they took notice they have been with jesus christ they saw a people that was back like adam was in eden before the fall oh glory hallelujah glory to god amen down through the seven church edges and went and then nice air council she fell again but i will restore sea of the lord i will restore right back and god in this end time here has sent us a prophet the prophet elijah with the word of the living god all the seven spirits of god has come back to us in the form of a word message and you know for those who received that word that message all the lost in the church edges he brought it right back in the form of a word message seven spirits of god condescending into a word message and that what message has been preached to us and we have received it and that what is in the soul building us of forming the word image waiting for the time the spirit to fall again like only your pentecostal where the word will turn right back to the spirit again and this bride here of the end time will write another book of acts behind her so malacca for came with this word which is the spirit to prepare a bride for the battle the great battle of the coming of the lord and word on top of a word on top of a word unto the word you've been prepared he's been preparing you by the messenger malachi 4 amen prepare you in the inner man to face your daily battles preparing you linda man to overcome your daily battles preparing the inner man and you are growing in grace groaning grace preparing for the daily battles growing in grace the holy spirit of god adding the image of jesus christ you word on top of a word on top of a word on top of a word which is spirit on top of spirit on top of spirit in you forming the spirit of god on the inside of you oh hallelujah growing you into the word image in the inner man like adam genesis 123 in the inner man by the mechanics the learning of his word this the seed of the woman is coming to you came down in this edge here amen in the form of a prophet with a message and the seed of the woman is coming to you in the form of a one message coming to you amen so that you'll be a part of those people the group that will overcome in the battle when the seed of the woman when he takes his bride out of this world into the rapture in the skies and he normally comes in by the learning of his word he manifests that word by the spirit because the world has got to turn back the spirit because i come from my father's spirit and here i am the world but i go back to my father again and when i go back to my father i will come back to you as spirit the world the spirit becomes the word becomes a spirit and that's the manifestation that's the power and the glory that's the mighty power god displayed through his people on the face of the earth what is it friends is the seed of the woman coming to you in the learning of his world boy not only comes in by land on his word he manifests that word oh my just quickly one one quick quote here from god's provided place of worship 650425 brother branham said that the notice not only does he come in by the holy spirit with the learning of his word so you see when that what is coming is a spirit that is coming in but we don't know how to receive the spirit so the word has to come there first to bring it to where we can understand it and be prepared ready to receive the spirit so that we can take our preparation into this battle not only does he come in by the holy spirit with the learning of his word he manifests that word and what he's saying there the word comes in and the spirit anoints it and it turns into spirit again because the god is spirit the word will really spirit but god brought it down to where you and i can understand where human beings can understand god because we operate in the realm of words abcd and so god condescended his spirit down into the form of a word the word message and every word of god is spirit waiting for the time the season to turn right back into the spirit again and when it turns back in the spirit that's the manifestation oh glory to god hallelujah so the word coming to you malakai first words been preached back by far foreign ministry to you and i what is it is the seed of the woman jesus christ coming to you with the virtue seeds of his life it's his holy spirit his seven spirits coming in by the learning of his world coming in with the learning of his world is the seat of the woman coming to you in the form of the word a message from the back of the bible from that great elijah prophet but like i read him only comes in by the holy spirit with the line of his word he manifests that word and when he manifests that word is going to be the holy spirit coming down on top of the word that you have received in your soul and that word will be the spirit of god the seven full spirit of god like adam had in his preparation to face everybody here the battle at this end time here is the preparation to finish the battle of the coming of lord so we can go in the rapture in the skies and right now your everyday daily battles the preparation is going on the learning of this world the spirit of god on the inside of you facing every battle overcoming shaping you forming character in you amen overcoming the devil at every one of these tricks overcoming by the world overcoming by the spirit in the world the word of god amen hallelujah and so here we are waiting for the season and the time when god can see that's what's been going on our prophet has come and brought the seven spirits of god right back to us he has opened the seven seals and since the open of the seven seas god's been waiting for sons and daughters to go back to eden again he's opened the seven seas and gone all the way back to the man of god and gather back together for you and i all seven spirits of god in the form of a word message and a firefighter mystery after the prophet is cycling back from books and tips and recycling back every single promise that the prophet gave this pride here knowing that every word is the spirit of god in what form and when we receive that word we are only receiving the spirit where is it that word when it comes into when it go into the soul into the inner man on the inside of us what's going on is that that word is turning in there into spirit and that what is forming us into the spirit of god into the what image of jesus christ into an image exactly like god himself and then when god can see and look down and see his reflection and sees see his character see his behavior he sees us he sees us growing in grace god knows the time the hour and the season he sees us prepared not just facing the daily battles of life but prepared to face the world council of churches what does he do he sends down his dynamics he sends down the power of the holy ghost upon us to anoint the word in us and that what will turn into spirit on the inside of us instead of this right here and what would it be it would be the preparation again prepared by the what image in her right on the inside about the image of jesus christ on the inside of the bride like in genesis 1 26 to 28 but there's one more thing left that image like jesus 1 26 28 has to be put in flesh to work on the face of this earth here to demonstrate and be displayed so that all can see on the inside until god can see but on the outside man needs to see it that they'll take notice one more time that you have been with jesus christ so one more thing after the spirit anoints the word in your soul and forms you into seven living voices on the inside of you when god can see that then he'll send the spirit of god right back upon amen the word imagine you and anoint that word image into your flesh it will be like god taking the word image genesis 1 228 i'm putting it into flesh and everybody can see it and the devil can see the devil knows that the seed of the woman has come right back again and is in all of these people oh glory to god and then the seed of the woman will be living in your flesh the seed of the woman by his spirit will be shining through your clothes all around you the seed of the woman will be back and the spirit of god will be united in your flesh you and god's spirit will be united in your flesh and the people are going to take notice that you have been with jesus christ and that's the preparation to face the world council of churches oh glory to god amen the seed of the woman has come to you in adoption time to adopt you getting you ready for the battle and ready for the battle you're ready to freeze the world council of churches ready for the battle you had to go in the rapture in the skies and when the last name is adopted when the last name on the book is adopted when the last name has come to this preparation to go in the rapture in this case and defy gravity defy every battle the enemy can throw now a world cup touches every one of them once the last one has come to that spot to that preparation what will happen up will come the sleeping sins up they'll come and we'll go in the rapture together with them and the lord to be with lord in the air amen but before then once the last name is adopted there will be a 30 40 day rendezvous on the on this earth here to where the power of god will be displayed again like it was in the garden of eden before the fall the glory the majesty the the the greatness of eden of the glory of god the spirit of god united in the flesh of man will be displayed again before we go in the rapture in the skies both living and resurrected sins of all seven churches all the way back to adam will walk up and down this earth here it will be a spiritually restored event back on the face of the earth but we are going back to the physical event which is on the other side of the rapture and so we go in the rapture and come back after three and a half years to come back on the face of this earth here for a physical garden of eden and at that time lucifer and his angels will try to stop and stand against they never learn try to stand against the seed of the woman and it's bright in that great battle of american that will be the final edition of this great battle that you have been in preparation for amen this great battle that stay in heaven that will be the consummation of it when lucifer comes and other part of a man he'll be destroyed totally and the the seed of the woman jesus christ your lord will set up his kingdom husband and wife together for a thousand years of millennial reign on the face of the and the devil will be bound by eternal circumstances for those thousand years oh hallelujah at that time the great battle from heaven would have gone full cycle full cycle so here we are friends we are here looking for the dynamics of that promised world which is the spirit of the promised world we have received the world on top of a world on top of one to our souls forming the word imagine us in what form but it's going to be spirit jesus said if i don't go away the spirit cannot come but when this becomes i am coming back to you so the word of god we are receiving to our souls has got to turn back into spirit again and the dynamics of his promised world has promised us to do that to turn the world that we have received into spirit to from the one image in in this bride a living faith a living virtue a living knowledge a living temperance a living patience a living godliness i'm probably kind of leaving seven spirits of god living through this right here leave voices thundering out through the through whatever city they are on on the face of this world here and when god can see that he anoints their word into their flesh and that's gonna be the bread of jesus christ that has come to the grand finale and has totally triumphed over lucifer in the great battle of life what an hour to live for what a promise to live for god richly bless you make sure you be there make sure you be there take your word take it into your soul hide into the suckers of your soul the word of god is sharper than any soul it pierces to the divine asunder let it go deep down in your soul and take everything on like jesus christ out of there that you might be formed into the what image of jesus christ so when god can see that he comes right back and turns that word into spirit again and the spirit of god will unite with the flesh of man and you will be mrs lord jesus christ the word of god made flesh in you you will speak and your what will be backed demons will scream in your presence and god will do everything you speak it will be a command god bless you that's the promise we are living for that you hope to live for what a blessing what a hope god richly bless you [Music] baptized into the body
