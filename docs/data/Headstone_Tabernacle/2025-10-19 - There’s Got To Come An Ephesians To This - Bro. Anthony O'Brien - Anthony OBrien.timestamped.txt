[53:11] met up with brother Punch later in the
[53:13] week and he was testifying to me about
[53:15] the service. He told me he was in
[53:17] heavenly places. Praise God. So I know
[53:20] that uh billows were rolling over him.
[53:25] Amen. I could tell that he had uh seen
[53:27] the Lord. So we certainly thank God for
[53:29] his presence. Amen. So God bless you.
[53:31] Thank you so much uh for the music. And
[53:34] as we want to switch over uh to the word
[53:36] portion of the service, uh let's turn to
[53:39] our Bibles. We certainly um want to hear
[53:43] from the Lord this morning. I have three
[53:47] portion of scripture we want to read
[53:49] from this morning as well.
[53:52] Also certainly want to appreciate but a
[53:54] Gideon on Wednesday night.
[53:58] &gt;&gt; I don't know about you, but I was here
[53:59] for that one. Amen.
[54:01] And uh such a flow of the spirit
[54:05] &gt;&gt; and uh he was just rolling on uh from
[54:08] from thought to thought and by from
[54:10] strength to strength and uh it was just
[54:12] tremendous uh blessing. So uh I know the
[54:15] people were here were touched and you
[54:16] can see different ones in the audience
[54:18] were shouting on the word and we know
[54:21] that God is uh moving. God can use
[54:23] anybody to to speak. Um we just have to
[54:27] have faith to believe that he can speak
[54:29] to us even this morning. Praise God. Not
[54:31] about me or anyone else this morning,
[54:33] but what he wants to do this morning
[54:36] &gt;&gt; and what he wants to speak to us this
[54:38] morning. Amen. By his grace. So, let's
[54:41] just turn to three portions of
[54:42] scripture. We want to read from
[54:43] Zechariah 4 uh 6 and 7. We also want to
[54:48] read
[54:50] from uh
[54:53] yeah, kind of have it split up here, but
[54:55] Zechariah 4 6 and 7. We also want to
[54:57] read from Ephesians.
[54:59] um 4 uh 11 to uh to 13 there. Familiar
[55:04] scripture there and then of course we
[55:06] want to jump over to Romans 8 for a
[55:09] little bit. Amen.
[55:11] &gt;&gt; So just a few greetings and I know I
[55:13] usually just come with just one
[55:16] scripture
[55:17] and um and we just hit it right away.
[55:20] But uh this is what this is what
[55:22] unfolded to me um this time. And so I'm
[55:25] just trusting the Lord that he would
[55:27] lead us this morning to help us to uh
[55:29] say something to you that would be a
[55:31] blessing. Amen. So, so first we begin in
[55:35] Zechariah 4. Um want to read from 6 and
[55:38] 7. Amen. We know this one. Then he
[55:42] answered and spake unto me, saying, This
[55:44] is the word of the Lord unto Zerubbabel,
[55:47] saying, Not by might, nor by power, but
[55:51] by my spirit, sayeth the Lord of hosts,
[55:54] who art thou, oh great mountain before
[55:57] Zerubbabel. Thou shalt become a plain,
[56:01] and he shall bring forth the headstone
[56:03] thereof with shoutings, crying, grace,
[56:07] grace unto it. Now we want to switch
[56:10] over to um uh Ephesians 4 as I said uh
[56:16] and uh 11-13 there we want to read
[56:20] inclusively
[56:22] and it says and he gave some apostles
[56:26] and some prophets and some evangelists
[56:30] and some pastors and teachers for the
[56:33] perfecting of the saints for the work of
[56:36] the ministry for the edifying of the
[56:39] body of Christ till we all come in the
[56:42] unity of the faith and of the knowledge
[56:45] of the son of God unto a perfect man
[56:49] unto the measure of the stature of the
[56:52] fullness of Christ.
[56:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. And our last scripture we want to
[56:55] read from will be Romans 8 um from
[56:59] Romans 8 and verse one
[57:02] uh to 5.
[57:05] Romans 8 and verse one
[57:08] which says there is therefore now no
[57:10] condemnation
[57:12] to them which are in Christ Jesus who
[57:15] walked not after the flesh but after the
[57:19] spirit.
[57:21] For the law of the spirit of life in
[57:24] Christ Jesus hath made me free from the
[57:28] law of sin and death. For what the law
[57:31] could not do in that it was weak through
[57:34] the flesh. God sending his own son in
[57:37] the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin
[57:41] condemn sin in the flesh
[57:44] &gt;&gt; that the righteousness of the law might
[57:46] be fulfilled in us who walk not after
[57:50] the flesh but after the spirit. For they
[57:54] that are after the flesh do mind the
[57:57] things of the flesh, but they that are
[58:00] after the spirit, the things of the
[58:03] spirit. And skipping down to verse 14
[58:07] says, "For as many as are led by the
[58:09] spirit of God, they are the sons of God.
[58:14] For ye have not received the spirit of
[58:16] bondage against a fear, but ye have
[58:19] received the spirit of adoption, whereby
[58:23] we cry, "Aba, Father." The Spirit itself
[58:27] beareth witness with our spirit that we
[58:30] are the children of God. And if
[58:33] children, then hes, heirs of God, and
[58:38] joint hes with Christ. And if so be that
[58:41] we suffer with him, that we may be also
[58:45] glorified together. For I reckon that
[58:47] the sufferings of this present time are
[58:50] not worthy to be compared with the glory
[58:53] which shall be revealed in us. Let's
[58:56] stop right there. Amen. And we just bow
[58:57] our heads for a word of prayer. Almighty
[59:01] God, Lord, we are certainly gracious to
[59:04] you this morning. We thank you, Father,
[59:07] for your goodness. We thank you for your
[59:09] mercy. We thank you for your Holy Spirit
[59:12] that is here amongst your people, oh
[59:14] God, Father. And Lord, we are yielding
[59:17] to you now, Lord, for your perfect will
[59:19] to be done in this service in our lives,
[59:22] oh God, Father. And we pray there for a
[59:24] few moments as we dive into the word of
[59:27] God. And as we look to see what your
[59:29] scriptures behold for us today, we pray
[59:32] that you would open our understanding to
[59:33] the word this morning, Lord, just uh
[59:36] Lord, an uh inspiration to point the
[59:39] church in a particular direction this
[59:40] morning. Father, we just pray that you
[59:43] would come and direct us this morning.
[59:45] You you are our leader. You are our
[59:48] guide this morning. And Lord, you know
[59:50] what you have in store for us, Lord. No
[59:53] eye has seen, no ear has heard what is
[59:55] in store for us this morning. And so we
[59:58] are are yielding to you entirely,
[1:00:00] Father. For we know that what you have
[1:00:02] for us is good, Lord. Your intentions
[1:00:05] for us are good. Your purpose for us is
[1:00:08] good this morning. And so we just thank
[1:00:10] you for it. We pray for a few moments
[1:00:11] that you bless us this morning. Help us
[1:00:13] to enter in, Lord. Father, may your
[1:00:15] anointing just come and anoint the word
[1:00:17] of God as we speak and praise and pray
[1:00:20] around it. Dear God, Father, may your
[1:00:22] presence flow in in the precious name of
[1:00:25] Jesus Christ. Amen. And amen. You may
[1:00:28] have your seats.
[1:00:38] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the name of the Lord. Do you
[1:00:40] love him this morning?
[1:00:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Praise God. So far title I
[1:00:45] have this morning.
[1:00:47] My title is there's got to come an
[1:00:49] Ephesians to this.
[1:00:52] &gt;&gt; That's the title we have this morning.
[1:00:55] And for a subject, a message of grace.
[1:00:59] &gt;&gt; And so now I was asking God a a question
[1:01:01] in my heart and I was uh searching the
[1:01:04] Lord just around late of September
[1:01:06] there. And so I was thinking on the
[1:01:08] thought that uh how are we going to
[1:01:10] break into this anointing
[1:01:12] uh that we are supposed to come into in
[1:01:15] the last days? Uh the bride has an
[1:01:18] anointing for her day.
[1:01:20] &gt;&gt; Uh we see the world in their anointing.
[1:01:23] &gt;&gt; We see the political realm is in their
[1:01:25] anointing. We see the religious realm is
[1:01:28] in their anointing. We've got to find
[1:01:31] our anointing.
[1:01:33] &gt;&gt; We've got to find our purpose. We've got
[1:01:35] to find our calling for our day. We got
[1:01:37] to recognize our day and we got to
[1:01:40] recognize our message. Outside of that,
[1:01:43] we're just floundering around hoping
[1:01:45] that something will stick. Uh but this
[1:01:47] morning, God's bride is not floundering
[1:01:50] around. She's not throwing wet flour
[1:01:53] aimlessly at the wall hoping that it
[1:01:55] will stick. Uh that is not her purpose
[1:01:57] this morning. And God gives us
[1:01:59] revelation.
[1:02:00] &gt;&gt; And God reveals his word to us so that
[1:02:03] we can have a vision so that we can have
[1:02:06] a target, something that we are supposed
[1:02:08] to hit. In other words, before the
[1:02:11] rapture, God's going to come for a
[1:02:13] certain type of a church. And God has
[1:02:15] already outlined by his word what that
[1:02:18] church is going to be. God is coming
[1:02:20] back for a church. And God has already
[1:02:23] outlined by his word and by his prophet
[1:02:25] what that church is going to look like,
[1:02:28] what she's going to walk like, what
[1:02:30] she's going to talk like, what she's
[1:02:32] going to sound like. Oh, Alice, she's
[1:02:34] going to be another Ephesians. And
[1:02:37] brother Brandham said, it's got to be
[1:02:38] another Ephesians to this. Oh, Alice, I
[1:02:42] was asking myself the question, what
[1:02:43] will it take? Amen. What are we supposed
[1:02:45] to get into and what will it take to get
[1:02:48] into that? And after a while, Lord, it
[1:02:51] just just thundered to me. There's got
[1:02:53] to come another Ephesians to this. Amen.
[1:02:56] And the way it come to me, it just come
[1:02:58] with a sense of urgency. And so, I knew
[1:03:01] I had to get into uh what God was
[1:03:04] showing me. And so, of course, I went
[1:03:05] into a paradox. And there the prophet
[1:03:08] says this very same statement. Uh uh and
[1:03:11] the way he brought the message. Now, of
[1:03:13] course, we've heard this message many
[1:03:14] times, and I've heard it over and over.
[1:03:16] I'll pull quotes from it. We've preached
[1:03:17] from it. But somehow it was just aresh
[1:03:21] to me
[1:03:22] &gt;&gt; this time around
[1:03:23] &gt;&gt; because I'm listening to hear what God
[1:03:26] was pointing me to.
[1:03:27] &gt;&gt; And so I listen to it. And so the
[1:03:29] prophet on that message, he's laying
[1:03:31] some things out uh in the early part of
[1:03:34] the message. He doesn't even get into
[1:03:35] the meat of it. It just seemed like from
[1:03:37] the scripture, he just hits it right
[1:03:39] away and he starts laying some things
[1:03:41] out and it's almost like it's it's on
[1:03:43] his heart and he's just saying it and
[1:03:46] he's just unfolding it right there in
[1:03:48] front of us. And then a little while
[1:03:50] into the message, he says, "I'll just
[1:03:51] let that hang because we have the prayer
[1:03:54] line in a few minutes and I don't want
[1:03:56] to get on too much." But what he says
[1:03:58] there in the early part was very
[1:04:00] important. And I want to bring that back
[1:04:02] to us this morning as a reminder of his
[1:04:05] promises this morning.
[1:04:07] &gt;&gt; Is that all right?
[1:04:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So on that message, he does
[1:04:10] a few things there and what he says
[1:04:12] about another Ephesians. When he gets
[1:04:13] into it, it's astounding. So the prophet
[1:04:16] actually talks about law and grace and
[1:04:20] he began speaking about a transition,
[1:04:23] a change that is supposed to take place.
[1:04:26] He a spiritual switch where the church
[1:04:28] actually goes from one phase to another
[1:04:32] phase. A spiritual switch and another
[1:04:35] Ephesians is a bridge that announces
[1:04:38] that switch that he talks about that is
[1:04:41] prophesied to take place in the
[1:04:43] scripture. And this Ephesians as we know
[1:04:47] started with Pentecost. Isn't that
[1:04:49] right? Oh h it started with Pentecost
[1:04:52] and with the baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[1:04:54] And here what he says here on the
[1:04:56] Ephesians church age. Here's brother
[1:04:58] Brandham. He says it begins. The church
[1:05:01] began at Pentecost. Could anybody deny
[1:05:05] that? No sir. The church began at
[1:05:08] Pentecost with a Pentecostal blessing.
[1:05:13] And it was ordained by Jesus Christ to
[1:05:16] continue on into the last day with the
[1:05:19] same message. And that same blessing
[1:05:22] working in us. Oh, and his last
[1:05:25] commission to the church, St. Mark 16,
[1:05:29] was to go into all the world and preach
[1:05:33] the gospel, and these signs shall follow
[1:05:36] them that believe. Oh, hallelu. He said,
[1:05:39] now where? Go into all the world and
[1:05:43] preach to who? Every creature, black,
[1:05:46] brown, yellow, white, whatever creature
[1:05:51] it was. Preach the gospel to every
[1:05:55] creature. Heal the sick. In other words,
[1:05:58] raise the dead. In other words, cast out
[1:06:01] devils. We were commanded. Oh, the
[1:06:04] church at the beginning started at
[1:06:06] Pentecost with a good oldfashioned
[1:06:10] royal blue sinkilling. Oh, sky blue
[1:06:14] filling of the Holy Ghost. That's where
[1:06:16] the church started. Oh, hallelujah. If
[1:06:19] God started the church that way, he's
[1:06:21] got to end it that way with an
[1:06:23] oldfashioned sinkilling,
[1:06:26] sky blue filling of the Holy Ghost. Oh,
[1:06:30] hallelujah. Hallelujah. The church needs
[1:06:33] today is a refilling of the Holy Ghost
[1:06:38] that we have seen within a small
[1:06:41] measure. Why? The headstone is coming
[1:06:43] down to unite with the body. And when it
[1:06:47] unites with the body, the full power of
[1:06:52] the Holy Ghost will be restored to that
[1:06:56] church in the last days, said God. I'll
[1:07:00] pour out my spirit upon all flesh.
[1:07:05] That's what we're here for this morning.
[1:07:07] Do you believe it? Oh, is this what you
[1:07:10] came here for? Is this what you drove
[1:07:13] here for? We under expectation for the
[1:07:16] dynamics to pour out upon us. God wants
[1:07:19] to pour out the dynamics upon the
[1:07:22] church. Oh, and there's got to be
[1:07:25] another Ephesians of this. The angel is
[1:07:28] here waiting in Ephesians 4 for a people
[1:07:32] on the earth uh to get into perfection
[1:07:36] to come to perfection.
[1:07:39] Oh hallelujah. Hallelujah. That he can
[1:07:42] step into.
[1:07:44] Oh
[1:07:46] hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. God
[1:07:50] dresses himself in his commanding
[1:07:52] officers when the prophet is in his
[1:07:54] place. when the evangelist is in his
[1:07:56] face, when the pastor or the teacher,
[1:07:58] whatever it is, that's how God dresses
[1:08:01] himself. Uh when brother Brana was on
[1:08:04] the earth and he come to the fullness of
[1:08:06] his ministry, God dressed himself uh in
[1:08:10] that prophet, God stepped into that
[1:08:13] prophet and he said, "I represent this
[1:08:16] state uh by way of a divine gift." And I
[1:08:20] believe there's a people on the earth
[1:08:22] who God is going to dress himself in.
[1:08:26] He's going to step into your 16
[1:08:29] elements. He's going to wear your tie.
[1:08:32] He's going to put on your pants, your
[1:08:34] dress. He's going to wear your clothes.
[1:08:37] He's going to go to work with you. He's
[1:08:39] going to go to school with you. He's
[1:08:41] going to stand there as a testimony on
[1:08:45] the earth that the pyramid is on the
[1:08:47] earth. One more time.
[1:08:50] Oh,
[1:08:52] hallelujah. Do you believe it this
[1:08:54] morning? Glory.
[1:08:57] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So, we believe
[1:09:00] this morning that there's got to be
[1:09:03] another Ephesians to this, another
[1:09:06] perfect church. Brother Brandham said,
[1:09:09] "I want to walk into a perfect church."
[1:09:12] Oh, where sin cannot stay in that
[1:09:14] church. When that church is so anointed,
[1:09:17] when that church is so on fire for God,
[1:09:20] that five mile radius, angels are in
[1:09:24] charge and not within a 5 mile radius,
[1:09:27] people are screaming and giving up.
[1:09:30] Hallelujah. They are confessing their
[1:09:32] sins before they walk into the building.
[1:09:36] Hallelujah. Praise God. The anointing
[1:09:39] sweeping around the neighborhoods.
[1:09:41] People crying and they don't know why.
[1:09:43] They're praying and they don't know why.
[1:09:45] Because rainbow glory.
[1:09:48] Oh, it's dropped down in Sang Grande.
[1:09:50] Drop down in Wyman and Africa and Europe
[1:09:54] and America and wherever else.
[1:09:57] Holy Ghost moving
[1:09:59] some group over here, some group over
[1:10:01] there. Praise God. And then it'll be the
[1:10:03] general resurrection.
[1:10:05] That's the kind of church he's coming
[1:10:07] for.
[1:10:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we believe that without a
[1:10:10] doubt.
[1:10:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. Isn't that right? No sir. The
[1:10:13] church began at Pentecost with a
[1:10:15] Pentecostal blessing. Isn't that right?
[1:10:17] &gt;&gt; Go into all the world, preach a gospel.
[1:10:19] And today, if we have to have another
[1:10:20] Ephesians, it's got to start that same
[1:10:23] way. He is the same yesterday, today,
[1:10:26] and forever. He doesn't change his his
[1:10:29] his way of doing things. He doesn't
[1:10:32] change his way of operating. He doesn't
[1:10:35] change his modus operandi. Hallelujah.
[1:10:38] Hallelujah. However, he did it before,
[1:10:39] he's got to do it again. He's got to do
[1:10:42] it again. And we know that he's done it
[1:10:44] before, which gives us the confidence to
[1:10:46] ask him to do it again because he can do
[1:10:50] it again. If he healed the sick once, he
[1:10:53] can do it again. If he raised the dead
[1:10:56] once, he can do it again. If he made the
[1:10:59] cripples walk, if he made the blind see,
[1:11:02] if he ever filled somebody with the Holy
[1:11:05] Ghost, uh he can do it again this
[1:11:07] morning.
[1:11:08] right in 2025,
[1:11:10] you can receive the same Holy Ghost that
[1:11:14] Mary received. Come on, you sisters,
[1:11:18] believe for it. Come on, you brothers.
[1:11:21] This is not a time for giving up. This
[1:11:24] is not a time for backing down. Uh we
[1:11:26] believe the Holy Ghost uh is just as
[1:11:29] real as it was on the day of Pentecost.
[1:11:33] Oh, hallelujah.
[1:11:36] Oh, I pray you receive your anointing
[1:11:40] today. Oh, it's time for it.
[1:11:44] We see nations are breaking, Israel
[1:11:47] awakening, signs of the prophets are
[1:11:50] told, tension in Venezuela, tensions in
[1:11:53] the US on the verge of war. Brother, we
[1:11:57] got to get desperate to get next to God.
[1:12:00] We got to get desperate to get the
[1:12:02] token. Get the token or perish. Oh, but
[1:12:06] I'm convinced there's a people this
[1:12:07] morning who didn't wake up. Oh,
[1:12:09] hallelujah. Just because they had
[1:12:11] nowhere to go. No, no, no. They came in
[1:12:13] here because they had a desire in their
[1:12:16] heart. Sir, we would see Jesus. We need
[1:12:21] Jesus in Trinidad. I need Jesus in my
[1:12:24] home. Jesus for my family. I speak the
[1:12:28] name of Jesus. Oh, hallelujah.
[1:12:32] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Glory to God.
[1:12:35] Speak the name of Jesus this morning.
[1:12:37] Lift your hands right now and begin to
[1:12:40] speak Jesus over your doubts, over your
[1:12:44] fear, over your mind battle, over your
[1:12:47] sickness, over your disease, over every
[1:12:50] dark cloud. We rebuke the works of
[1:12:53] darkness and we say, "Let there be
[1:12:56] light."
[1:13:02] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. There's got to
[1:13:05] be another Ephesus to this.
[1:13:10] Oh, I declare to be so. You are the
[1:13:13] people that God has raised up to
[1:13:16] manifest another Ephesians, another
[1:13:20] perfect church, another anointed church,
[1:13:23] just before the end time,
[1:13:26] just before the devil comes in and runs
[1:13:28] it over.
[1:13:29] One more witness
[1:13:32] on the earth of Jesus in a people
[1:13:36] manifesting himself. Hallelujah. Glory.
[1:13:41] Oh, they believe it this morning. Well,
[1:13:44] that's a summary of it. Amen. Anyway, so
[1:13:47] whatever I say from here on out, it's
[1:13:48] based on that. Amen. Praise God. But
[1:13:50] he's the same yesterday, today, and
[1:13:51] forever. Isn't that right?
[1:13:53] &gt;&gt; What he did for them back there, he will
[1:13:56] do for you the same. He is alpha and
[1:13:59] omega.
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; He's the beginning and the end. And
[1:14:02] there's going to be another church at E
[1:14:04] like it was at Ephesus. This last day
[1:14:07] bride is going to be just like that same
[1:14:09] anointing.
[1:14:11] &gt;&gt; Carry that same presence, that same
[1:14:13] power. Let's listen to the prophet on
[1:14:15] adoption 1960. He said, "So Ephesus here
[1:14:20] sets us like Joshua positionally." You
[1:14:23] notice Joshua after crossing the land
[1:14:27] and taking the land then he divided the
[1:14:30] land he said Ephraim here Manasses over
[1:14:35] there this one over here God over here
[1:14:40] Benjamin over here oh prophet said he
[1:14:43] divided the land oh skipping this
[1:14:46] prophet said and Joshua not knowing this
[1:14:48] but by inspiration led of the Holy
[1:14:51] Spirit After being in the promised land
[1:14:55] gave each man his promise exactly what
[1:14:58] the Holy Spirit promised through the
[1:15:01] birth back there. Oh, every one of us oh
[1:15:05] are given a gift of according to the
[1:15:07] measure of grace that is upon your life.
[1:15:09] God knows what that gift is. God is
[1:15:13] going to give you your measure, your
[1:15:15] gift, your inheritance, your portion in
[1:15:19] the Holy Ghost. Your portion has your
[1:15:22] name on it. Your seat have your name on
[1:15:24] it. Don't you worry about any other
[1:15:26] seat. God's got a seat for you in his
[1:15:30] kingdom. And by his holy spirit, Joshua,
[1:15:33] the Holy Spirit is going to divide the
[1:15:36] land. He's going to lead us into the
[1:15:38] land. And we will conquer in his name.
[1:15:42] and proclaim uh that Jesus reigns and
[1:15:45] you are going to get your portion. You
[1:15:47] are going to get your inheritance. Oh,
[1:15:52] so brother Gideon, while we're waiting,
[1:15:54] we're working. And while we're working,
[1:15:56] we're waiting. And what we've seen work
[1:15:58] in a small measure. Oh, when that is
[1:16:00] perfect, you're going to get your
[1:16:03] portion. Oh,
[1:16:05] hallelujah.
[1:16:07] You've been given yours.
[1:16:09] You come to get yours this morning. Are
[1:16:12] you here for yours this morning? Are you
[1:16:14] here to get what's yours? Don't let the
[1:16:16] devil steal your joy. Steal your joy.
[1:16:19] Steal your joy. Joy in the Holy Ghost.
[1:16:22] You deserve to be happy. You deserve to
[1:16:25] smile. Let me let me let me let me let
[1:16:27] me tell you something. You deserve to be
[1:16:29] happy. You deserve to smile. You deserve
[1:16:33] to draw your shoulders back. I don't
[1:16:35] care what Trump does. I don't care what
[1:16:38] Maduro does. Uh, I'm from God. Uh, I go
[1:16:42] up to God. Uh, oh, I'm a son of God. Uh,
[1:16:45] I'm a daughter of Zion. Oh, can't no
[1:16:48] devil hold me down.
[1:16:51] Woo. Give the Lord a shout of praise.
[1:16:54] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:16:58] Oh, a little more in the monitors,
[1:17:00] please, if you can. Amen. Praise God.
[1:17:02] Hallelujah.
[1:17:04] Joshua not doing this but by inspiration
[1:17:07] &gt;&gt; led of the Holy Spirit
[1:17:09] &gt;&gt; after being in the promised land give
[1:17:11] each man his promise
[1:17:13] &gt;&gt; and the prophet said now how that God
[1:17:15] had set some in the church through the
[1:17:18] labor pains oh my they get tremendous
[1:17:21] sometime but when a church is groaning
[1:17:24] under the persecution of the outside
[1:17:26] world believing on the Lord Jesus that
[1:17:29] the promise of the Holy Ghost is just as
[1:17:32] real to
[1:17:33] as it was to Pentecost. How they groaned
[1:17:37] and cry under their labor pains. But
[1:17:40] when they are born and positionally
[1:17:43] born, that's what we come for this
[1:17:46] morning. To be born and positionally
[1:17:49] born. Not to warm a church bench, but to
[1:17:52] get desperate. We've got to receive the
[1:17:55] baptism of the Holy Ghost. You've got to
[1:17:58] receive the fiery seal of God's love
[1:18:02] stamped into your heart by the glorious
[1:18:05] baptism of the Holy Ghost. When God
[1:18:08] holds you by fire, when God holds you by
[1:18:11] anointing, burning out all the devils,
[1:18:14] burning out lust, burning out filth,
[1:18:17] burning out the world, burning out the
[1:18:20] devils out of you. It takes the Holy
[1:18:22] Ghost to do it this morning. Oh,
[1:18:25] hallelujah. That's what we're here for.
[1:18:29] That's what we come to receive. Oh, they
[1:18:32] believe it this morning. Hallelujah.
[1:18:35] Hallelujah. Another Ephesians. Oh my. We
[1:18:37] got to get into this. Let me hurry up.
[1:18:39] All right.
[1:18:43] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. Holy Ghost. Right.
[1:18:46] my
[1:18:49] &gt;&gt; how they grown and cry but then they're
[1:18:52] born
[1:18:54] &gt;&gt; and positionally born
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; means you born into a position.
[1:18:58] &gt;&gt; See he's identifying two things. First
[1:19:01] you're born birth down there but then
[1:19:03] you have to grow in God in order to come
[1:19:06] to your position at the top just before
[1:19:08] charity of love comes to seal the whole
[1:19:11] thing. Your position has got to be
[1:19:13] scripturally identified. your path, your
[1:19:16] walk has got to be scripturally
[1:19:18] identified. You've got to prove that
[1:19:20] you've got all these virtues inside of
[1:19:22] you living in you scripturally, which
[1:19:25] means God's got to test you on every one
[1:19:28] of those virtues. Do you have godliness?
[1:19:31] Do you have temperance? Do you have
[1:19:33] self-control? Can you bridle your tongue
[1:19:36] when things get out of hand? Or do you
[1:19:39] fly off the handle? Then you need
[1:19:41] temperance. You need godly temperance
[1:19:44] because your human temperance will snap.
[1:19:47] Your human temperance will break. And
[1:19:49] like brother Isaac said, God wants to
[1:19:50] make you unbreakable. And it takes the
[1:19:52] Holy Ghost to make you unbreakable. But
[1:19:56] first, he's got to break you in order to
[1:19:58] make you unbreakable. So God passes you
[1:20:01] through situations. He passes you
[1:20:04] through trials. What? To break you? To
[1:20:07] break you because you're too strong. You
[1:20:10] think you could do it. You think you got
[1:20:12] what it takes, but some of you need to
[1:20:14] surrender and learn that the hand of God
[1:20:17] is more short than your hand. He's more
[1:20:20] powerful in the situation. He's more
[1:20:22] powerful in the trial. Say, "Lord, I
[1:20:25] need you. I cannot do it on my own." And
[1:20:29] when you come to that surrender, then he
[1:20:32] steps in.
[1:20:34] Then he takes charge. Then he takes
[1:20:37] control.
[1:20:39] Oh, and you learn that his strength is
[1:20:42] perfect in your weakness. You learn that
[1:20:45] through your knees is how you get
[1:20:47] victory. Not when you're wrong and
[1:20:49] strong and you feel you've got it all
[1:20:50] figured out. No, you don't know nothing.
[1:20:53] You can't do nothing. You are nothing.
[1:20:56] Job said, "I uphold myself. I repent in
[1:20:59] dust and ashes. I need God." Every man
[1:21:03] that walked the earth here that ever met
[1:21:04] God says he need God. Do you need God
[1:21:09] this morning? Not the paper God, but a
[1:21:12] God of the Bible, a real God who can fix
[1:21:16] my circumstance. He can fix my husband.
[1:21:19] He can fix my wife. Oh God, he can fix
[1:21:23] me.
[1:21:25] &gt;&gt; Oh, I need fixing this morning. Oh, if
[1:21:28] you could use anything in this morning,
[1:21:29] oh God, you could use me. Take my hands.
[1:21:32] Take my feet. Oh, hallelujah.
[1:21:36] Hallelujah.
[1:21:38] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory.
[1:21:42] &gt;&gt; Got to come to a place like the prophet
[1:21:44] said, where the church will put away all
[1:21:46] its isms and all its differences, begin
[1:21:49] to plead the promises.
[1:21:52] Then you'll see a national showdown. Oh,
[1:21:55] hallelujah. Hallelujah. Then we'll meet
[1:21:57] Satan face to face. But you will have
[1:21:59] what it takes because God will put
[1:22:01] something in your soul that the world
[1:22:03] didn't give and the world cannot take
[1:22:06] away. Oh, hallelujah. Another Ephesians
[1:22:09] is here.
[1:22:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. They believe this morning.
[1:22:16] &gt;&gt; My
[1:22:19] So God set some in the church after
[1:22:21] they're born and positionally born. The
[1:22:23] Holy Ghost sets in the church. Joshua,
[1:22:26] the Holy Ghost, Amen. set some apostles,
[1:22:28] some prophets, some teachers, some
[1:22:31] pastors, some evangelists. And the
[1:22:33] prophet said, "Then he gave in there as
[1:22:35] well, speaking in tongues,
[1:22:37] interpretation of tongues, knowledge,
[1:22:39] wisdom, gifts of healing, all kinds of
[1:22:41] miracles, all nine gifts of the Holy
[1:22:43] Spirit restored to the church at that
[1:22:45] time when the church finds its place."
[1:22:48] Is nar. So this is a prophecy here. We
[1:22:50] believe that has to come to pass. And it
[1:22:53] comes to pass by the Holy Ghost setting
[1:22:55] in the church. Not what we set in the
[1:22:57] church, not what we've elected in, but
[1:23:00] what the pillar of fire sets in by an
[1:23:02] anointing that places you positionally
[1:23:05] into the kingdom of God as whatever God
[1:23:08] wants you to be. Pray. Whatever God
[1:23:11] wants me to be, that's what I want to
[1:23:13] be. I don't have to be a pastor, but I
[1:23:15] want to be in the bride. I don't have to
[1:23:17] be a minister, but I got to be in the
[1:23:18] bride. I don't bound to be a song
[1:23:20] leader. David said, "I rather be a
[1:23:22] doormat in the house of my God than a
[1:23:25] king in the tent of the wicked. Whatever
[1:23:28] place he's got for you, I'll be
[1:23:30] effective in my place. I'll take the
[1:23:33] lower seat." Oh, hallelujah. And let him
[1:23:35] promote you.
[1:23:37] Bring you from the back to the front.
[1:23:40] Amen.
[1:23:42] You put Prophet said if your pants leg
[1:23:45] or bagged in the knees. Oh. and you lift
[1:23:47] your eyes toward heaven, he'll take you
[1:23:49] over to the side somewhere and adopt you
[1:23:52] and then give you a gift and set you out
[1:23:55] into the world. Let the whole world know
[1:23:57] that he is with you. Amen. He identify
[1:24:00] himself with you and say, "This is my
[1:24:02] beloved son, my daughter in whom I'm
[1:24:04] well pleased." Amen. Hear ye him and
[1:24:07] hear ye her. Amen. Oh, the sisters are
[1:24:10] going to be adopted. That's right.
[1:24:12] &gt;&gt; The brothers are going to be That's
[1:24:14] right. the sons, the daughters, upon all
[1:24:17] flesh will I pour out my spirit. Say it
[1:24:20] God. That's what we're looking for.
[1:24:22] That's what we believe this morning. Is
[1:24:24] that what you believe? Then say amen.
[1:24:27] Praise God. Oh, it's okay. We got
[1:24:30] through that. So now a paradox here now.
[1:24:33] And the prophet said Joshua here is a
[1:24:35] book actually. He said it's a book of
[1:24:37] redemption of the Old Testament. He said
[1:24:40] Joshua we have to consider it or to be
[1:24:44] that the book of redemption because it's
[1:24:47] redemption and redemption has two parts.
[1:24:50] Prophet said redemption anywhere has two
[1:24:53] parts and that is out of and into. It
[1:24:58] takes two parts to make redemption out
[1:25:01] of and into. He said Moses represented
[1:25:05] the law. So that's that switch I was
[1:25:07] talking about.
[1:25:08] you come out of. But it's not just good
[1:25:11] enough to say we have come out. We've
[1:25:14] got to come into something. It's not
[1:25:16] just good enough to say we've come out
[1:25:17] of the world. We've come out of
[1:25:19] fornication, of lying and stealing. All
[1:25:21] that is fine, but now we've got to come
[1:25:23] into something. Come into our place.
[1:25:26] Come into our adoption. Come into our
[1:25:29] perfection. Come into healing. Come into
[1:25:32] grace this morning. Oh, hallelujah. Do
[1:25:34] you believe it?
[1:25:35] And the prophet said Moses represented
[1:25:37] the law which brought them out of Egypt
[1:25:40] and whereas Joshua represented grace
[1:25:43] that took them into the promised land.
[1:25:46] Another way was that the law and grace
[1:25:50] were two different aspects of God
[1:25:52] command.
[1:25:53] &gt;&gt; So that's the prophet said is another
[1:25:54] way of looking at it is that law and
[1:25:57] grace are really two different aspects
[1:26:00] of God's command. It's still God's
[1:26:03] command, but it's just two different
[1:26:05] aspects of it. And according to this, we
[1:26:08] see that the law comes first. Isn't that
[1:26:10] right? So he said, now the law brought
[1:26:12] them out, which was Moses and Joshua
[1:26:15] took them in. He said, it also
[1:26:18] represents something for our day. That's
[1:26:21] our day we're living in now. He said,
[1:26:23] "Now it represents that as they were in
[1:26:25] the journey, coming from Egypt into a
[1:26:28] promised land, so have we come out of a
[1:26:33] world of Egypt, out of chaos on our road
[1:26:38] to a promised land." Oh, hallelu come
[1:26:41] out of the world. But where are you
[1:26:43] going this morning? We are going to a
[1:26:45] promised land. We are going to a land
[1:26:48] flowing with milk and honey. We are
[1:26:50] going to a land flowing with healing,
[1:26:52] flowing with deliverance, flowing with
[1:26:55] breakthrough, flowing with restoration,
[1:26:58] restoration for your sons, restoration
[1:27:01] for your daughters, all that you love.
[1:27:04] And all that love you will be there.
[1:27:07] That's what we're going to. A Holy Ghost
[1:27:11] land of promises is what we are promised
[1:27:14] to possess in the last days. And I
[1:27:17] believe this morning, you are the
[1:27:19] church. You are the people that are
[1:27:21] going on to possess their individual
[1:27:24] inheritance. Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:27:28] Because the word is open to you. Oh,
[1:27:32] glory to God. Just as that third P would
[1:27:34] do. Amen. Hallelujah. It's here now. He
[1:27:38] said, and it also represents 24 day
[1:27:40] going coming out of going into. Isn't
[1:27:41] that right? He said, in my father's
[1:27:43] house there are many mansions. If it was
[1:27:46] not so, I would have told you. See, in
[1:27:49] John 14, coming out of and going into.
[1:27:53] Isn't that right? That's the transition
[1:27:55] we're talking about. It's coming out of
[1:27:58] and going into. It's coming out of
[1:28:00] darkness and coming into the light. It's
[1:28:04] coming out of ignorance and it's coming
[1:28:06] into knowledge. The prophet said,
[1:28:08] "You're going to understand it because
[1:28:10] there's going to come another Ephesians
[1:28:13] and it's going to be made plain to you."
[1:28:15] Oh, and the gospel is making B plain to
[1:28:17] you now. Not like it was back then. It
[1:28:20] was a mystery, but now it's been
[1:28:22] revealed. What is that mystery that has
[1:28:25] been hid from ages and generation and
[1:28:27] generation is now being revealed this
[1:28:30] morning. And what is that mystery? It is
[1:28:33] Christ in you. The hope of glory
[1:28:36] dwelling in you by a divine nature. Oh,
[1:28:40] hallelujah.
[1:28:42] Oh, glory to God in many, many men.
[1:28:45] Coming out of darkness, coming out of
[1:28:48] shame, into the glorious liberty of the
[1:28:51] sons of God. You're coming out of
[1:28:54] depression, coming out of frustration,
[1:28:57] coming into peace, coming into love,
[1:29:00] coming into joy, joy in the Holy Ghost.
[1:29:03] Yes. Yeah. Depression is not yours. Fear
[1:29:06] is not yours. Bondage is not yours.
[1:29:09] Corruption is not yours. The Bible said
[1:29:11] we have not received the spirit of
[1:29:14] bondage again to fear but we have
[1:29:17] received the spirit of adoption whereby
[1:29:20] we cry aba father the spirit of god is
[1:29:25] going to bear witness with your spirit
[1:29:27] that confusion doesn't belong to you
[1:29:30] depression doesn't belong to you
[1:29:32] frustration doesn't belong to you but
[1:29:34] I'm being called higher called higher
[1:29:37] place called to higher ground as it is
[1:29:40] in heaven. I'm being called up in
[1:29:42] heavenly places. The prophet said
[1:29:44] heavenly places is the believer's
[1:29:47] position in Christ. And when you
[1:29:49] understand your position, no devil can
[1:29:52] tell you otherwise. No devil can
[1:29:54] challenge you. You beat the devil
[1:29:57] anytime, anywhere, under any condition.
[1:30:03] Oh, because you know who you are and you
[1:30:07] know whose you are. Oh, amen. Do you
[1:30:11] believe it this morning? Oh, give him a
[1:30:13] shout of praise. Let me get some water
[1:30:15] here. Praise God. Amen.
[1:30:18] [Applause]
[1:30:24] &gt;&gt; My God. My God. Devil always fighting my
[1:30:27] truth when I come up here. I don't know.
[1:30:29] &gt;&gt; This week I saw truth. I rebuked the
[1:30:32] devil. I said I have to finish my
[1:30:33] course. So get the behind me. And no
[1:30:37] other symptom came. No body pain, no
[1:30:40] flu, no headache, no nothing. All it was
[1:30:42] was a sore throat. But don't mind that.
[1:30:45] I still chew my ginger. Amen.
[1:30:48] &gt;&gt; Praise God. You take the medicine.
[1:30:49] Praise God. But you pray and believe God
[1:30:51] and walk by faith. Don't you worry about
[1:30:54] the devil. Let your faith get stronger,
[1:30:57] stronger, stronger. Let your confidence
[1:31:00] rise in Joshua the Holy Spirit and his
[1:31:03] ability to lead you out of this
[1:31:05] darkness. and into your position in
[1:31:07] Christ. That's what we're here for this
[1:31:09] morning. Oh, hallelujah. Praise God.
[1:31:12] Amen.
[1:31:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:15] &gt;&gt; So, it's the law that brings us, the
[1:31:16] prophet said, the law brings us to
[1:31:18] recognize that we're wrong, but it is
[1:31:21] grace that forgives us.
[1:31:23] &gt;&gt; So, this is a switch he's talking about.
[1:31:24] It moves from law and to grace. And
[1:31:27] Ephesians is a bridge that takes you
[1:31:30] there. Oh, hallelujah. There's got to be
[1:31:32] another Ephesians where we see that
[1:31:34] transition from the law unto grace. A
[1:31:38] message of grace. Oh, hallelujah. To
[1:31:40] receive in the end time a message of
[1:31:43] grace by way of the Holy Spirit. If God
[1:31:46] is ever to pour out the Holy Ghost upon
[1:31:48] the church, it won't be by the prayer,
[1:31:50] but it will be by the grace of God that
[1:31:54] he will pour out the latter rain upon
[1:31:56] the church in the last day. Oh,
[1:32:00] hallelujah. for my latter rain uh in the
[1:32:03] first months, and the vat shall overflow
[1:32:05] with wine and oil. And I will restore
[1:32:08] unto you, sayeth God, all of the years
[1:32:13] that the canker worm and the caterpillar
[1:32:15] and the locust and the palmer had eaten
[1:32:19] off of that bride tree. It tried to take
[1:32:21] your joy, tried to take your peace, try
[1:32:23] to take your love. But the prophet said,
[1:32:26] "Here's the only hope I have left for
[1:32:29] the church." that while Samson was
[1:32:32] bound, another shock of here grew out.
[1:32:36] Samson was in prison, but he reached
[1:32:39] back and he felt those seven locks being
[1:32:42] restored day by day being restored
[1:32:45] service by service. Wednesday night
[1:32:48] after Wednesday night, Sunday night
[1:32:49] after Sunday night, his eyes might have
[1:32:52] been dug out. He might have felt
[1:32:54] defeated. He might have felt depressed.
[1:32:56] But the prophet said he reached back and
[1:32:59] a new shock ahead grow out. Oh, there is
[1:33:02] a crop somewhere this morning
[1:33:05] that's getting ready for that last great
[1:33:08] kill. Oh, you are the people that God
[1:33:12] has raised up. Take the sword of the
[1:33:14] word. Oh, and plunge it into the devil
[1:33:17] this morning. You are the ones. Don't
[1:33:20] look around for another. This is the
[1:33:23] moment. This is the time. Take your
[1:33:25] sword and plunge it at the heart of him.
[1:33:28] Praise God. Amen. Who's been tormenting
[1:33:30] you?
[1:33:31] &gt;&gt; Your hour is here now.
[1:33:33] &gt;&gt; Oh, do you believe it this morning?
[1:33:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. Wonderful. All right.
[1:33:39] &gt;&gt; Won't stay too long with you.
[1:33:41] &gt;&gt; Praise God. But here it is now. Message
[1:33:43] of grace.
[1:33:44] &gt;&gt; It's a message of grace.
[1:33:46] &gt;&gt; He said, "But now according to the
[1:33:47] prophecy,
[1:33:49] uh, this is on the message of grace."
[1:33:51] Prophet preach here. uh in paragraph 56
[1:33:53] he says but now according to the
[1:33:54] prophecy there will come the headstone
[1:33:57] &gt;&gt; and if you want to notice that when the
[1:33:59] headstone comes the prince that's going
[1:34:02] to cry out the message will cry grace
[1:34:05] grace
[1:34:07] excuse me for it's by grace we are saved
[1:34:11] not of works lest any man should boast
[1:34:14] oh so we're not here by our own works
[1:34:17] this morning we didn't bring ourselves
[1:34:19] this morning we didn't call ourselves
[1:34:21] elves this morning. But God who is rich
[1:34:24] in mercy, reach down amidst the muck,
[1:34:28] amidst the darkness of this world,
[1:34:30] amidst the darkness that is in the
[1:34:31] earth, amidst the cannival that is in
[1:34:34] Trinidad. God found your soul. God found
[1:34:37] your weary soul. God found your restless
[1:34:40] soul and he plucked you up out of the
[1:34:43] darkness, out of the dung hole and he
[1:34:46] raised you up for such a time as this.
[1:34:50] Get next to yourself. this morning.
[1:34:52] There's more to you than meets the eye.
[1:34:54] God put something in your soul that
[1:34:57] amidst all the doubts, you are still
[1:34:59] here this morning. Because deep down in
[1:35:03] the recesses of your heart, you still
[1:35:05] believe. You still believe that God
[1:35:08] could do something for you this morning.
[1:35:10] You still believe that amidst the fear,
[1:35:13] amidst the doubts, amidst the shadows,
[1:35:16] amidst the things you've been through,
[1:35:18] the faith inside your heart still holds
[1:35:21] to that word of promise. He promised to
[1:35:23] deliver. And I still believe this
[1:35:25] morning. He promised to help me. He
[1:35:28] promised to deliver me. He promised to
[1:35:30] restore. He promised to baptize. He
[1:35:33] promised to heal. Come on now. He
[1:35:36] promised to make a way where there
[1:35:38] seemed to be no way. I ask you a
[1:35:41] question this morning. Is anything uh is
[1:35:44] anything uh is anything uh too hard for
[1:35:48] God to do in this last day? Uh he
[1:35:51] transformed Abraham's body uh to bring
[1:35:54] forth the promise. He could do anything
[1:35:56] this morning. He could heal the sick. He
[1:35:59] could raise the dead. He could cast out
[1:36:02] devils. I know he's able cuz he's done
[1:36:05] it before.
[1:36:07] Oh, and the faith that was once
[1:36:09] delivered is being restored this
[1:36:12] morning. It's already restored.
[1:36:16] Oh, faith to believe it.
[1:36:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:19] &gt;&gt; It's just faith to walk into our
[1:36:20] promises this morning.
[1:36:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:22] &gt;&gt; To claim our inheritance. Amen. Oh, the
[1:36:26] season of dividing the land is coming.
[1:36:28] Amen.
[1:36:29] &gt;&gt; Holy Ghost is going to divide the land.
[1:36:32] give you what you've been longing for
[1:36:34] all these years,
[1:36:36] &gt;&gt; what you've been praying for all these
[1:36:38] years, that your sons and daughters
[1:36:40] shall prophesy upon your handmaids on
[1:36:42] their hands. Will I pour out my spirit?
[1:36:45] Oh, there's promise, friends, a pouring
[1:36:48] out of his spirit. There is promise,
[1:36:50] friends, another Ephesians. There is
[1:36:52] promise, friends, another church just
[1:36:55] like the early church, just like the
[1:36:57] early church had, just like Peter and
[1:36:59] Mary and James and them had. They had an
[1:37:02] experience with a risen Jesus Christ.
[1:37:04] And he told them, "Tar in the city of
[1:37:07] Jerusalem until you be Jude with power
[1:37:10] from on high. And they waited there.
[1:37:13] Didn't know how long to wait, but they
[1:37:15] were waiting because he said he was
[1:37:17] going to pour out upon them. And we
[1:37:19] don't know how long yet we have to wait.
[1:37:21] But we are waiting this morning. I am
[1:37:24] waiting this morning. I am waiting for a
[1:37:26] prophecy, a fresh prophecy. Oh, from the
[1:37:30] book. Prophesy again unto the four
[1:37:33] winds. Prophesy. Testify. Can these dry
[1:37:38] bones live? Yes, they can live. Seven
[1:37:42] thunders give me faith to believe that
[1:37:45] they can live. Oh, hallelujah.
[1:37:49] Hallelujah. Praise God. Amen.
[1:37:53] My my my my
[1:37:55] oh my.
[1:37:58] &gt;&gt; So God had me to study this message
[1:38:00] here. A message of grace. And this is
[1:38:04] what it is. It's being released upon the
[1:38:06] bride in the last days. That's why when
[1:38:08] the headstone comes, it come with
[1:38:10] shoutings crying grace, grace unto it.
[1:38:13] You are not perfecting yourself. He is
[1:38:16] going to perfect you. David said, "The
[1:38:19] Lord will perfect that which concerns
[1:38:22] me. You've got stuff you got to
[1:38:24] perfect." And God's got it covered this
[1:38:27] morning. You tell the devil right now,
[1:38:29] "God's got me. God's got it covered this
[1:38:32] morning. Don't worry about me. I'm not
[1:38:35] doing very well right now, but I'm not
[1:38:37] what I used to be. I've come a long way.
[1:38:41] You should have seen me when I was
[1:38:43] struggling, but I You should have seen
[1:38:45] me when I was growling. You could have
[1:38:46] seen me. I was crying when I was without
[1:38:49] hope, without God and his son. But then
[1:38:52] he reached down his hand for me and he
[1:38:56] pulled my soul out of darkness. Don't
[1:38:59] tell me this morning I can't come into
[1:39:01] the house of God uh and give my God
[1:39:04] glory. Don't tell me this morning I
[1:39:06] can't come into the house of God uh and
[1:39:09] give my God praise and give my God
[1:39:11] glory. I was created to worship my God
[1:39:15] and the sanctuary of my God. Uh I love
[1:39:18] Jesus because he loved me. Uh he loved
[1:39:21] my family and he saved me when I was
[1:39:25] dying. It's his grace.
[1:39:29] Oh, it's a message of grace.
[1:39:33] It's real to me this morning. Oh,
[1:39:37] hallelujah.
[1:39:39] [Applause]
[1:39:41] We've got a right to worship God this
[1:39:44] morning. Don't let the devil take it
[1:39:46] from you. My praise is still here. They
[1:39:50] can't take my Hallelujah.
[1:39:52] Oh, they could cut my arm off. They
[1:39:54] could cut my leg off. Oh, but every
[1:39:57] piece of me is going to scream
[1:39:59] hallelujah. You could cut me up into a
[1:40:01] thousand pieces. Every piece of me is
[1:40:04] going to scream glory to God. I made it
[1:40:07] to glory. I made it over. How I made it
[1:40:11] over. Oh, hallelujah.
[1:40:14] [Music]
[1:40:16] &gt;&gt; Oh, is that your determination this
[1:40:20] morning?
[1:40:21] [Applause]
[1:40:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:40:25] I don't know what's going to happen
[1:40:26] tomorrow.
[1:40:28] &gt;&gt; Apparently, war is imminent.
[1:40:31] Bible said you will hear of wars and
[1:40:33] rumors of wars, but the end is not yet.
[1:40:36] You will hear of earthquakes in diverse
[1:40:38] places. Right now, the Philippines is
[1:40:40] rocking on the magnitude of earthquake.
[1:40:42] 5 point something, 6 point something.
[1:40:44] Oh, but the end is not yet. Oh, don't
[1:40:47] you worry about all of that. The end is
[1:40:50] not yet. Though earthquakes come, though
[1:40:53] famine come, though pestilence come,
[1:40:56] though trouble come at every hand, the
[1:40:58] end is not yet. But this gospel has got
[1:41:01] to be preached first, then the end shall
[1:41:04] come. And these signs have got to follow
[1:41:07] them that believe in my name. They shall
[1:41:11] cast out devils. They shall speak with
[1:41:13] unknown tongues. And if there's any eat
[1:41:16] any deadly thing, it shall not harm
[1:41:18] them. That is the word of God that is
[1:41:21] going to be manifested first before the
[1:41:24] resurrection. Listen to me good. There's
[1:41:26] a church that's coming into adoption
[1:41:29] before the resurrection. There's a
[1:41:31] church that's going to be walking with
[1:41:33] God walking on two feet. She will be the
[1:41:36] manifestation of Jesus Christ on the
[1:41:39] earth. She's going to heal the sick. She
[1:41:42] is going to raise the dead. She is going
[1:41:44] to cast out devils. All the backsliders
[1:41:47] who struggling right now. We are going
[1:41:49] to speak to those devils and we will
[1:41:51] tear them out of the backsliders and
[1:41:54] bring them back into the fold of God.
[1:41:56] There's nothing you can stop the voice
[1:41:58] of God when he speaks and he's speaking
[1:42:01] this morning.
[1:42:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Oh, there's a
[1:42:09] bride on the earth who will speak like
[1:42:11] Jesus and she will take every spirit
[1:42:14] under her control for the glory of God.
[1:42:18] Do the same works that Jesus did in the
[1:42:20] prophet. He'll do for you the same.
[1:42:22] He'll do in you the same if you trust
[1:42:26] him. Praise God. If you continue to
[1:42:28] walk, more will unfold.
[1:42:32] &gt;&gt; Oh, that's the kingdom of God.
[1:42:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's the kingdom of God this
[1:42:36] morning.
[1:42:38] &gt;&gt; So, I want you to know this. It comes
[1:42:40] when the headstone comes, they'll cry,
[1:42:41] "Grace, grace." For it's by grace we are
[1:42:44] saved, not of works, lest any man should
[1:42:46] boast.
[1:42:48] &gt;&gt; Oh my. And the message of grace has been
[1:42:50] tramped under the feet of men until it's
[1:42:52] become a disgrace. Prophet said my
[1:42:55] unfortunately that's the situation now.
[1:42:57] Isn't that right? He said some of them
[1:43:00] run out into eternal security. Some run
[1:43:03] out into everything else.
[1:43:05] &gt;&gt; But the true message of grace remains
[1:43:08] the same. And there's where Satan tried
[1:43:10] to knock it out from the church. But
[1:43:13] it's the grace of God that we are all
[1:43:15] saved by. Oh, hallelujah this morning.
[1:43:18] Do you believe it? I'm standing here by
[1:43:21] the grace of God. Oh, I know that you
[1:43:24] know what I'm talking about this
[1:43:25] morning. I know that you know you're
[1:43:27] standing here by the grace of God. I
[1:43:30] know there's somebody here who could
[1:43:32] give witness to the fact that I would
[1:43:34] not have made it if it wasn't for God's
[1:43:36] grace. I got lost sometimes. I thought I
[1:43:40] knew where to go. I thought I knew I was
[1:43:43] going. But God came in his grace. Uh and
[1:43:46] he found me in the ditch. He found me
[1:43:49] with my wheel busted up. He said, "Don't
[1:43:51] worry, my son. I've got you in the palm
[1:43:54] of my hands." Uh and he led me on the
[1:43:57] right road. And he established my going.
[1:44:00] And he set my feet upon a rock. Uh I am
[1:44:03] standing in this building this morning.
[1:44:06] Not by my education, not by my power,
[1:44:09] not by my own might, but by his spirit,
[1:44:13] by his grace is how we all going to make
[1:44:16] it. We are going to make it by the grace
[1:44:19] of God. Not the works of man. Not the
[1:44:23] education, not the teaching, oh
[1:44:26] hallelujah, of man or the wisdom of man.
[1:44:29] But the grace of God is what found me in
[1:44:32] my lowliest state. Is what heard me. Is
[1:44:35] what answered my prayer. When the Lord
[1:44:38] said you did it, you were wrong. You
[1:44:40] ought to be destroyed. You ought to be
[1:44:43] killed. But right in that moment,
[1:44:45] sovereign grace stepped in. Love
[1:44:48] projected itself. And sovereign grace
[1:44:51] took my place and said, "I won't let him
[1:44:54] go. I won't let him fall to the ground.
[1:44:56] No, no, he's too precious to me. She's
[1:45:00] too precious to me." So the king of
[1:45:02] glory left his robe. He left his crown
[1:45:06] behind and he came down and became one
[1:45:10] of us and walked the streets of Galilee.
[1:45:13] He became one of us. And not only did he
[1:45:16] become one of us, but he felt our
[1:45:18] infirmities. He groaned with a headache.
[1:45:22] He was tired when he put him in the
[1:45:23] boat. Oh, but when he stood up, he said,
[1:45:27] "Roll away the stone." He was a man when
[1:45:30] he went for Lazarus. But when he said,
[1:45:32] "Roll away the stone." He became more
[1:45:35] than a man. And he said, "Lazarus,
[1:45:38] come forth." And the voice of God found
[1:45:42] Lazarus where he was. And the voice of
[1:45:45] God found you where you were. None shall
[1:45:48] be left behind. All that the father has
[1:45:52] given me will come.
[1:45:57] &gt;&gt; Oh, somebody praise him. Somebody
[1:46:00] worship him.
[1:46:04] Oh my.
[1:46:08] Oh my.
[1:46:10] &gt;&gt; But it's the grace of God.
[1:46:13] &gt;&gt; That we are all saved by.
[1:46:16] &gt;&gt; And so in the deity of Jesus Christ,
[1:46:18] &gt;&gt; the prophet said if the Lord God could
[1:46:20] come there and confirm that that's the
[1:46:22] truth. Not only that, but by his word
[1:46:24] confirms it's the truth.
[1:46:26] &gt;&gt; And by signs and wonders, he confirms
[1:46:28] it's the truth. And then also grace is
[1:46:30] the truth.
[1:46:32] Then he said, "How could anyone
[1:46:33] criticize and say that grace is wrong
[1:46:37] and that we are saved by works?" He
[1:46:40] said, "We are saved by grace." That true
[1:46:42] faith, not by works. We walk by faith,
[1:46:47] not by sight, not what we can see with
[1:46:49] our eyes, but what God has already done
[1:46:52] for us. Oh, hallelujah. He done it. We
[1:46:55] just believe it. We just receive it. We
[1:46:58] just accept it because it's already
[1:47:00] bought and paid for this morning. Oh,
[1:47:02] hallelujah. Paid for by his grace. Do
[1:47:05] you believe that this morning?
[1:47:06] &gt;&gt; Grace is what save you. Grace is what
[1:47:09] God does for you. Works is what you do
[1:47:13] for God. Oh, it's appropriated here.
[1:47:15] Now, you see that to show appreciation
[1:47:17] on what God did for you. Works is what
[1:47:20] you do for God. But it's by grace you
[1:47:23] are saved. Some people think because I
[1:47:25] go to church and put my name on a book
[1:47:28] that that's all that I have to do. Some
[1:47:30] people think it's because I shout that's
[1:47:32] all I have to do. Others think because I
[1:47:35] speak in tongues that's all I have to
[1:47:37] do. Some thinks but because I got the
[1:47:39] power to heal the sick that's all I have
[1:47:42] to do. The prophet said, "But it's not.
[1:47:44] It's the grace of God that saves you.
[1:47:48] God's amazing grace. I cannot trust in
[1:47:53] any merits of my own. Oh, do you believe
[1:47:55] that this morning?
[1:47:57] &gt;&gt; Some said, "Well, there's a great man.
[1:47:58] That man, I've heard him stand up and do
[1:48:00] this. I've heard him stand up and do
[1:48:01] that." But Paul said in 1 Corinthians
[1:48:03] 13, "Though I speak with the tongue of
[1:48:06] men and angels, and though I have
[1:48:08] discernment, though I have gifts to
[1:48:11] feed, and I'll take all my goods to feed
[1:48:13] the poor, though I can move mountains
[1:48:15] with faith." Oh, you don't hear me this
[1:48:17] morning. Though I have the knowledge to
[1:48:19] do all things, something is because a
[1:48:21] great man
[1:48:23] &gt;&gt; still turning all of the attention on a
[1:48:25] man of the hour or a man is supposed to
[1:48:27] do this and do that. Here's the prophet
[1:48:29] of God discounting it by the scripture
[1:48:31] here.
[1:48:32] &gt;&gt; He said, "Though I have the knowledge to
[1:48:33] understand all things, I am nothing
[1:48:37] until love comes in." He says, "Which is
[1:48:40] grace?"
[1:48:42] Love project itself. Grace takes its
[1:48:44] place. Love and grace is the same. Oh
[1:48:47] hallelujah. It's a grace of God that
[1:48:49] saves us this morning.
[1:48:51] &gt;&gt; So if we ever get to get into another
[1:48:53] Ephesians, if we are ever to find our
[1:48:55] place in Christ, it'll be by the grace
[1:48:58] of God. It will be God's grace to us
[1:49:00] before the foundation of the world that
[1:49:03] he had predestinated us unto adoption.
[1:49:07] Before he even created the world, he had
[1:49:09] a place for you and I. Oh, in heaven.
[1:49:12] And as it is in heaven, so shall it be
[1:49:15] on the earth. God's going to have a
[1:49:16] people on the earth, oh, to pattern
[1:49:18] themselves after the things that have
[1:49:21] been revealed in heaven. Oh, you're
[1:49:23] going to walk like Jesus. You're going
[1:49:24] to talk like Jesus. You are here what
[1:49:27] you are somewhere else. And if you have
[1:49:29] a position there, then you're going to
[1:49:31] find your place here. You are only
[1:49:33] representing here. What you are over
[1:49:36] there. You didn't come here. Hallelujah.
[1:49:38] Just a warm up bench. But you had to
[1:49:40] prove to the devil that you are
[1:49:43] something over there. And once it's
[1:49:45] revealed to you, it belongs to you.
[1:49:48] Therefore, you could walk in that
[1:49:50] confidence of your position. Once it's
[1:49:53] revealed to you, you could walk like a
[1:49:55] son, talk like a son, act like a son
[1:49:59] should.
[1:50:02] &gt;&gt; Oh, you don't hear me this morning. The
[1:50:04] prophet told a story one time about a
[1:50:06] slave was an African slave. He was a
[1:50:09] slave just like all the other slaves. He
[1:50:12] dig dirt just like all of them. He
[1:50:14] worked just like all of them. He got
[1:50:15] beat just like all of them. He was
[1:50:17] punished just like all of them. But
[1:50:19] despite the condition, he walked
[1:50:21] different. He talked different. He
[1:50:24] behaved different. He acted differently.
[1:50:26] From the time he woke up in the morning
[1:50:29] to the time he lay his head down at
[1:50:30] night. And they asked the slave owner,
[1:50:33] "What makes him so different?" Many
[1:50:36] wanted to buy him, but the slave owner
[1:50:38] said, "I can't give him up." There's
[1:50:40] just something different about him. only
[1:50:42] come to find out that that boy back in
[1:50:45] Africa, he is a prince of a of a royal
[1:50:50] kingdom back in Africa. And because he's
[1:50:52] a prince, he walks different, he talks
[1:50:55] different, he acts different, he behaves
[1:50:58] different, he prays different, he moves
[1:51:00] different despite the condition around
[1:51:03] him. And I tell you, brother, if you
[1:51:05] know who you are, if you really know
[1:51:08] what's inside of you, you'll walk
[1:51:10] different. You'll talk different. You'll
[1:51:12] act different. You'll pray different.
[1:51:15] Oh, I'm not hoping so. I know who my
[1:51:18] father is. And when I pray, I'm talking
[1:51:21] to my daddy. I'm talking to my father.
[1:51:25] He loves me and calls me his own. He
[1:51:29] purchased me on Calvar's tree by his
[1:51:32] grace.
[1:51:34] And that's how I am, who I am this
[1:51:37] morning. It's only by the grace of
[1:51:39] almighty God. Nothing else. No one else
[1:51:44] but Jesus. Oh, no other reason but
[1:51:47] Jesus. That's why when you come to
[1:51:49] church, our heart beats for him. Every
[1:51:52] song that we sing is a song of praise to
[1:51:54] him. Every praise is to our God. Every
[1:51:58] word of worship with one accord is to
[1:52:00] our God. Every praise, every cry upon
[1:52:04] your lips, every time you raise your
[1:52:06] hands, it's to a father who loves us and
[1:52:09] in his goodness pass us through trials.
[1:52:12] He in his wisdom sends our way. And we
[1:52:16] prove our love to God by displaying
[1:52:19] ourselves with the right attitude, the
[1:52:21] right behavior
[1:52:23] &gt;&gt; amidst the trials
[1:52:25] &gt;&gt; that he sends our way.
[1:52:27] Oh, you think you've seen anything yet?
[1:52:31] &gt;&gt; Harder trials are coming.
[1:52:34] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Isn't that right?
[1:52:37] &gt;&gt; Oh, we're entering into a real fearful
[1:52:40] time.
[1:52:41] &gt;&gt; But the bride ought not to be fearful
[1:52:44] &gt;&gt; because she has not received a spirit of
[1:52:46] bondage against fear. We have not
[1:52:49] received a spirit that allows us to
[1:52:50] cower in fear and to back down at the
[1:52:53] enemy. No, no, no. We have received a
[1:52:55] spirit that allows us to be bold, to
[1:52:57] enter the throne of God with boldness,
[1:53:00] and to ask for our portion, to ask for
[1:53:03] our inheritance. Give us this day our
[1:53:07] daily bread. We need it, Lord. Oh, all
[1:53:10] good things come from you this morning.
[1:53:12] Our help comes from you. You are my
[1:53:15] kindness. You are my rescue. You are my
[1:53:18] shelter. You are my storm from the
[1:53:20] storm.
[1:53:22] You are everything to me.
[1:53:24] &gt;&gt; And that's how we approach him because
[1:53:26] we know who we are this morning.
[1:53:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God. Where are we at
[1:53:30] now? Oh my. Gone so far up my nose. But
[1:53:33] let me just see if we could bring this
[1:53:34] all to our head here and then close out.
[1:53:36] Amen. Do you love him this morning?
[1:53:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Do I have water still? Okay.
[1:53:41] Yeah, I do. Amen. We are saved by grace
[1:53:44] through faith, not by works. Works show
[1:53:46] that you've been saved. But what save
[1:53:48] you is the grace of God. Isn't that
[1:53:51] right, God? It has nothing to do with
[1:53:53] it. You can do all these things and
[1:53:54] still be lost. It's grace that saves
[1:53:57] you. God's grace to the human race.
[1:54:00] Romans 8 says, "For the law of the
[1:54:01] spirit of life in Christ Jesus had made
[1:54:04] me free from the law of sin and death.
[1:54:07] For what the law could not do in that it
[1:54:10] was weak through the flesh." We read
[1:54:11] this earlier, right? God sending his own
[1:54:14] son in the likeness of sinful flesh and
[1:54:17] for sin condemned sin in the flesh. that
[1:54:20] the righteousness of the law might be
[1:54:22] fulfilled in us who walk not after the
[1:54:24] flesh but after the spirit. We are not
[1:54:27] walking after the flesh this morning,
[1:54:29] but we are walking after the spirit of
[1:54:31] God. Oh, hallelujah. Because we are the
[1:54:33] sons of God this morning. Somebody say
[1:54:36] amen. You're not walking after your
[1:54:37] fleshly desires. That is always going to
[1:54:40] lead you wrong. That is always going to
[1:54:42] lead you astray. That is always going to
[1:54:44] lead you plum off the word. But you've
[1:54:46] got to set your eyes upon heaven. Set
[1:54:49] your eyes upon the affections, upon
[1:54:51] things above. Set your eyes upon the
[1:54:53] word of God, and walk not after the
[1:54:56] flesh, but after the spirit of God. For
[1:54:59] they that walk after the spirit are the
[1:55:01] sons of God. That's who we are this
[1:55:03] morning. And that's what we come to
[1:55:05] believe. That's what we are going to
[1:55:07] live day by day. Isn't that right? Oh,
[1:55:11] hallelujah. In the message of grace
[1:55:12] again, the prophet said the grace was
[1:55:14] promised in the garden of Eden and the
[1:55:16] grace came. Grace to Adam and Eve, no
[1:55:20] nowhere to go. They said no which way to
[1:55:22] turn. And yet grace made a way. He said,
[1:55:25] "Let me say this, my sinner friend. You
[1:55:27] might be here this morning a prostitute.
[1:55:30] You might be here this morning a woman
[1:55:32] chaser. You may be here a drunkard or a
[1:55:34] gambler or a murderer. You may be here
[1:55:37] as an impure husband, an impure wife.
[1:55:39] You might be the vilest of sinner. You
[1:55:42] say, "I'm past that stage of
[1:55:44] redemption." The prophet said, "No,
[1:55:45] you're not. You wouldn't be at this
[1:55:48] church this morning if you were. He
[1:55:50] said, "But grace will make a way for you
[1:55:54] in this dark hour if you could just
[1:55:57] accept it." Oh, he said, "Adam had to be
[1:56:01] willing to accept it." And so do you
[1:56:03] this morning. You have to be willing to
[1:56:06] accept his grace. Oh, it come to a place
[1:56:09] where you can't save yourself. It would
[1:56:11] take God to save you. It would take God
[1:56:14] to deliver you. And it would take God to
[1:56:17] fulfill his promise to you and to fill
[1:56:19] you with the Holy Ghost to heal your
[1:56:22] wife, to heal your daughter, to heal
[1:56:24] your children. It would take the grace
[1:56:26] of God to do it. Oh,
[1:56:29] hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I
[1:56:32] thank God
[1:56:33] &gt;&gt; for his grace this morning.
[1:56:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:56:37] &gt;&gt; And the prophet said, "Hey, on a message
[1:56:39] here, ye him," he was talking about
[1:56:41] Moses and Elijah up there on Mount
[1:56:43] Transfiguration with Jesus. And they
[1:56:45] were having that ceremony. Isn't that
[1:56:47] right? Remember? And Jesus took Peter,
[1:56:49] James, and John. And they were all
[1:56:50] witnesses of what was happening up
[1:56:51] there. And when it was going on, these
[1:56:54] brothers felt so lively that they
[1:56:56] decided to come up with an
[1:56:58] interpretation of what was going on. And
[1:57:00] he said, "Let us build three
[1:57:01] tabernacles. One for Moses, one for
[1:57:04] Elijah, and one for Jesus." They wanted
[1:57:06] to start a new religion because they
[1:57:08] felt so lively about what was taking
[1:57:10] place. But before they could continue
[1:57:13] the interpretation, oh, a voice came
[1:57:15] from heaven and say, "This is my beloved
[1:57:18] son. Oh, in whom I'm well pleased is to
[1:57:22] dwell." Isn't that right? Hear ye him.
[1:57:24] And the prophet said here on this
[1:57:26] message, he said, "I'm so glad that God
[1:57:29] stopped that thing." He said, "What if
[1:57:31] we had kept the law? What if they had
[1:57:33] completed that tabernacle unto Moses?"
[1:57:35] He says the law has justice with no
[1:57:38] mercy. He said you cannot be saved by
[1:57:40] the law. He said the law has no
[1:57:43] salvation in it. He said the law only
[1:57:46] condemns you. It tells you you're a
[1:57:48] sinner and that you are guilty and it
[1:57:51] has no mercy. He says law is the
[1:57:53] policeman that throws you in jail
[1:57:56] without any way of getting out of it. He
[1:57:59] said, "I'm so glad that we don't have to
[1:58:02] listen to Moses because he brought the
[1:58:04] law and the prophets was justice." The
[1:58:07] prophet said, "I don't want God's
[1:58:08] justice." He said, "No, I want his
[1:58:12] mercy, not justice." He said, "If I had
[1:58:15] justice, I'd be condemned." But he said,
[1:58:18] "I need mercy." We need mercy this
[1:58:21] morning. Mercy for sins. Mercy for
[1:58:25] behavior. Mercy for our attitude. Mercy
[1:58:28] for the things we've said. Mercy for the
[1:58:31] things we've done. Mercy for our
[1:58:33] slothfulness. Mercy for our backsliding
[1:58:36] condition. We need mercy this morning.
[1:58:38] And God has mercy for you here this
[1:58:40] morning. It is the grace of God this
[1:58:43] morning that we are here that you could
[1:58:46] be covered and clothed in the blood of
[1:58:49] Jesus Christ uh that presents you
[1:58:51] blameless before you in love.
[1:58:53] God's blood is here to splash over your
[1:58:56] soul and to forgive you of all your
[1:58:59] sins, forgive you of all your hatred,
[1:59:02] your animosity, to forgive you of your
[1:59:04] unforgiveness, to forgive you of your
[1:59:06] unrepentantness. God is here. His grace
[1:59:09] is here to forgive you. To get that
[1:59:13] spirit off of you, to break that thing
[1:59:16] off of you. There is therefore now no
[1:59:19] condemnation.
[1:59:22] Oh, somebody give the Lord a shout.
[1:59:27] [Applause]
[1:59:31] &gt;&gt; My I wonder if you hear me this morning.
[1:59:33] Oh, we're getting ready to close now.
[1:59:34] Don't you worry. Amen. He said, "But
[1:59:36] Peter, oh my." Okay, what if he what
[1:59:39] about that thing? He said, "No, we
[1:59:40] didn't. We need mercy." All right,
[1:59:42] &gt;&gt; that's where I was. Amen. We want mercy.
[1:59:45] Amen. I don't plead for his justice. I
[1:59:47] plead for his mercy.
[1:59:50] Moses or Elijah or the one who were the
[1:59:52] prophets there he went up on the
[1:59:54] mountain and sat down there no one was
[1:59:56] to come near him and the king said 50
[1:59:58] men if if man be God let fire uh if if
[2:00:01] you be a man of God let fire fall and
[2:00:03] consume you see he said justice that's
[2:00:05] what the prophets are all about if you
[2:00:07] be a man of God let fire consume you
[2:00:09] said justice I don't want that the
[2:00:11] prophet said but before Peter got
[2:00:13] through speaking about those three
[2:00:15] different tabernacles the voice spoke
[2:00:17] out of glory and said, "This is my
[2:00:20] beloved son. Hear ye him." Moses is
[2:00:24] gone. The law is past tense, but the
[2:00:27] prophets are gone, but this this is my
[2:00:30] beloved son. Hear ye him. And his son
[2:00:33] says, "Grace, grace to you this morning.
[2:00:36] Grace to the weary one, grace to the
[2:00:39] adulterer." What happened about that
[2:00:41] woman who was caught in adultery? Oh,
[2:00:44] hallelujah. Hallelujah. Let me just say
[2:00:46] this.
[2:00:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. They brought that woman
[2:00:49] caught in adultery. They dragged her out
[2:00:50] of the house.
[2:00:52] &gt;&gt; Where was the man who was with her
[2:00:53] witted?
[2:00:54] &gt;&gt; Nowhere to be found. They only dragged
[2:00:56] the woman out there to make a show of
[2:00:58] her and brought her before Jesus. Isn't
[2:01:01] that right? She was caught in the act.
[2:01:05] They had video footage.
[2:01:08] They had a written confession. They had
[2:01:11] her pinned down. All the evidence
[2:01:12] pointed to her. The judge only had to
[2:01:15] slam his gavvel and give 5 years or 10
[2:01:17] years or 15 years sentence. She was
[2:01:19] already finished. She was caught in the
[2:01:22] act. She came there snobbering and
[2:01:24] slobbing and crying before the feet of
[2:01:26] Jesus. And these so-called holy men,
[2:01:29] these men of the cloth who supposed to
[2:01:32] be respectable, high and mighty couldn't
[2:01:35] touch him with a 10-ft pole. They had on
[2:01:38] the garments size up to Moses. They knew
[2:01:40] the law according to Moses. They told
[2:01:43] Jesus, "If you call yourself a man of
[2:01:46] God, this woman who is condemned, this
[2:01:49] woman who was caught in the act, this
[2:01:51] woman who is sinful, this woman who
[2:01:54] don't have the chance of a snowball in
[2:01:56] hell, this woman has got to be stoned
[2:01:59] for what she has done, and they brought
[2:02:01] her before Jesus."
[2:02:06] &gt;&gt; What a scene.
[2:02:08] The Bible said they were always trying
[2:02:09] new ways to trap and to tempt Jesus.
[2:02:12] Always trying new ways to catch him off
[2:02:15] his guard, to to count his ministry as
[2:02:18] not to to to see if he really knew what
[2:02:20] he was talking about. Praise God. To to
[2:02:23] discredit him, to discount him, to call
[2:02:26] his move of God heretical. Oh. And
[2:02:29] Jesus, I love it. Jesus didn't say they
[2:02:31] were wrong. Amen.
[2:02:33] &gt;&gt; He didn't say that you can't stone her
[2:02:36] &gt;&gt; because according to the law, she was
[2:02:37] caught.
[2:02:38] &gt;&gt; So Jesus never told them, "Yeah, you
[2:02:40] can't stone a woman. Praise God. Don't
[2:02:42] do it." And so on. No, no, no. He said,
[2:02:44] "Of course. Go ahead and stone her. The
[2:02:47] law says it. The law allows it. The more
[2:02:50] the law can commands it." I don't deny
[2:02:53] that that is true. All of you are
[2:02:55] speaking the truth. She's supposed to be
[2:02:57] stoned. She's supposed to be killed.
[2:03:00] She's supposed to die for her sins. But
[2:03:03] he told them one condition. He just gave
[2:03:05] them one command. He said, "Who is
[2:03:08] without sin, you felt first." Oh, and he
[2:03:12] turned his back to them because he
[2:03:14] didn't want to make them feel bad.
[2:03:17] Because he knew that the word is a
[2:03:20] discerner of the thoughts and intents of
[2:03:23] the heart. And when that word was
[2:03:25] spoken, they all of a sudden were
[2:03:28] standing in front of the mirror of the
[2:03:29] word. Oh, and they confronted with
[2:03:32] themselves. They were confronted with
[2:03:34] their own condition. They were
[2:03:36] confronted with their own sin. Amen,
[2:03:38] brother. Their own lust, their own
[2:03:41] lives. They were supposed to die. Who
[2:03:44] are they to condemn this woman?
[2:03:50] Who are they to condemn this woman? And
[2:03:52] one by one they dropped their stones.
[2:03:55] One by one they gave up their arguments.
[2:03:58] One by one they found a better excuse
[2:04:01] than to continue with this execution
[2:04:03] ceremony. They found a better excuse
[2:04:05] than to come to church on a Sunday
[2:04:07] morning. They found a better excuse than
[2:04:09] to forgive their brother. They found a
[2:04:11] better excuse than to forgive their
[2:04:13] sister. Oh hallelujah. You don't hear me
[2:04:16] this morning. They found a better excuse
[2:04:18] than to give up their hearts and
[2:04:19] grudges. But there's a bride in here
[2:04:21] this morning that knows that she should
[2:04:23] have died. I should have died. I should
[2:04:27] have been killed. But the grace of God
[2:04:36] and when he was finished writing in the
[2:04:38] ground, he turned around and said,
[2:04:40] "Woman, where are thine accusers?" And
[2:04:42] she looked around. She didn't know what
[2:04:45] was happening. All she was doing was
[2:04:46] crying. All she was doing was sign. All
[2:04:49] she was doing was praying and she don't
[2:04:51] die today. But when she looked around,
[2:04:54] she realized that there was nobody but
[2:04:56] Jesus. When she looked around, there was
[2:04:59] nobody but the Lord. And when I looked
[2:05:02] around, after I was crying, after I was
[2:05:05] weeping at the altar, after I was broken
[2:05:07] for my sin, after I was torn up about my
[2:05:11] condition, when I wiped my weary eyes,
[2:05:14] when I wiped my tears and I looked
[2:05:16] around, I saw no one. No one but Jesus.
[2:05:20] No one. No one but him. He died for me.
[2:05:24] He said, "Neither do I condemn you. Go
[2:05:27] and sin no more." And this morning,
[2:05:31] you are no longer condemned. Go and sin
[2:05:35] no more. Hear ye him this morning. It is
[2:05:39] Jesus
[2:05:40] speaking better things on your behalf
[2:05:43] than the blood of bull and goats. than
[2:05:45] the blood of Abel crying from the
[2:05:47] ground. The voice of the blood of Jesus
[2:05:50] Christ is setting you free this morning.
[2:05:54] &gt;&gt; That's how you're going to find your
[2:05:55] place in Christ. That's how you're going
[2:05:57] to come into another Ephesians. That's
[2:05:59] how you're going to come into your
[2:06:00] position by God's grace.
[2:06:04] &gt;&gt; A message of grace will be released
[2:06:08] &gt;&gt; just before the bombs fall.
[2:06:10] &gt;&gt; Oh brother,
[2:06:13] &gt;&gt; let me tell you something. We are
[2:06:15] privileged here in Trinidad Tobago.
[2:06:17] &gt;&gt; We've had so many wonderful things that
[2:06:19] we remembered over the conventions and
[2:06:21] different things. We've had great
[2:06:22] outpourings of the spirit.
[2:06:24] &gt;&gt; Men came from miles around. Ministers
[2:06:26] came to this island. I never knew in a
[2:06:29] million years that that could happen to
[2:06:30] us. We are a blessed people this
[2:06:32] morning. We are blessed to experience
[2:06:34] what we've experienced. But not only
[2:06:36] that, we are blessed to be in a position
[2:06:38] to be a blessing to others. We have been
[2:06:42] a blessing to others all throughout the
[2:06:44] years. I don't know what's going to
[2:06:45] happen tomorrow. I don't know what's
[2:06:46] going to happen in Venezuela in the US.
[2:06:48] But I can tell you something. Whatever
[2:06:50] happens from this service onwards is by
[2:06:53] the grace of almighty God. We are what
[2:06:56] we are by the grace of God. This church
[2:06:59] is here by the grace of God. The
[2:07:02] headstone tabernacle. Think it not
[2:07:04] strange that when the headstone comes,
[2:07:08] shouting cries, grace, grace, grace,
[2:07:11] grace unto it. Oh, it's only by his
[2:07:14] grace. We are in a position to be what
[2:07:17] we are and to do what we do. And I'm so
[2:07:20] grateful for all of you here that have
[2:07:22] put your shoulder to the wheel for this
[2:07:24] that we believe. Oh, we love you and
[2:07:26] appreciate you. I love you and
[2:07:28] appreciate you. I thank God for you. I
[2:07:31] don't know if I'll be alive tomorrow,
[2:07:33] but I thank God for every one of you. I
[2:07:35] thank God for every one of your prayers.
[2:07:37] I thank God for every one of your
[2:07:38] contributions into my life, into my
[2:07:41] family, into the church. I thank God for
[2:07:43] the ministry here. I thank God for the
[2:07:45] deacons. I thank God for the ushers. I
[2:07:48] thank God for the musicians. I thank God
[2:07:50] for the song leaders. I thank God for
[2:07:51] the park in attendance. I thank God for
[2:07:53] those in the kitchen, those downstairs,
[2:07:56] Sunday school, wherever. I thank God for
[2:07:58] all of you this morning. Here we are
[2:08:00] this morning by the grace of God. We
[2:08:03] thank God for where he has brought us
[2:08:06] through. Oh, I'm so happy today to live
[2:08:09] for Jesus Christ.
[2:08:11] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. I'm so glad that he
[2:08:15] called me to be here in this time and
[2:08:17] this spot of ground and this island.
[2:08:21] We're so blessed this morning.
[2:08:23] Don't you forget Lord and all his
[2:08:25] benefits who health all her diseases and
[2:08:28] crowneth thee with loving kindness and
[2:08:31] tender mercies and reneweth your
[2:08:33] strength. Re renew it your youth like
[2:08:35] the eagles. Every time you come into the
[2:08:38] presence of God renews your youth like
[2:08:40] the eagles. Oh, I'm almost finished. My
[2:08:42] time is far gone. Amen. My God. But Luke
[2:08:45] 16:16 says, "The Lord and the prophets
[2:08:47] are unto John. And since that time the
[2:08:49] kingdom of God is preached, and every
[2:08:52] man presseth into it. Amen. Thank you,
[2:08:54] brother Isaac.
[2:08:55] &gt;&gt; Second Peter 1:11, he said, "For so an
[2:08:57] entrance shall be ministered unto you
[2:09:00] abundantly into the everlasting kingdom
[2:09:04] of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ."
[2:09:07] Amen. The prophet said on the Ephesus,
[2:09:08] we find the same thing. The Old
[2:09:10] Testament, he said, I think this book of
[2:09:11] Joshua is a word fitting word for it.
[2:09:13] the old Ephesus of the Old Testament. He
[2:09:15] said we could call it the Ephesus of the
[2:09:17] Old Testament. The book of Ephesus, the
[2:09:19] book of Ephesians of the Old Testament
[2:09:21] would be a good thing to call this book
[2:09:23] of Joshua because it's certainly
[2:09:24] fitting. He said, "And Joshua
[2:09:26] represented grace." He said, "And that,"
[2:09:29] watch this, it couldn't exist in the
[2:09:31] same time that law was in existence.
[2:09:36] &gt;&gt; Neither does any message that forwards
[2:09:38] the people on could ever coincide with a
[2:09:40] past message. Oh, no wonder Moses had to
[2:09:44] leave the scene in order for Joshua the
[2:09:46] Holy Spirit to come on. And no wonder in
[2:09:48] summary Jesus could only lead him as far
[2:09:50] as to Bethany. And he lifted up his hand
[2:09:53] to heaven and said, "Wait and tar in
[2:09:55] Jerusalem, but I will not leave you
[2:09:57] comfortless. I'll come to you, but I've
[2:09:59] got to change my form. I'm finished in
[2:10:02] this part of my ministry, but I'm coming
[2:10:04] back to you. Not a son of man anymore,
[2:10:07] but a son of God's spirit to come onto
[2:10:10] you and birth you and give you the
[2:10:12] baptism of the Holy Ghost to start that
[2:10:15] holy church. Oh, and there's got to come
[2:10:18] today another Ephesians to this. We've
[2:10:22] come out of the world. We've walked onto
[2:10:24] the prophet's message. Oh, hallelu. We
[2:10:26] try to live holy. We try to let our hair
[2:10:29] go down and go wear all the dresses long
[2:10:31] and not wear makeup and not wear
[2:10:33] earrings. But it takes the spirit of God
[2:10:36] for you to really live this word. It
[2:10:39] takes the spirit of God. It takes the
[2:10:42] baptism of the Holy Ghost. It takes the
[2:10:45] anointing to really strike your soul. In
[2:10:48] order for you to really be a Christian,
[2:10:51] in order for you to really live this
[2:10:53] message, in order for you to come become
[2:10:55] this message, it takes a glorious
[2:10:58] wonderful baptism of the Holy Ghost and
[2:11:01] fire. Oh, do you hear me this morning?
[2:11:05] And it's a message of grace that
[2:11:08] releases that spirit this morning to
[2:11:10] allow you the privilege to be called the
[2:11:13] sons of God. For you to find your place,
[2:11:15] for you to enter through the veil. Isn't
[2:11:17] that right?
[2:11:18] &gt;&gt; Where the glories never fail. Oh my. It
[2:11:20] was death to go beyond to go into the
[2:11:22] presence of God. But the blood made a
[2:11:24] way for us to go in. The blood made a
[2:11:26] way for us to enter there. The Bible
[2:11:28] said the veil of the of the temple was
[2:11:30] rent into. Praise God. And now we have
[2:11:33] access through his blood to access what
[2:11:36] we know is our own to access our portion
[2:11:38] of the Holy Ghost. to access our portion
[2:11:41] of our inheritance, to access our
[2:11:43] adoption, to access our perfection, to
[2:11:46] access what God has for us this morning.
[2:11:50] Many, many men. So, it can't live can't
[2:11:52] coincide. Isn't that right? Isn't that
[2:11:53] right? And verse 1 Corinthians 13 said,
[2:11:56] "We know in part and we prophesy in
[2:11:57] part, but when that which is perfect is
[2:12:00] come, then that which is in part will be
[2:12:02] done away with." When I was a child, I
[2:12:05] spake as a child. Isn't that right? I
[2:12:07] understood as a child and thought as a
[2:12:09] child, but when I become a man, I put
[2:12:12] away childish things. And so there was
[2:12:15] Joshua representing grace right along
[2:12:17] with the law, but it could not be
[2:12:19] enforced as long as the law was in its
[2:12:22] proper place. And here we come to the
[2:12:24] finishing now. He said, "And so has the
[2:12:26] church in this last day." He said, "It's
[2:12:28] come along. It's played its part, but
[2:12:32] there is coming a time where it must
[2:12:34] cease. It must do it." He said, "Because
[2:12:37] there's got to be an Ephesians also of
[2:12:40] this journey. Just as there were in
[2:12:42] other journeys, there has to come an
[2:12:44] Ephesians, an Ephesus, an Ephesians of
[2:12:48] this journey." Oh, hallelujah. Isn't
[2:12:50] that right? Praise God. Amen. He said,
[2:12:52] "Wherein the Lord could never save a
[2:12:54] sinner, as I've pointed out, it could
[2:12:56] not." He said, "Therefore, the promised
[2:12:57] land represented a day of grace." Oh,
[2:13:01] the promised land, your promises, your
[2:13:04] Holy Ghost, your baptism, your healing,
[2:13:06] your deliverance. When that time comes,
[2:13:09] it will be a day of grace. The prophet
[2:13:11] said, "Oh, see, he couldn't take him
[2:13:13] into that journey." Isn't that right?
[2:13:16] Hallelujah. I'm winding up here now. I
[2:13:18] said, "But we promise according to
[2:13:19] Revelation 10 and so forth, Malachi 4
[2:13:21] and St. Luke 22:17 and so forth that
[2:13:24] there's going to come an Ephesians to
[2:13:26] this." There is promise it friends.
[2:13:29] There must come an Ephesians that these
[2:13:31] sevenfold mysteries of the word of God
[2:13:34] must be unfolded and it is in the
[2:13:37] loudesian age that this takes place and
[2:13:40] the prophet said I believe that we are
[2:13:42] there he said I believe we're right in
[2:13:45] the shadows of the coming of the son of
[2:13:47] God and as Joshua just before the
[2:13:50] Ephesians raised up and so the John the
[2:13:53] Baptist raised up just before the next
[2:13:54] Ephesians he said we're promised another
[2:13:57] Ephesians is predicted here in scripture
[2:14:00] and he said, "Therefore, I think that we
[2:14:02] are living in the Ephesians again." Oh,
[2:14:05] back again. We're promised that what was
[2:14:08] left off during those seven church ages
[2:14:10] would be restored. Isn't that right? He
[2:14:12] said, "So therefore, we know that Luther
[2:14:14] couldn't get to it. Wesley and so forth,
[2:14:16] the reformers, Nox and Finny and Calvin
[2:14:19] and so forth, they couldn't get to it
[2:14:21] all, but they had what they had was the
[2:14:23] gospel truth." But he said, "Now in the
[2:14:26] last days, we are given the
[2:14:27] understanding by the word that we are
[2:14:29] going to understand it because there's
[2:14:32] going to come another Ephesians to
[2:14:35] this." And we are here this morning. Oh,
[2:14:39] do you believe it this morning? Amen.
[2:14:41] Praise God. Musician, get ready to come.
[2:14:43] I'm almost winding up. He said, "So what
[2:14:45] happened in that Ephesians age?" Look at
[2:14:46] Joshua now. What happened? He said,
[2:14:48] "Look, after the death of Moses, the
[2:14:50] servant of the Lord, it came to pass
[2:14:52] that the Lord spake unto Joshua the son
[2:14:54] of Nun, Moses, minister, saying, Moses,
[2:14:57] my servant, is dead. Now therefore,
[2:14:59] arise, go over this Jordan, thou and all
[2:15:03] this people unto the land which I do
[2:15:06] give them, even to the children of
[2:15:08] Israel. And every place that the soul of
[2:15:12] your foot shall tread upon, that have I
[2:15:14] given unto you." Every place that you
[2:15:18] put your foot upon belongs to you this
[2:15:20] morning. It's not good enough to just
[2:15:22] talk about it. You've got to put your
[2:15:24] foot upon what you claim to be on. If
[2:15:28] you need healing this morning, put your
[2:15:30] foot on it. If you need deliverance, put
[2:15:32] your foot. If you need heal and
[2:15:34] breakthrough, put your foot. If you want
[2:15:37] the Holy Ghost this morning, don't you
[2:15:39] be afraid. Get up this morning. Get up
[2:15:42] and move and put your foot upon what you
[2:15:46] know is your own. Oh,
[2:15:49] from the wilderness and this Lebanon,
[2:15:52] even unto the great river, the river
[2:15:54] Euphrates, the land of the Hittites,
[2:15:57] unto the great sea, unto the going down
[2:15:59] shall be your coast. And there shall not
[2:16:03] many man be able to stand before thee
[2:16:06] all the days of my life. And as I was
[2:16:09] with Moses, so shall I be with thee. I
[2:16:12] will not fail thee, nor forsake thee.
[2:16:15] And as he was with Malachi 4, so shall
[2:16:18] he be with Ephesians 4, so shall he be
[2:16:20] with this bride on the earth. This bride
[2:16:23] and Trinidad, she will not be like Eve,
[2:16:26] but she will put out the devil. Oh, we
[2:16:30] shall surely die. Oh, if we partake of
[2:16:32] the tree of good and evil, kick the
[2:16:34] devil out this morning and partake of
[2:16:36] that tree of life. You were called, you
[2:16:39] were predestinated to partake of the
[2:16:41] tree of life. God's restoring you back
[2:16:44] this morning, back to Eden, back to
[2:16:47] another Adam condition where sons of God
[2:16:50] could rise up in the newness of life and
[2:16:53] take their place. Some apostles, some
[2:16:56] prophets, some evangelists, some
[2:16:58] pastors, some teachers. Oh, another
[2:17:01] Ephesians. Oh, we are promises. We are
[2:17:05] promises. Oh, hallelujah. Joshua 3:7.
[2:17:09] Amen. Let's go out with a shout. Do you
[2:17:10] believe it? And the Lord said unto
[2:17:12] Joshua, "This day will I begin to
[2:17:15] magnify thee in the sight of all Israel,
[2:17:19] that they might know that as I was with
[2:17:21] Moses, so shall I be with thee." There's
[2:17:24] coming a day this morning that the Holy
[2:17:26] Ghost, Joshua, the Holy Spirit is going
[2:17:29] to be so magnified before the people
[2:17:32] that our confidence is going to build in
[2:17:35] God's ability to deliver us, to heal the
[2:17:38] sick among us, to raise the dead among
[2:17:40] us to cast out the dead. Hallelujah.
[2:17:43] Devils among us. Healing is going to
[2:17:45] become normal. Deliverance is going to
[2:17:47] become normal. Freedom is going to
[2:17:50] become normal. It's going to become
[2:17:52] normal to be happy. Normal to be jumping
[2:17:54] and shouting in service. Normal to be
[2:17:57] screaming. Normal to receive a refilling
[2:18:00] of the Holy Ghost. It'll be normal to
[2:18:03] see a backslider walking there weeping
[2:18:06] and crying with the shorts and
[2:18:07] everything else. But God is saving the
[2:18:10] heart, the fire of God falling upon the
[2:18:12] people. Oh, another ananas, another
[2:18:15] Sapphire, and a few of them. And the
[2:18:18] church will come into its mighty power.
[2:18:21] Oh, you going to get the place on this
[2:18:22] softly. Amen. Oh hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:18:26] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Oh glory glory.
[2:18:29] Glory. Glory. Glory.
[2:18:31] &gt;&gt; Prophet said what caused this change? He
[2:18:33] said you see what caused it from one
[2:18:35] time we are dead but to being quickened.
[2:18:38] He said quicken means to be made alive.
[2:18:40] He said there was a change from death
[2:18:43] unto life. He said there's no other
[2:18:45] there's no other thing that could happen
[2:18:46] to any person so great as to change from
[2:18:49] death to life. A man if he was dying
[2:18:52] physically and could be healed
[2:18:53] physically would be a great thing. He
[2:18:55] said but there's nothing so great as
[2:18:57] when he's spiritually dead and God has
[2:18:59] quickened him to life. Oh, are you being
[2:19:02] quickened this morning? He said you once
[2:19:04] in times past dead. You were dead. Even
[2:19:07] many of you here tonight one time can
[2:19:08] look back and know that you were dead.
[2:19:10] But now aren't you why aren't you dead
[2:19:12] tonight as you were then? You deserve to
[2:19:14] be that way. But because you was a
[2:19:15] sinner. But God who was rich in mercy,
[2:19:19] he said, he said, that's the thing. He
[2:19:21] said, God who was rich all that we these
[2:19:25] things that we were, he said, but God
[2:19:27] that made the change right there. But
[2:19:30] God for our situation. You stand for the
[2:19:32] can come. But God for your condition.
[2:19:35] But God for your situation. That made a
[2:19:38] change right there. Oh, that God who is
[2:19:40] rich in mercy. The prophet said, "I'm so
[2:19:43] glad for that. that he is rich in mercy.
[2:19:46] Oh, if he was just rich in money, if he
[2:19:49] was just rich in materials, that would
[2:19:51] be wonderful. But the greatest thing is
[2:19:54] that he is rich in mercy this morning.
[2:19:57] Oh, what a great word that is. We that
[2:20:00] were once dead are now quickened to life
[2:20:04] by the grace of almighty God. May the
[2:20:07] Lord bless you this morning. There's got
[2:20:09] to be another Ephesians to this. Oh,
[2:20:12] another release of his power, release of
[2:20:15] his presence, and it comes by the grace
[2:20:18] of almighty God. We have received a
[2:20:20] message of grace in the end time. Let's
[2:20:22] all stand and begin to worship him. Lift
[2:20:24] your hands right where you are and just
[2:20:26] begin to praise him. Just begin to thank
[2:20:28] him for his grace this morning. Oh, his
[2:20:31] grace, oh, that saves us, that redeems
[2:20:34] us, that made a way for us. Oh, when we
[2:20:37] were down in darkness, when we could no
[2:20:39] longer be saved, uh, it's his grace that
[2:20:41] made a way. Uh, it's his grace that
[2:20:43] opened the door. It's his grace. Uh, oh,
[2:20:46] hallelujah. We are what we are. Somebody
[2:20:48] lift your hands. Somebody worship him
[2:20:50] this morning. Somebody testify this
[2:20:52] morning. It's only the grace of almighty
[2:20:55] God that I'm standing here this morning.
[2:20:57] Close your eyes, lift your hands, and
[2:21:00] begin to worship him. Just begin to
[2:21:02] thank him. Just begin to give him
[2:21:03] praise. Hallelujah. Oh, glory.
[2:21:06] Hallelujah. Oh, hallelujah. Oh,
[2:21:14] hallelujah. Oh, it's his praise.
[2:21:16] Hallelujah. Oh, it's his praise. Oh,
[2:21:22] God.
[2:21:24] Lift your hands and worship him right
[2:21:26] now. Give him praise right now.
[2:21:28] &gt;&gt; Oh, give him glory right now. Give him
[2:21:31] honor right now. Oh, get him. Tell him
[2:21:33] how much you love him. Tell him how much
[2:21:35] you need him. Lift your hands and just
[2:21:37] worship him right now. Oh father, I need
[2:21:39] your grace. I need your mercy. I thank
[2:21:42] you for your forgiveness. I thank you
[2:21:44] for your loving kindness. I thank you
[2:21:45] for your tender mercies. Your mercies
[2:21:48] are new every morning. Oh, I love you

[2:30:36] Blessed be the name
[2:30:38] of the Lord. Are you happy to be in the
[2:30:40] house of the Lord this morning?
[2:30:44] Amen. You appreciate God's servant,
[2:30:46] Brother Anthony, and the message this
[2:30:48] morning. What a inspiration. What a
[2:30:51] burden. What an anointing. What an
[2:30:53] atmosphere.
[2:30:54] [Applause]
[2:30:56] Amen. So, we do have some prayer
[2:30:58] requests at this time. So, good to play
[2:31:01] some things hopefully
[2:31:03] uh from mother Terren and sister
[2:31:06] Jennifer Oid who are requesting prayer.
[2:31:08] They are down with the virus. We also
[2:31:11] want to remember all of the different
[2:31:13] types of cases and situations that we
[2:31:16] have in the church.
[2:31:18] I heard brother Hugh Williams was in
[2:31:20] some pain as well and it's very rare to
[2:31:23] not see him in the house of the Lord. So
[2:31:25] you know when you don't see him it's
[2:31:27] it's a bit of pressure there. So we want
[2:31:29] to come together as a church and if
[2:31:31] there's a request this morning you want
[2:31:33] to show by raising your hands as we
[2:31:34] approach the throne of grace this
[2:31:36] morning knowing that the price has
[2:31:38] already been paid and the healing has
[2:31:41] already paid for. Oh, we just want to
[2:31:43] tap in by faith to access what has
[2:31:45] already been done. By his stripes, we
[2:31:48] were healed. It's already a finished
[2:31:49] work. And if it may not, it may not be
[2:31:52] just for physical healing, but whatever
[2:31:54] situation you're going through right
[2:31:55] now, he is able to move into your
[2:31:58] situation. Move into your home, move
[2:32:00] into your job, move into whatever
[2:32:03] conflict, challenge, problem, whatever
[2:32:05] might be bothering you. He's interested
[2:32:08] in the smallest aspect of our lives so
[2:32:11] that he could have the full preeminence.
[2:32:12] So let us bow our heads for a word of
[2:32:14] prayer.
[2:32:15] Oh heavenly father, Lord, we thank you
[2:32:17] for the atmosphere and for the presence
[2:32:20] and the anointing that was all over the
[2:32:23] tabernacle this morning from the first
[2:32:25] note that was played to the song service
[2:32:28] that created an atmosphere to your
[2:32:31] servant and your son, brother Anthony,
[2:32:32] who stood behind the sacred desk with a
[2:32:34] burden. Lord, to see a present tense
[2:32:37] reality and a manifestation of the
[2:32:39] living God of the taking the promises
[2:32:42] that the prophet presented to us and
[2:32:44] making it alive. Father, you said that's
[2:32:46] how you raise a standard by taking the
[2:32:48] same word and making it more positive,
[2:32:50] more tangible, more real to us. So,
[2:32:53] Father God, we thank you for the
[2:32:55] foundation that has been laid that has
[2:32:57] placed faith in our souls that we could
[2:32:59] come boldly to the throne of grace to
[2:33:01] ask whatever we need, Father. And Lord,
[2:33:03] we bring with the Terren Lord and Sister
[2:33:05] Jennifer to you this morning, Lord, how
[2:33:07] the virus has been moving around. But
[2:33:09] Father, we speak a word of healing over
[2:33:11] their home even now that they would both
[2:33:14] be healed from the crown of their heads
[2:33:15] to the souls of their feet even now. May
[2:33:18] the angel of the Lord may healing rain
[2:33:20] pour down in that home, Father. Lord,
[2:33:23] may the impact be so great that even the
[2:33:25] neighbors will feel the power of the
[2:33:27] angel of the Lord that has passed by
[2:33:29] their way this morning, Father. Oh God,
[2:33:31] we pray for Lord our head deacon,
[2:33:33] brother Hugh Williams. Father, Lord,
[2:33:36] he's not in the house today, Father. And
[2:33:38] we pray dear, God, that the angel of the
[2:33:39] Lord will meet him right where he is
[2:33:41] right now, Lord. And may he perform
[2:33:43] surgery. Perform surgery today, may you
[2:33:46] touch your son even now from the crown
[2:33:48] of his heads to the sole of his feet.
[2:33:51] Lord, may this request come back as a
[2:33:53] note of praise that from that very hour,
[2:33:56] Father, Lord, when the centurion stood,
[2:33:58] he say, what time was he healed? Not not
[2:34:00] if he was healed, but what time may it
[2:34:03] be from this very hour there's a
[2:34:04] difference. There's a change. There's a
[2:34:06] rustle in the malberry tree that the
[2:34:08] still small voice pierce through
[2:34:11] distance and time and minister to him,
[2:34:14] his wife, his family, Lord. And every
[2:34:16] hand that was raised in the sanctuary,
[2:34:18] every hand that was raised downstairs,
[2:34:20] every hand that was raised, those that
[2:34:21] are connected online, may the angel of
[2:34:23] the Lord who knows all the requests and
[2:34:26] all the prayer and all the cries and all
[2:34:28] the needs of your people, Father, may
[2:34:30] you minister to your sons and your
[2:34:32] daughters, may you strengthen your
[2:34:33] servant, Brother Anthony. Father, Lord,
[2:34:35] for standing here and Lord, virtue would
[2:34:38] have been poured out. May you restore it
[2:34:40] 100fold. May you touch his wife, Father.
[2:34:42] May healing rain move into that home
[2:34:44] right now. May you touch the family in
[2:34:47] the mighty name of Jesus Christ. Father,
[2:34:50] we pray for our pastor who is traveling
[2:34:52] to India. Lord, may the angel of the
[2:34:54] Lord strengthen your servant, Lord, as
[2:34:56] he goes to minister the word of God this
[2:34:58] week in India. May the angel of the Lord
[2:35:00] go before him. May the power of God go
[2:35:02] with him, Lord. May Holy Spirit spoken
[2:35:05] words be uttered, Father. May you grant
[2:35:07] them safe journeys to and from. Lord, we
[2:35:10] commit him into your hands, Lord. his
[2:35:12] wife, the family, the ministry here. We
[2:35:14] commit the church into your hands today,
[2:35:16] Father. Lord, those that are here, those
[2:35:18] that are connected online, may you be
[2:35:20] with each one in the mighty precious
[2:35:21] name of Jesus Christ. We commit your
[2:35:24] people into your hands. May you grant
[2:35:25] traveling mercies and bring us back at
[2:35:27] the appointed time in the precious name
[2:35:30] of Jesus Christ. And the church says,
[2:35:33] &gt;&gt; and the church says, amen and amen. You
[2:35:36] may be seated for a few announcements.

[2:35:58] know Enoch very well. His our fathers I
[2:36:01] might say were there the very beginning
[2:36:03] of the message. So they go way back I
