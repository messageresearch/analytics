praise the lord for his grace and mercy we are all now recovered and cleared from the coronavirus we'd also like to request prayer for sister nicholas who is in a great deal of physical pain and in

we thank you for life we thank you for strength we thank you for opening our understanding to your word and to this message this message of the hour this message that keeps us alive this messenger gives us hope and shows us a possibility a possibility of a way the same way samson saw a possibility we see a possibility it's a single possibility that you have made for us through your provided way lord and we come as a people with so many different needs lord and each one having their own situation to deal with lord and we recognize that we are one body we are one family and when one member is

to take care of it so father may you bless your people may you strengthen each one here tonight lord for this bible study may you bless your church may you bless your people lord may you strengthen our fates may you encourage someone lord if there's one word to be said to one person tonight lord may lord this service be worth it so may you be with your people we commit the teaching into your hands may you take me out of the way may you speak through me lord bring my thoughts and ideas on the subjection to your holy spirit may only what you once said be said may only what you want done be done we commit the service into your hands in the precious name of jesus christ and the church says amen and amen and amen and we thank god for his grace tonight as we would have announced this is the last uh bible study before our virtual convention which is coming up in just over two weeks just as a reminder to the church july 8th 9th 10th and 11th uh will be our annual virtual july convention uh there'll be two services on each of those days 8 9 10 um 8 9 10 11 of july so be under great expectation be in prayer be in faith be in preparation you only get out of anything what you expect and what you put into it so i don't want you to take it for granted uh so we are still in the preparation mode and uh we thank god for his grace and his love and his mercy to allow us to have another virtual convention um this year um we are still in in new territory we we have not been this way before and each time we venture into this uh we realize that that it's a spiritual warfare and we have a spiritual responsibility we have spiritual battles and we have promised a spiritual victory and we know that what we see in the physical and in a natural exist only because there's a spiritual world what we see what we touch what we interact with you know are here because of what we cannot see so we want to be conscious in all our doings in all of our actions that we are creatures of eternity trapped in time and we have a responsibility to fulfill our higher calling so it is never a strain or stress on us to report for duty to be reminded of who we are and what we are called to do in such a time as this so i encourage you tonight uh by the grace of god i don't intend to be too long with you um this is supposed to be uh sort of a close-off class as it were um we'll have a two-week sabbatical two-week pause uh the 29th and the sixth and after the convention we will resume our classes so and um there's no written exam um i i i don't know if we'll have a written exam ever but there's a more important exam and the exam is an exam of our character you know and the exam is the exam of the token you know and i'm not qualified to administer that exam that exam is administered by the holy spirit himself at the end of the day all of our efforts all of our activities and our motives and objectives is to serve him to please him the lord and to ensure that we could be counted worthy of taking this word that has been given to us and putting it into action it is about that life you know but it speaks about that equation that at the end of the day the equal sign is not mystery the equal sign is not moving the mountain the equal sign is our life and our character being changed and being transformed you know so by the grace of god tonight um i would like um to just talk to you a little bit um i do have a little kind of thought but i love these sessions because you know we have to just lean on the lord to give us the right words to say the right things to help somebody to break past their limitations we place limitations on ourselves you know it's one thing for somebody to limit you and say you cannot do something or you cannot achieve something or you cannot have something but the most dangerous place to be is when you limit yourself and by your own thinking by your own actions by your own self-limiting beliefs you hinder your own progress and what we want to do is understand that as we get deeper in the word god wants us to become so light you know but i'm preaching about breaking past his sound barrier you know and he talks about when you come into contact with that song barrier there's there's some vibrations there's there's some resistance that you meet once you break past that sound barrier you begin to fly a different kind of fly you begin to worship a different kind of worship you know and um you know i really appreciate the the services that i've been going for and one thing i appreciate you know a lot of people may not understand how we operate and why we operate the way we do you know but when you look at how the profit operated the profit as much as you would teach the message you know he really you know brought a lot of focus on the right atmosphere you know the atmosphere is what is what bring the results you know and i was you know as i was watching you know so many of the services and i trust that as you experience the services a second time you know and in some cases maybe a third time you know and in some cases it might be like like like you say go look seven times because there was a service or two that i heard recently and i told by the way um i feel like i never heard those things before and i knew i was in the service you know um the the almost like i said the scarier one for me is when you know we played a message that i preach and i was like i can't remember preaching the message so i say that is that is when you know it's not no plan the thought as such but the reality is it is not just what is being said but the atmosphere and the anointing and the worship you know yes we could go and and and put a table and a microphone and speak you know and and that has its place but you cannot just replicate the anointing and and inspiration when the church comes together you know and i'm sitting there sometimes watching these services and i don't know what your experience is like but i miss being able to be in the house of god and and and run and shout and and jump and and get that what happens like in a day of pentecost when it was they were all they were all in the in the in the upper room and they were praising and they were worshiping and they were they were on fire and that kind of stuff so i trust that in your homes you are also feeding over that atmosphere and that you are not having the service as a as a as a multi-tasking event you know we have we have we have we we are in a society in a world now where people like to multitask you know they like to do two things at the same time treating at the same time so so so we're doing something and listening to a table or doing this or either i want to encourage you to to give god his due give god his respect put god first you know now we are being challenged more than ever as individuals to be priests in our own homes we are being challenged more than ever to take up the mantle of responsibility as christians when nobody is watching so i want to challenge you going forward even in this bible study here don't let this be a casual experience for you but if you put effort into it you're gonna get more out of it you know you're watching a tape do this as your as part of your worship part of your sacrifice part of your effort because the value you place into anything is what you get out of it so i want to encourage you tonight with that um so by the grace of god tonight um i want to continue a little bit from last week i was very cautious last week to call it a part one to venture into a part two um you know i have gotten in trouble quite a few times um announcing a part one and then the part two has not arrived um a sister actually wrote and asked about part two and three of daniel and basically said she don't know if it's an oversight that we didn't upload it um you know but i didn't get to really respond yet to say we never did it you know but god knows the burden in in my heart you know to dig and find these things to encourage a church but i do have to move as the lord leads and um you know sometimes situations come and the lord just show you something else and you want to go somewhere else and you know so by the grace of god tonight i i do want to take uh the same theme from last week and call it lost pain and betrayal part two and continue on the study of job because there are few things in there that i want to look at that we didn't get to touch a bit and maybe revisit some things but also look at a few things from a different perspective to make sure we capture it because like we said last week there are 42 chapters in job that's a lot that's a lot i don't know if any of the advanced students were able to spend some time between last week and this week reading job and going through the various chapters um so for those of you who are in the advanced class certainly i appreciate that and for those of you who are aspiring to be in the advanced class we will spend a little time tonight kind of digging a little deep in a few things to kind of cut some some elements in here you know so i don't want to revisit a lot of what we did last week i encourage you if you want to get the first class it is there on the youtube channel so i want to kind of pick up a few things and move by degrees of god tonight so last week we we we identified um from the book of job looking at job one uh there was a man in the land of us whose name was job and that man was perfect and upright powerful powerful powerful words it is it is only when you look at the entire book you could realize that one in chapter one the author who is god is speaking so this is not job speaking about himself in chapter one verse one this is not him describing himself this is not him speaking about himself this is god expressing something about this man job and god calls him perfect and upright one that feared god and stewed evil but by the time we get to job 42 we see a repentant job we see a job who is apologizing we see a job who is making things right we see a change job so i want to make a distinction now you know from top level as you see in business from a 50 000 foot view going way above the book you look at chapter one verse one we have god's thoughts on this man that he is perfect he is upright that's a testimony a powerful testimony this is not the church saying he is upright this is not his neighbors his friends his family this is god speaking about him on a top level perspective but but but by chapter 42 we see it as if god has raised the bar on job without telling him the bow was raised and what does it catch that it is as if what was perfect and upright in chapter one is being reviewed by chapter 42. i don't know if you've seen that so god is speaking and speaking about a man or for somebody to describe you like this and more so for god to describe you like this yet still by the time we read chapter 42 which we touched on last week we have a repentant job and if i could say it a changed job so automatically we see a progression in god that is really something else it shows then that no matter where you are walking because perfect and upright this was not a wicked man this was not a man who is actively pursuing sin this is not a man who is actively doing evil this is a man who has a testimony and god is requiring more from him and that there is is what i want us to catch on our first level god is requiring more from him at the end of the day if there is one major teaching we can take from this is this book is about call it an approximation to god because job out of all of the books is really a book of of speaking about perfection because it starts off speaking about a man who is perfect and upright and by job 42 he is he is even more perfect he is even more upright it is not the same man in job 42 as iman in job 41 and by every description the man in job 1-1 we have a lot of work to do to be that kind of a man isn't that something else most of us may struggle to have the kind of testimony like the job one one man far less to be able to stand up to the scrutiny to be qualified as the job 42 man the man who would have vindicated himself through many chapters in the book of job and yet still come to a crucial truth about the issues that he still had in his life which were not issues available to the public this was not the issue of lust and desire in his heart or greed or envy or jealousy this was not that can the church say man someone to challenge us now because one of the dangers of people coming to know the lord and coming to church is a level of comfort a level of feeling you have arrived and if it's anything that the book of job teaches us is there's no such thing as having arrived because there's so much to god and if there's one thing we learn in the book of job is god speaking a job saying how much job still was yet to know still was yet to understand still was yet to appreciate and that's why we can reference in scripture deuteronomy 29 29 the secret things belong on to god but those things which are revealed belonging to us and the reality as you look through the prophet's message and you look from genesis to revelation the bible is a book of progressive revelation it unfolds it unfolds it unfolds and as it unfolds you have to grow with what is unfolding is that helping anybody tonight so this gospel can never become boring this journey can never become boring because you could never cover the whole subject matter oh you don't hear me tonight oh i don't know if you i don't know if you're with me you know it is not as we have a set curriculum and will have finished the curriculum in the past it is not that because who in this room can know all of god oh my you don't hear me tonight when you read job it is one thing about about job is when job in the book and we see it referencing wisdom and how god is and what god so when god asks job the question in job 38 where was thou who measure it and all these things questions that job could have never answered in its entirety shows how much of god that we have to still know and discover anybody with me wonderful wonderful wonderful so i want to encourage us tonight that life is a life of pressing it's a life of overcoming it's a life of adding it's a life of increase so when i read job it becomes almost impossible for somebody to tell me they already know how they feel about the lord right now and these kind of things because that kind of suggests that you have exhausted all you can experience in god anybody with me so if you appreciate tonight that there's more of god that you have not tasted there's more blessings that you have not experienced there are more gifts that have to come that have not been accessed yet then it puts you on the expectation could it be that this is the kind of expectation they had in the upper room because they were expecting something they couldn't describe they were expecting something that didn't happen before but they were under expectation for something can the church say man all right so let's kind of get into the teaching i don't want to be too long with you so in looking at this you know the bible says with all thy getting get understanding i'm gonna be having a conversation we're not preaching we're just sharing we having a fireside chat um i wish you could kind of respond and but but it's too many people here tonight for us all to all speak so but i want us to have a conversation tonight you know and in preparing this i was writing down some questions you know and some kind of team some topics looking at this so i wrote down the conversations of job it's one of the phrases there are the conversations because a lot of the book of job is conversations i wrote another line the responses of job so this is me by the grace of god looking through the scripture so i want to kind of understand these conversations of job the responses of job ask the question can you speak like job because there were many things that job said that when i look at it i asked myself can i speak like job in other words job was defending himself and some of us cannot defend ourselves the way job defended himself i don't know if i'll get into all of it tonight but job was confident enough to defend certain things about his testimony anybody with me there were certain defenses that job could have made about his testimony that blows me away job was confident about certain things with the way he lived and we're going to touch it a little bit and then as i went oh and i said lessons from the life of joe and then i cannot end up on the seven conversations of job so ride with me a little bit the seven conversations of job so we established in last week's class that we had like four modules in the book of job there was chapter one there was where his wealth was attacked his family was attacked that was module one in chapter one in chapter two his health was a ch was was attacked then from chapter three to 37 there was this interaction with his friends so to speak and then from 38 god got into the picture but now i want to look a little deeper than that and speak about call it the seven conversations of job to identify that job kind of had seven kinds of different types of conversations going on through these 42 chapters the first conversation that job had is kind of with himself and we're going to talk about that a little bit so there's the conversation joe will have with himself there's a conversation job had with his wife that's true there's a conversation that job had with his three friends you remember those three friends all right so the conversation you would have had with eliphaz bilder and zofa then the conversation with elohu and then the conversation with the lord so these are the seven types of conversations that job would have had looking at job one versus looking at job chapter one we see a situation as we did last week that job in chapter one is when he lost his house his family his wealth his animals all like that kind of stuff and by the end of job one job isn't really talking to anybody but job is sort of having a quality conversation with himself because it's not directed at a specific person this is when job arose and rent his mantle and shaved his head this is the end of job one and fell on upon the grunge and worshiped and said naked came i out of my mother's womb and naked shall i return to the lord gave and the lord had taken away blessed be the name of the lord and in all this job sinned not not charged foolishly so this is not directed at anybody this is the bible said worship this is almost like prayer it's almost like a conversation this is job sharing his heart this is him expressing how he felt in the middle of this suffering in the middle of your loss in the middle of the pain this is job all of us have to have the right type of conversation with ourselves we're going to touch it out a bit here and there i want to kind of move on a little bit to job 2. in job 2 we see a different conversation now bear in mind in job 1 god is not speaking to job the conversations in job 1 and job 2 is above job's realm job is not aware of these conversations with god and the devil and these things neither in chapter 2 but in job chapter 2 we see the second main conversation this is the community with his wife we don't know a lot about job's wife but we do know a few things what do we know we know one that joe being an upright man being a perfect man being a man who lives a certain kind of life his wife would be a reflection of him so the way job live would have an impact on his relationship his testimony would have an impact on his wife everybody with me so it's not as his wife would be foreign to how he operated so we know that job and his wife we know for sure that she struggled under pressure because while job didn't feel like giving up we have his wife suggesting that he curse god and die and we read it last week job made very clear that when he said his wife speak like a foolish woman he said you speak as one who spiritually foolish ignorant and oblivious of god's will so at this point in time we have a conversation with job and his wife and at that point in time it is not as if job is falling apart it is not as if i guess the reality of it hits him of what is going on and we sort of end that conversation there and then we go just after that we have a situation now where all of the friends come to visit job and job is silent the bible said for how long remember for seven days and seven nights no one spoke a word and job is there alone with his thoughts saying nothing there's no there's no external conversation recorded but i don't know who could sit down for seven days and not have thoughts in their minds because here it was job is trying to figure out what is going on and the bible said his friend said nothing because they're respecting his solitude the quietness and the bible said most of all he saw that his speed was very great so job having his internal conversation because his internal conversation became his external conversation as reflected through the scriptures so we identified as well that from job chapter 3 when joe begins to speak and begins to express himself that it became a dialogue between job and his friends and it's one would speak and job would respond and it would sort of go like that and if he were to analyze it eliphaz would speak three times and job would respond three times bill dad would speak three times and job would respond to bilal three times zofa would speak twice as you begin to look at how it unfolds you will realize that the arguments of these brothers start off large and begin to get smaller so for example this is some top level teacher approach right so eliphaz his whole argument against job was the whole of chapter four and the whole of chapter five two entire chapters is eliphaz trying to speak to job and as eliphaz speaks he's increasing in his severity trying to reconcile job to god now i want to identify here that these three friends they share certain beliefs they share certain values they shared certain elements of doctrine job because of the nature of the man wouldn't be hanging around people who he didn't share some value with i want us to catch that for a minute so it is not on believers that job was hanging around with so we taught we touched this last week but it's not as if job was hanging around with people who ain't no god and who doing any word every single one of these people had the word to their understanding doctrine to their understanding belief to their understanding and they were using their understanding and their knowledge of the word in what would have been a very well intentioned attempt to help job there is nothing suggesting in scripture that these brothers have malicious intent i want us to catch that although when you understand what happened in chapter 42 where god rebuked them and god sent them to big sacrifice and one get prayed for it doesn't speak to the fact or suggest that these brothers had ill intent they were not trying to hurt job they were trying to help job so it teaches us a real powerful lesson somebody could have every intention of trying to help you and really hurt you big teaching so it allows us to re-evaluate this is not a matter of them not being job's friends there was a lot in common job wasn't hanging wrong with the village the village bajon this was people who he was comfortable with to call friends who shared certain beliefs but however they didn't have all of the pieces to really help you why because it did not understand what was happening so it challenges us because god in dealing with them and in speaking the job question how can you speak on these matters without having the right knowledge so automatically we are being challenged to where how we address situations when you don't have the right knowledge because that's a direct statement that god would make who darkened counsel with a lack of knowledge so the reason all of this is in scripture is for us to grow in knowledge in understanding and to see examples because god could have had this story of job a very simple story you know job had he lost he suffered and he was restored but it's not that simple i want us to catch through these scriptures it's not that simple god could have had it that it was one friend came and talked to him but god had three different individuals interact with job all trying i want you to catch this to help job anybody with me all right so we're billing a little bit they share beliefs they share values they share the elements of doctrine they demonstrated their friendship by their effort their time and what they saw as they attempt to help job eliphaz would try to reconcile job to god and induce him to repent we see that all through job four and five elephants would reference the fact that there's a universal principle that sin is a product and or or rather that suffering is a product of sin so job hatterson by the time eliphaz speaks again he belittles job self self justification and by the third time eliphaz speaks he goes back to the all hebrew idea that suffering always implies sin so he was given no room for god being involved in this matter at all and i want us to catch this could be going somewhere with it build that build that argument looks to the authority of tradition so he is saying all my experience all the history all the tradition we ever believe he asked job how long will he make speeches full of wind i want to go with me to job eat if you would we can't get to all of it so i'm just picking out a few of them and listen to the approach and listen to what is being addressed here right build that speech this is job eight and verse one then build that the shoe height then answered builder the shute and said how long will thou speak these things how long will the the words of thy mouth be like a strong wind in other words he said job talking and it's just noise does that god pervert judgment or does the almighty pervert justice listen to this and look how dangerous this this statement is here if thy children have sinned against him and you have cast them away for their transgression so bill that is set telling job the reason your children end up dying is because they sin and he cast them away for their transgression you understand why job would get affected by this and this was these brothers attempt to help jobs i want us to see is not just job suffered in chapter one and chapter two you know but how painful are these words to job in his ashy you know what it is to be going through grief and in the midst of your grief your brother telling you well it's because your children sin is why you're going through that so this here is actually more painful than the lawsuit it's as if you're rubbing salt in your wound anybody with me verse 5 if thou witness seek unto god be times and make thy supplication to the almighty if thou were pure and upright surely no he would awake for thee and make the habitation of thy righteousness prosperous though thy beginning but small yet thy latter end should greatly increase now this song is very encouraging this is encouraging yet scary because this sounds like something to encourage somebody if you repent though your beginning was small yet thy latter end should greatly increase although this is a positive powerful statement it is misappropriation of scripture because this is not job situation so what we are seeing here as well in the book of job is people can use scripture and words with the intention of it being right but with a lack of knowledge of what god is doing it actually becomes destructive this is not something easy to teach but this is the reality of the situation here all right so we're building a little bit i'm not going to be too long with you right now by the time we reach the to let's jump to job nine then job answered so this is job response and said i know it is so of a truth but how should man be just with god if he will contend with him he cannot answer him one of a thousand he is wise and hot and mighty in strength who had hardened himself against him and had prospered which removed the mountains and they know not which overturned them in his anger which shaken the earth out of a place and the pillars thereof tremble which commanded the sun and it rise it knot and seal it up the stars which alone spreaded out the heavens and treaded upon the waves of the sea which make it actual orion and pleiades and the chambers of the south which do it great things past finding out yeah and wonders without number no he goes by me and i see him not he pass it on also but i perceive him not so job is responding say listen i can't fight god when i look at what god is what he does and then but job does not beginning to see certain things it's which you say he goes by me and i see him not he pass it on also but i perceive him not below behold he take it away verse 12 who can hinder him who shall say unto him what does thou so job is saying and and this part is right so what i find when you read in job is there are many things that are said that are correctly said but you see the emotion and the grief of job's condition coming out verse 13 if god will not withdraw his anger the proud helpers do stoop under him how much less shall i answer him and choose out of my words to reason with him whom though i were righteous yet would i not answer but i would make supplication to my judge if i had called and he had answered me yet would i not believe that he had happened unto my voice for he breaked me with a tempest listen to this verse here and multiply it my wounds without cause so what is very careful and i want us to catch this because most people don't take any time here job is starting to mix what is truth with his own personal perspective so he's accusing god of multiplying his wounds for no reason if it's one thing i want just to catch out of the teaching here is be very careful what you see in a trial in a situation in a conflict when you're going through a challenge when you don't understand what they're going through do not speak negative do not speak negative because what we see is jobs starting to defend himself but he's dropping certain things in his defense that is disturbing god anybody with me and we'll pick it up later on it's very subtle so if you don't spend any time and go through this to see okay what was he because how could god place a man as upright and perfect in job one one and his uprightness and his perfection is now being i want to be careful saying this being challenged through suffering in other words god was requiring from job a greater uprightness and a greater level of perfection in his life that could have only been arrived at true suffering i wonder if i catch this so when we talk about suffering as a believer god takes us through experiences to fine-tune things in us because job never had the opportunity to go through this kind of a test in fact job was so upright and perfect it took a great massive amount of trial intestines plus his friends accusing him for him to come to any point to begin to speak away he had never spoken in his whole life i wanted to catch this if i come and throw down your cup of water you wouldn't hold that against me it's a cup of water but if i come and break your your your your microwave if i said i feel a little kind of way but i said break my microwave you know i love him i know you know he has encouraged us and bible studying here but my microwaving uh and you know that place is closed where's my microwave so for the rest of this pandemic i don't know how he's gonna be food now if i dammit something more important so but isa come and mash up your fridge now your car call anything in the fridge the increase in pressure at what point i want i want you to bring it to like at what point would i have to match up your fridge and your microwave for you to say you know brother isaac really is something else you know now this is this is the teaching here with job god wants to push job to the limit to see at what point will the real job come out oh lord help us tonight in other words all of us under a little pressure we can handle ourselves in situations you know but if i keep tearing up the volume of your trials turning up the volume of your testing turn up the volume so at volume three you start to act up a little bit at volume four you're thinking about cursing at volume five you start to curse certain things by volume six your full-blown customer now you place by volume seven you reach a polling station by volume eight you're not you're not in church anymore by volume nine you don't want nothing to do with the gospel you you see the issue here so i want us to catch this now because a lot of us no but if i don't say the bride will be a haunted person you take groupon so there is also a promise of persecution and pressure so this teaching is to prepare us for all kind of situations that we have to deal with and handle it correctly this is to help us put into perspective the greatness of god for him achieving his purpose and we'll read some things in this book of job here so if i wanted to catch this lesson it is not as simple as job had and it was a test is what god was doing through the test is the deeper message of job which he was trying to figure out as well as his friends trying to put their finger because is it a secret sin or what is it let's go on so we we we we're moving on so by job 10 we we're walking through a little bit we're touching here just a little here by job 10 verse 1 job is still speaking he is saying my soul is wary of my life i will leave my complaint upon myself i will speak in the bitterness of my soul i will say unto god do not condemn me show me wherefore thou contend this with me so job reach a point upon mercedes challenge god no the heat is there this is him defending so i wanted to see it's like a fireside chat three friends on job and job is trying to respond to these brothers who are trying to help they are accusing him but he is not directly only responding to what they are saying he certainly have issue with god as well huh i want this to understand this because the lesson of this is be very careful who you're trying to believe this blame thing sat in genesis sir adam says the woman they give me it is in our human nature once you increase pressure you blame somebody so here it is show me where for now content is with me in the amplified that that job 10 verse 2 says i will say to god listen listen amplified version here listen to job job i will say to god do not con condemn me and declare me guilty show me why you contend and argue and struggle with me you imagine telling that to god we read in the same bible right so you will see it by the time we get to elohu job was so confident in his uprightness and his being perfect that job developed a subtle sense of arrogance and pride that he didn't even know he had about his standing so job had a level of self-righteousness that he did not even know he had i wanted to get this it was not so this is not a man dealing with lust and fornication this is dealing with now your uprightness create a level of pride that is now sin oh come on now your testimony create a birth you say but lord wait now i want you to show me lord i want you to show me what my issue is listen to what job is saying listen this is powerful jose i will say to god this is he ignoring the brothers and he said in their hearing i would say to god do not condemn me i really really amplified and declare my be guilty show me why you contend and argue and struggle with me so he's accusing god now of contending and arguing and struggling with him so job in his whole conversation in his analysis of the situation he is now blaming god for his situation so you see why why chapter 42 repentance is required now and now we have to check ourselves and why it takes pressure to now show how we will respond even to god verse three i want to read it from the amplified because it says listen to me does it indeed seem right to you to oppress to despise and reject the work of your hands and to look at favor on the schemes of the wicked so job is accusing god does it indeed seem right to you lord to oppress to despise and to reject the work of your hands i am the work of your hands now what i realize here now it is it is a subtle you know we did not teaching on on the spirit of entitlement because of entitlement it is as if job had reached a point where he felt that his standing didn't warrant a certain level of pressure oh come on now the way job is now dealing with his situation comes across as if job felt listen i've served you so well how could you oppress and reject the work of your hands in other words i don't think this punishment should be coming to me and job goes on and to look with favor on these schemes of the wicked so job is saying to god you're coming at me and you're looking at favor with fear by these schemes that you're awakened in other words why your body me i'm not going after the wicked verse four do you have the eyes of flesh do you see as a man sees are your days as the days of immortal are your years as a man's years do you seek my guilt and search for my sin listen to verse seven although you know that i am not guilty or wicked so you see now god see my written i need to teach job job show me a little lesson because job is willing to tell the lord in his uprightness and his perfection that you know i'm not guilty or wicked now this is where i say it's very interesting and this is why knowingly would mis apply to be dangerous verse 8 your hands have formed and made me all together that's a powerful that is the truth we we everybody can say that your hands lord have formed and made me all together would you turn around and destroy me i'm reading any amplified so job is saying lord if you make me how do you get to wrong and destroy me verse nine remember now that you have made me as clay so will you turn me into dust again so job is is is speaking stuff through scripture but at the end of the day he is actually having an issue with god's administration anybody with me i know most people never never hear this one before but i want you to understand because these situations arrive in all of our lives you know i can't understand why god do that i do understand why god allowed that i don't understand how he could preach or he could do this or god allowed that to raise that allowed that to fall and god made me and and god put me in and then listen to job this is i'm trying to keep it short but there's some meeting here boy listen to jobs job is like a job is expressing things that some of us may feel and think and never even see job said in verse 10 and job 10 10 are really amplified he said you have not poured me out like milk and curdled me like cheese you know have you not poured me out like milk and curd of me like geez you have clothed me with skin and flesh and knit me together with bones and sinews you have granted me life and loving kindness and your providence divine care supervision has preserved my spirit so job is mixing some positive things with his issues and his questions and his questioning of god yet verse 13 these present evils i'm really amplified you have hidden in your heart since my creation in other words job saying all the blessings you give me what are going to right now since i'm born you have this in your heart to do this to me listen it goes on he said i know that this was within you in your purpose and your thought so job is acknowledging that the activity is going through is because god planned it to be so so it is not as if job is ignorant this is why he can speak his wife and say you speak like a spiritually lacking spiritual knowledge of the defining plan of god job is not ignorant that is god operating it makes it clear here he is asking god why you are operating so you anybody catching this i wanted to see and look to the lens of what we have been through in our lives or what will be going to right now because job is expressing what most of us feel boy why boy why boy why why why the pressure why it can't be easier oh gosh if there's not one thing it's our next thing everyone next thing is the next thing on top of the next thing that he's diced job and job able because of his spiritual knowledge and his work to say but lord i want to read it again i like all that song you have you not poured me out like milk and curd of me like cheese clued me with skin and flesh knit me together with bones and sinews granted me life and loving kindness and your providence i really amplified divine care supervision has preserved my spirit he put it all upon god yet in verse 13 these present evils you have hidden in your heart since my creation i know that this was within you in your purpose and thought listen to verse 14 and it's important friends i'm moving between the king james and the amplified and if you're studying you're doing baptism it's really great to see the amplifier verse 40 said if i sin then you will take note and observe me so he knows i'm going to tell god but like is that some things you're really watching you're taking notes and you would not acquit me of my guilt if i am wicked water me and if i am righteous i dare not lift my head verse 16 should i lift my head up you would hunt me like a lion and again you would show your marvelous power against me some of this they'll have to do on their own because i want to keep on moving we're only in chapter 10 and i want to i want to kind of jump a little bit right so bear in mind all of this that job is expressing in his response to these brothers and his analysis of his current predicament and his belief his opinion his understanding his assumptions of what is going on these brothers are hearing it and they are responding to him so so far response then answered zofa the number tight shall not the multitude of words we answered in other words should we not respond to all them thing you're saying only you're talking talking talking talking and should a man full of talk be justified so thy lies make men hold their peace so these brothers saying you're talking too positive but at the end of the day there are certain things in what job is saying that they would have issue it and you could see how it will almost become a doctrinal debate because these brothers should be spiritually enough to reason he thinks that job might be saying that it's his emotion and his pain and his and his and his stress getting them to say these things verse 4 11 was for for dao has said my doctrine is pure and i am clean and dying eyes but all that god would speak and open his lips against thee that he would surely the secrets of wisdom that they are double to that which is no therefore and we read this last week that god exacted of the less than that iniquity deserve it so these brothers not discerning the reality they don't believe what joe believes job is acknowledging that god has something to do with it they are saying is not god do anything like that god acting yes but it's not because he's trying to do something else it's because of your sin and they're going after that road anybody with me right let's just go a little further i'm trying to close out here and are trying to all right so let me just skip now i read that last week i'm going to skip that skip that okay sorry i have three different things i'm reading from here okay i want to jump to job 16. so this is another of job's responses now so this is job's response to elle versus second you know presentation so job is saying and i want to read out of the amplified then job answered and said i have heard many such things worrisome and miserable comforters are you all is there no end to your futile words of wind or what plagues you so much that you so boldly answer me like this i also could speak like you if you were in my place i could compose and join words together against you and shake my head at you but instead i could encourage i could strengthen and encourage you with the words of my mouth so job is saying all accusing me all you're pressuring me now bear in mind friends that these three friends are also part of god's willing what this doesn't understand is it so god is allowing this as part of job's whole experience because if these brothers hadn't said what they said about job's situation the responsive and and i want you to take care of yourself job is the one under the examination here this is the deeper lesson because i don't want to come across although these brothers were dealt with the red exam here in job is job we know these brothers are off but the real exam don't let don't let miss the picture i don't want you to leave here looking for your three friends who telling you the wrong thing that is not the objective the objectives are defined i suspect you you are elie farzino you are you like a builder i don't know i don't know when people said they tag all the builders in the elephants in the zoo first in their life that is not the objective of this teaching i want you to catch that job is the one on the testing block and the test was a progressive test from his wealth from his family from his health and now to dealing with the issues because listen life and death is in the power of the tongue if there was ever a message on you could say the right thing and you should say the right thing and be careful what you see is the book of job because from chapter 2 all the way to chapter 31 is all about seeing things and what is said and god judged based on the activities between chapter 3 and chapter 31. anybody with me tonight we still in job 16 verse 6. if i speak to you my miserable comforters my pain is not relieved and if i refrain from speaking what pain or anguish leaves me listen to job in verse seven but now god has exhausted me that is he amplified in seven in the kingdom but now he has made me weary he's talking about the lord so job reached a point where he hit say listen to the lord the lord has tied me listen to verse seven it goes on king james said dawaz made desolate all my company in verse 17 amplified i said oh lord you oh lord have destroyed all my family and my household verse eight you have taken a firm hole on me and have shoveled me up it has become a witness against me and my leanness and infirmity rises up as evidence against me it testifies to my face about my guilt his wrath has torn me and hunted me down he has gnashed at me with his teeth my adversary sharpens his gaze and glares with piercing eyes at me so job is now processing his experience most people have not read and looked at what transpired in the hardship now listen i don't want you to even judge joven because you don't know how you will handle your sheep we are fortunate to be able to get insight into jobs our sheep but all of us have our ash heap to go through and we are being cautioned by the word with how you manage your personal predetermined assigned ash heap that god will put you to sit down on for your character to be developed anybody with me listen you're not missing it you're not avoiding it it come in you know if you're not in it already it come in you know because god wants this thing like you know buy me gold tried any fire so i want to highlight it is easy to speak nobody job who had and lost and got doubled for his trouble that is wonderful but i want to focus deeper or above the double for his trouble and focus on the change in the man it is easy everybody want to double for each other partner so i had one house now i have two house i had one can i have two cars easy that is an easy teaching what i want to deal with is the change in the man from how he spoke his issues in his life because at the end of the day the job 42 man was a different man he couldn't talk the same way because this experience took him to his core you know what it is when a man has no money no family and you're sick and you feel like you're dying there and you begin to speak and you begin to go to your struggle this is this is the real pain of life let's move on i'm running all the time i can't believe i'm running all the time this will be a short teaching tonight so i want to touch now verse uh job 17. he's still speaking here my breath is corrupt my days are extinct the graves are ready for me in the amplified my spirit is broken my days are extinguished the grave is ready for me this is a man who has reached a point where he's ready to give up you know he is ready to truly toe well as it will and it goes on by verse 15 of that same chapter 17 you see where now is my hope i don't want to highlight no bear in mind these brothers are being inspired to see things in their mind to help some of it is some level of comfort poor comfort joke cause it or or weak comfort but at the end of the day they are also challenging him bill that in job 18 then answered build that issue white and said how long will it be air you make an end of words mark and afterwards we will speak in other words in the amplified how long will you hunt for words and continue these speeches do some clear thinking and show understanding and then we can talk so then fellas challenge is it's almost like a trial going on in them there's a contest going on i know so i wonder i want to skip there because job 19 is powerful jobs reply job 19 verse 1. then job answered and said how long will you vex my soul and break me in pieces with words these 10 times you have reproached me you have you are not ashamed that you make yourself strange to me in other words you wanted to seem to wrong me and had any hearts against me so now he's accusing his friends of of of being haters then right and be it indeed that i have heard my error remain with myself in other words in the amplified if it were true that i have heard my error would remain with me and i would be conscious of it all right no again i want you to see the danger in job now mixing and matching his knowledge of god and god's grace and god blessing god's power with his own perception of god by the time we reach to job 19 verse 6 and john 19 is interesting we'll see why but john 19 6 says know that god had overthrown me and had compassed me with his net so job is saying know then that god has wronged me in the amplified and overthrown me and has closed as net around me behold i cry out wrong but i'm not hood so job is basically saying in the reference says behold i cry out violence and i'm not good i shot for help but there's no justice he has walked up my way so that i cannot pass and he has set darkness upon my parts he has stripped me of my honor and removed the crown from my head he breaks me down on every side and i am gone he has uprooted my hope like a tree he has also kindled his rat like a fire against me and he considers and count me as one of his adversaries so job reached a critical point by job 19 saying listen it's as if god and i are our enemies you you see this here you see how pressure can make people say and even believe things that are not true because we know the top of the story we know what god really doing but look at the man in his situation oh we could think but had to be not i have been right all this time it had to be i don't know what it is but god do something to me i really don't know what it is go ahead is my enemy verse 13 i'm reading from the amplifier and you can you could you could check it he has put my brothers far from me and my acquaintances are completely strange from me my relatives have failed me this is everywhere and my intimate friends have forgotten me those who live temporarily in my house and my maids consider me a stranger i am a foreigner in their sight i call to my servant but he doesn't answer you see he is he drove jerry's a point where he said he called him how come he's servant he even come i have to employ him with words in other words when i give command to my servant here come after use words to get myself until respond when servant do everyone to come you see job how god stripped and stripped and stripped so that what remains is just what god wants to shape and mold verse 18 even the young children despise me when i get up they speak against me now we talk about job but this is the real story this is what a man going through you know this is not well you know job isn't a sheep and god take it away and go restore him job is telling you that listen when i get up these children they speak against me all the men of my counsel hate me those i love have turned against me my bone clings to my skin and to my flesh i have escaped death by the skin of my teeth i'm reading from the amplified here have pity on me have pity on me or you my friends for the hand of god has touched me why listen to this statement do you persecute me as god does so job reach a point he's actually convinced that god is persecuting him he's not seeking as god trying to shape him mold him bring character build character you see why perspective is important and why job had to repent these statements are the cause for job repentance in chapter 42. and then by the time we reach and this is the same chapter from verse 23 oh that my words were not written all that they were printed in a book that they were graven with an iron pen and lead in the rock forever so job this is the the the the mix of the man now after you say all of that he said for i know that my redeemer lived he is still at war in himself for i know that my redeemer lived and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth and though after my skin worms destroyed his body yet in my flesh shall i see god whom i shall see for myself can the church say amen so let's try to try to kind of bring this and you can see how i know reach 19 out of 42. i i really get anywhere but i want to kind of jump a little bit because we're kind of talking about job and his friends and his response and at the end of this at around job this is job let's go to job job 26 quickly by the time we reached job 26 this is like like i would have said i want to be the the three brothers uh elephant spoke three times job would have responded each time bill that spoke three times job responded each time well zofa these brothers when you spend another time each time they spoke was less and less until that like really wasn't even saying anything afterwards i felt like i just wrote the argument because they recognized there wasn't a nowhere with you nothing they told job was shaken job job was not accepting that it was something in his past it was nothing and he was right it wasn't an issue of secret sinner that was not the issue it was the issue of something in his past the sin that job had to be repenting oh was what he was committing any present you know that's that that's that's that's that's that's huge right there the issue with job and his sin because what caused this child was not sin it was god approval it was god saying have you considered myself on job but job in his response to the situation for the first time quote it is almost his testimony his responses was creating a situation that god said well no i have you where i want you because now i can root this out of you anybody with me so for five it's almost like you know in a court case you take the stand then you take the stand and take this time so so here it is from let me get my notes it's a lot of voices here to back then whatever you have to forgive me so from from job 26 to 31 which is 26 27 28 29 30 31 so 26 27 20 29 31. five chapters is job uninterrupted his closing arguments so to speak it's the last his last his is where he poured out everything he wanted to see against them three brothers who spoke and we don't hear from them brothers anymore every single time these brothers spoke he rebutted them he had a response with them he argued with them and then by the time we get to chapter 32 is the entrance of elohu so let's just go to elohu i promise to get to this last week and we're going to try to kind of wrap up with with ella who ella who steps into the picture in job 32 seemingly coming out of nowhere and brother branham typed him as a type of christ so in the king james they would actually call it elohu's intrusion meaning he just steps into the picture all right so reading job 32 verse one yeah you have some time we need a few more minutes just to kind of kind of pull this thing together right so these three men cease to answer job so they give up they say listen we we ain't talking no more we're done all right so they stopped talking right and now it creates this window for this fourth character almost like the fourth man in the fire this is this is the fourth entrant all right there's nothing to really suggest that he had no big relationship to job like the tree so look at the approach so these three men ceased to answer job because he was righteous in his own eyes right so job was writing in their own eyes he had a legitimate reason to be righteous and he also failed to see the current issues then was kind of the wrath of elohu the son of barachel the buzaite of the kindred of ram against job was his wrath kindled because he justified himself rather than god in other words he justified his situation instead of justifying god in other words he take the right and putting god in me wrong and we read the examples of the verses where he talked about god being his enemy and he uses these different references challenging god also elohu listen also against his three friends was his rat kindle so elohu is upset with job and he's accepted the three men because they had found no answer and yet had condemned the job so he had with the three men who they had no answer but yet they're coming against job now elohu had waited until job had spoken we talked about the last five chapters job spoke because they were elder than he so elohim is coming now as a young man when elohim saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these three men then his wrath was kindled in other words if ominous of elohu was hoping that it would come to a right answer a right statement to help joe get back on track verse six and ella who the son of barack child the buddha answered and said i am young and you are very old wherefore i was afraid and does not show you my opinion in other words i didn't know if i could speak i didn't want to get into the conversation i said days should speak in other words let let age speak let wisdom speak let me let the elders speak dears should speak people who have days of youth right and multitude of years should teach wisdom in other words i'm the young man here i heard only talking i assume that the elders here should have some answer and saw joke out job yourself i don't know what's going on but there is a spirit in a man there is a there is a spirit in man and the inspiration of you almighty given him understanding so so elohu is saying i don't have the age i'm not an elder like holy but there is a spirit in man and the inspiration of you almighty giving him understanding great men are not always wise we're going to some night teaching here neither do the age understand judgment so you see i'm sitting down here and i expect the age and the old people to give good advice here but i realized that that that this is not always the case therefore i said hearken to me i also will show my opinion so in one sweeping introduction who is saying age not always right there's something called inspiration and i'm gonna quickly speak under inspiration behold i waited for your words i give heir to your reasons while you search out what to say ye i attended unto you meaning why are you trying to find you want to look at paying attention and behold there was none of you that convinced job or that answered his words meaning job had questions only i helped him and what all you see oh they are giving him answers or you're wasting time less you should say we have found out wisdom god trusted him down not man so elohim settle it with this operative he said god is who did that not man now he have not directed his words against me neither will i answer him with your speeches in other words he's saying i am bringing a different perspective to the situation all right i'm trying to close out here you have to forgive me all right so and here it is i want to go to job 33 verse 8. and here it is why i made a statement and ello who says it the issue with job so so so so elohim makes clear that the issue with job is is god but job's sin he put his thing on one terminate in john 23 verse 8 he say surely thou has spoken in my hearing so he's saying you said these things and i heard you say it you said it for me to hear it so he going straight to the heart of the issue with job here now surely that was spoken in my hearing and i have heard the voice of thy word saying i am clean without transgression like what was saying right i am innocent and neither is the iniquity in me behold he find it occasions against me so he is quoting what job was saying all along he counted me for his enemy you remember we read those words we took it out my readers would write he put in my feet in the stocks he market all my parts he mentioned he's taking notes on his sins and all these things right verse 12 behold in this thou art not just in other words you will not write job in making those statements i will answer thee that god is greater than man why does thou strive against him so elohu is calling out job both on the statements he made and his belief that he could fight god why does thou strive against him for he giveth not account of any of his matters oh that is powerful eh in other words he does not answer you with his doings he's not held to your standard he's not required to explain himself anybody with me we're touching this last week right for god speak it once year twice yet man perceive it it not this here is i'm trying to close out this is powerful in other words god speaks he speaks one way he speaks another way but man don't even perceive when god is speaking so elohim is saying god is speaking on this matter this whole situation is god speaking and an elder who right here is explaining the whole situation all right in a dream in a vision of the night when deep sleep fallen upon man in slumbering upon the bed then he opened the ears of man and sealed their instruction so elohim is saying god speaks in different ways he could speak when you're in your sleep he could speak in the night he could speak in dreams and seal at his instructions so god could minister in any way he wants to all right listen and this is the objective that he may withdraw man from his purpose this is not his as in god's purpose man from his own man's purpose and high pride from man so right here elohu went after this sin of pride which we know the sin of pride was the first great sin right that's the sin that lucifer lifted up himself and said i will i will i will i will right so he is in his watching job he seeing joe became uh proud of his uprightness proud of his testimony proud that nobody could put a thing on him proud that that he's a certain kind of man and his pride created a level of entitlement because he he he raises entitlement god do this to me so based on how you treated with me before how can you do this thing to me now high priest man he keeping back his soul from the pit and his life from perishing by the sword and listen to verse 19. and this really most people don't read this but this is powerful listen he chasing it also with pain upon his bed in other words god put you on a bed of sickness for a purpose it's written right here he is chastened also with pain upon his bed and the multitude of his bones with strong pain so that his life abhorred bread and his soul deity meat his flesh is consumed the way that it cannot be seen and his bones that were not seen stick out yeah his soul draw it near onto the grave and his life to the destroyers powerful stuff right let's go let's try to close out here so we know that elohu was picking up something because these same things is what god picked up in 42 in chapter 42 with what job's statements were and basically this is the lesson to close this out job's suffering had driven job to see things about himself and about god that were not right even though job was a righteous man as we said at the beginning he had a transition to go through to move from this upright man to a greater testimony in a greater walk that could have only been proven try tested and come to life through his suffering i'm getting ready to close out now elohu was bringing out and we read it there in in in that scripture then in job 33 about god speaking one way and in two and joe and elohim tied the pain of sickness and god speaking true vision of these things as two ways that god speaks to man for his good that as we said in verse 17 he may turn aside from his way turn aside from his plan and his purpose and turn away from pride in other words god's purpose is to save man deliver man through all of these experiences in other words elohu was not painting god as job did or even as he treatmented as just a god as an angry judge but elohim was showing that god as a redeemer a savior and it was a surgeon knife being operated not a whip upon job's life so it was not god punishing job with a whip but it was a very clinical surgical operation to cut pride out of job to gut the super-self-righteousness of the job to cut the things out of job's life that job didn't even know was there until as we said before the heat was turned up until there was so much pressure that job saw things about himself that he never knew he had i'm getting ready to close out here now all right so let me just find a point i still have some more stuff but i will close with this there's perfection that comes through suffering nobody likes to suffer but there's perfection that comes through suffering the psalmist david said in psalms 119 71 it is good for me that i have been afflicted that i might learn thy statutes so david realized that it was only through his affliction there were certain teachings and learnings you learn a lot out of blessings friends but you learn more out of suffering we know how the story of job ends you know but i want to challenge us all above all else to have the right attitude through our trials that god in his wisdom sends our way whatever the trial may be whatever the test may be and if it is and especially when and most importantly when you don't understand it is better to say nothing that they say the wrong thing i'll say it one more time it's better to say nothing i have to say the wrong thing and as brother branham said if you have nothing good to say about somebody sometimes you just just stay quiet because life and death is in the power of the tongue trials will come testings will come situations will come conflicts will come people who you trust who you love who you admire who you respect who you hold dear it is evident when you look through the conversations i'm wrapping up that job had a level of respect for these men you know he had an expectation of how this should help him it is just that they didn't help in the way he thought they would and he didn't realize that all of that was part of his exam the thing about it is friends god doesn't tell us what is you know in exam yeah the the first paper or the second paper or the ap or paper b or paper one or the first exam and second so so so you have different papers in the exam then god will tell you now which how much papers you have what is part of the test because in in in god's word even the invigilator is part of the test you don't know who god can use so when job taught the test was chapter one chapter two here it is his test went all the way up to elohu now coming to say listen you didn't realize it on a job but all of the conversation was also in the exam too you know you might feel your past chapter one when he said the lord gave the lord take it away you passed up to two when you say you speak like a foolish woman and i say nothing negative in fact chapter two end with job saying nothing at all if it didn't go beyond chapter two joe passed the exam but you real exam that caused the repentance started in chapter three when jobs had to say i wish i was never born we read it last week we cursed the day because the night because the night i was conceived that's all jokes happened in chapter three that's when after seven days of silence it really hit him what happened he said no no no no no no because the day i was born no no no no crazy day i was conceived let the sun door shine let me cloud over here and that open a tidal wave of his friends saying job what's wrong and job starting to defend and then recognize the witness if i saw righteous why god doing this at me i saw them all these years why he take my children why he checked my house well either enemy of god how could god bless on one hand and why god don't look at the enemy that's how joe became he watching the evil no you know i wasn't evil he coming at me and job began to get riled up and god's saying but look look at the exam chapter one and two was the was the the the pre-exam the real exam and you're acting up in the real exam so i want to encourage us you don't have to get ready if you stay ready i want to challenge you church operate as if you're always in the exam and we are because the prophet taught us the tutor the holy spirit is watching your conduct it is your behavior brother i'm true adoption he said i stomped him i turned the church against him i turned his wife against him i stomped him and and he still have a good behavior that is this is the message you know and we said it last week and i'll close with this it ends now with the virtue of the age because for job to be fully released he had to forgive these same brothers although he had his own issues he had to forgive them to pray for them which is broadly kindness on display so this book of job is about character suffering testing and trial because power without character is satanic anybody with me but if you go through the test and say the right thing act the right thing then god could confirm you with power can we bow our head so we're praying our heavenly father we thank you tonight for this closing lesson of this story of job there's so much more in this and lord it is your will we'll get back to it but i pray that god that you help your people as we go through so many different trials and tests and situations where it could almost create situations where we come to question you or question what we believe or what we know to be true we see a man job with a testimony lord and under pressure he showed certain things that lord you were pleased to be up to operate on and to cut out and to shape so that at the end of it if he'll be a different man it was not the same job one man that was in job 42. he was a different man he had went through some stuff lord and you brought him to that point of reconciliation repentance forgiveness you brought closure to his life and you blessed him because he was willing to admit where he went wrong he was willing to acknowledge that he said the wrong things and he made it right with you god help us tonight lord to be so cautious to not say the wrong things lord and if we do fall and fail lord as we sometimes inevitably do further give us the grace to repent and to look back at this as an encouragement to us that you are not doing anything to punish and to hurt your children father but lord all of your actions all of your movements all of your decisions is to bring us to a greater closer walk with you and to manifest your life through us help us to see it help us to understand it lord that you have a plan for each of us in this room tonight and for those who may listen to this tape that your plan would always come to pass lord your plan would always bring us to the state that we should be in and lord by your grace and your love you want us to have the right attitude not even jesus lord on his road to calvary said lord if it's possible let this cup pass he looked at the suffering he had to go through and it felt looked seemed like he was going to be too much but he was willing to say lord nevertheless not my will but thy will be done help us lord to walk into the suffering that you have for us what we can see and what we may never see with the right attitude to say lord not my will but thy will be done may you bless your church may you bless your sons and daughters may you minister to the years of salvation lord may you bless the service tomorrow night lord the prayer meeting is coming friday the service is coming sunday the upcoming convention in just over two weeks lord may lies be changed and transformed may the church grow from strength to strength may character be formed through this pandemic that when we get through this lord we'll be different people we'll be able to see the job one man and the job 42 men are two different people and we can see the pre pandemic versions of us and the post pandemic versions of us are two different people because you took us through some stuff that you could be more visible in our lives may you bless the people tonight in the precious name of jesus christ amen and amen and amen god bless you church thank you for being a wonderful audience uh we have a two-week uh bible study vacation it doesn't mean a vacation from reading your bible it just means a pause so that the ministry can work on the convention and we look forward to our next class by the grace of god uh on july the 13th stay on fire stay in prayer stay in the wood and i encourage you read more of job it's 42 chapters be able to pass that class and graduate and take lessons from this great teaching that the lord left for us in scripture may the lord bless you richly keep one another in prayer and live a heart of love a life of love don't let things get to you don't don't hold things drop drop it drop it drop it and what god bless you may the lord bless you love you god bless you good night
