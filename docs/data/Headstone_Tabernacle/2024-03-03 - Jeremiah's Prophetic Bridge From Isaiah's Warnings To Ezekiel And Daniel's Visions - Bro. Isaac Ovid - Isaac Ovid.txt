Moses and said let us go up as once and possess it for we are well able to overcome it that's numbers 13:30 and I want to bring back a few things that we said in prayer service prayer service service night so he's talking about borderline and if you're the borderline come on over cross into Jordan said now when you see the 10 of them with theologians the 12 SP remember what God did he sent out 12 men to bring back evidence to the people because God loves to show his faithfulness God loves to show that he's true to what he promised he doesn't play games he doesn't play his slight of hand and Shady stuff he like to say you know this I Pro is you this look at here so he sent out these 12 men to bring evidence to his people and 10 came back and so on right I we know they're negative and whatnot he said you 10 of them were theologians they were looking at what they could see intellectually but Caleb and Joshua was looking to God's promise praise God he said I've already give it to you and you know you have 10 men inside of you right no you don't know you have five senses of the Flesh and five senses of the spirit 10 of them and all of them is try to tie up to affect you from believing what God Said your feelings your emotions your your memory your conscience your taste smell fee and touch and you had to shake off all of that to believe what God have said if you only watch those senses and those feelings and those imagination doubts will hit you questions will come to you but you shake all of that all them 10 intellectual all them 10 praise God five cens of the flesh five C of the spirit you shake that off and you say God said so God can't lie God going to fill me God going to heal me God going to deliver me God going to break me out praise the name of the Lord do you believe that all right almost done as brother Isa get prepared to come and he said now watch and then now watch this now so okay so there is the big print take it land is yours and then the fine

to God give the Lord a shout in the house we have to get it [Applause] right and the last thing I'm going to close is [Music] this so the church is not in its right state yet we have to remember that it is not matured so we just have to linger and do the best we can and there is no one can bring it to maturity no fivefold man no message man no more no man could bring that to maturity here what only the Holy Spirit as we listen to it and I don't believe it will ever come by a man it have to come by God oh Hallelujah that's so much adults who immature they they don't get this they TR a tantrum children does do that you want a sweetie or you want a dis or cake or whatever it is and you don't get them Flor they carrying on have grand don't want pull things if they get away pull things they to thr down things like so like Havoc Havoc I holy man pray yeah like Havoc play Thunder he giving Thunder and he have his get vexed they reach no way yet and get Vex they get upset and angry so if we act like that when we get rebuked or cired or instructed we get immature and only one thing could bring you into maturity true experience so a lot of children who upset with their parents in managing them sometimes they only get sober when they get married and get their own children and especially when they're children just like them because they have a Time the first time they getting to see the self all the time they telling them but this is you this you me looking around so but when they have their own children and the children looking like them acting like them they o now they want to see what daddy and mommy was going through well you don't have time to do that now you have time because these characters in the Bible was given to us as examples to whom the end of the world have come let's all stand as we want to switch the order of the service God is so good God is so good God is so good about Isa come he going to minister to you and I thank God for him he has a unique gift with the scriptures with the Bible that I hardly see around and I just love it I love it so much and I believe God will bless him in his call and what how he administers the word and what you begin to see so much is how God has used his different servants but Anthony was tremendous on Wednesday we had some technical issues really tremendous and he was showing that the same God that come down to Moses Pillar of Fire and everything else was trying to kill Moses because Moses neglected to do something that his wife end up doing same God so don't don't mess don't mess with him you know don't don't don't don't think he you know he your friend and don't do that you know he's a god of judgment he's a god of anger yes he does get angry he get angry at Moses and his wife stepp into the Gap be careful he is God this morning God is so good hallelujah oh and God is so good God is so good Our [Music] God me God answers prayer Our God aners prayer Our God aners pray Oh Our God aners pray he's

softly let's just bow our heads for a word of prayer our gracious Heavenly Father we thank you this morning that we could be in your house one more time father it's not something we could ever take for granted Lord we are here because you called us and we are responding to that call we did not choose ourselves we did not call ourselves father Lord in our broken condition born in sin and shaped in iniquity father your mercy and Grace found us and shook us to a realization of who we are and that a price was paid before we even on this Earth Lord and we have our struggles we have our ups and downs we have our moments when we are on the victory Mountain and we have time when we're in the valley but Lord through it all we have learned to trust in you and Lord in the depths of our soul we could thank you that even when we fail that you are faithful father Lord you are faithful in our trials you are faithful in our struggles you are faithful in our weaknesses you are faithful in our going out and you are faithful in our coming in Lord and no wonder they could sing the song Great Is Thy Faithfulness father Lord we struggle and we go up and down but you are constant you are faithful you are the god that changes not times change season change governments change Kings change but Lord you are the same yesterday today and forever Lord I'm unworthy to stand behind this sacred desk to speak to the purchase of the blood of Jesus Christ but Lord your blood makes it possible Lord and I pray that you could use me as your microphone this morning and may you speak directly to your needy children even speak to me also as we approach your scriptures that's divinely inspired for correction and for Repro and for encouragement Lord we thank you for the great Elijah prophet of Malachi 4 that could breathe life upon the written word and make it the reveal word to us that we could have the comfort of knowing that Rapture in faith is within our reach laying in the message and that we could lift up our heads looking towards Redemption not by an intellectual conception but by true a true revelation of the word for the hour father may you minister to your sons and your daughters those that are gathered here those that are on the internet Lord wherever they may be today may your word find good ground this morning and may you bless the service we ask in the precious name of Jesus Christ and the church says and the church says amen and amen so certainly a blessed privilege to be in the house of the Lord thank you so much musicians God bless you thank you sister Naomi for being part of it this morning God bless bless you you want to put your hands together for the musicians this morning amen I want to salute brother Anthony also for the song service today as well as the service last Wednesday night we got part of it but we know that God is moving God is in control we thank God for the prayer meeting last uh Friday and certainly last Sunday uh last weekend I was actually in Germany and I bring greetings from Pastor stefanus Co and Brena and the church there in Germany they send their love they send their greetings we had a special meeting there uh brother Jano from France an and M he and his church came over as well and we had a wonderful time around the word of the Lord and we know that the children of the Lord have a right to shout and sing and God is doing something everywhere all over the world the spirit is moving the but the prophet taught us that the angel is on the earth now setting things in order for the coming of the Lord so we thank him for what he is doing and uh just you may be see there just for just two or 3 minutes just want to just just touch on something here that I believe is also connected to what rovid preached a few weeks ago apart from the spiritual food and the spiritual happening in Germany I had the opportunity for the first time to visit the one of the most sophisticated Mercedes plant production facilities in Germany it was my first time seeing anything like it because uh Mercedes uh is a company that's 130 years old and I guess a lot would have changed over time with the way they make vehicles and the Technologies behind it and of course we over preached a few weeks ago about artificial intelligence and these things and it was quite something walking into into the facility and seeing automated robots moving around and if you step in its way it's stop for itself and when you walk it continue going and different things like that and and I was just marveling at man and his his work man and his achievement and it's significant because the brother Brana made a reference about the horse and the car and and moving from the horse and buggy to the car and the motor car and moving towards the airoplane and moving to spaceships and these things and he said that these Natural Things is a type of the spiritual and he said that we are supposed to be so much further up the road because man is always progressing and man is always achieving and the spiritual we are not we we we don't want to be in a horse and buggy age when the world is in an age of spaceship and rocket and these things and and it began to dawn on me and as I was looking around with in I think they had about 5,000 robots at work simultaneously 24-hour operation one part of it is 90 something per automated so no human involved in the production they have it down to a science almost a zero error production facility and I'm watching in amazement not just at the technology but what man could achieve and it took me back to what brother preached a few years a few weeks ago when he talked about how God had to come down in the days of the Tower of Babel because if God did not intervene he said that man is United and man would achieve it and nothing will stop man when he's United and he's focused on objective God himself had to step down to interrupt it and God's response to dealing with that situation was to confound their language so he could break the communication between the people so they could not work together but we realize that over the passage of time man has been working to reconnect now you have your phone that could actually translate language once more and man is talking about the but spoke about the neuralink in in in Elon musk's concept that they are saying that soon you wouldn't have to even think about speaking the next language because the neuralink and these things will translate once more language between languages we know back there on the day of Pentecost and right after they all heard in one common language so the concept of unity but the Brandon presented it as United under one head head of Christ but man is quickly using technology to once again recreate what existed there in Genesis as it was in the beginning so they're going to try to make it at the end time so I'm watching the unfolding of technology and saying as brother bam said we should be way up the road but I believe that we are in a season that God is about to do something Among Us and it's not going to be a long time to do it go there's not much time left this is why the prophet would say it'll be a short quick message it'll be a short short quick work it wouldn't take too much time because the word is already in the bride it just waits for the intelligence to activate what's been laying there all these years so I'm excited you have to forgive me when I stood in that facility I wasn't seeing the natural technology I'm saying but look how God is about to automate some things in my heart oh Hallelujah automate some things in my life where you can take no thought of what they have to say because it's now automated by the intelligence of the Holy Ghost anybody with me this [Applause] morning do you know that that Faith supposed to be automated that virtue supposed to be automated that Temperance supposed to be automated not with AI but the Holy Ghost will make it an automatic response when the devil expect you to hold a art it's automated that you drop the o or you don't hear me this morning I don't know if I'm home yet this morning that the automation of the Holy Spirit when he supposed to curse somebody and give a bad word or whatever the automation of the Holy Spirit changes your words and you can only speak [Music] love because not an intellectual expression but it's God himself automatically making themselves known and that seed that's in you is listen that seed has got to grow you know we don't have to force the seed to grow all you have to do is put the seed in the right environment because the promises every seed will bring forth after its kind so if the seed in you is the seed of the Holy Ghost and eternal life we not here to work you up to do it we are here to create an environment that the seed can grow the seed will take care of itself or you don't hear me this morning it's the properties of the seed to grow it's the properties of the seed to be Faith virtue knowledge Temperance patience calliness Bradly kindness charity that's what the seed is designed to produce what we are here this morning friends is to create an atmosphere so that the seed could grow we here to water the seed with worship oh you don't hear me this morning create an atmosphere to get everything else away from the seed uh so the seed could stretch and that Lily could press its way press its way past what happened last week press its way what happened this morning press it press past your limitations so I just thought I'd encourage you a little bit and to let you know that it's later than we think so much is changing there was a time you had to board a plane with a physical boarding pass now you don't need no physical boarding pass you could board the plane with your phone you just take your phone and you pass it and you board the plane you scan the plane that's where technology is going man is trying to approximate so many things that God is going to put Hallelujah where you could take no thought of where you want to go and the end up there they just trying to approximate but they could never have what you and I could have they could never do what you and I could do they could never experience what you and I could experience can the church say Amen let's all stand for the reading of the word I have four portions of scripture reading St Matthew 16 Jeremiah 29 Ezekiel 1 and Daniel one certainly good to see all of you in the house of the Lord PSS David said I was glad when they said unto me let us go into the house of the Lord Matthew 16:13 when Jesus came into the coast of cesaria Philippi he ask his disciples saying whom do men say that I the son of man am notice he's actually saying I am the son of man he didn't say I am a son of man he's actually declaring his identity to them he is giving them the answer before the question so he's asking a rhetorical question we say language right so whom do men say I the son of man am singular personal pronoun and they said some say that thou art John the Baptist some Elias and others jeremias or one of the prophets he saith unto them but whom say ye that I am and Simon Peter answered and said Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God and Jesus answered and said unto him bless art thou Simon by Jonah for Flesh and Blood had not revealed it unto thee but my Father which is in heaven let's go to Jeremiah 29 reading verse [Music] 11 for I know the thoughts that I think toward you sayeth the Lord thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected end then shall he call upon me and he shall go and pray unto me and I will hearken unto you and he shall seek me and find me when he shall search for me with all of your heart and I will be found of you sayeth the Lord and I will turn away your captivity and I will gather you from all the nations and from all the places whether I have driven you sayeth the Lord and I will bring you again into the place whence I caused you to be carried away captive let's go to Ezekiel 1 reading verse one now it came to pass in the 30th year in the fourth month in the fifth day of the month as I was among the captives by the river of Chiba that the Lord that that the heavens were open and I saw visions of God so I want you to understand that Ezekiel here is in captivity and in the midst of his captivity he's having a spiritual experience I was among the captives by the river of Chiba that the heavens were open and I saw visions of God in the fifth day of the month which was the fifth year of King Jehovah Chin's captivity the word of the Lord came expressly unto Ezekiel the priest the son of booie in the land of the Chalan as the land of the Babylonians by the river Chiba and the Hand of the Lord was there in his captivity upon him can the church say Amen our last reading Daniel 1 and verse 1 in the third year of the reign of je jehoiakim king of Judah came Nebuchadnezzar King of Babylon unto Jerusalem and besieged it and the lord gave jeho Kim King of Judah into his hand with part of the vessel of the house of God which he carried into the land of China to the house of his God and he brought the vessels into the Treasure House of his God and the King spake unto asanas the master of his unics that he should bring certain of the children of Israel and of the king's seed and of the princes children in whom was no blemish but well favored and skillful in all wisdom and cunning in knowledge and understanding science and such as had ability in them to stand in the king's Palace and whom they might teach that learn burning and the tongue of the Chalan and the King appointed them a daily provision of the king's meat and of the wine which he drank so nourishing them three years that at the end thereof they might stand before the king now among them were the children of Judah Daniel hananiah mishel and Azariah the three Hebrew boys Shadrach Meshach and Abednego right so may the Lord had a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated everybody feeling fine wonderful so for a title this morning Jeremiah's prophetic Bridge from Isaiah's warnings to Ezekiel and Daniel's Visions I'll see it one more time Jeremiah's prophetic Bridge from Isaiah's warning to Ezekiel and Daniel's Visions for a subject the unfolding mystery of God through Jeremiah and an inspiration the final Kings and the Eternal Kingdom may the Lord add a blessing to the reading of his word are you ready you have your seat belts on today Sunday today is the Lord's day we here for the day today I was glad when they said unto me let us go into the house of the Lords I want you to be in the spirit I want you to get excited because God is doing something tremendous I want to encourage the young people I want to encourage the calebs that this is our time this is our season and this is what we are here on the earth for the bills the bills will deal with themselves your mortgage your your problems they will take care of themselves but we have a job to do this morning and I shared with them in in Germany something but it says here all the time you cannot fight a full-time Devil with a part-time Christian walk you need to be a full-time Christian to fight a full-time devil so we are here to be full-time Christians to put our solar to the wheel in this great economy of God can the church say Amen so we read the scripture I want to start there in the New Testament and then we'll go into the old where Jesus is at the crossroads in his ministry and he asked the disciple the question what's the talk out there about me you know this who do men say that I am and what caught my attention is that there was already a talk about Jesus it was impossible to not have heard about Jesus his impact in his ministry his teaching and his miracles what he said what he did how he acted where he went how he moved was creating a stir among the people of that day in so much that there was a conversation have you heard did you hear what he said here did you hear what he did there did he hear what happened there did you hear about this man called Jesus so there were conversations that were taking place and Jesus was trying to now reach a point with his own disciples he said tell me what's being said about this ministry now what caught my attention is the fact that there will have been many prophets that walked the Earth before Jesus from the great prophet Samuel to prophets like Moses to to you name it from Amos and Joel and you name it throughout all Biblical history so it caught my attention when they started to call certain names because this was people's or man's trying to figure out who is Jesus so to the best of their knowledge they had narrowed it down after much research deliberation speculation and conversation to three different people they say some say you are John the Baptist now this is not a a a crazy statement because if you go to this is Matthew 16 if you check Matthew 14 you would actually see that even let me just get it quickly here in Matthew 14 verse1 at the time Herod the Tetra had heard of the fame of Jesus and he said unto his servants this is John the Baptist he is risen from the dead so there were people saying I wonder if John the Baptist raised again and this is this is Jesus is John the Baptist so up to the King Herod is wondering trying to figure out who Jesus was can the church say Amen then some say it could be Elias because we know Elijah went up in a chariot of fire maybe after all these years Elijah has come back because the the preaching that John the Baptist had and the preaching the way Elijah Elijah used to operate seem to be the same way Jesus operated so they say maybe John the Baptist maybe he's Elijah maybe we know Elijah didn't die maybe John the Baptist rose again or maybe others say he's jermiah so I said I try to understand what is it about this man called Jeremiah that made Jesus look like Jeremiah people say this have to be something like Jeremiah so I have to go back now and go back into understand now how this thing unfolded and we preached a few weeks ago about King uh about the prophet Samuel and King David you remember that and we say God never wanted man to have be ruled by a king it was never God's desire for man to be ruled by man can the church say Amen when they left Egypt they left under the prophet Moses and then they lived under judges and they had prophets among them and then there was the great prophet Samuel who was standing there as a prophet to God's people and he was the one that they came and say let's at the king like the others can the church say amen and he was so bruised by it so broken by it that God said you know what they haven't rejected you they've rejected me and God allowed Saul to be king in fact God chose Saul our was s brother over I want to preach a message the rise and fall of Saul the benjamite because Saul didn't start off bad Saul started off real good many people start off good in the Bible but they end up bad and it's a cautionary tale to us to not take things for granted Saul went out of the parameters God give him and God judge him and more and more we realizing people don't understand that God is a god of judgment he's a god of Mercy but he's a god of judgment Jud M he's a god of warning and he's a god of judgment can the church say amen and we know the story David is established as king after God removed Saul and after King David we have his son Solomon who was the last king that governed the entire children of Israel everybody with me because after Solomon at the end of Solomon's Ministry even Solomon started off good and ended up wrong I'm laying a foundation here now and the Kingdom of Israel is divided in the north with the Kingdom of Israel and in the sou with the kingdom of Judah Solomon despite his wisdom and his faithfulness eventually turned to God influenced by his wives who were pagans and God was so Furious in First Kings 11:6 and Solomon did evil in the sight of the Lord and went not fully after the Lord as did David his father then did Solomon build an high place for chimos the abomination of Moab in the hill that is before Jerusalem and for Molech the abomination of the children of Ammon and likewise did he for all his strange wives which burnt incense and sacrifice unto their gods and the Lord was angry with Solomon because his heart was turned from the Lord God of Israel which had appeared unto him twice not what is being written so God is saying I came to you how dare you turn away from God and had commanded him concerning this thing that he should not go after other gods but he kept not that which the Lord commanded I want you to see the picture and the context of God operating at different levels in different ways in different times achieving his purpose wherefore verse 11 the Lord said unto Solomon for as much as this is done of thee in other words actions have consequences God will forgive you but actions still have consequences in know Hallelujah I want us to get something here God's forgiveness doesn't take away God's ability and sovereignity to punish you when you step out of line God will punish you and forgive you and give you Grace and still punish you and forgive you and give you and still punish you it don't means god forgiveness means you don't get punished for stepping out the line because he's a god through his love that chasons oh come on now somebody as many as I love I rebuke and chasen and that's why we have to be so careful sometime we pray for people and God is saying is my judgment upon them you know you could pray as hard as you want if God is sending judgment to your house because of foolishness in your house no amount of prayer could turn that away in because God says it's already spoken it's already done and the matter is already settled turn from your ways if you had turned before when I warned you I could have done it but now we already messed up come back to God now before it get worse that's how all through scripture that's how God deals and listen to how God addresses this and we're going to build to something wherefore the Lord said un the Solomon for as much as this is done of thee and thou Hast not kept my commandment my Covenant and my statutes which I have commanded thee listen I will surely Rend the Kingdom from thee and will give it to thy servant so when the kingdom was divided it was actually not someone from your Royal Land it was a servant it was a military Captain became king in Israel not withstanding in thy days verse 12 I will not do it for David thy father's seek but I will Rend it out of the hand of thy son brother George go tell Solomon because of your father David this punishment is coming but I'm not going to do it to you but your son where is where the kingdom will be destroyed and ripped apart into two out of my respects for my servant my son David I'm going to keep this together until you die but your son will still have to deal with the consequence of your decisions that's why I preach sometime ago when lot went to Sodom lot could have handled the issues in Sodom the Bible said it Vex him daily but his wife couldn't handle it his children couldn't handle it we have to understand the decisions we make especially to the fathers and men in the house affect our families affect our children affect our situations what did Solomon's son do to deserve this there was nothing but God said Solomon judgment has to come but I love my servant David so because of that I'm in respect to David I allow you to die without seeing the pain of the Kingdom divided I want you to see and and it through scripture when we get to Jeremiah God tells Jeremiah all the time the people have lost the fear of God that's why they do what they do they don't know what the fear of God is and no wonder the Bible said the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom what this means is Solomon lost the fear of God because when you lose the faar of God that's the only way you could do something against the Commandments of the Lord anybody with me this is not a kind of jump and Shout for Joy kind of message I want to point you to the unfolding of the plan of God here verse 13 how be I will not Rend away all the kingdom but will give One Tribe to thy son for David my servant's sake and for Jerusalem's sake which I've chosen so we know through history 10 tribes formed Israel under the captain uh it was Captain Jobo who was a captain in the Army led the people aside and it left the tribe of Judah The Tribe of Benjamin and a few of the Levites will begin to call now the people of Judah or the kingdom of Judah and they stayed under Solomon's son so Solomon's son rabom just was he was the first king of Judah with just the tribe of Judah The Tribe of Benjamin and a few of the Levites who were there amen and to denore the Kingdom of Israel under someone who had nothing to do with royalty amen and listen to the politics of the day Judah still kept the temple Jerusalem so under King rehoboam Solomon's son the temple is under the control of the kingdom of Judah where the sacrifice is offered is under the kingdom of Judah and Jobo who is leading Israel say I am afraid that if the people go down to the temple they will backslide from me and go back and join anybody with anybody with me he was so concerned about the people going back to Jerusalem he created golden Cales the same golden Cales they left after Egypt he created golden CS to keep their attention there Hallelujah now he know he wrong you know but he afraid to lose members to this is politics now so he cre but George golden calves and say let's worship this so you don't have to go down to Jerusalem to the kingdom of Judah now you see why God but asby would be so upset Through the Ages about the fill done in Israel and in Judah over time and as you look through the lineage of the Kings of Israel and the kings of Judah it's two kingdoms struggling for their identity but that was not God's original plan for them to be two separate kingdoms anybody with me this morning I'm trying to paint a picture here to you amen so through all of this we find ourselves coming closer to our text this morning to the time Jeremiah is born Jeremiah is on the earth at the time of Jeremiah's birth the whole of Israel is in captivity Israel gone the northern kingdom is in captivity by the Assyrians they not nowhere WR anymore all of their Kings this is King Ahab all of them was Israel Elijah was the one who was dealing with Israel all along and those things that whole lineage there but by the time Jeremiah on he seene he's coming into shambles as it were because the whole of the Kingdom of Israel is in bondage by the Assyria and he's coming in at a time where there are only five Kings left that will finish Judah he's at a pivotal point in his journey the last major prophet before him was the prophet Isaiah the great prophet Isaiah who would stand and warn the people if you don't turn back to God you're going to be in trouble Isaiah would also give them hope and say Behold a virgin will conceive and he begins to point them to the promise and you know what the people did not listen they did not heed and every single King as you trace it down Israel is already finished the last kings of Judah forget it horrible save probably only one King Josiah who was the king when Jeremiah started his ministry he was the first king as it were and just to kind of point something to King Josiah King Josiah would have been the probably the grandchild I believe of Hezekiah who would have been under there would have been two kings it would have been the great grandson of King Hezekiah 2 Kings verse 22 Josiah was 8 years old when he began to Reign and he reigned 30 And1 years in Jerusalem verse two and he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord and walked in all the way of David his father and turned not as sight to the right hand or the left and it came to pass that he sent scribes to check certain things I want to drop down to verse eight and hilaya the high priest said unto shafan the Scribe I have found the book of the law in the house of the Lord I want you to watch you were that they found the book in other words no nobody nobody is reading the book this is what go told josua this book of the law should not depart from you but meditate day and night here it was somebody had to find the book of the law because nobody was paying attention to the book of the law I have found the book of the law in the house of the Lord and hilaya gave the book to shaan and he read it and shaan the Scribe came to the king and brought the king word again and said thy servants have gathered the money that was found in the house and have delivered it unto the hand of them that do the work and have the over sight of the house of the Lord and shaan the scribes showed the king saying hilaya the priest had delivered me a book and shafan read it before the king and it came to pass that when the king had heard the words of the book of the law that he rent his clothes and the King commanded elai the priest and aikam the son of shafan and abbor the son of Mah and shaffin the Scribe and Isaiah the a servant of the king saying go ye inquire of the Lord for me and for the people for all Judah concerning the words of this book now at this time all of Israel are already in bondage yeah it's just Judah is left now to do according unto all that is written concerning us and it goes on and the inquire Etc I want to push down and the king in verse 23 and the King sent and they gathered unto him all the Elders of Judah and of Jerusalem and the King went up into the house of the Lord and all the men of Judah and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem with him and the priests and the prophets and all the people both small and great and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the Covenant which was found in the house of the Lord and the King stood by a pillar and made a covenant before the Lord to walk after the Lord and to keep his Commandments and his testimonies and his statutes with all their heart and all their soul to perform the words of this Covenant that were written in this book and all the people stood to the Covenant and the King commanded hilaya the high priest and the priests of the second order and the keepers of the door to bring forth out of the Temple of the Lord all the vessels that were made for B in other words in the temple brother George they had temp they had vessels for Bal vessels for Idols they had gotten so backslid they had things in the temple that should not have been there if they had stuff in the temple that should not have been there how much more stuff in their homes that should not have been there all the vessel that were made for Baal and for the Grove and for all the host of heaven and he burned them without Jerusalem in the fields of kedron and carried the ashes of them unto Bethel and he put down the idolatrous priests whom the kings of Judah had ordained his forefathers the bsian Kings had ordained to burn incense in the high places in the cities of Judah and in the high places around about Jerusalem them also that burn incense unto Baal to the Sun and to the moon this is people in Judah and to the planets horoscope and all these kind of things and to all the host of heaven and he brought out the Grove from the house of the Lord without Jerusalem that's outside Jerusalem unto the book hedron and burned it at the brook hedron and stamped it small to powder in other words he is destroying everything that is filthy he is destroying the unclean thing he is going through every nook every cranny every room he say search anything that don't belong here according to the words of this law it should not be in this house burn it check every room check every drawer check every cupboard check every CET burn it throw it out kill the priest kill everybody my father's house will be clean somebody preach back to [Applause] me Hallelujah this is not the kind of jump for joy message but the reality is we got to have a clean house for the spirit of God to move freely Hallelujah no Idols no graven images no Gods unto yourself no gods of your imagination no false god no false idol and brother brandham thought us anything could be a God so this King Josiah he was young but he purpose in his heart we will live for the Lord can the Church Say Amen verse 7 and he break down the houses of the sodomites that were by the house of the Lord where the women W wo hangings with the Grove and he brought all the priests out of the cities of Judah and defiled the high places where the priest had burned incense from jiba to BBA and break down the high places of the gates that were in the entering of the Gate of Joshua the governor of the city which were under the man's left hand at the Gate of the city nevertheless the priest of the high places came not up to the altar of the Lord in Jerusalem but they did eat of the unleavened bread among their Brethren and he defiled toet which is in the Valley of the children of hindam that no man might make his son or his daughter to pass through the fire to Mo he's demolishing everything that is not Christian everything that is not Gold Everything Is Not holy everything is not pure it's got to go nothing will pass nothing will survive clean it out burn it [Applause] out and listen verse 11 and he took away the horses that the kings of Judah had given to the son these children of Israel the tribe of Judah dedicate horses and say these horses belong to the son at the entering in the house of the Lord by the Chamber of natam the Chamberlain which was in the suburbs and burn the Chariots of the sun with fire and the altars that were on the top of the upper chamber of ahaz which the kings of Judah had made and the altars which manesa had made in the two courts of the house of the Lord did the king beat down and break them down from den and cast the dust of them into the brook hedron this the first time in scripture you see so much being done to clean up the place when last have you cleaned your house when last have you cleaned your life when last have you cleaned your altar when last have you clean your environment from everything that is filthy everything that is unclean everything that is not pure everything that is not holy because you want to wholly follow the lord it's not a a an expression of a tradition but it's a reality that if God is God then serve him if God is God then worship [Applause] Him and listen all of the reading that goes on is about destruction I'm destroying listen I can't read it all because we will not finish but I can go down to verse vers 21 after everything is cleaned up and the King commanded all the people saying keep the Passover unto the Lord your God as it is written in the book of this Covenant they wanted even keep in the Passover the Passover but Jordan was a reminder of how they came out of Egypt and they had forgotten to keep the Passover and the Bible tells me in verse 22 surely there was not held such a Passover from the days of the judges that judged Israel no in all the days of the Kings of Israel nor the kings of Judah in other words Josiah oversaw the greatest Passover that Israel and Judah had ever seen what a king God give us men like Josiah who could read the word and do everything according to the [Applause] law so this was the king that was on the throne when Jeremiah Ministry started can the church say Amen Jeremiah verse one chapter 1 verse one the words of Jeremiah the son of hilaya of the priests that were in ananat in the land of Benjamin to whom the word of the Lord came in the days of Josiah the son of Ammon king of Judah in the 13th year of his Reign it came also in the days of jeim the son of Josiah king of Judah un the end of the 11th year of zedekiah the son of Josiah king of Judah so Jeremiah served under five Kings and we talk a little bit more about them but these were the five last kings that sat over the throne understand this by the time that last king that Jeremiah saw come off the throne there was there's been no King since that time so Jeremiah's Ministry is unique because he saw and many prophets prophesy of Destruction and prophesy and they never get to witness prophecy Isaiah said a virgin shall conceive he didn't get to see the Virgin conceive but Jeremiah stood warning the people if you don't turn around your life we will be taken over God will send the Babylonians turn around because God will judge us he prophesied and years later Jeremiah is being taken away into captivity what a painful experience for a prophet that's why they call him the weeping prophet because it pained him to see his preaching and the words of Isaiah and all the prophets go unheard unanswered unresponded to and the people still do what they want it wasn't easy for Jeremiah he was young he had his ministry young and this is should be an encouragement to us all about predestination because here it was in Jeremiah 4 then the word of the Lord came unto me saying before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee and before thou camest forth out of the womb I sanctify thee and I ordained thee a prophet unto the Nations do you realize that you are predestinated before you were even formed before you even born God has a purpose for your life that the devil cannot stop God was comforting Jeremiah and said Jeremiah take courage I want you to know before I formed the in the belly oh Hallelujah I knew thee in other words before you were a thought oh before come on now before you were an expression I knew thee and before thou camest for of the womb I Sanctified thee and I ordained thee this is an ordained Sanctified baby for the church Hallelujah Jeremiah is born and he's born under a covenant he's born under a promise he's born under a prophecy Jeremiah would have his struggles he would have his ups and downs Jeremiah got so depressed he say oh God I wish I was never born he said cu the day I was born just like how job got Jeremiah got into deep depression but it didn't change the fact that before he was born God knew him his depression his frustration his heart AE they throw him in prison they threw him in a pit and that don't change the fact that he was predestinated oh you don't hear me this [Music] morning do you know Jeremiah's own family tried to kill him in Jeremiah 11 the end of the chapter this same the priests that were in and a not in the land of Benjamin God had to go to Jeremiah to went to God and say Lord my old family trying to kill me Hallelujah but that don't change the fact that he's predestinated it doesn't change the fact that he's called it doesn't change the fact that there's a purpose of man his life and your problems your situation your challenges doesn't change the fact that there's a call upon your life and The God Who predestinated you is more than able to keep you in your hour of struggle in the hour of your ups and downs he said who we want you we call who we call he justifi who we justify he had already glorified those words are past tense God is not now listen friends God is not now choosing you you know God I wake up this morning and say well no let me choose s Abigail and let me call brother Mike and God I Choose You five years ago or 20 years ago or one year ago or 65 years ago he said before you were formed I knew you before you were [Music] born Hallelujah so in other was take courage and when you're feeling down go back to where you came from go back to where you started because you are Eternal you never had a beginning so you can never end let me remind you this morning who you are and whose you are allow me to remind you that you are Son of God you're a daughter of God and no weapon formed against you could Prosper you will get ups and downs you'll be chasen and corrected you'll be pushed aside and ostracized it doesn't change the fact that his hand is up upon you in your trial his hand is upon you in your Victory his hand is upon you even in his judgment his hand is upon you oh come on now though he slay me yet still I trust him oh I want you to get that friends even in the Judgment of the Lord H his Mercy is with you he said surely goodness and mercy will follow you all the days of your life God will take you through all kinds of experiences to get you where he want you to be Hallelujah somebody preach back to me this is not a Kinder Garden this is an army where you being trained and ready to understand that it's War and the God is God he is Sovereign in his ways he can do what he wants to do he will move and do what he wants to [Applause] do and nothing happens that God doesn't allow you think God didn't know the kingdom was going to be divided you think God didn't know how they're going to turn their hearts away from him how else could God be the one who said come cast your cares upon me how could God be the one who could say a new heart I'll give you a new spirit I'll give you I'll put my spirit in there isn't there a cause there has to be a situation that demands that God is [Applause] [Music] God somebody preach back to me Hallelujah he's not the god of convenience he's not the god of luxury he's not a god of retirement relaxation he's a god of judgment he's a God of Peace he's a god of blessing he's a God in favor he's a God he said if you keep my Commandments I will blessing I Will Bless [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Thee the great prophet Isaiah with his eagle eyes as a prophet could look through and see almost how much years would have to pass for a virgin he saw Mary carrying that baby and he could speak a virgin will conceive he could speak over the children of Israel he could speak over the children of Judah he said hearken unto my voice turn not your heart away from God put away the UN clean thing that's the way Isaiah left his ministry with words over the people is not that they did not know it's not that they did not hear huj and this was the backdrop under which Jeremiah would stand he's young he's un certain about himself he's not confident he feels unworthy he said God you got you somebody else Lord wh me and God have to remind him that before you were born this is what you're built to do I design you for this purpose you may not fully understand it but when I was putting the pieces together to form your character I pick all the pieces and put it together for you to handle what's about to take place I couldn't put Samuel here I couldn't put Isaiah here I couldn't put Nathan the prophet here I couldn't put anybody else here Jeremiah you are the [Applause] one [Applause] Hallelujah so Jeremiah there are different kinds of prophets but here Jeremiah stands here in Jeremiah 2 verse1 moreover the word of the Lord came to me saying go and cry in the ears of Jerusalem saying thus say the Lord I remember Thee the kindness of thy youth the love of thine espousal when thou wentest after me in the wilderness in a land that was not sown Israel was Holiness unto the Lord and the first fruits of his increase all that devour him shall offend evil shall come upon them sayeth the Lord hear the word of the Lord oh House of Jacob and all the families of the House of Israel thus sayth the Lord what iniquity have your fathers found in me that they have gone away from me here it is God is crying to Jeremiah what have I done wrong what have I done wrong in this message what have I done wrong to your fathers that you turn your heart from me God is crying out to Jeremiah tell me what I did wrong and I'll fix it because I cannot understand how I found you in a broken condition and I restored you and I picked you up I give you clean water I took it to your land FL milk and honey I went before Thee I cleared the way I cleared out the enemies I broke down the walls of Jericho I gave you a good land a land you didn't s for a land you didn't deserve I guided you through struggle I fed you in the wilderness when you were sick I told you what to

from me they have lost the joy they're not sacrificing they're not praying they're not seeking their face they have Idols in their homes the joy of the Lord is not there they walk out their homes without praying they live any way they want they don't even remember I exist what have I done wrong Hallelujah the weeping prophet I can't read all of it but the Clarance but Jeremiah said I wish my head was like water and my eyes like a fountain so that the tears that I want to cry my eyes can't cry as much as I want to [Music] cry Hallelujah Jeremiah was struggling with the humanness of his depth of crying he he said I can't cry enough I wish my head was like waterj and my eyes like a fountain so that I could keep crying because it pains me with how far my people have gone from me verse six neither said they where is the Lord that brought us up out of the land of Egypt have you forgotten that it's the Lord have you forgotten that you wouldn't be here if it wasn't for the Lord have you forgotten the Lord who brought you out have you forgotten when you was sick and you didn't know what to do c say Lord help me and mercy met you how many times you should have been dead already but Mercy met you how many times you give up on yourself of Mercy met [Music] [Applause] you things listen listen friends things could be bad but you know how much worse it could have been if it wasn't for the Lord I don't care how bad it is it would have been worse if it wasn't for the the Lord stop complaining I do not care how bad it is it would have been worse if it was not for the Lord come on let me say it one more time I don't care how bad it is it would have been worse if it had not been for the Lord whatever pain whatever struggle whatever you can't understand and can't figure out oh God why me and why this and why that the hand of Mercy is still upon you judgment is over the Earth judgment is over the church judgment begins in the house of God he said begin in My [Applause] Sanctuary H I can't read it all it's we're going to be here until next week Sunday but I hope this message gets home this is the same chapter brother brandham read when he preached the messages broken sisters in 1964 and 65 this is the same passage you read and he went down to uh to it would be verse for my people have committed two evils they have forsaken me the Fountain of Living Waters and hewed them out systems broken systems that can hold no water and but the Bram placed this as man-made systems man-made structures man-made order they have left a fountain and have create atis like a tank and brother Brandon preacher he says the tank now not connected to the Fountain the tank catching rain water and water from the thing and water from of the roof and the water becomes stale and stagnant and it can't hold because it broken it damaged because it's man-made that's how God is seeing his whole thing unfolding oh church and here is Jeremiah I'm going to kind of move through a few things Hallelujah let's go by to Nicholas to Jeremiah chapter 7 the word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord saying stand in the gate of the Lord's House so this is coming now straight to the church now stand in the gate of the Lord's House and Proclaim their this word and say hear the word of the Lord all ye of Judah that enter in these gates To Worship the Lord this is a message now to the church you're coming into the house of the Lord this is the message for you this morning thus sayeth the Lord of hosts the god of Israel amend your ways and your doings and I will cause you to dwell in this place trust you not in lying words saying the Temple of the Lord the Temple of the Lord the Temple of the Lord are these what he's saying here is this Comfort we preach all the time being in church being in the message is way more than that it's more than being in church he's saying always sit down here beli in lying words you're in church you're in church you're good you're good you're good you in the bride you in the message trust you not in Ling word saying the Temple of the Lord the Temple of the Lord the Temple of the Lord are these for if you thoroughly truly thoroughly amend your ways and your doings if you truly execute judgment between a man and his neighbor if you oppress not the stranger the fatherless and the Widow and shed Not Innocent blood in this place neither walk after other gods to your hurt then will I cause you to dwell in this place in the land that I give to your fathers forever and ever behold you trust in lying Words that cannot profit will he steal murder commit adultery swear falsely and burn incense unto bow and walk after other gods whom you know not and listen now and come and stand before me in this house in other words at tired if you live in your own way and want now come in church and stand up in this house which is called by my name and say we have delivered to do all these Abominations is this house which is called by my name become a den of robbers in your eyes behold even I have seen it sayth the Lord hallelujah I'm not going to read all of it I think you're getting the the message there so all of this is going on and there are five kings that Daniel would have served under Josiah was the first one he was the only good one and then after him was his son jeho has who reigned for three months before Pharaoh in Egypt if you go to Second Kings end of seconds you'll see it pharaoh of Egypt came and lock him up and carry him down to Egypt and then they replaced him with jeim another son of Josiah and it was Pharaoh nro who placed him there so it wasn't even the children of Judah brother George placing any Kings at that point the Egyptians came in and say all right this one we are like this one now who who is Josiah nexton let him put let put him up in in in that role there and he served as king for 11 years brother Clarence then after him was jein which was his son who reigned for three months and 10 days before nebuchad come and lock him up and took him down into captiv captivity and then the last king of Judah which was zedekiah which was Josiah's thirdd son he was the one who sat there and witnessed the fall of Jerusalem and the destruction of the temple but it's really interesting to note that while this is all taking place I want you to see a picture because I was very excited this morning sharing with my wife as she get she get any message twice brother Nicholas if you could put the slide for me with the five Kings the last five Kings so these are the last five Kings of Judah and many many times we look at scripture in isolation we see prophets in isolation so we hear about Isaiah and Jeremiah and Daniel and Ezekiel and different things so God is unfolding something at the same time so here we see here the last five Kings so Josiah was the one who cleaned up the house and after Josiah was his son who robes for who who ruled for about three months before he was deposed and after him we actually read this scripture you may have overlooked it but when joah Kim was King that was the first Exile so I want you to picture now Jeremiah is standing there watching these five Kings because he's serving all five Kings his ministry was about for about 40 years Jeremiah was prophet for about 40 years when joah came was King Young Daniel is being taken into captivity so it means that Daniel is on the earth as a young boy because we read the script in Daniel that they look for children who were bright children of science so Jeremiah is on the earth he's the major prophet and at the same time a young Daniel is not coming into his own he's young he's intelligent he's talented and he in the first Exile is being taken into Babylon jeim after he is removed from Power his son who they call konian in scripture that's when Ezekiel is taken into captivity so there's a moving so in we we might see in scripture Daniel and Ezekiel and Jeremiah but in God's Vision he's looking on the earth three of them are on the earth at the same time Jeremiah is in Jerusalem trying to get the people to turn their heart back to God the Bible said Ezekiel is captured and he's at the river chba we read it and Daniel is in the temple he's in the courts of Babylon so for around 10 Years brother the punch all three are on the earth Jeremiah is trying to get the people to turn their heart he's in Jerusalem Ezekiel is in the banks in the river his prophetic Ministry Rising he said there I was in captivity on the banks of the chba river and the Lord came to me and Young Daniel there is in the courts of Babylon being groomed into Power oh can the church say [Applause] amen and in isolation those in Jerusalem just seeing the Jerusalem picture those with Ezekiel now bear in mind Ezekiel Ministry is an exile Ministry he is preaching to captive people Jeremiah is preaching to people who are free and are still free until the final collapse but the word is spreading around because Jeremiah's Ministry goes abroad so you could read Daniel 10 and I was reading the word I hear the message Jeremiah preach oh come on now these ministers these prophets are on the earth within the same dispensation and their Ministries are overlapping brother Karen just like John the Baptist and Jesus on the earth at the same time John the Baptist is just 6 months older than Jesus and they're growing up together Johnny bapti Jesus they cousins they growing up together and then John's Ministry starts Jesus is there and for a while John has the Baton as it were until Jesus comes in the scene and then John say wait a minute I must decrease so that you could decrease so that you could increase right so Jeremiah is there first he's older than the other two Ezekiel was a young Prophet most people see him as an old prophet ezel was a young Prophet just like Daniel was a young ruler and here it was Jeremiah is getting older but at the same time Ezekiel is beginning to prophesy and his prophecies are significant because the prophecy is about context Daniel's words is also about context and within all of us every time and brother Bram said that I have the quotes there it was Jesus in Jeremiah it was Jesus in Daniel it was Jesus in Ezekiel because God is expressing himself and God so fit at this time to express himself at the same time in Three Sons with three different Ministries with three different types of messages here it is Jeremiah see get your had right you're not yet in bondage and here Ezekiel is seeing we in bondage but don't despair keep your head up what was ezekiel's Ministry in in in Exile it's not just we preach hear cand these Dry Bones live that's a powerful message but the reality is he was in Exile saying these dry bones that are in Exile we are no longer in Jerusalem we are no longer in the city we no longer have the temple but these Dry Bones son of man what do you see I see us in bondage I see myself in trouble I see my life in sh May the words of Ezekiel if you in bondage this morning then the words of Ezekiel is for you this morning because you're not going to stay in Exile oh come on now somebody preach back to [Applause] me can the Church Say Amen let's keep going I'm just showing you a few things Bible study so there so so so I also want to see you appreciate that the the book of Jeremiah is not in chronological order so you can't read from one like I hear people say I read the Bible cover to cover that's not how it works because the book of Jeremiah is not sequential 1 to 52 52 chapters but it's not written in order amen so you have to have spiritual eyes to understand what happened if you don't see the timeline then you miss certain things but the reality is in the midst of Jeremiah's Ministry he goes into this is Jeremiah 31:31 behold the days come say the Lord that I will make a New Covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah here it is something begin to happen now because God is bringing he is deliberately bringing the house of Judah to an end in that form so this is not but the George just a matter of Kings out of God's favor God really know that the true heir to the throne is coming and the true air to the throne will not be a man the true heir to the throne is not a normal man the true son of David because David was promised to be that Throne forever can the church say amen and all of the Kings went up and down Josiah was great but he wasn't the perfect King for it and after him it just went downhill and from that day the throne has been empty waiting for the rightful King no wonder when Jesus walked the Earth they say son of David Son of David because they knew that that Throne is empty waited for a son of David to sit on oh come on now somebody preach back to me no more will a man of sin sit on that Throne no more will a king that could be up and down be on that Throne only the King of Kings will sit on that Throne can the church say Amen no God will trust no man to sit in his throne however he said did that over overcome will sit with me you can't sit there by yourself hallelujah what jiah did no other man will do but to him that overcome it you will sit with me in my Throne so it's amazing friends to see God work it's mindblowing because through judgment you know God told Jeremiah to tell zedekiah the last king surrender to Babylon don't fight it the judgment is sure there was a false prophet Hanah anybody remember that one Hanah came to church but the terrant in the church and he came to the chur and said God told me he has broken the power of Babylon and in two years we'll be fine and everybody say Amen that message is sound good know everybody want to hear that message in two years we coming back Glory Hallelujah he said th say the Lord in two years the power of babon what a powerful message and and Jeremiah brother Clarence put on a wooden yoke on his neck to show we have to go into bondage yes and IAH was so anointed false anointed he went and take the Yoke from Jeremiah's neck and broke it you see Church you see it here we break Babylon Babylon is broken if you see the convention people run around the building people jump and dance they say yes see other service end Babylon is broken NE touch me Jeremiah stand up right there and the Lord told Jeremiah go and tell that false prophet that the wood yoke you just broke will be replaced for an iron Yol that cannot be broken and because you have lied about what I said this is God saying he will die this very Year and that Pro died very year because the Judgment was sure throughout the Book of Jeremiah he talks about war unto the false prophet and the false teachers who lie saying I had a dream I had a dream I had a dream I don't have time to go into it now he say saying things people want to hear and he goes into what they were prophesying is like you know God is a good God and you are the neck and and and not the tail and above and not fantastic preaching but if you need to repent repent and Jeremiah say they were not preaching repentance thus say the Lord all is well with you he has fil in your life how how how how it could be well you stacking false gods in your house and all is well hallu Jeremiah say burn the unclean thing kill the filthy thing get it out your house the music that not supposed to be there the clothes that not supposed to be there the friends the whatever it is kill it and the Hand of judgment is working everywhere now because Jeremiah is seeing it unfold in his spiritual eyes that there's nothing they could do at this point to avert it because the sovereignty of God is at work because God is interested in his throne being governed a certain way and he also wants a United Kingdom a certain way not the United Kingdom of this world can the church say Amen so let me just go on here could you take some more I kind of all over the place you know I just hoping that somehow but the CL find a little piece of good ground somewhere Jeremiah 31:31 behold the days come say the Lord I will make a New Covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah notice House of Israel and house of Judah God is still talking north south at this point the two kingdoms The Divided kingdoms not according to the Covenant that I made with their fathers in the day that I took them by the hand you see how God sees it God say he took them by the hand and guide them out you know and you think well I overcame you know I I um I accomplish and and God saying that if I didn't hold you and guide you you not make it look how God sees it I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt which my Covenant they break although I was an husband unto them sayth the Lord you know what that means a husband mean are taking care of your needs whatever you ask for you get it you want grocery you get your grocery you PL top the house you tank youant on top the tank you on top the tank you want garden with grapes you want you don't holy bre you want white bread you want gluten-free bread you want whatever you want the husband but pun say move on you see is when is when they say move on you have to stay there it's when they say move on is to you have to you have to abide hold your ground there go I was a husband to them where they ask for food I give them Mana they ask for I give them water they were sick I give them doctor I hold your hand you didn't have to you didn't know have to walk by yourself although I was a husband to them say the Lord but the punch I I'll I'll move on but this shall be the Covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days said the Lord I will put my law in their inward paths in other words it's not going to be on the outside not in no book no more they will not to go and find the book like Josiah no more I will put I singular personal pronoun will do it myself I will put my law in their inward parts and write it in their hearts you can't lose it no more the oh come on now the book car go missing because it's written in your heart this is a new [Applause] covenant and will be their God and they shall be my people can the church say amen [Music] glory so I want you to see now this is Jeremiah's prophecy see his message is connecting to the suffering Ministry that Isaiah preached about to a change that is to come to a Messianic order that have to come and and and and and and Jeremiah picks it up meanwhile in bondage with the cence in captivity Ezekiel day oh God me Lord why I in budget I'm a prophet why you let it take me why didn't that's not how Ezekiel was I just love how God and and and and it's not these bir dinner the struggles you know in the middle woo but the punch like you want to help me this morning the scripture you read there Ezekiel 1 now it came to pass in the 30th year in the fourth month in the fifth day of the month as I was among the captives he complaining about being among the captives he said I was among the captives by the river of Chiba that the heavens were opened oh God for the heaven to open up in the midst of my captive circumstance in the midst of my situation that I can't understand in the midst of my turmoil my distress my pain my suffering oh if the heaven would open up for me and that is what Ezekiel experien and I saw visions of God verse three and the word of the Lord came expressly un [Music] Ezekiel let's go to Ezekiel 37 familiar St I know you know these things but I want you to see the picture now brother the C Jeremiah is in his position Ezekiel is in his position Daniel is coming into position and God just like now the holy spirit is setting in order the coming of the Lord he need Jeremiah where he's at he need Ezekiel to minister to those in Exile he need Daniel to be in the palace because Daniel have a part to play in this unfolding [Music] mystery in the midst of Exile Ezekiel is saying the hand of the Lord was upon me and carried me out in the spirit of the Lord and set me down in the midst of the valley which is full of Bones and caused me to pass by them round about and behold there were very many in the open Valley and lo they were very dry and he said unto me son of man in other words Prophet you are Prophet just like the other prophets can these bones live and I answered oh Lord God thou knowest no I want you to see the context a man in prison a man in Exile he's being challenged in the midst of your prison is there hope is there Resurrection is there restoration is there Redemption is there hope is there a possibility again he said unto me prophesy upon these bones and say to them oh ye Dry Bones hear the word of the Lord thus say the Lord God unto these bones behold I will cause bread to enter into you and you shall live and I will lay sin news upon you and will bring up flesh upon you and cover you with skin and put breath in you God is telling him listen it might look bad Jerusalem might be becoming desolate the temple might be in Ruins but I will restore say the Lord all the years of the cankerworm and the caterpillar and the Locust and the Palmer wor I will restore I will restore I will restore and ye shall live and ye shall know that I am the Lord so I prophesied as I was commanded and as I prophesied there was a noise and behold a shaking and the bones came together a bone to his bone it was not restoration it wasn't a oh come on now it wasn't a a happening in secret no there was a noise there was a shaking may this morning we have a noise and may we have a shaking as bone come together to bone as the pieces of your life begin to come back together if you are in Exile this morning this word is for you if you are in bondage this morning may the words of Ezekiel speak to your heart if you are in sin this morning may the words of Jeremiah call upon you to repent unto [Applause] God and when I beheld lo the senu and the flesh came up upon them and the skin covered them above but there was no breath in them then he said unto me prophesy unto the wind prophesy son of man and say to the wind thus sayth the Lord God come from the for winds o breath and breathe upon the slain that they may live so I prophesied as he commanded me and the breath came into them and they lived and stood up upon their feet an exceeding great Army then he said unto me son of man listen now to the context of it go we preach this message but I want you to see the context of a man in Exile Hallelujah Jerusalem is in ruin Israel has been in bondage for years under the Assyrians the Babylonians would take them over so now we give the context of this then he said unto me son of man these bones are the whole house of Israel behold they say our bones are dried and our hope is lost we are cut off for our paths therefore prophesy and sayto them thus sayth the Lord God behold oh my people I will open your Graves and cause you to come up out of your Graves and bring you into the land of Israel and ye shall know that I am the Lord when I have opened your Graves oh my people and brought you up out of your Graves and shall put my spirit in you and he shall live and I shall place you in your own land then shall ye know that I the Lord have spoken it and performed it sayeth the Lord the word of the Lord came unto me saying moreover thou son of man take thee one stick and write upon it Hallelujah listen for Judah and for the children of Israel his companions then take another stick and write upon it for Joseph The Stick of Ephraim and for all the house of Israel his companions and join them one to another into one stick and they shall become one in thine hand and when the children of thy people shall speak unto thee saying will thou not show us what thou meanest by these say unto them thus sayeth the Lord God behold I will take the Stick of Joseph which is in the hand of Ephraim and the tribe of Israel his fellows and will put them with him even with the Stick of Judah what is it God restoring the two kingdoms this problem that started centuries before that divided north and south after Ezekiel passing the battle after Jeremiah passing the battle to Ezekiel Ezekiel is saying the mission of Jeremiah is finished now now e saying let's unite north and south and make them one stick and they shall be one in mine hand and the sticks whereon thou rightest shall be in thine hand before their eyes and say unto them thus sayth the Lord God behold I will take the children of Israel from among the Heathen whether they be gone I will gather them on every side and bring them into their own land and I will make them one nation in the land upon the mountains of Israel and one King shall be king to them all and they shall no more two be there shall be no more two kingdoms neither shall be divided into two kingdoms anymore at [Music] all so what is it through all this God is unfolding the restoration of his people you know what man destroyed man destroyed the throne man destroyed the kingdom and God is saying through this whole journey here I'm showing you that I'm working a plan of restoration to unite north and south to unite brothers who were Shak hand in a long time to unite brothers who preach different Doctrine because they didn't want the other one to be in the temple with the other one because that how the problem start I'm going to die the Lord will do it I had to send them into Graves so I could pick up the pieces myself because I can't leave man to do this thing this Unity will not be a man-made Unity this Unity will not be a Unity by agreement a Unity by convention a Unity by Arrangement it will be thus sayeth the Lord I myself will do oh come on now and it goes on neither shall they defile themselves anymore with their Idols nor with their detestable things nor with any of their transgression but I will save them out of all their Dwelling Places wherein they have sinned and will cleanse them so shall they be my people and I will be their God and listen to him now now David dead years ago and David my servant shall be king over them who who you talking about there now how about King Jesus King Jesus shall be king over them and they shall have they shall all have one Shepherd talking about the great Shepherd and they shall also walk in my judgments and observe my statutes and do them and they shall dwell in the land that I have given unto Jacob my son servant wherein your fathers have dwelt and they shall dwell there and even they and their children and their children children forever and my servant David shall be their prince forever moreover I will make a covenant of peace with them it shall be an Everlasting Covenant with them and I will place them and multiply them and will set my sanctuary in the midst of them forever more my Tabernacle also shall be with them yeah I will be their God and they shall be my people and the Heathen shall know that I am the Lord that I the Lord do sanctify Israel When My Sanctuary shall be in the midst of them forever may the Lord bless his word can the church say Amen what does just show us in the midst of the Exile God is moving things around to do what he spoke to Jeremiah about these broken systems these man-made agendas these man-made Creeds this man-made separation this manade made two Kingdom it was manmade the split of the kingdom was man it was man who caused all his problem you know the whole problem is and this is this is this is so I not preaching about Jeremiah preaching about now time you know if you're just a little spiritual you'll see it to know is man is the problem and God is saying I not putting no man on no throne and putting no man to run is King David is only David is King there's only one king no Pastor is King no Prophet is King no Apostle is King no fivefold Ministry is King it's just one king and his name is Jesus he's the son of David he's the one who is legally authorized to sit on the throne of David have the Key of David can the Church Say [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Amen so what we are trying to connect here friends as I'm getting ready I'm getting ready to wind down this thing I leave out quite a bit we have to there's some things in here we we need to unpack at in another time it'll just be too much for this service but I want you to appreciate from my title as I pull it together this is Jeremiah's prophetic Bridge so Jeremiah was a bridge between the last great major prophet Isaiah who was there to see the kingdoms in operation to the want to bridge into the ministry of Ezekiel andto Daniel and I'm showing you here that there was a period of around 10 years when Jeremiah Ezekiel and Daniel they all on the Earth all playing their part in this great drama this unfolding Plan of Redemption that God is doing and the reality is by the time we reach here now to Daniel as B said it this morning that Daniel was reading books from Jeremiah he had a quotes he fellowshipping on the revealed word because the word only come to the prophet and if you have the word of the Prophet then it could rest your your your your whole message on the word of the Prophet can the church say Amen so now we find now in this whole plan there's nothing in it that God don't want to change because he already see this thing play out yes I was preaching in Germany I said in God's mind golad was already dead you know David was just there to make the tape play for us in God mind Goliath done head rolling and things like okay pause pause rewind rewind David now reach let me watch it in real time he said don't go too far ahead I a teacher say don't go to don't go too far ahead the class let me let me all this this service already in God Mighty service done listen you know God already see you adopted in God's tape you done listen you done overcome all them lust and them them thing that stressing you out you mash them already you know all them little demons that in God's tape that's why he could you said who we phone we call you Call justify already glorify you there fighting up it's past tense to God God already at your tape your name there your your seat your how you walking on go you raining on the Earth all that already play out and he say oh gosh why did you hurry up and do the thing faster because it's your promise you buil for it you designed for it you're not from this world you're creature of eternity trapped in time to just express the thoughts of God in your day and in your season is this helping anybody this [Applause] morning I'm getting ready to close out just a little teaching little Sunday school Sunday school message so now Daniel how to have to finish his part now here now because God was here contending but the George for his throne he wiped out man from his throne amen no Israel was never to have a king in the first place it was man's idea to put a king but God always wanted a throne so the throne was already planned there's a quote where brother brandham said it's a serious quote that the devil was was in heaven and the devil knew things in them and the devil tried to kind of because of he knew you think try to kind of go around the plan of God we'll get into that in the next message to see how he could he he know kingship come in he know rulership he understand jurisdiction he knew that a man had to sit and and and this Earth belongs to man and he understood these things so the devil is who choke the people get a king get a king get a king to try to to kind of Sidetrack the plan of God but you can't Sidetrack the plan of God God allow that whole thing to play out because the ambition of man existed before that King come the ambition of man goes all the way back to Genesis to the Tower of Babel with man wanted to rule over himself and live in heaven and re on the earth and all that stuff God already see the Affairs of man back to the days of Noah he said every was it was just filthy in in man's heart evil was in his heart continually so God allowed the Throne of Judah the Throne of David the king seat in Jerusalem to be empty Jerusalem becomes desolate broken down we did the study of Nehemiah because nemiah will come afterwards to rebuild the walls so we did I want to see the connected pieces but nobody was ever called King after King that last king in Judah there was no King ever came after that King so Jeremiah stood and watched the last king another way the title say the last king of Judah because after that King Jeremiah stood and witness fall no other king sat on the throne but when Jesus walked the Earth those who were spiritual Hallelujah son of David Hallelujah this looking like one who could sit in a throne and we it's been a while we're looking for but he's also son of man he's also he's saw that this is the lion of the tribe of Judah is that a see son of David Son of son of Abraham son of Son of Man Son of God everything wrapped up because Christ was the mystery of God revealed what was hidden in Jeremiah and Moses and in every age was captured in that man called [Applause] Jesus and a consistent message Jesus preached was the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand he didn't say a church is at hand no he said the kingdom is at hand because he came to introduce a kingdom establish a kingdom a kingdom that couldn't be moved a kingdom that couldn't be [Applause] destroyed so Jeremiah is there on the earth and a young boy named Daniel is being led away in the first Exile Ezekiel is still in Jerusalem but Young Daniel is head down to Babylon for three years he is eating good food for three years he's learning the language of the Chans for three years his intellectual aptitude his political Acumen his economic fortitude and his management ability distinguishes him from all the young men of his day it allows him access because of his nature his intelligence his character and his lineage to walk into the courts of Nebuchadnezzar and attract the attention of royalty in so much that when he Nez has a dream he say I will chop off people head here today if only at what going on because this thing stress him out I sleeping with this thing and Daniel S the Lord concerning the matterall and Daniel goes now this is the last piece of this puzzle between Jeremiah Ezekiel Daniel started with Isaiah about his restoration because Samuel was the one who was there who started the kingship unwillingly but Isaiah was speaking now of a king that would come a messiah that would come a virgin that would keep he's hinting at it he's hinting at it just the king kingship but not the kingdom yet Jeremiah whatt this is the fall of the Kingdom Ezekiel speaking to the people not preparing them for a kingdom to come a kingdom to have a new law and a new covenant and Daniel is there now trying to pill the pieces together in Daniel 2:31 and he begins to speak about this image Daniel 2:31 thou oh King sawest and behold a great image this great image whose brightness was excellent stood before thee and the form thereof was terrible this image's head was a fine gold his breast and his arms of silver his belly and his thighs of brass his legs of iron his feet part of iron and part of clay thou sawest that till a stone was cut out without hands which SM the image upon his feet that were of iron and clay and break them to Pieces then was the iron the clay the brass the silver and the gold broken into pieces together and became like the chaff of the summer trashing floors and the wind carried them away that no place was found for them and the stone that smed the image became a great mountain and filled the whole earth this is the dream and we will tell the interpretation thereof before the king thou oh king art a king of kings notice the lowercase King of Kings for the god of Heaven listen ha given thee a kingdom because when you read Jeremiah the Lord through Jeremiah speaks of my servant Nebuchadnezzar just like where the terrant would have spoken my servant Cyrus God used these men to help address the agenda of God's kingdom being established God allowed man Kingdom to rise so he could cut it down so he said thou oh King at King of Kings for the god of Heaven had given thee a kingdom power and strength and glory amen so this head of gold had to be established for this to be the head of gold Israel had to be captured they had to be subjected they had to be in Babylon there couldn't be another Kingdom operating in that way to challenge his headship of gold this is why jermiah would tell the Kings listen surrender let we behave yourself because this is God's plan you might understand it now but God want you to go through this purification this process can the church say amen and wheresoever the children of men dwell the Beast of the field and the fowls of the heaven had he given into thine hand and had made the ruler over them all thou art this head of gold and after the shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee and another third Kingdom of brass which shall bear rule over all the earth and the fourth Kingdom shall be strong as iron for as much as iron breaking in pieces and subdueth all things and as iron that break it all these shall it break into pieces and bruise and whereas thou so is the feet and toast part of clay and part of iron the kingdom shall be divided that that that there shall be in it of the strength of the iron for as much as thou sawest the iron mixed with Mary clay and as the toes of the feet were part of iron and part of clay so the kingdom shall be partly strong and partly broken and whereas thou sawest iron mixed with Mary clay they shall mingle themselves with the seed of men but they shall not cleave one to another even as iron is not mixed with clay and in the days of these Kings shall the god of Heaven set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed and the kingdom shall shall not be left to other people but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms and it shall stand forever for as much as thou saw that that stone was cut out of the mountain without hands and that it break in pieces the iron the brass the clay the silver and the gold the great God had made known to the king what shall come to pass Hereafter and the dream is certain and the interpretation thereof sure then the King Nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face and worshiped Daniel and commanded that they should offer an oblation and sweet orders unto him the king answered unto Daniel and said offer truth it is that your God is a god of gods that's the best thing he could describe because he can't he had no other words to he said this God is a different God this had to be the god of gods and a lord of kings and a revealer of Secrets seeing thou couldest reveal his secret then the king made Daniel a great man and gave him many great gifts and made him ruler over the whole province of Babylon and chief of the governors over all the wise men of Babylon this is in the Captivity here and then Daniel requested of the king and he said Shadrach mesach and Abednego over the Affairs of the province of Babylon but Daniel sat in the gate of the king so I was there read I say look look how God is good Jeremiah on the earth Ezekiel on the earth Daniel even Shad Mish and all there at the same time this whole thing is unfolding God's Plan of Redemption his plan of getting back on the throne his plan of establishing a kingdom God speaking about the the Babylonians giving away to the Ms and the Persians the Greeks on to the Romans military Rome again spiritual Rome the whole plan and then that stone cut without the hands of man striking the image a kingdom that cannot be moved a throne that will have his rightful King on the throne King Jesus that a king that will be established forever how happy ought we to be that we are part of the citizenry of that Kingdom that we are part of the economy of that Kingdom that we are royal members of that Kingdom and because there's a king of kings we could be king priests royal priesthood because the king priest sits on the throne can the church say Amen I'm finished this morning musician get ready I trust you're feeling fine this morning to know that his great plan of God that he started way back when man fell in Genesis every mistake that man made every fall that man made God saw it all and he put provision in place and he sent prophets through the book of Jeremiah he speak I've sent prophets unto the people I've told them to repent I want them to get back in line with God but I need to give them a new covenant I need to give them a new heart because their own labors and their efforts would never do it but if they come unto me all who are heavy laden I will give them rest I will take them mour and I'll give them gladness I will take their weeping and I'll give them Joy I will take their Stony heart and give them a heart of Flesh and I put my spirit in there and I will oh come on now church it's your
