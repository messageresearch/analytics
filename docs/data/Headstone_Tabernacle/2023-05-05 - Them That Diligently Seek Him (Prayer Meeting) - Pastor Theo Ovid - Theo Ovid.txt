I want to read verse one to six you appreciate your service on Wednesday night the god of testimony appreciate that for Anthony to your testimony God get glory to your testimony goal expresses himself you have to have a testimony The Voice so Hebrews chapter 11. the reason from verse one now Faith is a substance of things will form evidence of Things Not Seen before through faith we understand that the world's refrained by the word of God so that things which are seen are not made of things we should work with you by faith evil offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than King which he obtained witnessed and he was righteous God testify other skills the diet he being dead yet speaking by faith Enoch was translated that he should not see that was not formed because God had translated before before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased God are without faith it's impossible to please him for he that coming to God must believe that he is one two he is rewarder of them that division please seek him and that is where I want to take a thought tonight them that brilliantly Seeker God bless you amen now it is not a man to seek the Lord just want to get up straight off it is not something that we wake up and want to seek the Lord is not a man to seek the Lord Jeremiah 79 and brother Isaac but he quoted it the heart is deceitful above all right the God knows the heart born in censorship iniquity whether you are seed or whatever but the condition that we are in the Bible said is non-righteous Mark 7 a couple of scriptures read and just to bring all this point tonight Mark 7 verse 5 says then the Pharisees inscribe African why what not that disciples according to the tradition of the elders but he's bread with unwashing handles he answers to them well you Hypocrites has written the people honored me with their lips but the heart is far from me but for example spoken about this be very respond to God albeit in vain do they worship me teaching for Doctrine the Commandments of men ify the Commandment of God he holded the tradition of men as of Washington up some many other so Jesus identifying the external things that they're trying to see what why those guys not doing like what we do he said well full well you reject the Commandment of God that he may keep your own tradition for movies he said no okay Silver City making the word of God of non-effectual your tradition which you have delivered and many such like things you do and when you call all the people under him he said happen unto me every one of you and understand there is nothing from without a man that entering into him can Define him but the things which come out of him those are thee that defile the man If any man out there stay here and walk away I didn't know so Jesus just give them that new explanation verse 17 and when he was entered into the house from the people his disciples asked him considering the parable he says will you not perceive that the whatever things from without anything to the man it cannot Define because it entered not in his heart but into his belly and going out to the drought put in all meat he said that which comes out of the man that be found so from within out of the heart of men to see the inventors adulteries fornications murders thefts Consciousness wickedness deceit lasciviousness and evil eye blasphemy Pride foolishness all these evil things 65 now listen to this verse 21 and so on in the amplifier for from within that is out of the hearts of men on base and Wicked on sexual immorality stealing Buddha adultery competence dangerous and destructive wickedness deceit unrestrained in decent conduct an evil eye Envy slander Eva speaking malicious misrepresentation abusiveness Pride the sin of an uplifted heart against God and man foolishness fully lack of sense recklessness recklessness and thoughtless all these evil purposes and desires come from within and they make the man unclean and rendered him so then you see clearly that external performance and Impressions whether long dress or straight time and jacket doesn't impress God what God really want to see is what's in that huh today is non-naturalistic after God must believe he is and he's reward of them that them that are hoping that we all hear Englishman tonight will be part of this damn that diligently seeking Romans 3 the Lord speaks in verse 10. others is written there is non-righteous you see them there is none that understand that there is none that seek it after God they are all gone out of the way they are all together become unprofitable there is none that could do not the truth is it oh it's not us under their lips so therefore from man to be in a position who even have a desire or to seek after God something have to happen within the heart of man to give him that desire no wonder he offered a new heart the new spirit no we this old man seek after things we seek success we seek film we seek Fortune we speak respects we seek happiness we seek fulfillment we seek after World Pleasures we seek the best for our family but we don't seek him or seek after him now seek is an active woman I like that song that by Anthony sang take up your cross and follow Jesus now what it is today in religion or religious people just go to church they go decision here trying to leave they're going to say something by going to the church to give them an entitlement to this thing called The Kingdom or this thing called the program of God or whatever but that is not what that song strikes take up your cross and follow you have something to do would you take up the cross and the next thing you have to follow it across so therefore we the seek and the dictionary say is the attempt to find something attempt or desire to obtain or achieve something or ask for something from someone seek him is not passive seek him is active and you hear it in those words that we are echoing from verse 6 of Hebrews 11 he said coming to God must believe that he is and he is a rewarder of them that diligently or enthusiastically or excitedly watch this I'm Luke chapter 19. verse 8. and Zacchaeus stood and said unto the Lord be who Lord the half of my goods I give to the poor and if I have taken anything from any man by false application I restored forth Jesus said unto him this deed is salvation come to this house for so much as he also is a son of Abraham Christian for a son of man is come to seek and deceased that which was lost for succumbed to seek to deceive that which was lost so the truth is it is God who have been seeking us I want you to think about that tonight I don't think that it seems that we know but because whether or not this register is not you seeking a new after oh God is the one that have been seeking after us Ezekiel 34 12. it says as a Shepherd seek it out his flop in the day that he is Among Us so I support my sheep so I will seek out my sheep I will deliver them out of all places where they have been scattered in the cloud you got me so God is seeking at least one of us to seek after him why do we need to seek the Lord I remember I'm not talking about going to church I'm in a message we're not talking about talk we're talking about this scripture here this week he said give me a box of it give me a family give me a preacher whatever any man that will put God first I will show you some body that is successful despite what everybody could do why do we need to seek the Lord Crosby backslide we sin ful we get cool let me read something for you but I'm talking about the question and answers there's some questions you feel the third of January 1954. I don't know on blackstriden he said somebody said but saying that you were baptized in Christian baptism at the age of 13. if you have a Christian Life all the way along if you backstabbed a few times I don't know is on the backside I wish somebody would would ask me that but on Friday remember your backslide every day there's no way at all for you to keep hold of it all right but you backside to the people in the church but not before God see you backslide on Christ but not don't thank God cause if you sin you're gone but you're constantly Fallen Paul had to die every day is that right you have to die every day repent every day and just constantly repented all the time and if Paul had to do that then I'm going to have to do it February 9th uh 19. environment is lukewarm condition died in the United States now here comes jehuram and just like him apart is jerusal Father righteous man and fire for God growing up with his lukewarm man listen this one it's a problem a lukewarm believer is worse than an infidel ity but you see these things I'm reading you know I wonder they really believe that because if they really believe that you are concentrate that you can't stay in this dead natural you can't stay there you have to say Lord I am in your apartment tonight you can't even wait for something you you can't even wait for that you need that tonight so therefore you should be encouraged to truly seek after the Lord let me read that again like something good to read he says a lukewarm believer is worse than an infidel God glory in the dead but every man will either be a Christian or a sinner and stay the same he said every one of you know someday you'll be calling a pile of bones laying underneath somebody's clear around here just as sure as you are sitting here tonight you're heading towards that houses here should you be there you know what I mean maybe you might start in an hour from now this time next year there may not even be a piece of Flesh on your bones in the next 12 months they may even not be a speck of life in your body in the next 25 minutes and then from that time till endless ages cease to be will never be the state you are in now that state will be forever tonight and those that were here right the church on Sunday if you are lukewarm brother that is dangerous please for you to start it's a lukewarm condition Jesus said either you be hot or cold either we meet with me before me with all your heart will be against me if you just live a pretty good life that will never count put in political life your self-righteous rugs will never stand in the day of judgment that's right okay so let's continue Psalms 105 so it's for said seek the Lord no no seek the Lord oh nicely pasta no he didn't feel that here seek the Lord I saw them in the street no no seek the Lord and his strength seek his faith come on Psalms 24 6 this is the generation of them that seek him that seek thy face o Jacob seller to seek the Lord is the seek his presence this thief Seekers protection seek his kingdom seek His blessings seek his forgiveness seek is Mercy seek is wisdom is wisdom yes do we need it yes James 1 5 says if any of you lack wisdom let the marks I'll go give it all men liberally and read it not and it shall be given him wisdom is something we need is our wisdom with our wives our family our business our neighbors this is cool Proverbs 13 3 happy is the man that finds wisdom reverse four five get wisdom that understanding forget it not for the decline from the goods we need wisdom to know when to stand and when to run some people foolishly just stand up when they're supposed to run you know when they run Joseph when potipheral rice make his a move he ran he gets out of that scenario sometimes that is wisdom to know when to run when to start psalms 27 1 the Lord is my light and my salvation who shall I fail the Lord is the strength of my life it's seven yeah oh Lord when I cry with my voice when those years like you see in tonight when those tears are really home this time seeking my face my heart is are you saying that tonight or is it just the words you just get an exhortation and you know about all which are speaking some words or this is going to be real to you when those fear this is the sound is David in Psalms 27 verse 8 when though see us seek ye by Feast like heart said unto thee thy face Lord blessing you know some people are talking about you wake up and alone as if they are in the passive and they expect God to predict active and they're waiting for God to make a move if you're looking for a sign and you're looking for a signal you're looking for a rainbow you can find light you're looking if I miss looking for some kind of thing somebody to call you tell you whatever it is and he said you six 31 says therefore do not worry and be accessing what are we going to eat what are we going to have to drink or what are we going to wear for the Gentiles the heathens wish for and seek those things honestly I'm obviously Amplified I was a publication but seek in our life after first of all his kingdom this is the Amplified and his righteousness his way of doing and being right and then all these things taken together will begin to you besides do not worry or be anxious about tomorrow more worries and exactly of his own sufficient but each day wow and that's it I'm almost done here now can we come back to the the oriented we read foreign testimony she said beloved she know how she lives and how what she reflected and everything else and she is so thirsty forgotten now that she doesn't care what anybody think what anybody see personally because you see people talk about this one talking about me and I've seen it so I feel so forget it that person in a condition in a condition when you just still think about what others think because this sister she says she says that I'm so tasty all I want is water I brought around first I talk about this man was fruit tasty I want water and they keep postponing the postpone it and one time when he saw some water in some green or something like that he just drop off the car and run and drink the water he was so painful just to me is when you alligators pack the tooth for life you begin to act you don't care what the neighbors say what people say or do about your sin and how you fell and how you're feeling all your fault that becoming relevant doesn't matter doesn't matter if you want to do well she uh her life was just me and that way anybody could know about her life of course when Jesus freed her she could run with that Liberty and say come see him I'm gonna close no he didn't commit to God he'd pick up his cross follow us and this ties in with Jesus said the gospel is preached since that time and and the customers preach and every man pressed their way into the kingdom of God you don't hear much about that you get people going to church and he passes a nice man and he has Christmas trees and Revelation stuff but the reality is is a kingdom that you have to enter it it's a place to get to Abraham his whole effort and testimony was seeking a city who's making the less God he wasn't saying well you know what bless me recall me elected quarter note out of his coming to go among strangers to go and journey towards a city which they can tell there's God so right after verse 6 here in Hebrews hear the action by Faith No in one of God of things that he moved here prepared and out he didn't say Noah make a nice wooden new bench and he sucked uncomfortable to hear God's voice as I said already all the Hallelujah glory and you shout and dance and think that when you sweep your house that wouldn't take your bills in other words you still have to go to work you still have to do your stuff God expects that that's why you put man on Earth to tell his soil to work watch this now by feet Stephen Ark to deceiving of his house by the which he condemned the world I feed Abraham but he was called to go to the place which he should have receive inheritance Obed act he went out not ruined whether he went by faith he's a journal and the promise not the last three in the country well and then Tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob the ears with him of the same promise for you look for city which had foundations with Builders and makers God through faith also Sarah receive strength to conceive seed and was delivered of a child when she was passed age because she judged him faithful who had promised it was right there friends to me in this realm of the spirit the spirit realm like I said there is a waking up call going out to people some are snoring in church some are the only dull the Bible talk about done and hearing darling darling understanding these people their eyes are down their ears a doll of hearing they hear so much that they get dull in their senses who gonna wake them up God help us tonight foreign attitude uh have all desire let's call it a passion a passion to seek God face not just anytime but this sickness thesis take in time this can't do it tonight this half an hour is 45 minutes but but we're talking about we're planting a seizure tonight and putting a seed here some beauty tonight that you have to know in your heart you have the secret face when David in Ziegler him and meet all his wife sticking away and then we lost their wives and people got upset and angry what did they do should we went into the temple take up the effort seek the Lord is when making the with men outside waiting to drop down on them they call their Vex because it's fighting for the Lord and no they expect God bless them all around them but Siegler was success what did David do David went and said God what do I do do I pursue not difficult no no no no no God said you pursue and I'll be with you and give it and you'll restore you'll get back all that you lost whatever did write hard whole night and that is desperation are you desperate do you want God to create this desperation in you that is heavenly father I thank you for this word tonight I believe it's from you it's from your word from your scripture you don't have to learn about it it is your desire is supposed to seek your face you said ask it shall be given sick and you shall find knock in the door shall be open okay everyone that asked him everyone that seeking everyone that knock it
