bless you and welcome we want want to bhe heads just get his prayer request please remember me in prayer I'm experiencing body chills and fever this is from brother Michael Blackman let us bhead once more Heavenly Father we bring your son and servant to you by the black man Lord that you would visit him and touch him from the crown of his head to the sore of his feet he had Faith to reach out to believe and the Saints in praying that you would hear an answer because you work through prayer Lord you use prayer as a tool Lord as this is part of the Christian armor this thing called prayer and we bring him before you and every sick person that may be in our midst and may you touch them and heal them in Jesus name I ask it amen and amen God bless you and thanks again for being here and we going to start tonight and we looking to see what the Lord will do among us as the meeting comes up we want to be praying that the hand of God will be upon us in everything that we do because God have to find a people what have to find people that be praying people that you could use and so on and you know like when they come to church you have to believe that in that service that the man of God that will step forward to speak that God will speak through him if we don't have the faith and confidence that God will do that then we like we're wasting our time we have to have confidence that this God and I always say some recently about what BR talk about he knows when every fly bat his eye and when you think about it he knows everything and I sharing with brother Clarence I believe yes by Clarance that God is omnipotent and he's omnicient so he knows all things Satan doesn't know all things so I was telling by the Clarance that Satan was waiting for this technological Advanced uh uh age that they could have all these systems and all these things to get information personal information total knowledge through technology it's really the god of knowledge the God of this evil age the prince of the power of the air this is what is happening he needs this technological advancement to pursue his agenda we on the other hand are challenged to our hearts to turned back to the fate of the fathers because no technology could defeat the real fate of our fathers when Peter was in prison the church went into desperate prayer and God opened up the prison and let Peter out in so much that when Peter appeared they say it it was his Angel it was so as such astonishment to know that the church no Peter couldn't get himself out but prayer could have and this is what I want you to see tonight the power of a believing Church The Power of a Praying Church The Power of a Praying people the power of praying individuals so I just want to go into scriptures tonight from Ephesians 6 familiar scripture verse 10 are we going to read finally my brethren we read that on Wednesday night be strong in the Lord and the power of His might put on the whole armor of God that you may able to stand against the Wes of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against Powers against rulers of Darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness and high places wherefore take unto you the whole armor of God that you may be able to withand in the evil day having done all to stand stand therefore having your loins good about with truth having on the breastplate of righteousness your feet shut with the preparation of the gospel of peace above all taking the shield of Faith whereit he shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked and take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit which is the word of God note that there is no protection for the back you have a breastplate of righteousness but your back is not protected there's no protection for the back and that is why we should stand back to back with one another you look out for me and I look out for you but this is the verse we want to get on to tonight Verse 18 praying always with all prayer and supplications in the spirit and watching there unto with all perseverance and supplication for All Saints ver 19 and for me so imagine this Paul is asking for prayer what for and for me that utterance may be given unto me that I may open my mouth boldly to make known The Mystery of the gospel for which I am an ambassador in bonds and therein I may speak boldly as I ought to speak now let me say this here I sent a note out from the pastor's desk and this week and I was sharing about the Believers that will be coming from different parts to this convention I believe we have two people coming as far as Australia to come to Trinidad for these meetings um those who choose to come make serious personal sacrifices not just in the distance to come here but even financially they are making a sacrifice to come here we are expected each one to make a sacrifice and if you don't something not clicking right because they are making a sacrifice because they believe they are coming and it is a it's it's going to give them a breakthrough a blessing a turn a change they come in because they they they are hungering and tasting not that we have something but that together this could be a bonfire a transformational bonfire that will change the course of things but R we know that the Holy Ghost will go across the world overnight what we don't know is where and when it will start we don't know and we cannot declare God's season by faith we could say stuff and say things but God is the one who interprets seasons and times that is what and there's a time for the the lingering time there's a time for mechanics there'll be a time for Dynamics there a time for word seed there a time for rain Spirit water so we have to move in God's timing now Faith works with patience for the promise to be confirmed real faith is never frustrated real faith is never depressed in that sense because Faith knows that God can't lie so you could rest your Hope on what God have said so let's continue so I say I want to drop that in about the Believers coming in all right now this text that we read about praying always with all prayer and supplication in the spirit you know I never really focused on this testament which Focus tonight and in the Amplified it says pray at all times so this is a charge to prayer all times but let's go further in it pray at all times on every occasion in every season in other words prayer don't have nothing to do with summer autumn winter spring no season no change prayer is prayer Pray at all times on every occasion in every season in the spirit listen with all manner of prayer and and entreaty I want you to underline that all manner of prayer and entreaty to that end keep alert and watch with strong purpose and perseverance interceding in behalf of All Saints God consecrated people and pray also for me that freedom of utterance may be given me that I may open my mouth to proclaim the mystery of the good news of the gospel and in that light I want you to pray not just only for Sunday service that's coming but pray for the convention that will be coming up at the end of this week next week that God would give the ministers all who would speak all who would greet all who will testify that his spirit will come upon their mouths and they will speak on behalf of God and speak Spirit spoken word to God's people utterance that be given not only just utterance but at the pillar of Fire rest on their shoulder and God by his Spirit could speak right out this is what I want you to have in your heart as praying tonight all right all manner of prayer and ENT treaty prayer is of various kinds I want you to note this tonight it have prayer of confession it have formal prayer it have prayer of Deliverance it have silent prayer it have vocal prayer it have public petitionary prayer supplication desperation inter and I want to just go a few tonight under intercession this is how Moses in Exodus 32 intered for Israel after the made the golden calf and this is verse 11 and Moses besought the Lord his God and said the people misbehaving the people kind out with their foolishness and here Moses picture here is Moses attitude and Moses besought the Lord his God and said Lord why do thy wrath wax F against thy people which had thou has brought forth out of the land of Egypt with great power and with a mighty hand wherefore should the Egyptian speak and say for Mischief did he bring them out to slay them in the mountains and to consume them from the face of the Earth turn from thy Fierce wrath and repent of this evil against thy people could you imagine Moses asking go to repent verse 13 He said remember Abraham Isaac and Israel thy servants to whom thou swearest by thine own self and say unto them I will multiply your seed as the stars of heaven and all this land that I have spoken of will I give unto your seed and they shall inherit it forever and verse 14 stunning verse and the Lord repented of the evil that he taught to do unto his people I want you to take that caption as how you could see praying with all supplication and interceding on behalf of the Saints there are great needs among us there are great conditions among us there are great issues and challenges in homes and families Among Us you can't just pray for yourself you just can't pray for your story there are others and I pray God that God lay upon your heart to pray for others if you don't remember who to pray for look where they have participants here tonight and just pick any name and pray for them look at any name you see there you might even met the person know the person but say Lord that name that that that representation there are bringing them before you are crying out unto you Lord that is what I want you to do tonight let's continue this is Samuel Samuel 1 Samuel 7 5-9 and here what it says and Samuel said gather all Israel to mispe and I will pray for you unto the Lord and they gather together misp and Drew water and poured it upon the Lord and fasted that day and said we have sinned against the Lord and Samuel judged the children of Israel in misp and when the Philistines heard that the children of Israel were gathered together to misp the Lords of the Philistine went up against Israel and when the children of Israel heard it they were afraid of the Philistine now listen to verse 8 and the children of Israel set to Samuel cease not to cry unto the Lord Our God for us that he will save us out of the hand of the Philistines here the climax in verse 9 and Samuel took a suckling lamb offered it for a burnt offering holy unto the Lord and Samuel Cried unto the Lord for Israel and the Lord heard him oh my this is so great tonight pressure under attack from Philistine you know you're not ready for that battle you know you will get lick up but here it is somebody could stand in the Gap and pray note the attitude of the children of Israel at that time they said Don't Stop Don't Stop you talk to God on our behalf and the Bible said God heard Samuel oh just a few more I we wrap up prayer of confession Psalms 51 this is David said have mercy upon me oh God according to thy loving kindness according unto the multitude of thy Tender Mercies blot out my transgression Wash Me thoroughly from my iniquity and cleanse me from my sin silent prayer through Samuel 1112 to13 Hannah it came to pass as she continued praying before the Lord that the line marked her mouth now Hannah she spake in her heart only your lips smooth but her voice was not heard therefore Eli thought she had been drunken have we know the story of Hannah and Hannah persevered and pressed through and you will see Hannah prayer change from Silent prayer to a supplication before god let's continue praise the Lord s under supplication pray now 1 Samuel 1 and and she was in bitterness of soul and prayed unto the Lord and wept saw and she vowed a vow and said oh lord of hosts if thou will indeed look on the Affliction of thine handmaid and remember me and not forget thine handmade but will give unto thine handmade a man child then I will give him unto the Lord all the days of his life and there shall be no razor come to his head and we know who that was that was Samuel God bless her with a prophet all right Daniel 9 17-9 this is Daniel praying for his people now therefore oh God hear the prayer of thy servant and his supplications cause thy face to shine upon thy Sanctuary that is desolate for the Lord's sake oh my God incline th air here open Thine Eyes Behold our desolation you see there is no pretense in this prayer he's not saying I right and them wrong and whatnot and and and and trying to pretend something there is absence of pretense in Daniel he said behold our what our desolation okay and the city which is called by thy name for we do not present our supplication before thee for all righteousness but for thy great mercies oh Lord hear oh Lord forgive oh Lord hacken and do be F not for thine own sake oh my God for thy City and thy people are called by thy name let's a little more again and we close 1 Kings 8 28-30 Solomon dedic in prayer yet have thou respect unto the prayer of thy servant andto supplications oh Lord my God to Heen unto the cry to the prayer which thy servant prayed before thee today th eyes may be open towards this house night and day do you understand that as we read these scriptures as you read your own Bible and you read the scriptures you could draw from how these men pray for you to pray for you to understand how you must pray and talk to God my name you said even unto the was the place where thou said my name shall be there that thou May Heen unto the prayer which thy servant shall make toward the place and Heen thou to the supplication of thy servant and of thy People Israel when they shall pray towards this place and hear th in Heaven by thy DW in place and and when they and when th hearest forgive one more desperation we know this one 2 Kings 20 Hezekiah word come that your time is up man time to go and then Hezekiah turned in other words let's say something something confronting you and it look like if this is what is ahead of you you could actually ask God and God could change things wrong then he turned his face to the wall and prayed onto the and said I beseech thee oh God remember me how I have walked before thee in truth with a perfect heart and have done that which is good in thy sight and Hezekiah wept s and while the prophet was walking up the same Prophet had told him time up you got to go go tell that Prophet go back and tell that man your life is spared things have changed oh give the Lord some Praises tonight how many would like God to do that for you tonight for for whatever things are in front of you and God bring a word and said things have changed because of your prayer tonight and we close with this Hallelujah brother br oh we have a few more wow all right okay but BR our dear Lord Jesus himself in the world greatest Battleground Gethsemane he cried out in despair should he take the sins of the world or should he just remain on Earth and his beloved with his beloved disciples what he wanted to do but what his humility as he humbled himself not my will but thine be done humble himself to the word the promised word of God of Heaven notice he went a little further and if he went a little further how much more we to go a little further notice the scripture says in Luke he prayed earnestly brother sister if Jesus had to pray earnestly how much more have we got to pray earnestly if Christ the god of Heaven made flesh had to pray earnestly then how much more we Sinners and saved by grace pray earnestly if the decision thrown to the Son of God into the SP if it into this Spar what will it do you and I desperately we must cry we have to cry we have to ask God for our own Deliverance Matthew 6:13 and lead us not into temptation but Deliver Us from Evil for thine is the Kingdom power and the glory Philippians 4:6 in the amplifi Do Not fret or have any anxiety about anything stop freten but in every circumstance and in everything by prayer and petition which is definite request so petitioning is a is that Lord bless me Lord in Jesus name bless my family bless the house bless the car bless everything no no no petition is definite request you could write it down and you could see when you pray for it and you could see when God answer that prayer definite request with Thanksgiving continue you what the Bible says continue to make your wants known to God and 1 Timothy 21 I know we lot of scriptures tonight I exal therefore first of all supplication prayer intercession and giving of thanks be made to all men Mark 13 this is the amplifier I'm going to read be on your guard constantly alert and watch and pray for you do not know when the time will come it's like a man already going on a journey when he leaves home he puts his servants in charge each with his particular task he give orders to the doorkeeper to be constantly alert and on the watch therefore watch give strict attention be cautious and alert for you do not know when the master of the house is coming in the evening or at midnight or at cro or in the morning what I say least he comes suddenly and unexpectedly and find you asleep what I say unto you I say to everybody this is Jesus watch give strict attention be cautious active and alert and this here is the final quote I have but BR the devil took many of us captive years ago it was a sin for you woman to cut your here but today Pentecostal women look just like the women of the street you can't tell the difference that's right it used to be for a sin in the old days for women to wear makeup today you can't tell the sinner from s what's the matter back to the old human human line again back to re Pentecost back to the old Aza experience and then some of you preachers that let down the bars some of you men you know I'm ashamed of you any man that will call himself a born again child of God and will let his wife act and do the way the pente people let their Woman Act today it shows not very much man about you that's exactly the truth what we need today here we go brother brother BR speaks is a calling back to the oldfashioned baptism of the Holy Ghost and people is right back again that's the truth it may scor a little bit but I rather be scorched here than burn and this is the last part if the devil has took you captive it's Jubilee time it's time to come back to the old experience again back to the oldfashioned Bible back to the place here we go where we can feel the power of God search through that will call men and women to the altar that will make them St on their face all night long and pray to God and seek Deliverance what a time let's bow our heads Heavenly Father this is what come together to share with your people praying with all prayer all supplication all manner of prayer I trust the people grasp is not just one approach there is silent prayer there is prayer of petition there is prayer of Supplication there is prayer of intercession there's all different types Lord there's even prayer against the enemy but Lord tonight help them help them to know that God answers prayer and Prayer Changes Things Lord may it not be a phrase but may they see the reality that if Prayer Changes Things then with my words in faith to God things can change to Me In Me Through Me by me around me Lord change things tonight May a fire fall in every Home Fire Fall upon the husbands the wives the mothers the fathers the brothers the sisters the sons the daughters the children may the anointing of God come and may the angel move to the camp to put your mark to put your seal to put your token upon them granted God we know there are challenges these years ahead Lord we keep saying it and maybe because people don't see terrible things as yet they don't believe it but it will still happen because your word has declared it oh God we cannot change what is going to happen upon the Earth as I was showing my grandson Heil fallen in France about an inch tick oh God and the prophet prophesy about Heil so heavy and and and destructive going to be falling out of out of the sky floods in China floods in India floods in Switzerland floods All Around the World in South Africa God we know things are moving nature itself is rocking and rolling because something is about to break forth the sons of God is about to come forth father God bless the services coming Sunday bless the upcoming convention father anoint every Minister Lord am anoint every testimony father give them auction and inspiration to speak your word by direct inspiration and may it through it all that you may be glorified and magnified on the earth granted God and I commit this time of prayer into your hands with your people that they will each find that place whether in silent whether in desperation whether in petition whether intercession whatever all manner of prayer you exal us tonight to keep on praying to continue in in season outter season doesn't matter what the season is but
