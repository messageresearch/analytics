so much for this tremendous atmosphere that we feel in the building this morning oh praise the Lord Revelation chapter 5 and I saw on the right hand of a him that sat on the throne a book written within on the backside seal with Seven Seals and I saw a loud Angel strong Angel Proclaim with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book of and to loose the seals thereof and no man in Heaven Nor in Earth neither under the Earth was able to open the book neither to look there on and I wept much because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book neither to look thereon and one of the elders said unto me weep not behold the L of the tribe of Judah the root of David Hallelujah had prevailed to open the book and to loose the Seven Seals thereof and I beheld low in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts in the midst of the four and the elders to the lamb as it had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of God sent forth into all the Earth he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne and when he had taken the book The Four beasts the four and 20 Elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them HPS and golden vials full of odors which are the prayers of the Saints and they sung a new song saying thou worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for thou was slain and has redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every Kindred and tongue and people and Nation Revelation 8 reading verse 1-5 and when he had opened the seventh seal there was silence in heaven about a space of half an hour and I saw the seven angels which stood before God and to them were given seven trumpets and another angel came and stood at the altar having a golden sensor and there was given unto him much incense that he should offer it with the prayers of All Saints upon the golden altar which was before the throne and the smoke of the incense which came with the prayers of the Saints Hallelujah ascended up before God out of the Angel's hand and the angel took the sensor filled it with fire of the altar cast it unto the Earth and there were voices and thunderings and Lightnings and an earthquake let us pray father we thank you for your word and we pray that you would take me out of the way God made the holy spirit comeing in a special way and Lord bless those that are here bless

sit on that throne and the bride is the bride elect lady she's not on that Throne yet but that is where she is headed and right now there's a transition taking place to put you in a position of power God have to actually set you up set your mind up set the things around you up in order that you could take up your place Hallelujah don't just take up a place like that you have to be prepared for it you have to transition into it from the ministry of the word to the ministry of the spirit from now fath ears to the supernatural manifestation of all what God promised because wherever God is there is Supernatural shout Supernatural this morning shout it out again Supernatural yeah yeah yeah wherever God is there is Supernatural he's a Healer this morning he's a deliverer this morning he's a way maker this morning when your back is against the wall and it seemed like there is no way out he could remove mountains this morning oh yes that's the God we serve we serve a living one not a dead one a living one that could take care of your problem that could operate on you in your spirit and your body and your soul Hallelujah St a title this morning the breaking of Heaven's silence hallu and have an inspiration the prayer of the Saints that's my inspiration the prayer of the Saints not the prayer of the bishop not the prayer of the Pope not the prayer of the fold Hallelujah but the prayer of the there is power in the prayer that what the devil don't want you to know did you hear what I said this morning did you get that this morning there is power in your [Applause] prayer hallelujah oh give the Lord a shout in the house and there's a vile wo Hallelujah you you want to fill up that vial you want to fill that that jar that prayer jar you want to fill it up hallelujah praise God don't we worry because nothing happening that that vial in the fet right now that VI empty and so forth but you got to keep pouring keep pouring on it one day it going to be filled up and the angel going to take it and pour it upon the Earth praise God I've heard ah I've heard the cries of my people I heard I heard the groaning that they want the Holy Ghost I heard the groaning that they want the healing I heard the groaning that they want to break through you got to be groaning not complaining groaning not set up groaning not giving up [Applause] groaning hallelujah hallelujah when you groan and not complain you are saying Satan you are a liar my God is a awesome [Applause] God hallelujah hallelujah I will be delivered Hallelujah I maybe not delivered yet but I will be because he going to break that silence come on now come on now when you talk to God and call upon God and he doesn't answer that's the very hour to be certain of God to be certain he made a promise to be certain he'll confirm his word to be certain he will back it up with power to be certain he will back it up with signs wonders and miracles we are transitioning this morning oh hallelujah praise [Applause] God you may be seated have a context scripture you can find if you want it's some josha chapter 6 want to read that scripture now Jericho was stly shut up because the children of Israel none went out none came in there a tight ship shut up and the Lord said unto Joshua see I have given unto thine hand Jericho oh God it's shut up nobody coming in nobody going out and God says see I give it to you they bind it up they block it up they they they put a gate around it they put walls around it but I have given it you can't miss it because he WS bigger on it you can't miss it because a tallest thing around and it can't move right they ain't going nowhere you're going to lose them and you're going to set them free let's read on now Lord lord said see I G them unto thine hand Jericho and the King thereof and the Mighty Men of Valor he shall Compass the city all ye Men of War go around the city once thus shall thou do Six Days Seven priests shall bear before the ark seven trumpets of ram horns and the seventh day he shall Compass the cities seven times and the priests shall blow with the trumpets and it shall come to pass when they make a long blast with the Ram's Horn and when you hear the song of the trumpet all the people shall Shout with a great shout and the wall of the city shall fall down flat and the people shall Ascend up every man straight before him yeah so God lay out the end from the beginning he gave the description of the order of how it's supposed to be he described the end game which is the city walls to fall flat but there are fine prints to that whole plan that God give you can't run out and get excited and just do your own thing you have to wait for further instruction uctions the city has already been given your family has already been given forget what your eyes see everybody should be screaming now you are not going with your five senses your senses are lying say Amen say Amen your senses are I am you are not the believer the believer is the word in [Applause] you let me just get crack in here our righteousness is filthy rags you see your best foot forward you praying and you seeking the Lord and so on filthy rags that's what you do you pray you pray that you you can't even approach God Holiness with that so God will even hear you yes you is because of blood over you he hears your prayer and when your prayer comes to that blood it smell [Music] sweet like incense not just your voice but when it come through the [Applause] perfume of that Rose of Sharon of that lily of the valley my god when a man of God pray when the saints of God pray under that blood those Devils tremble because you got to know there is power not your prayer but Power in the Blood and when your prayer BST you that blood my God the Gates of Heaven have to open up and I feel this morning something going to break something going to take place right in this place right in this building right among you [Applause] don't bother with what the senses declare you may be seated Our Father Abraham demonstrated a life of faith that was astonishing that is shocking God spoke to him about he and his wife God never told Sarah anything he said you're going to have a son and his name going to be Isaac isn't that right through this old woman named Sarah never had a child and pass child baring time and Abraham had to believe for himself and believe for his wife who God never spoke to who had Horrors and fight and mind battles and she have a right to have that because she never got a revelation the what Abraham had if she was in the spiritual and super spiritual not super religious Behavior she might have walk out in Abraham until you half crack but you see the fate of Abraham do make it act funny it make it act contrary to other people thinking it make a old man believe that his he's going to have a child it make a old man believe his old woman wife going to have a child and he staggered not act act when his back hurt him he was stacking a little bit when he had a hold the stick he was Rock a little bit that wasn't the problem he had a cough he had this he had pain he had fever that's not the problem but what God Said don't mess with that don't play with that what God Said don't deny that just say God said so come on let the Lord Give the Lord a shout don't fool with [Applause] that listen God took them out of Egypt that wasn't a problem feed them in the wilderness they complain that wasn't a problem they want meat they TIY light bread that's not a problem you send meat for them they want drink water from the rock whatever they want God struggle through with them because he know that's not the promise the journey is not the promise so all you fed up and you're tired you're on your journey but when they came to Kesh Bia and God trying to say but listen friends I'm about to show you what the Fulfillment is what the end game is don't doubt now I want to bring evidence back I want to send men spies to bring back evidence of a reality that this is more than quotes and books and tapes and scripture reading there is a land beyond the river there's a supernatural power there's a power to heal the sick to raise the dead to cast out Devils to speak in new tongues there's a power like you have never seen before that is coming to the church now Hallelujah I want you to believe in that power don't just come to church to sit a bench come to church to create an atmosphere to make a church that going to make a Revival even a seven tunder Revival oh blessed be the name of the Lord oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory to God glory to God GL hallelujah hallelujah to father my father my father yes verse six of that scripture and Joshua the son of none called the priests said unto them fine print take up the Ark of the Covenant let the seven priests bear seven trumpets of romes before the Ark of the Lord he said unto the people pass on come pass the city let him that is armed pass on before the Ark of the Lord and it came to pass when Joshua spoke unto the people seven priests bearing seven trumpets of horns passed on before the Lord and blew the trumpets and the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord followed them and the armed men went before the priest and blew the trumpets and reward came after the act the priest going on blowing the trumpets hear this part and Joshua had commanded the people saying you shall not shout hallelujah or make any noise with your voice neither shall any word proceed out of your mouth until the day I B you to shout then shall you shout so amidst the whole plan Joshua introduced a a time of Silence hallu silence does mean nothing [Applause] happening silent doesn't mean that there just nothing in effect no silence is waiting Hallelujah for the appointed time Hallelujah to execute God's plan and purpose so Joshua said when I bu it the shout then shout oh Hallelujah glory to God Amen Hallelujah praise the Lord praise God praise God and it came to pass on the seventh day when there Rose early about the dawn of the day and Compass the city seven times only on that day and the compass the city seven times came to the seven time when the police bought the trumpets Jus people shout for the Lord had given you the city hallu praise God that's before the city fall before the walls fell they had to shout because the Lord give the city you're not waiting for the walls to fall to shout you have to shout before your [Applause] walls H H that's faith when you could shout before your eyes pop open when you could shout before your part of your body get loosed when you could praise God hallelujah after 25 years believing God when you could give God a praise offering my God that like the devil say that you he is out of your hands now because you reconnect to the sense you had before the fall you see right now you you born in s you born in in sin and shape iniquity and connect to Five Senses but when you see you reconnect to the six sense of faith that you had before the fall then then you come like a in in Invincible man you you come like a Superman praise be to Jesus Oh Glory to God and the devil didn't want you to understand that God promised in the last I'm Superman not men with no s mark on the chest not that kind of Superman that's Hollywood that's that comic STP business we talking about real Superman like Daniel was a Superman praise God Abram was a Superman praise God and boys they were Superman yes yes yes Daniel the lion couldn't eat him fire couldn't burn them fellas them guys was different Al together they had a different kind of DNA they had a different kind of Gene that Gene come from God it always came from God they were not just men of the earth they came from God they going back to God and God promised in the last days for the manifestation of the sons of God when real sons born Sons fill Sons anointed Sons speak and the word is created just like that my God preaching the gospel in power you're going to see it right here oh yeah yeah yeah you're going to see it the word preaching its power the clarity of the Gospel the word being made plain no more questions no more unbelief no more doubts the prayers of the Saints you're going to understand it and when you get a revelation that Heaven is Waiting on your prayers Heaven is Waiting on your prayer Oh Glory to [Applause] God oh Hallelujah be seated my why you

then one them start explode and bring forth five more stars that's what the seven seal it ends the time of the world it ends the time for this it ends the time for that it end the time for everything is ended up on that seventh seal the breaking of this seal was so great that heaven was hushed by silence for the space of half an hour half an hour was fixed no man could change it it's only for a space of half an hour half an hour of Silence God's silence Heaven's silence but underneath that Ence he's redeeming a people by his blood by his word hallelujah Redemption present tense he himself came down in first Thessalonians 4 scripture said the Lord himself descends from heaven with a shout with a shout hallelujah with the voice of the Archangel and the Trump of God the Lord himself he he to trust no other Angel to come to C this bride he came down in Revelation 10 and seven tunders show its voices out oh glory to God Seven Thunders show its voices out it's not going to catch the snakes it's not going to catch the crabs it's going to catch the rainbow trout it going to cat the elect lady therefore the seven ters is only for the bride it's an exclusive bright [Applause] promise Oh Glory to God and the lion of the tribe of Judah he wrot it out oh Hallelujah do you believe that oh praise the name of the Lord no singing no Praises no altar nothing silence deadly silence in heaven for half an hour all the host of Heaven Was silent when this seven seal mystery in the book of redemption was broken think of it but it's broke oh Hallelujah who could say it wasn't broke it broke but it was silent Hallelujah for half an hour what you going to think when that happen what that silence is broken oh hallelujah oh my heaven going back with noise man because heaven is full of worship you know only that's why half an hour is fixed only half an hour Heaven Can Only Hold that back for half an hour after half an hour it's back to worship it's back to shouts because Shout because the Lord has given you the city after half an hour is a Year of Jubilee after half an hour you're going back to your family you going back to your prayer life you're going back to inheritance you're going back to that anointing that make you a super Church a super race a super people on the Earth I am convinced that there's a super race on the Earth all this racist nonsense is only impersonating a true elect race that God put on the earth with the DNA of God hallelujah makes you not superior but make you to be like God a God man on the [Applause] earth Glory Glory [Applause] Glory my Jesus you may be seated that super Gene make you transcend natural and Supernatural look at Jesus going to a wedding and wine ran out and they say master the W run out he say what I have to do with that what I have to do with that I'm a guest like everybody else but then he the instructions whatever he said do it because his word not normal he speak by faith and walk by faith his word could create things just like that so fool with what he said whatever he said just do it he said take some bottles and just draw it draw the water out of it listen you're pouring water and you're pouring out wine you're fulling water and pouring out wine you're fulling water and pouring out wine don't let the water fool you you're going to pour out wine oh oh my [Applause] God hallelujah you know what wine is wine is stimulation of Revelation wine is what make you stand up why is what make you shout why is what make you B Hallelujah why make your act crazy it's being revealed to you by your father Flesh and Blood have not revealed it [Applause] h and that's the problem lacking people lack Revelation know the Bible true and God is true and God is true but not Revelation but if you get Revelation a different thing like that look at Simeon old man it was revealed to him that he shall see death to the Lord Christ cancer come F canc so Grim Reaper come he said take a spin not yet as long as I see Christ you can't do nothing Grim Reaper G me wink ey wink I say wink I how much I want to wink to God make a spin you can't touch me you could watch me but until Messiah come you can do one thing because these eyes anointed to see [Applause] Messiah what are you anointed for this morning what are you anointed for this morning tell me tell me tell me what are you anointed for this [Applause] morning every day coming to church old man what you coming to church for I come to see Christ old man we giving you a rocking chair for retirement I still comeing to see Christ old man we improving your bed home relax he said no hallu one day one day every day under expectation because he have Revelation he know he not going to die until he see the Christ and here what David said I shall not die but live to declare the works of the Lord the Lord I chasen me sure but he have not given me over onto debt so don't complain stand up like a man you're going to make it stand up like a man you're going to break out stand up like a man come on you Royal Seed of Abraham don't stagger don't give [Applause] [Applause] up don't ever think your praise means nothing because when John begin to praise His prayer his praise was breaking Dimensions pray prayers praise is something else prayer is something else you know prayer can start on Earth and hit heaven and you don't even know when it hit Heaven's Door but when God hears it he do hear it you know I've heard I've heard the people are desperate they really want a Revival they really want the Holy Ghost they really want the supernatural to break amongst them they for God I feel it this morning there's a thirst in the camp I love it any preacher going to love this I feel a deep calling to a deep I feel your groaning in spirit I feel your birth is about to come forth when Zion travailed Zion brought for Oh Glory to God is a travailing Zion there got to come as Trav in [Applause] [Music] s [Applause] you may be seated the world worried because they know what the D will do but that have nothing to do with what we had to do what he don't to do how to do but what the bride have to do the bride have to do oh we have some some heavy stuff this morning hallelujah praise God praise God hallelujah hallelujah and then he went further to say my as certain as I stand on the platform tonight I had the Revelation that will reveal of that seven seal it is in a three-fold manner and I will speak to you of an of a fold of it Hallelujah he said what happened is that those seven Thunders that he heard thunder and was forbidden to write what's the mystery laying those seven consecutive Thunders rolling out oh Hallelujah the mystery under the seven seil seven Thunders that the devil knows nothing about it was silent so he can't interpret it he have no revelation of it he don't understand it he can't connect with it so anytime I talk about Thunders he's totally confused his cabesa can't handle that his Spirit can handle that hallelujah praise God but the bride could handle that because that restores her image and the likeness of God back into her bride that is what make her a super race and a super church and a super people they're going to be amazed at the confidence that God put in your spirit amen in your heart but they're going to take note that you have been with Jesus because what Jesus did you'll be doing the same thing too these things Jesus began and continued to do Hallelujah if the first church wrote a book of Acts and next church can write books I will say it again if the first church wrote a book of Acts we can't be writing books and reading books we have to write another book of Acts amen amen book of act means shaking off the snake in the fire not going to the doctor and say you go D you go D like a snake back me no no no shake it off and the snake good as dead he dead fire kill him shake it off when the snake bites you everybody looking for the dead looking for you to give up looking for it to write off wrting you off before they're trying to write you off they want to write your off but God didn't write your off God put your name down in the book that's why the devil he's exposed this [Applause] morning don't believe you just ordained to get sick and die don't accept that don't accept that let God sign you off not let the devil sign you off don't ever take what the devil tell you you're sick you can't make it this can't break it this door closed that door closed well you close the doors but can open any door you close the only door that we can't open is with God that God shut don't let the devil shut no door for you let God open the door he's a way [Applause] maker H so brother brandham I believe we are so close to the coming of the Lord Jesus it behooves us to do all that we possibly can Amen to bring every soul to the kingdom amen and to to bring the kingdom to the people amen that we might be healed of our spirit and I believe that the body of Jesus is the sickest body I know of the spiritual body of Christ on Earth is very sick amen so here talk about physical healing but what about the healing of your soul of your mind of your past of your sins to be released from your guilt and you can't get out your own condemnation and can't condemn on the rot you were in how do you get out of it how do you P out of it you cry and see like God not hearing you you cry you call you pray and see like God is silent but God is Not silent as if he doing nothing I believe in my heart that his response has to do with your response amen isn't that right praise God that woman told herself if I could just Touch the Hem of His Garment I made whole she pressed her away and she was made whole isn't that right one time a baby Abraham was prayed that the baby was raised from the dead next woman she heard about that baby raised from the dead her baby was dead and she went to the convention she went to the meeting and she pressed her away she passed through leg she pushed she pushed she pushed and but bam tell somebody go down and pray for her she he doesn't know who she doesn't know who I am and eventually she pressed away so much her faith was pressing it's not just her physical body pressing her faith is what was pushing her her faith went up to heaven her faith break that dimension of time and went into that higher dimension Heaven dropped down a vision on brother brandham saw the baby smiling and that woman who was at the back had to come to the front he said bring that baby to me Hallelujah and the baby was raised from the dead why because Faith broke through and caught Heaven's attention you see Faith Heaven Must respond to Faith must it's compulsory Heaven cannot ignore Faith that's right faith is like racket in heaven Hallelujah

Holy Ghost he has not yet reached that goal with God that God recognize it and Abraham found Abraham was faithful to the promise that God gave him that he would have a child and God here we go confirm his faith by giving him a sign a sign of circumcision which is a type of the Holy Spirit he said you talk to me you let me talk to a Man 2 minutes I could tell you whether he received the Holy Ghost

to a time it's no secret here we go we all see it when a man proves and God loves him he takes him out somewhere to himself and there in the front of Angel he does something for him he lifts him up and there in the presence of God gifts him and fills them and sets them out that's the age we are living in Hallelujah but God taking his sons and daughters and blessing them and you can't do nothing about it it's just God hand upon that person life Hallelujah the same holy spirit that saved the lutherans Sanctified the methodists baptized the Pentecostal is Now setting in order the coming of the Lord Jesus when it'll be so powerful that body will come into this group of church will draw the rest of them from the grave that and there'll be a resurrection that is what the Holy Ghost was given for it wasn't given for just to say we have the Holy Ghost it was given for a purpose to bring Perfection to bring on the resurrection Hallelujah that is what God released his spirit for what is the Holy Ghost without us they cannot be made perfect they live in one day under that we live in another day when the enemy come like a flood the spirit of God raise a standard against it the spirit of God raised a standard what is it he is pouring in the spirit then those who are resting in the grave under the altar saying crying how long Lord how long how much longer God is waiting on me and you the church is waiting on me and you adoption time when God can pour into us his fullness his power his resurrection here we go and when the church and Christ becomes so close till Christ becomes visible Among Us and raises the dead so it's not you raising the dead it's Christ coming visible Among Us and raising the dead Hallelujah because Christ does all three the shout the voice and the Trump Christ among God people so we creating a tabernacle a house a dwelling place for him to come in step into it we become the Capstone bride the magnet Bride for Christ to step into it to pull up the grave [Applause] [Music] what you could do isn't that right it will make them man turn your head from them half naked woman and quit lusting after them it will is to quit making you smoke and

different no compromise with the word God will not apologize to Sodom and gomorra God didn't make Adam and Stevie make Adam and Eve no compromise whatsoever it's just the word of God hallelujah isn't that right praise the name of the Lord I'm a Baptist I'm a presbyterian I wouldn't go to that old holy rer Bunch the Holy Ghost come to take this touch out of you wash you in the blood blood here we go is to give unction to the preacher amen hallelujah so you have to see unction and the preacher virtue power upon the preacher that's what the Holy Ghost is supposed to do no no dry intellectual your stuff no unction come to the preacher power of speech power to preach power to teach power of prayer power to witness Christ that is the purpose of the Holy Ghost unction to the preacher is to give Holiness to the group there we go it's to set the church in order it's to bring the unity of the spirit it's to unite us together with power not with convention and books and tast with power power upon you power upon me we get United Oh Glory to God how many believe that you inspired on your job you inspired in school you inspired when you go home you're Anointed with God look B was praying for a woman uh praying the prayer line a woman came up with a baby and the testimonies was something like this he said the baby's already healed the woman next to the woman when she was sitting down fell led to pray for that baby and she prayed for that baby her prayer God honored the prayer of that woman for that child butam said God knew that woman had more compassion than him to pray for that child so you he what God using that you could step into somebody's shoes and feel their pain and then effectively minister to them in prayer and spirit is not a mechanical thing it's a heart thing [Applause] you know hard it was be for that woman caught in adultery in the very act you know the shame and the embarrassment she must have felt by all these high priest looking men with all the long gong and whatnot and had the insights in and her was outside you know how Jesus was a felt dealing with that whole scenario he turned his back on and right in the sand he gave them chance to leave one by one he knew they would leave because he dropped the picture on them and the mirror and say look at all yourself take a peek if you like where you see all right belt all right the Big Stone when they look so they couldn't handle what they seeing was a mirror he put amen amen check yourself out first yes sir and they couldn't handle it they walk away amen so you could understand now the compassion that Jesus dealt with to deal with that woman to tell a woman neither do I condemn go and sin no more you could understand how he was reaching out to the woman of the well you can understand how he go to Blind bimas you could understand and and it's interesting because a blind man come to him and Jesus ask what will you want me to do for you and the man blind like a bat and you could see that but he still want it to come out your mouth what do you want me to do for you Lord to receive my sight Hallelujah that's what he wanted to hear be thou whole go and see receive your sight receive your deliverance receive your breakthrough receive your healing receive your Victory receive your [Applause] comfort Hallelujah Glory Hallelujah so the breastplate of Aram Aon called and th him had 12 Stones and Isaac shared it with you all and anytime somebody a dream of vision they would bring it and speak it the stones would dormant dead nothing but when you speak it a supernatural light used to glow like a rainbow light to say that's God so that's how they knew the dream or the vision or the prophecy was of God Amen if somebody speak it and nothing happen thumbs down and that one so but saying here now if that supernatual light on a human T did not flash it was rejected because God was not in it I want you to hear listen any message regardless if it's from priest from preacher from Prophet or anything else any man no matter how spiritual what his office is what he has done if he raised the dead if he healed the sick if he's the AR Bishop of canary if he's the pope of Rome if he's the head of any denomination no matter how spiritual though he has spoke with tongues dance in the spirit though he preached the gospel no matter what he has done if his message doesn't come with the Bible it's [Applause] wrong this is God's human th [Music] Hallelujah so the Aon priesthood is done away with but we still have a human T which is the Bible amen it have to flash isn't that right he told a dream okay whatever he saw the secret light okay skip that down praise the name of the Lord so it can't be one little quote here it had to be line upon line it has to be through the scriptures to bring out the whole picture isn't that right am oh my Hallelujah the Holy Ghost ought to be more important to you than everything else there is in the world your prestige your life your job you anything that there is you should not cease until you have it you must receive it it must be the most you say well I'm afraid day at my work I'm afraid at my husband don't be

everything else let me have it now praise God desperate you get desperate you really got to have it or die oh blessed be the name of the Lord praise be to Jesus that's what the Holy Ghost supposed to mean to you isn't that right now Joshua to divide the land what if he like the tribe of God better than the Tribe of Benjamin tribe of Ephraim what if he like the tribe of Joseph better than Judah he didn't do it that way he divided it according to the word revealed by the spirit he divided it it according to tribe and notice he done it by Revelation by the discernment of God's spirit each one of those Hebrew mothers giving birth to those babies called their name and each one of their name had a meaning Jacob when he was born being a twin she called himself planter but when he got overcome in power his name was changed a prince isn't that right and when the the great thing each one of those Hebrew mothers in their travailing in child birth Hallelujah called their name out Reuben and plac him position in Palestine so the child birth the travil brought out the name as to place them and before we leave here you have to be placed so it will take some travail to positionally place you it

test just the angel said she believed and it was so when she called the name Jesus John in Elizabeth Mo jump up and B Hallelujah that baby wasn't moving along got quickened by the name of Jesus when are we going to come to that spot where you could receive the word from the angel that your family is delivered your city is already taken already it's already given you just have to take it now when

acts is what the acts of the Apostle is the acts of the Holy Ghost in the Apostle when the Holy Ghost get into the church is not big me and little you is still we all come into the unity of the faith into the know of the Son of God into the statue of a perfect man so it's not some preacher up there some some some some some high up somewhere and the people down there low low low and you to send some trippings to them you know what I mean like like Mana no no no no no no no no the veil is rent and you have access to that Mana you have access to that blessing you have access oh do you believe that praise the name of the Lord hallelujah praise God thank you Jesus so brother was praying he said let us pray heavenly father I pray amen wow that you will help this audience help me I help this audience no matter how much I would believe they have got to believe too cause here we go it's their faith that operates your presence that gets from you whatsoever they desire right am okay I'm going to wrap up wow I'm only halfway through so we see all right so here what he said you went he's praying he's praying listen to this prayer you went to your own country full without measure the fullness of the godhead bodily and men and women didn't believe you he's uneducated where did he get his schooling where did he come from where did his wisdom come from isn't his father with us to carent his mother his brother and sister they all here and the Bible said many mighty Works he could could not do because of their unbelief and that was the Son of God the fullness in him and he was couldn't do much because of their unbelief Hallelujah and you are the same yesterday today and forever God take all unbelief from us let us submit ourselves to the Holy Ghost and give a great climax to this meeting that every sick and Afflicted person be healed granted in Jesus name Hallelujah so it's very important that you understand the atmosphere and the faith that God require of you in going forward listen to this I cannot do it no Minister can do it it takes all of us together in prayer and believing trus in God to see the Holy Spirit continue to bless his people as you wait on his coming now a minister cannot bring a Revival there's no preacher can bring a Revival he doesn't pack it with him the only thing he can do is be loyal to God and his word and the Revival has to come by the people amen in your home in your life Oh Glory to God Revival come by say it out say it again the Revival has to come by the people that mean the people have to catch something you have to see something you have to believe something that it belongs to you it's yours oh Hallelujah brother Brandon from TR sign Overlook he said when atomic bombs and people are scared in the Pentagon it's time for Elijah to rise in the scene here we go let the people amen let that little flock that little Remnant that God will give him let that little Remnant go to calling out to God and Watch What Happens there'll be a national Showdown there'll be a power that they have never seen before the trouble of it is it'll be too late then the doors will be closed remember we at the end time pray he prophesy that the little flock the little Remnant that God going to give that Elijah going to go to calling upon God the prayers of the Saints when the church when that little flock when that little Remnant go to calling upon God it will be a national Showdown Oh Glory to God something going to move upon the people to push them to call upon God oh hallelujah hallelujah wait till that begin to call upon God then he said wait till them seven tunders utter the voices to that group who can really take the word and hand it there it's with slice and cut they can shut the heavens they can do whatever they want to do oh glory to God the Thunders yes when they call upon God oh glory to God do you believe that oh brother give me a church full of the Holy Ghost God will do in one year what all theology failed to do in 2,000 years you wait till the anointing of the church really strike home to that little Remnant after the doors of the Gentile is closed go God will anoint the church then oh Hallelujah he was filthy be filthy still he was righteous righteous still God will anoint the with the power of God and things will be taken place Hallelujah do you believe that how many believe that the daughter of the Gentiles will be closed God going to anoint the church with power I cast up now in the middle of something but I'm praying and contest listen L to this prayer raise up mighty men raise up Mighty Warriors of the faith oh hallelujah hallelujah that was his prayer the prophet is gone where are those Mighty Men where are those Warriors of the faith when Daniel prophesied the people that know their God shall do great exploits not just read books and tapes not just being a message no great exploits her exploits of faith the six sense and demonstration come on now we not preaching word only we preaching there power and demonstration of the [Applause] Gospel what God is waiting for God is trying to place his church in position to manifest himself getting one he can work through and said there is my spirit flowing freely I can work here I can place him get another one maybe he could start maybe he could start here maybe he could start today that God can place one that God could say I could send my spirit my spirit can flow freely unhindered Channel no politics no sin no unbelief just a pipe the spirit can flow through Hall glory to God glory so whenever God Express himself by the word all the word listen if it's a hybrid the word gets short the spirit gets short circuited so the current can flow because some Creed or some Dogma go try to send any current and current can't go through blow the fuse but when the current is Flowing freely the word of God expresses itself that's why when the word becomes flesh the invisible becomes visible so don't tell me there is no God we had to say there is a lack of surrender to God because any man surrender to God a man fully surrender to God the prophet say is omnipotent I'll say it again a man fully surrendered to God is omnipotent I'll say it again a man fully surrendered to God have more talk man fully surrender to God is omnipotent my god do you see how powerful that is Elijah walk out there and say not even do rain will faulty like C it and he shut the heavens up Hall omnipotent speaking Hallelujah a man words have an effect on nature hallelujah hallelujah that's the power we talking about before the doctor's hand touches my wife the tumor will go down hall order the tumor to go down serve the tumor notice sentence the tumor Hallelujah God class higher DNA super race before the doctor's hand touches my wife the tumor big like a grapefruit showing true address but a word spoken going past true time going past through space this is beyond science there's no explanation for [Applause] that amen fish diling in water little fishy I give you back your life I as a son as a super Sun I as a DNA Gene of God I give you back your life I have the authority I have life in me I can releve light inside of you oh glory to God Silver and Gold Have I None but what I have I could give a fish and if God could bring back a old fish give back what about you sitting here this morning don't tell me God can't break you [Applause] out don't complain about your husband believe God to deliver him complain about your wife complain about your family complain when I how you pray that's and cry long tears come and cry and groan and and groan and you can't sleep cuz you want an answer from God you may be seated there's a woman named Hannah she couldn't have any children and she going in the temple groaning and she had another sister terrorizing her y have no child and this and that and that and that so Hannah have pressure on both sides her own self her own condition her own depression her own frustration and plus a terrorist in church Amen in church but she went past that she groaned she travail her mouth was just mumbling the preacher box in Eli thought she was drunk but she was groaning and God heard her God heard her she told God if you give me a son I'll give him back to you God give us Samuel Oh Glory oh oh my God God give her a prophet hallall God bless her womb and God give her a prophet she said give my son I give him back to you through her groanings her travailing God bless her with more than her son God bless her with a prophet that come to boss Eli a prophet a baby that going to bring judment ah God not playing Hall but said these men if they pick up this and go out with it they can make more sense to it and bring it to a place I just want to lay this seed and then hope it come to life amen I'm afraid men just making try to make more sense to it but he didn't stop there he said I hope in other words make more sense it then what next we hearing more sense and more sense for 50 plus years what about the other part I hope they bring these seeds to life not just explanation not just talk to ification I know another word but to bring the seeds to life that it could Thunder because I have a t that shakes the devil did you hear what I [Applause] said devil I'm not impressed oh my almost done thank you Jesus God will raise up a new system an interational system by the power of God isn't that right by the power of God he said when the church get a true revelation of the two Spirits working within the framework of the Christian church and with God's spirit discern and withstand the Antichrist Spirit Satan will be powerless before her let me tell you there's coming an hour where Satan going to be powerless amen powerless powerless you walk into a sick room but says and the devil know the sickness know it have to go out right and you step into the room all them demons they're looking for the exit because a powered son coming there holy holy Lord God Almighty you're walking in the spirit of power Spirit of Holiness all the bells around you women [Applause] Hallelujah Glory so they hold themselves in the upper room dry seeds Oh Glory to God and but even give a tremendous exaltation in preting on on on Thursday night praise God and I want to bring some little quotes from what he shared here no one can look at what they see and be a Christian no one can look at what they see and be a Christian you have got to believe the things that are unseen by faith you are healed not by sight not not by feelings the Supernatural is what you do not see but what you believe and act on through that we become so conscious of looking at one another like this but there's an Unseen World greater than anything you can see the Unseen World is is more real than this world because the world that came came from things that do not appear Amen in other words the seen World a person had cancer tumor a person dying but he seen world so that person healed so the Unseen World is greater than this world and when you pull from The Unseen World and bring it to this world eyes pop open deaf air pop open dumb begin to speak because this Unseen World is more real than this world because this Unseen World could create a new world oh my oh my didn't mean to keep it this long but listen to this in this world man is contining getting worse choosing rather to walk by sight instead of by faith then when he does he robs the inner man which is the soul the Eternal part of man in this world in this building there are evil spirits and War and Christians anointed and the angels of God encamp around them to energize them with faith and here I am standing here yaling myself and the Holy Spirit is moving this is what you call Heavenly places so when you come to church you come to be energized when you praise somebody behind you not praising God your anointing start to sweep and and be all around [Applause] them the whole armor of God is Supernatural love joy peace longsuffering gentleness meekness and the Holy Ghost all of that is unseen life Faith joy peace all of that is unseen every armor of the believer is looking at the Unseen the whole armor of God is Supernatural if if you look at your hand if you look at your tumor it will remain that way look away from that and look to the promise of God Daniel was looking to the Unseen when he went to the Lion's de the two HEB boys was going unseen when the fireing furnace if you watch your firey furnace you go ball oh God but when you look at the Unseen you say my God if my god do deliver I'm still not going to bow down I'm going to go as long as God is leading I'm going to go he going to lead me up the mountain he going to lead me down the valley he going to lead me over the hill wherever he going to go he's going to lead me isn't that right oh glory to God hallelujah hallelujah the six sense that sense of faith is what made the red SE push back that six sense raised the dead by the six sense Mighty Miracles that be performed it's the most powerful force on Earth your fifth sense lays within your brain but your six sense lays in your heart your five senses lays in your brains but this six Sense come on give the Lord a shout you're almost done that six sense lays inside your guard your heart guard your heart guard your heart don't let no bitterness don't let no envy and evil guard your heart because there is where that six sense got to thunder oh Hallelujah glory to God because of the six sense the lands could need Daniel they couldn't get near him because that six sense was a super sense that same six sense the Tre boys was thrown a fiery furnace and all reasoning could have proven that we be burned to death but that six cense stayed for 2 three hours it's that same six cense that have a Peter Paul laying in jail and they're going to behead him next day but down in Mark's house they had a prayer meeting and the six sense here we go begin to accumulate around the jail where he was covered by prayer it was the prayers of the Saints loosen the six sense and they creat an atmosphere around the prison they want to cut off brother Peter head next day but the six sense of Faith bust that prison open and loose Peter from that prison and the devil want to cut off your head but today we come to guarantee you and with the prayers of the Saints praise God to raise you out of that atmosphere that you're in Oh Glory to God it was the six sense that raised Jesus from the dead after he laid in the ground he belied the word of God destroyed his body in three days I will raise it up but he is going down but I will raise it up because the sixense was built in oh give the Lord some Praises people hallelujah hallelujah Hallelujah and the prophet said the six sense oh God pour it out on me give it to me give it to everyone who needs it Pour thy six sense into me [Applause] Lord Oh Glory to God hallelujah I think that no church in this practice no matter how intellectual and fundamental it might be that church cannot strive until the Supernatural is made known among the people and they see it amen just a four two more quotes and we close Hallelujah Hallelujah from a true sign Overlook under T you man many wonders why would would those things be necessary for a man to go through it's because talking about the prophets is because people won't read the word and they won't pray so God is Sovereign he sends his Prophet to be a sign the people won't read they don't care to read they won't pray because they have other things to do they can't take time to pray and the Bible is boresome to them hasn't got enough action for them these days God here we go want his people to pray and when Israel got so taxed in such a condition that they could not go any further they time was fulfilled and their burden lay further than they thought they begin to pray and when the people begin to pray then God begins to hear hallu it was time for the word of God to be fulfilled and amam and Yoshi bed saw it was time for God to be word to be fulfill they went to pray to God and usually those who pray is the one who gots the burden and the one who gets something is who pray that's ordain of God to do so watch let them all break down the Prejudice and say we'll all forget our CES and cism everything else isn't it strange that God wants the people to have a part into it the prayers of the Saints Hallelujah isn't it strange here why when Jesus looked up to the Harvest he said the Harvest is right the laborers are few you pray the Lord of the Harvest that's what him you pray to me that I will send laborers into the Harvest it is some part you have to do God God here we go are you ready church is everybody up and Alive God is waiting for his church to call on him everybody didn't hear that because didn't hear thing I get 100% amen God is waiting on his church to call on him he always did it God is waiting today for the people to call his servants into action the servant can't get into action until the people [Music] [Applause] [Music] pray I'm not hearing you I'm not hearing you do you want the church do you want the servant of God to come into action then you have to have the prayers of the Saints and there's a vile there's a container to hold your prayer it's like incense unto God Amen [Applause] I'm close with this musici come please brother Brandon we looking forward for a great time in the Lord with your prayers I'm sure we'll do the best we can for the glory of God prayer changes things amen prayer changes debt to life prayer changes sickness to health Sinners to Saints it's prayer you may laugh too much you may shout too much you may eat too much but you will never pray too much the Bible said I would that man would pray may the Lord bless you huj pray for me God bless [Applause] you oh give him praise this this morning hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh
