one of our minister and brethren i'd like to greet the convention one more time so god bless you as he comes amen as we welcome him to hear his testimony may god richly bless you praise god amen god bless you all greetings to the local and international audience on your virtual convention 2022 god richly bless you all certainly appreciate the opportunity from bertie to bring greetings to the audience on your convention team inspiration preparation for battle inviting us to be ready for the hour of battle shayna taught from greatest battle ever fought god's prophet telling us i believe he's been dressing them teaching them and the battlefront is now set getting ready to start according to force peter 5 and 8 be sober be vigilant because your adversary the devil as a roaring lion walking about seeking whom he may devour so our enemy a roaring land our enemy is here to destroy and destroy everything in its pathway as god's prophet identify we live in a time where all evil is dumped upon these people all hell is open up the lid has come off of hell so streams of demon power poured upon the people but thanks be to god in the same season all heaven is dumb all hell is dumped upon us all heaven is dumped on us all blessings upon god's people so church friends we are in a battle we fight every day we are in a warfare and this fight is until life is finished hallelujah so as long as we remain on this act amen we are in a battle ephesians 6 11 tell us put on the whole arm of god that he may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil why is the word identifying upon us to put on the old armor of god if you're not going to fight so we are here to fight we fight battles every day we are constantly in a warfare remember church the devil takes his men but never his spirit god takes his man but never his spirit so the spirit's battling right on and this battle is in these over our tabernacles of flesh and the battles carry us straight to the end believers christians tonight there or tonight wherever we are we battle every day we battle winner warfare between right and wrong we battle against sin we are warring against sin we have never been promised a floral bed of ease amen but we have been promised grace sufficient we have been promised grace to overcome we have been promised grace to endure we have been promised grace to sustain so the apostle paul in the scripture speaking to us identifying to us the believer to be prepared for war because you're going to accept that battles and trials accompany life we are in a battle for life but thanks be to god god knows how to equip his people didn't finish god knows what it will take to defeat the enemy naturally we read history and through the years we got to understand there was a season that they fought with bow and arrow they grow in their weaponry the natural military more and more today they have atomic weapons today they have nuclear weapons but thanks be to god god at the beginning he gave his children the best hallelujah unlike the enemy the enemy is what we call a trilogy the enemy is learning on the job but god is not learning on the job he is in finite and the infinite god equips his children with all that is needed from the garden of eden straight to the rapture that's the god we serve god give us the best and he gave us the best even at the very beginning our god never had to change his weaponry here learning more god gave us his word and he would already tell us when the enemy comes into the flood the spirit of the lord raises up a standard against the enemy that is god's weaponry so the script gear tells us put on put it on put on tonight today the whole arm of god we got to know what our armor is to put it on you got to know what it is we got to know what our is our armor is supernatural our armor is an armor of faith our armor has nothing natural in it nothing of the world we look tonight today at the unseen our armor consists of love it consists of joy it consists of peace consists of long suffering it consists of goodness conceive consists of meekness our armor consists of the supernatural so what am i tonight is not natural hallelujah but our armor is a spiritual hidden power our armor is himself glory to god himself in you that's our armor and that will allow we don't cut through any promise that god has made for you our armor the baptism of the holy ghost so if tonight you would deny one word of god you could realize that you don't have an armor obama is the word god's prophet tells us satan trick is to allow you to disbelieve your weapon satan trick is to make you believe that your weapon is equivalent to his or your weapon is not strong enough hallelujah but god has given us a weapon and that weapon is the word of god and our enemy is anything or anyone that reasons against the word of god god's prophet is a message putting on the whole armor of god program 76 tells us that god fortified his army what with himself in the form of prophets apostles teachers pastors what did he do what was god doing listen did you ever think what that offices of the church is is god's dress inside dress an apostle a prophet a seer foresee before satan ever get to it don't told it what is it is god dressed up in his church these offices is god's dressway and when you see those offices pastors teachers evangelists what is that that is god's dress where god's presence god's spirit walking through man and if that office could understand who the enemy is tonight if that office deny any of his word then it's not god's dressing know that that's a wolf in sheep glory watch that fellow beware of him hallelujah amen so we want to watch that fellow beware of him so in the thoughts from god's the greatest battle ever fought i believe he's dressing them he's training them so we are not only dressed for war the believer is trained for fighting and if you want to use the terminology of a soldier a soldier training is rugged amen got to be careful an untrained soldier an untrained soldier will cause destruction to others so soldier got to be trained for fighting as a recruit you may find the training is tough but when you go to the warfare you got to believe recognize it was good for you so thank god for rugged training god's prophetic give us you could search it to give us his experience with six second spit so you've got to thank god for ruggedness thank god for rugged treat training thank god for rugged god spell preaching hallelujah at the end of the road you will appreciate it we pray god will richly bless your meeting will richly bless the speakers ahead amen that will bring forth soldiers warring soldiers not those that you ought to beg and post your head no that's not army language not those who are to be better than babies that is illegitimate children that's a cheap reproduction but rugged training we thank god for the word of god poured upon us will train us for that rugged fight god bless you god bless your services god bless the convention amen and amen hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord amen you appreciate those greetings we appreciate those words amen and amen let's lift our hands let's just amen rise praise god amen east and begin to just worship him thank you lord amen we thank you for your love we thank you for your power thank you for your holy spirit glory to god amen and amen and amen praise the name of the lord here i am to worship here i am to bow down here i am to say that you're my god amen amen if you like singing that praise the name of the lord hallelujah let's just worship him and begin to create an atmosphere around us praise god for the holy spirit amen to speak to us amen here i am to worship here i am to bow down here i am to say that [Music] all

precious brother jesse robledo amen all the way from new york usa praise god to speak to the children of god amen in this convention we're so happy to have him praise god and we pray that god would use his servant to speak his word only amen that he could confirm his word with power and with anointing and with presence so may god bless you may you invite the holy spirit where you are just surround yourself in his presence and just say amen to every word amen as it comes forth praise god and i know we'll be mightily blessed amen as we wait to hear from the lord god richie bless you as he comes amen [Music] and worship praise god hallelujah amen thank you jesus hallelujah to the lamb amen praise be to god what a day what a beautiful uh atmosphere that we feel in the house of the living god this morning amen i want to take this opportunity to to greet uh brother theo ovitt and then the entire team down in trinidad who has made this convention possible we realize that anyone can have a vision and have a desire to have a convention be it uh live and we have had these virtual conventions which has made it quite frankly a little more challenging because there's different time zones and different uh uh brother ovitz sent a beautiful beautiful trailer of the actual uh convention which i was very blessed and i believe the hour of charge is here amen we wrestle not against flesh and blood but we wrestle against uh spiritual powers amen in high places praise god and we realize that that uh they're they're everywhere you see and remember a spirit cannot do anything to us unless it has a body to work through so this is why i want to make sure this morning cautiously to make sure that we do hate the sin but not the flesh because it has to use a fl a body amen and many of them by the grace of god um i i will say this many people who have their own opinions their own ideas my uh my absolute is this word i just want to give you my testimony my absolute is this message and this is where you can get me on common ground amen if we're speaking uh the bible we're speaking this message this end time message then i will amend you praise god from the beginning of your message to the end amen but if there's a thinking man's filter in every one of our hearts which god has predestinated to put in the hearts of the people amen what is that that's the holy the spirit of truth that will not ever mislead you amen to any uh falsehood so we are grateful and i am privileged to be identified with these god-called men we realize that god cannot send a revival unless he has men to pack it out once again god uses man once again like god uses man the devil will use his man so therefore it has gotten to the end where uh let the god that answers by fire let him be god amen amen so we realize the showdown is on the dynamics will prove what is right and what is wrong amen so we could teach we could sow seeds we could uh preach so we're blue in the face unless that seed that we are sowing comes to life in the hearts of the people and become material the word made flesh and only the dynamics can come and rest upon that seed to make it live amen outside of that we're just fussing and arguing over scriptures and things so lord this is my prayer this morning lord send the dynamics to the church amen then shall raise up uh like a great mighty army praise god hallelujah it'll shake the whole world it'll shake new york city it'll shake trinidad it'll shake south africa it'll shake amen all over the world amen it wouldn't be something that you hear it'll be the seven thunders are being made manifest hey amen we can preach seven thunders we can preach revival but unless they are being made manifest that is the attraction that's going to bring people in not the teaching of the word but the dynamics of the word hallelujah to the lamb praise be to god so greetings to all these fine men i'm i'm very happy and blessed to be associated with these uh god-called men from nigeria ivory coast amen ghana england trinidad south africa you name it and it doesn't end there amen uh every country under the sun has a representative amen i believe that god has his people everywhere so may the lord richly bless you as we get into our little message i don't want to keep you long amen i realize we are being uh uh timed and i just don't want to keep uh the convention uh long but we are here in new york city we're still alive and well amen amen our ship is still float floating although our ship was supposed to sink long ago by the grace of all mighty god he has given us amen the strength and the power and the whatever it takes to keep us moving on you know in in the believer there is no quitting amen in the church of the living god there is no quit there is no i give up praise god and i don't care if i have 10 15 whatever it may be five that won't give up god will use those five to turn new york city upside down praise god that's the real believer that god is looking for so let us turn to ephesians chapter six and without any further delay ephesians chapter six and i love this uh verse this chapter rather because this is our season our time amen so we could understand and ephesians places the believer we all know uh in the promised land and uh positionally placed us we'll start with ephesians chapter 6 and we will read from verse 10 or yes from verse 10 we'll go through the uh all right we'll we'll go through 17 the 17th verse ephesians chapter 6 starting from verse 10 finally my brethren be strong in the lord and in the power of his might we can only be strong in the power of his might hallelujah to the lamb amen you can say oh i'm strong but if you don't have the power of his might amen we're just saying things he put on the whole armor of god that he may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh ministers pastors deacons whatever we wrestle not against that the flesh part see flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places wherefore take unto you the whole armor of god amen that he may be able to withstand the evil day how many know we are in the evil day and haven't done all to stand stand therefore having your loins gird about with truth amen and having the breast plate of righteousness amen and not at one of these things although they are called breastplate although they're called you know be uh you know clothed with this great mighty armory not a one of these are physical you know how the breastplate of righteousness amen that can only be a spiritual breastplate amen having your loins guard about with truth that could only be a spiritual amen uh a protection and your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace above all having the shield of faith wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked amen and take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit you can't see a spirit so it has to be a spiritual sword that we're talking about see uh which is what the word of the lord and the word is sharper than a two-edged sword amen may the lord add a blessing to the reading of his word let's turn now to revelations chapter 12 and we will start from the seventh verse revelations chapter 12 because i i want to show you something here god willing to show you that you know this battle and this conflict that we are speaking on this morning uh did not start just a few days ago this uh battle started before there was a world or should i say before we had any conscience of any of this see there was a battle a war in heaven the war started in heaven and if i may say so the war is no longer in heaven because these angels that oppose god and resisted god were cast down to earth and they these spirits that were cast down they could do nothing unless they find bodies and their continue their evil work through humanity so i want you to get that clear that way we understand and there was war in heaven michael and his angels fought against the dragon and the dragon fought and his angels and prevailed not of course he'll never prevail against what is right against the word itself neither was their place found anymore in heaven this is why i say you're not going to find their place in heaven because they late they left their first estate amen and they fell down on the earth and this is where you see and read in genesis the first murder the first rape the first uh anything the first evil act took place on earth in genesis amen hallelujah so and prevailed not neither was their place found anymore in heaven see and the great dragon was cast out the old serpent called the devil well who is the old serpent that's the same one that spoke to eve amen amen he had a he had a message that was so close what was his message 99 and nine tenths truth but he was fallen because he left one percent out it has to be the word that old serpent called the devil and satan which deceiveth the word the whole world he was cast out into the earth and his angels were cast out with him may the lord had a blessing to the reading of his word let us have a word of prayer father we have read your word lord surely heaven and earth will pass away but your word will never pass away now we are reading from scriptures lord from way back in the beginning and we go to the end of the uh the book of the bible in revelations we can see how lord the battle started way back amen in heaven and satan trying to exhort himself above all that was righteous lord he wanted to create a kingdom that was higher and better than lord almighty god but we realize that that was not the plan of god because there's only one king of kings lord of lords amen and every man must stay in his place every angel must stay in their places in order for the universe and everything else to work in perfect harmony every star has a place every moon whatever it may be every son of god has a place and when we stay in our places positionally placed dear god then the uh body of the lord can work in perfect harmony father oh lord under the unction and this leading of the holy spirit so father i pray that you would bless these few words bless it to the convention and all those that would hear it father uh lord we ask that you would heal those among us that are in need of a touch heal the sick raise the dead lord deliver the captive father god i pray that you would do the things that you promised to do in this last days father for we believe dear god we don't doubt your word your word is the same yesterday today and forever we ask it in the name of jesus christ amen amen god bless you you may be seated praise be to god let's give him praise hallelujah amen we have a church here on fire amen amen hallelujah and this is why we have the in case it burns down we have the fire extinguishers ready to go amen i love you know i love to preach to a church that knows what they are listening to amen and when the word that goes forth is truth there it is impossible for the believer to sit there without giving a response because you see the word goes forth and the seed in the believer's heart has got to respond with an amen amen because there's a certain sound nothing uncertain about amen the pure word of god so now as we have uh come to this uh convention message i titled my message it's kind of a long title but you can shorten it any way you want the final battle now this is a final battle the final battle is not in heaven that started the whole uh fall of humanity that started the fall of angels we see the final battle against principalities powers rulers of darkness spiritual wickedness in high places and that pretty much covers the entire verse but i wanted to make sure that we understood that this is the final battle the final battle is a spiritual battle we have natural battles and carnal battles where people fight each other and we're going nowhere doing that where we're fighting one another what we have to truly focus in is fighting against what is wrong and what is uh you know an uncertain sound so we realize that uh some uh preachers that are out there today they minister according to their level of faith and they have a certain idea of what the prophet meant by uh when he said this and that the other so their measure of faith said well he meant this another one will have a different measure of faith and said well he meant this but surely somewhere in between there there's got to be the truth amen so god is not interested in your opinion of what he said god is not interested in the other one's opinion of what he said because he he will only vindicate the word of what he said amen because the word must be vindicated no matter how small the word may be there is a spirit and anointing that's following that word to vindicate that word amen as god's word hallelujah is not the words of man it's god's word being vindicated amen and what is the interpretation of the word today the manifestation will be the interpretation hallelujah amen so i don't have to make anything up amen when the holy spirit the spirit of truth the dynamic strikes the church of the living god you will see the things that was once predicted they meant to happen will happen automatically because it won't be you it won't you it won't be you working up the people it will be the holy spirit amen anointing the dynamics anointing the seed bringing that seed to pass hallelujah to the lamb we don't have to force anything amen god will never forget his word hallelujah and right now this morning let me encourage you there are people that are filled with the holy ghost there are people that are waiting on healings there are people that are waiting for a good old-fashioned holy ghost experience right now god is monitoring and looking after that word oh i don't care where you go i don't care you can hide but the word will follow that amen the spirit will follow that word and make it come to pass praise be to god for the spirit always follows the word amen amen that's how he proves his word to be true praise be to god amen but my you know then you have people that want to force some form of vindication and they tried to make some kind of uh artificial vindication but listen what brother branham brother brown said we now have the perfect interpretation of the word with what divine vindication amen divine is from above it's not because the bishop uh confirmed it it's not because the pastor agrees with it is divinely vindicated by an angel amen to be truth thus saith the lord amen which means there's no more argument about that when the word is vindicated praise god amen i was listening to a program on youtube this weekend there was a gentleman i'm not too sure if i i ever heard of him he seemed to be like a southern pentecostal person he he was telling uh his testimony was do not say anything against brother branham he said his he said don't tell me anything about uh against brother branham even though he come out of pentecost his dad when he first uh saw brother branham in one of the meetings in florida amen he was dying of cancer and he was a young man 30 something years old i mean his dad and and this boy who was giving this testimony now he's a grown man he said brother branham prayed for his daddy at 30 years old the doctors had already given him up that he said my daddy lived to be 93 years old not only that but he told my daddy where he lived not only that but he told them where he come from and what he does for a living praise god he said that can only be god for the word of god is sharper than a two-edged sword it discerns the thoughts of the heart amen have you noticed have you noticed amen all of these uh false anointed evangelists they you see it all over spread around amen they have all these oh oh this one was healed some are are put up on the platform to to make an act or act like you were healed amen and you know what it's a strange thing because faith you ever heard the of the old uh pentecostal evangelistic school win the loss at any cost which means essentially it doesn't matter if you have to lie it doesn't have to it doesn't mean if you it doesn't matter if you have to make something up if somebody gets saved you won the lost that was their uh model and they boldly use it many times but you don't see them because brother brown said this gift that god gave cannot be impersonated you'll never see it until i'm gone i'm glad he said until he's gone you know why you'll see it again but it'll be in the bride no other person in the bride because the same word will be veiled in that bride to expose amen and to read the very hearts of didn't peter say the same why did you lie to the holy ghost amen that was a spirit coming down upon peter but now let's move on he said uh this man told my daddy where he's from where uh uh he was going to get healed and he waited and you know the lord will always test you because you're not going to feel well right away in fact many times you feel worse to see if you really believe huh this is why you have to cast down let the weak say that i am strong so this man by the grace of almighty god he's given his testimony and he said you know what is a shame is that his church did not permit his members the members that he belonged to to attend that meeting are you kidding me he said his daddy was sick you can't listen let me just say this you wait to the anointing strikes the church and you see you signs wonders and miracles and you have a bunch of false anointings that don't join that group because they're they're crazy amen and you have a need and you have a need ain't nobody gonna be able to keep people in any barnard church hallelujah amen if you're an eagle you begin to spread your wings amen and begin to fly away you realize that you're not a chicken anymore praise god you changed your language amen you are an eagle you were meant to fly brother you'll see there's coming a deliverance that's what we're talking about now amen the greatest battle ever fought amen not against flesh and blood but god himself is coming to vindicate his word what is right let god let the god that answers by fire let him be the god so the battle started in heaven so how many knows that we're not talking about oh yes about my the battle in heaven we're talking about fallen angels now they're close they're closer they are now your boogie man they're now they're very close to try to make you doubt the word because physically they cannot do anything unless god permits it and if you ever fall into a trap where you believe didn't we hear the tape on sunday the sin of what unbelief people do things wrong because they don't believe it's not uh you can't blame them for drinking and whatever carrying on they're not a believer but if a person who is a believer amen will live the life of christ his motive his objective has been adjusted to please god and god alone amen but now let's look at this as we have 47 minutes left amen very quickly because how many knows that for too long the church has been on the defense we've never really gone on on the on the offense you know we've been on a defense and just oh this one's saying this and that one's saying that and you know what i'm going to tell you something it's just very much like the church in the wilderness brother brohm said they had not even met the enemy they were just fighting among themselves in the in the wilderness what enemy did they face they were busy fighting against the prophet fighting against aaron fighting against everything amen they wanted water amen and they made you see under and and moses was a man see and he was subject to mistakes and he struck the rock two times and broke the tight and because of that he was not permitted to go into the land you see this is why do not ever be afraid of the congregation that you minister to look at aaron look at aaron huh moses went up to get the the word of god and tablet form and all it took for 40 days he left the people down in the camp amen and aaron was looking after them doesn't take people very long to strain huh but what did aaron say and that really kind of surprises me today huh moses come down you know moses was god to the people he was angered and he come down and he asks aaron what have you done well you see the people you see the people do you see why i do not take very well seriously what people think of me because if i do the wrong thing based on the people's desire it'll get me off the word oh the people wanted a god and what did you do oh i collected all the gold and so forth and i what and an image a calf i wonder i aaron should have known better he should have known better and here the people had gone into abomination and all kinds of things and here was the word standing on a cliff amen and the people had to make a decision amen listen the people had to make a decision it's a free uh will decision they could have been worshipping that beast and everything else but if they had repented when moses said who is on the lord's side step over here amen god doesn't care what you did yesterday or the day before he wants to know what side you're in what side you're on hallelujah who's on the lord's side hey amen you're sitting with that false interpretation that idea you see the abominations that's going on and everything else but you can come out of there i'm going to ask one more question who is on the lord's side amen and i could see a handful just a move from one place to the other amen then that move was their salvation hallelujah that move was their salvation and when you see that something is wrong you run for your life amen to what is the word and stand on it amen and moses wasn't concerned about who know no longer who was on the left or who was it right that he threw down the word of god and what happened the word was a divider it's separated the word will always separate right wrong and the word is separating it today same thing hallelujah amen this is there's no there's no funny business amen you come to the word and oh look and live my brother live look to jesus christ and live it's recorded in the word hallelujah only that you look and live look what look to who not to the pastor but to the word when a pastor preaches the word of god and asks you who's on the lord's side either we're going to have a church or we're not going to have a church either you're going to play games with god amen then step on that side but there is a word of god that's coming and it's going to be uh give you a decision you want to play church stay on that side you want to be a real bride of jesus christ go on the other side because the word itself will be the divider didn't god tell gideon take them to the water and i will i will divide them for you there so the pastor is there just to take the the people to the water which is the word amen and then the attitudes then are tested based on how they dream i i like this scripture but you know this one's a little a little hard to drink so i'll put that there they like all the nice simple feel-good scriptures and they but then you have these other ones that just like lapping everything up [Laughter] amen the church was getting small so i want to ask i want to ask today how many are still lapping up everything amen what do you believe i believe everything glory be to god i haven't lost my faith praise be to god i believe amen god god forbid if i should step back and and deny my lord and deny this message praise god amen brother branham says in the in the uh greatest battle ever for listen to this the great hour of charge is at hand amen remember i said we've been on the defensive we haven't we haven't really truly gone out and really uh you know uh do some harm to the devil see hallelujah soldiers with armors gleaming colors streaming faith and doubt is setting you're setting yourself in a ray in this tabernacle right this morning faith and doubt is setting here and there's that you either have faith or leaning towards the faith side or you're leaning towards the doubt side this morning doubt on one side and faith on the other soldiers stand at your post of duty this is why i say come stand at your post of duty if there's a revival going on in the church this is where your post of duty is amen hallelujah our captain the morning star leads on he never goes back oh i love that do you realize that joshua although god vindicated him and confirmed him and lifted him up before the people in the wilderness god had a way of of making the people respect him but yet he had not fought a real enemy yet because the real enemy was a cross to journal now joshua was a man of faith type of the holy ghost we all know that but he himself listen he himself because i want you to understand a battle is not yours this morning the battle is the lord he saw the supernatural he could only see the supernatural when he crossed the jordan he saw a man dressed in us in some you know army gear no doubt helmet of salvation the shield of faith and his sword is drawn listen listen closely he saw the supernatural and joshua being a spiritual man not only a spiritual man but a warrior was fearless he ran up to him and said are you for us are you against us what a question huh i love joshua you for us are you against us oh but joshua didn't have much to say very shortly afterward because he recognized the voice put away your sword joshua you will not have one victory in this land without me because i have come as a captain of the lord's host oh yes you're leading the people the children of israel sure but you better follow me because i am the pillar of fire i am the cloud that was in the wilderness i am the water from the rock i am amen i am that i am i am everything you need amen so i want you to understand follow the cloud you better follow me i am not with you or not against you so here is the question uh when people ask you well what what doctrine you with well i'm with jesus what what the nominee i'm with jesus you know why because god will never truly say okay i'm with you but i'm not with you i'm with you but not with you see it's it's an individual affair and let me tell you how foolish it is foolish if i may say foolish for us to come down in this 2022 and to go around the world or the places that you have been privileged to go you have not traveled the entire world and then you come back to your church and say there's no other fivefold minister unless i have met them know them uh you see so that who puts you in the place of authority to sanction a fivefold minister to say he's he is a pastor he is an evangelist he is a teacher in other words god can do anything cannot do anything unless he comes to you only because you haven't seen you haven't seen the entire world listen i'm going to tell you some god has given me the blessing of traveling around the world and i've been i've been to africa i've been to places remote places humble men of god and i'm gonna tell you filled with the holy ghost i've never met them before but brother they get into preaching and they have a testimony their their their congregations can can uh you know verify everything they have they can't point anything in their life and they're humble and brother they start preaching and heaven comes down the sick is healed praise god the holy ghost pours out and it got me shouting because he he's saying things that i agree with amen because we cannot ever ever ever ever get away from the holy ghost experience the holy ghost today is received by experience have you received the holy ghost since you've had that experience not some intellectual something come to the church put your name on the book don't even come to the altar that you're wasting your time listen you would be you would be blasphemous in the early church put your teaching and compare it with the early church when the apostles taught everybody to repent and to be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the holy ghost by experience there's a quote there brother brown said the holy ghost is received by experience so if the holy ghost if brother branham's holy ghost that he is referring to is received by experience and you must have a different holy ghost that's not received by experience and of course i've heard many of course the the quotes oh the holy ghost without sensation you know that's just there you know brother brown knew what he was saying because you see then he was saying what would you have god doing you know because it takes a sensation to release an egg and so forth but these people they take these quotes only to justify their deadness they don't even know when they receive the holy ghost brother brother joe all goes around all the time and what's up happy bourne day i don't know why he says that maybe that's how he how they do it some others will say it like that we say happy birthday brother if you can't remember your birthday your natural birthday and your spiritual birthday something is wrong because your spiritual birthday is actually more important than your natural one [Music] god is just my belief amen that's just my belief amen there's a pentecostal song they used to say how many knows the day that you got the holy ghost and when i get to your day amen you get up on your feet and you shout amen amen if we sang that in the message today ain't nobody will stand up they would have an idea when they got the holy ghost oh isn't that a shame getting back to principalities listen no man got a revelation from god to preach that the idea came let me just be bold the idea came and the inspiration came from a fallen angel nothing against the brother but against what was uttered by the fallen angel you're not going to tell me that the holy ghost is no longer poured out like it used to be you come too late you come too late for that never change well that's the problem with brother oblater he's so old-fashioned he doesn't change the word don't change the brother brown masses change what we need is god called men to bring amen the landmark back to the position [Music] who moved the landmark hallelujah the bible says don't you move your neighbor's and today our landmarks are everywhere strewned everywhere they have gone past landmarks moved it over there threw it into dumpsters and everything else now everybody can do anything they want they have no restrictions they have no they're out of control why because the holy ghost doesn't control them and if the holy ghost doesn't control them it has to be another spirit well that makes me angry well watch your spirit see it doesn't make me hangry amen i see these things and then i love you more you see because i have to that's my qualification i have to have that or i can never make it to the other side and the only reason i preach this way is to to get you to encourage you to get to the other side amen see the greatest battle ever fought she is going on right in here now yes sir between life and death how many know that so how many expected when you were christian everything going to be all nice and ducky huh no you're gonna you're gonna you're on the verge of losing your house losing your car losing everything else a flood the enemy comes in like a flood amen and gives you mind battles keeps you up at night not wondering wondering where you're going to get the latin the next dollar to to to live and meanwhile amen we are given a type in the bible amen does the birds worry about what they're going to eat tomorrow no sir they take no thought for tomorrow glory be to god and if we trust in god he will provide for you every single he's never he's never failed me yet oh yes i've been down i've been without amen but that's all part of life amen we live in a valley we live in the mountain but we come down but it is in the times of valley where oh is when he holds your hands and when you cannot walk anymore he begins to carry you amen because you trust in him hallelujah that's the difference others will start giving up and say this message is incorrect amen so between sickness and health between faith and doubt amen uh between liberty and bondage the battle is on but shine your spear soldiers polish up the armor amen god is getting his soldiers ready so if he's getting his soldiers ready there's a fight in the horizon god is anointing his army praise be to god i have a few minutes left i'm not done amen yes sir amen so you see i i try to be as clear as i can without seeming like i am a know-it-all because if anybody needs to learn amen and to be humble before the lord is you and i we all need that's the only way we learn is to yield ourselves to the holy spirit in prayer god shows us something and then the whole thing comes together and you see it this dot connects with that dot this the connection that done but when you take i've said this many times before this is a very sensitive issue subject for me when you take the holy ghost out of the church that church dies too bad there's so many demonic blood suckers when they pull the blood out while they're pulling promises out you know that don't belong to you oh really okay then i'll live that much lower below my privileges do you realize that the holy ghost is the blood of jesus that keeps the church clean amen in the natural you have red blood cells you have white they all have they all programmed to seek out infiltrators germs diseases amen as soon as something tries to infiltrate the body a disease whatever it is here goes that blood amen as quickly as it can right down to the invader amen you don't belong here they shall cast out devils the blood does that cast out uh diseases the blood does that praise god is programmed to do that praise be to god and the life is in the blood so without the blood you have no life amen hallelujah to the lamb so therefore without the blood there is no spirit and any religion that doesn't have life any religion that doesn't have a blood you cannot have that man going around walking and acting like he's alive and has no blood that's a spook you know you bury that person you're bloodless and when god gives his blood test his dna test and find you have no blood you don't you you're no part of me because your blood must match his blood and if you have no blood that's the blood test when i see the blood i'll pass over you so therefore i don't understand that doctrine and i hope that it's not too late i'm hoping and praying that it's not too late that people will realize this because a deceiving spirit is a very evil spirit it's a strong delusion to believe a lie in other words they have perfect faith in that delusion you can't move them off of that it'll take the dynamics to prove what is right and wrong and this is what we are waiting for today friends is the dynamics to come upon the mechanics amen there are many many promises that the prophet prophesied amen but yet we can only exchange scriptures and verses and things you wait to the one that that wrote the word manifest that word vindicate that word amen there's nothing else to say amen of course they'll still hate you if they still have an evil spirit because jesus was the word made manifest and they crucified him didn't matter how much he manifested the word they crucified him because they had religion they didn't have the word they had religion amen and the religion was not compatible with the word jesus was the word and jesus if it's not compatible with your religion you will hate the word because it shows you up even nicki nicodemus came by night he didn't want anybody to see him you know and one thing about nicodemus he recognized he was a great teacher in all of israel great teacher he knew he knew the law he said you know teacher we know you come from god that much he knew because no one can do the things that you are doing unless god be with him intellectually he knew he came from god that's the extent of people's revelation in this message oh yeah yeah we we have the truth prophet came from god this minister this pastor whatever comes from god okay nobody can do what you do unless god be with him but here comes the other part of the teaching jesus said unless a man be borned of water and spirit he will never see the kingdom of god then he begins to preach the holy ghost and that doctrine was a hard saying for nicodemus you see how the holy ghost the devil will always fight the holy ghost he recognized nicodemus recognized this man came from god but when jesus told you need to be born again oh i'm not too sure you come from god anymore you see how uh you can get caught up in a doctrine because you're you're involved in a church that is secure in a big temple and so forth and nicodemus thought to himself how on earth can i preach this or how can i understand this there's no way i can go back to the temple and preach this you must be born again are you kidding me i'll lose my pastorship i'll lose my congregation but if he had done that he would have come to eternal life see this is the heart science of the bible and this is why i say we fight not against flesh and blood yes sir the greatest battle ever fought is right before us today and you know brother branham said you have to know your enemy and he he said that i'm just gonna paraphrase that because i'm running out of time and questions and answers he said you have to know your enemy he said when he was an amateur you know he how many know that brother branham was an amateur boxer uh yeah he knew how he knew how to fight and so forth this is why i like that photograph that they had taken and and uh brother billy paul's trying to you know jab with his dad brother branham knew but brother braham said that the only way you can train for a fight is to study the enemy or the person you're going to fight next and then go try to find somebody that fights similar to the to the opponent you're gonna fight now this is the training part the training part is to find somebody similar so now you're being trained now you're gonna face somebody in a ring that has the same style uh just before the real fight so you have to know your enemy so we have studied this enemy for years and years brother branham said you have got to recognize the devil in every one of his tricks and the devil believed me he stutters you every day he stutters you every day he knows your weakness he knows if you go down this street oh you're weak hey he he will wait for you at the end of the street and beat you up he knows if you uh do something that you're not supposed to do in your weakness he's not just gonna leave you there he's just gonna give you he's gonna work work you over that's right and you you get off the canvas and you wonder whoa what what just happened because your enemy is watching [Music] he's watching your weakness you're watching every move the way the enemy studies you you've got to study the enemy you have to study the enemy oh so therefore if you go like this you see i'm not going into boxing i'm not a boxer but if you there are many people who actually look back at videos and see a boxer has a tendency of leaning this way so that person who is going to study for that fight or rather going to fight that boxer next he's going to wait for that person to lean this way and guess what when he leans that way he's ready for the punch amen he may have listen he may have won many fights doing this but there's coming a time somebody recognize your weakness and you get beaten up now what are you gonna do stay on on the on the canvas god has no quitters no no no and believe me i've been on a canvas many times and if you're honest you'll say the same thing oh yeah on the canvas many times but that is the training so if if i tell you don't go down this road because there's a pothole on the end of the street with a big spike sticking up you're going to get a flat now you can choose to listen to me or you can yeah you're right boom your your tire gets blown out don't don't come back to me and say oh you never you don't know what happened i know what happened i know exactly what happened i told you not to go down down that road and you did what else you expect oh but i got a really bad flat tire i told you you would have a bad flat tire [Laughter] people don't listen they don't listen they bless god who does he think he is telling me this that the other and then they have to learn by experience oh they learn by experiencing the next thing you know but i am going to just go to this other quote because i'm i'm running out of time god bless you brother uh brother ovid the the convention down there i trust that you're being blessed this is the way i minister to our church amen hallelujah i want to build them up into faith because a fifo ministry is to edify the body amen and i'm going to tell you something is not man appointed is god appointed for god has put in the church some apostles some teachers some evangelists and the fivefold ministry has nothing to do with man listen if a man gives you a gift he can take it away if god gives you a gift it is there forever that's the difference look at the teachings you hear today oh this man was a great evangelist he's no longer no longer how can he not be any longer who took it away the lord has chastened me sore but he has not given me unto death amen i still have a voice and i still have a a message to preach [Music] thus saith the lord this message is thus saith the lord the devil didn't give it to me and the devil can't take it away hallelujah to the lamb amen i'm going to tell you something my boat was was to sink long ago but is out to sea by the grace of god amen hallelujah doing my best to tell the world that jesus is coming telling the world that seven thunders give faith seven thunders is a bride's revival you want a promise for the rapture that is a message glory be to god i believe that i believe that because brother branham said that and i have to echo that back because it's not my words i'm a a true fifo ministry can only echo back the original word now how many remember brother brown i'm talking about six seconds smith do you remember six seconds smith we were talking about sparring or you know let's stay on the on the boxing uh realm here a second and then we'll we'll move on to something else but listen six seconds smith who was six seconds smith he too was a boxer and he said brother brown uh said that he would uh train with six seconds smith but six seconds smith the reason they call them six seconds smith is that six seconds smith didn't waste much time in knocking you out and i'm going to tell you something don't need much time to knock somebody out off to work so he got into the ring with six seconds smith and six second smith was built a certain way i think brother brahms he's an ugly man but he amen but he knew how to fight and he punched hard amen where brother branham was not protected he said one time he punched him in the stomach he almost like lifted him up off his feet aren't up against he's at six we're just sparring but you you're gonna kill me he said don't worry i'm doing this for a purpose you've got to learn how to take the punch there's a lot of people who don't know how to take the punch don't complain about oh god i'm like i'm i'm leaving the ring you're playing unfair listen the devil don't play play fair he's there to kill you with the first shot if possible but what we have to learn brother bram said is to be able to take the punch he said you know because the stronger and the harder i hit you your body goes into a shock and if you permit it and just let it uh do what it's supposed to do it'll bounce back see where we're made before the foundation of the world to bounce back from every shot the enemy has amen because greater is he that's in us than he that is in the world so i'm going to tell you something the greatest battle ever for is laying before us but b prepare for some hard shots amen and that'll separate the men from the boys amen the boys and all i can't take this no more i'm going to quit maybe i'm out of my field i'm not a boxer i'm not a son of god you know so do you think that god called you a christian life is not an easy life a christian life is not an easy one you walk out of this church and you're gonna fight the entire week coming and the entire week the next but greater is he that's in you and god is training you to be able to take the shot the heart of the shot it's not how many times you fall it's how many times you get up that's right as long as you get up the fight is not over hey man some people some people give a person a shot oh yeah he started to celebrate meanwhile the person got up and he's ready to fight again hallelujah i've seen so many wonderful clips where boxers are down for the count they come back and knock the other person amen reminds me of a true believer so therefore don't you think that in this last days when i'm here here's what i'm going to say and say heart shots you know what hurts the most is people you know huh people you less expect i thought we were friends boy you hurt me god's just testing you but we're we're brothers and sisters yes we are but why did you insult me in that way you know you see that's a hard shot when your emotions get involved with you see but now we have to raise up above emotion amen because it's not personal it's spiritual battle they say these things remember people exchange words because they are anointed with evil spirits to hurt you and let me tell you something if the devil knows something hurts you enough don't expect it to be the last time it said to you because he knows that hurts you and the devil is just so evil in that fashion until we can grow up into a statue of the fullness of jesus christ getting back now to what god wants us to be faith virtual knowledge tempers patience godliness broly con stature of a perfect man now that message brother brown titled it stature of a perfect man but there's a great mystery in that message that man brother branham said this is the man that's going to be in that eternal church age at the end of the seals so therefore their strength in that message you have to be able to know how to say you know i forgive you that gives you victory the victory when you when people shoot you down say i forgive you i still love you wow you just gave the devil a knockout blow because i'm going to tell you something the devil has no concept of love no concept of love i mentioned this before and as crazy as this may sound listen to me convention trinidad i've heard people i mean this message is more divided than it was that it ever has and we claim to believe the prophet's message this bear is repeating because this is something i heard and it's sad there are people i say preachers pastors the lord has revealed to me that we must be separated no fellowship on this side we'll fellowship for a thousand years when we get to the other side does that sound like an uncertain sound to you there's no talking now that and you're going to try to say that we'll fellowship for a thousand years on the other side you better pray you make it to the other side now this sounds crazy but this was verbatim i i think a person like that should not be behind a pulpit a person like that is dangerous a person like that is antichrist well that's strong words you see but if god if the devil can separate and divide the people of god that's the strategy called divide and conquer i have you speak against this one and that one against that one this one against that one this and something that happened without i mean you know several years ago and you never forget it and it's as fresh in your mind as it was the day it happened um they didn't want nothing to do with you now they don't want to talk to you or fellowship with you or anything however we'll have plenty of time to talk on the other side don't you understand that brother abraham said nothing but perfect love will make it there and as we age i realize i'm getting older myself many other ministers that i associate with and their people of age and so forth listen i don't want to find myself coming down to the end of the road where i can where i can't talk to everybody and anybody i don't have to agree with everybody because you see everybody has a measure of faith you see measure faith measure whatever but this is why we have that uh spirit of truth that will detect what is right and wrong but it doesn't it's not remember it's a spiritual fight it's not against your brother it's not against your sister see people are anointed because the fight is now on the earth amen but one thing for sure the bride is becoming the word and the bride the womb has already been closed it's too late satan the word is in the bride so therefore there's nothing false nothing else can enter into that bride it will be rejected because she's already impregnated by a genuine word see hallelujah to the lamb praise be to god so i thank god for the fivefold ministry amen who are the fifo ministry not only the ones i know or the ones i can remember there are plenty people out there that is anointed and perhaps more anointed and more qualified than you and myself praise god i've never heard of them whatever but when they come together they have got to say the same thing amen getting back to paul paul was converted he wasn't he didn't wasn't converted by any man he wasn't ministered by peter or james or john whatever hallelujah he met the pillar of fire and he and this is in the bible for a reason amen he said i did not go to jerusalem to consult with with peter and all the disciples up in jerusalem in other words he didn't he didn't he didn't have to receive their teaching that way because god wanted to prove something amen there's only one spirit of truth and paul amen being a learned man and god knew that he had to be the apostle of that age you know why because he not only knew the law the letter but he came in contact with the grace of god so now with his understanding of the law he could uh also unders uh understand that jehovah of the old is jesus of the new hallelujah amen he could understand that amen he took the law and converted by revelation amen and put the new testament into place glory be to god but he said i never i never consulted with anyone and brother abraham said after a while when they finally met eamon paul and the rest of the disciples what were they doing they were preaching the same thing hallelujah and that is the same way that the holy ghost works amen maybe you may have not visited every single country in the world but god has his men somewhere he doesn't need you to teach them he will learn by the spirit of the truth praise god the dynamics oh hallelujah amen praise be to god i'm so thankful amen i'm so thankful the greatest battle ever fought amen but i'm going to say this in closing amen that greatest battle over fort we love our brothers we love our sisters however the devil has infiltrated uh you know the message stay with this word amen stay with the word stay with this message malachi 4 is already vindicated praise be to god oh you see and one thing that really does offend me i'm going to tell you something is another thing that offends me is that oh yeah what the brother brands message is old-fashioned now we have we have something different or new let me just let me just say this this bible this bible is version amen 1.0 amen the first version of it it's perfect this bible does not need to be upgraded what version of upgrade do you have two point or is it now 666 i don't know this version of the bible is what i believe there is no update in this gospel no updates well bless god you see i was sitting in the room and all of a sudden god gave me version 3.0 false what you received is a virus in your computer watch it you receive a virus that actually begin to work in your system and change words and do everything else and misplace the word of god and misquote the word of god and you go out and you preaching that uh version 6.6 whatever it is and then after a while you add it all up there is no promises to preach it they stripped you off the holy ghost they stripped you of the dynamics to the mechanics amen they strip you of everything one last thing god knows i am a firm believer of the holy ghost by experience and here i i will close with this have you received the holy ghost since your belief any message any minister who cannot preach that same gospel the way it was preached on the day of pentecost the way it was preached by brother brennam uh i feel sorry for you i'm praying for you every single day i'm praying for you and
