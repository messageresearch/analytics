for his August presence this morning if I buy Bibles will in turn to reapportion scriptures and this morning zechariah chapter 4 wanna read from verse 1 to 7 ezekiel chapter 9 you want to read from 1 to 6 and first Peter chapter 4 want to read verse 17 to 18 a full speeders up the phone reading from zechariah zechariah chapter 4 1 2 7 and the angel that talked with me came again and weak me as a man that is weakened out of his sleep he said unto me what she's done and i said i have looked I'm Huell a candlestick all of gold with the bowl upon the top of it his seven lamps there are seven pipes to the seven lamps which upon the top there of two olive trees buy it one upon the right side of the bowl the other on the left side of the pool eyes so I answered and speak to the angel that talked with me saying what are these my lord then the angel that talked with me answered and said unto me knowest thou not what these be and I said no my lord then he answered and speaking to me saying this is the word of the Lord unto Zerubbabel seeing not by might nor by power but by my spirit saith the lord of hosts who are the whole great mountain before the rubra beldo shall become a plane and he shall bring forth the headstone thereof with shoutings crying grease grease under it is iike chapter 9 and he cried also mine ears with a loud voice saying paused them that have charged over the city to draw near even every man with his destroyed weapon in his hand I behold six men came from the way of the higher gate which lied towards the north and every man a slaughter weapon in his hand and one man among them was clothed with linen with a writer's inkhorn by his side and they went in and stood beside a brazen altar and the glory of the God of Israel was gone up from the chair whereupon he was to the threshold of the house and he called to the man clothed with linen which had a writer's ink one by his side and the Lord said unto Him the Lord said unto him go to the midst of the city through the midst of Jerusalem and set a mark upon the foreheads of the men that sigh and that cry for all the abominations that be done in the midst thereof unto the others he said in my hearing go ye after him to the city and smite let not your eyes spear neither Javie pity slay utterly all and young both maids a little children and woman but come not near any man upon whom is the mark and begin at my Suntory then they begin are the ancient men which were before the house or last script I read in assam for speeders after for over 17 for the time has come that judgment must begin at the house of God and if it is first begin at us what shall the end be of them that will be not the gospel of God and if the righteous scarcely be sealed where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear let us pray father we thank you for your word and we talking to the Scriptures being read and I and I pray or take me out of the way and circumcise the hearers of the word circumcise my own heart I mean your torch drop down Lord and speak lip to hear to your people even as your promise that the spirits and a bride will speak the spirit come upon the bride and speak the world and the world will hear direct from God may the believers hear hear direc from you this morning granted Lord in G Sam I ask at a man you may be seated or praise the Lord don't know how many of you have heard Wednesday night service if you have no good Wednesday night service go back and listen to it and I know something that the Lord give and I believe it would bless you the angel from the east having the seal of the Living God this is not more brother and special minister or bishop or whatever it is this is the Holy Spirit go out see the name Joe so this morning of an inspiration of two scriptures sort of context scriptures this from acts 19 and I want to read it and he came to pass that while Apollo's was at Corinth Paul having passed through the upper post came to Ephesus and financed certain disciples he said unto them have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed and they said unto Him we have not atmost heard whether there be any all he goes so this was a new thing altogether they haven't heard about this thing called Holy Ghost and when he said unto them unto what will you baptize this another John baptism and he's then paul said john verily baptized with the baptism of repentance similar to the people that they should believe on him which should come after him that is on christ jesus when the here is they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus and when Paul had laid his hands upon them here we go the Holy Ghost came on them and they speak with tongues and prophesied so this all he goes not a imaginary thing it could come on you it could come into you it could fill you Oprah do believe that it's not a explainin ting explain your habit already and no no we not explain all of that this is what he will say so I mean the poor laid his hands upon them I went poorly upon them the Holy Ghost came on them and they speak with tongues and prophesied on the other script I have is Matthew 5:6 from in the scripture blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled not educated not informed not to bring at the booths they shall be filled who's gonna be filled those who hunger in and to stand after righteousness so the title this morning is sealed O's that cyan cry that's the title is warning sealed O's that sigh and cry you know Jesus said as one of these a sudden man switch be come in and they eat they drank they bought his soul and different things like that normal living different nothing Lucas up them that happen no they eat it drunk is soul but luck was luck was called out and when luck came out fire fell so you can watch the skies and the can watch the Sun on the moon and you can't watch or the grass growing and and corn barren and you're getting fruit and someone harvests it can't just watch that you have tours you would you have to focus on what God said and then you could get clarity of what is happening this is the easy thing to get you tune in to yellow oh praise that do you believe that oh praise the name of the Lord but Abraham we've seen newspapers the uncommon storm when you go home tonight do me one favor don't go to bed till I read revelation the 8th chapter you would see the uncommon plagues and storms that is to hit the earth and thunders and lightnings are they gonna shake the heavens wars are going to pass over the nation man will rot in their flesh these either will strike them that the doctors knows nothing about but remember before that took place there was a ceiling man thought not Titian ceylon that that angel and the plagues was commissioned by God don't come near any of those who was the seal in their forehead and the seal of God is the baptism of the Holy Ghost it is not join in church it's not who your pastor is it's not what church I go to the seal of God is the baptism of the holy spirit Ephesians 4:30 says grieve not the Holy Spirit of God whereby you must sealed until the day of your redemption so no matter how hard the a crock no matter how many times the lightning struck close to it Ten Thousand shall fall on your right and thousands the on your left but it shall not come nigh D the Holy Spirit do you believe that shall not come nigh thee amen Oh glory to God so when I'm on that lost he will do anything when a man get lost prophet described man get lost in the forest they will make circles and they would be scrambling because you can't find your we lost a man lost some God he will do anything hallelujah and when you lost you need a guide somebody to guide you out of your lost condition you can't find your way back out that's why I see pastor delenn Oh glory to God a sheep have to be led they gonna have Shepherd to help direct sheep and a guy has the understanding how to go on what to do and God has always sent a guy to his people God has never failed he sends a guide but you got to accept that guy all glory that God sends us a guide to guide us we have got to follow that guy no matter what we think what looks reasonable and what looks ridiculous we are not subjects to divide and that the God is only one I think some time ago as a Christian a message about a guy in Africa and the people were lost sitting and he said I'm the honey man cuttin grass and they see more following him they say but horn only way he said I am the way that's the man territory the man nor the bush inside out so he know where he's going the man who follow him don't know where he's going and looking like there's more bushes seen as he cut any cutting he cut any whoa oh you know we're going away I I am the will you just have to follow me and you will get out your condition that you're in because we're every situation is away the every situation is a mind of God your situation is not unknown to God before you're gotten it God saw it and if God saw it there must be a way out of it because you don't ever give you more than you can hear if you feel you under pressure you will see nothing yet you may be seated beep again frightened same as you know if you figure you under pressure know you se not near pressure is yet to come pressure going to rock the world pressure gonna rock nations governments mindedness is right no pressure rock in China or glory they've got everyday the content that numbers ability a closer look at the virus and so on every day is special you know it's challenging kingdoms and and put intense as all the super power and super bodies what are they just drop let the angel come and just drop it like that rain is god you're playing super power you're playing a powerful God to bring it down to zero or get the Lord a shout glory to God hallelujah I am God and I changed not we going to prove who here Oh glory Tonya saw a vision ahead of coal and all the other structures coming right down to iron and clay and he said I Daniel saw a spoon cut out without the hands of man walk low and shut the image and that image came tumbling down man's Kingdom must fall and we ever see this morning Babylon is fallen is fallen confusion is fallen we are not confused or glory to God we are not confused we know where we are going Jesus the way confusion patient confusion messes in the confusion but the bride will not be confused because God sent us a guide Oh glory to God hallelujah colleges continue hallelujah so you have to follow the guy no matter how ridiculous God in the Old Testaments and prophets the will guides because the word of the Lord comes to the prophets aha so the Kyle is a prophet right and the cat is also the Holy Spirit man shall live I better loan but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of these guides so go ahead guys through all the ages Oh glory to God the word come directly to them not the wood of a Lord come to this one and that one the word Allah comes at a profit and then under that prophet speak back that same word or glory that God because God sent one guy to the edge ooh no guide or give the Lord a shout one guide not a guy and a half not a guide and his son one guy one message one message a mother in you this morning not tree informat one message it unless interpretations but there's only one message even as there is one Lord even a service one said even a service one baptism or give the Lord a [Applause] halleluyah halleluyah hello million on a small if I guy doorguy Julia seven stars in his right hand seven men seven eyes and those eyes look to the ages and each generation they don't have to be here to see what the Cedars speak and what the speakers have put it in a book write it but you could read it that you could run in your generation or glory the war when Danielle was watching the prophecy written by Terry mad a prophet and saw the thymus at him he's I Daniel read by books he's sort of the thymus at hand for something to break what are you reading your books do you understand what is at hand are you gonna sit there as if nothing has happened Oh glory to God hallelujah you can't do that too late for that Oh glory to God hallelujah thank you oh Jesus let's continue go to your Testament send prophets they were guides because the word of the Lord come to the prophets they were guides no people stop reading the prophet birthday and listening they just listen to preacher listen to this one but this is the Prophet that so you know you know is the wood of promise I committed to excite Santelli I dream and tell you untie a magazine and tell me what Putin doing and what China doing and I know all them you could read that too you don't meet the companion explain it you're gonna need papers and you're gonna internet on and see what you're doing but but but but but but you see this year this is dusty at the Lord [Applause] sometimes if I say what I'm doing I'm not even doing that but you see this air got a light when you're here from this year you came to scare the Lord I can bring up my feelings my feelings could lie I can't bring you my dream my dream could be a life but this is no lying I could make mistakes I could be off and wrong but this can be wrong heaven I will pass away but this one will never pass away your favorite and I tell your husband to lie to you but God will not likely [Applause] [Music] let's continue they were guides profits the instructor the people as we had last night of Isaiah Isaiah they were instructed and they instructed the people and guided them and know God has always sent his guys he always never been without a guide all through the ages God always had somebody that represent him on the earth in all ages and sometimes when they get off the guide or off the beam as we would call it when Jesus was young good we'll remember geo certifiers is you blind guides you blind guides blind to spiritual things they were supposed to be guys guys to the people guiding the people to salvation but Jesus a Ukraine he said let them alone for if the blind lead the blind portal fall in the ditch plain guys how the world has been contaminated with that blind Gaiden and God sent a prophet in this nighttime to bring light that we wouldn't stumble in our steps once you're any ain't anything troubling to come back to a spoke one book or spoken one tip you'll know you're here just say the Lord other than that it was gonna be in your Baptist Church it was gonna be in the Catholic Church and your Anglican Church but God pull y'all to that to bring light to you like that your church but you come on Olaf did not have so you can go that one can you have to know you can go back every day has to be one step closer every day has to be one step less okay the Lord has show one step closer God sends a guide and God want you to remember that he's appointed guide we must remember him here it says Jesus said I will not leave you comfortless but I pray the Father he will send you another comforter and this comforter when he was to come was the guidance to all truth and the Word of God is the truth and the word is Christ I'm the way the truth and the life he is the world isn't that right and when the churches today reject how can we ever expect to go to heaven when the Holy Spirit was sent to us for a guide we will take some Cardinal some bishop some general overseer or somebody like that to guide us the Indy 500 it's a fight for in the body and 500 to anybody if I fall in the body are men who are baptized by the Holy Ghost and placed inside are they're the ones who who have outsid buddy they're just men with gifts but no power and the Holy Spirit always speak the word I've got many things to tell you you can understand it no but when he comes he will guide you to it and there is where he brought this coat that's the reason the common of the seals at the finishing of the seventh seal the mystery of God shall be finished to know who God is what he is how he lives his nature is being you supposed to be all the way up there by that time oh my into bring us into the full stature of sons and daughters of God a church that's washed in the blood of Jesus Christ bought without money paid for by the blood of Jesus Christ oh my hallelujah the guide knows the way he knows every inch of the way he knows every quarters in your heart he knows everybody that is here he knows who you are what you have done all about you he is course guide the Holy Spirit and reveal things to you and will tell you things that he heard he can repeat your words right back and say what you said tell you where you have been what you've God what your greater going all glory to God your car the clothes on that guy that guy to tell you entire life well glory I've got what you have done I want you wanna do what you're doing now the Holy Spirit will never make you say Amen to some kind of man-made Creed it will only punctuate the Word of God with an e men because the Holy Spirit will not lead you any other way all glory to God so you could only confirm the word when you hear the word your spirit your heart you say Amen so you see you need a guide he will guide you to truth and the truth is the world and it always has been God has never had to change nothing cause he's infinite and he knows what's best he is omnipresent he's omniscient his God is not right and the Holy Ghost a guide is the confirma of the world that he is teaching so if the Holy Spirit is teaching he confirms the world that he is teaching this he doesn't confirm it then something wrong with it but he's the consumer of the world he is teaching or glory to God and Luke said Luke was led by the guy to say go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved he does believe it not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them that believe what was it science following what was it the guide vindicated that was to do truth that was God's policy that's the Whitley done that's his program it can change from it because he's infinite he can change from it he is God I can't I can change I'm a man you can change your man the woman but God cannot change I am finite I can make mistakes and say thing that is wrong the whole that is how did that compare to all these ministers with more mistakes I made like if they absolute how does this you know what a professor you know I am finite I can make mistakes and say things that are wrong no it's easy if you're sitting on a rock

bigotes he's just a man or give the Lord a shout yell or Saruman he a no angel man he's just a man or get the Lord a shout we just make big mistakes somebody talk attainment see the wrong thing treat

that brotherly love that's how I know you're about to be born that's how I know you're about to get a breakthrough you will feel a different atmosphere around your life because you supposed to be pregnant with God and any sin brought after comfort there has to be the spirit of forgiveness because faith to get what you need miss unforgiveness [Music] God is not gonna leave it because you're feeling the guy here I see it again God is not going to heal you because you feel him to get healed God gonna heal you because of your feet the one where the bloody shoe I missed in a minute I don't know what I'm going here I'm here she was not baptized believer she actually airing shattuck keeping the toes sassy ban wrong she foot she has a normal woman with the blood issue but she told herself she care for this man from Galilee she a bore this little young Messiah this rabbi and people being here she polis her if I could just touch the hem of His garment and a physical condition at that time Sheena seems the poster cornea man to touch him but she says is that I'm gonna touch the hem so she knows she's bleeding she knows she's not supposed to go near there but she come because she had a need and she decide to press so-called press that's what people not doing enough person you're staying in a condition but you're not pressing this woman know how money was running out maybe you are too much I'm money maybe that's why you don't want to be ammonia to run out you go when you have money as do all kind of thing you know oh yeah when ammonia's mixed that because you have did money when the money ran out staggering out to well her money ran out and she tell us that this is it this is it this is it and when she came to the meetin the press was around Jesus I want is a press critique she had a choice today is dumb ideas I went back home the same way I came same way I came I going but because maybe next week might have a smaller service and I could get access to Jesus a little better not that woman she came determined it was already in our mind it was ready in our heart she had an attitude some big guys wrong the periphery of this whole struggling Jesus she said excuse me the money move she push I mean portion man was moving all in focus on Jesus Kohi preacher she pushed him she gets you this one she judged if I get you down that Amanda he's smaller not that one cause you push through a big man she pushed again Oh glory to God maybe she had a hand man maybe she saw she hand back to some leg she's excuse me my handbag she push it she has to get nearer maybe she do that three four times when she gets he backs his choice I get me shaking this thing working just joy to the leg accent excuse saving handbag and keep moving forward she's getting nearer some element on the leaf some of them just come to here they have no intention of the unchanged but she wants a transformation she want a miracle she want a healing and she told herself not if I hear him but if I touch the hem of His garment so she is saying after get right up and touch battery or glory glory when she reason and she touch him so she just you know put Jesus said who touched my clothes [Applause] did you get that immediately she will be for Channel and Africa were preaching ready be careful to the edge preaching the birds wouldn't sometimes feel scary so I preach another I don't mix I go to close down cuz I'm gonna grab your foot I don't watch I don't know what that supposed to be doing but when that woman touched him Jesus said who touch my clothes Peter said anybody touch which was true that cinnamon thing he said but no offense virtue somebody made of a draw [Applause] something leave the bank some money leads the bank somebody made a withdrawal you begin to look around for who who made our job then he saw the woman is you it's you as you as you Isuzu then then he didn't say he didn't say my virtue he'll do you know he said your faith come on now come on out - oh he did not say my foot you healed you he said your faith because I said fear to pull down and withdraw the virtual look where theaters after faith is what or give the Lord a shout hallelujah so once they comfort you can pull them virtue Oh glory give the Lord a show and if you can get virtually you can get knowledge you can get temperance you can get patients you forget colonist you can get brotherly kindness hallelujah understand [Music] [Applause] ah blu-ray [Applause] [Music] what you think what do you think your heart had to be to him back to feed for to pull long this this capstone another say we write at is wrong but the cup of perfection which is the power of love after come the seal the brand I was trying to wrap up here time is a long long time my voice hasn't gone like this but let me just continue here right now this water was stopped listen to what went on at a deeper level we know what one let me tell them they and so on but at a deeper level 1933 God gave but abandoned seven visions which he said must come to pass before Jesus come again the seventh vision is when America was bombed up we not even short of America making the Tribulation Period bombs all over America America destroyed listen to what he said the he said the world went to war 1914 never been peace peace since constantly swinging and swinging and swinging and they are doing it the very same thing yet and what was their doing talking about the injured whole then he said Oh God have mercy hold him that great thing that I saw in the vision the whole thing becomes the destruction wall in the atomic hole in the wars that they don't destroy themselves until the thing come to destroy it until is returns back and gets himself with together and then the message will go to Israel and she be sealed with the seal of the Holy Ghost after the Gentiles is called out the people for his name's sake will be called out which is this age right here now then Israel only receives a tree and a half and six-month message so Israel only Akira half years left for message with Moses Elijah those two lamps those two standing by the lamps those two trees it's not right more than Elijah just tree a half years for them the Gentiles you and I it is called the times of the Gentiles it is called until the fool of the Gentile come in we have no specific time the Bible talked about we call it the times of the Gentiles until the fullness of the Gentiles come in so in other words once this come in and the seal of God begin to be applied to your heart and life it is over this book is then closed so you don't have all the time to mix that because the slaughter in angel is next after the ink one writer went forth first with a commission to put a mark upon those hallelujah not upon those who say in the message not upon doors going to church doors have certain characteristics that scient I that means the burden go on beyond you it can be selfish for this thing you you see what is happening you know you need a manifestation of God you need a fire you live in a life without prayer you're ready for no revival yet when you begin to pray your Nori's I will come in when you begin to pray you more power comment when you bring underway your healing coming you can't live without prayer let prayer become your life you have no job did job coming because you're praying you want to increase in pay you increase coming because you're praying seek first the kingdom and all other things will be added rich you will be added deliverance will be added more money will be added you want more cars or my house what are plenty after give [Music] [Applause] listen let's continue Elijah and Moses returned on preach to the Jews two men anointed with that spirit isn't that right and then about a third of the earth was blown to bits at that time until it of the earth shall be listen for these foolish virgins if that man with the ink one writer was the Holy Ghost we realize everybody reads the Bible so is the same angel coming again with the Holy Ghost the last enemy the last plague that struck the earth was dead and the last enemy that's gonna strike the church snow is that strike the what judge dead spiritually speaking those who will not follow Christ and the baptism of the Holy Spirit will spiritually dry up and die the churches you can see it now oh my you say are you a Christian that's worse you see I'm a Methodists are you a Christian I'm a Pentecostal that don't mean more no more has been a big or hug or horse that has nothing to do with it let's say it this way are you a Christian I'm in a message are you a Christian i fellowship in my brother Ovid that is same thing are you a Christian I belong to this tabernacle in any question are you a Christian well my father's de pasta I'm the pastor son it's quiet in here that's good I want you to think because you have to answer the question are you a Christian yeah that's bad you are you are you a Christian when you are born again and filled with the Holy Ghost not until that but I thought all and you are yielded completely to the spirit that's not all if you are not yielded to the spirit then you're not born again and you don't have the Holy Ghost you might speak with tongues and Shiva and jump and run Paul said I can move mountains with faith I can heal the sick have knowledge of the Bible I can do a seminary learn all this stuff and I'm nothing yet so he said a monk a doctor fulfilled in this message and still nothing you have no love you have no charity I'm a big ministry revealing mysteries from heaven from below from on top from beside from everywhere else in the book OD book I'm still nothing he cannot immeasurably thunders device he sees he was your world his son with trumpets the millennium the new city before the beginning - he got my eating could bring like a picture like it's like a movie I'm still nothing that's still on the knowledge so this is a little more than all of that that we have to press forward for and he gave the description of how charity would charity suffereth long and is kind is not puffed up it's not easily provoked beareth all things believeth all things hopeth all things and joy and all things they asked whether Branham but a brother why is you go among their people and you know what they believe he said knowledge to know what they believe I don't know it is in the heart temperance with them patience hoping someday they see a new light if for the light Oh hallelujah so he is showing these virtues is operated in him to go among people not like him don't believe like him don't agree with him he could still go Jesus was invited to Simon house everybody come into those houses get get a foot wash because that a donkey Missoni grown and you know to attend us and whatnot everybody getting treated right perfumes Cologne good foot wash nice robe they let years come in normal normal normal Jesus 4:30 is for smelling not dirty smelly and then they said oh no big coach and chair what is grunting so he would stick up in here for the embarrassment and God want to bust him guys want to bust them bishops I'm faithful in that they want them so everybody they drinking nice and they eat a nice and it dependent bread and it's done what another thing like that a woman who said she got at Horace because she see Jesus with dirty feet and she gets in a Horace because she know that that man have something more than their mother fellows with a nice Gong and the clean foot and the well polish shoe she know that guy has something more than that and she pulled with her own sins but she got a burden for him with that dirty feet I when she said I remember how bad she behaved at how she left she started crying and she moved and went past the bunks the bones are even watch when she slipped she made a little more to make a nice little pass him Mikal mover on him and she gone by GCSE that I cry and she's had a cry and thicker here and said a wipe his feet on what his feet Jesus I say nothing and Simon am si not but thinking something so they're saying it but they thinking it the thinking if that man only knew the kind of woman that did he wouldn't let her do that go right now we dip in it or we go put it on Facebook we go let you all know what going on with that man and that woman and Jesus just s see nothing and when she finished and sometimes God let you go through stuff and don't you say a word but when you're finished he's going to break the silence over your life don't be afraid because he is silent don't be afraid to service for Jesus to service for the Lord music um a please listen Simon have a word for you I come in here nobody wash my feet I didn't ask to come you invited me to come this is how you treat me this woman who sins are many you heard that she she she oh she was forgive me enough when a woman here that all that is rather it's time to tell everybody you know I am forgiven I am free I am free I am free it's time for you to get free free from your pass free from your sins free from your fears Oh glory to God hallelujah thank you Lord Jesus thank you Lord Jesus hallelujah hallelujah glory thank you lord what go to the rule to zalem and see you don't seal any of them but then that tsiyon cry for the abominations that done the city how Gaga C Lea - listen a husband and you in church and you hear in the word you expect what to see you you have no seeds again you're rude yeah one to answer back on and talk on a confusion oh well we'll see later you gossip in God could Selah the backbiting go could Selah the jealous God could see let God Casilla yes I see a suru silent grand oh my hallelujah you say I'm a Methodist I'm a Baptist so what difference does that make I'm in the message this is same thing he said not that constant Boonton for the loss he said that sweetness don't never let anything rise up and put bitterness in your soul no matter how bad anybody ever treats you or anything don't never Pro be guilty of letting nothing anchor in your soul it will grieve the Holy Spirit away from you so what are long people the sittings beatings hate and whatever it is he allow them he's not destined Danny Testim you don't let that tanker your soul you want to be available to the spirit you want to be available to fate or glory to God hallelujah glory to God amen praise God just wanna get one spot here when God spoke and made man man saw was lost anything outside of that join in church is highly Breeden God's got to speak that word back again that makes it likely Atilla and when God speaks life into you then that's eternal again and when God speaks here we go and places the Holy Spirit in there and sees it it's eternal oh my so when God's check the boxcar which is the busca of your life he found it in anything loose inside idea and when there's nothing shaking inside idea you are then sealed until the day of redemption he said God come along to find a lot of foolishness in us he just don't see it yet he sees a lot of unbelief he just don't see it yet Oh glory to God so here we go and one the church itself when it strikes the power of God the baptism of the Holy Ghost out of the nominal churches it's normal us now out of the Catholic Church otama in a message now wherever it is when the baptism of the Holy Ghost is made real to the people when them that are predestinated like you people here they tell you life ceases and walks on it it's a super sign it has to be made real to you you mean this Holy Ghost yes for you to be baptized with the Holy Ghost yes you're not contented just to be the message no you want the real thing Oh glory to God and he promised we know that the scripture say that Jesus is the chief Cornerstone he also as a headstone now if we will remember that the 70s messenger was to restore the faith of the churun back to the father's in other words rebuild it again under the power of the Spirit Oh glory to God I wanna my good there are some prisons [Applause] whoo I know I jump in this listen to this no in this rupture in time there will come a time know that this bride Whittle that rejects the head part of the bride so it should be this church that rejects the head part of the bride will have to suffer for her rejection because the gospel wasn't made plain to them back there it's painful to you today see it was made clean you done all these years and examples the season so he's saying there will come a time when the head part will be rejected and the people that reject the head part will have to suffer the head part is the headstone the head part is the capstone the head path is a dynamics Jesus is the cornerstone he is also the headstone and he was a cornerstone of what the early church our church he comes to keep off the breath so therefore you have to go into the pyramid that your prayer may be capped off you yourself has to become a pyramid and he come into the cap to your pyramid the individual pyramid so you have a promise of him coming to you or glory to God quickly now after the brothers wrap that is a question answers will any of the foolish will be saved or we'll all be lost he said will the fully be saved no whatever happens no after that time she she fully version will have to go to the Tribulation Period and the reason for it is because she has rejected the atonement in its fullness and I was they believe pastor the message not all the message or glory record what she is a believer a professed believer but she will have to go through the tribulation period so you don't want to be a professor believer you want to be a believer with the proof possession not a believer with the profession did you get that you want to be a believer with the possession you actually have a possession not a profession Oh glory to God hallelujah my god here we go under the bomb I'm gonna close when the spirit falls not if Saul taught whether that mean it comin nobody can stop it if I die it's still coming all glory to God is this just fall apart and blow up it's still coming nothing gonna stop this when the spirit falls there will become a move amongst the people the bride had another revival yet there have been no manifestation of God to stir the bride he will send it he promised it the spirit will fall and cause a move among the people them denominations will swing together a certain as I am standing in the pulpit and the Church of God will be on stood they will make such a racket unclear they will Confederated I put a boycott on anybody that don't belong to them when Lazarus was raised from the dead you know what they say we have to stop this man the whole world going after him the miracles be from the small ones right up the Lazarus raised from the dead but that was the capstone manifestation of Jesus ministry which was a resurrection and everybody knew that Lazarus was raised from the dead that is when the Pharisees and the scribes and the Sadducees came together and this hydrant council to stop the word made flesh or glory regarding that same they're gonna happen when the holy spirit falls and the sons of God come at the manifestation or glory the court the church people in the message will reject the bright people in the message and then the government will come and sit on it or glory no God remember remember is not Caesar that condemned Jesus was the church folks that brought Jesus Jesus the Caesar and when they said this is your king to say no we have no king but Caesar they went political also or give the Lord a shout Oh hallelujah the religious folks condemn Jesus which was the word made manifest and what did the Prophet said I'm gonna close this then the phone fault with the man who was the word nor they gonna find fault but the word working to the man or glory to God so the prophecy hanging over your life is this word that you hear in all these years the secret is and word is in the bride who are going to come with that super anointing and quick and that word on you and start the word the word in you your life will be changed your life will be transformed your life will be anointed there's a lot better let's all
