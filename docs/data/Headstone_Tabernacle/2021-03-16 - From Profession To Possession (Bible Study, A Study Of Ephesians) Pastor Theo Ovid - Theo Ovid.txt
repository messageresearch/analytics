they feel but as you want them to get it lord from your word your truth how you speak and how you deal with your people in times past i know you'll deal with them again father take me out to the way god this thought has been right at me since november last year and i never really get to it and i pray that you would inspire it or hearts in our lives in jesus name i ask it amen god bless you thanks for being here tonight we appreciate you taking this time off to uh be with us in this bible study and tonight our title from profession to possession study of ephesians from profession to possession and um before i get where i want to go i want to start here this whole field let us start tonight from first corinthians chapter 10 so we're going to run through some scriptures tonight in the bible and we go just look and we want you to to take this tonight not as a text not as we just read in scriptures but how god deals and how god speaks you know a lot of times i we would say people use the god of their own imagination what they think god is or what they feel god is but god is the word and when we go to the bible we see clearly his thoughts and his intent and this is what we want to look at tonight so we want to shake off our feelings tonight and just hear the word as the word and believe the word to be god speaking to us tonight first corinthians chapter 10 reading from verse one moreover brethren i would not have that he should be ignorant at how all our fathers were under the cloud and all passed through the sea and were all baptized under moses and the clouds and the sea they'd all eat that same spiritual meat and they'd all drink that same spiritual drink for the drunk of that spiritual rock that followed them that brock was christ and verse five and with many of them god was not pleased for they were overthrown in the wilderness we're going to come back to this verse here for now these things were our examples to the intent we should not last after evil things are they'll also lost neither be the the idolaters as was some of them as is written the people sat down to eat and drink who's up to play neither let us commit fornication as some of them committed fell in one day three and twenty thousand neither yet let us tell christ some of them also attempted and were destroyed of the serpents neither ye some of them also murmured and were destroyed of the destroyer now all these things happen unto them for example and they are written for all admission admonition upon whom the ends of the world are come wherefore that in that tinker they stand there take heed let's see four they are no temptation taken you but such as is common to man but god is faithful who will not suffer you to be tempted above not able to that they are able but will with the temptation also make a way of escape that you may be able to bear it so therefore this scripture read here two highlights here the verse five but many of them god were not well pleased and they were overthrown in the wilderness and verse 10 needed some of them murmured and were destroyed of the destroyer and based on that we want to go to numbers chapter 14. now this number chapter 14 this was just after they said in 13 at the ending and we saw the giants and the sons of enoch which come out of the giants and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers and so were we in their sight this is where they painted their own pictures and believed their own pictures the pictures that they painted the giants didn't see them they saw the giants and they saw themselves as grasshoppers and it's terrible when you see the wrong pictures about yourself to get the right pictures you have to see what god say about you not what your neighbor friends family anybody see but what god say considering you and you know this after they brought this evil report in chapter 14 the bible speak about the congregation lift up their voice and work that night and all the children of israel murmured against moses against aaron and the whole congregation said to them would god that we had died in the land of egypt or would god be had died in this wilderness and wherefore had the lord brought us out into this land to fail to fall by the sword and our wives and our children should be a prey wait not better for us to return to egypt and they said us let us make one captain and let us return them unto egypt and then moses and aaron fell on their face before all the assembly of the church of the congregation of chain of israel and joshua the son of nun and caleb jeffrey which will of them that switch the land rent their clothes so these two brothers joshua and caleb their behavior is completely different they are in anguish to see the people respond like that they are ripping their clothes they they say they speak unto the company of children and israel saying the land which we pass through to search it is an exceeding good land now i am seeing all of this because this story of this land is a shadow it's a type what we are entering into is the real land this here in type was a natural land and he said no verse eight if the lord enlighten us then we he will bring us into this land which and give us it give it us a language fruit of milk and honey only rebel not against the lord neither fear ye the people of the land for they are bred for us their defenses departed from them and the lord is with us and fear them not but wisdom but all the congregation made stone with stones and the glory of the lord appeared in the tabernacle of the congregation before all the german israel here it is these bunch of people two million people they didn't walk to egypt by their own strength goats and moses moses plagued pharaoh with with flies and frogs and lice and everything else it was all supernatural here it is the people know is that it's a mighty hand brought them out and they journeyed and here they are willing to stone willing to get captains to take them back to egypt and here all of a sudden all of a sudden a glory come down i mean that that had to be some type of experience that would be shaking every man dear that supernatural glory coming over the camp and the lord said unto moses how long will this people provoke me how long will it be here they believe me for all the signs that i have shown among them remember who is speaking here now he's not a man he's not an evangelist he's not a pastor this is god speaking to moses i will smite them with the pestilence and disinherit them and will make of thee a greater nation mightier than deep so god was telling moses i'll flatten this old bunch i'll get you a new book i'll disinherit them and moses said unto the lord then the egyptians shall hear it but thou brought us up this people in thy might from among them and they will tell it to the inhabitants of the land for they have heard that the lord are among these people that dog lord had seen face to face that thy clothes stand over them and that thou goes before them by daytime in a pillar of cloud and a pillar fire by night now if thou shalt kill all these people as one man then the nations which have heard of the fame of thee will speak saying because the lord was not able to bring this people into the land which is swaying to them therefore he had fleeing them in the wilderness so he was presented to god it will show up that you are weak it will show up that you're short on power it will show up that you do have the ability to bring these people out and now verse 17 i beseech thee let the power of thy lord be great according as though i've spoken saying the lord is so long-suffering and of great mercy so moses is begging he's pleading forgiving iniquity and transgression and by no means declaring the guilty visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children and upon the third and fourth generation pardon i beseech the iniquity of this people according according unto thy unto the greatness of thy mercy and as thou has forgiven these people from egypt even until now and this is god speaking back now and the lord said i have pardoned according to thy word but as i truly as i live all the earth shall be filled with the glory of the lord because all these men which have seen my glory and my miracles which i did in egypt are in the wilderness and have tempted me know these ten times and have not happened to my voice surely they shall not see the land which i swear unto their fathers neither shall any of them that provoke me see but my servant caleb because he had another spirit with him and had followed me fully him will i bring into the land where unto he went and his seat shall possess it let me just pause here one moment god highlight a name that name is caleb the prophet said that that caleb represented the true believer in the last days that was david joshua the holy ghost just represents the holy spirit his servant killed him because he another spirit with him had followed me fully and i would bring him into this land where where unto he sent it verse 25 now the amalekites and the kindernites dwelt in the valley he said tomorrow turn you and grow you into the wilderness by the way of the red sea and the lord speak unto moses and aaron saying how long shall i bear this evil congregation which move against me now i want you to think redemption will get on it later on is in two parts okay coming out of and going into this is gorge people there is not egyptians these are jews these are children of promise and god is saying how long shall i bear with this evil congregation which movement against me i have heard the murmurings of the children of israel which they move against me say unto them as truly as i live saith the lord as you have spoken in my ears so will i do to you and this is prophecy your carcasses shall fall in this wilderness and all that were numbered of you according to your whole number from 20 years old and upward which have murmured against me doubtless you shall not come into the land concerning which i swear to make you dwell therein see if caleb the son of jeffrey and joshua the son of none but your little ones which you said would be pray them will i bring in and they shall know the land which ye have despised but as for you your carcasses they shall fall in the wilderness and your children all this is prophecy now because of the behavior because of the reaction because of unbelief prophecy coming to them of judgment first territory and your children shall wander in the wilderness 40 years and bear your holdups until your carcasses be wasted in the wilderness after the number of days so god making a match now after the number of days in which you search the land even 40 days each day for a year shall he be your iniquities even 40 years and he shall know my breach of promise i the lord have said i will surely do it unto all this evil congregation that i gathered together against me in this wilderness they shall be consumed and dear they shall die and the men which moses sent to sister land who returned and made all the congregation to mumma against him by bringing up a slander upon the land even those men that did bring up the evil report upon the land died by the plague before the lord but joshua the son of nun and caleb the son of jeffernaire which were of the men that went to christian land lived still and moses told these saiyans unto all the children of israel and the people mourn greatly and they rose up early in the morning got them to the top of the mountain and said lord we be here and we'll go up to the place which the lord had promised for we have sinned and moses said wherefore now do you transgress the commandment of the lord but it shall not prosper go not up for the lord is not among you that you be not smitten before your enemies for the amalekites and the canaanites are dear before you you shall fall by the sword because you are turned away from the lord therefore the lord will not be with you what they presumed to go up into the hilton nevertheless the ark of the covenant of the lord and moses departed not out of the camp and the amalekites came down and the canaanites which dwelt in that hill and smoked them and discomforted them even to homer you see because they know they are god's people or claim to be god's people and they feel that god is still with them with all the misbehavior and carrying on and moses tell them no good luck with you the behavior you're what you're carrying on with don't go up they went up and they got blows and i want to assure you then that so many people in this message take things for granted take the message for granted take um they leave the prophet they believe the message of the hour and that looked like an instant ticket to glory instant ticket to where they think they're going but friends if we take in this bible by bible word by word verse by verse line by line it's not really so it it has to be the word there's a narrow way and that way is the word so if you're still there with me and rider with me let's go to hebrews chapter three and let's read from verse seven hebrews chapter three and let's go to verse seven for scripture reason tonight and um verse seven of hebrews chapter three it says here wherefore as the holy ghost today if you will hear his voice harden not your hearts as in the provocation in the day of temptation in the wilderness and this is god speaking when your father's tempted me and proved me and so my works 40 years therefore i was grieved with that generation no now you're getting god's feeling about the issue you're getting a god's feeling about the behavior of that generation of people that was called out by a mighty hand bear in mind that the people was in bondage for hundreds of years until they begin to cry for deliverance until they begin to cry for breakthrough remember god heard their cries and i want to assure you and encourage you to keep on praying because god is hear your words god is hear your cry when god came down to moses he said i have heard the cries of my people and i'm come down you say when your father tempted me and prove me verse 9 and so my works 40 years wherefore i was grieved for that generation and said they do always er in their heart and they have not known my ways so i swear in my right they shall not enter into my rights take heed brethren take heed brethren least there be any of you an evil heart of unbelief in the pattern from the living god but exhort one another daily while it is called today at least any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin aha so now we get a different picture now we see a heart issue where hearts could get hardened by the deceitfulness of sin so take heed brethren verse 14. for we are made partakers of christ if we hold the beginning of our confidence step fast until the end i want to pause on that verse here we are made partakers of christ if conditional if we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast until the end so it's not who start is who complete this race it's who finish while i just said to dave verse 15 if you will hear my voice had not your heart as in the provocation for some when they had heard did provoke probably it not all that came out of egypt by moses but with whom was he great 40 years was it not with them that had sinned whose carcasses fell in the wilderness and to whom he swear he would not enter into his wrath but to them that believe not so we see they could not enter in because of unbelief let's read that verse again so we see they could not enter in why because of unbelief and now from there we go to hebrews chapter four let's keep continuing let us therefore fear least a promise being left us of entering into his rest any of you should seem to come short of it for unto us was the gospel preached as well unto them but the word preached did not profit them not being mixed with feet in them that heard it for we which have believed do enter into rest but he said as i have sworn in my rat if they shall enter into my rest although the works were finished from foundation of the world for he speak in a certain place on of the seventh day on this wise and god did rest the seventh day from all his works and in this place again if they shall enter into my rest seeing therefore it remained that some must enter therein and date to whom it was first preached entered not in because of one belief again he limited a certainty saying in david today after so long a time as i just said today if you will hear his voice have not your heart for if jesus had given them rest then would he not afterwards are spoken of another day there remained therefore arrest to the people of god for he that is entered into his rest he also shall see some his own works as god did from his here we go verse 11 let us labor therefore to enter into that rest least any man fall after the same example of unbelief so i think some time ago i think i gave a bible study on god in your heart god in your heart that your heart and behind guiding your heart from one belief guiding your heart from sin and david said i would have hid in my heart that i might not sin against thee and so this is the backdrop now and going into the thought and verse 12 of this him he will say for the word of god is quick and powerful sharper than any twitch sword piercing even to divide an asunder of soul and spirit joints and marrow and the design of the thoughts and intents of the heart so this is where is our backdrop and this is where we're going to go into from a profession to opposition a study of ephesians now understand this that and we're going to read it ephesians parallel joshua when you read joshua you read ephesians you feel ephesians remember joshua moses brought the people out but joshua took them in the same thing that brought you out is not going to take you in i'm going to read it for you it takes a power it takes something more so moses ministry was to get the people out but joshua ministry is to get the people in let's call moses ministry a word ministry the word ministry the shout get people out of your baptist methodist pentecostals your witness whatever background or whatever you call out to believe a message entire message but joshua which is the type of the holy ghost just your ministry is what going to take you in bear in mind redemption is in two parts coming out of and going into many people come out they nice groups have nights pastors nice churches but the question is have you gone into now coming out you were coming out based upon a confession of faith based upon a confession of believing god believing god said a message of the allah and this is what you believe is where you're standing for your name is on the book but profession and possession is two different things let's say for instance day one coming out of egypt and an egyptian speaking and talking to a jewish brother and say brother what is this about where you going that brother could say oh god kept his word he sent moses we are god's people i'm a jew i'm going to the promised land now all this testimony he's given and sharing he is not yet in the promised land he is on his way and until you reach he is still journeying i'll say it different i'll say this way two million people got books and tapes and tablets and everything on the message of the hour that moses brought in that day but god had to send two million and gave out to two million people because out of the two million people they are two people that are going to really catch it which is joshua and caleb so let's go to joshua chapter one the people have come out moses is now dead and god is about to make a new move another move a different move moses was the law joshua represent grace moses was like the word joshua represent like the spirit joshua chapter 1 we read now after the death of moses the servant of the lord it came to pass that the lord speak unto joshua the son of none moses minister saying moses my servant is dead no therefore arise go over this jordan dull and all these people unto the land which i do give them even to the children of israel note the bunch of unbelievers that was in that group fell after 40 years god make them make circles for 40 years so they're dead now so what joshua is dealing with now is the children of those those so-called believers all right who's three every place that the soul of your foot shall tread upon that have i given unto you as i said unto moses from the wilderness this lebanon even under the great river the river frities all the land of the hittites great seater was the going on of the sun shall be of course it shall not be any man able to stand before thee or the days of thy life as i was at moses i will be with thee i will not fail thee nor for sickly be strong of a good courage for unto this people shall thou divide for an inheritance the land which i swear to their fathers to give them only be those strong very courageous that thou mayest observe to do according to all the law which moses my servant commanded thee two hundred turn not from it with the right hand or to the left that thomas prosper within server though goes this book of the law shall not be part of thy mouth that thou may meditate during the night that thomas observed to do now what's the action words this book you'll meditate on the book not every bible study day not every sunday no day and night that you may observe to do so the only way we could know how we are pleasing god or how we could be god approved is if we meditate on the word dear night to what that you're gonna get good success that your we could be of prosperous so that means god is interested in your you being successful and god is interested in you being prosperous let me say that again god is interested in you being successful and you being prosperous and you being blessed but it's according to your taking in that word and medicine in that word remember as a christian you are not you are under a different covenant you can act like unbelievers and and do and carry on and expect to get success like oh you will have success your success comes by god and his grace and his presence and his blood have not i can manage you be who is nine be strong and have a good courage you're not afraid neither you know dismayed for the lord thy god is with thee where the sovereign alcohol is and now we're gonna read ephesians chapter one so we're switching from joshua and we're going to ephesians one and we're going to take it from there and this is chapter one of ephesians if you want to turn the bibles together praise the lord this is bible study so you have to have a bible nearby praise god paul an apostle of jesus christ by the will of god to the saints which are at ephesus to the faithful in christ jesus so now we're going from land old testament physical land and we're going onto the spirit around now land of ephesians grace be unto you and peace from god our father from the lord jesus christ blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ what bless us with all spiritual blessings and heavenly places in christ according as their chosen him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy without blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he had made us accepted in the beloved in whom we have redemption to his blood the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace wherein he had a boundary towards us in all wisdom and prudence having made known to us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which had purpose in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in christ both which are in heaven and we shall on earth even in him in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who work at all things after the council of his own will that we should be to the praise of his glory who was trusted in christ in whom also he trusted after you heard the word of truth the gospel of salvation in whom after you believe you will see your glory with that holy spirit of promise let me read that verse again visiting in whom you also trusted after you have heard the word of truth which will become what your profession the gospel of your salvation which we will be your profession in whom also after you believe which is also your profession after you believe he was sealed with that holy spirit which now becomes a possession watch which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the precious possession under the priest of his glory so that holy spirit what he's talking about seal but is he down payment which is the earnest of all inheritance god say hold that more coming all that blessings coming all that big inheritance coming a huge portion of heaven awaits thee hold that a donkey men are earnest opposition and there we go no well he was saying no notice blood redemption brought them out of egypt blood redemption brought them out of egypt nowaday they had to have something else now to take them on over into the land now they are just beginning to start they come out they begin circumcise come under the blood on the match they had got up to something my he said they they were going along and he said they were coming up and difficulty begin to rise here comes fira army pursuing them troubleshooting listen god is all refuge and strength a very present help in a time of trouble and moses said to the people fear not i love that after jesus rules from the dead his words will constantly fear not and that's what the trouble with the church today is scared to death you're going to make a failure what can you feel when you're in christ you can't fail you've got everlasting life and all demons in hell can't shake you you've got everlasting life jesus said so don't be scared you said well i'm afraid i'll get fanatic here let's bomb here i'm afraid i'll get a fanatic i'd rather have a little fantasticism than to set still and do nothing hallelujah could be given the lotion prisoners on that one he said he'd rather have a little fanaticism and sit still and do nothing and i i i subscribe to that greatly so i prefer to have some shelters and some worshippers and some people who want to run all the pew and run lunches and come back up i prefer have that don't have people just sitting down dead i give the in some jehovah witness kingdom hall or let's continue joshua here is a book actually wow glory so this book we preached on about two weeks ago that was sealed written within and sealed with seven seals this book keep popping up in different types shadows joshua here is a book actually it's a book of redemption old testament joshua we would have to consider it to be that the book of redemption and redemption has two parts redemption anyway has to pass that is out of and into it take two parts to make redemption out of into and the thing of it is it's not out of one doctrine and into another doctrine it's not out of one belief and into another belief it is not that because when jesus rose from the dead he worked with his own disciples and he had some hours with them sharing promises from the old testament to set them up to be on the expectation for their own inheritance which is the promise of the holy ghost and he told them i will not if you comfort us they're gonna comfort you i will not let you leave you as orphans but a little while the world see at me no more but you're gonna see me so he himself was telling them i even as the word with you have to move aside so i come like moses and i am moving away that joshua could come now and take over and joshua will be in the upper room joshua will divide the pillar of fire and give each one of you a lick joshua will divide and give you your portion if i don't go the comforter will not come but branham said some things like this is if i don't let go this first pull the second pull will not come if i don't let go the second pull the turtle wouldn't come there are certain things we have to let go or give up to go to the next stage of your life moses ministry had its time moses ministry as powerful as it was one of the greatest prophets that walked the earth yet it had its limit and when he came to his end joshua was next to take over so this book of redemption and don't forget that now it so i want you to be stood up in your spirit to go into i want you to be stood up in your spirit to press into i want you to be stood up in your spirit to labor to enter into that rest you see some people are comfortable that they come out they are not catholic they're not baptised they're not deceived they're not pissed they're not that and whatnot they're all where they're not but they are not yet where they're supposed to be so that is where we cannot just sit back and relax tonight we have to press on brethren he said joshua here is a book and it's two parts we said that moses represent the law which brought them out of egypt whereas joshua represent greece which took them into the promised land no not by might not my power and the headstone will come with shoulders of grease grease onto it the rubber bill but that's on the book of zechariah no the prophet said this if the power is to come among the people it wouldn't even be their prayer it would be the grace of god no does that mean that we wouldn't pray no you're praying more than ever but he is saying something it will take grace to take us out so therefore he says here moses represent the law which brought them out which is the word whereas joshua represent grace that took them into the promised land let's look again closely in the new testament when jesus came on the scene what about all those beautiful sisters who was on the scribe and pharisees what about mary magdalene what about the woman of the world grace is what pick up these sisters grace will pick up fishermen and drunkards and sinners grace jesus didn't go to the temple of describing pharisees and work with them and call them he went and take tax collector and so on and you wonder how he could choose these illiterate people these poor people this distressed people but he did the grace of god and the fact that the name was on the book so he said the law brought them out moses that was moses and joshua took them in it also represents something for our day now it represents as they were in a journey coming from egypt into the promised land so have we come out of the world of egypt chaos on our road to the promised land and then he quoted my father's house and he mansions and so on now the law brings us to recognize we're wrong and it's grace that forgive us the law no hope of redemption but to complete it it has no grace in it because law only points that you're a sinner but grace tells you who how to get out of it the law is the police man will put you in jail but redemption is the one who come and paid your fine out of into out of into the law said jail the law say adulterer your fornicator your liar this whatever whatever that's the law but grace come to pull you out of that could we give the lord some praises for his grace tonight oh blessed be the name of the lord thank you jesus thank you for your love lord thank you for your grace so he said now ephesus we find out the old testament i think the book of joshua fitz is a fitting word for it would be the book of ephesus of the old testament the book of ephesians of the old testament is the book of joshua so this whole story that we are sharing is is ties in with the seven seas book written within the backside seal with seven seals you see you see by the scriptures tonight is not all who came out or i should say this way all who came out did not go in it's not he who starts not he who believes is not he who has a profession but he who has come into a possession how many assad tonight how many seen that tonight oh god i want you to see tonight it's not good to have a book and say i believe what is in this book this book is a pointer this book like a map then this book is to lead you to a literal treasure this book is to take you to an actual position not just a confession right now we have a confession right now we have a profession right now we have a belief but the reality is we disbelief or profession have to take into possession so let's say for instance after 200 years of crying out they say deliberate come and deliver coming let's say they have two or more years to go they keep believing they believe in they believe it it happened here or they're coming finally moses was born so that was the fulfillment of scripture messiah was prophecy he's coming he's coming he's talking about messiah so long and one day jesus was born messiah came whoa we talk about dynamics for years thermodynamics people mock people laugh people find that you know there's another public show and a bride called a sign and a bright not in sodom and the bride the sun and some mountains somewhere like abraham all the nice types it looks good but the fact is abraham had was to wait for his dynamics to change his body that he could have the baby so all the talk about eva on the backside and he was elected and whatnot that old man cap produced so old woman syria capitalists were challenged and when he said i will return to d according to the time of life in other words god came up with words to tell him a comment to come i'll come to tell you i'm coming in otherwise i come to tell you by words that i'm coming back again in power so i come to see you down and give you the assurance that your 25 years of believing this promise is not wasted oh glory hallelujah i come to bring a fresh comfort to you i come to to give you a fresh anointing i come to raise a standard to give you assurance next 20 days time of life sherry will come into our cycle again hallelujah the egg will drop down and say we'll conceive oh hallelujah so think about god come into earth to show us clearly his word of promise all the old testament characters all the old testament believers all their belief and and their behavior is for our examples to whom the ends of the world occur hallelujah oh give the lord some praises i want you to see the word as god not your feelings not what you think and you know i think it's supposed to be so no forget how you think it's supposed to be well um you know i don't see it so i never see it so no forget how you see it they will go tell moses amen oh blessed be you love him tonight oh praise the lord so watch barbara he said what we need is a revival we put corn plasters on take them off another corn plaster take it off we still find the pain is there what we need today is that social regeneration it is not intellectual talks what we need today is that old-fashioned god-sent blood transfusion from heaven the corn plastics won't do no good we are anemia we need a blood transfusion we need to come back to the old-fashioned gospel that calls off a repentance before god and not yes and not a dry-eyed hand-shook profession but a god-sent holy ghost revival with the possession of the cleansing of the blood of the lord jesus christ into every human heart we need a revival to start in the church and sweep the nation across we will die we will perish we are gone without that type of revival oh glory to god but branham what is sin he said many people think smoking cigarettes is sin it isn't many people think that lying is a sin it isn't committed is adultery that isn't sin that is attributes of unbelief the reason you do those things because you are unbeliever the only two things that is you are either a believer or unbeliever if you are a believer you do not those things if you do if you if you do do them i i don't know what kind of profession that you have but if you do that the love of god isn't in you the bible said so we have got too much a profession without a possession of it too many seeing are not living it i think even we have too much practice on silence and not living enough sermons it would be a lot better if we lived our sermon each one of us would be a minister it's better to live me a sermon than preach be one the bible said you are written epistles of god rid of all men so it's best to live is sinner now you say i've typed it with joshua you notice israel was brought up out of egypt three stages of their journey one stage leaving egypt the next stage was the wilderness the next stage was cana three stages leaving wilderness canaan leaving next stage wilderness next stage kena then he is drilling down now canaan does not represent the age of the millennium it only represent the age of the overcomer or the dispensation of overcoming because in canaan they killed and burned and took cities there will be no debt in the millennium or this is beautiful so all of a sudden you begin to show this promised land this land of ephesians are battling it have fight in it now if is the age of the overcomers it also means that is the age of the test don't miss that now if this is the age of the overcomers it means this is the age that we will be tested because the only way you could overcome is not if you're sitting in church every day i want you to think about that if we have service seven days a week and people sit in that tabernacle seven days a week and they don't have time to even say lucifer or see anybody at all then overcoming that is becoming part of the church like a church most that is not overcoming i remember in the early days either go to church monday wednesday friday sunday morning sunday evening little church i say oh gosh i ain't have time to meet the devil at so much in church if you get so churchy fight you imagine they got a good death but you see it's not church church it's a place where you're hearing the word you're getting equipped you're putting on badge and boots and and everything else you get to equip the face out there when we see it for its reality we would enjoy the fact that we are being tested we are being tried and we are called to overcome so in this battle you slip you slide you get back up you fight you get wounded you come back and fight you're not stopping because the land is yours you're bruised you're battered you're you're terrorizing your mind you feel like you want to give up you can't take it no more you get frustrated they get fed up but there is no letting go there's no giving up there's no giving up and that is why when it comes down to you it becomes very hard because when you get further and deeper in the revelation of the word and on god it never really feeds onto the picture it's not lucifer again with you it's not you devil stopping you and fighting you no you and you you becomes the enemy you becomes the great issue your challenges your demons your private devils and and influences upon your life you you are the person you know you become your the greatest enemy at any time you're blaming others and pointing external you're in trouble because you're far from where the battle is you see because you have to come to the place where you have to see yourself at the cross at the cross on the cross you have to see yourself dying out in truest sense before you take the beam off your brother eye you have to get rid of your night before you condemn this one on that one you have to be hateful towards your own sin and your own failures and your attitude before you blame others before your jam others they deal with you get yourself and then you become alive unto god this is what this is all about a real self-crucifixion and um i was thinking something and i just made it in and on free premier come up on friday about you know the the extra oil the extra oil also represents doing something extra and i believe that the wise virgin will pay that price and the reason i'm seeing that is because when the foolish came to ask for oil the y says go to them that sell in other words go and pay the price the price that we pay it was too late then but it means that the wise virgin will prepare to do something more than the regular church members the rise virgins was able to get empowered with the word that could be turned into oil and this is where you as a christian can't just be barely making it you have to succeed you have to strive you have to take your land you have to come into a possession god didn't told joshua like a lucky a lucky pill whole pin to get through you see every place you put your foot that is yours no if you look at it closely joshua have to put his feet foot it wasn't profession by binoculars possession by binoculars it's not just one a mountain and he's looking yeah boy looking good looking good i've seen it oh yes what a word i never see it so yeah yeah yeah you never see it so but you're still at the one possession you follow him saying well yeah see that sunset on god's head every oh don't you go in on your son this is not going down but your foot didn't move yet that line is not yours you know until you see the need of a holy ghost experience a holy ghost possession a holy ghost baptism a holy ghost anointed it takes you beyond the letter of the word it takes you into real christianity understand this let me just back a little bit the disciples that was anointed with authority from christ he placed an anointing upon them uh saved this way a temporary anointed and they were preaching the gospel the word and christ now devils even there was fleeing from them and they were very happy about it it's like quite a new experience just that i'm doing rejoice for that i know all the guys that delivered yet he said you couldn't even have or you would get trouble all by yourself for that piece of anointing on you he knew their idea you know that because without anointing peter denied christian all that gospel he preached and think peter bolt that nature you know the divers with all the anointing they had a whole lot gospel preaching when jesus died them fellas in them went back fishing normal normal normal italy leave them he didn't go on and so let's go back to square one but jesus knew that they was gonna get something on the inside not mental not intellectual not informational not something to repeat to say you know what i believe this little i believe jesus no no he said you shall receive p-o-w-e-r power after the holy ghost come upon you this was the final anchor to the seed that was in them this seed was always in peter this it was always in james and i said tonight the seed is already in you the holy ghost come to the seeds of god that's what you are that's why you are here tonight because you are seeds of god you could be back since you could be wounded seeds it could be like a wounded eagle you lost some feathers some animal put a bite in here and half your fur is gone but they go grow back they call your eagle yeah i mean kentucky fryer because another chicken yeah yeah ego you call for something higher and that is what you are here for so i want to encourage you tonight you know that this would really mean for you to come into opposition and i'm seeing it more and more oh god want to adopt his sons he want to give his son power but he cannot get power without character this is your old point you see weapon america they put a man the previous president a man you know he might have this in mind the man is what the man is and they put him in power and i mean american in a real condition now and you know what is unfortunate so much blind christian so-called christians was behind that thinking that that is god and this is the lord and whatnot i mean go go raise up pharaoh and put fear on goku do we business you understand but the thing about it power belongs to god and god once shines with character and this is why it has been so long like daniel says the vision was true but the time was long we have been waiting a long time but we're still waiting because god can't lie and what god promised we have to see it materialize in true manifestation well let me hear the worms here now all right said that another thing it brings justification by faith believe in moses one egypt signification following the pillar of fire torment now what is the land promise to the new testament believer okay so we said the old testament what is the land promised to the new testament believer i fight for ministers a bunch of men no a man from america was the land promised the promise here we go is the holy spirit and then he quotes scripture you see it has to go back to the bible it shall come to pass in the last days i will pour my spirit upon our flesh your sons and daughters shall prophesy upon my handmaidens and my man's servants i poured my spirit and they shall prophesy and so on and so on and peter said repent every one of you and be baptized and and so on did you notice here we go joshua this is joshua before they close jordan so now another thing comes to equation now not only have they come out not only there's a willingness journey but now we end up with this thing called j o j-o-r-d-a-m jordan jordan people would like to talk about it they like to talk about when the press comes down but you don't pull them like a bit of soul they're looking for any press to come now no jordan they're not given power but no willingness you know jesus he he when he received the spirit his dynamics in fullness he was led by the spirit into the wilderness to overcome the lust of the eyes lust of the flesh and the pride of life so jesus knew he he he he he have the devil on the iran jesus knew the devil had nothing on him he couldn't tempt him with lust in the flesh he couldn't break him up with the rest of the eyes and he couldn't destroy my pride of life the last one is very dangerous all these kingdoms are mine i'll give it to you you don't have to go to calvary it's okay because just preach mysteries you don't have to die you have no cross they have no cross no dino just pump that wood and you will be fine jesus said no he was ready to go for you and i to pay the price and if he had a price to pay if he suffered we have to prepare to pay that price i guess you know sitting on the bench and and i'm highly bride and then catch phrases i give i mean that you know you know be our ide i i the i the bride i talk i string it all i talk it doesn't have that general sense it has this being when it's completed in this is the servant of god in a church of god it's going to rapture and that being is faith virtue knowledge temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness cut by charity that being when it's completed and we're going to rapture when you look at it closely am i frightened a little bit no i don't know necessarily when you look at it closely the rapture not coming for you you know the rapture coming from what in you he called it a magnet he said you have to be magnetized to the headstone he said you have to be magnetized to the holy ghost the rapture coming for something that could pick up with it you know like when you're magnet a big magnet to pick up all the iron filing all the little nails and things because there's some magnetism in it so you have to go in the rapture is that in you because when the magnet of the rapture or the magnet of the dynamics or the magnet of the capstone when that sweep over it picking you up you you can't help it you know you you hitting a channel you you're going right up because you have the magnetism of the holy ghost notice the holy ghost the holy ghost amen my lord my lord so there are three stages of the journey treats rages joseph by faith forsaken the land of egypt then sanctified through the offering of his blood washed from our sins that's and you'll become a situation so that journey wilderness is where god stripping sanctifying testing there was a shortcut to walk to the promised land but god was concerned if they only discovered a shortcut any issue come in that land they will run back to egypt so god said you know passed through the wilderness it's better for your spirit it's better for you to get purged and get sanctified and get cleaned up so then that journey or offering of blood washing more sins become a pilgrim sojourners claiming that we are seeking a land a city that's coming onto our promise so that's the believers uh when they come they first recognize their favor as a sinner then they come by the washington water by the word justified by faith and then afterwards now he said you become a journey a surgeon and a pilgrim that is why it's very sad when people give up on the journey then because yeah richie promised yet he's on a journey to what a promise that god made see after me a promise that god made that is what you journey into you're not journeying to sani grande you're not journeying to some church your journey into a promise that god has made here we go israel had not yet received a promise but they were on their journey oh hallelujah please understand and that is where you pilgrim and nazarene holiness and whatnot fell because israel when they come to this spot of kinishbaniya when the spies went over and said the land is great but some of them come back and said we can't take it because the cities are walled up and just one kilo said we are more than able to take it oh my he said watch something now so what they they too went over to the promised land had brought back evidence it was a goody land and we are more unable to take it because it was god's sponge then instead of people here we go there we go stay with me instead of people going on receiving the holy spirit speaking their tongues you know if they start to speak in tongues message they will say is then the gosselin but that's part of it too speaking in tongues receiving the power of god the baptism of the holy ghost signs wonders miracles they felt it would break down the tradition of doctrine and what happened to it they perished in the land that's right but the believers here we go as you the caleb and joshua outfit that was going on to the promise they moved over into the land and took the land here we go and settle down in the land as a possession oh glory to god give the lord a shout tonight they went and take it over set along in it and take it as a possession let's go to the new testament now let's go to peter okay peter denied christ cry ball he run hide and everything else okay he hit up a room holy ghost hit peter peter said these people are drunk as you suppose well the brandon says lucy for the devil when they reported them imps sent a report down to hell that peter and them just rejoicing and carrying on he said please kind of they were excited forget them all right now what the devil didn't understand then was it wasn't excitement it wasn't just emotion peter actually came into a possession and that possession was evident now listen carefully when peter gave this sermon and said um repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of jesus christ that is the word you see no evidence of possession yet i just saw man that i just were there's a man talking on a platform but when he went to the gate called beautiful and saw that man that was crippled that everybody knew was ripple and he said hold a book he said come on yeah tape he didn't say that he didn't say that he said silva and gold have i none what i have i am not i don't have a profession oh glory olive feeling i feel inspired right now i don't have a profession i have a possession and what i have i can give now listen friends you cannot give what you don't have sometimes we demanding of people they give us what they don't have some people deceive they think they have it and they don't have it they have it again a lot of ministers a lot of the churches they think they're so on i gave you the only group only man only place that is foolishness the what we have to get what prom is it that is why you're not afraid to preach it i didn't promise it is god promise it listen these people didn't accidentally promise land you know what abraham are giving you that land you want that and your seed that is the land for them we didn't ask god for holy ghost promise we didn't ask god for adoption he made that promise and if he made that promise he is able to keep it if he made that promise he's able to bring you to adoption he's able to bring you to perfection he is god he would raise a people remove people raise up kings change kings flip things over for your sake for his namesake for the bride's sake oh hallelujah oh give the lord some praises tonight oh praise god let's leave your wrap up here the believers as you equally caleb and joshua outfit that was going on to the promise they moved on over into the land and took the land and settled down in the land as a possession we never stop at justification sanification let us go on this is about the brand to the baptism of the spirit why this has not been emphasized we hear mysteries hidden mysteries more mysteries mysteries in mysteries out missionary side mission to the left these divine reveal mystery truths here but watch let us never stop at justification sanification let's go on to the baptism of the holy spirit let's not stop at believing lord jesus being baptized let's not stop because he penis on my life for sin but now here we go we press on into opposition to a promise of the baptism he goes now this he's not talking about kentucky consulting for peter said in their pentecost for their promises unto you and to your children to them that are far off even as many as the lord of gosh our core are going to skip them he says talk about the woman when they're having the child and positionally placing them by their labor pains and so on and they groan and say ephraim mana say and the mothers was groaning and as the one has grown in they called names and they were calling their name and was positionally placing them in the land and then he said this here now he says now watch how that god had set some in the church truly by pain so if you think the believers alone are the good true europeans here what you say about the ministers now he said oh they get tremendous sometimes you say when our church has grown and under the prosecution of the outside world well i know i preach this and we hear this so many times but you hate it again tonight because it's still good it's still fresh it's still from under she kind of glory it's still applicable because this still hasn't come to pass when the church has grown in under what under the press no under the prosecution of the outside world watch believing on the lord jesus that watch that the promise of the holy ghost is just as real to us as it was the pentecost why did ghosts and the prophets again to turn us back to faith of the fathers what was the face of the fathers the holy ghost are they their pentacles that the holy ghost just as real as it was to them as their pentecost how they groan and cry under labor pains let us labor to enter into that rest if you sit back you will sit back and you'll be comfortable but man you're heading straight for tribulation without sitting back you have to groan and cry in the labor pains and when they are born unpositionally born into the kingdom of god then the holy ghost are set in the church some apostles some prophets some teachers some pastors some evangelists and he says gives him to dear speaking in tongues interpretation of tongues knowledge wisdom gifts of healing all kind of miracles so friends he didn't say a man passing a long time god said that him there's a man passing a long time a man preaching a long time it's when the holy ghost sets in the church that's different that's not man saying i'm a person you know what how long a pastor you know 36 years you're a pastor no you're fine you're doing the work of a pastor but until the holy set that man he said wait him the holy ghost have to set the church the holy ghost have to place his sons the holy ghost placed jesus the holy ghost placed peter the holy ghost placed paul they took my tires to be number and god choose all is the holy ghost doing that it's father and son business is what the father choose and the father put your name in the book that way you're inside this room tonight that's why you're called tonight you might be whoever you are oh glory to god go call jacob too jacob was quite a character you know but god called it his name was on the book he said jacob i love hallelujah and god love you too i ain't calling away jacob tonight but god love you too oh blessed be the name of the lord all right let me see if we could wrap up here my god god bless you about isaac we my jesus i my lord no watch oh yeah i'm almost done this year i don't sometime i i i'll bring something else he said no what's something now after you're in after you get in this land that don't mean you're free from war you're fighting getting oh god glory hallelujah and i get to say oh rocking chair hammock come on whether watch it you know them kill the knight and then jeb beside from that other city they come in fear you're not free from oil you say you still have to fight here we go saints for every inch of ground you stand on so canaan did not represent the great heaven because it is war and troubles and killings and fightings but it represents this it must be a perfect walk and here's where the church is feeling today on that walk do you know that your own behavior can knock somebody else others from getting healed your misbehavior of unconfessed sins of you believers can cause this church to basically feel at their judgment you'll be responsible for every bit of it now wait a minute by the banner that's what you think of it and he talked about how joshua and they had no a thing until akan came around and and they lost 16 men just was just stopped wait a minute something wrong and he says oh my they call the day of prayer and fast go made a promise there'll be nothing hurt us our enemies will fall at our feet something is wrong somewhere we got 60 men dead they are israelite brothers they are dead and isaac preached a tremendous message we prayed sometime how many more men must die how many must die why did they die innocent men because one man stepped out of line you see the reason this needs to be taught the church lining up line up with the word line up with god line up with each other i like that line up with the word line up with god i line up with each other let me say that again that's something so sweet line up with the word line up with god line up with each other walking perfectly upright soberly before all men fearing god because one man stole the garment and done something that he should not have done took the life of sixteen men now the book of ephesians i'm closer this year the book of ephesians places positionally in christ what there was in the holy land we are placed not in the holy land but in the holy ghost so the object of this gospel the object of this notice the book was just a book with names the book was sealed and that sealed represents a finished work and that book also represents you because you too will be sealed sealed with seven seals seven perfect spirits sealed in your life you'll be sealed on the inside but seven patent nature of the holy ghost of god and then all he waiting for is a fire baptism to change your body in a moment in a trigger of an eye there is a rapture a power on the inside oh my god the holy ghost on the inside and a paw coming around your body your body inside inside that that that vortex and your body being changed in a moment that picture of an eye let's oh here's i trust the night that the lord spoke to you god can't lie god love his people but he loves his word because the word is him and if you speak a word he's got to bring that with the past and keep that word it's not him who start many people start in this message what is how many gonna finish many people come out how many have gone in nobody could go in and start to talk about my pastor and my this and my man and my church you can't go in and talk that talk but once you go in you'll be glorifying jesus christ because when the adoption power came on that mountain and they said there's been a tabernacle for moses and elias and whatnot a voice come and says shut up don't go that way no one glorifying my old man is glorified in jesus christ the adoption anointing here we go only glorifies jesus christ i want to say it again the adoption anointing cannot glorify any man be pastor prophet teacher evangelist apostle the adoption anointing only glorifies jesus christ the seven angels form a cloud 26 miles high and so on okay when god told the prophet are you looking at it right turn the picture turned the picture to the right or when he turned the picture to the right it wasn't seven it was jesus the face of jesus all the revelations all the thunders and the seals and the mysteries when it finally come into this correct position you have to see jesus christ let us bow heads almighty god jesus christ is a hidden mystery and paul identified christ in you the hope of glory father it might have been chopped up since november i had to this kind of appeared and you showed me what how to laid out and i did just what i felt that you wanted me to do to present to your people from the journey how you were not pleased with many of them with their behavior and their attitude and they were overthrown in the wilderness what happened afterwards lord we are 50 plus years still waiting on that promise won't you release it tonight won't you put a burden upon the people's heart to seek you with their whole heart lord oh god many have come out but we have to go in lord go in and possess go in and place our feet going and getting an action grant lord something this was set tonight that would so still your people up in a way like never before they're not serving a church they're not serving a teaching or doctrine they're serving the living god who comes down and confirm his word father i pray in simplicity tonight that your presence would saturate and move into the homes represented here tonight if there's any sick minister to them and heal them if they don't trodden me or raise them up if there's any feeble knees strengthen them lord comfort your people father give them that rich assurance that you start to work in them is able to complete it and bring it to fruition father oh god you said i'm the vine you are the branches although you're checking to see what we're producing you're checking to see if you produce anything or any branch that doesn't produce you're cut off and any branch i produce you purge that they could produce much fruit here and it's my father glorified you want us to be fruit bearing lord not just barren not just static but fruit bearing grant lord that your people will get clarity by what was shared tonight of ephesians of joshua of the promise of the hour of the holy spirit and what it all means coming out of going into that full redemption although we know that when the last name on the book is redeemed the book is closed not the last person to get a tape or a tablet or a book that's not what the prophet talked about he's speaking about the last name on the book that has been redeemed there has to be this message of redemption that closed this age that closed the chapter of our lives and we ourselves are sealed into the kingdom grant lord at your seat and begin tonight begin to baptize your people with the holy ghost and fire i commit the lies in their hands the service tomorrow into your hands that your presence will be upon the word and upon your people as they hear and the zoomer meeting on friday plant your presence with us lord we commit the rest of the week enter your hands and your people at your hands in jesus name i ask it amen and amen god bless you tonight i trust them that this would have been helpful to you and inspiring to you and are refreshing to you we have nothing new we are recycling what what so god bless you thanks again for coming out i'll be with you
