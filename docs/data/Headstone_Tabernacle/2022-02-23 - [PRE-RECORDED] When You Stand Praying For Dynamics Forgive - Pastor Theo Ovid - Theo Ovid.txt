could happen to you today oh hallelujah oh give the lord some praises people oh hallelujah the name of the lord so this time we want to stand as we want to go into the word of god this morning straight to the word i have no comments mark 11 acts 1 and acts 4 for three portion of scriptures this morning readings in mark 11 verse 22 acts 1 48 acts 4 1 verse 33 reading mark 11 reading from verse 22 and jesus answering saith unto them have faith in god for verily i say unto you that whosoever shall see unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he said therefore i say unto you whatsoever things you desire when you pray believe you receive them and he shall have them and when you stand praying forgive if you have ought against any that your father also which is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses but if you do not forgive neither will your father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses i read in acts chapter one reading from verse 4 and being assembled together with them commanded them that they should not depart from jerusalem but wait for the promise of the father which said he you have heard of me for john truly baptized with water but he shall be baptized with the holy ghost not many days hence when they therefore will come together they ask of him saying lord will thou art this time restore again the kingdom to israel and he said unto them it is not for you to know the times or the seasons which the father put in his own power but you shall receive power after that the holy ghost has come upon you and it shall be witnesses unto me both in jerusalem in all judea in samaria under the uttermost part of the earth and reading acts chapter 4 verse 33 it reads and with great power give the apostles witness of the resurrection of the lord jesus and great grace was upon them all let's bow ahead one more time father we thank you for your presence and we pray that you're coming to your word speak life to us speak to our hearts in jesus name i ask it amen and amen you may be seated praise the name of the lord hallelujah do the people have praises in their hearts this morning you have something to thank god for you have something to worship god for amen that's great so have a title this morning when you stand praying for dynamics forgive i have an inspiration forgiveness dense honeys then love sticks to the honey forgiveness then love sticks to the honey another thought virtue power to witness so we'll see how it goes from there today is 33 years since a revelation of brotherly kindness broke upon this church it was 33 years ago 1981 uh it was august 31st just like this sunday 1981 uh we up in kaiwal and uh i remember those days had no electricity we had gas lamp to pump and so on and the lord led me to that quote when the church finds israeli love whole distance he placed in christ and i told them the little group that was there this must be revealed this is a revelation i told him we can't go no further until it be revealed and we stayed there until god broke upon us that revelation and poured his spirit right after that and when the spirit began to pour out 981 it was a new thing to us we never saw that before but it was really really something at that time but he has a witness and the other witnesses may be here at that time and we went out saying come rejoice with us of course people thought we were joking but we were prophesying because god gave us a revelation our revelation came stimulation and we testify about it in paris 1982 give witness to what god has revealed now i said something a while and i'm keep saying it that you could change pastors preachers beliefs doctrines but you cannot change revelation revelation is when god has revealed something to you hallelujah even contrary to your senses is still a revelation example isaiah said the visions are conceived it was a revelation and look on church at that time there was a revelation now when talking about a little bit world issues the jihadists what do they call them in iraq and syria and so on i heard the prime minister of britain he made a statement he said we know what the problem is the problem is the theology it's not food it's not the people poor and they need food they need some mercedes-benz they need some cable tv they need some western uh kentucky fried chicken and mcdonald's it's not that it's a matter of a belief that's right convert or die is a matter of a belief it's a teaching it's a theology it's something that they're looking for to go beyond uh to go into the life beyond and uh i was talking in marvel about uh saw this girl from england going you know a marriage arranged and she going to get married this uh this jihadist fighter and so on never saw the man before but she want to fight and and she want all the mother girls in england to come over to and someone like that they fight for the cause and so on like that these people they have nothing to do with this world no i'm saying that uh there's two of you christians sitting here today the joker church members sitting the other day they have nothing to do with with what the world have to offer they ask her what she missed she said she missed the fast food but no problem and everything else she want what they told me the life beyond they have a young man in france they just held and saw and he had his last will and testament to his wife looking forward to seeing the grid beyond you have a child it's not as if a child will you know i want to stay for my child see my child grow up that's not the thought the thought is i believe this i'm convinced of this i'm willing to cut off your head for this hey i'm going to go all the way for this i'm willing to put my bombs around me and pull the trigger and blow myself up for this that's what they believe oh hallelujah what do you believe [Applause] [Music] [Applause] what are you convinced of that would make you go the extra mile that will make you stay on your knees a little longer that will make you worship like praise god like there is no tomorrow what do you believe [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah the god we serve said in malachi behold i said you elijah the prophet and the life has already come the god we serve said you are one in a million hallelujah you have a right to be praising god this morning [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory to god man couldn't imagine people committing suicide suicide moments and they don't even know where they're going they believe what's told to them and it is not true because who telling them never went and come back for jesus he died and he rose from the dead and he sent his spirit as a witness oh hallelujah hallelujah and he said you are going to be witnesses also you may be seated a witness has to be there and we just have to see a witness is that somebody tell somebody tell somebody and tell you you another witness that is your stories the hallelujah with this you have to be dear i saw i felt i tasted i was there you can't tell me i was there i didn't read in the newspaper i was there i'm a witness i could testify i felt the power i felt the glory i was there [Applause] nobody can tell you about this service you are here you are witnesses something is taking place right now hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah times and seasons may not be that important it may be important but the most important thing is the power that you have to receive we cannot continue like this come on help me somebody help me preach somebody [Applause] sit down a minute the homes can continue like this the churches cannot continue like this the ministers cannot continue like this the believers cannot continue like this your life cannot continue like this get caught to have a power [Applause] all dictators all man kingdoms will and must fall and fail all churches that is not built upon rock revelation will fall and fail all man-made systems must fall and fail it's only a matter of time jesus said upon this rock i will build my church that has nothing to do with family that have nothing with your mother your father your husband your wife your children your aunt your uncle that has nothing to do with another human being [Applause] you know sometimes people take like babies or toys like a big dog leader or moving doorly a baby's not a toy a baby is a whole human being somebody holding a baby and that's a president [Applause] nobody had jumped down as president a baby nice prime minister a baby a lawyer a baby doctor a baby pilot a baby prophet a baby preacher a baby apostle a person shall conceive and pay your son a baby messiah [Applause] [Music] oh give the lord some as people [Applause] a baby represents aspirations represents generations represents potential represent heritage god's plan and purpose that's why we decided to bless those women this christian woman and the only time they say mayor me may you be the mother of millions and may you'll possess the gates of those that hate them [Music] that was the power of seed that was the power of son of child of generations to come [Applause] [Music] because god was unfolding his mystery through the lives of his people unknown to them come on now come on now are you with me god was unfolding his mystery through his people unknown to them even before the scripture was written oh you should be shouting on that before there was even a scripture written the life was writing a story [Applause] a story is a life in words when you read a story it's about a life that has been converted to words that by your reading you might get a picture of what the writer is trying to say oh cooper blessed peter welcome [Applause] oh jesus as we said on tuesday night when you read a scripture the voice of one crying the wilderness those are words when god see that same scripture he sees john the baptist [Applause] so he convert a life into scripture he convert malachi 4 behold i send you elijah that's scripture but when god sees that he sees william marion branham that scripture becomes a life that scripture that word becomes a voice that word comes alive and you sit here today scripture sitting scripture shocked him glory to god no wonder no wonder john shouted no when when the lamb took the book no wonder john saw his name no no wonder he praises god and if you begin to see who you are if the word begins to open up to you the more the words open up to you is the more you worship why culture this morning the more the world opened up to you is the more you worship because the more you begin to see he is worthy he took the book he paid my price he redeemed me he delivered me he restored me he took my charges he dismissed my case [Applause] let me see that you see you see you have to understand who is greater who is more powerful you always swear by someone's greater and god end up swaying by himself because there was no more greater than him so he saw by himself i kind of like that that's when you're very big when you're bigger than big when there is nobody else bigger than you you could sign it yourself you could stamp it yourself you are god by yourself you don't need help to be who you are you they need somebody to reveal who you are you you know who you are or give the lord some praises oh hallelujah hallelujah and i have news for you sin john 14 20 he said at that day you wanna know that i am in you you are in me we are gonna be one give the lord praise his people [Applause] no sit down a minute what does that have to do with what happened last night yesterday since when you so righteous uh bring your scripture where you were born a virgin where you were born and righteous bring your scripture and i bring my scripture for all have sinned and come short of the glory there is none righteous no not one i have no righteousness this morning to testify about or to boast about but his righteousness has become my righteousness i hope you're hearing me he took my place that i can take his place you're making me feel the preach this morning oh hallelujah he took my place that i could take his place [Applause] you're gonna be seated [Music] [Applause] was moving on to the second part of his ministry because the lord told him it shall come to pass that you shall know the secrets of the people's heart he didn't just step into it he grew into it i'll say it that way first time he hold the hands and begin to tell them certain things but then god was going to bring him to something higher god don't drop us to the top he dropped us to the bottom and say climb fight press overcome victory over the enemy god could have sent jesus full-grown man from the corners of heaven with chariots of angels and fire just as elijah went up jesus could have come down but god's a holder baby [Music] [Applause] you wanted jesus to be a teenager to know what the teenager go through he wanted jesus to be a young man to know what young men go through so he could be touched by what you feel you you heard what i said so when you're feeling lonely he knows it when you're feeling down he knows it when you're feeling tired he knows it when you feel like nobody cares he knows that he can be touched by the feelings by the feelings by what to go through what nobody understands he can be touched if the lord can praise these people [Applause] into that second phase of his ministry the lord spoke to him some words that i want to bring back to you this morning these are the words if you'll be sincere and will get the people to believe you not even cancer shall stand before your prayer [Applause] [Music] note the start he did not say get the people to believe you that's the first step he said if you be more sincere then if you could get the people to believe you not even cancer going to stand before your prayer now at that time cancer was sung in us ebola songs today within a week or less you're dead after getting contact with ebola no cure at present they're still struggling and it so happened that one time brother branham was in a meeting i think about 10 000 people woman came up on the platform and she came up there and began to talk to her he says something is happening all of a sudden he began to see a middle-aged woman he'd been gonna see her like 12 years old in a classroom begin to see a pen sticker in her eye and he began to say i see her 12 years the classroom she said yes brother brandon when i was 12 years old i penn state my eye and that's why i'm blind in one eye and then begin to tell her something more the woman fainted and when she got back up from the painting her eyes was normal and right there and then things change from the first to the second just like that it wasn't a sermon it was not testimony it was a manifestation [Applause] so so when jesus said you shall receive power that's not a human thought that is not a teaching to express well you know shall we see power no no no no you shall receive power oh give the lord a shout that is your promise [Applause] you didn't come to hear a theology about receiving power you didn't come to hear the greek understanding of how there is no you want the power that the scripture declares that you have to receive [Applause] you have to receive pay you're going for your salary off your pay and a man come and tell the boss come and say you were going to receive your pay you said i will come here the man i work for that i come for the real thing you write on a paper you will receive your pay i didn't come for that that's still words i want dollars i want to see the dollar sign a hundred twenty fifty i wanna see those notes because that is what i work for you are crook [Applause] you ordered as a man as a crook you work for him you're waiting for your pay and you might say you shall easy pay yeah i heard that last month i come for the pay [Applause] you understand it now when you shall receive power [Applause] i want to adjust your thinking but there's some coming to hear it coming for it [Applause] that's a different thing all together if you're coming forward you're making preparation for it how you get the power and that demon allah standing there are you getting the power and you're unsanctified are you getting the power and you have jealousy and envy then you have to set limbs up get out get out get up get out [Applause] then you make preparation because you have expectation for the manifestation because you have revelation oh give the lord praise those people okay sit down amen all right if amen you will be sincere i will get the people to believe you not even cancer shall stand before your prayer let's isolate that word sincere sincere is free from pretense or deceit proceeding from genuine feelings you see it's better you tell me you hate me genuinely than to say you love me [Applause] so i prefer somebody genuinely say you know i mean i know i'm not a christian i go to church because christians are supposed to act like that i understand that because i've recently discovered a lot of people that i thought were christians they are not and they are in this message going to church but they are not because to be a christian is to be christ-like [Applause] not church like that's a different kind of like christ-like and church like christ don't resemble church christ is one thing church is another now listen if you were going by eyes in the days of the scribe and pharisees many people would have chooses crying pharisees they were looking good got some real nights hats guns scrolls buildings order so fancy and he was ripping into them you call that he was in ripping form [Applause] because for 400 years nobody touched them they were too big in the system they were too bad to be challenged they were on and here come this man so different smoking them out blowing them out shaking them up [Applause] and his disciples were contrary to the traditions so one time they said how come you decided to wash hands how come your disciples just eat thing on the sabbath day and do this oh come your disciples moving and jesus are getting the word of the word then you say which one are you all they talk about if a donkey falls in sabbath you will take him out they ain't gonna leave that don't get down the whole damn unless somebody else smarter than them take it out you say you will take it out on the sabbath day i thought you were supposed to work busting them left right and center they tried to trick jesus into taxes he said who inscriptions is on that caesar give caesar away caesar but give god what is god what what what what you're trying to try to time up you can't tie up the word the word is god you could never tie up the word come on say my somebody so jesus was handling challenges and listen he started that since he was 12. [Applause] when mary made a mistake and said your father i was looking for you i know somebody must have a record there who are the video camera hearing that they put on the papers jewels over jesus father jesus said jesus said no you not i'm about my father's business you know what jesus was saying joseph is not my father but he did it with classes he could have said to him father you know no he didn't do that he said i bought my father's business mine at this class as a class bus bus so so so so sincere means free from pretense heartfelt wholehearted profound deep genuine real honest watch having or showing true feelings that are expressed in an honest way genuine or real not false fake or pretended that is why give you know say what you want about jacob jacob was honest when he said i am jacob i'm no good woman at the well it didn't justify her life and the behavior but she was honest and that's why jesus said you speak the truth hallelujah the one you're living with is not yours you had five before that she was honest honest doesn't mean somebody uh not right uh justified but they're truthful from inside they are they are in other words they own up and accept responsibility for their actions and attitude what makes somebody dishonest when they want to blame a lot of people blame the easy to blame they blame this one you blame that one you blame that one you blame because you're not honest to accept responsibility that you made that decision you choose your action you could choose to forgive you could choose to hold out you could choose to do it whatever you want to choose people do what they want to do isn't that right they might find stay on their knees too long but going someplace they have no problem with that but you got to be honest and when they start to be honest you get to be sincere sincere with your husband since they're with your wife since you're with your children since you're with god and i'll say it this way if you cannot be sincere with somebody who you see how could you be sincere with god who you cannot see give the lord some praise as people that is why we have to be honest with each other in order to be honest with god [Music] oh give the lord some praises people that's why you can't claim to love god and you can't love your brother and sister [Applause] forgiving somebody doesn't mean that they are right you know it doesn't vindicate them you know it free you from prison because when you do not forgive you imprison yourself [Applause] [Music] [Applause] being redone now he'll just keep flicking over him because yeah remember the story jesus gave about the man was forgiven and in prison and the man come and ask her partner forgiveness and he was owned a lot of money and he had somebody with another five a small thing and he come to lock this my neck and somebody carry report they say bang that man back to prison for him lock him up so you as a christian want to carry your oaths and grudges buying you you went up it up you end up in the prison yourself and the person who do you something they free as ever and you lock up you lock up because they do you and you have a fight and you can't even smile with them come shake their hand you have a fight no you buying it up because you can shake you bang because you can't talk you burn because you cut that one off you bang because you say god can't bless that muslim and god looking at you and god no he can't bless you because lord law doesn't allow it when god points blessing upon you boxing off and falling off because oughts cut it off you can't get your healing because you have thoughts my emails that's right that's right because faith is based upon forgiveness and your healing comes by faith and if the faith is not right you can't get your healing hallelujah healing doesn't come by coming to church thy faith that makes you whole come on give the lord praise those people so if you want to be healed today you have to know that there's no oughts in your heart i'm not talking about physical heal only i'm talking about spiritually healed healing mind heal and soul heal from your past heal from your fears heal from your heart [Applause] [Music] and do you know as i said the other night people better check up on our experience for the holy ghost is only going to anoint in the last days those who sigh and cry for the abomination that did in the city oh holland no that's a that's a shaken one i'm not going to stay there i'm going to move on if i stay there i will just keep shaking like that there's a shaking one not those who are books and tapes sorry i mean sorry you know you see that's why we're going back to the word now not those that read the bible unless people reading that even theologically not to argue what right and what's wrong so it's not that it's those that sigh where is coming from you don't sign from your head you sign from your heart that's why god tell them it will be more sincere start with the heart first are you with me when i say amen or not i still preaching if you feel i'm dependent upon your aim and to preach this i'm not depend upon your amen and still the heart has to be first all right here we go today we can shout we can scream we can speak with tongues have signs and things but where is that sincerity of so sincere about the word of god and the church of god until it grieves our heart to see the sin going on no i don't want to you sincerity like people say it could be sincere and um you know sincerely protect is uncertainly wrong we're not talking about that kind of sincerity i'm not talking about sincerity in a negative way i'm talking about sincerity as a growth in god for god to approve for you to go to the next level i'll say this now but obama was told you have been given power to bind a mamba the mamba couldn't affect him it was affecting other brethren he was told you listen to the words have been given power to bind a mamba but be more sincere [Music] [Applause] amen god didn't tell him if you'll be more sincere you get the power he said i'll give it to you but then going forward i want something more from you where are the amens on that one this is how god speaks show me one servant i got spoiled show me one servant that god didn't expose bus handle put in a corner straight show me one of them and you will not find one god have no spoiled sons god have no spoiled children god doesn't make excuses for them he said go tell my servant david i brought you out from among sheep go tell him that he told the prophet go and tell my servant david it didn't make david lester of a servant he said tell him and god sent me to tell you this morning what i have to say what he once said oh hallelujah hallelujah it's up to you to take it it's up to you to apply it it's up to you to anoint it it's up to you to walk in it is up to you [Applause] when he called israel together elijah and challenge them let the god that is supernatural let him that can show himself alive let him be god if all of your theologians he was speaking to them if balaam is a god if he can answer let him answer let the god answers let the god that keeps his word be god and isn't that a challenge tonight let the god that keeps his word from being unafraid you know my ministry is a little slump now license licensee but if i'm saying that my ministry is a little slump now because it's changing in america from one to another if you notice it the first was a sign that the people look at his hands the second here we go was a sign that only god himself could do no on this third ministry whatever you call it to it phase two administry it lays right straight back in the lap of the people if they will come with that sincerity so now for the third step he is saying it goes back to the people no i'm going somewhere with this keep keep keeping me now keep with me now it goes back if they will come with that sincerity watch the holy spirit they will operate it itself [Applause] it comes up on me and tell them just exactly and it heals right there but they has got to come not with an emotional fate but with a solid fate to believe it's the truth and as god puts it right back to the individual up again because it has to be don't it has to be that way hey why because there is no power in man to heal i know that just ahead of me now lays a greater ministry than what i have but it will take the people just a little bit so but i'm talking about the greater ministry and you're also talking about the people let's go a little further when they go to get them faith in it it will start working how do i see visions out of the audience oh is it because you yourself are doing it i don't do that you do it oh hallelujah could be going deeper now now watch a minister cannot be a revival there's no preacher can bring a revival he doesn't pack it with him the only thing he can do is to be loyal to god and to the word the revival has to come by the people my my my my mind in their home in their life oh hallelujah hallelujah isn't that right blessed be the name of the lord praise his wonderful name oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory to god amen are you convinced do you believe that god has appointed you to bring a revival you have something to bring [Applause] but abraham said god is waiting for his people to go to calling on god to get his servants into action whenever you're ready god ready oh hallelujah when you are ready god is ready when you are ready to call god's servant into action glory god ready to get your servant into interaction there is going to be discernment yeah yeah yeah the word because it is in the hearts again oh hallelujah [Applause] you talking about the 400 hebrew prophets yep one time again i'll go back jesus went on to visit ahab and then a council going after rahma gilead and joseph said well of course my charges is yours my people are yours but should not be consult the lord he have said certainly we should have done that we should have done that they had 400 hebrew prophets not unbelieving prophecy these were certified hebrew prophets these wasn't gentile prophets it was hebrew prophets not balaam prophets not edens but hebrew prophets zedekiah come but two big horns i said those say of the lord by this you're going to put syria put them on the country that sounds very dramatic if you're not only wounded you'll see that piece that drive myself [Music] fundamentally fundamentally he was right but there's more goes with it besides that you can be ever so fundamentally right yet the promises of god is based upon a condition they can be ever so fundamentally right watch they were keeping their sacrifices as reverend as they could doing what the lord told them aha yet without the sincerity behind it i'm reading something about sincere just to get a backdrop here he was saying they were doing the things they were coming irreverent but no sincerity behind it the prayer is not sincere the a sacrifice not sincere afterwards people used to tell people off up alarm for me they're not going they're not identifying themselves they're not coming with that depth of the god of abraham you understand when moses brought the people to the mountain god tell him make a barrication around if a goat crossed that line kill it the people fear god you know fire on the mountain you know the people said they said don't let god speak at moses i don't want god to speak we talking about you on the ground you seeing fire on a mountain you hear in rumbling you every other day when thunder shaking into another yes yes heavy rain and tunnel and light and cracking and whatnot your ass did that like that afternoon yeah think about many of that under among them and you're at the bottom of that mountain and god i'm also there's god up there no you never saw him you never met him but you don't fire up there you know like not normal fire god rumbling on top of there you think you're going to play and carry on no yo it's a different thing altogether is the atmosphere all together isn't that right five minutes all the young people can't do that and they can't stop that and they can't stop that let that fire come long you see how much you're going to stop how much how much how much time gets stuck inside of you let that fire you see that's the problem people haven't met god they have no experience with god they come to church and they believe stuff they believe the preacher they believe the words being spoken but they never had an experience with fire with god hallelujah something to knock you all the highest horses when daniel got struck he said he fell as one dead when john and i fellows were undead glory to god hallelujah brother branham said he was numb in the room he said you know the blessings but you don't know what the power of god is you say he was known for dears couldn't feel himself we're talking about god's power we're talking about the omnipotent one amen hallelujah hallelujah that's the call we want to bring back that's the god that came back hallelujah hallelujah god allowed the pillar of fire to be photographed and let the world know the pillar of eyes upon william branham he was called out and he was identified by the pillar of fire but just as the purifier identified that prophet the pillar of fire is about to identify some sons of god on the earth hallelujah there is going to be an anointed fightful ministry nobody will ever question whether they are who they are [Applause] parallel is indicated perfectly vindicated completely vindicated by god himself oh give the lord praise those people [Applause] what abraham that's where we are we're talking about tradition you've got to get back to be more sincere for you to expect god to answer these blessings and promises you have got to come back to the sincerity of that word and and what what the word say and to stay with it remember and i'm saying this to you the test is on the word eve was deceived do you know what deceive is deceive is when somebody thinks they're right and they're wrong the sad part is they think they're right they really think that they are right but they are wrong then they are deceived oh hallelujah we must come back to sincerity of the word believe that so god can vindicate himself you say will he do it sure he doesn't your life will shine a lot louder a lot louder than your testimony you could ever give your life is so loud till people don't even understand your testimony we might remember to talk about them people there's some money there's just words people testimony good your life is a bigger testimony than any paper testimony that is when sincerity and sacredness now here this little bomb five good people really filled with the spirit will do more for phoenix than all the members you got amen if they are consecrated to god a sincere life because god will move to his word through there and vindicate that to be the truth oh hallelujah praise the name of the lord five people filled with the holy ghost now watch moses couldn't preach noah's message noah's arkham work for that day isn't that right the church is growing it each age is left to the scripture here so god through the holy spirit are we are you ready reveals his word by manifesting it and vindicating it himself some people only believe revealing the word is only talk look on scriptures deep things deep deep deep but god also revealed himself by manifesting himself for example christ is the mystery of god revealed [Applause] no christ is the word right when we preach the word we preach in christ but christ manifested is also god's mystery revealed [Applause] now he shall turn the heart of the children back to the faith of the fathers half of the children that's you right that's a scripture but until you come into manifestation it's a scripture but that has to be revealed and that revelation had to be a manifestation your heart turned back to the faith of the fathers and if your heart is turned back you do what they did that is not talking your heart turn back because the bible said my heart turned back turn back where it has to be silver and gold have i known such as i have i give it to you rise up and walk [Applause] are we looking for that got this what to cut to look for [Applause] but the branham had failed to pray for all people 85 years old people who you think should be booking the box [Applause] [Music] people who you think should be looking to leave the world praying and getting healed praying and getting god answering their prayer god had no limit with age and healing not because your old god can heal you [Applause] god has nothing with time age height distant past present you have nothing to do with that hallelujah he could heal you right now he could seal you right now he can deliver you right now he's the same yesterday today and forever give the lord a shout people [Applause] now watch you may be seated so therefore god to the holy spirit reveals his word by manifesting it and vindicating it showing it's his word being brought to pass in the day that it's promised now jesus said if you can't believe me [Music] believe the works that i do jesus didn't say if you can't believe me come for some more books and tapes no he said believe the works i have works to demonstrate beyond the words [Applause] hallelujah oh that's good that's very good you see describing fantasy was talking for years their only words were ceremonies their only words were spots and pants their only words was every song on him they're saying different things that was their only works but jesus he was a little different besides bossing them and chopping them and cutting them and so on he was healing the sick he was raising the dead he was cast no devil he was preaching the father's word one time they come and say what authority do you do these things yes he said what power is doing all your business with cast the devil's out finger just the finger of the cast not the hand don't use the hanger just the finger god just got finger casting devils out finger of god cast finger just just touch his finger casting the devil's eye caster by the finger of god oh hell no wonder those demons cried out get their sword a finger and they knew the power in the finger oh oh we're gonna cast all that out [Applause] somebody going free today somebody will deliver today yeah somebody will be healed today i'm expecting it today because no faith is [Applause] okay now watch it's so strange that the people didn't want to believe him he being a man make himself god and no man can do these books without god being with him we know nicodemus said that so this is council then knew that and now we know that the word watch they would have known the word he said if you had known moses you would have known me because moses wrote of me now we look if they had looked back in the scripture to see here we go what the messiah is supposed to do then they would have known him by the vindication god through christ was reconciling the world to himself and yes by the love bringing to pass all the promises that was for the messiah he jesus born record of the word making that word live for that day so there are scriptures but there are scriptures to make live and people have to come on the scene to make the world live why some just talking it others going to walk in oh give the lord some praises people this world is going to live so the dynamics going to begin to bring your seed to life and i am believing that that is starting this morning that your seed going to come to life oh blessed be lord oh hallelujah hallelujah oh glory glory glory glory okay sit down a minute and let get down in the driver's seat now listen to things that are to be brother branham said this and i believe that god bearing record of his word by vindicating what he said he would do now we know this

accompany the ministry of this day he didn't say just signs great signs and wonders are to accompany the ministry of this day this is when former and lattering are falling together [Applause] that is

that the anointing coming upon you to bring you into your channel [Applause] go watch john the baptist woods said he's the voice of one kind of illness look at baby john he doesn't know that yet but the prophecy is over him voice i want crying willingness that the name him right not zedika hezekiah calling him john strange name odd name god wanted to be an odd man different from the system different from the name and system difference from the traditions john as soon as he gets the inspiration he just loves wilderness he don't know why but every time he break out he's heading for wilderness why you have to be the voice of one [Applause] so a man raised up and say he's john i mean orchard applause he picking oranges he's picking coconuts he he didn't want to see witness i thought he just in the grass and whatnot looking like john dressed like john resemble john same picture same face what not he's not he's not john he's the voice of the orchard altered field he's the voice from the coconut field voice on the mango field but he's not a voice of one kind of wilderness not many impersonators out there but is he when john come out willingness man [Applause] all that no email you don't have that out there you don't have facebook out there you don't have these things out there it's just scorpion and snakes so when is that baptized normally human possible they say thank you god bless you hula bible shake hand welcome jesse you better be fooled fruit because the axe is read in the door we go chop it off oh yeah you're getting baptized your gospel like better straighten up you better line up you better get fired up you better do something because we are asking and begging and bombing we be paying our way for messiah we prepare our way for dynamics it takes probably kindness to make away from the holy spirit and take the honey for the love to stick [Applause] you know kind of enjoy this hallelujah because there's not a whopping digestion by faith but it's a kind of funny kind of fit not descriptive feed you just see things now and you say by faith i say bye how i know you're my favorite ho i i don't know see god doesn't have promises like that what god promises a year when god make a promise he keeps it he told simeon you shall not see death till you see lord christ he didn't tell the simian's neighbor or if someone had a wife or children just simian alone old man simeon he didn't tell the pastor the priest the high priest nobody else but simeon see men have that in his heart i shall not see that till you see lost christ if somebody want to reveal it to anybody he could speak it if you want to get a good laugh to them you could tell them that everybody know you close to the you know always to the grave that we'll see when you're looking you're looking like your eyes just always not this always to the grave and see me and tell her young man i shall not see death till i see the lord you answer that but christ promised to come a long time so yeah we're dead it's so much like yes we've written see i have no deal with that all i know is god told me i i don't know about you i i i shall not see that till i see christ himself till i see dynamics till i see the power virtue power to be a witness i must be a witness of this messiah people laugh people mock but you know what see myself coming to church somebody's here hearing what he probably say you're looking for the christ you're getting money a good word yeah good word good word you see the christ see man when he looking at christ when he's drinking his drinking christ he's in his food christ hallelujah taking a walk christ hallelujah walking in the grove i'm thinking about i want to see dynamics i want to see the power lord show me like glory i hunger and i toast him hallelujah hallelujah eye single focus you're looking for your ceiling you're looking for the holy ghost you're looking for your anointing you're looking for your refilling you're looking for your adoption you're looking for future powerful service that you could be a witness [Applause] hallelujah sit down a minute when the holy spirit told the prophet pick up the pen and write he said god will fulfill his word at that time he who made the promise would act and bring it to pass because he needed to help a man to push his thing around think about it now you think god needs a bunch of ministers to help push this thing around when god ready god is ready i have come down i come down to the river i come to speak i come to release power [Applause] what i have no apology for nobody excuse me huh can i come down now you think you think it's okay i could make a move now helen hood god already make his move the devil don't understand god already made this move [Applause] if the devil had enough sense he'd never get them books on dipsticks [Applause] it's too late the secret is the word is in the bread [Applause] it's already inside it's already inside of us we're waiting for water we're waiting for dynamics we waiting for spirit be waiting for power but there's a key to unlock it there's a key to get to it faith is based upon forgiveness it takes fear to call for power and when you stand praying for dynamics forgive god to get the spirit of forgiveness 33 years ago we had a revelation of it now we're looking for a manifestation of the very revelation and then with forgiveness i have to come out your flesh come on now forgiveness must not be a topic must be a sermon i titled my servant today forgiveness you must forgive this is the mechanics of forgiveness we're not here for that we had revelation three years ago since 33 years old i couldn't get whole no oats i had oats before that willing to chop and cut and rebuke i wouldn't know i could boss people and still love them i could rebuke and have no ought against them yeah yeah i could be rough and have not one thing against them because it was revealed to me 33 years ago oh give the lord some precious people no revelation and manifestation is not the same thing required revolutionary stimulation with it was a rocker anchor inside of it when abraham got a version of isaac that was the manifestation for 25 years he came in now where is that hold on where is that he's here you want to see him wait until them seven times after their voices [Applause] wait for the manifestation you wait laugh but wait we push for the word baroness every day looking worse because you're getting older you're not getting younger you know going gym putting pills exercising and so on that's not helping you god god didn't say pills will help god need the god in his herbs assist abraham to feel better about himself i have the confidence in life god wasn't talking that kind of talk god said abraham you mr man sarah your wife that's who going to have that child sarah laugh laugh love you keep on laughing i'm going to live with you laughing laugh laugh laugh you're still going to have that child laugh or no laugh raise your hands or you don't raise your hands you're still going to be delivered because god says and i i like when god you know like no negotiations i'm kind of like that you know you know in other words when god says sarah will have that son for isaac in other words that's not negotiable sarah try a negotiation and get handmade negotiation and produce ishmael and ishmael is troubles it is this let's not go there but the point is when god said stat when god said you [Applause] [Music] if if god was in this human science business when god sees here so he shakes you no no abraham we're younger but god didn't shake his head god considered that deal done and when god look at you you know you just take your own side at yourself you just give up on you and god and shake in his head but don't come true go go go go say i am finished with you yet the devil is a liar or what the devil tell you is lies i'm going to free you i'm going to pull you out of that prison all what you have overcome you will overcome you are going to be delivered and some of you looking at me like if it's not going to be so but i prophesy by the revelation of my faith as pastor of this church i prophesy that you are going to be delivered i don't look at your sins i don't look at your fault i don't look where you have been i am seeing where you're going to be oh give the lord praises and this is what god looks at not where you have been not where you are but god sees where you are contempt you are going to be healed you are going to be delivered you are going to be free you're going to get a revival [Applause] oh my all i have today is 13 pages and i'm now on page three just 13 pages oh hallelujah oh blessed be name of the lord oh my so they missed him the living word manifested in the flesh by the word that is promised watch she held on to her transition our tradition she held onto the substitute blood instead of the real blood when he was manifested caused their traditions jesus the manifested word said to the hebrew bride because you hold to your traditions you make the word of god without any effect to you this is the problem today in this message they have had it for so long that it has become traditional it becomes what we do on a sunday what what we believe and so on it becomes christianity comes to what people believe and teachings and doctrines and that make them a christian by their belief not by the life it's no longer the thunder that shakes the devil what we need is tons of live voices our life the thunder oh hallelujah we said in a funeral a song when you sing it makes it a song it gives meaning when you sing it life gets mean and when you live it not when you talk it life gets mean and when you live it we have to live something friends now watch that's the reason today that the revival is supposed to have we have the nominational revivals we haven't had a real steering no no no no sir don't think we have got revivers we haven't they got millions and millions of church members but not a revival nowhere you hear how much member church members millions and millions of church members the bride here we go it has millions and millions of church members but now we switch from that we're going to leave right now the bride hasn't had a revival yet [Applause] there has been no revival there no here we go manifestation of god to steal the bride not a new message not more teachings and more mysteries and a set of foolishness coming out on the hidden mysteries i know the mystery is foolishness have nothing to do with the word of god hallelujah but i ain't ready to deal with them things yet time will come hallelujah praise god will challenge falsehood false teachings false doctrines it's just i don't get so many messages yet i don't know time to listen to all the negative only foolishness i'm trying to find out what god wants you to hear and what the bride want to hear that's all i don't go to fight this one and fight that one i don't listen to counteract this one i don't do that you know over the years it's just under here what god wants me to speak and people know me by now i speak what god give me to speak wherever i go that's what i do preach what's up on my heart another god you know everybody says you don't even know what god in africa you don't know what he thinks this book allah means that i don't even know and i don't i don't dig in churches digging people and taking the business trying to be some bishop and pope over the people have none time with that two is too it's too heavy to be a pope you have a heavy crown for that yeah ever you have a strong hit for that yeah i'll be good for that i i have no desire for pontiff no desire for triple crown no desire for that wrong i have noticed after that i just want to make it to that bride hallelujah this have been a long journey you know oh yes yes oh yes long long journey still looking at my revival holy ghost are pouring shaking that's why i say i know when the world truly begins to open to the people there will be a worship like we have never seen before nobody's gonna raise their hand they've got some praises we do that we get trying to get things started but when you begin to see for yourself forget about it jen you come here you're worshiping because listen you are one in a million you are special unto god as we said thursday night is have layer and layer and layer demon powers god had to pour to all of that to find you god had to drill two demon powers to find you you think you could have just come on the baptist church no catholic methodist muslim hindu you couldn't just walk out a power had pulled pulled you off [Applause] a third full power god actually pulled you off [Applause] and this morning i come up in the car and studying i say lord i i i can't make without you without your presence i feel just like a politician just talking then politicians like to talk plenty you know you grab a nice jacket and tie anything and they're talking when they kind of keep i say lord without your spirit i know that i am zero zilch nada if without him without his presence without the unction i don't even want to preach if i have to come here without presence and power i do not want to come behind amen too much at stake hallelujah too much at stake how many people are bird no more people just doing tradition understand this when the scribe and pharisees establish a system there was no burden as long as you bring your your pig and your you're not picking the sheep and the lamb and whatnot and you do a traditional thing they are satisfied church is false is going on it's quite fascinating long beards put putting a bed and think no you're no problem nobody's stressing them out everybody fine you bless the babies bury the dead sprinkle the hoses because by that time everybody are holy water they make things up that god inhabited traditions of the elders so when jesus come now the gambling any any church and their believers and they're playing a lot on play selling prophets money changes all kind of thing in the temple but the bible said my house shall be called a house of prayer jesus take a whip here and say um claire's truth brethren um i don't think it's right for you to sell all them foals and different things and pigeons and exchange all those animals inside of here for profits no he didn't do that he take a whip and beat them turn over the tables that was thunder with licks that was thunder lightning and licks that was blows the story went out to him that man beating people boy the bible said the zeal of my father's house had eaten me up in other words they got him real mad max he was upset he was angry that that is the condition that the message came to ah he was willing to break the rules break the norm something had to be done it just was that business as usual because messiah is on earth now [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah it's time you go back to your home and said it's not business as usual satanic [Applause] you got to be sincere those devils have to leave you see you don't have power we know that power is coming but you have something that i think you need to understand that you have you have authority authority and power is that the same thing the police have authority to stop the car with his hands he doesn't have power to physically stop the car but he has authority to do so under the son of god take authority over every false spirit come on in the name of jesus hallelujah jesus died my god that you may have your rights your right to be healed your right to joy your right to pray true your right to deliverance that is your right sit down a minute leprosy was a terrible thing the proceedings are put in plan on you to make noise leopards coming and leopards wasn't backing down lord have mercy upon me jesus they got healed all kind of diverse cases demon possessions all kind of conditions came to jesus and he handled them all not one would say oh you're too hard for me this case is too hard since way back in genesis god tell abram is there anything too hard for the lord it's anything at all that all that feeling sometimes you might me old physically you might be all in spirit some of you are the great grandfather in spirit in spirit your vibrant age i get tired nobody says a week say i see weak inside they're saying are you really weak boy that's not the word the word said that the weak say nice that's forty percent by the jody to win this vote challenge fifty percent let the week say i was somewhere like 55 percent i would stop right there let the week say i am strong let the poor say i'm rich what god is trying to tell the people i'll give you the word you kept hearing back to the word back to the word listen to this therefore i say unto you whatsoever you desire when you pray believe that you receive them and you shall have them you have to believe you got it before you get it [Applause] that is in red i just read fear isn't red it means jesus said it there's not a quote from that all of it jesus said what you pray for believe you got it and you shall get it [Applause] you have to get it before you get it do you get it oh give the lord some praises people that is why if you get it before you get it you have to praise him to show that you get it because here is the substance of what you're hoping for [Applause] my god my god you maybe see that you have no revival no manifestation of god to stir the bride yet we are looking for it it will take those servants back there to wake her up again he will send it not a man going to bring it he will send it he promised it no he had a key come on here now if the churches will forget their creeds forget their dogmas just take the bible and plead the promise then it will become effective to them but they don't want to do that oh hallelujah so i remember on the inspiration i dropped the exact words here on the inspiration 1981 i was saying the holy spirit is ready to see the whole thing but where's the honey where's the brotherly kindness the spirit was crying out for the honey 1981 i knew that anointing was prophetic i knew it was sometime in the future to come because what the condition is right now there's no honey right now honey as a teaching or abduction of thought but look at the church's city and the conditions bridging not fellowshipping people getting cut off there's no honey oh yes honey become a reference point of what it used to be on the world kind of thing like that but there's not no real honey really because here's why but ram says when the church finds is brotherly love holy this is a place in christ it will call you'll have to call the church have to have a voice come and rejoice with us hello how you can rejoice with us if you don't like us hit us against us fighting us you can't rejoice you say you just on your on your own but it can't work that way you see and if we believe that we are right and all of that wrong it can't work that way either so it has to be an understanding by revelation that the honey has to be displayed [Applause] so in reality this rock box confession is your faith but honey have to be added to the fate for the faith to be effective in other words honey caps the fate off because love could only connect to honey [Applause] so all who looking for love to connect their faith they have something coming because that's how it is brotherly kindness gives you the window to the holy spirit's slot so brody can't become the key to your blessing when you're ready to forgive god ready to seal you when you're ready to forgive god ready to forgive you and there are people in your life that you know you have not forgiven no i'm not asking anybody to raise their hands to confirm that you will have to know what's going on in your heart what is going on therefore the virtue for this age in the pyramid must be displayed isn't that right and when that is displayed it proves your rightness or your maturity because that oughts and grudge and whatnot it's like little children carrying a bunch of foolishness and brother branham says you know when the brown arms had a fight they fight in the backyard and then when they come to the front they defeat they come together as a team isn't that right but in the backyard the brothers fight now as long as the devil could keep the brethren fighting the world constitutions could stay where they are they are ready to move yet because the devil recognized things that happened them fighting you don't have to fight he said fight one another hold that and fight one another hold on hold that grudge continue that one keep on hating keep on going don't miss service now don't miss service now stay with your head but don't miss it amen don't forgive your wife but don't miss service now keep on coming to service and people get set in that now they forget that his church but as soon as the honey begins to move this is prophetic now once the spirit of brotherly kindness begin to move by revelation inspiration the war will be over and then when the devil realized he cannot get one heart to have an art or grudge on the bride then he will get his forces on the outside and when the press come down you're going to see the two people there as long as there are internal wars and wars among brethren the devil have it easy but it's the prophecy that the honey will stick i don't care what it looks like god said so there's a prophecy that love will conquer all god said so there's a prophecy that one day we'll be standing talking and love will drop down and all the evil will be taken out god set you [Applause] yes yes you have to forgive you mean you really can't go without self-righteous spirit no no god will burst that there's a religious spirit or waiting for them to get confiction is that right you it all of that is religious business when you get rid of all of that and you recognize god's blood for them is the blood for you well let me switch it over god's blood for you is the same blood for them and as god show you mercy you have to show them mercy as god show you grace so you show them grace oh give the lord praise his people you've got to go beyond hallelujah be on your camp hallelujah be on your stand you've got to go beyond your family you've got to be on your doctrine and teaching hallelujah sit down a minute notice how brown said it he said when that time comes i don't care if you're baptist i don't care if your method is i don't give you a pentecostal he didn't say all are we in the inspiration he didn't say that come on tell me somebody that means our righteousness must exceed that of the scribe and the pharisees because they love their own [Music] am i preaching the word on earth but say amen jesus blessed his own disciples love their own loving states confess they love their own too amen so you love your own you love your own everybody love their own but i am saying christianity demands you go beyond that [Music] it means you serve anyone anywhere any race any kind any people because it's christ and you the hope of glory christ didn't pick and choose hallelujah hallelujah he came onto his own his own received receiver not but as many have received him to damn he gave power my god hallelujah i found the coin when forgiveness is found and the churches could be invited and gathered i don't know who it is they don't believe in the seventh seal open they don't believe this doesn't matter rejoice with us i didn't say come and believe my doctrine i said something happened to my life i get a revelation that their blood atonement is up added to my faith and now i am under the blood i have direct access to his presence my sins are forgiven i am justified as if i never did it i am free and i want you to know i am free come and rejoice with me [Applause] so then brotherly kindness open up a channel for the power to come back there will be no power outside of the order of god there have been no power outside of the anointed faith that comes only through forgiveness faith is based on forgiveness there's no power coming there's no power coming to no church no ministers and saying we are right all day wrong god is not honoring that hallelujah hallelujah people are deceived thinking god honor their meanness they envy their jealousy the attitude no god's not going to honor that we're going to honor his word notice god not understood this group me no his word you have to be on the word isn't that right if you're on the word if i am on the word if there's churches on the world god will honor his word if you are on the word call will honor the word in your life i cannot stop god from on his word in you he has to say this is my son this is my daughter i can't say lord don't bless her don't bless him no he will bless who you want to bless he said in blessing i will bless thee oh give the lord praises people could we take a little more oh my god [Music] is based upon forgiveness he said if you do not forgive neither will your father must forgive you is not right and this message rapture and faith will only be revealed to those who forgive their brothers teaching on moses if we have one ought among us we stand in damnation of hell's fire so when the words see the new as individuals begin to take on life what is that this here we point to faith and virtual knowledge this is a picture it's colored it have words in it and that's just what that is that cardboard thing there is not inside of you that's the cardboard with woods on it but when your seed grows to take your own life it means it comes at a living faith a living virtue i live in knowledge how many understand that now in other words it's no longer something on the board if there's something in you coming to life [Applause] so how user gets scared and fighting when it's happening a living faith coming inside of you takes away the fear and you'll find yourself believing all things hoping all things you're believing for your children you're building a family and you want to get the tests you'll come with a mini skirt they'll come over their parents they come over there smoking come up with drugs whatnot and god will test you to see if you would use your eyes or you would use your face whenever you come to the spot where you get disconnected from your emotions when you no longer use your five senses the devil will be frustrated that what your eyes see no longer intimidates you because you'll recognize your faith declare your world and your world is what god said in his word you refuse what the devil have to offer you refuse sarah's body condition and you consider the things that are not as though they were and you stack another promise of god through unbelief but you're going to be strong in faith giving glory to god knowing that he is able to perform what he promised and knowing that god can't lie yes your situation is bad but god could work things out [Applause] glory hallelujah and as your faith get inspired the word began to give you wings that you could soar and fly to believe all things are possible right though some of you ground there but i am believing god i'm gonna begin to anoint you and the word i'm gonna give you start to give you some wings that you can make your sign fly and soar to believe that all things are possible oh blessed be the name of the lord do you believe that william branham a charity do you believe that william branham had the love of god upon him do you believe that it was manifested and vindicated it wasn't just a topic something happened to him he said i wish it happened all the time that's what stopped the bull that's what stopped the bees that's what spoke to his wife or his wife oh praise his name he prophesied that we're going to get inside of there also oh blessed be name of the lord so therefore god must see that seven age virtue he must see that forgiveness that forgiveness will identify your rightness when you're arguing first with your wife i confess with your husband you're not right yet you have to go beyond argument you have to understand god's program and god's will hallelujah isn't that right isn't that right praise the name of the lord so when that brotherly kind is beginning to move again by revelation and manifestation then you're going to see the power of god begin to move god gave us a sign 32 years ago i was a catholic i wasn't a pentecostal i would kingdom catholic catholic jump and scream and shout and think i don't know that i just believe this message god call me give me experience with his presence and so on and i begin to call the minister's gospel i begin to preach but when burlington is broke what i saw i didn't expect i wasn't looking for that and young people were there on the floor the power of god hitting them in kyogre it was something that we were shocked at it was something that came suddenly it was fire coming to vindicate revelation oh harlow there was no doubt in our hearts or minds what god did and i know something took place that then it was a sign of what is to come so i always knew it was prophetic in other words it was a sign a sign means just that a sign a sign is not the thing yeah bro keep saying i'm a sign there's a sign and sign a sign points you to
