he did miracles in time past he happened to be the same yesterday today he and forever your attitude he can help you he could bring you out he could give you ambition he could inspire you yes he could act to you he could give you a faith like you never know before he could help you to believe for the impossible some of you so short and faith but he can help you to believe the things that you can't see hallelujah it can materialize that's the god we serve we serve an omnipotent god in case you didn't know we tell an all-powerful god just in case you didn't know we serve a healing god a restoring god a reviving god a comforting god one who stayed closer than a brother that's the god that we serve we serve almighty god this morning all giving praise people oh hallelujah you may be seasoned you know some people feel god is a paper god he's just a word god just read an intellectual mind god but this is the god that opened the red sea yes there's a god that say they're going to rain and after 120 years it rained because when does god speak his word must come to pass this god we sell his word can't return forward this god we serve if he said he will deliver you nobody could hold that pack if this god said he's going to restore you nobody could stop that he doesn't do a halfway job he doesn't know how to finish job what he swear by himself he swear because he could do it he's speaking because he can perform it he's speaking because he gets confirmed that's the god we serve oh can somebody say amen [Music] maybe you see that they asked jesus some questions and jesus was trying to bring our ancestors to the end of the world he said you shall hear wars and rumors of wars he said not here he said earthquakes not here nations against nations not yet he said this gospel must be preached and then the end shall come so don't watch outside watch inside for the gospel to be preached then you know what's coming don't bother about wars and rumors and wars don't worry about financial crisis and this happening watch the church to see if the church is getting stronger watch what's happening in service deceived will be empowered what's your life to know that fire is coming to your seed water is coming to your seed god is coming to you oh hallelujah glory are you ready you may be seasoned just think 400 years or how much years between malachi and and matthew pharisees sad is everything set up and yet god waiting for the appointed time hallelujah he a man doubting that god could do miracles and here elizabeth she got pregnant and baby hasn't moved us yet and here it is mary because she a virgin shall conceive of the prophecy and here she step into her position i like that mary mary you see you can't hide anymore you have to step into your position you you got to move you got to step into what god called you to do and when you step into what god called you to do 10 things going to begin to happen so mariaka stepped into her position her position was isaiah 9 6 a virgin shall conceive and that was the only one could fit into that position one virgin one name one virgin one name and that's you inside of there the only you could fit into the position that god ordained for you the devil is a liar that means that nobody can take your place you don't let the devil bang your mind you have to step into your position and when every step into a position which is scripture oh glory hallelujah no feeling good your position is scripture you have to find the scripture to fit inside hallelujah and when she found the scripture the anointing came upon her she was ready for the angel glory in other words god broke up the season by introducing the angel gabriel appearing to mary to say you are highly favored hallelujah and the lord is with me and i'm blessed to be among women and so forth and all mary had one question how shall these things be after all this talk and word what what going to happen how i was going to fulfill in my life how is going to be he said don't worry about that that's the holy ghost the whole egos did you could you and somebody say holy oh the holy ghost going to come upon you and power [Music] you shall receive power after the holy ghost you see people afraid this holy ghost people don't really want the holy ghost people are scared of the holy ghost even the devil is afraid of it he won't even go near it people are afraid of it it could make you stop you lying it's going to save it when you're dying it will stop the devil flying but it's good enough for me we talk about this all the time holy ghost this whole time religion all that people revive you they're going to quicken you they're going to inspire you you're going to leave it with a fresh charge you might be seated you know when your cell phone battery run down you have to get charged and you have to plug it in and get a charge if you don't get a charge you can't make no call if you're gonna charge you can't receive no call and if you don't get a charge you can't get the call from god don't want to call you but some of you dead so long you need a charge and that's what we come here to charge you up that fire moving your hands fire moving your fleet that's what you come here they're coming out to get fight they're coming to get depressed they're coming against mine battling church there's the place to shout there's a place to lose [Applause] i am not i am not yourself no i am gorgeous i'm not to preach what you feel i supposed to preach i have to preach what he inspires me to preach i'm not here to please you i'm here to please him praise god who upset upset who mad man who crazy crazy who don't like it that's up to them but when the spirit of the lord move upon my heart i will say what the lord put upon me to say this church is different oh glory i love you i love the church i love the world i love the anointing i love the expectation i love the fact that i feel i feel that people are going somewhere i feel there are people not idling here i feel they appear when i'm patient but desire will close with focus that want to achieve for the kingdom of god i fear some kingdom people here not some church mouse some ginger people here not some loyal church member some kingdom people here oh glory to god hallelujah hallelujah glory glory glory may be seated she got to see something bigger than you [Applause] like some baby eaglets some feathers hatch among the chickens never see nothing looking like it only seeing chickens and struggling to walk like them struggling to pick up corn like them but that egg is an eagle egg it was born an eagle it hatched the eagle it was all over the eagle it just happened to be in the wrong environment you see you see you see if you tell a fish that he has to climb a tree the fish will feel stupid all his life because the fish is wasn't built to climb a tree the fish have his place in the sea to swim so some of us we just got to need to know what we call to do we're not stupid we're not foolish we're not inadequate come on same as somebody we just need to find the right groove the right position oh get the laws i'm shouting people oh hallelujah hallelujah glory god put the ability in the bird to fly the ability in the fish to swim and the ability in you [Music] to do what to overcome to shout to praise god to worship when you don't even feel like worshipping the abilities inside of you to create the atmosphere when everybody are wrong you're looking dead and half dead i'm not going to be dead not in church hallelujah hallelujah almost done this is just testing the temperature i wanna i'd like to test the temperature of the fire inside the church i wanna if the elders on fire the deacon's on fire i wanna know if the trust is on fire if the lady is on fire i want to know who's on fire if you're not on fire i come to light you up come on say miss somebody oh glory i didn't come to pour water on your fire come to light you up you see you can't accomplish much without passion without zeal without fire you can't accomplish much if a man is harming that steel and he bang it when then when he put it in fire fire it get red hot bam speed it's red hot pam you could panic until the day of your redemption nobody can take that mark have you ever seen that man haven't seen that man you know you are mad oh come on shame and somebody oh glory to god hallelujah let me be seated almost done all those out there were in the tattoo then when the tattoo behind the back they were in the tattoo that everybody could see that they are properly tattooed well we're not wearing no tattoo we have a seal it's a seal of god it's a mark and we want to probably wear that mark it's the mark of the holy ghost it's a marker saying that god i've sealed you that god i've called you that you are different you are separated from the world and the things of the world proudly where your mark in the last days there's only two the seal of god and the seed of the beast oh hallelujah oh glory to god listen friends is there closer to the portion here whatever you do nothing will count if it's not for the kingdom of god make big deposits in god's kingdom witness for the kingdom live for the kingdom live for somebody else go beyond yourself a lot of people just locked down selfishly by their family they are shut down there that god can't use them because their world is limited the field and view is limited but god wants to expand your view yes when you could challenge yourself to really step out to live for others and move into another atmosphere it gives you joy to see somebody leap higher than you somebody got lift off the dung hip lift off from the trenches raised up instead you living for yourself you're looking to reach out reach far rich long reach deep jesus walk many miles he needs passionate samaria jesus walk mary mars he needs pastor gadaria to meet that man stripped in the tomb he need to pass there to set a man free because there's a deep inside idea i believe there are seeds still out there i believe in a special time i thank god for this time what if the door was shut who would come in what if the door was shot god gave us a special time because there are people out there predestinated seeds they are back sitting believers out there they are selected predestinated elected seeds that must be called by other sons other sons walk with the bible walk with your name walk walk with the book oh glory to god we have a ministry it's coming it's coming it's coming it's right on its way hallelujah we have a ministry like adam adam i don't know where i doubt i ministry to go after the loss come on you are not lost that's why you're in church if you're not lost you need the altar you you are saved and you're looking to be redeemed you're looking to go beyond your salvation and come into redemption a redemption means you are going back to where you belong you're not feeling uncomfortable you are fellow citizens you're no longer strangers but you are fellow citizens of the household of the saints of god you know you belong to the kingdom of god you know you belong among the house of god you don't walk uncomfortable like you're testing the waters to walk inside of here no you were son of the king when that prodigal son spent all his money and the father waiting for him to come home he was waiting all along looking out all along you know his son or the character you know his son need time his son have to burn a little bit and the son caught himself he came to himself he came to himself he said i am i have enough pig

[Applause] but we can the devil should have killed him a long time ago he lost his chance he lost his opportunity he shouldn't knock you out punch you out string you out a long time ago you may be wounded but you're not dead come on now you may be down but you're not out give the lord ourselves you stand up and give god a shout of prayer hallelujah thank you jesus let's change the order of the service i thank god for the mountains i thank him for the values i thank god for the trials i've been true [Music] [Music] this world [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] god [Music] turn around and greet somebody jesus name tell them through it all drew it all [Music] oh [Music] for the mountain and thank god for the valley i thank god for the triad i've been true if i never had a problem well if i never had a problem i never know that god could someday never know what faith can do through it all hallelujah trust in god [Music] amen we want to go to the world we're learning to depend upon this with isaiah 40. reading verse 28 to 31 isaiah 59 1 verse 19 and matthew chapter 13 verse 24 to 30 reading isaiah 40. in verse 28 has thou not known has thou not heard that the everlasting god the lord the creator of the ends of the earth fainted not neither is wary there is no searching of his understanding he give it power to the faint and to them that have no might he increases strength even the youth shall faint and be very and the young men shall utterly fall but they that wait upon the lord shall renew their strength they shall mount to put wings as eagles they shall run and not be wary they shall walk and not faint isaiah 59 verse 19 so shall they fear the name of the lord from the west and his glory from the rising of the sun when the enemy shall come in like a flood the spirit of the lord shall lift up a standard against him in matthew chapter 13 we want to read from verse 24. another problem what he thought of them seeing matthew 13 who is 24. matthew is right after the last book of the old testament another parable put he fought unto them saying the kingdom of heaven is lightened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field and while men slept his enemy came and sowed tears among the wheat and went his way when the blade was sprung up and brought forth fruit then appeared to tears also so the servant of the householder came and said unto him sir this thou not so good seed and i feel from whence then hearted tears he said unto them an enemy had done this the servants said unto him without them that we go and guard them up he said nay lease while you guard up the tears you root up also the wheat with them let boat grow together until the harvest and in the time of harvest i will gather i will say to the reapers gather together first of tears buy them in bundles to burn them but gather the wheat into my pan let's pray fatherly thank you for your word interpret it your hearts bless it bless those who would be hearing it and jesus may ask it amen and amen you may be seated praise god blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah it's great to be here looking forward for a wonderful time in the word in the lord we already know that god this bible is god in print so what to hear is the word of the lord well there's always jesus in red speak in this parable hallelujah a man saw his field and the enemy came and saw it and just walked away disappeared and he hadn't seen anything he's so on the silence too hallelujah just disappeared and when they begin to grow the man came and said but hey you saw good seeds here how come these tears doing here you say yeah enemy did it should i cut them no no no i don't want one miss i don't want to reap i don't want to pull out the wrong wheat isn't that right so i have a title they that wait upon the lord that's what i have this morning a title deeds wait upon the lord i have a subject waiting on god and waiting for god this is the process of character development and i have an inspiration cutting you down to the world only see we got to be cut we got to be cheap a lot of people don't like the cutting they like to shave and they like the chicken and chips gospel you know take it back and go and so on but it have where you have to be cut down to the word only because this bride is going to be the word how many believe that sober branham and taitara age you were sharing this i know that works love service faith thy patience thy works and the last to be more than the first i know that works the son of god said believe me for the work's sake he put an emphasis on his own works while on earth the works that he did were ordained of god to inspire faith in him it was a great part of his ministry and the holy spirit in the apostle paul said we are his workmanship created in christ jesus and the good works which god had ordained that we should walk in them these works were to inspire faith in him as they show forth the relationship to him that paul described as created in him now works will never take the place of faith in god for our salvation but works will show forth our fate already placed in him good works won't save you but even if a man is not saved he ought to do good works and do the best he can what is horrible in the sight of god for men to do evil works and then say that they are doing the will of god that is what the bishops and popes and hierarchy of rome were doing they were killing maiman doing all manner of evil in the name of the lord they lived out lives exactly opposite to what the world teaches in that evil day those true believers shone like a light in a dark place as they continually did good for they returned cursed with blessing that the truth to honor god even though that many died for it in this verse here we go he commanded his children because they were living changed lives i'm not hearing you i want to say amen write with me with the word now they will live in change lives see it change lives say they can change lives that is what they will live and change lives okay watch their works testify to a new spirit within them men sought their good works not hear their good talks but they saw their good works and glorify god are you with me no no we want to be that kind of people hallelujah all right if you are christian you are going to do what is right your words will show what your heart is right and it won't be something you put on for you will do his will when no one but god sees you [Applause] that's why you hear me say you are what you are when you're by yourself because you could pretend to this you could act this way you could show this way but when you by yourself that's you in all your glory hallelujah are you with me i know your love and service faith and patience you will note that the love is placed between works and service and that is the right place for it because without love our works are not accepted before god you're working because you're doing work like i asked myself a question if a husband is saving love and a wife or a wife is serving the husband and she's not saving love how does she feel she feel like a let slave say that again if the wife is serving the husband and he's not serving her love she feel like a slave she finished working in the kitchen working in your home there's no love coming there and if a husband's still in love and the wife has seven respects he feels like a nut [Music] are you with me oh praising of the lord so without love i am nothing whatever i do it would profit me nothing unless it's done in love now you can see right here that these believers weren't in that nicolet and class that it works as a means of salvation to be admired by men but they did their works out of love of god that were shed abroad in their hearts by the holy ghost isn't that right now i want to give a warning right here it is considered the last days that because of abundant iniquity the bible said the love of many with wax coal so a church on fire is a rare thing yes i'm saying people on fire that's a great thing when you see believers on fire that's contrary to what the scripture was saying you are breaking the barrier the song by area because the bible prophesied the love of many will wax cold they will still go to church but they cold still shake hands but they cold god bless you but they call call the love of men because of iniquity oh hallelujah are you ready because in the low reaction or last church age self-love uh-huh and love for material things will make take the place of the true love of god yeah that's self-love make it differently selfies you like yourself i ain't mean to hate it too hard but that is that's a new word selfies selfie goodbye talk about self love love materiality will take the place of the true love of god we need here we go to guard against the power of sin in these last days you can't just walk unguarded you have to understand it's a war fear oh glory to god you shout you jump you feel inspired inside of here and the devil just balling god because you shouted you've got to be kidding me that there is plotting to take away your shout out why are you shouting here the devil is plotting to take away your joy to wipe the smile from off your face to give you a throng but we gonna keep on smiling like the people don't want to say amen on that one you've been thinking about that devil don't think about that devil think about your joy that's not the devil joy that is your joy that is your peace that is your strength [Applause] we need to god against the power of sin in the last days so many are getting so hard so many are getting so hard because they haven't realized the effect of this yes last day spirit right in the south of my experience anointed now and free to come out why they wasn't in the closet really young they couldn't know it wrong no no but they're coming out now why it's a last day spirit why because jesus said as the one days of the son of man socially one day the son of a so she would have been the last days so we are coming right back to our spirit by coming back upon people that was there back then so the last spirit is coming back but there was abraham the elected that was elohim dynamics build i will return unto d according to the time of life and there was a change of body steroid was changed and in this last day there's gonna be a change of body there's gonna be a rapture i'm not hearing you i'm not hearing you so they are getting in their spirit and we have to get in our spirit in the spirit of the coming of the lord oh give the lord some praises people [Applause] russia was a bunch of barbarians but now there's so much advance because they recognize their position and look how anointed the prisoner in russia is because he have a place and a path to play in this whole program of god oh hallelujah understand that the judgment is about to be released but before that every angel had to stop the wars stop every disaster stop this and stop that until the angel from the east having the seal of the living god to put a mark upon those that sigh and cry that means somebody will be hungering thirsting groaning travailing glory hallelujah [Applause] don't let your wife zap you don't let your husband zap you don't let your children zap you from knowing the mystery of god and the will of god for your life oh glory to god remember this jesus said to eat they drank the bill they got married and otherwise norman living no evidence that something supernatural was about to break fort they were doing their thing they were going to the bank they were going to work they were paying their bills but i missed all that natural work there was a supernatural something that was about to unfold that the world know nothing about fire was coming trust me was coming hallelujah [Applause] glory glory hallelujah glory to god you may be seated and people sit in this mess for 40 years thinking they're safe because they believe a prophet but the rapture is a revelation come on same as somebody the raptor is not sitting in church the raptor is a revelation and enoch walked with god and had a testimony that he pleased god without faith you cannot please him because he that coming to god must believe that he is [Applause] hallelujah i'm not preaching the voice of tribulation i want to walk like enoch i want to talk like enoch i'll have a testimony a testimony that we please god [Applause] you may be seated when you begin to please god everybody will not be happy with you no because those that love god and please god the devil is angry you'll have family against you this one hated you that's when i problem with you they have that problems this is a world of conflict conflict is part of life too much and you don't want to battle battle is part of life titan is part of life the animals is fighting why the lamb is looking for grass the lion looking to eat the lamb it is war did the lord shout the prey oh are you with me oh glory to god are you hearing what i'm saying the world of nature is a battle for you [Applause] bible said i call you young man because you are strong what did your man could do all man cannot do you're young you're strong but yet the bible said even the young men shall fail and utterly fall it looks like a contradicting snow this all is so dangerous that your strength would fail your youth can't take you through your loops can't take you through you need more than that you need to wait upon the lord because then i've wait [Applause] the people the people that know their god shall be strong and do great exploits you may be seen today that wait sorry glory well i waited and i no no it's for fire huh i waited and i know there was a time for revival we're gonna preach it we're going to speak it we waited now is the time for the supernatural we waited now we're trying for the white horse rider the holy spirit the monks [Applause] i feel good mine covered the race to run everybody say you can't make it you're running for 30 plus years understand you can't make it and they hold them keeping your own strength and your own power and hearing you weak dependent needy insufficient but there that weight upon the lord shall not maybe not perhaps there's no question about it there's no wondering about it if god said it he can't lie because that's god take that weight upon the lord showing you that strength they're going to mount up not sit down mount top mount up like the heels the wing's gonna push back we're gonna soar we're gonna rise above your situation you're gonna fly above your childs [Applause] the gospel it's good news the gospel is good news and god said i will restore to you all while you're lost over your left health you can be back within 40 years and walk in the services for the first time and god the god who spoke it i will respond to you the years that the conqueror woman the caterpillar all want to strip you and eat down and my people are going to eat and be satisfied some people eat and they're still hungry but not my people my people gonna eat and be satisfied and praise when you're hungry you're kind of you're grumpy you can't praise god the way you want to but when you eat you're satisfied you're barely full the meal was great you could shout you could praise god you have the energy to press your way my people gonna get caught [Applause] oh glory to god i say it's time to rejoice because the lord gonna pour out the former and lettering i hear the sound of the abundance of rain [Applause] hallelujah [Applause]

trying to get sword he's a string man come on now hear me are you with me david have a singing ministry [Applause] foolishness you have your sword keep your sword hear the same thing where you enemy i'm missing show him i'm hammering so when david come david said saul so i'll give him the latest freshly minted front split brass plate breastplate sword you name it foot brass shoes everything david fully buckled up they basically feel like a soldier intrigued by he said that hulk soldiers feel oh god like a robot are you are you walking you can't even raise my hand good praise god it looks more defensive and offensive and look like getting more protected than you could attack david said thank you take back your thing hold back your business i'm it's not me i want to be myself i want to be who i am i don't want to be like that minister i don't want to be like that brother that's not me this is who i am oh get the lord some praise [Applause] oh hallelujah glory let me see goliath oh yeah here customer getting big respects because he's a big man when you pick your baby when you launch your lodge so here customer gets in huge respects so when david ran out he said like disrespect he said i am a dog is that little guy he was sent to me with a sling and feel to the birds that's a big talk big man talking big talk davis i'll cut your head off oh that's god talking that's that's god that's the spirit of prophecy that's the testimony of jesus that's the holy spirit servant [Applause] goliath in your life i'm not hearing you we're serving all i had no kiss you maybe see that and david said you come to me with shield and spear i see you well equipped that's fine latest equipment but i come in the name [Music] there's power in the name there's fire in the name there is healing in the nail there is victory in the name in the name of jesus [Applause] had a great advantage fully covered full compressive insurance from head to toe only place that was not covered inspired and when they look at them they say look at that target that is bullseye i can't miss that never knew you can't miss that he just had to get in the spirit now and then wind up his hands and afterwards the holy ghost had to walk with his hands too and that's why if you can get started [Applause] you know you're preaching if you can get started god will do the rest that's what we're here in church today everybody to get started glory you're gonna be seated when david knocked out like that is yourself moving on they're afraid of dead not good man he's really big only the biggest you know a lot of these ministers who bluff and bluffing with the words i don't think if they will stand in this eagle out in truth but they'll just freeze they're still fighting to move they may show the unconscious keep your bones back they even knew that man dead they would run they would take up a sword if you're that page three or four wait till them seven thunders after their voices to that group they're gonna slice and cut oh hallelujah hallelujah slice and cut size and cut it will be the sword of god coming on the mount of god it will be the third pill it will be the word of god it's going to be the spoken word david cut collide head off and when israel saw the head rolling down they said you really did they say he dead the head is rolling down what are we gonna cut [Applause] yeah you're going to see it rolling yeah you're going to shout therefore if you know it's coming down start to shout now i bid you to shout i beat you to shout hallelujah hallelujah oh glory glory glory hallelujah you may be seated oh man brother brianna i know your service jesus said he that is greatest of all is seven to all a wise man commented on that saying here's what he said only history will prove the truth of that victim that man was right all the truly great men of history have been servants they who demanded to be served they who oppressed who oppressed they who always sought to be at the head have gone down in shame even the very rich are condemned by god when they have not used their wealth right look in the history and you would find that truly great with those who serve others history can never acclaim those for whom much was done but it will forever praise those who did much for others and that's why brahman said perfect eternal life is when you could live for others now let us apply that to ourselves even the son of man came not to be ministered unto but to minister so we had to follow that example see him as he bows himself over the feet of the apostles and washes the attire to defeat he said you know know what i'm doing you don't know know what i'm doing but you shall know hereafter but what you see me doing you ought to also do he became a servant in order that god could elevate him to the highest heights and one day in the judgment of the saints we are going to hear him say well done good and faithful servant and the darwin is the joy of the lord it is hard to be always a servant but those who spend and are spent for others will one day be seated with him in his throne it will be witted all then let us labor for the master from the dawn to said in son let us talk of all this wondrous love and care and when all our life is over and our work on it is done and the rule is called up yonder i'll be there i know your faith now he does not say here as he did to the church in programmers you hold my feet he's not talking about his fate now he is commanding him for dear faithfulness and as he does you also mention patience now faithfulness and patience go together in fact patience is the outcome of faithfulness for in james one three the trend of your faith look at patience there is absolutely no other way to gain patience it has to come by the trial of your fate romans 5 3 tribulation work at patience how highly god regards this outworking of our patients is seen in james 1 4 but let patients have a perfect that you may be perfect an entire lack in nothing amen i read that from memory when i took on my glasses consistency god's will for us here we go god's will for us is perfection how many believe that and that perfection is patience waiting on god and waiting for god this is the process of corrupted development that is where i get that from waiting on god and waiting for god this is the process of character development so he gave noah 120 years he gave abraham 25 years he gave israel 400 years he gave the inside of a room 10 days you have a way of giving time on things to test fate and develop character there is no other way for it to be done that's why trials must come because character is not a gift character is a victory the tests have to be given for you to overcome could i hear a shout on that because this is what the bride is for to be flesh of his flesh bone of his bone word of his word characterized by him other than that you are the same all you pawn on your dress upon you tight same old you same you put some paint on you know change your hair style and so on cmu but when character come it's the same outside you're about to change your tie but you on the inside change that's what the problem was peter didn't know his emotions would overtake him lord i died for you that sounds very annoying inspiring every disciple else everybody else impressed with that whoa here peter boy courageous man jesus said you'll name me three times no that's not really a good encouragement yeah man for such a bold step in the faith 19 crucifixion somebody said you're one of them i saw you in service they said no no no mistake and dignity second person you are one disciples no of course not i look at this i pledge [Music] do you think i'm looking like that well they still want to identify him he's had a curse peter webb bitterly oh peter was broken peter that that but you see jesus told him other things too he said after you were converted strengthen the brethren the devil want to sit for like wheat but i pray for you already you're covered man you're a covered man you are covered oh you should shorten that you already covered man you're gonna make it glory look good [Applause] hallelujah man brother stephen brought a tremendous exhortation until the night prime meeting tell them keep that money back again about god's dna got gene inside of you god put that dna to come back that didn't have a return ticket on it they ever don't know that god only loses here for season and time but have a return ticket on it that's why you could say all the father had given me will come they have my gene they have my dna they have what it takes that's why god puts you in this age [Applause] if you think things bad god kind of put you in them and age when them can dress long long big show i don't mean these kids in them days everybody have bigger bigger bigger and bigger said a big big spring around them i don't know how do you sit down on them days but those who do this god could have put you in them days and you look very spiritual not that kind of jewel are you with me so god said the tough age how they get some tough people [Music] like they don't want to say amen say this is too rough we can't just put any anybody in this hit a certain punch a qualified punch a special punch a holy ghost bunt [Applause] everybody [Applause] do you understand why we talk about cinema cinema then black and white movie is joke and damn times with some big real things spinning they don't have that man change way beyond that and if man could achieve ah we supposed to be revealing revelation after revelation power after power blessing after blessing supposed to be unfolding i don't want to be stayed back there in this old horse and buggy listen over the years we see some companies bum out of existence you know companies that once held a market ninety percent of product and they didn't have the name now it's like an atomic bomb blow them straight out to the out of the market their name not even there no more struck off no more spoken because something else takes its place and this is the world we're living in hallelujah people bringing products that people don't even know they want but then fellows who in the business said them know are they trying to bring things to people they had to buy on people people willing to pay for them they buy them but what about the church the church going my horse and buggy amen that's right come on now amen oh my goodness [Music] in the upper room they were praising god continually and from this service here that's what you have to do listen listen i'm not talking about in the church here alone you know on your job on the street all around hallelujah thank you bless the lord my soul let people feel you're crazy you're praising god you don't like your talking on your cell phone yeah hallelujah praise the name of the lord hallelujah let people think you're going nuts glory know you're going in the spirit you're spiraling now you're breaking in a realm god tell the prophet i'll meet you in there that'll be the third pull it's not right a little attempt isn't that right a little building isn't that right scripture matthew 6 6 when you stand praying when you're praying the father who pray in secret and your father who sees the secret shall reward you openly so i want you to go now in your purple closet and your power closet that way your strength coming from when you begin to see that you recognize your strength is not from your pay your strength is not from your salary your strength is not from your pay pocket your strength is from that closet if you don't go there you're weak but when you go inside there you come out here strong because you're sourced your source is gone listen there are there is some some cyber thieves speak about 100 something million dollars they say stephen know what to get to breaker [Laughter] long time you're the guy get a wake up and steal the money and whatnot nobody on the internet and they're breaking in and they're doing this and doing that and stealing money from banks and what that and getting out that's the age we're living in hallelujah glory so if jesus could do that in this system here what do you think we could really do if we go in our room in the spirit of prayer you know what i tell elijah it's like somebody elijah some inside monday because everything we do here elijah hearing elijah nowhere praise god you know what god tell abraham shall i hide from abraham all that about you i can't hide from abraham what you think god will say no shall i hide from my wife shall i hear from the pride what i'm about to do do you understand he's about his spirit are you looking for a bunch of people are going to wake up on him they will send my soul weight upon the lord come on sometimes you're anxious for this anxious for that what you wait i'm called on the blessing you wait and go can get your preacher you wait [Applause] let me be seated look at that man going by the pool that here yes that's a tough one and every time you go into somebody go in front of him but you know what he didn't stop coming i like that guy you know he tells yourself even though every time i come in front of me it's better than staying home [Music] because staying home have no promise but you see that water our engine has come in trouble i want to make it maybe if not this service next up i'm going to make it and he keep pressing but press it not one year character development 38 years the amount of persistence the man of belly the man of perseverance nobody can see that he just come in they're seeing the same clothes and the same shoes or whatever it is but he have something in him that god recognizes and when jesus come jesus passed this one jesus passed that one because it didn't have the character like what that man had he didn't have a big problem he had like a prostrate problem but jesus bypassed higher conditions to go to that one man and say will you be made whole will you be made whole and the man said i have no man to put me here he accustoms say in this thing he accustomed talking this trying to get him she said i ain't come to accidents i have come to access what if you want to go in that water i am the water oh glory to god come on now i am healing water all i want to know is a confirmation from you if you want me home be the whole rise up master mister and go you're healed [Applause] oh give the lord some praise yes people do you want to be made whole you got to say it you got to say i want to be restored you got to say i want a revival you got to say i want the holy ghost you want to say i want to pray through you got to speak it [Applause] i am believing after this service lies forever change oh glory sometime from that time something just take a turn and your life take a turn you make the right choice to come today a right turn to say amen a right turn to worship a right turn to raise your hand and something happened in your life that changed you forever oh glory to god that people something happened way years ago something negative and that put their life in a spiral sometimes people make the wrong choices wrong decision never recover but thank god for his grace and mercy give us an opportunity to repent give us opportunity to make things right and we know according to romans 8 20 all things work together for good to them that love god to them to them to them who are be called according to his purpose according to what your purpose know his purpose is never his purpose for your life you're hearing what i'm saying it a his purpose for your life i'll say it again his purpose his purpose for your life oh glory to god therefore you are here to connect to his purpose for your life you want to do this you want to do that but there's a huge purpose for your life i want you in that purpose nothing could stop you no weapon form against a good prosper nothing could hinder you glory to god i'll never leave you never forsake you glory to god because you have his purpose for your life something had a purpose to defeat the philistines to do this and do that samson fell something failed but guarded her for the purpose for samson samson had the dna in him he had god's gene in him oh hallelujah he was predestinated he was elected he wasn't permanently back sitting some people have you like if you're backsliding you're permanently so you're sick you're permanently so forget that this whole world is temporary so sickness is temporary accident is temporary bad feeling temporary bad marriage temporary too bad relationship temporary some rocking children temporary too let the fire fall on them children you will see them get cured [Applause] all those bad behaved once let god presence coming upon him all the foolish ever smoke out god take the dynamite and just blow it out hallelujah we have a dynamite our god is a consuming fire he has used lights you know not flashlight and torchlight in a real light firelight fire has burned pulling the snakes out of your heart pulling the snakes out of your spirit burn the stakes out of your soul [Applause] what are you saying right over just no demons crying out [Music] [Applause] i know you don't know what i'm talking about when jesus started walking the earth waiting happened they see myself cry out when paul said the walk demons crying out one time that demon one one point wanna do like what they're doing this demon said paul i know yeah peter i know but who are you i don't know you i recognize your authority in those sons there is demons talking now i understand the power and the authority because they are ambassadors of the throne and ambassadors and representatives of the kingdom like hierarchy that means kingdom people god sent an ambassador isn't that right when the government and trainers an ambassador to london ambassador to america or wherever they represent the country they represent the government they represent the authority of when god sent his men out the ambassador of the throne as my father sent me so send are you as my father [Applause] glory to god so therefore satan is about to experience something that he never experienced before the manifestation of the sons of god when we go in coming back to take back what we have listen take it back you know adam lost yet it slipped out the adam hand the book the authority eternal life inheritance simple adam han and parabanam came to bring it back mighty angel came down with the book with the bread of life but the shout is not right to bring forth the pride here we are feeling on the unsealing body word of the solomon here we are feeling on the bread of life [Applause] glory to god hallelujah seven thunders are their voices what fought to gather the right together to give the right feet they shouldn't help repair the bride not the church the church could play a church but you're coming here with the bride needs praise god you have to understand how the people feel in times past our god looking forward for this brand that'll make him proud and says a woman reflects the man his ambition his ideal and so on the woman a man choose isn't that right so the bride that christ chooses is to reflect him [Music] [Applause] if the bride used our own thing that's problems she is on her own all right so god's nature is to warn our man before judging them isn't that right you always give warning we have a responsibility we are responsible and god has put us here on the earth okay watch for a reason another reason that he's put us here for we are responsible to him for that reason you should go to him and find out what he wants you to do and if you if you went to work for a man give you a job on a ranch or something you went down to the band sit down there well you must go and ask him what he wants you to do and then if you're working for a man find out what your duty is lord what would you have me to do why am i here if it should be a housewife this washer whatever gods want you to do then you do the very best you know how to do it excuse me no matter how little it is you must do it now listen to this he does not always strike when he wants i want you to watch this quotation god gives a warning but he doesn't always strike the same time he wants did you notice that and then he doesn't strike he sends a warning he said now watch but that profit if he's vindicated it's got to come to pass there's only one thing can stop it is a quick repentance like abraham got all abraham your siege as a genuine in a strange land and because of iniquity of the amorites there we go is not yet full so god knew that cup was going to be full he was speaking with this prophet he said you see that cup of the ammo is down there the iniquity is not yet filled up so god will just judge because things say now no there's a cup of wickedness a cup of evil that god looking to get filled up and they're filling it up before ye are yehen yield and when that fall then god will strike the iniquity is not yet full so god himself have a diamond [Applause] hallelujah a lot of people get away but whatever timing when he does his thing isn't that right so what's something now talking about david trying to do god's service outside his being his will and david now got a revelation he claimed to bring back the house of god the ark isn't that right but but abandoned said he revealed his word only in its season martin luther read the same bible we did where's he read the bible we did penetrate the same bible jesus read the same bible but watch but they fail to see the hour so only when the time comes the opening of the word for the season and time god breaks what needs to break amen isn't that right so watch god reveals his word in the season and to whom he choose to reveal it to god chooses who he reveals it to he reveals them as he will as his chosen people his chosen people so who it is will dare correct him and said now lord you made a mistake by putting this man in the ministry who is there to correct god and say god to make a mistake by presenting you over in the ministry i'll put my name in saturday this man doesn't believe like we believe who is going to tell god he is wrong in it it would be take somebody a little more delinquent than i am to tell him that he knows what he's doing he knows who to choose who not to choose what to do when to do it no matter how much we think that a certain person is qualified to do a certain job god knows who is qualified for the time and the season and so forth isn't that right so david got a revelation look like a man get a revelation a great man like god chosen king greatest king fresh revelation freshly anointed and he said but it was wrong that's a great thing i'll deal with our subject trying to do god and service without it being god called you to do it so david got a revelation but he was not a prophet natan was the prophet isn't that right but the king got the revelation and david never consulted nathan the prophet he consulted his theologians the army his boys his co-workers his friends his family consulted them is not right so instead of asking the source that he should have asked he consulted his captains because he had become a king and he followed that line at thinking his chief captains and great man now his intention was good his motive was good his objective was good to bring a revival to the city but he never consulted the way god told him to do it so there's a way that god has things to do so we can't go fanatical and cranky about getting this done we have to wait upon the lord to catch the way it has to be done because god tell joshua we have not been here before isn't that right and therefore we have to walk referently isn't that right so barbara said the bride hasn't revived us yet there's no revival no manifestation of god to stir the bride we are looking for it it will take those seven thunders to wake her up again he promised it if the church will forget the creeds forget the document and plead the promise it will become effective to them so now going back no matter how sincere what good motives what good objectives how people want those things and see the need for it there is a will of god to be carried out and no matter how much is needed how much everybody agrees is needed how much that is the truth there is one thing to find out is it the will of god and listen he consulted his military forces and not even considered their god-sent messenger of the hour so therefore but obama was talking about a man he's talking about um an intellectual man apparently coming from africa and he told them that this economical move was a thing of god and all that is coming back even the catholic church is going to come back to his original condition or speaking with tongues and a man i didn't know sometimes you plant the siege you don't know what's going to happen but the president the full gospel businessman as soon as the speaker said no he said i am prone not to say things against our speaker but that ain't the way but the branham said it would happen he said it would lead to the mark of the beast he said but ibrahim don't know what he's talking about he said well we believe he does and chicago said how many here would like for me to come up and give my version of it they begin screaming and shouting see you're planting seeds you don't know what's going to happen just keep laying out the seed when an hour come like thomas he was our last one to see the lord he said he was a little late but when they see the things here we go that's predicted saying thus here the lord happens then they say give us of your oil so right now everybody's feeling fine because things are beginning to break yet but when things begin to happen then they realize they are the oil down the oil going down they shorten oil and they come and say give us of your oil no here it's not from question and answers and a wise virgin who had oil in the lambs rapture and faith believe in all the signs and wonders watch and watch and these five cut out the remnant was taken away and the rest of them still virgins will not be lost but will go to the tribulation period and jesus said give us they say give us your oil we want the holy ghost now we recognize we are not the holy ghost and we don't even have the holy ghost watch now anyone knows that the holy ghost james fight for all knows it represent the holy ghost the oil and that's the reason we are anointed with oil represent the holy ghost the oldest spirit now here this part they want to i don't want to get to now these had the holy ghost and were sanctified these are signified plus the holy ghost go buy from those who sell to you and they listen to this part now hear the path and they went to try to pray through to receive the holy ghost but the gentile dispensation had been finished and the persecution arose what does that mean if you want the holy ghost you begin to pray now you're looking to pray for the holy ghost no don't fill me pour out the holy ghost upon my life isn't that right so no you without the baptismal spirit you know that is the oil if you didn't have the oil they did not go in oh hallelujah so when they say give us some of your oil the sleeping virgin they realize they had all that time to get the oil but they didn't do it so when the brine was about to come they said give us of your oil oh blessed be the name of the lord and brahman said there are five must in doing god's service correctly david was doing got a service he was doing everything he knowed he was doing what's right but there's five must and i want you to remember this no matter how sincere man maybe there are five months isn't that right praise god it must be his time to do it isn't that right it must be his time and season number two it must be according to the word that was spoken it can't just be anything god must prophesy and say this is supposed to be that's why jesus told them if you had known moses he was going to know me because moses spoke about me isn't that right it must be according to the word that is spoken and this third one it must be according to the person he choose to do it by isn't that right it must like the person you choose to give it by isn't that right and it must come to his prophets and the prophet must be vindicated so therefore we have a vindicated prophet that spoke syndicated word therefore it has got to come to pass so if we stay with this vindicated spirit spoken word how could we fail [Applause] oh hallelujah we're not here to bring you some dream we're not here to bring you some men's idea or our own idea we're here to bring your thoughts at the lord oh glory to god isn't that right listen to brother branham he said now watch he said when jesus fell they choose mathias to take his place and the holy spirit waited until all this was in order before it comes are you here with me they had to choose one to take the bishopric of judas that fell by transgression to fulfill scripture so matthias had was to be in position even before the holy ghost fell oh glory to god here we go are you ready and i believe that all these things has a time of lingering which is the time of waiting we are talking about did i wait upon the lord god always you have a time of lingering time of waiting it's waiting for the time for the scripture to be fulfilled till everything gets right everything in order wait him amen [Music] oh so don't get over excited did it wait upon the lord feeding on the word of god while you're waiting praying while you're waiting preaching while you're waiting pressing while you're waiting while you're awake and testifying while you're waiting you're worshiping while you're waiting you're shouting but you're waiting upon the lord while you're waiting you're doing all that you can do because you're waiting on the lord [Applause] [Music] many times we get impatient like a child with great anticipation jump way ahead and that hinders the work until the world get caught up we must move reverently have a purpose in our heart in the god if he desires to do something such but wait till he makes the opening and he talk about david wait till you hear the wrestling mulberry tree you must wait to see the hand of god going before you oh praise god adam bride could not wait got told adam and eve multiplying replenish the earth it was an uncommon promise she was not his wife yet because she had not lived with her the bride of christ is not his wife yet the wedding supper is to take place woman engaged a fine young clean man they come together and what chief he found she's pregnant by somebody else then her own citizens betrothed that's what christ found couldn't wait and that's what the matter with the people today they can't wait for the real holy spirit here we go to take the church in position they can't wait for the real come on now i will i promise you the holy ghost isn't that right so the real holy ghost is promised and we're waiting for the real holy ghost that produces real power real forgiveness real brotherly kindness not temporary kindness the honey disappear gave them for this power judas was there everybody at power and they come back to you said lord in the devil subject to us yet you don't rejoice because of that i know you're feeling powerful don't have no character they're just empowered because of a word jesus put anointing upon them he said we tried to create a name in heaven rejoice because of that don't we shall become devil power because that's him power upon them when peter time computer run you know yes i'm saying then peter even caught up man physical sword you feeling fighters jesus jesus had to pick up the money and put it back on you can imagine that romans saw your losses head by the sword and jesus pick it up and just like stick it back yeah man is the man that made the air you just stick it back who use this sword fight by the sword die by the saw just peter don't don't even put that saw thing don't bring that short thing inside here your natural thing can work inside it take more than that because your emotions say i'll die for you but i just woke up that just woke up the intellect they're not connecting with the door that's just the intellectual thing at work there isn't that right but when peter got the holy ghost peter was ready he was ready to die for christ because paul was resident it wasn't temporary power it was permanent power it was so much a power you could say silver and gold i don't have what god gave me i could give and i release to you what i have rise up and walk oh oh glory are you with me so god wants to give you something authorize you with something isn't that right so they can't wait until the real holy spirit take the church in position they got to manufacture something isn't that right praise the name of the lord instead of waiting for the real word of god to be manifest to the bride that's the kind that makes the world of a true bride bringing forth children instead of adam coming to her for a bride when the time appointed would be just like christ would come to the group christ would have come to his church he promised to do it god promised to multiply but he had was to wait until god's time but they want something big they want something amen educated and so intellectual he said now the seed that she was holding would have finally become a mother by the will of god through the spoken word spoken with eve isn't that right but she couldn't wait isn't that right now as soon as she accepted the wisdom with the word you see and wisdom was contrary to the word if wisdom is with the word and proves to be with the word and the word produces itself by the same thing then it is the word but if wisdom is against the word and not with the word but trying to find something to add to it or take from it it's of the devil and the holy ghost sees of the bible here we go cannot grow in the atmosphere of wisdom so that is why the intellectual gospel can't cut it in this hour the only way it can go is to separate itself from all reasons and believe the word isn't that right so he gave his army his word we are not 45 behind the nomination we don't 45 behind groups we are fortified by the word of god so god gave this time of lingering since brother branham left a time of lingering waiting for the amorites to be cops to be full waiting for seeds to come in how i thank god for this season i have loved ones out there i show you of loved ones out there but their seasons about to come because the spirit is about to be released it's a time of judgment but the bible in revelation 22 17 said the spirit and the bride say come how could the bride have a voice without the spirit the spirit have to come upon the brine to give the bride a voice that the bride of the authorities to come whosoever will the bride will become the fountain of living water oh hallelujah she herself among zion she will be the fountain of living water whosoever will come and drink of the water of life freely because jesus said he that believeth on me as the scripture had said out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water therefore deprived will be like that attention well bringing up function of spirit because the seven perfect spirits that came out to elohim will be resident in the bride even the pillar of fire and there is my spirit flowing freely oh hallelujah it's gonna flow brother it's gonna floor oh my god my god my god my god my god there's gonna be a fight for ministry with the full seizure in the body releasing the spirit why peter spit these words oh hallelujah glory to god amen so god put us under waiting when he said wait page three or four until them seven thunders utter the voices of that group we have to wait and we're gonna slice and cut but we're going to wait and take wait upon the lord showing you their strength there's going to be a people are going to wait upon god and they're going to hear from god and the devil will move them they're going to be anointed with power they'll be anointed with the spoken word they'll be anointed and they want to speak the word they're going to flash just like that oh glory to god hallelujah oh hallelujah just a few more hallelujah but abandoned preacher message called the masterpiece we know it talk about michelangelo talk about the vision yet of moses isn't that right he had the vision isn't that right nobody else had the vision and the challenge was to stick with division for all those years because they're bringing that sculpture it's not overnighting number one wheating is a vision that's in his heart and he is hammering away he is chopping out what is not moses is the vision of moses anybody see them chopping they don't know what he's busting out he's hitting the rack here he's hitting his rock here and you who don't understand what he's hearing out you will find it's just a big bunch of noise adjecti a man they don't know what he's seeing but he is hitting here he is hitting here in his mind he is here not moses and he is sticking out he has taken out what is not moses what is not acceptable to look like moses he is taking it out he is chopping it out he is hewn it out and god is about to chop and hew and cut and take out all what is done by him because we are going to be just like him could somebody say amen could somebody say amen are you with me oh hallelujah glory can we give another [Applause] any genuine sculptor is inspired any genuine poet no what was that genuine not people who said poet and they can write any genuine singer some people cannot sing read poems any genuine singer musicians whatever it might be all real has to come by inspiration and michelangelo must have had the inspiration of what moses looked like he caught in his mind and so forth and watch and i think of many hard years of labor how he had to hold that same vision all the time he couldn't change the prophetic vision he couldn't come a new vision every monday morning never knew moses moses so poses so moses so poses so when when he referred to moses it has to have a vision that he could work with calvin knew moses monday morning and next month and different moses a new revelation here a new revelation here it has to have one revelation this is the revelation here this is the revelation of perfection oh give the lord a shelter praise this is the image that gonna be you the statue of a perfect man [Applause] oh it's a god gonna chop out what is that perfection god gonna cut out your feelings the emotions make it people hurt people hurt and they get hurt oh god i feel hurt and i heard that hurt how long have you lost thank god god's not like you know because i feel hurt look what i didn't do oh god i put him in the gun i should not do that no you make god like give daughters some abc class or something so all god decision is perfect he can't uncorrect it i don't know undo edit undo what i know undo he's a function of wisdom he put adam there he put everything set until his back he gets a reason in his back he didn't want to see but he know what's going to happen and he waiting for what to happen happen because he wanted to be a healer but there's nobody sick he wanted a redeemer but there's nobody lost he wasn't your savior nobody lost [Music] no maker you're making me feel the preach now you you sit down now now god didn't tell adam go and fall god is adam faulkner waiting for the father looking for you for wait maybe four no god didn't do that man had free will free choice god pulled a woman onto the man god didn't talk to eve go talk to adam i don't know the word adam was teaching eve the word the serpent wasn't so stupid but he's a smart guy he know he's not going to talk to adam i don't know what god say he know he get blown the serpent no i don't want to blow him out so the super no not to go so go where the emotions is at go where feeling feel is that go to the woman go and talk to eve and he went to eve what did god say because god are talking to him he said god talking to me you know what what god tell me let's tell me about what god tell you is god say you can eat up all the trees but the treatments don't eat because day you shall die he said come on let me show you something you should don't tell anybody you shall not surely call your side and tell you between you and i you shall not surely die because god know you'll be like god you'll be wise you're feeling it and after that that was it when her husband come she gave her husband and then adam was not deceived he loved his wife and then they fell and satan rejoiced satan hell i'm shaking help we did it we did it good job good job and god said insult in so let me raise up evil and god sent a whole plan and satan don't even know the whole redemptions that unfold god said that we we are wrong instead of high abraham faith isaac love jacob grace to the perfection ghost had to bring prophet after prophet after prophet of the prophet [Applause] because god about to restore glory you will be seated then john the baptist comes in jerusalem then the church pentecost then the ages and then god knows the end he promised the manifestation of the sons of god whole creation groaning and waiting till the book come back on the earth this book never was on the earth's adam lost it it was only when the mighty angel from revelation 10 come with the swept back wings one with the seventh shield with the book open seven thunders out of their voices to bring back the authority back on the earth to bring back redemption reclaiming rights the authority to be healed the authority to be saved they are told to be redeemed to tell that that they will get out the authority to go free their authority to get back to be in eden again what an authority is here [Applause] hallelujah listen um to prove it to confirm it when but a brand and wife was sick going for operation god tell him he was on the fields and god said him speak and he said before the doctor's hand touches my wife the tumor will go down he had didn't have to touch her he didn't have to be there with her he just had to speak because that's what adam had the power to speak because that's what god does let there be let there be let there be and in mark 11 22 said if you shall say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart you can't have what you say understand the power of it jesus took five loaves and two fishes blessed it break it and said feed them people and as they break it it was just multiplying break bread and rejoice i'll be baptized multiply power of god the power of the spoken word jesus demonstrated it by saying lazarus come forward but the bran was on a boat catch a fish the fish went dead he's not right threw it in the dead for half an hour all of a sudden he said he couldn't stop uttering them voices he's a little fishy listen i give you back your life and that fishy turn over and run i give you back your life and if god can send power on a little fish that will death someday what about you sitting here [Applause] do you believe that that same power that fish could touch your life you're not dead [Applause] you may be dull but you're not dead and if you're dead all the toilets of sorrows distress i'm on the home stretch critics everything else but he stayed right with the vision until it was completed and we will stay right with the prophetic vision until this would become flesh until them tunnels begin to flash not talk flash flash the devil they see lightning flashing them colors when you walk the street the devil's going to cry out because the thunder's flashing known it's lit voices tested voices tried voices isn't that right thundering voices shaking the devil that's the thunder that are going to shake the terror they're getting seven of them oh glory to god you'll be hot you know oh yes oh glory hallelujah hallelujah understand this what you know peter didn't know but they were adopted without the full revelation of the open book but here we are with full revelation things that moses didn't even have think about the prophets didn't he have many wise men would have loved to be in this age to see what you see and hear what you hear i cannot be the same i cannot walk the same not when god reaching mercy put me in this last day to take the last leg of this relay to run down to the resurrection there is no more generation coming this is the final generation [Applause] listen man never made a weapon in the news slingshot bow and arrow m them cannon with one ball at a time boom everything man me to use so all them atomic bombs and nuclear and how much russia have in america you think this justine idol brother branham in the seventh vision he saw america bummed up that's right blown up we said north america reaching the tribulation that's serious sin when those angels think the price gonna still be here people could be rushing to churches and oh yes you know the feeling to you got things happening you better don't let that catch you you know your sign is not outside that vinegar is a prophet but we believe here inside already your sign is the token for your house [Applause] your time is the token for your family understand this understand this moses had what to sell for plagues because pharaoh in his inertia thought he keeping people continually forever and ever and ever amen and moses come and say no i come to break that i come to bring an external force to interrupt your power over these people they are not yours they belong to the god of israel isn't that right they belong to god the i am sophia didn't want to let them go plagues frogs flies fleas everything full works then the last death angel that that teen shall come instructions from go take a lamb someone has to die take the blood and put it out on a doorpost you can't hide it no more so even though you just paint your house white two days before you have to bloody it up and if you're proud and arrogant and you're touchy about peace and you don't want no red on your white you died [Applause] are you with me if you're proud and haughty and your issues and whatnot about paint about your color you died because the instruction was straight put it on the door post and when i see the blood you have to see it i will pass over you when i see the blood no it's no longer the literal blood no it's the spirit so he's got to see the holy spirit when i see the spirit upon you that means the spirit has to come upon the pride as a seal as a sign as a token as a confirmation as a witness or as an advocate the spirit itself when i see that then i'm going to pass over you then you have power over debt what abandonment said not even death gonna stop this pride you're not hearing what i'm saying this is the age that that itself going to be challenged the grim reaper they're going to snatch his arrow there pull it away grim reaper you'll get grim when he recognizes he got tortured though get hacked no power over the blood wash [Applause] you wanna be seated understand this every man born of a woman has to die but we are promised a rapture we promise a change in the body we promise of people that will not see that our people will be changed power on the inside meeting power on the outside and your flesh in between your fresh gas standard power on the inside charity fire on the outside and your flesh in between sandwich inside that air changing in a moment and i think of an eye oh hallelujah i feel like running and leaping over a wall oh praise god oh my god up here now he's making a bride and we know the story moses when when michelangelo finished so it was so inspiring what he taught in his mind what he had in his heart was not in front of him he'd take his mullet and hitting him about speak and it formed a little crack on the knee and brown said that's not making a masterpiece because god went finished when god finished with jesus his son he smoked him at calvary and will speak oh hallelujah he was stricken and smitten of men he was smitten and god said speak hallelujah he was a perfect image of the living god and when god bring back men in his image and likeness he could to smite them once more and will speak the bride will be spitting from the church the bride will be joseph the pride will be rejected of men the pride will be the word and the word is always rejected so get ready to be rejected because you are mrs jesus christ other women are good but you are the best oh give the lord a shout of praise come on now long time he
