lord may you walk into each home tonight lord we know you father lord as father the mystery of god revealed lord when you walk this earth and lord throughout all the ages lord how you hid yourself in the word lord and tonight we want to lord fellowship around that word and take inspiration from lord those who have gone before and lord knowing fully well that we stand now with the baton in our hand as it were lord to cross the finish line father so may you bless us may you be with us may you take complete control of his bible study tonight in the precious name of jesus christ amen and amen and amen greetings church it's really a great privilege and an honor to be here tonight uh i feel i'm behind a wheel that i haven't driven in some time um as we have navigated this this new normal and all of these uncertainties and these ups and downs and these these different things that are happening around us in the different realms um that they're supposed to happen in and we also have our realm that we are supposed to live in and dwell in and take inspiration from and we are not supposed to let uh what is happening in these other realms the financial realm the echo the ecclesiastical realm the governmental realms and you know we come from another kingdom we come from another world we come from another time zone as it were so what pulses us so what excites us so what interests us is completely different so i really want to salute berovid for the bible studies um that uh over the last few weeks and um i'm here tonight by the grace of god to sort of kind of you know share a little thought with you from the scriptures and i pray that it will be a blessing uh to you tonight so uh trust everybody had a wonderful day and that you had the devil running you had the devil talking and bobbing and weaving i pray that you were not the one ducking and bobbing and weaving but you had the enemy ducking bobbing and weaving you know so yes we ought to be on on the offensive you know if you're on the offensive you know then the devil is always on your run you know the bible said resist the devil and he will flee from free from us you know so i want to thank everyone for making it out tonight and looking for a little time in the lord so i want to start with a little introduction um before i get to my thought tonight and i want to start with paul and uh paul is you know when you agree to the scripture and we talked about it that sometimes when you slow down as it will and you read you start to see things you see more things and i see more things and i see more things and i really find paul to be really a tremendous tremendous study you know so i kind of wrote some things down i just want to kind of read what i wrote before i get to my actual um focus tonight so paul and this is how i wrote it paul formerly known as saul you know and all of us we have a formerly known as you know is this former us and there's this this newer version of us so i like that paul formerly known as saul a pharisee of pharisees an academic a man of conviction a man willing to kill for what he believed a man who would orchestrate the killing of stephen a deacon his passion to defend the law of moses and his lack of a personal experience with god made him both a weapon of the law and an enemy of the followers of jesus his studies under gamaliel had armed him with wisdom and understanding that blinded him to the truth that the lord jesus christ was the messiah against this backdrop and without his knowledge or his consent so i want to say that again against his backdrop and without his knowledge or consent he would have been chosen as a star in the right hand of god one of only seven stars and the reality is without your knowledge and without your consent we have been chosen by god so here is this man called paul formerly known saul without his knowledge or consent he will be chosen as a star in your right hand of god one of only seven stars a messenger to the gentiles a messenger to the first church age the apostle who would have the audacity to withstand peter on doctrine and become known for his many letters to many churches but the branham would refer to paul as the gold standard in other words the plum line against which every messenger that would follow would be measured against brother branham would rejoice with the comfort of knowing that he preached what paul preached a lot could be said about paul but interestingly he is not our focus tonight biblical scholars in studying paul's journeys and his timeline have worked very hard to figure out which of paul's letters was the last one that he wrote i preached a message some time ago about the last words of the great warrior joshua last words are very important they have very special meaning especially or more so when you know that they that they may be your last words paul would write to the ephesians paul would write to the colossians paul would write to a galatians paul would write to philemon paul would write to timothy paul will write to titus paul the right to the hebrews paul will write to the romans paul will write to the thessalonians paul will write to the corinthians and paul will also write to the philippians careful research would indicate that from all appearances paul's last letter would more than likely be written to timothy for in second timothy 4 6 to 7 we find paul saying for i am now ready to be offered the time of my departure is at hand i have fought a fight i fought a good fight i have finished my course i have kept defeat paul didn't have any family that had all been forsaken for the gospel so he called timothy his son his beloved son in second timothy 1 6 he would reference he began the good work in timothy by the laying on of hands had seen a lot of battles a lot of beatings and trouble from the first day he actually met paul paul would encourage timothy to endure hardness hardness and and by now you know where i'm at my thought tonight or bible study tonight is lessons from timothy part one i know i spoke about a study of daniel part one and i haven't gone to part two i'm just doing what i'm inspired to do so tonight is lessons of timothy part one because i know just as daniel have a part two to come this will have a part two to come so timothy had seen many battles many beatings and trouble since the first day he met paul paul encouraged him to endure hardness are you willing to endure hardness it's not easy to endure hardness you know but imagine your message of paul to timothy is to endure hardness strive for mastery strive lawfully suffer for christ rightly divide the word flee youthful desires seek righteousness faith love and peace and to avoid foolish questions there's such a thing as foolish questions and be gentle what exhortation from this great apostle paul to this young man named timothy so who is timothy brother branham said he would be known as the first bishop the first pastor of the ephesians church at ephesus so when we talk about back to ephesians and another ephesians then it means we we are we are trying to parallel against the leadership and a time when you'll have timothy was was was the first pastor of ephesians so we have to look at this timothy where he comes from where he going what was his connection what was his nature his attributes how he operated and most interestingly what would paul share with this young man who would become the first pastor of this great church at ephesus so let's go a little deeper i trust that you're riding with me tonight oh encouragement a little inspiration timothy was from the lyconian city of lystra in asia minor born of a jewish mother who was a believer and a greek father we'll talk a little bit about that in a little bit paul would meet him on his second missionary journey and he will become paul's companion and co-worker along with silas the new testament indicates that timothy traveled with paul and paul was his mentor and paul entrusted him with very important assignments let us start to talk about timothy and then we're going to get we are building a background to get to the scripture timothy didn't come from the right background within the context of what paul was trying to achieve and paul's own struggle with the hierarchy in jerusalem and his ministry to the gentiles his desire to take timothy under his wings came with certain issues because timothy would have been from two lines so to speak he was neither fully jew nor fully greek because his mother was a jew and his father was a greek you could find timothy all through the new testament in fact in acts chapter 16 and verse 1 if you have your bible you could find it acts 61 he says then came he to derby and lystra and behold a certain disciple was there named timotheus that's timothy the son of a certain woman which was a jewish and believed but you see whenever the bible talks about but it creates it creates this issue in scripture but his father was a greek so the fact that is being placed there meant this was actually being perceived as somewhat of an issue all right so again acts 16 and verse 1 so a lot of people who look at the book of timothy see timothy as first timothy second timothy but we're gonna find timothy all to the new testament all right then came he to derby and list from behold a certain disciple was there named timotheus the son of a certain woman she is described as a certain woman here but paul would later even call her by name because he that's how close he was to this young man named timothy a certain woman which was a jewish and believer but his father was a greek which was well reported of by the brethren in other words when paul got there and looked at it everybody had a good report about this young man named timothy could it be said about you that there's a good report about you so which was well reported of by the brethren that were at lystra and iconium him speaking about timothy would paul have to go with him who fought with him and took listen carefully and circumcise him because of the jews which were in those quarters now if you recall the debates between paul and peter it was about what would be the the gentiles adhering to the laws so here it is because in in i believe it was paul i think titus or one of those he he he had others who he didn't even force the issue of circumcision but with timothy him would paul have to go with him and took and circumcise him not because of the law but because of the jews which were in those quarters well listen for they knew all that his father was a greek so i'm showing here now the wisdom of paul that because of the role that timothy would have to play to cover his bases so to speak not because of the law but because he understood his audience he understood who timothy would in time have to interact with he understood what timothy's ministry would become even before timothy himself knew where he was going such an example from paul and this principle we will find in 1st corinthians 9 because this is paul's thinking and it really helps us elevate our thinking to higher thinking first corinthians 9 verse 19 says for though i be free from all men yet have i made myself servant unto all that i might gain them more so instead of paul saying boy timothy you don't need to be circumcised you know let me just forget everybody but paul is exercising a higher wisdom because it's more expedient to do so so first corinthians 9 20 and unto the jews i became as a jew that i might gain the jews to them that are under the law as under the law that i might gain them that are under the law that them are without the law as without law being not without law to god but under the law to christ that i might gain them that are without law so the week became i as weak that i might gain the weak i am made all things to all men that by all means i might save some so this is a underlying principle that paul operates with so in taking timothy under his wings we see that paul is positioning timothy a certain way for what his ministry will be but it also underscores that timothy's lineage the fact that his father was not in church did not stop what god's purpose was in his life and even deeper it shows that timothy now is making a decision that has nothing to do with when my father is a greek and this is how i was raised he is being persuaded by a higher calling and he's abandoning principles and making a choice to follow after something that is greater trust this is helping somebody this evening i want to go a little deeper here paul would now reference the fact that timothy didn't even have a spiritual father figure as it were because timothy father is an unbeliever i want i want to bring the context to show that it is about choice as well leaving his mother and grandmother the responsibility of raising timothy in the ways of god and we will go back over this again because it's worth reading this but second timothy verse second timothy 1 1 paul an apostle of jesus christ by the will of god not by his own will so second timothy one verse one paul an apostle of jesus christ by the will of god according to the promise of life which is in christ jesus to timothy my dearly beloved son grace mercy and peace from god the father and christ jesus our lord listen to how paul is expressing himself now notice this in all likelihood is the very last time that paul is writing i turn god who myself from my forefathers with pure conscience that without ceasing i have remembrance of thee in my prayers night and day greatly desiring to see thee being mindful of thy tears that i may be filled with joy and listen to what he is remembering as well when i call to remembrance rebuilding a background when i call to remembrance the unfined fate that is in thee which dwelled first in thy grandmother lois and thy mother eunice this certain woman eunice that i am persuaded that envy also so i want to draw reference here to you mothers and your grandmothers to never underestimate the power of your faith and of your prayer because you have no idea how the seed of your prayer and your feet can be manifested in the right time and in the right season don't underestimate it everybody with me tonight can the church say man so without timothy having a father figure and there are many and we live in a messed up world now where we say men have lost their place in society there's a difference between being male and being a man you could have the gender but being a man is more than being male having a child is different from being a father but yet you have timothy as it were going against the odds there are many people who say well because i didn't have a role model or because i didn't have a father figure or because my father wasn't in church and and they they stack all of these excuses of why they can't do certain things here is young timothy whose father is not in church father is not a believer being raised by his mother and his grandmother as it were but he still makes a choice a decision to take responsibility for his spiritual life i want us to to just meditate on that a little bit and maybe it'll help somebody to look at themselves and say there really is no excuse all right i want to encourage you just say there is no excuse i want you to say there is no excuse i challenge people all the time for every person who says because of this i couldn't do because of this i don't have because of this i can't achieve there is somebody else with that same limitation who has gone on to do who has gone on to achieve who has gone on to acquire whatever it is and it comes back to a firm determination to do to achieve to see it acquire and it really has nothing to do with your heritage or where you come from but it's about making the decisions and the conscious actions to do something about the present and about the future i underscore tonight there is nothing we could do to change the past there is nothing we can do to change yesterday there's nothing we do to change an hour ago there's nothing but what happens now and from now on is actually within your hands and the decisions you make is what determines the outcome of your life whatever it is you want to achieve in life it comes down to you making a decision can the church say amen so i'm building a background of this young man timothy to to try to figure out what would have built up this situation all right so paul in instructing timothy so i'm saying a few things would encourage him to avoid temptation in first timothy 6 and verse 20 you say ultimately keep that which is committed to thy trust in in other words you have a responsibility to keep that which is committed to thy trust and and look how he is to keep it avoiding profane and vain babbling you see many times for us our trouble isn't what we're saying our trouble isn't our conversations but the brandon would reference that he had somebody in his car one time who spoke a blue streak in other words you could leave service feeling so great and somebody says something to you that just deflate you or you could leave feeling inspired tonight and you get involved in a you know you know in a political debate you get involved in an argument about the coronavirus and before you know it all of the annoying thing that is being built up because in the world gets destroyed because you're into profane and vain battling so ultimately keep that which is committed to thy trust so tonight you're being given stuff you're being it's been committed to your trust god is trusting you with his word he's trusting you with this tonight and and and he wants you to be committed avoiding profane and vain babblings and oppositions of science falsely so-called in other words there are certain conversations you should never be in there are certain debates you should never be in and that's the challenge with many young people today they end up in conversations about god and about this and about this and before they know it and i'm so messed up so paul is warning timothy don't find yourself in them conversations and don't and don't try to get in a scientific debate about these kind of things which some in verse 21 professing have heard according to defeat can the church say amen so paul is instructing the same timothy to avoid conversations and controversies so that he would not be tempted to buy into into false knowledge and false ideas and false explanations and false interpretations can the church say man building still we're going to get to our reading in a short while we his exact age is not given but we know that paul had to encourage timothy to not allow others to look down upon him for his age as he would bring reform to the church in ephesus we would see in first timothy 4 and verse 12 paul would say to timothy let no man despise thy youth but be thou and listen to the young people here now be thou an example of the believers how in word an example in word and if this is an instruction to the young people a young timothy how much more the seniors among us should be an example to the believers in wood are you an example to believers in wood that's that's a powerful one to know are you an example to the believers in word that's one in conversation are you an example of the believers so when people see you are you an example of the believers in conversation he goes on in charity are you an example of the believers in charity it sounds great i am in the message i believe the message i believe the prophet i believe the inspiration are you an example of the believers in charity in spirit are you an example in faith are you an example impurity all that is in that version let no man despise thy youth but be thou an example of the believers in word in conversation in charity in spirit in faith in purity till i come listen to his instruction to timothy till i come give attendance to reading to exhortation and to doctrine so he's encouraging because timothy is a young minister but give attention to reading to exhortation to doctrine can the church say amen timothy would have a heart for god and we see here in first timothy because we're not going to spend too much time in festivity tonight i want to get to second timothy for our reading and our study tonight in 1st timothy 3 and verse 14 he actually ends that chapter as it were with an encouragement to him that these things i write unto thee hoping to come unto thee shortly so in the absence of paul's physical meeting with timothy he's writing this but if i tarry along i'm writing this that daumayas know how thou art is to behave thyself in the house of god which is the church of the living god the pillar and ground of truth now to put a little context on this these letters to timothy is in the later part of paul's ministry so timothy would have already had the opportunity to be involved in ministry with paul but here it is paul essentially let me show him listen i want you to understand how to behave yourself in the house of god you mean tell me after all these years of the message is that people who still can't behave and you also do you know i don't want to i don't want to drive down that road but here it is paul is speaking to timothy about how to behave yourself in the house of god which is the church of the living god the pillar and ground of truth look at how paul describes timothy to the church in filepie or what we call the philippians philippians 2 and verse 19 philippians 2 and verse 19 but i trust in the lord jesus to send timotheus or timothy shortly unto you that i also may be of good comfort when i know your state i'll say that again but i trust in the lord jesus to send timothy shortly unto you that i also may be of good comfort when i know your state in other words i can't wait are trusting in the law because i want this intimacy to you quickly that i can feel good when i know what's going on with you listen to his words for i have no man like-minded that's a powerful statement so this great star in the right hand of god this gold standard that the prophet would describe this this this measuring line that would cut through all of the ages would describe timothy as i have no man like-minded i've not encountered a man like-minded who operates like me who thinks like me who will naturally care for your state so i want you to see that there meaning naturally carefully so it's not a show it's not a put on timothy has a genuine heart i want to present timothy as somebody that you could emulate you can look up to you could take inspiration from naturally care for yesterday and he goes on for all seek their own verse 21 not the things which are jesus christ but ye know the proof of him in other words you know his testimony you know timothy this timothy i want to send to you against the backdrop of those who seek their own and not the things of christ you know the proof of timothy that as a son with the father he had served me in the gospel so that's the kind of report that timothy was able to get as a scorecard from the apostle paul him therefore i hope to send presently or right away so soon as i shall see how it will go with me so depending on how things go with me i will send timothy as quickly as possible to you but i trust in the lord that i also myself shall come shortly now a lot of people don't realize how close the relationship between paul and timothy was in fact and if you have a bible you could go with me let us read uh second corinthians chapter one now many people when they look at these letters they say okay paul wrote the letter right so we understand that but look how second corinthians 1 is introduced and i just want you to see the pattern all right so suddenly you see the book hide in there but there are simple things that kind of nudge you right so ii corinthians 1 listen carefully paul an apostle of jesus christ by the will of god and timothy our brother unto the church of god which is at corinth so this letter to the corinthians is not just from paul alone are you with me so this letter to the corinthians this second letter to the corinthians paul an apostle of jesus christ by the will of god and timothy our brother unto the church of god which is at so timothy some have called him the co-author but he's right here with paul all right let's go to philippians philippians 1 1. paul and timotheus the servants of jesus christ so once again this letter to the philippians is not just paul's letter to the philippians paul and matthias the servants of jesus christ to all the saints in christ jesus which are at philippi with the bishops and the deacons are you seeing a pattern there now let's go to colossians can i move in i hope you're moving too fast this is bible study right suppose you just spin this thing right colossians 1 1 paul an apostle of jesus christ by the will of god and timothy is our brother so we are starting to see a pattern that when you read timothy this is not just a book in the new testament this is a word for a young man who has seen a lot who has been informed enough because each of these churches had their own issues to deal with but paul actually was also teaching not just discipleship but successorship he was also speaking to his protege so to speak a young man who you would understand would be positioned because he is in the loop on what is going on look at first thessalonians let's go first thessalonians verse one first thessalonians verse one this one is even expanded this is paul and salvanas would be silas so paul and sylvanas and timotheus unto the church of the thessalonians which is in this this one is too good to get ready for this world so indulge me just let's read read the first five verse right paul and sylvanas and timotheus so timothy is there again unto the church of the thessalonians which is in god the father and in the lord jesus christ grace be unto you and peace from god our father and the lord jesus christ we give thanks we give thanks so paul is writing but he's speaking they're speaking together we give thanks to god always for you all making mention of you in our prayers so it means he's speaking on timothy's behalf so timothy was also burdened bearing not just for the ephesians church but timothy is also burden-bearing for the the church in thessalonica as well i want you to see context here a young man with a burden all right remembering without ceasing your work of faith and labor of love and patience of hope in our lord jesus christ in the sight of god and our father knowing brethren beloved your election of god for our gospel so this is what paul saying for my gospel but for our gospel came not unto you in word only but also in power and in the holy ghost and in much assurance as he know what manner of men we were among you for your sake so that's why i said you'll see timothy now all through the new testament we we wouldn't read the rest but you'll find it in 2nd thessalonians you'll also find it in philemon all of these written in collaboration with paul or timothy being in the loop with paul as well i trust this has been a blessing to you tonight okay so now let us we're going to spend a little time in second timothy tonight and we're going to take it from second timothy uh verse chapter one verse one we kind of rev this a little bit but we're gonna let's take a little slowly let's spend a little time on it tonight and see how far we can get i i have a desired destination point and we'll see by the grace of god um how far we can get all right paul an apostle of jesus christ by the will of god i like that you know we we speak often of of the ministry and the fightful ministry and and there are many who are debate to fight for ministry and there are people who vote themselves elect themselves aspire desired but paul is saying an apostle of jesus christ by the will of god it was not his own choosing all right according to the promise of life which is in christ jesus to timothy my dearly beloved son grace peace grace mercy and peace from god the father and christ jesus our lord i thank god who myself from my forefathers with pure conscience that without ceasing i have remembrance of thee in my prayers night and day are you praying night and day that's a that that's a principle i don't want this to just be words to you but i want you to enter into paul's world now paul here is in prison writing this uh this is this is not him writing on his bed this is not him writing on the breakfast table and he have a cup of coffee and ham and ham and omelette and and and he relaxes this is paul in prison right in this thing now greatly desiring to see thee being mindful of thy fears the ideas that i might be filled with joy when i call to remembrance the unfair faith that is in me which dwelt first in thy grandmother lois and thy mother eunice and i am persuaded that in thee also verse six let's go wherefore i put thee in remembrance that thou still up the gift of god which is in thee by the putting on of my hands so paul is actually taking timothy through somewhat of his spiritual genealogy so to speak your grandmother your mother i lay my hands on you i want you to remember that in that encounter that experience and if you are in this room tonight it is not just coming to church that keeps you going there's some experience you would have had some encounter you would have had because without an encounter with god it is impossible for you to stay in in this channel so to speak it could have been 20 years ago it could have been five years ago it could have been a little cha whatever it was there had to be a supernatural encounter that no matter what trouble you're going through you can still remember how it was for some they talk about 1983 for some 1982 for some 1993 but some is 1987 and everybody it's a personal thing and here it is paul in building his encouragement to timothy is saying i want you to to put the in remembrance that you're still up the gift of god which is envy by the putting on of my hands and then paul begins to preach or to encourage true now his word to timothy now we don't know at this point what state timothy is in this is the reverse situation all of the other letters we reference was paul and timothy write into people we write into the thessalonians we write into the colossians we write into these other people this is timothy in that situation was on the right hand side of things he was on the giving side of things here it is now the situation is reversed it is it is as if after paul and timothy and the others have poured all of their resources into these groups and these churches it as if paul is now filling up timothy's tank so to speak so he can continue to run the race is this connecting with anybody tonight it is important for you to be able to recharge your batteries this letter to timothy is paul trying to charge up timothy's batteries he tell him stir up the gift the gift is there you know but it hasn't been stirred up he is there nobody to stir it up you need to you need to remember i want you to remember how god took it through i want you to remember your praying grandmother i want you to remember the first service you went to i wanted to remember the joy you had when you first came into contact with god i want you to i want you to be grounded by where you started from because you didn't start yourself he didn't start when your grandmother was praying he wasn't there when your mother was praying you wasn't there this thing didn't start with you it started before you anybody with me tonight hallelujah you couldn't be here tonight if something didn't stand before you because you couldn't start it you didn't start it it is not your choosing but it was god who chose you and allowed you to be in the house that you were in allowing you to be in your family the neighborhood walking on the street when you when you first hear the full service whatever it was that brought you to that spot so paul wants to carry timothy somewhere but your car start from nowhere you need to start with where you come from you have to start with your with your with your pedigree with your with your heritage with what brought you to where you're at anybody with me tonight so we still have 1v7 for god has not given us a spirit of fear that alone deals with coronavirus that deals with the economy that deals with recession that deals with your health problems that deals with your children backsliding that deal with your business falling apart that these were losing your home whatever it is for god had not given us the spirit of fear this is paul's last letter paul is writing not just to timothy but he's writing for those who will read this letter to timothy anybody with me tonight for god hath not give us given us the spirit of fear but of power and of love and of a sound mind so don't tell me tonight you're losing your mind don't tell me tonight you're you're you're so under it that deal you want to give up a sound mind i want to challenge a church tonight that god gave us a sound mind a sound mind to make the right decisions a sound mind to make the right choices a sound mind to lift above the situations and the circumstances anybody with me tonight can the church say man i can't see most of you but that is a better reason to be shouting and jumping because nobody can see you turn your room into a room of noise and worship and shouting because we are sitting tonight like young timothy whether you're young in defeat whether you're young in a journey we are all like timothy tonight being written to by the apostle of apostles by the first time the right hand of god and taking inspiration from it he seemed inspiration every messenger who would come after him would take anybody with me tonight be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our lord this is verse 8 or no of me his prisoner now i love this i love this paul is in a roman prison but he not counting the prisoner as the romans [Laughter] he said be no doubt therefore ashamed of the testimony of our lord nor of me his prisoner the romans think they locked me up but i lock up by jesus long time somebody somebody gave god a shout out praise he said i am his prisoner you romans think they have me locked up but i'm locked up i'm jesus prisoner and i'm happy to be his prisoner and the church say amen no atmosphere but be thou partaker of the afflictions of the gospel according to the power of god so they are afflictions of the gospel that is part of the territory that is part of the garment we have to wear part of the experience we have to wear part of the struggle we have to carry the afflictions of the gospel when your family don't want to talk to you when you have to walk away from the work encounter when you have to walk away from situations when you have to to do things a certain way for the cause of the gospel afflictions of the gospel can the church say man anybody with me young people calebs fathers mothers those who are strong those who are getting stronger not even calling you weak those who are strong and those who are getting stronger tonight partakers of the afflictions of the gospel according to the power of god he goes on who had saved us and called us i don't want you to forget it now understand this paul is preaching to a preacher paul is teaching a teacher paul is pastoring a pastor and he is bringing words of encouragement do you know your pastor has been encouragement do you know the assistant passes you know you need ella's you have people who want to walk around so whole yeah than though paul is in a spiritual realm and seen a young pastor need a word a young preacher need an encouragement and he would say to him who had saved us and called us with an holy calling not according to our works we didn't have anything to do with it but according to his own purpose oh if you ever feel discouraged remember remember who had called who had saved us and called us with a holy calling not according to our works but according to his own purpose and grace which was given us in christ jesus before the world began so paul first took timothy back to his mother back to his grandmother back to when he laid hands at him and by verse 9 he taken before the world began to say if if you have any issues along that line or you have any memories to taint how this thing works for you too let me take you back way back before the world began can the church say amen could he take some more i'll take a i feel like i'm preaching here this must be a bible study making me feel like a preaching but is now made manifest by the appearing of our savior jesus christ so paul is in his whole purpose that we didn't even know about that was not by our works it was not by our own choosing we sort of stumble into it but it's now made manifest by the appearing of our savior jesus christ who have abolished death so dead is actually abolishing them debt is abolished and had brought life and immortality to light so in other words we couldn't talk about immortality before but because of the appearing of our savior death is now abolished and our immortality is brought to life to light through the gospel whereunto i am appointed a preacher and an apostle and a teacher of the gentiles for which cause verse 12 for for the which cause i also suffer these things nevertheless i'm not ashamed for i know whom i have believed and i'm persuaded let this be your testimony tonight that he is able to keep that which i have committed unto him against that day can the church say amen hold fast we don't know what tomorrow holds we don't know what next week holds we don't know what next month holds uncertainty i just saw i think was an august the tent or whatever there was riots in chicago or something and it's all it's explosions in it was it lebanon had an explosion a few days in the whole government resign and these things are happening uncertainty and all these things what are you going to hold on to the government what are they going to hold on to your bank account what are you going to hold on to here it is poor listen to the whole fast the form of sound words which thou has heard of me in faith and love which is in christ jesus that good thing is this a bad thing is this negative is this is this what he hearing tonight designed to destroy you and make you feel weak no it's not for that good thing which was committed unto thee keep by the holy ghost which dwelleth in us this thou knowest that all they which are in asia be turned away from me so paul now is beginning how can i describe this in this last letter to share his pains the pains of ministry the pains of effort that have now turned into people walking away and as brother branham would say you could preacher you're blue in the face and people still wouldn't listen he said they always knew that all day which i need to be turned away from me of whom uh fabulous and hell my guinness the lord gave mercy unto the house of oniferous for he of refreshed me and was not ashamed of my chain but when he was in rome he sought me out very diligently and found me the lord grant unto him that he may find mercy of the lord in that day and in how many things he ministered unto me at ephesus don't know his very well so this whole first chapter is reminding timothy now let's go chapter two could you take some more we're going fine now therefore my son be strong in the grace that is in christ jesus where is your strength coming from you have to understand that your strength has to come from the grace that is in christ jesus if it comes from any other source you will reach failure now therefore my son be strong in the grace that is in christ jesus and the things that thou has heard of me among many witnesses the same commit thou the faithful men who shall be able to teach others also so you see paul has this vision of making sure that he would get into the hands of the people you're trying to keep it locked down you're going to keep it secret they're going to keep it now in our book and commonly seeking room and nobody supposed to know he said commit these to faithful men who will continue to spread this thing all right now let's get do we have any soldiers here tonight any soul is in the army of your lord chapter 2 verse 3 now therefore endure hardness as a good soldier of jesus christ i want to read that one more time now therefore in your hardness as a good soldier of jesus christ and i was sharing i can't remember what mitten i was in about the navy seals you know if the lord didn't commit to this am i to be a nearby seal i don't know if i'll make the height requirement i do never maybe speed requirement i still don't know how to swim but i am just blown away by when you see navy seals in action boy it's just like what's not i don't pass the age i think i'm too old now i don't think i ever had any height but what intrigued me about the navy seals is the fact that if we had that kind of training in church i'm not sure how many people would be in this room tonight you know because navy seal training is not encouraging you come on you go make it come on you go make it come on you go fight come on you maybe see you training is the reverse navy sea training is give up now you know you're not strong enough you know they gotta make it you really want to fight you the the training is so hard because they want the best of the best they don't want when they're going through the war you they oh i'm not sure i don't think i want to go on her i don't think i don't think i want to keep climbing this thing i'm seeing too much enemy soldiers can i go back they don't want that so they want to make sure that if you're committed to this thing you could endure hardness he could endure pressure you can endure stress you can endure whatever come your way you know they could lose if you're the last man standing you're not going down if they torture you you're not going down if they turn you upside down one of the training for navy seal is that there's tire up and shoulder in the water they tire up and throw any water no i don't know how else could i want that one because one a car swim so you have to be able to untie yourself and come with water and make it but so but anybody who qualified at an avc would have gone through hardship you have to run a certain distance in a certain time you can run it in the time you want by feeling has been able to say runish and i want to run it in in our that don't cut it because you can't see it only wait wait for me every helicopter i have to leave now you cabbie give me 15 minutes i will catch you it had to leave now you're in enemy territory that is enduring hardship but that don't come by accident that don't come by accident i was sharing it with brother over in a conversation i said there are people who have success that is called accidental success people stumble on success and it's accidental success they just happen to be in the right place they happen to be at the right time they happen to have the right opportunity but there's a difference if it's you liberate success if it's planned success if it's strategic success so shame with brother over in a conversation i said in like you i'm looking at things now i want to move from accidental success to strategic or deliberate or planned success which means you're putting things in place to be where you need to be you don't want to be moving because we've moved you're here that way you're there and you're way full back it will be no you want to live your life that is your your planning your action and that is also scriptural that is scriptural most of us do not spend enough time in prayer most of us don't spend enough time doing an analysis and review you need to slow down slow down look at the word slow down look at the plan slow down ask the question coming to it say man running to and fro running this you're doing this you're doing this you're doing this you're doing this and when you look back you can't track the results of your activity all they could chuck is you're tired [Laughter] that's the testimony you're tired that's tired where's doing this that this was the fruit of it have you considered is there a better way have you considered is a better approach i don't know what end up they are trying to are trying to speak about this thing here so let's go on verse 3 thou therefore endure hardness as a good soldier of jesus christ verse 4 no man that wore it so here paul is speaking of a military militant mindset about the things of god no man that wore it entangled himself with the affairs of this life that he may please him who had chosen him to be a soldier in other words police in nativity focus on the mission anybody with me listen i want to read that verse to you in another translation no soldier gets entangled in civilian pursuits since his aim is to please the one that enlisted him so if you're familiar with the language of military versus civilian in other words if you're in the military act like you're in the military walk like any military talk like in the military live like any man don't act and behave like a civilian because you're a soldier you're under a different law can the church say man do you know if any army the army have their own military police that if something happened you don't go to the regular police that is for the police for the civilians if not the police for the army i'm not their own police you know because they say you can't be treated like the civilians if there's a matter on the army blacks they're not calling the regular police they're calling the army police because they are soldier we expect a certain behavior from you can the church say amen don't read it one more time no soldier gets entangled in civilian pursuits are you guilty tonight of getting entangled in civilian pursuits when you are soldier since your aim is to please the one who enlisted you who signed you up because you didn't sign up i know you didn't sign up you didn't volunteer for this we appreciate that point but somebody sign us up and trust in the battle because the person will sign us up and put us in the battle know that we have what it takes to endure the hardness enjoy the test and to win the battle can the church say amen so no man had wore it entangled himself with the affairs of this life that he may please him that had chosen him to be a soldier and if a man also strives for masteries yet he is not crowned except he strive lawfully listen to that in another translation verse 5 an athlete is not crowned unless he competes according to the rules so paul is bringing a big message to timothy he's saying there's rules to this thing and you want to win the right way there's no you know people like to take shortcuts in life shortcut they want the fast track there's only the quick way so you have people they go and play a mark they want to play lotto they want to win any lottery and it has been proven time and time again every single person who win the lottery give them you can put a clock just come down to when they have no money again you know why they got it without abiding by the rules because there's rules to do things and if you don't develop your rules acquire you will not have the rules to keep anybody with me so because they bypass the rules to acquire and they get it by a shortcut it's one of them at the time i think years ago somebody had winning lottery somewhere in trinidad and when water went they take champagne and watch the car you expect them to have money after two years flat they're broken broken completely broken why they didn't know the sacrifice it takes and again i think i said it in the message have we done enough these principles apply in the natural and in the spiritual if you don't have the discipline to get up to do your schoolwork you don't have to discipline to do your work right i find it hard to believe you have to be disciplined to do your spiritual working on because discipline is a military mindset military mindset you know you wake up a certain time you run a certain time you eat a certain time you dress a certain way you make up your bed first thing in the morning anybody with me oh god help us it's a discipline i see somebody just cringe when i wake up that make everybody know somebody just cringe is it one is it two is it i is it it's a discipline it's a discipline and you find the successful people or what you what is the finest successful is really people who have had a discipline to do the right things the right way all the time and if you develop a principle in life to do the right thing the right way all the time you can only lead to the right results meditate on the word day and night and you have good success day and night is a principle thankfully you're making mark for meditating tonight day and night really night i hope it related to the day so at least today i get a half mark even if it is a mark for the whole day at least getting half mark for meditating in the night i hope we do the new day because day and night meditation we were day and night at least we have tonight everybody i see a good bit of people in this room tonight everybody get a half mark for tonight i don't know who get the whole mark because i did it day and night but what we doing tonight you're supposed to do every night in your own study so that you can now stumble upon things that would inspire you that could raise a question that you could see but i never i know that people who say i never knew timothy wasn't all that much no timothy was there with paul and in here and here and here and and here it is after he was the encourager he is being encouraged after he was the writer he's been written too anybody with me tonight and if a man also strives for masteries yet he's not crowned except he strives lawfully we are chapter two verse six the husband man that labor it must be first partaker of the fruits listen to that in another translation it is the hard-working farmer who ought to have the first share of the crops people want to reap what they are plant people want to enjoy what they work for so paul has given timothy seeds of life so he could operate to say to me and his blessing could come and say to it if you live in by this you wouldn't look at nobody else thinking you will decide as a hard-working farmer if you want the first share of the crops become a hard-working farmer in your farm hallelujah listen to verse 7 consider what i say and the lord give the understanding in all things so paul is not just seeing it as words he wants that word consider listen to that in translation think over what i see for the lord will give you understanding and everything so i've given you homework tonight think over what i say for the lord will give you understanding in everything this is food think over even right now we're going through too fast getting slow along with some of these things the news people spent hours watching the kung fu election you know how much more valuable this is at the end of the day win jump high low wherever that don't matter you still have to farm your lana you still have to do your work you still have to be disciplined you have to create your own economy you don't need anybody to create your economy you have to bring your heavenly economy down here you have to tap into the resources of your father who has a cattle and a thousand hills if you're in the right channel you don't need a bank loan if in the right channel you don't need help even your right channel your blessing will come until you until and there's my cop run it over because when god bless you he gave you for you and yours it happened as an abrahamic principle lot issue was because of abraham's blessing can the church say i mean anybody with me tonight a little encouragement we're not preaching we're just talking have another conversation all the scriptures tonight right so after all of that these are principles so people sit in a message without discipline we see we read the scripture where paul said to timothy i'm saying these things to you because i want you to know how to behave yourself in church we read it so people want to hold on to quote and fight doctrine and have no behavior have no discipline don't want to work don't want to execute by the rules don't want to display mastery don't want to have discipline and go away and paul after saying that slow timothy down and say think oh it over so don't just read this alone it's not just words and i said it before when god spoke to joshua he didn't say read the word there night to them that's not the instruction it is meditate meditate and reading is two different words reading is one thing you know what they say cow does eat and then let's bring back the current truth so that meditation is you now going back over again you're driving in a car and you're thinking about it am i living by the right rules because i want to win the crown i'm a military officer why am i engaging in civilian activities i'm a soldier in the army of the lord why allow any devil to come into my house because now your house become your domain to protect because you're a soldier i know you're seeing things for what it is you see the enemy where he's at that's why he biblically we are not ignorant of satan devices because we understand it's warfare we understand it's warfare we understand it's not flesh and blood but it's principalities and powers trying to take us away from our spiritual destiny in christ reveal to us through his prophet everybody with me tonight verse 8 2 verse 8. i'm going to try to close off i think this time uh uh uh lord we're really happy because this is part one lord willing next week lord willing if we pass solos and and i give thee bible study it will be it will be part two we'll continue lessons from timothy part two remember that jesus christ of the seed of david was raised from the dead according to my gospel i love that that is according to my bible i don't know why bible you read it but according to my gospel i don't know what that's what anybody else have but according to my gospel jesus christ of the seed of david was raised from the dead wherein i suffered trouble look at him as an evil doer so you say here i am i suffer in trouble as an evil doer i ain't do no evil but he are locked up in prison what do we have to complain about you lock up who lock you up wherefor wherein i suffer trouble as an evildoer even under bonds listen to it in another challenge remember jesus has raised from the dead the offering has preached in my gospel for which i am suffering born with chains as a criminal but the word of god is not bound hallelujah wherein i suffer trouble as an evildoer even under bonds but the word of god is not bound therefore therefore means after all of that therefore with that knowledge therefore with that position i endure all things for the electic that they may also obtain the salvation which is in christ jesus with eternal glory i want to challenge the parents tonight here it is paul saying i'm enduring all of this for the electic what are you willing to endure for your whole sake because the burden of the holy elect is not anywhere but there's a responsibility and a charge given to you for your house it's a real responsibility what are you willing to endure for this as for me and my house we will serve the lord the endurance of the suffering that paul had was based on an understanding that his sacrifice was for the elect even unto us god picked him for that responsibility we too have a responsibility so he reconsidered the bonds that he was in he reconsidered we call that a paradigm shift we call that reframing the situation so yes it is one way but let us relook at what it is and see a deeper cause so to speak some of us in our selfishness have hurt our families i have seen people made bad bad decisions and it's unfortunate because many times people don't seek counsel and they don't seek advice and the bible speaks about out of the multitude of counsel good decisions are made how will you go back in when there's so much scripture because every good principle for all i'm a reader i'm a studio everything i've studied any naturally spiritual i find it is it is clearer it is better you can't beat this scripture if you live by the bible forget it forget it your life would be so peaceful yet you will have to endure but it is clear you see things in the right context you see when you are suffering because you make bad decisions that's a whole different story you know paul's suffering was done bad decision suffering what paul had to endure is part of the character formation the cause of the christ these things but some of us are suffering because of bad choices bad decisions we sacrifice for the wrong thing and then we say well god help me know so tonight we want to reframe that in paul's part in words he is making sure that timothy sees things the right way can we church say amen a few moments we're going to close i'm going to try to wrap up right here therefore i endure all things for the electic that they may also obtain the salvation which is in christ jesus with eternal glory it is a faithful saying for if we be dead with him we shall also live with him if we suffer we shall also reign with him if we deny him he also will deny us have you been denying him how do we deny him it's in his simple things you know i preach a message about and my people shall never be achieved to deny him is to deny his will to deny him is to deny his love to deny him as to deny his purpose to deny him as to deny his teachings to deny him as to deny his laws and when you actually walk by your own decision you are denying him because even jesus had to bring himself under subjection and say not my will i don't want to deny you come on now i don't want to deny your will because his will was so jesus himself was living by the same principle we cannot live by our will we cannot live by our purpose we cannot live by our plan paul is guiding timothy simple but deep if we believe not yet he abided faithful he cannot deny himself of all these things of these things put them in remembrance charging them before the lord that they strive not about words to no prophet but to the subverting to the hearers can the church see 923 15 one of my token scriptures and years ago this was said to me and i i held these words on to this day study to show thyself approved unto god a workman that needeth not to be ashamed rightly dividing the word of truth in another translation do your best to present yourself to god as one approved study to show yourself approved unto god i'll close out with this and i trust this is a blessing to you i was sharing in a meeting i was in you know there are many people they aspire different career paths you know and a lot of people they say well i want to be a doctor i want to be a lawyer i want to be a pilot and these are some professions that come with typically high compensation doctors lawyers pilots and it's very interesting because you cannot be any one of these three professions without study you don't become a pilot i'm trying as a young person people just jump in their father car and it is not that simple you can't be a doctor a feeling cottage a feeling to recommend something you can't be a lawyer and just go to court and and and they don't understand the law and yeah read nothing and you just there like years ago i don't know who might remember there was a brother god bless his heart from the messenger i'm not sure what his status is right now but he had a court case and at some point they asked me what he had anything to say and he said he was at the priest say lord god you know you are the only true judge of course you judging your courtroom just put on his glasses and look at him you don't be a lawyer by accident to become a lawyer to become a doctor to become a pilot it takes a lot of years of study but beyond that one of the reasons these three professions are so highly compensated is not just the study but is the cost of failure and the commensurate benefit of success so when a pilot makes a mistake you know what happened right the plane crash people die the cost is extremely high so you don't want somebody say well i'll be participating i almost listen i didn't feel half the pilot testing or others i just gave something out of his line is that 50 50. is it 50 i'm not sure it depends on how feeling you don't want to be in that plane if you enter a doctor's room and i say well i still study i don't know i have finished that part but i will try a thing you want somebody who is trusted who is tribe who not only has the study but also there's a level of experience with it so i want to bring this study forward that as a christian as a believer as a soldier even in the army you know that's johnny army and and what people joining me and you're gonna shoot yourself in your foot you don't know how to load the gun you know what they're cleaning on how much mishaps happen when people trying to clean the gun and they don't know how to clean the gun right you to reach out there to fight the enemy yet you tire but you can't put back the gun together without training you will not be able to fight the battle and one of the challenges this is one of the reasons we have such a burden to do the bible study and to slow down and make sure we catch everybody at the get rid of the quotes and get into the scripture and stuff because people have become so casual and so lazy and because it would appear that the cost of failure is not punitive that nobody checking your paper nobody coming on market people there's a reason why in school they have exams if there was no exam you know people would leave school without nothing right but some people it's only because the exam come in and then they end up cramming they stay up all night and they think think thing and they write it because the exam system was meant to bring a level of accountability that you have been proven that you have been approved approved study teachers have approved that approval process approved in word approved in character approved in life so that whatever situation that you have to face with you cannot pull from your toolkit you don't ever use all the tools but you can pull from the toolkit because you you know how to handle it so a lawyer don't remember everything you know but because they have went through a certain process they could know how to pull from the shelf certain things how to connect certain things you will not remember every scripture you will not remember every quote it is it it may be humanly impossible but after you go to the training you know i know paul let me check back what he said to timothy because timothy was there when he wrote to the thessalonians timothy was there when he wrote any colossians timothy was there and and and here it is here it is now we have to advise somebody who was giving advice and how we treat with him their lessons and lessons and lessons in there that we could have wisdom with how to deal with our family or deal with our co-workers you see how paul handled timothy he didn't have to have him circumcised but you know what brother brandon said keep these shots all for you so he operated a certain way so that timothy will have a hard time and god know what he's doing have jew have gentile so i pray that is a blessing to you tonight and that you will look at our precious brother timothy another way a deeper way and see that this young man that god would use that whether you're young tonight you could be used and if you are more mature it means we have less excuses and i want to encourage you read it study it first timothy has six chapters second timothy has four chapters ten chapters in total that is your homework study it read it and by the grace of god um we'll be able to do some more in there let us bow our heads a word of prayer our grace just heavenly father we thank you tonight for these few words just to encourage your people to challenge your people to show your people through the scripture by your help lord how you have been tying things so beautifully together that you have given unto us as peter would say all things pertaining to life and godliness that all the tools we could need for life and godliness is in your word and you want us to be soldiers representatives of a higher kingdom representative of the one who enlisted us that we could walk a certain way talk and certainly live above the the struggles and the stresses of this life and endure the hardship that would come because we are in a warfare and in a warfare there would be hardship there will be attacks there'll be skirmishes there'll be guerrilla attacks as the enemy tries to distract us but tonight we come to refocus as it will and to meditate on your word not just read it but spend a little time looking at it turning it over having a conversation about it to see perhaps what we have not seen before to ask about it what we have not asked before so that we can leave refresh energized inspired motivated to keep on fighting motivated despite the struggles to keep focus on the prize and we could say like paul wood in this very in this very second timothy i have fought a good fight i have finished my course i've kept the faith on a huge portion a reward a heaven a crown is waiting for me so father may you be with your people may you strengthen the people may you bring us back at the appointed time and may you help us to grow from strength and strength we commit your church any people into your hands in the precious name of jesus christ amen and amen and amen may the lord bless you tonight service continues tomorrow night uh at 8 00 pm uh beyond a great expectation try your very best to make it out and if for some reason you can't you can catch a live stream make it a discipline this should be something you'll have to be reminded about because you're soldier and soldiers keep track of these things you want to know where your food coming from you want to know where your ammunition coming from is a time to recharge your batteries and then friday night lord willing we have prayer meeting uh be at your post of duty uh at our premiering virtual promising this coming friday and then sunday lord willing be in a great experience for god to continue to to bless us to guide us to strengthen us
