[25:16] you to this evening uh from our Prophet
[25:19] William Branham the message is the
[25:21] believer's position in Christ amen from
[25:25] 1955 amen so as you put that message on
[25:28] me
[25:28] you just enter into it this evening just
[25:31] draw from it and say Amen to the word
[25:34] because it's the word amen amen and and
[25:36] I believe God will have a blessing for
[25:38] us this evening as we enter in amen so
[25:41] God bless you as he put it on
[25:49] amenu now how many like Sunday school I
[25:53] believe we all do I just love Sunday
[25:55] school so we'll have a few moments of
[25:57] Sunday School I'll take my watch off
[25:59] here so I won't go too long and let's
[26:02] turn over now in the New Testament and
[26:06] the book of Ephesians for just a few
[26:09] words of exhortation for our lord Jesus
[26:14] and we give him praise for his word
[26:17] faith cometh by hearing hearing of the
[26:20] word of God God in his great marvelous
[26:24] promises they're just as unfailing more
[26:29] more to be so than heavens and earth is
[26:32] itself for heavens and earth will pass
[26:36] away but God's word will never fail it
[26:40] has to be the main thing is if we can
[26:44] find uh where God's word belongs in our
[26:48] life God sets times and time limits and
[26:52] then it works all to that time many of
[26:56] them before the coming of the Lord Jesus
[26:58] there was many false things raised up
[27:01] and said this is the Messiah and this is
[27:05] many false things taking place according
[27:07] to the scriptures just before the coming
[27:09] of the Lord Jesus and um people tried to
[27:13] do it within themselves they tried to
[27:15] make God's word fit in their program but
[27:19] you've got it Vice diversity you've got
[27:21] to fit in God's program that we find
[27:25] that that's true now
[27:28] in the Moses when he was here knowing
[27:32] that God had made a promise that he was
[27:34] going to deliver the children of Israel
[27:37] well Moses knowing that he was called
[27:39] for that purpose now when you have a
[27:42] call from God that doesn't altogether
[27:44] mean that you just jump right out and
[27:46] you're doing the will of God you have to
[27:48] find the will of God and the time of God
[27:51] to do it Moses thought well the children
[27:53] of Israel understand now that I am to be
[27:55] their deliverer so he starts out to do
[27:58] do so and he killed a man and he found
[28:01] out that the children of Israel did not
[28:04] understand then Moses lost all the hopes
[28:08] and all the the power that he had
[28:12] thinking that freedom wasn't for the
[28:15] children of Israel he lost all the
[28:17] thoughts of Freedom till God met him one
[28:20] day in a burning
[28:21] bush and then when God's season came
[28:25] along just exactly then he he he
[28:29] revealed his plan to Moses now the
[28:34] reason that Moses had forgot about
[28:36] Freedom God's promise that he would free
[28:38] them but God hadn't forgot his promise
[28:41] Moses tried in himself and
[28:44] failed that's what the church has done
[28:46] many times we've tried in ourselves to
[28:49] do things when we fail to find God's
[28:52] element of time God's got a time for all
[28:56] things that's right he's got a time that
[28:58] he has we plant cor we got a time that
[29:01] we plow corn then a time we harvest corn
[29:05] the spring rains come the drought
[29:08] through the summer the fall rains the
[29:10] Snows you just can't say I plant my
[29:13] wheat today and tomorrow go out and
[29:15] harvesting God has times for Seasons he
[29:18] has seasons for his word he has times
[29:22] one the in the scripture here where it
[29:23] said and the presence of the Lord was
[29:26] there to heal the sick
[29:28] that's when Jesus was ministering too at
[29:31] the presence of the Lord was there to
[29:33] heal the sick maybe at other times the
[29:35] presence of the Lord wasn't there to
[29:36] heal the sick and we find out that God
[29:39] works everything seasonally and now when
[29:42] Moses what he
[29:44] failed to find was the the time limit of
[29:48] God then when God revealed himself to
[29:51] him in the burning bush he found out
[29:54] then that the very thing that was in the
[29:56] burning bush was the thing that he
[29:59] lacked and I think that's a whole lot
[30:02] with us today that many times we try to
[30:05] do the program ourselves and failed to
[30:08] get what was in the burning bush the
[30:10] direct revelation of the will and time
[30:14] of
[30:15] God what good would it do you plant some
[30:18] corn out here today it would rock me
[30:21] nothing happened if it didn't Sprout the
[30:23] cold weather would kill a germ it
[30:26] wouldn't work we got to have the season
[30:28] for so then when Moses found out now the
[30:32] real direct will of God and the time of
[30:36] God and the revelation of everything to
[30:39] do now try to keep him out of Egypt
[30:41] right back to Egypt he went just as hard
[30:43] as he could go for he knew that God had
[30:46] promised deliverance and the time had
[30:48] come for deliverance for it was directly
[30:51] now Moses was looking first at the word
[30:54] the word of God had promised them
[30:57] Deliverance he knew the time was n now
[31:00] he had to have a direct contact with God
[31:02] to know how and when to do it now we as
[31:07] as Full Gospel people I think have made
[31:09] many mistakes but looking into the word
[31:11] and say God said this and we failed to
[31:14] find the direct revelation of our life
[31:16] to fit in that program when we find that
[31:20] then it's got to happen and I think
[31:22] there's where it has been failed many
[31:24] times people go out and see it an
[31:26] evangelist like for instance our brother
[31:29] Billy
[31:30] Graham what good would it do for me to
[31:32] try to be like Billy Graham I couldn't
[31:34] do it if I had to I've got a Ministry
[31:36] that I've got to take care of and the
[31:38] next man's got his ministry and each one
[31:40] has got a Ministry even to the housewife
[31:43] has a
[31:44] Ministry uh a ministering the word of
[31:47] God now if I tried to impersonate Mr
[31:49] gmam I find myself in trouble right
[31:52] quick because he's smart screw educated
[31:55] a real preacher well I'm not
[31:58] well maybe if Mr Grim tried to find
[32:00] himself impersonating me he'd be in
[32:01] trouble too so there he are so we can't
[32:05] do that we have got to do what God has
[32:09] revealed to us to do brother Grim is
[32:12] doing that God has revealed to him a
[32:14] worldwide Revival and he's making a good
[32:16] show of it too and I appreciate him and
[32:19] I'm trying my best by the Revelation
[32:21] that God has given me to minister to the
[32:23] sick people to what he told me to do now
[32:27] if we can find our positions and know
[32:29] that it's God's word that is promised it
[32:32] that's the reason Joshua and Caleb had
[32:34] no fear that they could not take the the
[32:39] promised land because all the rest of
[32:41] the nine came back of the 10 and said we
[32:44] can't do it while those cities walled
[32:47] high and we look like grasshoppers
[32:49] upside the people they're so big and
[32:51] they're armed and said we just can't do
[32:53] it see they were looking at the sense of
[32:56] reasoning
[32:58] you can't look at the sense of reasoning
[32:59] you got to look at the promise of God
[33:03] yes now God had already sent his Angel
[33:06] and the angel was in the camp moving on
[33:09] and the revelation of God had brought
[33:11] the word of God manifested and now they
[33:13] was ready to push into the promised land
[33:15] therefore Joshua and Caleb had all
[33:19] all promises was to them for God had
[33:22] promised he was going to give them the
[33:24] land and then they waited all this time
[33:27] and then after while the Holy Ghost came
[33:28] down to Moses a pillar of fire farmed
[33:31] over him and they it followed it and
[33:33] here it was right up here at the
[33:34] promised land now ready to push over so
[33:38] he could believe it because God's
[33:41] promises is
[33:42] unfailing they are the truth how do you
[33:46] think it's been friends through these
[33:48] years of meeting opposition around the
[33:51] world in the many different 20 some odd
[33:53] different nations that the Lord has sent
[33:55] me into to visit and there was critics
[33:58] and opposition and demons and scientists
[34:01] trying to disprove it and sort it into
[34:04] every trial that could be tried um by
[34:07] the grace of God I have never seen one
[34:10] time that I feared a moment why because
[34:13] God has promised he would do it see and
[34:17] I believe him and so in opposition comes
[34:20] why it's not me to take care of it it's
[34:21] him to take care of it it's just me to
[34:23] go wherever he says go that's right
[34:26] he'll take care of the opposition
[34:27] position now for a few moments to find
[34:30] out positionally what we are in Christ
[34:33] Jesus and I think if the church now can
[34:36] find out what they are and how to enter
[34:40] and what to do after the enter why it'll
[34:42] be a glorious thing when we learn these
[34:44] things don't you think
[34:45] so now in the book of Ephesians I want
[34:48] to read Paul's letter just a portion of
[34:51] it don't know how far we're going
[34:52] because I'm timing myself but this watch
[34:55] here Paul an apostle
[34:58] of Jesus Christ by the will of God the
[35:03] Apostle uh word Apostle means one that's
[35:07] sent I've often wondered why the
[35:09] missionary ever wanted to be called a
[35:12] missionary a missionary is an
[35:15] apostle the word a missionary means one
[35:17] sent Apostle means one sent a missionary
[35:21] is an apostle when people says there is
[35:24] no more Apostles in that same church
[35:25] than missionaries and say there is no
[35:27] apost OST I don't get it but Apostle is
[35:31] one that sent so is the missionary is
[35:34] one that is sent sent by God and Paul
[35:38] not by desire not by choice not by the
[35:42] will of man or his own humanly desires
[35:45] but by the will of God he was an
[35:50] apostle we need some more that's right
[35:54] like that by the will of God he was on
[35:57] his Ro to Damascus to arrest think of it
[36:02] was going to arrest the very group that
[36:05] he was sent to be an
[36:07] apostle now you can see how upside down
[36:10] looks like in the human elements that
[36:13] God does things just the very things
[36:15] that you think that you want do that may
[36:18] be the very things you have to
[36:20] do when I first seen the Full Gospel
[36:23] people and I've seen a girl one night
[36:25] get up on the floor when the music was
[36:27] plan begin dancing up and down the floor
[36:30] I never danced in my life wasn't on a
[36:32] dance floor and didn't believe nothing
[36:33] in dancing well selfishness here not out
[36:38] loud but in my heart I criticize the
[36:40] girl I said there's nothing about God
[36:43] about that just the young Baptist
[36:45] preacher sitting there and I said there
[36:46] can't be nothing to that that woman out
[36:49] on the floor she's only just making a a
[36:51] show she has want somebody to see her I
[36:53] wouldn't say it out loud for nothing but
[36:55] in my heart I was thinking it some said
[36:57] what' you think of the meeting I said
[36:59] it's fine but in my heart I I didn't
[37:03] believe in that so you know one New
[37:05] Year's night I was sitting in my own
[37:07] Tabernacle and they started playing this
[37:10] song there's going to be a meeting in
[37:11] the A and you know what happened i' done
[37:13] the same
[37:14] thing he was so just the things that you
[37:18] said you want do you may have to do it
[37:21] some sometimes so I guess Paul said he'd
[37:24] never get down and get in the dust like
[37:27] some of those other people and yell and
[37:29] scream and carry on like they were doing
[37:31] but God showed him he had to do it so
[37:34] just sometimes when you say you want do
[37:36] anything just to be careful God may make
[37:38] you do it right all right he was an
[37:41] apostle then by the will of God he had
[37:46] no willing into it is God did it made
[37:49] him an apostle of the Lord Jesus Christ
[37:53] by the will of God to the Saints watch
[37:56] this is not addressed now to Sinners
[37:58] unbelievers this is addressed to Saints
[38:02] our Sanctified ones the right what the
[38:07] word sanctify mean means a clean and set
[38:10] aside for service the Old Testament is a
[38:13] compound word don't only mean clean but
[38:16] it means set aside for service it's be
[38:19] cleaned and set aside for service the
[38:21] altar Sanctified The Vessel and is set
[38:24] it aside for service to the Saints which
[38:28] are Ephesus and to the faithful in Jesus
[38:33] Christ see who he's addressing this far
[38:35] let me read it quietly now listen Paul
[38:39] an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will
[38:41] of God to the Saints which are at
[38:45] Ephesus and to the faithful in Christ
[38:49] Jesus that's right to the faithful in
[38:54] Christ Jesus
[38:58] now this letter is addressed to those
[39:02] not to the outside world not to it's not
[39:04] a sermon Paul wasn't preaching here to
[39:07] the unsaved he was preaching it to the
[39:11] saved the called out the separated the
[39:16] set aside and the faithful in the
[39:20] call now that's who he's addressing to
[39:23] in Jesus the believer's position is is
[39:27] in
[39:28] Christ and Christ will only meet the
[39:33] believer the believer can only worship
[39:36] Christ as he is positionally placed in
[39:43] Christ I don't believe you get it let me
[39:46] go another route look a Believer cannot
[39:52] worship and has no right to worship no
[39:55] man has no right to to Worship the Lord
[39:59] outside of being in the body of the Lord
[40:02] Jesus
[40:03] Christ did you know that if we had time
[40:07] to go back and pick up the laws on that
[40:09] it would be beautifully he's who is
[40:11] addressed it to the believer in Christ
[40:14] last evening I was speaking of the the
[40:16] blood how that God came into the womb of
[40:21] the Virgin and the creator making
[40:24] himself a blood cell and from sell begin
[40:27] to press the on cell and through that
[40:30] breaking of the blood
[40:32] cell sprayed broke the case between a RI
[40:36] the veil rather in two that chased him
[40:38] off and now can bring the believer into
[40:41] fellowship with him only through the
[40:46] blood they have no right to worship who
[40:50] has not come through the
[40:52] blood right look at the Old Testament
[40:55] back there when the believers they had a
[40:59] tabernacle and in the Tabernacle no man
[41:02] had a right to do worship unless he came
[41:05] to the
[41:07] Tabernacle it was the place where the
[41:09] blood was offered without the shedding
[41:12] of blood there's no remission of sin no
[41:14] promise of prayer being answered outside
[41:17] the blood but the children of Israel
[41:19] come to the temple a place that was
[41:23] designated by God for all believers
[41:28] to gather together in one
[41:32] Fellowship see it yes they were all
[41:36] together every tribe yes the Pharisees
[41:40] the Sadducees the herodians publicans
[41:43] all together gathered in one place of
[41:48] Fellowship how beautiful yes C there why
[41:54] the lamb was killed the blood was put up
[41:58] on the brazing Altar and the bodies
[42:00] burnt and the smoke went
[42:03] up and all under that smoke which was a
[42:08] sweet smelling savior into his nostrils
[42:10] as it left the place all under the blood
[42:13] had a right to worship what did he speak
[42:16] of the Lord Jesus Christ for God then
[42:21] came to his temple in a pillar of
[42:25] fire when the temp
[42:27] was
[42:29] made of worship place for all of Israel
[42:33] to come together the pillar of fire came
[42:37] in over the great 70ft wings of the
[42:40] angels went back over long the Angels On
[42:44] The Wall went back to The Mercy Seat
[42:47] where two great 14t brass turbans set
[42:50] with their wings pitched to one another
[42:53] and
[42:55] settled God
[42:58] coming to his
[43:01] Temple Hallelujah to be worshiped from
[43:04] that Temple where the blood outside made
[43:07] an
[43:09] atonement then when Christ came on the
[43:13] earth when he was baptized in Jordan as
[43:16] the washing of the lamb at the Brazen
[43:19] lever
[43:21] notice then John bear record seeing the
[43:26] spirit of God like a of coming from
[43:29] above and it settled on him and went
[43:32] into
[43:34] him God coming to his
[43:38] Temple God was in Christ reconciling the
[43:41] world to
[43:43] himself that was his Temple then that
[43:46] body for sin our sins was tore apart his
[43:52] flesh ripped into two the blood vessels
[43:55] was broken
[43:57] and there now as the Spirit come from
[44:01] his body then all
[44:04] believers hope you see it yes look all
[44:09] believers that come to the blood into
[44:14] the body of Jesus
[44:15] Christ worship God to the shed blood of
[44:19] Jesus Christ in one they are
[44:22] positionally placed in
[44:24] Christ praise the Lord you see it
[44:28] to them that are in
[44:31] Christ faithful called
[44:36] chosen in
[44:38] Christ that's who Paul's addressing this
[44:41] letter to aren't you happy today you're
[44:43] in Christ how do we get in wish we had
[44:48] time for it about six more minutes look
[44:50] how do we get into Christ by one Spirit
[44:56] yes
[44:58] not even one
[44:59] Fellowship no not the first thing comes
[45:05] first by one Church no by one letter no
[45:11] by one Creed no but by one spirit amen
[45:17] we are all baptized into one body not by
[45:23] water not by power not by might
[45:28] but by my spirit sayth the
[45:32] Lord one Spirit we're baptized what by
[45:38] the spirit where does the spirit say
[45:40] where is life in the blood coming
[45:43] through the the blood of Christ first
[45:48] becoming a Believer outside of Christ
[45:51] without god without hope in the world
[45:54] condemned to die then God by
[46:00] Grace elects us calls us to Christ we
[46:04] hear him inside the blood cell calling
[46:07] to us
[46:10] life you get it Hallelujah and we come
[46:14] then confess our sins and are
[46:17] baptized for the remission of our sins
[46:19] then taken through the
[46:22] blood till the blood cell we come
[46:25] through the spray of blood then and by
[46:27] the Holy
[46:29] Spirit are baptized
[46:33] inside this blood cell and we have
[46:37] Fellowship one with another while the
[46:39] blood of Jesus Christ the son of God
[46:41] cleans us from all un rightous oh my
[46:45] there you are Hallelujah that's what we
[46:47] need positionally come first to Christ
[46:52] through the blood the shed blood then
[46:55] positionally we're
[46:57] seated in
[46:59] Christ notice this now the next
[47:03] verse first before we leave it notice
[47:07] all the Old Testament a shadow of the
[47:10] new no believer had a right to offer
[47:13] sacrifice and worship outside the temple
[47:17] in the temples where the blood was God
[47:19] forbid it he said don't do it come to
[47:23] the temple to Fellowship
[47:26] we have no right to go outside and start
[47:30] Creeds and denominations break people
[47:32] and separate them we're supposed to come
[47:35] into one glorious
[47:38] Fellowship by the washing of the Water
[47:41] by the
[47:43] word into the body of Christ through the
[47:46] blood and we become Blood Bought
[47:49] children of
[47:51] God then I have no right to say because
[47:54] you're a Methodist you're not my brother

[48:19] Jesus Heavenly places Heavenly places
[48:24] when you're outside of Christ you don't
[48:27] understand the Heavenly place when
[48:29] you're out there you look and say oh
[48:30] that bunch of Fanatics they don't know
[48:32] what they're speaking about the reason
[48:35] you don't know because you've never been
[48:36] a
[48:37] partaker of the fellowship that's right
[48:40] of his
[48:42] suffering you have never laid your hands
[48:44] upon his blessed sacred head and felt
[48:48] the Pains of Calvary for your sin you
[48:52] never know what that
[48:54] was fell a friend you don't know what it
[48:57] means till you once climb the calvary

[49:41] no right to say that the people in the
[49:44] fellowship that believes in the
[49:46] Supernatural are all mentally upset

[50:16] Heavenly places in Christ Jesus what God
[50:20] can do how the revelation of God can
[50:22] move through an audience like that when
[50:24] we've all been partakers of this same
[50:26] Fellowship yeah see and now that's who
[50:28] Paul's addressing this letter
[50:31] to and just a moment or two longer Paul

[52:54] Christ now
[52:57] quickly now I'll give you my view and
[52:59] then we'll have to go according as he
[53:03] has as
[53:06] he God has chosen
[53:11] us not my desire not your desire wasn't
[53:15] Paul's
[53:17] desire but he has chosen Us in
[53:22] him before the foundation of the world
[53:28] did you think of that he chose us in him
[53:32] before the foundation of the world that
[53:36] we that we should be
[53:41] holy not because I lived right because
[53:45] he chose me to be that
[53:47] way he done it not I that's the reason
[53:51] you're holy this afternoon not because
[53:53] you deserve it but because he chose you
[53:56] to be that way when before the
[53:59] foundation of the
[54:00] world holy and Without
[54:05] Blame before him in love how could we do
[54:09] it there had to be a masterpiece through
[54:11] that and that was Christ Jesus
[54:15] listen you don't remember neither do I
[54:20] but we was before the foundation of the
[54:23] world when God made man said let us make
[54:27] man in our own image let us give them
[54:34] plural let us make man in our own image
[54:37] Spirit man and give them dominion over
[54:41] the feces of the Sea and the cattles and
[54:43] so forth Genesis
[54:45] 1 God saying that let us make man now
[54:50] back there before the foundation of the
[54:53] world God chose you you in Christ Jesus
[54:59] to appear holy at the end time all the
[55:02] way from the foundation of the
[55:04] world You See It Now quickly let's C to
[55:09] the next
[55:10] verse having predestinated or elected us
[55:15] unto the adoption of children by Christ
[55:18] Jesus to himself according to the to the
[55:22] good pleasure of his
[55:25] Will May I speak to you just a moment
[55:29] God before the world
[55:31] began notice no one said Jesus can come
[55:37] to me except my father draws
[55:40] him that's Jesus own word here's the
[55:43] blood cell here it is broken here's the
[55:45] spray of blood moving now here's Christ
[55:49] inside this blood cell Christ means the
[55:52] anointed it was the anointed blood cell
[55:55] here it is here here's God our Father
[55:58] look at what he's doing no man can come
[56:01] through this Blood spray to me except my
[56:05] father draws
[56:07] him and all that comes I'll give him
[56:10] everlasting life no wies turn him out
[56:14] and will raise him up at the last
[56:17] days you see what it is now look he has
[56:21] chosen us for this purpose having
[56:24] predestinated our for for knowledge he
[56:27] for understood what it would be from the
[56:29] beginning God in the beginning knowing
[56:32] just what he would do at the end he
[56:35] predestinated or could
[56:38] foretell what it would be for knowledge
[56:41] for knowing to be in Christ Jesus notice
[56:45] having predestined us
[56:46] [Music]
[56:48] unto the adoption of
[56:51] children the
[56:53] adoption now we'll take the old laws
[56:55] just a moment AG again then we'll have
[56:57] to
[56:58] close in the Old Testament when a
[57:02] man or enjoin the reading of the word I
[57:06] just love it just bear a few minutes
[57:09] longer in the Old Testament when a man
[57:12] had his little
[57:16] kingdom uh he was the father of this
[57:19] Kingdom a little possession in St John
[57:22] is even carried down in the Anglo-Saxon
[57:25] people in Britain years years ago even
[57:27] the King James translation or version
[57:30] you find said St John 14 said in my
[57:32] father's house is many mentions that
[57:36] sounds strange in a house being
[57:37] mentioned but what it is in the time of
[57:41] the of the King James version It's a
[57:45] translation every man that had a kingdom
[57:48] a king he had this domain was his and he
[57:52] was called the father and this was
[57:54] called his household
[57:57] the children all the all his um subjects
[58:01] was his his over he was domain his
[58:04] domain was over them and that was called
[58:06] his house so they said in my father's
[58:10] now I believe mof puts it in my father's
[58:12] apartment house as many apartments I I
[58:15] disagree with that but in the original
[58:19] it said in my father's kingdom is many
[58:22] palaces that sounds better doesn't it
[58:25] that's right now when a man in the Old
[58:28] Testament a Jewish man in Palestine
[58:31] whether he was the uh whatever he was
[58:34] the tribe of Joseph or Ephraim or
[58:37] whatever it was he had his own lotted
[58:40] grounds that belonged to him the
[58:42] beautiful story of of Ruth when
[58:45] returning with neom when neoma had lost
[58:47] all of her inheritance and Boaz brought
[58:49] it back I believe I preached on that the
[58:51] last time was here a beautiful picture
[58:53] that was his little domain
[58:57] his little kingdom like his
[58:59] possession it was handed down one
[59:03] succeeded the other now when a father
[59:06] married and he this boy inherited what
[59:09] his father had his children was born now
[59:13] when that boy was born into this little
[59:16] uh we call it little acreage or little
[59:18] farm when he was born there the father
[59:21] had servants all around but the child
[59:25] was RA raised under a tutor teacher
[59:30] instructor Galatians the 4th chapter for
[59:33] 1 to 5 verses gives a beautiful picture
[59:35] of it how that we were under the tutor
[59:37] so long but now when this child was born
[59:41] he became a son the very moment he was
[59:45] borned in the
[59:47] family you get it now then there was a
[59:52] tutor over this boy to educate him and
[59:54] to raise him up
[59:57] well he was no more than a servant said
[59:59] the galatian letter until he came to the
[1:00:02] a age a certain limited time that was
[1:00:05] set and this tutor would always take the
[1:00:08] father word your son is progressing
[1:00:10] right or whatever it was and now that's
[1:00:15] where I I'm not disagreeing my dear
[1:00:18] Brethren but here take it as from one
[1:00:21] who loves you there's where Pentecost
[1:00:25] failed see this that's right see right
[1:00:30] if the Holy Spirit may be not willing to
[1:00:32] give it then look when you were borned
[1:00:35] again of the Holy Ghost you said this is
[1:00:37] it brother it was you was a
[1:00:41] childen you were just as much child as
[1:00:44] you ever could be you were born in the
[1:00:46] family but yet the tutor which is the
[1:00:50] holy spirit has watched over the church
[1:00:54] as it's been maturing
[1:00:57] now if this tutor in the natural went to
[1:01:01] the father and said now here that boy is
[1:01:04] not going to be very good I try to teach
[1:01:07] him he he just won't listen he's got his
[1:01:10] own headstrong way and he just won't
[1:01:12] listen he's going to be this or he's
[1:01:14] going to be that the father realizes
[1:01:17] right then that that boy cannot take
[1:01:20] over his domain that's right that's
[1:01:22] right because what would he do he' run
[1:01:24] it to the return the prodical son gives
[1:01:27] a very beautiful picture of it right see
[1:01:30] he could not what he would do would be
[1:01:32] mortgage a farmer sell it off and drink
[1:01:34] it up and run it
[1:01:35] around now in the spiritual sense after
[1:01:39] we were born into Christ we become
[1:01:42] children of God but then see God knows
[1:01:48] best yeah now here's where I say
[1:01:51] irreverently disagree with my line
[1:01:54] Brethren you think I'm persecuting
[1:01:56] Church no my dear brother no see now
[1:02:01] this boy after he got a certain age he
[1:02:05] had to be adopted into that same family
[1:02:09] he was born into any Minister knows
[1:02:12] that's a placing of a
[1:02:14] son he had to be adopted into the family
[1:02:17] that he was borned
[1:02:19] into could you imagine that but that's
[1:02:22] the Old Testament teaching and Paul's
[1:02:24] referring to it you're
[1:02:26] Ephesians the Church of Ephesus now the
[1:02:31] thing of it is brethren we have tried to
[1:02:33] make each one here and each one this and
[1:02:35] each one that by laying on of hands and
[1:02:38] separating or setting apart but God has
[1:02:40] to do
[1:02:41] that the only one can do
[1:02:44] it now when the father became aware that
[1:02:49] this boy was not worthy he never
[1:02:52] disowned him he was still his boy but he
[1:02:55] couldn't put conf confidence in him
[1:02:56] that's right he was too cared about with
[1:02:59] all kinds of Winds of doctor that's what
[1:03:01] the scripture says be not cared about
[1:03:03] the every Winds of doctor be
[1:03:05] stabled always abounding in the works of
[1:03:08] the Lord far as so much as you know your
[1:03:09] works is not in vain quickly wish we
[1:03:12] could stay on that a while but notice
[1:03:14] this father then the day come when this
[1:03:17] boy maybe had been all right and was a
[1:03:19] worthy man he listened to the father he
[1:03:22] took instructions he was a good boy then
[1:03:26] the father taken him out into the public
[1:03:29] Street and then he put a special clothes
[1:03:32] on him and then the father had a
[1:03:36] ceremony and
[1:03:38] adopted this his
[1:03:41] son into his
[1:03:44] family Paul's saying here having
[1:03:47] predestinated us unto the
[1:03:52] adoption see and to the adoption
[1:03:56] Moses a prefigure of it and then this
[1:03:59] son after he came out there was given no
[1:04:03] longer no longer was he just like the
[1:04:06] servant under a tutor he was the
[1:04:10] boss amen I hope this so we deep going
[1:04:14] to leave you in a minute let's get way
[1:04:18] down deep this son was no more under a
[1:04:22] tutor but he was like his father yes and
[1:04:26] his father give him certain things to do
[1:04:29] the father M told him you take care of
[1:04:31] this field over here or you do this over
[1:04:33] here you take care of the slaves you
[1:04:35] take care of whatever it was he was in
[1:04:37] full possession
[1:04:40] am
[1:04:42] amen for he was adopted into that family
[1:04:46] and his name on a check was just as good
[1:04:48] as his daddy's that's right now what God
[1:04:51] has done the reason we see these things
[1:04:54] and know that there's something wrong
[1:04:55] friend we see the promises of God we see
[1:04:58] it in the word of God but God has just
[1:05:02] beg to my humble opinion to adopting his
[1:05:05] sons yes positionally calling him out to
[1:05:09] one side giving him a certain Ministry
[1:05:11] anointing them for that purpose and
[1:05:13] sending them
[1:05:14] out watch what happens when he does
[1:05:18] everything that he give him possession
[1:05:20] over will take
[1:05:22] place God adopted his own son like that
[1:05:25] yes Jesus walking as an ordinary man but
[1:05:30] one day up on Mount
[1:05:31] Transfiguration he taken three as a
[1:05:34] witness Peter James Young hope faith and
[1:05:38] charity called him
[1:05:40] out and he separated Jesus from them and
[1:05:45] he overshadowed him and the Bible said
[1:05:49] his rment Shine Like the Sun in its
[1:05:53] strength what was it that special
[1:05:57] robe God adopting his own
[1:06:00] [Music]
[1:06:01] son and they seen Moses Elijah appear
[1:06:04] and so forth vanish away and then they
[1:06:06] seen Jesus only and when they look back
[1:06:09] then God the
[1:06:11] Father after putting the robe on his son
[1:06:15] he said this is my beloved Son hear ye
[1:06:19] him no wonder Jesus could say all the
[1:06:22] powers in Heaven and Earth is given into
[1:06:24] my hand for he was was adopted by his
