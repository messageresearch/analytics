[24:17] see what he will see unto me and what i
[24:20] shall answer when i'm reproved and the
[24:22] lord answered and answered me and said
[24:24] write the vision
[24:25] make it plain upon tables that he may
[24:27] run that readed it for the vision as yet
[24:30] for an appointed time but at the end the
[24:33] child speak and not lie
[24:35] do tarry wait for it
[24:37] because it will surely come it will not
[24:40] tarry behold his soul which is lifted up
[24:43] is not upright in him but the just shall
[24:46] live
[24:47] by his faith

[24:53] amen
[24:58] it says cast not away there for your
[25:00] confidence
[25:01] which had great recompense of reward
[25:04] for you have need of patience that after

[25:18] any man draw back my soul shall have no
[25:20] pleasure in him
[25:21] but we hallelujah and not of them who
[25:23] draw back on the peridition but of them
[25:26] that believe to the saving of the soul
[25:29] and our last scripture from romans
[25:31] chapter 8
[25:32] and reading from verse 28
[25:35] to 31
[25:36] and we know

[25:40] that all things work together for good
[25:43] to them that love god
[25:45] to them who are be called according to
[25:48] his purpose
[25:49] for whom he did for know he also did
[25:51] predestinate to be conformed to the
[25:54] image of his son that he might be the
[25:56] firstborn among many brethren moreover
[25:59] whom he did predestinate them he also
[26:01] called and whom he called them he also
[26:04] justified and whom he justified them he
[26:07] also glorified what shall we then say to
[26:10] these things if god before us who can be
[26:14] against us let's pray father we have
[26:15] read your word we feel fire on your word
[26:18] and for this little period of time may

[26:51] your spirit
[26:52] oh glory to god wearing masks and
[26:54] washing your hands that are messier

[27:18] other thing to come
[27:20] oh glory to god i'm worse than that to
[27:22] come but guess what coming also sons of
[27:25] god coming too
[27:27] oh glory to god because the bible said
[27:29] when the enemy coming like a flood like
[27:31] a flood not the
[27:33] little rain though like a flood when the
[27:35] enemy without a flood we have seen that
[27:38] yet
[27:38] when we have seen that yet but whenever
[27:41] the enemy decides to come like a flood
[27:43] the spirit got a lie the spirit god
[27:46] cannot lie the spirit will raise a
[27:48] standard against him
[27:50] oh glorious war has started here now
[27:52] this war started in 2021 this war
[27:55] started before there was a moon
[27:57] this war started in heaven
[27:59] oh glory to god michael fought and the
[28:01] dragon fought and we continue to battle
[28:04] down here
[28:05] oh give the lord our praise
[28:08] that trust should be blessed understand
[28:10] this morning
[28:11] oh glory to god you may be seated
[28:13] the title this morning is predestinated
[28:16] called
[28:17] unjustified
[28:19] predestinated called justified and we
[28:22] know who he justified he already
[28:23] glorified isn't that right
[28:25] another inspiration the revival of the
[28:27] justified
[28:29] oh glory to god the revival of the
[28:31] justified you're going to find out what
[28:33] justified is
[28:34] justified is not forgiven justified as
[28:37] if you never did it
[28:39] you want to tell me god justify me and i
[28:41] ain't going to shout i ain't going dance
[28:43] i ain't gonna have a jubilee
[28:45] oh go who you thought you he called
[28:48] all glory to god and he predestinate you
[28:50] to be in this hour
[28:51] you could have been luther's age you
[28:53] could be in wesley
[28:55] [Applause]
[28:56] [Music]
[28:58] glory to god before i had my children
[29:01] god saw my grandchildren
[29:04] [Music]
[29:06] they was already on their way before i
[29:08] even had my own children
[29:10] that's what god has predestinated
[29:12] he just see way down
[29:14] why what is the purpose of having a
[29:16] vision
[29:18] the purpose of having a vision is to
[29:21] show you something when it is not yet
[29:27] that's the purpose of a vision
[29:29] it is not yet but it will be
[29:35] so therefore our vision always have an
[29:38] appointed time
[29:39] [Applause]
[29:40] [Music]
[29:45] so if god gave you a vision of your
[29:46] healing a vision of your breakthrough a
[29:48] vision of your baptism holy ghost a
[29:50] vision of your adoption all of that is
[29:52] to tell you it's coming
[29:54] [Music]
[29:55] [Applause]
[29:56] and the just
[29:58] shall live
[30:00] by his faith
[30:02] not by your feelings
[30:04] [Music]
[30:06] because the vision could be completely
[30:08] contrary to your feelings
[30:12] you may be seated
[30:14] one time brother branham had a vision of
[30:16] killing a grizzly tip beer
[30:19] and when he's had to walk and say he's
[30:20] gonna get it somebody said look at the
[30:22] grass
[30:24] you could see for miles there's no beard
[30:26] here
[30:27] it cannot have any beard you say if god
[30:30] said
[30:32] that i go kill a brisley beer
[30:34] in this environment when they grasp all
[30:36] or god is able to make and produce and
[30:40] have a beer right there
[30:43] next minute when they look they see a
[30:45] big bear standing there figure that one
[30:47] out well i ain't figuring out nothing if
[30:50] god said there's gonna be a bright
[30:52] revival
[30:53] there's gonna be a bright revival
[30:56] if god said they're gonna be healing
[30:58] blind night will pop open going
[31:01] to walk
[31:03] so i'm going to speak
[31:05] they're going to hear it must have death
[31:07] people to bust their ears open it must
[31:10] have dumb people that god going to have
[31:13] to speak
[31:13] [Applause]
[31:15] must have blind people to see oh give
[31:18] the lord a shout i know what's coming
[31:21] oh glory to god he's a right division
[31:26] make it plain
[31:28] oh glory to god you have to see it
[31:30] you have to talk about it it's coming
[31:32] oh glory to god hallelujah hallelujah
[31:35] glory so let's go
[31:38] god help me this morning
[31:40] whoo
[31:41] [Music]
[31:45] let's talk a little bit about joseph
[31:47] story of joseph just a little tiny bit
[31:50] about joseph love of the father
[31:53] love so much that the father makes them
[31:55] a quote of many colors
[31:57] and you know
[31:58] from the humanistic realm it looked like
[32:00] we would see the father favored jesus
[32:04] you know joseph was that he spotted
[32:05] child he wasn't the foolish he wasn't
[32:07] he's second he wasn't deterred he was
[32:08] somewhere down on the road
[32:10] and the father kind of curry favors we
[32:12] would see and whatnot but when you look
[32:15] a little deeper
[32:16] you would realize
[32:18] jose's brother's spirit were off
[32:23] it was always off
[32:25] before the father made code for jesus
[32:28] before the father do what he did for
[32:29] joseph
[32:30] those brothers didn't even know how off
[32:32] they were
[32:33] it took joseph's vision and dreams
[32:37] to expose
[32:39] the spirit that was in them
[32:42] because that is what was in them
[32:45] jealousy was in them but they had
[32:47] nothing to jealous yet
[32:48] so they're just brethren because
[32:50] nobody's staring
[32:52] nobody's stepping out in perfection
[32:55] nobody's stepping out a class act all by
[32:58] themselves
[32:59] nobody step out with authenticity
[33:02] all glory to god they couldn't have
[33:04] nothing to compare themselves with
[33:06] but when joseph walked a certain way
[33:09] talk a certain way
[33:10] live a certain way in so much his father
[33:14] put a blessing upon him
[33:17] then brothers had to watch him kotai
[33:19] had i
[33:20] and i am telling you when god put his
[33:22] touch upon you
[33:24] come on now don't hold back now
[33:27] don't hold back now you're telling
[33:28] what's coming
[33:30] oh glory to god because god for you
[33:34] what's in you
[33:35] do you get where i'm going this morning
[33:38] and who is on you
[33:42] he called
[33:46] oh
[33:48] somebody was saying if you watch that
[33:50] robot don't seem that was given to jose
[33:53] it represented the holy spirit that
[33:55] covered his being and today it's the
[33:58] holy spirit that covers the church the
[34:01] robe of many colors
[34:02] so all that was just a type
[34:05] to represent the elect in this last day
[34:08] getting the robe of many colors
[34:10] favored by the father not because you're
[34:13] doing you're so nice but then brothers
[34:16] messed up
[34:18] and you will expose all the more messed
[34:20] up
[34:20] oh my hallelujah
[34:23] let's continue
[34:24] so watch
[34:26] god was eternal he had attributes and
[34:28] endear represents
[34:30] the word of god which has made flesh and
[34:33] dwell among us
[34:34] now this fellow here
[34:36] the woman of the world the priest the
[34:38] pharisee and where you see he said grace
[34:40] and salvation in the beginning was the
[34:42] word the word was made flesh and dwelt
[34:44] among us three stages it was attribute
[34:46] first in god the thought
[34:49] as him being a human and that
[34:51] transmitted him down to jesus
[34:53] watch and therefore there's only one
[34:54] form of eternal life and that's god you
[34:57] have to be part of god at the beginning
[34:59] not what you choose down here is he
[35:01] chose you
[35:03] so that's why you say all that the
[35:04] father had given me will come
[35:06] say they say ton you could do what you
[35:07] want all that the father had given me
[35:09] will come
[35:10] you could lie to them you could try to
[35:12] deceive them with all that the father
[35:14] had i'm not talking about no he gives at
[35:15] me before
[35:17] oh glory to god do you see that now
[35:19] now look at this priest here we find out
[35:22] there's a priest now
[35:24] do you remember the long tall heart
[35:26] everybody respect him this is priest now
[35:28] this man with bible and scroll this is
[35:30] priest now he often sacrificed this is
[35:32] priest we're talking about now
[35:34] but listen to this
[35:36] watch
[35:37] he said no
[35:38] uh
[35:39] all right so the priest now we find his
[35:41] bottom part here is back life behind him
[35:44] predestination back day is sinful
[35:49] so in front
[35:51] in the world with his long gong and nice
[35:53] shoes and polish shoes and well polished
[35:54] and everything else tall cap and
[35:56] everything else he is he's the priest
[35:58] everybody will come to him the
[35:59] government will call him out they want
[36:01] to hear him out his predestination is
[36:03] sinful now watch
[36:05] no no
[36:06] no no no outside represent purity he was
[36:08] a priest he was an honorable man that
[36:10] presented this right now this woman one
[36:13] of the well
[36:15] her first life she was a prostitute
[36:17] she was mad up but way down here
[36:23] i know when the messiah come when jesus
[36:26] came he manifested the torts it's the
[36:28] torch now the priest with only
[36:31] intellectual learning called jesus the
[36:33] devil
[36:36] he's in humanistic realm he's using his
[36:39] senses and his senses saying you're not
[36:41] with us you are devil
[36:44] your word i we don't believe that so
[36:46] you're off
[36:47] you're a devil
[36:48] but this woman
[36:50] when the word was interpreted to her she
[36:53] called him what i perceived that what a
[36:55] prophet isn't that right
[36:56] so watch
[36:58] the priest with only intellectual
[37:00] learning said it's the devil because
[37:02] what is the nomination called it what
[37:04] did he do he had no representation so it
[37:07] blocked him out
[37:09] since only when a manifestation comes it
[37:11] has an effect
[37:13] it light you up or block you out
[37:19] that way if i didn't come
[37:21] you know
[37:22] you claim it to be light now that i come
[37:25] you're walking in darkness because the
[37:27] light has come
[37:28] so it's only when a manifestation come
[37:30] oh glory everything begins to expose
[37:33] right there you don't know who is who
[37:35] oh glory to god hallelujah but the
[37:37] manifestation will be the interpretation
[37:40] so god going to manifest and declare you
[37:43] oh glory to god who who are we talking
[37:45] about who he for knew
[37:47] who he predestinate who he called
[37:50] and who he justified
[37:52] oh god and you're gonna get a revelation
[37:54] of your justification
[37:56] you're gonna get an experience of your
[37:57] justification
[37:59] oh glory to god because justification
[38:00] means that there is nothing against you
[38:03] oh give the lord a praise offering
[38:06] therefore you are joseph perfection
[38:09] the capstone word that's a revelation
[38:11] you know
[38:12] not jacob grace
[38:13] oh glory to god let's continue now
[38:17] so when he spoke to the woman he said
[38:18] you told the truth because you had five
[38:20] and the one you have now is not your
[38:22] husband watch something happen
[38:25] look
[38:26] life now if she hadn't had listen
[38:29] representation by predestination
[38:32] it would have never take a hole
[38:34] she had what
[38:36] representation by predestination so
[38:39] she's a wrong sinner on the earth
[38:41] everybody can see her life and a
[38:42] behavior but she had representation
[38:45] by predestination
[38:47] she herself didn't even know that
[38:50] but the light had to come to her
[38:52] to expose
[38:55] her representation
[38:57] by predestination
[38:58] she thought in life all she was was a
[39:00] stinking prostitute but when jesus come
[39:04] he come to bring light
[39:06] and when the light shine on her
[39:08] not the front part
[39:10] the back part
[39:11] that where he turned this
[39:13] where the devil didn't want the servants
[39:15] you to break you know
[39:16] it's not the front part the fun part
[39:19] you're a smoker you're a drinker you're
[39:20] a liar cheat you had this that's the
[39:22] front part but the back part which is
[39:25] the gene part which is the attribute
[39:28] part which is the part that connects you
[39:30] back to elohim
[39:31] which is the thought
[39:33] oh lord that path
[39:36] oh hallelujah
[39:38] that is what the light come to activate
[39:41] that's why i don't care what the
[39:42] children doing right now
[39:44] i look at the pipe and coke right now if
[39:46] they're smoking dope right now
[39:49] brother when that blood hung of the holy
[39:51] ghost
[39:52] be going to ride after them
[39:54] glory to god
[39:56] hallelujah hallelujah
[40:00] you may be seated
[40:01] remember one of the brothers those
[40:03] believers came to the branham time
[40:04] knockout service somebody stole imanca
[40:07] oliman family thing inside hika going to
[40:10] the prophet to tell him what he lost
[40:12] somebody stole his cat they were
[40:13] stealing kansas a lot in those times
[40:15] and the problem began to pray
[40:17] or when he began to pray he saw a vision
[40:19] he saw the man driving he saw the holy
[40:21] spirit arresting the
[40:23] the man pulling aside
[40:25] he saw how much how much how much how
[40:27] far he went how much gas in his tank
[40:30] conviction arrest man you tell me god
[40:33] can arrest your son
[40:35] lock him up
[40:36] and bring him back home
[40:39] what do you think god did to us
[40:41] we were in bondage
[40:43] and he take and deliver us
[40:46] from out of the hands of the enemy
[40:48] god went and bust the hand of satan
[40:51] break the bonds of wickedness over you
[40:54] know you have the liberty
[40:56] to express your love for god satan is a
[40:59] liar this morning
[41:01] that's why we had to worship god
[41:03] we know what we worship woman y'all are
[41:06] coming always
[41:08] come on help me preach somebody
[41:10] we're the true worshipers
[41:12] we'll worship the father
[41:14] no burying or kill me dead in this
[41:16] message
[41:17] oh glory to god hallelujah no body anger
[41:21] no man no deacon no church strike me
[41:24] with death
[41:25] [Music]
[41:27] [Applause]
[41:33] let me see
[41:34] ii peter 1 20 the bible says knowing
[41:36] this verse that no prophecies of of the
[41:39] scripture
[41:40] is of private interpretation
[41:42] for the prophecy came not in all time by
[41:44] the will of man
[41:46] but holy men of god speak
[41:48] as they were moved by the holy ghost
[41:51] so from wisdom versus faith say no no he
[41:53] tries to make the word say something
[41:55] knowledge
[41:57] wisdom
[41:58] reasoning
[41:59] wisdom finds a better way
[42:01] there's no other way but god's way
[42:03] wisdom tries to point out and say well
[42:05] you see we ought to do we couldn't do
[42:07] that and this time we must do it anyhow
[42:09] tries to find an easy way tries to make
[42:12] the bible say things it does not
[42:15] that is what wisdom does
[42:17] try to make the bible or the message or
[42:19] the word say something it did not say
[42:21] let's continue wait a moment we go back
[42:23] to the seed again what was the devil
[42:24] trying to do with wisdom
[42:26] make
[42:27] god's word
[42:28] say something that it didn't say
[42:31] he tried to make god's word say
[42:33] something that it didn't say so that's
[42:35] the way it comes today when they try to
[42:37] make god's word say something it doesn't
[42:39] say you say well brother branham you
[42:41] ain't got the right interpretation
[42:45] he said the bible said prophecy is of no
[42:47] private interpretation
[42:49] prophecy
[42:51] why why a is a private interpretation
[42:53] why the word of the lord came to the
[42:55] prophets
[42:56] it is to be interpreted by the prophet
[42:59] and as far as i know it have no malakai
[43:01] four and a half malakai for entry
[43:03] quarter mark on his son malakai for
[43:06] anybody else it says behold i will send
[43:09] you elijah the prophet and he
[43:13] and he only let me say it again good and
[43:16] he
[43:17] he only
[43:18] shall turn the hearts of the children
[43:20] back to the faith of the fathers and
[43:22] have no scripture for man making that
[43:24] interpretation to what the prophet
[43:26] brought
[43:26] he said the spirit the prophet and the
[43:28] bride will say the same thing
[43:31] oh glory to god
[43:33] what she said it is to be interpreted by
[43:35] the prophet it can't be an
[43:38] interpretation private
[43:40] the prophets
[43:42] already interpreted to you
[43:45] so the ministers and pastors was to
[43:47] bring light or bring it into a greater
[43:50] reality of what the prophet said
[43:53] not a new teaching
[43:55] not some new revelation but to bring to
[43:57] light
[43:58] what has been interpreted
[44:01] because no man can interpret the
[44:03] unwritten word the right rock
[44:05] it's like a prophet to interpret the
[44:07] unwritten word
[44:08] hallelujah i can't interpret on written
[44:10] word
[44:11] oh glory to god the mystery was sealed
[44:14] and it's like a prophet the angel to
[44:16] bring it on to the prophet put it on
[44:17] books and tapes and you will reveal it
[44:20] when you have reason to see it
[44:26] so what in the beginning was the word
[44:27] i'm going to skip down there so faith
[44:29] believes
[44:32] a god that can make me
[44:34] and can keep that book in order to make
[44:36] me live by
[44:37] so it cannot be like mistakes in it
[44:40] if god could keep us he can keep that
[44:42] word
[44:43] god keep that written word
[44:45] he have it just as he wanted
[44:47] it are no mistakes
[44:49] oh glory to god watch
[44:51] amen so let me read the scripture from
[44:53] romans 10. you could open it by if you
[44:54] want to find it from 17
[44:56] uh okay sorry romans 10
[44:59] it says so faith come by hearing and
[45:00] hearing by the word of god
[45:02] and this scripture here uh from romans i
[45:05] believe therefore
[45:07] by the deeds of the law of verse 20
[45:10] there shall no flesh be justified in his
[45:12] sight
[45:13] for by the law is the knowledge of sin
[45:15] and now the righteousness of god without
[45:17] the law is manifest being witnessed by
[45:19] the law and the prophets
[45:20] even the righteousness of god which is
[45:22] by faith of jesus christ unto all upon
[45:25] them that believe there is no difference
[45:27] for all have sinned
[45:29] and come short
[45:30] of the glory of god
[45:32] being justified freely by his grace
[45:37] through the redemption that is in christ
[45:39] jesus whom god has set forth to be
[45:42] appropriation through fate in his blood
[45:44] to declare his righteousness for
[45:46] remission of his sins that are passed
[45:48] through the forbearance of god to
[45:49] declare i say all this time his
[45:52] righteousness that he might be just and
[45:54] the justifier of them that believeth
[45:57] jesus
[45:58] where is the boast in them it is
[46:01] excluded by what law of works nay but by
[46:04] the law of faith
[46:05] therefore we conclude
[46:08] paul
[46:09] that a man
[46:10] is justified by faith without the deeds
[46:14] of the law
[46:15] is he the god of the jews only is he not
[46:17] also the gentiles yes of the gentiles
[46:19] also see it is one god which shall
[46:22] justify the circumcision by faith and
[46:24] the uncircumcision true faith do we then
[46:27] make void the law through faith god
[46:28] forbid we establish the law
[46:31] then he said what shall we say then of
[46:33] abraham our father as but timothy the
[46:35] flesh had found
[46:36] if abraham were justified by works he
[46:38] had bear after glory but not before god
[46:41] but what saith the scripture
[46:44] what the scriptures say abraham believed
[46:46] god and it was counted unto him
[46:49] for righteousness
[46:50] his confession of faith in god god
[46:53] ticket off
[46:54] has been declared righteous
[46:57] oh glory to god he didn't have to do
[46:58] nothing he believed god
[47:01] all glory to god and god justified him
[47:04] god conquered his faith as righteous
[47:07] oh glory to god you love him this
[47:09] morning
[47:10] now to him that worketh is the reward
[47:13] not reckon of grace but of debt
[47:15] but to him that will get not
[47:16] but believe it on him that justified the
[47:19] ungodly his fate is counted for
[47:22] righteousness all right let's take that
[47:25] and shine a light and woman of the world
[47:26] now
[47:27] she's unrighteous
[47:29] her front part is sinful
[47:32] she's a prostitute
[47:33] and jesus come
[47:35] and release that woman
[47:37] as if she never did it
[47:39] oh glory to god she was so free she tell
[47:42] the whole village come see a man
[47:44] that told me all that i did
[47:46] isn't this the christ
[47:48] the other woman caught in adultery each
[47:49] other go and sin no more
[47:51] oh glory to god hallelujah all glory to
[47:54] god he could justify the ungodly because
[47:57] what is in the back of them
[47:59] is what is predestinated
[48:01] what is the back of them is what he for
[48:03] knew

[48:07] too hard

[48:09] that's why the question is is anything
[48:12] too hard
[48:14] [Applause]

[48:18] prayer meeting

[54:18] a praise
[54:20] [Applause]
[54:26] [Applause]
[54:27] [Music]
[54:28] so how was this righteousness reckoned
[54:30] to abraham in circumcision on
[54:32] circumcision
[54:34] but in uncircumcision
[54:35] the bible said and it received the sign
[54:37] of circumcision
[54:38] and that sign was a seal
[54:42] of the righteousness
[54:44] of the faith
[54:45] which he had
[54:47] yet been uncircumcised
[54:51] he was uncircumcised but god brings
[54:54] circumcision
[54:55] to confirm
[54:57] the faith
[54:58] that he had
[54:59] while he was uncircumcised
[55:02] and by your faith
[55:04] you are just a fact
[55:06] or give the lord a shout
[55:09] you can feel justified
[55:12] you got to believe
[55:14] [Music]
[55:21] did you get that
[55:23] did you get your cat feel for this
[55:26] [Music]
[55:30] you see the sign of circumcision
[55:32] a seal of the righteousness of the fate
[55:35] which he had been uncircumcised
[55:37] that
[55:38] he
[55:39] might be the father of all them that
[55:42] believe
[55:43] though they be not circumcised
[55:46] so you see all this circumcision that
[55:48] the jews was boasting of covenant people
[55:51] and we are the circumcised our neighbor
[55:53] was a father and jesus had to bust them
[55:55] because abraham had this faith
[56:00] before so then let's look up this drew
[56:03] thing
[56:06] this favored people thing
[56:08] it mashed that up
[56:10] so when christ come fights bring the
[56:11] cross
[56:13] there's neither jew nor
[56:14] gentile burn or free
[56:17] male or female
[56:20] all one and
[56:24] [Applause]
[56:27] this is not
[56:28] heresy this is weird
[56:31] all right
[56:32] and the father of the circumcision to
[56:34] them who are not of the sacrament only
[56:36] but also who walk in the steps of that
[56:39] fate of our father abraham which he had
[56:42] been yet uncircumcised for the promise
[56:44] that he should be heir of the world was
[56:46] not the abraham or to his seed through
[56:48] the law
[56:49] but through the righteousness of faith
[56:52] for every day which of the lord be heirs
[56:55] then faith is made void
[56:56] and the promises made of non-effect then
[56:59] we better get a temple and put an
[57:00] alternate guess and kill some goats and
[57:02] cows and different things
[57:03] he said if faith if the law is the thing
[57:05] that i do weak i qualify at all because
[57:08] we have no temple we have no temple
[57:10] priest you follow him saying so watch
[57:12] down now because the law will get right
[57:14] but there will no no law is there is no
[57:16] transgression therefore it is a faith
[57:19] that it might be by grace
[57:22] so now this predestination come now as
[57:25] predestinated grace
[57:30] listen you should you should be praising
[57:32] god not suffering
[57:35] the preacher should be one to say re
[57:36] rest rest yourself
[57:41] you understand what we're seeing this
[57:42] morning
[57:43] this is the bible yeah now
[57:45] watch
[57:46] what therefore it is a fate that might
[57:49] be by grace to the end the promise might
[57:51] be to
[57:52] be sure to all the seed not to that only
[57:56] which is of the law but that also which
[57:58] is of the fate of abraham who's the
[58:00] father of us all
[58:02] for it is written i have made thee a
[58:04] father many nations before him we
[58:06] believe even god who quick not the dead

[1:03:13] oh glory to god i feel inspired this
[1:03:16] morning
[1:03:17] i feel i'm part of a bunch of people
[1:03:19] they're getting a revelation
[1:03:21] that they're called to continue their
[1:03:23] work
[1:03:24] [Music]
[1:03:26] [Applause]
[1:03:28] we're going to write another book of
[1:03:29] acts
[1:03:32] [Applause]
[1:03:38] let's script down quickly
[1:03:40] this is from galatians 3 22 and the
[1:03:42] scripture concluded all under sin
[1:03:44] that the promise of faith of jesus
[1:03:46] christ might be given to all and believe
[1:03:48] not some under sin not the jews spirit
[1:03:50] no all
[1:03:52] all of us same plaque for all all stink
[1:03:54] or rotten all deserve to go to hell that
[1:03:58] the promise could be given to all
[1:04:00] hallelujah
[1:04:01] remember all of them was under moses
[1:04:03] messenger
[1:04:06] all of them had moses books and quotes
[1:04:07] and tips but all them didn't really
[1:04:09] believe
[1:04:10] it only affect upon joshua and caleb
[1:04:13] the rest of them was killing time
[1:04:21] so the scripture has concluded all under
[1:04:23] sin
[1:04:24] that the promise of faith of jesus might
[1:04:25] be given to them that believe
[1:04:27] but before faith came
[1:04:29] before this faith came
[1:04:31] because you need fear to be justified
[1:04:34] hallelujah before faith came
[1:04:36] we were kept under the law
[1:04:38] shut up unto the fate which should
[1:04:40] afterwards be revealed
[1:04:42] wherefore the law was our school master
[1:04:44] to bring us to christ
[1:04:46] that we might be justified by faith
[1:04:49] so your good nice works your goody two
[1:04:51] shoes works
[1:04:53] cannot justify you
[1:04:56] you could wear your
[1:04:59] wear your top to the choke up here
[1:05:01] where you're dressing and sweep the
[1:05:03] floor
[1:05:04] wear shades on your eye
[1:05:06] and cover your head with the bonnet
[1:05:08] that nobody lost after you oh glory to
[1:05:11] god that still doesn't justify you
[1:05:14] glory to god
[1:05:16] never lie never cheat yourself going to
[1:05:18] hell if you don't repent
[1:05:20] that doesn't justify you
[1:05:22] brand new tie shoot that doesn't justify
[1:05:25] you
[1:05:26] all glory it will be filthy
[1:05:30] and seven thunder
[1:05:32] gets fit
[1:05:37] so this is a revival
[1:05:40] of the justify
[1:05:41] [Applause]
[1:05:44] oh glory to god
[1:05:46] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:05:48] god is about to unlock heaven
[1:05:51] the same voice that shut the heavens
[1:05:53] that same voice going to unlock the
[1:05:55] heavens
[1:05:56] i hear the song of the abundance of red
[1:06:00] dynamics to the mechanics
[1:06:03] signs wonders miracles
[1:06:05] all glory to god hallelujah
[1:06:07] [Music]
[1:06:09] and then
[1:06:10] paul says here

[1:06:27] christ then you are abraham's seed
[1:06:30] and heirs according to promise
[1:06:32] you hear that
[1:06:34] when you understand you are heir

[1:18:55] it have grain for you
[1:18:57] it have blessings for me
[1:18:59] it's our blessings for you
[1:19:01] the spirit
[1:19:03] and the bride
[1:19:05] sick of
[1:19:08] oh glory to god
[1:19:10] i'm having myself a time this morning
[1:19:12] i'm gonna preach myself happy
[1:19:14] oh glory to god hallelujah
[1:19:17] now watch
[1:19:18] there's only two
[1:19:20] he said two forces two two things wisdom
[1:19:22] versus fate and not god the ways i'm
[1:19:25] talking about now the wisdom that put
[1:19:26] people from the word he said there's
[1:19:28] only two sources we can draw our life
[1:19:30] from just two
[1:19:31] one of them is wisdom
[1:19:32] and the other is fate
[1:19:34] now fate was introduced and wisdom was
[1:19:36] introduced in genesis
[1:19:38] and satan is the order of wisdom trying
[1:19:41] to get the people to accept his wisdom
[1:19:44] and pull them away from the faith that
[1:19:45] in god's word
[1:19:46] notice what the devil tell eve if you
[1:19:49] eat of this tree god know you will be
[1:19:50] wise
[1:19:53] and all he has to do was believe god
[1:19:55] said so and i said
[1:19:56] tell your story working satan
[1:19:58] my husband
[1:20:00] but when she hear wisdom
[1:20:02] when she had the knowledge that he was
[1:20:03] supposed to reveal to her
[1:20:05] she bought to that and that's how we get
[1:20:06] messed up
[1:20:07] all right now god is the order of fate
[1:20:10] satan is the ought of wisdom
[1:20:11] god gave his children his word told them
[1:20:13] they must believe this and put a debt
[1:20:16] separation punishment if they feel they
[1:20:17] believe it satan comes a wrong and offer
[1:20:20] eve wisdom you will be wise knowing
[1:20:21] right from wrong see now of course
[1:20:24] anything that the devil has is a
[1:20:25] perversion of the original so the wisdom
[1:20:28] that i want you to get straight note
[1:20:30] before we start there is a wisdom of god
[1:20:32] and the wisdom of god is to stay with
[1:20:34] his word
[1:20:35] but satan in his wisdom tried to twist
[1:20:37] the word so that the that's the wisdom
[1:20:39] i'm speaking about
[1:20:40] so watch there's a certain amount of
[1:20:42] faith that goes with satan
[1:20:45] to accept satan you have to believe
[1:20:46] satan
[1:20:48] is a perfective fate so he said you
[1:20:50] don't want to revert refer to it as
[1:20:51] satan's fate
[1:20:53] so he referred to it as wisdom
[1:20:55] not satan's fate
[1:20:57] all right now there are children on
[1:20:59] either side
[1:21:00] on the wisdom side
[1:21:02] and on the faith side
[1:21:04] and if the faith of god came true god
[1:21:06] and god is the word god's children lives
[1:21:08] on faith
[1:21:09] the josh shall live not by wisdom
[1:21:11] [Music]
[1:21:12] but they're just saved by faith
[1:21:14] and faith come i hear in the word
[1:21:16] so the children on the faith side they
[1:21:18] believe the word
[1:21:19] they connect with the word are you with
[1:21:21] me
[1:21:22] oh glory to god hallelujah
[1:21:24] so there are so many people today that
[1:21:26] has the right knowledge that knows that
[1:21:29] this word should be god's word and this
[1:21:31] is god's word but they stand and let
[1:21:33] some seminary student reason them out of
[1:21:35] it away from the holy spirit
[1:21:38] and away from the things of god
[1:21:40] oh glory to god so faith has no reason
[1:21:44] faith doesn't know what reason is
[1:21:46] oh glory to god when abraham was told to
[1:21:48] offer by zach
[1:21:50] abraham told the man i am the lord we go
[1:21:52] up i like come back down
[1:21:54] he ain't think twice god tell him go and
[1:21:57] offer up your son you know but he tell
[1:21:58] them man we're going up we're going back
[1:22:00] down
[1:22:01] and when he tied isaac on the altar he
[1:22:02] was coming with a knife the angels were
[1:22:04] called twice abram holy hand hold on
[1:22:09] and because though has obeyed my voice
[1:22:13] he gave that promise upon abram
[1:22:15] and our sacrifice was laying right there
[1:22:17] iran was in the ticket already caught
[1:22:18] yes he got to run him down
[1:22:22] so if you say lord i waited to see the
[1:22:24] romney ticket

[1:22:27] to ticket her

[1:22:37] till rhyming ticket
[1:22:39] wait that will go tell you
[1:22:42] that is your interpretation
[1:22:44] you supposed to obey god
[1:22:46] he said off him up off him up
[1:22:48] oh glory to god so abraham you yeah
[1:22:51] right when you are prayed for and accept
[1:22:53] god's word for healing don't reason with
[1:22:54] your feelings
[1:22:56] oh glory to god isn't that right
[1:22:58] don't reason with nothing else that
[1:23:00] settles it
[1:23:01] by stripe i'm healed by stripe i'm

[1:23:23] forming into a head for the rapture
[1:23:25] so the life itself through all the seven

[1:26:01] but if i did do it i'm guilty
[1:26:03] and you could forgive me but i won't be
[1:26:05] guilty and yet i'm not justified because
[1:26:07] i actually done it but the word
[1:26:09] justified is though you've never done it
[1:26:15] i don't think the people get this yet
[1:26:17] you know
[1:26:19] i don't think the people getting there
[1:26:21] your self-condemnation and self-pity and

[1:26:30] watch the word justify
[1:26:33] is though you've never done it
[1:26:35] it's not even regarded at all
[1:26:38] how is it done in god's book
[1:26:41] of the sea of forgetfulness
[1:26:43] your old book and marriage is divorced
[1:26:46] and dead
[1:26:47] it's not even the memories of god
[1:26:54] did you hear that
[1:26:56] this is enough to bust up the ceiling
[1:26:57] you know
[1:26:58] and repair it next week you know
[1:27:00] this is not even the memories of god you
[1:27:02] are justified
[1:27:04] it was accused you was accused but you
[1:27:07] never did it
[1:27:09] the old union is in the sea of
[1:27:10] forgetfulness you wasn't married here to
[1:27:13] begin with
[1:27:14] he the bridegroom brought your shame
[1:27:18] he took your place
[1:27:20] you were predestinated for him
[1:27:24] to be
[1:27:25] in his bride
[1:27:26] [Music]
[1:27:27] [Applause]
[1:27:30] [Music]
[1:27:31] here is why this justification is so
[1:27:34] clean
[1:27:35] he said you were deceiving to it by your
[1:27:37] first marriage
[1:27:38] to your adulterous parent evil it's no
[1:27:41] fault of your own
[1:27:43] your natural birth you come after evil
[1:27:45] commit adultery that's the reason you
[1:27:47] were born an adulteress you are sinner
[1:27:49] to begin with you will deceive into it
[1:27:51] it ain't your fault
[1:27:54] that's right easy for justification to
[1:27:56] come to you
[1:27:58] because adam didn't fall we was not
[1:27:59] going to be in the state
[1:28:02] oh glory to god
[1:28:04] suffer goes to restore us back to eden
[1:28:06] he had to make a provision for
[1:28:08] justification
[1:28:10] as if you never did it
[1:28:13] not just forgiven
[1:28:17] [Applause]

[1:32:26] as as the holy ghost
[1:32:28] you will see every one of them
[1:32:31] if there's an eagle in there somewhere

[1:33:17] among the bunch of chickens
[1:33:19] watch
[1:33:20] watch now we find out that those
[1:33:22] atmospheres those things where faith is
[1:33:24] taught at church you'll find the church
[1:33:26] and that happens oh god he said let me
[1:33:29] get this to you
[1:33:30] if you could see it that's the reason
[1:33:33] people come among the scenes when
[1:33:34] they're praying paul said he didn't find
[1:33:36] any in the city only timothy that was
[1:33:38] like precious fate the rest of them was
[1:33:40] all the nominations but when he got into
[1:33:43] that atmosphere you find things going on
[1:33:46] that's the atmosphere was created you
[1:33:48] find people living by faith when you get
[1:33:50] into a place where it says my the bible
[1:33:52] is true god heals you walk around that
[1:33:55] congregation why i was then a cancer i
[1:33:57] was healed i was once blind i see the
[1:34:00] stranger said whoa you see what i mean
[1:34:02] what was the matter with you i can show
[1:34:04] you on record come home with me come eat
[1:34:07] dinner with me i will show you i got a
[1:34:09] record my neighbor now i was in a i was
[1:34:12] paralyzed for years and i was prayed for
[1:34:15] and that's the church we're talking
[1:34:16] about believers has created the
[1:34:18] atmosphere
[1:34:20] way too many believers yes
[1:34:23] like you yes
[1:34:25] create an atmosphere
[1:34:27] that the sick can't stay sick
[1:34:30] the blind can't stay blind
[1:34:38] [Applause]
[1:34:39] [Music]
[1:34:40] no how is the word in simplicity
[1:34:43] but in its completeness ever going to
[1:34:44] grow
[1:34:45] in a place where knowledge overshadows
[1:34:47] that
[1:34:48] it can't be so
[1:34:49] so where knowledge is preached from a
[1:34:51] seminary the children die
[1:34:53] where faith is preached from the word
[1:34:55] the children live
[1:34:56] that's the difference just life
[1:34:59] and death the same thing happened to god
[1:35:01] in the eden that's exactly what happened
[1:35:03] with them to atmosphere
[1:35:05] when eve got off the right one the wrong
[1:35:07] one she died
[1:35:09] and they cannot say if your church has
[1:35:11] got that kind of atmosphere if you want
[1:35:13] to live you believe the word
[1:35:15] you want to hear a bomb
[1:35:17] the seed word cannot grow in the
[1:35:19] accuracy of knowledge
[1:35:20] [Applause]
[1:35:21] [Music]
[1:35:24] so they can preach mystery till they
[1:35:26] blew in the face unless an atmosphere of
[1:35:29] faith a breakthrough dear
[1:35:32] that would bring the praises upon the
[1:35:33] people's lips
[1:35:37] [Applause]
[1:35:40] you see
[1:35:42] the seed word
[1:35:44] cannot grow in the atmosphere of
[1:35:46] knowledge
[1:35:47] eve said the lord god the day we eat
[1:35:49] that day we die right but satan said but
[1:35:51] listen dear you love little things
[1:35:53] surely god made you of a people you know
[1:35:55] that's right you're a woman you made for
[1:35:58] purpose what you don't know it but you
[1:36:01] were made for this purpose you love
[1:36:02] little thing there look at those dainty
[1:36:04] little hands well you would not surely
[1:36:06] die
[1:36:08] you think that good loving father god
[1:36:09] would do such a thing like that
[1:36:11] what she do she listened
[1:36:13] to reason took his wisdom
[1:36:15] a tree of delight one desired of it
[1:36:18] and as soon as you fall for it it
[1:36:20] finished right there
[1:36:21] you see the sea she was holding and
[1:36:23] would have finally become a mother by
[1:36:25] the will of god through a spoken word
[1:36:27] she would have finally become a mother
[1:36:28] but she couldn't wait
[1:36:30] and she went into that
[1:36:32] so you see as soon as she accepted satan
[1:36:34] wisdom she died
[1:36:35] isn't that right
[1:36:37] and if wisdom is with the word that
[1:36:38] proves it to be with the word and the
[1:36:40] word produces itself that's that that's
[1:36:41] fine
[1:36:42] but the holy ghost sees of the bible
[1:36:43] here we go this is our next bomb
[1:36:45] cannot grow in the atmosphere of wisdom
[1:36:49] oh glory that kills every seminary that
[1:36:51] knocks the holes right off to them and
[1:36:53] punctures them
[1:36:55] [Applause]
[1:36:57] glory
[1:36:58] four was a mystery
[1:37:00] see that growing nothing
[1:37:02] yes people have a big head
[1:37:04] hallelujah she wasn't supposed to listen
[1:37:07] to anybody oh my
[1:37:09] and you talk about this you know we
[1:37:11] could see 500 rush to the author tonight
[1:37:13] that would be a good sign the revival is
[1:37:15] about to break we don't have to have 500
[1:37:17] at the altar we just have to take god's
[1:37:18] word and start rejoicing
[1:37:20] something will happen
[1:37:22] that brings the world to life
[1:37:24] when we water it with praises
[1:37:27] that's why the devil fights all these
[1:37:28] shouting and the praising and the
[1:37:29] hallelujah in the church devil don't
[1:37:31] want that because once you start to get
[1:37:33] your prayers it's going up
[1:37:35] you see when you're in sin you can't
[1:37:37] praise god you know you're heavy
[1:37:39] but when you accept the promise and you
[1:37:41] see god promise me the holy ghost oh my
[1:37:43] god i didn't actually promise you no god
[1:37:45] come down in love and say i've given you
[1:37:46] this i give you that i've given you
[1:37:48] think about it

[1:37:54] house for you here i have a hotel for

[1:37:59] yeah
[1:38:00] oh god do you really mean it
[1:38:05] i didn't ask for it you know
[1:38:07] jesus died and tell me all is his mind
[1:38:09] you know
[1:38:10] he dropped the key of faith and said
[1:38:11] unlock the door
[1:38:13] wherever do you see lock up just turn
[1:38:15] the key open the door
[1:38:17] [Applause]
[1:38:20] listen all the things we are claiming
[1:38:22] satan have no access to
[1:38:26] he is jealous this morning
[1:38:30] could never be a son
[1:38:32] he could never be a heir
[1:38:34] he already fallen
[1:38:35] his sentence is already judged
[1:38:38] he had everything later fire
[1:38:40] we headed for a millennium come on now
[1:38:42] come and preach back to me somebody
[1:38:46] let me see let me see
[1:38:48] what brings the world to life when you
[1:38:49] water the world with praises what makes
[1:38:51] a seed grow water what makes the word of
[1:38:54] god grow is the praises of

[1:38:56] [Applause]
[1:38:57] if they god hear it hear it now
[1:38:59] that's why when john saw the lamb take
[1:39:02] the book he said all in heaven all under
[1:39:04] the earth heard i praise god what is it
[1:39:07] kingdom worship
[1:39:09] and lucifer himself i've been fighting
[1:39:11] this all these years but he is defeated
[1:39:15] [Applause]
[1:39:17] [Music]
[1:39:18] you may be seated
[1:39:22] what do you think what do you think what
[1:39:23] made god god
[1:39:25] what is what god means
[1:39:26] object of worship
[1:39:28] why didn't lucifer get jealous in heaven
[1:39:30] for the worship that was given to god he
[1:39:32] wanted that for him and the angels that
[1:39:35] represented us up there said no
[1:39:38] he made a coin heaven
[1:39:40] and hooked some angels with a steel
[1:39:43] hallelujah lie

[1:40:18] the bible says
[1:40:20] if you commit those seed into the ground

[1:40:24] it up and dig it up and put it back down
[1:40:25] no he commits into the ground he said
[1:40:27] now that's the same weight as with the
[1:40:28] word of god
[1:40:29] if you take the divine promise god mean
[1:40:32] his bible into your heart
[1:40:33] and water it every day
