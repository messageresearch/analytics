[31:12] liberty to worship we still have that
[31:14] freedom of religion
[31:16] it will always be that way but this is
[31:18] what we have for now
[31:20] so this morning i have a few comments
[31:22] uh just before we get into the word
[31:25] and i just want to read something that
[31:27] uh was on the news and i feel that it
[31:29] will edify you
[31:31] and help you
[31:33] tallahassee hospital staff she had
[31:36] breaking stories
[31:37] of talking dead
[31:39] covet patience
[31:42] the situation is so heartbreaking right
[31:44] now
[31:45] that many of those doctors
[31:47] many of those nurses are referring to
[31:49] some of these patients that are sick
[31:51] of the sick
[31:52] as the quote are talking dead
[31:55] i ask why
[31:57] and the answer is also really
[31:59] heartbreaking here
[32:00] that's because
[32:02] that refers to some of those patients
[32:05] whose lungs are so heavily damaged
[32:08] by this virus
[32:10] that they can no longer breathe on their
[32:12] own
[32:13] and here's the thing
[32:15] those are patients who are still awake
[32:18] right now
[32:19] who are still conscious
[32:21] so they are having these very difficult
[32:24] conversations
[32:25] with their doctors and their nurses
[32:27] and facing that very tough reality that
[32:31] if that life-sustaining equipment
[32:33] that's breeding for them is removed
[32:35] as this hospital official describe it
[32:38] for me
[32:39] they could be dead in a matter of
[32:40] minutes
[32:41] and that really does speak
[32:44] to the heartbreak of what's happening in
[32:46] many of these hospitals
[32:48] throughout the sunshine state
[32:52] another one children under 12
[32:55] get in covet 19 at an alarming rate
[32:59] that's another piece of news one more
[33:01] washington post this was wednesday 18th
[33:03] august
[33:04] a mom who died of covet days after a
[33:07] husband makes one final wish make sure
[33:11] my kids get vaccinated
[33:14] a few weeks ago
[33:15] lydia rodriguez thought her body was
[33:17] strong enough
[33:19] to fight the coroner virus without the
[33:21] vaccine
[33:22] but after a week-long church camp
[33:25] she
[33:26] and other members of her family
[33:28] tested positive for the colonel virus
[33:31] by the time rogers 42 changed her mind
[33:35] and asked for the shot
[33:37] it was too late
[33:39] a doctor said
[33:41] a doctor said
[33:42] a ventilator awaited her
[33:45] her cousin dotty told the washington
[33:47] post
[33:49] out of options
[33:51] the garvin sun texas mother of four asks
[33:54] her family to make a promise please make
[33:56] sure
[33:58] my kids get vaccinated
[34:00] rodriguez a piano teacher told her
[34:02] sister during her last
[34:04] phone call rodriguez died monday
[34:08] two weeks after her husband lawrence
[34:10] rodriguez 49
[34:12] also died after coronavirus
[34:13] complications
[34:15] the couple fought the virus on hospital
[34:17] beds just a few feet from one another
[34:20] in a texas intensive care unit june said
[34:24] lydia and lawrence rodriguez who were
[34:26] married for 21 years
[34:28] were among the tens of millions of
[34:30] americans
[34:32] who have not yet received at least one
[34:34] dose
[34:34] of the conor irs vaccine
[34:37] which is available free to anyone over
[34:39] the age of 12.
[34:41] health officials have stressed
[34:43] that the vaccine significantly lowers
[34:46] one chance
[34:47] of becoming severely ill
[34:50] or dying of the virus
[34:52] the now orphaned children
[34:55] of the rodriguez family
[34:57] joined the millions
[35:00] tragically affected by the sometimes
[35:03] deadly illness
[35:05] the case of rodriguez family echoes that
[35:08] of other unvaccinated patients
[35:12] who have begged their doctors for
[35:14] vaccine doses before being intubated
[35:18] lydia has never really believed in
[35:20] vaccines jones 55 told the post she
[35:23] believed that she could handle
[35:24] everything on her own
[35:25] and you didn't really need medicine
[35:28] a neonatal nurse jones was familiar
[35:32] with the serious effects of covet 19 had
[35:34] on mothers
[35:36] and baby she treated at the sugarland
[35:38] texas hospital where she worked
[35:40] she shared with rodriguez how she had
[35:42] watched patient
[35:43] after patient
[35:45] be connected to a ventilator for weeks
[35:47] without much improvement
[35:50] jones could have gone on and on but her
[35:52] cousin silence spoke for itself
[35:54] i knew she would never get vaccinated
[35:56] jones told the post i was very concerned
[36:00] rodriguez husband
[36:02] who shared her anti-vaccine beliefs
[36:05] also declined to get the shot
[36:07] three of their four children are
[36:09] eligible i have not yet received a
[36:12] vaccine
[36:13] in early july
[36:14] after rodriguez and the children
[36:16] returned from a christian church camp
[36:19] jones's worst fears became true
[36:22] one by one
[36:23] each member of the family including
[36:25] rodriguez's husband
[36:27] who did not attend camp because of work
[36:30] tested positive
[36:31] for the kona virus
[36:33] the family didn't tell anyone that they
[36:35] were sick until rodriguez husband drove
[36:37] her to the hospital on july 12th
[36:40] after she began experiencing shortness
[36:42] of breath
[36:43] rodriguez was admitted to the icu
[36:46] and her husband was admitted to another
[36:47] ward jones said
[36:49] by then
[36:50] the rest of the family stepped in
[36:52] bringing groceries and medicine to the
[36:54] couple's four children
[36:55] who were all infected and quarantined at
[36:58] home
[36:59] the youngest child
[37:06] the youngest child
[37:14] and by then the rest of the family
[37:15] stepped in as to bring groceries and
[37:18] messenger to the couple's four children
[37:20] who were all infected and quarantined at
[37:22] home
[37:23] the youngest child was the only one to
[37:25] experience mild symptoms jones said the
[37:28] rest were asymptomatic
[37:30] at one point
[37:32] lawrence rodriguez condition appeared to
[37:34] be improving
[37:35] but a couple of days later
[37:37] he was admitted he was rushed to the icu
[37:39] he requested a coronavirus vaccine
[37:41] shortly before being put on a ventilator
[37:44] jones said it was also too late for him
[37:47] he died august second
[37:49] and by then
[37:50] lydia rodriguez was fully dependent on
[37:52] an oxygen mask that prevented her from
[37:55] talking to her children who called to
[37:57] check in and sing christian hymns to
[38:00] lift her spirits
[38:01] we are praying for you on taking care of
[38:03] the kids jones recounted telling her
[38:05] cousin during the last days hospital
[38:07] staff called family
[38:09] august 16 to report the rodgers had died
[38:12] the family has relayed her last wishes
[38:15] about a vaccine to the couple's 18 year
[38:17] old twins joan said dot the plan is to
[38:20] schedule an appointment for the 11 year
[38:21] old daughter as soon as she qualify and
[38:24] the couple's six-year-old son is
[38:25] expected to get the shot soon
[38:27] and so on
[38:29] i share this with you
[38:30] because i know we have people in this
[38:32] church and i could only talk about
[38:34] districts who are still unvaccinated and
[38:36] strange enough
[38:38] they don't want the government to make
[38:40] it mandated to take it
[38:42] but pastors take it on their own cells
[38:44] to mandate to the congregation don't
[38:46] take the vaccine
[38:48] so they've taken
[38:49] instruction from a message pope
[38:51] or some pope behind the pulpit not to
[38:53] take the vaccine but they don't want to
[38:55] take it but what i want to say this
[38:56] morning is this
[38:59] don't let
[39:00] your liberty affect the lives of others
[39:04] this christian woman
[39:06] she went to camp her husband didn't go
[39:08] to the camp
[39:09] but she brought it from the camp
[39:11] to her house
[39:12] and she
[39:14] affected the home
[39:17] and this is my this is where we come now
[39:20] you have your liberty to be unvaccinated
[39:23] but do you have liberty
[39:26] to kill this one or infect that one
[39:29] it is well known
[39:31] that
[39:33] more people come through the virus than
[39:35] have died
[39:36] so much people have died some people got
[39:38] infected and christian non-christian
[39:41] most people are coming true
[39:43] some people have died yes
[39:44] but i don't want to talk about those
[39:46] that have died
[39:47] i want to talk a little bit about those
[39:49] that are in this condition just call
[39:51] them the talking dead
[39:53] so sick
[39:55] so affected
[39:56] that they're living off this machine
[39:59] i trust that this
[40:01] shakes some of you in your head
[40:03] because to me it is not love
[40:06] it is not care it is plain downright
[40:09] selfishness and indifference and people
[40:11] will get hurt
[40:13] i hope
[40:14] and trust that trinidad
[40:16] could become so what they call it um
[40:19] a herd immunity
[40:21] to protect all of those who are not
[40:23] vaccinated or don't want to be
[40:24] vaccinated that all they could beat all
[40:25] your chest and say oh you'll win fine i
[40:27] have no problem with that i trust that
[40:29] we get her humanity
[40:32] because other than that
[40:33] if what we are seeing in the states and
[40:35] elsewhere with this delta variant and
[40:37] the variants that are coming out it
[40:39] beginning to affect children
[40:41] children beginning to die we talk about
[40:43] four-year-old turning under 12 years old
[40:45] being infected whereas the first wave of
[40:47] the virus didn't interfere with turret
[40:49] didn't touch children but it's so doing
[40:51] so now
[40:52] so i want you to think
[40:54] what your so-called liberty and choice
[40:57] that you have
[40:58] that you could affect your husband
[41:01] your wife
[41:02] your girlfriend your boyfriend your son
[41:05] your daughter you could do that you
[41:07] could break them bring the the virus
[41:09] straight in the house and take out
[41:11] grandma
[41:12] wipe out grandpa
[41:14] take out the family
[41:16] for what purpose
[41:18] i wonder
[41:19] what kind of conscience these pastors
[41:21] gonna have to live with
[41:22] when these things begin to hit churches
[41:24] and hit lives
[41:25] i wonder how they will sleep well
[41:28] telling the people don't take the
[41:29] vaccine
[41:30] if the man's scared and don't want to
[41:31] take the chap that is his business but
[41:33] he has no right dictating to me his
[41:35] revelation of the vaccine he have a
[41:37] right to preach with a god and i'm not
[41:39] here to preach on vaccine i get to make
[41:41] this as comments so i hope they speak to
[41:44] your heart and tell yourself you better
[41:45] think carefully if you want to stay in
[41:47] your own box and stay permanent and
[41:49] don't move that's your choice
[41:51] but it come in
[41:53] you can't say how you can say when all
[41:56] you could say do something about it
[41:58] there is no room not to do anything
[42:01] do something be quite common to you
[42:04] so don't take your liberty to kill
[42:06] somebody
[42:07] don't take your liberty to afflict
[42:08] somebody don't take that that's your
[42:10] freedom and if you don't be unvaccinated
[42:12] fine
[42:13] but be careful
[42:14] that that same freedom
[42:16] affects some others
[42:18] one last comment there was a woman in
[42:20] russia
[42:22] they watched this virus mutate about 40
[42:24] times and they said the virus was using
[42:26] a body like a gym
[42:28] to improve itself
[42:30] think about it now
[42:32] jehovah
[42:33] praise anybody you want to switch over
[42:35] now we want to get into the words
[42:37] [Music]
[43:09] hallelujah
[43:15] [Music]
[43:23] fight for your name one more time
[43:26] jehovah is your name
[43:29] jehovah
[43:31] hears your name
[43:37] jehovah
[43:41] [Music]
[43:46] he's a
[43:47] mighty warrior
[43:50] crazy
[43:52] [Music]

[44:58] pictures some some of the stuff from his
[45:01] father to his brothers
[45:02] to his and eliabe's eldest brotherhood
[45:05] when he speak unto the men and the
[45:06] layups anger was kindle against david he
[45:09] said why came as though his and with
[45:11] whom hast thou left those few sheep in
[45:13] wilderness i know thy pride and the
[45:15] naughtiness of their heart for thou art
[45:18] come down the door might just see the
[45:19] battle
[45:20] and david said what have i no done
[45:23] is there not a cause
[45:25] and he turned from him towards another
[45:27] and speak after the same manner and the
[45:30] people answered him again after the
[45:31] former manner and when the words were
[45:33] heard which they would speak
[45:35] they rehearsed them before saw and he
[45:38] sent for him
[45:40] and david said to saul let no man had
[45:42] failed because of him thy servant will
[45:44] go and fight this philistine
[45:47] and saul said to david thou are not able
[45:50] to go against this philistine to fight
[45:51] with him for the what but a ute and he a
[45:54] man of war from his youth
[45:56] and david said on the soul die save and
[45:58] kept his father's sheep became a land
[46:00] and a beer and took a lamb out of the
[46:02] flock and i went after him and smote him
[46:05] and delivered it out of his mouth and
[46:07] when he arose against me i caught him by
[46:09] his beard and smote him and slew him thy
[46:12] servants through boat the land and the
[46:15] bear and this uncircumcised philistine
[46:17] shall be as one of them
[46:19] seeing he had defined
[46:21] the armies of the living god david said
[46:23] moreover the lord had delivered me out
[46:25] of the poor of the land out of the poor
[46:27] of the beer he would deliver me out of
[46:29] the hand of this philistine
[46:31] and saul said unto david go and the lord
[46:34] be with thee
[46:36] saul armed devil with his armor he put
[46:38] an helmet of brass upon his head and he
[46:40] armed them in a quota mail david greeted
[46:42] his sword upon his armor he has said to
[46:45] go for he had not proved it
[46:47] and david said i cannot go with these i
[46:50] have not proved them
[46:51] and david put them off him
[46:54] he took his staff in his hand
[46:56] chosen five smooth stones out of a brook
[46:58] he put him in shepherd's bag which he
[47:00] had even in a script and his sling was
[47:03] in his hand and he junior to the
[47:05] philistine
[47:06] and the philistine came on
[47:09] and drew near unto david and the man
[47:11] that bear the shield went before him and
[47:13] when the philistine
[47:15] looked about and saw david he disdain
[47:17] him for he was but a youth ready of a
[47:20] fair countenance and the philistines
[47:21] said unto david am i a dog the dog came
[47:24] comes to me with stabs
[47:27] on the philistine cursed david by his
[47:29] gods and the philistines said to david
[47:31] come to me and i will give thy flesh
[47:33] unto the fold of the air unto the beast
[47:35] of the field then said david to the
[47:37] philistines don't commence to me with
[47:39] sword with spear with a shield but i
[47:42] come to dean the name of the lord of
[47:43] hosts the god of the armies of israel
[47:45] whom thou has defied
[47:47] this day will the lord deliver thee into
[47:49] my hand and i will snipe thee and will
[47:52] take
[47:53] thine head from thee i will give the
[47:56] carcasses of the host of the philistines
[47:58] this day unto the falls of the air under
[48:00] the wild beasts of the earth that all
[48:02] the it men know that there is a god in
[48:04] israel and all this assembly shall know
[48:07] that the lord saveth not with sword and
[48:09] spear for the battle is the lord's and
[48:12] he will give you unto our hands and came
[48:14] to pass when the philistines arose and
[48:17] came and drew near to meet david that
[48:19] david hasted and ran towards the army to
[48:21] meet the philistines and david put his
[48:23] hand in his back took dance's stone
[48:25] slang it smoked the philistine in his
[48:27] forehead and the stone sunk in his
[48:30] forehead and he fell upon the face to
[48:32] the earth so david prevailed over the
[48:34] philistine with a sling and a stone and
[48:36] smote the philistine and slew him but
[48:38] there was no sword in the hand of david
[48:40] therefore david ran and stood upon the
[48:43] philistine and took his sword and drew
[48:45] it out of his sheet therefore and slew
[48:47] him
[48:48] and cut off his head there with when the
[48:51] philistines saw the champion was dead
[48:53] they fled like that when the champion
[48:55] was dead they fled and the men of israel
[48:58] and judah arose and shouted and pursued
[49:00] the philistines until that
[49:02] until they'll come to the valley under
[49:04] the gates of ekron and the wounded of
[49:06] the philistines fell down by the way of

[51:30] joshua's ministry
[51:32] elisha's ministry
[51:35] and i have an inspiration
[51:37] the ministry of jesus christ
[51:40] in the adopted sons in the last day
[51:44] of the context scripture acts chapter 4
[51:46] 31 to 33
[51:49] and it reads and when they had prayed
[51:52] the place was shaking where they were
[51:54] assembled together
[51:56] and they were all
[51:58] filled with the holy ghost
[52:00] and they staked the word of god with
[52:02] boldness
[52:03] and the multitude of them that believe
[52:06] who have one heart
[52:07] and of one soul
[52:10] neither said any of them that ought of
[52:12] the things which he possessed as his own
[52:15] but they all had things in common this
[52:18] is the voice i want to get to
[52:20] and with great power
[52:22] gave the apostles witness
[52:25] of the resurrection of the lord jesus
[52:27] and great grace was upon them all
[52:31] oh blessed be the name of the lord great
[52:33] power is what the bosses have to give
[52:37] witness
[52:38] of the resurrection of jesus christ
[52:41] now let's go
[52:43] buddha bryan
[52:45] let's go back to the real first light
[52:47] the old pentecostal blessing and the
[52:49] power of the holy ghost back in the
[52:51] church
[52:52] they put it all on the preacher today
[52:55] it ain't the preacher here we go the
[52:58] holy ghost is just as much to the laity
[53:03] as it is to the preacher or give the
[53:06] lord a shout feeling good already the
[53:08] holy ghost is what just as much to the
[53:11] laity as it is to the preacher
[53:14] he ain't got all the religion they cut
[53:17] it out here
[53:18] i am one today this is god a manner
[53:21] that believes
[53:23] that we ought to get the spirit of god
[53:25] back in the church
[53:27] where we can have the gifts of the
[53:28] spirit operating with unction and power
[53:32] this is not a brother to your thing this
[53:35] is what a brand i'm saying i want i'm
[53:37] one today
[53:39] that believes we ought to get the spirit
[53:42] of god
[53:43] back in the church where
[53:45] we can have the gifts of the spirit
[53:48] operating with unction and power but
[53:51] today
[53:52] we find men wearing the beginning in the
[53:54] church ages you notice it started at
[53:57] deeds of the nicolaitans
[53:59] after a while it become a doctrine well
[54:02] what is it
[54:03] we have taken all the spirit
[54:06] away from the congregation and make
[54:09] bishops
[54:11] oversteers
[54:12] popes you see where i get message poop
[54:14] from because that's what they make when
[54:16] they take the spirit off
[54:18] from the congregation and put it on men
[54:20] message men pastor men so-called
[54:22] fivefold men
[54:24] not not god fightful as men who assume
[54:27] things
[54:27] now they have taken all the spirit away
[54:30] from the congregation and made bishops
[54:34] overseers
[54:35] popes
[54:36] put it all in the pulpit and the pulpit
[54:40] got intellectual
[54:42] hallelujah no more spirit just talk and
[54:46] more talk mystery on top of mystery just
[54:49] intellectual explanation a reference
[54:51] from who say and who said who said who
[54:54] say oh there
[54:55] i ain't come to preach some time
[54:56] magazine or music magazine that's what
[54:58] them say all day i'm come to preach i'm
[54:59] the word of god because the word is
[55:02] original seed what word not my word the
[55:05] word from the mouth of the prophets
[55:08] oh glory to god amen
[55:11] so watch they put it all in the pulpit
[55:13] and the pulpit got intellectual and
[55:15] there you got a hybrid church again
[55:19] under
[55:20] intellectuals
[55:22] but obama said god
[55:24] sent us back to the holy ghost amongst
[55:27] the people
[55:28] let the unction of the spirit move among
[55:31] the people giving forth messages and
[55:34] power and manifestation if we have to
[55:36] stand on the street corner or get a
[55:38] chicken hole to abandon somewhere oh
[55:41] praise the name of the lord and if jesus
[55:44] christ lived in the apostles and done
[55:46] the signs that he was hearing it it will
[55:48] do it again if we get zeroed in we have
[55:51] got to get zeroed i don't care what the
[55:53] church says that's why i try to say zero
[55:56] on this promise i want to know what has
[55:58] promised the bride i don't want to know
[56:00] what the devil this doing out here and
[56:02] that doing out here i want to know what
[56:03] is my promise because i have to deal
[56:05] with the press with room with with false
[56:07] prophets with false people you have to
[56:09] deal with all of that oh praise the name
[56:11] of the lord if the apostles hit the dot
[56:13] we can hit the dot too could somebody
[56:15] say amen if we will get zeroed with
[56:18] god's word let our experience zero with
[56:21] his word they did it if they did it we
[56:24] can do it too amen oh blessed being of
[56:26] the lord that's so
[56:28] wonderful the subject we talk about
[56:30] david's ministry joshua ministry
[56:33] and elijah ministry the fight for
[56:34] ministry and type
[56:36] now david was virtually an unknown
[56:39] god told samuel
[56:41] david are nobody virtually unknown
[56:43] anointed to be king by samuel
[56:46] under divine instruction
[56:48] and we know we know the story and i
[56:51] wanted to show
[56:52] as this is a type of the fifo ministry
[56:55] because i keep saying it i know a lot of
[56:57] ministers and brothers disagree what i'm
[56:59] saying but
[57:00] i keep seeing it anyhow because it's
[57:02] what i believe and this is what i'm
[57:03] seeing in the word and i'll preach it
[57:05] because i see it and i believe it
[57:08] there's a fiffold ministry yet
[57:11] the reason i'm saying that it will take
[57:13] dynamics to produce the five world
[57:15] ministry so right now we are doing a
[57:17] work of apostles doing the work of a
[57:18] prophet doing a work of evangelist doing
[57:20] the work of a teacher doing for pastor
[57:21] i've been doing this thing for many many
[57:23] years
[57:24] but it takes god to place me in the
[57:27] position that's something different
[57:29] that is something absolutely different
[57:31] they come like if you ask a question to
[57:33] you do you believe they are false
[57:34] anointed ones
[57:36] not in the way that was prophesied
[57:40] they are bridging who are false
[57:43] they are blessed who are teaching false
[57:45] teachings and false doctrines
[57:47] they are false but they are not anointed
[57:50] false yet
[57:51] when the anointing strike
[57:54] then they become the anointed ones
[57:56] faults
[57:58] but for now
[57:59] maybe
[58:01] god could flip them wrong i don't know
[58:03] because when the door for the gentile
[58:05] was about open
[58:06] about to be open there was a man named
[58:09] saul
[58:10] that was fighting the church
[58:12] now if we stay back as the church and
[58:14] say saul false anointed he's fighting
[58:17] the message he's fighting inspiration we
[58:19] was going to be off
[58:21] because saul was going to become paul
[58:24] so that was the beginning
[58:26] so god gave saul that space
[58:29] flip him over he was changed to paul and
[58:32] we know he wrote the new testament and
[58:33] so like that
[58:35] that was in the beginning
[58:36] now this is the ending now
[58:38] there's the ending where the door of the
[58:39] gentile is about to be closed
[58:42] and seeds have been sown
[58:44] and you cannot change your seed mid
[58:46] harvest
[58:47] you cannot in the middle of your being a
[58:49] corn and you're saying you know what i
[58:50] want to be a peas no it's too late
[58:53] a little while you'll be a corn
[58:56] a little by you'll bear your hate or
[58:58] your animosity or your evil or your
[59:00] unforgiveness and a little while you're
[59:02] getting your harvest you can't change it
[59:04] even when the holy spirit told the
[59:06] prophet pick up the pendant right he
[59:08] said many the holy spirit said many true
[59:12] ministers will misunderstand that
[59:14] prophet
[59:15] so i cannot say this one false and that
[59:17] one verse no
[59:18] here's why the true anointing have to
[59:21] come forward first and we haven't seen
[59:22] that yet
[59:24] oh glory to god hallelujah
[59:26] we haven't seen that yet because
[59:28] dynamics will push forward the true
[59:31] anointed and this is where david coming
[59:33] off
[59:34] oh hallelujah oh glory to god i feel
[59:38] inspired
[59:39] now david
[59:41] god gets fed up with saul
[59:43] and god tells samuel go and anoint me a
[59:45] king
[59:46] of one of jesse's son we know the story
[59:50] david was not even considered
[59:53] by jesse he bring out all them star boys
[59:57] all them regulars and when samuel said
[59:59] is there any more because what i'm
[1:00:02] seeing here i have no witness
[1:00:04] the teaching was good the preaching was
[1:00:06] perfect
[1:00:07] the revelation was very good but the
[1:00:10] witness of the spirit wasn't there upon
[1:00:12] that prophet
[1:00:13] so yeah they say send some more is there
[1:00:15] any more they bring david
[1:00:18] unknown guy
[1:00:19] seen about she poured the oil upon him
[1:00:22] all right
[1:00:23] then david gone back into obscurity yeah
[1:00:26] yeah about david david seemed about
[1:00:27] sheep no
[1:00:29] david's father
[1:00:30] inspired to send david with some rituals
[1:00:34] for his brothers
[1:00:36] his brothers trying to embarrass him and
[1:00:38] belittling him and david said isn't
[1:00:40] there a cause because when david was
[1:00:42] leaving goliath made his role send me a
[1:00:44] man we know the story
[1:00:46] david gave a testimony
[1:00:48] that none of them had
[1:00:50] he had given experience that none of
[1:00:52] them had
[1:00:53] that is why he didn't care about sword
[1:00:55] and spear and armor and shield or even
[1:00:58] goliath size he said who is that
[1:01:01] uncircumstance i'm going to fight him
[1:01:03] that's the fightful ministry the
[1:01:05] fightful ministry going to take out
[1:01:06] goliath oh glory to god hallelujah in
[1:01:09] this message the faithful ministry going
[1:01:12] to be positioning place internationally
[1:01:14] to deal with the intellectual giants in
[1:01:16] this message oh gloria that's david's
[1:01:18] ministry that is christ's ministry oh
[1:01:21] blessed be the lord but about many
[1:01:24] meetings many men many ministers come to
[1:01:26] me and confess that they believe that
[1:01:28] name of jesus christ right to be
[1:01:30] baptized in but our organization will
[1:01:32] put us out you poor excuse he said take
[1:01:35] saul amma off he said give me the power
[1:01:38] and the strength of the holy spirit god
[1:01:41] send me with a slingshot no matter what
[1:01:43] it is how little um beat the enemy down
[1:01:46] david said this thing don't look right
[1:01:49] and you talk about the lion and the beer
[1:01:51] he said that's what the matter today god
[1:01:54] has got a lot of sheep that's gone
[1:01:55] astray the organization has stole them
[1:01:58] out and brought them into psychology
[1:02:02] god give us david's that's where the
[1:02:04] fight will come in god give us what
[1:02:06] david's oh hallelujah hallelujah god
[1:02:10] give us david's with the word of god and
[1:02:13] the power of god to direct it where
[1:02:15] we're going to meet these intellectual
[1:02:17] giants with all the phd and lld or give
[1:02:21] the lord a shout from 1965 to no them
[1:02:25] giants well big they grow real tall
[1:02:27] they're real big real organized but god
[1:02:30] give us some david i am telling you
[1:02:32] david ministry is going to be coming on
[1:02:34] the scene a fifo ministry ordained and
[1:02:38] anointed and appointed by god whom i
[1:02:40] hear them
[1:02:41] he said watch you say god give us
[1:02:44] david's plural with the word not not idi
[1:02:48] david's
[1:02:50] another one-man show david's okay with
[1:02:53] the word of god and the power of god to
[1:02:56] direct it when we go to meet these
[1:02:59] intellectual giants with all the phd
[1:03:01] whatever it might be
[1:03:02] give me the word of god
[1:03:04] and the power of the holy ghost and i
[1:03:07] tell you we can slay every giant on the
[1:03:10] field
[1:03:11] oh glory to god hallelujah we're not
[1:03:13] talking about local giants we're talking
[1:03:15] about giants on the field men who have
[1:03:17] influence and power over believers
[1:03:20] over bright churches because listen
[1:03:22] these spiritual man these guys
[1:03:25] they could control church but they can't
[1:03:27] control bride because christ is the head
[1:03:29] of the body called the church oh
[1:03:31] hallelujah david
[1:03:34] was the poorest excuse there was on the
[1:03:36] field to go fight with a giant he didn't
[1:03:38] have any of these big intellectual
[1:03:39] degrees he wasn't well trained praise
[1:03:42] god saul he was the best he had
[1:03:46] shoulders above the army he was the one
[1:03:48] auto went and fought him but he was
[1:03:50] scared and today we know we need a
[1:03:52] revival or or we know we need a stirring
[1:03:56] amongst the people it will not take a
[1:03:59] doctor of divinity it will take a
[1:04:00] weakling you say hallelujah that will
[1:04:02] take the word of god in the power of the
[1:04:05] resurrection of christ and say the thing
[1:04:07] it will bring christ to the country and
[1:04:09] let them see he can still open the blind
[1:04:12] eyes he can still heal the sick he can
[1:04:14] still raise the dead he is god he's a
[1:04:17] conqueror
[1:04:18] we need a david untrained in theological
[1:04:21] schools we need a man who knows nothing
[1:04:24] about that some little blowboy
[1:04:27] something somewhere
[1:04:28] stooped with stupid shoulders not much
[1:04:30] to look at will come walking down the
[1:04:32] road with the power of god you see a
[1:04:35] young man a man a god a minister a
[1:04:37] servant of god walking down with the
[1:04:39] power of god will embarrass all these
[1:04:40] intellectual slick talking preachers
[1:04:43] hallelujah the bible call them line and
[1:04:45] wait to deceive with the slayer of hand
[1:04:47] just doing tricks making you see
[1:04:50] what they want you to see
[1:04:52] not what god's saying you know not the
[1:04:53] vision you know they want you to see
[1:04:55] what they want you to see oh praise the
[1:04:57] name of the lord but abraham
[1:04:59] he said now watch
[1:05:01] no support of denomination no support of
[1:05:03] eclassical set up but in simplicity and
[1:05:06] the power of the holy spirit i fell on
[1:05:07] pentecost watch you say you won't be
[1:05:09] honest i played a bunch of these diction
[1:05:11] illusions which i call it two in a row
[1:05:13] but brother you'll have something in
[1:05:14] your hand as long as the spirit of god
[1:05:18] will get into that word it will conquer
[1:05:20] and bring back them lord sheep that gone
[1:05:22] astray oh my amen confess our weakness
[1:05:26] throw off your doctor of divinity show
[1:05:29] off your knew it all your membership
[1:05:30] strip yourself before god spiritually
[1:05:33] speaking and call yourself unworthy
[1:05:35] then god can go to using you
[1:05:37] and don't see it from your mouth bring
[1:05:39] it from your heart strip yourself
[1:05:41] unworthy
[1:05:42] call yourself unworthy no they call
[1:05:44] himself the holy ghost the bible say you
[1:05:45] are the temple of the holy ghost a man
[1:05:47] conquered a revelation you are the holy
[1:05:48] ghost a lion spirit
[1:05:51] doctrines of devils and people believe
[1:05:53] that foolishness
[1:05:54] literally believe that the words they
[1:05:56] receive in the holy ghost they are the
[1:05:58] holy ghost now they have not even cry
[1:05:59] for the holy ghost because they are that
[1:06:03] deceived
[1:06:05] mine
[1:06:07] so david that the strip themselves he
[1:06:10] was among the weakest among the whole
[1:06:11] crowd think of it
[1:06:12] tens of thousands of hundreds of
[1:06:15] thousands of soldiers on the hill all of
[1:06:17] them trained every one of them with a
[1:06:18] phd every one of them with spears they
[1:06:21] were soldiers each one of them corporal
[1:06:23] so and so private so and so private
[1:06:25] general so and so luton and so on so i'm
[1:06:28] still reading great foster general saul
[1:06:30] bishop your honor sir every one of them
[1:06:32] standing there train men
[1:06:34] and the enemies tying a fixer saying you
[1:06:36] bunch of cowards
[1:06:39] up in the camp come a little shoulder oh
[1:06:41] god
[1:06:42] like a ruddy looking fellow little
[1:06:44] slingshot over his back with a reason
[1:06:46] tying his hand from here for his brother
[1:06:48] and that giant come down and make her
[1:06:49] cry once too often and said you mean to
[1:06:52] tell me you bunch of trained soldiers
[1:06:54] will stand there and let that
[1:06:56] uncircumcised defy the army of the word
[1:06:59] of the living god are you afraid of him
[1:07:02] what was it david was the most annoying
[1:07:04] of the bunch no school of fighting
[1:07:07] nothing like that at all but he trusted
[1:07:10] god his faith was in god he says satan
[1:07:14] has his intellectual giants you remember
[1:07:16] they said there were giants in atlanta
[1:07:18] and them these giants he still has them
[1:07:20] intellectual giants isn't that right
[1:07:22] intellectual giants come are wrong to
[1:07:24] prove that all they shouted saying amen
[1:07:26] going to the altar breaking up for your
[1:07:28] sins that is just emotion that's an
[1:07:31] intellectual giant they want to worship
[1:07:33] they don't want to shout they don't want
[1:07:35] to alter call they want people to just
[1:07:37] raise their hand and stick their hand
[1:07:38] down like that but we want the old time
[1:07:40] singing old times shouting old time
[1:07:42] preaching oh give the lord some praises
[1:07:44] hallelujah glory i could hear murder he

[1:08:58] be able to explain
[1:09:00] by their wisdom he called it powers of
[1:09:03] satan peter said they're like a roaring
[1:09:06] lion devouring what we will now i'm not
[1:09:08] talking about outside them in this
[1:09:09] message
[1:09:10] i'm not talking about people outside

[1:10:24] object is to get not god wit
[1:10:27] not god above or wit but god in

[1:10:38] that in the last days will come
[1:10:39] intellectual giants they will come
[1:10:41] everything intellectual all kinds of
[1:10:44] reasoning
[1:10:45] god packed in the baptism of the holy
[1:10:48] ghost with what speaking with tongues
[1:10:51] interpretation of tongues prophecies
[1:10:53] gifts all kind of things they may seem
[1:10:56] hard in training but brother on the
[1:10:58] battlefront every one of them has got to
[1:11:01] be used
[1:11:03] so it can't be the preacher only
[1:11:05] it cannot be the pulpit only it has to
[1:11:08] be the tongues interpretation of tongues
[1:11:10] prophecy gifts are healing every gift
[1:11:12] you want your eyes your nose your toes
[1:11:14] you want all part of your body
[1:11:16] oh give the lord some praises hallelujah
[1:11:19] glory to god god equipping soul is
[1:11:21] exactly what it takes to use
[1:11:23] one they might say just learn psychology
[1:11:25] that won't work that's as thin as i
[1:11:27] brought made up of the shadow of a
[1:11:29] chicken that starts to death that's no
[1:11:30] good we have to have power of the holy
[1:11:33] ghost coming upon a man with all the
[1:11:35] nine spiritual gifts dwelling in him you
[1:11:37] say i just don't like to get out i don't
[1:11:40] like to pray all night i don't like well
[1:11:41] then you're going to get killed in the
[1:11:43] battlefront you stay there till god
[1:11:46] equips you with the baptism of the
[1:11:48] spirit then everything you've got need
[1:11:50] of in this world or the world to come
[1:11:53] lives right in you that's why jesus said
[1:11:56] behold the kingdom is within you oh
[1:11:58] glory to god and by further revelation
[1:12:00] the prophet identified the kingdom is
[1:12:02] the word made spirit and power in your
[1:12:05] life he said the words that i speak they
[1:12:07] are spirit and they are life oh give the
[1:12:10] lord some praises do we have some
[1:12:11] shelters in the house this morning

[1:12:21] hear you what side you're on whose side
[1:12:23] you're on oh my the all-wise god
[1:12:27] knowed how to equip his army he equipped
[1:12:30] with the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:12:31] that's exactly what he sent these in
[1:12:33] last days he knew we would have to have
[1:12:35] it
[1:12:38] are you ready here's why hear the bomb
[1:12:40] he knew
[1:12:42] we would have to have it
[1:12:43] he knew that people would reason
[1:12:46] would go to reading this word when it
[1:12:49] become in print out here
[1:12:52] what would happen
[1:12:53] so this wise god
[1:12:55] know that in his last days
[1:12:57] the word will get in print
[1:12:59] where people could read and reason
[1:13:02] reason and read
[1:13:03] read and reason
[1:13:05] that is why i have so much uh a a way
[1:13:07] called disinformation now
[1:13:09] people want to say things contrary
[1:13:12] all kind of foolishness on the internet
[1:13:14] because listening or hearing
[1:13:16] some rasta profit from jamaica and
[1:13:18] sometimes some mountain and a bunch of
[1:13:20] people up there mountain they say he was
[1:13:21] interviewed by bbc and and so on like

[1:13:49] you doing mother's body he can't come
[1:13:51] now an earth he's a disbodied embodied
[1:13:53] spirit oh glory looking for bodies to
[1:13:55] use the bible said
[1:13:57] except god shortened the the time or no
[1:14:00] flesh shall be saved because the
[1:14:02] supernatural running around punt oh
[1:14:03] glory to god the earth was blacked out
[1:14:06] the holy spirit droid blacked out and
[1:14:08] put around and put a little sliver of
[1:14:09] light to represent you and i oh we
[1:14:11] should be praising and thanking god
[1:14:13] organized conspiracy theories all kind
[1:14:15] of nonsense we're not here to preach
[1:14:17] that we have a preacher solid word solid
[1:14:19] promises by these promises you can
[1:14:22] become partaker of his divine nature or
[1:14:24] give the lord some praises hallelujah
[1:14:27] praise god praise god praise god so
[1:14:29] don't fight any vaccine them them upon a
[1:14:31] mountain after eating jar food eaten
[1:14:33] eaten italian food
[1:14:35] oh hallelujah praise god amen they
[1:14:39] feeling like the escape ones on the
[1:14:40] mountain up there oh
[1:14:42] so the otherwise god
[1:14:44] knowing how to equip
[1:14:46] the people with the the equip them with
[1:14:48] the battle he goes that's exactly he
[1:14:50] knew we would have to have it why he
[1:14:53] knew that people would reason they would
[1:14:55] go to reading this word when it come out
[1:14:58] in print
[1:14:59] then whether they print you could twist
[1:15:01] it
[1:15:02] remember peter and them didn't have it
[1:15:03] in print you know
[1:15:05] peter them had old testament scripture
[1:15:07] but the new testament they were the
[1:15:08] living word what was their spoke common
[1:15:11] print
[1:15:12] but they had nothing to print to make a
[1:15:14] record as such they actually manifested
[1:15:17] and produced another book of acts which
[1:15:19] become our record
[1:15:21] oh give the lord some shout booker peter
[1:15:24] book of philippians book of romans holla
[1:15:27] book of corinthians that become the new
[1:15:29] testament by men that was living so you
[1:15:32] had to actually take these men as living
[1:15:34] word speak in the word of god that's why
[1:15:36] paul could say if i
[1:15:40] preach some other gospel when i first
[1:15:42] preached that may be a curse
[1:15:44] oh if an angel come from heaven
[1:15:45] preaching in the gospel so today there's
[1:15:47] intellectual giants there's men who are
[1:15:49] great men
[1:15:50] great powerful men
[1:15:52] they could set everything together so
[1:15:54] intellectual but where is that revival
[1:15:56] where is that god that burns on the
[1:15:59] heart of the human being it takes
[1:16:01] simplicity to bring the power of god
[1:16:05] that's a good one it takes what
[1:16:07] simplicity to put the bring the power of
[1:16:09] god he said it takes the simplicity of
[1:16:12] believing god to make his word speak out
[1:16:14] to show that jesus christ is the same
[1:16:17] yesterday today and forever it takes a
[1:16:18] humble act dedicated to god to bring
[1:16:21] jesus christ in the present tense oh
[1:16:24] glory to god hallelujah you want to see
[1:16:27] jesus it takes a certain heart a humble
[1:16:29] heart dedicated to god to bring jesus
[1:16:31] christ in the present tense it's not my
[1:16:32] mind it does not take knowledge
[1:16:35] it he said it it does not take knowledge
[1:16:37] it's not my power it's not by might but
[1:16:40] it's by my spirits here the lord i'll
[1:16:42] unfold this mystery and we will cry to
[1:16:45] it grace grace with shoutings oh blessed
[1:16:47] be the name of the lord hallelujah so
[1:16:50] jesus had proven that he was the right
[1:16:52] kind of son so cody just take jesus for
[1:16:55] granted he was he had to prove he was
[1:16:56] the right kind of a son and you know he
[1:16:59] was adopted and he said they said that's
[1:17:00] the thing that god will do for his sons
[1:17:02] here on earth someday he will call you a
[1:17:04] side church if you'll only obey him and
[1:17:07] stay on the word and believe it he will
[1:17:09] place into the church
[1:17:11] he will place where into the church
[1:17:14] before the coming of jesus christ he
[1:17:17] replaced into the church
[1:17:19] all the powers that christ had in him
[1:17:22] will be in the church all that god was
[1:17:25] he poured into jesus all that jesus was
[1:17:28] he pours into the church god wanted his
[1:17:30] work done he sent it into his son his
[1:17:32] son wanted the work done he sent us into
[1:17:34] the church at that day you shall know i
[1:17:36] am in the father the father me and you
[1:17:38] and you and me at that day because the
[1:17:40] same power here we go that was in
[1:17:42] jehovah god rested in jesus christ and
[1:17:45] the same power that resident jesus
[1:17:47] christ rest in placed
[1:17:50] sons
[1:17:52] in the body of christ and that is why i
[1:17:54] say the true anointed
[1:17:56] comfort yet because it take dynamics to
[1:17:59] push them forward or let me rephrase
[1:18:02] that it will take a manifestation to
[1:18:04] push them forward or give the lord some
[1:18:06] praises
[1:18:07] understand this
[1:18:09] if david had wear
[1:18:12] uh
[1:18:13] the army
[1:18:15] saul and them armor
[1:18:16] he is just like your sediment
[1:18:19] where any amman defeated
[1:18:21] when the armor all of my name all of my
[1:18:23] spear and shield helmets and whatnot he
[1:18:25] can't go like that they have all the
[1:18:27] armor they have all this stuff and
[1:18:28] they're still defeated the cafe is going
[1:18:31] so david have to show
[1:18:33] him have something different
[1:18:35] he has faith in god
[1:18:37] he said god will deliver you into my
[1:18:39] hands glad prophecy i'll feed her to the
[1:18:41] birds and wherever it is and david
[1:18:42] probably said right back here back down
[1:18:44] you know you probably said take your
[1:18:45] head off today you are mines
[1:18:47] hallelujah you are living here alive
[1:18:50] oh glory to god i did limit you that's
[1:18:53] the fight for ministry david ministry
[1:18:55] going to step forward what kind of
[1:18:57] measure is that fearless
[1:18:59] anointed
[1:19:00] hallelujah met god on the backside it
[1:19:03] takes a manifestation to push david
[1:19:05] forward how else could they ever be
[1:19:06] recognized
[1:19:07] except god prepared the environment for
[1:19:09] david to step forward
[1:19:11] the beer
[1:19:12] the lion that was backside of the desert
[1:19:15] experience the anointing upon him is
[1:19:17] only his brothers were witness to that
[1:19:19] all that is in the god's private
[1:19:21] dressing room but you see when god
[1:19:22] created the environment for david to
[1:19:25] step forward to deal with goliath that
[1:19:26] was public there's a public show there's
[1:19:29] a public ministry to identify this is my
[1:19:32] son he's anointed he is commissioned he
[1:19:35] is dealing with intellectual giants on
[1:19:37] the field or give the lord some praises
[1:19:39] this is the fight for ministry of tight
[1:19:41] hell not grumbling behind some pulpit
[1:19:43] and throwing on this brother and
[1:19:44] training on that church that not that
[1:19:46] there are no fighter ministry hallelujah
[1:19:47] this is what we're talking about here
[1:19:49] david's ministry oh do you love him this
[1:19:51] morning glory to god so brother brahm
[1:19:54] says here watch
[1:19:56] so watch the same power that rested in
[1:19:58] jesus christ rest and place sons in the
[1:20:01] body of christ placing of a son take him
[1:20:04] out to a certain place he's explaining
[1:20:05] it i don't need a deeper explanation
[1:20:07] than that take him out to a certain
[1:20:09] place have a ceremony before angels
[1:20:11] place him positionally in the body of
[1:20:14] christ then that person has the
[1:20:16] authority let me say this if you caught
[1:20:19] me a fanatic from this night on that's
[1:20:21] the very same thing that i'm speaking of
[1:20:23] will be done there will be a power put
[1:20:26] into the church and now coming in
[1:20:28] noticing you talk about the mystery
[1:20:29] talking mystery revealing mystery
[1:20:31] unfolding he said there's a power coming
[1:20:34] into the church and now it's coming in
[1:20:36] that the holy spirit not some man some
[1:20:39] message man some fightful man some only
[1:20:41] man know that the holy spirit will so
[1:20:44] anoint the people till they will speak
[1:20:46] the word it will create ourselves right
[1:20:48] there we haven't seen powers yet it is
[1:20:50] coming into the church now i know it for
[1:20:53] as a fact hallelujah see that means god
[1:20:56] gave him vision he knows as a fact it's
[1:20:57] solidified say unto this mountain don't
[1:21:00] talk in your heart but believe that what
[1:21:02] you said shall come to pass you can have
[1:21:03] what you said the placing of the church
[1:21:06] in position where the fullness of the
[1:21:09] power of the holy ghost comes into the
[1:21:12] church then the critics mouth will be
[1:21:14] shot so right now let them talk let them
[1:21:17] pray let them brag let them boast let
[1:21:20] them laugh that's okay here's the
[1:21:22] promise here that the fullness of the
[1:21:24] power of the holy ghost comes into the
[1:21:26] church then the critic's mouth will be
[1:21:28] shut there will be a short time jesus
[1:21:30] come right off the mountain straight to
[1:21:31] calvary but it won't last long but it
[1:21:33] will be here what a prophecy but anthony
[1:21:36] he said it won't last long but it will
[1:21:37] be here so let them laugh let them mock
[1:21:40] let them scoff let them say be crazy but
[1:21:43] i know the critics mouth will be shut
[1:21:45] you notice when david you lose that
[1:21:47] stone my goddamn other philistines they
[1:21:50] begin to run they fled oh glory to god
[1:21:53] hallelujah david drop that sword on the
[1:21:55] light head and then guys have to take
[1:21:57] off and when god becomes anointed david
[1:22:00] ministry the fightful ministry they're
[1:22:03] gonna lie at them philistine go run oh
[1:22:05] glory to god they're gonna run all over
[1:22:07] the country they're gonna be running
[1:22:08] because god will identify david's
[1:22:10] ministry fight for ministry oh
[1:22:13] hallelujah
[1:22:16] oh
[1:22:17] critics mug will be shot not now let
[1:22:19] them criticize they're supposed to
[1:22:21] criticize
[1:22:22] hallelujah
[1:22:24] but abraham says there are so many
[1:22:26] voices in the earth today that is
[1:22:28] absolutely a heart thing to hear the
[1:22:29] voice of god because there's
[1:22:31] the death is the voice of the
[1:22:32] supernatural there are so many
[1:22:34] intellectual voices great voices of
[1:22:36] mighty men now they are mighty men you
[1:22:38] know
[1:22:39] mighty men who are intellectual
[1:22:41] and in the intellectual condition
[1:22:43] they're shaking nations
[1:22:45] we just they had knowledge
[1:22:47] nation shook ministers shook churches
[1:22:50] shook because nobody knew it like them
[1:22:52] nobody could explain like them nobody
[1:22:54] could show it repeatedly like them
[1:22:56] they're shaken up nation without power
[1:22:59] shaking a nation without spirit that's
[1:23:00] the head at work
[1:23:02] anointed grey mata
[1:23:04] they are not overnight people
[1:23:07] but they shake nations
[1:23:08] bringing great organization together
[1:23:11] great campaign flourish and a person
[1:23:14] would be a bit confused
[1:23:15] it's enough to confuse them on how
[1:23:18] these things could go on and prosper
[1:23:21] and there are voices that are raised up
[1:23:22] that do these things and it causes the
[1:23:26] voice of god to be placed way back
[1:23:27] somewhere
[1:23:29] and i realize forget these guys to be
[1:23:31] effective deceiver they have to
[1:23:33] disconnect the people from the prophet
[1:23:35] clicks
[1:23:36] pull the plug on the prophet and then it
[1:23:38] gets focused on them
[1:23:40] oh hallelujah
[1:23:42] oh my
[1:23:43] i'll say this we have an android phone
[1:23:46] samsung right and that operating system
[1:23:48] is android but sometimes have a skin
[1:23:51] over it
[1:23:52] that that that is the that the ui
[1:23:55] the graphical surface over it all the
[1:23:57] other companies would have android the
[1:23:59] source is the android but they could put
[1:24:01] things over it so you see now our source
[1:24:04] is the bible
[1:24:06] that is the source code that's the
[1:24:08] original source that but
[1:24:10] could read the scripture the spirit of
[1:24:12] the prophet is subject to the prophets
[1:24:13] and after that scripture he could unfold
[1:24:15] church order
[1:24:16] because that is the key
[1:24:18] that is his source so every time he's
[1:24:20] called a scripture he's a mystery
[1:24:22] scripture so mystery is not just mystery
[1:24:24] a mystery is scripture a previously
[1:24:27] divinely hidden truth naughty finally
[1:24:29] reveal
[1:24:30] but with it leave a supernatural amen
[1:24:32] atmosphere around it and something like
[1:24:33] that isn't that right so every word that
[1:24:36] was revealed he had was to come from the
[1:24:38] scripture that when the angel came to
[1:24:40] him to open the seals he compared what
[1:24:42] the angel was telling him with the
[1:24:44] scripture
[1:24:45] i'm not saying there is no angel it's
[1:24:47] half angels talking to guys but it's
[1:24:49] what them saying if it's in the
[1:24:50] scripture so you have to able to match
[1:24:53] it up so i don't want to hear what bill
[1:24:55] gates saying about the population that
[1:24:56] is not my gospel i don't hear what this
[1:24:58] one's saying and that one's saying i'm
[1:25:00] not reading what them saying i want to
[1:25:02] know what the bible say in the last day
[1:25:04] be a super church that's what i know
[1:25:06] the people that know their god shall do
[1:25:07] great exploits that's what i know i have
[1:25:09] nothing with deep population and the
[1:25:10] vaccine and the vaccine and vaccine like
[1:25:12] foolishness like destruction
[1:25:15] they're so foolish all the time people
[1:25:16] die in a courier virus now the vaccine
[1:25:18] is the issue
[1:25:19] faction is mark the beast and the
[1:25:21] prophet said right now you're being
[1:25:22] mocked your judgment is later on
[1:25:24] and that he said that before that
[1:25:26] vaccine
[1:25:27] hallelujah ezekiel 9
[1:25:30] cry and say
[1:25:32] seal those who ate take the vaccine
[1:25:34] that's the bible
[1:25:35] the scripture for that
[1:25:37] think about it now what the bible
[1:25:53] checking you already by the word
[1:25:54] oh my hallelujah
[1:25:56] but i'm talking about this now he said
[1:25:58] i'm the voice of god so he's prophesying
[1:26:01] they say how will we know is the voice
[1:26:02] of god so he's prophesying for our time
[1:26:05] when we would ask the question oh we
[1:26:07] will know is the voice of god he said
[1:26:08] because for today then it was a
[1:26:11] vindicated prophet talking about himself
[1:26:13] all right now today how we know is the
[1:26:16] voice of god because
[1:26:18] it will be a manifestation of the
[1:26:20] prophet's word
[1:26:21] this is god's prophet and a true voice
[1:26:24] of god only brings back brings back
[1:26:27] that real living supernatural god with a
[1:26:31] supernatural word with a supernatural
[1:26:33] manifestation of the true word
[1:26:35] oh my so i'm going to conclude with
[1:26:37] david here now
[1:26:38] david's ministry
[1:26:40] is to check the intellectual giants on
[1:26:43] the field by and with the power of god
[1:26:47] that's the fifo ministry to the bride
[1:26:49] body around the world
[1:26:51] so them giants they wouldn't escape
[1:26:54] no no no no they wouldn't escape god
[1:26:56] have david in type
[1:26:58] to show how they will be handled
[1:27:00] hallelujah it wouldn't be court versus
[1:27:02] quote it wouldn't be expedition versus
[1:27:05] explanation it wouldn't be debate versus
[1:27:07] debate this won't be an online debate
[1:27:09] and an online question and answer
[1:27:10] situation this is not that
[1:27:12] david ministry is the power of god the
[1:27:15] spirit of god oh god upon a true
[1:27:17] fightful ministry to deal with them with
[1:27:19] the electoral giants with power
[1:27:21] oh my
[1:27:22] then we come now to joshua ministry
[1:27:25] oh hallelujah
[1:27:26] oh do you love him this morning
[1:27:29] glory to god i've shown you the fight
[1:27:30] for ministry and types
[1:27:32] joshua now after the other moses servant
[1:27:35] of god read the scripture go tell joshua
[1:27:37] the moses is dead all right let's go
[1:27:40] over this jordan don't want all these
[1:27:41] people into the land which god gave to
[1:27:43] them every place if your foot should i
[1:27:45] try to point that out of him to you now
[1:27:47] remember this god is talking loud
[1:27:49] speaker
[1:27:51] they know the lord speaker god talking
[1:27:52] you know god shouting joshua
[1:27:55] and everybody hearing that that god
[1:27:56] telling that no god tend not to judgment
[1:27:58] the people hear that
[1:28:00] that's not the voice for the people
[1:28:02] that's the voice for joshua so he had to
[1:28:04] obey god right
[1:28:06] there shall not be any man so he
[1:28:07] described from the river river euphrates
[1:28:10] and so on like that and the wilderness
[1:28:12] going on to the sea shop your coast
[1:28:14] there shall not be any man be able to
[1:28:15] stand before thee always of thy life as
[1:28:17] i was with moses so i will be with thee
[1:28:20] i will not fail thee nor forsake thee
[1:28:24] thy quarterly joshua
[1:28:26] the people don't know nothing about that
[1:28:28] the people just watching joshua they
[1:28:30] don't know as god was with moses he is
[1:28:33] now with joshua they don't know that
[1:28:35] they have no revelation of that
[1:28:37] all they know is this man that was moses
[1:28:39] minister is now stepping forward
[1:28:42] to lead us
[1:28:45] that's all they know so he's an unknown
[1:28:47] yet known just as moses minister he's no
[1:28:50] prophet he ain't no preacher thing he's
[1:28:52] just moses minister he's dead with moses
[1:28:54] everybody joshua look moses
[1:28:57] all right
[1:28:59] he told him mate in the world there
[1:29:00] night so but abram says hear this now
[1:29:02] here we go
[1:29:03] and there's a great lot of types we
[1:29:04] could go into we'll bypass some of them
[1:29:07] for instance like moses brought the
[1:29:09] church up to sinai to their theology of
[1:29:11] last night moses was not permitted to
[1:29:13] take the turn over into the promised
[1:29:15] land because he had failed
[1:29:18] so barbara is preaching
[1:29:20] and

[1:35:29] taking place
[1:35:30] there was esau
[1:35:32] moab
[1:35:34] he said no brother the real church of
[1:35:36] god has got no forms no creeds led by
[1:35:40] the power of god in every individual
[1:35:43] heart
[1:35:44] passed by your brethren his brethren
[1:35:46] don't fuss at them we are greater than
[1:35:48] they don't fuss at them
[1:35:50] just go by
[1:35:52] he said watch he said many of those
[1:35:54] people are actually borderline believers
[1:35:57] justification left egypt sanctification
[1:36:00] praise god he said but the third stage
[1:36:02] was when they crossed jordan
[1:36:04] into the promised land where the
[1:36:06] inheritance laid what you lutheran
[1:36:08] believe in justification and you met
[1:36:10] this nazarene's church at god believe in
[1:36:12] signification killing of the evil that's
[1:36:14] in you taking all the root of evil
[1:36:16] belongs
[1:36:18] right but to you men and women there is
[1:36:20] something in you calling you out the
[1:36:22] deep to the deep there's a jordan yet
[1:36:25] across
[1:36:26] a land beyond the river oh my
[1:36:29] he said you're going to pass by your
[1:36:31] bridge and i started your journey right
[1:36:34] you're going to pass by your brethren
[1:36:35] and they're near the borderline no if
[1:36:37] you're passed by them don't say nothing
[1:36:39] to them i have given the east of this
[1:36:41] mountain i've given more of this country
[1:36:43] i know why you're fussing at them press
[1:36:45] the lighting
[1:36:47] oh god
[1:36:50] hallelujah don't push the light you'll
[1:36:52] get more bodies
[1:36:54] and you'll get your children
[1:36:57] just move gently you know where you're
[1:37:00] going don't take up the habits
[1:37:03] oh i'm going to skip down we'll leave
[1:37:05] bill i'm alone and then fellas some
[1:37:07] other time tell him guys he said if all
[1:37:09] your deep you've got have been satisfied
[1:37:11] stay where you are
[1:37:12] but for me and my house for me there is
[1:37:15] something more than we have seen
[1:37:17] there's a land beyond the river
[1:37:18] somewhere they said a deep calling to
[1:37:21] the deep i cannot be satisfied with
[1:37:23] theology i cannot be satisfied with a
[1:37:25] good church i cannot decide with a good
[1:37:27] campaign i cannot be sized with a
[1:37:30] healing service there is something
[1:37:31] beyond that that calling oh man
[1:37:35] i've given esau this mountain don't
[1:37:36] touch him i've got something different
[1:37:38] for you
[1:37:39] cross over
[1:37:40] praise god are you ready
[1:37:42] let everything go wrong
[1:37:45] let everybody else prosper
[1:37:47] let errors prosper
[1:37:49] let the men who have a former godliness
[1:37:51] deny the power of prosper
[1:37:53] show view back
[1:37:55] but if you know where you stand you
[1:37:57] withstand
[1:37:58] regardless if the whole world turns you
[1:38:01] down you will not vary from that word
[1:38:05] my
[1:38:06] hallelujah
[1:38:08] oh thank you lord jesus
[1:38:10] brother branham
[1:38:11] praise god
[1:38:13] this is from paradox you see what coming
[1:38:15] down to the jordan meant
[1:38:16] we are done here now
[1:38:18] let's cross over now
[1:38:20] let's quit playing
[1:38:21] let's cross the other side now
[1:38:23] because it all belongs to us it's all
[1:38:25] ours then visions has never failed they
[1:38:28] can't fail because they come from god
[1:38:31] i believe it with all that is within me
[1:38:33] we are not the howling that would run
[1:38:35] back into the wilderness we will cross
[1:38:38] jordan the separation god
[1:38:40] break to us the seals that's on the back
[1:38:43] of the book
[1:38:44] in other words break to us them seven
[1:38:46] thunders on the back of the book let us
[1:38:48] enter into that great place now for
[1:38:50] joshua they violated the people the
[1:38:51] inheritance
[1:38:52] that god had left for them
[1:38:54] now the commission that joshua was
[1:38:55] threefold we know it cross over
[1:38:58] fight and conquer and then divine
[1:39:01] you cannot divide what you have not
[1:39:02] conquered
[1:39:04] and you cannot conquer if you don't
[1:39:05] confront
[1:39:09] let me say it again you cannot divide
[1:39:12] what you have not conquered
[1:39:14] and you cannot conquer what you're not
[1:39:15] prepared to confront
[1:39:17] and it's interesting how god put jericho
[1:39:20] just right in front of joshua the first
[1:39:22] thing the hardest thing jericho and when
[1:39:25] they could conquer jericho you could
[1:39:26] conquer anything and god showing not by
[1:39:29] might not by power but by the captain
[1:39:30] the captain of the host that follow
[1:39:33] instructions obedience come on now come
[1:39:35] on now oh glory to god tested on
[1:39:38] obedience and then you get the victory
[1:39:40] on the obedience all right but abraham
[1:39:43] said this now
[1:39:44] hallelujah
[1:39:46] we cannot have a revival
[1:39:49] until we got men
[1:39:51] god called men
[1:39:53] so you know how blast men are blast
[1:39:54] number six had to say them hard
[1:39:57] because i
[1:39:58] i got
[1:40:00] terribly uh was a terrible experience in
[1:40:02] my early years in this message in
[1:40:03] trinidad to see men manipulate people's
[1:40:05] lives i hated it if you're spitting all
[1:40:08] the color you spit you want a little
[1:40:10] house to buy what car to buy where to go
[1:40:12] go to school not to go to school don't
[1:40:13] do this all control
[1:40:16] many of them have destroyed life and
[1:40:17] never even repented of it
[1:40:20] that's right
[1:40:22] take people out of the school
[1:40:25] affect people's careers
[1:40:26] people's future and life and family and
[1:40:29] everything else
[1:40:30] yeah
[1:40:32] i rejected all of that
[1:40:34] yeah one time i i go to the same attila
[1:40:39] when he said pretty pants
[1:40:41] because i thought that is what you're
[1:40:42] supposed to wear
[1:40:43] i
[1:40:44] buy wool pants and all because people
[1:40:46] buying wool until the ants bite holes
[1:40:48] inside the pants
[1:40:49] i recognize them through that here you
[1:40:51] don't need that kind of pants until i
[1:40:53] change my tailor and all i want when
[1:40:54] actually telling them
[1:40:56] because i wasn't wearing any pants like
[1:40:58] he's like
[1:40:59] by the pants you shall know them
[1:41:02] those with the deeds
[1:41:05] i was a radical
[1:41:07] i want to look like this
[1:41:10] hallelujah
[1:41:12] you say become a revival until we get
[1:41:14] men god called men
[1:41:16] one two god trained men that is not
[1:41:20] trained up in the school of theology and
[1:41:22] education but rocket men of faith
[1:41:25] and god has brought up in the school of
[1:41:27] his rugged training men who are not
[1:41:29] afraid to face the fire
[1:41:31] men who has come into the presence of
[1:41:34] god that knows this power that knows his
[1:41:37] omnipotence that knows his healing power
[1:41:39] some men are trained out to know the
[1:41:40] living god it's all right they're
[1:41:42] trained by the word but they let her
[1:41:43] kill it
[1:41:44] but the spirit gave it life
[1:41:47] and before we can have this revival god
[1:41:49] has to call out men and train men god
[1:41:51] trained men to carry this message they
[1:41:52] don't care what the opposition is
[1:41:54] they're willing to go to the fiery
[1:41:55] furnace and defeat to the alliance then
[1:41:57] whatever maybe they're ready to go
[1:41:59] because they have been in the presence
[1:42:00] of god and know that he is whether the
[1:42:02] victory or defeat they still stand the
[1:42:04] same that's the kind of training god
[1:42:06] does
[1:42:07] to men it's very strange to think that
[1:42:10] god would do that that god trains men
[1:42:12] like that but he does god leads his
[1:42:14] people to great trials to purge them
[1:42:18] to what you know these criminal viruses
[1:42:20] are pushed into
[1:42:23] yeah
[1:42:24] it's bringing out what people
[1:42:26] it's bringing believe
[1:42:27] what in people's heart
[1:42:29] and i recognize people don't believe
[1:42:30] this message you know they may mess it
[1:42:31] but they don't believe what braham says
[1:42:33] they believe what the pastor telling
[1:42:34] them
[1:42:35] and they said chicken
[1:42:37] is a man on board examining horns they
[1:42:39] check any horns
[1:42:41] hallelujah
[1:42:43] god leads people through great trials to
[1:42:45] purge them and sometimes it takes years
[1:42:48] to do that
[1:42:49] not months
[1:42:51] not weeks years
[1:42:52] as for myself tonight i believe that
[1:42:54] right now god is training such men to
[1:42:56] meet the front line who are going
[1:42:58] through time shook from their feet
[1:43:00] sometimes looked like the whole thing
[1:43:01] has fallen yet in the midst of it all
[1:43:03] they know the living god
[1:43:05] and keep their face forward
[1:43:07] and when usually when god about to do
[1:43:09] something in the supernatural realms he
[1:43:11] usually gets a man that he could put his
[1:43:13] trust in
[1:43:14] and anoints him and sends him out and he
[1:43:17] is fearless at the job
[1:43:19] that's the kind of man we need today
[1:43:22] not polish scholars but men who know god
[1:43:24] in the power of his resurrection
[1:43:26] oh it means have a scholarly knowledge
[1:43:29] and the power of actual knowledge that's
[1:43:30] right for instance there was a man in
[1:43:32] the bible by the name of moses who had
[1:43:34] got all his training he knew all the
[1:43:35] theology he knew everything he should
[1:43:37] know he would have needed an education
[1:43:39] he could teach the masters of israel in
[1:43:41] israel or egypt he didn't
[1:43:43] he didn't need one thing and the bible
[1:43:45] tell us that he was learned in all the
[1:43:47] wisdom of the egyptians why he could
[1:43:48] teach their scholars he could teach a
[1:43:50] scientist he had keyed up every point
[1:43:53] when it comes to intellectual
[1:43:55] and yet here we go it took 40 years
[1:43:58] to beat all of that out of him
[1:44:01] all day in the sands when he got all his
[1:44:04] intellectual conceptions of god
[1:44:06] beat out to him out in the sands the
[1:44:09] metal was ready to be moulded over and
[1:44:12] that's the way god takes his men beats
[1:44:15] out all their fears all the
[1:44:17] intellectuals and when the great master
[1:44:19] potter puts them on the wheel and begin
[1:44:21] to moan them over again workmen worthy
[1:44:24] is god's man who could train a man more
[1:44:27] than god himself watch the way he trains
[1:44:30] him oh my hallelujah praise god
[1:44:34] hallelujah i'll be coming to elisha
[1:44:37] hallelujah living in the pub with 12
[1:44:39] yuka oxen are you going to take your
[1:44:41] eyes off the plug it go go zigzag it go
[1:44:43] go so he had to keep his eye focused you
[1:44:45] got to keep his zero you can look back
[1:44:47] hallelujah when he when that elijah
[1:44:50] dropped demand on him and pull it off so
[1:44:52] he said wait wait i'm coming back he
[1:44:54] burned the auction he burned the whole
[1:44:56] thing he was single focused he said

[1:45:05] a manifested reality oh praise god amen
[1:45:08] isn't that right
[1:45:10] amen so you have to train some men
[1:45:12] afterwards keep them on the bible on the
[1:45:14] word lined up with the word say straight
[1:45:16] in line so god
[1:45:18] had to school him a little bit for
[1:45:20] elisha
[1:45:21] you tarry here for i'm going over to
[1:45:23] giga the lord has called me

[1:45:35] no that's that's that's good enough you
[1:45:37] owe me the confession that's good now
[1:45:39] watch that wouldn't be all right for any
[1:45:41] professor but you stay right here but
[1:45:43] listen elijah couldn't think that way
[1:45:45] you know he already felt the power of
[1:45:46] god see that's the problem
[1:45:48] people don't know god's power there's no
[1:45:50] going on presence they never encounter
[1:45:52] supernatural or the believers
[1:45:54] intellectually what they're hearing is
[1:45:55] the word
[1:45:56] they're sincere they're believers they
[1:45:58] believe the word but they never had a
[1:45:59] breakthrough experience like how moses
[1:46:02] had it oh like all the children of
[1:46:04] israel had it like all the people have
[1:46:06] in the ulysses had it rather say oh my
[1:46:08] he said let me tell you something now a
[1:46:10] man that ever tasted god will not be
[1:46:13] willing or cannot quench his taste at a
[1:46:16] man-made system he can't do it all the
[1:46:19] theology they had at the school of the
[1:46:21] prophets could not quench the taste of
[1:46:23] that man of god he had a taste for god
[1:46:25] and they kept persuading him you should
[1:46:27] stay here why in six weeks or just he
[1:46:30] said he said watch

[1:53:11] david's ministry
[1:53:13] joshua ministry
[1:53:14] elisha ministry david ministry dealing
[1:53:17] with the intellectual
[1:53:20] joshua ministry he calls jordan elijah
[1:53:22] ministry across jordan
[1:53:24] vote debt
[1:53:26] have to die
[1:53:28] let's let's listen to what the prophet
[1:53:30] said about this fight for ministry now
[1:53:32] lust for money
[1:53:33] lots of big things lust for popularity
[1:53:36] these things are dead to the believer he
[1:53:38] said we don't care a tent or cottage why
[1:53:40] should i care live or die sink or drown
[1:53:43] this is the thing that i'm interested in
[1:53:45] the kingdom of god whether i maintain my
[1:53:47] home whether i maintain my family
[1:53:49] whether i maintain whatever it is let me
[1:53:51] maintain christ our hope and glory
[1:53:54] and then he said this build me up oh
[1:53:56] lord into this
[1:53:58] let christ be my head
[1:54:01] that's working through me so this is
[1:54:03] ministry now okay
[1:54:04] on my foundation
[1:54:06] my fee that's in him led virtue
[1:54:09] knowledge
[1:54:10] temperance
[1:54:11] patience godliness brotherly kindness
[1:54:14] work in me oh lord is my prayer i don't
[1:54:17] care live or die sing or drunk
[1:54:19] denomination or no denomination friend

[1:54:24] christ's virtue
[1:54:27] his
[1:54:28] knowledge
[1:54:30] flow out
[1:54:31] that i might be able to teach those
[1:54:34] let christ's virtue
[1:54:37] his knowledge
[1:54:39] flew out
[1:54:41] so he's not talking about revelation
[1:54:42] here now he's talking about the actual
[1:54:45] possession
[1:54:46] and when we talk about virtue we're not
[1:54:48] talking about the text virtue or reading
[1:54:50] about virtue or using the word virtuous
[1:54:53] virtue we're talking about what left
[1:54:54] jesus when the woman where the blood is
[1:54:56] you touch him he said i felt virtue left
[1:54:59] me
[1:55:00] i don't know what you tired any pulpit i
[1:55:01] never remember that kind of vote you
[1:55:02] please no we're not talking about that
[1:55:04] you're wary and you're tired like what
[1:55:05] you like you i'm not talking about that
[1:55:06] not that kind of what you're talking
[1:55:08] about i'm talking about the virtue that
[1:55:09] heals the future that delivers the power
[1:55:12] oh glory to god that oozing out leaking
[1:55:14] out that man of god fifo minister it's
[1:55:18] going to be because there will be some
[1:55:20] adopted sons that's the fight for
[1:55:21] ministry you know the fight for
[1:55:23] ministries really adopted sons
[1:55:25] let me say it again the fifo ministry
[1:55:28] will be adopted sons because adopted
[1:55:30] sons will have the ministry of jesus
[1:55:32] christ oh glory to god
[1:55:35] for god has set in the church right
[1:55:37] after that he said let us work in me let
[1:55:39] christ virtue his knowledge flow out
[1:55:41] that i might be able to teach those for
[1:55:43] god are set in the church apostles
[1:55:45] prophets teachers pastors evangelists
[1:55:48] all

[1:55:57] the fighting church no but here yes all
[1:55:59] for the perfecting and bringing all
[1:56:02] these virtues into it
[1:56:05] oh that's different now that is more
[1:56:07] detailed of the job description
[1:56:09] not just perfecting not just preaching
[1:56:12] and teaching but bringing the virtues
[1:56:14] into it how do we do that
[1:56:16] by a text
[1:56:17] by a message
[1:56:19] we have to have that to impact that
[1:56:22] we have to have that in us to give out
[1:56:24] that
[1:56:27] all for the perfecting and bringing
[1:56:30] all these virtues into it for the
[1:56:32] perfection of the common son of god each
[1:56:35] one of these stones our material offered
[1:56:37] that one this is the material of this
[1:56:39] each one of those virtue belonging to
[1:56:40] him oh my oh blessed be the name of the
[1:56:43] lord o praise the name of the lord
[1:56:47] hallelujah all right are you ready
[1:56:50] we are done yet we're still in here
[1:56:52] we're still in the cockpit now what
[1:56:54] jesus said watch this now the works that
[1:56:55] i do he's doing them right now but obama
[1:56:58] is speaking the works that i'm doing now
[1:57:02] healing the sick
[1:57:04] raising the death
[1:57:05] open the eyes of the blind these works
[1:57:07] shall you do also
[1:57:09] you will do these if you believe in me
[1:57:11] you will do these works and then are
[1:57:13] greater than this shall you do for i go
[1:57:16] to my father
[1:57:17] little while the world will see me no
[1:57:18] more but you will see me i'll be with
[1:57:20] you even in you to the end of the world
[1:57:23] i would not leave you comfortable no
[1:57:24] notice here we go the greater works
[1:57:29] was to have the power in the church
[1:57:32] not only to heal the sick by prayer
[1:57:36] or cast castle devils by prayer
[1:57:39] but
[1:57:40] to impart
[1:57:42] eternal life to believers
[1:57:46] aha
[1:57:47] now this sticks in a different door
[1:57:49] altogether
[1:57:50] this is a different door there's not
[1:57:52] there's a different door let me read it
[1:57:54] again
[1:57:57] now the greater works
[1:57:59] was to have the power
[1:58:02] was to have the power in the church
[1:58:04] not only to heal the sick by prayer
[1:58:07] cast out devils by prayer
[1:58:09] but to impart eternal life to believers
[1:58:13] the holy ghost was coming
[1:58:15] and given into the hands of the church
[1:58:18] to impact life
[1:58:20] oh that's what calvary meant it took
[1:58:23] stoop degraded men and women
[1:58:26] and lifted them into a place
[1:58:28] to be sons and daughters of god to heal
[1:58:31] the sick and to impart eternal life by
[1:58:34] giving the holy ghost to obedient
[1:58:37] believers
[1:58:38] men who were once unbelievers will be
[1:58:41] made believers and impart spiritual
[1:58:45] eternal life
[1:58:46] how much great it is to see this sick
[1:58:48] woman laying here i can pray a prayer of
[1:58:50] faith and she'll be healed that's a
[1:58:52] great thing that's what he's doing then
[1:58:54] but he said greater than this shall you
[1:58:55] do i'm going to give you power not only
[1:58:58] to raise him up for a while but to give
[1:59:00] him eternal life which will be eternal
[1:59:03] forever
[1:59:04] poor blind wretched people how do you
[1:59:07] miss that don't you see what the greater
[1:59:09] thing is the greatest thing that could
[1:59:11] ever happen was to impart eternal life
[1:59:13] to people what is eternal life the life
[1:59:16] that he lived the life that was in him
[1:59:18] in power to others can a man do that a
[1:59:21] son of god can a vindicated son a son
[1:59:24] with a pillar of eye in him an adopted
[1:59:27] son with the ministry of jesus christ oh
[1:59:29] give the lord a praise of friend there
[1:59:31] you are give the lord a shout hallelujah
[1:59:34] glory to god
[1:59:36] hallelujah
[1:59:40] that's from that dead calvary
[1:59:42] we know paul had the holy spirit do you
[1:59:44] believe that
[1:59:44] when he was 14 days nice upon the sea
[1:59:47] without moon and stars right
[1:59:49] and he went down to the gallery
[1:59:51] to pray
[1:59:52] and he came back and told him man we
[1:59:54] have got courage for the angel of god
[1:59:57] whose servant i am
[2:00:00] came to me last night and said fear not
[2:00:02] paul is that right
[2:00:04] not the holy spirit
[2:00:06] the angel of god
[2:00:09] sent from god
[2:00:11] not the holy spirit jesus said the angel
[2:00:15] now when john the revelator the book of
[2:00:16] relations wrote i sent my angel jesus
[2:00:19] did john fell into worship the angel but
[2:00:21] the angel said stand up worship god see
[2:00:24] the true angel won't stand to be
[2:00:25] worshipped
[2:00:26] he said he was of the prophets and his
[2:00:28] fellow servants that would signify these
[2:00:29] things therefore
[2:00:31] therefore
[2:00:32] angelic beings
[2:00:34] is
[2:00:35] ordained ministers of god
[2:00:38] to come to the earth
[2:00:40] to be a record of god
[2:00:43] and they work through mortal beings
[2:00:46] just as they did to daniel
[2:00:48] and back to the ages back there i
[2:00:51] believe it with all my heart so
[2:00:54] therefore friends as your brother
[2:00:57] that's all i am
[2:00:59] but god's gift
[2:01:01] is the spirit of god
[2:01:03] that came down in the form of an angel
[2:01:08] he didn't have wings
[2:01:10] he looked like a man
[2:01:11] i heard him when he walked
[2:01:14] just as that and walked on the floor
[2:01:17] walked right over just as normal as any
[2:01:19] man just stand there man he comes time
[2:01:22] and time through the room and different
[2:01:24] places when i am fasting and praying
[2:01:27] the gift
[2:01:30] is the spirit of god
[2:01:32] that come down in the form of an angel
[2:01:36] see that's the level the prophet was at
[2:01:39] when the angel was working with him
[2:01:42] in the early part of his ministry he
[2:01:44] said i represent the faith
[2:01:47] by way of a divine gift
[2:01:49] because the angel didn't come yet
[2:01:51] because he wasn't adopted yet
[2:01:54] for the angel to come into him to work
[2:01:56] with him in that way so he just had a
[2:01:58] gift he said i represent defeat because
[2:02:02] the fate is god god-filled
[2:02:04] oh hallelujah
[2:02:06] oh my
[2:02:08] let's continue
[2:02:09] we get in there we get in there
[2:02:11] i reckon the sufferings of this present
[2:02:13] time right now
[2:02:15] are not worthy to be compared with the
[2:02:17] glory which are revealed in us
[2:02:20] for the earnest expectations the
[2:02:21] creation
[2:02:23] waited for the manifestation of the sons
[2:02:24] of god
[2:02:26] isn't that right
[2:02:27] waiting for the manifestation of the
[2:02:29] sons of god it is waiting for the church
[2:02:31] to come into this position waiting
[2:02:34] god
[2:02:35] trying to place his church in position
[2:02:38] to manifest himself
[2:02:40] you see this is very important this
[2:02:42] morning
[2:02:43] because before you the believers are
[2:02:46] placed
[2:02:47] the minister have to be placed
[2:02:50] let me say it again
[2:02:52] before the church is placed
[2:02:54] the fifo ministry have to be placed
[2:02:57] because that is god's order
[2:03:01] that is just god's order
[2:03:04] so listen to this

[2:03:07] trying to place his church in position
[2:03:09] to manifest himself getting one that he
[2:03:12] can work through like this
[2:03:14] and say
[2:03:15] there is my spirit flowing freely there
[2:03:18] it is i can work here
[2:03:21] for his spirit to fall freely it means
[2:03:23] that man like a pipe
[2:03:24] it could blow right through
[2:03:26] there's no hindrance there's no self
[2:03:28] there's no pride there's no personal
[2:03:30] ambition there's no issues he's like a
[2:03:33] pipe spirit could flow freely
[2:03:36] it could flow
[2:03:37] how there is my spirit flowing freely
[2:03:40] not coming down pouring out no flowing
[2:03:42] through him

[2:06:43] oh my
[2:06:45] hallelujah
[2:06:46] let's go
[2:06:48] he presents his army in the form of five
[2:06:50] offices
[2:06:51] this is god now
[2:06:54] he presents his army in the form of five
[2:06:57] offices not playing a tape of brother
[2:07:00] branham in the church that is not his
[2:07:01] army
[2:07:02] he had put our army at a players
[2:07:04] the fifo ministry is not people playing
[2:07:06] tape that is not the word that was never
[2:07:08] taught by the prophet there's another
[2:07:10] teaching altogether like that's off
[2:07:12] all right
[2:07:13] listen to what the prophet saying here
[2:07:14] he presents his army in the form of five
[2:07:17] offices first apostles prophets teachers
[2:07:21] pastors evangelists that's his army
[2:07:24] that's his soldiers that's his
[2:07:26] commanding officers all with the baptism
[2:07:30] of the holy ghost i wonder which one
[2:07:32] they said i won 24 hours you still be
[2:07:34] lost
[2:07:35] it's not that you're talking about here
[2:07:36] right all this army here have the
[2:07:38] baptism of the holy ghost
[2:07:40] waiting out there to meet the enemy on
[2:07:42] any grounds he comes upon to meet the
[2:07:45] enemy with the word amen each one
[2:07:48] backing one another up
[2:07:50] not chopping one up
[2:07:52] backing one up see that's where the five
[2:07:54] hole is
[2:07:55] true fivefold because the spirit of god
[2:07:57] cannot behave in one man
[2:07:59] and misbehave in another man no
[2:08:01] something is wrong somewhere see
[2:08:03] each one backing one another up with him
[2:08:06] the chief captain here we go here's the
[2:08:08] part the main part not out here in front
[2:08:11] not up here above
[2:08:12] not back behind but in them
[2:08:16] that's the army
[2:08:17] glory the god the army is god veiled it
[2:08:21] will become to the unveiling of the
[2:08:23] mighty god in a fightful ministry
[2:08:26] called unveiled to the bride and the
[2:08:27] bright church unveiled to the rest of
[2:08:29] the world or give the lord some praises
[2:08:31] vindicating what his resurrection by the
[2:08:34] proof of his words
[2:08:36] my my my mind
[2:08:38] hallelujah
[2:08:40] i'm almost done
[2:08:41] okay
[2:08:43] so let's try now the ministry of jesus
[2:08:44] christ put a brand
[2:08:46] let's turn to ephesians four there's
[2:08:47] some perfect man he gave some apostles
[2:08:49] some prophets remember the last night
[2:08:51] don't try to take another man's office
[2:08:54] some evangelists some pastors some
[2:08:57] teachers for the perfection of the god
[2:08:59] does it read like that congregation says
[2:09:01] no the perfection of what the saints who
[2:09:04] are the saints the sanctified one is
[2:09:06] that right perfection of the saints for
[2:09:08] the working of the ministry
[2:09:10] the ministry of jesus christ
[2:09:13] so they like to say perfectly saints but
[2:09:15] by the working partner working of the
[2:09:17] ministry which ministry my ministry know
[2:09:20] the ministry of jesus christ for the
[2:09:23] edith of the body of christ amen for the
[2:09:26] building it up eddy fine until we come
[2:09:28] to the unit of the fate and the
[2:09:30] knowledge of the son of god onto a
[2:09:32] perfect man under the assurance to the
[2:09:34] measure of the statute of christ
[2:09:36] oh my god
[2:09:38] what about him
[2:09:39] the gentile church is in the laodicean
[2:09:42] the end of the laodicean age
[2:09:44] the jews are in the homeland already
[2:09:46] there
[2:09:47] and the gentile apostasy has already
[2:09:49] taken place
[2:09:50] we have a president like we have
[2:09:52] we have a nation that's broke up like we
[2:09:54] have we have atomic bombs hanging in the
[2:09:56] hangars we have the church that's
[2:09:58] lukewarm we have a church a people that
[2:10:01] draw themselves together we have a
[2:10:03] ministry
[2:10:04] that patterns the ministry of jesus
[2:10:06] christ
[2:10:07] for
[2:10:08] to catch the stone when it comes
[2:10:12] so the ministry of jesus christ is not
[2:10:14] to say we have the message jesus christ
[2:10:16] the ministry of jesus christ is to catch
[2:10:20] the stone
[2:10:21] when it comes
[2:10:23] what's left to happen it might be at any
[2:10:25] minute
[2:10:26] there is nothing else left we are the
[2:10:28] end time
[2:10:30] the church is weak
[2:10:31] the church is today we are broke up
[2:10:33] organizational strife separation of
[2:10:35] brotherhood methodist baptist
[2:10:37] presbyterian fiveness all kind of stuff
[2:10:39] we are broke up that's the way it's
[2:10:41] supposed to be
[2:10:44] you hear it
[2:10:46] that is the way it's supposed to be it's
[2:10:49] got to be that way
[2:10:51] here we go then there will come a
[2:10:53] message you say oh hallelujah we know
[2:10:55] that it's the same pillar fire that that
[2:10:58] israel we know that the same ministry
[2:11:00] that accompanied jesus christ by that
[2:11:02] pillar fire that had him anointed is
[2:11:05] accompanying the church today
[2:11:07] so the church mashup and all these
[2:11:10] disagreements and all these arguments
[2:11:12] and regional one and shaykh and and
[2:11:13] whatnot that is how it's supposed to be
[2:11:15] but then they'll confront a god ordained
[2:11:18] fightful ministry with the pillar of
[2:11:19] fire oh glory to god with the ministry
[2:11:22] of jesus christ do you see it now
[2:11:24] here it is
[2:11:26] science i prove it we don't need that
[2:11:28] god has proved it we need
[2:11:30] the ministry of jesus christ to fit that
[2:11:34] headstone coming under that was brought
[2:11:36] to church into the place
[2:11:38] he's praying now father we realize that
[2:11:41] the church has come through the stage of
[2:11:42] justification come to the state of
[2:11:44] signification come to the stage of the
[2:11:46] receiving holy spirit now the stones are
[2:11:48] being honed down for the fitting of the
[2:11:51] ministry of jesus christ to blend in to
[2:11:54] take the church and we get that last
[2:11:56] week wednesday that holy spirit slot
[2:11:59] my almost finished but see we could come
[2:12:02] up to the piano
[2:12:03] when a man in the foundry is making a
[2:12:06] bell
[2:12:07] he has got a certain tone he has to put
[2:12:09] in it
[2:12:10] when he is setting this mold and putting
[2:12:12] his iron puts in so much brass so much
[2:12:14] steel so much copper wire he knows
[2:12:16] exactly how much you put in and that's
[2:12:18] what jesus has done by his brain he had
[2:12:20] to put in so much looter so much
[2:12:22] methodist so much presbyterian so much
[2:12:24] pentecost in it but what does he comes
[2:12:26] out with his own reflection
[2:12:28] what is it just like the pyramid message
[2:12:31] you see it's heaping right up this come
[2:12:33] to the minority with the headstone
[2:12:36] the ministry of jesus christ on earth
[2:12:39] has to be the same
[2:12:42] as the ministry he had
[2:12:44] or he can't come to it
[2:12:47] just like the head to the feet the head
[2:12:49] feet is not the head but the head packs
[2:12:51] the feet
[2:12:52] that makes the feet tells it where to go
[2:12:54] wesley was a great light
[2:12:56] okay justification service time
[2:12:58] signification justification on the
[2:13:00] looter it had to come to simplification
[2:13:02] on the wesley and salvation service time
[2:13:04] until we come to the baptism of the holy
[2:13:06] ghost and the baptism of the holy ghost
[2:13:09] servants time until the holy spirit
[2:13:11] which is only one god blends into the
[2:13:14] church and the church unto christ it
[2:13:15] makes jesus christ reflected on the
[2:13:18] earth what he promised
[2:13:20] oh my i'm closing
[2:13:24] what ties all this together
[2:13:26] just referring and everyone close up you
[2:13:28] could begin to play something softly but
[2:13:30] it's even
[2:13:32] david
[2:13:33] anointed in the presence of his brethren
[2:13:38] private
[2:13:40] literally unknown
[2:13:43] god will design the environment
[2:13:46] for david to come forward
[2:13:49] by his father being inspired someday
[2:13:51] with food for his brothers
[2:13:53] just when goliath
[2:13:55] making his
[2:13:56] move
[2:14:01] god digged him from the back
[2:14:04] and brought him to the front
[2:14:06] fivefold minister in type
[2:14:10] hallelujah
[2:14:12] brought out of obscurity
[2:14:14] by manifestation
[2:14:16] [Music]
[2:14:19] but abraham talked about
[2:14:22] moses minister joshua
[2:14:24] he knew something had to take place
[2:14:27] he couldn't tell the people god called
[2:14:28] me angel spoke to me go tell me this
[2:14:31] otherwise moses no
[2:14:33] there had to be a manifestation that
[2:14:35] clearly identified
[2:14:37] that just as god was with moses
[2:14:39] he was a joshua
[2:14:41] hallelujah
[2:14:46] before the people
[2:14:49] it could be texts it can't be scripture
[2:14:51] it can be a message spoken it has to be
[2:14:54] a manifestation that come forward
[2:14:57] elijah was the same thing
[2:14:59] oh my god hallelujah
[2:15:01] friends i trust that this would help you
[2:15:06] to realize it's not a game
[2:15:09] it's not a
[2:15:11] a verbal game
[2:15:12] it's not a messages game
[2:15:14] it's real
[2:15:15] [Music]
[2:15:17] but abanamata comes to all his processes
[2:15:19] lost his wife
[2:15:20] he lost his daughter he lost the
[2:15:22] anointing
[2:15:23] god squeezed him and pressed him
[2:15:26] until he come just like jesus
[2:15:28] what about us
[2:15:30] we have our times ahead of us
[2:15:32] all this
[2:15:34] environment we're in right now is part
[2:15:35] of what god set up what he has arranged
