he said I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life and lo cierren i wife shall have a son and Sarah hid it in the tent door which was behind him now Abram and Sarah were old and we'll stricken in age and it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of woman therefore she will laugh with an associate after I watch all of shall I have pleasure my god been also the Lord 70 we afforded to several laughs saying shall I have a surety be a child which I'm all is anything too hard for the Lord at the time appointed I will return unto thee according to the time of life I'm Sarah shall have a son Matthew chapter 25 familiar Scripture then shall the Kingdom of Heaven be likened unto ten virgins which took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom five of them were wise five of foolish they that were foolish took their lamps and took no oil with them but the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps while the bridegroom tarried they all slumbered and slept on a midnight there was a cry made behold the bridegroom cometh go ye out to meet him then all those virgins arose and trimmed their lamps and the foolish said unto the wise give us of your oil for our lamps have gone out but the wise answered saying not so least yea enough for us and you but go ye rather to them the bad sell and buy for yourselves and while they went while they went to buy the bridegroom came and either were ready went in with him to the marriage and the door was shut afterward up came also the other virgins in Lord Lord open to us where the answered and said verily I said

adore you we worship you we thank you for this great opportunity to come into your presence into your house and to learn of you and to receive from you and in this a time when we expect a dynamic power Lea come amongst your people Lord and baptize them and fire but the holy goes tonight in Jesus mi ask it amen and amen you may be seated oh praise God thank you lord well I said I still be choice him from Sunday I felt as a different turn a new season among us that the Lord would have bless and they work on the port mightily do we believe that tonight just three little words five wise virgins five wise virgins enough inspiration get ready and still ready oh praise God get ready and stay ready this Christianity is not a part-time thing is a full-time thing it can be a part-time Christian deliver the full 10 devil or glory Liguria be fully committed oh praise God isn't that right no but a Branham he had seen they were the shop you see there's three woman carriers of the natural seed until it matured into jesus ishmael could not be he was born from the bonds woman and Isaac was born of sex between Sarah and Abraham but then come along Mary by the vision put produce Jesus Christ that's gone the world no look there were tree woman there are true men type here churches the woman always tied church's tree denominational ages carriers which must also die so therefore just like the shock and so forth to give room for the seed the seed cannot get right until the shock stalk leaves all try that's right it sucks every bit of the light in them and so it's all it all it was is that plus or praise God so the seed cannot write until everything has died and what the sea does the sea draws all the life on everything so afterwards the life is contained in the seed the seed has the light or glory to God he said you cannot do it no it is see time or bright time or glory the shocks are dead the shocks at Chaya this is the virgin would time not touched its virgin remember it's a virgin good time if you're putting in the hands of denomination it won't be a virgin it will be manhandled she's got to be virgin not touch my interpretation always I love it there will be no denominational manhandling in the virgin birth of the bride or glory to God the bride will be and there'd be no manhandling of the virgin put of that bride that's why the Lord Himself descended with a shout or chlorine I've got to get the bride oh we believe that hallelujah so when the Lord told him pick up a pen I was right he said no what in the last days the true the church bride comes and headstone will be a super race as she nears the great headstone there will be so much like him that they will be in his very image in order to be united with him there will be one and that's why we say the Holy Spirit come down on drying the Holy Spirit has to come down on the atmosphere of praise and worship double United with Christ you have to be like Christ whole globe I really got that to be legend with Christ you have to be like Christ Oh glory to God so therefore in the upper room there has to be worshipping to create the atmosphere for the Holy Spirit to come down the only prisoner coming up on death or glory that God had never killed never not dead they come down in the atmosphere whoa glory to God fast user Street he was preached he is praying for two and a half years for five hours every day the church was it was what was being channeling to prayer lies are being challenged the prayer why it was power coming up on a sanctified life let me say it again it was power comment on a sanctified life and I separated life because God put Wesley in that position to clean the church up for your point of the Spirit or glory of God justification pick up the duty class certification wash the dirty glass back till he goes pour milk into the glass or do you believe that or glory to God so the first son was a spook you see word of God he was given my brain oh my the bride was given don't know what the referee use himself again another son of God so this terminology called bride it's for reproduction purposes so Jesus want to reproduce himself to get a brain to produce more sons just like him so you had to become just like him how many believe that not a church member but a reproduction of the green oh good lord hallelujah the bride was given to her producing self again another son of God and she fell by hide readin she fell and caused him to die the second son spoken she'd word was given my bright like Adam so Adam with his Bridal fell right but before he could marry her she fall also okay then from a little group of the true seed of the word God represent Christ a beloved bride of version of version of his word on tonight we sin on the positive five wise virgins Oh glory to God I wanna touch the foolish I want to talk about the wise one all glory to God she will be a vision for the world isn't that right how do you believe that then what a virgin who knows no man-made crease on dogmas what a virgin knows God said so God said so wife I am healed God said so if I come justified or glory to God I'm called of God I'm already justified I'm already glorified God said so or glory to God I am Joseph there's nothing against me because God said so the bride will be Joseph isn't that right so the bride believes the word it doesn't matter how old you are you believe the word it doesn't matter if you look at you can reduce it again you believe what God says or glory that God see repunit in the heart I'm all woman how I expect child and gorsek is anything to have the Lord if his man is a tough call in the other things herbs and exercise on rope on Savannah you're in trouble that and work him you need a miracle they need a body change give me that transformation you need something happen to you that's the same thing happened to Jacob that's why he asked Jacob who are you I'm a scamp I'm a deceiver I'm a cheat he said good I could change you know because you know what you are Oh glory to God I could change you in what you are to become so that experience transformed Jacob by wrestling with the angel but he had to be convinced he wanted that change you had to be convinced you want that change or give the Lord some praise Oh glory to God so this is this is what I come from my heart tonight sorry but this is what I got and I just five wise virgins not ten version we talked to the night justify wise we talking about five wives I want to see yourself inside idea from a little group of a truth sheet of the

seeing visions visions they're all right I'm Jake want to give your vision tonight Oh glory to God God can break upon your spirit tonight open the womb of your mind your spirit walk and receive himself for you tonight new you praise God the wood is in the bride undermine of Christ to know what he once done with a word and she does it in his name she has thus saith the Lord then it is Jimmy theis so the Holy Spirit waters it until it is grown and Silve its purpose he had a big bomb they only do his will only as well no one can persuade them different so this Brian about attitude this brand of a behavior you could talk you could see you could explain no one could get her to do otherwise Oh glory to God if we doing what the word said to do that's what we're striving for that's what you want do you want that they have touched here Lord or they keep still then they will do the works of God for it is himself in them continuing his word to fulfill as he completed his days all things when he was not what was here he did not complete when he was here for it was not time yet let us stand like just one killer as we see the promise uncommon insight as we see power common insect promised land promised land was the land of promise the holy goes from say the Old Testament New Testament the promised land is the land of the Holy Ghost the court in the land in to go into that land is the land of what is the Holy Ghost Lamb Oh glory that cause Allah know spirit and power Kenan represent that Holy Ghost ran in that lana war and battles and fights but is a Holy Ghost ran Oh glory to God that's happened across over the first a rooster circumcised and people who was born in the wilderness because circumcision was still required not because you cross into the land they reduce the concision Oh blow times a site for your boot right Oh glory to God hallelujah they still have come on the cotton Oh glory to God I just after five isn't that right they still at the common little cotton hallelujah and he said today I roll away the reproach of Egypt don't you circumcised because it lamb belong to the circumcised or give the Lord a shout or glory of God and lamb belong to the septum sighs so now you can understand white deer because it who is that uncircumcised philistine will keep the Lord a shout David knew who the lamb belong to poor Chloe there for as long as you're not sick I'm saying I could take you out or give the Lord a shout praise God David at the book write all them guys know they belong to God hallelujah the children's realm oh come on now hallelujah hallelujah praise God let us stand like just one killer I wanna skip along now for my Jenny Voss he said no watch look at this revival what they had the rivalry last three years Luther revival went in the nomination moody usually rather last about three years but this one went over 15 years not one denomination as far from it this is see time there is no more shock after the shock is gone it is seed cord is ready and if he isn't doing it now he's going to call a church to perfection by his word Jesus Christ or glory to God in Aliza hallelujah praise God praise God all right what time is that he said see time so let's look back at what we read on Sunday when the baptism of the Holy Ghost was presented a Methodist they couldn't take it no when the see time has produced a Pentecost she can't take it she's organized but she has been a carrier of the seal all glories of God he loves people pass through his message in the 70s and 80s all around they pass through the message Oh glory to God hallelujah but you are seated glory record mmm so what did the prophet prophesied see time will produce what another Pentecost hallelujah let's go but I'm talking about Abraham and where thy wife Sarah she's dealt behind you he's I'm gonna visit you I come on I'm going to visit you according to the time of life and you're gonna have that baby that you're waiting on he said Danny breaking but around in prophecy the Lateran is fixin to for you have held that seed in there long enough now believing you are looking for a common son and he is coming why I can't see that the Lateran is fixin to fall oh give the Lord a shout on that do you believe that when you form speak it to yourself pretty about us and Lord I know the Lutheran it's fixin to fall get ready for I'm still ready Oh blow you and I said get ready and steady Oh hallelujah the latter rain is fixing to fall that's guaranteed we'll get the Lord I showed them all that so the rain is not the problem it's what seed inside of you well can the Lord a shout and if that word seed inside of you you have you will you must reproduce a life of Jesus Christ or glory let go because the seed of God inside of you hallelujah praise God remember there will be such a denominational gathering pretty soon it will be terrific and they will bring themselves together in this Federation of churches and then this kind of change when we put out of operation as far as they know it's at that time that Jesus appeared and he will show which is Brian which is not but remember Christian friends I'm a man I can make mistakes but God being God cannot make a mistake all the words that have been written must be fulfilled so we have got things here in scripture that must be fulfilled and that is one of the things this boy got to come but before the boycott tantrum or the mocking of the beast there has to be a seed sword for God to take a church out of it that's what's important these messages to sorta see that they can take out because the my words are spirit and my words are lies so word is also a spirit and you're gonna find all the foolish virgins they can't get the oil because they don't have the word to turn into spirit Oh glory to God or get the Lord I show Loreena go when you come to Simmons they come my exile God release the oil and wood form nor the oil I want to turn into spirit the oil I want to serve in the power the realism of the fall and the wind will live you know what burn around calling me up Aroon dry seeds he said they hold themselves in the upper room there were dry seeds waiting for real crises and they afraid try see them they're fearful try seal and awaited on the promise and when the day of Pentecost was fully come my god the rain began to fall upon them dry seeds and up almost to Strong's feel smaller because I'm seeing again to grow and spread all praise God it was too small in the upper room Oh Chloe and they were filled with the Holy Ghost when up a dream fell on their season and this message you are being a Jessie for long enough but the freeness fixin to fall do you believe that do you really believe that Nick ready for tea or come on church yeah this message you know not just a night man ready for the ring from father's evil age he said no watch in obedience this little faith woman that lives by faith the bride hallelujah believes the Word of God obediently written in love for the promise of the age to be confirmed haha weekend promises but you have to look for it to be confirmed that's a different thing altogether hallelujah when God still Abram I am your shield and great reward look what Abram tell God he's telling about and I tell us Abraham's have any basement god I chained this I don't want to reward talk I want something in reality go and say come on Kong these guys because I talk in a different talk no I want to show you your future present cook them style so coin and showing you these times to show you what could happen in the future that you will take a different view of your present you hearing me tonight he said convinced that social ICB he say holy change the name for now but continue to walk and faith change me from Abram to

we anointed stick with oil oil symbolize Holy Spirit so the why is that oil in their lamps which was Holy Spirit so they were ready to go into the wedding supper okay and we find Ezekiel 9 he skipped oil Holy Spirit simonize Holy Spirit now watch this is a vision and this is a vision this was foolish version this was wise version booted envisions if you take that version run it down it means holy clean sanctified isn't that right now watch two churches these churches are clean holy as this one they're all virgins they're virgins they're clean the only difference was oil it alone not be container you know you can have the thumb but you have to have oil in the lamp it's a dupe reaching containers you know you can have structure containers you can have abundance of lamps you could be mr. lamp mrs. lamb brought a lamp you sellin lamps you own lamps your mystery a mystery of the lamps you'll follow me parts of the lamp but it needs oil in that lamp and the Holy Ghost if it's in there it produces it produces the very same kind of it did on pentagon it's not on model all you see one very hot is only one Lord and one Phaeton and once there it is one god this fire fall on you is one way one power one Lord one baptism or give the Lord Amen sister Judy hallelujah praise God in man what watch it would produce the same kind of fire it is on Pentecost if they don't have no fire there is no oil India if if if the churches up no fire if the minister have no fire daughter be fantastic fire fire fire father's bringing whatever I'm talking about this theater we talk about it

the jump up obviously Oh God people free this you know because the old-time holy and the devil whenever that's the reason people message here is alone glory because they have been deceived into thinking because they believe the message they have the Holy Ghost nice nice Baptist doctrine Paul didn't talk that you say have your receive since since you believe all glory of God but somebody really caught that if you believe it you have it but quad but but Brahmas talking to the Pentecostal who cleaned up and experienced sober I said if you have the real Holy Ghost you will receive this word because the Holy Ghost on the word is the same so if you believe that you have the receipt only goes check this word out and see what spirit in you if they're going to confirm that this is this is a word well he was coming to the message Baptist Methodist Pentecostal Hindu Muslim whatever they come into the message and they say well they read that and they say well because I come to the message I believe I have the Holy Ghost and there we have people that have been conformed my pigs with bow ties clean perfumed well scented long dress with big sticks with long dresses pigs with ties

we talk and we talk and we counseling and talking somebody get tired I suppose you want to see in the office afterwards and now they explained and somebody give our hands talk you see whether you've ever come or the answer is a good question and it's fire all over the place and of course actor speak they act when they have bring conviction you know your cargo here you know you're not doing that you know you're not going here this evening because the Holy Ghost is upon you you are being led by your spirit and has been delayed by the Spirit of God they are the sons of God you're anointed all right watch watch they have church rituals fine ceremonies nothing against it Cree's I will shake a conscience songs like angels singing you can't put a finger on their life but still it is wrong it's the pact but not all of it that's the kind of misses the rapture nice songs nice specials nice singing clean life everything order long dress nice tie jacket matching and everything else that missing in rapture but this is frightening the same thing with a different version under wise version they were both signed by people but this one I Dora this one did not have oil they would they said we are good as you are there is none of us good as far as that's concerned why you're a bunch of holy rollers there is none of us good we have all sinned come shall glory and you only will ever know it not by joining church not by trying to live good but by receiving Christ it ain't what I live him is what he was in what I am is what he is you live and that's your life but he lives in you that's a different thing altogether iguana's that's what you're saying preacher God have to do something for you Jacob got the birthright you know but then when we got to the angel he recognizes in this book right is what got me in trouble to begin modulo then I can't continue this way I have to be changed [Music] sometimes I miss all mine give my testimony next damage to this church I didn't over the angel wouldn't just say nothing William shall do nothing what you feel I was briefing gather on you to hear more testimony about the person of the angel you change no you still scheming you're still chilly it's still what but you have a testimony over angelic in point but Jacob wrestled all night long and he was so locked in many I recognize this man Alison go so he said he put this tie all that joy besides I ain't going here until they bless me then the angel talk what is your name because I bless you have to call on what you are I want to know you know what you are there's nobody tricking like me I'm expert on this thing he said you know Lord because Jacob change your name tonight Israel but you know what when he got on there his walk is different he have more than a testimony yeah but change life do you want that more than the testimony your hard to write no testimony and they turn all real testimony yet you want that change life so when he walked no he walking a limp in oh here what kind of style you can't walk when he pants fall off his bottom anything like that he he walking limping no walking he walk in the front now he walk like a rich man he walking like a book man a weak man but a man who are poor with God he looks naturally weak but yes power he has so much power his brother no longer intimidates him he's no longer afraid he have an assurance on the inside no inside for the brothers they get frightened you're going to see a next man could walk into your presence like that you have to watch out Oh glory to God hallelujah humility is real power you know Oh glory to God you have won that power inside you could do like if you have nothing whoa whoa whoa take a little more notice if inversion and vice versa with oil in the lamp all of a sudden became a song behold the Brethren comment grill to medium and they were weakened that is scary all of a sudden something changed and people get caught they get caught 30:50 still just holy holy still just get caught snapshot fix condition nothing changes after that Oh a sudden a message changes it's not what you think it took me going to church is what you believe and receive in your heart what all of a sudden go out to meet him and they were weakened and when they did this one could go in because they are all in the land that was the difference this one could not go in where there was the ordinary lamp they went back to pray up to receive the Holy Ghost oh so you mean this oil is takes you beyond the letter of the world it takes you with the burden to receive D only goes yes yes and while they were gone it was over the domination say well maybe we remain wrong maybe we better go back and seek for the baptism of the Holy then the back can come how close this is coming then they are no going to try to by turn your team on Gino you get it while the winter by they're trying to by now all the teachers are trying to have a revival they are trying to go back in this message after while the teachers recognize what they have because it will take more than explanation interpretation and revelation it will really take a power that's why the prophesying national forces put the church in the woods and constitutions but the power of God will put the people in the brain we need power and Jesus said you shall receive power after the Holy Ghost come upon you that is acts 1:8 that is all power come in know you need this not just for you but for your children that they get the mask on so that they be sealed also us parent have to have a burden for your own children the court seal them with the Holy Ghost John the batter was celibate the Holy Ghost the white virgin below the lamp she made ready while she was going to get some oil and they're trying to do right now the great evangelical
