So this evening we have an extract from wisdom versus faith that we would hear a portion of it just before we go to the communion. So God bless you. Have a seat, brother Shane. Praise the Lord. down to the dead grave from right there because she doubted one word. Some of them say, "Well, I believe this is true. I believe that's true. I believe God can save, but I don't believe he healed. I believe the Holy Ghost sure fell on the day of Pentecost, but there's no place where there's anything that says the Holy Ghost fell after your Pentecost." Oh, brother. &gt;&gt; That's the way they say it. call themselves the churches of Christ, having a form of godliness but denying the word thereof. &gt;&gt; That's it. See, you must believe. Don't reason. Believe. Don't try to have wisdom. Just believe the word. Wisdom tries to reason and present a better way. Now, that's exactly what Satan told Eve. Now, you're not going to die. Surely you won't because God's a good God. He is a good God. And the only way I can trust him to be a good God that he'll stay at his word. &gt;&gt; How can you expect me to be truthful when I'm not truthful? &gt;&gt; If I tell you one thing, do something else. My word's pretty shaky. &gt;&gt; See, what makes him a good God is because he spoke the word and we're to live by that word. Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word of God proceedth out of the mouth of God. &gt;&gt; Thank God's got to stay with that word. That's what makes him a good God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, if he said, "Well, I let him get by this. I I let him do this. Well, that's all right. Oh, I I I'll move over here." Well, he's a wishy-washy. &gt;&gt; See, he isn't God. He's He's just an ordinary man. &gt;&gt; See, but to be a good God, he has to stay with his word. that puts every child if he'll let this one commit adultery and this other drink a little and and this other one can do lie a little this other can steal a little and this other can do do this then make me just told the line to come in. He's got one way &gt;&gt; and all it goes in is going in that gate. &gt;&gt; Straight is a gate. &gt;&gt; Narrow is the way. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; No defilement enter therein. over in Revelation said, "All without are sorcerers, &gt;&gt; whoreongers, and dogs, and so forth. Blessed are he that doeth all his commandments, &gt;&gt; that he may have a right to the tree of life." &gt;&gt; That's right. There's one way that's God. Don't reason out no other way. Well, uh, the Roman church says we are the church. Uh, that that Bible is not even worth the why why you couldn't. Bishop Sheen said to try to live with it was like walking through muddy waters. See, &gt;&gt; see how you go to do that? See, then if he's right, then the Bible's wrong. &gt;&gt; The Bible's right, he's wrong. &gt;&gt; Now, why you going to say if God's word's right, it's either Bishop Sheen or or the Bible. Not only Bishop Sheen, but Reverend so and so and Dr. So and so and so and so. I wouldn't have called the man's name unless he said on the radio. So, he said that on the radio, so I guess I can call his name. Dr. So and so and so and so said so and so and so and so. Now, who you going to believe? God or them? What? Say it really doesn't mean it just this way. It means it just the way that it's written. &gt;&gt; Well, that's the first lie of the devil. He said to Eve, it just really doesn't mean that. Surely God's too good to do that. You won't die. But they did &gt;&gt; and they will every time. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Got to meet the word. Wisdom tries to take a a better way, the way of modern, the way of popularity, the an easier way, find itself around just now you take a fellow here, maybe God to dealing with him. Now, when he thinks he has to come up, he has to make his wife come right to the line. He has to quit his card parties. He has to quit going to the dances. His wife has to let her hair grow out. He has to quit wearing makeup. He has to quit smoking, drinking. He's got to get out of that big society that he's in. Got to humble himself at the altar. He's got to stand and be called a fanatic holy roller. Be elybo. Anything can be called. &gt;&gt; Oh, I'll be religious, but I I I'll go down here and join the this church down here. You're too narrow. &gt;&gt; There you are. See, there's a reason. &gt;&gt; Reason. Now, we're going to get to a great point in a few minutes on that. See, how you going to know which is right and wrong, man? See, now tries to make the word say something. Knowledge does. Knowledge, wisdom tries to to uh reason. Wisdom finds a better way. There is no other way &gt;&gt; but God's way. Wisdom tries to point out say, "Oh, well now you know we couldn't do that in this time. We must do it anyhow." &gt;&gt; See, tries to find an easier way. Tries to make the Bible say things that it does not say. Now you say, "Oh, Brother Brand, now you're Wait just a moment. We're go back to the seed again." What wasn't the devil trying to do with wisdom? Make God's word say something that it didn't say. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Exactly. &gt;&gt; He tried to make God's word say something that it didn't say. &gt;&gt; So that's the way it comes today. When they try to make God's word say something that it doesn't say. Well, they say, "Well, I tell you, brother, you ain't got the right interpretation. The Bible said that prophecy is of no private interpretation." Why? Why is it a private interpretation? Why? The word of the Lord came to the prophets. It is interpreted by the prophet. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can't be of an interpretation private. The prophet's already interpreted to you. There it is written right there. That's the way it's supposed to be. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God's got to have some fundamental something that all people's got to be judged by. If it's by a church, which one's right? &gt;&gt; About 900 of them. 900 different organizations, pardon me. Which one of them is right? How you know you're going in? What if you're a Methodist and a Baptist is right? What if you're a Pentecostal and Presbyterians are right? What if you're a Catholic and a Lutheran are right? What if your Lutheran and the Catholics are right? There's got to be some foundation somewhere. So if the word in the beginning was the word and the word was with God and the word was God. See the word was in God. It was God. It was his thoughts that was with him always. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There God's thoughts is as eternal as God is. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That ain't skim milk, brother. See, &gt;&gt; here it comes. God's thoughts was his word in the beginning. That's in eternity now when beginning first started time. In the beginning was the word. God's thoughts and the word was with God and the word was God. &gt;&gt; His thoughts is what he was. That's you, too. What your thoughts are is what you are. &gt;&gt; No matter what you try to live, but something else, your thoughts is what you are. &gt;&gt; You might go along act like a nice fellow, but in your heart, you're an adulteress. And whatever it is, that's what you are. &gt;&gt; Your thoughts. And God's thoughts was his word that was with him and in him. And it was God. &gt;&gt; In the beginning was the word, and the word was with God. And the word was God. &gt;&gt; And that word was made flesh. God's thoughts was expressed in a human body made flesh and dwelt among us. There you are. Now, if you have eternal life today, you are in God by God's being in you. You are God's express thought. &gt;&gt; Then don't listen to any reasonings. Guess your crown be taken give to another. Don't take any reasonings at all. Just believe what God says the truth and stay with it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Reasonings through wisdom tries to make the word say something it doesn't say. Now you say, "Is that true, Brother Brandon?" Well, let's just go back to Genesis and find out. Let's go to Genesis, the third chapter of Genesis, and we're going to read the the the fourth verse. See, if if wisdom tries to make the word say something that it isn't, the third chapter of Genesis, the fourth verse, and the serpent said unto the woman, ye shall not surely die. See what it presents? What is it? trying to make the word say something that it doesn't say. &gt;&gt; God said you shall die. &gt;&gt; Wisdom is Satan was presenting to her said you shall not surely die. &gt;&gt; See, it's trying to make the word say something that it isn't. So, &gt;&gt; that's what wisdom is today. Oh, brother, how are we carrying on that? seminaries, schools of theology. That's their very nest. &gt;&gt; That's their grassroots is trying to make God's word say something that it doesn't say. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I challenge anybody to show me the Apostles Creed in the Bible. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I challenge anybody to show me communion of saints in the Bible. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Both Protestant Catholic believe it. I challenge you to show me any of those things in a Bible. See, it's the grassroots of wisdom trying to reason. Our warfare is not carnal but mighty. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Casting away all reasons. See, pulling down the strongholds of Satan. &gt;&gt; Amen. that great flowery beautiful creature, not a slick greaser. No, no, that's on the inside. But outwardly, sin is twice as pretty. &gt;&gt; You know, sin's beautiful. How many men in here and women is past 50 years old? Raise up your hands. I didn't know what to ask the women, but I we all admit the truth. I want to ask you a question. Do you see today that women are twice as pretty, nearly as they used to be on the run average across the world? If that's so, raise up your hand. &gt;&gt; Sure. They're twice as pretty as what they used to be. Get some old pictures. Look at grandmother. Long skirts, braid of hair hanging down her back. She wasn't so attractive to look at. Look at the modern one today. Little skin down dress whatever form she can't move without sinning. Walking tipping down the street with all the makeup and cosmetics that Maxu Facture can put on her nearly fixing her hair like some little girl wearing a little skirt just up about above her knees if she's got on any at all. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But you look at her, she's pretty. Satan knows how to do it. &gt;&gt; He's the author of beauty. &gt;&gt; That type of beauty which results in sin. The earth itself is a womb. Where did God place his seeds? Where's seeds put in a womb? God puts seeds. And what does man do? Like devils in a womb. You'll make a child deformed if he can. That's what devils has done on the earth. Hybriding. Making creatures is not so I better leave off with that. I'll never get the rest of this year got roll down. You know what I mean? That's the reason there's a farm creation about to be cast. God's finished with it. The world's all out of order. &gt;&gt; Everything's wrong. The streams are polluted. The air is polluted. &gt;&gt; Filth stink. An old Indian not long ago said, "White man, I don't want to live any longer. I'm through with fighting." Said, "Where's my babies? Are they starve to death? Where's my wife?" said, "Before you come here with your women in whiskey and sin, we lived in peace. &gt;&gt; That's our grounds. God, give it to us, but you're taking it away from us. You'll pay for it someday." &gt;&gt; Look at it today in that big pretty deserts and mountains stroed with stink, sin, whiskey bottles, beer cans. Every place is full of taverns and Tommy rot. Reno Nevada in that great desert under nothing but a prostitution. &gt;&gt; The great cities are the even the air and the atmosphere is contaminated. &gt;&gt; Once the pretty mountains grow now just cut up with all kinds of everything else. Where the trees grow, they're cut out. Where the deserts, the waters flow free. It's contaminated. The whole world is going to have a a cast. The earth's going to give forth her child from the seed been perverted by devils tearing it up and working it up. Sure it is. It's perverted creation. God will cast it away and start over again. &gt;&gt; That's right. What did it come from? One person believing one little disbelieving one little phase of God's word. &gt;&gt; The whole earth is groaning. The Bible says that even nature itself is groaning for that day of release &gt;&gt; waiting for the manifestations of the sons of God. &gt;&gt; The trees are striving in vain. The flowers are trying to brighten the way for the but they're growing and crying and knowing something wrong. Perverted. The womb can't bearing forth that perfect because she's perverted. The ground stinks. She's bathed with innocent blood. She's got She's like a I could say something might be too flat. It's it's it's stink. God said it stinks before him. &gt;&gt; So filthy. Walk into a restroom, the urinal and just stink contaminated. That's exactly what the world smells through. Like God smelling to it. Filth. The whole thing is filthy. God will burst her to pieces. I'll create a new heavens and earth. He said, &gt;&gt; "Yes, sir." What is it? Her womb hasn't brought forth a millennium. She's brought forth a perverted thing. Why? Trying to be wisdom. Got nothing against Florida. I don't mean this for you people from Florida, but when I crossed and went to Florida the first time and come back to the Georgia lines there, I stood right there and I said, "As an American citizen, I give my part of it back to the seinals where it belongs." While they take better care of their yards than I do my hair, everything feathered, the palm trees have got lights all over it, big swanky yachts and things trying to bring a millennium without repentance. I got help. &gt;&gt; To me, it's a bunch of nothing. A million times more. I'd rather climb in British Columbia to the top of a hill and look across the mountains that God created and man's hands never touched it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Certainly going to these cities, the big homes, that that don't attract me. I hate that kind of stuff. &gt;&gt; But I know that one day, one day, &gt;&gt; it'll be changed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. She'll cast forth her afflicted child, the earth. It'll be changed one day. Okay? Faith bleeds and it is written and says the word has no flaws. &gt;&gt; Did you ever hear ministers say, "Well, I tell you the King James version or the this revised version or this year, it's just a it's just a little different. It really didn't really mean that." Have you heard that? Oh my. the world's contaminated with it. See, but faith don't believe that. Faith believes a God that can make me can keep that book in order for me to live by. &gt;&gt; If the God who made me is going to judge me can't keep his book in order, then he's a very poor God. &gt;&gt; I believe every word of it truth. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; What does this do to believe that? It gives faith a perfect resting place in it. &gt;&gt; Amen. See, you cannot disbelieve that that word's messed with in any way. You've got to believe it just the way it is. If you try to use wisdom to say, "Now look here. It's not reasonable that God said would do his thing like this, but God did do it." That's right. Now, if you say, "Well, now if God did this, if he uh tuck a man's life because he was a Levite, put his hand on the ark when he was about to fall, no matter how much he was, and he tuck his life for it. God said just Levites alone to touch that. You tuck it. That's what got David stirred up. You know, a Levite was nothing but a Levite was supposed to touch that ark. And here the ark was coming right back for a revival. And one outside of that tried to handle the word. That goes to show that only the anointed of God is to touch that word. &gt;&gt; These creeds and denominations got no business tampering with it. That's the Holy Spirit's got a right to that word. &gt;&gt; And it's death for any other to touch it. &gt;&gt; Or to disbelieve any of it or teach it. The same will be taken this part out of the book of life. &gt;&gt; Don't put your hands on it. Stay away from it. Listen. Believe just what it says. Don't take nobody else's word. Take what it says. &gt;&gt; Stay right with the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's death to do anything else to it. Now cause it. What does faith do? It believes it just the way it is. That's the way God has preserved it down through the age. And here it is. It's a word of God for me. God honors that. &gt;&gt; It gives a perfect faith in its truness. How could you ever marry a woman? If that young girl had had had run out and done everything and lived in prostitution and everything else and and you went and got her in a house of prostitution, come out and she was she said, "Well, I I I'll try to be a better girl." You can't have faith in that woman. See, you can't do it. How can a woman have faith in a man that's did the same thing? You just can't build your faith there. There's nothing to build on. See, you can't do it. How could you go out here and say, "Here's a boat. It's got a lot of holes in it, and I put some grass sacks in it. Perhaps maybe it'll it'll stem the tide across the river, and I wouldn't want to take a chance on it when there's one sitting here. It's built right." &gt;&gt; Sure. Why would we take some man-made theology with holes all in prove that it's wrong? See one here's one sitting here that's reading the word of God who stem the tide to every hard storm and hail. &gt;&gt; She's held just as true as she could be. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And always will. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. Heavens and earth will pass away said Jesus but my word shall not. Why? They're eternal. &gt;&gt; There was in the beginning. He just come here to express God's word. He was God's expression. God was expressing himself through his son. These all started in Genesis the seed chapter and has been ever since ever since been on the scene. It's been the same thing, a fight between wisdom and faith. Always fight. So wisdom is of the devil and for his children. Did you ever notice all of you seen sheep? All of you seen goats. But you know the blate of them two is so close it takes a real shepherd to tell the difference. You put an old goat out there and let him blade. Bait. Then you go over here and put a sheep there and let him blade. Listen at it. They're saying it's a lie. But a real shepherd can catch that voice. Jesus said, "My sheep know my voice." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; They can tell where's a goat. &gt;&gt; Well, he's a sheep himself. My &gt;&gt; he my sheep know my voice. Strangers they won't follow. What is his voice? Here it is. The word. &gt;&gt; My sheep know my voice. See, they won't let anybody say, "Well, now here I'm talking the voice of God, too. This says this, there, but it's see." We'll get to that in just a little bit. Cool that off for you. Now, now you see that the seed word cannot grow in the atmosphere then of knowledge. Is that right? &gt;&gt; See, as soon as knowledge mixes with faith, it dies. Right there. &gt;&gt; Eve come and say, "The Lord God said, the day we eat thereof, that day we die." And she stopped to see what he had said. He said, "But listen, my dear, you lovely little thing. See, surely God made you for a purpose." You know that's right. See, you're woman. You were made for this purpose. That's what it is. You don't know it now, but you were made for this purpose. Oh, you're a lovely little thing, dear. Look at those dainty little hands. See? Well, sure you would. Surely, but he said if we if we did, we'd die. He said, but oh, you think that a good loving father, God would do a thing like that. What she do? She listened to reason, tuck his wisdom, said it's a tree delight. One can be desired of it. And she fell for it. Exactly. And when she did, what happened? like it would to any woman. As soon as you fall for it, it finishes right there. That's right. Now, you see the seed that she was holding and would have finally become a mother by the will of God through a spoken word. She would have finally become a mother. But she couldn't wait into that. Now see then as soon as she did that accepted wisdom with the word and wisdom was contrary to the word. You understand? Say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See if wisdom is with the word and proves to be at the word and the word produces itself by the same thing it is the word. &gt;&gt; But if wisdom is against the word not with the word but trying to find something to add to it or take from it. It's of the devil. And Holy Ghost seeds of the Bible cannot grow in the atmosphere of wisdom. &gt;&gt; That kills every seminary in the countrymen. &gt;&gt; That knocks the holes right out to them and punctures them and the judgment flows in. That's &gt;&gt; right. Amen. &gt;&gt; It should certainly see because the word cannot grow with wisdom. &gt;&gt; Worldly wisdom won't do it. Eve was to believe the word as it was given to her. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; She wasn't listening to anybody else say anything about it. Just the way it was given to her. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the way she's supposed to believe it. &gt;&gt; Amen. There never been a death if she'd believe that. That's right. And a man or a woman that'll take God's word just the way it's given to us, &gt;&gt; hold it the way God said it, it's life. &gt;&gt; But to mix it with some wisdom of some organization, you die right there. &gt;&gt; Just like it did in the first. That's a seed. That's way That's way it acted the first time. That's the way it'll act every time. It always has. God permit we'll prove that through the Bible this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's the only way it can grow is to separate itself from all reasonings or anything else and just believe the word. &gt;&gt; Eve was supposed to take it just the way God give it to us. And I've expressed and told you that I believe God has preserved and kept this Bible. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the way God give it to me here. &gt;&gt; I don't want no other wisdom. I want just the way God said it here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Now, I hope I don't hurt you. But if the Bible said that I must repent, &gt;&gt; it means repent. &gt;&gt; Not do penance, but repent. &gt;&gt; The Bible said me be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. It didn't mean something else. &gt;&gt; Didn't mean father, son, holy ghost. It said that. Well, you say Matthew 28:19 said baptize them in the name of the father, son, holy ghost. That's exactly what it was. Now, if that isn't right, if they haven't got the right thing, then the faith that Peter had to baptize in the name of Jesus Christ and all the rest of the Bible, then they had a a false revelation that God blessed. That brings him right back. He should have blessed Eve in the beginning. &gt;&gt; The name of the father, son, holy ghost. That's three titles. It's only one name. You cannot be baptized in the name of father, son, holy ghost until you're baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Because that is the name of the father, son, holy ghost. The whole Bible is wrote out like that. &gt;&gt; Every person in the Bible is ever baptized is baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Nobody in the scripture ever baptized in titles of father, son, holy ghost. &gt;&gt; And everyone was baptized in the name of of the Lord Jesus Christ was baptized in the name of father, son, holy ghost. Everyone was baptized the titles of father, son, holy ghost is baptized in no name at all. Amen. &gt;&gt; A title like minister, reverend, doctor, whatever more, father, son, human, wife titles said, don't make any difference. Then put your title on your check, not your name, and see where it goes. She &gt;&gt; say, I signed this check in the name of the housewife. Well, &gt;&gt; that make just as much sense as would just believe God's word with the revelation laying right there before you. &gt;&gt; So, sure. Yeah. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; It's supposed to believe it the way God said it. &gt;&gt; And it does not contradict itself. If it does, you come show me. &gt;&gt; Don't contradict itself. Not at all. Satan might contradict it to you, but he can't to the word. So, the word won't stand that. No sir. That's the age old thing. It's been thought of, but it's never been proven yet. Let's follow these two sources or what you might call atmospheres and see what they create. Let's follow them for a few minutes. Atmosphere. Both of these sources will create an atmosphere. I want to ask you something. Did you ever go in a church I say this reverently now and with just to make a point. God forbid. Did you ever go in a church where the pastor's real starchy? The congregation's the same way. See, what is it? It's that atmosphere that brought it. Go into a place where the pastor says, "Now wait a minute. There's no such a thing as that nonsense. I don't believe in such a thing as divine healing about the baptism of the Holy Ghost." And you'll see everyone in them congregation. If he ain't if there's an eagle in there somewhere, he'll get out and look under that bunch of chickens. He &gt;&gt; sure will. Exactly. He'll leave it. &gt;&gt; He sure will. He can't stand that. &gt;&gt; He's an eagle. He's a sky built bird, not a barnyard. Yes, sir. Now, here he is. And now we find out that those atmospheres and you get in wherever the those things where faith is taught. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; In a church, you'll find a church in that atmosphere. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, God. Let let me get this to you. So if you see go as reason and people come among the saints where they're praying believers Paul said he didn't find any in the city only Timothy that was like precious faith that he had you know &gt;&gt; the rest of them are all denominational see but when he got into that atmosphere see he you find things going on that the atmosphere is created you find people living by faith when you get into a place where it says my why The Bible's true. God heals. You walk around that congregation, you find why I was dying with cancer. I was healed. I was once blind. I see. And a stranger said, "Why? What you mean? What was Matthew? I'll show you on my record. Come home with me. Come eat dinner with me and I'll show you something. I got a record up there. My neighbors know that I was in this condition. I was paralyzed for years. I was praying for it." See, what is it? That that word in that church, that group of believers has created that atmosphere. Now, how is the word in its simplicity but yet in its completeness ever going to grow in a place where knowledge overshadows that and says it can't be so? &gt;&gt; It can't. &gt;&gt; So where knowledge is preached from a seminary the children die. &gt;&gt; Where faith is preached from the word the children live. Amen. That's the difference. Just life and death. Could we all stand? &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Let's just worship the Lord, Father. We thank you. We praise you for your word. We praise you for your truth that we are to create an atmosphere that things can begin to happen. Father. Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord Jesus. Thank you, Lord Jesus. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Praise the name of the Lord. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Jesus. Glory to God.

Oh [Music] m. [Music] [Applause] [Music] M [Music] in this like turn your Bibles to 1 Corinthians chapter 11. We're going to read from verse 23. [Music] For I've received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread. But when he had given thanks, he broke it and said, "Take, eat. This is my body which is broken for you. This do in remembrance of me." After the same manner also he took the cup.

For as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, you do show the Lord's death till he come. Wherefore, whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.

Heavenly Father, we pray this day that your Holy Spirit will bless the articles that have been prepared of the bread, the wine. Bless, oh God, your feet washing. Bless the believers as they look to you in honoring this commandment. Grant it father in Jesus name I ask it. Amen. At this time you bow ahead close your eyes as we have a minute of silence as you pray for the ministry and the ministry pray for you. Praise the Lord. My seats deacons will be
