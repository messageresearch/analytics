god bless you may have your seats now as begin to come forward amen to greet us amen let's just welcome them amen christian love amen and i heard a voice from heaven saying come out of my of her my people thank you that you may not be partaking of the sin and that you receive not a plague act he shall receive a power after the holy ghost come upon you the name of the lord from the west and the glory from the rising of the sun when the enemy coming in with the flood the spirit of god we lift up a standard against him blessed lord the word just read the testimony and the people that we're here let everybody down for that glory name of jesus may be seated may god bless you i want to greet the convention and greet the pastor to awfully savvy this hero of faith that we so love and we praise so much i want all sorts of greats the great church of trading that tobago and all the scents across the world and i also am a minister in godney tabernacle the prophet breaks the message spiritual experience of the beginning and i also i want to talk about some of my experiences i will not say experience of the beginning because i'm i'm just in my beginning i mean compared to those giants the veteran of the on the faith they're preaching this convention i am from a catholic family my father is still catholic when i was young god please says you've trusted me to know him i was friends with pentecostal friend and i knew that they had something more than a head i don't have and one day as he was sitting in the church in the catholic church i was with my friend and he also will leave after and we know we should have to leave this church because it will now our place we say that we'll do something and we'll take the bible and open it and find the uh verse where we find the people we pick the va the verse will be the will of god it was a child sadly but that what we did he heard the bible and said are you ready i said yes i am open and oh we picked revelation 8 4. come on over my people they don't take part of their sin amen now we know not a message yet we know not many things but we know that god wanted us to come out and after we came out and now i joined the assembly of god enough afterwards i joined the pentecostal church i was a man of jesus and i still aim it i remember that when there were a prayer tonight fasting days because for my my parents to give him permission and go i was evangelist evangelizing everywhere preaching the word of god everywhere and even at the college i preach the word all almost to all my classmates that were uh a meeting that i was uh directing when i believe also the message i want souls among these so the one who is a minister in some church every was calling me pastor just to laugh at me and one day a man who was believing the message already i met him and i believe that men said in 1916 and i was baptized in 1917 but i don't just don't want to carry on this thing we have received the basic of the message we're reading the message of the lord and until now our nuts had experience of the holy spirit baptism and with my adolescent crisis i had my my up and then and then when i got in contact and i believe this glorious message of the seven thunder i have no time to get into detail as brother command said it is an invitation to be partaker of the life of jesus christ and from there many things will happen and when i got to this church gordon a tabernacle i begin to live experience after experience after experience you know when you find the man and you find the place the right place many things change december 2008 pastor advised me to be in convention i went with my wife and the 27th december and 28th after the preaching i was lost in worship and something supernatural happened to me and all my life began to unfold before me and for 20 minutes uh crying like a baby and something happened in my life december 4 20 11 is uh one of the dates notable date and memorial date our pastor preached the sitting angel and that day i was in the back i was desperate and i was praying i was wrestling with the engine the holy ghost came to me so powerfully and as a wind in this high speed 20 200 kilometer hour and the supernatural lights i saw many brethren testify that this experience they they testified they felt the power of god that day the pastor himself when it came the 11th december he testified that the power of god was so it was too much then he has to pay unto the puppet of a while far when you don't receive the holy ghost when you believe you receive the holy ghost after you have believed it may take many years just to keep moving on just keep clipping on to the god who is able to fulfill his promise will remember you amen the prophet said simple intellectual conception of the message would not be enough but when he's talking about intellectual he talking about not talking about those who are not going to school knows who are graduates if it is case there will be many to be disqualified he said in the main stage the young ruler was intelligent the light touched him he refused paul was intelligent man the light touched him and he accepted it my counsel or my advice you young people be serious in the study when you have a job just keep training yourself god will take you and prove that you can have a better life without compromising we can get our better life without getting to the demonic uh the morning court this is a promise i am a witness of that promise amen with my master degree but today today i am an executive in my company and then i have a five times six times my salary and this is the grace of god young people don't go in the world you have everything to live a better life in christ you have everything in christ [Music] listen to the devil we'll tell you that a young people a young person you could not live the life of christ the god that gave me the grace to baptize my my mother and i am grateful to that the prophet said in the great battle you never fought god is selecting his his soldier and dressed him he dressed them with the rest of the world the world manifested the rainbow coats not only he addresses them but he trained them for the battle there is a battle between doubts and fates there is a battle for the coming of the lord a battle between uh the sickness and the i will close with this testimony a sister called me on first january say brother stephen my daughter is sick and she's really sick and then she got something on her nose and it is really she was a bad i said sister this is the first january i received people in my house of a while would have come to your house or in the hospital but our god can work remotely and i got outside and we pray on the moral she called me and said that her doctor got out of the hospital and then she is aware a brother who was sick and he had some liquid in his lungs he called me and i would pray together and the next week when he went to the hospital the physician can never it cannot see nothing in islam a woman came in his church she wanted us to pray for her sister we went to the hospital and that lady was lying on the bed i went with another deacon because the winning team when we got there we prayed for that lady there was another lady next to her also she was dying to she was paralyzed she was not even she was not even conscious in a coma and her daughter was sitting around her and then we talked with her we presented her we presented her the lord and the divine hater would pray for her the women we went to the hospital for she came out and then she bare witness and that lady uh we have our sister who was in contact with that and she bear witness also that that other lady came out of the hospital here [Applause] this is the god that we believe the god that we pray i finish with this in 2021 last year i told my wife i have to speak during a convention amen i had a dream in february 2021 in that dream god invited you pastor invited me to speak in in the convention and i woke up in the middle of the night i went back to sleep again i had the same dream at a time i had no doubt that it would be this day today it is a reality pastor to albert god bless you all do i connect across the world god bless you the god of abraham branham let's prepare ourselves for the battle god bless you dear brothers and sisters i greet you warmly from germany and i am glad to have another opportunity to be joined with you via stream may god also let this conference serve to build up the bride of christ to grow and come into her perfect position thank you also to brother theo for extending the invitation well i will only speak some few words for a word of greetings today i want to share with you a little thought that was delighted me a few weeks ago i saw an article in our daily newspaper about trees this is the article in the article questions were asked the question how tall is the tallest tree how old is the oldest tree which is the largest lift tree which is the studies tree what is the largest food which is the thickest skinned tree at the end of the article something was written about the most famous tree this is the part of the article we can read it the most famous in this world that tree can neither be touched nor visited for it exists only in faith according to biblical tradition the tree of knowledge stands in the middle of the garden of eden because adam and eve violate god's prohibition and taste of its fruit they were expelled from paradise the fact that it is an apple is not specified the reason for the later formed tradition is probably the latin term melon with short a it means mischief with the long vowel apple and if we read in the bible there it is written in genesis chapter 3 verse 5 for god doesn't know that in the day ye eat thereof then your eyes shall be opened and he shall be as gods knowing good and evil and if we look carefully we can see we remember that not long ago the bible was translated into latin the will gator bible was for centuries the authority of bible from which to read and teach and if we look a little bit more closely to the words we can see the following we know it wasn't eating an apple but how do you think people got that idea according to genesis 3 5 it is written knowing good and evil the latin term is bono at malum bottom has a meaning of the moral good morality honesty virtue good principles good conduct and the the word malum means with a short a malon it means evil mischief and if you pronounce it with a long a malum it means apple so i can imagine whenever the word the latin word malum was pronounced people heard in the back of their heads the word apple and so the image of an apple was joined with the word evil from this little thought we can also see very nicely why brother branham told people to say only what was on the tapes god has given us a divine perfect interpretation of his own word and we know that any human interpretation will ultimately leads to spiritual death how many people were deceived by only one mispronounced letter so that they still believe that the fall had something to do with an apple praise god for i self that he has given us so that we cannot only see what is visible before our eyes but look into the mystery of christ revealed god bless you mightily and may he bless his church especially his bride and israel the lord is near glory be to god hallelujah thank you jesus you appreciate that man we appreciate those great things today amen and amen we say god bless you thank you so much amen we salute you amen in the precious name of jesus christ glory to god hallelujah amen and amen and amen as you begin to stand praise god hallelujah praise god thank you jesus thank you father glory to god give me a key for that song as you get ready to change your disservice jehovah is your name oh jehovah is your name [Music] jehu [Music] oh great one more time [Music]

mercy lord we feel so humbled o father god and lord just this privilege it feels lord like we've done nothing for this it was your grace your grace alone lord just to be found in your presence and lord you said in your scriptures wherever two or three are gathered there you will be in their midst and this morning lord we want to invite your holy presence of father god into this house may you

god make it real to us as we commit the service into your hands lord we pray lord for the scripture reading may be a blessing of father god jesus and we'd find good crown lord i just want to commit this service in two hands in the name of the lord jesus christ amen and amen amen greetings one more time church in the name of the lord jesus christ just to take this opportunity as well to greet the virtual convention in the name of the lord jesus christ we just want to thank you brother rather just thank brother theo over also for for the opportunity to be able to speak again uh a year ago is the first time i've done this for the virtual convention so we just thank uh you know we really appreciate i would say headstone tabernacle and uh brother theo's putting up this convention and we know that they blessing throughout the world and especially to us as at etmb and the ministry at stone brother theo brother isaac the different ministers there we pray that the lord may bless them as they labor in the field and i also want to you know greet the ministers that will be preaching and also greeting may the lord bless them as we all put our shoulder to the wheel special greeting as well to the uh the audience that will be on the livestream may the lord bless you and may you receive your portion let's just go to the word of god i want to invite you to three portions of scripture the first one is in the book of matthew chapter 4 and we'll read from verse 4. and then the second one is in second corinthians 10 we will read from verse 3 and then the final one ephesians 6 from verses 10 to 17. so brother theo's inspiration for the meetings i just want to read that so that we know exactly the theme it's a call to the battle and brother theo has got you know some of the the scripture readings and again obviously one of them being ephesians 6 to put on the whole armor of god and so the theme is a call to the battle so i'd like to start with the first scripture reading in matthew 4. if you found it in fact i'll read from verses three it reads as follows and when the tempter came to him he said if thou be the son of god command these stones be made bread but he answered and said it is written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god [Music] let's go to second corinthians 10. and we'll read from verses 3 for though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh for the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty through god to the pulling down of strongholds casting down imaginations and every high thing that exalted itself against the knowledge of god and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of christ the final one ephesians 6 this is a well-known scripture especially when we are called to the battle we'll read from verse 10 finally my brethren be strong in the lord and in the power of his might put on the whole armor of god that he may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places wherefore take unto you the whole armor of god that he may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand stand therefore having your loins gird about with truth and having on the breastplate of righteousness and your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace above all taking the shield of faith wherewith he shall be made wherewith he shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked now my message today is more focused around verses 17. and take the element of salvation and the sword of the spirit which is the word of god may the lord add a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated amen amen so just to take a title this morning it is written and that's the title and an inspiration that i've got is the word made manifest in you now i mean we know where the theme of the the convention is we know what the scriptures has already said the stage for what we're about to go into and if we are in a spiritual battle because the scripture says that we're not battling against flesh and blood but against principalities and powers now if we in a battle we know and we know the prophet preaches it we know where this battle started we know that it was a battle of of of angels and that battle has now become your and i bet your yours and mine on this earth and so the prophet preaches a message we say he calls it the conflict between god and satan and so you know where you stand why because the message of the hour came to identify you came to show you exactly where this battle started why we are still fighting and how it's going to end up so you clearly know who you are by the message of the hour you know who your adversary is you know who god is and that is what the message done for you so in other words it enabled you as a soldier of the cross in this day and age because all of the ages it has gone through was elect ones and they were the elect ones for their age but you are now the elect one for your day and now you are the one that has to take up the battle you are the one that has to put on the armor you are the one that will be doing the fighting why because the prophet says in the scripture says that they without us cannot be made perfect so you are you are drafted [Applause] into this war into this battle so let's go into it conflict between god and satan the prophet says there is going to be a conflict he says there was going to be a battle he says but god equipped his children with the right kind of ammunition he turns around in that message he says what ammunition or what did he give them he says he gave his children an atomic bomb or an atomic weapon what is that atomic weapon he says it gave them that to enable them to fight the fight in other words you will be able to take any kind of an attack he says so he enabled you the very same way if you are in a natural fight in a war you are enabled to be able to fight that war right so listen as we go on the prophet says he gave them this ammunition so that it would sweep them all the way from eden to the rapture and so we see that the the heavenly conflict it started and it had come down into eden that was the first time that they came head-to-head and as we go along you'll see it now the prophet says why did he give them that weapon now if you look at the armor most of what what what is described is almost like defensive but there's one item in there that is mentioned that's an offensive weapon so in other words the sword of the spirit and the scripture says which is the word of god and that is what you fight with because he says in in that same message he says when jesus himself came into end-to-end combat with satan what did he fight him with he fought him with the word and even though he had all of the power within him he says what did he do he used the same weapon that god gave in eden to fight him with and what did he fight him with it is written whenever he came with an attack it is written when he came with another attack it is written now in conflict between god and satan he says he punched him right out of the ring with it is written and that is what you are empowered with to fight the fight today now in that same message for every one of us you you you have the right he says every believer has the right to take this word he says and you can fight the enemy anywhere you meet him why because our chief captain that showed us how to fight him with it is written and he says if you're a believer you have the right to meet the enemy anywhere you see you you encounter him with it is written now conflict between god and satan he continues he says now when all when the all-out warfare comes and the battle is set in a ray there's only one thing a real soldier can use he says a real christian soldier can use his thus saith the lord thousands may fall on my right hand 10 000 on my left but they will not come nigh or they will not come near me it is written that they will not come near you and that's how you fight the battle in a message the greatest battle ever fought the prophet says soldiers pick up the word and then he says angels of mercy stay with the word [Applause] so he identified you so he's showing you exactly where this battle started but pick up the word soldiers now the prophet turns around in that message he says i will perish one day but the word can't perish he says you young people if i if it doesn't happen in my generation you will see this and what he's done was he's enabled us to be able to take the battle on because he's not going to be it's over 50 some odd years he's off the scene but he showed you how to fight the battle because the message came with the restoration of the word and when the restoration of the word came the restoration of the power amen give the lord and the praise let's move on now the prophet says that the coming of the lord is a battle in a message the uncertain sound he says if the trumpet makes an uncertain sound who will know to prepare for battle but the message of the hour came and it was a sound of distinction in other words that shout message was the trumpet going forth and saying prepare for battle that was the message the shout message was a sound of distinction so in other words it wasn't an uncertain sound it was a certain sound to prepare for battle what what did it say behold i will send you elijah the prophet before the great and dreadful day of the lord and what will he do he will turn the hearts of the children back to the pentecostal fathers so that message was to forerun the second coming of the lord and so if the the coming of the lord is a battle we have to be unable to fight to push it on to the coming of the lord now let's continue in conflict between god and satan we know how the prophet preaches as the word of the lord is a fortress then he says let's diagnose it down why did he give the word are you ready the congregation says amen [Applause] he turns he says the word is eternal and if god made a promise that is eternal then there's no nothing nowhere can stop it why am i am i let's give the lord and the praise he says they couldn't why because his word once it is given it cannot return unto him void but it must it shall accomplish the purpose that it was sent for now he says in that quote turn every atom upside down and turn it backwards you could never pierce the word of god not one little word jesus said both heavens and earth will pass away but my word shall never fail my my mind then he says that's the best weapon there is it's the word of the eternal god now if that is the fortress how do we get into this fortress first corinthians 12 by one spirit are we all baptized into one body and that body is the body of christ the prophet in conflict between god and satan he says then if you baptize into god that means then you are fortified with god and his word is your fortress scripture says he's a mighty tower where the righteous run into and they are safe [Applause] give me more volume dave i'm going to read the quote he says the name of the lord is a mighty tower the righteous run into it and are safe he's my fortress he's my buckle he's my shield my shoes my head my coat my heart my all in all god all in all he says wrap up in him i'm dead to the world i rose with him in the resurrection and that's the reason why we can say it's no more i that live but it's him that lives in you and i let's give the lord a praise amen we going well now let's go back and assist that first battle that happened on earth we go back to genesis chapter one and in a message wisdom versus faith the prophet says that faith was introduced and wisdom was introduced now we know that god is the author of faith because he gave that to his believing children in other words he gave that to them so that they could trust in his word satan came and satan gave them wisdom by reasoning and why did he do that to be able to get them away from the word of god and that is what he introduced but we come back in wisdom versus faith now remember the scripture our warfare is not carnal but it's mighty and it's supposed to be casting down all reasoning and that is what satan introduced to attack the word so we are to pull down the strongholds of satan so what does that mean and if god had introduced that to his children in the beginning we are to continue in faith we are to continue with faith because the book of hebrews says without faith it's absolutely impossible to please god and that's what he gave his children in his word for that reason abel by faith which is a revelation offered unto god a more excellent sacrifice all of the patriarchs enoch by faith walked with god until he hit the eternal highway abraham by faith walked with uh believed in god's word that he will receive a son and you can go on and on and on moses by faith jacob by faith all of the patriarchs by faith the church ages by faith you and i by faith because that was what was given in the beginning so we know that satan attacked the word by reasoning in conflict but god can't give nothing else but his word because that's what he chose first and when god makes the decision has to ever remain that way so satan took reasoning took reasonings and attacked the word and it shook eve off her path he says that's right because he introduced human reasonings so we know what happened with that battle that's right we knew know that eve lost that bet why because she relied on the wisdom that was given to her by reasoning or trying to reason god's word and we know that she broke the front line and that's when the enemy came rushing in and what did he introduce it struck the world with death and so since that time the battle has been raped [Applause] but god has prepared these people my mama let's be lord and please most of this is in conflict between god and satan [Applause] let's continue in any warfare you never underestimate your enemy he says we know that satan is way more than a match for any human being why he's got over 6 000 years of experience he says that's the reason why jesus and jesus jesus knew that he says that's the reason why he sent the church a place to be fortified by he sent them the holy ghost in other words jesus sent himself to confirm his word a little while the world will see me no more but you will see me why because i the prophet says personal pronoun will be with you even in you until the end of time so he gave himself as the weapon so what is the word of god again i'm still in conflict between god and satan he says the word of god is god himself saint john 1 1 god gave the believer himself and if we are born into the wood that means that he's standing right in the forefront of his children so so so go back to the scripture then great is he that's in you then he that's in the world so who's really fighting this battle [Music] the battle is not yours the battle is the lord's he's the one that's fighting the battle for you my my my man greatest battle ever fought we all know this quote the great hour of charge is at end hallelujah soldiers with armors gleaming colors streaming faith and doubt is set before is setting yourself in a ray in this tabernacle this morning he says doubt is on the one side faith is on the other soldiers stand at your post of duty hallelujah our captain the morning star leads on he never goes back no he don't know the word retreat [Music] to be led by this chief captain he says he don't have to retreat the greatest battle ever fought she is going on right in here now it's between life and death it's between sickness and health between faith and doubt oh my brethren liberty and bondage the battle is on shine your spear soldiers put on the armor god is getting his soldiers ready and listen to this last comment he says god anoints his army [Applause] he anoints his army with his own spirit now the armies are dressed with protective gear this chief captain anoints his army now anoint is to be covered in a consecrated oil which is spiritual and not of the flesh and so this is the word of god we read through the previous quotes he says he himself comes into them to confirm his own word so it's not even you it's he himself that anoints his army my mama let's give the lord and praise the greatest battle ever thought we have to receive the word through our mind because we are free moral agent exactly our agency like adam and eve was we are made of body spirit soul and the prophet and greatest battle ever fought shows you exactly and we know how that we have the five senses for the outer part five senses and the spirit and on the inside is your soul now in the soul they can only be one of two things it can't be both [Music] in other words faith and doubt can't co-exist so in the soul you have to have faith or you have doubt but the scripture says that we receive faith by hearing the word of god then he says now if we have our five senses of taste field smell here and if they disagree with the word of god he says don't listen to it why because the devil can use this against you then he says the five senses of the spirit which is imaginations conscious memories reasoning affection if they disagree with the word of god don't listen to it why because the devil can use that against you so we receive it through our minds he says into your spirit and the main thing is to let it drop on the inside so that he can thunder from there and he says it clears out the channels outbound so then it clears out the channels of the spirit clears out the channels of the five senses and then it's god speaking then it is god's faith in you believing his word and making it come to pass making it manifest now greatest battle ever 40 says you and i he says in that quote we're living in the time now we're culture education and a lot of things are smothered over the word of god he prays greatest battle in 62. now think about it the prophet is off the scene for over 50 some odd years he says the battle is now then he says look what a great opposition is out yonder now think about it if it is so much many more years since then till now how much of this has been going on creeping on because it's about culture it's about education it's about man's wisdom it's about acceptance because now you have to i don't even want to say same many of those things but then the prophet in that court says god wants men and women this morning who can raise up and that will say i'll take the word of god he says god's army is moving forward what are they they are men of fellow they are men of faith they are men of power he says you don't even have to be smart you don't even have to be educated he says all you have to be is be a channel for this battle that makes it so much easier it clears it up [Applause] all you have to be in this battle as a soldier as a warrior in the front line is be a channel he says god takes those channels oh god takes those little channels and he thunders out from there he just sits it sets it in order now i want to continue on this thought because we have to get the mind of god now he says your mind accepts it that's what grasps it what is your mind controlled by your spirit and your spirit catches the word of god and that's the thing that's got life in it my mind scripture says he says his word my word is spirit it brings life into you oh brother when that takes place he says when life comes down that channel into you the word of god is manifested in you [Music] if he abide in me and my words abide in you then ask what you will and it will be done bye [Applause] now it's your mind that opens up the door or closes the door it's your mind that will listen to your conscience it will listen to your memory it listens to your affections but when your mind closes itself to these things and let god the spirit of his word come in he says it blows the rest of the stuff out every doubt is gone every fear is gone every sensation of doubt is gone every feeling is gone he says there's nothing standing in there but the word of god now listen to this and satan cannot battle against that my mind let's give the lord another place he cannot battle against it no sir he cannot battle against it now we know that that's true let's continue so what does he want in greatest battle ever thought he says god wants his children to separate themselves what do you need to separate yourself from them he says from sea taste smell conscious memories reasonings affections separate yourself from those he says and open up your mind and let the word of god come in and then he says then you march with the word he says that is a real soldier a real soldier that can separate himself from those senses and take the word and march with the word the word will make it come to pass why because it's the word made manifest in you so you almost have to do nothing but belief greatest battle ever fought as a soldier in this army you are duty-bound to carry out the captain's let's give the orders enterprise if you are drafted into this army you are duty-bound to carry out the chief captain's orders the greatest battle ever fought he said what is the captain's orders it is written if they lay hands on the sick they shall recover that's the captain's orders it is written in my name shall they cast out devils that's the captain's orders [Applause] it is written whosoever heareth my words believes on me that's that on him that sent me has everlasting life that is the captain's orders and as a soldier you carry out the captain's orders he says that is the soldier james 4 7 says resist the devil and you won't just walk from you he won't just jog away from you but he will flee and flee is run you'll be running away like he's running away from a wild fire why because you are only carrying out the captain's orders give a lot and praise amen now let's look at the battle of matthew 4 we know what happened with the battle in genesis 1. genesis chapter 1 matthew 4 satan comes and he tempts jesus now the prophet says he came with the very same attack he doesn't change his tactics he came with the same attack that he started with eve lust of the flesh loss of the eye pride of life now think about how jesus had dealt with it he had all power in other words if he dramatized it in this way he had at his command the angelic angels they were that day standing ready swords drawn looking from the eternal dimension into time and just waiting for an order and they could change the whole sea in the blinking of an eye [Applause] now the prophet turns around he says but how did he fight that fight [Music] he said satan comes with him in the first attack and he says well you are human being you are hungry and if you don't eat you're going to die if you are the son of god why don't you take these stones and turn them into bread jesus turns around and says to him it is written that man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god [Applause] he comes at him and again now the prophet in that message says remember if he can't get you away from the word he's gonna come at you with a supernatural attack he takes him up to the pinnacle of the of the of the the the temple and says to him why don't you throw yourself down because the scriptures these angels will keep will carry or will take charge of you but he says then to him it is written you will not tempt the lord your god [Applause] now what was he doing there what was he doing there in other words he was telling him okay you want to stay with the word but the word says if you press your foot against the stone you will give his angels charge now the prophet says what was he doing he was misplacing the word he was dislocating the word and for that very reason he wasn't quoting the word to jesus he was quoting it and that's what he done with eve [Applause] he says he was just putting a bit of icing over it he was trying to white wash it but jesus knew and satan did not know that this was the very word made flesh and that's why he said he said he wasn't dashing his stone against his foot against the stone don't tempt the lord your god so don't misplace it don't dislocate it and then he turns around in harvest time he says this is the very same stage that eve fell in other words for a supernatural understanding satan offered a supernatural understanding in other words uh you won't surely die because you is you his children why would god kill you but if you eat of this fruit you will have knowledge in other words you will be like god you will know the difference between good and evil now he says in harvard's time she surely received the education but because of that death was introduced into the world he says but god showed how to fight the battle don't tempt the lord your god [Applause] his final attack takes him up to the top of the mountain shows him all the kingdoms of the earth this is all mine if you only bow down and worship he says now jesus being the word knew that this would all you would fall into all of this at the end and said to him finally get behind me satan for it is written you shall worship the lord your god and him only shall you serve no other god no other worship my worship only belongs to him the chief captain let's give the lord and a praise amen now you must believe that the very same way he says when you take god's word know for certain that your faith is going to be put to a test just like noah's faith was put to a test in a message the comforter he says that noah for 120 years was tested his faith in the word of god was tested in that message he says but noah found comfort in the word of god now how do you know it's going to rain brother noah god said so that's all noah had what did they have they could prove to him well noah how certain are you that there's water up there because we in our scientific civilization which is what they had could prove to him that there's no moisture up there but what did noah have god said so he says he found comfort in the word of god now remember the scripture says without faith it's impossible to please god now like noah remember we are never he says don't stop to reason it out he says as soon as you try to reason it that is when the devil comes now remember you cannot reason god he says you can't even understand god all you have to do is believe god abraham's faith was tested and and in greatest battle ever what he said he denied everything that was contrary to what god's word said but they could prove to him your wife is past the age of childbearing in the face of that he denied it they could say to him but abram that's your wife who is now past child bearing age in a youth could not even conceive she was barren so how is this even going to happen you an old man your seed is dried up in your house it's going to happen abraham held on to god's word now the scripture says that he staggered not at the promise of god through unbelief but grew strong in faith giving glory to god so then we come to you have to have a strong hand of faith to handle the sword [Applause] faith is our victory tyrus comes to the master jesus the word made flesh says to jairus if you only believe you can see the glory of god [Applause] tyrus's servant runs up to him and says to him jairus don't bother the master anymore your daughter has died so what we should be doing is we need to go home and go make funeral arrangements but cyrus was more determined to know what the word in flesh had to say so in faith is our victory he says then what does that mean it means that faith overcomes this why because for jairus faith is the victory over death why because even though death had set in it was almost it was final but he remembered what the word in flesh said to him he said to him if you only believe you will see the glory of god and he received his daughter from the dead now faith is a victory over sin woman weighs your accusers this was the word made flesh [Applause] go and sin no more he says faith is the victory over sickness the roman centurion coming to the word made flesh and said to him master i'm not even worthy that you come into my house only speak the word and my servant will be made whole faith was the victory over sickness for him and he received his servant from the sickbed faith is our victory faith is a conqueror it isn't a peacemaker it overcomes faith is a victory that overcomes the world he says what does it do what is faith it's a conqueror conquer and victory is the same to conquer means to beat down it means to override it means to handcuff and to throw into prison it means that the son that once ruled you you rule it now it means that you have overcome it you you've whipped it in other words you are greater than it is the prophet in that quote says oh i feel religious right now let's give the lord a praise what was jesus the word made flesh and he showed to us when he came into contact with death death could not stand in his presence when he came into contact with sickness sickness could not stand in his presence and the prophet in perfect faith he says from him was flowing rivers of virtue he says it was going out constantly and for that real purpose it almost it anointed his garment that the woman who with a strong hand of faith in the word could touch the hem of his garment and her blood issue was made whole she operated the world with a strong hand of faith and virtue that was flowing from me like rivers had gone down to his garment and she was able to operate the world with a faith and made a blood issue stop now if that was jesus why was he so successful the prophet says he knew who he was he knew his position now the very same way he knew who he was you and i as soldiers of this end time have to know who you are if the bride will only know who she is and the prophet says she will one day and the rapture will go so who he knew he was he identified himself in the scriptures the prophet says in a message wisdom versus faith he know that he was that son of god that was to come into the world he knowed his standing he know he was born in the world for a purpose that's the reason the word of god could work through him [Applause] and he knew what he was he says he was a predestinated creature of time the very same way you and i are a predestinated creature of time we come from the very same source that he had come from so in other words you have to know who you are jesus and talking about that body knew that he was the predestinated word of god the person of god and that knew that he was to stand in that day and he was to be the sacrifice for sin in that day he knew his adversary he knew who he was he knew that he was the anointed one for the day [Music] and that's the reason why he could fight him wisdom versus faith it continues now remember if you plant the seed you're expecting the life of that seed to produce itself so in other words if i plant a potato a potato will produce itself and if you and i are soaked with the seed of the of god in our hearts it's got to produce god because that's the seed that was sown [Music] he that believeth on me the works that i do shall you do also [Applause] now that's the reason in spoken word is the original seed the prophet said i've been zealous of the kind of seed that i have sowed for the body why because the real rain is coming and the reason why it's so dead son of man see is because he says when the rain comes it has to have seed to fall on and if that happens it will be the living word in other words that see that becomes the living word in you and i in the body of christ the very same way it became the living word in the flesh of jesus then the word will be made flesh once again the word may manifest in his bright body that's the reason why the prophet was zealous of the kind of seed that you are suing for the body because the rain the dynamics there to have seed to fall on and that seed has the life [Applause] to produce sons and daughters of god not denominationalism not pentecostalism he says but he produces sons and daughters of the almighty god the living word let's give the lord a praise amen perfect faith he says have faith in what the word says that you are jesus had faith in the word of god that said what he was it is written of me i am the bread of life that came from god out of heaven jesus was certain of who he was and he says you need to be you you need to come to that he says i am the tree of life from the garden of eden i am all these things he said i am i am and he was the anointed messiah that the spirit of god was upon him he said i in myself do nothing but it's my my faith in god and god was in him the word made manifest and when the word of god comes in you it's made manifest for you are the believer so in other words you are that word pride now if he said that he is the bread of life let's look at what the bread of life is says i am he said to them i am the bread of life and he said this to them at the feast of the passover the prophet says in harvest time he says he said this to them when they were eating their kosher bread commemorating the manner that fell in the wilderness but he said to them but i am the bread of life your fathers ate that man in the wilderness but they are all dead he says but i am the bread that had come down from heaven from god out of heaven and if a man eats of this bread he will not die [Applause] he said to them i am the rock that was in the wilderness that your fathers drank from [Applause] before abraham was i am [Music] he was the i am that was in the polar fire that had spoken to moses in other words i am the present tense all the time that was him so if he's the bread of life that's the bread of life that we are to feed on in order to live harvest time now remember you will judge the church by their attitude towards christ who is the word [Applause] man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god he says not out of the mouth of man not out of a seminary not out of a church he says but out of the mouth of god in harvest time he says man must live by that and that alone he says no man's interpretation by god's own word which is him my my my let's get lord and praise i'm almost there now saint john 1 1 in the beginning was the word in harvest time the prophet says he was the word and he also said that he wants the bread in our time he says then the word and the bread has to be the same he says because jesus is the word and he said that he's the bread now we know that the wheat bread in other words for you and i to live he says man shall not we live in the natural by a wheat bread and that weed is a substance or living substance that dies so that you can live in other words to sustain this body we live by dead substance so in other words if you're eating the fruit or if you're eating vegetables that's a it's a living substance that dies in order to sustain you in order to keep this body alive now in harvest time he says there's two kinds of life that we have to sustain by eating he says the one is natural the one is spiritual if something had to die so that we could live physically how much more did something have to die so that we could live eternally we know that the wheat dies and jesus said that he is the word bread and he is the one that had to die so that you could live eternally he is or he was the word bread right now he is the word that we are to live by harvest time he continues now he says it's not our good living and here he's addressing he says it's not you as a moral person or a good christian it's not even that he says many people can can live a moral life by choosing it and he says it's not even how loyal you are to your church organization he says but the main thing is staying with the word now think of this [Applause] the rich young ruler comes to christ he says to him i'm a good person you could prove it he says lord i've kept all of these commandments from my youth i go to church regularly i pay my tithes but he says it's how you can stay with the word but when the word in flesh told him take what you have go and sell it and give it to the poor and come and follow me he turned away from the word sorrowful he could prove that he was a good christian but it's how you stay with the word you could not stay with that word and turned away sorrowful now if he is that wheat grain in other words in harvest time the prophet says jesus was that corn of wheat that had fallen to the ground he says it was a good grain he says it was free from faults it was free from failure it was a thoroughbred grain this is the prophet he says jesus was that corn of wheat that fell to the ground he's the one that was made perfect that grain had life in it he says moses had died and could not rise again and all generations from adam was laid to the to the into the dust of the earth and did not rise that green they had life in it he's the one that said put him into put this laid his body down put it into a grave and i will raise it up again in three days and he was that first of the resurrection a new creation and so if that's the new creation if that's the cone of wheat we are to live by that bread if you want to live eternally now remember there's life inside the seed and scripture says that that this life which is spirit if the water flows over that seed it will bring the life of the seed the spirit of god comes forth and it waters that seed and it's the seed or the watering of the seed that will produce the life of the seed and so we see in harvest time he says how jesus is the word bread he says it means to be fed on if he is the word bread you are to feed on it because man shall not live by the physical bread he is the brethren that come down from god out of heaven he says keep this in mind that this is the same bread that the church through every age has fed on harvester the prophet says it has been the hidden manner just for the overcomer only in other words for each and every age he had given the wheat bread the word bread that they had fed on now in you and i and my age he is the one that we feeding on we are not feeding on a man but we are feeding on the unfailing body word of the son of man that's the hidden manner that we are to feed on my my my let's give the lord and the praise i'm almost there he says and he uses the scripture in that means in that message where he says now you know of having the form of godliness but denying the power thereof then he says now he he almost explains it and he says now what is that power he says the power is the word made manifest in other words just like paul it said the gospel did not come unto you and i in word only but it came through power and demonstration of the spirit in that message the prophet says i'm speaking of the army of god now fortified so in other words if the army of god is fortified then it's the power and then the power that they have is the word made manifest [Applause] in them you're catching a church now let's look at what happened in the on the day of pentecost in to take on the arm of god he says peter put on the whole arm of god on the day of pentecost he says what was it it was that same word that peter had walked with it was the very same word that peter had talked with it was the very same word that peter had fished with it's the very same word that peter had was on the campaign trail with in other words he was walking with the word and when he put on the armor it was the same word now in him the prophet says it was burning him up with fire in his flesh and in his soul then he turns around he says he had the whole armor of god on so what did that mean it's meant that god was making himself ever-present in his own army and on the day of pentecost he sent down the full armor of god for his army so what was it peter was anointed with the armor of god and he says what is that army it's god ever present in his army and that's the word being made manifest in you and i yeah let's give the lord a praise and if he's ever present in his army then it's he's the one that will go with you and then it's the same not it's not you that speak but it's the father that dwelleth in me because when the word was made manifest in him it was the father that dwelleth in me and all that the father was he poured into the sun all that was in the sun is now put into his church which is his bright body and now it means that you are anointed with the armor and so then it's exactly what we we know these quotes then you speak the mind of god and what you speak manifest itself why because it's the ever-present god in his army making himself known making himself manifest let's give the lord and the praise the scripture says i will not leave you comfortless but i personal pronoun will come to you and i personal pronoun will be with you even in you and so then the same way that mary when she accepted the word it brought forth a manifestation of the word in flesh and then to you and i these signs will these signs shall follow them that believe let's give the lord and the praise amen i'm almost there harvest time god looking down at jesus when the word was made flesh he says he put the dove on him in other words he claimed that part of the earth because just like you and i he was a hundred percent human the prophet says he says but when god had sent down the dove he was claiming that part of the earth jesus ate the same kind of food that you would eat in hours time he says he ate the natural bread because he had to also sustain that body he says but when god had claimed that flesh in other words where god had claimed that part of the earth he says and he will claim this part your earth the very same way he claimed that earth nothing was going to hold it he says not even death could hold it that's why he said destroy this temple and i'll raise it up again now he says then in harvest time when the man and the woman goes into god he says really when the word and him becomes one in other words when the flesh becomes the word and the word becomes flesh then he claims this part of the earth for his own glory the way he claimed that part of the earth and then that earth is cleansed how did he cleanse by his own blood he sanctified his body and he'll use that earth the same way he redeems it in other words he will use this earth the very same way he used that over 2000 years ago for his own glory [Music] so we come to the realization that we will live by the word of god [Music] as soldiers in the army we will live by the word of god the very same way that peter said to jesus lord we toiled all night we know that we put the net down on the left net down on the right but nevertheless at thy word at thy word lord and then every divine promise of god to you and i will produce exactly what it was sent forth why because you will have the right mental attitude [Music] to every promise of god and the right mental attitude will bring it to pass so at thy will let's give let's just restart and stop it i'm done the musicians can come by my mind let's give the lord an appraisement amen this powerful word nevertheless lord at thy word will we do this to take on the armor of god he says again he said i will pray the father that he will send you another comforter which is the holy ghost he will abide with you forever the prophet says what is that he says it's the words it's god's artillery in the human being it's manifesting the resurrection now the prophet says think about this it's god's artillery in the human being and what is that it is manifesting the resurrection now if that is god and if remember the great he is the mighty conqueror the prophet says he's the one who conquered sickness he's the one who conquered superstition he's the one who conquered every giant he's the one who conquered everything that there was on the earth to be conquered he says he's the one who conquered hell [Music] he's the one who conquered death he's the one who conquered the grave and he's the one who had conquered the prophet says the atmosphere ascended up on high and it come back in the form of his holy spirit and what is it now now we are more than conquerors through him who loved us why because he sent himself who is this king of glory the lord mighty in battle the prophet says he is the mighty conqueror he's the one who conquered death he's the one who conquered hell he conquered the grief and if he's the one that's in you then you are more than a conqueror let's give the lord and praise amen [Applause] the prophet says oh what an army he says like a mighty army marches the christian soldier he said great triumph he is in us not me he has already conquered it i don't have then he says to do a thing but just believe and walk on for he is risen his spirit is in us the great victory the resurrection presence is in us this is in to take on the whole armor of god now the prophet says in return and jubilee the word is the voice of god then the church will hear the word of god they'll turn every creed down they'll turn every organization every denomination that's contrary they'll serve god by the power of the holy ghost they certainly know the trumpet sound [Music] why because my sheep hear my voice and a stranger they will not follow he says what are you talking about he says the word you say that's god's voice yes it is in the beginning was the word in the word was with god and the word was god and the word was made flesh dwelt among us my sheep hear that they know it a stranger they will not follow [Applause] and so you and i are now this body that he had prepared a body is now prepared for me for sacrifices and offerings thou who does not but a body as thou prepared me he turns around and he says a body of believers and that is the reason why the body has been prepared because it's god dwelling in her in other words the battle is on it's the coming of the lord the coming of the lord is shout voice trump the shout went forth it was a certain sound it prepared us for battle and now he is the one that will step into it and continue it and push it on to the coming of the lord in putting on all armor of god now he says you take the sword of god with faith and cut your way through he says to any promise that god made for you if sickness stands in your way cut it out of the way that's god's promise if sun is standing in your way cut it out of the way he says you've got on the whole armor if the devil shoots his darts at you knock it out he says keep on cutting on with christian soldiers marching as to war with the cross of jesus going on before now [Music] the chief captain's orders it is written hold your position we have the answer to the devil's question the prophet says the word is already in the brain and the mind of christ to know what he once done with the word may the lord bless you give him a praise amen brother given [Applause] [Music] there is power [Music] so i know that there is power the name of jesus to break every chain break every chain break every
