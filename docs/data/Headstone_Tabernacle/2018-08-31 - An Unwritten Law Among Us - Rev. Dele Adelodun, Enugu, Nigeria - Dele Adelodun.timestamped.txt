[42:03] serpent if you then being evil know how
[42:07] to give good gifts unto your children
[42:09] how much more shall your father which is
[42:12] in heaven give good things to them that
[42:15] ask em you believe that the tirana main
[42:21] chapter 30 Deuteronomy 30 verse 19 13:19
[42:45] this was one of the Moses valedictory
[42:50] message he said I called heaven and
[42:55] earth to record this day against you
[42:58] that I have such before you life and
[43:02] death blessing and cursing therefore
[43:06] choose life that both thou and I seed
[43:11] may leave
[43:11] may the Lord Artus blessings to the
[43:15] reading of its only word god bless you
[43:18] you may be seated while how will remain
[43:21] standing
[43:30] I'd like to welcome every one of you in
[43:34] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and we
[43:38] thank the Lord for giving us another
[43:40] opportunity again to be in Henoko
[43:43] and to also be in the Fellowship of
[43:48] brethren of like precious faith I want
[43:53] to appreciate precious brother Charles
[43:57] for giving me this privilege to be of
[44:06] service to God's people is that the
[44:11] bridegroom and waiting wonderful I
[44:14] thought you were too busy with
[44:15] preparation
[44:17] god bless you brother Hartnell yeah yeah
[44:20] so I was thanking the pastor for giving
[44:23] me this privilege to be of service
[44:26] before God's people trusting to God that
[44:29] somewhere along the line we can be of a
[44:32] blessing and I bring greetings from home
[44:37] from Pastor and all the ministers the
[44:42] officers the entire congregation they
[44:45] are sending accretions I do not bring
[44:48] the greetings of my wife because he's
[44:50] here with force together so as many as
[44:56] he has opportunity to greet she will
[44:58] greet them home but I'm bringing those
[45:01] of my children the alum to be here for
[45:06] what we also have a family function of
[45:10] somebody very close to also at pass up
[45:13] listed around the house for sometimes
[45:17] she's getting married this weekend it
[45:19] would have been important for us to also
[45:21] be there but somehow because they're
[45:24] spiritual people you understand why we
[45:26] have to be here so we have delegated and
[45:29] donated some of our children to who
[45:34] lest we create offense
[45:37] let me also use this opportunity to
[45:40] thank the Trinidad team for the
[45:43] wonderful time we had they give us and
[45:46] when we are in Trinidad
[45:49] [Applause]
[45:52] maestro a few of it was such a wonderful
[45:55] world and brother heizak they give us
[45:59] the best treatment anybody any guest
[46:03] could wish for around there so may Allah
[46:05] bless you bless mama
[46:07] bless my dear sister I will welcome me
[46:10] for comment thank you for my part of the
[46:17] theme of the convention I was meditating
[46:20] on it and even the host pastor was
[46:25] sharing some of his thoughts around that
[46:26] with me it's cause they would make a
[46:30] bride eros and I was thinking of it and
[46:35] 30 years we thank the Lord for the
[46:38] servants of the Lord whom God has used
[46:40] for us today and we thank the Lord for
[46:43] the blessings they've made the thoughts
[46:46] that they have brought to us may the
[46:48] Lord bless yourselves god bless you sir
[46:50] god bless you sir so my my thought was
[46:57] running along the line of what past week
[47:00] he said that for you to be an hero
[47:03] you've got to be victorious amen and I
[47:07] know that one of these days something
[47:10] will provoke victory for the bride of
[47:14] Jesus Christ brother Bram said and the
[47:19] message look away to Jesus he said in
[47:22] this spiritual race the permit me to use
[47:27] some words just like this so you can
[47:30] pick it it's like two vehicles that are
[47:33] running side by side and you wonder
[47:36] which one is running faster it's about
[47:38] in this spiritual raise the vehicle of
[47:41] the message of the hour
[47:42] run far ahead of that of the Antichrist
[47:47] it's at what we are doing now is slowing
[47:50] down and that is why it looks like this
[47:54] in-law of this law of that but there is
[47:57] actually no law it's a part of God's
[48:00] program after MIT Reviver Jesus took
[48:04] time to rest on the boat and the
[48:06] disciples were saddled with given
[48:09] testimonies of what are taking place
[48:12] amen but then something happens the
[48:15] storm came and it provoked Jesus to be
[48:18] called back on the same so that is why
[48:22] it will look like maybe things are slow
[48:26] in the economy of the bride it's
[48:29] actually not slow it's all the walking
[48:32] of God's program we are given great
[48:36] testimonies of the visitation of God in
[48:38] these last days but one of these days
[48:43] the Prophet said we are waiting for this
[48:47] Antichrist automobile to catch off is
[48:50] that when it catches up is a watch the
[48:54] tarpaulin is that what you see
[48:56] temporarily manifested now will come in
[49:00] its fullness so nothing is out of Quetta
[49:07] friends but so that this roof of this
[49:11] hour will note that a bridegroom is
[49:14] still in our midst and full of purpose
[49:16] on purpose like Boz was given a gift
[49:20] commandment to the young man is that for
[49:23] this lady she has served so well every
[49:26] once in a while give up on us so these
[49:30] bonuses will be going on all the time so
[49:33] miracles signs and wonders he means
[49:35] deliverances great things will still be
[49:38] taking place it might not be in the
[49:41] quantity of your expectation but the law
[49:43] we prove that is still in the midst of
[49:45] this bride
[49:47] all the time so we severe a regime of
[49:53] the Antichrist tightening up and that
[49:55] you wind up to such a time that it will
[49:58] provoke what is in hush and then you
[50:02] will know that God is quite literally
[50:04] since on heroes and some champions you
[50:08] are not going to live here without some
[50:10] sort of display because god bless you
[50:17] god bless you
[50:18] I'm just giving you beautiful comfort
[50:21] you aren't going to live here without
[50:23] some sort of display this is the seventh
[50:25] age we are back to the feast of as we
[50:29] rose again you know as well as was one
[50:32] of the richest King ever known he had
[50:35] control brother Isaac over 127
[50:38] prophecies
[50:39] I don't know of any country that has one
[50:41] run 27 states eh all right even
[50:44] addressed it has got 52 or 50 what
[50:47] all right now what this man ruled over
[50:49] 127 and for six months the Bible said it
[50:54] was dis plain is worth and nobody saw
[50:58] the same thing twice he had so much to
[51:02] show for six months then after the six
[51:06] months displayed it decided to have a
[51:09] feast time for seven days I you
[51:13] spiritual
[51:14] so it fits there it will tell the guys
[51:18] you haven't seen nothing yet because
[51:22] this King had in his mind that on the
[51:25] seventh day his greatest treasure is
[51:28] going to be displayed that greatest
[51:37] treasure isn't his auto mobile isn't
[51:41] this beautiful palace the greatest
[51:43] treasure of Oz Arras was his bride
[51:56] vasee a type of the Pentecostal church
[51:59] refused as well as that display that was
[52:04] what introduced Esther somebody who
[52:07] looks like a stranger to the economy
[52:11] think about the blessings of the Jews
[52:14] becoming the blessings of the Gentile
[52:23] sorry I have not started my message
[52:26] tonight Alleluia so anyhow esta in blood
[52:34] Providence because it must choose a time
[52:36] was selected among the visions that will
[52:40] appear for consideration now each of
[52:43] these virgins when they came near agar
[52:47] agar was the Kings Chamberlain who is
[52:50] the preparer of vigils when they and the
[52:56] man was made an eunuch so that it cannot
[53:00] interact in that manner with any of
[53:03] these girls so if we have a negative a
[53:06] it never gave us a seat it never give us
[53:09] his torch it never gave us his opinion
[53:11] he never gave us his idea all right all
[53:17] right all right that which I received
[53:22] from the Lord like Paul says the same i
[53:25] delivered
[53:29] that was what is like ID now but a guy
[53:33] doesn't fuse with no man it gives you
[53:38] what you want so each of them were
[53:42] common with the opinion of what they
[53:44] taught we make them acceptable to the
[53:46] king and a guy was given it anything you
[53:50] want with this last is a guy you will
[53:52] get because it represents the only
[53:57] lights left and is got or shine upon the
[54:00] tears and upon the railways there are no
[54:03] two songs just one Sun as um it doesn't
[54:09] change the seats that you have it only
[54:12] transformed that same seat to come to
[54:15] its maturity whatever sit whether good
[54:18] or bad you need sunlight this is why
[54:23] Judas Iscariot had to come and be with
[54:27] Christ I think it will be wrong for us
[54:30] to suggest that Christ never knew who
[54:33] Judas was from day one it will be very
[54:36] wrong he knew him and his role is very
[54:41] important his induction into a posture
[54:45] ship was not by accident because their
[54:49] role is to fulfill pizza cannot do it
[54:52] and it is unnecessary if you and I will
[54:55] be here
[54:56] to rejoice our salvation so I knew it
[54:59] and they put him there and this guy
[55:02] needed Jesus in other for the seat in
[55:06] him to come through different
[55:08] developmental stages toward it is that
[55:11] equal fulfill its purpose
[55:19] just as Peter needed him even just as
[55:23] you needed him
[55:24] we all need him French that was why the
[55:30] dynamics of blood Pizza Judith and
[55:32] everyone was in the hand of the same
[55:34] person when Judas Iscariot became a
[55:37] ripened by Jesus assessment
[55:39] he gave him an inspiration that which
[55:42] they'll do it too quickly and when he
[55:46] gave that message only Judas understood
[55:49] it in the context in which it was given
[55:57] so French all this I don't know how many
[56:01] of them agree maybe 1,000 ladies were
[56:03] many they were they all gathered
[56:04] together and they were asking for this
[56:07] for that for this and a guy was dishing
[56:09] it out but the Bible made a remark when
[56:12] it came to the time of Esther the Bible
[56:15] said Esther required nothing as such
[56:19] what a guy in his own wisdom so she
[56:25] wasn't leaning on our own understanding
[56:28] she has dropped a passionate belief she
[56:31] wasn't living by our opinion she had a
[56:34] testimony like a posture paul i live by
[56:38] the faith of the Son of God so it would
[56:44] be like a guy you know the King better
[56:47] you are closer to the king you know what
[56:50] he likes you know what it doesn't lie
[56:53] whatever you think you give it to me
[56:56] there was only one man in this age who
[56:58] was closest to God they call him William
[57:02] Branham
[57:04] he said I was another one that appeared
[57:07] at Ohio River but I was the one nearest
[57:10] when he have here is that a man is what
[57:14] we fail you are not feeding on me
[57:17] body on the unfailing body words of the
[57:20] son of man only one man one day God was
[57:24] so happy with this man
[57:26] he gave him and Hoffa would you like to
[57:28] walk with me and hand in hand in the
[57:32] wilderness that we are walking together
[57:37] so it qualified by every standard to be
[57:41] the a guy of this hour he qualified to
[57:44] know what and what's that
[57:46] as well as of this our King Jesus what
[57:49] 'likes
[57:51] [Applause]
[57:53] so when Esther prepared herself by hey
[57:57] guys teaching and she appeared before as
[58:02] well she became the delight of us we
[58:06] rose because as well as who see is
[58:08] reflection in our and what Vashti lost
[58:15] Esther gains and she became the final
[58:19] display you know what I've just been
[58:21] doing since telling the story of your
[58:23] life
[58:28] so don't worry one of these days the
[58:31] vindication that you are ghost heroes
[58:33] for this hour will come to full
[58:35] manifestation I congratulate you all
[58:46] you love him tonight by the grace of God
[58:54] if the Lord would be over here which I
[58:57] trust he will I want to speak on a
[59:01] subject I called an unwritten law among
[59:05] us an unwritten law among us and not to
[59:12] keep you in suspense is not a big
[59:13] subject I'm just going to speak on
[59:15] choice a great thing yeah but the chance
[59:21] that wanted me to also join brother
[59:26] Heiser to have some time for a special
[59:30] service with the young people but I will
[59:36] be unavoidably absent from the
[59:39] convention from tomorrow because I'm
[59:42] locked into about three or four
[59:44] conventions within 10 days
[59:46] and so I covet your prayers as I travel
[59:49] to Zimbabwe tomorrow yeah so but then
[59:53] that is why I will not be able to make
[59:56] that who wanted something that way then
[59:58] the regular service but I was trusting
[1:00:02] God for what to do and I think I find a
[1:00:06] friendly middle point between death in
[1:00:09] the regular service so this is why I'm
[1:00:13] going to speak on choice tonight amen so
[1:00:17] the profit College an unwritten law
[1:00:19] among us in the message chosen of a
[1:00:23] bride all right now choice is a law of
[1:00:27] God like it says it's not written
[1:00:32] anywhere
[1:00:33] maybe sections codes and so forth and it
[1:00:39] affects our lives on a daily basis
[1:00:46] consciously we make choices and
[1:00:50] unconsciously we make choices we don't
[1:00:53] live in a day without making some form
[1:00:56] of
[1:00:56] choices as you are sitting here this
[1:01:01] evenin the dresses that you have on is
[1:01:05] not the only shirt or blouse or sketch
[1:01:08] that you have or suits that you have
[1:01:10] when you run through the Wardrobe and
[1:01:13] pick this one and leave the orders you
[1:01:16] have made a choice on that détente where
[1:01:20] we were invited to eat they have two or
[1:01:25] three varieties of meal when you pick
[1:01:29] the one you ate this evening and you
[1:01:31] left the others you've made a choice
[1:01:34] some of us all live outside the camp are
[1:01:38] the convention ground probably many
[1:01:42] routes or routes that leads to this
[1:01:44] place or even in traveling down when you
[1:01:48] play on one and left the others you have
[1:01:51] made a choice so it is what we do every
[1:01:55] day day in day out but that is not where
[1:01:59] I'm going
[1:02:00] we am going is to wake you to this
[1:02:03] consciousness that the choices we'll
[1:02:06] make have consequences and the
[1:02:14] consequences of some of the choice that
[1:02:16] we have made is the reason for who we
[1:02:19] are today the choices we make affect our
[1:02:23] yesterday it is affecting our today if
[1:02:28] there's a tomorrow the choices will make
[1:02:32] now we also affect our tomorrow and I
[1:02:36] think this is why we must give some sort
[1:02:38] of vent to the thought of choice when
[1:02:43] people are growing up they will come to
[1:02:45] a time they call a duel isn't years it
[1:02:50] is an age of self-discovery and one of
[1:02:54] the features of that time is to refuse
[1:02:58] to be told what to do and you will start
[1:03:02] hearing the people telling you look I'm
[1:03:05] old enough at least I've clocked a thin
[1:03:09] you should
[1:03:10] lama tsong some greats to take my
[1:03:15] decision it is inherent in man to always
[1:03:21] want to have his freedom to take
[1:03:23] decisions it is an energy man to always
[1:03:27] want to make his choices and God also
[1:03:32] understands - what I want to tell you
[1:03:35] something this evening that you're
[1:03:39] making a choice by yourself is actually
[1:03:43] disc complimentary to your creation
[1:03:48] excuse me you are not designed with the
[1:03:59] capacity to choose by yourself and be
[1:04:02] correct the Bible says in the beginning
[1:04:09] God placed man on free moral agency and
[1:04:16] that gives him the right to choose
[1:04:19] whatever he wants free moral agency is
[1:04:23] called the ability to make your choice
[1:04:26] without being interfered with whether
[1:04:29] divine or physical you can take your
[1:04:33] decisions and do what you want but there
[1:04:38] was a reason for which God gave man that
[1:04:42] right everything you see today as its
[1:04:50] origin before time way back in its
[1:04:52] eternity that is why our lives and
[1:04:56] whatever we do and what is happening to
[1:04:58] us there are no accidents in age in
[1:05:02] eternity God us to things he wanted to
[1:05:07] achieve
[1:05:08] brother bronzer added at the time of
[1:05:12] this discussion God wasn't even God
[1:05:19] we can call him hello him the one who
[1:05:23] exists by himself and it was just all
[1:05:27] alone to himself but inside the desire
[1:05:31] of this Elohim what's a desire inside
[1:05:35] this thought was a desire to be God the
[1:05:39] meaning of God is an object of worship
[1:05:43] so what we are saying that is that at
[1:05:46] this time nobody was worshipping him he
[1:05:50] has no hope he has no subject he has no
[1:05:52] worshipers but in him was that desire to
[1:05:57] be God are you following me
[1:05:59] now also in aim was a desire to be known
[1:06:05] beyond being God it doesn't just want to
[1:06:11] be God it wants to be known beyond being
[1:06:14] God because inside him where are the
[1:06:17] abilities so if you know him just as God
[1:06:22] and you don't know image and other
[1:06:24] abilities it will be so distant in
[1:06:27] relationship to us but there's a problem
[1:06:32] here these abilities of God by which it
[1:06:36] will want you to be known cannot take
[1:06:39] place as long as there is perfection
[1:06:46] so God is building a platform to eat his
[1:06:50] cake and to also have it back thus
[1:06:56] follow my story it will become clearer
[1:07:00] as we go God wanted to eat his cake and
[1:07:03] he also wants to have it back he wants
[1:07:07] to be known and with God and it wants to
[1:07:09] be known beyond being God what are these
[1:07:13] abilities in him the Prophet called them
[1:07:15] attributes for spiritual language and is
[1:07:19] there inside God was an attribute to be
[1:07:22] an illa a healer a deliverer a Savior
[1:07:28] and what does a redeemer goblin
[1:07:32] - I've got spiritual people here it's
[1:07:36] got all these abilities in him but as
[1:07:40] long as everything remains perfect there
[1:07:43] will never be a need for this attribute
[1:07:49] [Applause]
[1:07:50] we are still in eternity we have not
[1:07:53] come to time for you to know that the
[1:07:56] introduction of Satan into the program
[1:07:59] was not accidental if it was accidental
[1:08:02] then God is not in control of all
[1:08:06] factors of life then the one who cannot
[1:08:09] be in control of every factors of life
[1:08:12] is not qualified to be my god so this
[1:08:20] was why after I finished all these
[1:08:23] thoughts it designed a program to bring
[1:08:27] it to pass he created the angels
[1:08:31] heavenly beans and they started singing
[1:08:34] holy holy only unto the Lord his desire
[1:08:39] to be God is achieved if it never
[1:08:43] brought any creation beyond Earth is
[1:08:45] already God because there are now
[1:08:48] worshipers but some of the things that
[1:08:54] he also wanted to do cannot take place
[1:08:57] in eternity
[1:08:57] you know why eternity is perfect that
[1:09:01] was why when Lucifer became contaminated
[1:09:04] by iniquity even the Bible said and
[1:09:08] there was no more space for him or there
[1:09:11] it couldn't continue his tenor hope in
[1:09:14] heaven is got to be trimmed down because
[1:09:18] eternity is perfect and is all around us
[1:09:23] all the time
[1:09:24] so what did God do God created a loop
[1:09:29] out of eternity now the IT people can
[1:09:33] help us better they will tell us that
[1:09:35] this is the program for this chain for
[1:09:38] this chain and when they make
[1:09:40] presentation some people will do a
[1:09:42] critique and say what if this happen
[1:09:44] watching that upon that was okay we
[1:09:47] never thought of that boy you know what
[1:09:48] we don't need to cancel the program and
[1:09:51] start writing it all over what we'll do
[1:09:54] is that we create a loop out of the
[1:09:56] original program to take care of that
[1:09:58] matter and introduces back to the
[1:10:00] program God was the first IT specialist
[1:10:05] God was the first programmer
[1:10:08] God was the first that is still the
[1:10:10] first software developer and in his own
[1:10:17] case nobody after telling in you what
[1:10:19] you want and in knows what is doing
[1:10:22] friends I'm telling the story of your
[1:10:24] life all right so you know what you did
[1:10:28] it created a loop and that loop is
[1:10:31] called time then we started airing in
[1:10:34] the beginning God created heaven and
[1:10:37] heart God existed before that beginning
[1:10:42] what time was just a look out of God's
[1:10:46] eternal program to demonstrate is other
[1:10:49] tots and huh tribute so that when the
[1:10:52] days of such demonstration is over time
[1:10:56] we blend back into eternity
[1:11:01] so nothing is out of Keita nothing has
[1:11:05] ever been out of kata and nothing will
[1:11:08] ever be out of Peter it's our God Father
[1:11:13] in his program so on earth he brought
[1:11:21] all manner of creations than the last it
[1:11:25] brought forth a son now when a brought
[1:11:30] forth this son this son was like his
[1:11:32] cook out of him and that is what made
[1:11:35] him his son amen so this on the Prophet
[1:11:40] says his men are being brought off
[1:11:44] presented him as an original creation
[1:11:48] now it is impossible for original
[1:11:52] creation to create a condition that will
[1:11:57] make other attributes of God necessary
[1:12:02] underline that it is impossible because
[1:12:05] Adam came to the earth as God it scooped
[1:12:11] out of God when God baguettes a child or
[1:12:13] give birth it gives back to God by the
[1:12:17] law of reproduction let every seed bring
[1:12:20] forth after human gives back to human
[1:12:23] God gives birth to God that is why you
[1:12:28] need another birth and you can only be
[1:12:32] reborn because there's a gene of God in
[1:12:34] you which is called a seizure
[1:12:36] your new batch is the quickening of
[1:12:38] their gene Alleluia which we start
[1:12:42] forming Christ in you you love him
[1:12:44] tonight
[1:12:45] all right God brought for this man and
[1:12:48] they called him original creation
[1:12:51] because it came out of God now because
[1:12:55] of the process of his coming it can
[1:12:58] never ever sing
[1:13:04] it can never create a condition for the
[1:13:08] attributes or the attributes of God to
[1:13:10] be manifested so what did God do God
[1:13:14] decided not to bring his wife the way he
[1:13:19] brought his son all those things of
[1:13:23] reasons then the Prophet said he brought
[1:13:27] us as a by-product now that's not a
[1:13:31] derogatory word if you understand it
[1:13:33] it's just that we take something out of
[1:13:35] something that is already created the
[1:13:40] reason abroad in this formula is to be
[1:13:45] able God was setting the condition for
[1:13:48] those other attributes to come to pass
[1:13:51] tighten up a alright now when it
[1:13:55] brought for this man the Prophet search
[1:13:58] in other for him to be successful to
[1:14:03] fall to be able to fall he gave him this
[1:14:07] gift or this privilege or this right
[1:14:10] they call free moral agency the ability
[1:14:15] to make choices would have been
[1:14:17] interfered with then in order for the
[1:14:21] woman to be able to bring the fall
[1:14:26] because what happened was that Adam
[1:14:29] accepted the fall she never fell that's
[1:14:33] what the Bible said it was not deceived
[1:14:36] it was the woman that was deceived now
[1:14:40] I'm saying that God created that woman
[1:14:43] he brought up in a way that she could
[1:14:46] take the deception
[1:14:48] it wasn't also an accident and you can
[1:14:51] study marriage and divorce spoken word
[1:14:54] book and find out those things there you
[1:14:56] can begin from paragraph 152 on all
[1:14:59] right so a brother the professor a
[1:15:02] brought our even with some features
[1:15:04] which he as God in His Holiness cannot
[1:15:08] put in her oh yes because those fishes
[1:15:13] are perversion features
[1:15:15] and that is why she doesn't look like
[1:15:19] other females in creation as a matter of
[1:15:23] fact the Prophet said sit and give our
[1:15:26] shape that is what godly sisters do not
[1:15:29] get too conscious of their shapes that
[1:15:33] is like bloodless sisters don't we upon
[1:15:36] me inside dresses I hope that's not
[1:15:44] offensive if it's offensive forgive me
[1:15:49] and spend how us and the mirror looking
[1:15:53] at the contours and tones when you have
[1:15:57] that you exhibiting the features of a
[1:15:59] Papa Chet fellow the prophets that our
[1:16:09] beauty sorry I will step up some of my
[1:16:12] languages because I don't want lead to
[1:16:14] people to take wrong impression a beauty
[1:16:16] a shape a sex control they were all
[1:16:19] fence not undead to her by God and
[1:16:26] Dustin's were there for the purpose of
[1:16:29] being in the shape to bring their fall
[1:16:32] and that was why when the devil who has
[1:16:36] the knowledge of the principles of life
[1:16:39] came into sufferings and gave him that
[1:16:42] knowledge seven new you go true in the
[1:16:46] garden now the common of serpents into
[1:16:49] the picture in Canadian Satan was not
[1:16:53] also an accident this is rather
[1:16:55] professor and when Satan has brought to
[1:16:58] pass that which was necessary to the
[1:17:01] purpose of God it's all within God's
[1:17:04] purpose so ever Saturn is being used to
[1:17:10] achieve God's purpose
[1:17:13] Satan is not as powerful as you ascribe
[1:17:16] him it can never - beyond what God
[1:17:21] allows him is a true one of these days
[1:17:29] that ever we'll find out very soon that
[1:17:32] is only being used
[1:17:34] it will soon be dumped like a trash now
[1:17:48] God was put Adam in a position to use
[1:17:52] that choice ability that's where we're
[1:17:55] going so the woman is there the serpent
[1:17:59] is there created in the manner in which
[1:18:02] it was created upright creature who
[1:18:05] talked correlate even his blood could
[1:18:07] mix with the blood of human being and
[1:18:09] cause reproduction God did those things
[1:18:14] for a purpose then when God finish order
[1:18:18] he went up into glory
[1:18:20] brother Bram said he gave him that
[1:18:23] ability to choose by himself knowing by
[1:18:26] that it would fall so when you are
[1:18:30] boasting about this is my right very
[1:18:36] careful you are preparing platform for
[1:18:40] failure because I tell you this evening
[1:18:44] that ability is this complimentary to
[1:18:48] your make of the Bible called you in
[1:18:51] lump that's the makeup of the bride he
[1:18:55] called you a sheep a sheep as no right a
[1:18:59] sheep cannot lead itself a chip has to
[1:19:03] depend on the shepherd to lead him and
[1:19:07] ship cannot make decisions that is the
[1:19:11] nature of a ship boy he is God trying a
[1:19:16] free moral agent ability to you you must
[1:19:19] know that there is something suspicious
[1:19:25] so don't worry
[1:19:27] don't ever glory in that right god bless
[1:19:35] you my brother don't ever ever glory in
[1:19:39] that right if you have twists wisdom
[1:19:43] don't treasurer's have don't look up to
[1:19:46] your parent and say you can talk to me
[1:19:48] when you begin to show that you
[1:19:50] exhibiting wrong symptoms brother Brahms
[1:19:55] that you exhibiting the character of a
[1:19:57] fallen nature that is why in the seals
[1:20:00] is that when we are redeemed with no
[1:20:02] longer ones our ways you are created to
[1:20:13] be latch and the message looking at the
[1:20:16] unseen the Prophet made a flood
[1:20:19] statement it might look root is a man
[1:20:21] must not even think for himself because
[1:20:25] the Bible said let the mind that was in
[1:20:28] Christ Jesus be in you so if the mind of
[1:20:33] Christ in you demand of Christ do the
[1:20:35] thinking this is why I said if you are
[1:20:39] coming to believe that open where you
[1:20:41] got no such coming
[1:20:43] you've got your opinions and your ideas
[1:20:46] barrage you are going to live by your
[1:20:48] personal belief of who God is you will
[1:20:51] live by the faith of the Son of God not
[1:20:55] by your faith in the Son of God all
[1:21:04] these things we're God's divine
[1:21:05] calculation so that they fall that would
[1:21:09] make the attributes necessary to take
[1:21:11] place so serpent and Eve cross
[1:21:15] themselves serpent Eve cross themselves
[1:21:19] you saw what I wrote and that when they
[1:21:21] cross themselves let me tell you when I
[1:21:25] fell nothing as a punch to the head
[1:21:32] nothing has happened something terrible
[1:21:38] happened on the earth or to the earth
[1:21:41] only after Adam became involved if Adam
[1:21:49] never involved himself if may perish
[1:21:53] alone and that will continue
[1:21:56] imperfection but then this was the
[1:22:01] reason why God gave Adam the ability to
[1:22:04] choose so glad for that is I'm in heaven
[1:22:09] and turned his back waiting for his son
[1:22:14] to decide brother Brahm said God knew
[1:22:18] that by that it will fall because if we
[1:22:22] choose something that would make the
[1:22:24] demonstration of the attributes
[1:22:25] necessary so free moral agents the
[1:22:29] choice given in the beginning was
[1:22:31] designed to make you fall because
[1:22:35] ordinarily in yourself by yourself you
[1:22:39] can never choose correctly you are not
[1:22:45] designed to do it it's not your
[1:22:47] chemistry it's not your make off so get
[1:22:50] it right
[1:22:52] [Applause]
[1:22:54] this was worried that I ronamayk achieve
[1:22:57] as nature is that I place before you
[1:23:01] life and death blessing and causes
[1:23:07] that's free moral agency in other words
[1:23:11] but the Lord you know at your makeup in
[1:23:14] those that you would if he allows you to
[1:23:16] do it you will choose death you will
[1:23:20] choose a course the next line a whisper
[1:23:23] quietly choose life choose life
[1:23:34] what is that showing to you Anna God
[1:23:37] wants to influence your choice he
[1:23:44] shouldn't have told you what to choose
[1:23:46] by the convention of free moral agency
[1:23:49] to allow you to take your decision but
[1:23:53] if you are is own you don't have that
[1:23:55] right as you think you do
[1:23:57] the only person God we allow a free fall
[1:24:01] is the Serpent's each the prophet and a
[1:24:05] message god of this village is AG Lord
[1:24:08] is not obligated to teach concealed Rijn
[1:24:11] revelation is not obligated to teach
[1:24:15] them is will they can have a free fall
[1:24:18] but free moral agency is not for the
[1:24:22] seeds of God because the design of it in
[1:24:26] the beginning is to bring if all are you
[1:24:35] struggling with her please don't
[1:24:37] struggle with her because I will put you
[1:24:39] to a point you wish or another choice
[1:24:41] tonight you will surrender hey you are
[1:24:46] going to live here with no longer my
[1:24:48] wheel no longer my way I surrender
[1:24:52] [Applause]
[1:24:57] you love him tonight so young men young
[1:25:02] women it is not as free as you taught
[1:25:06] his freeing God has a purpose for that
[1:25:09] amen
[1:25:11] and we thank God for the open book that
[1:25:14] is declaring the will of God for when
[1:25:18] Hannah made that choice
[1:25:20] don't forget read in the scripture it
[1:25:23] was only after it made his choice that
[1:25:27] God came down God wasn't sleeping God
[1:25:32] wasn't lost on the program before ADA
[1:25:34] made a choice
[1:25:35] but it designed it that way
[1:25:38] so as to make him necessary the
[1:25:41] demonstration of his attributes now the
[1:25:45] choice the header made has the
[1:25:47] far-reaching consequence does the lesson
[1:25:51] for horse fire region we need police
[1:25:56] today because of the choice of ADA we
[1:26:00] need Ospital today because of the choice
[1:26:03] of ADA violence is everywhere because of
[1:26:07] the choice of Edom now let's not dwell
[1:26:10] so much on Adam because Adam is gone
[1:26:13] this is your day the prophet in a
[1:26:17] message by faith Moses I don't know if I
[1:26:19] will be patient to read but let me make
[1:26:21] attempt amen Desiree's read it all right
[1:26:25] in the message by Pharaoh Moses he told
[1:26:29] us that you also you are today what you
[1:26:35] are because of the choices that you are
[1:26:40] making
[1:26:48] it maybe this moaning wind even in Solem
[1:26:51] is a discipline that there'll be men and
[1:26:54] women set in here that will make your
[1:26:57] final choice you are today what you have
[1:27:00] because several years ago you chose to
[1:27:04] be what you are now for a minute look at
[1:27:08] yourself what am I Who am I whatever
[1:27:13] your conclusion is it's not the product
[1:27:17] of now it is what you choose some time
[1:27:20] ago if somebody woke up here this then
[1:27:24] said call me doctor dr. Sam America dr.
[1:27:31] Sam well brother Bram said call him and
[1:27:34] what he wants to be called but if I do
[1:27:38] not understand your history when I'm
[1:27:41] sick I know better than to come to you
[1:27:46] yeah because to be a doctor is not just
[1:27:49] by saying call me doctor for you to be a
[1:27:53] doctor today in our country I will use
[1:27:56] you will have run through primary school
[1:27:59] secondary school six six years nowadays
[1:28:03] is all right another six years in the
[1:28:05] university with one year Osman ship and
[1:28:09] another year of youth service by the
[1:28:12] time you added together you are doing
[1:28:15] about 20 years before you become a
[1:28:18] doctor so it wasn't the day they come
[1:28:21] file with that degree that you made the
[1:28:23] choice amen you made the choice several
[1:28:27] years ago you came into secondary school
[1:28:30] and they asked what do you want to do
[1:28:32] you said I want to do sciences they move
[1:28:34] you one side and you chose the course
[1:28:36] those were the tendencies towards that
[1:28:38] so the day you were given the degree
[1:28:40] wasn't a choice day the day of the
[1:28:43] degree is the reflection of the choice
[1:28:46] that you made several years ago
[1:28:49] physical types the spiritual so oh you
[1:28:53] are by your hand such a night did not
[1:28:56] begin now it's a choice you made
[1:29:00] yesterday your today is a reflection of
[1:29:05] the choice of yesterday your tomorrow
[1:29:07] will be the reflection of the choice
[1:29:10] today
[1:29:13] let me read further I hope it's going
[1:29:16] well with us is that what you choose now
[1:29:20] will determine what will be five years
[1:29:24] from today so it's not too late to make
[1:29:26] good choices now is that five years from
[1:29:30] today you may be a missionary five years
[1:29:33] from today you may be a renowned
[1:29:36] Christian oh five years from today you
[1:29:41] may be in hell because you made the
[1:29:44] wrong decision five years from today you
[1:29:47] may be clinging Spee terms in the
[1:29:49] barrels or five years from today you may
[1:29:53] be a prostitute on the street don't say
[1:29:56] it is not possible you some people have
[1:30:08] proclaimed the message who have jumped
[1:30:11] on the anointing who have said Amen
[1:30:13] somehow there today attacking the same
[1:30:16] message some people said so longer and
[1:30:20] around the message so true say because
[1:30:23] you cannot be in the message and depart
[1:30:26] hmm brother Brahm said many is an
[1:30:28] attraction within the range of the
[1:30:31] message they said so long the day they
[1:30:35] renounce the message the next day the
[1:30:37] sisters are wearing trousers pants then
[1:30:40] you wonder what their values have been
[1:30:42] for all the years they've been around so
[1:30:45] don't say it's not possible you come to
[1:30:51] that because of catalogs of areas
[1:30:57] areas of Prayer areas of disobedience
[1:31:02] areas of no study of the word areas of
[1:31:05] playing Church and yes of even not
[1:31:08] knowing where you come for where you in
[1:31:10] the house of the Lord
[1:31:11] when dustin's build up to a level that
[1:31:14] your system can no longer unduly you
[1:31:16] crushing box Latinas so look at yourself
[1:31:29] again tonight and say what am I Who am I
[1:31:33] this is the word of the Lord
[1:31:36] five years from today look five years
[1:31:40] pass look five years tomorrow and it is
[1:31:44] not too late to make the right choices
[1:31:48] you love them too now what am I trying
[1:31:52] to show what am I trying to show is to
[1:31:56] let you know even though our choices
[1:31:58] sometimes are unconscious yet the
[1:32:02] affective effect in our lives
[1:32:07] then if the case be so the professor has
[1:32:11] an advice for horse amana would like to
[1:32:13] hear his advice
[1:32:15] you love him tonight yes the Prophet
[1:32:21] advising listen to this I'm glad for the
[1:32:26] patient to reach tonight is that my
[1:32:28] advice to you is when you are making
[1:32:31] choices don't look at the modern things
[1:32:34] around you and the popularity and
[1:32:38] glamour that could be but choose rather
[1:32:44] by faith
[1:32:47] choice is a battle between sites and
[1:32:50] faith sites is seen through human hi
[1:32:55] faith is seen through the eye of God
[1:33:00] choose by faith amen
[1:33:05] all right it still advisor knows and
[1:33:07] that faith is a revelation here it must
[1:33:14] be God's choosing it cannot be ours we
[1:33:20] have no choice coming and is already
[1:33:23] chosen
[1:33:24] now what God chooses is right
[1:33:27] I can choose wrong you can choose wrong
[1:33:31] but God cannot choose wrong so what are
[1:33:39] we to do handle by your choice to God
[1:33:44] now listen to this one is that it is
[1:33:49] best to have God's will that's what I
[1:33:53] thought was they will be done the
[1:33:55] kingdom come we must submit ourselves to
[1:33:59] his will and is wait don't question it
[1:34:08] believe it don't try to find a way
[1:34:12] around it just take it the way it is we
[1:34:19] must submit ourselves to two things in
[1:34:21] any step you want to take in life in
[1:34:26] order to fulfill Tutera know me touch in
[1:34:28] a chain we must submit ourself to his
[1:34:32] will and his word I think when there's
[1:34:37] an hand it shows two things this is the
[1:34:41] Word of God amen but the message of the
[1:34:48] hour is the will of God
[1:34:57] is it sinking there are times when the
[1:35:04] word of God may not be the will of God
[1:35:09] it remains the word of God which is not
[1:35:14] the wheel of God
[1:35:16] it's very simple to crack in the days of
[1:35:20] Noah let's just give an example it was
[1:35:24] the Word of God for Noah to build an ark
[1:35:27] for that age that was the will of God
[1:35:30] physical ark that is as many as never
[1:35:34] entered the hock they perished by the
[1:35:36] floor today it remains the Word of God
[1:35:40] but a physical ark is no longer the will
[1:35:45] of God any man can do it and go and say
[1:35:49] I have a scripture for it you'd really
[1:35:51] do it's the end the Bible but if you do
[1:35:56] it today it's not the will of God there
[1:35:59] will never be a flood to flow to your
[1:36:01] heart to begin with flood they have been
[1:36:04] off Lord if there's another flood on a
[1:36:06] worldwide global basis then God broke
[1:36:10] his Convenant of rainbow to know because
[1:36:13] God told him I will never do it again
[1:36:17] so your heart will be useless it was the
[1:36:21] Word of God it was the will of God but
[1:36:25] today it remains the word it is long
[1:36:28] long guys will this is why in every age
[1:36:34] God sends his messenger to declare his
[1:36:38] will out of his word
[1:36:42] so that when you follow that wheel you
[1:36:45] are automatically fulfilling Genesis to
[1:36:48] Revelation it's automatic don't question
[1:36:57] it believe it don't find a way around it
[1:37:02] the Prophet said if you look while we
[1:37:05] are around you will get but any way
[1:37:10] around the will of God is permissive it
[1:37:13] is not perfect God may allow it it will
[1:37:20] never accept it that's what the word
[1:37:23] says
[1:37:24] are you listening German the way we are
[1:37:28] being born our natural birth is an
[1:37:30] example God allow us to come that way
[1:37:33] but he never said that each this is why
[1:37:37] when God Himself came in flesh he
[1:37:39] commanded you must be born again
[1:37:44] [Applause]
[1:37:50] walking in permissive will is very
[1:37:52] dangerous the professor you could even
[1:37:58] find God blessing UNH but at the end I
[1:38:03] want to tell you you will lose Moses
[1:38:08] gave Moses give the order of service and
[1:38:11] the articles of service and they placed
[1:38:14] each ministry into the opposition but
[1:38:18] some people who are politically minded
[1:38:21] thought that Moses was just allocating
[1:38:24] so many things to his family because
[1:38:27] Aaron and the seeds of Aaron take the
[1:38:30] priesthood while other Levites
[1:38:33] take the ministry to read the word and
[1:38:35] to preach but it is only the sons of her
[1:38:37] on that can do intercessory work and you
[1:38:40] know sometimes people feel one ministry
[1:38:43] is better than the other it is not a
[1:38:46] spirit of today it has always been
[1:38:47] around so this is the reason why Korah
[1:38:51] Dathan and abiram we are never happy
[1:38:53] with that
[1:38:54] fine arrangements they thought it was
[1:38:57] Moses boy it was God so one day they
[1:39:01] funds the courage to challenge Moses but
[1:39:04] unfortunately it was a direct challenge
[1:39:06] against they reveal what for that hour
[1:39:08] it gives that we love God for that hour
[1:39:12] is that you take too much to yourself
[1:39:15] Moses says you sons of levy you have too
[1:39:18] much problems and when a Kunal
[1:39:25] I could not ruin them him he said to
[1:39:27] what you want then this guy's they went
[1:39:31] to pick incense and the sensor to offer
[1:39:37] the incense and it looks like karana
[1:39:41] param and the time was after it will
[1:39:42] prove to you that if you know we also
[1:39:46] know like many important to have the
[1:39:50] same level of Revelation like William
[1:39:52] Brown today it is far from you
[1:39:55] [Applause]
[1:39:55] [Music]
[1:40:00] it is far from you it's just that you
[1:40:04] don't read your work very well the last
[1:40:07] dispensation of prophets to the Gentile
[1:40:10] is William Brown there have been no
[1:40:13] other person on the field after I'm gone
[1:40:16] that's what I searched when he said I
[1:40:22] must decrease animals increase it wasn't
[1:40:25] handing over to nobody
[1:40:26] it is the Ministry of the seventh angel
[1:40:28] of loud this year giving well to the
[1:40:30] ministry of the mighty angel of
[1:40:32] revelation 10 because Christ has always
[1:40:35] brought deliverance by himself
[1:40:46] the job of Major Redemption it never
[1:40:50] gives any man that was when they good
[1:40:53] when they go to a Jericho it was beyond
[1:40:56] Joshua he has to make contact with the
[1:40:59] angel of the Covenant who appeared in
[1:41:02] angelic for are you for us are you
[1:41:05] against us
[1:41:06] it took the angel to give him the
[1:41:08] formula to know how to break down the
[1:41:12] walls of Jericho not no man
[1:41:16] Joshua means Jehovah Savior does the
[1:41:19] Lord Jesus Christ William Brown never
[1:41:26] expose you to no man he has passed you
[1:41:28] to Jesus Christ he said what God sent me
[1:41:33] to do is to establish a relationship
[1:41:35] between man and God when the
[1:41:38] relationship become established he said
[1:41:41] I must decrease and II must increase
[1:41:45] because the bride and the groom must
[1:41:47] begin to have contact in order for the
[1:41:51] bride to bring for the seat of this hour
[1:42:00] lemme lemme tell you something
[1:42:03] lemme tell you somethin our Western
[1:42:06] understanding confuses or sometimes you
[1:42:09] know in the scripture in the scripture
[1:42:13] in the Jewish land when the wedding is
[1:42:17] performed before reception they go for
[1:42:21] consummation aha radio Bible the moments
[1:42:26] the groom and the bride is blessed that
[1:42:29] nesting is for the bride's father to
[1:42:33] prepare a room we have the consummation
[1:42:38] of that time will be made it is the
[1:42:41] outcome of consummation that will
[1:42:44] determine whether they'll be wedding
[1:42:46] Sapa or not read your Bible correctly in
[1:42:50] the West what we'll do is wedding and
[1:42:53] reception then consummation that's what
[1:42:57] we do but in the whole Jewish that is
[1:43:01] not what they do
[1:43:02] wedding consummation reception let me
[1:43:06] announce to you that is what Christ has
[1:43:08] adopted that is why it must relate with
[1:43:14] you as the bride now in order to bring
[1:43:16] forward while we wait for the wedding so
[1:43:19] far and you see the outcome is coming he
[1:43:23] said you a sinless virtuous
[1:43:27] [Music]
[1:43:27] [Applause]
[1:43:30] well carotids bright so you deserve a
[1:43:35] reception and is gonna come for three
[1:43:38] and a half years
[1:43:44] we are waiting for that time to come so
[1:43:48] while we are waiting letter waiting
[1:43:50] continue let the marriage continue amen
[1:43:54] let the bride and the groom be bonding
[1:43:58] because the go-between as finishes what
[1:44:01] you say as villages walk a finishes walk
[1:44:05] without leaving one stone unturned he
[1:44:08] turn every stone that was why a priest a
[1:44:11] message invisible Union he said this is
[1:44:14] my tons given message the purpose for
[1:44:17] which group brought me has been
[1:44:19] accomplished

[1:44:29] fine with that
[1:44:30] you love him god bless you Church
[1:44:37] [Applause]
[1:44:39] so this folks this folks they went to
[1:44:44] carry their sensor with their incense
[1:44:46] and they started the Bible said they
[1:44:49] started offering actually and while they
[1:44:53] were offering the smoke of the offering
[1:44:56] was rising up to heaven
[1:44:58] do you City God with us and there must
[1:45:02] have been telling Moses can you see your
[1:45:03] life even God is swallowing our offering
[1:45:09] but thank God for Moses who knows way
[1:45:13] standing he doesn't get bothered or
[1:45:19] shaken by all those things he waited
[1:45:22] till there abracadabra and Acrobat was
[1:45:25] over when they finish pastor Moses got
[1:45:32] off he said who is on the Lord's side it
[1:45:37] will interest you to know that some of
[1:45:39] those guys who were healing who has him
[1:45:42] preach on brother data move on brother
[1:45:44] Cora when they saw the countenance of
[1:45:47] the pastor Moses they said anytime
[1:45:50] pastors faces like this something will
[1:45:52] happen
[1:45:54] they must have taught by the Korah
[1:45:57] Dathan and abiram excuse me for now I'm
[1:45:59] changing comes is the season of
[1:46:02] defection in Nigeria
[1:46:12] so all these brethren began to defect in
[1:46:20] the incision of defection and their
[1:46:23] defection and they were defective and
[1:46:26] they were defective the Moses Asch
[1:46:30] well if this man died the death of
[1:46:35] natural human beings the Lord has no
[1:46:39] called me then God Moses began to
[1:46:42] prescribe for God the kind of death
[1:46:46] [Applause]
[1:46:48] don't joke with the Moses of this hour
[1:46:51] [Applause]
[1:46:54] you know Paul said I am the wise
[1:46:57] masterbuilder
[1:46:58] do you remember I said ax is a let every
[1:47:03] man watch what is building on hitch the
[1:47:07] bride will not be judged but there's an
[1:47:09] elements of our future judgment listen
[1:47:12] to these your work will be judged is
[1:47:15] that summer Putin stone summer Putin is
[1:47:18] summer Putin's troubles some are putting
[1:47:21] wood some are putting brass summer Putin
[1:47:23] silver and some are putting gold
[1:47:25] it's a fire we try so that is the
[1:47:31] element of our future judgment and we
[1:47:34] must be careful but I thank God beyond
[1:47:37] the curtain of time their sense
[1:47:40] who in the Achuar final bodies in their
[1:47:43] body in which you know all things in the
[1:47:45] body in which you cannot be diseased
[1:47:47] they said they chorus with one voice
[1:47:50] when the Prophet said I want to see
[1:47:53] Jesus they said is a bit high we are
[1:47:56] waiting for you to present us to him is
[1:47:59] that will Peter do the same they said
[1:48:02] certainly will paw through the same
[1:48:04] suddenly it Danny told those Saints is
[1:48:07] that if the people of Peter make it mine
[1:48:10] will make
[1:48:12] if the people of Paul make it mine
[1:48:15] we'll make it because I preach war Paul
[1:48:17] preached
[1:48:18] I preach what Peter preached talk about
[1:48:22] being built on apostles and prophets
[1:48:24] foundation that is in there I preached
[1:48:27] what the bridge and the sense of Ghana
[1:48:30] they said on this we are rusty
[1:48:34] [Applause]
[1:48:35] we are still resonance because our
[1:48:39] theophany ball record with us
[1:48:42] [Applause]
[1:48:49] you love him
[1:48:52] hallelujah then after they finish the
[1:48:57] offerings is an image will be that the
[1:49:00] land will open and God will swallow them
[1:49:04] one after the other and all that they
[1:49:06] have then it will be a lesson that if
[1:49:10] you are not of the stock of Iran don't
[1:49:13] ever pick a sensor and the incense and
[1:49:16] the Bible said as Moses was finishing
[1:49:19] the statement God wished had no time the
[1:49:23] land opened and swallowed them whole
[1:49:27] now watch God watch God Moses said this
[1:49:32] the offering of these people against
[1:49:34] their soul is that God or sends us
[1:49:39] because they offered it onto the Lord is
[1:49:42] that so they've become a load take them
[1:49:44] as vessels in the house of God but the
[1:49:47] question is where were those who offered
[1:49:50] each be very very careful even if you
[1:49:56] are running in permissive wheel and you
[1:49:59] are feeling good and you are feeling
[1:50:01] blessed be very very it will never end
[1:50:05] well and it is not a cause so we must
[1:50:11] submit ourselves to his will and to his
[1:50:16] work don't question each Donn's as you
[1:50:21] meet tickets the way such it's not going
[1:50:31] well with you you loved him tonight
[1:50:34] Oh hallelujah now watch why she will be
[1:50:46] scared about the will of the Lord you
[1:50:50] don't have a reason to be scared because
[1:50:53] most of the times what was trouble with
[1:50:56] if the men walk up to the pastor and
[1:50:58] said this and this I want to do sir
[1:51:00] could you just pray along with the pass
[1:51:02] always say let's pray buddy let's see
[1:51:05] what it will of God would be that you
[1:51:07] become uncomfortable you know why it's
[1:51:10] because many a times we already made up
[1:51:12] our mind be careful that is dangerous
[1:51:17] because God looked at the heart of some
[1:51:20] folks and he told his prophet is that
[1:51:22] the elders of Israel are coming with to
[1:51:24] me with idols they've already made up
[1:51:27] their mind what they wanted to do they
[1:51:29] say well to fulfill all righteousness
[1:51:31] let us go and find out God does not deal
[1:51:34] with your lips it deals with your heart
[1:51:39] so what is on your lips must match with
[1:51:42] what is in your heart if there is no
[1:51:44] match God caused you an epoch reach and
[1:51:47] we give you the answer that you want
[1:51:50] he gave Balaam the answer he wanted what
[1:52:00] I want to I want to make it very easy
[1:52:03] for you tonight you don't have to be
[1:52:04] scared you don't have to feature about
[1:52:08] the will of God just look at the
[1:52:10] scripture we read is that ask and it
[1:52:15] shall be given
[1:52:17] knock and it will be open to you is that
[1:52:21] what they say this is sick and you will
[1:52:23] find is that what is that then it shot
[1:52:27] to you how a better fat is than ever
[1:52:30] your head'll appearance is that o
[1:52:33] amongst you will your children ask for a
[1:52:36] fish will give my snake it's not
[1:52:39] possible if they have so bread you won't
[1:52:43] give them stone is that there if you
[1:52:46] being evil know how to give good gifts
[1:52:49] I'm much more me that's a challenge
[1:52:53] tonight
[1:52:54] can we trust God enough to know that is
[1:53:00] will our lives will be better look at
[1:53:06] you look at you brother Bram said we do
[1:53:11] not choose by what we see we choose by
[1:53:16] what we believe now yeah because what
[1:53:20] you see is just the quantity that your
[1:53:24] eyes can declare if you are not using hi
[1:53:28] glasses like I'm doing if you stand here
[1:53:31] on the plane surface you can see more
[1:53:35] than a kilometer or two very clearly
[1:53:39] after I kilometer you might be able to
[1:53:43] tell that this is a human being but I
[1:53:45] doubt if you can identify who they're
[1:53:47] following that is the best your eyes can
[1:53:50] declare by you see God is here in the
[1:53:54] beginning is the end so o is a better
[1:53:58] person to make your choice and the Bible
[1:54:01] said in whatever you do consider at the
[1:54:03] end of the matter if you are to take
[1:54:06] decisions by the end of the matter
[1:54:08] then you need the ones who knows the end
[1:54:11] from the beginning to influence your
[1:54:13] choice
[1:54:14] [Applause]
[1:54:22] you love em tonight are making it easy
[1:54:27] for you to surrender now I want you to
[1:54:31] know that nobody should frigate
[1:54:34] embargoes choice for them because three
[1:54:38] God made three physical choices about
[1:54:42] your life that you had no contribution
[1:54:47] hing it made a choice of you for you and
[1:54:54] about you we are going to read it we are
[1:54:57] going to look at it you have no
[1:54:59] contribution in those choices and if
[1:55:02] you're mandarins correctly you love them
[1:55:05] so well but let me begin from the
[1:55:09] spiritual choices how many are happy to
[1:55:11] be Christians tonight how many are happy
[1:55:17] I want to see your hands how many are
[1:55:20] happy everybody is happy to be Christian
[1:55:24] god bless you James so you are happy
[1:55:28] with God's choice because you never
[1:55:33] chose to be a Christian I rather be a no
[1:55:38] time Christian than anything I know
[1:55:40] that's very good you are releasing a
[1:55:44] choice but you never made that choice
[1:55:47] it is beyond you to make that choice
[1:55:51] Jesus Christ you never chose me I chose
[1:55:56] and you are here liking the choice can
[1:56:03] you begin to trust Amy at least God has
[1:56:07] a plasma canal
[1:56:08] he made a choice that you like all of
[1:56:20] you can die for Christ and it was in
[1:56:23] your choice if you love him tonight is
[1:56:25] because if I love you and II places' is
[1:56:29] love in your heart our prophet said when
[1:56:37] you begin to feel a need for God in your
[1:56:40] life it is the seed God put in there
[1:56:42] that is hungry man testing to come to a
[1:56:45] life it wasn't your idea it was is an
[1:56:51] e-zine is appointed time Oh glory to God
[1:56:56] [Applause]
[1:56:58] let's look at some choices image for you
[1:57:02] of you and about you in the message
[1:57:11] chosen of a bride paragraph two one five
[1:57:13] just one series it preached on that he
[1:57:17] said remember now we are going to step
[1:57:19] up our language so that the young do not
[1:57:22] take the young ones don't take a wrong
[1:57:24] impression but the hadass will
[1:57:26] understand what I'm saying
[1:57:27] are we together all right it said
[1:57:30] remember what I said the other day at a
[1:57:33] breakfast in the polling of breeding
[1:57:35] male and female there's a million of
[1:57:39] gems go for you pick and are millions of
[1:57:46] eggs go for but there is only one of
[1:57:49] them live and yet there everyone just
[1:57:55] alike one out of a million every one of
[1:58:01] them the same egg and the same kind of
[1:58:04] Jam one of them leaves and the rest of
[1:58:07] them dies
[1:58:09] what I'm saying is that in the hour of
[1:58:14] your conception many lives came from -
[1:58:19] too many lives coming from mom but out
[1:58:26] of these millions of lives it is only
[1:58:30] one that will match with the other life
[1:58:38] you have revelation it is just only one
[1:58:44] and even science under microscope told
[1:58:48] us that your position on the queue is
[1:58:52] not a disadvantage they said sometimes
[1:58:55] they have washed the very last life rot
[1:58:59] on top of the other lives to come and be
[1:59:02] the one when it's riding when is riding
[1:59:08] on top of the other lives what
[1:59:10] intelligence make the other lives to
[1:59:12] submit without competition without
[1:59:16] fighting
[1:59:19] there must be a supernatural
[1:59:21] intelligence that is what brother Brown
[1:59:26] search your best is more mysterious than
[1:59:30] the virgin birth of Jesus Christ
[1:59:32] [Applause]
[1:59:37] many the lives father's will submit and
[1:59:40] say you go and you go go go go go and
[1:59:44] touch the other life and it becomes a
[1:59:46] conception and that conception happened
[1:59:49] to become you for you to be the
[1:59:54] conceived 999,999 lives we are wasted
[2:00:04] for it to be you
[2:00:07] the prophetess not even mama or Papa or
[2:00:13] anybody can decide who amongst those
[2:00:17] lives will from the conception I want to
[2:00:21] hug the church tonight who took that
[2:00:23] decision who made that choice can we
[2:00:28] give God a pass man
[2:00:40] when image that choice it became you now
[2:00:46] permit my route question how many wants
[2:00:48] to die now see their faces city offenses
[2:00:53] prefer mr. heo meaning no no no but if
[2:01:00] God let's ask him since he's the one who
[2:01:02] responded prefer my come let us ask him
[2:01:07] maybe you can remember where we were
[2:01:11] when the millions of years of light
[2:01:12] space did God ever HASC you that would
[2:01:18] you like to be the one conceived that
[2:01:20] day no it never hurts you it never hurts
[2:01:26] you do you like being alive sure you do
[2:01:31] like being the one sure so can we give
[2:01:34] God a plasma
[2:01:39] so God meant a choice of in among manic
[2:01:47] or their lives you are like it if you
[2:01:51] had if you had a blast now but you will
[2:01:54] forget you and a charge everybody will
[2:01:57] start running helter-skelter you know
[2:01:59] what because you are trying to protect
[2:02:01] their life you have no idea how it came
[2:02:04] about
[2:02:05] it's a reflection of the fact that you
[2:02:08] are scepter that choice let's go on
[2:02:16] let's go on
[2:02:18] no one can tell which is the one that's
[2:02:22] will rap on the head or what about each
[2:02:24] God us to decide that just like you said
[2:02:27] whether it's going to be a boy or a girl
[2:02:31] who decides - blonde or brunette black
[2:02:37] brown chocolate light complexion
[2:02:39] whatever who decides that your greed is

[2:03:10] happened to be a preacher and that is to

[2:03:50] ask him is our case study
[2:03:52] did you remember whatever asking you
[2:03:55] whether you would like to be made a man
[2:03:56] or a woman no shall we turn you to woman
[2:04:01] it looked at me what an embarrassing
[2:04:04] quest god bless you sir
[2:04:10] so you accepted choice number 2 of God
[2:04:13] is that right that there are those of us
[2:04:18] who would say I like vacation on the
[2:04:20] mountains and there are those who say no
[2:04:25] no no no I like it by the river by the
[2:04:27] poolside I just like to watch water for
[2:04:30] the next 10 hours feel the cool breeze
[2:04:32] this that sandy harder ask these people
[2:04:35] did God ever consult you to put those
[2:04:39] things in there how come it so perfect
[2:04:43] that it knows what you would like and
[2:04:45] the message things that are to be the
[2:04:47] profits that the kindness of our
[2:04:49] Heavenly Father knows what your tests
[2:04:54] will be like and it puts everything in
[2:04:57] place before you have a appear
[2:05:05] if God met all these choices for you of
[2:05:09] you and about you and you loved it so
[2:05:11] much I want to ask you sirs and mass
[2:05:14] what or that choice of your life can you
[2:05:16] not undo I know something is running the
[2:05:28] mind of some of you say but it promised
[2:05:30] to give me the desire of my heart am i
[2:05:34] touching your spirit you are very right
[2:05:39] it's a promise
[2:05:41] but the Prophet said that Christian
[2:05:43] desire is just only one what does the
[2:05:47] word says on any vain
[2:05:50] this is why God to time by the
[2:05:53] inspiration of debtor animated Eva's
[2:05:56] nineteen we are in a whispered choose
[2:05:58] life it took time to set out in his word
[2:06:02] every aspect of human life and give you
[2:06:07] confidence and guidelines to appear
[2:06:10] choices if you want to marry there's a
[2:06:13] provision in the word of God on how to
[2:06:15] get married when you get married there's
[2:06:18] a remedy in the Word of God on how to
[2:06:20] live with your wives and with your
[2:06:22] husband's God students have interfere
[2:06:25] with your personal life but in knows if
[2:06:27] he lets you have it you won't do right
[2:06:33] every other areas of your life if you
[2:06:37] are lying the right of way is willing to
[2:06:39] guide you I'm winding down now by saying
[2:06:42] this the choices you make when you do it
[2:06:54] by sight
[2:06:55] your physical high what you are seeing
[2:07:00] will not be as much as what you are not
[2:07:04] saying
[2:07:06] or let me put it another way what you
[2:07:13] don't see is more than what you see I'll
[2:07:22] give you some choice examples in the
[2:07:26] scripture Abram and Lord we're together
[2:07:29] for a while
[2:07:30] Abram the uncle lot the nephew for
[2:07:34] everything lot achieved you hood it to
[2:07:36] Hebron you remember that but because
[2:07:40] they Brom was a Christian he doesn't
[2:07:42] tight fist on anything when it loses if
[2:07:47] the portion of the land can no longer
[2:07:48] contain boat he give love the right of
[2:07:52] first choice it should have been Abraham
[2:07:54] saying Lord goodies way but Abram
[2:07:57] manifested every character every virtue
[2:08:00] and that is what stirred him out today
[2:08:03] as what as an allegory a prophecy of
[2:08:08] your whole life but not only see the
[2:08:16] opportunity to make choice then the
[2:08:20] batchest the Bible said in Luke that he
[2:08:22] well what are plain brother Bram said
[2:08:26] all that was on his mind is better
[2:08:29] economic opportunity to make much more
[2:08:37] and sometimes some of us take such
[2:08:40] decisions Bala Brom said without even
[2:08:42] consideration for our souls he taught us
[2:08:49] that when you are considering where to
[2:08:50] even locate is that consider fast your
[2:08:53] soul is that it is important you hang
[2:08:58] around where the fire of God is fallen
[2:09:01] a lot of you became emergency pastors
[2:09:06] today because you don't consider that he
[2:09:09] said doesn't matter that place is good
[2:09:11] when we get there if there's no church
[2:09:13] we'll start one as God led you to do
[2:09:16] that I hope I'm not standing offensive
[2:09:25] I'm just preaching the Word of God thank
[2:09:31] you for loving me sir
[2:09:32] I appreciated love the professor was
[2:09:39] looking at an opportunity this my one
[2:09:42] thousand cow but it's an degrees on that
[2:09:45] land for the next one year they will
[2:09:49] become double and in the next year
[2:09:51] triple quadruple syncopal are not cairo
[2:09:54] pools
[2:09:57] then before you know it i will walk
[2:10:00] around and overland then i become the
[2:10:04] main man for friends because it was all
[2:10:08] a choice besides II couldn't sees wife
[2:10:12] becoming the pillar of salt here watch
[2:10:19] the choices you are making watch the
[2:10:21] influences of your life he couldn't see
[2:10:25] himself going with plenty and escaping
[2:10:28] with nothing it couldn't see his
[2:10:33] daughter's been destroyed his their ways
[2:10:37] does has destroyed reach the Bible lot
[2:10:40] had sons in-laws who we have married to
[2:10:44] his daughters the two daughters that
[2:10:46] escaped with him we are not here
[2:10:47] marriage they were pure veterans living
[2:10:50] in the house but is God those who were
[2:10:54] ready marriage so those daughters perish
[2:10:58] so sometimes when he was a Lot's wife
[2:11:00] looked back the tendencies to look at it
[2:11:04] from the angle of maybe our trinkets our
[2:11:06] jewelry and so forth but the instant of
[2:11:09] mother also was there my daughters are
[2:11:11] perishing
[2:11:12] that prize and yet when God was ready to
[2:11:17] bring that deliverance that you must not
[2:11:19] mind the cry think about it go without
[2:11:26] it didn't see the destruction of his own
[2:11:28] daughters in Sodom and Gomorrah he
[2:11:33] didn't see himself starting so well and
[2:11:35] ending it in shame by becoming father by
[2:11:39] his own daughters when you choose by
[2:11:44] sight what you see is not as much as
[2:11:49] what you don't see you loved him tonight
[2:12:01] there's even a very even a very tough
[2:12:05] one in the Bible go to the Sakaya
[2:12:08] prepare your house this is the time to
[2:12:12] go that was the choice of God for you
[2:12:16] hmm
[2:12:17] it's over and now nobody wants to hear
[2:12:21] that kind of a thing but our tell you
[2:12:25] those who had it and we're happy Paul
[2:12:28] was telling the church I am ready to be
[2:12:30] offered Peter said the same thing
[2:12:33] brother Brahm said I never want to ask
[2:12:36] for one more hour or one more day when
[2:12:41] it determines my time is off as a guy
[2:12:44] has got for another 15 years
[2:12:47] he got it friends for reach the Bible it
[2:12:51] were better for him to have God
[2:12:54] [Applause]
[2:13:00] what God chooses right
[2:13:04] I could go on and on about several
[2:13:07] examples but let me come home to a
[2:13:09] brother Brahim the Prophet said I'm sure
[2:13:15] many of us have read it he said I choose
[2:13:20] to be poor and it doesn't make meaning
[2:13:25] to many of us because you can say was
[2:13:30] really poor at the end of his life but
[2:13:34] friends this is the way to scale it if
[2:13:37] you look at all that the gifts give
[2:13:39] opportunity for brother Brahm to have
[2:13:42] and what he had in comparison it was
[2:13:46] very poor or a robot stole my husband
[2:13:52] and so forth developed out of his
[2:13:54] ministry you saw what they had and you
[2:13:58] saw what he had and it give us a reason
[2:14:01] he said I don't want my meetings to be
[2:14:04] so complex that I will need so much
[2:14:06] money to sustain make my people because
[2:14:13] I want to be able to be available to a
[2:14:16] congregation of six or twenty as much as
[2:14:20] I'm available to those of several
[2:14:22] hundreds of thousands it was only
[2:14:26] William Branham who did that
[2:14:28] in his day there were many places or a
[2:14:33] robot couldn't go and brother Brant all
[2:14:36] the people said don't begrudge him
[2:14:38] because for the office of our robot to
[2:14:41] open every day if then it said it needs
[2:14:43] about six thousand dollars there now if
[2:14:48] it comes to your meetings how much are
[2:14:49] you gonna give him to sustain - this is
[2:14:53] why it locked them off it must be to the
[2:14:56] eye and the dignitaries but the profits
[2:15:01] and mine is not like that
[2:15:03] brother Brahma and his office on a daily
[2:15:06] basis then with an unread order about
[2:15:08] dollars and you see when it took this
[2:15:13] decision it created
[2:15:17] and impact in heaven the choices you
[2:15:24] make god watch it was mementos I will
[2:15:30] show you why it was mementos it was God
[2:15:32] Himself who said it
[2:15:33] it was mementos in heaven and day by day
[2:15:38] the Prophet was faithful to that choice
[2:15:42] it doesn't matter what stories people
[2:15:45] are talking about brother Brahim day by
[2:15:47] day it was faithful because every
[2:15:50] Barakat that he was faithful and I'm
[2:15:56] gonna read it to you then one day God
[2:16:00] blesses us already
[2:16:01] then one day he just finished preaching
[2:16:05] as a full gospel business meeting and
[2:16:08] what he preached look odd today I
[2:16:11] believe but I don't think the Prophet we
[2:16:17] just want to do that accept his letter
[2:16:19] inspired but anyhow it was so hard and
[2:16:23] how they managed with him but there was
[2:16:25] a young fellow who came around him and
[2:16:28] held him ladies there brother Brown what
[2:16:31] you've just preached will look like the
[2:16:33] 23rd chapter of the book of Revelation
[2:16:36] you know Revelation has only 22 so is
[2:16:39] that this sermon will be the addition or
[2:16:41] a tandem to the Bible some said as such
[2:16:46] things are never survived it but in the
[2:16:50] case of this young man it was messy to
[2:16:52] him the moment he says that the Spirit
[2:16:55] of the Lord struck in and started
[2:16:58] speaking in another language this was an
[2:17:03] English man speaking French and God you
[2:17:07] knew that was going to happen
[2:17:09] position three French now we've got five
[2:17:12] six seven French bread
[2:17:16] hallelujah God knew what was going to
[2:17:21] happen who has arranged for that he knew
[2:17:24] that we upon daddy he measures some
[2:17:26] three French fellows were in their
[2:17:28] mission to two men and one woman and
[2:17:33] each of them by their occupation and
[2:17:36] preoccupation they are authorities in
[2:17:39] French translation the three of them
[2:17:42] deeds those translations and when they
[2:17:46] brought the three notes together they
[2:17:48] agree under 8%
[2:17:50] even with commas signs and everything
[2:17:59] Oh with thank God for beautiful choices
[2:18:03] before I read that you know Moses had an
[2:18:06] opportunity to choose also he was raised
[2:18:10] up like an Egyptian but thank God for a
[2:18:13] godly mother who behaved more like a
[2:18:17] nurse who looks to Moses more like a
[2:18:21] nurse and it was a God's divine
[2:18:24] arrangement because the curriculum of
[2:18:27] the teaching that will make Moses
[2:18:28] fulfill his commission wasn't available
[2:18:31] in Egypt so the teacher had to be
[2:18:35] imported and she was badged with foreign
[2:18:39] currency because she was an expert rate
[2:18:42] [Applause]
[2:18:50] when we got to glory I would like to
[2:18:52] have some my my joke about how she spent
[2:18:54] her morning so as Moses was growing up
[2:19:00] in the carriage of a prince everyone's
[2:19:03] in the way when they saw him alive to a
[2:19:05] level to stop picking understanding he
[2:19:07] started telling him you don't belong
[2:19:09] here son Anna you got no right to tell
[2:19:12] me that you go say young man come you
[2:19:16] don't belong here and as you begin to
[2:19:20] repeat it because faith comments by
[2:19:24] don't stop telling the children if you
[2:19:27] take a hold one of these this
[2:19:29] [Applause]
[2:19:34] brotherbrother you got two three or four
[2:19:37] things to do live in life water before
[2:19:41] them pray for them talk to them create
[2:19:47] the right environment move out all the
[2:19:50] trash out of your house and be positive
[2:19:53] it says somewhere down the line go we
[2:19:57] find a way I believe that very well
[2:20:03] because we got the scripture in this end
[2:20:06] time thou and thy house shall be saved
[2:20:14] it doesn't matter how they look like now
[2:20:18] if you keep your eye on that that is
[2:20:20] symptoms past okay you told us that they
[2:20:24] were to have salutes I love that is that
[2:20:28] the absolutes of Caleb and Joshua was
[2:20:31] the promise God gave but the absolutes
[2:20:34] of the ten elders where the things they
[2:20:36] were looking at keep your eye on the
[2:20:40] promise and it will be well with your
[2:20:43] children Keep Calm fascinates the most
[2:20:47] obey don't be negative remember sitive
[2:20:53] that if it work for you is gonna work
[2:20:56] for them
[2:21:02] there was no temple no Tabernacle in the
[2:21:06] palace of Egypt and yet the Bible told
[2:21:09] us in Hebrew level by faith Moses who
[2:21:14] taught affects faith cometh by hearing
[2:21:18] who gave him to hear the mother the
[2:21:23] fifth gospel the kinsman redeemer to
[2:21:27] those children and one day he said okay
[2:21:32] let's assume I don't belong here where
[2:21:35] do I belong
[2:21:36] then the woman looked to be sure nobody
[2:21:39] else was watching in the palace is they
[2:21:41] come let me show you you see hope on the
[2:21:45] shot as she hope on the window is a look
[2:21:47] there you tell me I'm a slave sure you
[2:21:54] sure you sure you and it begins to get a
[2:22:01] hold it began to get out on to Moses one
[2:22:04] day refused to be called Pharaoh's
[2:22:07] daughter son choosing rather to suffer
[2:22:10] the reproach of Christ and accepted his
[2:22:14] as a greater riches than all the
[2:22:18] treasures of Egypt friends that choice
[2:22:25] paid off eight hundred years later he
[2:22:29] was standing with Christ on the Mount of
[2:22:31] Transfiguration when the gospel returned
[2:22:37] to the Jews we'll be back again
[2:22:39] oh man what a choice
[2:22:43] [Applause]
[2:22:46] then when it was interpreted listen to
[2:22:51] what Evan said about brother brems
[2:22:53] choice you like to hear that so because
[2:22:59] they are chosen the narrow paths the
[2:23:03] other way and thou as Walt in your own
[2:23:08] chosen walk in their choice find out the
[2:23:14] will of the Lord on any matter and whole
[2:23:18] heartedly stain it thou has picked the
[2:23:25] correct m precise decision and it is my
[2:23:31] way so this was God's choice for brother
[2:23:35] Brahim because of this momentous
[2:23:39] decision why was it momentous when the
[2:23:43] Prophet accepted that choice
[2:23:46] Evan was touches Oh a huge portion of
[2:23:52] heaven will have with thee what a
[2:23:55] glorious decision that was made see Evan
[2:23:59] excited about that decision and as the
[2:24:03] way is going to be excited about your
[2:24:05] lives being hero for Jesus Christ be the
[2:24:12] choice of Christ make God happy young
[2:24:22] people if you want models are give you
[2:24:24] the real models they will never die
[2:24:29] their memoria will never leave us
[2:24:32] oh my I remember I made a young girl who
[2:24:41] was taken captive by the Syrians all
[2:24:45] that galas a could torch in my heart you
[2:24:49] know why she was taken captive against
[2:24:52] her own decision it wasn't a pleasant
[2:24:56] experience
[2:24:58] you go to campuses by your desire you go
[2:25:02] to school because we wanted to become a
[2:25:04] graduate but this lady find herself in
[2:25:08] Syria not out of a volition but guess
[2:25:12] what
[2:25:12] she took God of Israel with our wherever
[2:25:18] you go take the name of Jesus with you
[2:25:21] that was the choice she made and I tell
[2:25:26] you people we are watching until one day
[2:25:31] when she gave a testimony just a
[2:25:34] testimony his excuse me says she
[2:25:40] couldn't even talk to the general
[2:25:42] himself but she talked to some maybe
[2:25:45] some people who matter you see this
[2:25:47] problem of general is a minor problem
[2:25:50] and everybody began to give here's you
[2:25:53] know why there's a life behind that
[2:25:56] testing if she's just another Syrian
[2:26:01] girl nobody will take a serious said if
[2:26:05] general will go to Israel my homeland
[2:26:09] and Guam if the prophet of God this
[2:26:14] leprosy that they have to treated in
[2:26:17] John Hopkins they've taken to Saint
[2:26:19] Victoria and all kind of saints Germany
[2:26:22] France and all over the world it's a
[2:26:25] minor problem you don't mean it I mean
[2:26:29] it you don't mean it I mean it can you
[2:26:32] give this testimony before the general
[2:26:34] himself it's even before the president
[2:26:38] then when they were sure the entire
[2:26:42] house of the general we're running up
[2:26:45] and down
[2:26:46] getting in touch with the presidency
[2:26:49] imagine if the all of us along started
[2:26:52] working doing diplomatic shuttles with
[2:26:55] Syrian country just because of the
[2:26:57] testimony of one small insignificant
[2:27:00] girl think about that and you are
[2:27:06] looking for a model that's a model
[2:27:09] wherever the gospel is being preached
[2:27:11] she will never be forgotten I mainly
[2:27:16] remember Michael Jackson today no way
[2:27:20] you know a lot of their pop whatever the
[2:27:23] ones you keep on your phones and so
[2:27:25] forth was there Memorial today your
[2:27:28] value will be too cheap if does that the
[2:27:31] people you are keeping as models I want
[2:27:34] you to know that the kingdom of God is
[2:27:38] raising royal children and royal
[2:27:42] children are not permitted to live any
[2:27:46] how to dress any how to talk any huh
[2:27:55] as long as you have a linkage to Detroit
[2:27:59] the palace must watch how you live we
[2:28:07] have a contemporary case there are two
[2:28:10] boys in England today they call him
[2:28:13] Ariana
[2:28:14] which one William I relieves the way
[2:28:18] once you know I got no link to that role
[2:28:22] even though it's a prince but the palace
[2:28:25] will never allow William to live anyhow
[2:28:29] you know why because is next in line to
[2:28:32] secession are you catching it that is
[2:28:38] the Royals of eggs in order to present
[2:28:40] to preserve the sanctity of earthly
[2:28:43] Kingdom that will soon give way do you
[2:28:49] think the palace we allow William to
[2:28:51] have married a girl re marriage there
[2:28:54] was just crew tonight that gal in
[2:28:57] marriage because II could be the next
[2:29:00] king of England

[2:29:06] I am about
[2:29:07] everly monarchy a kingdom that can never
[2:29:11] be shaken so don't take it as too much
[2:29:16] pressure from the past oh no sir

[2:29:21] it brings a princess

[2:29:28] because we shall rule and we shall reign
[2:29:31] ever right now we are ruling we are
[2:29:36] running because we have dominion of a
[2:29:40] scene of a Satan over this world
[2:29:45] Oh glory to God what a glorious decision
[2:29:55] that was made dissonant service that
[2:29:58] which will give and may come to pass
[2:30:01] tremendous victory in love divine the
[2:30:06] prophets epic losses was translated from
[2:30:08] French it might as well be tremendous

[2:30:36] to have his way in our lives you got
[2:30:40] only one choice as a Christian make him
