[13:37] i'd like to greet you tonight
[13:39] in the precious name of jesus christ
[13:41] let's just bow our heads
[13:43] for a word of prayer
[13:45] oh gracious heavenly father we thank you
[13:47] tonight for your love for your mercy for
[13:50] your grace to us
[13:52] that we could gather one more time in
[13:54] this room in your presence your word
[13:56] teaches us that where there are two or
[13:57] three gathered in your name lord there
[14:00] you are in the midst of them so we thank
[14:02] you tonight
[14:03] lord for your word that we stand upon
[14:06] tonight we are resting on this word
[14:09] lord this great message of the hour lord
[14:11] that paul would have preached that
[14:14] all the heroes of faith and the apostles
[14:16] and the prophets of all lord even to
[14:19] this day that we stand on the message of
[14:21] a 20th century prophet we pray dear god
[14:24] that your holy spirit
[14:25] lord would come upon this room tonight
[14:28] you know every person that's here
[14:30] you know what brought them here we have
[14:32] all been called here tonight by your
[14:34] love by your mercy
[14:36] lord someone may have invited us but
[14:39] lord it's your call father because no
[14:42] man could come unless the father draws
[14:44] so thank you father tonight for drawing
[14:46] us
[14:47] lord to you father there are so many
[14:49] places we could have been tonight there
[14:51] are so many things we could have been
[14:52] doing there are so many
[14:54] things we could occupy ourselves with
[14:56] them and such a blessing to be able to
[14:59] break the routine as it were
[15:01] lord and and and the hustle and the
[15:03] bustle of life that it's so easy to get
[15:05] caught up in lord to put you first we
[15:08] live in a world
[15:10] lord where it's becoming more and more
[15:12] difficult to find peace it's becoming
[15:14] more and more difficult to find safety
[15:16] it's becoming more and more difficult to
[15:19] find comfort lord but lord you promised
[15:22] to be our comforter you promised to be
[15:24] our safety you promised to be lord our
[15:28] peace in the midst of the storm so
[15:30] father may you speak to us tonight
[15:32] lord those are already in the room those
[15:34] that could join us as we proceed tonight
[15:36] may you take me out of the way
[15:38] lord and may you take us all out of the
[15:41] way so we can be sensitive to hear from
[15:43] you
[15:44] lord we are here tonight lord to hear
[15:46] from you lord not to hear my thoughts
[15:48] are here our ideas but lord to go into
[15:51] your sacred scripture law that has been
[15:54] given to us for correction for
[15:56] admonition for encouragement so we can
[15:59] become more like you so we dedicate this
[16:01] service tonight to you and lord if
[16:03] there's anyone sick in our midst tonight
[16:06] lord may you heal your people father you
[16:08] know every need every situation every
[16:11] condition lord i want to
[16:13] lord lift up the south family brother
[16:15] kelly would have spoken
[16:17] got in our testimony service last friday
[16:19] and how the enemy has waged an attack
[16:21] against his house so father we pray dear
[16:24] god that the angel of the lord would
[16:26] pass his way tonight
[16:28] lord and would minister to that
[16:30] situation father lord and bring great
[16:33] peace in the midst of their storm father
[16:36] lord and for everyone here tonight
[16:37] whatever it is sickness depression
[16:40] frustration doubt fear uncertainty
[16:42] unbelief we take every spirit tonight
[16:45] under our control by the authority of
[16:47] the lord jesus christ father may tonight
[16:50] be a turning point for somebody tonight
[16:53] be a night of permanent transformation
[16:56] for somebody because you teach us that
[16:58] we are to be transformed by the renewing
[17:00] of our minds may you speak to us and
[17:02] and bless us in a special way in the
[17:04] precious team of jesus christ amen and
[17:07] amen
[17:08] and amen it's certainly a great
[17:09] privilege to be here one more time for
[17:12] our bible study our conversation it's
[17:14] not a preaching service it's a
[17:16] conversation around the word of god
[17:20] where we could sit and have a a fireside
[17:23] chat or a conversation around scripture
[17:25] and around how we want to get stronger
[17:27] as believers in god so we certainly
[17:29] welcome you tonight and
[17:30] for our visitors in our gates and those
[17:33] who have been specially invited we are
[17:35] so happy that you take up your time to
[17:36] join us
[17:38] tonight and we salute you although we
[17:40] can't see
[17:41] most of you you are welcome and we are
[17:44] so happy to have you here with us
[17:46] uh tonight and by the grace of god
[17:49] to spend some time in fellowship with
[17:51] the word of the lord you know and uh
[17:54] i want to encourage you that if you're
[17:56] here tonight it's not by accident i
[17:58] don't believe
[17:59] that anything is accidental
[18:02] i don't believe anything is by chance
[18:04] i believe that god has a plan and a
[18:06] purpose for our lives and whether we
[18:09] know it or we don't know it or we
[18:10] understand it or don't understand it
[18:13] doesn't change the fact that god has a
[18:14] plan
[18:15] for our lives tonight so
[18:18] i want to just have a conversation
[18:20] tonight about a
[18:21] interesting topic i call it interesting
[18:24] topic it's something that
[18:25] we are familiar with we understand it we
[18:27] know it but i just want to revisit it
[18:30] because i think it is as we get closer
[18:32] to the ending of this world
[18:34] you know within recent times there's
[18:36] been so much said about the ending of
[18:38] will and the ending of time and the time
[18:40] of the end and these things but as we
[18:42] get closer to the ending of time and
[18:45] ending of the world
[18:47] it forces us to reflect on what's really
[18:49] important
[18:50] you know there's a lot of things that we
[18:52] could do a lot of things we could say
[18:54] and at the end of the day it may not be
[18:56] important you know i say it in the
[18:58] corporate world people do a lot of
[19:00] activity that may not be true
[19:02] productivity you know and as we
[19:04] challenge ourselves to be great
[19:06] christians and to be yielded and to be
[19:09] surrendered
[19:10] it is so important for us to come back
[19:14] to what's important and uh
[19:16] so i want to start off by saying you
[19:18] know as a young child growing up
[19:21] you know i remember being in school and
[19:23] in particular in primary school
[19:25] and you always have
[19:28] you know some teachers who would say boy
[19:30] them children had had a boy
[19:32] you know anybody ever ever hear a
[19:34] teacher say something like that i'm sure
[19:35] and ahead hard boy oh gosh yeah
[19:37] listening and i tell him to do this
[19:40] thing and just teach you any easy and
[19:42] it's not just teachers say it you have
[19:44] you have parents who say oh gosh
[19:47] i'm cheering they don't want to listen i
[19:49] tell him to do this i tell him dude i
[19:50] tell him don't go down the road by tommy
[19:53] don't spend time
[19:54] and at the end of the day what what
[19:55] really it is
[19:58] is there's this struggle
[20:00] to not just listen
[20:02] but i would call it to follow
[20:04] instructions initially but beyond that
[20:08] is really an issue of obedience
[20:10] and when you look at it from a deeper
[20:11] perspective
[20:13] as a child and i'm blessed with a
[20:15] two-year-old
[20:16] and and once children begin to learn the
[20:18] word no
[20:19] without even being trained on certain
[20:21] things it's almost like do this no
[20:24] and and it's a process i i don't know
[20:26] any child who didn't go through a period
[20:28] where they start to use you would know
[20:29] even if they don't under understand the
[20:31] full implications of it it is something
[20:33] that's built in to almost begin to
[20:35] resist and it's not just resistance out
[20:37] of a desire to resist it is the birth of
[20:41] will
[20:42] it is the birth of
[20:44] their own desire to express themselves
[20:46] so you tell them it's time to go to bed
[20:48] and it's no because they actually want
[20:50] to do something else and it may be very
[20:53] well that you're telling someone that
[20:54] this is the most important thing for you
[20:57] to be doing but
[20:58] because will is being formed and ideas
[21:02] and opinions and the way things should
[21:04] be even in that small mind there's a
[21:07] challenge
[21:08] of obedience
[21:11] and in building on this
[21:13] when we really trace back to the first
[21:15] sin on earth the very first sin that was
[21:17] committed
[21:19] on earth when you really analyze it and
[21:21] and to even get to the first sin on
[21:23] earth you need to to go even before
[21:26] it to the first sin that ever was was
[21:28] the sin of pride
[21:30] because lucifer
[21:32] was lifted up by pride you know in
[21:34] scripture
[21:35] and he looked at
[21:37] what was taking place in heaven
[21:40] and he will see i will be like
[21:43] and he had this desire to be like god
[21:45] and we know there was war in heaven that
[21:46] fell on the earth
[21:48] so the first sin that we could ever
[21:49] record is a sin of pride
[21:51] followed by the next sin which was not a
[21:54] sin committed by man
[21:56] but the devil again performed what would
[21:58] be the first sin on earth which was a
[22:01] lie being told that you will not die
[22:04] so students of scripture
[22:07] would know that when the devil came to
[22:09] speak to eve and say what did god
[22:12] say
[22:14] up until this point when eve was having
[22:16] a conversation
[22:18] man had not sinned
[22:21] the devil was continuing in the spirit
[22:23] of sin and he would lie and say you will
[22:25] not die
[22:26] and that lie itself was sin
[22:29] but the first sin that man really
[22:30] committed was disobedience
[22:33] because the instruction given to man was
[22:36] and if you read it in the book of
[22:38] genesis 2 this is just layna background
[22:40] for my thought tonight
[22:42] and the lord god
[22:44] took the man and put him into the garden
[22:46] of eden to dress it and to keep it and
[22:48] the lord god commanded the man saying of
[22:51] every tree of the garden thou mayest
[22:53] freely eat
[22:54] but at the tree of the knowledge of good
[22:56] and evil thou shalt not eat of it for in
[22:58] the day that thou eat is thereof thou
[23:00] shalt surely die
[23:02] so it was really a simple thing man had
[23:05] a access opportunity to do every single
[23:08] thing but one thing
[23:10] and life or death hinged on one simple
[23:13] thing just ob
[23:15] if you just stuck to this one rule
[23:18] if adam and eve had just stuck to this
[23:20] one rule and leave this tree alone
[23:24] we would not be where we at tonight
[23:27] but the lie that satan told that says
[23:29] it's okay
[23:30] to disobey god
[23:33] it's okay
[23:34] for a different outcome
[23:36] than what god said led to
[23:38] disobedience
[23:41] obedience and disobedience affect us
[23:45] on a daily basis
[23:47] they are natural consequences of
[23:49] disobedience i'm just building into my
[23:51] thought a little bit
[23:53] some people say well i don't listen to
[23:54] nobody i don't wanna tell me anything
[23:58] in a very simplest of sense in a natural
[24:00] law perspective
[24:02] a traffic light turns red
[24:06] you could choose to obey
[24:08] or you could choose that this would be
[24:10] it's very simple you choose to obey the
[24:12] red light
[24:14] then you in a
[24:16] structure of of of of order as it were
[24:19] and if you choose a disobedient red
[24:21] light
[24:22] then you run the risk of it's obvious an
[24:24] accident whether you get hurt or not it
[24:26] could be somebody else affected but the
[24:28] point is there's a choice to obey or not
[24:32] to obey
[24:33] there are people who disrespect their
[24:35] neighbors disrespect the boss disrespect
[24:37] whatever they want but you know what
[24:39] they will never break a red light
[24:41] because they value their lives
[24:44] so we find a situation that people are
[24:46] selectively obedient
[24:48] and selectively disobedient all right so
[24:51] it is really natural as it is in your
[24:53] spiritual
[24:54] our boss tells us to do something we
[24:56] don't do it
[24:58] for some of us depending on where we
[25:00] work we get right up we get suspended
[25:02] there are consequences of the action
[25:04] and for some reason we are selectively
[25:06] disobedient or obedient depending on
[25:09] situations that confront us
[25:12] even now here in our beautiful country
[25:15] we have a curfew
[25:16] you could choose you have a choice
[25:18] you could choose the obedience of you or
[25:20] you could choose a disobedience you if
[25:22] you feeling adventurous you could choose
[25:24] to drive out if you'd love your past and
[25:26] drive on your road at 11 pm
[25:28] see what happened
[25:29] you have a choice you could obey and
[25:31] disobey
[25:34] but not everything is just clear cut
[25:37] not everything is as simple as
[25:40] one way or the other this or that
[25:43] our doctors tell us stop eating fried
[25:45] foods
[25:47] and even in that we are selective
[25:50] sometimes you will be
[25:52] sometime if we fry food look very good
[25:54] we disobey
[25:55] depending on the sauce you put on it
[25:57] depending on his
[25:59] barbecue honey barbecue
[26:01] honey mustard not just
[26:04] somehow the control
[26:06] or the discipline we would have had
[26:08] breaks down depending on the situation
[26:11] don't drink sugar don't drink soft drink
[26:13] eat more vegetables somebody said i
[26:15] thought this is bible study so i'm like
[26:16] a hell class
[26:18] the point is is a principle of how
[26:22] because of our will we choose how we
[26:25] want to respond to situations and if we
[26:28] choose to listen
[26:30] or not
[26:32] eat more vegetables you have a choice
[26:34] will be
[26:35] this will be get more rest you have a
[26:37] choice
[26:38] will be
[26:39] this will be
[26:41] the opportunity to obey or disobey can
[26:44] come as a result of a command so
[26:46] somebody commands us to do something go
[26:48] on what you wish
[26:52] some people child
[26:54] not not to do it disobey choose to do it
[26:56] obey go what you as you wash some things
[26:59] i remember years ago
[27:01] wash the words and you wash all the
[27:03] little plates something and you leave
[27:04] your pot the souk anybody know what a
[27:06] document this perpetual put that always
[27:09] soaking
[27:10] so you obey no i wash it but uh as far
[27:13] as you know you wash all the ways by the
[27:14] pot sensor again it's not a complete job
[27:17] but you could at least say i wash it but
[27:19] holy parts soak in convenient
[27:22] so it could come as a result of a
[27:24] command so somebody commands a student
[27:26] something and we choose to obey or not
[27:27] obey a suggestion
[27:29] or it could even be a desire somebody
[27:31] has and we choose to respond
[27:33] to that
[27:34] tonight for a few minutes i want to
[27:36] speak about the curse
[27:39] of disobedience
[27:41] and this is taken from a biblical
[27:43] perspective
[27:45] and to lay a foundation i want to start
[27:47] if you have your bibles
[27:49] in the book of deuteronomy
[27:51] chapter 11
[27:53] and we're going to lay this as a
[27:54] foundation and then we're going to cut a
[27:55] few scriptures
[27:57] not going to be too long with you
[27:58] tonight
[28:00] deuteronomy 11 verse 1
[28:03] and see here how god is speaking
[28:06] through this scripture here
[28:09] deuteronomy
[28:10] 11 verse 1 therefore
[28:13] thou shalt love the lord thy god
[28:17] and keep his charge
[28:19] and his statutes
[28:22] and his judgment
[28:24] and his commandments always
[28:27] that's pretty clear cut right thou shalt
[28:30] love the lord thy god
[28:33] so the way this is written
[28:35] shout love is actually a commander it's
[28:37] not a suggestion it's not a
[28:38] recommendation so already in that first
[28:41] scripture you're reading here we are
[28:42] being instructed that thou shalt love
[28:45] the lord thy god and keep his charge and
[28:47] his statutes and his judgment and his
[28:49] commandments in other words
[28:51] if this is now a requirement then we
[28:53] need to understand what his charges his
[28:55] statutes his judgment and his
[28:56] commandments always
[28:58] annoy this day for i speak not with your
[29:02] children which have not known in other
[29:03] words
[29:05] what this is saying and as moses is
[29:07] speaking here
[29:09] i speak with your children which have
[29:11] not known
[29:12] and which have not seen the chastisement
[29:14] of the lord your god his greatest mighty
[29:16] hand and his stretched out arm
[29:19] in other words all you know
[29:21] you you have experienced enough and if
[29:23] you're in this room tonight it doesn't
[29:25] matter if you've been in church 20 years
[29:27] ago 40 years ago there are some things
[29:29] you know there's some things you
[29:30] understand
[29:31] so moses is building up background here
[29:33] and he's saying in history and his
[29:34] miracles in other words his miracles and
[29:37] his acts are real which he did in the
[29:39] midst of egypt
[29:40] unto pharaoh the king of egypt and unto
[29:43] all his land
[29:44] we know these things verse 4 and what he
[29:47] did unto the army of egypt we know these
[29:49] things onto their horses
[29:51] and to their chariots
[29:53] how he made the water of the red sea to
[29:55] overflow them as they pursued after you
[29:58] so he's building into something and as
[30:00] god often does he reminds them first
[30:04] before he lays what he wants to to place
[30:06] upon them so he's taking them down
[30:08] memory lane
[30:09] he's taking them down through what
[30:11] you've been through and if you're here
[30:12] tonight
[30:13] there's something god has taken you
[30:15] through you can look back and say it was
[30:16] the lord
[30:17] so moses is sharing with them and he's
[30:20] reminding them the same god who took you
[30:22] through wants to say something to you
[30:23] tonight and what he did to the army of
[30:26] egypt onto their horses and their
[30:28] chariots how he made a water of the
[30:30] ready to overflow them as they pursued
[30:32] after you and how the lord had destroyed
[30:34] them unto this day
[30:36] and what he did unto you in the
[30:38] wilderness until he came onto this place
[30:41] so god is reminding them now of how you
[30:43] got here in other words you're not here
[30:45] by chance
[30:47] you didn't even make it to this room
[30:48] tonight by chance you didn't make it to
[30:51] this month by chance it is day by chance
[30:53] to where you at in your life because
[30:54] there's so many things that have
[30:55] happened along the journey but it's not
[30:57] by chance it was the lord who was coming
[31:00] along the journey with you to bring you
[31:02] to this spot
[31:03] verse six and what he did unto daythan
[31:06] and abiram the sons of elia the son of
[31:09] ruben how the earth opened her mouth and
[31:10] swallowed them up so he's reminding them
[31:12] also not just of how he delivered them
[31:15] but of his judgment because this verse
[31:17] is judgment based on disobedience and
[31:20] based on bad attitudes and based on
[31:23] failure to adhere to the laws of god and
[31:25] their household and their tents and all
[31:27] the substance that was in their
[31:29] possession in the midst of all israel
[31:31] verse seven but your eyes have seen all
[31:34] the great acts of the lord which he did
[31:36] therefore
[31:38] so moses is not saying reinforcing now
[31:40] after having said all this
[31:42] know that you know all this therefore
[31:44] influence it shall ye keep all
[31:48] and if you have a physical bible on the
[31:50] line all
[31:51] if you have a digital vision highlight
[31:54] all the commandments which i command you
[31:57] this day
[31:58] that he may be strong and go in and
[32:02] possess the land
[32:04] whether you go to possess it
[32:06] and that he may prolong your days in the
[32:08] land so we see a connection between
[32:11] keeping commandments and prolong in your
[32:14] life
[32:16] which the lord swear unto your fathers
[32:18] to give unto you and to their seed a
[32:20] land that flowed with milk and honey
[32:23] for the land whether thou goes in to
[32:25] possess it is not as the land of egypt
[32:28] from whence he came
[32:30] out where they saw this their seed and
[32:33] waters it with thy foot as a garden of
[32:35] herbs in other words it's a different
[32:36] kind of land we're going into but a land
[32:39] whether you go to possess the land
[32:40] you're going into it is a land of hills
[32:42] and valleys
[32:43] and drinking water of the rain of the
[32:46] heaven
[32:47] a land which the lord thy god clear it
[32:50] for
[32:51] the eyes of the lord thy god are always
[32:53] upon it
[32:54] so god is interested in this thing it's
[32:56] not it's not that bike inviting is that
[32:59] a haphazard thing it's not it's not a
[33:01] feeling to do something and god doesn't
[33:03] operate like that
[33:05] because he discovered that the eyes of
[33:07] the lord thy god are always upon it do
[33:10] you realize that the eyes of the lord
[33:11] are always upon you
[33:13] is that a sometimes thing when you wake
[33:15] up in the morning even when you do even
[33:18] pray he's still interested in how your
[33:20] day goes
[33:21] when you don't even acknowledge him
[33:23] because you are part of him
[33:26] as a father
[33:28] he still is interested in you
[33:32] the eyes of the lord that god are always
[33:33] upon it from the beginning of the year
[33:35] listen even until the end of the year
[33:38] so moses saying it does stop when the
[33:40] year started watching it when the year
[33:43] end he watching it he is always watching
[33:45] it there's no vocation with god it's
[33:47] it's not in the morning thing it's not
[33:49] when you're in church on a sunday on a
[33:51] wednesday it's a it's a 24 7 a permanent
[33:55] understanding that god has an interest
[33:58] and a desire about this thing
[34:00] and if this is land physical land we're
[34:03] talking about here how much more tonight
[34:05] do you think god has a permanent
[34:07] interest and desire in the beginning of
[34:09] the year till the end of the year
[34:12] to have his eyes always upon you his
[34:14] eyes always upon me his eyes always upon
[34:17] us anybody with me tonight
[34:20] verse 13 and it shall come to pass
[34:22] listen to the conditionality of it
[34:26] and this is what i really want to kind
[34:27] of get there are some conditions to this
[34:30] thing
[34:31] and it shall come to pass if ye shall
[34:34] harken diligently unto my commandments
[34:37] so it is not just hearken unto my
[34:39] commandments now but it's harken
[34:41] diligently what does diligently mean
[34:44] there's a level of enthusiasm a level of
[34:46] effort there's a passion there's a drive
[34:49] there's a tenacity there's something
[34:51] within you that makes this a priority
[34:53] anybody with me and it shall come to
[34:55] pass if you shall hearken diligently
[34:58] unto my commandments
[35:00] which i command you this day listen to
[35:03] love the lord your god
[35:06] that's the foundational commandment
[35:08] there to love the lord your god and to
[35:11] serve him with all your heart and with
[35:14] all your soul
[35:16] this is not a command to say draw up a
[35:18] mountain jump off a cliff and i'm
[35:19] talking that tonight the command is to
[35:22] love the lord your god and to serve him
[35:24] with all your heart
[35:26] and with all your soul if this as a
[35:29] foundational command
[35:31] you hearken diligently onto this command
[35:34] because you see love
[35:35] love makes you do strange things
[35:40] i always preach this love makes you do
[35:42] strange things so if you really love the
[35:44] lord your god you want to please him you
[35:46] want to serve him and then obeying
[35:49] everything else becomes natural
[35:51] because it's now a love relationship
[35:53] anybody with me let's build
[35:55] so they can the conditionality goes on
[35:58] if you do this verse 14 that i will give
[36:00] you the reign of your land in his due
[36:03] season in other words when it's supposed
[36:05] to come it will come
[36:06] when your blessing is supposed to come
[36:08] it will come that's what rain is raining
[36:10] is a blessing rain is to bring harvest
[36:12] anybody with me that it will i will give
[36:14] you the reign of your land in his due
[36:16] season the first ring and the lattering
[36:20] that thomas gather in thy corn and thy
[36:23] wine and then oil
[36:25] and i so it's no longer about you
[36:28] so the moment you become an obedient son
[36:31] an obedient daughter to god anybody with
[36:33] me the moment there's a shift in your
[36:36] life so a wholehearted commitment not a
[36:39] half-hearted commitment not a sometimes
[36:41] commitment the moment this becomes a
[36:43] reality to each of us
[36:45] verse 15 and i will send grass in thy
[36:48] fields for thy cattle so god is now
[36:51] saying i will provide for every aspect
[36:54] of what your sustenance needs that
[36:56] thomas eat and be full anybody with me
[36:59] take heed to yourselves that your heart
[37:02] be not deceived and he turn aside and
[37:05] serve other gods and worship them
[37:09] and then the lord's wrath be kindled
[37:11] against you and he shut up the heaven
[37:14] that there be no real
[37:16] and the land you'll not have fruit so
[37:18] he's saying take heed this is a warning
[37:20] tonight
[37:21] that your heart don't get deceived and
[37:22] this is the age living in in an age of
[37:24] deception
[37:26] many people who stood faithful to the
[37:28] cause of christ hearts have been
[37:30] deceived
[37:31] they have lost their joy they lost the
[37:33] peace they lost the burden they lost the
[37:36] cry for lost souls
[37:38] anybody with me
[37:40] so he's saying this is the consequence
[37:42] of your heart being deceived and when
[37:44] you turn aside and serve other gods what
[37:46] other gods this is not a god of just a
[37:50] idol of a for or any random thing you
[37:52] know anything is your god for some of us
[37:55] here our work is is god
[37:58] our car is good our savings is good our
[38:00] attitude towards we we have all kind of
[38:02] other things that that take our worship
[38:05] because worship is about your time
[38:07] worship is about your effort worship is
[38:09] where you spend your energy you spend
[38:11] your resources you spend your thinking
[38:13] all that forms part of your worship
[38:15] verse 17 and then the lord's wrath be
[38:17] kindled against you and he shut up the
[38:20] heaven
[38:21] that there be no rain and that the land
[38:23] yield not of fruit unless he perished
[38:26] quickly from off the good land which the
[38:28] lord gave it to you
[38:29] you see the consequence there
[38:31] verse 18 therefore i'm still laying a
[38:33] foundation therefore shall we lay up
[38:35] these my words in your heart in other
[38:37] words gather these words in your heart
[38:40] tonight from this day forward and in
[38:42] your soul and bind them for a sign up on
[38:45] your hand
[38:47] that they may be that they may be as
[38:49] frontlets between your eyes
[38:52] don't lose focus
[38:54] don't get distracted
[38:56] and listen parents in this room tonight
[38:59] mentors in this room tonight guardians
[39:01] in this room tonight look how god true
[39:03] moses is placing responsibility and ye
[39:06] shall teach them your children speaking
[39:09] of them when their citizens nine house
[39:11] what conversations do you spend time
[39:14] with as parents with your children in
[39:15] your house
[39:18] anybody with me tonight
[39:20] whose responsibility is it to teach your
[39:23] children in your house
[39:26] what are you teaching your children in
[39:28] your house
[39:31] and we continue and when the walk is by
[39:33] the way when the lie is down and when
[39:36] they'll rise it up
[39:38] verse 20 and thou shalt write them upon
[39:40] the doorpost of their house and upon
[39:42] their gates
[39:43] what does this mean
[39:45] this means your your whole environment
[39:47] god teaching them control your
[39:49] environment as best as you can
[39:51] you can't control your neighbor house
[39:53] but what are you doing in your house you
[39:56] can't control what music playing your
[39:57] neighbor car what other people do but
[40:00] what are you doing in the area of your
[40:02] influence because you have an influence
[40:05] whether it's your room in your house
[40:07] whether it's your
[40:08] mattress and you on the top bunk
[40:11] whatever is your sphere what is your
[40:13] cubicle on your job
[40:15] because this is a practical gospel this
[40:18] is not a on a sunday a feeling for this
[40:20] or no no no no he's saying and he said
[40:22] write it up on your door post
[40:26] what quotes do you live by what
[40:28] scriptures do you put in on on sticky
[40:30] notes
[40:31] what's the what's the word paper on your
[40:32] phone
[40:34] because these are now the versions thank
[40:36] you to hanno dopos you have your phone
[40:39] and and what you choose to put as the
[40:41] image on your phone what your sticky
[40:43] note is speaks volumes about what is
[40:46] important to you anybody with me
[40:48] this is a different kind of thing
[40:50] because it's about life it's about
[40:52] godliness it's about the practical
[40:54] application
[40:55] of what we could control we appreciate
[40:58] tonight we can't control a lot of
[40:59] different things
[41:01] but god gave me these strengths that the
[41:03] things i have influence over i do my
[41:05] very best to live for him is that your
[41:07] desire tonight
[41:09] is that your prayer tonight that the
[41:11] things you could control you do your
[41:13] absolute best with it
[41:15] verse 20 and thou shalt write
[41:18] them upon the doorposts of thine house
[41:21] and upon thy gates
[41:23] that listen listen to the to the result
[41:26] of doing these things that your days may
[41:29] be multiplied
[41:31] and the days of your children
[41:36] so you see there's a connection between
[41:39] your life and your children based on
[41:41] your obedience
[41:43] anybody with me
[41:45] your obedience through this scripture is
[41:48] correlated there's a relationship
[41:50] there's a correlation
[41:52] there there's a connection between your
[41:54] response to god's word and your own life
[41:58] and the life of your children anybody
[41:59] would be tonight
[42:01] in the land which the lord swear unto
[42:02] your fathers to give them as the days of
[42:04] heaven upon the earth
[42:07] moses is reinforcing it you can see the
[42:10] urgency the importance the gravity the
[42:13] not taking it lightly
[42:14] verse 22 for if ye shall diligently keep
[42:18] all these commandments which i command
[42:20] you to do them to love the lord your god
[42:24] to walk in all his ways and to cleave
[42:27] unto him
[42:28] can i say that one more time
[42:30] love the lord your god
[42:32] walk in all his ways
[42:36] and to cleave unto him cleave means to
[42:38] pursue
[42:39] to attach
[42:41] are you attaching yourself to the things
[42:43] of god
[42:44] what what are you attached to what are
[42:46] you attracted to what are you connected
[42:48] to what what are you being influenced by
[42:53] somebody say well well i i go to church
[42:54] on a saturday you know i just play my
[42:56] gospel music kind of listen to books as
[42:58] read the prophet books that's really
[43:00] bible and stuff but but there there are
[43:02] there are days i call it between sundays
[43:05] and when you put down the bible what are
[43:07] you doing then
[43:09] because this is saying to love the lord
[43:11] your god walk in all his ways and to
[43:13] cleave unto him which means cleave me to
[43:16] pursue to follow to attach
[43:20] verse 23 we're still in this one
[43:21] scripture this is supposed to be the
[43:22] background but
[43:24] it seems to be hell a modern background
[43:26] then will the lord drive out all these
[43:28] nations from before you
[43:30] and ye shall possess greater nations and
[43:33] mightier than yourselves
[43:35] so god is saying just by obedience
[43:39] anybody with me just by obedience
[43:42] situations that you meet that are
[43:44] greater than you you will get grace and
[43:46] strength to deal with them
[43:48] isn't that an encouragement to us
[43:51] possess greater nations and mightier
[43:54] than yourselves now every place this is
[43:57] similar to what you will read in in in
[43:59] in joshua every place where on the souls
[44:02] of your feet shall tread shall be yours
[44:05] from the wilderness
[44:06] and lebanon from the river the river
[44:08] euphrates even unto the uttermost sea
[44:11] shall your coast be
[44:13] there shall no man be able to stand
[44:15] before thee for the lord your god shall
[44:17] lay listen the fear of you and the dread
[44:21] of you upon all the land that you shall
[44:23] tread upon as he had said unto you in
[44:25] other words god will will so enlarge
[44:28] your territory
[44:30] anybody with me
[44:32] building tonight
[44:34] this is what i want to build into now
[44:35] verse 26 behold tonight
[44:39] on this second of november to reinforce
[44:41] this i set
[44:43] before you this day a blessing
[44:46] and a curse
[44:49] a blessing if ye obey the commandments
[44:52] of the lord your god which i command you
[44:55] this day
[44:56] and a curse
[44:58] if he will not obey the commandment of
[45:00] the lord your god but turn aside out of
[45:03] the way which i command you this day to
[45:06] go after other gods which you have not
[45:09] known
[45:11] so for a few minutes not going to be too
[45:14] long i want to speak on the curse
[45:17] of disobedience
[45:20] as an encouragement as a warning as food
[45:23] for thought from a biblical perspective
[45:26] sin john 14 15
[45:29] the bible says if you love me keep my
[45:32] commandments
[45:34] how many people say that they love god
[45:37] and if you really do and god say if you
[45:39] really love me
[45:40] the love is not a word as in saying i
[45:43] love god
[45:44] but it is evidenced by how you keep his
[45:48] commandments
[45:49] but to keep his commandments you need to
[45:50] know him and know his commandments
[45:52] because that that means you're ready
[45:54] love
[45:55] so it now begs a deeper issue of your
[45:57] relationship with god
[45:59] your study of his word to know what
[46:02] god's desires his commands his wishes
[46:06] what he wants you to do how he wants you
[46:08] to live so that it becomes your command
[46:11] and you keep it
[46:13] and it's going to go through a few
[46:14] scriptures and i trust it encourages you
[46:16] a little bit
[46:17] let's bring it home
[46:20] to the family
[46:21] to the young people in this room
[46:24] ephesians 6 1.
[46:28] so this thing about obedience
[46:30] because now god is placing obedience to
[46:33] him but there are also other levels of
[46:36] this thing listen to this now ephesians
[46:37] 6 1
[46:38] children obey your appearance in the
[46:41] lord for this is right
[46:46] appalling for a minute on it
[46:49] because it's a real struggle as a young
[46:51] person
[46:53] to say that you're trying to serve goal
[46:55] and you're struggling to obey your
[46:57] parents
[46:58] and especially for those of you in here
[47:00] who
[47:02] are in homes where your parents trying
[47:04] their very best to do the very best to
[47:07] lead you along the right path
[47:09] and you struggling to listen to good
[47:12] advice good recommendations i'm not
[47:14] saying they know everything but at the
[47:16] end of the day there's a law and it's a
[47:18] scripture obey your appearance in the
[47:20] lord
[47:21] and in the amplified it means as god's
[47:24] representative because god placed
[47:27] parents
[47:28] as your stewards and your guardians to
[47:31] to show you things that you haven't seen
[47:33] just yet
[47:34] anybody with me
[47:36] paul didn't just say this to the
[47:38] ephesians we read it there most often
[47:40] but in colossians 3 20
[47:43] he said children obey appearance in all
[47:45] things for this is well pleasing unto
[47:47] the lord
[47:49] so if something is pleasing to the lord
[47:51] so paul is saying
[47:53] if you don't want to do it for for your
[47:55] parents sake
[47:56] this is actually pleasing to the lord
[47:58] you know
[48:01] so exactly a double benefit children
[48:03] obey prince oh for this is well pleasing
[48:05] unto the lord
[48:08] and brother ovid would have preached on
[48:10] this in our study or spoken into the
[48:12] bible two studies ago i believe it was
[48:14] titus 3 1
[48:16] put them in mind to be subject to
[48:18] principalities and powers to obey
[48:21] magistrates to be ready to every good
[48:23] work
[48:24] this is christian conduct this is
[48:27] christian behavior this is christian
[48:29] order
[48:31] hebrews 5 8
[48:33] and this scripture
[48:35] is
[48:36] one that really inspired this particular
[48:39] teaching tonight because to this day
[48:42] it still blows my mind hebrews 5 8
[48:46] though he were a son speaking about
[48:48] jesus
[48:50] yet learned he obedience
[48:53] by the things which he suffered
[48:56] that itself is a mind blowing boost
[49:00] and being made perfect he became the
[49:02] author of eternal salvation unto all
[49:05] them that obey him
[49:10] anybody with me i want to read that one
[49:11] more time though he was
[49:14] son and if you read this in the
[49:16] amplifier this is the son who never
[49:18] disobeyed his father
[49:19] that's the amplified
[49:21] so it is not that jesus was disobedient
[49:23] to them
[49:27] jesus can't disobey god
[49:30] and it's it's a deep teaching here
[49:32] though he were a son
[49:34] who never disobeyed his father
[49:36] yet learned he obedience
[49:39] which means there's there's deeper
[49:42] levels of obedience
[49:44] and this learning obedience really have
[49:46] to now connect with will
[49:49] because when you think about it and i
[49:51] was sharing this with brother over this
[49:52] world jesus didn't have a problem with
[49:54] sin
[49:55] think about it
[49:56] jesus didn't have a problem with sin
[49:58] sin was not something that he struggled
[50:00] with
[50:02] jesus had if i could say it like this
[50:04] carefully say like this only one
[50:06] struggle
[50:08] and that was his struggle of will
[50:11] and that's how powerful will is
[50:13] as a struggle for us
[50:15] because will is not connected to our
[50:17] choice and our desires our desires to do
[50:21] certain things
[50:22] so we see for example that
[50:25] that jesus in the garden of gethsemane
[50:27] is praying say lord if it is possible
[50:30] let this cup pass
[50:33] jesus knew what his mission was
[50:36] he knew what he was there to do
[50:39] but at that point in time
[50:41] the struggle that jesus had was his will
[50:44] because he would say nevertheless not my
[50:47] will meaning
[50:49] he actually had a will
[50:52] he actually had a choice
[50:55] like all of us tonight have a will
[50:57] and all of us tonight have a choice
[51:01] but jesus subjected his will which was
[51:04] his struggle
[51:05] to obedience which meant to god's will
[51:08] so he says it like this nevertheless not
[51:10] my will but i will be done die purpose
[51:15] in other words
[51:16] i'm going to be i'm going to subject
[51:18] myself
[51:20] it's a hard thing i have to go through
[51:22] because the cross was difficult calvary
[51:24] was difficult it was not walk in the
[51:26] park
[51:28] and his understanding of that was the
[51:32] struggle the fact that there were
[51:35] a decision
[51:36] actions consequences
[51:38] that were about to unfold in his life
[51:40] that were unfavorable
[51:43] and his will rose up because it who
[51:46] wants to go and get licks and beaten
[51:49] and spit upon and mocked and get nails
[51:51] in their hands nobody volunteering
[51:55] and it shows the authenticity of this
[51:58] because jesus didn't just walk to the
[51:59] cross
[52:01] how different would this story be this
[52:03] teaching be this reality be if we didn't
[52:07] understand that it was actually a point
[52:09] where
[52:10] jesus hesitated
[52:13] questioned
[52:15] struggled cried say lord if it's
[52:17] possible
[52:18] is there a chance that i do have to go
[52:20] to calvary
[52:22] is there a chance that i don't have to
[52:24] take this burden is there a chance i
[52:27] don't have to die
[52:29] that's the reality of it you know
[52:32] but you know what my will my desire
[52:36] it may not be an evil will or evil
[52:38] desire you know but am i truly
[52:40] surrendered to god's will for my life
[52:43] that's a deeper question tonight let's
[52:45] go
[52:47] colossians 3 22
[52:50] servants obey in all things your masters
[52:52] are quality of the flesh not with eye
[52:54] service as men pleasers but in sickness
[52:58] of heart fearing god i always challenge
[53:01] people
[53:02] i don't care how rough your job is
[53:05] not everybody has the best job or the
[53:07] happiest job or whatever it is but in
[53:09] wherever god is blessing you because you
[53:10] need to see it as a blessing
[53:12] you serve god
[53:14] in your job
[53:16] and paul is saying to the colossians
[53:18] servants workers obeying all things your
[53:21] masters according to the flesh not with
[53:22] i service
[53:25] as men pleasers
[53:26] some people do their job because they
[53:28] want the boss to see them and and once
[53:30] the balls are proven and they're not
[53:31] doing it from the heart
[53:33] but paul is saying but in sickness of
[53:35] heart fear and god so what you do you're
[53:37] doing it not unto man but unto the lord
[53:40] just a few more
[53:42] exodus 23 20
[53:46] behold i sent an angel before thee to
[53:48] keep thee in the way
[53:50] and to bring thee into the place which i
[53:52] have prepared
[53:54] beware of him and obey his voice it is
[53:57] really clear
[54:00] provoke him not
[54:02] for he will not pardon your
[54:04] transgressions for my name is in him
[54:07] but if thou shalt indeed obey his voice
[54:11] and do all that i speak again we keep
[54:14] hearing about obedience and doing all
[54:16] the problem today friend is we have too
[54:18] much part-time christians
[54:23] too many part-time christians who
[54:26] believe that this gospel is a buffet
[54:28] style arrangement
[54:30] well i take in this and this i'm not
[54:32] taking this
[54:33] i already like that because that there
[54:35] really is against my will i like that
[54:37] much control i'm an independent i'm a
[54:39] i'm an independent kind of person
[54:46] but if thou shall indeed obey his voice
[54:48] and do all that i speak then i will be
[54:50] an enemy unto thy enemies and an
[54:52] adversary unto thine adversaries
[54:58] jeremiah 7 23 but this thing commanded i
[55:03] them saying obey my voice and i will be
[55:06] your god and you shall be my people and
[55:08] walk ye in all the ways that i have
[55:11] commanded you
[55:12] that it may be well unto you
[55:15] you say anybody tonight
[55:17] wants it to be well with them
[55:21] situations in your life and they say oh
[55:23] boy if if i could get a change if
[55:25] something could be well something is not
[55:27] well somebody's not right something
[55:30] here is a law and a principle obey my
[55:33] voice i'll be your god and it shall be
[55:34] my people and walking in all the ways
[55:38] again we see this constant repetition of
[55:41] all the ways that i've commanded you
[55:45] i hope this is challenging you tonight
[55:46] you know this is not i know it's not for
[55:48] everybody
[55:50] i know there are people who
[55:51] in all areas of their lives they like
[55:54] mediocrity
[55:55] they like barely doing it
[55:58] doing it halfway
[56:00] doing just enough to get by
[56:03] aren't you tired of doing just enough to
[56:05] get by
[56:07] aren't you tired of just of just barely
[56:09] existing
[56:11] can we challenge you tonight
[56:13] to do something a hundred percent
[56:17] you're so committed to this thing that
[56:19] nothing distracts you from this thing
[56:22] or be my voice
[56:24] walk in all the ways that i've commanded
[56:26] you
[56:28] even tonight hebrews 13 17.
[56:32] and this is a spiritual application of
[56:34] this
[56:35] and tonight we have we have a number of
[56:37] guests here if you're in the ministry
[56:39] this is for you for those who are in
[56:42] this ministry
[56:43] hebrews 13 17 obey them that have the
[56:47] rule over you
[56:48] and submit yourselves for their watch
[56:50] for your souls
[56:53] as they must give account didn't we
[56:55] speak on this last sunday but giving an
[56:57] account
[56:59] i could come tonight and tell you it's
[57:01] okay you're all right just stay happy
[57:04] but will that get you where you're
[57:06] supposed to be in god
[57:07] when do we see the requirement clearly
[57:09] says in all the is
[57:12] so hebrews 13 17 obey them that have
[57:15] rule over you and submit yourselves for
[57:17] their watch for your souls
[57:20] as they that must give account
[57:23] that they may do it with joy and not
[57:25] with grief for that is unprofitable
[57:28] for you
[57:31] i've seen so many people
[57:34] make bad decisions
[57:37] and as much as you tell people hey don't
[57:39] do that that way
[57:41] don't do it that way
[57:43] you know the bible says alter the
[57:45] multitude of counsel there's safety
[57:47] that's scripture
[57:49] life will always have decisions that's
[57:51] within your expertise and outside your
[57:54] expertise
[57:56] i am not an architect so you cannot come
[57:58] to me and ask me how to build your house
[58:00] i am not an architect
[58:02] if you want to build a house you need to
[58:03] go to an architect
[58:05] anybody with me you want to start a farm
[58:07] you need to go to somebody who
[58:08] understand farming
[58:10] that is not me
[58:12] and in all things
[58:14] you have to understand what is important
[58:17] and not limit yourself just to your
[58:19] knowledge
[58:20] but make the right connection so you can
[58:22] grow
[58:24] what is the spiritual side of this thing
[58:26] now
[58:28] as believers god has blessed us with
[58:31] different gifts
[58:33] so that we could grow together take in
[58:36] scripture to rightly divide it so we
[58:38] could grow
[58:40] and we could see perhaps what we never
[58:41] saw before or never saw the value of it
[58:44] before so we could get good advice
[58:47] and the advice and the encouragement
[58:49] tonight is you need to be more
[58:51] surrendered
[58:53] if you're backslidden tonight you need
[58:55] to come back home
[58:58] not i talk in church
[58:59] i talk about coming back to the kingdom
[59:02] coming back to our relationship with god
[59:05] and recently i was having a conversation
[59:07] with somebody and they say things not
[59:08] really going well in my life i say
[59:10] retrace these steps
[59:12] because
[59:13] your trouble i know started when you
[59:16] started to separate yourself from
[59:18] kingdom
[59:20] you break fellowship
[59:22] you got distracted
[59:24] you spent time doing things you
[59:25] shouldn't be doing conversations you
[59:27] shouldn't be having places you shouldn't
[59:29] be going
[59:33] how much
[59:34] people have made bad decisions because
[59:37] decisions have consequences you know
[59:38] good and bad
[59:40] people go to five years of secondary
[59:42] school and don't study and what you
[59:44] expect to get a good result
[59:47] and somebody else go five years and they
[59:49] study hard
[59:50] and have a result some time ago there
[59:52] was a international story of somebody in
[59:54] brazil or wherever it was a young boy
[59:57] had no electricity at home
[59:59] used to go out to the street light to
[1:00:01] study how many stories we have of people
[1:00:03] because of a great desire to achieve
[1:00:06] they push back past whatever limitation
[1:00:09] that they had because they wanted to
[1:00:10] achieve
[1:00:12] and that is for natural things because a
[1:00:14] natural degree a natural certification a
[1:00:17] natural job all that is important you
[1:00:19] know god don't have a problem with that
[1:00:21] at all
[1:00:22] the problem is when this becomes your
[1:00:24] god and you lose sight that there's an
[1:00:26] eternity
[1:00:28] and there's a land beyond this land
[1:00:30] and it is easy that's why we said last
[1:00:33] sunday lay aside every sin and wait
[1:00:38] for some of us it may not be
[1:00:41] out there doing synonymy
[1:00:42] things but we have all kind of weights
[1:00:45] and the weight prevents us from being
[1:00:47] totally sold out to the commandments of
[1:00:49] god
[1:00:51] so we can't pray as we should because
[1:00:53] prayers is a commandment
[1:00:55] anybody with me tonight
[1:00:57] prayer is a command pray without ceasing
[1:00:59] that's a command
[1:01:01] for this is the will of god the will
[1:01:03] anybody with me
[1:01:05] so very quickly as we
[1:01:08] try to
[1:01:09] drive along the last street of this
[1:01:11] journey
[1:01:13] obedience
[1:01:15] it is a paradox
[1:01:18] how much god values obedience and how
[1:01:20] much he has taught us very simple
[1:01:23] if you know it
[1:01:24] ten lepers came to jesus
[1:01:29] jesus had multiple ways he healed people
[1:01:33] in all kinds of different ways
[1:01:35] these lepers he just tell them go
[1:01:38] and show yourself to the priest
[1:01:41] now for the students of scripture in the
[1:01:43] old testament if you had leprosy or had
[1:01:46] any kind of skin disease you could not
[1:01:48] be admitted to be with the people until
[1:01:50] the priests say you're cleared
[1:01:53] to come back into the population as it
[1:01:55] will
[1:01:57] so jesus said go and show yourself to
[1:01:59] the priests so
[1:02:00] first of all these men had to decide but
[1:02:02] wait a minute
[1:02:04] if i go to the priest in my condition
[1:02:06] there's no way you're going to give me
[1:02:07] any clearance i know my i know my
[1:02:08] condition
[1:02:10] so at that point in time it took
[1:02:12] great faith to begin to walk
[1:02:15] but these men
[1:02:17] actually had one choice they obeyed
[1:02:20] and in obeying the bible says on the way
[1:02:24] they were all healed
[1:02:27] what did they do they just obeyed
[1:02:32] why didn't god just put his hand upon
[1:02:35] them why didn't he say be healed he just
[1:02:37] said go show yourself to the priest some
[1:02:39] of us trinidadians if we were there we
[1:02:42] ain't make it out we wouldn't we would
[1:02:43] not be healing them
[1:02:47] because we were to tell jesus how he
[1:02:48] should do it
[1:02:54] anybody with me
[1:02:57] jericho the battle of jericho another
[1:02:59] paradox on the first day walk around
[1:03:02] once
[1:03:03] on the second day walk around once third
[1:03:05] day walking around runs
[1:03:07] all the way we do it
[1:03:09] if it was a trinidadian there again
[1:03:11] jericho was standing up straight
[1:03:14] i cannot understand how walking around
[1:03:16] jericho
[1:03:17] is going to lead to the war coming down
[1:03:20] but all joshua and they had to do was do
[1:03:22] one thing obey
[1:03:25] do we trust god enough to just obey
[1:03:28] without questioning
[1:03:30] how we're gonna happen
[1:03:32] anybody with me
[1:03:35] god wants to heal you bless you deliver
[1:03:37] you restore you give you the desires of
[1:03:39] your heart open up the winners of heaven
[1:03:41] for you and all he's asking for is to
[1:03:43] obey
[1:03:45] and he's telling us tonight that if you
[1:03:47] don't obey it have negative consequences
[1:03:49] very simple and if you obey it's
[1:03:50] positive consequences this is not a deep
[1:03:53] gospel you know it's a very simple thing
[1:03:55] but it affects our daily lives
[1:04:00] because it don't challenges us to really
[1:04:01] look at even our prayer lives
[1:04:04] let's bring it home
[1:04:06] because if you see prayer as a command
[1:04:09] how does god view when we don't pray on
[1:04:11] a daily basis
[1:04:15] can we look at it like that
[1:04:19] when we could go a day and i said it
[1:04:21] some time ago you don't go out there
[1:04:23] without plugging in your cell phone yo
[1:04:24] somehow you don't forget that you don't
[1:04:25] forget that at all you know you have to
[1:04:27] connect your cell phone
[1:04:29] you know right forget myself for three
[1:04:31] days now i forget to plug in my cell
[1:04:33] phone the whole month i forget to
[1:04:34] program my cell phone my cell phone air
[1:04:36] on for three months
[1:04:39] audio
[1:04:40] cell phone on a friday at a certain time
[1:04:43] because that's how some of us live with
[1:04:45] our lives with with god
[1:04:47] you're only plugging on the phone the
[1:04:48] phone only on for a few hours at select
[1:04:50] times in a week because that
[1:04:52] is anybody with me
[1:04:58] noah
[1:05:00] look at this scripture and and
[1:05:02] this is what i want my testimony to be
[1:05:04] and this is what i want your testimony
[1:05:05] to be
[1:05:06] genesic
[1:05:07] genesis 6 22
[1:05:09] thus did noah
[1:05:11] according to all that god commanded him
[1:05:15] so did he
[1:05:17] i'll read it one more time thus did noah
[1:05:21] according to all that god commanded him
[1:05:24] so did he
[1:05:26] i want to challenge you to begin to
[1:05:28] think about a life
[1:05:30] that when the record when they record an
[1:05:33] angel speaks about you
[1:05:35] you can say thus dead brother so-and-so
[1:05:37] or sister so-and-so according to all
[1:05:40] that god commanded so did he so did her
[1:05:44] because
[1:05:45] you consider it important
[1:05:48] but let's re-look again briefly at
[1:05:50] noah's day
[1:05:51] what was the requirement in noah's day
[1:05:54] it was really simple you know
[1:05:56] go in the act option one stay audi act
[1:05:59] option two going into the act was
[1:06:01] obedience staying out of the aqua
[1:06:03] disobedience very simple
[1:06:07] and we can look back in hindsight as it
[1:06:10] is or as it were
[1:06:11] and say but wait a minute
[1:06:13] why didn't more people go into the ark
[1:06:18] and we can look back and we know all of
[1:06:21] us in this room tonight know that the
[1:06:23] right decision was to go into the earth
[1:06:25] and the wrong one to us to stay out of
[1:06:26] the act
[1:06:27] that is obvious
[1:06:29] but do we know tonight
[1:06:31] that is still a situation like that
[1:06:32] going on right now
[1:06:34] that you have to be in christ or out of
[1:06:36] christ in safety or outside of safety
[1:06:40] in the holy ghost or outside you holy
[1:06:42] ghost in the body or outside of the body
[1:06:46] and the same decision that faced them in
[1:06:48] that day faces us in this day
[1:06:51] a decision of obedience
[1:06:54] bring it into context full obedience
[1:06:58] to the entire world entitles usually
[1:07:01] token
[1:07:02] full obedience in the word of god
[1:07:04] entitles you to all that god has for you
[1:07:06] your inheritance your promise your
[1:07:08] perfection your adoption your growth
[1:07:10] your spiritual maturity
[1:07:12] in the days of moses
[1:07:14] the last plague the death angel
[1:07:18] it was a simple thing
[1:07:20] if you put the blood on your doorpost as
[1:07:22] the scripture said
[1:07:24] that angel would spare that firstborn
[1:07:26] if you didn't do it
[1:07:28] death was going to strike you home
[1:07:31] it was a simple matter of obedience and
[1:07:33] disobedience it was not even an issue of
[1:07:36] understanding
[1:07:38] i want to i want it to resonate
[1:07:41] but i don't understand
[1:07:44] why moses say do it like that
[1:07:47] why i can't do something else why i
[1:07:49] can't do it this other way
[1:07:51] because moses was very clear with what
[1:07:53] they were supposed to do
[1:07:54] and if you obey there's a consequence
[1:07:57] there's a result there's a blessing and
[1:07:59] if you disobey there's a consequence
[1:08:01] anybody with me tonight
[1:08:04] we have studied jonah and jonah
[1:08:06] disobeyed god and
[1:08:08] we know the story
[1:08:11] listen to pharaoh
[1:08:13] when moses came
[1:08:15] to his choice of words
[1:08:16] in exodus 5 and verse 2
[1:08:19] and pharaoh said who is the lord
[1:08:22] that i should obey his voice
[1:08:25] to let israel go
[1:08:27] i know not the lord
[1:08:29] neither will i let israel go
[1:08:33] and that's so many people today
[1:08:36] who is this lord
[1:08:39] who is this jesus
[1:08:41] what is this gospel that i should obey
[1:08:44] this voice
[1:08:45] i know not the lord
[1:08:48] neither will i let israel go
[1:08:50] i want to challenge you tonight do you
[1:08:51] know the lord yeah you're in the message
[1:08:53] i know you need a message but do you
[1:08:55] know the lord
[1:08:57] anybody with me tonight
[1:08:59] do you have an experience with the lord
[1:09:02] is this a reality to you or is this just
[1:09:05] an expression
[1:09:08] my last substantive reading
[1:09:11] to close off tonight
[1:09:14] is a familiar story and i want to just
[1:09:16] strike it here
[1:09:17] some verses out of first samuel
[1:09:20] 15 if you have it
[1:09:24] first samuel 15
[1:09:26] our last reading tonight
[1:09:29] it's first timer 15 and verse 1.
[1:09:32] samuel the anointed prophet of god also
[1:09:34] said unto saul the lord
[1:09:36] sent me to anoint thee to be king over
[1:09:39] his people over israel
[1:09:41] now therefore hearken thou unto the
[1:09:43] voice of the words of the
[1:09:46] lord thus saith the lord of hosts i
[1:09:49] remember
[1:09:51] that which amalek did to israel
[1:09:53] how he laid wait for him in the way when
[1:09:55] he came up from egypt
[1:09:57] and for those of you who remember
[1:10:00] moses led the throne of israel out of
[1:10:02] egypt they were not an army
[1:10:05] they were not trained
[1:10:07] they had no weapons
[1:10:09] they were
[1:10:10] coming out of broken people
[1:10:13] out of years of
[1:10:14] bondage and samuel is referring to the
[1:10:18] fact that when they left egypt
[1:10:20] the amalekites attacked them in their
[1:10:23] weakest moment
[1:10:24] when they were vulnerable
[1:10:26] and god hated that because god was
[1:10:29] bringing out his people and the
[1:10:31] amalekites pounced on vulnerability
[1:10:33] pounds on weakness
[1:10:36] we all go through moments when we are
[1:10:38] weak when we are vulnerable
[1:10:42] we know how we feel when we are
[1:10:43] vulnerable and god knows how you feel
[1:10:45] when
[1:10:47] when you're vulnerable god knows god
[1:10:49] knows
[1:10:50] your people tonight feeling weak you're
[1:10:51] tired they're wary
[1:10:53] they're they're just tired and not on
[1:10:54] water hang on their doors on a mountain
[1:10:56] stop and victorious
[1:10:58] we are mixed audience tonight
[1:11:01] but god remembers
[1:11:04] and this is years later but god is
[1:11:06] telling saul through his prophet samuel
[1:11:09] i remember
[1:11:11] that which i'm elected to israel
[1:11:14] i'll never gonna let it slide how he
[1:11:17] laid wait for him in the way
[1:11:20] when he came up from egypt now go and
[1:11:22] smite amalek
[1:11:25] god is sovereign he can do what he wants
[1:11:28] he said go and smite amalek and utterly
[1:11:31] destroy all that they have and spare
[1:11:33] them not
[1:11:34] but slave both man and woman infant and
[1:11:36] suckling oxen sheep camel and ass
[1:11:39] saw garden people together and numbered
[1:11:41] them in tellium 200 000 foot men and 10
[1:11:45] 000 men of judah and saul came to a city
[1:11:49] of amalek and laid weight in the valley
[1:11:52] and saul said unto the canaanites go the
[1:11:55] part get you down from among the
[1:11:57] amalekites lest i destroy you with them
[1:11:59] for you showed kindness to all the
[1:12:02] children of israel
[1:12:04] when they came up out of egypt so the
[1:12:06] canaanites departed from among the
[1:12:08] amalekites you see god is a just god in
[1:12:10] them
[1:12:11] he said the amalekites in the moment of
[1:12:13] weakness they attacked when my people
[1:12:15] were vulnerable
[1:12:16] they cannites they showed kindness so
[1:12:19] let them go
[1:12:21] and saw smoothie amalekites from havilah
[1:12:24] until they commenced assure that it's
[1:12:27] over against egypt
[1:12:29] and he took agag the king of the
[1:12:31] amalekites alive
[1:12:33] and utterly destroyed all the people
[1:12:35] with the edge of the sword
[1:12:37] but saul and the people speared again no
[1:12:40] again the instruction was to wipe
[1:12:43] everybody out
[1:12:45] saul was anointed
[1:12:47] and an anointed king is being
[1:12:50] disobedient
[1:12:52] look how god begins to deal with this as
[1:12:54] it unfolds but saul and the people
[1:12:56] spared aegon we in verse nine and the
[1:12:58] best of the sheep
[1:13:00] and of the oxen and of the fatlings he
[1:13:03] didn't spare the bad sheep he didn't
[1:13:05] spare
[1:13:07] foolishness he spared the best and the
[1:13:10] lambs and all that was good
[1:13:13] i want us to pause here for a minute
[1:13:16] so because for it to be described as all
[1:13:19] that was good
[1:13:20] there's a lot that we do that could be
[1:13:22] described as good in them
[1:13:25] in principle there was nothing wrong
[1:13:27] with the best of the sheep and of the
[1:13:29] oxen and of the factlings and the lambs
[1:13:31] and all that was good
[1:13:34] but in the context of god's command that
[1:13:38] just required obedience this became an
[1:13:40] issue
[1:13:43] so you could spend hours and hours
[1:13:45] studying and that's good i'm not saying
[1:13:47] no study
[1:13:48] but where is god in your study because
[1:13:50] when you have to give an answer on that
[1:13:52] day i said it in church you can't
[1:13:53] present yourself to god
[1:13:58] what you need to present to god is your
[1:14:00] obedience to his word his precepts his
[1:14:02] command
[1:14:05] all that was good and would not utterly
[1:14:07] destroy them
[1:14:09] but everything that was vile and refused
[1:14:12] that they destroyed utterly so saul and
[1:14:14] them destroyed everything that was in
[1:14:16] their minds worthless
[1:14:18] and they kept everything that they
[1:14:20] thought had value and that's how we are
[1:14:22] in life you know we don't keep things
[1:14:24] that really have no value and reject the
[1:14:25] thing that we think good it's in our
[1:14:27] nature to keep what is valuable and
[1:14:30] reject what has no value
[1:14:32] verse 10 then came the word of the lord
[1:14:35] unto samuel saying
[1:14:37] listen to god's word it repented me so
[1:14:40] god is repenting him
[1:14:45] a lot of people miss this the language
[1:14:47] of scripture god is repenting you see it
[1:14:49] repented me in other words
[1:14:51] i have regrets
[1:14:54] i wish i could hit the undo button on
[1:14:56] this thing
[1:14:58] it repented me that i have set up saul
[1:15:00] to be king
[1:15:02] for he is turned back from following me
[1:15:06] now saul in this situation it was in
[1:15:09] fornication it was adultery it wasn't
[1:15:12] smoking drinking it wasn't this wasn't
[1:15:14] the issue you know it was just
[1:15:16] disobedience
[1:15:19] he wasn't living a obvious ons sinful
[1:15:22] life and do it crazy you know i say but
[1:15:24] oh god he leave your church he backs
[1:15:25] light no he just disobeyed look how
[1:15:28] god's response is it repented me that i
[1:15:31] have set up saul to be king so he's
[1:15:33] turned back from following me and had
[1:15:35] not performed my commandments
[1:15:39] and it grieved samuel and he cried unto
[1:15:42] the lord all night
[1:15:44] you see what spiritual grief that scores
[1:15:48] set a mark upon those that sigh and cry
[1:15:52] it bothers you sin bothers you
[1:15:56] a break from a relationship with god
[1:15:57] bothers you samuel
[1:15:59] knew what this meant and he cried all
[1:16:01] night
[1:16:02] 12 and when samuel rose early he cried
[1:16:06] all night and gets up early to meet saul
[1:16:09] in the morning
[1:16:11] it was told samuel saying saul came to
[1:16:13] camel and behold he set up a place and
[1:16:17] has gone about and passed on and go on
[1:16:19] down to gilgal
[1:16:21] so samuel didn't sleep
[1:16:23] get up early and they telling samuel
[1:16:25] listen saul born and he'd go on to
[1:16:28] carmel and go on to gilgal and samuel
[1:16:30] came to saul and saul said unto him
[1:16:33] blessed be thou of the lord
[1:16:38] i have performed the commandment of the
[1:16:40] lord so saul is saying to samuel blessed
[1:16:42] be thou of the lord mighty man of god i
[1:16:45] perform the commandment
[1:16:48] and samuel said what mean it then this
[1:16:50] bleating of the sheep in mine is and
[1:16:53] there was a year in animals and lowing
[1:16:55] of the oxen that i hear which i hear and
[1:16:58] saul said they have brought them from
[1:17:00] the amalekites
[1:17:02] for the people speared and i want us to
[1:17:05] get this because this is the rare lesson
[1:17:07] here in this thing the people spare the
[1:17:09] best of the sheep and of the oxen listen
[1:17:13] listen to the purpose listen to the
[1:17:14] objective to sacrifice unto the lord thy
[1:17:18] god
[1:17:21] friends it was not a motive
[1:17:26] that is
[1:17:27] to cause harm to cause danger in their
[1:17:29] mind you know
[1:17:30] in their heart they thought they doing
[1:17:32] the right thing
[1:17:35] they did it with an intention to
[1:17:37] sacrifice unto the lord thy god and the
[1:17:40] rest we utterly destroyed
[1:17:43] you know how many people do things and
[1:17:46] saints with the lord
[1:17:50] anybody with me
[1:17:52] in their mind in their heart they're
[1:17:53] making a sacrifice unto the lord
[1:17:56] and in doing so they are disobeying
[1:17:58] god's command because god given your
[1:18:00] commands on how to live and how to act
[1:18:02] but you trying to serve god because this
[1:18:04] teaching here is
[1:18:06] saul was trying to serve god the way he
[1:18:08] wanted to
[1:18:12] god didn't ask for this at this time in
[1:18:14] this way it was a clear instruction
[1:18:16] destroy all that he had
[1:18:18] and he decided to have a service
[1:18:21] and this would be a god
[1:18:22] having a ceremony
[1:18:24] a spiritual ceremony and in heaven that
[1:18:26] is also disobedient god
[1:18:28] verse 15 the ending and the rest we
[1:18:30] utterly destroyed then samuel will still
[1:18:32] understand
[1:18:34] and i will tell you what the lord had
[1:18:37] said to me this night
[1:18:39] and so i'll say well say on
[1:18:41] and samuel said when thou was little in
[1:18:44] thy own sight
[1:18:46] was thou not made the head of the tribes
[1:18:48] of israel and the lord anointed the king
[1:18:51] over israel
[1:18:53] and the lord send thee on a journey in
[1:18:55] other words god has this way of always
[1:18:57] reminding you where you come from you
[1:18:58] saw it there when we read it in
[1:18:59] deuteronomy we saw it here again god is
[1:19:02] into him when there was little in thine
[1:19:04] own sight
[1:19:05] was down at may the head of the tribes
[1:19:07] of israel and the lord anointed the king
[1:19:09] of israel in other words i don't want to
[1:19:11] forget where you come from because i'm
[1:19:13] watching your behavior now and it is as
[1:19:16] if you forget where you come from
[1:19:18] and verse 80 says and the lord sent me
[1:19:20] on a journey in other words the fact
[1:19:22] that even here right now is not by your
[1:19:24] own choosing
[1:19:25] it was a command it was an instruction
[1:19:28] that god gave to you
[1:19:30] and said go and utterly destroy these
[1:19:32] sinners the amalekites and fight against
[1:19:34] them until they be consumed
[1:19:37] verse 19 wherefore then did is thou not
[1:19:41] obey the voice of the lord
[1:19:45] but there is fly upon the spoil and
[1:19:47] ditch evil in the sight of the lord so
[1:19:50] in other words somebody could sing a
[1:19:52] song to the lord and if it is out of
[1:19:54] order is actually evil enough
[1:19:57] or you don't hear me tonight
[1:19:59] it was a sacrifice in them
[1:20:02] that under a different circumstance or
[1:20:04] situation is perfect
[1:20:06] but against the command of the lord it
[1:20:09] became a sin
[1:20:11] that's how much god values obedience
[1:20:14] anybody with me
[1:20:17] verse 20
[1:20:19] and saul said unto samuel yeah
[1:20:22] i have obeyed the voice of the lord and
[1:20:24] i've gone the way which the lord sent me
[1:20:26] and i've brought a god the king of
[1:20:28] amalek and i've utterly destroyed the
[1:20:30] amalekites but the people took up the
[1:20:32] spoil sheep and oxen and the chief of
[1:20:35] the things which should have been ought
[1:20:37] to be destroyed listen again
[1:20:39] saul still defending himself he's
[1:20:41] missing the point
[1:20:43] of the lesson
[1:20:45] to sacrifice unto the lord thy god and
[1:20:47] gilgal so as far as saul is concerned he
[1:20:50] can't really understand at this point
[1:20:52] what's wrong you know i want to success
[1:20:55] he not appreciate as far as he concerned
[1:20:58] this thing really shouldn't be an issue
[1:21:00] we bring it to sacrifice unto the lord
[1:21:04] and samuel now have to reinforce it he
[1:21:06] say heart the lord as great delight
[1:21:09] you know in burnt offerings and
[1:21:11] sacrifice
[1:21:12] as in obeying the voice of the lord so
[1:21:14] it's a question
[1:21:16] and listen to the question said
[1:21:17] differently is the lord more interested
[1:21:20] in your burnt offering and his sacrifice
[1:21:23] and your effort and what you think you
[1:21:25] do it for the lord or is he more
[1:21:27] interested in you obeying his voice
[1:21:33] because
[1:21:34] under different circumstances you burn
[1:21:36] offering and sacrifices fine enough but
[1:21:39] when you compare burn offering against
[1:21:42] obeying a voice sacrifice against
[1:21:44] obeying his voice preaching against
[1:21:46] obeying his voice singing a song against
[1:21:49] obeying his voice whatever you think you
[1:21:50] should be doing against obeying his
[1:21:52] voice everything else is secondary to
[1:21:54] obeying his voice
[1:21:58] everybody with me
[1:22:01] your idea is secondary to obeying his
[1:22:03] voice
[1:22:04] your emotions secondary to obeying his
[1:22:06] voice how you think it should be
[1:22:08] secondary to obeying his voice
[1:22:13] behold to obey is better than sacrifice
[1:22:17] and to hearken than the fat of rams
[1:22:21] so sam you are settling the matter say
[1:22:24] obedience is better than sacrifice
[1:22:28] verse 23
[1:22:29] for rebellion because this is what
[1:22:32] disobedience really is
[1:22:34] so he's saying without you being
[1:22:36] conscious of it for rebellion
[1:22:39] which is disobedience
[1:22:41] is as the sin of witchcraft
[1:22:45] and stubbornness
[1:22:47] is as iniquity and idolatry so you say
[1:22:51] to me preacher
[1:22:53] for i don't worship idols i'm not into
[1:22:55] iniquity and not into witchcraft but
[1:22:57] whenever you disobey god it is
[1:22:59] considered rebellion which is as a sin
[1:23:01] of witchcraft and stubbornness which
[1:23:03] means you're just resisting what god
[1:23:05] wants in your life is as iniquity and
[1:23:08] idolatry because
[1:23:10] thou has rejected the word of the lord
[1:23:15] he had also rejected v from being
[1:23:18] king
[1:23:21] i'm getting ready to close out
[1:23:23] and saul senator samuel i have sinned
[1:23:26] for i have transgressed the commandment
[1:23:29] of the lord and thy words listen listen
[1:23:32] because i feared the people and obeyed
[1:23:34] their voice
[1:23:37] so the question tonight is who are you
[1:23:40] obeying
[1:23:42] because after all of this saul now
[1:23:44] admits i wasn't obeying god's voice i
[1:23:47] was obeying the voice of the people
[1:23:51] i was obeying another voice
[1:23:53] who are you obeying tonight
[1:23:56] when you make decisions
[1:23:58] choices do things
[1:24:00] verse 25 getting ready to close now
[1:24:03] therefore i pray thee pardon my sin
[1:24:06] and turn again with me that i may
[1:24:08] worship the lord and samuel said unto
[1:24:10] saul i will not return with thee for
[1:24:12] thou hast rejected the word of the lord
[1:24:15] and the lord had rejected thee from
[1:24:17] being king
[1:24:18] over israel
[1:24:21] friends
[1:24:22] in closing
[1:24:24] the greatest enemy
[1:24:26] to obedience
[1:24:28] is our will
[1:24:31] i said it before the battle that jesus
[1:24:33] had was not sin it was a battle of wills
[1:24:36] and we all have our will
[1:24:39] but like jesus we need to subject
[1:24:42] ourselves to god's will which is true
[1:24:45] perfect obedience not my will but dying
[1:24:48] be done
[1:24:50] i want to encourage you with these
[1:24:52] commands that we should live by
[1:24:54] from first thessalonians 5. it's a
[1:24:58] command
[1:25:00] rejoice evermore
[1:25:02] pray without ceasing
[1:25:04] in everything give thanks for this is
[1:25:06] the will of god in christ jesus
[1:25:08] concerning you
[1:25:09] quench not the spirit despise not
[1:25:12] prophesying
[1:25:14] prove all things hold fast that which is
[1:25:17] good
[1:25:18] abstain from all appearance of evil
[1:25:22] when jesus was a nut
[1:25:24] he was challenged and questioned many
[1:25:26] times
[1:25:27] and one time in matthew 22 verse 34 the
[1:25:30] bible says but when the pharisees had
[1:25:32] heard that he had put the sadducees to
[1:25:35] silence they were gathered together
[1:25:38] then one of them which was a lawyer
[1:25:41] asked him a question tempting him and
[1:25:43] saying master
[1:25:46] which is the greatest commandment in the
[1:25:48] law
[1:25:51] jesus said unto him thou shall love the
[1:25:53] lord thy god with all thy heart
[1:25:57] and with all thy soul
[1:26:00] and with all thy mind
[1:26:02] we don't have time to go into it tonight
[1:26:04] but the fact that it is
[1:26:06] being clearly defined as you can love
[1:26:09] the lord with your heart you can love
[1:26:11] the lord with your soul and you can love
[1:26:12] him with your mind
[1:26:14] not just heart soul and mind but all
[1:26:17] your heart
[1:26:18] all of your soul and all of thy mind and
[1:26:22] verse 38 says this is the first and
[1:26:24] great commandment
[1:26:26] and the second is like unto it thou
[1:26:28] shalt love thy neighbor as thyself
[1:26:32] on these two commandments
[1:26:34] hang all the law and the prophets
[1:26:38] in closing
[1:26:40] we cannot change the past it's over
[1:26:42] there's nothing we can do about it
[1:26:44] i want to ask a question how different
[1:26:47] would our lives be if we obeyed
[1:26:50] the word
[1:26:52] of the lord
[1:26:54] if you didn't tell that lie
[1:26:57] if you had prayed
[1:27:00] because
[1:27:01] not lying
[1:27:02] is a command
[1:27:04] and praying
[1:27:05] is a command
[1:27:07] a line is being drawn tonight
[1:27:10] a line of separation between your past
[1:27:13] and your future
[1:27:15] a line is being drawn tonight a line of
[1:27:17] separation between disobedience and
[1:27:19] obedience
[1:27:21] when we were young
[1:27:23] the consequence of disobedience was
[1:27:26] licks
[1:27:27] no sweetie
[1:27:29] no ice cream
[1:27:31] this is different
[1:27:33] the consequence of disobedient
[1:27:35] disobedience is death
[1:27:36] hell
[1:27:38] wailing and gnashing of teeth
[1:27:41] and the blessing of obedience
[1:27:43] is a land of milk and honey a glory of
[1:27:47] eternity and a blessing
[1:27:50] first peter 4 17
[1:27:53] fully seasoned among us
[1:27:56] for the time has come
[1:27:58] that judgment
[1:28:01] must begin at the house of god
[1:28:04] and if it first begin at us
[1:28:06] what shall the end be of them that obey
[1:28:09] not
[1:28:10] the gospel of god
[1:28:12] and i'll end with this one quote
[1:28:14] from the token
[1:28:16] full obedience to the whole word of god
[1:28:19] will entitle you to the token full
[1:28:22] obedience
[1:28:23] not a part of it
[1:28:25] as far as your denomination goes but all
[1:28:28] of it
[1:28:29] full obedience of the word which is
[1:28:31] christ brings you into christ
[1:28:34] now what if he was just all in but your
[1:28:37] feet hanging out
[1:28:38] what if he was all in with hands hanging
[1:28:40] out most all of us in but the heart is
[1:28:44] hanging out see
[1:28:46] the heart in the world
[1:28:47] but we don't do that
[1:28:49] full complete obedience puts you and the
[1:28:53] word as one you believe it every bit
[1:28:56] and all of it's in you and you watch it
[1:28:59] working through you
[1:29:02] you don't go above with a bunch of
[1:29:04] carrying on see you're a christian no
[1:29:07] matter what anybody says they'll never
[1:29:09] touch you you're in christ you're safe
[1:29:11] as you can be
[1:29:13] when death knocks at the door it has no
[1:29:15] hold see not at all why it's just
[1:29:18] stepping out of here into there
[1:29:20] age means nothing you don't pass from
[1:29:23] asia in eternity because you're in him
[1:29:25] he is eternal
[1:29:27] can we bow our heads for a word of
[1:29:28] prayer
[1:29:30] all gracious heavenly father this
[1:29:33] simple teaching tonight
[1:29:35] so remind your people
[1:29:38] of the importance of obedience the
[1:29:41] blessing that comes from obeying your
[1:29:43] word
[1:29:44] and the consequence or the curse of
[1:29:47] disobedience
[1:29:48] lord we take some of these things so
[1:29:50] lightly so casually
[1:29:53] and lord i think back to saul
[1:29:56] who
[1:29:57] thought he was doing something positive
[1:30:01] in his heart he thought he was doing it
[1:30:02] unto the lord
[1:30:04] and he missed the bigger picture that
[1:30:06] you are more interested in us obeying
[1:30:09] you than even doing things for you
[1:30:12] it's a deep understanding
[1:30:15] lord because many times we we try to
[1:30:18] compensate for what we should be doing
[1:30:22] in other ways when deep down in our
[1:30:24] hearts
[1:30:25] lord there are areas there that are in
[1:30:27] trouble
[1:30:29] lord i don't know who is in trouble
[1:30:30] tonight
[1:30:31] lord you know and i pray that you're
[1:30:32] with minister to each one
[1:30:35] lord and for those
[1:30:37] of us who have not been obedient to your
[1:30:39] word to your promise to your requirement
[1:30:41] of this hour
[1:30:43] lord may you stir our hearts within us
[1:30:46] to want to be more like you and to give
[1:30:48] up everything else that is not of you
[1:30:52] to be totally surrendered
[1:30:54] to have a passion for your commandments
[1:30:57] lord we read the scripture of parents
[1:31:00] spending time with their children lord
[1:31:02] of of of putting this word on our the
[1:31:06] doors of our homes and our gates and our
[1:31:08] hearts and our environments and our
[1:31:10] cubicles and our offices and our cars

[1:31:16] but lord to please you

[1:31:30] higher level of commitment a higher zeal
[1:31:32] and a passion to serve you as they have
[1:31:34] never done before if there's somebody
[1:31:37] here tonight who doesn't know you may
[1:31:38] they come to know you by revelation and
[1:31:41] by experience the night to know that
[1:31:43] there's life beyond this existence
[1:31:45] and to know that if we obey your word
[1:31:48] with everything that's within us
[1:31:50] we have a place in your economy a place
[1:31:53] in your kingdom so father may you be
[1:31:55] with each one may you break every chain
