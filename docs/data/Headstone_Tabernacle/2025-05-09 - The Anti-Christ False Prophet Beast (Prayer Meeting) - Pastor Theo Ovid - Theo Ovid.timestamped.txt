[11:24] of you for being here tonight uh online
[11:27] with us uh as we
[11:29] uh yield ourselves to the will of God.
[11:32] Let's bow our heads for a word of
[11:34] prayer. Heavenly Father, we thank you
[11:36] for your presence and we thank you for
[11:38] this opportunity that we could call upon
[11:40] your name that we could listen to your
[11:42] word. We could hear from you for you and
[11:44] your word that is seen. You are faithful
[11:47] to your word. Your word is truth. Your
[11:49] word is righteousness. And may that
[11:51] righteousness prevail tonight. Deliver
[11:54] from sin, from unbelief, from
[11:55] backslidings, from sickness, from ill
[11:58] health. Whatever condition that people
[12:00] are in tonight, may they be delivered.
[12:02] May they be set free by your word in
[12:04] Jesus I ask it. Amen. And amen. God
[12:07] bless you and welcome tonight. And it's
[12:11] a bless blessing and a privilege to be
[12:12] back home and um I was on another
[12:15] mission and um you hear about it but God
[12:18] has been good and God is is moving and
[12:23] um you know I know by now all of you
[12:26] would have heard by now that I've
[12:29] elected a pope out of America as brother
[12:32] Brandon
[12:33] prophesied and I was
[12:37] thinking 1977 I came to the message
[12:40] 1975 and I was 17 years old. 17 years
[12:44] old. In 1977 there was a a December
[12:49] meeting I think it was
[12:52] and October convention and different
[12:55] ministers were preaching and showing and
[12:58] they were all talking about
[13:00] um the millennium. They all talking
[13:02] about going home and the rapture and
[13:04] whatnot. And I that time would be about
[13:07] 19 years old. And having read a ton of
[13:10] messages, all that I could have found at
[13:12] that time and seen all the prophecies, I
[13:15] sat there watching these uh ministers
[13:20] say their stuff about leaving and going
[13:22] and rapture. And I'm thinking to myself,
[13:25] what about all these
[13:27] prophecies? What about all these things
[13:29] in the word? And somehow I just couldn't
[13:32] swallow their talk, their millennium
[13:35] talk, whatever they was peding at that
[13:37] time. It just wasn't cutting it because
[13:41] I saw so much valid prophecies that was
[13:44] outstanding that had to be fulfilled.
[13:47] This here the port of America was one of
[13:50] them. And on that and and at that time
[13:54] the prophecies was astonishing like how
[13:56] could it be possible? There were many
[13:58] things the prophet said and you wonder
[14:00] how could it be. But as the years roll
[14:04] by, you begin to see more and more how
[14:08] it is unfolding. And I want to say
[14:11] tonight that this is a demonstration
[14:14] that God is not operating by our
[14:16] feelings, by our emotions, by any man's
[14:19] thought and ideas as how it's supposed
[14:21] to be and when it's supposed to be. But
[14:24] God have a clock. God have a timing he's
[14:26] working with. Tonight I want to share
[14:28] some things with you. I may take more
[14:30] time than usual, but I feel that I' I'd
[14:34] like to do this and trust that it will
[14:36] edify and help you in your Christian
[14:39] walk. We're living in treacherous times
[14:41] and we have to be guided by the word.
[14:44] That is our guide. That is the light.
[14:46] Not feelings, not dreams, not emotions,
[14:48] but by the word. So tonight, if you have
[14:50] your Bibles, I'd like you to turn to
[14:51] Revelation chapter 13. We want to read
[14:54] the whole chapter. Revelation 13 verse
[14:58] one and it reads, "And I stood upon the
[15:01] sun of the sea and saw a beast rise up
[15:03] out of the sea, having seven heads, 10
[15:05] horns upon his horns, 10 crowns upon his
[15:08] heads, the name of blasphemy. And the
[15:11] beast which I saw like a leopard, his
[15:13] feet was the feet of a bear, his mouth
[15:16] as the mouth of a lion, and the dragon
[15:18] gave him his power and his seat and
[15:22] great authority." Note who gave him this
[15:25] power, the dragon. Verse three, and I
[15:28] saw one of the heads as it were wounded
[15:29] to death, and his deadly wound was
[15:31] healed, and all the world wondered after
[15:33] the beast. And they worshiped the
[15:35] dragon, which give power unto the beast?
[15:38] And they worshiped the beast, saying,
[15:40] Who is like unto the beast? Who is able
[15:42] to make war with him? And it was given
[15:45] unto him a mouth speaking greetings and
[15:47] blasphemies. And power was given unto
[15:49] him to continue 40 and two months. And
[15:54] he opened his mouth in blasphemy against
[15:56] God to blasphe his name, his tabernacle,
[15:59] and them that dwell in heaven. It was
[16:02] given unto him to make war with the
[16:03] saints, and to overcome them. power was
[16:07] given him over all kindreds and tongues
[16:10] and nations. And all that dwell upon the
[16:14] earth shall worship him whose names are
[16:17] not written in the book of the life of
[16:19] the lamb slain from the foundation of
[16:22] the world. Note that it says what going
[16:25] to happen. They shall worship him and a
[16:28] little
[16:29] sliver except those whose names uh whose
[16:32] names are not written in the book of
[16:33] life will be sound from the world. So
[16:35] everybody else whose name I've written
[16:37] will worship that beast. Verse nine, if
[16:39] any man had an ear, let him hear. He
[16:42] that leadth into captivity shall go into
[16:44] captivity. He that killth with a sword
[16:46] must be killed with a sword. Here is the
[16:48] patience of the and the fate of the
[16:51] saints. And I beheld another beast
[16:54] coming up out of the earth. He had two
[16:56] horns like a lamb and he spake like as a
[16:59] dragon. And he exercised all the power
[17:02] of the first beast before him, and
[17:04] caused the earth, and them that dwelt
[17:06] therein to worship the first beast,
[17:09] whose deadly womb was healed. And he
[17:11] doeth great wonders, so that he maketh
[17:13] fire cometh from heaven on the earth,
[17:15] and the sight of men. And he deceiveth
[17:18] them to dwell on the earth by the means
[17:20] of those miracles which he had power to
[17:22] do in the sight of the beast, saying to
[17:24] them that dwell on the earth, that they
[17:26] should make an image to the beast which
[17:29] had the wound by the sword and did live.
[17:32] And he had power, here we go, to give
[17:35] life unto the image of the beast, and
[17:39] that the image of the beast should both
[17:42] speak and cause that as many as would
[17:45] not worship the image of the beast
[17:47] should be
[17:48] killed. And he caused all, both small
[17:52] and great, rich and poor, free and
[17:56] bound, to receive a mark in their right
[17:59] hand. That is what you do about it. And
[18:01] in your foreheads, the revelation. Verse
[18:04] 17. That no man might buy or sell save
[18:07] he that had the mark or the name of the
[18:10] beast or the number of his name. Here is
[18:12] wisdom. Let him that had understanding
[18:15] come the number of the beast. For it is
[18:17] the number of a man and his number is
[18:20] 600 three score six. You know it's 666.
[18:23] So I wrote this here. I want you to
[18:26] understand that God is not operating by
[18:29] men's ideas, thoughts, or feelings.
[18:32] Whatever you think or feel does not
[18:36] affect what God promised to do or the
[18:38] fulfillment of his word. Prophecies are
[18:41] in motion tonight. So get your feelings
[18:44] and emotions out of it and hear the word
[18:47] of the Lord. So I've got a title of what
[18:50] I want to share with you tonight. title
[18:52] is the antichrist false prophet beast.
[18:55] That's the title. The
[18:57] antichrist false prophet beast. And I'll
[19:01] read the quote of the prophecy, brother
[19:04] Brandham. And this strange that this
[19:07] prophecy is locked up in a message
[19:09] called the acts of the holy spirit
[19:11] preached in 19th of December 1954. And
[19:14] he said, "I believe one of these
[19:16] glorious days when this United
[19:18] Confederation of Churches goes together
[19:20] and the new pope is brought out of the
[19:23] United States and put over deer
[19:27] according to
[19:28] prophecy, then they will form an image
[19:32] like unto the beast." And I tell you,
[19:36] the true church of God will be drove
[19:38] together.
[19:39] And he's detailing what he calling the
[19:42] true church, the real true believers out
[19:47] of Methodist, Baptist, Presbyterian,
[19:50] Pentecostal, Nazarine, holiness. That
[19:54] was his reference point at this time. At
[19:56] this time we talking about
[19:58] interpretation and other message
[20:00] tabernacles and churches and whatever
[20:03] whatever thing they are in cuz they have
[20:05] come to this now where they are they own
[20:06] Baptist and Presbyterian their own
[20:08] spirit and stuff. He said they will go
[20:11] together and be
[20:12] cemented by the love of
[20:15] God that will make the body of the Lord
[20:19] Jesus Christ. So he is clearly not
[20:22] talking about church or tabernacles or
[20:25] whatever. He is clearly talking about by
[20:27] one spirit we are baptized into this
[20:29] body. This is an international body the
[20:31] body of the lord Jesus Christ all the
[20:33] believers. Then he said and the
[20:35] agnostics and shallow minded shall be
[20:38] cast to one side. They will go right on
[20:41] in the confessional churches. So
[20:44] friends, I think that this is a a marker
[20:47] point, a junction point, a specific
[20:50] point in prophecy. And we know we have a
[20:54] genuine 20th century Malachi 4 prophet
[20:57] that God spoke through this man, this
[21:00] brother, this prophet William Marian
[21:03] Brown. In the seed of the Antichrist, he
[21:05] said these words. The first thing you
[21:08] know, the time will come when God will
[21:11] give a message and you'll be sealed in
[21:14] or out the kingdom. So what you're
[21:17] seeing here now has nothing to do again
[21:20] with church, the
[21:21] tabernacles, who's the pastor and all
[21:24] and all the drama behind the church
[21:26] scene. This have to do with the kingdom.
[21:29] Then in the 10th version, he said this.
[21:32] He said, "Notice now there are two
[21:34] spirits working almost right down here.
[21:38] One is the denomination and the other
[21:40] one is the Holy Ghost." And denomination
[21:43] is where the people are anchored to the
[21:46] church. They're not anchored by
[21:48] revelation or inspiration. They anchor
[21:50] to their church or to their tabernacle.
[21:52] The loyal faithful. These are the words
[21:55] that come out. They have nothing to do
[21:56] with the leading of the Holy Spirit. So
[21:58] hear what he's saying. No, there are two
[22:00] spirits working down here. One is the
[22:03] nomination, the other one is the Holy
[22:05] Ghost. And Jesus said they will be so
[22:08] close that they will deceive the very
[22:11] elected if it was possible. These two
[22:14] spirits are marking their people for
[22:18] future judgment. I want you to get that.
[22:21] The spirits are marking their people for
[22:24] future judgment. In other words, tonight
[22:28] you could be marked by the word to be
[22:31] sealed or marked to be judged by the
[22:34] judgments of God. Now, the same God that
[22:38] spoke about taking the pope out of
[22:41] America spoke this in the mark of the
[22:44] beast. There's that red dragon, the
[22:47] devil. Where's his seat at? Not in
[22:50] Russia. in Rome. The devil give him his
[22:55] seat and his authority, not Russia. He
[22:59] says, "Remember, I say this as God's
[23:02] prophet. The Russian Empire will drop an
[23:06] atomic bomb of some sort on the Vatican
[23:11] city and destroy it in one hour. Thus
[23:15] sayeth the Lord." I want to read it
[23:17] again. the Russian
[23:20] Empire will drop an atomic bomb of some
[23:23] sort on the Vatican city and destroy it
[23:27] in one hour. Thus sayeth the Lord. Now
[23:30] remember before it come back to Russia
[23:32] it was the Soviet Union to get to
[23:34] Russia. what the prophecy is identifying
[23:38] the Soviet Union itself had to be broken
[23:40] up the way it was that it could become
[23:43] back to this Russia because Russia is
[23:45] where the prophecy is at and the Bible
[23:48] said that God took them cruelhearted men
[23:52] and put them in his hands and they were
[23:55] instrument in his hands to fulfill his
[23:58] will and to bring her back to exactly
[24:01] what she come to that's the word exactly
[24:05] So
[24:07] listen, talking about the pillar of
[24:09] fire, the pillar of fire is to lead us
[24:12] to the millennium where he will return
[24:14] to his people. And listen from the third
[24:16] exodus, the pillar of fire and he return
[24:20] to his people in that great millennium
[24:22] after this exodus. We are in a exodus
[24:26] and leaving and turning the tapes off in
[24:29] a moment. Oh my friends, my brothers,
[24:31] both present that will hear the tapes as
[24:35] your brother and citizen of the kingdom
[24:38] of God, come out in this Exodus, for all
[24:43] that is left behind will bear the mark
[24:46] of the beast. Come out of Babylon. Come
[24:50] out of this confusion. Come out of these
[24:53] systems. He said now the pillar of fire
[24:56] in the same form he was back there
[24:58] bringing the first exodus bringing the
[25:01] second exodus he is with the third
[25:03] exodus the first exodus what did he do
[25:06] he brought them from a natural land to a
[25:08] natural land from Egypt to Palestine the
[25:10] second exodus he brought them from a
[25:13] spir from from a from a spiritual
[25:15] condition into a spiritual baptism of
[25:17] the Holy Ghost and now he's bringing
[25:20] them from the spiritual baptism of the
[25:22] Holy Ghost right back into the etal
[25:24] eternal land of the millennium and the
[25:26] great hereafter. The same pillar of
[25:29] fire, by the same anointed system, the
[25:32] same God doing the same things by the
[25:34] same word. Come out. Come out of this
[25:36] chaos. Come to the living God. Come to
[25:40] the word. And the word was made flesh
[25:42] and dwell among us. Come out and serve
[25:46] the living
[25:47] God. Question. What is the mark of the
[25:50] beast? Abraham said you can't sit
[25:52] neutral. be someoneish of unity. The
[25:54] Bible said in the last day, every man
[25:57] that wasn't sealed with the Holy Ghost
[25:59] would have the mark of the beast. Note,
[26:02] it is specific. It is to the individual.
[26:06] It doesn't say this church is right and
[26:08] this church is wrong. That is
[26:10] foolishness. That is what ministers have
[26:12] pedled for years. More right and more
[26:15] revelation. When the tire hits the road,
[26:19] this is what it is about. He says this
[26:21] here, you can't sit neutral. The Bible
[26:25] said in this day, every man that wasn't
[26:29] sealed with the Holy Ghost would have
[26:31] the mark of the beast. What is the mark
[26:34] of the beast?
[26:35] Unbelief. And just uh recently, Brother
[26:39] Clarence and I were fellowshipping,
[26:40] talking, and he was talking about he's
[26:43] now beginning to see people really don't
[26:45] believe the message. They're in the
[26:46] message. And I was telling him that when
[26:50] the prophet talk about three kind of
[26:52] believers, the unbeliever one blew my
[26:54] mind because he wasn't talking about it
[26:56] like unbelievers outside. He was talking
[26:59] about unbelievers on the inside. And I
[27:01] begin to tell Clarence that I have seen
[27:05] where I recognize ministers, people
[27:07] don't believe what the prophet said.
[27:08] They claim to believe the message. They
[27:10] believe some past. They're doing like if
[27:12] it's Buffy style, you pick what you
[27:13] want, you eat back what you don't want
[27:14] and so on. But the reality is it come
[27:17] like if you talk to a Pentecostal and
[27:19] they say 4 they don't want that but
[27:21] that's in the Bible behind Elijah the
[27:23] prophet they don't want that part today
[27:26] you could show people things in the word
[27:28] and they don't want that part they want
[27:29] what they want you see so the mark of
[27:32] the beast is what
[27:34] unbelief shai the prophet says grieving
[27:38] of the holy spirit whereby you are
[27:40] sealed unto their redemption how many
[27:42] knows that God word sayeth seal field of
[27:45] God is the Holy Ghost. Now what is the
[27:49] mark of the beast is to reject the Holy
[27:51] Ghost. Mark of apostasy. So when people
[27:54] looking for mark in the head like a
[27:56] tattoo or mark on their hand, here it is
[27:58] divine revelation. The mark of the beast
[28:01] is to reject the Holy Ghost from 10
[28:04] virgins. Oh, I love him, don't you? What
[28:06] is the seal of God? Holy Ghost. What is
[28:09] the mark of the beast? Reject
[28:12] it. And they going to come a
[28:15] message that going to seal people in or
[28:18] seal them out. Mark of the beast.
[28:21] Brother says in says here shall be light
[28:23] in the evening time. That's right. While
[28:25] the evening lights are
[28:26] shining, why don't you come to
[28:29] it? Don't set dead. Believe on the Lord
[28:33] Jesus Christ and be sealed into the
[28:36] kingdom. What is the mark of the beast?
[28:39] to reject the Holy Ghost, the
[28:42] borderline. Now, this is where he went
[28:45] deeper. And then he said these words
[28:48] after he once come to the knowledge of
[28:51] the truth. For it is impossible for
[28:54] those which were once enlightened. See,
[28:58] coming up to the knowledge of the truth
[29:00] and seeing they see the truth, they see
[29:03] the knowledge of it. Have the knowledge
[29:06] of the truth and then turn away. There
[29:07] remainth no more sacrifice for sin. If
[29:10] this doesn't identify what in the
[29:11] message don't know what it is but this
[29:13] is where saints it's not a matter of you
[29:16] say you are believer and you believe you
[29:18] have to receive. Okay let's go. All
[29:21] right so let me hear a bit
[29:23] expression. No but is talking about the
[29:26] antichrist
[29:27] spirit and John said little children the
[29:30] spirit of the antichrist is already
[29:33] working in the children of the
[29:34] disobedience. Now remember where the
[29:37] church fell from. That is why I have a
[29:40] real
[29:42] strong attitude and spirit against this
[29:45] nicolatan thing against message pope,
[29:48] archbishops, men who want to control
[29:50] ministers, men who want to control
[29:51] churches, men who hates or despise the
[29:53] sub biblical church. I come against that
[29:56] very very strong because the early
[29:59] church, this original church where God
[30:02] sent a messenger to turn us back to the
[30:03] faith of the fathers. These guys were
[30:06] guided by the Holy Ghost. The acts of
[30:09] the apostles or the book of acts was
[30:11] really the acts of the holy ghost
[30:13] through these men. There were no leader.
[30:14] There was no archbishop. Peter led to go
[30:16] so by calling his house. Andrew going
[30:18] this way, the deacon going this way.
[30:21] They were led by the spirit of God and
[30:23] God was glorified in that early church.
[30:25] That church was the foundation. That
[30:27] church was the original. And there came
[30:29] a falling away where men are finding
[30:32] it's too noisy. It's too rowdy. It's too
[30:34] holy ghosty and afterwards now things
[30:37] started creeping rich people started
[30:38] coming in and then the worship and the
[30:40] atmosphere cool down and then afterwards
[30:42] now very slow spirit move and then they
[30:46] start to put the anointing on the man
[30:48] the man be in the pulpit the preacher
[30:50] man and they leave and take the glory
[30:52] from the people put it on a man and of
[30:54] course that man became a bishop then
[30:57] archbishop then right onto pope so then
[31:00] they end up with a holy man instead of
[31:02] the holy god amongst the people Now what
[31:03] God really wants, God want to be among
[31:06] his people. The five for ministry is not
[31:08] there to be glorified and be lift up on
[31:10] some pedestal. What the file for
[31:12] ministry is for is what the Bible said
[31:14] it's for for the perfection of the
[31:16] saints. In other words, God so love you
[31:18] his people that he sending ministries to
[31:21] help, to edify, to strengthen, to build
[31:23] you up and so on like that until you get
[31:26] the measure. When you come into the
[31:29] measure which is your measure of the
[31:30] perfect man, there's no need for that
[31:33] ministry anymore. In that sense, the
[31:35] ministry have a purpose. The ministry
[31:37] have a time on it. The ministry have an
[31:39] objective and a purpose behind it
[31:41] because God gives gifts to men and every
[31:43] gift have its attributes and what it's
[31:45] supposed to do in honing us in preparing
[31:48] us. So then he says this here now. So
[31:50] therefore all of this is what the church
[31:52] fell from from the glory among the
[31:54] people from the Holy Ghost and then now
[31:57] end up on a man right a pope and that is
[31:59] where the old fall from white horse red
[32:01] horse black horse all right so watch he
[32:05] says now watch then it become a scene in
[32:08] the next church age next church age was
[32:09] a doctrine and the next church age was
[32:12] crown now he was called what the
[32:15] antichrist spirit why because he's
[32:17] against the word so anything against The
[32:20] word is a spirit and it's antichrist
[32:21] spirit. It's against the word. He
[32:23] promised in the last days. All right,
[32:25] let me see
[32:28] here that he going to re bring the the
[32:30] fate of the children back to the faith
[32:32] of fathers. That's what he's going to
[32:32] restore. Now, first is the antichrist
[32:35] spirit only in spirit. Then he becomes
[32:37] an antichrist. And that spirit took a
[32:40] man and taught the same thing that the
[32:42] antichrist spirit was doing. Then he
[32:44] becomes a false prophet to the
[32:46] antichrist spirit. Finally, he becomes a
[32:49] beast. Now watch. Satan, Antichrist,
[32:52] spirit, spirit, incarnate, false
[32:56] prophet. Then come the beast. Now I know
[32:58] some will be repetit I'll be repeating
[32:59] it, but bear with us tonight. Now watch.
[33:02] Now when not a demon was in that
[33:04] antichrist but when Satan himself is
[33:06] kicked out he comes down and takes over
[33:10] the place where the demon was. Then the
[33:13] devil is incarnate in a man and Christ
[33:18] was the incarnate God. God incarnate in
[33:21] flesh and Judas was the son of predition
[33:24] as Jesus was the son of God incarnate.
[33:26] Judas was the incarnate devil. Now Satan
[33:30] is going to incarnate himself from
[33:32] antichrist to false prophet and in the
[33:35] last days of the Jew is the antichrist
[33:38] spirit in the early church. The dark
[33:40] ages he becomes false prophet for and
[33:42] see with a cup of iniquity. But in the
[33:45] age after the church goes home. So he's
[33:48] specifying that the church going to
[33:50] leave the bride going to be raptured the
[33:51] church going to go home. He becomes a
[33:53] beast. It becomes the devil incarnate
[33:57] the red dragon himself. Can't you see
[34:00] what I mean? He is incarnate in his
[34:02] people then. So Satan have his people
[34:04] and God have his people. Now watch. He
[34:07] talking about Satan has got his people
[34:10] bound by his power. The false prophet,
[34:13] this is how powerful this is. The false
[34:15] prophet has prophesied them right into
[34:19] it. Give them over to a strong delusion
[34:22] to believe a lie. and be damned by it.
[34:26] Denying the word with a form of
[34:28] godliness. This is church member. This
[34:31] is second Timothy. This is it right
[34:33] here. And denying the word with a form
[34:36] of godliness. They believe this part and
[34:38] that part by denying the power thereof.
[34:41] God works his place in trinity,
[34:43] justification, sanification, and then
[34:46] incarnate himself in his people with the
[34:49] baptism of the Holy Ghost. There's no
[34:50] way we could get away from it. You
[34:52] there's no way we could talk about Mary
[34:54] be it done unto me according to your
[34:56] word. No justification, sanctification,
[34:59] and the baptism of Holy Ghost. As I told
[35:01] some brother, the same Mary that say be
[35:02] it done unto me according to thy word
[35:04] have to go up in the upper room. So take
[35:06] that Mary and send her straight into the
[35:07] upper room to get the Holy Ghost. So the
[35:09] devil is just type after Christ. So when
[35:14] Jesus here we go incarnates himself in
[35:17] his people the very life that was in
[35:20] Christ is in this person. So these
[35:23] virtues which is the virtue of Jesus
[35:26] Christ not human temperance not human
[35:28] patience not natural godliness and
[35:30] natural this and natural that no the
[35:32] patience of Jesus Christ the brotherly
[35:34] kindness of Jesus Christ all of Jesus
[35:36] Christ that will be in the bride. The
[35:39] Holy Ghost that wrote the word said, "If
[35:40] a man has my spirit in him, he will do
[35:43] my works. The same works I do shall do
[35:45] also." Are we going? So then watch. He
[35:49] sanctifies and cleans him so he could
[35:52] stand before
[35:54] God. When Satan become incarnate into
[35:57] his church if there be a devil and they
[36:00] are the ones that are murdering and
[36:02] killing because Satan is a killer in the
[36:04] first place and a liar. Okay, we almost
[36:06] found a stretch here. Now remember the
[36:10] antichrist and beast is the self-same
[36:12] spirit self spirit. There's a trinity.
[36:15] Three stages of the devil power. First
[36:17] stage antichrist. Second stage false
[36:20] prophet. Third stage beast. Notice
[36:24] nicolatan the antichrist teaching
[36:26] started Paul against the word. Then the
[36:29] pope was the prophet to the false word.
[36:33] That made him a false prophet. The third
[36:36] stage is a beast, a man. Here we go.
[36:40] Listen carefully. That is crowned in the
[36:42] last days with every power that pagan
[36:46] Rome ever had because the sevenheaded
[36:49] beast dragon that was cast out of heaven
[36:53] comes incarnate in the false prophet.
[36:57] Here he is. He had seven crowns. He was
[36:59] cast out and thrown in the earth. And I
[37:03] know you're thinking about cast out
[37:04] battle war in heaven, but you will see
[37:06] where the prophet is drawing this from.
[37:09] What are we saying? I'm continuing. Who
[37:11] is this rider? This horse rider jump
[37:14] from white
[37:15] horse to black horse to red horse, black
[37:18] horse, pale horse. Who is this rider?
[37:21] This horse rider. You know what it is?
[37:23] It is Satan's Superman.
[37:26] Notice this rider is nothing but Satan's
[37:29] Superman, a incarnate devil. He's a
[37:32] educated genius. The whole world wanted
[37:36] a Superman. They're going to get it.
[37:38] Just wait till the literature goes up
[37:40] and Satan cast out. He'll be incarnate.
[37:43] That's right. They want somebody who can
[37:45] really do the job. He will do it. This
[37:48] is Satan Superman with education, with
[37:51] wisdom, with church theology, of his own
[37:54] word, of his own making. And he rises
[37:56] white the nominational horse to deceive
[37:59] the people. And he will conquer every
[38:02] religion of the world because they are
[38:04] all going into the confederation of
[38:06] churches and the whole confession of
[38:08] churches who already got their buildings
[38:10] built, everything right in line. There
[38:12] ain't one thing left. Every denomination
[38:14] stuck right into it. the confederation
[38:16] of churches. The white horse rider has
[38:18] been in the land all the time. He will
[38:20] change from antichrist to become a false
[38:23] prophet. And then later when the devil
[38:27] is cast out, he is incarnate then with
[38:29] the devil. Three stages. He's a devil to
[38:32] begin with. The spirit of the devil then
[38:33] becomes a false prophet teacher, false
[38:35] doctrine. Next thing he comes, the very
[38:37] devil incarnate himself. And at the same
[38:40] time that this devil falls out of heaven
[38:43] and becomes incarnate in a man, the Holy
[38:47] Spirit goes up and comes down incarnate.
[38:50] Amen.
[38:51] Amen. Oh my, is it something? We find
[38:56] out this mystery here in the church and
[38:57] state, the fourth stage of his ministry.
[38:59] He's called the beast. Revelation 12:13,
[39:02] Satan being kicked out from heaven. And
[39:05] this is what he said here. In the
[39:07] beginning was the word and the word was
[39:09] with God and the word was made flesh.
[39:13] Christ dwell among us. Now he is against
[39:16] the word. So he be antichrist but a
[39:18] spirit cannot be crowned and that's the
[39:22] reason he didn't have a crown. So now so
[39:25] you see you see a spirit cannot be
[39:26] crowned. So therefore it needs a body.
[39:29] So the antichrist spirit becomes
[39:31] incarnate into a man and that man
[39:35] changes from one thing to another from
[39:38] an antichrist spirit to a false prophet
[39:40] and then the beast comes into him just
[39:43] exactly like the church grows. The
[39:46] church grows. So the church comes
[39:47] through justification, sanctification
[39:50] and the baptis of the Holy Ghost as
[39:51] Christ being in the people.
[39:55] this false prophet, this antichrist,
[39:59] this beast. He is Satan's representative
[40:02] on the earth. He is now head of the
[40:05] kingdoms of the world. The very same
[40:08] kingdoms that he offered to the Lord
[40:10] Jesus in Matthew 4. Satan now becomes
[40:14] full king. And this happened, he's a
[40:17] false prophet now. He will become a
[40:19] beast after a while when he breaks his
[40:22] covenant with the Jews. Notice now these
[40:26] things are very important is detailed.
[40:28] He will be given a heart of a beast at
[40:33] that
[40:34] time. Satan will incarnate himself
[40:38] because the church is going up. Satan is
[40:42] cast out. And then this is the bomb
[40:45] here. He done all his accusing is done.
[40:49] But we give the Lord some praises. Satan
[40:52] is the accused of the brethren. And
[40:54] because he's taken up his case to God
[40:57] about the saints on the earth, he
[40:59] accusing them day and night before God.
[41:02] So right now he is in a realm pointing
[41:06] he did this, he did this, he did this.
[41:09] And our lawyer Jesus Christ is saying
[41:11] not guilty, not guilty. I died for them.
[41:14] I drop their charges. My blood. My
[41:17] blood. My blood. That's what going on
[41:19] Saturday. But some point in time when
[41:21] the bride is taken up, he has no more
[41:23] accusition to bring. So then he comes
[41:26] down on the earth because he have no
[41:27] place else to go. Really, he comes down
[41:30] on the earth. He have his superman ready
[41:32] to step into. God having a people ready
[41:35] to step into. Note that the image unto
[41:39] the beast have to get life. What did Bam
[41:42] reveal? The image, the statue of a
[41:45] perfect man, that image, that word is
[41:48] now in a bride. That image have to come
[41:50] to life. The prophet said they were in
[41:52] the upper room, dry seeds, seizes out
[41:54] life, and all of a sudden the water
[41:56] break, the Holy Ghost poured out and
[41:59] then the seeds begin to stretch and
[42:00] grow. This is what the devil is fighting
[42:02] that the Holy Ghost is not as real. They
[42:04] want to make the Holy Ghost everything
[42:06] different than what they had in their
[42:07] Pentecost. But I am saying tonight the
[42:10] same Holy Ghost that they receive on
[42:11] Pentecost is the same Holy Ghost we have
[42:13] to receive. Not a new Holy Ghost, not a
[42:16] modern Holy Ghost, no other kind of
[42:18] ghost, the same Holy Ghost. Because this
[42:21] is the message to turn our hearts back
[42:24] to what they had, which is the faith of
[42:25] the father. Because when they come out
[42:27] of that upper room, they had upon them
[42:29] the anointing of the land Shabba Judah.
[42:32] This pope, you notice the name he take,
[42:34] Pope Leo. That imposter impersonator.
[42:37] That Leo is the lion that is
[42:39] impersonating the coming of the Lord as
[42:42] Jesus Christ. He take on a certain name.
[42:44] And this Leo guy, I checked it out. Very
[42:47] strong in doctrine, very courageous,
[42:50] very disciplined. He's a certain type of
[42:52] mind. These guys doesn't take up names
[42:55] by chance. It's not by chance he take up
[42:57] the name Leo because the lion coming
[42:59] back. that land anointing will be upon a
[43:02] bride. Oh my, there'll be one more,
[43:04] right? Don't you h bless God tonight for
[43:07] his word and for sending us a prophet
[43:09] with the true teachings of the word. So
[43:11] let me just finish wrap up here now. Oh,
[43:13] praise God. So that that is what it is
[43:15] about friends. Blessed be the name of
[43:17] the Lord. So I want to share with you.
[43:19] You cannot in your human mind try to
[43:22] figure out God's plan and program. We
[43:24] have to line up. We can't expect God to
[43:26] feel sorry for us. We have to try to
[43:29] meet up with God's requirement. We have
[43:31] who he call the fact that you are called
[43:33] you know he for you. Well okay who he
[43:36] call you justified. There's a empty slot
[43:39] there and that starts the sanctified
[43:40] part. The cleaning up part the work part
[43:43] the labor part. The part that we do
[43:45] tonight in crying out and talking to the
[43:47] Lord and waiting upon God. There's a
[43:49] lethargy and a sluggish and a lazy
[43:52] spirit that's sweeping over the message
[43:54] over the years that people getting, you
[43:56] know, and that is where the fights
[43:58] coming now. The law delay is coming and
[44:00] this man fighting this one, this church
[44:02] fighting this one, this group fighting
[44:03] this one. I was telling them in a couple
[44:04] of services that the devil is in the
[44:06] church as the devil in the church.
[44:08] There's no press to come down because
[44:10] the devil sit back, relax, rock in his
[44:12] rocking chair. Let him fight it out. He
[44:14] is in the church. If we get the devil
[44:17] kicked out by forgiveness, by brotherly
[44:20] kindness, by the honey, if we get him
[44:22] out, then he have no choice but to send
[44:24] forces from outside to squeeze us. But
[44:27] as long as their internal foolishness,
[44:29] the devil will just sit down and laugh.
[44:31] And that is why the prophet is shame
[44:33] that things are going to happen to drive
[44:36] the true believers together. Things are
[44:38] going to happen. And this is what you
[44:40] see in here. When they take the pope out
[44:42] of America, certain things will start to
[44:45] happen. People will begin to realize
[44:47] it's not their church. It's not their
[44:48] tabernacle and they love the pastor so
[44:50] much and all that drama is whether or
[44:52] not you are sealed into the kingdom. And
[44:55] that is where the prayer is tonight to
[44:57] get into the church triumphant to get in
[44:59] the savior's bride. We have been pulled
[45:01] too long by this man and that man this
[45:04] teaching and that teaching and who are
[45:05] revelation and this is the word for the
[45:07] bride and all kind of drama and whatnot.
[45:09] The question is is are you in the church
[45:13] triumphant? Are you in the savior's
[45:15] bride? Come and be baptized into the
[45:17] body and forever more alive. This is
[45:20] what is about bringing each individual
[45:24] to the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Each
[45:26] one of us have to be confronted with
[45:28] this baptism of the Holy Ghost. It's an
[45:29] experience. It's not an imagination
[45:32] reading a book. It easier to read a book
[45:33] than to seek the Holy Ghost. It easier
[45:35] to read a book or listen to a tape and
[45:37] to seek God. We are called to seek God.
[45:40] There's none that seeketh after him. But
[45:41] we are called to seek after God. What
[45:44] going to happen in the last days? The
[45:45] heart of many will wax cold. What will
[45:47] happen in the last days? Prophecies.
[45:48] Your love will only be among the elect.
[45:50] These are things going to happen in the
[45:52] last days. Men will be uh falling away,
[45:55] falling away in the church, a fallen
[45:57] away in spirit. People know it's right
[45:59] and they have like no power. But God
[46:01] help us tonight. Right now we in the
[46:03] midst of prophecy. And friends, if this
[46:07] prophecy we from 1977 to now is about 48
[46:12] years, 48 years. Well, Kangly will know
[46:15] it. All the older ones, my parents, all
[46:17] the way back people will know these
[46:18] prophecies from way back then. It take
[46:21] 48 years to come to this truth. This guy
[46:24] 69 years old. He's quite young. He could
[46:27] run the next 20 years. Normal, normal,
[46:29] normal. All right. But what I'm saying
[46:31] is this. We are at the door. We are at
[46:34] the door and it's not like we have to
[46:36] look outside for signs. We have to look
[46:37] to what God is doing among us. What God
[46:40] doing with you, what God doing in your
[46:42] life and your heart. Let's bow our
[46:43] heads. Heavenly Father, I thank you
[46:45] tonight for the truth of your word that
[46:48] you did send this evening messenger Lord
[46:50] to shine light into our path. And what
[46:53] make this Bible such a glorious book is
[46:55] not a just a book about behavior and
[46:57] attitude and life and godliness. It's a
[46:59] book of prophecy. And Lord, it's really
[47:02] thrilling to see these words come alive.
[47:06] To know
[47:07] 1954 by your spirit you spoke that they
[47:11] will take a pope out of America and what
[47:13] will happen behind that. And here we are
[47:16] living in those days. As I often time
[47:18] share with the church according to
[47:20] Revelation 10, oh God 11, thou must
[47:24] prophesy again. And the only reason we
[47:26] could prophesy is because it's not yet
[47:28] fulfilled. But we could say today that
[47:31] this prophecy, this day, the scripture
[47:34] is fulfilled. This prophecy is
[47:36] fulfilled. Father, what about a prophecy
[47:38] for the bride? Father, what about a
[47:40] prophecy for this bride's revival? You
[47:42] said it will take those seven thunders.
[47:44] You said he will send it. You said he
[47:47] would because he promised it. You said
[47:49] if the people will forget their creeds
[47:51] and dogmas and plead the promises, it
[47:53] will become effective to them. Father,
[47:55] tonight we come to plea your promises.
[47:57] Send that revival. Send a revival that
[48:00] will stir our hearts and turn our
[48:02] hearts. Lord, your prophet taught us.
[48:04] Don't let that enthusiasm die. Don't let
[48:07] it go down. Don't get dry up. Lord, your
[48:09] prophet taught us that we should be like
[48:12] skins, new skins, skins with oil in it.
[48:14] That we could become flexible. When the
[48:16] oil leave the skin, the believer get
[48:18] hard, dry, nothing moving, no
[48:21] revelation, no inspiration, no oil. Oh
[48:24] God, tonight bring that oil back. brain.
[48:26] Give me oil in my lamp to keep me
[48:28] burning. Oh God, set us on fire and dip
[48:31] us in oil. That that oil, that fire will
[48:34] flow. That oil can flow and keep us
[48:37] burning. Lord, burning to it coming,
[48:39] Lord. We see things are being
[48:41] positioned. Russia right now is
[48:43] celebrating. Oh, have their big
[48:45] celebration there. Maybe celebration of
[48:47] the world war. Father, and and there are
[48:49] kings that are dear, oh God. Things are
[48:52] setting. The battle is still ongoing in
[48:54] Ukraine. Lord, India and Pakistan, they
[48:57] have start up some thing going there is
[49:00] the world is going in a certain gear.
[49:02] Help us as a church. Help us as a
[49:05] people. Help us as individuals. Oh God,
[49:08] my friend and brother in Tamu, India.
[49:10] Father, you tell me that the oh God, the
[49:12] drone, they come so close to his home
[49:14] and to pray for him. Father, pray for
[49:16] them in Tamu. Lord Jesus, that your Holy
[49:19] Spirit will keep and preserve him,
[49:20] Father, and touch his life, his family,
[49:22] and keep them and preserve them in the
[49:24] name of Jesus. And all those believers
[49:26] who might be under fire or close to
[49:28] where this this drama is taking place.
[49:30] May you be with them in a special way in
[49:32] the name of Jesus Christ. Father God,
[49:34] look over your people tonight. Look over
[49:36] the elders, the ministers, look over
[49:38] your look over each heart here tonight.
[49:40] those that are sick, those that are
[49:41] struggling, those that are under
[49:42] depression, frustration, those that
[49:44] don't understand, those that are just
[49:46] far away and and and weak, Lord God,
[49:49] weak in faith. Lord, you promise a third
[49:51] pull to help those that are weak in that
[49:53] way. Father God, give us great faith
[49:55] tonight as we call upon your name. Oh
[49:57] God, may the word be inspiring to us.
[49:59] May we see that brotherly kind is not a
[50:01] light thing. It's not a light thing.
[50:03] It's a serious thing that we could drop
[50:05] ours and forgive and let go. There are
[50:08] people have a tough time letting go.
[50:10] What about the gossipers? Lord, the
[50:12] people that gossip and run their mouths.
[50:14] Oh Jesus, I won't you just shut their
[50:15] mouths. Would they would they come and
[50:17] get rid of that gossiping spirit that
[50:19] they will think twice who they talk to
[50:21] and tell them what. Father God, you said
[50:24] if you want to have the spirit around
[50:25] you say something nice, say something
[50:28] good, say something loyal, say something
[50:30] true, not negative, not bad, not trying
[50:33] to bring somebody down or make other
[50:35] people see them negatively. Oh God,
[50:37] that's just plain wrong. Trying to pull
[50:40] down someone, trying to point others in
[50:43] a way that will see them in a negative
[50:44] light. Father, that's not what we are
[50:46] called to do. We are called to see
[50:48] through the blood. We are called to see
[50:50] an opportunity that God could change and
[50:52] reform and transform a person. Oh God,
[50:54] help us tonight that instead of talking
[50:56] about that we could pray about someone
[50:58] instead of pulling down someone, we
[51:00] could pray that God bless them and help
[51:01] them and lift them up. Oh God, we see
[51:03] people struggling with their laziness,
[51:05] with their slothfulness, with their
[51:07] unbelief. But Father, I pray for a
[51:09] mighty deliverance. As a pastor, I've
[51:11] preached over the years, seen all kind
[51:12] of conditions in the church. But Lord, I
[51:15] still believe for them. I still believe
[51:17] that you will do a work for them. Oh,
[51:18] God, won't you start that work tonight?
[51:20] Would you do it tonight? Revive the
[51:22] church. Revive individuals. Revive
[51:24] hearts and lives. May they understand
[51:26] this message is real. This message is
[51:28] alive. You have not forsaken us. You
[51:31] have not give up on us, but you still
[51:33] believe that we will come true. Father,
[51:35] that is why you let the prophet
[51:36] prophesy. I believe the bride is called.
[51:38] I believe the bride is sealed into the
[51:40] kingdom. She has got the mechanics
[51:42] written in the dynamics. And the
[51:43] dynamics is the Holy Ghost. Oh God, send
[51:46] out that Holy Ghost. Men try to mistrify
[51:48] it. Men try to teach it. Men try to say
[51:50] all kind of thing about it and and push
[51:52] it to the side like that cornerstone
[51:54] that was once rejected, but the stone
[51:56] the build refused that became the
[51:58] headstone of the corner. Father, won't
[51:59] you come and cap the pyramid of our
[52:01] lives? Lord, when the prophet talked
[52:02] about that, nobody talk knew what he was
[52:04] talking about. But now we know that our
[52:07] lives have to be capped. Cat by love,
[52:09] even divine love. That is why you took
[52:11] him into the restaurant. That is why you
[52:13] took him from condemning a woman to
[52:15] showing him that the same blood for him
[52:17] was from that woman he was condemning
[52:18] and she was restored. Oh God, help us.
[52:20] Help us to come out of that. Help us to
[52:22] come out all this legalistic nonsense.
[52:24] Help us to come out all this condemn and
[52:26] condemning and who is this and who is
[52:28] that. Help us to come completely out of
[52:29] that and to see your blood. Oh God, the
[52:32] world is in darkness. It's gross
[52:33] darkness over the earth and over the
[52:35] people, over this message. All kind of
[52:37] foolishness being preached and being
[52:39] taught. All kind of contrary, delusional
[52:41] lies being pedled by spirits. But God,
[52:44] you promise when the enemy come like a
[52:46] flood, the spirit of God raise a
[52:47] standard. Oh God, tonight raise a
[52:49] standard. Raise a standard in the hearts
[52:51] and minds of your children. Raise a
[52:53] standard in their homes. Lord, shake the
[52:55] brothers. Shake the fathers. Shake, oh
[52:57] God, them. Shake them back into order,
[53:00] oh God, the order of spirit. Bring back
[53:02] the homes back in order. Grant it Lord.
[53:04] Bless the sisters. Bless the wives.
[53:06] Bless the mothers. Be with them, Father.
[53:08] And be with a time that we have in this
[53:10] time of prayer. In Jesus name I ask it.
[53:12] Amen and amen. God bless you as you only
[53:15] get on in prayer. I trust them that this
[53:17] would have be some help to you in some
[53:19] way that the Holy Spirit will be with
[53:22] us. Amen. So, God bless you. Amen.
[53:25] Praise God. Hallelujah. Let's worship.
[53:27] Just give God some praises before we
[53:28] start in prayer. Just give God some
[53:30] praise right where you are. Oh, thank
[53:32] you Lord Jesus. Thank you Lord Jesus.
[53:34] Thank you Lord Jesus. Hallelujah.
[53:37] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[53:40] Hallelujah. Thank you Lord. Thank you
[53:42] Lord. Praise be to Jesus. Praise his
[53:45] name. Praise his wonderful name. Thank
[53:47] you Lord. Let we get up in prayer. Thank
[53:49] you Lord.

[1:41:50] need revelation. How we need revelation
[1:41:52] and revelation is prevailing power.
[1:41:54] Revelation is a hearing from heaven. Oh

[1:42:00] spirit speak it expressly. May we hear a

[1:42:52] for your honor and glory. I ask in Jesus
[1:42:55] name. Amen. God bless the saints. Thanks
[1:42:57] again for being here tonight. Uh the
[1:42:59] presence of God is here and and we
[1:43:01] believe that God is merciful to us. Just
[1:43:04] remember the scripture we read
[1:43:06] Revelation 13 to America. So here it is.
[1:43:09] You have an American pope. The beast
[1:43:12] system is in effect. And here it is the
[1:43:14] image of the beast where I'm talking
[1:43:16] about the devil coming down under the
[1:43:18] opices of the United Nations to enforce
[1:43:20] laws. So everything is set. The drama is
[1:43:23] now set for the bride. She has to get
[1:43:26] her position in the word. So may God
[1:43:27] bless you. Have a great evening and see
[1:43:30] you on Sunday. God be with you. Bye.
