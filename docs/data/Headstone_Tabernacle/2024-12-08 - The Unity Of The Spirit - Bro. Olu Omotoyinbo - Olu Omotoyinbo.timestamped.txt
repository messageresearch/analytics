[41:43] deserves any Commendation is brother
[41:45] Isaac in this context here because he's
[41:47] held this meeting s for like 30 years or
[41:50] so now I mean such faithfulness is is
[41:53] really remarkable Isaac We Salute You
[41:56] salute you
[41:58] thank
[42:01] you thank you and to The Headstone
[42:03] charity Tabernacle that supported him
[42:05] all these years we do our hearts to you
[42:08] for staying with the pastor and doing
[42:12] all that you need to do to uh receive us
[42:15] each time we come and um to
[42:19] to um hat to so many people from
[42:23] different backgrounds different needs

[42:29] commendable I want to say thank you to
[42:31] the ministry the helps and governments
[42:32] of the church thank you so much for
[42:34] always making us feel at home in are I
[42:36] always feel at home and I know that's
[42:38] the testimony of many other people also
[42:40] and to the pastors the
[42:42] ministers the I think the pastor M were
[42:44] already introduced this morning and the
[42:46] Believers from different churches and
[42:48] attendance today you could have been
[42:50] your own services but you chose to come
[42:52] here I want to say thank you because
[42:54] like I always say and many ministers
[42:56] always say if there no people we will
[42:58] not have a convention so between the
[43:01] minister and the people I think the
[43:03] people are more needed to make a
[43:05] convention than the the preachers so we
[43:08] thank you for coming and being faithful

[47:49] 16 Ephesians 4:1 reads on these
[47:53] wise I therefore the prisoner of the
[47:56] Lord
[47:57] like brother Gideon was telling on
[47:59] yesterday to become
[48:01] that like it said
[48:04] that when you surrender
[48:07] all is the only surrender that gives you
[48:10] Victory any other type of surrender
[48:13] doesn't guarantee you Victory in Jesus
[48:16] but when you surrender
[48:18] all when you walk with the Lord like
[48:20] brother the G yesterday then you are
[48:23] guaranteed Victory in Jesus because when
[48:25] he's by your side you are y with him
[48:27] he's never lost a battle and he will
[48:29] never lose a battle so I therefore the
[48:31] pron of the Lord beseech you that you

[50:17] every joint supplieth according to the
[50:18] effectual walking in the measure of
[50:20] every path maketh the increase of the
[50:22] body unto the edifying of itself in love
[50:26] amen may the Lord add his to the reading
[50:28] of his holy words you may please be
[50:38] seated I got a tile the unity of the
[50:43] spirit
[50:46] um I got a few con scriptures you don't
[50:49] have to open them I'll read I'll read um
[50:52] one or two of them or two of them
[50:54] actually um ionic scripture
[50:57] Genesis 1:
[50:59] 26-28 which is where it all started from
[51:03] on the face of the Earth Here
[51:06] amen Joel 2
[51:10] 28-31 Acts 2 vers 1
[51:13] to8 now we know jeel to I mean jeel to
[51:18] in the last days I poured my spirit upon
[51:20] All Flesh and that promise that we all
[51:23] know about so much but if you know the
[51:27] promise was I will pour out my spirit
[51:29] upon All Flesh in other words there's
[51:31] going to be a union of the spirit of God
[51:34] and the Flesh of
[51:36] man God's spirit is going to be anointed
[51:40] into the Flesh of
[51:45] man and
[51:47] then when on the day of Pentecost came
[51:51] and they were filled with the Holy Ghost
[51:54] Peter inspired by the spirit
[51:57] said that this is that which was spoken
[52:01] by Joel the prophet in other words the
[52:05] baptism of the Holy Ghost was the
[52:09] Fulfillment of this promise that the
[52:12] spirit will anoint I mean will Unite
[52:15] with the Flesh of
[52:20] man and on the day of Pentecost they had
[52:22] a little more than what you and I talk
[52:24] about receiving the baptis of the Holy
[52:25] Ghost for breth they had much more than
[52:27] that they had it all the way up to where
[52:30] the world was living in their flesh so
[52:33] to speak the unity they were United with
[52:35] the faith they were uned with the word
[52:36] of the
[52:37] hour
[52:39] amen
[52:42] amen so jel 2:
[52:46] 28-31 in here has the promise in this
[52:48] verses here that the spirit of God and
[52:51] the Flesh of man will be United together
[52:55] so when you receive the baptism of the
[52:57] Holy Ghost it's not so to say like oh me
[53:00] have been filled no it's a little more
[53:02] than
[53:04] that oh I also have been filled thank
[53:07] God no it's a little more than
[53:09] that it's God's spirit coming into your
[53:13] soul but he wants to find an abod in
[53:15] your
[53:16] flesh that's what they had to where when
[53:19] they walk their Shadow was the spirit of
[53:23] God and it went over sick people
[53:27] and they were healed even without hands
[53:29] being laid upon
[53:33] them sir jel 2 and verse 28 and it shall
[53:38] come to pass afterward that I will pour
[53:41] out my spirit upon All Flesh and your
[53:44] sons and your daughters shall prophesy
[53:46] your old men shall dream dreams and your
[53:49] young men shall see Visions That's All

[55:34] interpretation once you see the
[55:36] manifestation nobody needs to interpret
[55:38] the word has interpreted itself amen
[55:41] that's what happened to of Pentecost and
[55:44] Acts 2 verse1 and when the day of
[55:46] Pentecost was fully come they were all
[55:49] with one according one place and
[55:51] suddenly there came a sound from Heaven
[55:54] as of a rushing Mighty Wind and they

[57:41] they shall
[57:43] prophesy it said I will pour out off my
[57:47] spirit I don't want to get into all of
[57:49] that but so this is not making you the
[57:51] holy spirit because you can never be the
[57:53] Holy
[57:54] Spirit of my Spirit we receive a portion
[57:58] of the spirit the only person that did
[58:01] not receive the Holy Spirit by measure

[58:44] wonders in Heaven above and signs in the
[58:48] earth beneath Among Us here signs in the
[58:51] earth
[58:53] beneath blood and fire and Vapor of
[58:56] smoke the sun shall be turned into
[58:58] darkness and the moon into blood before
[59:01] that great and notable day of the Lord
[59:03] come and it shall come to pass that what
[59:06] whosoever shall call on the name of the
[59:08] Lord shall be saved is a day of
[59:12] salvation
[59:13] amen so you can
[59:15] see Unity of the spirit Unity of the
[59:18] faith what is unity of but Isaac's
[59:21] inspiration to gather us
[59:23] together Unity of the faith what is does
[59:26] it mean it simply means United with the
[59:29] faith that's what it
[59:31] means the union that the faith brings
[59:35] when you and the faith are united or
[59:38] anyone and the faith are united that's
[59:40] the union that they bring like a man and
[59:43] woman at United say that's husband and
[59:45] wife
[59:46] amen and the faith like brother Isaac so
[59:49] beautifully brought to us this morning
[59:50] already is the word of God the message
[59:53] the Lord Jesus Christ for this day for
[59:55] what every age but for this day the
[59:58] fullness of the atonement the fullness
[1:00:01] of signs wonders and miracles that's the
[1:00:04] message for this day that's the faith in
[1:00:06] this day here amen so Unity of the faith
[1:00:08] is that message and you United and
[1:00:11] becoming one
[1:00:14] hallelujah amen the Bible say faith
[1:00:16] cometh by hearing hearing the word of
[1:00:19] God Amen so here we are we have a
[1:00:22] promise there going to be a Unity of the
[1:00:24] faith but how does this Union come about
[1:00:27] who officiates this Union this is the
[1:00:30] faith this is you who's going to do the
[1:00:32] journey together how you get to connect
[1:00:34] that with the faith and that's what we
[1:00:36] just read the Holy Spirit does this
[1:00:38] Union the holy spirit is the officiating
[1:00:40] Minister the holy spirit is one that
[1:00:42] connects you together with the faith
[1:00:45] Hallelujah the Holy Spirit unites the
[1:00:47] individual with the faith the word the

[1:01:33] briad comes to
[1:01:34] adoption adop at adoption the Lord Jesus
[1:01:37] Christ is reproduced in flesh again
[1:01:41] that's what they had in the book of Acts
[1:01:43] that's what they had in that original
[1:01:45] Ephesians church that brother Isaac
[1:01:46] spoke about on
[1:01:50] Friday Jesus was manifesting their flesh
[1:01:53] and they took notice with them that they

[1:04:57] that's our promise you may be seated
[1:05:01] amen
[1:05:04] amen so our goal is the unity of the
[1:05:07] faith where we're going to be United
[1:05:09] with the faith it's not it's not me
[1:05:11] United with you that's what theity of
[1:05:13] the spirit is about for you and I to be
[1:05:15] United together before you each one of
[1:05:18] us United with the faith because many
[1:05:20] timesed fath like we United we're in we
[1:05:22] united we are un that's that's you are
[1:05:24] belittling this gospel
[1:05:25] [Music]
[1:05:28] sure you need to be United with the
[1:05:30] people and that's what I'm I'm that's
[1:05:33] what I've been spoken about in this
[1:05:34] convention and that's what I'm putting
[1:05:35] my shoulder to the wheel to talk about
[1:05:37] still in this convention but that's what
[1:05:39] the UN of the spirit is about and that's
[1:05:41] why you will never get to un of the
[1:05:43] faith without coming through the UN of
[1:05:45] the spirit it's not going to
[1:05:48] happen because because brother bam said
[1:05:51] I mean the book of Acts said they were
[1:05:53] in one mind one Accord
[1:05:56] what is that Unity of the
[1:05:58] spirit there belov nowhere else but in
[1:06:02] the bride what produces that Unity of
[1:06:04] the
[1:06:05] spirit until we get to that spot there's
[1:06:08] no Unity of the faith so first things
[1:06:11] thrust
[1:06:13] amen you may be
[1:06:17] seated
[1:06:19] so in the promise of the unity of the
[1:06:22] faith is Veil is hidden a promise of the
[1:06:27] outpouring of the Holy Spirit which is
[1:06:29] what
[1:06:32] will in the last
[1:06:34] days uh jel said Peter said last days
[1:06:38] when is these last days
[1:06:40] T they standed right there on the day of
[1:06:44] Pentecost and we are still in the last
[1:06:48] days amen when the closing seconds of
[1:06:53] the last days that's why the promise is
[1:06:56] relevant to them and relevant to us also
[1:07:00] hallelujah
[1:07:03] amen
[1:07:05] amen and like we already pointed
[1:07:07] according to Acts 2 and I mean J 228 and
[1:07:12] ask you the baptism of the Holy Ghost is
[1:07:16] how the spirit of God unit with your
[1:07:22] flesh did you get that without the
[1:07:25] baptis the Holy Ghost you are a Believer
[1:07:27] that's fine but you don't have the
[1:07:29] spirit of
[1:07:31] God working in your
[1:07:33] flesh that's why you will struggle
[1:07:37] that's how you will struggle against sin
[1:07:39] that's how you will struggle against
[1:07:40] backb that's why you struggle against
[1:07:41] basic things because the power is the
[1:07:44] holy
[1:07:46] spirit Paul said I know that that is in
[1:07:48] my flesh there lies not one good thing
[1:07:51] so stop struggling you can't get it done
[1:07:54] by your struggles that's why many people
[1:07:56] are struggling and they get frustrated
[1:07:59] relax come get the Holy
[1:08:01] Ghost at the last day of the feast which
[1:08:04] is this day Jesus stood up and said amen
[1:08:09] he that believeth in me out of his belly
[1:08:11] shall flow
[1:08:12] rivers of Living Water come to the
[1:08:15] Fountain and drink the Holy Ghost is
[1:08:18] here for you to baptize your soul with
[1:08:20] fire and bur the snake out of there and
[1:08:23] the spirit will begin to go into your
[1:08:24] flesh
[1:08:25] to live a Christian Life oh
[1:08:30] Hallelujah you may be
[1:08:32] [Applause]
[1:08:38] seated so I promise that they we are
[1:08:41] going to come until they all come to the
[1:08:42] unity of the faith in there is the
[1:08:44] promise veiled of the outp of the Holy
[1:08:48] Ghost so we have a right to expect in
[1:08:51] every
[1:08:52] service in every convention every time
[1:08:54] every day at home at school at play at
[1:08:57] work amen because you have a promise
[1:08:59] hanging over us B the Holy Ghost because
[1:09:03] the baptism is how the spirit of God
[1:09:05] unites with the Flesh of
[1:09:07] man in other
[1:09:09] words to come to the unity of the faith
[1:09:13] that's promised us for this day there is
[1:09:15] going to be an
[1:09:16] outpouring of the B of the Holy Ghost
[1:09:19] how many understand that say
[1:09:21] amen
[1:09:23] amen and we saw that in the book of
[1:09:27] Acts and he wrote a book of Acts behind
[1:09:30] them only one man stood of Peter one man
[1:09:33] not an angel a man stood up and said
[1:09:35] this is that this is the
[1:09:37] Fulfillment of what the prophet said
[1:09:40] what you are seeing is what you seeing
[1:09:41] here is the holy
[1:09:43] spirit joining up with the Flesh of
[1:09:50] men the baptism of the Holy Spirit you
[1:09:53] may be seated was the fulfillment in the
[1:09:56] book of Acts of the promis in Joel that
[1:10:00] the spirit of God will Unite with the
[1:10:03] Flesh of
[1:10:05] men like the spirit of God United in a
[1:10:09] body of Flesh in
[1:10:10] Mary and produced the son of
[1:10:15] God when the spirit of God unites your
[1:10:18] [Music]
[1:10:19] flesh that's what's going to produce the
[1:10:22] Son of God and it happened before
[1:10:26] amen St Luke
[1:10:29] 1:35 and the angel answered and said
[1:10:31] unto Mary the Holy Ghost shall shall
[1:10:35] come upon
[1:10:36] thee and the power of the highest shall
[1:10:39] overshadow thee th the apping in your
[1:10:44] flesh therefore also that Holy thing
[1:10:48] which shall be born of thee shall be
[1:10:50] called The Son of
[1:10:53] God the spirit of God like you today
[1:10:57] Came Upon Mary that young virgin girl
[1:11:00] thinking on the word the spirit of God
[1:11:03] Came Upon
[1:11:04] her and the spirit of God
[1:11:07] United the Flesh of Mary with the spirit
[1:11:10] of God and he produced the son of God
[1:11:14] God's example his son the second Adam
[1:11:17] the Lord Jesus Christ Spirit come down
[1:11:20] anoint Mary in our flesh I me anoint
[1:11:23] Mary and the spirit anoint aned join up
[1:11:26] with the Flesh and produce the Son of
[1:11:31] God and that Son of God the Lord Jesus
[1:11:33] CH was God example seat son let me read
[1:11:36] you this here on the spoken word is
[1:11:38] original seat brother said 163 then the
[1:11:42] works will be manifested in him are the
[1:11:44] same for is the same seed the word of
[1:11:47] God God's son was his example seed and
[1:11:51] what his life was when the spirit poured
[1:11:54] upon him after his baptism and the Holy
[1:11:57] Ghost come upon him the very life that
[1:12:00] he produced well that same watering
[1:12:03] Spirit of the Holy Ghost will bring
[1:12:05] forth the same kind of a life doing the
[1:12:07] same things that he did if is the same
[1:12:09] seed son of God's seed will bring forth
[1:12:12] a son of God's seed in other words in
[1:12:16] other words when this Brad comes to the
[1:12:18] unity of the faith when the Holy Spirit
[1:12:21] anoints her anoints the word into her
[1:12:23] flesh what's going to happen
[1:12:26] she will she must necessarily produce
[1:12:29] the same kind of life that Jesus lived
[1:12:32] after his baptism she must produce that
[1:12:36] it can't be anything but that Hallelujah
[1:12:39] she must live the same kind of life and
[1:12:42] she must do the same kind of works that
[1:12:43] he did because he was God's example s
[1:12:46] son that was the second Adam the Lord
[1:12:49] Jesus our example sit son God's example
[1:12:52] sit son and that's the life that the the
[1:12:55] bride will also produce when she comes
[1:12:57] to the unity of the faith the word may
[1:12:59] flesh like
[1:13:00] Jesus
[1:13:02] amen and because were God's example sit
[1:13:05] son it means every Son of God must come
[1:13:08] to
[1:13:09] manifestation the same way that he came
[1:13:13] it's not about being a Son of God it's
[1:13:14] about being a manifested Son of
[1:13:17] God I don't doubt that you are a son of
[1:13:20] God but in the Bible is the
[1:13:23] manifestation that's what what we're
[1:13:25] talking about Adam was a son in Genesis
[1:13:27] 1 126 and 28 but until that what wased
[1:13:30] into his flesh Genesis 2:7 you saw no
[1:13:42] son so the first Adam come exactly the
[1:13:45] same way like the second Adam come by
[1:13:48] the spirit of God anointing the word
[1:13:51] into his flesh uniting the world with
[1:13:54] his flesh
[1:13:56] amen Genesis 12628 was the spirit of God
[1:14:00] Genesis 126 let us make M our image the
[1:14:04] seed the promise Amen in Adam's Soul
[1:14:08] representing the baptism of the Holy
[1:14:11] Ghost and God made created man in his
[1:14:15] own image the creation come after the
[1:14:18] baptism adding the nature of God adding
[1:14:21] the seven spirits of
[1:14:23] God to the spirit
[1:14:25] baptism to create the Son of God in the
[1:14:28] image of
[1:14:34] god let's make man in our image image of
[1:14:38] the word the forming of the word
[1:14:42] image and Genesis 1: 26-28 was Adam
[1:14:46] baptized with the Holy Ghost was Adam
[1:14:48] the holy ghost coming upon him to to
[1:14:50] pull out of his seat seven spirits to
[1:14:53] stand in the nature
[1:14:55] perfect nature of God the measure of the
[1:14:57] stature of the
[1:15:00] fullness
[1:15:02] amen but it wasn't manifested
[1:15:06] yet but when the spirit of
[1:15:10] God the word image in his soul United
[1:15:14] with the Flesh in Genesis
[1:15:16] 2:7 Adam the first Son of God on the
[1:15:19] face of the Earth was manifested on the
[1:15:21] earth then that's when the walk could
[1:15:23] see that's when every body could see
[1:15:25] there's a Son of God on the face of the
[1:15:26] earth a manifested son Adam became a Son
[1:15:31] of God and amatal God on the earth
[1:15:34] ruling the Earth with power and glory
[1:15:37] and Authority on behalf of God his
[1:15:40] father that's how Adam came the spirit
[1:15:43] anointed the word into his
[1:15:45] flesh that's how Jesus came the spirit
[1:15:47] anointed the word into Mary's
[1:15:49] flesh and when he received the B himself
[1:15:52] the spirit anointed the word into his
[1:15:54] flesh
[1:15:59] and because every son must come to
[1:16:02] manifestation all nature is
[1:16:06] groaning for the revelation of the sons
[1:16:09] of God for the
[1:16:12] manifestation of the sons of God and
[1:16:15] this is how sons of God come to
[1:16:16] manifestation by the spirit anointing
[1:16:20] the world into their flesh Hallelujah
[1:16:28] because every son must come to
[1:16:30] manifestation in exactly the same way as
[1:16:33] God's examples his son
[1:16:35] came because of that as a result of that
[1:16:39] we have a promise from the prophet of
[1:16:40] Malachi 4 that more sons of God are
[1:16:43] coming back coming back to be like Jesus
[1:16:47] coming back to be like Adam the word in
[1:16:49] their flesh Hallelujah the glory of God
[1:16:53] around them that's our promise
[1:16:58] amen amen we are coming back to a Unity
[1:17:00] of the faith where the spirit of God
[1:17:03] will once again Unite with the Flesh of
[1:17:05] man and sons of God will be manifested
[1:17:08] on the earth once more like it was on
[1:17:11] the day of Pentecost once more like what
[1:17:14] with Jesus once more like what Adam amen
[1:17:17] manifested Sons it will be a super sign
[1:17:21] God and man together Hallelujah
[1:17:25] on adoption part four tell me my brother
[1:17:28] tell me my sister when was the time that
[1:17:30] the Son of God was ever to be manifested
[1:17:33] out of this time
[1:17:35] now when was there a time in the history
[1:17:39] going all the way back amen there was to
[1:17:42] manifest the time to deliver all
[1:17:47] nature nature the nature itself is
[1:17:49] growing waiting for the time of the
[1:17:52] manifestation and human beings are not
[1:17:54] waiting for for the time of the
[1:17:59] manifestation nature is growing in
[1:18:01] waiting for the time of the
[1:18:02] manifestation why before the atonement
[1:18:04] was made before the atonement was made
[1:18:07] in the Old Testament year before Christ
[1:18:10] came before the Holy Ghost was ever
[1:18:12] poured out before the Old Testament on
[1:18:15] down there there couldn't have been
[1:18:18] manifestation because it takes the Holy
[1:18:20] Spirit to anoint the word into flesh
[1:18:22] there couldn't have been a manifestation
[1:18:28] hallah in other words they could not
[1:18:30] come to the unity of the faith in the
[1:18:31] Old Testament because it takes the Holy
[1:18:34] Spirit the fullness of the holy spirit
[1:18:37] all seven parts of him to anoint the
[1:18:41] word into your flesh and they'll see
[1:18:43] Jesus because it's not one spirit it's
[1:18:45] all seven spirits
[1:18:48] God fully God in manifestation as in a
[1:18:51] Sevenfold nature of his being
[1:18:55] amen before the atonement was made amen
[1:18:58] that could not have been manifestation
[1:19:00] it had to wait till this time now all
[1:19:02] things has been
[1:19:05] brought coming shaping up to a headstone
[1:19:08] he's telling you something he's telling
[1:19:10] you that is adding to the life of Jesus
[1:19:12] Christ which he preached years later on
[1:19:14] the statute of a perfect man amen it had
[1:19:17] to wait till this time all things has
[1:19:19] been brought coming shaping up to a
[1:19:20] headstone to the manifestation of sons
[1:19:23] of God coming
[1:19:25] back and the spirit of God that's what
[1:19:29] I'm telling you and the spirit of God
[1:19:31] coming into these men so perfectly when
[1:19:34] you hear that it mean a seven spirit
[1:19:37] because seven that's the fullness of the
[1:19:40] spirit
[1:19:42] amen and the spirit of God coming to
[1:19:44] this man so
[1:19:45] perfectly until their ministry will be
[1:19:49] so close like Christ till rejoin him and
[1:19:52] his church together they'll be become

[1:20:04] the faith your promise that sons of God
[1:20:07] are coming back like Adam like Jesus
[1:20:10] like the book of Acts that's your
[1:20:12] promise
[1:20:15] hallelujah oh
[1:20:18] hallelujah
[1:20:20] amen
[1:20:21] Amen on a super sign 959 and another
[1:20:26] thing paragraph 70 the word was made
[1:20:28] flesh dust and dwelt Among Us Jehovah
[1:20:32] the word became human became D and
[1:20:34] Tabernacle with us everlasting sign
[1:20:36] shall never end oh when we think of it
[1:20:38] an eternal sign the super signs of all
[1:20:40] signs God becoming one of us then again
[1:20:44] he must be the Seed of Abraham Abraham
[1:20:46] of course was the seed of Eve what this
[1:20:49] Prophet here Abram was the seed of Eve
[1:20:53] was the woman seed that was to br head
[1:20:55] but Abraham if you can catch it I'm
[1:20:58] reading he had faith in God which United
[1:21:02] the spirit of God with the Flesh of
[1:21:09] man that's the unity of the faith right
[1:21:15] there that's where the faith come that's
[1:21:18] why it could be the Abram seed not of
[1:21:22] flesh but the uniting of spirit and
[1:21:25] flesh
[1:21:27] together god making himself cheering out
[1:21:31] rooting out all evil bringing into
[1:21:33] submission the flesh the dust that
[1:21:36] created and live with you and in you as
[1:21:38] a
[1:21:39] partner
[1:21:44] hallelujah
[1:21:46] hallelujah so friends we have
[1:21:48] promised a Unity of the faith adoption
[1:21:51] time but how do we get there
[1:21:54] how do we get to this the spirit
[1:21:57] anointing the war into our flesh how do
[1:21:58] we get
[1:22:02] there you may be
[1:22:05] seated so we promised you of the faith
[1:22:09] adoption time but before that promise
[1:22:12] can come to pass there must of necessity
[1:22:16] be a Unity of the spirit
[1:22:20] first and that's why say that's why we
[1:22:22] are failing that's why the church is
[1:22:24] failing on that
[1:22:32] walk brother benam said so not me saying
[1:22:35] it Unity of the spirit before Unity of
[1:22:38] the faith Ephesians said so Unity of the
[1:22:41] spirit vers Ephesians 4:3 Unity of the
[1:22:44] faith Ephesians
[1:22:46] 4:13 Unity of the spirit before Unity of
[1:22:49] the faith un of the spirit before
[1:22:51] adoption time before signs wonders of
[1:22:54] miracle sure we have signs wonders and
[1:22:56] miracles now but you haven't seen
[1:22:57] nothing
[1:23:00] yet no this is not to say you back up
[1:23:02] and you don't pray for the SI now we we
[1:23:04] pray for the we cast out Devils even
[1:23:07] right now like last night cast those
[1:23:09] Devils
[1:23:13] out but you know the trouble of is many
[1:23:15] many of us make Faith so complicated one
[1:23:19] thing that always as telling me about
[1:23:21] brother bam you made Faith so simple he
[1:23:24] was like was Liv in a realm that where
[1:23:27] was so
[1:23:29] simple you didn't have to Nash his teeth
[1:23:32] and struggle with believing struggle
[1:23:34] with
[1:23:36] believing and that's how many of us
[1:23:39] understand faith and that's why we don't
[1:23:41] get what we ask for because without
[1:23:44] faith is impossible to please God the
[1:23:46] only way we're getting it from God
[1:23:53] is e
[1:24:36] by your National Spirits by your tribal
[1:24:38] Spirits none of that is the unity of the
[1:24:41] holy spirit in the people me United with
[1:24:45] the Holy Spirit you United with the Holy
[1:24:48] Spirit and we unite
[1:24:50] together in the Church of the Living God
[1:24:53] waiting for the holy Spirit to unite all
[1:24:56] of us together with the faith can you
[1:24:58] say
[1:25:04] Amen in un of the
[1:25:09] spirit a Unity brought about by the Holy
[1:25:12] Spirit to come into one mind one Accord
[1:25:16] like they had on the day of P when the
[1:25:19] day of Pentecost was fully come they
[1:25:21] were all not some all
[1:25:25] with one mind and one
[1:25:28] Accord Unity of the
[1:25:36] spirit a Unity of the spirit a Unity
[1:25:38] brought about by the Holy
[1:25:40] Spirit to love one another above
[1:25:44] everything else no divisions no schisms
[1:25:47] just pure plain brotherly and sisterly
[1:25:50] love like brother Isaac was exting us
[1:25:53] this morning just your PL Holy Ghost
[1:25:55] love not lovey doy you know the mistake
[1:25:58] we make many times when we talk about
[1:26:03] love because we are human beings we have
[1:26:07] love and sometimes we don't even have
[1:26:10] the love we claim to have so when we
[1:26:12] talk about the love of God we see God
[1:26:15] like that like God has love when you say
[1:26:17] God loves me we see that God has Love
[1:26:21] sometimes he exhibits it sometimes he
[1:26:23] doesn't but no
[1:26:25] the Bible says the essence of God is
[1:26:29] love you are not the Bible didn't say
[1:26:32] for you are love but he say God is
[1:26:37] love in other words everything God does
[1:26:40] that's love speaking when love corrects
[1:26:43] that's God speaking when God corrects
[1:26:46] when God rebukes when God does whatever

[1:30:46] that the unity of the spirit will
[1:30:47] address and set
[1:30:50] right is praying bless every
[1:30:53] organization in the valley all the
[1:30:55] Blessed people the ministers and the
[1:30:57] pastors of the different
[1:31:00] denominations maybe we might dis agree
[1:31:02] upon some theological
[1:31:04] teachings of the scripture but
[1:31:07] further in all one principle be we
[1:31:11] believe in God the Eternal one that
[1:31:14] those of us who make like we know more
[1:31:16] than the
[1:31:17] prophet and we must maintain the status
[1:31:20] quo they don't belong in our group so we
[1:31:23] have nothing to to do with that group
[1:31:25] this is the prophet that brought the
[1:31:26] word this is the prophet I tell people a
[1:31:28] prophet has been in the land you may be
[1:31:31] seated I see I see my time is gone and I
[1:31:34] I I I haven't even got started yet
[1:31:41] really no brother Isaac Sunday afternoon
[1:31:43] is coming Sunday afternoon is coming no
[1:31:47] I'll try to I'll try to I'll try not to
[1:31:48] hold you too long so um um
[1:31:55] so Unity of the
[1:31:57] spirit is going to address Stu is going
[1:32:00] to correct conditions is going to is the
[1:32:02] phys great physician in the room to heal
[1:32:05] the sickness in the body that's the
[1:32:08] purpose of the unity of the spirit and
[1:32:10] what this Prophet here begin to tell you
[1:32:12] the things that the unity of the spirit
[1:32:14] was addressed and correct and set right
[1:32:17] bless every organization in the valley
[1:32:19] all the Blessed people the ministers and
[1:32:21] pastors of different denominations
[1:32:24] maybe we might disagree upon some
[1:32:25] theological teachings of the scripture
[1:32:27] but father all in one principle we
[1:32:29] believe in God the Eternal one so help
[1:32:32] us
[1:32:34] Lord in all these divisions help us
[1:32:38] Lord to have Unity of the spirit until
[1:32:43] until Unity of the faith is brought
[1:32:46] forth in the midst of the divisions in
[1:32:49] the midst of the differences let us have
[1:32:51] Unity of the spirit until the the unity
[1:32:54] of the faith is brought forth thus said
[1:32:56] Malachi for the prophet
[1:33:03] [Applause]
[1:33:19] amen and when the angel of the faith is
[1:33:22] brought forth
[1:33:24] when we shall see him face to face then
[1:33:27] then then we will see eye to
[1:33:35] eye but presently while keeping the
[1:33:38] unity of the spirit we may not see eye
[1:33:41] to
[1:33:43] eye does that justify the scattering the
[1:33:47] sickness in the body being
[1:33:51] maintained no I know you don't believe
[1:33:53] me but I'll I'll show
[1:34:03] you until that
[1:34:06] time
[1:34:08] until the UN of the faith is brought
[1:34:11] forth May the Holy Spirit bless us in
[1:34:15] our efforts that we put forth for we ask
[1:34:19] it in Jesus
[1:34:20] name amen can all the people say
[1:34:24] Amen all the effort we are putting forth
[1:34:27] to keep to keep to maintain the unity of
[1:34:30] the spirit while we are waiting for the
[1:34:33] angel of the
[1:34:38] faith I've got another quote you may be
[1:34:41] se you may be
[1:34:45] [Applause]
[1:34:49] seated the power of
[1:34:52] transformation October 3
[1:34:54] 1965 and to think that you can come
[1:34:57] apart and gather like this whereas the
[1:35:00] psalmist said behold how sweet and
[1:35:03] pleasant for Brethren to dwell together
[1:35:05] in unity is like the anointing all that
[1:35:07] was on Aaron's Beed that run to the hems
[1:35:10] of his garments which that anointing all
[1:35:12] which you know what the anointing all
[1:35:14] done it preserved him to go in the
[1:35:17] presence of God see he had to be
[1:35:19] Anointed with that oil before he went in
[1:35:22] the presence of God and when
[1:35:25] when Brethren can dwell together in
[1:35:29] unity is unity of the spirit not Unity
[1:35:32] of your belief of your doctrine of your
[1:35:34] group Unity of the spirit I'll show
[1:35:45] you the unity that the spirit brings
[1:35:48] about
[1:35:58] and when Brethren can draw together in
[1:36:01] unity is liken unto that oil the oil of
[1:36:06] the Holy Spirit when bre can DW together
[1:36:08] in unity that's the Holy Spirit there
[1:36:10] because the holy spirit is the one that
[1:36:12] can bring unity in spite of your
[1:36:14] disagreements that's why it takes the
[1:36:16] Holy
[1:36:19] Spirit if you don't disagree and there's
[1:36:21] a Unity big deal
[1:36:37] we then enter when we gather together in
[1:36:40] unity we then enter into the presence of
[1:36:42] the Lord with that anointing of Brethren
[1:36:46] together in unity oil represents the
[1:36:49] Holy Spirit and there you have it
[1:36:51] friends the unity of the spirit
[1:36:54] is Brethren dwelling together in unity I
[1:36:58] just read you quot from theam you want
[1:37:01] some more no let me go
[1:37:04] on
[1:37:06] amen glory glory glory you are getting
[1:37:09] the drift right you may be seated
[1:37:13] amen but let me go on let me let me let
[1:37:15] you you I gave you enough quotes you can
[1:37:18] go s them some more yourself
[1:37:27] so what does this mean the unity of the
[1:37:29] spirit before the unity of the faith
[1:37:31] let's try and break it down it means
[1:37:34] before God can send the Holy Spirit the
[1:37:40] Dynamics like on the day of Pentecost
[1:37:43] when the day of Pentecost was fully come
[1:37:46] they were
[1:37:47] all in the unity of the spirit all in
[1:37:52] one mind and one Accord
[1:37:55] not The Bishop's mind not the bosses
[1:37:58] mind not the pastor mind not the deons
[1:38:01] mind the man of God the intelligence the
[1:38:04] Holy
[1:38:09] [Applause]
[1:38:10] Ghost the Ang of the spirit before the
[1:38:13] of the faith it means before God can
[1:38:14] send the Holy Spirit into our midst to
[1:38:17] anoint the word into
[1:38:19] flesh we must
[1:38:21] keep the Ang of the spirit
[1:38:24] and maintain the unity of the spirit in
[1:38:27] spite of
[1:38:30] differences you and your wife have
[1:38:32] differences right but you keep the home
[1:38:36] something like that somebody getting a
[1:38:39] revelation you and your wife have
[1:38:41] differences you don't say no I I
[1:38:43] separate I draw a circle I don't want
[1:38:44] anything to do my wife you still try to
[1:38:46] keep the unity in the home can somebody
[1:38:49] say Amen am can somebody say I can hear
[1:38:52] you can somebody say Amen am
[1:38:56] amen oh no we we this is what I believe
[1:39:00] I don't believe like them I don't want
[1:39:01] to do with them no you are missing the
[1:39:06] point a prophet has been in the land you
[1:39:09] may be seated you may be
[1:39:15] seated so keeping the unity of the
[1:39:17] spirit you may be see I want to hear
[1:39:18] this real good I want to hear this real
[1:39:20] good keeping the UN of the spirit what
[1:39:22] does it mean it mean means getting into
[1:39:24] one
[1:39:28] mind it means to keep an all these all
[1:39:32] these things are from the quotes I read
[1:39:33] to you I'm not making them up or my own
[1:39:38] deductions from the scriptures no from
[1:39:40] the quote I read to
[1:39:42] you keeping keeping the unity of the
[1:39:44] spirit in the bond of Peace Paul
[1:39:48] Ephesians 4:3 Malachi 4
[1:39:54] keeping of the spirit means get to one
[1:39:56] man and one Accord it means to keep an
[1:39:58] old fashioned prayer meeting constantly
[1:40:00] going on it means to keep looking up
[1:40:03] watching for the coming of the Lord it
[1:40:06] means to keep all wildness out of you
[1:40:09] amen like brother gon was talking to us
[1:40:11] yesterday it means to receive the
[1:40:13] circumcision of the Holy Ghost to keep
[1:40:16] worldliness lost filth out of your life
[1:40:18] young man young woman you will never
[1:40:20] overcome lost lust has been overcome
[1:40:22] already you don't have to struggle come
[1:40:26] to the
[1:40:26] Fountain he that is is that you thir let
[1:40:30] him come and drink of the Water of Life
[1:40:32] freely and he will baptize you with the
[1:40:34] Holy Ghost instantly the desire leaves
[1:40:37] you Satan will still tempt you but you
[1:40:40] are not struggling anymore the power of
[1:40:42] the Holy Ghost is overshadowing
[1:40:46] you and you are cutting all the
[1:40:48] worldliness off cutting fatal sin
[1:40:51] cutting off not by struggle by the power
[1:40:54] of the Holy Ghost don't struggle when
[1:40:57] you struggle you drown get the Holy
[1:41:00] Ghost and the Holy Ghost is yet to get
[1:41:04] amen
[1:41:07] [Applause]
[1:41:11] amen keeping the unity of the spirit
[1:41:14] means receiving the setion of the Holy
[1:41:17] Ghost to keep worldliness lust filth out
[1:41:20] of your life so it's not an invitation
[1:41:23] to struggle like who said I just love my
[1:41:25] brother I just love that's lovey doy
[1:41:28] love everybody here love everybody here
[1:41:31] and love and sin is all over ravaging
[1:41:34] the lives of the people because I want
[1:41:36] to keep the unity of the spirit I just
[1:41:39] love I just
[1:41:46] love no it's not an invitation to
[1:41:48] struggle against sin rather keeping the
[1:41:51] of the spirit is an invitation to
[1:41:54] receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:41:56] that can circumcise your heart from
[1:41:59] every ungodliness every fi every
[1:42:01] debauchery clean you
[1:42:04] out
[1:42:06] amen keeping the unity of the spirit
[1:42:08] means a time for the power of the Holy
[1:42:10] Ghost from the prophet all these quotes
[1:42:12] I read it means a time for the power of
[1:42:15] the Holy Ghost into the church to heal
[1:42:18] the severe sickness in the body of Jesus
[1:42:21] Christ his church
[1:42:24] and what is this sickness he told you
[1:42:27] horrible sickness he said he severely
[1:42:30] sick what is his
[1:42:33] sickness divisions broken relationships
[1:42:37] a lack of love and unity in the
[1:42:45] church keeping keeping the unity of the
[1:42:48] spirit also means displaying wisdom and
[1:42:51] maturity
[1:42:53] to manage our disagreements in
[1:42:56] Doctrine as well as as as our
[1:42:58] disagreements in other areas of our
[1:43:00] various
[1:43:02] interactions if you and your
[1:43:04] wife do not manage your disagreements
[1:43:07] you will not have a
[1:43:09] marriage and don't tell me you don't
[1:43:10] have disagreement with your wife because
[1:43:12] you are telling a
[1:43:13] lie or with your husband but is managing
[1:43:17] those disagreements that's what keeps
[1:43:18] the home together so same way keep keep
[1:43:21] keep the home by managing those
[1:43:22] agreements the unity of the spirit keep
[1:43:24] these disagreements keep wisdom and
[1:43:27] maturity to manage these disagreements
[1:43:29] so we can keep the unity of the spirit
[1:43:33] [Applause]
[1:43:40] Hallelujah keeping the in of the spirit
[1:43:42] also means to learn if you don't have it
[1:43:46] to learn the
[1:43:48] wisdom and
[1:43:51] maturity that can display the the
[1:43:53] principle of agreeing to
[1:43:58] disagree Lord help
[1:44:01] me when you understand this then you'll
[1:44:05] understand what it means can two work
[1:44:07] together except they agree we always put
[1:44:09] that to everything else when want to do
[1:44:10] all these separations two can't work
[1:44:12] except they agree oil and water cannot
[1:44:14] mix and all that stuff but when it comes
[1:44:16] to you and your wife even though you
[1:44:17] disagree you find a way you are not oil
[1:44:20] and water
[1:44:24] is somebody hearing me is all
[1:44:27] foolishness utter
[1:44:32] [Music]
[1:44:36] foolishness this is the
[1:44:39] prophet but we have so many small
[1:44:41] prophets Among Us so many small
[1:44:50] prophets wisdom and maturity if you
[1:44:52] don't have it don't say I have it no you
[1:44:55] can get wisdom you can learn
[1:45:00] wisdom wisdom and
[1:45:05] maturity that you can display the
[1:45:09] principle what it means to agree to
[1:45:11] disagree when you understand this
[1:45:15] principle then you'll come to understand
[1:45:17] at a much deeper level The Wider
[1:45:20] implications of the scripture can two
[1:45:23] work together except they
[1:45:29] agree those in the world and even in
[1:45:31] many places in Christianity Today who
[1:45:33] get a divorce is because they never
[1:45:35] understood that you have to agree to
[1:45:38] disagree to keep the unity in your
[1:45:42] home is so say my way or the
[1:45:46] highway then they go to get a divorce or
[1:45:51] like maybe me they stay in the home
[1:45:53] together but there are two Nations
[1:45:55] living in the
[1:45:59] home because they don't understand that
[1:46:01] two can work together even with their
[1:46:04] disagreements just by simply
[1:46:06] understanding how to agree to
[1:46:11] disagree I am the head of this home what
[1:46:14] I do stays if you don't take is
[1:46:19] foolishness utter foolishness
[1:46:23] did your master do that with you
[1:46:26] husbands love your wives as Christ loved
[1:46:29] the church your husband came to you and
[1:46:31] said you must receive me as your lord
[1:46:33] and savior or else he didn't do that
[1:46:36] free moral
[1:46:38] agency to be or not to be he let you be
[1:46:44] let your wife be let your husband be let
[1:46:47] that Pastor be let that church be let
[1:46:50] that believer be they don't have to be
[1:46:52] like
[1:46:54] [Applause]
[1:47:04] you your wife don't have to be like you
[1:47:07] that's not what it means to be the head
[1:47:08] of the home is the unity of the
[1:47:11] spirit what does the spirit
[1:47:18] say I'm sure you get the
[1:47:20] drift amen amen
[1:47:31] keeping the unity of the spirit
[1:47:35] means Brethren dwelling together in
[1:47:38] unity right Unity of the spirit because
[1:47:42] they understand how to work together in
[1:47:46] disagreement just like a husband and
[1:47:49] wife by agreeing to this
[1:47:55] disagree if you don't understand that
[1:47:57] you will never come into Unity the unity
[1:48:00] of the spirit now let's bring all this
[1:48:01] together let's bring all this home you
[1:48:02] may be see it let's bring all this home
[1:48:04] as I'm trying to find a place to wind
[1:48:05] wind down I didn't say I'm finishing I'm
[1:48:08] trying to find a place to wind down
[1:48:11] okay now I've only spoken one hour I've
[1:48:14] only spoken one
[1:48:16] [Music]
[1:48:18] hour I I've only spoken one hour so you
[1:48:21] may be seated I want you to get this
[1:48:24] let's bring this home let's bring this
[1:48:25] home to you and I to each one of us to
[1:48:27] the smallest child in the room to the
[1:48:30] oldest person in the
[1:48:32] room in Genesis
[1:48:34] 2 God said it is not good for the man to
[1:48:37] be alone and let me put a caveat here
[1:48:41] because brother Gideon said said
[1:48:42] yesterday you got to walk with God alone
[1:48:44] and somebody said that's why I said
[1:48:45] don't hear what I'm not saying somebody
[1:48:46] say that brother U is saying something
[1:48:48] against whaton said no I'm saying the
[1:48:50] same thing exactly so listen at a deeper
[1:48:54] level to hear what I'm saying all right
[1:48:57] don't just grab the words that's like
[1:48:59] you become like
[1:49:01] chpt who just like a sarcastic
[1:49:03] Pirro just he
[1:49:07] just it doesn't have enough sense yet to
[1:49:10] think and reason the
[1:49:12] way in that in that scripture it is not
[1:49:14] good for the man to be alone lays the
[1:49:17] origin of all human
[1:49:20] associations marriage
[1:49:24] families
[1:49:25] friends
[1:49:27] towns cities countries the association
[1:49:31] together
[1:49:32] communities clubs societies
[1:49:36] unions in that verse it is not good for
[1:49:40] the
[1:49:40] man humankind to be
[1:49:46] alone but I will make him a wife for him
[1:49:49] no he didn't say that I will make him an
[1:49:52] help meat for him in the institution of
[1:49:56] marriage the help meat is the spouse the
[1:49:59] husband or the wife but these other
[1:50:02] institutions they are there to help you
[1:50:05] that's why if you're in a group you can
[1:50:07] say is this helping me or not it's not
[1:50:10] helping you know you are in a wrong
[1:50:11] Association get out of it because the
[1:50:14] very origin of associations in the Bible
[1:50:17] is to be a help to you a help that meets
[1:50:20] your needs
[1:50:25] so if you the boys and the girls in
[1:50:27] school and they make you do wrong things
[1:50:30] that don't help you get away from
[1:50:33] [Applause]
[1:50:36] [Music]
[1:50:38] there because God said it is not good
[1:50:41] for man to be
[1:50:44] alone it needs to interact men need to
[1:50:47] interact with other
[1:50:50] humans because in those interactions
[1:50:53] is
[1:50:54] heeding man's maturity and
[1:50:57] growth without those interactions man
[1:51:00] will not mature he will not grow as good
[1:51:05] as well as God determined that he could
[1:51:07] and should
[1:51:10] be is not Unity with yourself alone it's
[1:51:13] Unity of the
[1:51:18] spirit and that's
[1:51:20] why when you have children that that
[1:51:23] maybe there an only child a husband and
[1:51:25] wife have only one child those children
[1:51:28] be managed in a certain way or they will
[1:51:31] just come up with VI because they don't
[1:51:33] have other kids to learn from to
[1:51:37] interact
[1:51:39] with and those parents need to
[1:51:41] understand need to have this child or
[1:51:43] that child grows up feeling so entitled
[1:51:46] that child gets a feeling so spoed or
[1:51:48] that child just ends up not properly
[1:51:50] built up in their character
[1:51:53] because they didn't have other other
[1:51:55] other humans of their IL of their age of
[1:51:58] their Community to interrup
[1:52:04] with so without the interaction with
[1:52:07] other human beings you will not grow you
[1:52:10] not mature as God determined you
[1:52:13] should if you have an anger problem how
[1:52:16] you going to know it if you're just by
[1:52:18] yourself
[1:52:21] alone you're not going to know you get
[1:52:23] angry
[1:52:27] unnecessarily but when your wife talks
[1:52:29] to you and just get angry then the Holy
[1:52:31] Spirit tells
[1:52:33] you I don't want you to do that that's
[1:52:36] wrong and then you feel like that okay
[1:52:38] Lord I'm so
[1:52:40] sorry and what is it you just becoming a
[1:52:42] better person because you are getting
[1:52:44] United with the
[1:52:46] spirit what he wants if you all by
[1:52:49] yourself you'll be brutish raw evil you
[1:52:52] think you are the most perfect human
[1:52:53] being on the face of the Earth so other
[1:52:55] people around you expose you or inspire
[1:52:59] [Applause]
[1:53:09] you man it is not good for him to be
[1:53:12] alone because man needs other men around
[1:53:14] him so he can become his better and best
[1:53:18] self because reality is we learn to
[1:53:22] become human from one another we learn
[1:53:25] to become human beings from one another
[1:53:27] how many of you have learned something
[1:53:29] just from watching other people I'm
[1:53:31] talking about good things now you can
[1:53:32] learn negative things and many of those
[1:53:35] you will never learn if you are just in
[1:53:36] your own private corner
[1:53:49] alone because we learn to become human
[1:53:52] from one another only Adam learned to
[1:53:56] become human all alone by himself and
[1:53:59] that's why God saw that no man needs
[1:54:02] other people firstly I get Adam a
[1:54:06] wife to help him to be a better
[1:54:09] person that's what your wife is there
[1:54:11] for not like she's she's she's ah this
[1:54:14] woman is stressing my
[1:54:17] life this woman I made a mistake getting
[1:54:20] her
[1:54:22] coming keeping the unity of the faith
[1:54:25] and that's how you keep it amen amen can
[1:54:28] you say
[1:54:29] Amen
[1:54:33] GL we learn we learn to become human
[1:54:38] from one another I learn from you you
[1:54:40] learn from me because the same only Adam
[1:54:43] learned to become human all by himself
[1:54:46] but the rest of us we are who we are
[1:54:49] because of who we all are
[1:54:53] I am who I am because of who we all
[1:54:58] are because we learn from one another we
[1:55:01] help one another to
[1:55:06] grow that's how God determined it that's
[1:55:08] how God planned
[1:55:11] itall so you need people around you or
[1:55:14] you'll never come to the unity of the
[1:55:17] spirit you need husbands wives you need
[1:55:21] nice husbands
[1:55:23] nice wives you need not so nice husbands
[1:55:26] not so nice wives around you to help you
[1:55:29] become a better human being you need
[1:55:31] good people you need bad people around
[1:55:33] you too to help you become a better
[1:55:35] human being somebody so evil and nasty
[1:55:38] you just say uh-uh this is not the way
[1:55:40] to go that's not what we were taught in
[1:55:41] church no I won't be like that that
[1:55:43] person has added to your
[1:55:45] life because they are showing you how
[1:55:47] not to be how not to live can you say
[1:55:50] amen amen
[1:55:53] the pastor gave me permission to say
[1:55:54] these things amen you may be
[1:55:59] seated so you need people you need
[1:56:03] people who love you you need people who
[1:56:05] cannot stand you people who hate you
[1:56:07] let's put the word who hatte you you
[1:56:09] need them
[1:56:10] too you need people who see the good in
[1:56:13] all that you try to do you need you need
[1:56:16] people who don't see any good at all in
[1:56:19] you you need people who are easy to get
[1:56:21] along with with you need people who are
[1:56:24] difficult to get along
[1:56:26] [Applause]

[1:56:41] person
[1:56:42] anymore great but let them help you be a
[1:56:46] better
[1:56:47] person if the person is so evil you

[1:56:56] not descend to that
[1:56:58] law not because you condemning that
[1:57:01] person but you want to be a better
[1:57:02] person that's why when they brought that
[1:57:04] woman caught in the very Act of adul to
[1:57:06] Jesus God the god of love because he
[1:57:09] condone sin no he was love love corrects
[1:57:13] the sin love delivers love sets free
[1:57:16] love doesn't kill they got
[1:57:18] her what he said she've done to her the
[1:57:21] Lord heiller he said he that is without
[1:57:25] sin Let Him cast the frost Stone have
[1:57:28] you learned from This Woman's life so
[1:57:31] you not fall into the same thing again
[1:57:35] yourself so he began to write on the
[1:57:38] ground we don't know what he wrote but
[1:57:40] maybe was writing their sins maybe was
[1:57:42] writing some of them there who had gone
[1:57:45] to sleep with that woman forgive the
[1:57:47] expression some of these religious
[1:57:49] leaders who have slept with that woman
[1:57:52] because she won't talk because she was
[1:57:54] abused and you can't bring those things
[1:57:56] out easily he said right in the ground
[1:57:59] and they saw it they ran
[1:58:02] away and when they were all
[1:58:04] gone
[1:58:07] Jesus the father with his daughter alone
[1:58:12] his daughter who was messed up by sin
[1:58:15] and disease and de
[1:58:18] buty he'll knelt down by her side Jesus
[1:58:21] was having having a father daughter
[1:58:23] relationship with that woman he was
[1:58:25] having a father daughter moment he knelt
[1:58:27] down by her side and said daughter where
[1:58:30] are your
[1:58:31] accusers she said no man here Lord he
[1:58:35] said neither do I condemn you go and sin
[1:58:38] no more the love of God the love of
[1:58:43] God the love of
[1:58:47] God if it was you and I we would say

[2:05:32] demoniac of gadara a man who had Legions
[2:05:35] of demons what was it about Jesus that

[2:05:52] overwhelming him he was a demon he was
[2:05:55] backsliding he was
[2:05:57] evil but he say he ran to
[2:06:01] Jesus what was it about Jesus that that
[2:06:04] man knew he will not be cast out but he
[2:06:06] will be received with open arms with all
[2:06:10] his
[2:06:12] demons and when he came to Jesus Jesus
[2:06:15] spoke not to the man spoke to the
[2:06:19] Devils get out of him

[2:07:45] [Applause]
[2:07:48] times and Jesus said this day zakus
[2:07:53] salvation Deliverance has come to your
[2:07:56] house because there was a lord Jesus
[2:07:58] Christ there who knew how to speak the
[2:08:00] truth but in love he was the love of God
[2:08:04] all rich and pure how measureless how
[2:08:06] strong riching out to his children who
[2:08:08] are messed up who are bound in sin and
[2:08:10] sickness disease and all that and

[2:08:25] Glory so it's not like we let people
[2:08:28] live lower than they should live no we
[2:08:30] don't spare one another we don't let
[2:08:32] anyone live a life lower than their
[2:08:34] optimal best that's why we're there for
[2:08:35] one another we speak the truth in love
[2:08:39] we speak the truth in a way that sets
[2:08:41] free that's how love does it we Mentor
[2:08:44] one another we help one another we lift
[2:08:47] one another up because again I say
[2:08:52] it is not good for man for the man to be
[2:08:55] alone and I am who I am because of who
[2:08:58] we all are so friends in coming to one
[2:09:01] man and one
[2:09:02] Accord we all we have all got to
[2:09:04] understand and realize this very
[2:09:06] important reality you may be see that as
[2:09:08] I'm really trying to find a place to
[2:09:09] close
[2:09:20] here we got understand this very
[2:09:22] important reality what is the reality in
[2:09:25] every relationship whether it's personal
[2:09:28] you and your wife you and your son you
[2:09:30] and your daughter every relationship
[2:09:32] whether it's personal whether it's
[2:09:33] individual whether it's a group
[2:09:35] relationship in church in at work
[2:09:38] wherever there are always divisive
[2:09:40] influences there are always Tendencies
[2:09:43] things that tend to divide us there are
[2:09:44] always disagreements that can scatter us
[2:09:46] apart always they will always be there
[2:09:58] but in the midst of these disagreements
[2:10:01] different opinions under those
[2:10:04] circumstances it'll be very easy to turn
[2:10:07] on one another and go a separate ways
[2:10:10] each one sticking to his guns each one
[2:10:11] is so convinced their way is right my
[2:10:14] way of the highway especially in the mar
[2:10:16] relationship with the men with
[2:10:18] Nigerians we Nigerians are like that I'm
[2:10:21] I'm a husband too I'm talking
[2:10:27] myself where the head of the home I
[2:10:29] don't we don't understand in this home
[2:10:31] here is that how Jesus handles
[2:10:34] you husbands love your wives as Christ
[2:10:38] love the church when you make a mistake
[2:10:39] it cast you out no if you really are
[2:10:42] walking with God like brother brother G
[2:10:44] today he'll speak to you he speaks to
[2:10:47] you and talks to you a long last narrow
[2:10:48] way he tell that son you can do better
[2:10:50] I'll help you next next time you felt
[2:10:53] that way because you did not depend on
[2:10:54] me you are trusting the arm of Flesh
[2:10:56] just stay close to me and I'll help you
[2:10:58] stay close to me like you had on
[2:10:59] Saturday afternoon and I'll help
[2:11:02] you he bangs your head and like you
[2:11:04] scream at the wife and maybe the wife
[2:11:06] screams at The Horseman or scream at the
[2:11:09] children or the scre scream at one
[2:11:10] another or the pastor screams at the
[2:11:12] church or the church screams at the
[2:11:19] pastor in every relationship spiritual
[2:11:23] natural there are always things that
[2:11:25] tend to divide
[2:11:26] us and we very easy under those
[2:11:28] circumstances to turn on one
[2:11:30] another but rather than allow these
[2:11:32] situations to divide and and separate us
[2:11:35] from one another we should use them
[2:11:37] rather to
[2:11:39] learn about one another instead
[2:11:43] am and the Christian Life and John is
[2:11:46] all about learning Jesus came with the
[2:11:49] message of redemption he said come andar
[2:11:51] learn of me he didn't say come and get
[2:11:53] rid of your sins no come and learn of me
[2:11:55] you learn about salvation learn about
[2:11:57] sanctification learn about the Bap learn
[2:11:59] learn learn because in learning is is
[2:12:03] hidden your growth into maturity if you
[2:12:06] don't learn you're not
[2:12:07] growing there are people who are aging
[2:12:10] and haven't learned a thing in the past
[2:12:11] 20 years they're just growing older in
[2:12:14] years but they're not growing in their
[2:12:16] wisdom and maturity
[2:12:21] there are those of us who say I never
[2:12:24] take back what I said on the pulpit that
[2:12:26] was God speaking to me oh
[2:12:32] yeah my time is gone so I don't I don't
[2:12:34] have time to give a personal testimony
[2:12:36] about brother
[2:12:40] Bram so rather than allow these
[2:12:42] situations to divide and separate us
[2:12:44] from one another learning us from each
[2:12:46] other we should use them to learn
[2:12:49] instead learn about con sitation for
[2:12:51] other
[2:12:52] people learn to understand where the
[2:12:54] other person is coming from why they
[2:12:56] hold strong to their views like
[2:12:58] that learn about their world view even
[2:13:01] though they be wrong learn about that
[2:13:03] people can be wrong like that so it just
[2:13:04] gives you more capacity to manage those
[2:13:07] who are wrong and sing to their wrong
[2:13:09] guns like
[2:13:11] that who knows Jesus might be sending
[2:13:14] them to you like the Demonic of gadara
[2:13:17] so you can cast the spirit out of them
[2:13:18] by speaking the
[2:13:20] truth in a way that sets
[2:13:28] free instead of letting those sitations
[2:13:30] divide and separate us seek to
[2:13:33] understand the other person you always
[2:13:35] say they don't understand me my husband
[2:13:39] doesn't understand me my wife doesn't
[2:13:40] understand me the pastor doesn't
[2:13:42] understand me I get it I get it but real
[2:13:45] wisdom and growth is not when people
[2:13:48] understand you when people seek to
[2:13:50] understand you they are the ones growing
[2:13:51] but when you seek to understand another
[2:13:54] why they so why they are so wound up
[2:13:57] like that and know said like that said
[2:14:00] like that a brother you mean him
[2:14:02] sometimes they said why do you go to
[2:14:05] these people who are so wound up like
[2:14:06] that he said brotherly
[2:14:10] kindness
[2:14:12] Faith virtue patience with
[2:14:16] him hoping
[2:14:18] someday virtue in yourself power in
[2:14:21] yourself to understand that he's living
[2:14:23] that way because it's in his heart like
[2:14:27] that who knows you might be able to set
[2:14:30] him
[2:14:31] free oh my I I got to run forgive me you
[2:14:34] get the drift I I know you got the
[2:14:38] drift so we seek to understand another
[2:14:41] why they are the way they
[2:14:43] are instead of letting this things
[2:14:45] separate us this is agreeing to
[2:14:48] disagree you learn about one another
[2:14:51] others likes and dislikes the needs and
[2:14:53] expectations you learn what your wife
[2:14:55] likes what she doesn't like why should
[2:14:57] she not like that she doesn't like
[2:15:00] it is that tough to
[2:15:04] understand it's not right for not to
[2:15:06] like it I get it but she doesn't like it
[2:15:09] because you have no power from God to
[2:15:11] control her to like what you like not
[2:15:14] even your little child not even your
[2:15:16] little child God didn't give her that
[2:15:18] kind of control the only thing that has
[2:15:20] control about is the Holy
[2:15:25] Spirit the three-fold mystery right God
[2:15:29] in control over Christ Christ in control
[2:15:31] over the bride the bride in control over
[2:15:33] the earth going down to Eden not over
[2:15:35] another human
[2:15:39] being and when you find out what their
[2:15:41] needs and their weaknesses
[2:15:44] are that's where your own growth is is
[2:15:46] hidden you seek to help them with these
[2:15:50] needs as much as you are able to that
[2:15:53] way our circumstances our divisions
[2:15:56] agreements instead of dividing elating
[2:15:59] us will rather unite us and bring us
[2:16:02] into one mind and one Accord in the bond
[2:16:04] of
[2:16:05] Peace many of us have one man and one
[2:16:08] Accord in the bond
[2:16:11] of hatred people people hate they obey
[2:16:14] young people in ch they obey but they
[2:16:17] hate the ground on which you are
[2:16:19] standing on
[2:16:24] even wives
[2:16:25] husbands the man is just a a what you
[2:16:28] call now Iron Fist in the home Iron Fist
[2:16:32] and when he comes everybody runs into
[2:16:34] their rooms everybody runs into their
[2:16:37] rooms that's a dysfunctional
[2:16:40] home everybody runs to their home
[2:16:43] because the lord of the mayor has come
[2:16:45] home the mayor has come to
[2:16:49] town forgive me Nigerians I
[2:16:53] mean where where where I'm talking to
[2:16:55] Home Folks forgive me you will love me
[2:16:58] after this I know I know you love me
[2:17:00] because we're talking angel of the
[2:17:01] [Applause]
[2:17:05] spirit I I'm not stepping on your toes
[2:17:07] am I brother is am I stepping on their
[2:17:09] toes all
[2:17:19] right Hallelujah
[2:17:26] Unity of the spirit in the bond of peace
[2:17:29] knowing the B of everybody keep to their
[2:17:31] corner but of peace peace peace like a
[2:17:34] river in the home all it doesn't mean
[2:17:36] you will not have disagreements it
[2:17:37] doesn't mean you have troubles in the
[2:17:38] church do that mean you have people who
[2:17:39] have bullheads in the church no but it
[2:17:41] don't handle a bullhead and then it
[2:17:43] becomes like an issue big issue that's
[2:17:44] affecting the whole church that's not
[2:17:47] wisdom that's not wisdom Jesus had a a
[2:17:51] devil among his disciples he managed him
[2:17:55] such a way when he told them when he
[2:17:57] told him like uh what th doest do
[2:17:59] quickly when he said one of you will
[2:18:02] betray me today they looked around they
[2:18:04] did not know who it was till when when
[2:18:07] when they said is it I is it is it I
[2:18:08] when Judas got up and went he said what
[2:18:12] that do do quickly they did not believe
[2:18:14] because that same man was Jesus's
[2:18:16] treasurer
[2:18:20] [Applause]
[2:18:26] Jesus managed that man whole P
[2:18:30] someday but he was a devil a child of
[2:18:33] predition so there was no change in him
[2:18:35] but Jesus gave him all the chance but
[2:18:38] just such a way he don't even know at
[2:18:41] all that Judas was that kind of a person
[2:18:44] Jesus helped the man to save face
[2:18:50] some of us preachers in Church parents
[2:18:53] are there with their children we are
[2:18:55] blasting the father blasting the mother
[2:18:58] blasting the father blessing the mother
[2:19:00] in the presence of their
[2:19:02] children we are belittling them in the
[2:19:05] presence of their children like your
[2:19:07] children like your children I'm not
[2:19:10] saying not the correct I'm not saying
[2:19:12] not the correct look through the salmon
[2:19:14] books they 1,000 Oro of them and brother
[2:19:18] bam did anything like that
[2:19:21] in the
[2:19:22] Tabernacle or anywhere on the street he
[2:19:25] he rebuked sin but he never got
[2:19:28] personal all of those things he did
[2:19:30] behind closed doors and then we wonder
[2:19:33] why some of these children leave church
[2:19:35] because they've seen their fathers and
[2:19:36] mothers who they idolize who they look
[2:19:39] up to they see them
[2:19:41] reduced by the authorities in the church
[2:19:43] and we present God the way he is not do
[2:19:47] you know why Moses did not go to the
[2:19:48] promised land
[2:19:54] Moses the man who was more Meek than all
[2:19:58] the men on the face of the Earth you
[2:20:00] know why he not go to the promised
[2:20:04] land because he showed God because he
[2:20:07] represented God to those people God said
[2:20:10] you will represent me and will be your
[2:20:12] mouthpiece and we on the pro represent
[2:20:15] God to the
[2:20:19] people and the young man without
[2:20:21] Revelation How We Do Is How They see the
[2:20:24] message how they see brother Bram how
[2:20:26] they see Jesus
[2:20:29] Christ don't hear what I'm not say not
[2:20:31] saying don't rebuke sin brother bam did
[2:20:34] plenty but he never got personal he
[2:20:37] never dehumanized he did it the way
[2:20:39] Jesus did for zakus the thief the
[2:20:43] robber so zakus come down
[2:20:47] Amos soop in your house today
[2:20:50] in other words that going to have a
[2:20:52] convention over dinner I want to talk to
[2:20:55] you privately do that stop disgracing
[2:20:58] parents the children and those children
[2:20:59] get beaten and
[2:21:07] [Applause]
[2:21:09] blue that was the time me let me say
[2:21:16] this let me see the many let me see let
[2:21:19] me tell you one
[2:21:21] there's this young man who took a phone
[2:21:23] call for his
[2:21:25] dad and while he was putting the phone
[2:21:29] down and for his dad to pick the call he
[2:21:31] took the call in another room to be sure
[2:21:33] his dad was on the phone and he saw the
[2:21:34] person on the other line busting his dad
[2:21:38] like that and he said after the call
[2:21:40] said Daddy is that how that person talks
[2:21:42] to
[2:21:43] you either I talk to you I don't I want
[2:21:46] none of this and he walked out walked
[2:21:49] out I don't want if that is Christianity
[2:21:50] don't want it
[2:21:52] Moses the great prophet
[2:21:55] Moses Meek More Meek than any man on the
[2:21:59] face of the of the Earth the one who God
[2:22:01] said I speak Moses from lip to
[2:22:03] air Moses showed God as angry when God
[2:22:07] wasn't angry that was it that was
[2:22:12] it Moses did not womanized he not commit
[2:22:15] adultery he not fornicate he did not
[2:22:19] worship idols no Moses was so close to
[2:22:21] God he told God God we can't do it that
[2:22:23] way remember your holy name and then God
[2:22:24] said Moses you are right I'll do the way
[2:22:26] you
[2:22:27] said and the people were were mad they
[2:22:31] wanted water they started curing God I
[2:22:33] told Moses it's not you they're talking
[2:22:35] to they're talking to me and God said
[2:22:37] they to him but Moses give them water
[2:22:40] take your rod and strike the rock once
[2:22:43] and Moes God's anger did not keep them
[2:22:46] from getting water Moos was still angry
[2:22:48] more Angry than God
[2:22:53] and he came on the pulpit and he got
[2:22:56] like you
[2:22:58] rebels calling the people
[2:23:01] names you rebels who did they rebel
[2:23:04] against he or
[2:23:06] God God they rebell against I said give
[2:23:08] them water you rebels must we we we pl
[2:23:13] God must we get you water from the rock
[2:23:16] bang bang he blasted he blasted he
[2:23:19] blasted and God said Moses you
[2:23:22] Dishonored me how many times do we
[2:23:23] dishonor god with anger and we're
[2:23:25] showing God as angry when he's
[2:23:28] not when the people sin they're not sin
[2:23:31] against you or me they're sin against
[2:23:32] the one that died for
[2:23:36] them and let's present it to them the
[2:23:39] wrong in the way that he will do the way
[2:23:42] he does when we sin and do wrong you
[2:23:44] don't have if you ever met the Christ of
[2:23:46] Calvary you won't do adultery
[2:23:48] fornication and all that but Sin is Sin
[2:23:52] he that's guilty he that's is that is
[2:23:54] that is that guilty of one is guilty of
[2:23:57] all don't say that one adultery
[2:23:59] committed me you are guilty as guilty as
[2:24:08] guilty Moses did not go in the promised
[2:24:11] land because of
[2:24:14] anger not that he want to be angry but
[2:24:17] he said be
[2:24:19] angry but sin not you know when you know
[2:24:22] when you when you you can get angry God
[2:24:24] was angry many times but when we are
[2:24:26] angry and sinning we say is my righteous
[2:24:29] anger
[2:24:32] no when your anger is such that the
[2:24:37] people what you remember more is your
[2:24:40] words of anger rather than the
[2:24:42] correction you are trying to bring forth
[2:24:44] you are sinning the voice of your
[2:24:47] emotions is draing out the correction
[2:24:50] Moses said must we get water from the
[2:24:52] rock bang bang what do you remember
[2:24:55] about that not so much the the water
[2:24:58] that came out of the rock but the fact
[2:24:59] that he BR the thing twice when Moses
[2:25:01] was angry and
[2:25:05] [Music]
[2:25:06] sinned is still got the miracle done
[2:25:09] like say yesterday p i mean ministers
[2:25:13] beat their wives and come the it and the
[2:25:15] anointing is falling Mo are the same
[2:25:17] thing
[2:25:20] he had seen that will came from the
[2:25:22] promised land yet he still had the
[2:25:24] Miracles he still had water come out of
[2:25:26] the
[2:25:40] rock I'm serious I I'll I'll I'll find a
[2:25:42] way to call off now and get
[2:25:47] out so when we leave this way
[2:25:51] trying to keep the unity of the spirit
[2:25:54] each one of us becomes more
[2:25:56] mature with every divisive influence
[2:25:58] that comes along when we step back and
[2:26:00] let the Holy Spirit speak to us how to
[2:26:03] handle the thing but many of us are
[2:26:04] quick on the trigger with fly off fly
[2:26:07] loose even those of us behind the
[2:26:15] pulpit
[2:26:17] maturity is character building
[2:26:24] maturity is growth building a character
[2:26:27] forming behavior in
[2:26:31] us and your
[2:26:33] behavior is what sets you up for
[2:26:37] adoption right your behavior while you
[2:26:41] are in the unity of the spirit keeping
[2:26:44] the in of the spirit is what sets you up
[2:26:45] for adoption God's watching until God
[2:26:49] can see
[2:26:51] Faith virtue knowledge Temperance
[2:26:54] patience
[2:26:55] Spirit Inspire not natural virtues but
[2:26:59] Spirit
[2:27:00] proven Spirit grown Spirit driven faith
[2:27:05] and virtue and knowledge and Temperance
[2:27:07] patience and godl and brotherly
[2:27:10] kindness God his wisdom with our growth
[2:27:14] into
[2:27:15] maturity inside those divisions these
[2:27:18] agreements in those home in the church
[2:27:22] don't waste the crisis don't waste the
[2:27:25] disagreement use it to
[2:27:27] grow you to help other people to grow
[2:27:31] too because friends we have to learn to
[2:27:34] live and work together we have to learn
[2:27:37] to get along as members of the same team
[2:27:41] which is the same body of Jesus
[2:27:43] Christ when you get together with other
[2:27:45] believers and other people that's where
[2:27:49] you get presented with opportunities to
[2:27:52] break down your own human spirit and
[2:27:56] align it with the spirit of
[2:27:57] Christ that's where you learn to put
[2:28:00] yourself in your brother's place on the
[2:28:02] matter that's where you learn to prefer
[2:28:05] one another in love that's where you
[2:28:07] learn what sacrifice is really all about
[2:28:10] that's where you learn to die out of
[2:28:12] yourself to self life your own interest
[2:28:15] your own
[2:28:16] things that's where you learn to deal
[2:28:18] with and manage difficult people people
[2:28:21] and difficult
[2:28:22] situations that's where you learn to
[2:28:24] grow and how you grow up into Christ in
[2:28:28] all things oh
[2:28:31] my
[2:28:34] [Applause]
[2:28:39] Hallelujah effective leadership in the
[2:28:41] chch in in the church should be about
[2:28:44] taking bring bringing the people to the
[2:28:47] unity of the spirit so that I can Pro
[2:28:50] the unity of the faith according to
[2:28:51] Ephesians 4 friends as I'm
[2:28:54] closing there's a pray of unity Among Us
[2:28:57] that's very serious very
[2:29:01] serious and it must be
[2:29:03] addressed and not just in Nigeria
[2:29:06] everywhere all over the world all over
[2:29:07] the world the people who brother Brown
[2:29:09] brought a message for that said the
[2:29:10] seven Thunders gathers the bright
[2:29:12] together have you really experienced
[2:29:14] that or he gathers us in our own little
[2:29:16] clicks
[2:29:17] together clicks
[2:29:21] and town unions in the messages in the
[2:29:24] message clicks and our own
[2:29:31] groups no before you say it's going to
[2:29:34] make me CH what I believe no I'm not
[2:29:35] saying that Unity of the spirit it's not
[2:29:38] about what you believe or you don't
[2:29:39] believe it's not Unity of your belief
[2:29:40] Unity of the
[2:29:43] spirit ready brother
[2:29:46] bham there's a problem of unity real
[2:29:48] problem of unity Among Us that's very
[2:29:49] serious
[2:29:50] and it must be addressed so that God can
[2:29:52] get the type of church he's looking for
[2:29:55] a church where you don't know your
[2:29:57] friends from your enemies as he was
[2:30:00] spoken of brother Branham like brother K
[2:30:02] I think was yesterday about the man who
[2:30:03] was trying to put a knife in brother
[2:30:05] bram's
[2:30:06] back and he I mean he was saying
[2:30:07] something about brother bam 1980 we I
[2:30:11] mean brother a and I had gone to the uh
[2:30:14] um the the um the spoken work
[2:30:16] publication at the time in Jeff and
[2:30:18] brother Roy borders was the editor of
[2:30:20] the spok books at the time and brother
[2:30:22] Ro Robertson was there too and brother
[2:30:24] Robertson was saying brother Bram and
[2:30:26] said brother Bram many times he goes to
[2:30:28] meeting and said God bless you what
[2:30:29] brother say yesterday people live

[2:30:39] my back and B will say he sees I say God
[2:30:42] bless
[2:30:43] you God bless you
[2:30:50] the ones who have a
[2:30:51] church where the difference between the
[2:30:53] Hales and they have not should not be
[2:30:56] noticed Among Us in any way like it was
[2:30:58] in the book of Acts I don't have time to
[2:31:00] get you but it's not he not talking
[2:31:01] about feeding lazy people no I'm not
[2:31:03] saying that but let me just leave and
[2:31:05] move on and just try to close out here
[2:31:07] the church in the book of Acts the
[2:31:09] Church of Ephesus was a church that
[2:31:12] lived this way in the unity of the
[2:31:14] spirit and they got this way because
[2:31:16] they lived in the spirit they know
[2:31:20] achieve this life in the spirit by sheer
[2:31:22] will power or In Their Own Strength no
[2:31:26] it was by the power of the Holy Spirit
[2:31:30] they recognize that the cruelty of sin
[2:31:33] tempts us to be self-reliant that's what
[2:31:35] the devil did to Eve to be self-reliant
[2:31:38] God doesn't care about you he's keeping
[2:31:39] something away from you you better take
[2:31:40] it into your hands and that's what we do
[2:31:42] sin makes us we trust in the arm of
[2:31:45] Flesh and the cruelity of sin temp to be
[2:31:48] self-reliant and RI on the arm of Flesh
[2:31:51] our own efforts rather than on God but
[2:31:54] the Holy Ghost so all I'm saying today

[2:32:44] interactions so we can daily grow into
[2:32:48] him in All Things and to the unity of

[3:02:55] [Music]
[3:03:11] Hallelujah blessed be the
[3:03:13] name of the Lord can we give the Lord a
[3:03:16] hand of praise
[3:03:19] [Music]
[3:03:24] amen you love the Lord this morning what
[3:03:27] can we say about the message what can we
[3:03:30] say about the Lord and how many
[3:03:33] appreciate our precious brother Olu what
[3:03:36] a word from the
[3:03:38] Lord addressing the body but addressing
[3:03:42] homes and families and situations and
[3:03:46] bringing a Unity of the spirit and
[3:03:50] helping us to navigate the issues of
[3:03:52] life there's so much that was said that
[3:03:56] gets you to reframe your thinking amen
[3:03:58] that God has set people in your life
[3:04:01] some that are good some that are bad
[3:04:03] some that will love you some that will
[3:04:05] hate you and it's all designed that
[3:04:08] given the the the foundation that is not
[3:04:10] good for you to be alone to bring on
[3:04:12] that character in you so it makes you
[3:04:14] relook at situations and relook at
[3:04:17] people that go God and his wisdom has
[3:04:19] sent our way because this pyramid and
[3:04:23] this life that is being formed into the
[3:04:25] word image has to be tested and tried
[3:04:28] for every one of these virtues to be
[3:04:30] displayed and even the virtue of our age
[3:04:32] being brotherly kindness you cannot be
[3:04:35] able you can't demonstrate that on your
[3:04:36] own unless you have somebody you have to
[3:04:38] forgive you can't demonstrate that
[3:04:41] virtue without situations coming and
[3:04:44] I've said it many times before that
[3:04:46] somebody who is very close some some
[3:04:48] somebody who's not close to you can't
[3:04:49] hurt you but it takes somebody who's
[3:04:51] close to you to create a situation that
[3:04:54] forces the level of forgiveness that
[3:04:56] could qualify because something that's
[3:04:59] easy is a easy thing to forgive a easy
[3:05:01] thing you know but somebody who's close
[3:05:03] to you who you didn't expect it from who
[3:05:05] did it in a certain way creates that
[3:05:07] situation for that character of Jesus to
[3:05:11] be there that love and it's not Jesus
[3:05:13] trying to be love God is love and he
[3:05:15] wants that same love to be moved moving
[3:05:17] through each one of us until we become
[3:05:19] reflections of his love can we give the
[3:05:21] Lord a hand of Praise this
[3:05:23] morning this is a message that's worth
[3:05:26] listening to again and again it's an
[3:05:30] anchor point it for your marriage it's
[3:05:32] for your family situation it's for
[3:05:34] church issues it's for it's leadership
[3:05:36] training it's spiritual maturity is
[3:05:39] preparing us to leave this place with a
[3:05:41] recognition that it's the grace of God
[3:05:43] Upon Our Lives and the same way Christ
[3:05:45] loved us is the way we have to love one
[3:05:47] another same way husband love your wife
[3:05:50] as Christ loved the church same way we
[3:05:52] live may the Lord richly bless you this
[3:05:54] morning and I pray that as we prepare to
[3:05:57] leave this house but not from his
[3:05:59] presence that these things will be on
[3:06:01] our hearts and our minds as we we work
[3:06:04] to be as brother U said better people we
[3:06:06] want to be better people the purpose of
[3:06:08] coming to church is to make us better
[3:06:09] people can the church say amen amen so
[3:06:12] for some notes of Praise this morning
[3:06:16] from Sister Juliet I'm thanking Lord for

[3:06:33] the little things it's the big things
[3:06:36] God has a direct interest in every
[3:06:38] aspect of our lives and many times we
[3:06:41] don't even understand how God moves
[3:06:43] behind the scenes things we don't even
[3:06:45] see things we don't even understand God
[3:06:47] shift turn things around for your good
[3:06:49] he said I know the plans I have for you
[3:06:51] plans of Peace plans of Hallelujah to
[3:06:53] give you an expected end and you may not
[3:06:56] see it but it's a reason to give God
[3:06:57] thanks that's why he said in everything
[3:07:00] give him thanks in the good times in the
[3:07:02] bad times because what you might
[3:07:04] consider the bad times might be the
[3:07:06] grace of God to you that you're supposed
[3:07:08] to be thankful thank you for this
[3:07:10] situation thank you for the flat tire
[3:07:12] because if I was driving I could have
[3:07:14] been in another situation can the Church

[3:14:00] kuu and so many other cases um that are
[3:14:03] looking for prayer looking for a touch
[3:14:05] from the Lord uh we want to remember
[3:14:07] each one and pray for one another even
[3:14:10] as we come close to leaving here and the
[3:14:12] word said I think but over read the
[3:14:14] scripture last week forsaking not the
[3:14:16] assembling of yourselves even as the day
[3:14:17] approaching in other words the closer we
[3:14:19] get to leaving this place is the more we
[3:14:22] should seek to come together to prepare
[3:14:23] to leave this place this world is on a
[3:14:26] on a Time clock that's counting down and
[3:14:28] time is running out we don't know how
[3:14:30] much more time is left we see the whole
[3:14:32] political movements the economic
[3:14:33] movements everything is just moving so
[3:14:35] quickly now and speeding up with
[3:14:37] everything so we want to just be ready
[3:14:39] we want to be mindful of the time and
[3:14:41] the season that we are living in and uh
[3:14:44] in this whole Christmas end of year and
[3:14:46] we know spiritually Jesus wasn't born on
[3:14:48] December the 25th but the world has
[3:14:51] hijacked what it represents with the
[3:14:53] birth of Christ and we celebrate his
[3:14:55] birth all year round every day because
[3:14:57] if he didn't come we wouldn't be here
[3:14:58] but in this season that we're in don't
[3:15:00] get caught up in the spirit of the world
[3:15:02] we want to be mindful of the purpose
[3:15:05] that he came and if he didn't come we
[3:15:06] wouldn't have a chance and I love how
[3:15:08] brother U spoke of that woman who was
[3:15:10] caught in the very act and how Jesus
[3:15:13] stood there and asked the question where
[3:15:15] are thine accusers and he can say
[3:15:17] neither do I condemn thee and that was
[3:15:20] Jesus on the earth in display showing
[3:15:22] the attributes that we ought to have for
[3:15:24] one another that if there was no and and
[3:15:27] friends let me just close with this
[3:15:29] there would be no need for
[3:15:31] blood if God didn't know we would have
[3:15:33] failures there'd be no need for Mercy if
[3:15:36] God didn't have to create a provision
[3:15:38] for you to be coming out of a situation
[3:15:40] that you're in so we thank God this
[3:15:42] morning for his blood we thank God for
[3:15:44] his grace we thank God for Mercy we
[3:15:46] thank God for the see a forgetfulness
[3:15:48] and it's really mindblowing when you
[3:15:50] look into the mind of Christ as but U
[3:15:52] said many of us we take up a challenge
[3:15:54] for God and God not even looking at it
[3:15:56] that way there's Moses angry and God is
[3:15:59] not that angry you know so we want to be
[3:16:01] very Mindful and very sensitive as we
[3:16:03] approach this season don't get caught up
[3:16:05] in the spirit of the Season don't get
[3:16:06] caught up in in all these and make sure
[3:16:08] that you don't lose your Christian
[3:16:10] testimony in this time uh so may the
[3:16:13] Lord richly bless you have a wonderful
[3:16:15] week in the presence of the Lord
[3:16:17] uh may the Lord richly bless you brother
