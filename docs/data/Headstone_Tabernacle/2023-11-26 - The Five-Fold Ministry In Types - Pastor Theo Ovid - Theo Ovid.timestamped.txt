[40:59] so this morning looking forward to see
[41:01] what the Lord will do and I'm here this
[41:03] morning not for long just a few comments
[41:05] I want to make before I introduce to you
[41:07] a tape uh a couple years back and the
[41:10] name and the tape is uh the fivefold
[41:13] ministry in type now you know for the
[41:15] last couple of services we have been
[41:17] emphasizing about God have to take the
[41:19] ministry and place the ministry first in
[41:23] position I want to read this from Acts
[41:25] chapter 4 if you have your you want to
[41:26] turn to it act 4:23 and this is after
[41:29] the lame man the CP man walked and
[41:31] whatnot we read this before but I want
[41:32] to read it again I want to bring
[41:33] something to you and being this is 23
[41:36] they went to their own company reported
[41:38] all of the chief priests and Elders had
[41:39] sent to them and when they heard that
[41:41] they lifted up their voices to God now
[41:44] this is remember the Holy Ghost they say
[41:46] I the Holy Ghost I don't to pray I the
[41:47] Holy Ghost I to cry no they lift up
[41:49] their voices to God with one Accord and
[41:51] said Lord Thou Art God which has made
[41:54] Heaven and Earth and the Sea and all all
[41:56] that is in them okay watch who by the
[42:00] mouth of thy servant David had said why
[42:02] did Heen rage and the people imagine a
[42:04] vain thing the king of the earth stood
[42:06] up and the rulers were gathered together
[42:07] against the God and against his Christ
[42:10] for a truth against thy holy Child Jesus
[42:12] whom thou has anointed both Herod and
[42:14] Pontius Pilate with the Gentiles and the
[42:16] people of Israel were gathered together
[42:18] for to do whatsoever thy hand and th
[42:20] counil determined before to be done now
[42:23] Lord here we go behold your threatenings
[42:25] and Grant unto thy servants that with
[42:27] all boldness they would speak Thy Word
[42:31] by stretching forth thine hand to heal
[42:34] and that signs and wonders may be done
[42:36] by the name of thy holy Child Jesus note
[42:39] they say by explanation and
[42:41] interpretation but they were actually
[42:43] declaring they want God to do this by
[42:46] stretching forth his hand to heal and
[42:48] that signs and wonders may be done by
[42:50] the name of thy holy Child Jesus and
[42:52] when they had prayed it was this normal
[42:55] small little message pray thing no no no
[42:57] no when they had prayed the place was
[43:00] shaken where they were assembled
[43:02] together and they were all filled with
[43:04] the Holy Ghost it come like filled Holy
[43:06] Ghost again so in other words they
[43:08] refilled with the Holy Ghost and this is
[43:10] where we talk about dynamics of this
[43:11] church would be a refilling of the Holy
[43:13] Ghost which is right here in Acts 4
[43:15] watch this part now and the multitude of
[43:17] them were one okay the multitude of them
[43:21] believe who of one heart of one Soul
[43:24] neither said any of them that ought of
[43:26] the things which he possessed was his
[43:27] own but they had all things in common
[43:30] verse 33 here we go and with great power
[43:34] give the apostles witness of the
[43:37] resurrection of the Lord Jesus and great
[43:40] grace was upon them all not great quotes
[43:43] great message great books great tracks
[43:45] great power amen are we are you with me
[43:47] now was gave the apostles witness of the
[43:50] resurrection of the Lord Jesus and great
[43:52] grace was upon them all neither was the
[43:56] there any among them that lacked for as
[43:59] many as were possessors of lands or
[44:01] houses sold them and brought the prices
[44:05] of things uh that were sold and laid
[44:08] them at the apostles feet and
[44:09] distribution was made unto every man
[44:12] according as his need and Joseph who by
[44:15] the apostles was named Barnabas which
[44:17] were being interpreted the son of
[44:18] consolation a levite of the House of
[44:20] Cyprus having land sold it brought the
[44:23] money and laid it upon the apostles feet
[44:26] chapter 5 but a certain man named ananas
[44:29] which safarah his wife sold a possession
[44:33] and came back and kept back part of the
[44:35] price his wife also being prevy to it
[44:38] brought a certain part laid it at the
[44:40] apostles feet but Peter said annias why
[44:44] had Satan filled thy heart to lie to the
[44:47] Holy Ghost and to keep back part of the
[44:49] price of the land while it remained was
[44:52] it not thine own and after it was sold
[44:58] was it not thine own power why hast thou
[45:00] conceived this thing in thine heart thou
[45:02] has not lied unto men but unto God and
[45:05] Nas hearing these words fell down and
[45:07] give up The Ghost and great fear came on
[45:10] them that heard these things and the
[45:12] young man arose wung him up carried him
[45:14] out and buried him it was about a space
[45:16] of 3 hours after his wife not knowing
[45:19] what was done came in Peter answered her
[45:21] tell me whether he sold the land for so
[45:23] such he said yeah for so such then Peter
[45:25] said unto her how is it that you have
[45:26] agreed together to tempt the spirit of
[45:29] the Lord behold the feet of them which
[45:31] have buried thy husband at the door
[45:33] shall carried he out then fell she down
[45:37] straightway at his feet yielded up The
[45:39] Ghost and the young man came in found
[45:41] the dead carry forth buried her by her
[45:43] husband and great fear Came Upon all the
[45:47] church and upon as many as heard these
[45:50] things question could you imagine God
[45:55] coming down in a fold Ministry in
[45:58] judgment I want you to think about that
[46:00] now now I know it have two extrem you
[46:04] have those who say press place fivefold
[46:06] that is not the word that's not what bam
[46:08] teach or preach they may read the
[46:09] message nothing revealed to them that
[46:10] they off they offer that and have those
[46:13] who say they fight for Ministry that
[46:15] also off too because but the Bible said
[46:18] when God sets in the church God have to
[46:22] set in the church and God can only set
[46:24] that according as by the prophet of
[46:26] Malachi 4 with groaning and travailing
[46:29] when God have said then he placed
[46:30] positionally these gifts in the body do
[46:33] you get it now so it will take the
[46:35] spirit Dynamics to positionally place
[46:38] the sons in position is
[46:40] our no man have this right now but this
[46:43] is promised God veiled not by the over
[46:46] Ministry and by over you know Shing the
[46:48] word not that this is because the
[46:51] faithful Ministry would actually be
[46:54] adopted Sons sons that could unveil God
[46:58] note when Peter saw the man he
[47:01] didn't say oh God how long you're sick
[47:02] no he wasn't questioning how length of
[47:04] sickness he says Silver and Gold Have I
[47:05] None such as I have I give I have the
[47:08] power to release to give to lose to free
[47:12] I have this power because I've been
[47:14] assigned to it by my father oh give the
[47:16] Lord a shout Peter didn't have to pray
[47:19] to God to do that you know he says
[47:20] silver and gold I don't have you
[47:22] up pick up your bed and walk oh give the
[47:24] Lord some praises and I am saying
[47:26] there'll be a gentile bride that will be
[47:29] empowered with the same power there will
[47:31] be what they call the manifestation of
[47:33] the sons of God when you come to church
[47:35] you come to church and sit down on a PE
[47:37] and go back home you come to church to
[47:38] see Sons born into manifestation oh give
[47:42] the Lord a shout in the house do you get
[47:44] it now you come in to see one day Sons
[47:48] going to be born into manifestation oh

[58:57] was kindled against David he said why
[58:59] CEST thou hither and with whom hast thou
[59:02] left those few sheep in Wilderness I
[59:04] Know Thy pride and and the naughtiness
[59:06] of thine heart for thou art come down
[59:08] that thou might see the battle and David
[59:11] said what have I now done is there not a
[59:14] cause and he turned from him towards
[59:17] another and spake after the same manner
[59:20] and the people answered him again after
[59:21] the former Manner and when the words
[59:23] were heard which David spake they
[59:25] rehearsed them before Saul and he sent
[59:28] for him and David said to Saul let no
[59:32] man heart fail because of him thy
[59:34] servant will go and fight this
[59:36] Philistine and Saul said to David Thou
[59:39] Art not able to go against his
[59:41] Philistine to fight with him for thou
[59:42] art but a youth and he a man of war from
[59:45] his Youth and David said unto Saul thy
[59:48] servant kept his father sheep there came
[59:50] a l and a bear and took a lamb out of
[59:52] the flock and I went after him and smote
[59:54] him and delivered it out of his mouth
[59:57] and when he arose against me I caught
[59:59] him by his beard and smote him and slew
[1:00:02] him thy servants slew both The Lion and
[1:00:05] the bear and this uncircumcised
[1:00:06] Philistine shall be as one of them
[1:00:09] seeing he had Define the armies of the
[1:00:12] Living God David said moreover the Lord
[1:00:14] had delivered me out of the Paw of the
[1:00:16] land out of the Paw of the beer he will
[1:00:18] deliver me out of the hand of this
[1:00:20] Philistine and Saul said unto David go
[1:00:24] and the Lord be with thee Saul armed
[1:00:27] David with his armor he put a helmet of
[1:00:29] brass upon his head and he armed him
[1:00:31] with a coat of male David GED his sword
[1:00:33] upon his armor he has say to go for he
[1:00:35] had not proved it and David S the SW I
[1:00:38] cannot go with these I have not prove
[1:00:41] them and David put them off him he took
[1:00:45] his staff in his hand chose him five
[1:00:47] smooth stones out of a brook he put them
[1:00:49] in Shepherd's bag which he had even in a
[1:00:52] script and his sling was in his hand and
[1:00:54] he drew near to the Philistine and the
[1:00:57] Philistine came on and Drew near unto
[1:01:00] David and the man that be the shield
[1:01:02] went before him and when the
[1:01:04] Philistine looked about and saw David he
[1:01:07] disdained him for he was but a youth
[1:01:09] readyy of a fear countenance and the
[1:01:11] Philistine said unto David am I a dog
[1:01:14] that th comest to me with staves and the
[1:01:17] Philistine cursed David by his gods and
[1:01:20] the Philistines said to David come to me
[1:01:22] and I will give thy flesh unto the of
[1:01:24] the air andto the Beast of the field
[1:01:27] then said David to the Philistine thou
[1:01:28] comest to me with sword with spear with
[1:01:31] a shield but I come to thee in the name
[1:01:33] of the Lord of hosts the god of the
[1:01:34] armies of Israel whom thou Hast defined
[1:01:37] this day will the Lord deliver thee into
[1:01:40] my hand and I will smite thee and will
[1:01:43] take thine head from Thee I will give
[1:01:46] the carcasses of the host of the
[1:01:48] Philistines this day unto the fowls of
[1:01:50] the air andto the wild beast of the
[1:01:51] earth that all the Earth may know that
[1:01:53] there is a God in Israel and all this
[1:01:56] assembly shall know that the Lord saveth
[1:01:58] not with sword and spear for the battle
[1:02:01] is the Lords and he will give you unto
[1:02:03] our hands and came to pass when the
[1:02:06] Philistines arose and came and Drew near
[1:02:08] to meet David that David hasted and ran
[1:02:11] towards the Army to meet the Philistine
[1:02:13] and David put his hand in his back took
[1:02:14] Den his Stone slang it SW the Philistine
[1:02:17] in his forehead and the stone sunk in
[1:02:20] his forehead and he fell upon the face
[1:02:22] of the Earth so David prevailed over the
[1:02:24] pH
[1:02:25] with a sling and a stone and smote the
[1:02:27] Philistine and slew him but there was no
[1:02:29] sword in the hand of David therefore
[1:02:31] David ran and stood upon the Philistine
[1:02:34] and took his sword and Drew it out of
[1:02:36] his sheath therefore and slew him and
[1:02:39] cut off his head there with when the
[1:02:41] Philistines saw the champion was dead
[1:02:43] they fled I like that when the champion
[1:02:45] was dead they fled and the men of Israel
[1:02:48] and Judah arose and shouted and pursued
[1:02:51] the Philistines until until Thou come to
[1:02:53] the valley unto the gates of ekron and
[1:02:56] the wounded of the Philistines fell down
[1:02:58] by the way of sham even unto the Gat

[1:05:25] and I have an inspiration the ministry
[1:05:28] of Jesus Christ in the adopted sons in
[1:05:32] the last day have a context scripture
[1:05:35] acts chap 4
[1:05:38] 31-33 and it reads and when they had
[1:05:41] prayed the place was shaken where they
[1:05:44] were assembled together and they were
[1:05:47] all filled with the Holy Ghost and they
[1:05:50] spake the word of God with boldness and
[1:05:54] the multitude of them that believe were
[1:05:56] of one heart and of one Soul neither
[1:06:00] said any of them that ought of the
[1:06:02] things which he possessed as his own but
[1:06:05] they all had things in common there's
[1:06:08] the verse I want to get to and with
[1:06:10] great power gave the apostles witness of
[1:06:15] the resurrection of the Lord Jesus and
[1:06:18] great grace was upon them all oh blessed
[1:06:22] be the name of the Lord great power is
[1:06:25] what the apostles have to give witness
[1:06:29] of the resurrection of Jesus Christ all
[1:06:32] let's go brother Brandon let's go back
[1:06:36] to the real first light the old
[1:06:38] Pentecostal blessing and the power of
[1:06:40] the Holy Ghost back in the church they
[1:06:42] put it all on the preacher today it
[1:06:45] ain't the preacher here we go the Holy
[1:06:49] Ghost is just as much to the Ley as it
[1:06:53] is is to the preacher oh give the Lord a
[1:06:56] shout feeling good already the Holy
[1:06:58] Ghost is what just as much to the L as
[1:07:02] it is to the preacher he ain't got all
[1:07:05] the religion they got it out here I am
[1:07:09] one today this is Brother Mana that
[1:07:12] believes that we ought to get the spirit
[1:07:15] of God back in the church where we can
[1:07:18] have the gifts of the Spirit operating
[1:07:20] with unction and power this is not
[1:07:24] brother to thing this is brother
[1:07:25] brandham saying I want I'm one today
[1:07:29] that believes we ought to get the spirit
[1:07:32] of God back in the church where we can
[1:07:36] have the gifts of the Spirit operating
[1:07:39] with unction and power but today we find
[1:07:43] men wearing the beginning in the church
[1:07:45] ages you notice it started at Deeds of
[1:07:48] the nians after a while it become a
[1:07:51] Doctrine well what is it we are have
[1:07:54] taken all the spirit away from the
[1:07:58] congregation and make Bishops overseers
[1:08:02] popes you see where I get message pop
[1:08:04] from because that's what they make when
[1:08:06] they take the spirit off from the
[1:08:08] congregation and put it on men message
[1:08:11] men Pastor men so-called fold men not
[1:08:15] not God fold men who assume things now
[1:08:18] they have taken all the spirit away from
[1:08:21] the congregation and made Bishops
[1:08:24] overseers popes put it all in the pulpit
[1:08:29] and the pulpit got
[1:08:31] intellectual Hallelujah no more Spirit
[1:08:35] just talk and more talk mystery on top
[1:08:38] of mystery just intellectual explanation
[1:08:41] reference from who say and who say and
[1:08:43] who say and who say out there I come to
[1:08:46] preach on Time magazine or Music
[1:08:47] Magazine that's what them say they I'm
[1:08:49] come to preach from the word of God
[1:08:50] because the word is Original Seed what
[1:08:54] word not my word the word from the mouth
[1:08:56] of the prophets Oh Glory to God
[1:09:00] Amen so watch they put it all in the
[1:09:03] pulpit and the pulpit got intellectual
[1:09:05] and there you got a hybrid church again
[1:09:09] under
[1:09:11] intellectuals but say God send us back
[1:09:15] to the Holy Ghost amongst the people let
[1:09:18] the unction of the spirit move among the
[1:09:21] people giving forth messages
[1:09:24] and power and manifestation if we have
[1:09:26] to stand on the street corner or get a
[1:09:29] chicken house or AB band somewhere oh
[1:09:31] praise the name of the Lord and if Jesus
[1:09:34] Christ Liv in the apostles and done the
[1:09:36] signs that he was here on Earth it will
[1:09:38] do it again if we get zeroed in we have
[1:09:41] got to get zeroed I don't care what the
[1:09:44] church says that's why I try to say zero
[1:09:46] on this promise I want to know what his
[1:09:48] promised the bride I don't want to know
[1:09:50] what the devil this doing out here and
[1:09:52] that doing out here I want to know what
[1:09:53] what is my promise because I have to
[1:09:55] deal with depress with Rome with with
[1:09:57] false prophets with false people you
[1:09:59] have to deal with all of that oh praise
[1:10:01] the name of the Lord if the apostles hit
[1:10:03] the DT we can hit the DT too could
[1:10:05] somebody say Amen if we will get zeroed
[1:10:08] with God's word let our experience zero
[1:10:11] with his word they did it if they did it
[1:10:14] we can do it too amen oh blessed be the
[1:10:16] name of the Lord that's so
[1:10:18] wonderful so the subject we talk about
[1:10:21] David's Ministry Joshua Ministry and
[1:10:23] Ministry the 5old ministry in type now
[1:10:26] David was virtually
[1:10:28] unknown God told
[1:10:30] Samuel David and nobody virtually
[1:10:33] unknown anointed to be king by Samuel
[1:10:36] under Divine
[1:10:38] instruction and we know we know the
[1:10:40] story and I want you to show as this is
[1:10:43] a type of the F4 Ministry because I keep
[1:10:46] saying it I know a lot of ministers and
[1:10:48] brothers disagree what I'm saying but I
[1:10:50] I keep saying it anyhow because what I
[1:10:52] believe and this is what I'm seeing in
[1:10:54] the word and I'll preach it because I
[1:10:55] see it and I believe
[1:10:57] it there's a fivefold Ministry yet the
[1:11:01] reason I'm saying that it will take
[1:11:03] Dynamics to produce the fold Ministry so
[1:11:06] right now we are doing the work of
[1:11:08] apostle doing the work of a prophet
[1:11:09] doing the work of evangelist doing the
[1:11:10] work of a teacher doing of a pastor I've
[1:11:12] been doing this thing for many many
[1:11:13] years but it takes God to place me in
[1:11:17] the position that's something different
[1:11:19] that is something absolutely different
[1:11:21] it come like if you ask a question
[1:11:23] brother you do you believe they are
[1:11:24] false anointed
[1:11:26] ones not in the way that was
[1:11:29] prophesied they are Breen who are
[1:11:32] false they are Breen who are teaching
[1:11:35] false teachings and false doctrines they
[1:11:38] are false but they are not anointed
[1:11:40] false yet when the anointing
[1:11:43] strike then they become the anointed
[1:11:46] ones false but for now maybe God could
[1:11:51] flip them wrong I don't know because
[1:11:54] when the door for the Gentile was about
[1:11:56] open about to be open there was a man
[1:11:59] named
[1:12:00] Saul that was fighting the church now if
[1:12:03] we stay back as the church and say Saul
[1:12:05] false anointed he fighting the message
[1:12:07] he fighting inspiration we was going to
[1:12:10] be off because Saul was going to become
[1:12:14] Paul so that was the beginning so God
[1:12:17] give Saul that space flip him over he
[1:12:21] was changed to Paul and we know he wrote
[1:12:23] the New Testament and something like
[1:12:24] that that was in the beginning now this
[1:12:27] is the ending now this is the ending
[1:12:29] where the door of the gentille is about
[1:12:30] to be closed and seeds have been sown
[1:12:34] and you cannot change your seed mid
[1:12:36] Harvest you cannot in the middle of your
[1:12:39] being a corn and you say you know what I
[1:12:41] want to be a peas no too late a little
[1:12:44] while you'll bear your corn a little
[1:12:46] while you'll bear your hate or your
[1:12:48] animosity or your evil or your
[1:12:50] unforgiveness and a little while you're
[1:12:52] getting your Harvest you you can't
[1:12:53] change it even when the Holy Spirit told
[1:12:57] the prophet pick up a pen and write he
[1:12:58] said many there the holy spirit said
[1:13:01] many true ministers will misunderstand
[1:13:04] that Prophet so I cannot say this one
[1:13:07] false and that one false no here's why
[1:13:10] the true anointed have to come forth
[1:13:11] first and we haven't seen that yet oh
[1:13:15] glory to God hallelujah we haven't seen
[1:13:18] that yet because Dynamics will push
[1:13:20] forward the true anointed and this is
[1:13:22] where David coming now oh hallelujah oh
[1:13:27] glory to God I feel inspired now David
[1:13:31] God get fed up with Saul and God tell
[1:13:34] Samuel go and anoint me a king of one of
[1:13:37] Jesse's son we know the
[1:13:40] story David was not even considered by
[1:13:43] Jesse he bring out all them stab boys
[1:13:47] all them regulars and when Samuel said
[1:13:50] is there any more because what I'm
[1:13:52] seeing here I have no witness the
[1:13:54] teaching was good the preaching was
[1:13:57] perfect the Revelation was very good but
[1:14:00] the witness of the spirit wasn't there
[1:14:02] upon that Prophet so you had to say send
[1:14:04] some more is there anymore they bring
[1:14:07] David unknown guy seeing about sheep
[1:14:10] poured the oil upon him all right then
[1:14:13] David Going Back Into Obscurity yeah
[1:14:16] yeah about David David see about sheep
[1:14:18] now David's father inspired to send
[1:14:22] David
[1:14:23] with some rituals for his brothers his
[1:14:26] brothers trying to embarrass him and
[1:14:28] belittle him and David said isn't there
[1:14:30] a cause because when David was leaving
[1:14:32] Goliath made his Ro send me a man we
[1:14:35] know the story David gave a testimony
[1:14:38] that none of them had he had given
[1:14:41] experience that none of them had that is
[1:14:43] why he didn't care about sword and Spear
[1:14:46] and armor and Shield or even golad size
[1:14:49] he said who is that uncircumcised
[1:14:51] Philistines I'm going to fight item

[1:28:45] they would go to reading this word when
[1:28:48] it come out in print then when it in
[1:28:50] print you could twist it yes remember
[1:28:53] Peter and them didn't have it in print
[1:28:54] you know right Peter and them had Old
[1:28:56] Testament scripture but the New
[1:28:58] Testament they were the Living Word what
[1:29:00] words they spoke common print but they
[1:29:03] had nothing to print to make a record as
[1:29:05] such they actually manifested and
[1:29:08] produce another book of Acts which
[1:29:09] become our record oh give the Lord some
[1:29:12] shout book of Peter book of Philippians
[1:29:15] Book of Romans H book of Corinthians
[1:29:18] that become the New Testament by men
[1:29:21] that was living so you are to actually
[1:29:23] take these men as Living Word speaking
[1:29:25] the word of God that's why Paul could
[1:29:27] say if
[1:29:29] I preach some other gospel than I first
[1:29:32] preached let me be a cursed oh if an
[1:29:34] angel come from heaven and preach any
[1:29:36] other gospel so today there's
[1:29:37] intellectual GI there's men who are
[1:29:39] great men great powerful men they could
[1:29:43] set everything together so intellectual
[1:29:44] but where is that Revival where is that
[1:29:47] God that burns on the heart of the human
[1:29:50] being it takes him Simplicity to bring
[1:29:53] the power of God that's a good one it
[1:29:56] takes what Simplicity to to bring the
[1:29:59] power of God he said it takes the
[1:30:01] Simplicity of believing God to make his
[1:30:03] word speak out to show that Jesus Christ
[1:30:06] is the same yesterday today and forever
[1:30:08] it takes a humble heart dedicated to God
[1:30:11] to bring Jesus Christ into present tense
[1:30:14] woo glory to God hallelujah you want to
[1:30:17] see Jesus it takes a certain heart a
[1:30:19] humble heart dedicated to God to bring
[1:30:21] Jesus in the present tense is not by
[1:30:23] might it does not take knowledge it he
[1:30:25] said he said it it does not take
[1:30:27] knowledge it's not by power it's not by
[1:30:29] might but is by my spirit sayth the Lord
[1:30:32] I'll unfold this mystery and we will cry
[1:30:35] to it Grace Grace with shoutings oh
[1:30:37] blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:30:39] hallelujah so Jesus had proven that he
[1:30:42] was the right kind of son so God just
[1:30:44] take Jesus for granted he was he had to
[1:30:46] prove he was the right kind of a son and
[1:30:48] they know he was adopted and he said
[1:30:50] this that's the thing that that God will
[1:30:52] do for his sons here on Earth someday he
[1:30:54] will call you a side church if you'll
[1:30:56] only obey him and stay on the word and
[1:30:58] believe it he will place into the church
[1:31:01] he will place where into the church
[1:31:04] before the coming of Jesus Christ he
[1:31:07] will place into the church all the
[1:31:10] powers that Christ had in him will be in
[1:31:13] the church all that God was he poured
[1:31:16] into Jesus all that Jesus was he poured
[1:31:18] into the church God wanted his work done
[1:31:21] he sent it into son his son wanted the
[1:31:23] work done he sent it into the church at
[1:31:25] that day you shall know I in the Father
[1:31:27] the father in me I in you and you in me
[1:31:30] at that day because the same power here
[1:31:31] we go that was in Jehovah God rested in
[1:31:34] Jesus Christ and the same power that
[1:31:36] rested in Jesus Christ rest in
[1:31:40] placed sons in the body of Christ and
[1:31:44] that is why I saying the true anointed a
[1:31:47] come forth yet because it take Dynamics
[1:31:49] to push them forward or let me rephrase
[1:31:52] that it will take a manifestation to
[1:31:54] push them forward oh give the Lord some
[1:31:57] Praises understand this if David had
[1:32:02] wear uh uh the Army sa and them armor he
[1:32:07] is just like
[1:32:08] the wear the armor and defeated wear the
[1:32:12] Armor All arm all them Spear and shield
[1:32:14] and helmet and whatnot he got go like
[1:32:16] that they have all the armor they have
[1:32:18] all the stuff and they still defeated
[1:32:20] they can't face coll so David have to
[1:32:22] show he have something different he has
[1:32:26] faith in God he said God will deliver
[1:32:28] you into my hands goad prophesy feed her
[1:32:31] to the birds and whatever it is and

[1:32:36] today you are M Hallelujah you Ain
[1:32:38] leaving here alive oh glory to God I
[1:32:42] dealing with you that's the fight for
[1:32:43] Ministry David Ministry going to step
[1:32:46] forward what kind of ministry is that
[1:32:48] Fearless anointed Hallelujah met God on
[1:32:52] the back side it takes a manifestation
[1:32:54] to push David forward how else could
[1:32:56] David be recognized except God prepared
[1:32:59] the environment for David to step
[1:33:00] forward the bear the lion that was
[1:33:04] backside of the desert experience the
[1:33:06] anointing upon Him is only his brothers
[1:33:08] who witness to that all that is in God's
[1:33:11] private dressing room but you see when
[1:33:13] God created the environment for David to
[1:33:15] step forward to Dil Goliath that was
[1:33:17] public that's a public show that is a
[1:33:20] public Ministry to identify this is my
[1:33:22] son he's anointed he is commissioned he
[1:33:25] is dealing with intellectual Giants on
[1:33:27] the field oh give the Lord some Praises

[1:33:47] power that rested in Jesus Christ rests
[1:33:50] in place sons and in the body of Christ
[1:33:52] placing of a son take him out to a
[1:33:54] certain place he's explaining it it
[1:33:56] don't need a deeper explanation than
[1:33:58] that take him out to a certain place

[1:36:11] to criticize
[1:36:13] Hallelujah but the brandham says there
[1:36:16] are so many voices in the Earth today
[1:36:18] that is absolutely hard thing to hear
[1:36:19] the voice of God because there's you de
[1:36:22] the voice of the supernatural there are
[1:36:24] so many intellectual voices great voices
[1:36:26] of Mighty Men now there are Mighty Men
[1:36:28] you know mighty men who are intellectual
[1:36:31] and in the intellectual condition the
[1:36:34] shaking nations with just the head
[1:36:36] knowledge Nations shook ministers shook
[1:36:40] churches shook because nobody knew it
[1:36:42] like them nobody could explain it like
[1:36:44] them nobody could show it Reve like them
[1:36:46] they shaken up Nation without
[1:36:48] power shaking up Nation without Spirit
[1:36:50] that's the head of
[1:36:51] work anointed G matter they are not
[1:36:55] overnight
[1:36:56] people but they Shake Nations being in
[1:36:59] great organization together great
[1:37:01] campaign flowly and a person would be a
[1:37:04] bit confused it's enough to confuse them
[1:37:07] on how these things could go on and
[1:37:10] prosper and there are voices that are
[1:37:12] raised up that do these things and it
[1:37:15] causes the voice of God to be placed way
[1:37:17] back somewhere and I realize for these
[1:37:20] guys be effective deceiver they have to
[1:37:23] disconnect the people from The Prophet
[1:37:25] clicks pull the plug on the prophet and
[1:37:28] then it get focus on them oh hallelujah
[1:37:32] oh my I say this way I have an Android
[1:37:35] phone Samsung right and that operating
[1:37:38] system is Android but Samsung have a
[1:37:40] skin over it that that that is the that
[1:37:44] the UI their graphical surface over it
[1:37:47] all the other companies would have
[1:37:48] Android the source is the Android but
[1:37:51] they could put things over it so you see
[1:37:53] now our source is the Bible that is the
[1:37:56] source code that's the original source
[1:37:59] that bam could could read a scripture
[1:38:01] the spirit of the Prophet is subject to
[1:38:03] the prophets and out of that scripture
[1:38:04] he could unfold Church order because
[1:38:07] that is the key that is the source so
[1:38:09] every time he call a scripture he see a
[1:38:11] mystery is scripture so a mystery is not
[1:38:14] just mystery a mystery of scripture a
[1:38:16] previously divinely hidden truth now
[1:38:19] divinely revealed but with it leave a
[1:38:21] supernatural amen atmosphere around it
[1:38:23] and something like that isn't that right
[1:38:25] so every word that was revealed he had
[1:38:27] was to come from the scripture that when
[1:38:29] the angel came to him to open the seals
[1:38:31] he compared what the angel was telling
[1:38:34] him with the scripture I'm not saying
[1:38:36] there is no angel is have Angels talking
[1:38:38] to guys but it's what them saying if
[1:38:40] it's in the scripture so you have to
[1:38:42] able to match it up so I don't want to
[1:38:44] hear what Bill Gates saying about
[1:38:46] depopulation that's not my gospel I
[1:38:48] don't hear what this one's saying and
[1:38:49] that one's saying I'm not reading what
[1:38:51] them saying I want to know what the
[1:38:52] Bible say in the last day be a super
[1:38:54] church that's what I know the people
[1:38:56] that know that God shall do great
[1:38:57] exploits that's what I know have nothing
[1:38:59] with depopulation and the vaccine and
[1:39:01] the vaccine and the vaccine like
[1:39:02] foolishness like
[1:39:04] distraction they're so foolish all the
[1:39:06] time people dying of Corona virus now
[1:39:08] the vaccine is the issue vaccine is Mark
[1:39:10] of the Beast and the prophet say right
[1:39:12] now you're being marked your judgment is
[1:39:13] later on and that he said that before he
[1:39:16] had vaccine Hallelujah Ezekiel 9 cry and
[1:39:21] say seal those who had take the vaccine
[1:39:24] that the Bible that scripture for that
[1:39:27] think about it now what the Bible say
[1:39:29] seal those who s and cry for the
[1:39:31] Abominations script SE SE those that
[1:39:33] that that that take the vaccine are you
[1:39:36] crazy that's why you had to go back to
[1:39:38] the word you know oh have the word have
[1:39:40] to be the source when you draw from that
[1:39:43] that by the word oh my Hallelujah
[1:39:46] brother talk about this he said and the
[1:39:49] voice of God so he's prophesying
[1:39:51] they say how will we know is the voice
[1:39:53] of God so he's prophesying for our time
[1:39:55] when we would ask the question how we
[1:39:57] will know is the voice of God he said
[1:39:59] because for today then it wasn't a
[1:40:02] vinting prophet talking about himself
[1:40:04] all right now today how we know is the
[1:40:06] voice of God because it will be a
[1:40:09] manifestation of the prophet's word this
[1:40:12] is God's prophet and a true voice of God
[1:40:14] only brings back brings
[1:40:17] back that real living Supernatural God
[1:40:21] with a supernatural word with a
[1:40:22] supernatural manifestation of the true
[1:40:24] word oh my so I'm going to conclude with
[1:40:27] David here now David's Ministry is to
[1:40:31] check the intellectual Giants on the
[1:40:33] field by and with the power of God
[1:40:37] that's the five-fold ministry to the
[1:40:39] bride buddy around the world so them
[1:40:42] Giants they wouldn't Escape no no no no
[1:40:45] no they wouldn't Escape God have David
[1:40:47] in type to show how they will be handled
[1:40:51] Hallelujah it wouldn't be quotee versus
[1:40:53] quote it wouldn't be explanation versus
[1:40:55] explanation it wouldn't be debate versus
[1:40:57] debate this wouldn't be an online debate
[1:40:59] and an online question and answer
[1:41:00] situation this is not that David
[1:41:03] Ministry is the power of God the spirit
[1:41:05] of God oh God upon a true fful Ministry
[1:41:08] to deep with them intellectual Giants
[1:41:10] with power oh my then we come now to
[1:41:13] Joshua Ministry W hallelujah oh do you
[1:41:17] love him this morning glory to God I
[1:41:20] showing you the five for Ministry and
[1:41:22] types Joshua now after the of Moses
[1:41:25] servant of God we read the scripture God
[1:41:27] tell Joshua Moses is dead arise go over
[1:41:30] this Jordan down on all this people into
[1:41:32] the land which God gave to them every
[1:41:34] place Sol of foot shall Tre upon that
[1:41:36] you now remember this God not talking a
[1:41:39] loud
[1:41:40] speaker they not a loud speaker God
[1:41:42] talking God shouting Joshua and
[1:41:45] everybody hearing that that God telling
[1:41:47] that no God tell that to Joshua the
[1:41:49] people hear that that that's not the
[1:41:51] voice for the people that's the voice
[1:41:53] for Joshua so he had to obey God right
[1:41:56] there shall not be any man so he
[1:41:57] described the from the r river river
[1:42:00] Euphrates and so like that and the
[1:42:01] Wilderness going on to the Sea shall be
[1:42:03] a coast there shall not be any man be
[1:42:05] able to stand before the all days of thy
[1:42:07] life as I was with Moses so I will be
[1:42:09] with thee I will not fail thee nor
[1:42:11] forsake
[1:42:13] thee th God telling Joshua that the
[1:42:16] people don't know nothing about that the
[1:42:18] people just watching Joshua they don't
[1:42:20] know as God was with Moses he is now
[1:42:23] with Joshua they don't know that they
[1:42:25] have no revelation of that all they know
[1:42:28] is this man that was Moses minister is
[1:42:31] now stepping forward to lead
[1:42:34] us that's all they know so he's a
[1:42:37] unknown yet known just as Moses Minister
[1:42:39] he's no prophet he a no preacher thing
[1:42:42] he's just Moses Minister he's there with
[1:42:44] Moses every know Joshua look
[1:42:46] mes all right he told him M with night
[1:42:51] so but brah says here this now here we
[1:42:53] go and there's a great lot of types we
[1:42:55] could go into we'll bypass some of them
[1:42:57] for instance like Moses brought the
[1:42:59] church up to sin to their Theology of
[1:43:01] last night Moses was not permitted to
[1:43:03] take the TR over into the promised land
[1:43:05] because he he had
[1:43:07] failed so B is preaching and the church
[1:43:13] organization denomination has failed
[1:43:16] they will not take the church over God
[1:43:21] will raise up a new system a inter
[1:43:24] denominational system by the power of
[1:43:27] God that will take the church into the
[1:43:29] promised land organizations and
[1:43:32] denominations has messed it up each one
[1:43:35] after their own theology each one after
[1:43:39] their own thinking but God will take his
[1:43:42] Holy Spirit and will raise up his Joshua
[1:43:45] plural that will take the church to the
[1:43:48] promise with no denominational string
[1:43:52] tied anywhere but will take over his
[1:43:54] church he will take his Holy Spirit and
[1:43:58] raise up his Joshua who is that Ministry
[1:44:01] fight for Ministry type Oh Glory to God
[1:44:03] the guys that God going to raise up to
[1:44:06] take the church over Oh Glory to God
[1:44:08] hallelujah Moses had failed he was a
[1:44:10] lawgiver Joshua was called of Grace he
[1:44:12] took the church on we find that Joshua
[1:44:15] knowing his commission knowing it lays
[1:44:17] in his hand God had called him for a
[1:44:19] duty and he must not you had to walk
[1:44:21] softly before God you said how the
[1:44:23] church ought to look this morning to
[1:44:25] what for what to find the spirit working
[1:44:28] amongst the people if you want a church
[1:44:31] home where there's spirit that raised
[1:44:33] Christ from the dead the holy spirit
[1:44:35] that will move among the people not just
[1:44:39] Pulpit Holy Spirit Oh Glory to God
[1:44:42] hallelujah thank you Lord
[1:44:45] Jesus watch the spirit I real right okay
[1:44:51] he said God called ministers he said God
[1:44:53] called ministers ought not to be stuffed
[1:44:54] up with theology but but have visited
[1:44:57] the land to where we are going bringing
[1:44:59] back evidence of divine love and the
[1:45:02] power of Jesus Christ to make known to
[1:45:04] their congregation that there's a lan
[1:45:07] River now last night preaching going up
[1:45:09] Jordan and when we get to that River it
[1:45:11] divides us it separate us on the other
[1:45:13] side something has to happen oh my now
[1:45:17] Joshua knowing what command was great
[1:45:20] and having the Assurance he could be
[1:45:22] Fearless he could be as we call it
[1:45:25] Reckless as long as he was pointed the
[1:45:28] right way notice David Ministry Fearless
[1:45:31] look at josua Ministry Fearless because
[1:45:33] he was pointed the right way oh glory to
[1:45:36] God and so can the Church of the Living
[1:45:38] God be Reckless and fearless in faith if
[1:45:41] we areed the right way for he said as I
[1:45:44] was with Moses I will be with thee I
[1:45:46] will not fail thee for forsake thee he
[1:45:48] never forsake Moses he never failed
[1:45:50] Moses he will not fail Joshua he will

[1:52:33] of the book in other words break to us
[1:52:35] them seven Thunders on the back of the
[1:52:37] book let us enter into that great place
[1:52:39] now for Joshua to violate to the people
[1:52:41] The Inheritance that God had left for
[1:52:44] them now the commission to Joshua was
[1:52:45] three-fold We Know It
[1:52:48] crossover fight and conquer and then
[1:52:50] divide you cannot divide what you have
[1:52:53] not conquered and you cannot conquer if
[1:52:55] you don't
[1:52:59] confront let me say it again you cannot
[1:53:01] divide what you have not conquered and
[1:53:04] you cannot conquer what you not beare to
[1:53:06] confront and it's interesting how God
[1:53:09] put Jericho just right in front of
[1:53:12] Joshua the first thing the hardest thing
[1:53:14] Jericho when you can conquer Jericho you
[1:53:16] can con conquer anything and God showing
[1:53:19] not by my not by power but by the
[1:53:20] captain the captain of the host that
[1:53:23] follow instructions obedience come on
[1:53:25] now come on now oh glory to God tested
[1:53:28] on obedience and then you get the
[1:53:30] victory under obedience all right but
[1:53:32] brandham said this now
[1:53:35] Hallelujah we cannot have a
[1:53:38] Revival until we got men God called men
[1:53:43] so you know I blast men I blast number
[1:53:45] six I hit them hard because I I got
[1:53:50] terribly uh was a terrible experience in
[1:53:52] my early years in this message in
[1:53:53] Trinidad to see men manipulate people's
[1:53:55] lives I hated it if you spit and know
[1:53:58] the color is spit you want to tell your
[1:54:00] house to buy what car to buy where to go
[1:54:02] go to school not to go to school don't
[1:54:03] do this all control many of them have
[1:54:06] destroyed lives and never even repented
[1:54:08] of
[1:54:09] it that's
[1:54:12] right take people out of school affect
[1:54:15] people careers people's future and life
[1:54:18] and family and everything else yeah I
[1:54:22] rejected all of that yeah one time I I
[1:54:27] go to the same a tailor wearing the same
[1:54:29] ple pants because I thought that is what
[1:54:32] you're supposed to wear I didn't buy
[1:54:34] wool pants and all people buy W until
[1:54:37] the ants bite holes inside the pants I
[1:54:40] recognize in Trinidad here you don't
[1:54:41] need that kind of pants until I change
[1:54:43] my ta and all when I change back I
[1:54:47] wasn't wearing any pants like almost and
[1:54:49] you shall know
[1:54:51] them good Lord those were the
[1:54:54] days I was a
[1:54:56] radical I want to look like
[1:54:59] them
[1:55:01] Hallelujah you said we can't have a
[1:55:03] Revival until we get men God call men
[1:55:07] one two God trained men that is not
[1:55:10] trained up in the School of Theology and
[1:55:13] education but rugged men of fate and God
[1:55:16] has brought up in the school of his
[1:55:17] rugged training men who want not afraid
[1:55:20] to face the fire men who has come into
[1:55:23] the presence of God that knows his power
[1:55:26] that knows his omnipotence that knows
[1:55:28] his healing power some men are trained
[1:55:30] out to to know the Living God it's all
[1:55:32] right to train them by the word but the
[1:55:33] letter kill it but the spirit give it
[1:55:36] life and before we can have this revival
[1:55:39] God has to call out men and train men
[1:55:41] God trained men to carry this message
[1:55:43] they don't care what the opposition is
[1:55:44] they're willing to go to the fiery
[1:55:45] furnace and defeat to the Lions then
[1:55:47] whatever it may be they're ready to go
[1:55:49] because because they have been in the
[1:55:50] presence of God and know that he is
[1:55:52] whether to Victory or defeat they still
[1:55:54] stand the same that's the kind of
[1:55:56] training God does to men it's very
[1:55:59] strange to think that God would do that
[1:56:01] that God trains men like that but he
[1:56:03] does God leads his people to Great
[1:56:05] trials to purge them to what you know
[1:56:09] this coron virus is a purging
[1:56:12] too yeah it bringing out what people
[1:56:16] believe it bringing out what in people's
[1:56:18] heart and I recognize people don't
[1:56:20] believe the message you know they need
[1:56:21] message but they don't believe what bam
[1:56:22] says they believe what the pastor
[1:56:24] telling them and they have checken where
[1:56:27] is it there's a man on board examining
[1:56:29] horns they check any the
[1:56:30] horns
[1:56:32] Hallelujah God lead his people through
[1:56:34] great trials to purge them and sometime
[1:56:37] it takes years to do that not months not
[1:56:41] weeks years as for myself tonight I
[1:56:44] believe that right now God is training
[1:56:45] such men to meet the front line who are
[1:56:48] going through time shook from their feet
[1:56:50] sometime look like the whole thing is
[1:56:52] Fallen yet in the midst of it all they
[1:56:53] know the Living God and keep their face
[1:56:56] forward and when usually when God about
[1:56:58] to do something in the Supernatural
[1:57:00] Realms he usually gets a man that he
[1:57:03] could put his trust in and anoints him
[1:57:06] and sends him out and he is fearless at
[1:57:08] the job that's the kind of men we need
[1:57:11] today not polished scholar but men who
[1:57:14] know God in the power of his
[1:57:16] resurrection Oh you mean it have a scly
[1:57:18] knowledge and the power the resurrection
[1:57:20] knowledge that's right for instance
[1:57:22] there was a man in the Bible by the name
[1:57:23] of Moses who had got all his training he
[1:57:25] knew all theology he knew everything he
[1:57:27] should know he would have needed an
[1:57:29] education he could teach the masters of
[1:57:30] Israel in Israel or Egypt he didn't he
[1:57:34] didn't need one thing and the Bible tell
[1:57:35] us that he was learned in all the wisdom
[1:57:37] of the Egyptians why he could teach
[1:57:39] their Scholars he could teach their
[1:57:40] scientists he had keyed every point when
[1:57:43] it come to intellectual and yet here we
[1:57:46] go it take 40 years to beat all of that
[1:57:50] out of him out there in the Sands and
[1:57:53] when he got all his intellectual
[1:57:55] conceptions of God beat out of him out
[1:57:58] in the Sands the metal was ready to be
[1:58:01] molded over and that's the way God takes
[1:58:04] his men beats out all their fears all
[1:58:07] their intellectuals and when the Great
[1:58:09] Master Potter puts them on the wheel and
[1:58:11] begin to mold them over again Workman
[1:58:14] Worthy is God's man who could train a
[1:58:17] man more than God himself watch the way
[1:58:19] he trains him oh my hallelujah praise
[1:58:24] God hallelujah and we coming to Elisha
[1:58:27] Hallelujah learning to plug with 12 Uka
[1:58:30] oxen and if you take your eyes off the
[1:58:32] plug it Go Go zigzag It Go Go zigzag so
[1:58:34] he had to keep his eye Focus he had to
[1:58:36] keep his zero he got look back
[1:58:38] Hallelujah that when he when Elijah dro
[1:58:40] the man on him and pull it off so he
[1:58:42] said wait wait coming back he B the O he
[1:58:45] B the whole thing he was single focused
[1:58:47] he said coming after you I felt
[1:58:49] something I felt a power oh no church
[1:58:53] hold me how you hold me hallelujah
[1:58:55] hallelujah I want a manifested reality
[1:58:57] oh praise God Amen isn't that right amen
[1:59:01] so you had to train some men afterwards
[1:59:03] keep them on the Bible on the word lined
[1:59:04] up with the word say straight in line so
[1:59:08] God had to school him a little bit for
[1:59:10] ELA you T here for I'm going over to
[1:59:13] gigal the Lord has called me oh my
[1:59:17] hallelujah praise God
[1:59:19] thank you Jesus he went on the giggle
[1:59:22] place a Christian confession and baptism
[1:59:24] he said just now now that's that's
[1:59:26] that's good enough you me the confession
[1:59:28] that's good now watch that would have
[1:59:30] been all right for many Professor but he
[1:59:32] say stay right here but listen elishah
[1:59:34] couldn't think that way he he already
[1:59:36] felt the power of God see that's the
[1:59:38] problem people don't know God's power
[1:59:40] they know presence they never encounter
[1:59:42] Supernatural all the believer is
[1:59:44] intellectually what they're hearing as
[1:59:45] the word they're sincere they're
[1:59:47] believers they believe the word but but
[1:59:49] they never had a breakthrough experience
[1:59:51] like how Moses had it oh like how the
[1:59:54] children of Israel had it like how the
[1:59:55] people in the early years had it rather
[1:59:57] so Oh my he said let me tell you
[2:00:00] something now a man that ever tasted God
[2:00:03] will not be willing or cannot quench his
[2:00:05] thirst at a man-made system he can't do
[2:00:08] it all the theology they had at the
[2:00:11] school of the prophets could not quench
[2:00:12] The Thirst of that man of God he had a
[2:00:15] taste for God and they kept persuading
[2:00:17] him you should stay here why in 6 weeks
[2:00:19] oh just he said he said watch do you
[2:00:22] know your head will be taken away today
[2:00:23] he said yes I know it but hold your
[2:00:24] peace in other words save your breath
[2:00:26] don't try to tell me about it don't try
[2:00:28] to tell me what I'm doing I know where
[2:00:30] I'm going what I'm after God give us men
[2:00:33] like that God train men who knows not to
[2:00:36] wiggle off of this wiggle off and that I
[2:00:38] know I am going don't speak to me about
[2:00:40] it hold your breath don't try to
[2:00:44] discourage me because it's not going to
[2:00:46] do any good oh Hallelujah that's the the

[2:06:52] the prophecy that the prophet
[2:06:57] brought so I brought these three types
[2:06:59] to show you David's

[2:07:19] what the prophet said about this fight
[2:07:21] for Ministry now lust for money lust for
[2:07:24] big things Lust For popularity these
[2:07:26] things are dead to the believer he said
[2:07:28] we don't care attend to a cage why
[2:07:30] should I care live or die sink or drown
[2:07:33] this is the things that I'm interested
[2:07:35] in the kingdom of God whether I maintain
[2:07:37] my home whether I maintain my family
[2:07:40] whether I maintain whatever it is let me
[2:07:41] maintain Christ Our Hope and
[2:07:44] Glory then he said this Build Me Up Oh
[2:07:47] Lord into this let Christ be my head
[2:07:51] that's working through me so this is
[2:07:53] Ministry now okay on my Foundation my
[2:07:57] faith that's in him let virtue knowledge

[2:08:16] virtue his
[2:08:19] knowledge flow out that I might be able
[2:08:22] to teach those let Christ
[2:08:27] virtue his knowledge flow out so he's
[2:08:32] not talking about Revelation here now
[2:08:34] he's talking about an actual possession
[2:08:36] and when we talk about virtue we're not
[2:08:38] talking about the text virtue or reading
[2:08:41] about virtue or using the word Virtue as
[2:08:43] virtue we're talking about what left
[2:08:45] Jesus when the woman with the blood is
[2:08:47] to touch him he said said I felt virtue
[2:08:49] left me I a talkinging about you tired
[2:08:51] Pulpit I talk about that kind of virtue

[2:08:54] you're weary and you're tired like
[2:08:55] virtue leave you I'm not talking about
[2:08:56] that not that kind of virtue you're

[2:09:10] Sons that's the fold Ministry you know
[2:09:12] the fold Ministry is really adopted Sons
[2:09:15] let me say it again the fold Ministry
[2:09:18] will be adopted Sons because adopted
[2:09:20] Sons will have the ministry of Jesus
[2:09:22] Christ Oh Glory to God for God has set
[2:09:26] in the church right after that he said
[2:09:28] let that work in me let Christ's virtue
[2:09:30] his knowledge flow out that I might be
[2:09:32] able to teach those for God has set in
[2:09:34] the church Apostles prophets teachers
[2:09:36] pastors evangelists all for the
[2:09:39] perfecting and he's detailing it now all
[2:09:44] for the perfecting you know Min like
[2:09:47] talk about for the perfecting Church no
[2:09:48] but here here all for the perfecting and
[2:09:51] bringing all these virtues into
[2:09:54] it oh that's different now that is more
[2:09:57] detailed of the description not just
[2:10:00] perfecting not just preaching and
[2:10:02] teaching but bringing the virtues into
[2:10:04] it how do we do that by a text by by a
[2:10:08] message we have to have that to impart
[2:10:11] that we have to have that in us to give
[2:10:14] out
[2:10:16] that all for the perfecting and bringing
[2:10:20] all these virtues into it for the
[2:10:23] Perfection of the coming of Son of God
[2:10:25] each one of these stones are a material
[2:10:27] off of that one this is the material of
[2:10:29] this each one of those virtues belong to
[2:10:30] him oh my oh blessed be the name of the
[2:10:33] Lord oh praise the name of the Lord
[2:10:37] hallelujah all right are you ready we're
[2:10:40] done yet we still in GE we still in the
[2:10:43] cockpit now what Jesus said watch this

[2:11:14] notice here we go the Greater Works
[2:11:19] was to have the power in the
[2:11:22] church not only to heal the Sick by
[2:11:25] prayer or cast out Devils by prayer but
[2:11:30] to
[2:11:32] impart eternal life to
[2:11:36] Believers uhhuh now this takes in a
[2:11:39] different door all together this is a
[2:11:41] different door there's not there's a
[2:11:43] different door let me read it
[2:11:46] again now the Great
[2:11:48] Works was to have the
[2:11:51] power was to have the power in the
[2:11:54] church not only to heal the Sick by
[2:11:56] prayer cast out Devils by prayer but to
[2:12:00] impart eternal life to
[2:12:02] Believers the Holy Ghost was coming and
[2:12:06] giv into the hands of the church to
[2:12:09] impart life oh that's what Calvary meant
[2:12:13] it took stoop degraded men and women and
[2:12:17] lifted them into a place is to be Sons
[2:12:19] and Daughters of God to heal the sick
[2:12:22] and to impart eternal life by giving the
[2:12:25] Holy Ghost to obedient Believers men who
[2:12:29] were once
[2:12:30] unbelievers be made Believers and impart
[2:12:34] spiritual eternal life how much greater
[2:12:37] it is to say this sick woman laying here
[2:12:40] I can pray a prayer of faith and she'll
[2:12:41] be healed that's a great thing that's
[2:12:43] what he's doing then but he said greater
[2:12:45] than this shall you do I'm going to give
[2:12:47] you power not only to raise him up for a
[2:12:50] while but to give him eternal life which
[2:12:52] will be Eternal forever poor blind
[2:12:56] wretched people how do you miss that
[2:12:58] don't you see what the greater thing is
[2:13:00] the greatest thing that could ever
[2:13:02] happen was to impart eternal life to
[2:13:04] people what is eternal life the life
[2:13:06] that he lived the life that was in him
[2:13:08] imp part to others can a man do that a
[2:13:11] Son of God can a Vindicated son a son
[2:13:14] with the pillar of fire in him an
[2:13:16] adopted son with the Ministry of Jesus
[2:13:19] Christ oh give the Lord a praise
[2:13:21] offering there you are give the Lord a
[2:13:23] shout hallelujah glory to God
[2:13:29] hallelujah that's from that dead Calvary
[2:13:32] we know Paul had the Holy Spirit do you
[2:13:34] believe that when he was 14 days nights
[2:13:36] upon the sea without moon and stars
[2:13:38] right and he went down to the gallery to
[2:13:42] pray and he came back and told a man be
[2:13:44] of good courage for the angel of God
[2:13:48] whose servant I am came to me last night
[2:13:51] and said f Paul is that right not the
[2:13:54] Holy
[2:13:56] Spirit the angel of God sent from God
[2:14:01] not the Holy Spirit you said the
[2:14:04] angel now when John the Revelator the
[2:14:06] book of wrote I sent my angel Jesus did
[2:14:09] John fell them to worship the angel but
[2:14:11] the angel said stand up worship God see
[2:14:14] the true Angel won't stand to be
[2:14:16] worshiped he said he was of the prophets
[2:14:18] and his fellow servants that will
[2:14:19] signify these things therefore therefore
[2:14:22] Angelic
[2:14:23] beings is orain Ministers of God to come
[2:14:29] to the Earth to Bear record of God and
[2:14:33] they work through mortal
[2:14:35] beings just as they did through Daniel
[2:14:39] and back to the ages back there I
[2:14:42] believe it with all my heart so
[2:14:44] therefore friends as your brother that's
[2:14:47] all all I am but God's gift is the
[2:14:52] spirit of God that came down in the form
[2:14:56] of an
[2:14:57] Angel he didn't have wings he looked
[2:15:00] like a man I heard him when he walked
[2:15:04] just as that and walked on the floor
[2:15:07] walked right over just as normal as any
[2:15:09] man just stand there a man he comes time
[2:15:12] and time through the room and different
[2:15:14] places when I am fasting and
[2:15:16] praying the
[2:15:19] gift is the spirit of
[2:15:22] God that come down in the form of an
[2:15:25] Angel see that's the level the prophet
[2:15:28] was at when the angel was working with
[2:15:31] him in the early part of his ministry he
[2:15:35] said I represent the Faith by way of a
[2:15:38] Divine gift because the angel didn't
[2:15:41] come yet because he wasn't adopted yet
[2:15:44] for the angel to come into him to work
[2:15:46] with him in that way so he just had a
[2:15:48] gift he said I represent the Fai because
[2:15:52] the faith is God veiled oh
[2:15:55] hallelujah oh my let's continue we get
[2:16:00] in there we get in there I reckon the
[2:16:02] sufferings of this present time right
[2:16:04] now are not worthy to be compared with
[2:16:07] the glory which are revealed in us for
[2:16:10] the earnest expectation of the creation
[2:16:13] waited for the manifestation of the sons
[2:16:15] of God isn't that right wait waiting for
[2:16:18] the manifestation of the sons of God it
[2:16:20] is waiting for the church to come into
[2:16:22] this position waiting God trying to
[2:16:26] place his church in position to manifest
[2:16:30] himself you see this is very important

[2:24:06] Christ the ministry of Jesus Christ is
[2:24:09] to catch the

[2:24:51] that accompanied Jesus Christ by that
[2:24:52] pill of fire that had him anointed is
[2:24:55] accompanying the church today so the
[2:24:58] church mashup and all these
[2:25:00] disagreements and all these arguments
[2:25:02] and bring no one and shake and whatnot

[2:25:25] coming y that was brought the church
[2:25:27] into the place he's praying now father
[2:25:30] we realize that the church has come
[2:25:32] through the stage of justification come
[2:25:34] to the stage of sanctification come to
[2:25:35] the stage of the receiving of the Holy
[2:25:37] Spirit now the stones are being honed
[2:25:39] down for the fitting of the ministry of
[2:25:42] Jesus Christ to blend in to take the
[2:25:45] church and we get that last week
[2:25:46] Wednesday that Holy Spirit slot my
[2:25:50] almost finished but see could come up to
[2:25:52] the piano when a man in The Foundry is
[2:25:55] making a bell he has got a certain tone
[2:25:58] he has to put in it when he is setting
[2:26:01] this mold and putting his iron puts in
[2:26:03] so much brass so much steel so much
[2:26:05] coule why he knows exactly how much to
[2:26:07] put in and that's what Jesus has done by
[2:26:10] his bride he had to put in so much
[2:26:11] Luther so much Methodist so much
[2:26:13] Presbyterian so much Pentecost in it but
[2:26:15] what does he comes out with his own
[2:26:17] reflection what is it just like the
[2:26:20] pyramid message you see it's heaping
[2:26:23] right up this come to the minority with
[2:26:25] the headstone the ministry of Jesus
[2:26:28] Christ on Earth has to be the
[2:26:31] same as the ministry he had or he can't
[2:26:36] come to it just like the head to the
[2:26:38] feet the head feet is not the head but
[2:26:41] the head packs the feet the makes the
[2:26:43] feet tells it where to go wesy was a
[2:26:45] great light okay justification service
[2:26:48] time sanctification justification under
[2:26:50] Luther it had to come to sanctification
[2:26:52] under Wesley and sanctification service
[2:26:54] time until we come to the baptism of the
[2:26:56] Holy Ghost and the baptism of the Holy
[2:26:59] Ghost serve its time until the Holy
[2:27:01] Spirit which is only one God Blends into
[2:27:04] the church and the church into Christ it
[2:27:06] makes Jesus Christ reflected on the
[2:27:08] earth what he
[2:27:09] promised oh my I'm
[2:27:13] closing what ties all this together just
[2:27:17] referring and then we're going to close
[2:27:18] up you could begin to play something
[2:27:20] softly but even
[2:27:23] David anointed in the presence of his
[2:27:27] Brethren
[2:27:30] private literally and
[2:27:33] unknown God will Design the
[2:27:36] environment for David to come
