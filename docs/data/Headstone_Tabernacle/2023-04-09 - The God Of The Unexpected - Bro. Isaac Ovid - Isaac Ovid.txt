Bethlehem Tabernacle you're certainly blessed by Brother yadel Cornell and brother Stephen Oliveri may God continue to bless them and use them we had quite a time in the presence of the Lord and we were so blessed and privileged with the hospitality over the green and the church Bethlehem Tabernacle and the fellowship and it was really a wonderful time in the presence of the Lord and we are here one more time on a Easter Sunday just realizing that it's quite a few times we haven't had the Easter Sunday like this with the whole pandemic and that kind of stuff so we are in for a time this morning we are looking for God to do something beyond our expectation beyond our imagination I don't know what you came to do but I came to get something more from the Lord I came to climb higher than I've ever climbed before I'm not here to preach to you I'm preaching to myself Hallelujah because I need something from the Lord and I don't know about you but I believe you need something in the Lord as well and we want to hear direct from God this morning him to speak to our hearts Hallelujah because it's the rising of the sun it's Easter one more time and if there ever was a time to give God praise and shouting and thanks is this time so shake away the tiredness shake away the lethargy and for the moments we have together in this service let's give it a hundred percent can the church semen thank you so much musicians thank you brother Anthony for the wonderful worship service and the music systems and the musical so can we go to our Bibles reading First Corinthians chapter one and reading first Peter 2 for scripture readings this morning amen reading First Corinthians chapter 1 and reading verse 18 and as I read the scripture I remember about a Terence salutable deterrence and Tamara Terry preach on this and such a blessing First Corinthians 1 verse 18 for the preaching of the Cross is to them that perish foolishness but unto us which are saved it is the power of God so unto them that perish it's foolishness but to us which I save it is the power of God for it is written I will destroy the wisdom of the wise and I will bring to nothing the understanding of The Prudent where is the wise where is describe where is the disputer of this world hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world for after that in the wisdom of God the World by wisdom knew not God in other words the total wisdom of this world could never understand God they can study it they could analyze it they could try to figure it out but after they graduated all the wisdom you could acquire here and the Earth you will never understand God but it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching oh Hallelujah so we're here for some foolishness this morning it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe for the Jews require a sign and the Greeks seek after wisdom but we preach Christ crucified unto the Jews a stumbling block and unto the Greek's foolishness Hallelujah many people will think we are foolish this morning many people think you're wasting your time going to church many people think you're wasting your time committing your life and your energy and your strength to this gospel but to us who understand it's our life it's our strength it's our joy it's our peace height sounds crazy oh I might look crazy you wake up on a Sunday morning to come to church and nobody could understand you but unto them which are called Jews and Greeks Christ the power and God and the wisdom of God verse 24 25 because the foolishness of God come on young people it's wiser than men and the weakness of God if you can find a weakness the weakness of God is stronger than men for he see your calling Brethren how that not many wise men after the flesh not many mighty not many noble are called but God had chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise and God had chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things that are Mighty and the base things of the world and things which are despised had God chosen yea and things which are not to bring to nor things that are may the Lord had a blessing to the reading of his word and reading first Peter chapter 2 and reading verse 9 First Peter chapter 2 and reading verse 9 but ye are a chosen generation a royal priesthood and a holy nation A peculiar people that he should show for the Praises of him who are called you out of Darkness Into His Marvelous Light which in time past were not a people but are now the people of God which had not attained Mercy but now have obtained Mercy may the Lord had a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated in the house of the Lord this morning and we are so happy this morning to see what God is going to do I have a title this morning the god of the unexpected the god of the unexpected and for a subject unexpected ways unexpected places an unexpected times and an inspiration transfer of power transfer of power and I chose this text the god of the unexpected because Easter morning was unexpected when Jesus rose from the dead not even the disciples expected it they were astonished even though they had heard messages about it when it actually happened the reality of it was a lot for them to even process because they didn't think it was going to happen but I don't want to really talk too much about the disciples yet I want to go back all the way to the beginning because God has always been the god of the unexpected and God has always used the unexpected he has a way of doing things in an unexpected way in unexpected places and at unexpected times and that's how God has always operated because if something is expected then you could do something about it but when something is unexpected then you really don't know how to treat with it and God loves to work around what the devil is trying to do and you have to realize that the devil has always been trying to do something since he was up in heaven try to overthrow but then when he tried to overthrow and he had an expectation that because he didn't try to overthrow thinking he's going to lose he went to try to overthrow thinking he could get power to himself but he had an expectation but a joy that he would have win this battle but he didn't realize that the god of the unexpected had some Sons who did something that was unexpected these Sons draw their swords and against the expectation that the devil had that he was going to win up there these sons did the unexpected and they kicked the devil Out of Heaven and send the devil down on the earth and then God started to keep doing the unexpected because when Satan came on the earth he thought he was going to rule the Satan thought this was his territory he was walking here and then God placed man on the earth and God did one again the unexpected by giving man power on the earth God has never wanted to keep his power for himself we have preached so many times within God was locked up the power to heal the power to deliver the power to restore the power to redeem the power to baptize the power to save the power to heal the power to open prison bars but God didn't have nobody he was a laptop he had nobody he was sick he had nobody he could have seen the song of Amazing Grace so God had to make a way for this thing to happen and this thing to unfold him and God gave power to this man called Adam and Adam was given Dominion to rule it to rule his life to rule his house to be just like his father a transfer of power took place Hallelujah that's my inspiration a transfer of power took place and Adam had power Adam had Authority he didn't have to go to God for permission to move a mountain he didn't have to go to God for permission to name an animal he didn't have to go to God for permission because he was given power there was a transfer of power and Adam under inspiration could decide where he wanted the mountain to be he could decide where he wanted the trees to be he could decide how he wanted things to look if he didn't like how the mountain looked yesterday in that spot he had the power to move the mountain to decide he didn't have to turn around his chair if he wanted to change his view he could have just change his view without turning around his chair because he could move mountains and move streams and move Rivers but Satan infiltrated God's Eden but God was not surprised Satan expected friends that when man fell that was it that the power would have moved to him but we know through the preaching of the message that the unexpected happened and when Satan thought he would catch the deed to control the Earth it slipped out of his hand the unexpected happened and the god of the unexpected took back the power that he had given to Adam and that power left man and went back into the hands of the original owner so Satan thought that he could have outsmarted God and had gotten access to the power but that power is reserved only for some sons and some daughters who were in the thoughts in the back part of God's mind so from way back in Eden God has always had a mission to transfer power one more time back to man who would have dominion so since the Garden of Eden call us had one objective God doesn't want to rule this Earth this Earth is not his jurisdiction Heaven is his jurisdiction the Bible said the Earth Is His footstool but this Earth belongs to some people who are supposed to have the authority God didn't give a minion to the Earth to himself he gave Dominion to man him you don't hear me this morning the dominion over crawling things creeping things situations God didn't give it to angels He didn't keep it to himself he said I'm putting you man to have dominion dominion over everything power over everything control over everything [Applause] Hallelujah Hallelujah so I want you to catch something friends we're talking about unexpected ways unexpected places unexpected times unexpected things that's why I read the scripture in First Peter that hear our chosen generation that was unexpected Hallelujah nobody thought God would choose you nobody thought God would choose me if you look at your book report your family history what your grandfather did what your great grandfather did with your great great great great grandmother did nobody would say God would ever choose you they are so much trough in your closet in your father Closet in your grandparents closet you were not born in this natural world from a line that was deserving of this blessing but God still say you are a chosen generation and the devil cannot understand that because it's unexpected or you don't hear me this morning oh Hallelujah and the same way Easter was unexpectedly going to get to it you'd think if Jesus if the devil knew Jesus was going to race from the dead and what is going to happen as a consequence he was going to allow that to happen God did you unexpected and is but but a joy is about time Satan understand that God is a good to be unexpected you know because every single time the devil try to do something to stop God's movement God does the unexpected there has never been a time so when man fell and God looked at man and the devil looked at man the devil saying look again and God's saying well look what I'm gonna do now look what I'm gonna do now I'm gonna make a way for them to get right back there they fell but I'm gonna do the unexpected I'm still gonna use man I'm not gonna throw him away God said Adam where are you you know the devil taught God is going to leave and I'm there to just fall apart but God did he unexpected he said Adam are looking for you Adam where you're hiding I don't where you went I come down for fellowship and you're not here Adam what you're doing you're not in your position you're not in your place you're not worshiping you're not shouting and I'm not gonna just leave you to do what you want to come and look in for you Adam you have to do something we have to do something about this situation and I didn't invest so much into you to allow this to fall and I'm not going to let the devil allow this to fall so I'm gonna do the unexpected I'm gonna find a way to get you back to Eden I'm gonna find a way to restore your line even though you fall I'm gonna send another man who's gonna raise back this line again I'm gonna find somebody else to undo what the devil did it's gonna be an unexpected thing in an unexpected way at an unexpected time with the unexpected people oh Hallelujah you don't hear me this morning oh Hallelujah [Music] and throughout scripture I'm gonna jump all over this morning but I want you to understand that the objective of man falling and the objective of sin was to drive to one thing death because the only way Satan could have held people was through death he couldn't get access to anybody until you died so the devil had one objective death because death was an automatic transfer into his territory and God said you know what I'm gonna do I'm gonna use this same thing called that I'm going to use this same death thing or the devil think you have control over so for all those Generations all those ages all those Heroes of Faith died and they went into this holding place this paradise place and the devil felt pretty comfortable because he had the keys to death and health so he was comfortable that it will all come in there he did not expect that he was going to lose control over that jurisdiction because he had the keys to death and hell but when Jesus came he said I come in to do a secret work a secret mission and the only way I could get access to those who have fallen before I have to go to the same way the devil think I should go so Jesus was looking at death one way and the devil looking at death another way Satan is thinking that if Jesus died he will go and get locked up just like Joseph locked up just like Isaiah locked up just like Moses it is he had an expectation of what was going to happen but Jesus had a unexpected or you don't hear me this morning he's a god of the unexpected so he is walking to Calvary and the devil is saying look at him oh gosh account unknown to this Cross of Calvary I'm counting down to Jesus dying and God is saying I'm counting down to Jesus dying oh you don't hear me this morning when you go to your trial the devil ticket is going to finish you and God is saying accounting unto your child because it's going to get you stronger and the same trap the devil think he has for you is the same thing God wants to use for you oh come on now you don't hear me this morning so the same Cross of Calvary Satan is looking at this cross and he's happy you know in every age when the devil did something fingers going to win he thought the plan was going to work out you know I want you to catch this for a minute Satan taught every plan he had was going to work out he's telling me Troy Daniel and Alliance then and right there in the Lion's Den the god of the unexpected stepped into the lion's den you don't you don't hear me this morning the God will be unexpected in an unexpected way in an unexpected place at the unexpected time and the lion say but wait a minute it's an unexpected man boy this man different I can't eat this man because it's an unexpected thing inside of this man those Hebrew boys they were walking they didn't know how God was going to do it but they knew they were servingly God of the unexpected they didn't know when it's going to deliver they were comfortable to die but the god of the unexpected came in an unexpected place at an unexpected time in an unexpected way and the god of the unexpected stood there with them in the fiery furnace and they were not burned he loves to do the unexpected he loves to disrupt plans and programs he loves to change things around he loves to do what listen you should have been dead already but the god of the unexpected has made a way for you to be here listen the devil didn't expect you to be here this morning he thought that you were going to sit down at home and say this is just another day but the god of the unexpected he made a way to create an unexpected outcome yes you're gonna get the Holy Ghost we read the scripture a royal priesthood a chosen generation A peculiar people which the Bible says which in times past were not a people in other people oh you don't hear me in the time passed you would not have been considered but God had to do the unexpected and get a group of people to finish this great work that the devil will not expect oh you don't hear me this morning he had to find people who went through all kind of situations went through drugs went through last step went through pornography went to the Baptist Church went to the Methodist Church went to all kind of false teaching went to Carnival bands went to a kind of situation grew up in message grew up outside of the message or kind of situation but the god of the unexpected said I'm gonna find a way an unexpected way maybe your old-fashioned service maybe on a street corner maybe somebody gonna invite you maybe you're gonna find a book maybe you're gonna hear a tape maybe somebody's gonna invite you to church it's gonna be an unexpected way in an unexpected service at an unexpected time when you think it's just a normal service it's an unexpected day an unexpected time this is not just a normal Easter Service no it's an unexpected day unexpected time unexpected way [Applause] they thought it was just a normal day but that Easter morning they could not have expected what was happening they could not have expected that he was not there in the Tomb they went there to take care of the body and when they got there he was not there he was not there they expected him to be there but he was not there the devil expected you to be dead [Applause] but the god of the unexpected he is very much alive and the god of the unexpected said listen because I live you are gonna live also and the same work that I do you see the devil didn't even expect you to be able to say it but the secret is the word is in the bride you know who you are you know what you're called to do you know what you're born to do and listen when you're feeling sick and you worship God that's unexpected when you come to church and you have no money in your bank account that is unexpected when the devil thinks that it was a sit down dead in the church and you get up and you stand up and you move a little bit that's unexpected do something different this morning do the unexpected this morning if you never move your shoulder like this [Applause] or you don't hear me this morning audition make the Baptist shout they should make the evil come on now somebody help me I might preach on the black I don't know what's going to happen this morning but we're on an unexpected day unexpected way unexpected Place unexpected time [Applause] you may be seated [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] before Saul became Paul nobody would have expected Brotherhood that this would be the messenger for the church each he was there when Stephen was stoned he was there persecuting the Brethren but one day this man called Saul was on his road to Damascus and an unexpected thing happened it was an unexpected way in an unexpected place on an unexpected time and yet an unexpected visitor he wasn't even looking for Jesus he wasn't planning to see Jesus he didn't expect to see Jesus but on the road to Damascus on the road to Damascus an unexpected day in unexpected way in an unexpected place the unexpected God met a man who had no expectation oh God help me this morning this would make the most broken person shout because you can come with no expectation and the god of on the acts unexpected could meet you [Applause] [Music] [Applause] you have to forgive me this morning and Saul was no fool he said Jesus he said who are you Lord I'm Jesus who you persecute and God sent this man to get prayed for but a punch I want you to imagine the next Sunday service when them brothers see the man who was now saw no call Paul they didn't expect to see him in church but it was an unexpected service and Paul came in an unexpected way because you're still an unexpected God and although they might have had problems with Paul they have to take note that the God will be unexpected had taken somebody their rule out somebody that counted out I was going to find a way to use him and in the same way God could take somebody who is unexpected there's a preacher inside of here who we don't know there's a prophetess inside of here who we don't know there's somebody inside of here who God gonna use that we don't even know about it yet because that's how God loves operate there's some ways about to be healed in this service that we don't know about it yet we're going to hear about it as another praise because I have to believe that it got to be unexpected will keep doing unexpected things it's one thing about him we know for sure he doesn't change and if he has always operated in an unexpected way we could expect him to do it again and again and again and again you remember the Stephen Paul amen sister Jewel what we know for sure he do it again we don't know how because he always had unexpected way but we know it's going to happen how he's going to do is going to be unexpected he could openly Red Sea he could walk on the water which one you want him to do he could do anyone but if you need to get to you he get to you whether you walk on water openly Red Sea he could do it he could build a boat like Noah he could do what he wants to do unexpected way unexpected things unexpected places it could be in your you could be driving on the car on your way to work next week and then all of a sudden unexpected place [Applause] Paul and Silas in prison it is expected that when you're in prison you feel down you feel depressed you'll abandon you feel alone but at the Midnight Hour unexpected time an unexpected place this has to do an unexpected thing that in the midst of the child has started to get started to do the unexpected and when you do the unexpected the god of the unexpected begins to respond to you doing the unexpected [Music] and the prison doors start to open up and whenever the prison so you see God here he unexpectedly sleeping every door open it was so powerful that when they got back to the Believers the Believers didn't even expect them they said it had to be their ghosts because of the unexpected Hallelujah you know what this means we have to lift your expectation our expectations are too low we have to lift and it's harder no because God has been so high Hallelujah somebody gives the Lord a shout out praise [Applause] when Jesus came he brought the unexpected message he said you have heard it before but I say unto you love your enemies do good at the damn that curse you offend you hurt you they say what can I preach against this is not what we expected Jesus started his preaching in an unexpected way he said his Spirit of the Lord is upon me for here that part they could have expected it because he wasn't the first person to find where it was written but when he finished reading he did the unexpected he said this day this scripture is fulfilled that was unexpected do you know any devil has an expectation of you School teachers have expedition of their students when people write the report they say when you finish school likely to succeed that's an expectation and somebody right I don't even know you have most likely to succeed most likely to achieve this yeah somebody say I don't even know now when you you don't even know what to expect for some of you right if they do get help trouble somebody has seen him at a young age trouble there's something about defying expectation to be successful in business you need to be able to find a way to do the unexpected to win a war you have to study and find a way to do the unexpected friends if you're fighting a war and every time you try to attack the enemy expecting you You're Gonna Lose You Know and that is scriptural no because remember when Elisha was here and the king of Syria and then was trying to to fight something and they say but wait a minute every time you try to attack teacher in Israel and then we're losing as if they're reading our plans because Elisha was seeing what's going on before it happened so they couldn't outsmart they couldn't plan because in while in a secret chamber God given the prophet of God in sight into what's happening so in our natural lives you have to find a way to do the unexpected no we're not saying this for points huh but Friday morning I get up pretty early and I decided to go and fry some eggs and things before my wife wake up I'd only say I do do it often but it was unexpected fries I'm such a dissenting and it was unexpected what I did not expect was when she saw that she asked me if I wanted to cook for the brunch now that was unexpected but the point I want to make is this if you want your marriage to be successful yeah correct right on this road or should I hit a reverse if you want your marriage but you have to find ways to do the unexpected one Valentine's and I'll tell you which one I went and buy some things and my wife said to me well I appreciate the robot I feel they do it with like form like you just do it won't tell you the one you're not preach a week or so but we're finding a soft answer but the issue was it I didn't go unexpected enough so it was unexpected but it wasn't high on the unexpected scale because it more unexpected it is you created the experience of I can't even believe you do that boy because to be truly unexpected you have to put thought and effort on different things into it and I want you to understand that the reality is this life God interrupts Our Lives because somehow our lives just get too predictable they say in terms of security and defense they say a certain drive home the same exact way all the time you ever hear that before you have the exact pattern all the time that is a problem you have to change it up a little bit in other words when you set a duty unexpected because I want you to appreciate where I'm going with this the devil has a expectation of how you're going to operate I want you to honor any Devil Knows Your timetable and your schedule when you wake up he takes note When you pray he takes note I wonder if he has any notes this morning of your prayer because if currently I'm not rebuking here you have much notes on your prayer life then I want you to start to do the unexpected and let it devil say hold on hold on love me or something something changed so never gone away because normally I was right in this spot he gets up and he go to Facebook and I get together and checking news and getting coffee and the last human thing I already had known reason to write pray any schedule but all of a sudden I'm writing something unexpected and when you break pattern the devil doesn't know what to do because that's where you can live a life by the brown City never don't know what to do with you because he tried every day he writes I didn't get frustrated I can't write no more because he praying here he prayed here I look for him here he praying I thought he's got me on Facebook hell here we praying I Tony is going to get back to the white boy praying he shouldn't be there and doing something in the job but somehow he listened that tape when he's supposed to be frustrated he's smiling expected do you realize that when Jesus came his life was just an unexpected life he was just breaking the patterns when nobody thought think it happened somebody he messed up that he breaks tradition Ally traditionals he said only have this thing and and that's why I realized why but I'm preach against organized religion so much because when you organize things there's no spirit in there but when he could be free to move it in spirit and he could sing a song you could do an instrumental you could you could see read a poem you could you could you could write on your car I love Jesus you just had to do things you ever see a cafe game out and that's why I want to be no Lord help me Lord I don't want my wife I want God I would only devil to bring him out because I want to do the unexpected you know how much the devil gets upset when you're supposed to be sad and you say Lord I will praise you the whole challenge to job was to curse God and die and even his wife was leaning to that expectation she said why you don't do it because everything was looking like the formula was equal because going on there you know you lose this you lose this you lose this you lose this the equality was just waiting to write it out you know are we still waiting and then job daddy unexpected so these skin worms destroy my body yet in my flesh I will see God the Lord Give the Lord take away blessed be the name of the Lord when job taught he could get upset he's something else the unexpected came over him and he began to Worship in the midst of the situation and that's how you overcame that's why the key to your overcoming is your worship the kids are overcoming is your prayers the key to your overcoming as you shouting and jumping and and being happy all the time and being in an atmosphere because God know you love him he loves when they talk about him he loves any Fellowship about him he loved on your praise him he loves when you worship Him He loves when he acknowledge Him for you oh can the church say Amen many many men from the message a door inside the door brother Branham said I'm not going to be too much longer with you but you know God is unusual God does things in an unusual way at an unusual time in an unusual Place sometimes the unusual people God is unusual he does the unexpected many times oh Amber Ibraham said in the unchangeable god working in an unexpectable way speaking about how Jesus came into Jerusalem he says scriptures just fulfill of Us coming the way he will come but they fail to see it see he did the Messianic sign prove that he was Messiah and they rejected it because he came in an unexpected way to them he was too humble he was too lowly he was too meek Hallelujah was it a king to lead them out from under the Romans but he said my kingdom is out of this world and I come into fight the political around when I come and fight the government no no no I come in for the kingdom of the most high the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand the kingdom of the Lord is at hand that's what I've come for not the kingdom of this world the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand and I'm looking for citizens of that Kingdom who will be a royal priesthood who will be a holy nation who will be a peculiar people who will separate themselves from all kind of uncleanness who will separate themselves from filthiness who will separate themselves from all these things of the world that's who I'm coming for people who know there's more to life than money more to life than business more to life than family More Alive than that the doctor can only help you so much but the great physician can help you all the way that there's a life beyond this life that you can put on this body but there's another one waiting somewhere and he can give you access to that new body he gave you access a new work a new talk a new life a new experience a new Joy a new peace a new victory A New Hope a new expectation oh Hallelujah somebody's saving oh hallelujah hallelujah oh Hallelujah God chooses the unexpected he took a prostitute called Rahab and he used the unexpected oh come on somebody help me when Samson was on the earth they took and they tried to block him up in the gate and the expectation was that he gave they put brother Stephen was going to be enough to contain him and then the god of the unexpected Came Upon This Man Called Samson and he moved the whole gate well that was that that was unexpected they sent us what three thousand men brother punch to Corner Samson every time they send men to Corner somebody before they got them they send men with shields and Spares and helmets and weapons to get one man with a Sheen and when they're surrounded as one man the unexpected came over Samson and Samson did the unexpected because he was working with the god of the unexpected and in an unexpected way on an unexpected day in unexpected time he cleaned up 3 000 men but Abraham said they were dead brass helmets and with the job one of our donkey he did the unexpected should have crumbled into pieces but when you take natural things and put it into the hands of the god of the unexpected then unexpected things begin to happen and that Jawbone became a powerful weapon a weapon of mass destruction it was one man on a Jawbone this is a story you know you hear a news reporter in an unlikely turn of events in an unlikely to the event you know you can read the whole Bible like that Joshua fighting his battle sun going down it gets in too dark and in an unlikely to Live Events Joshua Spin and say a son stand still and the god of the unexpected did an unexpected thing this had never happened before I want you to appreciate how much of the Bible never happened before Joshua didn't have anybody to reference that they did that before but the god of the unexpected loves to do things that were never done before and set a new president break a new record oh come on now that's what makes Easter so powerful you know because when Jesus died in the ground did not expect you know the undo button when you do something I never undo button the devil told her when Jesus died that was it you know you call your car undo it and when Jesus died before the undo button because when Jesus died by a punch not only the undo but may say no but he went down into hell and the devil who was celebrating didn't expect anybody else in the party because he had everybody locked up he said who knocking on the door then he said the door kick open and see a man with no spare no shield no sword [Applause] blood all over him god of the unexpected Mighty conqueror he's just walking in all them demons for years wrecking Havoc over the Earth and this one man just walk up past this demon pass this bodyguard pass this demon and lost this demon of pornography this demon of sickness cancer went to the corner leukemia went to that side female condition he went to hide back pain went running oh come on now somebody help me this morning the demon are lying he went under a table the demon adult he leave the room [Applause] depressed when he first oh come on now the demon of frustration he started to understand what frustration really is he gave that dose of his own medicine and the mighty conqueror he just had to walk down he walked past this devil this devil why are you walking all them here in Paradise Joseph and Joshua and Moses and Isaiah they say that looking like you're wheeling in the middle of the wheel that looking like the rap you need a rock who is that walking there he has no show no Fanfare with humility and Power Authority and control the mighty conqueror the king of all ages the King of Kings Lord of lords Mighty in battle lion of the tribe of Judah [Applause] Jehovah Rapha Jehovah Nissi the Creator the bright and Morning Star the alphan the Omega he walk in he coming for something here there by accident he's not there by chance in a dare to make us so he not dare to have a guest appearance he knows that Through the Ages man has been locked up by death This Thing Called Death this thing this fear Called Death this death it was an automatic passageway to the devil the devil holding the keys of death and Hell the devil don't know what Jesus gonna do because this is the god of the unexpected the devil don't know what to expect what he's seeing he never expected so you don't know what to do he foreign if you want to see a picture of the devil Frozen in action is that picture when Jesus walking inside a hell you devil can't move he got try a thing the devil is tied Bound by circumstance Bound by fear Bound By The Mighty conqueror something happens when Jesus begins to walk on two feet in the midst of trials in the midst of problems in the midst of situations you don't hear me this morning Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah the devil knew that Jesus had power over sickness this was a new to the devil before Jesus came nobody Castle there was no [Music] read the Bible before Jesus came nobody Castle Devils the most they did was when David was there driving Devils by his music but casting them out and saying come out devil this was the first time the devil had people coming back had sent some time ago somebody on Earth sent me back what you mean send me back well I don't know is there somebody up there who's sending people back what do you mean send back who who up there I don't know all I know I was there one day and then I wasn't because he said get out and I have nowhere to go so I'll come back [Applause] because the Devil Himself didn't know when the devil measure you say if thou B he did really read it if don't be trying to figure you out boy you're moving different something about you if don't be the Son of God and Jesus Martin or not it's a man challenge by bread alone every word the devil looking back straight answer you know and this will confuse the devil because you're here this morning and you are giving my answer the kind of mistakes you make you if don't be because you know we do last week last month and listen the devil thinking that is counting against you and God saying but how I wanted boy because all things work together for good behind their mistakes I have a plan behind their affiliate I have a plan behind it oh you don't hear me this morning [Applause] [Music] so I wanted a picture with a huge Jesus down there in hell and then they will get kicked out to him that is him telling him or the devil you see he was asking me who sent me back is he and then they will say well we you imagine you ever see a situation where you know this is a big gangster and the big answer behind everybody else and you see what attack them now anybody God save all night out of it out of it all them big bad body men say good I good I good you haven't seen a drink in the Next Room I go and put somebody to eat yes to the devil dear nobody guys know and Jesus just woke up and grab the keys the keys are dead the keys are hell that is the keys to the devil own world he take it you know how embarrassing that is to be in your house and I walk into your house and take your keys to your house so I could walk in anytime walk out anytime I could walk in this morning and take something out this morning so when the prophet was here he can say House of hell he gave away literally oh you don't hear me this morning we can walk in anytime and grab anybody out from the clutches of the devil that's why there's power in the church over sickness over diseases over doubt overlust over fear over unclean spirits I don't care what Spirit you came and hear this with we have the keys the keys of power you could go free if you want to go free you can go free if you want to go free you can go free if you want to go free you have to forgive me [Applause] and God only keys for himself you know you don't need the keys to himself the keys is for man the keys for his sons he went Peter got a revelation he said Upon This Rock I will build my church and the Gates of Hell will not Prevail and unto you I give you the keys whatever you buying on Earth I will honor it and buying it in heaven and whatever you lose on Earth I will honor it and lose it in heaven all you have to do is speak so you want to go free this morning you are free and we bind every Spirit of lust every Spirit of lion every Spirit of black biting every Spirit of a gossip every Spirit of fornication every Spirit of adultery every Spirit of Doubt depression fear sickness disease whatever it is we come against it with the same power that was released on Resurrection Sunday morning [Applause] I'm almost done [Applause] to God of the unexpected but that was a secret mission because the whole purpose the whole plan was not for Jesus to come and do these things the whole Ministry the whole purpose the whole objective was about getting this power into the hands of a people it was about the transfer of power the first transfer didn't work because Adam fell and It reversed the transfer you know you do online transfer to somebody anything the money come back so any devil taught you as one gate he never had to spend anything you know spendingly not his money the money went back into the bank account after the original owner charges reversed and over all of the ages all God could do is a little transfer a temporary transfer somebody just keep them going until he finds somebody he could transfer the whole thing to so that's why Samson brother and we could have a little he had a little transfer Joshua Earl transfer he's like God getting my little credit card with a limit they could spend a certain amount but God not in the limited business you know God credit card have no limit and in this age you're giving you a card with no limit yeah in their age was card with limits but in this edges have god with no limit you know maybe nobody experienced it maybe went to pave us another card and it ain't hoping and going through maybe it's not anybody here went through that maybe nobody said why are you looking like you're so Italian hoping this thing just and then when it goes through it's like yes Lord but if I say right now we lay hands on your sick he said but when that time comes and they have the unlimited card you say you command the devil so go [Music] [Applause] you see right now you're saying Jesus name but when that I come you speak because it'll be Flesh of My Flesh born of my bone to a one I am my father are one you have to say in Jesus name because that new name will be a new locked up you dare speak so throughout all the ages God handed out cards with limits but when Jesus came all I was in God he has a pattern over a point he said oh that was in God he poured it into Christ [Applause] and the first unlimited credit cards had to walk around healing [Applause] Deliverance one time Jesus preaching neighbors like today and and and and he said oh God he saves going so good we go in a while I said before that I wasn't going to be too long well that just changed he said to go for a while people you say whatever anything they said I'm a little boy here like I don't even Mommy he'd have five love and two fishes one of the Deacons are not picking anything what are these among so many I just said bring it and he pulled all the unlimited card and he blessed it and you know you have the arm you know you had the the tap thing now and when you press it but you just tap that card and when you tap it it changed on his personal we say brothers and they give it to brother Antonio give it to her points they give it this is a civil to give this sister I didn't call her name last week so I'll call her name this week to give a disappearing sister Judith gonna give it to some Viviana wait a minute How come every time I take out the basket account [Music] [Applause] you know they say where they have money you don't even know when somebody have money when they want to ask the price you're walking me I say I want data where the prices don't tell me the price I want that I want I don't need to know the price I want that I wonder you know I don't need to know the price this card unlimited just give me that give me that give me that but you can carry it home don't worry I'll take a truck you have a truck in the back I've taken that too put any card put any card put any card place any card press any card close I take it now take it up put in a card and that's how when he said to operate this way healing put that in the car too my children put them in the car [Music] my career position buy him out too you don't hear me this morning I'm buying the whole company put a company on the car too Boston over in pretty boss in a bag [Applause] Hallelujah on your child your trouble put it in the back put it there put it there put it in because of unlimited card do you understand it's unlimited power in for this church super Church super race as we near The Headstone there'll be so much like him it is very image that's the power that's not coming to be ready code last week Sunday that's now coming in I'll be so so a quick message save the whole nation [Applause] [Music] trying to find a place to close out but unexpected people in an unexpected way Abraham's testimony was unexpected and throughout scripture but ibraham's life was a life of unexpected if you go through some possibility you have to wonder how a man of God to reach so depressed till he came to the point he wanted to kill his own self but when he tried he quoted the unexpected he said put a gun to my head foreign because nothing could ever stop the plan of God nothing could stop the plan of God the doctors report of God prison can't stop the plan Accord money or no money cast out the plan of God sickness cannot stop the plan of God depression cannot stop the plan of God the children giving all the trouble in the world cannot stop the power of God I don't care they're drunk this morning cannot stop the plan of God I don't care if they in sin they cannot stop the plan of God I don't care if they reject God it cannot stop the plan of God [Applause] [Music] I am putting it to you this morning that when Jesus stood at the grave of Lazarus if a man who was dead could have no control he had nothing to say about punch when Jesus got there four days later he said roll already Stone nobody who was there had an expectation what is going to happen next least of all Lazarus because I shall understand what Lazarus went through you know it's one thing will punch with the people who was there seriously you know because Lazarus who taught but is it for me Brethren C on the other side yes [Music] all these songs and everything but wait a minute what I feel anyway I'm feeling something I want you to process it in a Lazarus there wrapped up trying to open his eyes instead of a tomb and I preachers years ago he can't even walk properly because he tied up and Lazarus come out there trying to figure out what's going on and Jesus said lose him and let him go Lazarus himself had no power to control him even coming back because the voice of the Resurrection had already spoken to him and when the voice of the Resurrection speaks undo it it's like when the word is spoken upon your life you can't undo it when the blessing is spoken about you you can't undo it nothing you could do could change your word or prophecy about your life because having an outer pathway but this word could never pass away and it's like an arrow that is shot from the ball you could only stop it before the arago but when I will leave [Music] and every time you come to church brother popwell is arosen or being shot right now we're shooting arrows at your house right now we shoot Arrow this morning on your children right now and again hit all over and they're trying to understand why they're feeling convicted why they're feeling so why we're good something just pulling them that's the power of prayer it's arrows being shot this morning that's why you don't have to worry that's right off the Fret because God is in control of these things can the church say Amen Let me find a place to close are they enjoying the law this morning I'm trying to find a place that goes out the musicians could begin to get ready hallelujah hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah so we're preaching about this thing so death death was the great divider that was that thing that was stopping everybody from going Beyond a certain point it was understood that when he died I was able when Jesus came he'd use the same thing the devil thought was his tool to pull people to himself Jesus went to the same channel of death but he was the only one who walked through the road until macaron and walked back out and when he did that on Resurrection morning he opened the key to the transfer of power and the same law and the same principle that the devil thought he could have used is the same law and principle that God also used so God wrote a will and in that will he write certain things that would apply to certain people in my death I want to pass on some property when I die I passing on some accounts are passing on some power that is vested in me when I die I want to make sure that certain things that I have get passed on one of the things I want to pass on is this unlimited credit card and to my wife I leave my unlimited credit card whatever you're buying on earth born in heaven whatever you lose on Earth lose in heaven same words that I do you're gonna do also as my father sent me so saying that you always locked up and he will super Church super race you and your children so this will is Broad it's specific but it Broad so we'll be preaching the only world and any end will come but this is until you answer your children the damage are far off not just physically far far in mind fine Spirit they don't want to hear from you or from God but it's unto them as well locked up in this will but the only way this will could be read is if he died so when Jesus died the world went into effect immediately and what was not transferable before was now available to be transferred but this was so important to God's sister Marilyn that he says a need because every will has an executor and the role of the executor is to make sure that they obey what he will say is supposed to happen the job of the executor is to ensure that the property that's supposed to come to you comes to you [Music] and Jesus said listen I will send my own executor and when Jesus died rose again and left he come back as the executor in spirit form he said yes a little while and the world will see me no more but you are going to see me he said I'm going to be with you even in you so the executor who not only come to confirm and enforce what is in the will he also knows the will inside her because he want to rule you will and he said by these precious promises that's in this will you could become partakers of this divine nature this Divine walk this Divine Life this Divine experience and he put into this world what you read in First Peter but he our chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation A peculiar people that he should show for the Praises of him who had called you out of Darkness Into His Marvelous Light in other words in that will he write some names brother Clarence or people who weren't even born yet who formally in darkness but by virtue of this will being enforced they can walk into a Marvelous Light which in time past were not a people so he slipped into that well and unexpected people who he would meet in an unexpected way the unexpected time and do an unexpected thing through an unexpected profit with an unexpected message in 2023 they could come and have an unexpected service to get a Holy Ghost that will be in their soul that will give them an unexpected life that will make them people who will forgive which will be unexpected make them a people who will love in a different kind of love that will be unexpected because there'll be no love except for a love inside a bride can the Church Say Amen oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah so that is transfer of power could bring back Authority and control and jurisdiction because the job of the executor is not to do the work of what the will is supposed to enforce it's just to make sure the powers get transferred so the executing of the work itself belongs to those to whom the power have been transferred so the power of God is to enjoy power is transferred and once the power is transferred like if I train my daughter to run the business is to allow her to run the business so either to run the business that's what adoption is about so God can say your check is as good as the father's check I do expect to write all the checks if you hear and you can write check too you with me so the job of the Holy Ghost and the tutor and the training is to bring you to a state that you can also operate like the father to ease up the work and the father so the father can say this is my beloved Son and whom I'm well please so God's whole objective and Mission and purpose of this whole Plan of Redemption and this whole resurrection and this release of power is to put Power into your hands so you could go into your home and have dominion in your home and have dominion in your job and have dominion in your life and have dominion over your body and I'm dominion over your thoughts your actions worship oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh blessed be the name of the Lord Easter means Resurrection Easter means power Easter means freedom resurrection power means Redemption is now possible resurrection power means Pentecost is now possible Resurrection means a super church is now possible all these things were locked up in God's mind but they were not possible until the cross and that's why the preaching of the Cross and the way to the Cross is foolishness to the world but to us it's the gospel it's our joy it's our Bedrock I should have been dead but Jesus died in my place and he was able to raise from the dead so I can have a life in this gospel not a Life to Live how I want but the life in this word a life in this gospel a testimony on this Earth in 2023 that God is real and you can walk holy you can live holy you could live pure you could live under a higher law you can live under a higher law we could break records and do the unexpected it like that was done through all the ages oh my I'm closing out so when the doctor said there's no hope Easter says there's a higher law that there's resurrection power when the family thinks you cannot change Easter said is a higher law that the Holy Ghost is going to come upon you and you're gonna have a different walk you're gonna have a different talk you're gonna have a different way of living can the church say Amen come on keep on shouting we're getting ready to close out [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah God could not only resurrect Lazarus but he's sure he could raise himself up and he could raise you up also there's a higher low Easter activate breaking the natural law that man thought he understood the wisdom of man said that rain could not have come in the days of Noah the wisdom of a man said the strength of Egypt was too powerful for the slaves to cut free but God came through every single age and did the unexpected he sent rain when they had no rain he broke out slaves from the greatest military power on the earth at the time he found a man called Peter who wasn't uneducated he found a man called James and John and Andrew and Matthew and he turned them into fishes of men he found a 20th century Prophet from a little house in Kentucky and made him the voice of this age made him the messenger of this age throughout every age he found unlikely people unexpected people he used prostitutes he used thieves he used criminals he used the good the bad the all medium different he used whatever he could find as resources to make his plan come to life because he's a god of the unexpected he sent Joseph in prison that was unexpected and he took that unexpected situation and made him ruler of Egypt God could take you from where you at and take the thing that holding you down and make it an Unexpected Journey for you when you have no food like that woman with her Widow when Elijah went to visit her she expected to die but the god of the unexpected paid her a visit oh you don't hear me this morning I'm closing out just had enough is enough they keep taking on the crops and Samuel went out there brother Papa he didn't know how he's going to do it he was a farmer but his feet he did something unexpected and the god of the unexpected

pray one is not expected listen Jericho first day they went around once went back home second day they went around once went back home third day they went around once went back home four days went wrong once went back home fifth day they went around once by this time they stopped writing because they say there's a pattern we know what's going to happen we know it's going to take place but they didn't know that it got to be unexpected tell Joshua on the seventh day walk around seven times catch demo of God god of the unexpected and after the seventh the time you walk around just Shout they wouldn't expect that do the unexpected just shout don't raise no sword to raise no Shield just shout because my strength is in when you worship I could flow to the channel of worship I can talk to the challenge of Praise so I can imagine the children of Israel went through once on the first day went back home twice and under 70 they went around once and when the enemy told he was going to go back home they went wrong a second time well now they say well look like something happened different that serve is different it's an unexpected service unexpected D unexpected time so we've been a little
