all of you coming out today and we look for forward to see what the Lord will do our 1 Corinthians chapter 9 vers 24- 27 you have your seats lat on we'll go to 1 Corinthians chapter 10 so keep your Bibles close by we'll be looking at some scriptures this morning I'll reading from verse 24 know ye not that day which run in a race run all but one receive it the price so run that you may obtain and every man that strive it for the Mastery is temperate in all things now they do it for to obtain a corruptible Crown but we an Incorruptible I therefore so run not as uncertainly so fight I not as one that beat the ear but I keep under my body and bring it into subjection least that by any means when I have preached to others I myself should be a Cast Away may God bless his word you may be seated hallelujah oh praise the name of the Lord that's the scripture we have for this morning and uh have a title run with a definite aim run with a definite a that's the title I have this morning run with a definite aim don't just enter into the race you want to tell people run enter no run with an aim a definite aim and I have inspiration get your act together Hallelujah get your act together am means to organize yourself improve your behavior make a concerted effort to accomplish something and I hope that this message this morning would would challenge you to come out what I call a false sense of security that is prevalent in this end time message a false sense of security you know have something called DIY do it yourself do it yourself to make a chair to make a couch to make a well Minister seems to have a shortcut for adoption do it yourself adoption just say adopted and you're adopted you say this and you say that come like a man p a dress and say he's a woman does that make that so but God have a program right so I believe there are no shortcuts there are no shortcuts they have no free Bible and Kentucky fight chicken after service come to church it don't have that it have you are disciples except your forsake mother father brother and follow me you're not worthy of me that's what Jesus preached take up your cross daily and follow me that's what Jesus preached not come join come die Oh Glory to God come and die that's why he said Ser we would see Jesus and if you haven't listened to Wednesday night message listen to it it's a junction message is an important message getting to Jesus glory to God because a lot of people not get into Jesus they get into church but not Jesus they get into a man not Jesus they get into a pastor but not Jesus they getting message books and T but not Jesus they don't know Jesus they ask the Greek say ser we would see Jesus and those disciples didn't Co carry them in a corner and explain anything to them and guess what you cannot introduce somebody that you don't know so I don't know but a punch and say sir I want to see but the punch and I don't know who but the punch is well tell them well you know punch is a tall guy I don't know him so you cannot introduce who you don't know so you have to know Christ to introduce Christ oh give the Lord I shout in the house do you see where together to now God I don't know what I say this morning in the early years I was telling my son Isa last night in the early years when the message first had to come to Trinidad get books and stuff anybody who read two books have more information than everybody else and boy is that instant preachers you know two books and a man want to share things talk and talk what kind of homosexual what kind of filthy people all them all them walk away right now you can't see the shadow but they pumping they pumping two books three books that finish with now it's trying thing you man who was never even called not called to the pulpit not called to the ministry some of them still a called but because they have you know they say the one ey mind is King in the land of the blind let me say it again they say one ey man is King in the land of the blind blind leading the blind my God so whatever man say doesn't make it so I am the Holy Ghost is that right that's that's crazy people just saying things and people believe in what they say but I'm going to find it I'm going to read it they say when a church get off the word they'll believe anything when they go off the word because it is Satan in deception you know what they say in the Bible they found they say they are Jews and found them to be liars and was Believers exposing them you know these So-Cal died apostles who say they are and for to be Liars because it wasn't saying what Paul say it wasn't saying what the tape say because the spirit the prophet and the bride saying the same thing now this is not a Sprint this is not a swift race this is a long different race a long distance race so you had to run and pace yourself now I used to run Sprint I used to run 100 and 200 and there's a certain way to run you 200 there's a certain way to to run you 100 but when you see long distance you have to pace yourself because if you run too fast you burn out and then you fall on on the side you have to get in the Rhythm to run and to peace yourself and Philippians it says not as though I already attained either have already been perfect but I follow after if I may apprehend for that which also I'm apprehended in Christ Jesus this is what Paul said in Philippians Brethren I count not myself to have apprehended but this one thing I do forgetting those things which behind and I reach forth to those things which are before and that's is why I rebuking all this grandfather and grandmother and who tell you tell 20 years ago Liars don't come here with that forgetting the things that have passed get yourself together oh give the Lord some Praises get your act together don't come with that excuse you know the reason why I so is because no we don't want a reason we want what this is here forgetting the thing that I passed I pressed towards the mark don't tell me your father tell you you'll be blight don't tell me somebody curse you and this happened to you and you're never going to make it that's a lie that's some hell I forget the thing that have passed I press towards get your act together oh give the Lord Praises don't just come to church get it together stop blaming praise God you blame this one you blame that one and you wouldn't blame yourself you wouldn't look at you you want to make excuses for everybody for anything you want a cup cover cut it out get your act together oh glory to God he said no watch reaching forth oning before you can't go forward you can't be driving forward a review mirror you're just watching so you go you get accident you got to forget the things that are passed the Press Hallelujah I press towards the mark for the priz of the high calling in Christ Jesus he wasn't pressing for nothing I pressing where pressing I a know PR press he said press to watch The Mark young people today don't have marks they don't have goal they do have ambition just going with the crowd drifting when you have a mark and a Target you're going after that and anybody hindering you you throw them offside you cut them off because they hindering you from your ambition your desire your vision praise God hallelujah once you get your mark you hit it you're aiming at it every service you aiming at it Oh Glory our Mark is perfection our Mark is the statue of perfect amen our Mark is the life of Jesus Christ Our Mark is the token our Mark is a Revival a seven T Revival our Mark is the Holy Ghost our Mark is Charity go give the Lord some Praises our Mark is the rapture the Millennium the wedding [Music] supper glory to God we come to church to become tribulation Saints we come to church is a man to deceive us we come because God sent a message to turn our hearts back to the faith of the [Music] fathers and we want nothing less than that Shake Yourself your mother like you your father like you so what let them like you God love you that's why God call you oh give the Lord a shout glory to God your mother say it was a mishap she never wanted you she was pregnant she didn't want to be pregnant that's a lie she had to bring you forward that's why you are here if she her name not on the book your name on the book oh give the Lord a shout who s i now oh glory to God they give you flesh and eyes and all kind of physical description but that Gene in your soul is what God put inside of you and he put it there before the foundation of the world you have something to shout about glory to God I took care of your father is a drunkard and your mother was a prostitute that has nothing to do with your future Oh Glory to God are you care what the past is let the past be the [Applause] past and the Amplified is said I do not consider Brethren that have captured and made it my own yet watch so what we preaching here has to be captured by you and made your own some of you haven't done that yet you com to church you're hearing the gospel It's s and good it's not yours yet until you cap it yes and when you capture it it becomes yours then you can fight because it's yours and yeah know devil take it back I remember opposite Cinema some vagrant person my wife was going to buy something in the bakery opposite and he snatch her bag and she snatch it right back I say oh God that's my wife she stand up and freeze some vagrant snatch her back and she snatch it right back that's what you have to begin to do the devil take it from you take it right back don't just stand up and freeze take it back you have to fight for what you know is your own oh give the Lord some [Applause] Praises so Paul is saying here I do not consider Brethren that I've captured and made it my own yet but one thing I do it is my one aspiration forgetting what lies behind and straining forward to what lies ahead not sitting down on your expecting you for to drop on your I hope this rock this entitlement some Mur is a killer thing you know children have it people have it church members have it what they entitled to what yeah and they figure you know the parents labor what children want everything they labor they just they come like the prod son say Daddy Minds what mind you work fit but because he's his son he's here he say you know yeah give me now don't wait for your dead to give me give me now and he blow it away all right so I press towards the goal to win the Supreme Heavenly prize to which God in Christ Jesus is going us upward all right so we have to have targets we have to have goals you have to have what you're aiming at because if you have no Target no goal you'll get there very fast you don't know when you reach because you have no target to goal yes you reaching when you see have a Target and goal you have to press you have to get there and you know you know you will know when you get there so the ministry has to have a Target and go also it's not just we and this thing together in that way but the ministry have to Target and the church have to Target individuals have have a Target you know like a vision then even a home has to have a target a business have to have a Target every aspect has to have a Target or a vision that's how you get get purpose behind that because without a vision how you get purpose you understand and targets is not just a Target it's like a okay Target do have time with it you just say a Target no I want to buy a house by next two years I remember my children I will always visualize them 10 years ahead so when they're five I said what next 10 years they'll be 15 that's how I used to think my man to press it way so when they are 10 I'm telling myself next 10 years there will to be so I'm not seeing them at 10 I seen them at 20 and I'm preparing my mind for next 10 years there's some people who don't do that so all of a sudden children big in front of you oo like you're surprise but they grow up in front of you you don't think they will go from 5 to 10 to 15 to 20 all of a sudden you're shocked what you shock about you have to get a vision the vision makes you see the future or see ahead and make you prepare that's what that is about you know Vision make you prepare you know a lot of companies R out business bu this because it was not prepared for changes going hallelujah praise God remember blackberry and Motorola and thing you hear about Berry again he just black out just disappeared every every then days everybody a Blackberry Blackberry where is BlackBerry today so much of companies Go Bus multi-million dollar company because they miss a turn and they couldn't keep up with what was happening hallelujah it's easy to stay as a Lutheran as a Wesleyan as a Pentecostal it is tough to come into this word message to die

to pray for him [Applause] now now that I'm showing this to you how are you going to pray for that man of God had have to stand behind here to bring the word to you it's not a game it's not a play thing it's not be trying a thing it's not thatall 2 Corinthians chapter 4 verse1 says if you want to can find it 2 Corinthians 4:1 says therefore seeing we have this ministry as we have received Mercy we faint not but have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty not walking in craftiness nor handling the word of God deceitfully but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to Every Man's conscience in the sight of God and if our gospel be here is H them that are lost in whom the God of this world had blinded the minds of them which believe not lead the light of their glorious gospel of Christ who is in the image of God to shine up unto them for we preach not ourselves this is Paul speaking here but Christ Jesus the Lord and ourselves your servants for Jesus sake for God who commanded the light the shine of Darkness had shine in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ and we have this Earth as when we have this treasure in Earth vessels that the Excellency of the power maybe of God and not of us we are troubled on every side yet not distressed we are perplexed but not and despar persecuted but not forsaken cast down but not destroyed always B about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus that the life also of Jesus might be manifest in our body for we which live are always delivered unto death for Jesus sake that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh look at verse 12 here now so then death worketh in us but life in you am do you see what Paul said here now yes oh God hallelujah praise God and this in he Amplified I'll do skip it down Paul says here now he said we are pursued okay all so verse eight in the ampli says we are hedged in pressed on every side troubled and oppressed in every way but not cramped or crushed we suffer embarrassment and are perplexed unable to find a way out but not driven to despair who said the minister have to have all the answers I don't and I don't try to have all the answers I don't have all the answers God hold all the answers I will answer what I could I will see how I could help but in reality God hold the answers we're not preaching ourselves and trying to have all the answers and the key to your life that's foolishness I'm a tkey I have the key to your life God have the key to your life oh give the Lord some Praises come on now we are perplexed and unable to find our way out but not driven to dispar you can't find a way out don't give up don't backslide as God brother talk about job he said he couldn't hear from God but the devil could move him we are pursued persecuted and hard driven but not deserted to stand alone we are struck down to the ground but never struck out and destroyed all right verse 11 in the Amplified for we who are live are constantly experiencing being handed over for debt for jesus' sake that the Resurrection Life of Jesus may also be evidence to our flesh which is liable to death thus Deb is actively at work in us but it is in order that our life may be actively at work in you oh blessed be the name of the Lord and I'm going to find out that part of in his tou a perfect man you talking about build me up into this oh Lord let Christ be my head upon my Foundation of faith and let his virtue pour out that flow out that I may able to teach those so he is showing that the virtues these Seven Virtues these Virtues Of Christ must be in the manner of God that it could flow out to the Believers and that is how you connected in the reality because when Peter went to the house of Cornelius and was preaching the word while Peter yet spake these words the Holy Ghost fell upon Cornelius house and that was a son placed positionally in the body of Christ oh give the Lord a shout and life could only come from the body that's why Philip had to go and meet the Ethiopian unar because Philip was in the body Peter was in the body and go is out a plac son one by one in the body and out of their mouth will come life oh give the Lord some Praises am am I preaching the word this morning glory to God am I preaching the gospel this morning out of that man's mouth will come life Oh Glory to God who was Peter a backslider who was Peter he denied Christ three times but when Fire come into his soul and God sit down in the Throne of his heart that was God veiled that was deity in the man you canot say what Peter did 10 years ago and 15 years forget about that what happened last night you wasn't there oh glory to God you don't know when you don't know where oh give the Lord some Praise You Don't Know What the Lord Has Done For Me Oh Give the Lord some Praises you won't dare you don't know where you don't know when Oh Glory to God hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah praise God praise God praise God amen amen hallelujah Ephesians 6 12 verse for We R not against flesh and blood but against principalities and Powers against the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places that's why you have to ask God for protection because you in a ble know you walking normal normal normal but every devil in hell plotting and planning for your downfall oh give the Lord a shout he want to break your family down he want to break your marriage break your home break your business break your spirit break you down oh give the Lord a shout but the Bible said when the enemy come like a flood the spirit of God raise a standard against the enemy that's why I come to church to be inur with power to get equipped to get empowered Oh Glory to God to get the things need to deal with that devil he come sickness he bring diseases he bring all kind of thing oh glory to God but we are still standing glory to God years have passed we our hair turned from black to gray but we still standing just as strong as when we first started out oh give the Lord some Praises we are not giving up we not letting go we not going back we are pressing towards the mark of the high calling in Christ Jesus get your act together oh Oh Glory to God we on the way to the rapture we on the way to the coming of the Lord get your act [Applause] together hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hope this inspire you this morning okay let's continue a contest is a test of strength the Indian used to put a fire and they'll put so many men on one end of the Rope on the other end we to talk a wall talk a wall and you pull and is a test of strength and it will pull the losing party over the fire and we know it okay so watch the greatest contest there is is between the church and Satan that great strength of Satan we want to speak about the strength of God in his church this great contest have been going on for years started in heaven Satan was kicked out onto the Earth and then he became an enemy to God people and since then he has used all his strength and strategy to try to pull God's people across the fires into his fire now we know who has the most power God does and God when he gave his people the best thing he could come back SE with was his word because the word is God you see the devil is light to people know they figure the word is not enough people do know kind of sim and putting Rice under the mat and all kind of cuckoo stuff all kind of spirit foolishness because they figure that will keep away Spirits you doing that God hate them kind of things you know because you you actually serving some other God you know not this God of where you know he said I will never leave you I will never forsake you I will be with you oh give the Lord some praises the Bible said the angel of the Lord and Camp around them that fear Him you already have protection oh give the Lord some Praises you don't need no rice under no mat no feather no this no that no candle Black Candle blue [Applause] candle I know why I saying that maybe than for somebody inside of here cut that crap out get yourself together oh give the Lord some Praises don't know who that is for maybe it's somebody online I don't [Applause] know the Lord some Praises have no other gods before me yeah Israel the Lord th God is one God th shall have no other gods before [Applause] me Glory Glory [Applause] Hallelujah glory to God hallelujah hallelujah Glory Hallelujah the word is God that's why I know when I'm preaching the word is God being preached Sometimes some couple years ago I was in the Congo and Pastor was telling me look at them some of them have the other gods the idol you dealing with that the culture have the gods and the witch doctor and what kind of thing they have their gods they have little Idol and thing and they have they still come to church Hallelujah Glory Jesus you see what happened to them Jesus is another one of that did you hear what I just said to them Jesus is another one where they have there if they Jesus in Idol form they take Jesus and put through yes so that is why when you come you have to learn of him because you don't know him God is a good God all the time don't talk that kind of talk somebody make that kind of talk god is the word because that good God all the time tell Adam the day you eat there's a son Father and Son talking you know he said of the Tre eat all but the day you eat thereof that day you shall surely die hey so God does keep his word he doesn't play word games he doesn't play gymnastics with words he just keep his word his yeah is yeah his n is near his Blessing is blessing his curse is curses do I shou in the house do I hear the Christians here saying [Applause] amen you know people don't believe in demons in this day but the thing to do is to my opinion is to know your enemy and train for the contest that you're going to have when you meet him because are you ready yes you're going to meet him see amen going soon not Santa Claus you're going to meet him every Christmas time you can meet him he the man is wear little hat little put some size and different kind of things red and white you can could meet him any Christmas time yes with the white beard but this devil guarantee to meet him so get ready get your act together because you have to meet him that has nothing do with me you know I see people have problems husband problem wife problem children problem what and I ask myself the question if you get rid of your husband that g in trouble does that solve your a problem the answer is no husband this husband that he this he this he he this he this and you are not that but you know is this and that to makeup better but poting fer this what about if I tell you some many counseling I have done and some many cons I run straight out of and never to go back again you w believe it woo so you have to train for the contests that you're going to have when you meet him because you're going to meet him and know him know what his strength is and then train for this contest when you're going to meet him for it's one thing sure you're going to meet him so train for the contest you'll be foolish if you ignore this word to train for this battle you'll be foolish because things are looking shiny right now for you the sun is in your back and things are working out and everything else and you think that will be full forever that's why B Brandon says black skies are not signs of God disapproval nor bright Skies signs of God's approval his approval is in Christ The Beloved whether you have bright Skies or Dark Skies Oh Glory to God when job was seeing his Nightmare Child he was approved by God that's why he got it you had to pull Satan from running to and from deceiving people to say look at my servant here there is none like him in Trinidad there is none like him in all the Earth whatever country there is none like him and he could pull the Satan and look at the bride there is none like her you can't deceive her you can't get her she going to stand anyhow she going to stand fortified she is not only just going to be behind the word she will become the word [Applause] itself glory glory to God hallelujah hallelujah I told some brothers I never preach a message no part of this Earth no part of this world I've been all over that anybody after service come and say what you mean by what you see never have to ex what you mean by what you say are saying what the word say Amen so I had to mean nothing because men put in the interpretation and you have to ask questions and you get confus in their mind no confusion the word supposed to be coming clearer and clearer and clearer to you and I it's supposed to becomeing more simpler that you could walk in it that not a fool heard in daring not not even a fool could H with this Clarity of the vision the prophetic Vision that the prophet released he said write the vision make it plain that he that read it could run when we finish you supposed to run with this message oh God is not dead He's Alive oh give the Lord some Praises Oh Glory to God hallelujah hallelujah hallah hallah we forget what we do affect Generations when God God called Abraham and settled up Abraham and say go have Sarah Abraham 25 years and when Isaac was born Isaac 123 there many man young young lad and different things and God tell ABR off up Isaac Abra was tell Sarah anything about that just riding and then he tell his men we we going up com back down he have Fai and know be going up and coming back down because he know he was a dead man God raised him and changed him to have Isaac at 12 years old God say off up in know words make a sacrifice that's another word sacrifice people don't want to hear that sacri who is talking no sacrifice whatever you want you must get spoil children want the latest cell phone the latest disc the latest shoes the latest I the latest grasses the latest hat whatever it is and you just want yeah want want want want want want and sometime we don't pray because we know we get to know you could feel it in your spirit you can ask God that God go tell you no but I will tell you no you ask God come to me and first pass it by me first and I will tell you no much as to go for God so you not what you're you're not going to God because you know you don't want to hear no but when God say no he's protecting you he is protecting you from you amen [Applause] hallah when when God tell Joshua every place you put it for is yours no man shall be able to stand all days of Life they're licking up Army after Army city after City and one day the men run they run back just say wait something wrong turn all back to the enemy all run that not the Covenant God me now watch this did God make a mistake did God lie God a lieing know he said no man shall be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life amen amen but it has some sub clause on the deer there something to observe under dear obey my word he said don't touch no garment don't take the gold don't take nothing BN it and when you hear men get killed Joshua stop the camera he say hold it he's in the spirit now he you know what mishap you know you I mean know how to fight all the time they wasn't fighting God was in front of them fighting they fighting behind god with them and something like that stop the camp something wrong Hallelujah tribe by tribe family by Family Man by man I know how long that take you know tribe by tribe and they come down to a certain house certain family and Aon inside of there hallah see when see the little Babylonian garment I never had that kind of go like that I very shiny you know I could sell that for 8,000 or 10,000 they Stone him that only him they Stone the whole family they and stone them you know because that BR brought a curse you know understand how the laws of God work it's like nature you can't tell the sun start from the west and go down to the to the to the North or start from the north and go down to the to the South every morning look at the East he's Rising there every evening it sets in the west no man can change that that's the laws of God if God promised you rain you could hold an umbrella over your head and you a get wet at all you know that doesn't mean rain falling you you have your umbrella but God say rain you may not want rain because you're not a farmer the fmer want rain because he put seed in the ground so he want rain for his seed you want to get Shelter From the rain so when God sent his blessing if you start of misbehave and act up the blessing is held it is delayed not denied delayed still your blessing but it's held up oh give the Lord some Praises glory to God you don't want God to hold up your blessing you want your like David say you want your cup to run over give the Lord a shout David said my cup run it over give the Lord some Praises God want your cup to run over God want the world to know you are blessed God want your neighbors to know your family to know your people to know Oh Glory David said he prepares a table for me in the presence of my enemies Oh Glory to God he want the people to know family by Family Man by man you can't say a mother you know you have age to account for yourself yes you can't blame your father you know you have to understand what you want to line up with when I got married I got married very young I had no body to teach me fatherhood as such I had to get it from the scriptures that's why I connect with Proverbs I was joined from how God is the father how I was taking the word husband love your wife I was taking the word to provide for your family I was committed to what God Said and I had the conviction that if I obey what God said he will bless me and the rest is history Oh Glory to God blessing after blessing after blessing this is what God promised if I die now I die a bless man you can un bless what God have blessed you can curse what God have blessed what God has blessed is blessed and what God curs is cursed oh give the Lord some Praises Hallelujah Glory Hallelujah Hallelujah so you have to train have to fight smart so the first decision God give his people in the garden of to combat the enemy was his word they were fortified with his word now the enemy is going to study our strategy with the word Satan studied that so perfectly that when he come to Eve he had the best strategy he could use upon her that was to reason with the word you know I used to think intellectual spirit is people who had no education car read car right I used to think so in the early times but I recognize intellectualism is a spirit somebody could can't read and car write and they still intellectual it have to do with reasoning that's what indect have to do reasoning so when he asked what did God says serpent the Eve was saying back what her husband told her go Eve was not dear when God spoke to Adam that mean Adam taught Eve and shared with Eve the revelation of what the tree to eat and Eve said the same thing what the tape say she said the same thing what Adam said and Satan said You shall not he shall have a iner insertion you shall not surely die and she believed that not and then she was not she lost her life then Adam lost his life his eternal life and that's why we are here right now and the deed of the Earth was lost and that's what went up in the hands of the original owner and that is where the Bible in Book of Revelation says who is worthy to take the book because we need that book to get back rights on the earth 10 say I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven clo with a cloud and a rainbow around his head and he had a book open and he come down with that book and your name was in that book that's why you are in church this morning you could be back s halfway half dead but your name is on the book that is why you believe this enti message because your name is on the book but that's not all you got to find out if your name is on that book how you have to live how you have to behave oh give the Lord some Praises hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah Friday prayer meeting I give an exal about a guy Nam jab and if you haven't heard that you could go back listen to that but felt L to bring back some of that today and God was given some genealogy and all of a sudden and this is from 1 cortical chapter 4 he interrupted this with this word and C begat anab and zohab and the families of AEL and the son of Haram and then verse 9 that's verse 8 all of a sudden and jabz was more honorable than his brethren he interrupt genology to put a title or a tag on this man called jabz and said he was more honorable than his Breen and his mother called his name jabz saying because I bear him in sorrow and jabz called on the god of Israel saying and it wasn't a long prayer some people think some long prayer good Lord it wasn't a long prayer you know it's not the long praying and repetitive prayer that go get you through you know look at jabz prayer listen to this jabz called on the God of Israel saying oh that thou would has bless me indeed and enlarge my coast and that thy hand might be with me and thou wouldest Keep Me From Evil that it may not grieve me and God granted him that which he requested two verses so powerful that if you catch this two verses here you your your praying will be completely different completely different so therefore jaz's live prayer and I titled this in the prayer meeting asking for God's blessings increase guidance and protection and jabz what his mother called his name jabz because I bore him in pain so his name was sorrow and you know in the Bible days they very particular with the experiences and the name of the child so he but they never get a good joy in his life his whole spirit and demeanor was sorrowful and whatnot and to see he could say God you see the this destination here I don't want to be this s thing you know don't let me be sorry to nobody and God answer his prayer that means I don't care how you are defined don't let others Define who you are let God Define who you are I don't care what your Mama Grandmother what they say about your future or destiny forget that shut them up by going to prayer and let God answer your prayer Oh Glory to God the way ja pray you could see he was a praying man that wasn't a one shot prayer he accustomed praying Oh Glory to God he was more honorable than his brothers always a Breen but you could be higher you could be better God said I was looking for a better man and when he had sa he said I found a better man God always looking for a better man you could be a better woman a better daughter a better son a better preacher a better Minister a better Pastor you could be a better man oh give the Lord a shout that is why I have never been intimidated in Trinidad by the tradition of the elders I know they can't lead they can't direct I know I had to hear D from Heaven to cut through the noise and the confusion oh give the Lord a shout and I did just that praise God I don't hear nothing outside Oh Glory to God I want to hear direct from heaven give the Lord a shout in the house hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory to God glory to God hallelujah I'm I'm not a train my son of the king glory to God that's why no TR to bring for you because God believe it or not is not a Trinidadian God is the word Give the Lord I shout in the house glory to God many people believe God is a TR he's not he is the word Oh Glory to God we here to preach the word because the word is what going to get you through Oh Glory to God hallelujah mother call him jabz because I bought him in pain praise God oh that you would bless me praise God jab was born out of pain and sorrow jab had Brothers jabz was considered honorable are you honorable I'm talking about you Brothers you sisters are you could could could you be called honorable honorable is is describ individuals who are esteemed respected have qualities that are worthy of admiration it signifies a person character conduct and reputation is a positive light it doesn't talk about your office and what you do is talk about who you are oh give the Lord some Praises not your office not your position not what you do not you're a deacon a Elder a trustee a minister a pastor not not your position is who you are Oh Glory to God have to come back to that oh give the Lord a shout in the house not what you do but who you are and who you are is what you are when you're by yourself give the Lord some Praises glory god you can act up before Brethren but what you are when you're by yourself oh my Hallelujah honorable when applied to individual it suggests possess qualities that bring honor and dignity and respect to themselves and others respect is a big word honorable character refers to individuals who exhibit moral Integrity righteousness and uprightness in their thoughts words and action so it can't be you doing things because you see a brother do it or a sister do it is that the word but you're looking for escape Clause you're looking to do wickedness because you see others doing wickedness and being called out you're Wicked that's why you're doing it a wicked man never hear before in church you hear that today a wicked man yeah because you see you supposed to rebuke that wickedness not follow that well you know but to you others do this and do that so I I not the Holy Ghost I following you all way you're doing you think God not see what you're doing like a brother say you know fine and not rebuking him because the church he come from they all rebuking rebuking reing I say what what you doing you're doing something wrong so you waiting for me to rebuke you because you something wrong you don't know what you're doing you don't know your behavior you don't know your attitude is it right is it healthy is it uplifting the Bible teaches us how to behave yes yes whatsoever are lovely whatsoever good report if there think on these things you think on good thoughts and think don't render evil for evil render good for evil you want to fight what you want to fight for is a bad Hall I leave bad think to come in church to find bant you touch me who you ra muffin your tug go ra little tugs you know Jacob was a rich man you know and he Frid his brother yeah he Fray his brother and he asked God help him he send his wife on way because he he tricked his brother and Rob his brother he was a scull man you know trickster you know but one day he met the angel and he told the angel I will not let you go till you bless me he wanted to be blessed you how jab said Lord bless me and Jab say only said bless me he said increase my Coast in other words increase what I have add to me jabz had ambition Jabet has Vision he wanted more he wanted to expand his borders and to expand your borders he had a fight because the land have enemies on it he wasn't asking for a shortcut he was asking for strength and the ability to take more land oh give the Lord a shout don't you give up don't you stop where you are oh give the Lord some Praises you can take more hallah pay repay no evil for evil take thought for what is honest and proper and Noble and so on that's enough and Jesus said recommend uh Romans 12:17 says recommends no man evil for evil provide things honest in the sight of all men but on that good Ground Luke 8:15 are they which in an honest and good heart having heard the word keep it and bring forth fruit with patience so that's the heart condition nothing wrong with the word nothing wrong with the seed is what is the heart's condition that you would bless me that he knew God was the source of his Blessing do you know who's the source of your blessing you think it's your boss and your P suppose they fire from your work now then your blessing fall it's blessing done but if you know God is the source of your blessing then you could know who you're going through to bless you when God bless you you know it's God that blessed you he say enlarge my territory and he said that your hand be upon me you want God's guidance when you're relishing your own self this is what I do and I do and you get you that's you that's not God guidance but this man was praying for God guidance and then an important one Keep Me From Evil and harm protection Oh Glory to God so you could see he was a humble person he had Faith despite of his name and I have this here he did not allow the conditions around him and his name of Sorrow Define him and you must not let your past Define who you are you cannot let your failure Define Who You Are you must let the word Define who you are believe what the word say about you believe he has forgiven you believe he'll restore you believe you'll come out your backsliding believe you would be the head and not the tail oh give the Lord some Praises glory to God so jabz went against the Green this is going against all ODS when nothing is going well for you oh praise God and I read this but I'm say he said God want you to ask for big things he said God want have blessings isn't that right and Jesus Jesus said lead us not into temptation but Deliver Us from Evil for that is the kingdom and power and the glory so you want you to be conscious evil is a wrong and you have to ask for God protection you have to be sensitive enough that there's a devil that want to tra trap you and pull you in amen all right turn your Bibles to 1 Corinthians chapter 10 we take some time to get here this is just above what we had read about Paul identifying like a as a as a as a a race to run praise God all right so we just read in in in the scriptures every man that striveth for the Mastery is temperate all things and Paul said I run I therefore so run not uncertainly not as one beat of the air but I bring my body in subjection and then the next chapter begin to detail these things here now 1 Corinthians chapter 10 moreover Brethren and I want you to understand that we're talking to about the false s sense of security look at what God is saying here moreover Brethren 1 Corinthians chap 10:1 I would not that you be ignorant how that all our fathers were under the cloud and all passed through the sea all was in the message all baptized into Moses in the cloud and the Sea all eat the same spiritual meat had the same books and tapes all drink the same spiritual drink this Drank of the spiritual rocks that follow them which was Christ and with many of them God was not well pleased for they were overthrown in the wilderness this the journey yeah this not the promised land yet this the journey they got overthrown all right now these things were our examples to the intent we should not lust after evil things as they also lusted neither be idolators as some of them as is written the people sat down to eat and drink and Rose up to play now they're playing games on the computer Idol they're not praying they're playing games neither verse 8 let us commit fornication as some of them committed and fell in one day three and 20,000 neither let us tempt Christ as some of them also tempted and were destroy of serpents neither M ye Mur ye as some of them murmured and were destroyed of the Destroyer now all these things happen unto them for examples that they are written for our admonition upon whom the ends of the world are come now look he's drilling down further wherefore let him that think that he standed take heed L he fall J further verse 13 there had no temptation taking you but such as come unto man but God is faithful amen who will not suffer you to be tempted above and be able but will with the Temptation also make a way of Escape that you may be able to Bear it oh praise God you made me amen so I will um just want to highlight something here in the Amplified it gives more flesh to this whole thing it says do not be worshippers verse 7 in Amplified of false gods as some of them were as written the people sat down to eat drink and sacrifice off to the golden calf at Horeb Rose to Sport and dance giving away to Justin and hilarity we must not gratify evil desire and indulge in immorality as some of them did and 23,000 suddenly fell dead in a single day we should not tempt the Lord try his patience become a trial to him critically appraise him and exploit his goodness you can't exploit his goodness people do that they exploit goodness of God and they act like they don't care when they're sick and they're sick oh God pray for me and they're sick and sick as soon as they get well they back to the bad behavior the sickness only keep them for subjection for a little while but they will get sick again too you know go arrest them we should not tempt the Lord Tri patience become a trial to him critically appraise him and expose his goodness as some of them did and were killed by poisonous serpents not discontentedly complain some of them one of the most terrible things for Christians to be complaining you know where it's called that yeah yeah yeah yeah you say yeah [Music] yeah no part of Fate at all murmuring and complaining boy more pay you said work out the M come on time get a flat tire and the second flat tire again two months always complaining and complaining weakens your faith always bet you don't say nothing don't complain it bet you switch it and give God praise confuse the devil because the devil want you to complain because he want you to lose faith and when you lose Faith now you can't lay a whole of the priz you can't lay a hole upon the promise because you're lost in fth but how to praise God anyhow in the good time you praise him the bad times you praise Him devil know when you're up or down devil didn't know when you're depressed because when your devil expect you to depress and that's I years ago I did that exact thing when I was feeling I could go and disappear say I'm going to do everything opposite to what the devil wanted you want sit down

hallelujah hallelujah that chicken B hold you down one day go s Lord lift me up where I belong Oh Glory to God Amen Hallelujah listen to this now verse 12 in Amplified this is powerful therefore let anyone who thinks he stands who who feels sure that he has a steadfast mind and is standing firm take heed L he fall into sin a brother came up one time to me and tell me brother I will never fall and I kept quiet he said but over you could say you will say that I said no I can't say that I say I'm in the palm of his hands if he move his hands I will fall that brother up backst that's normal normal normal just mou Champions you know people just using the mou you have to walk a little more cautious have to walk a little more humble you may watch somebody and how they stumbling and how they walking but you're not in their shoes you don't know what hitting them in their shoes you don't know what sticking them in their toe you don't know because you're not wearing their shoes that the Bible and a sum of compassion making a difference between weak people and good beasts oh give the Lord some Praises listen to this part now for no temptation no trial regarded as enticing to sin no matter how it comes or where it leads has overtaken you and laid hold on you that is not common to man that is no temptation or trial has come to you that is beyond human resistance that is not adjusted and adapted and belonging to the human experience as such as man can bear but God is faithful to his word and to his compassionate nature and he can be trusted here we go not to let you be tempted and tried and assay beyond your ability and strength of resistance and power to endure that means when a trial come you have the ability to deal with it do I hear a shout in the house I want everybody to say Amen when a testing come you have the ability God said that to deal with it God wouldn't send it if it can't deal with it Joseph I think he was 12 or 17 I can't remember what age he

the home stretch here now brother BR job had only to be inspired because he know his position he know if inspiration strike him he know what he said would happen because it was by inspiration that's the church if it's in order it's got the mechanics ready it only need the Dynamics tonight if we will get the mechanics ready get our hearts right the things that we can do now if you know you not doing the things that God want you to do you wouldn't have the confidence to approach God for what he want to bless you with because the mechanics is the things that you can do follow every word follow him in baptism follow him in every order he told us to do get every mechanic ready and stand here then we are ready for the Dynamics to be lit off and only God can do that that's to drop into your heart the Fate that says I am not heal okay now and the amplifi the same scripture we read 1 Corinthians 9:24 says did you know that the race all Runners compete but only one receive the prize so

someone come in my help my help comes from the Lord oh David was King and David was still dancing David was King David was still cutting songs and writing songs and singing Psalms there was King and he was still serving God in such a way that God said that's a man after my own heart oh give the Lord some Praises in the house make it yours we read this sometime AG go in Deuteronomy CH 28 we almost done almost it shall come to pass if Thou shalt Heen diligently unto the voice of the Lord thy God to observe and to do all his Commandments which I command the this day that the Lord thy God will set thee on high above all nations of the earth and all these blessings shall come on thee and overtake thee if Thou shalt harken unto the voice of the Lord thy God blessed shalt thou be in the city blessed shalt thou be in the field blessed shall be the fruit of thy body and the fruit of thy ground and the fruit of thy cattle the increase of thy kind and the flock of thy sheep blessed shall be thy basket and thy store blessed shalt thou be when thou comest in blessed shalt thou be when thou goest out the Lord shall cause thine enemies that rise up against thee to be spitten before thy face they shall come one way to thee one way and flee from these seven ways the Lord shall command the blessing upon thee in thy stor houses and in all that thou sest thine hand unto and he shall bless thee in the land which the Lord thy God giveth Thee the Lord shall establish thee in an holy people unto himself he has sworn unto thee if Thou shalt keep the Commandments of the Lord thy God and walk in his ways and all the people of the Earth shall see that thou art called by the name of the Lord and they shall be afraid of thee and the Lord shall make thee plenteous in Goods in the fruit of thy body in the fruit of thy cattle in the fruit of thy ground in the land of the Lord swear unto thy fathers to give Thee the Lord shall open unto thee his good treasure the heaven to give thee rain on to thy land in his season and to bless all the work of thine hand and thou shal lend unto many nations and shall not borrow and the Lord shall make the the head and not the tail thou shal be above only and thou shalt not be beneath and in that thou observes unto the Commandments the Lord thy God which I command thee this day to observe and to do them and thou shalt go not outside from any of The Words which I command thee this day to the right and onto the left to go after other gods to serve them Hallelujah Give the Lord some Praises mus come up please we almost finish praise God let's continue God want to bless you all this is part of the blessings of God I want to read Malachi 3811 Malachi 38 says will a man rob God yet you have robbed me but you say wherein have you robbed me in ties and offering ye are cursed with a curse for you have robbed me even this whole nation bring ye all the tights into the storehouse that there may be meat in my house and prove me now here with sayth the Lord of hosts if I will not open you the windows of heaven and pour you out a blessing that there shall not be enough room enough to receive it Proverbs 3:9-10 honor thy Lord with thy substance and with the first fruits of thy increase so shall thy bands be filled with plenty and thy presses shall burst out with new wine question but brandham don't you feel that everyone who claims to be a Christian should pay tights pay tights into the storehouse of the Lord please give scripture for this question that's right the Bible in Malachi 4th chapter say will a man rub God you say where have we rubbed him in tights and offering bring all your tights and offering into my Storehouse and prove me sayth the Lord and I will not open the windows of heaven and pour out a blessing there be enough enough room enough to receive that's a challenge to any individual If I Only Had the Time and would not let get to this little scripture I wish to get to in about next 10 minutes I would like to give you a personal testimony how that I was even hungry my mother and them hungry my daddy's sick and I took my tights out first and give it to God and you ought to see what happened I have never seen in my life that any man or woman that if you only make $1 a week will bring the 10 cents of that money and put it into the storehouse your church where you come if God don't bless that call me a hypocrite that's a challenge to anybody and every question and every Christian every Christian should pay ties question should a person pay tis to an individual or should a Christian work he's the one man that will work as a Christian so he's showing that a Christian is not a lazy person a re Christian is not a lazy person a re Christian will work amen pay tax to an individual depends on who an individual is he said in Hebrews the 7th chapter when Abraham returned from the slaugh of the king he paid him tits that was mezc the king of selem he said but really here this go where you owe Titans is where you get your food where you feed from so if you're feeding here here is where you're supposed to contribute and support that's how you become a support here because this is where you're feeding from right is where you ow Titans where you get your food you're bringing all your tit in my Storehouse that's right and prove me sayth the Lord pra praise God but said I believe in pain tights is one of God's blessings that's proven to be a blessing he said I remember a time I was sick and once I was a boy I came out to the hospital owing $2,000 I used to be in a drugstore here Mr swaniger I owed him $ 3400 a medic medicine Bill he didn't even know me and I went to him I didn't know him he just sent it to me and I never refused to send it I said I owe you he said Mr Bon down Court Avenue and spring I said I owe for you I'm just awfully weak but I'm trying to go to work now I can't pay you now I I just become a Christian I said to him the first thing Mr Mason as my duty to God I owe him my tights I want to pay my tit and first then my next duty is pay my debts I said my father is sickly and there's 10 of us children in the family and if I can't pay you no more than 25 cents on that bill and each PD and that's how we organize it all right so I just want to share that with you because I know some of you don't know and I will share sh that you would know but here the part I want to get to chosen before the foundation of the world does that mean that you have no fight what are you entitled to in this message he says in Ephesians 1:4 according as he chosen in him before the foundation of the world that we should wholly Without Blame before in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ himself Accord his good pleasure of his will no fight where four second Peter 1:10 the rer Brethren give diligence to make your calling and election sure for if you do these things you will never fall what am I saying don't take nothing for granted don't be in this secure position where you figure because you believe it will just work out it takes a little more than that you have to act upon what is promise you have to act upon what your word declares praise God don't forsake the assembly yourself together why you missing Services be here because you don't know what God will speak and how God will minister to you at your the point of your need you don't know you have to make it more serious people committed to all kind of things you have to be committed to come to church and they committ commit to commit early to to pray up the service Oh Glory to God all right so I'm going to close this was something else that I was listening to from the SMA age which is the second age a irus virtue he was talking about smna means bitter and he said organization was growing a pace and the augmented debt of membership for Holy Ghost leadership was deposed and the Word was replaced by Crees and dogmas and when that Satan centered group was formed this is church people it begin to hate and to fight the True Believers insisting that they the aliens were the church of god notice how organization breathes hatred heang it destroys Fellowship it makes bitterness that's the organiz spirit that have in the message oh glory to God this is what SM means this is what SM was full of bitterness a root of bitterness defiles many that's why regardless of what somebody do you don't ever get bitter pray for them don't ever get bitter always pray for them don't get bitter at all because will drive the Holy Spirit from you you will lose the anointing the church too watch become a hybrid it wasn't so in the beginning instead of the straight word of God instead of spirit fill men in the church who were led by spirit-given Revelation there was now Creeds and bylaws educated guesses of educated men learning has taken the place of Revelation reason has replaced Faith program has replaced spontaneous praise in the Holy Ghost and when the church gets away from the word it will believe anything and brother George we talk about that we lift to see that people believe in all kind of things all kind of things I wouldn't go into that because I I go to the negative too much of me I can't go there you know if I start with with bad dollars and bad counter feet money and thing we wouldn't finish we wouldn't close but I don't go in there at all we want to stick with the real dollar isn't that right now watch but brandham says here now oh boy churches set themselves up as Fountains of truth but the truth is not in them yet the begotten children swear by them and will even kill to uphold their error if you think that is exaggeration read 2 Timothy chapter 3 I charged you therefore before God and the Lord Jesus Christ who shall judge the quick and the dead as his appearent and his kingdom preach the word be instant in season out of season reprove rebuke exalt with all long suffering and Doctrine here we go for the time will come when they will not end your song Doctrine in this message but after their own loss in this message shall they keep to themselves teachers having itching ears and shall turn away their ears from the truth and turn into fables but watch th in all things andure afflictions do the work of evangelists make fruit proof of the ministry watch when the church almost done allow herself to move from the original like Adam and Eve Death setting still have people still have deacons still have Elders still have ushers still have the congregation but de listen to the effect there was no strength in her she has become a monstrosity the minute the church moved towards form and ceremony and towards priesthood by organizing the ministers into a group that decides the leadership apart from the Holy Spirit and his word the very moment death entered she got sick here we go brother George she changed to a powerless group of people whose only weapon was argument black man only weapon argument she could produce nothing in the spirit for our hopes were built on program and not fate in this word he said I know I know your pain I know your suffering he does but does he know hold back the persecution does he stem the tribulation no he does not he simply says I know your tribulation right with me we almost done I am not at all un mindful of your suffering what a stumbling block this is to so many people like Israel they wonder if God really loves them how can God be just and loving if he stands by and watches people suffer that is what they ask in Malachi 1 1:3 the burden of the word of the Lord to Israel by Malachi I have loved you say the the Lord yet we say wherein have thou love us was not Esau Jacob's brother yet the Lord said I love Jacob you see they could not figure out God's love here we go they thought yeah church that love meant no suffering they thought that love meant baby with parental care but God said his love was elective the proof of his love is election Hallelujah no matter what happened his love was proven truly by the fact that they were chosen under salvation because God has chosen you to Salvation through sanctification of the spirit and belief of the truth he may commit you to death like he did Paul he may commit you to suffering like he did job that is his prerogative he is suffereing but with all there's a purpose if he didn't have a purpose then he would be the author frustration and not peace his purpose is that after we have suffered a while we would be made perfect Oh Glory to God we not running in vain we not running and beaten in the air we have a purpose we have a aim we have a Target Oh Glory to God here's why here's why here's why he put strength in US you see Jes he himself Jesus suffered Oh Glory to God hallelujah hallelujah you want this car you buy it you want this house you buy it you want this airplane you buy you want this you get it yeah you suffing nothing you cool you spoiled but God wouldn't allow that though because God will have no spoiled children watch here now you see he himself suffered he learned obedience by the things which he suffered he was actually made perfect by the things that he suffered then he quoted Hebrews 58 and9 though he were a son son yet learning obedience by the thing which he suffered and being made perfect he became author of Eternal salvation unto all them that obey him in plain language the very character of Jesus was perfected by suffering 10 people say amen in the whole church w my Lord my Lord my Lord you can hold back now know we almost done watch and according to Paul he left his church a measure of suffering that they too by their faith in God while suffering for him would come to a place of perfection Hallelujah question why would he want this James 1:2 my brethren count it all joy when you fall into D Temptations knowing this the trying of your faith worketh patience but let patience have a perfect work that you may be perfect an entire wanting nothing This is Gospel this is thing to shout about Oh Glory of God begin to play something why does he stand by the reason is Romans 8:17 to18 hear the scripture as we Clos if children then ears ears of God and Joint ISS with Christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together for I reckon that the suffering of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory that shall be revealed in US unless we suffer with him we cannot reign with him you have to suffer to rain the reason for this is character simply is never made without suffering character is a victory not a gift a man without character can Reign because power apart from character is satanic but Power with character is fit to rule and since he wants us to share his throne on the same basis that he overcame and is sat down his father's Throne then we have to overcome to sit with him and the little temporary suffering we go through now is not worthy to be compared to the tremendous Glory that will be revealed in us when he comes what Treasures are laid up for those who are willing to enter into his kingdom through much tribulation may the Lord bless you could be stand and give God some praises and some worship father we praise you and thank you we thank you for your love we thank you for your presence we thank you for your spirit we don't want to run
