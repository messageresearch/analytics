amen Saint Luke chapter 8. we want to read four portion of scriptures actually and I hope you know we'll just go through them real quickly man so Saint Luke chapter eight we want to read from Saint John 1 also want to read from Romans 12. and uh from acts 1 8 amen praise God yeah so Saint Luke chapter 8 . amen and from verse 43 says on a woman having an issue of blood 12 years and spent all her living upon Physicians neither could be healed of any came behind and touched the border of His Garment and immediately her issue of blood snatched man dried up Jesus said who touched me when all the night we denied Peter and they that were with him said Master the multitude throng thee and pressed thee and see it though who touched me and Jesus said somebody had touched me here's why for I perceive that virtue is gone out of me and when the woman saw that she was not him she came trembling and falling down before him she declared unto him before all the people for what course she had touched him and how she was healed immediately and he said unto her daughter be of good Comfort thy faith hath made the whole go in peace amen that's what I was saying look so Saint John you turn over to now Saint John chapter 1 and verse 11. amen we know the scripture but we just want to highlight this text here from 11 says he came unto his own in his own receive him not but as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of God even to them that believe on his name skipping over to Romans 12. Romans chapter 12 verse two verses there it says I beseech you therefore Brethren by the mercies of God and to present your bodies a Living Sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service and be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God amen one more scripture acts 1 8 we know it says but you shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost has come upon you and ye shall be Witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and at all Judea and in Samaria and unto the uttermost parts of the earth may God our blessing to the Ring of his word let's put our hands one more time Heavenly Father Lord we thank you for your grace and mercy here this morning and Lord we feel your presence

praise God so I got a title this morning virtue Palm for service and I got a subject the Revival in you amen that's my title this morning virtue power for service and the Holy Spirit just kind of spoke this to my heart about two three weeks ago amen I was watching to see how God would bring it praise God Amen just a thought and it was just lately praise God and then after what I heard uh last Sunday praise God from the pastor I said well there we go please go we're right in season amen so praise God so just by inspiration amen praise God to exalt you this morning praise God virtue power for service amen that's what the under expectation for acts 1 8 says after he received the Holy Ghost you shall receive power praise God power to become the sons of God praise God not power on the top of the pyramid yet but it's power to grow power to add power to live the life power to get all those other virtues in there so that he can now seal it with Charity praise God Amen praise God is to drive you to Calvary and then to the Rapture praise God that's what this Dynamics Revival is going to do amen amen do you believe it this morning glory to God hallelujah amen so God is fixing the center of Revival do we know that this morning do we believe that this morning praise God according to Joel 2 28 amen is not right said that in those days he will part his Spirit what day this day that is on its way praise God he promised to pour out his Spirit upon All Flesh and your sons and daughters shall prophesy your old man shall dream dreams young men shall see Visions oh Hallelujah are anointing power on Hallelujah signs wonders Miracles healings are going to break out things are going to happen o Hallelujah that confound this world but we are not here this morning to be conformed to this world but we are here this morning to be transformed by the renewing of our mind oh oh hallelujah hallelujah and my theme this morning is God's power to transform oh he has transformed power this morning oh change the prophet said transform means a change in other words change from what you was and to what he wants you to be change you from a caterpillar into a butterfly he has the ability to do that because he is God and he can change not but you are here this morning to change from this mortar to immortality in the moments in the twinkling of an eye a word in you is gonna transform it has transforming power in itself to change itself into whatever the seed is supposed to be this morning oh Hallelujah you are not a natural man or woman this morning but there's a seed inside your soul and the devil's been lying to you telling you can't receive the holy ghost that you can't be adopted but he's alive this morning are we going to approve it by the scriptures that you are going to receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost and Fire you're going to receive virtue powerful service in your soul he's gonna seal you he's Gonna Fill you and he's gonna kick the devil out how many believe it how many believe it this morning somebody say Amen [Applause] [Music] oh hallelujah hallelujah oh and I think of the goodness of Jesus all his promises he has for me I can't come in Sunday morning and just sit down quiet well what do you think this is Brother time is running out I'm here to get desperate I'm here to come for my portion for my inheritance oh in life glory to God hallelujah do you feel that way this morning so God's fixing the center Revival it's not right praise God or accept the last person the first last semen so you get the whole summary and then we go into it all right so this is this is this the whole cause of this what I have here this morning just like he did in the book of Acts and but over to brought wonderfully brought it out in a prayer meeting uh talking about those stories of what the book of Acts was and the things that took place and how God had confirmed his word which signs one of the Miracles in the lives of the Apostles their lives the Holy Ghost in them was writing a book and that book was called a book of Acts as the prophet always says it's the acts of the Holy Ghost that was in the apostles not just the accident people but the acts of God in the people and if God ever manifests himself again in a last day Pride then they will be the continuation of the book of Acts God's gonna do Works acts in you oh Hallelujah heal in the sick acts raising the dead acts a church moving and in action I'm saying Mark 16 preach the gospel heal the sick raise the Dead cast out Devils the word of God Ellen is not in word only but it's in power and in demonstration of the Holy Spirit which means we are going to come to a point when we are going to prove the word on the spots and all this preaching preach and preaching God don't need all of that God just needs five minutes to fix your situation and you'll never be the same again [Applause] somebody say Amen Hallelujah we had 50 plus years since the prophet left the scene of word word word but the Overcomer now is when the true worshipers Are Gonna Worship the father in spirits and in truths Dynamics and mechanics together to produce our last day Pride on the earth sons and bottles of car hallelujah praise God Amen isn't that right better this will produce more methodists Baptists will produce more Baptists Pentecostals will produce more Pentecostals but the word of God will produce Sons and Daughters of God and that's what we're here for this morning to get the word in us so that the transforming power somebody say transforming transforming power of God will come upon your seed and bring it to life do you believe it this morning [Applause] oh oh somebody giving praise somebody giving worship Hallelujah oh God need it's five minutes when God deal with Moses it's a very very short summer it wouldn't take a long time he was in the wilderness a long time 40 years marking time minding his father-in-law flock well when God was ready for him five minutes and he's finished Jacob Russell on I love the angel yeah he wrestled all night long but it's time for the angel to talk to him to ask him who he was that conversation didn't take that was just about five minutes all God needs is five minutes he can change her name he got hollow in his tie all kind of thing happened in five minutes or you don't hear me this morning all God needs is five minutes brother Branham said all we need or if we could just get that certain thing fixed in five minutes there will not be a female person here there would not be any person sick here there would not be any lame here no here no blind here there will be nobody here Desiring to have the Holy Ghost they would have it in five minutes [Applause] oh I came to a meeting one night and the heart was right and something got a hole of me oh it's a holy ghost it's a holy ghost it's a holy ghost get on fire this morning Hallelujah Hallelujah oh we want a Revival we need a Revival God promises send it he promised it and we believe it oh do you believe it this morning third seals now that's the reason today now the Revival we were supposed to have we have the nomination revivals but we have another real stirring no no no sir don't think we have revivals we haven't he said oh they've got millions and millions of church members that's what they have Prophet tell them they have church members but you don't have a bride yet in that sense isn't that right Hallelujah but no Revival there where the bride has not a Revival yet see there's been no arrival there no manifestation of God to stir that bride yet see what we're looking for it now it'll take those seven unknown Thunders back here to wake her up again see yeah then he'll send it he promises oh Hallelujah so we are believing unto this this morning Hallelujah we believe it unto this but for you to be in the body you have to be baptized into the party we can't push you in we can't cut off our hand and a foot and stick it on you and say you're the bride that's a Frankenstein that's not a son of God you need to be born into this thing we can't take feather and stick it on you and call your Eagle that's a Frankenstein what we need is an eagle oh and you are born an eagle oh you always was an eagle you always was a son and because you always was a son and you always was a daughter God's gonna give you the Holy Ghost that your spirits that bear witness with his spirits that you are the Son of God that you are who the devil thinks you are you're gonna prove it by living every one of those virtues you're gonna prove brotherly kindness proof holy decency proof place in Christ's abduction time and hook in to Malachi 4's third Paul and when that happens you're gonna call to the other members of the party say come come Rejoice with us we found a coin that was lost oh what a glorious time that is coming Hallelujah amen now we want to focus on this because we don't want to be in a Revival this morning and Mr blessing this is what I want to get to we don't want to be in our Revival and yet miss God's purpose you see people come when the woman come for the blood issue she met a whole revival going on there people are pulling jumping shouting making a lot of noise some people are taking pictures some people is just real nice but not all of them God put you but we know of one person this morning who touched the Hem of His comments and she got virtue they came to the Revival I don't know what they came to do but this woman came to mean business with God she came to do whatever it took to get her needs met and I'm telling you this morning you could be jumping shouting in a Revival but that don't make you a Christian that don't make you just because you holler and Shout no more than standing in a garage don't make you a car you gotta get on fire for God you gotta pray you gotta seek you gotta go on your knees you gotta do something for something to happen [Applause] oh hallelujah hallelujah oh hallelujah oh Hallelujah your faith could cause something happened this morning let me say that again because that didn't hit you your fate can cause something to happen this morning that will change the atmosphere that would change a course of events I have notes here this morning but you have the ability to pull this morning from the pillar of fire oh how I can get your knees match you don't have to wait on me your interaction was with god oh Hallelujah interactions with the angel your head a pull from the angel this morning say Lord give me my promise give me my portion give me my inheritance Lord my backsling children Lord My Mother My Father Here I am standing I need a prayer that's what you're here to do this morning not to sit and watch me oh hallelujah hallelujah no no no no but to get on fire get on fire get on fire God's Gonna cause stuff in your life to get you on fire if you had to put you in a hospital bed oh you have to make you sick but he'll put two things in your life that gets you on fire so that you could come in here and pray and seek the face of God knowing that time is running out time is running out this morning do you know that if you really know that then you'll get desperate to meet that angel to get your touch to touch your hand of His Garment because that's the only way that you're going to get your change you don't get your change from just naturally touching and just coming to see and to look or to be seen but you want to get a touch this morning a touch from the Hem of His comments a touch that changes your heart that changes your life all that you're struggling with the Devil is going to continue to pong you until you get your Victory oh you've got to get a picture this morning tell yourself this morning I'm getting my victory I'm getting my Holy Ghost baptism I come to get my portion I don't want to come to Revival and go on the same oh you don't hear me this morning [Applause] foreign [Applause] [Music] man he said if God promised a Revival here he said let's make ready for it isn't that right so get everything out get everything ready we're right in time you said that's what I record he said we have to be ready for the Revival we have to be ready and stay ready Revival gonna go pour out anytime that's the atmosphere you have to be in God announces the times and the season but we that's not in our power oh but we shall receive power that's your promise we don't know what's going to happen when it's gonna we don't know when it's gonna happen we have an idea what's gonna happen we've seen God do it before we know God could do it again but oh it's inducted all power to say when this revival is going to take place in other words it can take place in five minutes it could take place in five hours it could take place tomorrow I don't know but when it does break make sure that you receive power after the Holy Ghost comes upon you so that you can be Witnesses because you can't be a true witness without the Holy Ghost you're only telling about somebody else's testimony you're only talking about somebody else's experience and you can't go to heaven on somebody else's experience you have to go on your experience you have to be real you have to be anointed you have to be commissioned you have to know you receive something and you have to be able to wave it in a devil's face and say I don't belong to you anymore I've been protest by the blood I've been filled with the Holy Ghost wave it in his face and say look here I've been sealed from glory to glory to glory oh Hallelujah hey man that's what it is I wonder if it comes we've got to be concerned about receiving our portion so we come for we come to jump on child wear a nice suit wear a nice dress oh look at me praise God take photos eat dinner downstairs no your company be changed because we are going to a place that cannot change so the time to change is here the time to change is now the time to be happy is now the time to Rejoice is now the time to worship is now and a time to receive the Holy Ghost is right here on Earth right in the devil's Eden right in the midst of all that the devil has created all these distractions all these confusions all these voices all these noises but somehow God found a way through the full essence of preaching through the word of almighty God he cut through all the noise he cut through all the darkness he cut through all the hell do you know how many Devils God fought to bring you here this morning last week oh do you know how many Devils you overcame oh you can't even count them on your finger oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah [Applause] when the Devils when the legion asks Jesus to let us go into the pigs then is when we really saw how much Devils was in our morning there's hundreds of pigs running off the cliff hundreds and each one of them are almost represented our spirit I was in Naman think about it one man sit on there no your body's a temple see mine is very powerful and mine could host a whole number of things it's not right I think Mary had Seven Devils from the castle I don't know seven imagine that one human body that's a lot of devils the human body is very powerful God knows that because he created it for his purpose he created it to house this so how's this but the devil tried to fill it with all kinds of other stuff you understand like pride and lust and fornication adultery and evil commit and don't uh think things like that isn't that right the devil tried to pack it with all kind of nonsense but when you start to get that out kick that out one by one ten by ten hundreds by hundreds then you could fill yourself with this foreign that's what you was created for to house this power oh you don't hear me this morning and if one could put a thousandth of flights then think how much power there's having it [Applause] Legion done frightened already because as far as he concerned all of them gone in one shot with one of this in you wow he's gone oh you don't hear me this morning when the pride got to know who she is she'll speak and it'll create itself just like that oh Hallelujah oh think about it now amen as we continue all right amen oh hallelujah praise God Revival is right we got to be concerned about receiving our portion so the Revival is our opportunity this morning that God creates not by might or power but my spirit sending a Revival to create an opportunity for you to get into the pool for you to get your portion forget to get your inheritance it's an atmosphere is created for the Holy Ghost for you to get your portion but you can't get caught up in the atmosphere you have to be praying seek and looking searching and you cannot stop until you get what is yours because there were certain tribes that went into the land and did not defeat all of the inended any enemies I did not drive out all the inhabitants God was at Benjamin but he didn't try them out he was in Asha but he didn't drive them out but God said there was one that took them out his name was Caleb and Caleb said praise God I am going to expel these these these These are malachite praise God these hit us he shall be sites this Philistines all these personal demons I'm gonna kept them out he had another spirit with him Hallelujah Allah that's the strongest day and if the Lord be with me then I shall be able to drive them out he had confidence listen you don't hear me this morning oh I need some shelters this morning to help me preach this message I need some worshipers to match up the place praise God a man oh I'm tired of Pebbles I'm tired of Satan I'm tired of demons squatting on my line I'm fed up I hope somebody's fed up here with me this morning oh Hallelujah oh I gotta move I'm sorry I can't stand still praise God the holy spirit is here gotta do something even the prophet right around his vehicle oh mercy oh Hallelujah listen oh I don't know I'm not even reading anything the Holy Spirit was with them other brothers the Lord was with them Caleb saying the Lord is with me he wasn't necessarily an exclusive thing you know the Lord is with the other tribes too but it didn't drive them out they didn't have the tenacity they didn't have the five the verb they didn't have the determination they took to drive out the devil and all his flesh he didn't have what it took so the remainers are found in their side but Caleb said that God is with me then I shall be able [Music] okay okay let me bring it another way maybe we'll catch the other crowd [Music] who didn't get it yet amen I got compassion for you man praise God 's power is unlimited random said that his power is unlimited which means if he gives you power here he's given you a portion of his prayer himself to help you climb and get your inheritance to get your portion so there's nothing lacking in God's power God's ability to do it this morning what he needs is your faith to connect with the power that he's already given you the Lord said if what about him said you have with the powers Lane here this morning but not enough rich to move the power of God and because the word was not mixed with French many perish in the wilderness oh but this morning shall the son of man when he come shall he find faith on the Earth you answer that question this morning you answer that question this morning yes I have faith seven turn those kids fake oh to call for the power [Applause] thank you [Applause] hey man do you believe it that's what they are for eign depending on man to do things no we got to take the initiative we gotta take the gumption now the word is preaching for us and dig deep and find a strength to go on to face your storm muster up all the courage you can find brother Isaac oh how to muster it up get it from wherever two cents five send ten cents pull it pull it together find it find it hallelujah hallelujah but there's faith in this word here to chop down every devil that is on the field and guess what the great thing about faith is like a muscle the more you use it the bigger it gets so if you have a little bit work with that work with that and try it see if it's right work with it do your ten pounds all you have is ten pounds that's all right we'll get 10 punks brother praise God when you're ready Hallelujah that that'll grow that faith will get to Growing once you get to working but the prophet said if he could only get started and God will do the rest you'll find yourself swelling up swelling up looking pearly in faith Hallelujah one of these days [Applause] [Music] all right let me hurry along here praise God my our fell into the Holy Ghost and Fire that's what we come to receive in the Revival when it comes that's what we want we don't want to come to the Revival and remain the same it's not right Prophet said I wanted the Holy Ghost he said now the Bible said let every man's word be a lie let Gods be true truth now Ephesians 4 30 says reads like this set on Grief not the holy spirit of God whereby you are sealed until the day of redemption 47 says I'm gonna have to get a little bit hard on this now lay down he said now you legal is Brethren just all quiet for a bit right there he buying the legalism and then he moves on now he says he says uh he said did you notice how long the sea lasts yes what he said how long does it see last not till the next Revival until the next time something goes wrong he said but until the day of your Redemption that's how long you're sealed oh oh can we give him a praise that's how long you'll seal until the day of your Redemption when you are redeemed up to be with God that is how long the Holy Spirit seals you not from revival to Revival he said it is not from repository Revival but from eternity to Eternity oh hallelujah hallelujah not from conventional convention or from service to service of a work day to work day no but until eternity you are still in there oh Hallelujah oh and the devil will know when you supply when you stop cheating when you stop doing this and stop doing that he will know oh hallelujah hallelujah isn't that right that's what the holy spirit is it's the Seal of God that he's found you that he's found Grace in his sight you have found Grace in his side isn't that right it's a it's the evidence watch that he loves you oh Hallelujah the Holy Ghost when he filled you with the Holy Ghost that's his evidence that's his seal his sign that he loves you and that he believes you and he puts his seal upon you oh I want that this morning I need that this morning in my soul and in my heart it's not good enough to be a song leader it's not good enough to be a musician it's not good enough to be a father husband I want this seal it's not good enough to be a preacher not good enough to just be an elder or a deacon I want this seal it's not good enough to be an usher it's not good enough to just sing in a choir not good enough to just be a nice person I want this seal this seal of the Living God this Holy Ghost and power that's what I want this morning [Applause] oh can somebody say Amen do you want the Holy Ghost [Applause] fun favor with you seal you he's finished seal means I finished work right let's finish the work oh he that started the work he is able to complete that work to the end oh hello he's not a Halfway Gone people are halfway churches can be halfway but God cannot be halfway he's a total God and if he does a job it's a total job it's a complete job it's Finnish finish to his perfection not our idea of perfection but it's finished to his Perfection it's a perfect word oh the work that God is going to do in you is a perfect work and when he seals you ill he will seal the devil out and that's why the devil is fighting right now he's fighting this morning he fighting put a nail in your mind because he knows that when you receive this seal he is finished oh you're gonna fight back this morning same end this morning shout this morning do something different lift your hands literally shake the devil off your shoulder off your mind and say I'm coming home I'm coming home no matter how long it takes I'm gonna press with every step with every prayer with every tear I cry I'm coming back home to Jesus I Belong To Heaven and you belong with me oh I live forever for eternity oh Hallelujah do you feel that way this morning I'm Heaven bound this morning oh Hallelujah this world is not my home I'm just a traveling through oh Hallelujah Oh Glory I'm like an arrow passing through time praise God oh Hallelujah pick up the holy ghost from witness then we ought to hear praise God hey man is that the way you feel all right we're going on get a little later on see it's another message the sign that Paul spoke of times tongues was assigned to the Believers or the unbelievers you know in the context right now notice but in this the Holy Ghost is a sign he said I mean and the Holy Ghost is a seal he says it's a sign that God kept his children chosen children it's also a seal right and he said to reject it is to be cut from the people and to receive it is to be finished with the world and all the things of the world oh wonderful oh praise God the only reason the devil has any power is because you still have anxious face to work with yourself a little bit of lust a little bit Pride a little bit of head a little bit of this but when God finished the work in you he have nothing to work in he's bound he's Bound by a chain of circumstance because he can't find somebody to work through he can't find unforgiving Spirits because there's forgiveness across your chest the blood of the age across your chest forgiveness forgiveness no matter what they did for you slide off the back of your praise God like a pruned duck or forgiveness Mercy Hallelujah don't worry about it oh I'm going to heaven I want to travel light if you're going to heaven you have to travel lights take off all the heavy stuff kick out all your baggage take on all the excess things who did this and who did that my mother my father forgive oh Holly who is my mother who is my father damn datura works of God oh hallelujah praise God that's my brother that's my sister oh all them now keep his Commandments and love with them hallelujah praise God Amen Hallelujah glory to God forgive those that hurt you despitefully use you and persecute you why so that your father in Heaven might be glorified you're not here to glorify yourself you had to glorify your father in Heaven that's why we forgive it's not about us it's not about me it's not about anything I could do it's about what God has already done it's what God forbidden did in my life I was in the mighty claim I was really warmed up I was really messed up down here in Trinidad but the hand of almighty God pick me up turn me around planting my feet on higher ground and if God did all that for me why can't I forgive somebody who used me and persecuted me and hated me and rejected me it's a love of God shining out expressing God's kindness to that individual I love you I forgive you God loves me and he loves you too praise God hallelujah oh Hallelujah Hallelujah now it takes a spirit to do that say that one time you're not gonna do that in your flesh no it takes a spirit of spirit of forgiveness take the hood out to take the anguish out because every time you see the person every time you remember the situation comes up like vomit in your throat and you want to spill it but it takes broadly kindness Spirit of forgiveness to sweep over do something for you I'm telling you because I experienced it that's why I know it's another spirit it's a presence that comes over you it sweeps over your heart and life it does something to you and you know you are different you know it you know it because when you come down from that anointing and you go out into the world and you shake hands you feel it upon you [Music] it's a real thing and I genuinely believe this is I generally believe personal conviction now that the church has to find that that's that sweet spirit that comes upon the mother when she's ready to give forth bring forth our baby and when you're getting ready to bring forth Jesus Christ you got to have another spirit with you that sweet spirit is going to sweep over you it's going to be over the individual because it's a sign that you're getting ready to bring forth something Supernatural [Applause] that's not that is not skim milk because not everybody's going to be able to do that now Spirit of forgiveness oh my all right well that's interesting praise God oh Hallelujah you're loving this morning man praise God well what is in charge amen praise God hallelujah okay here we go hey man sorry for that please go all right so let me continue now see she says what the Holy Ghost okay so he says it says the Finish thing right all right I wanted to read something here okay a Revival is a spiritual awakening is that right it's a spiritual story right you can be a Revival nothing happened to you see you go on the scene you got to let it change you right so here's Queen of Sheba Prophet said he said oh what if the Christian church tonight what if the Christian church today could believe the gift that God had sent them the Holy Ghost what if they would receive it what if all the nominations would rally around Solomon with that gift the Holy Ghost the holy spirit is a gift to the church and the church turns it away and shuts It Off with our doctrines and our theologies and things right you know man-made Creeds he said we shut Christ right out he said don't let the Holy Spirit come in no no Miracles no shouting no speaking in tongues no Praises of God what our condition to be in he said well if the Holy Spirit done that in the book of Acts he said it got to do the same thing today it's the same Jesus right if he was that in the alpha he has to do the same thing today in the Omega isn't that right right because the book of Acts isn't also act the apostles just what we said earlier he says the acts of the holy spirit in the apostles and it's the same Holy Spirit in the church today that it would act the same way and give the same results he said why accept the substitute when the skies are full of the real Pentecostal power foreign the skies are full of it this morning it's right up there somewhere in the atmosphere all you have to have this morning is a strong hand of Fate to cut out the promises of God and pull along your portion this morning oh but the skies are full of it the prophet said it isn't that right and we believe it it's not right he said the skies are full of it he said we don't have to have a substitute we have we can have the real he said I know it's the truth my brother my sister it's true I'm now the act of the holy spirit amen okay so Saint Luke 8 we're at the story with a woman to the blood issue right she was in a Revival she come to Revival everyone is around touching Jesus but she come with a need and that's what made the difference she come with a need in her heart she needed something and that need drove her to her knees and she began to crawl and grapple because she had to get to the Messiah she had to capture Jesus because she had a need oh the doctors couldn't help her the Pharisees couldn't help her the sadduce he's going to help her but there was one man on the earth with the gift that she needed if she could just touch the hell of his comments she knew in herself she already told herself and convinced herself that if she could just Touch the Hem of His comment she knew she would be made whole and when she was convinced she was concerned oh and she began to fight she began to press she began to pray and that's what you have to do this morning [Applause] when the power of God really strikes home all kind of things will be crawling in here what kind of spirits in her it's called dreams his grace the gods ever pulls the Holy Spirit out upon the church will be the grace of God not anything that we did not have works that we could boast that's his grace his Reign falling upon the church but it brings up the just and the unjust it falls under scripture and the unscriptural all of them coming up weeds thistles bread I'll read it just now I have a quote on it praise God but you got to know what Spirit you are off you got to know you are like Caleb Caleb represent the bride Helen wasn't mixing matters Caleb come to chop he comes a kick he comes a bite if he loses teeth he uses gums but Caleb come to get his Mountain he come to get his inheritance and you have to be convinced this morning come on now oh that is not enough troubles in hell that can stop you from getting your blessing I come too far I come to find this life to have some devil come and turn me back around and make me go back the same way I come brother no I've already made all this effort I'm going all the way praise God let me keep on pressing keep on striving how do you not know that you're just inches away from your blessing oh Hallelujah how many know that time without a story about a man digging for gold or something he knew exactly where it was digging digging digging digging he got tired so I stopped digging I can't do any more you give up and somebody else came and dug in the same place he dug and got it after all that effort wasted because he didn't get what he set out to his heart to do in the first place isn't that right I think it's the Wright brothers when they discovered to fly they weren't the only ones who were trying to uh to learn uh manpowered flights and so forth like that you know there were other people trying to matter of fact there was another famous group that was trying to do the same thing they had finances they had engineering they had all the men on the team they had the best and they kept trying trying they couldn't do it and a bunch of two raggedy guys who won a bike shop kept going and they kept going and going and going until they figure it out they didn't have all the money in the world didn't have all their friends they didn't have all the connections they didn't have all the networks but they kept going until they figured it out they were persistent in their goal this woman of the blood issue was persistent in her goal and I'm telling you church if you are perseverance if you are persistent in your goal if you make up your mind that you're not gonna let the devil get the victory this morning then you will achieve what you are looking for oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah so I'm here to encourage you this morning keep pressing it's right at the door amen virtue powerful service so what is virtue what is it it's strength right power right statue of a perfect man Prophet identifies with him he said no here's what you do what's the first thing we have faith and we're born again that's that's living the foundation right then after we lay the foundation secondly you add to your foundation right he said after your faith you're going up in the building right you can't just stay the foundation so you add to your foundation you say add to your feet Peter said here add to your first year after faith so then add virtue to your feet this is the next column right because I guess he's pointing out the chart there he said that's the next column right first Port your foundation fee then to your feet at virtue now right here knocks a lot of us down he said wow he said yes he said that doesn't just mean live a virgin life right like to be virtuous right he said you know like the woman on man and so forth to be virtuous that doesn't that's nothing to do with that the Bible said he said we read over here in the Book of Luke where it said virtue went out of him he said that's right congregation says amen right okay we're on the word amen he said now if we're gonna be like him we must have virtue amen you must have it in order to be like he was isn't that right then we must have it to be like him it's the first song that I ever loved in the hymns the prophet said one of the greatest to be like Jesus right he said well if I'm going to be like Jesus I've got to have virtue and the past that it can pass forward from me to the people isn't that right amen it's wonderful he said now put you now before you can let it out you got to have it first it's got to be in you to give out to others amen I love it here praise God he said amen's got to be in you before you can let it out you've got to have it first you haven't got it it won't come out there's nothing for it to come out of oh Hallelujah just like Peter said when he came up to the gate called Beautiful there was a man laying there from his mother's womb he was there a long time praise God he was there when Jesus was alive Jesus crucified died rose up on the third day now I'm still in there he was about 40 years old or something that's not right I think 40 something it's not right he was there a long time Jesus probably knew that man was there but but God the will of God knew that Peter was gonna pass by one day and give that man his portion so there he laid there crippled waiting for his time and season oh Hallelujah he's with him by the gate praise God I don't know how long he was waiting therefore but he was waiting Hallelujah all of a sudden here come his time and season Here Come Peter walking down the road and Peter said I don't have silver and gold I don't have money I don't have a phone card I don't have a a a insurance man that can give you or nothing but I got something I can give you he had something to give the man strength something to get the man power or healing for his body and the same virtue that heal and woman with a blood issue come out of pizza and strengthen his ankle bones and he rose up oh do you hear what I'm saying you have to have it to give it Peter had it to give it and there's going to be a bride on the Urge there's going to be sons and daughters in here this morning that's going to have it to give it oh the sick will be healed the blind will see the will walk it'll be the quickening power upon your hands upon your feet upon your heart oh Hallelujah they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover that's a Church of God that's going to be in the last days that's going to be upon you the Bride of Jesus Christ oh hallelujah oh now we pray for the sick but when that time comes we're gonna command the Devils to leave oh Hallelujah it'll be the Church of God it'll be the authority in The Bride of Jesus Christ speaking and moving forward can we say man [Music] all right wonderful icky so uh he said uh sorry you gotta have it first it's something to come out of he said now what if someone tried draw virtue out of us and the check wouldn't return amen the bank check right he said the check wouldn't return insufficient funds see nothing there to draw from check bounce see someone looked at you as a Christian and tomorrow see that you out here carrying on like a sinner oh boy oh boy carry on like a sinner said see what what he said not much virtue can be drawn from that see right said virtue must be in US and until we get virtue then when we get true virtue we can add it to our fate amen that's that's the next Foundation whoa he said now first you must have faith but faith alone won't do it you've got Peter said then advert you to your faith you must have virtue in order to add it to your faith now then it might be the the reason you don't have it because many churches today teach you uh don't have to have it huh they teach you you know you don't have to have that see or the days of it is past that's another way of saying you don't have to have it yeah or you got it when you when you believe it that's another way of saying many ways right yeah they're trying to say many ways to God but there's only one way one way and that's through his Spirit by that Spirit you are baptized into that body don't let the devil deceive you out of receiving the Holy Ghost don't let the devil misinterpret you out of getting the Holy Ghost don't let him amen praise God huh do they make you believe a lie no no you got to be sealed you got to be anointed you got to be commissioned you got to have God's stamp of approval on your heart and on your life and when you get to this whole and those golden gates up there yonder that thing in there is what unlocks the gates up there and says here's your son coming home praise God I've got God stamp of approval in my soul and that is the key that unlocks Heaven's Door oh I'll Fly Away Oh Glory when I die Hallelujah by and by the Seal of the Holy Ghost in your heart in your soul he has a son he has a daughter of God walking shoot up early Gates because you got what you came for oh Hallelujah that's how I want to be oh is that what you want this morning is that what you need this morning a ceiling a feeling of the baptism of the Holy Ghost that holy ghost kicks Out the Devil it kicks out lust it kicks out lies it kicks out Pride it kicks out what you think it kicks out what you feel and it puts the Holy Ghost in there a portion of himself a portion of his being it changes you it transforms you and the sea that is in your soul finally comes to life and produces that pyramid [Applause] do you believe it this morning amen so we say seed in the soul wonderful right but then there's transforming power to change that seed to turn it into an actual Son of God just like they had in the days of Pentecost isn't that right that's like a honey nearly church right that's what we want this morning amen it's okay I want should I keep it too long here but a few things uh a point strike definingly the praise God and then we could go home amen praise God okay so virtue anyone that knows that word Virtue says mean says must have it but you went out and to heal a woman I was sick he's expecting that same virtue in his church remember we have to have the same work same signs that they had in the early church that's the kind of church Jesus coming back for in the last days they have to have Jesus walking in it Jesus walking on two feet Jesus wearing a tie Jesus wearing your dress Jesus wearing your clothes Jesus is going to work with you Jesus going to church with you Jesus in you oh the church can't hold the Holy Ghost but you could hold it this morning in your heart and in your life oh hallelujah hallelujah amen it pours out upon individuals it's not right amen okay see so but you says uh he's expecting the same in his church because he was our example and if he had virtue to give to the people he expects us to have virtue to give to the people what is virtue virtue is strength he says it's here power that's it amen says so now some of them don't even believe in the power of God they say well that's past only thing you have to do is put your name on a book sprinkle poured out stuff like that said that's all you have to do he said but Peter said here I'd hurt you now Peter is talking about building the house of God right back to the pyramid again see the temple of God fixing it to her place see and after you have virtue you must after you have faith you must advert you with it that's right have virtue for the whole world he says wow that's why the bride will be a Powerhouse he says Gucci for the whole world the bride will have it he said I preached to someone 20 years ago but he's got different things okay I'll skip down here please God he said look at that Lily Lily talking about the Lily the flower right it comes from way down in a muck and every minute of the day it has to be drawing from the earth in order to keep pressing up drawing from a source somewhere it depends on how deep the roots go that's how high the Lily could press oh do you get that this morning there's one time a story about a guy a preacher he had a tree in his front yard and he said the tree was kind of I can't we can't even think and he didn't know what was going on he plant all around the tree and but for some reason he tree not growing up nice so he decided to call a gardener say well you are experienced by telling what's going on with the street I'm not getting it to grow properly the man said what going on he said you have all these supports around the tree he said you need to remove that he said you need to move that I let the wind blow a little bit let your rain blow on us a little bit man you say you're pettying up too much you're covering it up too much he said remove the supports he said as soon as he do that the wind blow and he triggers stronger the rainfall and it should be gonna get stronger stuff began to happen and The Roots what happened the roots begin to kick in and they begin to do something that it was built to do it began to dig deep oh you don't hear me this morning you have to be able to dig deep when the Trials come when the tests come when the Storm come you have to have an anchor that holds the reins oh and depending on how how deep your ankle goes is how high you can press above the muck above the wind above the waves to see the light at the top isn't

everything has happened and it come down to to Brass tax as they call it praise God and his own mental strength failed him there was something within him that held the Reigns when he felt like giving up when he felt like putting in the towel oh he was a prophet yet he caved in his mental capacity caved in he put a gun to his head he pulled the trigger but something kicked in on the inside and said though he slay me yet I will trust him something's got to Anchor you this morning so that when the storms come when the Trials come when the tests come that seal of the Holy Ghost that faith that God give you in your soul that is what will stand a test that is what will stand a trial stand the persecution and dial it and say it is written it is written it is also written you'll be able to stand

your situation despite your trial despite your test oh you've got a revelation of whose you are and what you are to receive Hallelujah Hallelujah [Music] the disciples were exceedingly glad rejoicing praising God continually until the Holy Ghost come down but that doesn't mean they didn't have trials that doesn't mean they didn't have tests by the time Jesus was crucified they were hunted for Security Group from that point on everybody all the police looking for them that's why they shot a 70 Upper Room praise God isn't that right because you're following this man for three and a half years I know the FBI looking for the ID card if they make our purchase to the shop praise God they're gonna go and tell Roman soldiers look one here who was following Jesus Christ they were under persecution but that didn't stop them why because they had a revelation they saw him go now they saw him die on the cross that was one thing but when they saw him go the second time they were God would exceeding Joy because they had a revelation because he opened the scripture to them and showed them what they had to receive and because they knew what they had to receive they were happy because if he don't go the comforter cannot come [Applause] so they knew what they had to receive they knew that if they were to get the same power the same Holy Ghost to deal with the trials and the testing and the persecution out there they needed him to leave so he could come back in a lot of form he said stay here until I Endure you with power from on high oh and when he left they were excited they were shouting and praising and worshiping God oh hallelujah hallelujah what are you saying about Anthony We Know by Revelation that when the prophet left he said left without us with a promise of dynamics that was the ministry of Jesus Christ in a prophet who did the same works the same signs the same wonders and he said there's going to be a bride on the earth who's gonna do these same Works to them that believe oh Hallelujah he's going to manifest himself we are going to receive the same power the same anointing the same Holy Ghost the same penny that they received in the upper room

hallelujah let his presence flow oh my just a little more we'll close oh you're feeling fine this morning we feel the anointing this morning keep writing it this morning praise God I don't know what God's gonna do for you but I know he's got something glorious waiting for you a magnificent portion of the Holy Spirit praise God you're not even ready for that this morning yet all you just got to do is stay in the spirit you don't even know praise God how God wants to love you and bless you and wrap you in his arms you are his son you are his daughter doesn't matter how black the world make you feel in heaven your name is written up there and he's gonna give you a glorious wonderful baptism of the Holy Ghost and Fire in your soul that belongs to you that's your promise that is what he died for oh wonderful amen and amen amen oh my Genesis 1 11 God said let you bring forth grasshubilee and Seed and a fruit and tree amen even fruit of his kind see whose seat is in itself upon the Earth God's power to transformed Prophet said now what is transformation quickly he says how do we get it how does the transformation God does it by his Spirit of his word ah the spirit of the word is what does the transformation you got that amen that's the answer right he transforms he plants his seed then he throws his Spirit on it the watering spirit water water the seed bring it to life which is the Holy Ghost right we got that all right and it brings forth the product his holy spirit transforms the seed wood into to be Vindicated of its kind what kind of a seed you are that shows just what's in you he said you can't hide it whatever you want inside it shows on the outside is anything with a lily right you see it same thing see you can't you can't just you just can't keep from it it'll speak for itself right amen he said in another place he said you can't make that tree anything but what it is see it's going to be that way the Holy Spirit transformed the seed that's on the inside no matter what kind of seed it is now listen to the snow no matter what kind of seed it is it will transform it so we're talking about transform power coming up on a seed so that seed is a discrepancy then the power of the spirit watering spirit will bring that discrepancy to life yes a chicken right so you have to be careful what kind of seed is in you what you received oh so we thank God for Revelation says you pray God ask God for Revelation praise God to know what seed is in you to know what you are receiving because when that great watering Spirit comes it raises all of the seeds up oh Hallelujah Hallelujah by your works by your fruits you're going to know what seed is in there amen sons of God will produce sons of God isn't that right okay it's that way see can't keep from it you got you can't make the tree anything but what it is see that's that's the code God put in it when he spoke the season there isn't that right let every seed bring forth of his kind right God put the seed in the earth so all the time when God was moving his son and the moon and separating the water from the land and so forth like that what he was really doing was creating an environment for those Seas to come up because of the water covered the land these seeds can't come up so all Genesis 2 10 Street Genesis 4 Genesis five God is just creating creating but he's coming down to that seed then when he hit Genesis 1 11 he said let every seed bring forth after its kind he couldn't say that back there he had to separate a woman into heaven from the woman of the earth and stuff like he was still working on you but when he come down to the time and season are you getting what I'm saying now so all these years coming up God was just working on you you weren't what you are not what you was yesterday you could always look back and see how much you've grown how much you've learned what stuff you come true yeah it was tough yeah it was hard yeah it might have seemed dark oh Hallelujah everyone has dark times maybe you felt like you walked away but that's all right God's hand was still upon your life he was still forming you he was still getting you down to Genesis 1 11 so that that seed that was always in itself in the Earth that seat was always in you but God was just working on you all these years he was just working on you working on you getting you ready to bring forth life [Applause] just like he worked on the earth just like he formed the Earth out of chaos out of Darkness out of confusion all these years my brother all these years my sister he's been pulling you out of Darkness pulling you out of confusion forming something in your soul so that you could bring forth life are you hearing what I'm saying there's a seed in your soul and in that seat is the purpose of God and that purpose must be accomplished there is not enough devils in this universe that can stop the purpose of God from coming forth in your life so he separated you from your mother's womb come on he separated you from your family separated you from your work somebody you from everything else in the world what was he doing he was working on you working on you bringing you out of chaos forming you forming you getting you ready for Genesis 1 11. let every seed bring forth after it's kind and then that transforming power always take a hole bring the seat to life time and season do you got it now so it wasn't in vain oh Hallelujah some of us had some real tough times the whole world just came through covid-19 lost we lost so many brothers sisters family friends everyone was affected in some way we can't refute that we can't deny that we've been through a hard Road that's don't get scared but it might get harder from here praise God but don't you worry oh that transforming power is promised to come upon the seed word and your soul and bring it to life oh Hallelujah he's only testing you testing you to bring you Hallelujah to perfection he will do it it's God's work in you amen all right maybe five more minutes all right Holy Spirit transform to see this in the side of it amen no matter what kind of seed it is it'll transform it if it's evil it'll bring forth evil if it's a hypocrite it'll bring for the hypocrite if it's a genuine word of God it'll bring forth a genuine son or daughter of God through a thinking man's filter email said when the seed comes up it comes through that it produces a son and daughter of God all right so one day when the Willy and darkness see God now listen we're gonna speak a little longer said it's okay you're gonna uh praise God Amen uh he said yeah all right let me skip that amen here you hear me he'll do for you the same if you stand I have to receive the Holy Ghost and make yourself a Christian praise God he said he'll do for you the same after that you receive the Holy Ghost if you stand and make yourself a Christian hey that's what he had to do make ourselves press ourselves into it oh we're not entitled to anything were we entitled to press to make ourselves into this the bride will wrap herself in the comment of his promised word she's gonna make herself ready oh that's what he come to do this morning to make yourself to fall into that word image right amen he said act like a Christian should if you'll put your faith in God's word and your eyes towards heaven and let your pants legs be banging at the knees be reverent before God then there's some day that God will take you over to the side somewhere and give you a power and a gift that the whole world will know he's been with you that's that's placing our son to his position Hallelujah at a prophet said oh I feel religious right now he said yes he will do it he promised it the prophet said he's the unfailing god oh where the church has missed it by just saying I spoke in tongues I've got it now he said you've just gotten started that's for sure amen oh I'm getting ready to whine a piano amen now Jesus said a soul went for the soul sowing seeds didn't he he said no well you all Christians here everyone I held up their hands and stuff like that Pentecostal he said okay he said now watch he said no I saw went Port sowing seeds his rest death in between see and while he slept an enemy come and saw tears in that field what's tears he said well that's weed Briars and things right Thorns thistles right and now when the husbandman the preacher saw these tears growing he said let me go and pull them up let me go and reap it now right he said no no no you'll pull up the wheat also the master said amen so let them boot grow together now here's what we want to get to he said there's a wheat field out here the prophet said he said and there's creepers nettle balls stink weed everything else is in it is that right he said but now in here there's also wheat is that right it caught three kind of Believers right okay so now the rain comes off upon the Earth to water it and now what's the rain for he said to water the nettle balls now watch and pay attention see he said now not to not to not to water the creeper he said he said no he said not to water the nettle ball no watch pay attention he said the water come not to water the creeper he said the rain is sent for the wheat but the nettle ball and the weed is just as thirsty as the wheat is he said on the same rain that falls on the wheat falls on the weed and that little old weed will stand right up the street like that happy and rejoicing just as much as the little wheat was stand up and stand himself up oh Hallelujah so they're all standing up they're all shouting they're all looking like smelling like acting like Christians but one of them is wheat and the other one is weed oh but the rain is bringing it all to life but you've got to know what is in you this morning oh you gotta stand like Joshua and Caleb and say give me my mansion and when the Dynamics Falls you're going to possess that you didn't come to occupy a church bench he didn't come to take up space but you come to get your inheritance you come to get the Holy Ghost in your soul so that you can climb that pyramid so that you could go up into the Rapture can we say man Hallelujah that's who you come for this morning amen and the same rain that falls in a week falls on the weeds amen the stand up straight like that just the same right just as much he said but by a fruits you shall know them there you are see Prophet said now the same Holy Spirit hear this Mom hit his bum excuse me now the same Holy Spirit can bless a hypocrite that knocks some of you Armenians right out he said but that's the truth that's the truth see been taught holy ghost or Holiness which I believe in Holiness too but that same Spirit the rain falls under just and the unjust he said but by their fruits you shall know them so you are going to bring forth fruit and your fruit will remain faith will remain thought you will remain knowledge will remain Temperance will remain you're gonna live these virtues and no devil is going to take it from you because it's your possession it's your individual inheritance oh do you believe it this morning musician can get ready to come if I look out here and I go to get the wheat I get wheat but the weeds is all bound up see and they live on the same rain that fell for the wheat and the rain was not sent for the weeds it was sent for the wheat but the rain being on the field the wheat being uh the weeds being in the field just got as much benefit out of the rain as the rest of them did and the same rain that made the wheat live is what made the weed live it's not right he says no I'm letting off the pressure he said they all eat in the same pasture that's what the Bible says rain falls under justinly unjust people set together here's what I talk about Revival they set together crowds of people some of them are and some of them are not they all fall on The Same Spirit he said but the same spirit will bless the same crowd it'll fall the rain will fall in the cockle boat just as right and Street number Rejoice the same rain falls in a wheat and makes it but by their fruits you are known Christians so he says Christians bear Christian lives oh hallelujah what is the Holy Ghost given form amen getting ready to wind down now the church has come through these schools she married back Yonder a long time ago became a denomination an organization but you notice the birth produced something else and now it's got to a place where the Pentecostal Church where the New Birth has been tested and tried and and now it's come into a place Prophet said here's you said no God doesn't deal with the church just as an organization he doesn't just deal with the church as a group of people he deals with the church as an individuals individual in the church that's each of you here this morning I've got to be concerned about receiving your Holy Ghost about receiving your penny about you receiving your promise your portion Hallelujah that's how he's dealing with you your road and my road is two different Road praise God I might be able to go to some of the trials you go through you might be able to go through my trials but we all got trials we all got tests some to the waters some to the flood some two great trials but all through the blood oh Hallelujah isn't that right and God promised that when the enemy come in like a flood he raise up a standard against that enemy oh hallelujah hallelujah take the same word and stand against the enemy having done all to stand isn't that right oh my Hallelujah propaganda now it's got a time it's no secret we all see it that when a man proves and God loves him he takes him out somewhere to himself we're in the front of angels he does something for him he lifts him up there in the presence of God you can play something softly and Gifts him and fills him and sets him out the prophet said that's the age that we are living in do you believe it this morning that's this age we live in here now not what anybody else says I was doing but your individual walk with God where God take you over to the side God deal with you as an individual your trials your testing you overcome like David on the back side of the desert you fight your lion you fight your bear you meet your Goliath you conquer your enemy on any ground he comes upon and then God will place you over to the side and make you King over many things oh hallelujah hallelujah oh that's the age we're living in same holy spirit that saved the lutherans that sanctify the methodists that baptized the Pentecostals is Now setting in order the coming of the Lord Jesus when it'll be so powerful that body will come into this group a church that'll draw the rest of them from the grave you could begin to stand if you want said there'll be a resurrection that's what the Holy Ghost is for what is the Holy Ghost he said without us they cannot be made perfect oh do you believe it they lived in one day under that but we live in another day and when the enemy comes in like a flood he says the spirit of God will raise us standard against it see we're in a day now amen and amen is not right he said but now we need the spirit of God the spirit of God raises a standard he said what is it he's pouring in his spirit and then those who are resting out yonder in the grave or under the altar of God as it Scriptures as a crying he said how long Lord how long how much longer God is waiting on me he's waiting on you he said the church is waiting on me and you adoption time when God can pour into us his fullness his power his resurrection and then when the church and Christ become so close together till Christ becomes visible Among Us and raises the dead and then we go into the Rapture may the Lord richly bless you I'm finished this morning oh May the Holy Spirit pour out upon you may you receive your portion May virtue pour out upon you strength to add to your faith or how to live that life oh and he'll meet you in the morning
