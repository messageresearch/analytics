[32:34] signs, wonders, and miracles. We ask in
[32:38] Jesus name. Amen. And amen. And amen.
[32:44] I want you to turn your Bibles
[32:47] to Acts chapter 7. We want to read three
[32:50] portion of scriptures tonight. Hebrews
[32:52] 10 and Ephesians chapter 2. I want to
[32:55] greet you in Jesus name from the
[32:57] headstone of Trinidad. It's a blessing
[33:00] to be here tonight
[33:01] with believers of like precious faith.
[33:04] Amen. I want to bring greetings also
[33:06] from brother John Conte from Sierra
[33:07] Leon, brother who from Nigeria, the
[33:10] saints, other saints and brethren in
[33:11] Cameroon. We just concluded some
[33:14] meetings there and I'd like to give a
[33:16] testimony on those meetings and share
[33:18] something with you. We had brother Paula
[33:20] and Jacob from Ivory Coast was there
[33:22] preached. Brother Jano Jean Jano from
[33:25] France was there
[33:27] myself. We ministered there and we saw
[33:30] the power of God move like never before.
[33:32] So we're so happy to report tremendous
[33:34] victory
[33:35] for the kingdom of God, God's honor,
[33:38] and God's glory. Amen.
[33:40] So tonight we want to read Acts 7 verse
[33:42] 47-49.
[33:44] Hebrews 10 1 verse verse 5. Ephesians 2
[33:48] 19-22. We go to Acts chapter 7.
[33:53] I like what brother Peter said. He said
[33:55] time is premium in your week. Greetings
[33:58] brother Peter wife church. God bless
[34:00] you. It's a privilege for me to be here.
[34:03] I feel good. I feel welcome. I feel at
[34:06] home. And most importantly, I feel the
[34:07] spirit of God.
[34:09] Amen. So let's read from verse 47.
[34:15] Okay. But Solomon built him a house. How
[34:18] be it the most high dwelleth not in
[34:20] temples made with hands as said the
[34:22] prophet. Heaven is my throne and earth
[34:25] is my foot. What house will you build
[34:27] me? Sayeth the Lord. And what is the
[34:30] place of my rest? Hebrews chapter 10
[34:33] verse 5.
[34:41] Wherefore when he cometh unto the world,
[34:44] he see sacrifice and offering, thou
[34:46] wouldest not, but a body has thou
[34:49] prepared me. And Ephesians chapter 2,
[34:53] we're going to read from verse 19.
[35:00] Now therefore, ye are no more strangers
[35:02] and foreigners, but fellow citizens with
[35:05] the saints and of the household of God,
[35:08] and are built upon the foundation of the
[35:10] apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ
[35:12] himself, being the chief cornerstone, in
[35:16] whom all the body fitly framed together,
[35:20] growth unto an holy temple in the Lord,
[35:23] in whom ye also build it together for an
[35:26] habitation of God through the spirit.
[35:28] Let's pray one more time. Almighty God,
[35:31] we thank you for your word. It's such a
[35:33] blessing to be in your presence among
[35:34] your people. And Father, take me out of
[35:36] the way. I'm so unworthy to stand here,
[35:39] but may your blood come and cover and
[35:41] speak lift to ear to our hearts. And
[35:43] Father, may you make yourself real. May
[35:45] the word come alive to the people.
[35:47] Quicken them, Lord. Baptize them, fill
[35:50] them, revive them, stir them, anoint
[35:52] them, heal them, restore them,
[35:54] release them in Jesus name I ask it.
[35:57] Amen. And amen.
[35:59] You may be seated. Praise God.
[36:03] Praise the Lord.
[36:06] Okay. Um, what a time we had in
[36:09] Cameroon. We had great time in in Ivory
[36:13] Coast two months ago or so and we
[36:17] tremendous time. Uh, the service, the
[36:19] last service in particular, brother John
[36:21] Conte, I talked about it last time. It's
[36:23] on our website.com.
[36:25] powerful powerful anointing that came
[36:27] out to climax the meeting and the same
[36:29] thing happened again in in uh in
[36:32] Cameroon
[36:34] and to me it's just a sign that
[36:36] something has changed something has
[36:38] turned and you know we got a couple of
[36:41] testimonies like four backsliders
[36:42] repented now back with the Lord one
[36:45] minister called to say testify now you
[36:48] fully believe the seven thunders one
[36:50] lady well I saw her came to the front
[36:53] and her foot was straight this way up,
[36:55] you know, and but she was paralyzed. She
[36:57] I think is the secretary of the mayor of
[36:59] the city or something like that. Uh the
[37:01] urban council and she had a paralyzed
[37:04] leg from some disease. Now she walks
[37:06] perfectly.
[37:07] So she was instantly healed
[37:12] and one of the elder pastor there well
[37:15] he was something else. Power of God
[37:18] struck him so much. I've never seen a
[37:19] long time I haven't seen that upon a
[37:21] brother but he said he had a powerful
[37:24] touch from the angel and he he he never
[37:26] had that experience before and one of
[37:29] the one of the influential pastors there
[37:31] in the meeting most of them come they
[37:33] don't bring their congregation and um
[37:35] but he was so touched by uh what the
[37:38] message I spoke on on Friday I spoke on
[37:41] the mighty angel of revelation 10 and I
[37:44] brought the seven thunder you know and
[37:46] so he was so touched that he He decided
[37:48] to set send a tape for his church to
[37:50] play on Sunday. So he'll be back on
[37:52] Sunday. So he came back to meetings. He
[37:54] didn't preach in his own church, but he
[37:56] came back for the full convention. So I
[37:58] know God will do something tremendous.
[38:00] And this is a testimony a 17-year-old
[38:03] sister from my church before the
[38:05] convention. His brother testifying she
[38:07] had been longing to receive the baptism
[38:08] of the Holy Ghost. Sunday evening when
[38:10] the angel made himself manifest, an
[38:12] invisible force pushed her to the altar.
[38:14] Brother Conte was laying hands in the
[38:15] people and he touched her and
[38:16] extraordinary strength and so forth. So
[38:18] she received the Holy Ghost and all fear
[38:20] is now gone. You see even his
[38:22] nine-year-old daughter and experience
[38:24] with the Holy Spirit. Numerous other
[38:26] testimonies of deliverance have been
[38:28] received but we just can't tell them all
[38:29] now. And I myself was so filled on
[38:32] Friday during brother Janu's message. I
[38:35] kept crying with joy almost the whole
[38:37] service to God has been so good to us.
[38:39] So that's a little a little nutshell of
[38:42] what happened in Cameroon. We are so
[38:45] happy and delighted to see the hand of
[38:47] God going before us. And one of the key
[38:50] things I was sharing with the other
[38:52] fellow ministers, what Abraham said, it
[38:53] take a humble heart dedicated to God to
[38:56] bring Jesus Christ into present tense.
[38:59] So I could guarantee you that there is
[39:01] no room for God going to use arrogance,
[39:04] pride and all stuffed up, puffed up.
[39:06] There is no room because man has to fade
[39:09] away and fade out.
[39:11] So tonight I have something upon my
[39:12] heart to share with you. The title is
[39:15] the bride built together
[39:19] forming a dwelling place of God.
[39:21] That's the title of the message. The
[39:23] bride built together forming a dwelling
[39:28] place of God. The inspiration
[39:32] is one body,
[39:34] one spirit.
[39:36] One head. That's my inspiration tonight.
[39:40] One body, one spirit, one head. There is
[39:45] going to be a unity of the faith.
[39:48] Now, this inspiration I got from the
[39:51] amplified of the scripture we read from
[39:53] Ephesians 2. I want to read it back in
[39:55] the amplified from verse 21 and 22. This
[39:57] is what it reads. In him the whole
[40:00] structure is joined or bound or welded
[40:03] together harmoniously and it continues
[40:06] to rise, grow and increase into a holy
[40:08] temple in the Lord, a sanctuary
[40:11] dedicated, consecrated and sacred to the
[40:14] presence of the Lord.
[40:15] Amen.
[40:16] Now this is the verse. in him and in
[40:20] fellowship with one another. You
[40:24] yourselves also are being built up into
[40:28] the structure with the rest to form a
[40:32] fixed abboard or dwelling place of God
[40:37] by and through the spirit.
[40:39] Amen.
[40:40] Amen.
[40:40] So you are not fitting in by yourself.
[40:43] You are being fitted with the rest.
[40:46] Amen. with the rest of who church
[40:47] members. No, there's only one body
[40:49] and by one spirit.
[40:51] You are baptized into one body.
[40:53] Ephesians 4 said there's one body,
[40:55] there's one spirit, even as you're
[40:57] called of one hope of your calling. One
[40:59] Lord, one faith, one baptism.
[41:02] 1 Corinthians 6:18, free fornication.
[41:05] Every sin that a man do without his
[41:07] body, but he that committed fornication
[41:08] sinnth against his own body. What? Know
[41:11] ye not that your body is the temple of
[41:13] the Holy Ghost
[41:15] which is in you which he have of God and
[41:17] you are not your own for you are bought
[41:20] with a price. Therefore glorify God in
[41:21] your body
[41:22] and in your spirit
[41:24] which are God's.
[41:26] So God is building a building.
[41:28] He is not arguing about drawings. As
[41:31] brother Jano brought it to us. The
[41:32] drawings is different from the building.
[41:35] When the architectural drawing is done,
[41:37] you could see all the floors and all the
[41:39] drawings and and all where you have to
[41:40] build sheet after sheet after sheet. You
[41:42] could debate and argue about that. But
[41:44] that's not the building.
[41:45] The builders still have to build it
[41:47] according to the architectural plans.
[41:50] Sometimes builders draw a kind of
[41:51] contrary plans of what that God not
[41:53] honoring that. But once you have the
[41:55] plans as released by Malachi 4,
[41:58] then there's some five-fold builders or
[42:00] there are some ministers to come behind
[42:02] the prophet to read the plans
[42:04] to get an effect of doing some work.
[42:07] The Bible call it the work of the
[42:09] ministry.
[42:10] Not not the lying or the floating around
[42:12] of the ministry, the work of the
[42:13] ministry, the edifying of the body till
[42:15] we all come. So there's a building to be
[42:18] built, friends,
[42:19] and God going to build it. The Bible
[42:20] call it the building fitly for him
[42:22] together.
[42:23] Amen. Cuz God say heaven is my throne
[42:25] and earth is my foottool.
[42:28] What house you're going to build me
[42:30] but a body house thou prepared me.
[42:32] So I believe with all my heart God is
[42:34] preparing a body.
[42:35] A bright body.
[42:37] Oh hallelujah.
[42:39] Hallelujah.
[42:40] Are you in the church triumphant?
[42:42] Are you in the savior's bride?
[42:44] Come and be baptized into the body
[42:47] and forever more abide.
[42:49] He's preparing a bright body. Isn't that
[42:51] right? Amen.
[42:52] So Colossians said, "And he is before
[42:54] all things. By hims all things consist.
[42:57] He's the head of the body, the church,
[42:59] who is the beginning, the firstborn from
[43:01] the dead, that in all things he might
[43:04] have the preeminences."
[43:08] Ephesians 5:23, the he for the husband
[43:11] is head of the wife, even as Christ is
[43:14] the head of the church. So tonight we
[43:17] have no bishop, we have no pope,
[43:19] we have no man of the hour, we have no
[43:21] man in charge to take over the church or
[43:23] head to lead the church. We have one
[43:25] head
[43:27] and that's Jesus Christ
[43:30] who's among us tonight.
[43:32] Now people don't know a lot of people
[43:33] don't know but a brand came to introduce
[43:34] somebody.
[43:37] I can't get any tonight.
[43:38] That's another appointment with London.
[43:40] That's another message I have to preach.
[43:42] We can't get that. We can't go get that
[43:43] tonight. And that that that messenger is
[43:46] the mighty angel
[43:48] of Revelation 10:1.
[43:50] Brother was Revelation 10:7.
[43:52] But there's another angel that came
[43:54] down.
[43:54] Bible call him a mighty angel.
[43:57] That angel came with the book open.
[43:59] That's the man that brother came to
[44:01] introduce.
[44:03] Hallelujah.
[44:04] And I have news for you. He is here
[44:06] tonight.
[44:08] Oh, give the Lord some praise, people.
[44:15] Okay.
[44:16] Hallelujah.
[44:18] Because when God took the prophet, where
[44:19] did the angel go?
[44:24] He didn't remain on the mountain.
[44:26] He He He is here.
[44:29] Because the voice told John, "Go to
[44:32] Jeffville." No.
[44:34] Go to the angel.
[44:35] Amen.
[44:37] And tell the angel, "Give me that book.
[44:39] Don't cry for the book. Go and get the
[44:42] book and take it
[44:43] and then eat it.
[44:45] And if you take it and eat it, something
[44:46] going to happen to you.
[44:48] Oh yes.
[44:49] It going to be sweet in your mouth,
[44:51] but it will be bit in the belly.
[44:53] But it will give it the ability to
[44:55] prophesy
[44:56] of what's going to happen on the third
[44:57] step
[44:59] or the third pull
[45:00] or the third phase.
[45:02] Oh, hallelujah.
[45:03] Now, the first pull didn't catch the
[45:05] bride.
[45:06] The second pull didn't catch the bride.
[45:08] The prophet said the temple
[45:10] going to catch that bride.
[45:12] And the temple is the word being open to
[45:14] her.
[45:15] Because the word from your husband.
[45:18] Hallelujah.
[45:19] You got to know who your husband is
[45:20] tonight.
[45:22] Because the Bible said his wife had made
[45:24] herself ready.
[45:26] So when you get the word from your
[45:28] husband
[45:29] and you know it's the word from your
[45:30] husband, then you know you are wrapped
[45:32] yourself in the gum
[45:34] of your word. The word from your
[45:35] husband. Amen.
[45:36] So from unity of God in one church,
[45:38] brother Brandham when he lost his
[45:40] relationship with God, he become a unit
[45:42] of his own. Talking about man, he didn't
[45:44] depend on God no more.
[45:46] And then when God had taught him the
[45:48] lesson of what it was to try to do
[45:50] something within himself. So then they
[45:52] build a tower. Isn't that right? Nimrod.
[45:55] And man can achieve better when they
[45:58] united together. Now you take one man,
[46:00] his power is limited to one man.
[46:02] Two men twice his strength. Four men
[46:04] four times. And God wants us to be one.
[46:07] God made man that we should be one. And
[46:10] our motives should be one. Our
[46:13] objectives should be one. Our
[46:15] achievement should be one.
[46:17] He is just designed that way. But we
[46:19] find out that the structure that man
[46:22] begin to try to take over again himself.
[46:25] And all the time these things are going
[46:27] on. The spirit is striving with flesh
[46:29] trying to get man here we go away from
[46:32] his own achievement. trying to get man
[46:35] away from his selfish motives and
[46:37] objectives to a plan which God has laid
[46:40] down. And as long as man works his own
[46:43] plan, he will be a failure.
[46:45] A man can only achieve right when he
[46:49] comes back with the right objective
[46:52] and the right motive that is according
[46:54] to God's plan for him.
[46:56] Any other foundation is sinking sand.
[47:00] Oh hallelujah. But they achieved Nimrod
[47:04] and Billy Towerel and so on because they
[47:06] were in one heart and one mind once
[47:08] there's a unity to do anything great
[47:10] things could be achieved but it wasn't
[47:12] under God's plan. He said dear brother
[47:16] whatever I'm praying sister there's only
[47:17] one church he's talking that's the body
[47:20] of believers out of every church that
[47:24] are truly believers in our Lord Jesus
[47:26] Christ.
[47:27] Amen. So our church is not the church
[47:29] because there's only one body
[47:31] that he's head of. He's the head of the
[47:33] body called the church. That church is
[47:35] not a physical located church.
[47:38] That church is the body of believers
[47:40] that are in the body of Christ.
[47:42] And by one spirit, you get inside of
[47:44] there.
[47:44] You see, you have to be baptized inside
[47:46] of there.
[47:47] Water doesn't take inside of there.
[47:49] Shaken doesn't take inside of there.
[47:52] Fire have to come upon your life.
[47:54] Power have to come upon your life. Oh,
[47:57] glory to God. And if you don't have that
[47:58] deep in you tonight, you're going to get
[48:00] that deep because that's what we're here
[48:01] for.
[48:02] To get the dirt out, to get the desire
[48:05] off out and put that deep in your soul
[48:08] to get connected to your husband,
[48:10] your mates,
[48:12] the revealed word. Isn't that right?
[48:14] So, but Abraham say we become into a
[48:16] fellowship. The Baptist fellowship, the
[48:18] Methodist fellowship, the Catholic
[48:19] fellowship, the brewian fellowship.
[48:21] Watch. He said, "But by one spirit you
[48:23] are baptized into one body." Brother or
[48:26] sister, just remember this. We are at
[48:28] the end time. Education has took the
[48:30] place of salvation. The church
[48:32] denomination has taken the place of the
[48:34] body of Christ.
[48:36] So you're you're in this group or you're
[48:38] in this group or you're in this
[48:40] inspiration or you're in this kind of
[48:42] camp and that that that is what take the
[48:44] place of the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[48:46] that pushes somebody into the body.
[48:49] Oh, hallelujah.
[48:50] Hallelujah. But once you God put you
[48:52] into the body, no man could pull you
[48:54] out.
[48:55] Once God put you into the body,
[48:58] you are in the kingdom
[48:59] and the kingdom is within you.
[49:01] When you walk, the kingdom walk,
[49:04] hallelujah, is upon you.
[49:06] Oh, glory. Hallelujah.
[49:08] Glory to God.
[49:10] Then you begin to realize you belong to
[49:12] a higher order.
[49:14] Oh, glory to God. You belong to the God
[49:16] class.
[49:18] Special class of people. God had the
[49:21] angels
[49:22] before the foundation of the world to
[49:23] represent you
[49:25] because you were not there when Michael
[49:27] fought in the dragon fort. He said God
[49:29] sent the angels to represent you. You
[49:32] were way in the background of his mind
[49:34] because the angels came in the beginning
[49:36] but you were before the beginning.
[49:38] So you are attribute of the almighty.
[49:41] [Applause]
[49:43] Oh hallelujah.
[49:45] You're not from England. You're from
[49:46] God.
[49:48] You're not from Africa. You're from God.
[49:50] You're not from this world. You're from
[49:51] God.
[49:53] Oh, I have to go back to where I come
[49:55] from.
[49:56] Oh, hallelujah. Praise God.
[49:59] Do you believe that?
[50:02] So, watch. Denomination has taken place
[50:04] of the body of Christ setting all that
[50:07] corruption. That's what the people want.
[50:09] That's what the American church, that's
[50:10] what the Pentecostal, they don't want
[50:12] somebody to tell them the truth.
[50:14] That's right.
[50:15] Oh, hallelujah. But oh my, he says, but
[50:18] the world is falling apart because of
[50:21] the system is outside of God by one
[50:24] spirit. Not by one letter. We are all
[50:26] joined to the body. Not by studying all
[50:28] the mysteries. We are joined. Not by
[50:30] playing the tapes and listen to brother
[50:32] Brana. We are joined. That's not what
[50:34] the Bible teaches. You see, brother
[50:35] Brandon didn't come to disconnect the
[50:37] Bible from us. He come to reveal what
[50:39] the Bible says.
[50:40] We have the word,
[50:42] but this was sealed with seven seals. So
[50:44] when brother Brandham came, he came to
[50:46] reveal what's on this book.
[50:48] So whatever we get a revelation, it has
[50:50] to take us back to the scriptures.
[50:52] One Lord,
[50:53] one faith,
[50:55] one baptism,
[50:56] one body and one spirit,
[50:58] and if the spirit fall upon somebody
[51:00] here
[51:01] and fall upon somebody in Africa or in
[51:03] India, is same one spirit.
[51:06] It have one effect.
[51:08] It take out pride and brings in
[51:10] humility. Oh, it takes out deadness and
[51:14] put you on fire.
[51:16] Oh, it break the lethagi.
[51:18] It break the tiredness and the
[51:20] weariness.
[51:21] It turns the water
[51:23] into wine
[51:25] and wine have stimulation.
[51:27] Oh, glory to God. Hallelujah.
[51:30] Glory to God. Hallelujah.
[51:32] Glory to God. So when the word begin to
[51:35] reveal itself to you,
[51:37] you get stimulated
[51:39] with the revelation
[51:40] because flesh and blood is not revealing
[51:42] it to you.
[51:44] If brother Brandham come here tonight,
[51:45] he can't reveal it to you
[51:47] because the Holy Ghost alone
[51:49] is the re revealer
[51:51] of the divine revelation of Jesus
[51:53] Christ.
[51:54] Oh, a man can speak the word, but it
[51:56] takes the Holy Ghost
[51:58] to reveal and unfold the word.
[52:00] Oh, hallelujah. But said it this way. He
[52:03] said it wasn't the fact that that Peter
[52:06] said thou the son of God
[52:07] because he they knew he was the son of
[52:09] God.
[52:10] What was the important factor that Peter
[52:13] heard from heaven?
[52:15] That was the important point.
[52:17] Not that was the Christ the son of
[52:18] living God. No, he could have said that
[52:20] on his own.
[52:21] The fact is heaven revealed it.
[52:24] That was the key. Flesh and blood had
[52:26] not revealed it,
[52:28] but my father had revealed it
[52:30] because revelation give you prevailing
[52:32] power
[52:33] on your school, on your job, in your
[52:34] home, in your house.
[52:36] Revelation is power.
[52:42] Hallelujah.
[52:43] If you understand it, that's not power.
[52:46] If you read it, that's not power. If
[52:48] somebody tell you, that's not power.
[52:50] When the Holy Spirit
[52:52] reveal it to you,
[52:53] that's power. and you shall receive
[52:56] power.
[52:57] But the Holy Ghost have to come upon
[52:59] you.
[53:00] Oh, give the Lord a shout in the house.
[53:05] Oh, hallelujah.
[53:10] If God designed man's body,
[53:13] he certainly designed the body of his
[53:15] son, the church. He designed us to come
[53:20] together.
[53:20] That's right. in heavenly places
[53:22] in Christ Jesus
[53:24] and have those supernatural workings of
[53:26] God.
[53:27] Amen.
[53:28] Outlets
[53:29] through gifts of the spirit such as
[53:32] prophecy
[53:33] and wisdom and knowledge and gifts of
[53:35] healing and all these other different
[53:37] gifts is outlets that God lets out his
[53:41] power,
[53:42] lets out his revelation to the people.
[53:44] Not as individuals so much but as a
[53:46] unit. We are all together,
[53:49] one great body of believers.
[53:51] How do we get in this body?
[53:53] By one spirit.
[53:55] We are baptized into one body.
[53:57] So God have to connect us together.
[53:59] Are we going to get ang tonight?
[54:01] Oh, hallelujah.
[54:02] Oh, glory to God.
[54:04] Today,
[54:05] the greatest healing we need today is
[54:08] the healing of the body of Jesus Christ.
[54:10] That's right. his body, his body of
[54:12] believers that's been broke up by
[54:13] different denominations,
[54:15] different one from another. They don't
[54:17] have love one for another.
[54:19] What we need tonight is a uniting
[54:21] together.
[54:22] All Christians shake hands. Every
[54:24] denomination, then God will come down
[54:25] and visit us.
[54:26] Great signs and wonders
[54:28] will take place.
[54:30] He said the only difference in Jesus day
[54:31] on earth than what he was then today is
[54:34] that he's here in the form of the Holy
[54:36] Ghost.
[54:36] His corporate body sits at the right
[54:38] hand of God in heaven. And someday he
[54:40] will come and those that are in Christ
[54:42] will rise and go with him.
[54:44] See that's what we are looking for that
[54:46] day.
[54:47] His spirit with all here we go. All of
[54:51] its power and manifestation
[54:54] is given to the body of believers
[54:56] throughout the world.
[55:00] So no one group can claim we have it.
[55:04] Jesus already answered that. He said
[55:07] when they say low here, he said don't
[55:08] go.
[55:10] When they say it's here, she said don't
[55:12] go.
[55:12] He said behold the kingdom which within
[55:14] you.
[55:17] Oh, give the Lord a shout in the house.
[55:22] No, but was talking in a message called
[55:24] dedication, Elizabeth Town, Kentucky,
[55:26] and he speaking about Solomon's temple
[55:29] and he was saying that Solomon didn't
[55:31] have the material from his own country.
[55:34] All right? So he had to get it from
[55:36] other parts of the world.
[55:38] And he was describing it the other parts
[55:41] the parts to go into the temple.
[55:43] What a beautiful application it is that
[55:45] God don't just cut out his material out
[55:47] of Jews only, out of white only, out of
[55:50] brown or red or black, whatever colors
[55:52] they may be, just out of United States
[55:55] only, out of Canada only. He cuts his
[55:58] material from all over
[56:02] the world.
[56:03] Let's take that slowly.
[56:05] He cuts
[56:08] his
[56:10] material
[56:11] from all. Oh, give the Lord a shout.
[56:22] [Music]
[56:24] Here we go. and and and and if
[56:28] if while they were cutting the stone of
[56:31] a certain kind that was found in such a
[56:33] part of the country or in another nation
[56:35] to fit this stone that was cut from
[56:38] another nation, it might seem strange to
[56:40] the people passing by. They see a odd
[56:44] looking stone being cut, but God in his
[56:46] own way was doing something. Amen.
[56:49] We find out that the materials being cut
[56:52] in their own native land.
[56:55] Uhhuh.
[56:55] Amen.
[56:56] The materials
[56:57] were cut in their own native land.
[57:01] That mean they don't even have to go to
[57:03] America
[57:04] to get cut. They don't have to go to
[57:06] Canada to get cut. They don't have to go
[57:09] to this convention to get cut or that
[57:12] convention to get cut. God going to do
[57:15] the cutting.
[57:16] Oh, help me Jesus.
[57:19] You're making me feel oldfashioned
[57:20] tonight.
[57:22] Oh, you're making me feel that we have a
[57:23] revival here tonight.
[57:25] Oh, glory to God. Hallelujah.
[57:28] Hallelujah.
[57:30] Now, watch.
[57:31] Watch. Now, we find out that materials
[57:34] being cut in their own native land was
[57:36] peculiar material cut in another native
[57:39] land. We find out they were all
[57:41] transported from by oxcat and by sea and
[57:44] raft but all were coming to one place
[57:47] for one purpose.
[57:49] Amen.
[57:49] The materials
[57:51] cut out of their native land and they
[57:54] were so perfectly fit
[57:56] that in the space of 40 years there
[57:58] wasn't a saw
[58:01] or the song of a hammer.
[58:03] Amen.
[58:03] For 40 years
[58:05] not even a saw or the bus of a hammer.
[58:09] Oh, glory.
[58:10] Watch.
[58:11] Now, many of those stones look very odd.
[58:15] Just like me here tonight.
[58:17] See, you over there's a odd stone.
[58:19] Many of those stones were very odd. But
[58:22] there was a place in the temple from for
[58:23] every odd
[58:25] peculiar stones.
[58:27] God
[58:29] had a place for them.
[58:31] So don't feel funny about yourself.
[58:35] Don't feel funny about you. Sometime you
[58:37] don't even understand you.
[58:39] But there's a place
[58:42] in that body
[58:44] that you going to fit just right.
[58:46] Just right.
[58:49] Hallelujah.
[58:51] [Music]
[58:54] Hallelujah.
[58:55] Don't condemn yourself. The blood is
[58:57] there for that.
[59:03] Don't live under condemnation. That's
[59:05] what the blood come. to pull it off of
[59:07] you.
[59:08] To free you from your guilt,
[59:10] to release you from your shame,
[59:13] to cut you off your past.
[59:15] Amen.
[59:15] To set you free.
[59:17] Give the Lord praise, man.
[59:19] You're going free tonight.
[59:22] Oh yeah.
[59:23] Oh yeah.
[59:25] You're going free tonight.
[59:27] Who the son of man set free
[59:30] is free indeed. Give the Lord some
[59:31] praise this morning.
[59:40] Now many of those stones look very odd.
[59:43] Our ministries, what a beautiful type
[59:45] here.
[59:45] He said it shows the peculiarity our way
[59:48] of worship. Yet when the temple, the
[59:51] real temple will come. Watch.
[59:54] There will be a place for every odd
[59:56] acting person.
[59:58] We may look a little funny to someone
[1:00:00] else, act a little funny, but remember
[1:00:02] it's the place. Therefore, us God is
[1:00:06] cutting out the church.
[1:00:08] Now, hear this bomb.
[1:00:09] And every little stone had its place fit
[1:00:13] exactly to it.
[1:00:14] And remember, it was cut away from the
[1:00:18] place it would be put
[1:00:20] together at. And when it come together,
[1:00:22] it didn't even need honing.
[1:00:27] It was already honed. Hallelujah.
[1:00:30] Hallelujah.
[1:00:31] So now we begin to understand when God
[1:00:34] begin to fit this one here and fit this
[1:00:36] one here and fit this one here and fit
[1:00:39] this one here and this whole body become
[1:00:42] a habitation of God.
[1:00:44] For the spirit
[1:00:46] by the spirit.
[1:00:48] Oh hallelujah. We fitted with the rest.
[1:00:53] This is an international
[1:00:56] bride body.
[1:00:57] There's only one body.
[1:00:59] There's only one spirit for that body.
[1:01:02] And there's going to be one head.
[1:01:04] Oh, give the Lord some praises, people.
[1:01:13] Hallelujah.
[1:01:16] Didn't even need honing. It was already
[1:01:18] honed. God had made it so it fit
[1:01:22] perfectly into its place. What a type we
[1:01:25] find of the spiritual. How that every
[1:01:27] gift of God, every odd acting or born
[1:01:30] again Christian in their pecularity, yet
[1:01:34] it got its place, it fits into the body.
[1:01:37] Oh, hallelujah.
[1:01:39] Oh, praise God. But there was one stone
[1:01:41] that was actually too odd to fool with.
[1:01:45] So the builders rejected it.
[1:01:48] That
[1:01:50] stone was a big one.
[1:01:51] It was so odd the big the can that one
[1:01:54] they rejected. But the scripture says
[1:01:57] the stone
[1:02:00] that the builders refused
[1:02:03] God had made
[1:02:05] the head stone of the corner
[1:02:07] and it's the Lord's doing
[1:02:10] and it's marvelous in our hands.
[1:02:12] Oh you can I can I have to shout
[1:02:15] I have to rejoice.
[1:02:17] This is the day that the Lord had made.
[1:02:20] We will rejoice and be glad in it.
[1:02:23] Oh hallelujah.
[1:02:24] Yes sir. He said the builder building so
[1:02:26] high until they missed the stone
[1:02:28] and they keep running around messengers
[1:02:29] asking where's the stone something is
[1:02:31] missing the big hole is there he says
[1:02:33] Jesus spoke of it have you not read of
[1:02:35] the stone that the builders rejected was
[1:02:37] the chief corner of stone here we go and
[1:02:40] I think in the building today of the
[1:02:43] spiritual house that God worships in I
[1:02:45] think that we have a great big failure
[1:02:47] today among the builders we have come
[1:02:50] with our denominations we have laid it
[1:02:52] in sincerity we have sent our voice to
[1:02:55] school to educate them to speak well
[1:02:57] before the congregation learned them
[1:02:59] psychology Bible history did everything
[1:03:01] fine pews high tower steeples beautiful
[1:03:04] music and so forth but we find out
[1:03:06] there's something wrong we try to build
[1:03:08] it out of man-made material
[1:03:10] what education could produce what
[1:03:12] seminaries could bring out what
[1:03:13] scholarship we try to build it upon
[1:03:15] education upon scholarship watch there
[1:03:18] is where the spiritual build is today
[1:03:21] that's why the bride building of Christ
[1:03:23] here we go Hear the terminology. That is
[1:03:26] why the bride building of Christ is not
[1:03:32] ready for the bridegroom is because the
[1:03:36] builders has rejected the chief
[1:03:38] cornerstone that was laid on the day of
[1:03:40] Pentecost which is the baptism of the
[1:03:42] Holy Ghost. Hallelujah.
[1:03:47] So they preach mysteries, histories,
[1:03:51] the past,
[1:03:52] the future,
[1:03:54] all kind of revelations.
[1:03:56] Have people scratching the head,
[1:03:58] deep things, hidden things, hidden,
[1:03:59] hidden things,
[1:04:00] things that not even hidden,
[1:04:02] written things, things not even written,
[1:04:04] adding things, taking away things. But
[1:04:07] at the end of it, the stone is not there
[1:04:11] because Jesus is the cornerstone
[1:04:13] which is built upon the foundations of
[1:04:15] the apostles and prophets.
[1:04:17] We are no longer strangers.
[1:04:19] We are no longer foreigners. We have our
[1:04:22] passport to glory.
[1:04:24] Give the Lord praise people.
[1:04:30] We have our citizenship.
[1:04:33] We don't have to walk and duck. We don't
[1:04:35] have to hide from the authorities.
[1:04:37] Oh, hallelujah.
[1:04:39] You belong here. Come on now.
[1:04:42] You belong on these holy grounds.
[1:04:46] No longer a stranger.
[1:04:48] No longer a foreigner,
[1:04:50] but a citizen.
[1:04:51] Oh, you're not hearing me this morning.
[1:04:54] A citizen of rights.
[1:04:56] Amen.
[1:04:58] Hallelujah.
[1:04:58] A foreigner can't hold a black card in
[1:05:00] England and walk around saying, "I
[1:05:01] protest against the king. I protest
[1:05:03] against the queen.
[1:05:06] I protest against Mariel in England.
[1:05:07] They say, "Who are you?
[1:05:09] What do you belong here? Do you belong
[1:05:10] here? You have a passport here?" No.
[1:05:11] Deport him
[1:05:15] because he's not a citizen.
[1:05:17] But as a citizen,
[1:05:19] you could wear red, white, black, blue,
[1:05:21] whatever it is. They can't kick you out.
[1:05:24] Come on now.
[1:05:26] Nobody could throw you out.
[1:05:28] Oh, you didn't hear what I'm saying.
[1:05:30] Your name is on the book. Amen.
[1:05:33] No demon could take you out.
[1:05:38] Nobody can take your name off the book.
[1:05:40] Your name is on the book.
[1:05:42] Listen. Once a eagle,
[1:05:45] always an eagle.
[1:05:47] You might be a wounded eagle.
[1:05:49] You might be a broken eagle. Your wings
[1:05:51] might be broken tonight. You may can't
[1:05:53] even fly. But once a eagle.
[1:05:58] Oh, glory to God. If the Lord I shout.
[1:06:04] Hallelujah.
[1:06:07] It have no Kentucky fried eagle.
[1:06:10] It have Kentucky fried chicken.
[1:06:12] You're not a chicken.
[1:06:14] You are eagle.
[1:06:15] Once a eagle.
[1:06:17] Devil can't fry you.
[1:06:19] Come on now.
[1:06:20] You are here to fly.
[1:06:22] You have to recognize the wings that you
[1:06:24] have. You had to recognize you belong.
[1:06:28] Oh hallelujah.
[1:06:30] So brother Brandham
[1:06:31] oneness he say he's coming the coming is
[1:06:33] so imminent the second coming of Jesus
[1:06:36] he gathers elect together bring these
[1:06:38] elect together in from all kind of
[1:06:40] churches from everywhere now the coming
[1:06:42] of the Lord Jesus is so imminent the
[1:06:44] coming of judgment he's calling these
[1:06:46] elect together with himself with the
[1:06:48] same kind of ministry he had now watch
[1:06:52] remember now what did he do he called
[1:06:54] out the elect to make the lutherans he
[1:06:57] called out the elect lutuans to make the
[1:06:58] westerns He called out the electzians to
[1:07:02] make the Pentecostals.
[1:07:03] Here we go. Now he is calling
[1:07:06] the elect Pentecostals out
[1:07:09] to make
[1:07:11] the headstone
[1:07:13] to come into it.
[1:07:16] So in other words, this headstone body
[1:07:20] has to be made
[1:07:22] in order for it to become a habitation
[1:07:25] of God.
[1:07:26] Hallelujah. One man cannot make the
[1:07:29] headstone.
[1:07:33] So one man show is over.
[1:07:38] That's finished.
[1:07:40] If you never heard that before, you're
[1:07:42] hearing it tonight.
[1:07:44] One man show is over.
[1:07:46] We have to be connected with the rest
[1:07:51] to make up this body
[1:07:54] to become a habitation of God
[1:07:56] by and through the spirit
[1:07:59] just as you becomes the house of God
[1:08:02] as a temple of God.
[1:08:04] So when you are filled with the spirit
[1:08:06] your body becomes a temple.
[1:08:09] Heaven is my throne.
[1:08:10] Amen.
[1:08:11] Earth is my foottool.
[1:08:13] What house will you build me? But a body
[1:08:15] has thou prepared.
[1:08:17] So God has prepared you for this hour
[1:08:20] to become a stone
[1:08:22] pulled out
[1:08:24] to be fitted into the Holy Ghost slot.
[1:08:28] Hallelujah.
[1:08:29] Oh hallelujah.
[1:08:30] Are you with me? That place between LOV
[1:08:34] and brotherly kindness,
[1:08:35] that slot called Holy Spirit,
[1:08:37] that is where you are to be fitted in.
[1:08:40] [Music]
[1:08:41] That's where you've been called out
[1:08:43] to fit into there.
[1:08:45] You have to be fitted in there. You
[1:08:46] can't stay here.
[1:08:47] You have to be fitted into the spirit,
[1:08:50] the Holy Spirit.
[1:08:53] Oh my my.
[1:08:56] Now, this is what stimulate me.
[1:08:59] Hallelujah.
[1:08:59] Brother
[1:09:01] watch. He say you know this the stone
[1:09:03] was rejected. The pyramid wasn't capped
[1:09:06] but he say it will be kept in Egypt.
[1:09:08] It's missing. It's missing all over on
[1:09:10] dollar. Everything is not kept. Watch.
[1:09:13] But watch then those stones here we go.
[1:09:16] That fit around that headstone.
[1:09:19] Uhhuh.
[1:09:21] Stones to fit around the headstone will
[1:09:24] have to be so completely like that
[1:09:27] stone. Amen.
[1:09:28] In other words, he says as the bride
[1:09:31] nears the headstone,
[1:09:32] pick up and write, she will become just
[1:09:34] like him.
[1:09:36] Hallelujah.
[1:09:38] So the nearer we get to Christ
[1:09:40] is the more
[1:09:42] we reflect him.
[1:09:44] Because his spirit comes down into the
[1:09:47] church
[1:09:48] to manifest the virtues.
[1:09:53] Hallelujah. Now remember, God didn't
[1:09:56] trust any man with his bride.
[1:10:00] The Bible said the Lord himself
[1:10:03] descends from heaven
[1:10:05] with a shout
[1:10:06] to get you out. Come on, give the Lord a
[1:10:09] glory.
[1:10:10] He came down himself,
[1:10:13] mighty angel
[1:10:14] with the book open
[1:10:16] to get that bride out
[1:10:18] of the Pentecostal, out of the Baptist,
[1:10:19] out the Methodist, out of the
[1:10:21] interpretation, out the men. He kept you
[1:10:22] out.
[1:10:24] Oh hallelujah.
[1:10:26] Now redemption is in two parts.
[1:10:29] Coming out of
[1:10:30] and going into.
[1:10:32] So he get you out. He want to take you
[1:10:34] in.
[1:10:35] Are you in the church triumphant?
[1:10:37] Are you in the savior spirit?
[1:10:40] Come on. Be baptized into the body.
[1:10:43] Amen.
[1:10:43] Oh hallelujah.
[1:10:45] And if the spirit of Christ is in you,
[1:10:48] it makes you live the life of Christ.
[1:10:50] That's right.
[1:10:54] No, no, no, no, no.
[1:10:55] He said all of us are preachers.
[1:10:57] If you can't preach it, if you can't
[1:10:58] live it, stop preaching it.
[1:11:00] He said, but everybody have a voice.
[1:11:02] Is a life.
[1:11:04] The life is a voice.
[1:11:05] If you're living it, you're the
[1:11:06] thundering.
[1:11:07] If it living God, Satan seeing it.
[1:11:10] It's not a talking voice.
[1:11:12] It's a living voice.
[1:11:13] Oh, hallelujah. A live voice.
[1:11:16] That's the thunder that shakes the
[1:11:17] devil.
[1:11:19] Oh, give the Lord some praise.
[1:11:21] The devil get seven of that.
[1:11:24] Seven of that.
[1:11:26] Seven of that lift thing.
[1:11:31] You think the devil don't understand
[1:11:32] what that is about?
[1:11:33] He felt it with Jes. It is written is
[1:11:35] written.
[1:11:36] Jesus wasn't arguing with the devil.
[1:11:38] He was just giving witness to the word
[1:11:40] without demonstrating an inch of power
[1:11:42] because the devil didn't know who Jesus
[1:11:44] was.
[1:11:44] If thou be, if thou be, if the devil
[1:11:46] couldn't recognize Jesus, you think the
[1:11:48] devil going to recognize you?
[1:11:49] Come on now. Come on. Help me somebody.
[1:11:52] Come on. The devil would not recognize
[1:11:53] you. Don't expect the devil to recognize
[1:11:56] you. Not like that.
[1:11:58] You have to see power.
[1:11:59] You have to see silver and gold have I
[1:12:01] none.
[1:12:02] Such as I have, I give it unto you. He
[1:12:04] has to see omniqu speaking. The
[1:12:07] miraculous taken place.
[1:12:09] It has already begun.
[1:12:11] He has to see virtue. Power rick shade
[1:12:14] off of you.
[1:12:15] Power to lay hands.
[1:12:16] Power to preach. Power to pray. Power to
[1:12:20] deliver, power to break the hands of
[1:12:23] wickedness.
[1:12:24] Oh, we come against sickness tonight by
[1:12:27] the authority in the world. Oh, glory to
[1:12:30] God. You can go free tonight. Power is
[1:12:33] here tonight. Oh, hallelujah.
[1:12:38] This is what we talking about.
[1:12:42] Come on. You can have a revival tonight.
[1:12:45] You can be sealed tonight.
[1:12:47] You can go free tonight. Amen.
[1:12:53] [Music]
[1:12:59] Amen.
[1:13:05] See,
[1:13:06] see the devil don't want you free in
[1:13:08] spirit.
[1:13:09] Hallelujah. He want your spirit to be
[1:13:10] bound.
[1:13:11] That's why you don't want the worship
[1:13:12] and the praise.
[1:13:14] You go when you free your spirit, the
[1:13:15] spirit of God to connect with your
[1:13:16] spirit. Jesus help us to talk to the
[1:13:18] woman in the well.
[1:13:19] There's a barrier between him and the
[1:13:21] woman.
[1:13:21] You have to take some time to go between
[1:13:23] the bone and the marrow
[1:13:25] to contact a spirit.
[1:13:26] And the same way God have to contact
[1:13:28] your spirit
[1:13:29] like the Holy Spirit here on the pull
[1:13:30] pit.
[1:13:33] Oh, give the Lord some praises people.
[1:13:35] How many want to give the Lord a shout?
[1:13:38] How many want to say hallelujah?
[1:13:40] [Music]
[1:13:45] You got to do something for something to
[1:13:47] happen.
[1:13:50] You can't sit there and just shake your
[1:13:51] hand.
[1:13:54] Glory to God.
[1:13:56] When John saw her, lamb took the book,
[1:13:58] begin to holler and praise God.
[1:14:00] That's right.
[1:14:00] John take the worship to the next
[1:14:02] dimension.
[1:14:03] He said all in heaven, all on the earth.
[1:14:05] John had no amplifier. He had no DJ
[1:14:06] there to raise the volume. Raise the
[1:14:08] volume, Mr. DJ John had no DJ to raise
[1:14:11] no volume. John was his own DJ. John
[1:14:13] must raise the volume himself.
[1:14:15] He have to raise the volume inside of
[1:14:17] here.
[1:14:18] Hallelujah. Shout the preacher out.
[1:14:21] Praise the preacher out. Let the glory
[1:14:23] fill the house.
[1:14:25] [Applause]
[1:14:30] Hallelujah.
[1:14:32] People don't know the power of worship.
[1:14:34] Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. You know
[1:14:36] what's so great in Cameroon? I saw this
[1:14:39] preacher. He said nothing like this.
[1:14:41] I was a Pharisee. But you know what this
[1:14:43] look just making. He just missing little
[1:14:45] top head and long
[1:14:48] like this. And I'm on the platform. They
[1:14:50] watching and I say go drop a bomb on
[1:14:52] that man.
[1:14:53] Just waiting boy. They preaching the
[1:14:55] word. They preaching. But I come they
[1:14:56] preaching. All of a sudden when the bomb
[1:14:57] hit up goes to those hands. Oh.
[1:15:00] Let me tell you something. Brother
[1:15:02] Abraham said when the power fall those
[1:15:03] eagles will fly out.
[1:15:07] That's why I don't bother with them
[1:15:09] intellectual preachers. I have left them
[1:15:11] alone.
[1:15:12] One thing I know,
[1:15:13] when we come back from Jordan,
[1:15:16] they're going to have to confess
[1:15:18] the spirit of Elijah.
[1:15:21] God bless.
[1:15:26] Oh, we're going to come back. We're
[1:15:28] going to come back. LCA London will be
[1:15:31] back.
[1:15:33] Oh hallelujah.
[1:15:36] Not only
[1:15:37] but power and demonstration
[1:15:40] of
[1:15:40] the spirit.
[1:15:42] Oh hallelujah.
[1:15:43] Oh glory to God.
[1:15:51] Glory glory glory.
[1:15:54] Brother said that stone will not fit on
[1:15:56] the bottom foundation.
[1:15:58] Jesus
[1:16:00] cannot come
[1:16:02] until a church
[1:16:04] a body of believers
[1:16:06] and the ministry he once had
[1:16:10] we have to get to that ministry
[1:16:15] [Music]
[1:16:18] day without us not be perfect
[1:16:20] they must have this ministry
[1:16:22] to raise up the Lutheran wesley
[1:16:24] it's not man doing the resurrection
[1:16:26] but I'm saying the Lord does all three.
[1:16:28] The shout, the voice, the trump. Jesus
[1:16:32] does all three. The shout has already
[1:16:34] done it by the brand.
[1:16:36] The voice will be a bride.
[1:16:38] Then the voice has to have a body.
[1:16:43] Give the Lord a shout
[1:16:45] and there is only one body.
[1:16:48] Even as there is one voice.
[1:16:51] Did you hear that?
[1:16:53] Did you hear that?
[1:16:54] There is one body
[1:16:55] even as there's one voice. Amen.
[1:16:58] So the seven angels come of eternity.
[1:17:02] Seven. But Abraham was the seventh
[1:17:05] angel.
[1:17:06] Six angel represent Paul, Martin,
[1:17:08] Luther, Wesley, all of them. But Abraham
[1:17:11] wasn't dead. He was alive. So he was
[1:17:12] number seven.
[1:17:14] So then the other angel which is the
[1:17:15] seventh heavenly angel was Christ. So it
[1:17:18] was six angels plus seven plus one angel
[1:17:21] called the notable angel.
[1:17:23] He call it the one with the swept back
[1:17:24] wings. Yes.
[1:17:26] The one with the seven seal.
[1:17:28] Oh, hallelujah.
[1:17:29] Oh, glory to. That's the one.
[1:17:31] That's the one remain on the earth.
[1:17:33] That's the one fixing things around for
[1:17:35] his coming.
[1:17:37] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You think it's
[1:17:39] by chance you're here tonight. You think
[1:17:41] it's by chance I'm here tonight.
[1:17:43] Nothing goes by chance.
[1:17:44] All things work together for God.
[1:17:47] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:17:48] But I want to say, let the setback be a
[1:17:50] setup.
[1:17:52] When the devil think he set you back,
[1:17:53] let it be a setup for something greater,
[1:17:56] for something more powerful.
[1:17:58] Let your failures become a success.
[1:18:01] Let your defeat come into victory.
[1:18:04] Oh, hallelujah.
[1:18:05] Let the weak say I am strong.
[1:18:08] [Applause]
[1:18:11] Oh, glory to God. Don't talk that weak
[1:18:13] talk. Don't talk cuz I can't make it
[1:18:15] talk. Don't talk that talk. I can do all
[1:18:18] things.
[1:18:19] Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Oh yeah.
[1:18:22] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:18:24] To brighten the head soul. She'll be our
[1:18:26] invincible army. An army that cannot be
[1:18:29] defeated. We'll defeat sickness. We'll
[1:18:32] defeat cancer. We'll defeat AIDS. We
[1:18:35] defeat any condition.
[1:18:38] Oh, the Lord. I shout in the house.
[1:18:47] Oh,
[1:18:48] hallelujah.
[1:18:50] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:18:52] Glory God for a revival.

[1:19:01] Glory.
[1:19:02] What are you looking for with all?
[1:19:05] My God. I'm looking for You had a
[1:19:07] testimony of people lined up to come
[1:19:08] into the church.
[1:19:09] That's correct.
[1:19:10] They can't wait for the doors to open.
[1:19:12] Oh yes. They pushing one another to get
[1:19:13] inside the church.
[1:19:15] I told my church, I said, "Listen, I
[1:19:16] want home good homecooked fire." how
[1:19:19] instead of these fast foods, good
[1:19:21] homecooked food.
[1:19:22] You see when your fire originates in
[1:19:23] your house,
[1:19:24] in prayer,
[1:19:26] in praise,
[1:19:27] in worship,
[1:19:28] and you bring your home fire to the
[1:19:30] church to connect with other people who
[1:19:32] come with the fire from home. You're not
[1:19:35] coming to get fire in the church. You
[1:19:37] bringing your fire from home, go home,
[1:19:40] cooking fire, praying at home, praising
[1:19:43] at home, shouting at home. You bringing
[1:19:46] the revival. You have the danger in

[1:20:13] fast. Fire coming. Fire coming. Fire

[1:20:19] on fire. Oh, hallelujah.
[1:20:22] Hallelujah.
[1:20:24] Part of you dipping oil and the other
[1:20:26] part on fire.
[1:20:28] And you draw from the oil and you burn
[1:20:30] with fire.

[1:20:42] What a vision tonight
[1:20:44] of this bride body. What a vision
[1:20:47] tonight of you being connected
[1:20:50] internationally
[1:20:51] in the spirit realm
[1:20:53] to make a habitation of God.
[1:20:55] I have some bombs to drop.
[1:20:56] I hope I can get some more time.
[1:20:58] Oh, hallelujah. I want you.
[1:21:00] Oh, glory to God.
[1:21:02] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:21:04] Hallelujah.
[1:21:06] Question
[1:21:08] Brandham
[1:21:10] here. I forget one of them was was I the
[1:21:12] son of man, the son of man or the
[1:21:14] father? No. The watch. Was I the son of
[1:21:18] man? The son of man. Or was the pillar
[1:21:20] of fire the son of man? No. The pillar
[1:21:22] of fire is the anointing. The pillar of
[1:21:24] fire. He said now the pillar of fire is
[1:21:26] the logos that went out of God.
[1:21:28] The attribute from the fullness of God.
[1:21:30] When man was made in the image of God,
[1:21:32] then God came down in the image of man
[1:21:34] to redeem man and brought man and God
[1:21:37] together. Heavenhood hugged and kissed
[1:21:38] each other. God and man embraced each
[1:21:40] other in fatherhood. Now this logos that
[1:21:42] was in him which was the spirit of God,
[1:21:45] the anointed
[1:21:47] through the sanctifying grace of the
[1:21:49] blood brought many sons to God
[1:21:54] which is anointed
[1:21:55] with this same logos.
[1:21:58] Okay.
[1:21:59] Amen.
[1:22:01] Now on the day of Pentecost it came down
[1:22:03] the pillar of fire broke apart and set
[1:22:07] upon each one of them an elected
[1:22:09] selected group. Now the logos separated
[1:22:11] himself into men.
[1:22:13] God not in one person.
[1:22:17] He is in his church universal.
[1:22:19] That's the reason Jesus said
[1:22:22] the same works that I do shall you do
[1:22:24] also.
[1:22:25] Now King James said greater but there
[1:22:28] means more than this shall you do.
[1:22:30] God here we go was bottled up in one
[1:22:33] man.
[1:22:34] Christ Jesus. Amen.
[1:22:36] But now he is bottled and confined
[1:22:40] to the whole universal church
[1:22:43] of the living God.
[1:22:47] Could I read all now?
[1:22:49] Right now
[1:22:50] while God is speaking with us in our
[1:22:53] hearts,
[1:22:53] he's in Africa.
[1:22:55] He's in Asia.
[1:22:56] He's in Europe.
[1:22:58] He's in England.
[1:23:00] Amen.
[1:23:01] Wherever believers are gathered
[1:23:02] together.
[1:23:03] Amen.
[1:23:05] Come on here.
[1:23:07] He is here tonight
[1:23:09] where the twos and threes are gathered
[1:23:10] together.
[1:23:12] [Applause]
[1:23:15] So now brother going to answer the
[1:23:17] question.
[1:23:18] I am not he.
[1:23:20] I am his servant.
[1:23:22] And the pillar of fire is not he. Yes,
[1:23:25] sir.
[1:23:25] It is it spirit form
[1:23:27] which was upon the son of man has now
[1:23:29] come
[1:23:30] to anoint sons of men
[1:23:34] to bring back a ministry.
[1:23:36] Oh, give the Lord a shout.
[1:23:39] Do you get it now?
[1:23:41] Do you get it now?
[1:23:43] The Lost, the pillar of fire, the
[1:23:46] anointing has come to anoint more sons.
[1:23:50] Amen.
[1:23:51] To bring back his ministry.
[1:23:53] Amen. Now watch, I'm not talking about
[1:23:55] the ministry of brother
[1:23:57] or brother or brother or brother Olu.
[1:24:00] That is different men's ministry.
[1:24:02] But Jesus only had one ministry
[1:24:07] the ministry of Jesus Christ.
[1:24:11] Hallelujah.
[1:24:15] Did you get that?
[1:24:19] Every real man of God
[1:24:21] called into that position of power will
[1:24:24] have the ministry
[1:24:26] of Jesus Christ
[1:24:27] in the form of a pastor. Amen.
[1:24:30] The ministry of Jesus Christ in the form
[1:24:31] of an apostle.
[1:24:33] Amen.
[1:24:33] In the form of a prophet,
[1:24:35] in the form of evangelist,
[1:24:37] in the form of whatever, is that right?
[1:24:39] The five gifts.
[1:24:40] Amen.
[1:24:40] But it's one ministry.
[1:24:42] That ministry is to catch a headstone.
[1:24:44] Then you see Christ among us.
[1:24:46] Him moving in and out. Then we worship
[1:24:48] him. He saw the living Christ.
[1:24:50] Not no dead Christ. Living Christ
[1:24:53] healing you,
[1:24:54] sealing you,
[1:24:55] delivering you.
[1:24:56] God is real to you. He's not a thought.
[1:24:59] He's a reality.
[1:25:01] He's not a book. He's a reality.
[1:25:03] It's a plane like a tape and saying
[1:25:05] brother Brandham did this and brother
[1:25:07] Bham did that. Is you laying hands upon
[1:25:09] your child. Is you claiming your son? Is
[1:25:13] you claiming your daughter and seeing
[1:25:15] the deliverer?
[1:25:17] [Applause]
[1:25:19] Telling Satan, "Loose them and let them
[1:25:22] go. Let my people go.
[1:25:29] Oh, hallelujah.
[1:25:31] Do I hear a shout in the house?
[1:25:36] [Music]
[1:25:36] [Applause]
[1:25:42] Now watch Christ
[1:25:45] come into his body.
[1:25:47] Christ is the word. We all know that.
[1:25:49] And the anointing is Christ. And the
[1:25:52] anointing is what make the word live.
[1:25:54] Amen.
[1:25:55] That is the anointing.
[1:25:57] Christ is the anointing.
[1:26:00] The spirit that comes upon the word and
[1:26:02] quickens that word.
[1:26:04] Now, here we go. The church has got to
[1:26:06] get to the ministry.
[1:26:10] Oh yeah. We got to get to it.
[1:26:12] It's a goal.
[1:26:13] It's a aim.
[1:26:15] It's something to press forward to.
[1:26:17] That's what Elisha did.
[1:26:19] He said, he said, "Ask what you will."
[1:26:20] He said, "I want a double portion.
[1:26:24] one not good enough.
[1:26:26] What do you want?
[1:26:28] What is your desire tonight?
[1:26:30] We have to get into position.
[1:26:32] Your desire is a church pew,
[1:26:34] a church seat,
[1:26:35] but then you reach because you're on it.
[1:26:41] But if your desire
[1:26:43] is to be adopted,
[1:26:45] there is to be a manifested son,
[1:26:47] a vindicated daughter. If that is your
[1:26:50] desire,
[1:26:51] then we have something to press onto,
[1:26:53] push onto,
[1:26:56] [Music]
[1:27:00] now the church has got to get to the
[1:27:03] ministry
[1:27:04] until the church and Christ become one.
[1:27:07] He can anoint you for every blessing in
[1:27:10] the Bible.
[1:27:11] Why feel good tonight? My God. Anything
[1:27:14] you put your hand.
[1:27:15] Like the Bible said, "Blessed is the man
[1:27:17] that walketh not in the country of the
[1:27:19] ungodly, nor stand away of sinners,
[1:27:22] but is seated." Oh, hallelujah. But his
[1:27:24] delight is in the law of the Lord.
[1:27:27] And in that Lord that he meditate
[1:27:29] day and night.
[1:27:30] He shall be,
[1:27:33] he shall be,
[1:27:35] he shall be like a tree planted by
[1:27:39] waters. Whatever you do going to
[1:27:41] prosper.
[1:27:42] Whatever you do going to prosper.
[1:27:45] Oh hallelujah.
[1:27:47] Oh glory.
[1:27:48] You become the planting of God.
[1:27:51] You become the planting of God.
[1:27:59] Hallelujah.
[1:28:02] I trust I get you to change your
[1:28:04] thinking tonight.
[1:28:05] To change how you see yourself tonight.
[1:28:07] Hallelujah.
[1:28:08] Oh, that's no weak business.
[1:28:10] You are more powerful than you think.
[1:28:11] Hallelujah.
[1:28:12] You are stronger than you think.
[1:28:14] The devil is afraid of you.
[1:28:16] But you don't know who you are.
[1:28:17] He said, "One day we going to know who
[1:28:19] we are."
[1:28:20] Oh yes. One day you're going to know
[1:28:22] and the devil going to be running.
[1:28:24] You know why? He felt the power before.
[1:28:27] Jesus shook him in the wilderness.
[1:28:29] This written history shook him in the
[1:28:30] wilderness
[1:28:31] right now. The devil is trembling
[1:28:33] because he couldn't throw us down for 30
[1:28:35] plus years.
[1:28:36] We still standing. Liars went on lying.
[1:28:39] Haters went on hating. And we still
[1:28:41] standing
[1:28:43] on Christ the solid rock.
[1:28:47] Oh, glory to God.
[1:28:49] Is it wonderful to be a Christian?
[1:28:51] [Music]
[1:28:52] [Applause]
[1:28:58] So if if Christ ever puts out another
[1:29:03] body of believers, it will bear the
[1:29:05] fruit the first one did.
[1:29:07] They will write another book of Acts,
[1:29:11] not another book of arguments.
[1:29:14] Not making God more complicated,
[1:29:16] but making God more simple.
[1:29:19] To make God so complicated in this
[1:29:20] message, you almost had to get a degree
[1:29:23] and go and get some subjects
[1:29:24] to understand some of what they're
[1:29:26] preaching. But I'm telling you
[1:29:27] something.
[1:29:28] When brother Brandham had to preach to
[1:29:30] the bull.
[1:29:31] Oh, hallelujah.
[1:29:32] Did you hear what I said?
[1:29:33] When the bull was coming to brother
[1:29:34] Brham,
[1:29:35] he had to preach to the bull.
[1:29:37] He had no time for a book. He couldn't
[1:29:39] pull out a quote. He couldn't remember
[1:29:41] this and remember that. Something came
[1:29:43] over him.
[1:29:45] Oh, hallelujah.
[1:29:47] Something something something.
[1:29:49] [Music]
[1:29:51] That's a mysterious something
[1:29:53] that you can explain that something. Oh
[1:29:55] hallelujah.
[1:29:57] Say love come over here.
[1:29:58] He said boy I don't mean to disturb you.
[1:30:01] Go back and lie down. And the pull out
[1:30:03] of salute and go back and lie down
[1:30:05] because Adam was on the earth.
[1:30:07] Adam came back.
[1:30:09] Adam. Adam. Adam.
[1:30:12] Have dominion over the beast of the
[1:30:14] field.
[1:30:16] Hallelujah.
[1:30:17] Hallelujah. We are coming back.
[1:30:21] The sons of God are coming back. be
[1:30:24] back.
[1:30:28] Anybody time?
[1:30:30] Oh, hallelujah.
[1:30:33] Oh, glory to God.
[1:30:37] Hallelujah.
[1:30:41] Glory.
[1:30:43] That prophet prophesied that other sons
[1:30:47] coming.
[1:30:48] More sons coming.
[1:30:50] He was the first one come to maturity.
[1:30:52] But other sons come with the same power,
[1:30:55] same authority,
[1:30:56] same life,
[1:30:57] same signs,
[1:30:59] same wonders,
[1:31:02] I'm not talking about human.
[1:31:04] I'm talking about supernatural sons of
[1:31:06] God.
[1:31:09] [Applause]
[1:31:11] May be seated.
[1:31:13] Christ is that stone.
[1:31:15] Watch. And his spirit cause the strength
[1:31:18] of that headstone, the strength of the
[1:31:22] headstone run through the church like a
[1:31:24] magnet.
[1:31:25] And we have got to be magnetized
[1:31:28] to the headstone.
[1:31:29] You have got to get the magnetism
[1:31:31] because the magnet don't take up pen and
[1:31:34] cloth and wood. It has to pick up things
[1:31:37] with the same properties.
[1:31:38] So Christ will pick up faith and virtue
[1:31:41] and knowledge and temperance and
[1:31:43] patience and godliness and brotherly
[1:31:45] kindness. He going to pull that up.
[1:31:47] That's why these things have to be in
[1:31:49] you.
[1:31:51] [Applause]
[1:32:01] Christ the mission of God revealed. The
[1:32:03] bride body must follow the head
[1:32:05] for it is part of the resurrection and
[1:32:08] part of the mystery.
[1:32:09] And as the head was took from the grave,
[1:32:11] so must the body follow him back to
[1:32:13] Eden.
[1:32:13] Amen. We talking about head
[1:32:15] and the body.
[1:32:17] The body have to follow him back to
[1:32:18] Eden.
[1:32:19] When Adam lost the book was the book of
[1:32:21] authority, the deed and everything else.
[1:32:23] If that book is restored, we must see
[1:32:24] evidence of it.
[1:32:25] So that's why brother Brandham had to
[1:32:27] demonstrate what Adam had.
[1:32:29] Son come out and shine four days before
[1:32:31] the doctors and touches my wife. The
[1:32:33] tumor will go down. He was demonstrating
[1:32:35] what Adam had.
[1:32:36] Spoken with power that has been
[1:32:38] restored. Not will be.
[1:32:41] It has been. Amen.
[1:32:43] Amen.
[1:32:44] Brother was evidence of it.
[1:32:46] And the angel stand with the book open.
[1:32:49] And the voice said, "Go to the angel."
[1:32:51] And people sit down in church.
[1:32:53] Go to the angel. And people are asking
[1:32:54] for the book. Go to the angel. And
[1:32:56] they're asking this man and that man and
[1:32:57] that man. And they're not going to the
[1:32:58] angel.
[1:32:59] But the voice told John,
[1:33:01] John typed the pray.
[1:33:06] Give me your
[1:33:08] glory. Amen.
[1:33:10] That's what you got to say. gives me the
[1:33:19] Do you understand what Jesus did?
[1:33:21] Like you go a store, you don't have the
[1:33:22] full money
[1:33:23] and you have part of the money and you
[1:33:24] pay or you pay for it. They give you a
[1:33:26] receipt
[1:33:27] and he's not coming back to pick it up.
[1:33:29] So Jesus take his blood, pay the price
[1:33:31] for you as coming back.
[1:33:33] That will be my second coming.
[1:33:35] Satan, the price is paid for.
[1:33:38] So whether you like it or not, you have
[1:33:39] been redeemed
[1:33:41] by the blood.
[1:33:43] When you're feeling certain tonight, you
[1:33:44] could feel back. That's your feelings.
[1:33:46] That has nothing to do with what God
[1:33:47] said.
[1:33:50] I am not preaching to your feelings. I
[1:33:53] am not preaching to your humanistic
[1:33:54] self.
[1:33:55] I am preaching to the mystery inside of
[1:33:58] you.
[1:34:04] When
[1:34:04] I drop this bomb on you, you are not the
[1:34:06] believer. Amen.
[1:34:08] He said the word in you is the believer.
[1:34:12] Come on now.
[1:34:13] You are not the believer.
[1:34:19] Oh, you are blessed tonight
[1:34:21] to have the ability to shout and say
[1:34:22] amen and glory.
[1:34:24] Some churches that can hear amen and
[1:34:25] that.
[1:34:26] Oh hallelujah. Remember I got three kind
[1:34:28] of believers.
[1:34:30] You are true believer tonight.
[1:34:32] You believe all the word heard.
[1:34:34] Oh hallelujah. Praise God. So brother
[1:34:37] says therefore let me go the body cannot
[1:34:42] recognize any other headship but the
[1:34:44] word
[1:34:46] that is why we can't recognize no
[1:34:48] message pope
[1:34:49] no message bishop
[1:34:51] no message pontiff no big man in the
[1:34:54] message you have to hear we don't
[1:34:56] recognize that
[1:34:57] it only have one headl
[1:34:59] hallelujah it's not in America it's not
[1:35:02] in Europe it's not in Africa it's not in
[1:35:05] in in in in the South America, it's
[1:35:07] Christ.
[1:35:11] So when the seven angels
[1:35:13] came from eternity
[1:35:14] to gather up the scattered word, the
[1:35:17] prophet said
[1:35:18] to tie it back into the word to bring
[1:35:20] down the Holy Ghost. Let's say that
[1:35:22] again.
[1:35:22] That's a full quote.
[1:35:24] I can't read Holy Ghost tonight.
[1:35:26] I have a gift to bring out quotes. Don't
[1:35:27] worry.
[1:35:28] Don't know what I'm called to do.
[1:35:30] Seven angels come from eternity
[1:35:33] to gather up the scattered word
[1:35:35] to tie back into the word
[1:35:37] to bring down the Holy Ghost.
[1:35:39] When that job was finished
[1:35:41] because that's loose ends picked up
[1:35:43] picked up picked up picture.
[1:35:44] When it was finished,
[1:35:46] go tell the prophet, "Are you looking at
[1:35:47] the picture the right way?"
[1:35:52] Because after everything is tied up,
[1:35:55] after you run out of sevens,
[1:35:57] you got to take the seven
[1:35:58] and turn it. And when you turn it,
[1:36:01] you will see the head.
[1:36:05] [Applause]
[1:36:10] That's the head
[1:36:12] that is connecting to the body.
[1:36:19] Oh, glory.
[1:36:20] Hallelujah.
[1:36:22] So, we are united under one headship
[1:36:24] which is Christ.
[1:36:25] Oh, praise the name of the Lord.
[1:36:27] Hallelujah. So, but right now God of his
[1:36:30] evil age almost done. Watch. In
[1:36:33] obedience, this little faith woman that
[1:36:36] lives by faith the bride, watch believes
[1:36:39] the word of God, obedient, waiting in
[1:36:42] love for the promise of the age to be
[1:36:44] confirmed.
[1:36:46] She is watching for it.
[1:36:47] She is part of that word.
[1:36:49] She is watching for her life to manifest
[1:36:52] that word.
[1:36:53] Brethren, can't you see? I hope that
[1:36:55] didn't go for you.
[1:36:56] The body. Here we go.
[1:36:58] The body is waiting for which is the
[1:37:00] word.
[1:37:01] So then the body becomes the word
[1:37:03] is waiting for the spirit which is the
[1:37:06] life. Waiting for the life which is the
[1:37:07] spirit to confirm or make the life. That
[1:37:10] is what she's waiting for. No other life
[1:37:13] will work in her.
[1:37:15] [Music]
[1:37:17] You can't tell me go here that will work
[1:37:18] for me.
[1:37:19] That's right.
[1:37:19] Believe this here. Believe this
[1:37:20] doctrine. People ask doctrine. The devil
[1:37:22] only laughing.
[1:37:23] Amen.
[1:37:24] Amen.
[1:37:25] Yes. Because when the world comes on
[1:37:27] churches and they begin to tighten up in
[1:37:28] this message.
[1:37:29] Oh yeah. You see what happening
[1:37:30] internationally when they start to begin
[1:37:32] to bring the squeeze. You can't say
[1:37:35] challenge the squeeze with a quote with
[1:37:36] a book.
[1:37:38] So God can prophet in the last days.
[1:37:43] Satan loose and you hang in a book
[1:37:46] that you hang for 50 years. Instead of
[1:37:48] you become the book, you still giving up
[1:37:49] a book.
[1:37:51] At that time we have to be written this
[1:37:54] episode. Hallelujah.
[1:37:56] We have to be the book by then.
[1:37:59] Yes, sir.
[1:38:00] In other words, talk over.
[1:38:07] You understand what we saying?
[1:38:09] Look, look. Jesus said in Matthew, go
[1:38:11] into all the world and and and baptize
[1:38:12] them in the name of the father, son, and
[1:38:14] holy ghost. That what the tape say?
[1:38:17] Amen.
[1:38:17] If you play that tape every day,
[1:38:19] you hear Jesus saying that every day.
[1:38:21] Go back, father, son, and holy ghost.
[1:38:23] But you will still have to hear a man of
[1:38:25] God.
[1:38:26] That's right,
[1:38:26] Peter.
[1:38:27] So, repent every one of you.
[1:38:29] That's not on the tape.
[1:38:30] There's a revelation of what on the
[1:38:31] tape.
[1:38:31] Repent every one of you and be baptized
[1:38:33] in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:38:34] for the remission of your sins and you
[1:38:36] shall receive the gift of the Holy
[1:38:37] Ghost.
[1:38:38] It will take a revelation of man of God.
[1:38:41] To bring a revelation of what's on the
[1:38:42] tape.
[1:38:44] Oh, hallelujah.
[1:38:45] That's what Peter did.
[1:38:46] So, not it's more than plain tape.
[1:38:48] Still need a revelation of what's on
[1:38:50] that tape.
[1:38:51] Oh, give the Lord some praises, people.
[1:38:53] Glory to God. Give the Lord a shout,
[1:39:01] brother.
[1:39:03] Watch. Pick your pen and write. Almost
[1:39:04] done. Watch. The very law applies to the
[1:39:07] church today. Whatever seed started the
[1:39:09] church will come forth and be like the
[1:39:10] original seed because the same seed in
[1:39:13] the last days. The true by church,
[1:39:15] Christ seed will come to the headstone.
[1:39:17] She will be a super church,
[1:39:19] a super race
[1:39:20] as she nears him.
[1:39:22] At least the part I don't know this is
[1:39:24] the part that gets to me. They in the
[1:39:26] bride will be so much like him.
[1:39:30] Hallelujah.
[1:39:31] That they will be in his very image.
[1:39:35] That's right.
[1:39:39] Glory.
[1:39:43] Oh my my my. You know as I say that my
[1:39:46] fashion on first Corinthians 13 charity
[1:39:48] stuff it along on the screen does not
[1:39:52] thinkketh no evil rejoices not in
[1:39:53] iniquity trust in the truth beareth all
[1:39:56] things that's Jesus believeth all things
[1:39:59] hope at all things endureth all things
[1:40:01] charities is not jealous it's not
[1:40:03] envious it is courteous it is kind
[1:40:07] it looks for the best in people
[1:40:09] this is what the love of God does and
[1:40:11] guess what it never fails
[1:40:13] [Applause]
[1:40:14] [Music]
[1:40:15] they're going to be so much like him
[1:40:17] he met the woman at the well and he
[1:40:19] treat her right he said go call your
[1:40:21] husband. He said, "I have none." He
[1:40:22] said, "Your one living with is not
[1:40:24] yours. You had five before."
[1:40:26] And I done with you. I done talk.
[1:40:29] He didn't say that.
[1:40:30] He He came to to bring a message to that
[1:40:32] woman.
[1:40:33] He came to to show her her name.
[1:40:35] He was the book itself.
[1:40:37] She was clueless
[1:40:38] of of where she come from, where she
[1:40:40] going, and what state she was in. It
[1:40:42] take Christ to open the word to her.
[1:40:44] Then say, "I that speak to you, I'm
[1:40:46] healed."
[1:40:47] And she ran. That's when they get
[1:40:48] revelation. Start to run. She got
[1:40:50] excited. She had go home and put on the
[1:40:52] best dress and say, you know, how to
[1:40:53] make up a thing and fix the clothes to
[1:40:55] go and tell people something. No, no,
[1:40:56] no. She run just as she was
[1:40:58] because she was free.
[1:40:59] When you free, you don't care who in
[1:41:01] front of you, who behind you, who are
[1:41:04] gone. You don't care.
[1:41:12] What about him? From a little group.
[1:41:14] Okay. The first son, Adam, was the
[1:41:16] spoken seed word of God. He was given a
[1:41:19] bride to reproduce himself. That's the
[1:41:21] purpose.
[1:41:22] What's the purpose? Adam was given a
[1:41:24] bride to reproduce himself. Why would
[1:41:27] Christ want a bride?
[1:41:30] To reproduce himself.
[1:41:32] So in our words, once the bride body
[1:41:34] comes forth, we supposed to see more
[1:41:36] Jesus,
[1:41:39] not less Jesus.
[1:41:40] More Jesus.
[1:41:42] Because you're supposed to see a
[1:41:43] reproduction
[1:41:45] of himself.
[1:41:47] Let's take it the other way. A seed. You
[1:41:48] put a seed in the ground. Talk about
[1:41:50] that. Up. Go a little stalk.
[1:41:52] That's not the seed. Leaf. That's not
[1:41:53] the seed. When it go through the
[1:41:55] processes, it come back to what?
[1:41:56] Seed.
[1:41:58] Seed in the beginning.
[1:41:59] Seed in the ending. I am alpha and
[1:42:02] omega. Christ in the beginning. Christ
[1:42:03] in the ending.
[1:42:04] Christ didn't finish his work on earth.
[1:42:06] He leave the rest for a bride.
[1:42:10] That's why there is one body,
[1:42:13] one bride body, one spirit coming to
[1:42:15] that body. That's the dynamic
[1:42:18] to the mechanics.
[1:42:20] Is this the mystery of the thunders that
[1:42:23] will bring back a power into the church?
[1:42:26] Will we jump and run and leap over
[1:42:27] walls?
[1:42:29] Oh, hallelujah.
[1:42:30] Hallelujah.
[1:42:30] Says, is this the time
[1:42:32] for the manifestation of those seven
[1:42:34] voices?
[1:42:36] Wait till them seven thunders.
[1:42:38] Up the voices in that group.
[1:42:39] Yes, sir.
[1:42:40] Oh, hallelujah.
[1:42:42] Listen to brother Bam. from a little
[1:42:44] group of the true seed of the word. God
[1:42:46] represent Christ, a beloved bride. She's
[1:42:48] a virgin to his word.
[1:42:50] She's a virgin because she knows no
[1:42:52] man-made creed or dogmas.
[1:42:54] Those in the bride
[1:42:55] will do only his will.
[1:42:57] Amen.
[1:42:57] Get this bum. No one
[1:42:59] can make them do otherwise.
[1:43:01] They find you're stubborn. Yes, sir.
[1:43:03] They find you're not breaking.
[1:43:05] Hallelujah. You're only in in the will
[1:43:06] of God.
[1:43:08] But no one
[1:43:09] can make them do otherwise. They have
[1:43:11] thus say the Lord
[1:43:13] or they keep still.
[1:43:15] They know it has to be God in them
[1:43:18] doing the works
[1:43:19] fulfilling his own word.
[1:43:21] He did not complete all his works while
[1:43:23] he was in his earthly ministry.
[1:43:25] So now he works in and through the
[1:43:27] bride.
[1:43:28] She becomes God's final mercy seat.
[1:43:31] She becomes the blood of God on the
[1:43:33] earth.
[1:43:34] Oh, the voice going to be in the bride
[1:43:37] and the spirit and the bread
[1:43:39] will say come.
[1:43:41] Oh, hallelujah.
[1:43:43] He is the dynamics.
[1:43:44] There we go.
[1:43:45] He is the dynamics.
[1:43:47] We become members of the machine of his
[1:43:49] body,
[1:43:51] forming ourselves into his image
[1:43:53] and see him uniting himself with us
[1:43:55] with his love's gifts as he hand them
[1:43:57] before the wedding supper. The dynamics
[1:43:59] of this church will be a refilling of
[1:44:00] the Holy Spirit which you have work in a
[1:44:02] small measure while the headstone is
[1:44:04] coming down
[1:44:05] tonight with the body
[1:44:06] and then the head and the body units
[1:44:08] together.
[1:44:09] The dynamics is the Holy Spirit.
[1:44:12] Oh praise the name of the Lord.
[1:44:14] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:44:16] Oh my.
[1:44:18] We all done.
[1:44:20] Hallelujah.
[1:44:22] But I'm talking about luck. He said now
[1:44:24] the motives of it if you just get it in
[1:44:26] for somebody that's different. If a man
[1:44:29] is guilty Lot went down and backslid
[1:44:32] though he was a Hebrew he went down and
[1:44:33] was backslid. He was in grace but he
[1:44:36] fall from it. Lot was saved. Don't ever
[1:44:38] think he wasn't saved because all the
[1:44:40] time he was in the wrong place. The
[1:44:41] Bible said the sins of Sodom grieved so
[1:44:44] deeply.
[1:44:45] Now his flesh was doing one thing and
[1:44:47] what was his end? He brought more
[1:44:49] disgraces. Wife turned up a sword. He
[1:44:51] had children by his daughter. So you can
[1:44:52] see what a disgrace it brought because
[1:44:54] he had fallen from grace and never
[1:44:57] restored himself back again. And God had
[1:44:59] to take him off the earth. But still,
[1:45:01] here we go. He was a fallen brother. And
[1:45:04] Abraham, here we go, done all that he
[1:45:06] could
[1:45:07] to bring him back again.
[1:45:09] And that was the spirit that was in
[1:45:11] Abraham is the spirit of Christ that's
[1:45:15] in the church today.
[1:45:17] But Ram said in the church today,
[1:45:19] we we could say this with that should be
[1:45:20] in the church today. Amen.
[1:45:24] No matter what the brother has done,
[1:45:27] you will do all you can
[1:45:29] to bring him back
[1:45:31] into fellowship of Christ again.
[1:45:33] No matter what he's done, you will try
[1:45:36] hard.
[1:45:41] I'm talking about the slave
[1:45:43] from Africa and the man wanted to buy
[1:45:45] him
[1:45:46] and the slave owner said, "No, he's not
[1:45:47] for sale." He said, "He's so much
[1:45:49] different from the other." I know it.
[1:45:50] Amen.
[1:45:51] What's your price for him?
[1:45:52] I told you he's not for sale.
[1:45:54] Is he the boss over the rest of them?
[1:45:56] No. He's a slave.
[1:45:57] Do you feed him different from the rest
[1:45:58] of them? No. They all eat all the same
[1:46:01] food.
[1:46:02] He said, "What makes this man so
[1:46:03] different?"
[1:46:04] He said, "You know what? I wondered
[1:46:06] about that myself." And I found out that
[1:46:08] over in the homeland in Africa,
[1:46:10] his father is the king of the tribe.
[1:46:12] And though he's an alien away from home,
[1:46:15] he knows in his heart, here we go. not
[1:46:18] here
[1:46:19] in his heart
[1:46:20] that he's a king's son
[1:46:22] and he conducts himself like a king's
[1:46:24] son.
[1:46:25] What ought we to do?
[1:46:27] How should we act?
[1:46:29] How should we conduct ourselves as sons
[1:46:31] and daughters of the king?
[1:46:33] Oh, it's far down the road. We will be
[1:46:35] one.
[1:46:36] Oh my.
[1:46:37] They are united under one hand.
[1:46:39] He said, "We will be one." Like the
[1:46:42] great temple when it went together,
[1:46:44] there wasn't a buzz of the saw or song
[1:46:46] of a hammer for 40 years.
[1:46:48] God is cutting them out of Betterist
[1:46:50] Baptist.
[1:46:52] And they will go together without a
[1:46:53] memorial one of these days.
[1:46:54] Brother Brandham, he was under the
[1:46:57] anointing. And they begin to speak this
[1:46:59] way. He said, "Oh, how wonderful. How
[1:47:01] glorious. I know he's present. I wish
[1:47:03] you felt like I do. I know I may look
[1:47:06] silly. I am not. You may think I don't
[1:47:08] know where I am, but I do. Oh, it's the
[1:47:11] spirit of the living God. I can't preach
[1:47:13] no more. There is something. The joy
[1:47:15] bears of glory has just setting on me. I
[1:47:17] have never had it happen like that. Just
[1:47:19] something I know. And he prophesying
[1:47:21] here now. I know there's coming a time.
[1:47:25] There's coming something that going to
[1:47:26] take place. I see it in the near future.
[1:47:29] The spirit of the living God falling
[1:47:32] fresh on his church.
[1:47:33] There's going to be something take
[1:47:35] place. God, something just spoke to my
[1:47:37] heart. Fear not, preacher. They'll be
[1:47:39] one one of these days.
[1:47:41] They believe it may take persecution to
[1:47:43] drive us together, but God will drive
[1:47:46] his church together. Just as certain as
[1:47:49] I'm standing in the pulpit
[1:47:50] under one that's Christ. Christ will be
[1:47:53] the head.
[1:47:54] No denomination will be the head. Christ
[1:47:56] will be the head of every believer.
[1:47:58] On this rock, I'll build my church. I'll
[1:48:01] unite my church together under the
[1:48:03] domain of the Holy Ghost. And all the
[1:48:05] gates of hell shall not prevail against
[1:48:07] it.
[1:48:07] Amen. Why I want to be united under the
[1:48:10] power and leadership of the Holy Spirit.
[1:48:12] We are witness to every word that it is
[1:48:14] true.
[1:48:15] May the Lord bless you.
[1:48:34] Can we stand to our feet church? We
[1:48:35] appreciate this message. Hallelujah.
[1:48:38] Hallelujah. All over the world, the
[1:48:40] spirit is moving.
[1:48:42] Hallelujah. One body, one Lord, one
[1:48:44] faith, one this, one that. Hallelujah.

[1:48:50] a key. Give us a key. Nice and loud.
[1:48:52] Praise be to God.
[1:48:55] All over the world,
[1:48:59] the spirit

[1:51:30] with a mighty revelation
[1:51:35] of the coming of the Lord
[1:51:39] and the waters cover the sea.
[1:51:44] Who can shout amen to that? Say
[1:51:47] hallelujah. It's in the hands of the
[1:51:49] Lord.
[1:51:50] He is doing it. Is the Lord's doing it.

[1:56:03] Thank you Jesus. Hallelujah.
[1:56:07] He was telling me the detail about the
[1:56:09] convention, how the person was healed.
[1:56:11] It was glorious. I tell you,
[1:56:13] this is what we're looking for. You
[1:56:15] know, I I love what he said something
[1:56:16] like this that that it's not coming a
[1:56:18] time where you're going to give a quote.
[1:56:20] You go beyond that.
[1:56:22] The quotes have gone in, gone in, then
[1:56:24] that transformed into
[1:56:27] spirit again.
[1:56:29] Amen. And now now you you become the
[1:56:31] epistle.
[1:56:32] You're not giving out books anymore, but
[1:56:33] you now become it.
[1:56:35] You say, "Silver and gold, I have none,
[1:56:38] but such as I have, I give thee in the
[1:56:41] name of the Lord." Let's appreciate the
[1:56:42] Holy Spirit tonight. God has blessed us
[1:56:44] greatly, greatly, greatly, greatly.
[1:56:48] Praise be to God. Amen. Amen. Let's all
[1:56:50] be seated. Amen. Hallelujah. We give God
[1:56:54] all the glory for the word tonight. We

[1:56:58] settles it. Praise be to God. Amen.
[1:57:01] Brother Devin, great to see you tonight.
[1:57:03] Amen. I'm going to ask you to pray.
[1:57:04] Okay, just I'm going to finish up here.
[1:57:06] Come and close in a word of prayer.
[1:57:07] Amen. Then I just want to say this that
[1:57:10] uh we've greeted. That's right. anybody
[1:57:12] we haven't greeted. Welcome. Welcome.
[1:57:14] Praise be to God. I appreciate brother
[1:57:16] Theo giving us this time. He's out
[1:57:18] tomorrow at uh you know he's got a
[1:57:21] report like 7:00 in the morning. Now
[1:57:23] after this I've got to drive him to
[1:57:25] Gatwick. So you know he's going to get a
[1:57:26] short night. So I need to see some I
[1:57:29] might even phone you brother Joe about
[1:57:30] that. Uh it's just to conserve the time.
[1:57:32] You understand? I'm sure. Yeah. And then
[1:57:34] I come I thank you. One or two others
[1:57:36] want to see me after. Please thank you
[1:57:37] for understanding. I'd rather get God's
[1:57:39] servant back so that he can just get
[1:57:42] some rest. He has certainly poured
[1:57:44] himself out today.
[1:57:45] And then let him be ready for his flight
[1:57:47] early tomorrow and out out of Gatwick.
[1:57:50] And may God bless him on his journey. We
[1:57:52] pray. And uh may God bless the saints
[1:57:54] out in Africa where he's ministered to
[1:57:56] them. We appreciate all these different
[1:57:58] efforts. You know, there's a great work
[1:57:59] going on. The fields are white. Amen. We
[1:58:03] just want to just recap. Uh Saturday, of
[1:58:06] course, there's the big uh activity day
[1:58:10] going up the road here and um that's
[1:58:12] going to be between 1 and five. Is that
[1:58:14] right, brother Gerald? I think he's he's
[1:58:16] not quite he's maybe back there. One and
[1:58:18] five as per the the slide if it's if
[1:58:21] it's around. And then uh that's right.
[1:58:24] One, two, five. Okay. Now, in between
[1:58:26] that, I propose between two and three.
[1:58:28] I'm going to be on the the streets. I
[1:58:30] just want to do a bit of street
[1:58:31] preaching. Brother Devin kindly agreed
[1:58:33] to come and join us. Amen. So, anybody
[1:58:35] want to join? You're most welcome. Amen.
[1:58:37] As long as the word gets out, that's all
[1:58:38] we know. The word gets scattered. Amen.
[1:58:41] Hallelujah. Among the people, that's all
[1:58:43] we want. And uh I just pray that God
[1:58:45] would bless in a very wonderful way.
[1:58:47] 1:00 to 5:00. Then when we finish
[1:58:48] preaching, we'll come back and rejoin uh
[1:58:51] back here or back up at the hall as as
[1:58:54] the Lord will help us. This Sunday is
[1:58:58] not a 10:00 service as it would have
[1:59:00] been. It is now what time?
[1:59:02] 2:00.
[1:59:03] 2:00. Okay. 1400 2:00, 2 p.m. Anybody
[1:59:07] that you can possibly think of that
[1:59:09] might miss that and be a casualty, give
[1:59:11] them a quick call, email, WhatsApp,
[1:59:12] text, whatever to let them know it is
[1:59:15] going to be not 10:00, but 2:00 because
[1:59:18] it's going to be our Lord's Supper
[1:59:20] service. So, we're going to have that
[1:59:21] and then God's going to help us. Um, and
[1:59:24] also on Monday, of course, is it's it's
[1:59:25] a bank holiday weekend. So, hey, we're
[1:59:28] not really counting. We just believe
[1:59:29] that God's going to add his great great
[1:59:31] blessings. church. I've been greatly
[1:59:34] blessed and as I said earlier, time is a
[1:59:36] premium and it continues to be because I
[1:59:38] want to get the preacher back to his
[1:59:40] hotel and I just want to say may the
[1:59:42] Lord richly bless you. We've been
[1:59:44] greatly blessed tonight. Some very big
[1:59:46] significant meaningful things have been
[1:59:48] spoken and we appreciate all the
[1:59:51] five-fold ministry of which brother is
[1:59:53] one. May God bless him, his dear wife
[1:59:56] and family back in Trinidad. We
[1:59:57] appreciate them and the church for
[1:59:59] releasing their pastor that we can be so
[2:00:01] blessed. You can say amen to that and
[2:00:02] give God one more clap out of praise.
[2:00:04] Hallelujah.
[2:00:06] As brother Devin gets ready to close in
[2:00:08] a word of prayer. I don't think there's
[2:00:09] any other announcements. I don't think
[2:00:11] there is. Know ye not. Know ye not. Ye
[2:00:15] are the temple.
[2:00:18] Oh, know ye not. No ye not.
[2:00:26] No.
[2:00:28] No. We are the temple.
[2:00:33] We are the temple of
[2:00:39] Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. I was
[2:00:41] truly blessed tonight. I'm really glad,
[2:00:43] you know. I'm feeling I want God's
[2:00:45] servant to go and get plenty of rest.
[2:00:47] So, you know, so he won't hold him up,
[2:00:48] you know, but I just shall we bow our
[2:00:50] heads of prayer.
[2:00:52] Lord Jesus, thank you for your amazing
[2:00:54] grace, Lord. Thank you, dear God, for
[2:00:57] presenting brother Theo this way, Lord,
[2:00:58] to bless us, Father. Lord God, we will
[2:01:01] walk out here knowing, dear God, that it
[2:01:03] was good for us to be here,
[2:01:05] Father God. We thank you, Lord God, for
[2:01:07] sending such a great marriage, such
[2:01:09] great ministry, Lord, to be such a
[2:01:11] blessing unto us, Father. Dear God, I
[2:01:13] thank you again for your grace, Father.
[2:01:15] We can truly say, Lord, that we are the
[2:01:18] manifested word of God in this end time,
[2:01:20] Lord. Our God has been confirmed,
[2:01:22] Father, by the preaching of the word
[2:01:24] today, tonight, dear God. Father Gord, I
[2:01:26] pray you bless him, Lord. Bless his
[2:01:28] family, bless his church in Trinidad,
[2:01:29] dear God, and all that he does, Father.
[2:01:32] Thank you again for sending him here,
[2:01:33] Father. Lord God, as we go to various
[2:01:36] place or various homes in our jobs
[2:01:37] tomorrow, Lord God, I pray Lord that you
[2:01:40] send an angel Lord camp around us,
[2:01:42] Father, wherever we may be, whatever we
[2:01:45] may do, Lord God, that other people may
[2:01:47] see the light just living and shining
[2:01:49] out of our lives. Dear God, thank you
[2:01:51] again for your grace now in Jesus name.
[2:01:54] Amen. Thank you.
[2:01:59] [Applause]
[2:02:00] God bless your church. Shake somebody's
[2:02:02] hand as we get ready to go. Go safely.
[2:02:04] Pray for us. And we see you Saturday. We
[2:02:06] see you Saturday 2 p.m. Lord Saber. God
[2:02:09] bless you. Thank you musicians, ushers.
