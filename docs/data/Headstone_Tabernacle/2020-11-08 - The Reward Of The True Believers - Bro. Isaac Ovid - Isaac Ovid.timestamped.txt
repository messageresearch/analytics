[28:37] reading from revelation 22
[28:41] uh reading from verse 10 revelation 22
[28:44] and reading from verse 10
[28:55] revelation 22 and verse 10 and he saith
[28:57] unto me seal not the sayings
[29:00] of the prophecy of this book for the
[29:02] time is at hand
[29:04] he that is unjust let him be unjust
[29:07] still
[29:08] and he which is filthy let him be filthy
[29:10] still and he that is righteous let him
[29:12] be righteous still
[29:14] and he that is holy let him be holy
[29:16] still and behold i come quickly and my
[29:19] reward
[29:20] is with me to give every man according
[29:23] as his work shall be
[29:25] i am alpha and omega the beginning and
[29:28] the end the first
[29:29] and the last blessed are they that do
[29:32] his commandments that they may have
[29:34] right
[29:34] to the tree of life and may enter in
[29:37] through the gates
[29:38] into the city for without or for outside
[29:42] are dogs and sorcerers and hormones
[29:44] and murderers and idolaters and who so
[29:48] loveth and make it a lie i jesus
[29:51] have sent mine angel to testify unto you
[29:54] these things in the churches i am the
[29:56] root
[29:57] and the offspring of david and the
[29:59] bright and morning sir
[30:01] and the spirit and the bride say come
[30:03] and let him that hear it say come
[30:05] and let him that is a thirst come and
[30:07] whosoever will
[30:08] let him take the water of life freely
[30:11] for i testify
[30:12] unto every man that heareth the words of
[30:14] the prophecy of this book
[30:16] if any man shall add unto these things
[30:18] god shall add unto him the plagues
[30:21] that are written in this book and if any
[30:23] man shall
[30:24] take away from the words of the book of
[30:26] this prophecy
[30:28] god shall take away his part out of the
[30:30] book of life and out of the holy city
[30:32] and from the things which are written in
[30:34] this book he which
[30:36] testified these things said surely i
[30:38] come quickly amen
[30:40] even so come lord jesus may the lord
[30:43] have a blessing
[30:44] to the reading of his word this morning
[30:45] you may be seated
[30:47] in the presence of the law this morning
[30:49] certainly great to be
[30:51] in the atmosphere this morning and you
[30:54] have a right to create
[30:55] your atmosphere you have a right to
[30:57] create your
[30:58] environment this morning so for a title
[31:01] this morning the reward
[31:03] of the true believers the reward of the
[31:06] true believers and i'm
[31:07] i'm pulling that from revelation 22
[31:10] and verse 12 and behold i come quickly
[31:14] and my reward is with me it is not just
[31:17] he has a reward but is to give
[31:19] every man according as his work shall be
[31:22] can the church say amen
[31:24] so there's a reward that's coming to the
[31:26] true believers
[31:27] your believing will not be in vain your
[31:30] sacrifice will not be in vain your
[31:32] worship will not be in vain one time the
[31:34] scribes and the pharisees
[31:36] came to jesus asking him about the
[31:38] disciples and he switched on them and
[31:40] said in vain
[31:41] do they worship me so there are many
[31:43] people that are worshiping in vain but
[31:45] they're also
[31:46] individuals who are worshiping in spirit
[31:49] and in truth can the church say amen
[31:51] amen so just for an announcement we are
[31:54] back to regular services on wednesday

[32:11] ramp up can the church say amen
[32:13] we're an army and we're reporting for
[32:14] duty we are taking our positions because
[32:17] we're getting to leave here we are
[32:18] getting ready to
[32:19] go into this astronaut hallelujah this
[32:22] this rocket we are astronauts getting
[32:24] ready to leave this place amen
[32:26] and it won't be an indisciplined
[32:28] approach it's a disciplined approach
[32:29] to get ready to leave here can the
[32:31] church say amen so the reward
[32:33] of the true believers are you looking
[32:36] for reward
[32:37] hallelujah do you want to get the reward
[32:39] that god
[32:40] has for you for all these years he sent
[32:42] every prophet he sent
[32:44] was with a blessing and he brought
[32:46] prophets with judgment
[32:47] so it was always judgment and blessings
[32:49] blessings of those who stayed with the
[32:51] word
[32:51] and judgment to those who didn't stay
[32:53] with the world it's not a
[32:54] complicated thing it's a very simple
[32:56] thing and the more i look at the world
[32:58] i see the simplicity of this gospel how
[33:01] god is so
[33:01] simple he is so powerful but he is so
[33:04] simple
[33:05] it's not complicated people trying to
[33:07] interpret interpret interpret but the
[33:09] manifestation
[33:10] will be the interpretation we don't need
[33:12] to interpret it can the church say amen
[33:15] so i know there are many people who want
[33:16] to know what what what we're going to
[33:18] say about the u.s election and these
[33:20] things
[33:22] so that that's but the clarence that's
[33:24] above my pay grade you know why
[33:26] i've heard so many things over the years
[33:28] in the message
[33:29] i remember when hillary clinton was
[33:30] going up i think was against trump there
[33:33] were
[33:33] preachers all over the message saying
[33:35] hillary is going to win that's going to
[33:36] be the woman
[33:37] and i haven't seen many repent for
[33:39] making those statements
[33:42] people saying this people are saying
[33:44] that it's not my place to say this or
[33:46] that i know what the prophet said
[33:47] he said the catholic church is rising
[33:49] there's going to be a woman one day
[33:51] and there are people who are studying
[33:52] that but if your heart is not right to
[33:54] go into rapture
[33:55] that will not help you so i want to keep
[33:57] the focus this morning
[33:59] on what the focus is hallelujah
[34:01] everything has to find its place
[34:03] but the bride has to find her place
[34:05] hallelujah
[34:07] the unbelievers they have their reward
[34:09] also because they are wages to sin
[34:11] wage is a reward the wages of sin are
[34:14] still dead
[34:14] hallelujah but the bride has a reward
[34:17] also
[34:17] so i don't want to come this morning and
[34:19] spend all the time
[34:21] analyzing the political implications
[34:24] and the spiritual dimensions of what's
[34:26] happening over there
[34:27] hallelujah that has its place up but i
[34:30] want to be ready
[34:31] when the call to the rapture the call to
[34:33] the resurrection
[34:34] to call to the holy city oh hallelujah
[34:38] that's what i want to be ready for
[34:40] oh hallelujah the manifestation
[34:43] will be the interpretation that's all i
[34:45] need to know
[34:46] who god will move because he is in
[34:48] control
[34:49] nothing could happen listen you may be
[34:51] seated man
[34:52] so much happened people praying people
[34:55] doing all kind of things
[34:56] people the amount of false prophecies
[34:58] and change of prophecies i saw this week
[35:02] i went by my dad i swim look at this
[35:04] prophet change his prophecy
[35:06] one prophet said i prophesy trump will
[35:08] rin then he said i feel something change
[35:10] in the balance
[35:13] and if you keep up with it and it's so
[35:16] much and i say but how many people
[35:18] are really getting into am i right am i
[35:21] ready

[35:25] what about my family
[35:26] i don't want to know about the us
[35:28] government election if my family is in
[35:30] trouble
[35:31] i want to know my family can make it
[35:33] into the act of safety
[35:34] i want to know that the blood is being
[35:36] applied on my house
[35:38] on my family i want my reward
[35:41] for being a true believer can the church
[35:44] say amen
[35:45] that's how i feel that's my
[35:47] understanding
[35:48] that's my inspiration that's my
[35:50] revelation
[35:51] we have to be ready
[35:54] the scripture we said behold i come
[35:56] quickly and my reward is with
[35:58] me hallelujah the time is short
[36:01] you may be seated hallelujah
[36:05] hallelujah you see this pandemic
[36:08] is doing a lot of different things a lot
[36:11] is going on you know
[36:13] but anthony i was praying trying to see
[36:15] where to go this morning and i almost
[36:17] brought a message
[36:18] about has the pandemic taken your
[36:19] worship
[36:23] because it's easy to get complacent it's
[36:26] easy to get into a routine it's a
[36:29] it's easy to be at ease in zion but when
[36:31] i read behold i come quickly
[36:34] and my reward is with me he is coming
[36:37] all of a sudden and he's bringing a
[36:38] reward
[36:40] it's not a reward to everybody it's not
[36:42] the reward to church members
[36:44] it's not the reward of message believers
[36:46] but as it will reward
[36:48] the overcomers who overcome the lust of
[36:50] the eyes
[36:51] they overcome the lusts of the flesh
[36:53] they overcome the no praise demons
[36:56] they overcome the political
[36:57] instabilities they overcome the economic
[36:59] instabilities
[37:00] because they know they come from another
[37:02] place where we have a different
[37:04] government
[37:05] where we have a different structure it's
[37:07] not by election
[37:08] and by votes but by predestination
[37:11] because he for knew you
[37:12] he could predestinate you and he he is
[37:15] the one doing the election
[37:18] and because he picked you because he
[37:21] voted for you

[37:24] appointment with the holy ghost

[37:56] the terence when your eyes pop open
[37:59] and the devil can't sit on them no more

[42:09] [Music]
[42:13] you have to forgive me oh hallelujah
[42:20] reward of the true believers
[42:23] listen friends billy branham taught us
[42:26] that in
[42:26] every church every church
[42:30] no church is immune every church i don't
[42:34] care how big the church is
[42:35] i don't care what ministry is in the
[42:37] church so even when the prophet
[42:39] the greatest ministry that walk the
[42:42] earth after christ
[42:44] even when he was on the earth in his
[42:46] church in branham tabernacle there were
[42:48] three kinds of believers
[42:52] make no mistake about it
[42:56] true believers make believers
[42:59] and unbelievers and as optimistic as
[43:02] we'd like to be
[43:03] the reality is within every church is
[43:05] three kinds of believers
[43:09] you can preach as hard as you want to
[43:11] you can have every prayer meeting every
[43:13] day
[43:14] in every church we'll have three kinds
[43:16] of believers
[43:22] there are people this morning who said
[43:24] yeah i'm a believer
[43:25] and and and and they don't even
[43:27] recognize that they're make believer
[43:30] i'm not trying to weaken your faith or
[43:31] shake you up i want you to understand
[43:33] that god himself
[43:34] is defining true
[43:37] and make believers and unbelievers
[43:47] i just want to read back this script
[43:48] before i go a little further we already
[43:51] see it
[43:52] set up to me seal not the sayings of the
[43:55] prophecy of this book
[43:56] you know what don't lock it up anymore
[43:58] don't tie this up for the time is at
[44:00] hand
[44:01] if there ever was a time to be at hand
[44:03] it's now you see it
[44:06] all the plagues all the political realm
[44:08] the economic realm the sanctions
[44:10] everything you think next is going to
[44:11] get better
[44:16] see laws coming into place legislation
[44:19] coming into place where are you going to
[44:21] run to
[44:23] but in verse 11 he that is unjust let
[44:25] him be unjust still
[44:28] he which is filthy let him be filthy
[44:30] still
[44:31] in other words god is fair he he is
[44:33] immutable but iran
[44:35] said in his nature he is immutable in
[44:37] his ways which means he doesn't change
[44:38] [Music]
[44:41] he gives mercy before prolonged judgment
[44:44] every time that's his way he gives an
[44:46] opportunity before he gives judgment
[44:50] remember the branham was yeah he said
[44:51] america is finished
[44:53] we don't need to say it now that's
[44:55] that's already been spoken it's already
[44:56] settled
[44:58] he said america rejected god
[45:04] and you look around the world every
[45:05] country has rejected god
[45:08] churches have rejected god taken for
[45:11] themselves the
[45:12] commandments of men over the word of god
[45:15] having a false sense of comfort
[45:17] believing that
[45:18] believing the message or attending
[45:20] church is a criteria to make it
[45:24] but the true believers are about that
[45:26] word and about
[45:28] ensuring that word comes to pass in
[45:30] their lives because that's the
[45:31] identification of the true believers
[45:34] it has to produce a life it must turn
[45:37] into a life
[45:38] he that is unjust let him be unjust
[45:40] still he which is filthy let him be
[45:42] filthy still
[45:44] friends if there's a day if there's an
[45:46] hour before god freezes this picture
[45:48] you get your life right with god
[45:50] hallelujah
[45:51] i challenge you this morning get your
[45:53] life right with god
[45:55] we don't know if we make it to 2021 we
[45:57] don't know
[46:01] he that is righteous let him be
[46:02] righteous still and he that is holy let
[46:05] him be holy still
[46:06] and behold i come quickly and my reward
[46:09] is with me
[46:10] to give every man according as his work
[46:13] shall be
[46:16] blessed be the name of the lord from the
[46:18] message michael the prophet
[46:20] brother branham said all true prophets
[46:23] the fact that he's using the word true
[46:25] means there's false i didn't know
[46:26] brother punch how many false prophets it
[46:28] had until this week
[46:31] my dad told me one who said he know you
[46:33] say i'm a major prophet
[46:40] all true prophet adam said all true
[46:42] christians all true believers stay with
[46:44] that
[46:44] word no matter what anybody says
[46:48] you stay right with the word they say
[46:50] the days of miracles is past don't you
[46:52] believe it
[46:53] for the bible said he's the same
[46:54] yesterday today and forever
[46:56] hallelujah i'm not accepting a
[46:58] substitute that's but always conviction
[47:00] i'm not accepting a substitute i'm
[47:02] looking for a manifestation of power
[47:04] hallelujah we're not in this message
[47:06] just to have word and just have teaching
[47:08] it has to be a display of power
[47:10] some people call it pentecostal you can
[47:12] explain that and theologize that and
[47:14] intellectualize that
[47:15] but he said he's the same yesterday
[47:17] today and forever and these signs
[47:19] shall follow them that believe i'm
[47:20] swallowing onto that
[47:22] hallelujah there are needy cases in this
[47:24] church that need a miracle today
[47:26] they need a miracle that's not a
[47:28] pentecostal statement
[47:30] hallelujah i need a miracle the message
[47:32] has put that as a pentecostal statement
[47:34] is there anybody needs a miracle
[47:36] you know what a miracle is when it's
[47:38] incredible but true and god can step
[47:40] into your situation
[47:41] and the doctors give up on you like that
[47:43] prayer request we read the doctor
[47:45] doesn't know what's going on

[48:10] it's only by the believers that he can
[48:12] prove his word
[48:13] no matter how much the rest of them
[48:15] claim to be oh
[48:16] i believe brothers see if you do god
[48:19] will prove it see
[48:20] it's by true believers that he proves
[48:22] his word
[48:23] not by those who say they believe but
[48:26] those who
[48:26] really believe i've met many people over
[48:29] the years who
[48:30] say they believe but they didn't really
[48:32] believe
[48:33] but it's by his believing children that
[48:36] he proves his
[48:37] word can the church say amen
[48:39] [Applause]
[48:40] [Music]
[48:41] but abraham goes on now he had believers
[48:43] the old crop had died off
[48:45] the unbelievers who said we couldn't
[48:47] take it he let every one of them perish
[48:50] why
[48:50] every one of them but the believers who
[48:52] was left moses
[48:54] had been taken to glory and the
[48:55] unbelievers had perished in the
[48:57] wilderness
[48:57] and this was their children there were
[49:00] only two that cross over and that was
[49:02] the believers
[49:03] joshua and caleb they was the believers
[49:06] there was the one who crossed over
[49:07] it's the only way god can do it is by
[49:10] his believing children
[49:12] and how do you know hallelujah your
[49:14] believer is when you keep
[49:16] his commandments it's when you follow
[49:17] his word it's when you don't compromise
[49:19] it's when you don't give up
[49:21] it's when you don't back down it's when
[49:22] you want to find out everything that god
[49:24] said concerning you
[49:25] again a sin in his hour concerning his
[49:28] pride in this day
[49:28] can the church say amen
[49:31] [Applause]
[49:32] oh hallelujah oh glory glory glory glory
[49:37] ma my mama my my
[49:41] listen to our word but the prophet put
[49:43] it and look at this in the context of

[50:04] and the pillar of fire by night can i
[50:06] say that one more time
[50:08] so if you were measuring the activity
[50:11] you would say well they are qualified
[50:13] but look at it they all saw the same
[50:15] miracles
[50:17] so seeing miracles is not the criteria
[50:19] come on now
[50:20] all part took of the same manner they
[50:22] were eating the same food
[50:24] hallelujah coming to church and hearing
[50:26] the same messages come on now
[50:27] hallelujah and the water from the
[50:30] smitten rock
[50:32] all follow the same cloth by day and the
[50:34] pillar of fire
[50:37] so i'm following the pillar of fire and
[50:39] listen to them but only two
[50:42] reach the promised land only two
[50:46] were true or real believers that's a
[50:47] direct quote so it means there were two
[50:49] million people by the kangaroo
[50:51] following the pillar of fire two million
[50:54] people listening to the tapes
[50:55] two million people eating the mana two
[50:58] million people
[50:59] drinking water from the smith rock
[51:01] that's not water from a stream
[51:04] that is water that was provided to the
[51:06] prophet although he did it in a
[51:07] different way but it was
[51:08] it was an exclusive bunch of people and
[51:11] yet still
[51:12] after but ibrahim said they saw the
[51:14] miracles
[51:16] only two
[51:21] only two
[51:24] i wonder how many who sit in this
[51:26] message
[51:28] around the world will be making it
[51:35] that is correct but i said because the
[51:37] word tells us the rest
[51:38] died because of unbelief in other words
[51:42] you could see miracles you could sit in
[51:44] church and still have unbelief
[51:46] you could shake one another's hands you
[51:47] could have faith and don't miss a church
[51:48] service and still have unbelief
[51:51] so that's why we come this morning to
[51:52] speak against brother punch we come
[51:54] again to push back on belief
[51:56] push back every negative thought push
[51:58] back the devil telling you you're not
[51:59] gonna make it
[52:00] push back the devil telling you you're
[52:01] wasting your time push back the devil
[52:04] telling you you better we'll give up we
[52:06] want to push back that's what the
[52:07] preaching of the world is to do
[52:09] to cut the unbelief cut the unbelief
[52:12] cut the unbelief away until lord allah
[52:14] says that word seed pulsating can the
[52:16] church say
[52:17] amen
[52:22] hallelujah so whether the man have been
[52:24] spoken with his original seed
[52:26] hallelujah hallelujah now let us stand
[52:28] like joshua caleb
[52:30] as we see the promised land coming in
[52:32] sight it's nearing that time now can the
[52:35] church say amen
[52:36] oh hallelujah hallelujah improving his
[52:40] word now i want you to notice
[52:42] he does it that way in every age he does
[52:44] it every time by the same method
[52:47] he has to take believers then in order
[52:49] to have believers to meet that word
[52:51] he's got to predestinate it to that age
[52:54] you see he's got to predestinate this
[52:56] thing to be there
[52:57] to meet the challenge of the age so but
[53:00] abraham is identifying that is a
[53:02] challenge in the age and they are
[53:04] individuals who are predestinated
[53:06] to be true believers to meet the
[53:08] challenge of the age
[53:10] you know what meeting the challenge of
[53:11] the age means it means you're not just
[53:12] backing down
[53:13] it means door we were locked on for
[53:15] months you're not gonna backslide
[53:17] and you're not gonna fall apart
[53:19] [Applause]
[53:26] you have to really check yourself you
[53:28] know i don't know if i'll say all that i
[53:30] want to say today but
[53:31] [Music]
[53:35] how god allows things to really test
[53:37] through believers
[53:39] because he will not give power to people
[53:42] who have not met his mark
[53:45] this age is too important this mission
[53:48] is too important
[53:49] all of redemption is hanging on this
[53:51] bride come on now
[53:52] dear without us cannot be made perfect
[53:55] god has not taken
[53:56] chances with this group of people if
[53:58] missing physical church for two months
[54:00] shake your faith till you do
[54:02] even how are you gonna handle when
[54:04] goliath come
[54:05] on when a real test comes
[54:10] come on now come on now
[54:16] hallelujah but ibrahim said
[54:20] did did it get you did you feel it did
[54:22] you see it do you understand
[54:24] it that's what's happening today he
[54:25] predestinated it to this by his
[54:27] foreknowledge
[54:29] when he predestined in malachi for his
[54:31] got to happen
[54:32] when he came over and predestinate
[54:34] anything that happened in his word he
[54:35] had to prove his word to be so
[54:38] when he predestinates anything to happen
[54:40] and says it will happen
[54:41] he knows that seed will be there just at
[54:44] that time
[54:45] he predestinated a bride she's gonna be
[54:48] there
[54:48] going to be a raptor she's going to be
[54:51] there he predestinated by his full
[54:53] knowledge see
[54:54] there's nothing going to stop it
[54:57] glory in the rejected king just laying a
[55:00] few quotes in here
[55:01] now listen you true believers in christ
[55:04] you true believers so he's not talking
[55:06] to everybody now
[55:07] you true believers in christ you true
[55:10] christians that believe in god and the
[55:11] supernatural
[55:14] and you'll see it friends throughout all
[55:16] the different bible studies and the
[55:18] messages
[55:19] it was just a few things that was
[55:21] missing that god has to keep dealing
[55:22] with all the time
[55:23] he said he didn't give me a whole heart
[55:26] he didn't
[55:27] fulfill all my commandments and because
[55:30] of that
[55:31] judgment because of that he allowed the
[55:34] enemy to come in
[55:35] because they did not close their ranks
[55:40] this is only kind of services people
[55:41] love to hear or preachers love to preach
[55:43] you know but the reality is you have to
[55:44] close your ranks
[55:47] you can focus on everything and you're
[55:48] leaving your window open
[55:51] and allowing the enemy in and out easy
[55:52] access into your house into your heart
[55:58] at ease in zion i'll just i'll just
[56:00] connect and just take it casual
[56:04] that's what i'm picking up in the
[56:05] spiritual realm any friends
[56:07] [Music]
[56:09] no urgency no no enthusiasm
[56:16] people just get accustomed to it
[56:20] you have to remind people to connect you
[56:22] have to remind people about your service
[56:28] but for the believers it's a test can
[56:30] you stand alone
[56:34] can you stand like just one caleb
[56:36] everybody else say we can't take it and
[56:38] you could say no i'm still a christian
[56:43] and it's not a local issue i've seen it
[56:44] all over young people who
[56:46] had a testimony every week that they
[56:50] loved jungle and
[56:51] the gods just dropped they just dropped
[56:54] because
[56:55] now the opportunity to gather and maybe
[56:57] get a charge
[56:59] the way they they used to girl charge
[57:01] and a little pick up on a sunday or so
[57:03] that's not the anymore brother joe
[57:07] and then and then you realize that they
[57:09] they were plugging into the experience
[57:11] of church and that has its place but
[57:13] god wants you to plug into him and you
[57:16] could tell if you're plugged into him
[57:19] because it vibrates over you it it moves
[57:22] you a certain way
[57:24] god is this whole year is about
[57:26] individuals now come on now
[57:28] this whole year has not been about
[57:30] churches it's been about individuals
[57:33] growing in christ have you grown are you
[57:36] growing
[57:37] is your faith higher than it was when
[57:39] this pandemic started
[57:41] oh oh oh
[57:43] [Applause]
[57:50] hallelujah i'm being pushed this morning
[57:54] hallelujah because they are individuals
[57:56] i know who have questioned trapped in
[57:58] this loop
[57:59] they connect online to work they connect
[58:02] online to this and churches has another
[58:04] connection
[58:05] oh come on now so it has become casual
[58:11] you're relaxing and taking any service
[58:22] there's no zeal there's no cry there's
[58:25] no
[58:25] burden there's no sighing and crying
[58:29] how many problems come home you'll get
[58:31] desperate now because you're recognized
[58:33] now you already need god but
[58:34] by the time you should have been
[58:35] investing in the vial of your prayers
[58:37] your vile empty
[58:38] there's no memorial stored up for you
[58:40] like cornelius had a memorial stored up
[58:43] in heaven when he brought his family
[58:45] together and he didn't even understand
[58:47] the fullness of it but he had a
[58:48] dedication he had a commitment
[58:51] he had a passion he had a burden and
[58:53] that burden
[58:54] touched god and god touched peter
[58:57] [Applause]
[58:59] [Music]
[59:02] [Applause]
[59:03] do you have a memorial where's your
[59:05] memorial
[59:07] huh
[59:10] forgive me this morning for interrupting
[59:12] your expectation of your service
[59:14] hallelujah hallelujah but i don't
[59:17] apologize this morning
[59:19] hallelujah because we want to be ready
[59:22] we want to be ready
[59:23] whether we stand alone whether they lock
[59:25] us up again you got to get stronger not
[59:27] weaker
[59:28] hallelujah you're stronger not weaker
[59:35] [Music]
[59:40] i love the way the bible puts it samson
[59:42] made his mistakes
[59:44] samson made his mistakes he lost his
[59:47] eyes
[59:48] and they put samson in quarantined
[59:50] grinding at the mill
[59:54] hallelujah but as he was grinding by the
[59:56] terrance his muscles started to get
[59:57] stronger
[59:58] i just had to grind his head and get
[1:00:00] stronger and after a while he's got to
[1:00:01] get stronger instead of his strength are
[1:00:03] they come back until they could bring
[1:00:04] him back outside again
[1:00:06] hallelujah i want to see strong
[1:00:07] christians you could tell the devil no
[1:00:10] and you can say yes lord yes what i
[1:00:12] believe i believe more than i believed
[1:00:14] yesterday
[1:00:14] i'm not i'm not gonna let the devil take
[1:00:16] my praise i'm not gonna let circumstance
[1:00:19] take my praise
[1:00:20] i'm not gonna let the economy take my
[1:00:22] praise i'm not gonna let the country
[1:00:23] take my praise
[1:00:24] i'm not gonna let what anybody else did
[1:00:26] take my praise
[1:00:31] true believers can stand if nobody else
[1:00:33] in your house stands
[1:00:34] you stand hallelujah if your husband
[1:00:37] don't understand you stand
[1:00:39] if your wife don't understand you stand
[1:00:41] if your parents don't understand
[1:00:42] you stand if your children don't
[1:00:44] understand you stand
[1:00:50] [Applause]
[1:00:54] and you'll get your reward and in your
[1:00:57] reward you could bring your family
[1:00:59] hallelujah hallelujah that's a reward
[1:01:02] that he can give you but you gotta press
[1:01:04] you gotta press you gotta press in your
[1:01:07] home
[1:01:07] you gotta make time to pray you gotta
[1:01:09] press you gotta press you gotta press
[1:01:17] people satisfied with this intellectual
[1:01:19] gospel
[1:01:20] it's information they perception like
[1:01:22] lectures no much lectures i listen to
[1:01:24] but church has to be different you can't
[1:01:27] connect to a service like if you're
[1:01:28] connecting to a
[1:01:30] lecture
[1:01:32] [Music]
[1:01:35] it's about your heart
[1:01:39] throughout scripture you see they they
[1:01:42] they get it
[1:01:43] with their head or no but it's not in
[1:01:44] their heart
[1:01:50] and god allowed it to unfold like that
[1:01:56] i want to stick it i want to take it
[1:01:59] [Music]
[1:02:01] you have to be more disciplined how dare
[1:02:04] you lie down on your bed with your phone
[1:02:05] taking in these services
[1:02:08] really when moses
[1:02:12] walk into the presidency take off your
[1:02:14] shoes
[1:02:16] for the place you're standing is holy
[1:02:17] ground don't approach me
[1:02:20] how you want to do approach me casually
[1:02:22] recognize you in the presence of god
[1:02:26] [Music]
[1:02:32] himself
[1:02:35] if the high priest went into the holies
[1:02:38] of holies
[1:02:40] and god was not pleased it was dead
[1:02:43] he couldn't stroll back out
[1:02:48] i can't believe friends that there was a
[1:02:50] high priest who casually went
[1:02:51] in think of yourself if you are high
[1:02:55] priest brother anthony
[1:02:56] and you know that if god doesn't accept
[1:02:59] it you die
[1:03:00] wouldn't you be checking people wouldn't
[1:03:02] you be going to the elders
[1:03:04] are all your people accounted for
[1:03:06] because i'm about to go into the holy's
[1:03:08] of holies
[1:03:09] once a year we get to go in we had a
[1:03:11] whole year to prepare to go in i want to
[1:03:13] make sure because i'm not going in there
[1:03:15] to die now so double check
[1:03:18] because i want to make sure my sacrifice
[1:03:20] will be accepted
[1:03:21] and you want to take church as a casual
[1:03:28] thing
[1:03:32] the principle is the same take off your
[1:03:34] shoes
[1:03:35] for the place you're standing is holy
[1:03:37] ground in other words make
[1:03:38] this service a reverend service whether
[1:03:41] you're in the building or in your house
[1:03:43] or wherever
[1:03:44] you are don't take it casually god will
[1:03:46] judge you for that
[1:03:55] that's how you separate true believers
[1:03:57] or maybe they weren't unbelievers you
[1:03:58] know
[1:04:00] it's about your approach to god it's
[1:04:02] about your reverence to god
[1:04:04] it's about your respect to god
[1:04:14] hallelujah i'm not going to be too much
[1:04:17] longer
[1:04:18] just trying to encourage you a little
[1:04:20] bit oh my
[1:04:22] but noah was a true believer we speaking
[1:04:24] about true believers this morning
[1:04:25] abraham
[1:04:26] was a true believer although they all
[1:04:28] made their mistakes
[1:04:30] they were true believers they were
[1:04:31] willing to give their all
[1:04:34] are you willing to give your all are you
[1:04:36] willing to give a hundred percent
[1:04:38] you know how hard it is to find people
[1:04:40] that give a hundred percent of anything
[1:04:42] are you really really really serious
[1:04:44] about giving a hundred percent
[1:04:46] but isaac why do i bring a mystery yeah
[1:04:47] because people are mystery given two
[1:04:52] percent
[1:04:54] job was a true believer the three hebrew
[1:04:57] words were true believers
[1:04:58] they were willing to die for what they
[1:05:00] believed are you willing to die for this
[1:05:08] that's what true believers you know you
[1:05:09] know they're coming at a time when they
[1:05:10] will shut down the churches
[1:05:13] but joe you imagine somebody come to
[1:05:15] your house and say um hear this now we
[1:05:17] we we have all the churches registered i
[1:05:19] think what church you win
[1:05:26] what do you believe because if you don't
[1:05:29] believe according to the
[1:05:30] ecumenical council and what we have is
[1:05:34] registered
[1:05:37] you know how many people are at the back
[1:05:38] battle as well you know where to be
[1:05:41] honest
[1:05:42] i used to like believe you know but it's
[1:05:44] not like it was like a
[1:05:47] it was like a real like firm film
[1:05:50] there were some good things in there but
[1:05:52] it's not like
[1:05:55] you know we did any bible study from
[1:05:56] proverbs the
[1:05:58] simple
[1:06:01] the simple wherever where when you push
[1:06:03] them too hard you give it back what you
[1:06:04] need to hear you know
[1:06:07] you tell them this thing wrong you say
[1:06:08] yeah boy you know you're right i didn't
[1:06:09] really know it had two wrong things in
[1:06:10] here you know
[1:06:12] and even those who say this thing is the
[1:06:14] truth is nothing but the truth
[1:06:20] it comes down friends having a
[1:06:21] revelation
[1:06:23] and i've realized that most people ready
[1:06:25] to have a revelation
[1:06:27] reading three books of the message 10
[1:06:30] books 100 books
[1:06:31] 500 books and coming up with the
[1:06:33] intellectual conception of the message
[1:06:35] it's not a revelation of the message
[1:06:38] because the revelation is what they get
[1:06:40] out of the messages about the life
[1:06:44] that is your revelation you know do
[1:06:47] revelation is in life
[1:06:49] because that's what god fought for to
[1:06:50] get in life
[1:06:52] the life to say that's my spirit flowing
[1:06:53] freely do i have all knowledge and i
[1:06:56] have all the mysteries and i give my way
[1:06:57] to be born and i don't have this
[1:06:59] life i don't have charity i don't have
[1:07:01] love
[1:07:02] everything else it don't matter it has
[1:07:05] to come back to your life
[1:07:06] it has to come back to living living for
[1:07:09] god
[1:07:11] and not you saying i'm with the message
[1:07:13] but god's saying i
[1:07:14] am identified with you there's my
[1:07:17] beloved son my beloved son
[1:07:18] there's my daughter over there there's
[1:07:20] my son there she's working there she's
[1:07:22] working there but
[1:07:23] no you can't move her like god can speak
[1:07:25] about job
[1:07:29] god was so pleased with job he
[1:07:31] interrupted the devil walking around
[1:07:33] and said satan what are you doing walk
[1:07:36] around two and throw
[1:07:37] cause him back now he say have you
[1:07:38] considered job
[1:07:40] i see you're walking around but you're
[1:07:41] not doing my job at all have you
[1:07:43] considered job
[1:07:44] you're passing a wrong job house you're
[1:07:45] going to the leftover job you're not
[1:07:46] going to have you consider job you say
[1:07:48] well i
[1:07:48] consider job you know because you have a
[1:07:50] hedge around him
[1:07:53] so i know better than to pass by him i
[1:07:56] wouldn't go anywhere i see your
[1:07:57] protection like that
[1:08:00] you know that's how god feels about you
[1:08:03] he puts a hedge around you
[1:08:04] put the protection around you the devil
[1:08:07] had to get permission to come by you
[1:08:08] you didn't did the the devil just come
[1:08:10] into your house just so it can't work so
[1:08:12] you know you need permission to the
[1:08:13] devil show up in your neighborhood
[1:08:14] it means god already approves you to
[1:08:16] push him back
[1:08:18] it's whether or not you will take the
[1:08:19] challenge and say satan you got to go
[1:08:23] that's how you build your strength that
[1:08:25] but ibrahim taught us this he said when
[1:08:26] you say pull back
[1:08:27] you get stronger you never get weaker
[1:08:29] but what god is doing it's exercise it's
[1:08:31] exercise it's exercise
[1:08:33] your feet muscles exercise your
[1:08:35] revelation exercise
[1:08:37] your faith in god hallelujah so
[1:08:40] you have a little situation to pray and
[1:08:41] you see god work for you now your faith
[1:08:43] grows
[1:08:44] now you're willing to pray for something
[1:08:45] bigger you want to ask god for bigger
[1:08:47] things that's why brother branham could
[1:08:48] say how could you have faith for the
[1:08:50] rapture
[1:08:51] if your car fit for divine healing it
[1:08:53] means you must have faith for divine
[1:08:54] healing
[1:08:55] or you can't talk rapture
[1:08:59] so we have to see divine healing break
[1:09:00] out hallelujah
[1:09:03] and we have seen signs and signs and
[1:09:05] signs but god said
[1:09:06] missing limbs would be restored if god
[1:09:09] could take us to the rapture he could
[1:09:11] restore missing limb
[1:09:12] hallelujah you have to believe it
[1:09:15] hallelujah you got to accept it
[1:09:18] oh hallelujah i'm not going to be too
[1:09:21] much longer with you
[1:09:23] oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[1:09:26] hallelujah
[1:09:27] oh hallelujah hallelujah blessed be the
[1:09:30] name of the lord
[1:09:37] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:09:42] from the message thy seed but imam said
[1:09:45] that's the reason we find our
[1:09:46] organization's feeling by the wayside
[1:09:49] it's because when it comes to the to the
[1:09:51] test what tests god's word
[1:09:53] there's a test and it's simple you know
[1:09:59] god's word is the test
[1:10:02] will we do what a bunch of men says do
[1:10:04] or will we do what god says do that's
[1:10:06] the difference
[1:10:10] who hallelujah
[1:10:13] but ibraheem goes on in events made
[1:10:15] clear by prophecy he said but the bible
[1:10:17] is a living foretold witness of jesus
[1:10:19] christ
[1:10:20] and as the earth has grown into its
[1:10:22] fullness and also
[1:10:23] vines grow into their fullness the day
[1:10:26] grows into its fullness
[1:10:28] the bible was manifested in its fullness
[1:10:30] in the person of jesus christ
[1:10:32] he was the word of god revealed the
[1:10:34] whole complete book of redemption
[1:10:36] the bible is god's word for telling the
[1:10:40] future events
[1:10:41] its believers is commanded by its order
[1:10:44] to read and believe every word of it not
[1:10:46] just part of it
[1:10:48] one word to believe it you might as well
[1:10:50] quit trying
[1:10:51] until you believe that word you see what
[1:10:52] i want to know along here
[1:10:55] every word is absolutely a part of
[1:10:57] almighty god
[1:10:58] god made a manifest wound into his word
[1:11:02] to show forth who he is we are commanded
[1:11:05] as believers
[1:11:06] to believe every word of it and it's
[1:11:09] wrote by the order of god himself
[1:11:11] there's nobody can add anything to it or
[1:11:14] take anything from it
[1:11:16] oh my he said if you would it would make
[1:11:18] a freak body of god
[1:11:19] it would have maybe six fingers on one
[1:11:21] hand or three arms or something to add
[1:11:23] something
[1:11:24] to take something away from it and be
[1:11:26] one short arm one short
[1:11:28] it's the complete body of jesus christ
[1:11:31] hallelujah and the true believers in
[1:11:34] this world
[1:11:34] who accept it that we believe it and
[1:11:37] with patience
[1:11:39] wait for its prophesied promises
[1:11:42] every one of them to be manifested in
[1:11:44] its age
[1:11:45] hallelujah oh blessed be the name
[1:11:48] of the lord oh blessed be the name of
[1:11:51] the lord
[1:11:52] oh but abandonment is bernie and church
[1:11:54] age it doesn't matter
[1:11:56] if you call yourself a christian anyone
[1:11:58] can do that
[1:11:59] the point is whether or not you have the
[1:12:01] spirit of god in you
[1:12:03] for without that spirit you are
[1:12:04] reprobate can i say it one more time
[1:12:06] it doesn't matter if you call yourself a
[1:12:08] christian anyone can do that
[1:12:11] the point is whether or not you have the
[1:12:13] spirit of god in you
[1:12:14] for without that spirit you are
[1:12:16] reprobate in other words you're a rascal
[1:12:18] you're no good you're a troublemaker you
[1:12:21] are none of his
[1:12:22] hallelujah oh hallelujah i'm getting
[1:12:24] ready to wind down
[1:12:26] in the same message money on church age
[1:12:28] but abandon said not too long ago
[1:12:30] i asked a lady if she were a christian
[1:12:33] she said to me and
[1:12:34] you you know this quote i will have you
[1:12:36] nurse no sir that i burn a candle every
[1:12:38] night
[1:12:39] what in the world has that got to do
[1:12:41] with it i'm a methodist
[1:12:42] i'm a baptist i'm a pentecostal that has
[1:12:44] got nothing to do with it
[1:12:46] it's the holy ghost or perish hallelujah
[1:12:49] and that's what i want to nail down this
[1:12:51] morning
[1:12:51] it's the holy ghost or perish hallelujah
[1:12:54] i want every reward
[1:12:56] i want every promise i want every
[1:12:58] promise in the book and the church say
[1:13:00] amen
[1:13:01] oh hallelujah hallelujah oh my
[1:13:04] let me be into wine now well starting
[1:13:07] way back there in the first church
[1:13:10] the people got to thinking and reasoning
[1:13:12] how to improve on god
[1:13:14] you imagine the deeds of the nicolaitans
[1:13:17] began showing themselves
[1:13:19] then a group formed they drifted away
[1:13:21] from the pattern of the word to the word
[1:13:23] as a pattern
[1:13:24] and if you cut to the pattern then your
[1:13:26] life's supposed to have that same
[1:13:27] pattern
[1:13:28] you can't be cut from the part in your
[1:13:30] life not lining up with that pattern
[1:13:32] hallelujah all it takes is just one word
[1:13:35] change
[1:13:36] and that little eleven then levels the
[1:13:37] whole lump he that offends in one point
[1:13:40] of the law is guilty of all
[1:13:42] eve just changed one word and when that
[1:13:45] listen to the prophet
[1:13:46] satan centered group was formed it began
[1:13:49] to hate
[1:13:50] and to fight the true believers
[1:13:52] insisting that they were aliens of the
[1:13:54] church
[1:13:55] notice how organization breathes hatred
[1:13:58] it destroys
[1:13:59] fellowship it makes bitterness that is
[1:14:01] what myrrh
[1:14:02] means this is what smyrna was full of
[1:14:04] bitterness a root of bitterness defiles
[1:14:07] many
[1:14:07] so more and more definement was coming
[1:14:10] every age would feel its scars
[1:14:13] that's money and church age had drifted
[1:14:15] far
[1:14:16] from the original it had become a hybrid
[1:14:19] it had hybridized itself the way eve did
[1:14:22] you know what a hybrid is it comes of
[1:14:24] two
[1:14:25] species mixing the result is no longer
[1:14:28] pure like the original
[1:14:31] that's why i'm preaching so hard against
[1:14:33] mixing with the things of the world
[1:14:34] and mixing with all your ideas and
[1:14:36] mixing with your own interpretation
[1:14:38] it's the word or nothing well when eve
[1:14:41] allowed the beast to mingle his seed
[1:14:43] with hers
[1:14:44] she produced a creature called king that
[1:14:46] wasn't pure human
[1:14:48] he was of the wicked one notice how
[1:14:50] different he was from abel
[1:14:51] notice how different he was from set he
[1:14:53] hated god and would not
[1:14:55] obey the word and persecuted and killed
[1:14:58] the righteous
[1:14:59] he set himself up above the word of god
[1:15:02] and but abraham goes on the church too
[1:15:04] has departed from what she originally
[1:15:07] was
[1:15:07] she is a hybrid that is the church
[1:15:10] nominal is a hybrid
[1:15:11] people say i'm a baptist and now they
[1:15:14] say i'm in the message
[1:15:15] it wasn't so in the beginning instead of
[1:15:18] the straight
[1:15:19] word of god instead of spirit-filled men
[1:15:21] in the church
[1:15:22] who were led by spirit given revelation
[1:15:25] they are now creeds and bylaws
[1:15:27] and the educated guesses of educated men
[1:15:33] and you see it all over learning has
[1:15:35] taken the place of revelation
[1:15:38] reason has replaced faith programs
[1:15:41] have replaced spontaneous praise in the
[1:15:44] holy ghost
[1:15:46] [Music]
[1:15:48] you know what brother obama said there's
[1:15:49] no substitute for this holy ghost
[1:15:51] you can't put a program in place to do
[1:15:53] it hallelujah you could have youth
[1:15:55] services and this and that
[1:15:56] your young people need to meet the
[1:15:58] pillar of fire
[1:16:01] it is not to educate them they need to
[1:16:02] meet god just like moses bent a pillar
[1:16:05] of fire
[1:16:06] and from that five minutes in the
[1:16:08] presence of god
[1:16:09] it changes walk it changes talk it
[1:16:11] changes life the musician can get ready
[1:16:15] oh hallelujah and when the church
[1:16:17] becomes hybridized
[1:16:19] will it produce pure christians it can't
[1:16:21] the life or seed
[1:16:23] that brings christians to birth is not
[1:16:25] in them
[1:16:26] like brings forth like the baptists
[1:16:28] bring forth more baptists
[1:16:30] and they act like baptist methodists
[1:16:32] bring forth pep
[1:16:33] methodists and they act like methodists
[1:16:35] not one is known
[1:16:36] by the power of god nor can they be for
[1:16:39] it's not there
[1:16:40] they are known by their ceremonial
[1:16:42] worship and their creeds and dogmas
[1:16:44] message will bring forth message but the
[1:16:47] original word
[1:16:48] the original seed the original gospel
[1:16:51] will bring forth true believers with the
[1:16:53] original power
[1:16:54] oh hallelujah the original word the
[1:16:57] original seed
[1:16:58] will produce your original life and only
[1:17:00] the true believers
[1:17:01] will receive the original seed and were
[1:17:04] germinated by having true worship
[1:17:06] to see that light come to manifestation
[1:17:09] oh
[1:17:09] hallelujah i'm almost finished
[1:17:12] [Music]
[1:17:14] oh glory glory glory glory glory
[1:17:17] oh my my my did you get it now in the
[1:17:20] ephesian churches
[1:17:21] they are those twins again they are
[1:17:23] those two trees again
[1:17:25] growing side by side in the same earth
[1:17:28] partaking of the same nourishment
[1:17:32] this nourishment of this message
[1:17:34] drinking in the same rain
[1:17:36] benefited by the same sun but they come
[1:17:38] from different seeds
[1:17:40] oh one tree is for the word of god
[1:17:42] exactly as god gave it
[1:17:44] that's a tree oh my that's what i'm
[1:17:46] talking about this morning
[1:17:48] one tree is for the word of god exactly
[1:17:50] as god gave it
[1:17:52] and loves and obeys it the other tree is
[1:17:54] from the seed
[1:17:55] that is untied the word of god and
[1:17:58] changes it where it wants to
[1:18:01] hallelujah you like this part of the
[1:18:03] world but but you don't believe this so
[1:18:05] and you don't want to do this so and and
[1:18:07] you're still messing around with the
[1:18:08] world and this way you're taking
[1:18:09] somebody
[1:18:10] that's a different seed it substitutes
[1:18:13] its own creeds and donbas
[1:18:15] for the living true word exactly as dead
[1:18:18] cain
[1:18:18] who ended up killing abel hallelujah
[1:18:22] oh my but fearing a little flock stay
[1:18:25] with the word
[1:18:26] keep that word between you and the devil
[1:18:28] oh that's the message this morning
[1:18:30] keep that word between you and the devil
[1:18:33] that's the attribute of the true
[1:18:34] believers
[1:18:35] eve did not do that and she failed and
[1:18:38] when the church
[1:18:39] lets down on the wood she goes into the
[1:18:41] depths of darkness
[1:18:42] oh my i'm finished this morning oh are
[1:18:46] you looking for your rewards
