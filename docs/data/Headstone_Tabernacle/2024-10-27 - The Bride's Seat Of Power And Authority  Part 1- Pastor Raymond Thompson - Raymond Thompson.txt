Heavenly places far above all principalities and power and might and Dominion every name that is named not only in this world but also in which is to come amen and had put all things under his feet Yes and gave him to be the head over all things that's the church which is his body the fullness of him that fth all in all wow isn't that beautiful wow and then Ephesians 2 right there 4 to8 but God

he loved us amen even when we were dead in sin yes ha quickened us together with Christ by grace are you saved amen and it raised us up together and made us to sit where in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus so you must see the scriptures we read now so we we showed here he's raised up and he in Heavenly places in verse one right it says here verse 20 verse one which he wrought in Christ when he raised him from the dead and set him on the right hand in the in the way Heavenly places amen yeah he says he's raised up it says and has raised us up amen together and made us sit together Amen in Heavenly places in CHR Jesus so there has a big difference it's not only Christ SE there but now who's there with him oh my and he's the head of the church so brother you're going to find out where are you actually sitting he says here that in the ages to come he might show his exceeding Riches of his grace in in his kindness towards us through Christ Jesus for by grace are saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is a gift of God my what a beautiful scriptures yeah and then 1 John 3 [Music] amen okay First John 3 he says here behold what men of love from verse one behold what men of love the father has bestowed upon on us that we should be called the sons of God therefore the world knoweth us not because he knew him not amen beloved now are we the sons of God Amen and it doth not yet appear what we shall be Hallelujah but we know that when he shall appear amen we shall be like him amen for we shall see him as he is Hu and every man that had this hope in him purifieth himself s even as he is pure may the Lord add a blessing to the ringing of his word you may be seated amen thanks so isn't those scriptures beautiful amen wow so it's it's such such amazing that uh and I trust the Lord I but by the grace of God that as the Holy Spirit revealed it that I can the Holy Spirit can reveal it to you not me no man can give a revelation but may you see this morning your position in Christ AMU so he says here uh Israel and the church amen blessed be the God and father of our Lord oh let me just give my title I didn't give no title there so my title this morning the bright seat of power and authority wow the bright seat of power and authority my subject is seated together in Heavenly places and my uh inspiration now are we the sons of God not tomorrow not in the Millennium now we are the sons of God he says now in this message Israel and the church blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus so he starts with Ephesians there he says oh my see who this who he's addressing this to not to a bunch your babies no so to start with the scripture is not to babies amen he says here he's addressing this not to babies to people that is in Heavenly places so when it comes to Ephesians it's Heavenly places it's not babies amen and uh you know something you've been taught and you're saved and I want to tell you you what what it's all about oh I like that don't you I want to put your feet up in heaven a little while Hallelujah so you see we too Earthbound so he says no I want to take your feet off the ground here because you're too Earthbound you're too worried about the things that's going on around you so I want to take you this morning and put your feet in heaven oh why so you're going to find out that you're not just sitting here you you think you sitting here but you are seated in Heavenly places and you're going to find not to be because we are a two-fold bean this Bean is here but there's another Bean they're sitting in Heavenly places brother and that that that being the enemy can't touch this one he can eat with sickness and disease and all kinds of things but there's another body they're seated in Heavenly places Hallelujah I don't want to get too anointed before my time instead of being so Earthbound said I want to tell you why I want to give you a little boost how many needs a little boost this morning well the prophet says I want to give you a little boost Hallelujah he says a little boost a little Revival a little stimulation he says amen I like stimulation kind of builds you up especially when you know where you can say thus sayth the Lord so we have to get a boo brother a Revival just to bring you up a bit and we have thus say the Lord on it so we're not guessing this morning am now I want to speak to you he said so that Hallelujah you you that sit in Heavenly places in Christ been blessed together with spiritual blessings the gifts of God manifesting Divine Healing prophecies everything going forth now you grown up people I want to talk to you so now this not to babies Hallelujah not to people that you must still pet on the back and still uh give diapers and give baby bottles no this is to mature people they they know they standing in Christ they know who they are they know they come from God they know they're going back to God they're not babies man hallelujah it's too late to be a baby hallu yes he says so I'm dring this to you now watch according to amen now yeah it is a hope really I'm going to to let it soak right real good cuz it will do good it might be go Plum into the bones hallelujah oh brother sisters so I trust it will will go right into the bones this morning now the Bible says that uh let me just get it quickly just to there's so much scriptures on that I had to almost choose like which uh ones to use which ones to leave but Matthew 28 now remember Christ was risen and he went to the mountain and he spoke to disciples and just before he left watch what he said then when this uh and the 11 disciples this is Matthew 28 16 amen he says and the 11 disciples went away into Galilee into a mountain where Jesus had appointed them and when he saw him they worshiped him but some doubted and Jesus came and spake and said unto them saying all power is given unto me in heaven and earth now this man is rising he's Arisen from the dead he's going now he's ascending but he tell them listen you Hallelujah I'm going but all power has been given to me where in heaven and on earth now if we SE it with him in Heavenly places then what power does the body of Christ possess now you must answer the question you must see yourself in it young people you need to see yourself in this you can't see your mother or your father or the deacons you must see I'm part of that body so where are you seated not on the seat here brother but we seated to that brother Daniel in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus so we have to be in Christ and when you in Christ then you in Heavenly places brother Raymond how do I get into Christ Hallelujah First Corinthians my my my so we're just nailing it down so that you can see what we saying here is not uh from he says here 1 Corinthians 12 133 for by one spirit we are all baptized into one body whether we be jew or Gentile whether we Bond or free and have been all made to drink into one spirit so how do I get into Christ by one Spirit brother not by one church not by one membership not by one group but by one Spirit we are baptized into the body of Christ and become one with him not United with him we become one with Hallelujah so when you speak of a man and his wife they become one Hallelujah so Christ and his bride is one Hallelujah so where are they seated today Hallelujah come on brother you're going to see your position you're not J on the earth man these things are going to perish and we focus too much on it but God is calling you up he told John come up John come up higher I want to speak to you John Hallelujah but as long as you yeah I can't reveal it to you you must come away from the family come away from your friends come away from the world and when he came up higher then he showed him what's going to happen my my my my so the Bible says now Christ is seated at the right hand of the father amen now brother says here in Hebrews chapter 1 what does the right hand mean he says now God has got the right hand that's that somebody is setting on on on it right hand means the power and authority amen it says God the authority of everything in Heaven and Earth and all heavens and earth is made by him amen then he says in expectation now watch as we go along you must listen to the quotes positionally they don't know what they are yes and that's what I'm trying to emphasize we know who God is we know who the enem is but there's a lack we don't know who we are we come when we drag our feet the enemy trips up around every corner but when you know who you are brother then you will become you become a Force you become a challenge he's afraid of you you afraid of him but you you'll be shocked to think how afraid the enemies of you every time he sees you because he knows you seated with Christ where in Heavenly Places come on brother and sister Hallelujah positionally they don't know what they are you Sons and Daughters of God and a lot of times you're looking for something great to come but you already got that the greatest can be given to you now we are the sons of God not we will be and we are now and we seated together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus right now oh my what faith he says that that gets in the church he says if that gets in the church the devil moves away from that place come on now man a come on you better get a revelation to know who you are he says and if the church gets that Revelation he says the Devils run out brother they move out why the church has got a revelation of who she is brother hallelujah [Applause] hallelujah hallah you want to get Devils move out well just know who you are in Christ now now I'm a Son of God now I'm a daughter of God I'm not going to be Hallelujah I walked in your son and I'm going out a son I came in your daughter and I'm going out a daughter I don't care what happened last night I don't care I care what happened in the week but I'm a Son of God Satan might have made you fall he might have made you make mistakes but you still a Son of God your predes ination overrides your faults you are predestinated to be in the body of Christ Hallelujah and brother once you in Heavenly places no one can pull you down the enemy will try everything but he cannot get you [Applause] [Music] down my he said the devil moves away from the place if we in Christ uh he says yeah what think you of Christ right this very minute we seated together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus every man by one spirit and we read it are all baptized into one body become members of the body by the Holy Spirit baptism Hallelujah now we seated together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus watch you know free from judgment and this is what the devil preached to us every time we make a mistake then we say it's because God is judging me right doesn't he preach that to you every time something goes wrong hey the Lord is punishing me but you're going to be surprised brother someone took your judgment we read the scripture what happened at Calvary why did he have to go to Calvary then he took your judgment your sin he took it upon him he become a sinner so that we can become righteousness of God hallelujah now here was the process in Christ Jesus free from judgment listen we can never go to the Judgment how can you be judged twice are you ready God judged Jesus Christ and he put our judgment upon Christ Christ paid for our Judgment at Calvary and if we in Christ we secured in Christ how do we get into Christ by one Holy Ghost baptism so how can God judge you again bras he judged Christ Christ took the penalty of our sin he became a sinner brother he he became a the the the you remember the the the serpent praison serpent that took the Judgment that's what he became and he took your my judgment so we judged Christ instead of judging you and Christ took our punishment amen now we in Christ amen how can he judge you again Brother come on man let's give the hand of Praise hallelujah how can he judge you again Hallelujah and you see the enemy doesn't like that type of preaching because as long as he he can keep condemnation over you he know he's got you you're going to walk miserable you're going to walk with no Victory but brother want you know you're free and you know there's there's nothing hanging here because of Calvary not of my Works nothing you did nothing you do can save you not your good works can save you not your bad Works will keep out you are saved by the grace of almighty God hallelujah hallelujah God bless you Sister L good to see you listen man not not any good works Hallelujah I feel how how did the say he feels twice his size and what hise and half his age okay so God judg Jesus Christ and put our judgment upon Christ Christ paid our Judgment at Calvary if you in Christ you're secured in Christ how do we get into Christ by one baptism Hallelujah he says we're in that body of Jesus Christ and while we're in there we've accepted his punishment in our stad that's what you accepted so when you accept Christ you accept his punishment what happened on Calvary he knowing no sin yet was made sin for us and he bore our sickness yes sir excuse me he bore our sins and we come into him we are free from the the these judgments God cannot justly judge me or you the second timeall if he already if he's already accepted us in Christ Jesus and punish his own son for us how can he punish us then again Hallelujah when he's already had Christ paid our price hey brother how can you not shout how can you not be happy when Christ paid our price we had to be judged we had to go to hell we had to be condemned brother but Christ say I die for them I die for brother Malcolm i d for Timothy I'm dying for whoever whatever he is he died for you Brother come on man show the devil on whose side you are if he died for me then I'm on God's side Hallelujah you might have made me fall but I'm getting up you might have tripped me but I'm getting up out [Applause] hallelujah [Applause] hallu hallelujah so Christ play the price he says here in witness if you know positionally now this is what I'm trying to get to the church and you know all these message I preach if you know positionally who you are and what you are tonight there wouldn't be a fable person in here in the next 5 minutes if you know who you are positionally I'm not speaking about your job and your career and what you are I'm not speaking of that I'm speaking about spiritual things now if you know your who you are positionally in Christ he says there won't be one feeble person here in 5 minutes so what we a lack is to know who we are and that's why we live under our privileges but when we can come above and live where our privileges is brother then no demon no devil will be able to stand against the Church of God she becomes an invincible Army hallelujah hallelujah praise God that's right the thing of it is you're looking off for something in the Millennium something to happen when it's already here now we are the sons of God not we will be or it says we are right now Hallelujah this night now this minute we seated together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus now if you only recognize that the supreme authority that's why I took the title the bright seat of power and authority you mean brother I have authority I have power brother Malcolm this is so powerful they say brother a King when he signs any uh any decree or anything Hallelujah he says he must be sitting on the throne Hallelujah Remember When when when when Esther walked in there Hallelujah that was death but because he was on the throne he pointed the scepter to her and she found Grace brother I want to tell you man our King we are sitting with him on the throne brother we have the same Authority that he has above the principalities above the powers in the air and on the earth we are have the supreme authority a seat of power a seat of authority [Applause] my my my my my brother you're going to go out of here a different man a different young man if you take this Revelation if you take it in your heart and you say God I realize who I am and he says the problem is we just need to find out who we are Hallelujah and that's what the enemy keeps away from us but may he be defeated this morning amen SE together in heav Christ Jesus if you only Rec that the supreme authority that Jesus Christ has given to every believer hallelujah hallelujah anything you have desire of or need of only thing you have to do is ask and receive it whatsoever things you desire When you pray believe you you receive it and it will be given you say mark 11:24 and that's through whoever whatsoever things you desire When you pray believe that you will receive it and you will have it now he says notice you can't make yourself anything different from what God intended you to be now now here something powerful now many times you say I wish I was like brother son no you can never be like brother so and so and brother so and so can never be like you what God made you to be and you stay there you're going to be a blessing man Hallelujah be what God made you to be we always looking at someone else and looking at that one no look at yourself what God Made You he made you a witness he made you a son he made you a daughter what more do I want brother as long as I know I'm a son and daughter of God and I have power ever over every demon whether it be in heaven or whether it be on earth I can walk over that Hallelujah so be what God made you to be Hallelujah I'm going to say we all can't be pastors there must only be one Pastor yeah you can't have six heads in a in a group brother no there's something wrong H he says so you can only be what God God intended you to be anything else is an impersonation Hallelujah therefore if your conversion is only because you're trying to hide because something and trying to make yourself better person you're only playing the part of a hypocrite until Christ has actually come to your life change you brought you into an atmosphere now remember that again Watch the word atmosphere okay that's the difference that's the difference of it amen that's the reason we go uh through so many different forms yes and saying they they have to do this Jesus said he that Hearth my word and believeth on him that sent me has everlasting life you don't have to first do that you don't have to first as long as you believe on the Lord Jesus Christ Hallelujah you have everlasting life Hallelujah and he that believeth must be baptized you can't say no I do believe he says he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved hallah now no no make belief it's absolutely something that's happened a conversion of the heart that's changed you and brought you into another realm so it's atmosphere now it's another realm it's Heavenly places it's you see what I say it's different things it's different dimensions hallelujah amen and you'll be surprised where are you dwelling amen hallelujah my you mean brother Raymond I'm transcending different dimensions one minute I'm right here on the earth I'm speaking to the boss next minute I'm right here in Heavenly places Hallelujah speaking to God I'm with God on the throne I'm right here praying on my my knees next minute I'm in Heavenly places I'm driving my car and they hear me singing but I'm in Heavenly places I'm doing the washing brother and they think I'm washing here but no I'm in Heavenly places I'm speaking to the father he Allah come on brother sister man you're not the Earthbound creature god Set you in Heavenly places you said brother Raymond my trials he knows about the trials he knows what you're going through but that's only part to form your character it's only part to mold you to make you like him he makes the boss swear and curse you and then he watch what are you going to do and you just stand and say bless him Lord forgive him Lord help him Lord deliver him Lord he's he's a he's a man just like me but he needs you Lord hallelujah hallelujah he makes your neighbor turn against you he make people in the church turn against you but brother besides that we in Heavenly [Applause] places my now he says a Christian woman uh he says it happens he changed you and brought you into another realm he says men are misunderstood Christian woman men and boys girls are misunderstood who lived in those places because it's to the Natural run of life among the people of the world and I'm sure we all want to live in that atmosphere how many want to live in that atmosphere so you see it comes to every son and daughter of God now you young girls on the school will say but how they tease you for your long dresses but they don't realize you're living in another atmosphere you're on school there because it's it's it's just it's it's compulsory amen and you have to go to school amen but you see you don't really come from here amen you come from another planet another atmosphere another world that's why the Bible says our desires is from above that's why we don't desire the things here it's going to pass away they murder they steal they kill and do everything and tomorrow that's all gone but this that you have BR money can't buy it they can buy Heavenly places how can you buy Heavenly places God put you there brother and no enemy can pull you down hallelujah hallelujah my because it's contrary to the Natural run of life among people of the world and I'm sure we all want to live in that atmosphere he says the supernatural there's many people today that doesn't know that Jesus Christ is still alive they don't know he still rules and Reigns amen they don't know that the blood of Calvary for the whole is all sufficient that even purchased there at the cross for your transgressions and for your healings they don't know that the that that's real today we need some more Little Maids now he's speaking of the maid that told uh nonon listen there's a prophet in Israel Hallelujah she says and just go to him and he will tell you how to get rid of the leprosy Hallelujah yeah you see what he said she said we just we just little we need some more Little Maids to go around and testify things BR don't you think so get in the atmosphere of it so you see you got to get in the atmosphere when you come to church you don't just sit here and think what am I going to do after church what I must go see that one I must for get to phone this one brother then you just occupying a seat but when you come in here and you he in the atmosphere of the Holy Spirit then God can speak to you then the Holy Spirit can move upon you seal you with the baptism of the Holy Spirit why you drawing on the holy spirit amen sister come on now man there's something that's for you and then God anoints me and you pull on the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost goes after you why you in an atmosphere that's why it's important to come up in the spirit cat the [Applause] Hall wow he says think of it get in the atmosphere of it it's not he said it's not afraid what the world says because while they talking with the world they still in another atmosphere so while we're mixing in the world we're still in another atmosphere I was reading one not one case I heard Bly Paul testify he says brother Ben was in a restaurant and the playing music in it was so loud and heavy now one one place you want to go stop there this time he just went on eating and Billy Paul says Dad isn't this music interfering with you he says what music I don't even hear it I'm living in another atmosphere come on brothers and sister that's where we got to live it doesn't matter what the neighbor is doing how loud he playing his music you're not interested in that brother even when you climb in this taes and the thing is blaring you in another atmosphere and when you mix with your friends at school you in another atmosphere Hallelujah my how you like that he said man what music I didn't even hear it he was in another atmosphere so you can live right amongst them but you're in another atmosphere pral on the job they fighting they sing Everything you in another atmosphere Hallelujah H Amen brother mil amen young girls come on man let's give the Lord a hand of Praise come on you sisters I want to see you amen you must be an example for the young people come on [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Hallelujah my you know if God answered your prayer you have a reason to shout you put the request in then God answer it then then you have a right to shout right amen amen sister Maria look at there God healed her she fell she broke almost her bones there she on her feet old lady 69 years old she's worshiping God she put the younger people to shame man come on let's worship God and when you worship God he comes nearer because God dwells in the Praises of his people amen we don't praise the minister we don't praise any no we this is good this is our [Applause] worship hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah I feel a shout in the house man hallelujah praise God I'm Not Afraid what the world says because while they talking with the world we're still in another atmosphere you're talking to the sinner but you're not in his atmosphere now he's telling you of his drugs and he's telling you of his OCA pipe but you telling him of a Jesus that can change your life and can make you brand new and can deliver you so while he's talking his worldly things you talking your heavenly things you see brothers so we live right amongst it but one is in one atmosphere and the other one is in other atmosphere so which one do you want to dwell in Hallelujah come on brother sister man this atmosphere produces something brother you know the right atmosphere produces something when you praying for your children then create an atmosphere then when I come in here I don't s still I want my children saved so I create an atmosphere you know what brother man says we little Gods he said he came home one day and his wife was upset the phone the children the sick people she says B I can't take it anymore and he said he prayed inside said Lord give me wisdom Hallelujah and he says put his hand on his shoulder and he says honey you know what amen how much I love you man he says and you know what I seen such a beautiful dress he says you know what I was doing in meantime I was saying Lord change the atmosphere change the atmosphere change the atmosphere he says and before you know she forgot about the children she forgot about the sick people she forgot she says is that so B Hallelujah you a Creator man in your home you can create the atmosphere you can change your wife from an argument to a blessing and a place Meen [Applause] Hallelujah so it depends which atmosphere you're dwelling in and you're in such a glorious shrouded in the Shak now I thought when look where he's taking it this at this heavenly places he takes it right to the shakina glory so you have the outer Court you have the inner court but once you get into the holy of holies the sh the glory brother then you in Heavenly places and says the curtain drops behind you and the whole world is shut off and it's only you in the pill of fire Hallelujah in the S Glory he says there in the outer Court the he says the lights go out he says in the inner Court the lamps the candlesticks they go out you said but in the shakina glory it's forever light brother so it doesn't care there's no blue Mondays there's no gloomy Tuesdays there's no said Wednesdays there's no upset Thursdays there's no Fridays down there's no Saturdays where you're not in a good mood no every day is a good day with Jesus you why you in Heavenly places hallelujah hallelujah my in the of Glory all around you the veils of the world is heat you can talk to the world worldly human or the worldly man whatever it is and still live in that shakina now how can it be that we live among Sinners and people but yet you in the Shak yesah so brother there's two atmospheres on this Earth only two forces amen so you either rule by the force of the world or you rule by the power of God Amen and the forces of the world if you don't give heat is going to pull you amen hallelujah amen so you got to get didn't Shake
