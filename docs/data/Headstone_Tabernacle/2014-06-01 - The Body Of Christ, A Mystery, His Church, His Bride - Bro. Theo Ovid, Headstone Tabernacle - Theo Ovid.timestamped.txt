[15:54] then jesus and we ask it
[15:56] amen you may be seated
[16:00] hallelujah
[16:02] we want to uh welcome yvonne and all
[16:06] right
[16:06] god bless you welcome head son
[16:08] tabernacle invited by our brother
[16:10] michael williams
[16:11] we say welcome
[16:13] to the headstone tabernacle
[16:15] well it's good to be here
[16:20] about three weeks
[16:22] a long time i think this is the longest
[16:24] i've been away from the church
[16:26] into cameroon and then
[16:28] uh
[16:29] i wasn't there for the last service
[16:30] because i slip out to go to pennsylvania
[16:32] and what a what a time i really want to
[16:35] thank the brethren
[16:36] who invited me the burden from indiana
[16:39] pennsylvania new york
[16:41] i have some meetings in pier
[16:43] uh last weekend there was really
[16:46] some that was inspired of the lord
[16:48] and to me just supernatural
[16:50] and what was powerful to me is what
[16:52] unfolded after the meetings
[16:55] that they don't know yet
[16:57] but they'll know today
[17:00] because the lord really dealt with me
[17:02] and uh
[17:03] give me something to share that is very
[17:04] important
[17:05] both for the morning service and the
[17:07] evening service so after the second
[17:09] service there'll be no communion we have
[17:10] the evening service three o'clock but
[17:12] there'll be no communion
[17:13] but i preached this morning and this
[17:15] evening also
[17:16] both services are very very important
[17:19] i believe uh
[17:21] is kind of mind-blowing when i saw what
[17:23] i saw
[17:25] um
[17:27] cameroon was mind-blowing and a
[17:29] tremendous blessing
[17:31] thank you for your prayer
[17:35] one particular message that stood out
[17:37] for me was
[17:39] a preacher about loose ends and abram
[17:41] came to tie up all the loose ends it was
[17:43] really
[17:44] really powerful like no certain message
[17:46] just tap the loose ends and you need the
[17:48] loose ends to tie up
[17:50] so that the power could flow in
[17:53] because man was once powered by the
[17:54] power of god there was no loose ends he
[17:56] was he was complete and the power was
[17:59] resident in man
[18:01] then the devil come and and and started
[18:02] breaking things up and all the power
[18:04] just leaked right out so either tie up
[18:06] the loose ends that the power could come
[18:09] back
[18:10] because god don't want that power to
[18:11] leak back out
[18:13] so he brought it from the word and then
[18:14] he brought it to your personal life that
[18:15] you have some loose ends to tire
[18:18] and the loose sense is where the devil
[18:19] gave you all those punches and so on and
[18:20] once you tap those loose ends then god
[18:22] could pour his life his spirit
[18:25] his power into you so that was such a
[18:26] tremendous blessing amen and by god just
[18:29] about to contain a mighty way
[18:30] in the military of the spirit so we
[18:32] really appreciate those meetings and
[18:34] trust then i don't have the dvds but as
[18:36] we get them we will be able to play some
[18:38] of them and put them on the website and
[18:40] also uh pennsylvania also
[18:42] but we have the meetings in pennsylvania
[18:44] and i know it would be a tremendous
[18:46] blessing i
[18:47] was inspired
[18:49] to bring something to them
[18:52] about another people in the land
[18:54] i got the scripture from ezekiel chapter
[18:56] 24
[18:58] and it says thus ezekiel is unto you a
[19:00] sign
[19:01] according to all that he had done shall
[19:03] he do
[19:04] and when this cometh he shall know
[19:06] that i am the lord god and thou son of
[19:08] man shall it not be in the day when i
[19:11] take from them their strength
[19:13] the joy of their glory the desire of
[19:15] their eyes and that whereupon they set
[19:18] their minds their sons and their
[19:20] daughters
[19:21] for he
[19:23] that escape it in that day shall come
[19:25] unto thee to cause thee to hear it with
[19:27] thine ears
[19:28] in that day shall the mouth be opened to
[19:30] him which is escaped and thou shalt
[19:33] speak and be no more dumb thou shall be
[19:36] assigned unto them and they shall know
[19:38] that i am the lord and i spoke about the
[19:40] escape ones
[19:42] the group in the last days the escape on
[19:44] the overcomers
[19:45] escape the corruption that is in this
[19:47] world true loss you have to be an escape
[19:49] one escape the church system except your
[19:52] neighbors escaped false anointed escape
[19:54] the pope the beast the roman system
[19:56] excrete the world the things of the
[19:57] world you become an escape one in this
[19:59] last day when you begin to see how you
[20:02] have escaped then you could shout and
[20:04] praise and glorify god
[20:07] remember peter said having escaped the
[20:09] corruption that is in the world to lust
[20:12] that's lust for anything not just sex
[20:14] that's an over desire for money for
[20:15] popularity for fame for power you name
[20:18] it once that lust is there you have to
[20:20] escape all of that so you have to see
[20:22] yourself as an overcomer because the
[20:24] prophet said many groups gonna stand but
[20:26] there's only one group gonna remain
[20:28] the bunch of overcomers
[20:30] praise that's not a certain church
[20:32] that's individual it's not going to be
[20:34] in that group

[27:19] chapter 4
[27:20] colossians chapter 1
[27:23] and first corinthians chapter 12. first
[27:25] scripture reading
[27:32] read in ephesians chapter 4
[27:34] verse 11 to 16.
[27:42] and he gave some apostles some prophets
[27:45] some evangelists some pastors and
[27:47] teachers
[27:48] for the perfecting of the saints for the
[27:50] work of the ministry for the early fine
[27:53] of the body of christ
[27:54] till we all come in unity of the faith
[27:56] and of the knowledge of the son of god
[27:59] onto a perfect man
[28:00] unto the measure of the status of the
[28:02] fullness of christ
[28:04] that we hence what we know more children
[28:06] tossed to and through
[28:08] carried about with every wind of
[28:09] doctrine
[28:10] by the slay of men and craftiness
[28:13] whereby the lying way to deceive but
[28:16] speaking the truth in love
[28:18] may grow up into him in all things which
[28:21] is ahead even christ
[28:22] from whom the whole body
[28:24] fitly joined together and compacted
[28:28] by that which every joint supplier
[28:30] according to the effectual working in
[28:32] the measure of every part
[28:35] make an increase of the body
[28:37] onto the edifying of itself
[28:40] in love
[28:41] colossians 1 reading verse 16 to 18
[28:47] speaking about jesus and he is the head
[28:50] of the body the church
[28:52] who is the beginning
[28:54] the firstborn
[28:56] from the dead that in all things
[29:00] he might have oh sorry
[29:02] uh from 16 so i'm sorry first colossians
[29:06] 1 16
[29:08] for by him were all things created that
[29:11] in heaven and that an earth visible and
[29:13] invisible whether they be thrones or
[29:15] dominions
[29:17] or principalities or powers all things
[29:19] were created by him
[29:21] and for him
[29:22] and he is before all things and by
[29:26] him all things consist
[29:28] and he is the head
[29:30] of the body
[29:32] the church
[29:33] who is the beginning the firstborn from
[29:36] the dead that in all things he might
[29:39] have the preeminence
[29:41] and last scripture from first
[29:42] corinthians chapter 12.
[29:46] i want to read verse 13
[29:48] it says for by one spirit
[29:50] are we all baptized into one body
[29:52] whether we be jews or gentiles whether
[29:55] we bond or free and i've been all me to
[29:58] drink
[29:59] into one spirit let us pray father god
[30:01] we thank you for your word and i pray
[30:03] you will interpret it to the hearts of
[30:05] the people father god you know what you
[30:07] place upon me and i pray that you give
[30:09] it to me that i give it to them
[30:11] may you bless it and confirm your word
[30:13] with signs wonders miracles and
[30:14] deliverances and jesus might ask it amen
[30:17] amen you'll be seated praise god
[30:24] hallelujah
[30:36] and my inspiration
[30:39] is from
[30:41] matthew 16
[30:43] when jesus asks the question who do men
[30:45] say either son of man
[30:48] and then he asks his only disciples who
[30:49] do you see that i am
[30:51] and peter said that what the christ the
[30:53] son of the living god and jesus answered
[30:55] this is verse 17 of matthew 16 and jesus
[30:58] answered and said unto him blessed are
[30:59] those i'm about jonah for flesh and
[31:01] blood hath not revealed it unto thee but
[31:04] my father which is in heaven and i say
[31:06] unto thee the dog peter
[31:08] here we go and upon this rock
[31:11] i
[31:12] will build
[31:14] my church
[31:17] okay
[31:18] i'll backdrop
[31:20] but a brand name for a message called
[31:22] life
[31:25] the cars in that day will be shaped like
[31:27] an egg
[31:28] running back like this form here
[31:31] and it'll be controlled by some kind of
[31:33] power
[31:34] that won't even have to use the steering
[31:37] wheel at times just set her and go like
[31:40] that see
[31:41] before
[31:42] the annihilate the annihilation
[31:45] you remember that
[31:47] that's on record
[31:48] a woman will take over woman will take
[31:51] over
[31:52] i've always said it will take the united
[31:54] states right here the worship of a woman
[31:57] from 17th week of daniel now the fifth
[31:59] thing brother branham 1933 had seven
[32:02] visions
[32:03] which he said must come to pass before
[32:06] jesus come again
[32:08] he's talking about the fifth vision
[32:10] the sixth vision is the woman the
[32:12] seventh vision is when america was
[32:13] bummed up and smoke
[32:15] and so on
[32:17] listen to the fifth vision
[32:19] science will progress in such a way
[32:22] until they will make a car
[32:24] that will not have to be guided by a
[32:25] steering wheel and the cars will
[32:27] continue to be shaped like an egg
[32:30] until the consummation
[32:32] the end time
[32:33] i seen
[32:35] an american family
[32:37] going down the road in a broad way
[32:40] riding in a car with their backs turned
[32:43] towards where the wheel should be
[32:45] it looked like they were playing
[32:46] checkers or cars
[32:48] he says
[32:50] it's controlled by a remote control by
[32:52] radar they won't even have to have any
[32:54] steering wheel in it just set your dial
[32:57] like you dial your phone your car takes
[32:59] you right on to it it can't wreck or
[33:02] nothing no other cars the magnets keep
[33:04] the rest of them away from you see they
[33:06] got it i predicted this 30 years before
[33:08] it happened
[33:10] and
[33:11] the reason i'm reading this because this
[33:13] week passed about four days ago
[33:15] google
[33:16] who have been working on
[33:18] uh driverless cars cars that you don't
[33:20] need to drive and so on they just
[33:22] released a prototype and they had demoed
[33:25] it it's just like an egg just like the
[33:26] prophet said just curved like like an
[33:28] egg
[33:29] and they said it's like that shape so it
[33:31] have no blind spots
[33:33] and they dismiss the steering wheels
[33:35] they say they don't need any steering
[33:36] wheel there's no pedal they don't need
[33:38] no brakes you just because they're the
[33:40] computer and the
[33:42] the reader whatever and so on will
[33:44] control the whole thing now google have
[33:46] been doing this for a couple of years
[33:47] now and they have a car chalked up seven
[33:49] hundred thousand miles a lot of miles
[33:51] without one accident the car could stop
[33:53] at the red lights move on no a child is
[33:55] wrong all the sensors are there in other
[33:58] words you don't need to drive it and
[33:59] it's safer than human beings who looking
[34:01] on the road and so on i'm saying this
[34:03] because brother branham said this going
[34:05] to be before the confirmation
[34:07] or before the annihilation it's already
[34:09] here
[34:10] they don't need the steering wheel and i
[34:12] saw it the person was driving it that a
[34:13] blind person or somebody else and it
[34:15] just pressed it just one up the press
[34:17] you set where you go in the press and
[34:19] they say your phone will be to call the
[34:20] car bring the car to you so it's
[34:21] impressive what the prophet says it's
[34:23] kind of mind-blowing so i said i'll drop
[34:25] that in you and this is what the news
[34:27] said if you're on an easy of this is
[34:30] just about two three days ago
[34:32] at the idea of rising in a vehicle that
[34:33] drives itself just wait till you see
[34:35] google's new car it has no gas pedal no
[34:38] brake no steering wheel google has
[34:40] demonstrated its driverless technology
[34:42] for several years by retrofitting
[34:44] toyotas lexuses and other cars with
[34:45] cameras and sensors but now for the
[34:48] first time the company has unveiled a
[34:50] prototype of its own cute little car
[34:52] that look like a cross between a
[34:53] volkswagen beetle and a golf cart
[34:57] they won't have any steering wheel
[34:59] accelerating pedal or brake pedal
[35:01] because they don't need them google said
[35:04] in a block spot unlike previous models
[35:06] these cars won't have human drivers
[35:08] monitoring them all the time google says
[35:10] the cars can detect objects up to 200
[35:12] yards away in all directions adjust
[35:15] their speed tune and break in
[35:16] accordingly no driver no brakes
[35:21] so
[35:22] god send a profit
[35:28] and it doesn't matter how long it takes
[35:29] to come to pass whatever that prophet
[35:31] said it's going to come to pass
[35:33] because the prophet goes up in the
[35:34] spirit goes into the future comes back
[35:37] and ball does say at the lord he's not
[35:39] telling you what's not going to happen
[35:40] he's telling you what already happened
[35:42] because he seat by vision praise god it
[35:44] got to come to pass and that prophet
[35:46] said i believe the bride is called he
[35:48] already see you called
[35:49] i believe i am sealed into the kingdom
[35:52] of god you already see you sealed
[35:54] oh glory to god how many believe that
[35:56] this morning hallelujah praise god that
[35:59] means that you're you are going to be
[36:01] delivered
[36:02] oh glory to god amen hallelujah

[36:08] the rebuilding of the church by the
[36:11] spirit in the last days
[36:13] but the brand i'm praying
[36:16] dear god one by one we are called
[36:19] one by one we have to meet the challenge
[36:21] to walk down through the valley of the
[36:22] shadow of death it's due to every one of
[36:24] us as mortals but tonight you have
[36:27] offered us your petition that if you
[36:29] would believe on him and be baptized in
[36:31] his name you will take us in
[36:34] then in this body the body of christ not
[36:36] in church but in the body of christ that
[36:39] body has already been judged
[36:41] it will not have to come to judgment
[36:44] god poured out his rat upon that body
[36:46] and that body is free from sin
[36:48] and being in him puts us free from sin
[36:52] by his atonement that died for us
[36:54] and in deer we have fellowship one with
[36:56] another while the blood of jesus christ
[36:59] god's son keeps us clean from all sin
[37:01] and judgment

[37:22] ripened for your great ghana father i
[37:24] pray for them but this talk must dry so
[37:27] i cannot pray for it it must die
[37:30] so it is dead but i pray for the wheat

[37:36] christ

[40:57] word watch a bird is to be she is to be
[41:00] delivered of a new bird
[41:03] according to malachi 4. in the church
[41:05] world today there are two systems
[41:06] working
[41:07] not three
[41:09] not four
[41:10] not five just two
[41:12] it's either god or that ever
[41:15] a time no in between it has no
[41:17] in-between man it's god on one side and
[41:20] the devil on the other side i look at
[41:23] the devil holds the bible and wear a tie
[41:25] praise god god is the word and the devil
[41:28] is anything author of the word come on
[41:31] say him and somebody there is no
[41:34] in between
[41:36] heavy church
[41:38] there is no in between
[41:40] oh
[41:41] give the lord some glory
[41:44] go
[41:45] hallelujah
[41:46] hallelujah our religious spirit is from
[41:49] hell
[41:56] amen
[41:59] when paul was saying
[42:00] i want you to put up a line and put up
[42:02] with this he was not talking to
[42:03] unbelievers it's jewish people he's
[42:05] talking to
[42:06] let him that sees stole no more do this
[42:08] do that it's not unbelievers he talking
[42:10] to it's church people you're talking to
[42:12] oh hallelujah when he rebuking is that
[42:14] unbelievable he rebuking church people
[42:19] oh come on come on don't don't just
[42:20] watch me
[42:22] no say amen
[42:24] say amen somebody
[42:30] now watch we all know it
[42:33] listen i want you to get this
[42:35] it's the word of god and
[42:37] the nominational system
[42:40] there are two systems at work
[42:43] esau and jacob
[42:44] one after the spirit and the other after
[42:47] the flesh and they are fighting one
[42:50] another it's been so denominational and
[42:53] the word
[42:54] and then he said no it's always been
[42:56] that way and the reason they are bearing
[42:59] pains because there's a fight in her
[43:00] there's esau a man of the world very
[43:03] religious good fellow clean moral but he
[43:07] don't know nothing about the birthright
[43:09] he's born that way and jacob i don't
[43:11] care what he is
[43:13] what he wants the birthright
[43:15] he's the spiritual one
[43:17] and two today is in the womb of the
[43:19] church that's the great big system
[43:21] trying to be formed called the world
[43:23] council of churches and from the womb of
[43:25] the church is coming for two children
[43:27] the word here we go must deliver the
[43:30] word bright church
[43:34] come on now
[43:35] you mean baby coming baby
[43:38] coming i i i'm not hearing you
[43:42] oh i am here a baby is not coming you're
[43:46] not pregnant but the baby is coming i've
[43:48] been waiting a long time babe in the
[43:50] womb a long time
[43:55] oh
[43:56] hallelujah hallelujah let's go
[43:59] here we go
[44:01] them
[44:02] that fell asleep
[44:04] in all ages
[44:06] will make up that bride
[44:09] that come out on the wood that they come
[44:12] to put that they come out on
[44:14] like your feet coming out to your head
[44:17] she gets greater the more you have as
[44:20] the body grows up so the body of christ
[44:22] grows up and then finally the head will
[44:25] come to it
[44:26] and it's all linked to the head the head
[44:28] does the pulling
[44:30] so what i want to say to you today is
[44:31] this
[44:33] where i'm standing on this platform
[44:37] let's put this platform as the top
[44:40] of burglary kindness there
[44:43] that means
[44:45] we are on the top of the ages
[44:48] that means the majority of bride
[44:53] that makes up the body
[44:55] is already cold
[44:59] come on now
[45:01] come on now
[45:03] god is not now getting a list and say i
[45:06] better start to make up the body this is
[45:08] finishing the body
[45:10] this is finishing of the seventh seal
[45:12] this is finishing
[45:15] he promised to gather all things in
[45:17] christ
[45:19] both in heaven and earth
[45:25] so let's look at it now
[45:27] the majority of the bride
[45:29] is below
[45:33] it was so bad that god allowed the
[45:36] prophet to put a little light
[45:38] to represent the bride in the last days
[45:43] christ is the head let's say this is the
[45:45] head coming down here now
[45:47] so the head is coming down
[45:49] we are in between
[45:51] which will put us in the rainbow
[45:54] the holy spirit slot
[45:56] with the head coming down
[45:58] and the bride below
[46:00] the majority of them then we have to be
[46:02] stones
[46:05] called out
[46:06] to be fitted
[46:08] and by the bomb set it this way to make
[46:10] the headstone
[46:11] that he could come into it
[46:14] making day below without us
[46:17] they can't be perfect
[46:20] because we complete them
[46:33] glory to god
[46:35] hallelujah
[46:37] hallelujah
[46:39] my god
[46:41] oh glory to god
[46:44] when i begin to see this
[46:46] in the spirit realm
[46:48] when i begin to see the magnitude
[46:51] of what god was doing all along
[46:54] how we called the jews
[46:56] as a people
[46:58] and he came unto his own
[47:00] his own receive him that
[47:02] so he had to tale from the jews and go
[47:05] to the gentiles and paul was an apostle
[47:09] to the gentiles and he said the cross
[47:12] break the petition between the jews and
[47:16] the gentiles and now by one spirit we
[47:20] are baptized
[47:22] into one body
[47:24] the body of christ
[47:26] his church
[47:43] the same boat in the same field
[47:45] water by the same water
[47:48] same sunlight
[47:50] one is the word one is not the word
[47:53] and the two are fighting
[47:55] they have been fighting since the first
[47:57] reformation they are still fighting
[48:00] there we are
[48:01] there you are what system are you in
[48:05] hallelujah
[48:07] oh glory to god
[48:09] just imagine now if you would have lived
[48:11] back in the other day
[48:13] under the jolting of god's prophets
[48:15] and words that come forth
[48:18] what side would you want to be on back
[48:19] there
[48:20] you got the same choice today
[48:23] she is fixing to bring forth the perfect
[48:25] word back there
[48:27] and the word
[48:28] is coming for a word bride
[48:31] and as a woman is part of a man taken
[48:33] from him
[48:34] so the church
[48:36] would have to be a word abiding church
[48:39] every word of the bible
[48:41] not systems
[48:43] not dogmas
[48:44] no watch
[48:45] they build so many systems
[48:48] around the world
[48:50] until when the prophet comes it shakes
[48:52] them
[48:56] notice
[48:57] whenever god comes on the scene it rocks
[49:00] the system that people are custom worth
[49:03] because god has like a oddball to shake
[49:06] things up
[49:07] different kind of style different kind
[49:10] of preaching different kind of blast and
[49:13] bastard
[49:16] shaking they will hate such a man but
[49:20] when a man hears from god god give him
[49:22] vision god give him purpose god give him
[49:25] ambition because he hear from god
[49:34] you may be seated
[49:36] no watch
[49:39] so when the prophet come she had birth
[49:41] pains what was it back to the world
[49:44] back to the life
[49:46] systems
[49:48] doesn't have a life
[49:50] it's only god's word have life
[49:54] systems are built around it
[49:57] it doesn't have life
[49:59] so if the system say everybody else
[50:02] falls and you not system then you see
[50:03] everybody as false if the system say
[50:05] everybody blue then you see everybody
[50:07] blue because the system said that but
[50:09] what does the word say
[50:15] then people who in the system have
[50:17] questions about the word
[50:19] but the bride have no questions because
[50:22] as a husband
[50:23] i made
[50:24] the reveal where
[50:26] once the word is revealed that's your
[50:28] husband
[50:29] you want to kiss him you want to hug him
[50:32] you want to hold him because that is
[50:35] your husband
[50:37] come on say him and somebody
[50:39] oh give the lord some glory
[50:42] give the lord some prayer
[50:48] so watch
[50:49] came unto his own
[50:51] rejected go to the gentiles what do you
[50:54] think happened this last day read
[50:55] revenge chapter three behold i stand and
[50:58] don't knock what they do they kick out
[50:59] christ he's outside he says let me man
[51:02] hear my voice not church now individuals
[51:06] oh glory to god
[51:08] oh hallelujah
[51:10] we're going to deal with that in the
[51:11] evening service if any man hear my voice
[51:14] and open up i'm going to minister to him
[51:17] oh glory to god he will open his mouth
[51:19] to the escape once oh
[51:23] hallelujah
[51:25] oh glory
[51:27] why why why because they're going to
[51:28] come on famine in the last days for the
[51:31] hearing of the word of god then god
[51:35] going to speak
[51:36] direct from god
[51:38] you're going to hear direct from god god
[51:41] will open his mouth to the escape ones
[51:47] not to the deceived ones
[51:49] no no escape ones escape the reception
[51:53] oh hallelujah
[51:55] oh glory they're gone
[51:57] so therefore systems
[51:59] are built around the life but only the
[52:01] word that give life
[52:03] watch something a little group will come
[52:04] out and believe in noah's time there's
[52:06] eight people
[52:07] god rock the remnant and destroy the
[52:10] rest of them to rock away
[52:12] but the brandon preacher message called
[52:13] five definite definite identifications
[52:16] of the true church
[52:17] of the living god
[52:19] and when god opened up
[52:21] certain things to me
[52:22] i didn't know it was spoken
[52:24] so it was a real excitement to find
[52:27] where the prophet spoke it
[52:29] whole glory to god
[52:31] listen to brother branham he said the
[52:33] word church
[52:35] and in this case i want to speak to you
[52:38] what is the church
[52:39] who set it up
[52:41] what is its message
[52:43] how do we become a member of it
[52:45] and can we get to heaven
[52:48] without being a member of it
[52:50] and that's how we approach
[52:52] this message
[52:54] and we just go along
[52:56] now the first place the word church
[52:58] itself
[53:00] means they called out
[53:02] now israel was not the church as long as
[53:04] they were in egypt they were the people
[53:06] of god but when god called them out of
[53:08] egypt they become the church of god
[53:10] so god was always interested in having
[53:12] church in his program of vision of
[53:16] church
[53:17] because they would have called out now
[53:18] that still remains the same today the
[53:20] word church means called out ones those
[53:22] that have been called out
[53:23] separated
[53:25] made different
[53:26] now when the old testament the church
[53:28] was known as the kingdom of god
[53:31] i love that
[53:33] saul is king and david is king and
[53:35] kingdom means king over domain that's
[53:38] where i get kingdom
[53:40] king ruling in the domain
[53:42] king was the head
[53:44] the people were under him when it
[53:45] switched to the church
[53:47] christ is the king
[53:49] and he is the head of the body the
[53:50] church
[53:51] but in the church he become the cap
[53:56] to you the pyramid
[53:58] come on now
[53:59] then the bride becomes his body
[54:04] oh glory to god are you with me
[54:07] so the bride is not just the bride the
[54:10] blood is not just saved people the bride
[54:12] is the body of christ
[54:17] my my mind and that body is a mystery
[54:24] hallelujah
[54:27] that body that we are preaching about
[54:29] today is a mystery
[54:33] let's continue
[54:34] now watch
[54:35] in the old testament church was called
[54:37] the kingdom of god
[54:38] i'm talking from the colonies of the
[54:40] bible
[54:41] old testament the church was called the
[54:43] kingdom of god in other words god is a
[54:45] king the church is his domain
[54:47] and in the new testament it is called
[54:50] the messiah empire he said i like that
[54:53] messiah
[54:54] in other words where the messiah rules
[54:56] and reigns
[54:58] no
[54:58] denominational buyers or nothing the
[55:01] messiah rules in his empire is not
[55:04] wonderful the messiah
[55:06] uh empire
[55:08] therefore the church here we go
[55:10] is not an organization
[55:14] let's go down deeper now the church is
[55:17] not a gardener people
[55:21] the church is the people of god that's
[55:24] been called out of the world to serve in
[55:28] another kingdom
[55:34] oh hallelujah this centuries member
[55:36] scattering
[55:38] the silverware in another kingdom that's
[55:40] why jesus said my kingdom is not of this
[55:43] world if my kingdom was of this world my
[55:46] men would fight for me but my kingdom is
[55:49] not of this world
[55:51] oh give the lord some glory
[55:53] give the lord some praise as people
[55:56] and we belong to that kingdom
[55:59] hallelujah
[56:01] hallelujah hallelujah
[56:04] my god my god
[56:11] as i travel around the world i find
[56:13] every nation has its own spirit
[56:16] all nations are controlled by the devil
[56:22] all governments are ruled by the devil
[56:26] pick anyone
[56:35] i want to repeat that
[56:37] all nations
[56:39] are controlled by the devil
[56:44] governments are ruled by the devil
[56:46] the bible said so
[56:48] they fight the war and they will till
[56:51] jesus come
[56:55] is one king demon who in charge of this
[56:57] nation fight the next king demon in the
[56:59] next nation and they're fighting his
[57:00] demons
[57:01] having their own show
[57:05] that has nothing to do with our kingdom
[57:12] oh
[57:14] right now russia making a move and china
[57:17] making a move and japan saying this and
[57:19] north korea trying to serve this and we
[57:21] are heirs of the whole earth
[57:25] what are you saying
[57:28] you are possessors often seen and
[57:30] unsealed
[57:31] what are you saying you are called the
[57:34] possessive case of the enemy what are
[57:36] you saying
[57:40] you are called to be overcomer what are
[57:43] you saying
[57:49] let's go
[57:52] when you go into germany you find a
[57:54] german spirit
[57:56] you go into england you find the english
[57:58] spirit you're going to sweden you find a
[58:00] sweden spirit swedish spirit you go into
[58:03] france you find a french spirit you come
[58:05] to america you find an american spirit
[58:06] but when you're born of the heavenly
[58:08] spirit
[58:09] their spirit is no more
[58:14] come on now
[58:15] no more american no more german no more
[58:18] swedish no more french it's by one
[58:24] by one spirit
[58:30] baptized into
[58:34] one body
[58:36] there is one lord
[58:38] there is one faith
[58:40] there is one baptism
[58:42] and there is one body
[58:45] the church
[58:46] his bride that's a
[58:48] mystery oh glory don't call him man
[58:54] are you in the church triumphant are you
[58:56] when the savior's pride come and be
[58:59] baptized into the body
[59:01] oh hallelujah hallelujah
[59:04] many thought that they were in the body
[59:06] till the holy ghost had come
[59:14] church
[59:15] jesus had a failure right in front of me
[59:17] i see two side of theory
[59:19] i see the kingdom
[59:21] i see the people of every nation every
[59:22] tongue every people baptize into the
[59:25] body no man could control let's not go
[59:27] there
[59:28] oh glory oh they could control church
[59:31] but not the body
[59:33] come on say man somebody
[59:35] oh not that woman
[59:37] that jesus woman
[59:39] that's jesus bride that's jesus church
[59:45] oh
[59:46] hallelujah
[59:48] she won't be manhandled
[59:57] oh hallelujah
[59:59] watch they are born of a heavenly spirit
[1:00:01] their spirit is no more americanized
[1:00:04] it's no more germanized it is heavenly
[1:00:06] lies but i'm saying that
[1:00:08] the new word it is heavenly lies
[1:00:10] for the kingdom of god because we are in
[1:00:13] another kingdom a kingdom of god where
[1:00:16] decency holiness
[1:00:19] and power exists
[1:00:21] we have access to our king
[1:00:23] we have an interview with him
[1:00:25] whenever you want to call upon him we
[1:00:27] have no other intercessors
[1:00:29] no other mediator between the king and
[1:00:32] us
[1:00:33] but one man christ jesus
[1:00:35] so we are living in a kingdom it is
[1:00:37] called the messiah kingdom in other
[1:00:40] words where the messiah rules in every
[1:00:42] life in his dominion
[1:00:44] rule in the lives of his people are
[1:00:47] called out people from every walk of
[1:00:48] life
[1:00:49] gather him together in a group that he
[1:00:52] calls it his church his called out ones
[1:00:55] it's a beautiful thing
[1:00:57] so israel was the people of god
[1:01:00] until they were called the church of god
[1:01:02] isn't that right and now the church of
[1:01:04] god today is the same thing called out
[1:01:06] of everything of the world called out of
[1:01:08] a religious cult called out of every
[1:01:10] religious denomination call it of every
[1:01:12] religious organization to walk with god
[1:01:15] not
[1:01:16] being governed by a bishop
[1:01:19] but being governed by christ
[1:01:21] in this messiah kingdom that we live in
[1:01:24] christ is the king
[1:01:26] now christ here we go
[1:01:27] is the head of this
[1:01:32] so when you don't want headquarters you
[1:01:33] know what you're talking about now right
[1:01:36] he's head in the headquarters christ
[1:01:39] is the head of this
[1:01:41] christ
[1:01:42] is the head of this messiah kingdom
[1:01:45] and you cannot organize
[1:01:47] a kingdom of which christ is the head
[1:01:54] i want to have a bigger amount on that
[1:01:57] you cannot organize a kingdom
[1:01:59] on which christ is the head
[1:02:01] you cannot denominate a kingdom
[1:02:04] which christ is the head because christ
[1:02:07] is king and you cannot take the
[1:02:09] intellectuals of man and make an
[1:02:11] organization to which christ will govern
[1:02:14] he is not a ceo he is not a cfo he is
[1:02:18] not a manager he is not a director he is
[1:02:21] the king
[1:02:24] of his domain
[1:02:26] of his kingdom
[1:02:28] even the messiah empire
[1:02:34] oh and we shall chronic king of kings
[1:02:37] and lord of lords
[1:02:46] oh you are free this morning
[1:02:49] my god you're free this morning
[1:02:52] i feel the freedom in here this morning
[1:02:54] oh glory to god it's a great thing to be
[1:02:58] free
[1:02:59] no chains binding you nobody holding you
[1:03:03] down nobody holding you back
[1:03:06] we have no enemies on the outside
[1:03:09] no church keeping us back no man keeping
[1:03:12] us back
[1:03:16] oh glory glory glory
[1:03:18] glory
[1:03:20] glory
[1:03:26] let's go
[1:03:29] therefore you cannot take the intellects
[1:03:30] of a man
[1:03:32] and make an organization to which christ
[1:03:34] will govern
[1:03:35] therefore here we go buddha brown
[1:03:37] any companies
[1:03:39] any peoples
[1:03:41] any groups of men
[1:03:43] that tries to organize the kingdom of
[1:03:46] god
[1:03:47] is going contrary to the king
[1:03:50] and if they're going to contrary to the
[1:03:52] king it will be against the king
[1:03:55] and if it's against the king it would be
[1:03:57] antichrist
[1:04:03] what abandons it that's pretty rough
[1:04:07] if i had a little more voice
[1:04:09] we would make that clear
[1:04:12] it is antichrist
[1:04:14] or antichrist
[1:04:16] however you want to say it it's the same
[1:04:18] thing
[1:04:19] oh can we give the lord some praises
[1:04:29] and if you will bear with me a few
[1:04:30] minutes i'll prove it
[1:04:34] now we talk about two birds right one is
[1:04:36] the word i wanted any guy spirit true
[1:04:38] organization
[1:04:39] no organization in the spirit
[1:04:43] but branham
[1:04:44] an antichrist spirit
[1:04:47] tries to take the people
[1:04:49] and call them
[1:04:51] from organization
[1:04:53] to organization
[1:04:55] organizing them together
[1:04:57] which never was the will of god
[1:05:00] now people have always fussed at me
[1:05:02] because i struck so hard at
[1:05:04] organizations
[1:05:05] it isn't the people in there i am
[1:05:07] striking at
[1:05:09] it's the dominating spirit
[1:05:11] that makes the people think
[1:05:14] that we are the people
[1:05:20] the people think that
[1:05:25] but there's a mystery
[1:05:27] of the body of christ
[1:05:30] that they miss completely
[1:05:32] because you don't join that
[1:05:34] you are baptized into that
[1:05:39] so people could put you out of the
[1:05:41] company out of their churches out of
[1:05:44] their circles but they can't put you out
[1:05:46] of the body
[1:05:58] brother branham
[1:06:00] god's people
[1:06:02] is a call-out people i believe
[1:06:05] they are in every denomination
[1:06:07] they could be catholic
[1:06:09] they could be protestant they could be
[1:06:12] jewish they could be any kind of church
[1:06:15] but the real church there we go is the
[1:06:17] mystical body of jesus christ
[1:06:23] come on now
[1:06:25] come on now
[1:06:26] we getting down into business
[1:06:29] oh hallelujah
[1:06:31] upon this rock
[1:06:32] i
[1:06:34] will build
[1:06:36] my church
[1:06:37] and the kings of hell
[1:06:39] that's why we are standing
[1:06:42] because god has given us a rock
[1:06:45] a revelation
[1:06:50] oh
[1:06:52] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:06:54] oh glory to god
[1:06:56] oh hallelujah hallelujah
[1:06:59] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[1:07:02] glory to god hallelujah
[1:07:05] peter heard from heaven you may be
[1:07:07] seated
[1:07:08] that's the problem right there
[1:07:10] people hearing from men
[1:07:12] people hearing what this brother say
[1:07:14] what that minister say that one on tape
[1:07:16] say this man another convention say
[1:07:18] that's hearing men but when you hear
[1:07:20] from heaven jesus said peter flesh and
[1:07:22] blood
[1:07:24] flesh and blood
[1:07:25] what you heard didn't come from flesh
[1:07:26] and blood what the reveal was on flesh
[1:07:29] and blood had not revealed this unto you
[1:07:32] but my father in heaven
[1:07:41] let me be seated
[1:07:43] woman with a bloody issue if she had
[1:07:45] taken a husband she never went to jesus
[1:07:47] if she had taken associates her friends
[1:07:50] or
[1:07:52] cheap tea party friends
[1:07:54] mitten and so in friends you should take
[1:07:55] them on a cake keep making friends if
[1:07:57] you take them on she was gonna go to
[1:07:59] jesus because her small church noise
[1:08:01] rebels rosa set up fishermen prostitutes
[1:08:04] all kind of characters hanging around
[1:08:06] this messiah he's talking about my
[1:08:08] kingdom is another world and you have
[1:08:10] heard in all times i sent you love your
[1:08:12] enemies this man has to be half crack
[1:08:15] and she said if i could just touch the
[1:08:17] helm of his camera i'll be made whole
[1:08:24] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[1:08:27] hallelujah hallelujah you let me see
[1:08:29] that that woman was so persuaded of
[1:08:31] money right now there's a money some of
[1:08:32] you your money to run out praise god
[1:08:34] you're stuck up and puff up because you
[1:08:36] have a tingling in your pocket praise
[1:08:38] god hallelujah it's ringing some coins
[1:08:41] knocking inside your pocket and having
[1:08:43] with some ungodly pride but when that
[1:08:46] money ran out she knew she had wants to
[1:08:48] bend down low and get on different to
[1:08:51] get what she had need of and when you
[1:08:54] are stripped of your pride strip of your
[1:08:56] envy and jealousy shipped of who you
[1:08:59] think you are you are ready for god to
[1:09:01] minister to you you are ready for
[1:09:04] something to break up on your life some
[1:09:06] of you need to break out inside of here
[1:09:08] some of you to get out of yourself get
[1:09:10] out of your shell give your god some
[1:09:13] glory
[1:09:24] let me see this
[1:09:27] you cannot
[1:09:29] organize
[1:09:30] the mystical body of christ
[1:09:35] you are a member of that body
[1:09:38] when you are brought and baptized into
[1:09:40] this mystical body
[1:09:41] it's not methodist
[1:09:43] it's not baptist
[1:09:45] it's not pentecostal
[1:09:47] it's not nazarene parolus not catholic
[1:09:50] but the body of christ
[1:09:52] we'll pick it up a little deeper
[1:09:54] he said now watch
[1:09:55] the body of christ is the church
[1:09:59] now
[1:09:59] he likened it in many parables like
[1:10:01] husband and wife he calls the church the
[1:10:03] bride and the bride is no longer the
[1:10:05] bragging was no longer two people they
[1:10:07] are one she is flesh of his flesh bone
[1:10:09] of his bone and then when a man and
[1:10:11] woman is called to the mystical body of
[1:10:14] christ
[1:10:15] by the holy spirit i love how we please
[1:10:17] these words i'll say it again when a man
[1:10:20] a woman
[1:10:21] is called
[1:10:22] and i trust that this service will give
[1:10:24] you a burden
[1:10:26] a hungering
[1:10:27] to be in that body to be into his church
[1:10:31] he'd have nice pentecostal church nice
[1:10:33] message church my all kind of nice
[1:10:35] churches fine people go there but that's
[1:10:37] not the real church
[1:10:41] that's not the church that's gonna raise
[1:10:44] you have to get into him
[1:10:46] that body is already judged
[1:10:48] so you being in him god there's no
[1:10:50] judgment for you
[1:10:52] because he already take judgment for you
[1:10:54] you are free in christ
[1:10:56] you are delivered in christ oh you are
[1:10:58] fine in christ the work is finished for
[1:11:01] you in christ
[1:11:02] you have a rest in christ
[1:11:04] christ is your victory he's your
[1:11:05] salvation he's your joy amen
[1:11:10] oh hallelujah
[1:11:12] then they should love him
[1:11:14] serve him with all your heart
[1:11:15] now watch he said when a man a woman is
[1:11:18] called to the mystical body of christ
[1:11:20] by the holy spirit they become a full
[1:11:23] member of his body when they are filled
[1:11:25] with the holy ghost
[1:11:26] because god took the spirit out of
[1:11:27] christ raise up his body place it on his
[1:11:30] throne and send back listen
[1:11:33] the holy spirit to make up
[1:11:36] the mystical body of christ which would
[1:11:38] be united at the marriage supper at the
[1:11:39] coming of the lord you cannot organize
[1:11:42] it and here we go it is a mystery
[1:11:47] so how are you going to organize your
[1:11:48] mystery
[1:11:51] holy ghost reigning mystery

[1:12:28] the word of god and god put your name on
[1:12:31] the lamb's work of life as a mystery in
[1:12:34] the blood section

[1:15:15] made now known to the saints what is the
[1:15:18] height what is the death what is the
[1:15:19] riches of the glory of this mystery

[1:15:57] paul he said what you have to give up
[1:15:59] anyhow

[1:16:03] leader behind

[1:16:32] come on now i'm staying at somebody
[1:16:38] oh hallelujah

[1:17:14] that's about to break upon the church
[1:17:17] which he was here
[1:17:18] to see sons who catch full revelation
[1:17:22] we're not talking about just an
[1:17:23] understanding now because he talked
[1:17:25] about the intelligence coming down and i
[1:17:27] was thinking about the word intelligence
[1:17:29] intelligence is not knowledge
[1:17:33] because blackberry had business they had
[1:17:35] phones that knowledge
[1:17:37] but they didn't have the intelligence to
[1:17:39] see how it was unfolding
[1:17:42] because they was going to do they must
[1:17:43] research to bring out their phone to
[1:17:44] give the iphone a run for the money
[1:17:48] but when steve just finished with them
[1:17:49] everybody had to be scampering
[1:17:51] because he brought up something better
[1:17:53] different
[1:17:54] that they was not thinking about he was
[1:17:56] seen ahead by vision
[1:17:58] that's what vision make you do
[1:18:00] make it do things others don't think
[1:18:01] about
[1:18:02] others how to pick up afterwards it
[1:18:04] makes you lead others have to follow
[1:18:06] that's the bride
[1:18:07] come on say i mean somebody
[1:18:09] i'm not hearing you
[1:18:11] i'm not hearing you
[1:18:12] you don't have to ask permission to
[1:18:14] declare who you are
[1:18:18] glory to god you don't have to ask for
[1:18:21] confirmation of who you are
[1:18:23] the bible said whom the whole body
[1:18:25] fitly joined together
[1:18:27] and compacted by which every joint
[1:18:30] supplier the effectual working of every
[1:18:33] part
[1:18:37] in other words this body will have no
[1:18:39] schism
[1:18:41] sit down a minute
[1:18:43] could you imagine my air having a fight
[1:18:44] with my nose
[1:18:48] could you imagine my eye her fight by
[1:18:50] the tongue

[1:19:19] is that wisdom that mind that governs
[1:19:22] that rules that guys that direct it's
[1:19:24] more than knowledge in other words

[1:25:58] world
[1:26:00] they can't get it
[1:26:01] they don't understand it
[1:26:03] satan
[1:26:04] don't understand it
[1:26:07] none of them the rest of them
[1:26:08] understands it just those who are
[1:26:10] predestinated
[1:26:12] understanded how god and christ are won
[1:26:16] now watch secondly
[1:26:17] the manifested christ in you the hope of
[1:26:20] glory
[1:26:21] manifested god in christ now
[1:26:24] christ
[1:26:25] manifested
[1:26:26] in you
[1:26:28] look there's some christians of god
[1:26:29] reveal
[1:26:30] what was once god great secret
[1:26:33] here we go
[1:26:34] great
[1:26:35] mysterious secret
[1:26:37] that some preachers want to make it more
[1:26:38] mysterious
[1:26:40] than god himself
[1:26:41] you know god was so mysterious he he
[1:26:43] wanted to reveal himself and he come
[1:26:45] down in simplicity but some men take
[1:26:47] this mysterious thing and make it more
[1:26:49] mysterious that they have to break it
[1:26:50] down and break it down and god lord
[1:26:55] when a dog you'll say yeah boy you could
[1:26:57] really break it down break it down
[1:26:59] break it down
[1:27:00] break it down
[1:27:01] the car say table that i see atop four
[1:27:05] legs unmuted
[1:27:07] but there's a table
[1:27:14] but they want to hold the mystery
[1:27:15] themselves
[1:27:18] but i said the holy ghost alone
[1:27:21] is the revealer
[1:27:23] of the mystery of christ
[1:27:29] so it's sad to see people having
[1:27:32] itchiness
[1:27:35] keeping until deserved teachers
[1:27:38] when the more of god that you get
[1:27:41] is the more simple
[1:27:43] you become
[1:27:45] you you could talk to the bull
[1:27:48] you could talk to the bees
[1:27:50] an intellectual man is a complicated
[1:27:52] thing they even think about
[1:27:53] communicating with bull
[1:27:55] but when you come closer to god
[1:27:58] and you get the love of god and you
[1:28:00] connect with the dominion of god that
[1:28:01] was in genesis 1 26 when cosine let that
[1:28:05] man of dominion and the bull come say
[1:28:07] bull i'm a servant of god go back and
[1:28:09] lie down
[1:28:11] and that bullet to push breaks mode
[1:28:14] because that bull coming down that way
[1:28:16] but that bullet the press breaks
[1:28:19] to stop in front of the prophet
[1:28:25] oh
[1:28:26] hallelujah
[1:28:28] so simple you may be seated you could
[1:28:30] talk to a dead fish
[1:28:32] i said little fishy i'd give you back
[1:28:33] your life
[1:28:35] so simple you could talk to a tumor
[1:28:37] before the doctors and touches my wife
[1:28:39] tumor
[1:28:40] dung hallelujah he don't have to be in
[1:28:44] the hospital room just speak the word
[1:28:47] speak the word
[1:28:49] just speak the word
[1:28:51] because we belong to another kingdom
[1:28:54] in this kingdom of power and the power
[1:28:56] comes by the word if we speak it gonna
[1:28:59] happen because my word shall return
[1:29:02] forward
[1:29:03] praise god i'm taking the thoughts of
[1:29:05] god to speak the word of god
[1:29:08] oh
[1:29:22] 420 i believe it is the kingdom of god
[1:29:24] is not in word
[1:29:26] but
[1:29:28] in
[1:29:29] power
[1:29:31] but the problem is people sit down in
[1:29:33] this message so long
[1:29:34] it come like johnny crew
[1:29:36] tie to the tree so long
[1:29:39] now when they call get cut
[1:29:40] johnnyco is still making circles
[1:29:43] the other person said johnny let's move
[1:29:45] he said move away
[1:29:47] you notice about the elephant
[1:29:49] let's put the elephant on a stake from
[1:29:50] small so if i know he can't go far
[1:29:53] because it's take down
[1:29:54] until when i get big i still believe

[1:30:25] never venture
[1:30:26] never stepped out
[1:30:28] they're afraid to fail they're afraid
[1:30:30] that god wouldn't show up
[1:30:31] that's why they don't want to step out
[1:30:33] because they don't have faith to believe
[1:30:35] god will show up
[1:30:36] because god has made you put yourself on
[1:30:38] the line
[1:30:40] god has let your faith go out on the
[1:30:41] line
[1:30:42] to see if you're going to believe it

[1:34:24] made known to them by his grace how the
[1:34:26] grace of god comes to god's people
[1:34:28] and paul said in the last days there
[1:34:30] shall be people heady high-minded lovers
[1:34:32] of pleasures more than lovers of god
[1:34:34] truth-breakers false accusers and

[1:34:39] heady high-minded high in a form of
[1:34:41] godliness led away by divers lust never
[1:34:44] able to come to the none of the truth
[1:34:46] these men resisted janice and jambres
[1:34:49] was able to produce a church produce a
[1:34:51] group of people but their folly will be
[1:34:54] made manifest when jesus take his bride

[1:40:35] in pennsylvania i asked the brother
[1:40:36] there for a plumb line a plummet
[1:40:39] and i held it up to the people
[1:40:41] a plummet gives a thick footicle
[1:40:44] the weight connects to gravity
[1:40:46] you could go crossways and off-key with
[1:40:48] levels and so on but i plummet perfect
[1:40:49] every time so the building is leaning
[1:40:52] the problem exposes it
[1:40:53] the problem speaks for itself
[1:40:55] you don't need to say plummet when you
[1:40:56] think about that no just hang it
[1:40:59] and it speaks
[1:41:01] for itself
[1:41:02] you can't shift the problem and say
[1:41:04] let's move me left
[1:41:06] because my building shape left right
[1:41:08] so so move a little bit so the permit
[1:41:10] doesn't shift for pastor prophet teacher
[1:41:13] evangelist apostle nobody he promised
[1:41:15] god
[1:41:16] and inside twenty they say righteousness
[1:41:18] i will lead to the plummet
[1:41:20] when i heal re when i was then i wash
[1:41:22] away the refuge of lies
[1:41:24] the hiding behind lies i'll wash it away
[1:41:27] hallelujah oh yes truth will always come
[1:41:30] forward hallelujah not knowledge truth
[1:41:33] not you shall not have knowledge you
[1:41:35] shall know the truth
[1:41:37] and the truth shall set you free
[1:41:39] oh howler the truth brings out the
[1:41:41] reality of the matter
[1:41:44] oh hallelujah praise god that plummet
[1:41:46] that promise is the word i have to line
[1:41:48] up with it you have to learn about it
[1:41:50] all man jacqueline put it we don't twist
[1:41:52] the plummet we change ourselves to
[1:41:54] deployment
[1:41:55] probably is a perfect vertical that's
[1:41:57] what god's going to judge everything by
[1:41:59] russians i relate to the plummet
[1:42:01] oh hallelujah i love the word of god
[1:42:05] word of god is pure
[1:42:06] word of god is true
[1:42:08] he is no respecter of persons i have no
[1:42:11] eyes as you
[1:42:14] come on now give the lord a shout on
[1:42:15] that one
[1:42:20] let's stop making excuses
[1:42:24] let's believe the word for what it is
[1:42:26] if god said so god said so
[1:42:28] for example brother branham said when
[1:42:30] russia go down to get that oil
[1:42:32] and i know i always knew the quote so i
[1:42:33] know when russia next premier i said no
[1:42:36] something in there checking to find out
[1:42:37] where is the oil oh in the final oil is
[1:42:40] in the
[1:42:40] sea so now that russia take cremia
[1:42:43] russia gains so much of sea space and in
[1:42:45] that species they say if creamer was
[1:42:47] held by ukraine ukraine was going to be
[1:42:48] oil sufficient because all the oil and
[1:42:50] you see russia already have it already
[1:42:51] because russia are next crimea according
[1:42:53] to the prophet's vision
[1:42:56] then if that come to pass if google
[1:42:58] released a coward or sharing that come
[1:43:00] to pass annihilation will come to pass
[1:43:03] everything that prophet said will come
[1:43:04] to pass what about the bride revival
[1:43:14] now hear the bomb hear the bomb what we
[1:43:16] see
[1:43:20] so do what

[1:43:50] hallelujah they're going to make a
[1:43:51] revival
[1:43:52] you may be seated then you have to get a
[1:43:54] revelation of being the church you have
[1:43:57] to get a revelation that you are seed of

[1:44:17] praise be to jesus
[1:44:20] oh glory to god
[1:44:22] notice the vindicated word in his body
[1:44:25] is the very victory and reason of his
[1:44:28] death the vindicated word in his body
[1:44:31] the body is the bride but branham said
[1:44:33] now watch
[1:44:34] he said no i'm a member i am this you're
[1:44:36] not a member of our nice
[1:44:39] organization i'm a member by the grace
[1:44:40] and the body of christ i'm your brother
[1:44:42] i have no selfish motives my motive to
[1:44:44] achieve anything personally i am only
[1:44:47] zealous for the lord god and i see this
[1:44:50] with all my heart
[1:44:51] the very thing that you were called out
[1:44:53] of you have gone back into it again
[1:44:55] as they're so good of wallow and a dog
[1:44:57] against this vomit the vomit made the
[1:44:59] dog sick in the first place
[1:45:01] why
[1:45:02] if organization and the creator has got
[1:45:04] the people so bound up and god has
[1:45:06] quality by free people and you turn
[1:45:08] right back is a sin to you
[1:45:10] notice someone sampson had them doing
[1:45:12] tricks to entertain them that's just
[1:45:14] about the way it is
[1:45:15] he says it got instead of the holy
[1:45:17] spirit and when someone raises up and
[1:45:19] gets arrogant the holy spirit is
[1:45:21] obligated to god to shut that thing up
[1:45:24] oh praise the name of the lord
[1:45:26] they can't be original if watch he said
[1:45:29] that's the way the churches can't be let
[1:45:31] one church get something not in the city
[1:45:33] the other just can't stand it
[1:45:34] until they get it they're not original
[1:45:37] anymore
[1:45:38] god word is original it's the word it
[1:45:40] has to bring forth it's kind
[1:45:43] it's kind in its season
[1:45:45] how do we get into this church by one
[1:45:47] spirit we all baptize into one body
[1:45:51] oh my soul would cry hallelujah to god
[1:45:54] oh praise god amen when i think that god
[1:45:57] puts in his church the best that he can
[1:45:58] find
[1:46:00] god takes his children and tests them
[1:46:02] with acid tests
[1:46:05] then he places them into the body of
[1:46:08] christ
[1:46:09] because they are tested
[1:46:13] come on i expect you to run that one
[1:46:20] hallelujah
[1:46:21] that's the plumb line
[1:46:24] amen i said test
[1:46:27] he said they believed they went through
[1:46:28] trials they had the experience they are
[1:46:31] witnesses of his they know what they're
[1:46:32] talking about not just intellectual
[1:46:34] conception but they have been born again
[1:46:37] of the precious holy spirit and time
[1:46:39] tested and tried until their soul set
[1:46:42] like flint towards calvary
[1:46:44] yes they are time tested they are
[1:46:46] witnessed on his power oh glory in the
[1:46:48] last day revelation the seven seals
[1:46:50] revelation six in the last day
[1:46:52] revelation we find out loudly said the
[1:46:54] last messenger during the time of his
[1:46:56] prophecy the seven seals will be open
[1:46:58] the seven mysteries the sevenfold
[1:47:00] mystery will be left off to every age
[1:47:02] and so forth but we are promised
[1:47:04] according to revelation 10 malachi 4
[1:47:06] that there will come an ephesians to
[1:47:08] this
[1:47:09] what does he mean he's going to come to
[1:47:11] one lord
[1:47:12] one fate
[1:47:13] one baptism
[1:47:15] one body and when you see that body
[1:47:17] you're going to be part of that body
[1:47:20] being here in the church is nothing
[1:47:22] what if the main thing is to be in the
[1:47:24] body
[1:47:25] this church here is to get that you
[1:47:27] could get the word that something will
[1:47:28] come upon your life that you could get
[1:47:30] desperate and say lord baptize my soul
[1:47:33] put me into heavenly places hallelujah
[1:47:36] let the white light pass through my
[1:47:37] being
[1:47:38] leave a portion of yourself in me
[1:47:41] fill me with your spirit
[1:47:43] oh glory to god amen so ephesians is not
[1:47:46] the local church
[1:47:48] ephesians is the bride body
[1:47:50] international
[1:47:52] oh hallelujah the fifo ministry is not
[1:47:55] just the local church the fifo ministry
[1:47:58] is for international
[1:48:00] it's for the bright body
[1:48:03] the bright body
[1:48:04] not churches not conventions the bright
[1:48:08] body
[1:48:09] all the body of christ
[1:48:12] oh give the lord some praises people
[1:48:14] oh hallelujah hallelujah
[1:48:17] glory hallelujah
[1:48:19] amen
[1:48:21] brother branham almost through here this
[1:48:23] is quitting real good
[1:48:24] but about christmas god reveal christ is
[1:48:26] revealing one word if anybody
[1:48:27] misinterpret jesus christ in the bible
[1:48:29] of not being god himself make him the
[1:48:31] second person he says that this will
[1:48:33] upset every word in the entire bible
[1:48:36] it will break the first commandment
[1:48:38] though shall have no other god but
[1:48:39] before me
[1:48:40] he said now watch
[1:48:42] for jesus himself
[1:48:45] is the interpretation of the bible
[1:48:48] and he is made manifest in the age that
[1:48:51] the part of his body is being made
[1:48:54] manifest
[1:48:56] so even though he's a word
[1:48:57] we have to connect with what part of the
[1:49:00] body
[1:49:01] is being manifested
[1:49:03] because the feet and the legs and the
[1:49:06] chest is already taken up
[1:49:08] we come like the neck part
[1:49:11] and he is the head part
[1:49:13] and all the rest of the body is
[1:49:14] underground
[1:49:15] waiting for the voice of the
[1:49:17] resurrection even the trump
[1:49:19] to call them from the dead
[1:49:21] but i say that the voice of the
[1:49:22] archangel which is promised to come upon
[1:49:25] the bride
[1:49:26] which will bring on the intelligence
[1:49:28] to bring us to a place where you could
[1:49:31] see it
[1:49:32] because you have to see it before you
[1:49:33] possess it
[1:49:36] come on say amen somebody
[1:49:38] you have to see it
[1:49:40] before you possess it
[1:49:48] in other words you may be seated
[1:49:52] they didn't have the full seat all along
[1:49:54] and you can't bury pot seed
[1:49:56] saluta had part wesley had part all them
[1:49:59] fell as that part but a branham came to
[1:50:01] gather all the parts to present a whole
[1:50:04] seed
[1:50:05] which is the word
[1:50:07] so by the time he come on the scene son
[1:50:09] of man ready to unveil himself and the
[1:50:11] son of man is the sword of the seed but
[1:50:14] the seven areas gonna turn it come from
[1:50:16] eternity to guard up all this scattered
[1:50:18] wood all the loose ends and tie it back
[1:50:21] into the world to bring down the holy
[1:50:23] ghost
[1:50:24] but the holy ghost couldn't come out as
[1:50:26] holy ghost the holy ghost coming as
[1:50:27] promises and peter said by these
[1:50:30] promises we become partakers of the
[1:50:33] divine nature having escaped
[1:50:36] the corruption that is in the world to
[1:50:38] lust
[1:50:39] so for the escape ones we have these
[1:50:42] virtues to fight for
[1:50:44] the contempt for to press for
[1:50:47] oh hallelujah by one spirit
[1:50:51] we are baptized into that pyramid body
[1:50:54] amen
[1:51:00] oh my god
[1:51:02] i'm gonna finish missions can't please
[1:51:08] you don't receive the holy ghost to
[1:51:09] become seed
[1:51:11] brother branham
