out to believe the message of justification but unless somebody come and preach it there would no one be saved and how can a man preach unless he been sent so God had to have one sent from the Catholic church he couldn't find nobody he looked up he looked low he looked down but he needed a messenger oh to proclaim the day of the the um uh the word of the Lord for that day isn't that right so you went to the Catholic Church got a priest but the name of Martin Luther all the Bibles written in Latin so nobody knows what's going on but he is the only one who could read it he's the only one who can understand it and God predestinated Martin Luther to interpret the word for that day that the just should live by faith Hallelujah say Amen somebody oh not but the priest sprinkle on you not by 10 amens and our fathers but by faith the just shall live by faith oh Hallelujah and he shook the Catholic Church oh Hallelujah Wesley shook the church in his day the Pentecostal what about a bride

the spirit this morning I feel the atmosphere just got a little warmer this morning amen I didn't bring my thermometer but I could feel it praise God Amen Hallelujah so amen let's get to the word amen hallelujah amen so for a title this morning amen uh I have a title one taken one left that's my title this morning amen for inspiration I chose men and Brethren what shall we do to be saved amen what shall we do to be saved amen praise praise God so we read from Matthew 24 isn't that right Jesus talking about the end of the world and prior to that uh Jesus was blasting the Pharisees and the different ones the Hypocrites and so on in Matthew 23 and um after he was finished doing that the disciples they were walking around Jerusalem and Bible says that um they were showing the Lord great buildings in Jerusalem isn't that right they were they were sightseeing basically amen taking selfies and somebody had the I of Jerusalem t-shirt amen and they walking around with the caps and different things and you know taking pictures stuff like that doing a little tour and showing Jesus you know this is a building for this and this is this building and this is the national Treasury and everything else and they in that atmosphere amen they they're like tourists you know going around and seeing the different sites but Jesus wasn't in that atmosphere Bible says that while they were sightseeing Jesus said something to them that shook them he said uh uh he said to them he said you see all this here around you he said there shall not be one stone left here upon another that shall not be thrown down so Jesus was already the atmosphere of seeing oncoming destruction amen Jesus was seeing all of this Glitz and Glamour and popularity and money and economy and commerce and business he was seeing all of that one day coming to an end so he was never moved by it he was never moved by the proud he was never moved by the money and the popularity trying to get a big house on a fancy car that wasn't his motive that was not his objective because when he look around all he could see is the destruction that was about to take place they were looking at the big buildings the big houses and nice uh Splendor of the land as it were Amen in Jerusalem was a great City a long time ago but all of it was to come to not and Jesus knew that it was about to happen and when he spoke those words it shook the de deciples yes because they were not in that atmosphere as I said you know they were in a car of Flesh you know thing and you know going around you know how we are looking at different things that's nice oh I like that building I like that house but uh God wasn't in that frame of mind you see he was thinking on spiritual things he was building his hopes on things Eternal and that's how we ought to be praise God Amen sure it's how nice to have a nice house and a nice car but what's the end of it all praise God hallelujah isn't that right David said told the Lord one time said look how the wicked Prosper look how the Heathen uh advance and doing better and you know they they're getting better at what they do and they you know improving and God said have you considered an end one of these days it's going to come to an end all that had a beginning will come to an end one day isn't that right John say I saw a new Heaven John say I saw a new Earth the old Heaven and the old Earth was passed away and a new Heaven and a new Earth was for forged by fire Hallelujah and so too must your new heart this morning your new heart have to be forged by God's holy fire praise God Amen isn't that right Hallelujah the same fire praise God the world's looking for fire amen isn't that right uh uh the world looking for fire to to to cleanse itself because it's already gone through two processes of of of of of cleansing isn't that right water in the days of Noah isn't that right then Sanctified by the blood of Jesus when he came on the earth and and died for man kind but there's one more process left Hallelujah isn't that right it's a three-step process praise God to get back into God and the prophet identified water blood spirit so that Earth is waiting for fire Hallelujah isn't that right to cleanse it hallelujah praise God so that the righteous could touch down on it and take over and begin their reign isn't that right A Thousand Years isn't that right hallelujah hallelujah amen amen so so so too are we looking for fire this morning am we are looking for the fire of the Holy Spirit we are looking for the fire of the Holy Ghost to come and baptize our souls into the kingdom of God that's the only way to get in not by your intellect not what you can do praise God but what he has already done what he promised to do for you in this hour he promised praise God to come amen visit you Hallelujah according to the time of life with the Holy Ghost Hallelujah the same holy ghost that he received in the upper room he promis to send that same anointing that same holy spirit that same person of Jesus Christ Hallelujah to come by praise God and to anoint a people for his name's sake say Amen somebody amen [Applause] hallu amen so the disciples got shook upup they were looking at the present God was seeing the future isn't that right amen and then the disciples came to him and said they they asked him they said Lord When shall these things be you know and what about the ending of the Lord and ending of the the world and so forth isn't that right we got to ask different question because they were shaken amen shook them up amen they they got real concern all of a sudden all the time they were in the natural enjoying themselves and enjoying one another's company but something shook them off the the natural that's what we want to do this morning we want to we want to want the word to shake you out of the natural shake you into the spiritual things Hallelujah isn't that right all that had a beginning will have an end but you never had a beginning therefore you will never have an end Hallelujah isn't that right you come from God and if you come from God then you must be concerned about the things of God you must be about your father's business say Amen somebody hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah amen isn't that right so the word come to shake us sometimes amen sometimes it's hard sometimes it's a roughing up a while ago I I was traveling I traveled and I went to Pennsylvania and we driving back home in the car and we took a a specific uh road coming back uh one of those highways I don't know they have so many highways but um they they they on the road driving going back to New Jersey I think um on the road every about 5 10 minutes maybe 15 minutes there' be these bumps that you drive up on I don't know if any of you ever seen it that travel but um there's these bumps that you go on if you're driving down the road you driving on a long Highway sometimes there's no traffic lights or miles and um you know there's these bumps in the road that you drump drive over and you know I was asking somebody the shaeer person was driving me at the time I said well um I said what what are those bumps for and he said well that that's to wake you up sometimes you know you're driving for so long and people sometimes driving 2 3:00 in the morning 4:00 in the morning and they they get tired amen and and and it's it's a normal thing for people to get tired driving and so forth it's Amen it's it's aous a task at times but um just to wake you up a little bit they put those bumps in the road to shake up the car every time you drive over it it shakes up the car like that amen you're bound to wake up after that amen hallelujah it's not right well I feel sometimes along the road God has some bumps amen hallelujah God has some shaking praise God sometimes he does things to shake us up sometimes he brings situations to shake us up to shake us out of church natural Shake us into out of the church caral isn't that right Shake us into the spiritual realm Shake us into reality Hallelujah that they were not always going to be here all the time one day time will finish time we blend into eternity oh h no man knows the day or the hour so we have to be always watchful and every time you get to sleep Hallelujah every time you get a little lethargic every time you get a little lazy God shakes us up so I pray God shake you up this morning say Amen somebody I pray God wake you up this morning Hallelujah as we travel along this road amen amen amen hallelujah isn't that right so they were shaken up and they begin to ask questions said Lord what about the end of the world what what about all these things when will these things happen what will happen they were curious God began to talk to them and you know the scripture said perilous time shall come and talking about wars he talks about rumors of wars talked about famines pestilence earthquakes in diverse places beginning of Sorrows isn't that right all these things that are supposed to happen and supposed to come to pass when the son of man cometh isn't that right Hallelujah and many things that were supposed to happen amen uh but God gives us a Blessed Assurance isn't that right in spite of all these things the end is not yet Hallelujah Jesus said there will be famines pestilences Wars but the end is not yet in other words if you looking for the end of all things don't look to these things are supposed to happen that's not your sign praise God that's not the thing that you're supposed to be looking for that's not even thing that God's looking at all those things supposed to happen sure that's fine that's a wrath of God coming upon the Earth but God's concern is for the gospel to be preached God's concern is his word going out God has a concern for his people God has a burden for his people on his mind and though things supposed to happen though the Earth is supposed to be moved though the mountain supposed to be carried into the midst of the sea Hallelujah those all these things are supposed to happen but praise God this morning there is a river oh there's a river flowing out this morning streams of mercy and Grace this morning hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah great signs of the times great distress of Nations and we see it happening slowly slowly day by day Hall see the economy falling apart isn't that right I read in the news just before I came in there that the Ebola virus is mutating so whatever um antidote or you know uh whatever cure they have for it they have to start uh re looking at that now rehashing that because they they they you know the virus is now adapting to the V to the to the to the uh to the antidote is now adapting to that and it's now feeding on that and it's getting more powerful and they say they don't know what's going to happen over 22,000 people have already been infected you know and and this is just the beginning we haven't seen plagues and famines like what's coming upon the Earth but God promised Hallelujah that before those terrible plague strike that there be another people in the land who under their Messenger will be the final voice to the final age at the final

stop Satan in midair praise God hallelujah and send him back where he come from oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah am amen amen amen so that's what we're contending for this morning that's what we come to church for this morning cuz one day there won't be a church service there won't always be church we don't always have a place to go to amen is that right the prophet said they shut them down they shut down places like these and make them great storehouses isn't that right people have to meet in their homes and have prayer meetings and so forth uh brother Bram saw it coming to pass but he also saw a bride coming to Perfection he also saw a vision of a bride Marching In Step each one Marching In Step left right left right left right left oh Hallelujah say Amen somebody say Amen somebody Hallelujah marching and step with the word marching and step with the word of Malachi 4 Marching In Step praise God stay amen somebody so we're here to line up with the word this morning we have to line up with what God's requirements are to fulfill God's requirements isn't that right because the reality is and we always preach as though every one of you would be saved but the reality is want to be taken and want to be left that's how Jesus described a Rapture it's never a group it's not a whole bunch of people going in and we go in in a Rapture no no no it's one little sister over here one little brother over here who's adopted one little brother one little sister one little young man one little young girl but one will be taken one would be left that's the reality so get next to yourself this morning it's not a group ofair this is not a group issue one will be taken one will be left one will be taken praise God two in a field one taken one left two in a bed one taken and left watch and pray for you know not what day you don't know what hour say Amen somebody oh Hallelujah that's the reality that we face as ministers coming up here and preaching the word we hope that all will be saved but if you don't take the word and apply it then we're not responsible for that amen amen we're responsible to uh with charge responsibility to uh warn you praise God Amen of oncoming disaster we praise God by The Prophet's warning amen echoing those same words praise God hallelujah of Malachi 4 staying with that word warning the people he amen preaching the mysteries of God warning every man hallelujah amen amen but if you don't take the war warning if you don't take God's mercy Prophet said then you're right for judgment isn't that right oh my what an hour we living in isn't that right Hallelujah but this gospel must be preached Jesus said and then the end shall come in other words God's waiting on his gospel to be preached amen and then we could see about all the famines pestilences and wars and earthquakes and diverse places so don't let that be your main uh Focus praise God isn't that right but get concerned about the word get concerned about the gospel praise God get concerned about what God has for you because he has something for you this morning hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah isn't that right there's a requirement for you to make there's something that you have to do praise God there's something that you have to get ready for and how you get ready for it praise God is already revealed in the word the prophet already laid it out praise God isn't that right Apostolic Echo come back and uh uh re uh recycle the word back to us all the promises of Malachi for for this day isn't that right hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah so there's certain things that you need to know this morning amen and I hope we get to it by the grace of God this morning in the message praise God but there are certain things that you need to know amen how to get ready for a Rapture how to get ready for this wedding supper that we're about to go into praise God the New Millennium and all these things praise God hallelujah isn't that right there's a process there's a way to get in there isn't that right hallelujah hallelujah in the days of Israel isn't that right when they was ding through the Wilderness and Aaron was their priest wasn't is that right and they they would have the sacrifices every year and so on for the sins of the people and they would bring the Bullocks and The Oxen and the lamb and so on and they would kill it and so forth and you know the story uh the people had to be identified with their sacrifice each one brought their sacrifice isn't that right right Amen to to to for that was for the that was for the atonement of sin in that day and Aeron the priest after all that was finished Aaron the priest would have to go into to the holy place isn't that right but there's a certain way that he'd have to go in he can't walk in anyhow and Swinging his hand left or right or just have any kind of approach there was a certain approach to God isn't that right there was certain way that he had to go in Hallelujah isn't that right there was a certain reverence there's a certain resp that God wanted amen isn't that right there's a certain garment he was supposed to wear amen he was supposed to be anointed a certain way you're supposed to be smelling just right looking just right acting just right moving in the right step moving in the right directions so that the bells of his His Garment would ring holy holy unto the Lord and that's the way we ought to come to church that's the way we ought to approach God even in your private closet you're supposed to approach god with a certain reverence say Amen somebody a certain respects a certain amount of Holiness holy holy unto the Lord your life supposed to be vibrating holy holy unto the Lord amen isn't that right your life supposed to be living out something oh how vibrating something isn't that right a dog know when you love him he'll wag his tail and flick his asss back lick his

could feel that vibrating from off of you Hallelujah he could smell that coming from off of you how much God could smell your attitude this morning think about it now you're vibrating something this morning y y your attitude to the presence of God is vibrating something in the Supernatural your approach to God this morning is vibrating something more than your words could speak oh Hal isn't that right Hallelujah so you ought to be real careful hallelujah how we approach God how we approach the word cuz the real serious our friends is between you and God that's right hallelujah hallelujah when we come to the uh come to the Lord we don't come in a group we come one by one we come to the Lord isn't that right and we ask to be baptized according to acts 238 amen we come by ourselves there was nobody call you and bum you and try to press you and try to bring you into the message and try to push your head in it praise God you believe something in your heart registered amen and you know you wanted this thing you can't really put your finger on it but you know something about it is more real than what the world had to offer something about it was was was genuine something about it Hallelujah isn't that right oh my isn't that right the apostles when they uh were preaching Jesus and they were brought before the Pharisees for healing the lay man I think it was uh the Bible said that describe what the what the apostles shared with the Pharisees and so forth said that they were cut to the heart isn't that right the word was cut into the heart surely rebuked them told them not to preach in Jesus name but those men were on the word you couldn't shake them they were on the word and the Holy Fire of God was was vindicating the word on the spot with healing and and and Revelation and manifestation of the spirit my God we're going to come back to another book of Acts friends and God the holy spirit is going to manifest the word on the spot hallelujah hallelujah and that word is going to go beyond the bone beyond the marrow and cut to the heart oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah isn't that right 3,000 on the day of Pentecost will cut to the heart oh

Lord whole building was shaking people are screaming praise God they couldn't find enough Elbow Room praise God it was a holy ghost Revival it was the first Holy Ghost Revival taking place back there praise God isn't that right Hallelujah and they start to make a lot of noise the people outside are wondering what's going on we hearing people speaking in every language within this part amen it's not right begin to name it in the Bible there so many of them can remember how much tongues they were speaking in and many others oh Hallelujah they were all confused they were all wondering what were these drunk men doing Hallelujah up there staggering and getting on and lying down on the floor praise God and they was screaming holy ghost coming into their heart and burning demons out demons screaming in the Supernatural realm oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah my God Peter stood up on the day of Pentecost said these men are not drunk as you suppose but this is that which a prophet Joel spake of he took Joel's prophecy and by Revelation made it present tense by manifestation it was present tense it was happening right in front of them oh and that's what looking for in this hour the word of Malachi 4 to be made present tense reality to you by a manifestation of the spirit that is prophesied to follow the word you have heard the word long enough but it's time for the spirit now to come into your heart and make that word live oh hallelujah hallelujah isn't that right Hallelujah isn't that right brother George Kangle God bless you you preach a wonderful service in a prayer meeting Thursday T night amen if you're missing these prayer meetings I don't know you're missing a mouthful amen but he preached some wonderful things and one of the things he said was that uh you can't take your seed and present it to God and say look I got a seed and uh this is all I have and this is what God gave me no no no no no where's the fruit where is the end product God don't want to see uh uh what well I I believe you know but what have you done since you believe whatever you receive since believe behold I come quickly and my reward is with me to give every man according to his work isn't that right so according to what you have done with the message of Malachi 4 so shall you receive your reward isn't that right and the Bible says he's coming quickly so if he's coming quickly then what situation are you in this morning what state are you in this morning what have you done with the prophet's message how long has a Prophet come to the Earth oh how long has he preach a message oh how long will we be slack concerning his promises oh say Amen somebody oh it's time to wake up friends it's time to get to amen inter action what we see ought to make a church that will make a Revival or to put every soul into action didn't the prophet say that well say [Applause] amen hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah what are we doing with the word what are we doing with the message oh Hallelujah we have to get ourselves ready God is fixing the break in a way that we've never seen before the prophet talk about another ananas and saf and a few of them oh is that right if that's going to happen then what's your heart's condition this morning oh you begin to check yourselves now in the mirror of the word and see if you match up with these things here hallelujah and if not then you're lacking something then you need something oh Hallelujah and it comes by the Holy Ghost it comes by an experience it comes by the anointing coming upon your soul upon your life oh H comes about that three-step process water blood spirit amen amen amen oh my hallelujah hallu hallelujah amen amen amen so all these things are predicted to come to pass according to scripture isn't that right we have no control over that California is going to sink we know that it's going to happen people not even Church they don't even believe Perman they know that California is going to sink go look at it on YouTube man there people saying you know that the God spoke to them different things but you know it's going to happen it's it's bound to happen see um amen it's not right we have no control over those things but what we do have control over is what we can do to get ready for the coming of the Lord amen isn't that right Hallelujah and brother W said made a state statement I think it was one of Sundays ago he said what are you prepared to do for this revival that's a shaking statement because no Revival came like in a bed of ease as it was isn't that right there's no Revival I just come by people just you know coming to church and paying tides and Lolly and along oh there's no revival going to come that way no no you have your part to play something you have to do about it oh hallelujah what you expect is what you are going to get nothing less amen hallelujah and that amen isn't that right what you put in is what you're going to get out what you invest is what you're going to what returns you're going to get from your investment isn't that right Prophet preach a message on investments isn't that right my Prophet preach many things huh talk about Investments isn't that right whatever you invest in praise God you're going to get Returns on that investment hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah what what you give is what you're going to get back amen amen in order to make the profit investment you have to do your background check isn't that right and see if it's a good investment or not see if it's a viable choice or not isn't that right oh my praise God hallelujah amen amen so it's an individual Affair isn't that right all right so let me read this quote here I want to emphasize what I was saying earlier uh from God of this evil age amen here's a prophet early in the message speaking he says very strange to think that in an evil age like this that God then would be calling his bride isn't that right said did you notice he said a people not a church now listen to this real carefully I love how he breaks it down I'll read it real slow he said a people not a church why yet it's called a church but he would call a people amen now a church is a gathering of many people of all different makeups but God is calling listen to this but God is calling one here he didn't say I call Methodist group or the Baptist Pentecostal he said he'd call a people what for his name see a people one from the Methodist one from the Baptist one from the Lutheran one from the Catholic see but he's calling not a church group but a people for his name oh hallelu so there's one over here amen here's my spirit flowing freely I can find one over there I could use him I could use her there's my spirit flowing freely all God needs is one this morning oh say Amen somebody one

action oh hallelujah hallelujah praise God say Amen somebody oh one person maybe you inside of here this morning maybe you could be that one I don't know but it depends on your attitude whatever

be one person say Amen somebody give God a shout of Praise oh hallelujah oh I feel the Holy Spirit on that this morning my God give God praise this morning give God worship this morning one person

she told herself something isn't that right she spoke to herself she didn't have a minister she didn't go to her church oh hallelujah hallelujah but she had a lot of money and she was spending it spending it spending it but all of a sudden it started to wither away all the Dr bills Hallelujah wasn't adding up because nothing was being done about a condition H she had a blood issue and she needed something she wanted something from the Lord but she was only one person oh H but that was a majority in God that was just enough say Amen somebody this is not a two-legged race this is not a three-legged race praise God say Amen somebody all you need is one don't need nobody on your left on the right trying to slow you down no no no no no all you need is one person in here this morning the Holy Ghost pours out on individuals who want God hallelujah oh hallelujah hallu oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah say Amen somebody she wanted something she recognized she needed something she needed a healing something that the doctors couldn't give if some that the Physicians it was beyond their power it was beyond their control but there was a God who was in control and she wanted to contact that God but there was no way on the earth to find him there was no access throne but then all of a sudden she heard a message that a messiah was on the earth she heard a message about a man who could heal the sick who could raise the dead and who could cast out devils and that woman told herself something oh she began to speak to herself David said I encourage myself she told herself praise God if I could just touch if I could just touch the ham of his ging I shall be made whole say Amen somebody oh she told herself that she convinced herself that it wasn't a promise in the Bible it was just her Fai moving in the atmosphere Rippling out oh and as soon as she said it here come hell to try to stop that woman but she had already overcome in her mind in her mind she had already touched Jesus she was only about to get started but God was going to do and if you could only get started this morning say Amen somebody God will do the rest Give the Lord a shout of [Applause] Praise oh Hallelujah Hallelujah she told herself something she convinced herself today was the day she was not going another day with this Blood issue she was fed up she was frustrated with her condition she Hallelujah there was only going to be one taken and one left and she wanted to be the one taken she was not going to be settled to just be left behind oh Hallelujah she was desperate she was willing to do whatever it took to get what she needed oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah there's a time for apologies there's a time to say excuse me but this wasn't that time see amen somebody there's a time to get a Hallmark card and apologize but your attitude but this wasn't that time she was desperate she was willing to do whatever she push past this brother she pushed past this sister the Bible said there was a great press Around Jesus but she had a greater press oh H to get to him cuz she needed something from the Lord oh how many need something this morning how many see themselves as that woman this morning oh I want you to identify yourself with the word and if you see yourself as that woman this morning say Amen oh hallelujah hallelujah how many want to press their way this morning oh he is a rewarder he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him seek the Lord seek his face ever [Applause] more oh give God a shout of Praise oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah wherever Jesus was going she interrupted the journey she interrupted the service that day however things were supposed to flow it wasn't flowing no more because somebody interacted praise God on a supernatural level she didn't speak any words but she did something that changed the course of action Jesus was going in a certain direction everybody was following him all of a sudden he stopped he turned around and asked disciples said who touched me oh that's something you just think about that for a second everybody is around Jesus taking pictures of Jesus asking him to sign the autograph all of a sudden he stop who touched me disciples say everybody touching it what are you talking about he said no this is a different touch some people touching because they want fame oh some people touching because they want popularity they want to be seen with Jesus of Nazareth but this woman was touching for a different purpose she was touching for a different cause is there not a cause oh let's go up at once this morning oh hallelujah hallelujah oh my so as he passes You by you this morning you reach out and touch him and tell me if you don't feel a holy spirit tell me if something don't happened to you from this day on you reach out and touch him your faith gives you the ability to reach up and grab Jesus while he's passing by oh oh hallelujah oh my oh my oh my the supernatural world is real friends that woman was not acting in the natural in the natural somebody would look at that crowd and say I'm not bothering that with that that's a waste of time why bother talking about hundreds of people around Jesus I don't know they got the memo or something that Jesus was going to pass by and everybody was there but she changed because of her attit she changed the way things were supposed to be and and the way human concept would see it she wasn't seeing it that way she she was seeing things in a supernatural level she was seeing that there was a possibility that that there was a possibility that that baby part fure the Lord would pass by me one day that that this day could be the day that that Hallelujah she was seeing herself healed she was seeing herself walking free and she was seeing herself moving Hallelujah the way she used to move and jumping the way she used to jump and shout and the way she used to shout and oh Hallelujah my it's amazing what one person can do oh Hallelujah God works with individuals he always has isn't that right okay let me finish this quote here one from the Methodist one from the Baptist one from the Lutheran one from the Catholic see but he's calling church not a church group but a people for his name that receives his name engaged in his name going to a wedding to be married to him to become part of him see by predestination said just as a man chooses a right wife in this life was ordained to be part of his body he said so that is the bride of Christ will be and is now from old ordained by God to be part of that body amen isn't that right so you're predestinated to be part of that body oh Hallelujah hallelu you have to see yourself that way amen it's important how you see yourself in this service because one is going to be taken and one is going to be left that's the reality praise God you make up your mind which one you want to be this morning Hallelujah Hal I'm not responsible for that choice the pastor's not responsible for that choice the ministry is not responsible for that choice you are responsible Hallelujah for the attitude and action you take concerning God's word isn't that right amen amen praise God hallelujah where am I at here amen do you love him Hallelujah one taken one left isn't that right okay praise God let me SK over this quote here now talking about adoption and uh just want to read this here I think it I think it fits right in here with what I'm trying to see uh said the church is supposed to be predestinated isn't that right unto the adoption of children you know this quote said where a man a man see God can take a man and adopt him into the family not a group it's adoption is not a group thing forget about it takes one over here set some aside Hallelujah let your pants legs be bagged at the knees praise God and you set your eyes toward Heaven that God takes you over to the side not the group you over to the side a man a woman somewhere and adopts him gives him something isn't that right said adopt him in the family see and give him something that said first try that and see if it's right amen so the Bible said try the spirits this man claims a certain thing this person say claims this uh claims certain things said try it see if it's right said and if it's a if it's if it's as right move right with it then say Lord send us something else keep moving see said just keep moving say every fellow take his place look how he put this here now said every fellow take his place in words every individual person take their place then then what happens after that then you're going to see the Church of God begin to get into its place so the church can only get into its place when every fellow takes his place that's a church it's made up of every fellow that's taken his place in Christ isn't that right oh my Hallelujah see so that's what the church is it's made up of individuals isn't that right who have taken their stand isn't that right who've taken their place in Christ see that's when that's when the Philistines will go to backing up the shorts will go off hair will grow down faces will be washed cigars will be missing why because we're not trying to push nobody to to be holy and to come to church on time no you're doing that because you take your place isn't that right when you take your place you do the things of God isn't that right nobody had to beg it to worship beg you to praise God beg you to come on time beg you to pay a tights beg it to contribute to the church or nothing my God you want to do these things because you love the Lord and you want to see God's people amen be blessed and so forth isn't that right oh my isn't that right see that's right that's when the church begin to get into its Mighty power when they have an ananus and saf and a few of them a few of them talk about another book of Acts that was a scary thing back then to see that isn't that right here it was everybody was selling the the land and so forth and you know doing what they could uh to the church and so on and these people coming to church lying write down a sum of money that uh was false and God killed them on the spot because he wanted to keep the church pure he loved the church he couldn't have the church in that kind of condition when people coming there lying and doing what they want to do what kind of skull dogly and underhanded money no no no God couldn't have it in the church so he cut it off one time cuz he alone knew what was in their heart and Peter amen Peter didn't know but Peter was in communication with the Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit the Unseen a the secret service agent knew what was in their heart he was very visible in the room as anybody else that was there so he knew what they were saying knew what they were lying whispered to Peter Peter said you come think you're lying to me I'm a human being you didn't lie to me you lied to the Holy Ghost oh Hallelujah one day it's going to turn over to the Holy Ghost hallah Hallelujah you think it a Man In a Pulpit but be the Holy Ghost the pill of fire adopted veil in the son of man speaking Hallelujah in a Son of God speaking isn't that right oh my hallelujah hallelujah Bible said after that no man added himself to the church after that nobody was walking in to service just because they wanted a place to go to on a Sunday no no no it was a different place then brother that was a scary Church brother that God is in that building brother you better come real or don't come at all you better come heart with a true heart or don't come at all don't even bother to put on your clothes if your heart not right with God it was that kind of church amen but the Bible said the Lord added to the church as such as we be saved isn't that right so predestinated seeds was going in there not just any old Wishy Wash jellyfish praise God Christian in and out praise God lukewarm no no no no no it was genuine Believers people who wanted it people who needed it people who recognized God people who rever and respected God respected the Holy Spirit did their onethird and they were blessed praise beyond measure amen amen praise God they weren't afraid to do their part for the kingdom okay let me finish this here another ananas and saf and a few of them huh how we what kind of condition we ought to be in think about it amen as I read said yes sir you'll see when that Holy Church stands together in it power positionally placed as sons of God adopted into the family of God powerful Church standing there in its Glory oh that's what he's coming for oh Hallelujah he's coming amen he's coming for that kind of a church amen he loves to see that order and discipline my everybody in their place Hallelujah isn't that right the disciples in their place because they were in a place on the day of Pentecost they became apostles who were once Disciples of Jesus who once follow followers of Jesus the pill of fire come into them and made them leaders made them Fishers of Men just as Jesus told them in the beginning the Holy Spirit Come and made them leaders of the church even Ministers of the word of the Gospel oh Hallelujah isn't that right amen the holy the pillar of fire did that now they weren't self-appointed Apostles my they were appointed by the pillar of fire to go out and preach the word cast out Devils heal the sick isn't that right amen that's what it's going to be amen that's what the that's what the prophet said amen amen my praise God so my God I feel these this hour I feel this hour like we like we are Defenders of the faith this morning amen I feel like we're defending Malachi Force message praise God hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah we're defending the word in this hour Hallelujah guarding it praise God Hallelujah from all kind of interpretation people coming in trying to say what they want to say amen hallelujah but God's word will be made manifest God could only anoint his word not 99 and 910 but the full word of it oh Hallelujah you have to be identified with it identified with the sacrifice Hallelujah identified with the death identified with the resurrection oh Hal we identified with it this morning oh how many identified with the Lord this morning hallelujah amen my defendant of the faith huh I like that amen might preach that a message sometime amen well amen it sounds good I don't know um Witnesses here I want to read this here quick before I move on uh here's a prophet talking about Witnesses said in the court there's two kind of witnesses that'll stand that's eye or air he said now if you're sitting in a room and you look through a glass and you see an accident he said your witness he said your word is no good because you were looking through a glass said you have to be right there close to really know what you're talking about see before you can be a witness you have to hear it or you have to see it before you can be a witness on a severe case in the courts you can't say Miss so and so told me amen or Mr so and so or Reverend so and so told me he's a witness but you're not so therefore no man can exactly witness to the resurrection of Christ only by the Holy Spirit isn't that right Amen to make you the right kind of witness isn't that right you have to be a personal witness yourself being there Hallelujah knowing something about it knowing what you're talking about amen isn't that right and he said and God help us to see that day that when men will just be what uh will be just what they are he said you know I'm saying this now with all respects he said it isn't our city full of bootleg joints that's hurting us he said here's what's hurting us more than ever he said his people who are professing to be Christians are not living like it that's he said that's the thing see they're not a correct witness they can't witness until they have an experience and when they have an experience then they become a witness automatically Hallelujah because they're born again hallelujah amen isn't that right Hallelujah comes back to what comes back to what brother Isaac was saying that Sunday amen we do things with the young people to try to encourage them but it takes an experience Amen to really keep you in this hour it takes an experience with God you have to say that you felt him that you felt his presence that you know what it's about that you felt the glory you felt the power isn't that right you remember the Terence over I remember he was sharing with the young people one time he said about how he received the Holy Ghost he said one day brother William Hugh Williams I think came to him and began to testify to him is that right about how he received the Holy Spirit in a in a in a meeting one time and the way brother Terry said the way that he began to impress how this glory and power come upon him oh but the ter over begin to get thirsty about it he began to get concerned about it there was something vibrating off brother Hugh Williams that he had never seen before there was a glory on his face there was a difference in his walk there was a difference in his talk there was something moving it was real for him it was real to him he felt the fire he told him what he felt he said you got to experience it too amen and by faith but uh but the ter over received amen the holy Spirit also isn't that right amen Jun the 1980s isn't that right hallelujah amen and that's what it has to be it has to be genuine it has to be you got into contact with something even the pillar of fire you felt that power go into inside of you and burn the demons out burn the lust out burn the thoughts out the prophet said examine your life what were you before he said what were you after he said what changed since you believed what changed since you received that Holy Spirit of promise H isn't that right he said if you're still flying off the handle if you still have temper tantrums you haven't got it yet you have to go back and get it praise God you've got it to get isn't that right but you're nothing until you receive that Holy Spirit of promise you haven't even got started yet isn't that right Hallelujah but it is to them that obey him oh the holy spirit is given to those to them that obey him isn't that right isn't that right Jesus said he that loveth me keepeth my Commandments and it is he that Lov that me and he shall be loved of the father Jesus said he will the father will come to him the father will manifest myself you said I will manifest myself to him to the group no to him the individual who who believe God the individual who stayed with the word the individual who didn't compromise who didn't turn to the left who didn't turn to the right amen amen it's the attitude that you have sir the Tre Hebrew boys had an attit they were not going to bow down to no Idol to No Man's interpretation to nothing that them brothers were saying doing speaking praying they didn't have nothing to do with that they said we not identified with that we identified with God and if God don't deliver us we still not Bo down say Amen somebody that's the attitude if God don't give me the Holy Ghost I'll be right here you find my bones here but I'm not going to bow down I'm not going to back down I'm not going back to what I used to do to who I used to be oh Hallelujah you got to make up your mind to burn the bridges behind you we're not going back we're going forward forward forward into the adoption of sons say Amen somebody amen amen [Applause] hallelujah when they have an experience then they become a witness automatically because they're born again and all of the things of the world old things have passed away and all things have become new then you become a witness unto Jesus isn't that right Jesus knew before the apostles could ever go out and be a correct witness that they had to experience what they were witnessing about isn't that right Hallelujah wouldn't that be nice today he said if every Seminary did the same thing if every Christian did the same thing would just come to church and say now I'm accepting Jesus as my personal Savior and I'm going to stay right here till I get the baptism of the Holy Ghost and then I'm going out to be a witness amen see things would be different don't you think so he said we wouldn't have that those loose scattered testimonies isn't that right up one day and then down the next and then they out of church and then they in a church Church in the church is that right loose C testimonies said people testify and then say they're Christian and then go out and live other lives and the unbeliever comes in and sees that and he say well look at that there is that the way they go and see and the devil always points them out too isn't that right see it SCS the face of the church isn't that right of the true Christianity amen people live any kind of a life Hallelujah isn't that right and then claim to be Christians we want to be the right kind of Christian Hallelujah he how many you want to be the right kind of Christian this morning a real Christian is a holy ghost filled oh Hallelujah anointed person praise God walking in the spirit led by the spirit of God you're not relying on your own thoughts lean not unto your own understanding praise God hallelujah but you're leaning on the Everlasting Arms leaning on the Holy Spirit leaning on God whatever God want to do you do it if God to don't do it don't you touch it over you stay with that word stay with that anointing H until God lead you the footsteps of the righteous are ordered of the Lord oh isn't that right and if they ordered of the lord it's impossible for you to fall it's impossible for you to fail isn't that right hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah one time a a man asked me he was a young man he went to University with me yeah and he was he was a he was an ex- witch he used to he used to be in Witchcraft and stuff so he was asking me about God I was testifying to him about the Lord and um he said you know Anthony tell me something he said what what you know who is God and stuff like that he said why would God allow all these bad things to happen people get raped murdered killed every day said people lie and cheat and steal he said why it is it that people do those things he said has God forsaken us I said God hasn't forsaken us said it's we who forsake God said if we follow God and do the things he said do we'd never have these things isn't that right see he was seeing it you know one way like you know God just let people do whatever they want to do but that was it see because God had laws God had principles to live by God had Commandments God had the Bible and everything laid out for man to follow Amen in his truth and his righteousness and we are living in a day now where it is impossible for you to say that you don't know you can't say that because there's the internet there's everything made available for you to find out who you are what your purpose is what you're here on this life to do say Amen somebody so there no excuse in this age that you're living in there's no excuse for you to say that you don't know that's not a word don't even say that because everybody's supposed to know everybody ought to know who Jesus is say Amen somebody the internet has no password we have no username no login so you can walk in and listen to any tape you want to praise God because it's free all who whosoever will let him come hallelujah hallelujah there's no excuse there's no excuse I heard a preacher say one time talking about souls on the altar said they were crying out how long Lord how long long till you restore unto us isn't that right Souls crying out on the altar the preacher went on to say he said how are you he said I would like to stand in the day of judgment and look people in the eye and see God ask ask them what kept you from being the right kind of Christian what kept you from being the right kind of a Believer he'd like to ask him say your job your family your home what what what what your car your personal interest what is it that kept you from being from living the life that you're supposed to live what is it that hindered you from from from doing what you were supposed to do what is it that kept you from the presence of God what is it what is it he say explain it to me I'd love to see someone explain it because he said there was no excuse amen God made every available way for man to be saved isn't that right but he's still going to he's going to take one and he's going to leave one hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah Hall so you make up your mind today which one you are going to be but there one going to be taken and one is going to be left praise God brother sister I

they were slain aund slain by the edge of the sword and they wandered in sheep skins and goat skins they were destitute Afflicted tormented it's a big word some of us feel tormented by our jobs and some fickle things but but they they went through real pain and suffering how you going to tell those what kind of testimony you have for those men what kind of testimony you have for guys who had

Moses doing his ordinary thing but in God's mind he was already chosen God pulled him out God give him a burning bush experience God put something in his soul when he came back from that experience

so simple words simple words but but but but they didn't know the power that was behind that God was ready to contest that what Moses spoke he was willing to back that up because the hour of Deliverance was come the hour of Deliverance was here there was no more delay there was no more keep back for 400 years they was in that condition and God had enough of it the people begin to cry out to God and when God remembered his promise when God remembered his people Israel when God remembered the words Hallelujah there was a time for the deliverance and that time had come around and that season had roll around oh Hallelujah and Moses was in his place Aaron was in his place oh H let the plague strike but the people were going to be delivered oh hallelujah hallelujah and there is

hallelujah oh Hallelujah isn't that right so the pillar of fire isn't that right is waiting to come up upon individuals isn't that right oh Hallelujah isn't that okay let me see somebody here real quick I have a quot here I read before I get into this part here and then that's it amen hallelujah okay here's a prophet he said I've never been ashamed and God help he said to always be man enough to stand up and speak my convictions amen isn't that right he said for if I'm not he said I would be a traitor to Christ he said but I believe here's a prophet I love this he said I believe in the old fashion baptizing of the Holy Ghost he said I believe that a man has got to be born again or he is still a sinner I believe it's only through the grace of God that he's called of the Holy Ghost he said and if we don't receive the Holy Ghost by we do not oh he said we do not receive the Holy Ghost by faith believing he said but it's a free gift of God a free gift of God given to us by God's grace oh Hal that's God's grace to you it's a gift Hallelujah that he has for you to them that believe him to them that obey his words oh Hal he promised the gift of the Holy Ghost to you praise God hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah pray isn't that right isn't that right he promised the Holy Spirit that's right he said that that's where I different with my own church but R said the church I come from was a Baptist Church he said they said that you received the Holy Ghost when you believe he I he said I said that's contrary to the Bible Paul said in Acts 19 he asked those Baptist up there that was following Apollos he said have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe not when you believe it but since you believe it you believe first but then the holy and the Holy Ghost is the gift of God see that comes to you said it's different he said here alog together different from being saved and being called out in God oh oh it's another spirit with you oh isn't that right Hallelujah hallelu is not good enough to be baptized according to acts 2day you have to receive that gift of the Holy Spirit Hallelujah that completes the process in God oh hallelujah hallelujah Hal said amen he's still a sinner isn't that right until he's born again oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah and the true born again isn't that right by the baptism of the Holy Ghost and Fire hallelujah amen isn't that right Hallelujah said uh it comes to you it's a different here alt together from being saved from being called out in God see now therefore you will you have to see said I believe that man's Spirit was made uh before all the natur all the all the supernatural was made before the natural isn't that right he said all the supernatural was made before the natural he said I believe that everything in the natural line Works in harmony or should work in harmony with the spiritual he said in other words like this he said when a baby is born when a person is born of the Spirit uh ministers he said there's three elements that come from the body of Christ to make up the spiritual body of Jesus do you believe that he said water blood and spirit he said that's what come out of his body is that true well that's just exactly the elements it takes it takes to go through to to get into his his body is that right the elements that the elements that constitutes the new birth three elements water blood and spirit amen amen hallelujah hallelujah isn't that right so you come out you get baptized amen hallelujah your body goes into the water isn't that right Hallelujah but then the blood part is what you do about it that's the sanctification part hallah that's the part that you do that's when you pray up that's when you get your life right with God that's when you go to praying and go to crying out and seeking the Lord that's when you applying the word to your to your daily life hallelujah hallelujah amen isn't that right Paul said I Die daily Hallelujah not on a Sunday not on on a Thursday night when you have prayer meeting don't over every day you're dying out you're dying out dying out to yourself applying the blood hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah until his Holy Spirit come until you in the right kind of an atmosphere to receive his Spirit isn't that right you have to be like Cornelius isn't that right devout just amen prayed up waiting on God Waiting for God looking for God to come down in any way that he means to come down oh Hallelujah Cornelius was just one man but he was praying he had a right kind of an attitude he had a right kind of an approach he had a right kind of motive he had a right kind of an objective he knew what he wanted oh and he was praying for it he was looking for it he didn't know when he didn't know what hour oh Hallelujah but he was praying he was in the spirit he was under the anointing oh Hallelujah he was standing in a gap for his family he was standing in a gap for his household he was putting them ever before the the Lord he was giving his arms he was paying his tith is not right he was keeping the law he was giving to the poor oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah then all of a sudden God spoke to Cornelius and said go and send for Peter send your servant man go let him send for Peter and God loves to burn the candle on both ends while God is working on put cornelius's side a word come to Peter while Peter

of all kind of weird stuff don't Peter to go and eat and Peter said these things are uncommon we can't eat them God said don't don't amen don't have that attitude amen change your mindset change your approach because there's some man I want you to pray for there's something I want you to do God was leading his son by the spirit not all of a sudden when the Visions was finished oh there was a knock on the door just so the precise time and moment oh hallelujah hallelujah those men had sent for Peter to go pray for Cornelius and Peter was led on The Holy Spirits he come now to cornelius's house and begin to speak the word and begin to speak the word and then all of a sudden the fire of the Living God how come and confirm the word that was laying in cornelius's heart oh he was waiting on the Lord waiting on his promise waiting on the Holy Spirit oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh isn't that right isn't that right isn't that right oh come down to a personal experience come

I'll take away his Sony heart and give you a a new heart and now the heart is the dwelling place of the Holy Spirit and I'll give you a new spirit I want you to watch the order now many uh people get mixed up there he said they think they got the Holy Ghost but they just got a new spirit he said watch I'll give you a new heart and a new spirit and then this is the third part now he said I'll put my spirit he said now the new spirit God had to give you a new spirit because that's a new spirit and God give you so you could get along with the Holy Ghost without old Spirit you had you couldn't get along with your neighbor you couldn't get along with yourself so you know you couldn't get along with God so God gives you a new spirit and many times under enthusiasm he said and if you watch the life that it Bears uh he said he said uh a lot of times you think that you'd have the Holy Spirit he said oh said I sung I spoke in tongues certainly being that close to it you might do all of that

intellectual everything agreeing right into the middle of the wheel what God says he said if the days of Miracles um if Jesus is the same yesterday and forever he said the holy Spirit would bear record with that you can begin to stand he said and every intellectual move of yours will say the same thing and when you have these little temper fits and you fly out and you tell lies and you proelite and you jump the fences and you're so selfish with your organization and you're so narrow-minded that you couldn't hear another Minister just remember the Holy Spirit isn't ticking inside of you he said I didn't know I was going to say that but I but that's that's right see he said the holy spirit will make every movement like Christ it will make you Christlike the fruits of the spirit is
