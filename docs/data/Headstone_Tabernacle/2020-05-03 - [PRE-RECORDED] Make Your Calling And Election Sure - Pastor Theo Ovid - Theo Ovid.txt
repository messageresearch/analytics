greetings in Jesus name water convention amen still basking I've never it has been really something else that annoy to keep stayin and remaining that's something so I believe we're moving at a new season and likely the tweener Bibles to first Peter chapter one and second Peter chapter one tanky musicians praise the name of the Lord I told her I was gonna have Isaac to say a few words before I come on on the convention but today is on the oven making great music we glad appreciate the musicians and we appreciate you the believers for making what we see possible by the grace of God so we want to look at first Peter chapter one and we want to read verse 1 and 2 Peter an apostle of Jesus Christ to the strangers catapult Pontus Galatia Cappadocia Asia and Bithynia elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father through sanctification of the spirit unto obedience and sprinkle the blood of Jesus Christ grace unto you and peace be multiplied second Peter one wanna read from verse 1 11 Simon Peter a servant an apostle of Jesus Christ them that have obtained watch like precious feet with us to the righteous of God on our Savior Jesus Christ grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and of the cheese's our Lord according as his divine power had given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that has called us to glory and virtue whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these he might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that has we'll true lust and besides this given all diligence add to your faith virtue and to virtue knowledge and knowledge temperance and to temperance patience and to patience godliness and to godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity for if these things be in you and abound they make you that you shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ but he that lacketh these Tings is blind cannot see afar off and not forgotten that he was purged from his old sins wherefore the rather brethren give diligence to make your calling and election sure for if you do these things he shall never fall for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ may God bless his word you may be seated praise the Lord amen is always a blessing to be in the presence of God in the house of God amen and it's good to be here this morning praise God so we had the services representation by predestination but a Peter Chandler we are certainly appreciate that Moses in your individual inheritance but Isaac ovid but a gesture of little the eternal church age at the end of the seals praise God honor Eamon Thompson the Bride of Christ is God's eternal thoughts made manifest but uh Hulu Astor who load the evening and morning were the first day and but a John Conte the spoken word is the original CD I want you to note how deep even the titles are in terms of presenting to the bride that's nothing do it church your convention is have to do with a bride elect isn't that right and you have to possess your individual inheritance because you have representation by predestination you don't have to play shy and whatnot no and you are predestined that are eternal Church age at the end of the seal and you have to know that you are bored eternal thoughts isn't that right and God is bringing you back to that first day the evening in the morning with the first day and that is back to the eighth day that is back to eternity praise God on what's inside of you is your original seed the spoken word and all those who laugh and mock at us because we caught in from the Prophet one day they're gonna realize that you are we receiving original word which was the spoken word not an interpretation or explanation of what the Prophet said but just what the Prophet said was seated on into you no wonder the Holy Spirit told the Prophet right the secret is the word is in the bride that mean they had to have ministries pouring the seer the Lord into you I am NOT a prophet I don't have the say the Lord William Branham is a prophet he was that Elisha and we said the words of that Elisha and echo it to you Oh blessed be the name of the Lord he was a messenger to call a bride for Isaac Currie say Amen William Branham was Ellie Eliezer to call a bride for Isaac who is Isaac the mighty angel of revelation 10 brings God first Thessalonians 4 the Lord Himself sees and remember with a shout God wasn't taking chances in his last day he didn't send an angel he said I myself will come down to call my bride oh praise God you wanna call my a man you don't call by a system you not call by a church you are called beyond that I am the call by a man so romantic put his hands on me I am free from the hands of man you are caused by that mighty angel from revelation 10:1 or plural of God you believe that hallelujah so my title comes with a burden behind it it's make your calling and election sure confirm your calling confirming lection don't just take for granted your salvation don't take for granted in the bride here in the message don't take that for granted make your calling and election sure get it confirmed then you cannot be defeated but you cannot be fought for because you know you're part of God's eternal thoughts that was in the back part of his name man hallelujah and I'm an inspiration called by the seven thunders of Revelation 10 the elected bride only she could hear that call and the subject elect according to the foreknowledge of God that's the script every read and Peter we not elected because we come to this church you're not elected because it gets saved and they get baptized in Jesus name you're elected based upon the foreknowledge of God the foreknowledge of God is what calls you you should rejoice right now in that you could show right now just and that alone no man can interrupt the foreknowledge of God that elected you don't man can interrupt that ok vanilla salt appraised Oh hallelujah praise God amen all right please God for whom he did foreknow he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he Jesus might be the firstborn among many brethren so his foreknowledge isn't that right brick make way for his predestination because he foreknew you he could predestinate you despite your smoke and drinking food in a row that didn't stumble him that didn't fight in God but wasn't upset or get goggle hores in his mind it was already done in the back part of his mind it's not right your election was already done and the comforta fulfil it on the earth then as your faith increase in your elective quality of in God Oh hallelujah then you could truly embrace Romans 8:28 so we know all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are the called hallelujah you have to know your have been called according to his purpose Oh glory to God amen but a Branham from an old money without price I heard all their beloved pastor but never make a remark on his television reader cast yet in the morning and just went over and over my mind I just can't forget it I quoted it to a friend of mine last night and that it was this after the taken away of the Holy Spirit out of the it this is not if this is after it will be done after the Holy Spirit is taken out of the earth that former church religion will go right on not knowing the difference how many hate that but Branham speaking that wasn't that a strong them they don't know the Holy Spirit so they won't know when it's gone and they will just be going on just the same and when the last one here we go is sealed into the body of Christ not a church that's the body of Christ [Applause] they will be still going on trying to bring converts to it because they don't know what it is and their formal religion will continue on just like there were no it may not sink into you like it did to me but that was an Estonian statement that there be so far away in religious rituals until they will not miss the Holy Spirit because they don't know what it is to begin with so you've got to know this Holy Spirit you got to know this comforter but a Branham continued and God have mercy on us brother I would like to live in this life is in my desire till if even the least bit of his grieving I know it in my heart if I should do something that would grieve him I'd be able to feel it just in a moment let alone his absence he was blessing God to get conviction that if he grieving the spirit if he feeling conflicted or what that it will be reaching him he don't want to be insensitive to the Spirit of God he want to be sensitive to the Spirit of God he said if I would do something would grieve him I believe in to feel it just in a moment see let alone his absence I don't want to be here when he's not here I want to be gone then there are the normal blood on the mercy seat it'll be dark smoky and black this sanctuary will have no lawyer to plead our case at that time you know the scripture say the Santeria or smoking there was no blood on the mercy seat then it is Dutchman there is so many entertaining entertainment things in our days there are so many things to entice people to what we call pleasures and it's all peoples and all ages their enticement for young people modern dances rock'n'roll parties and music that goes with it it's all enticing I don't care good a home a child is brought up how would it been taught to the right if that child hasn't accepted the experience of the new belt rock'n'roll catches attention as quick as he hears it because it is in him and is born in in my Eternal Spirit and the power of the devil is so great today till it catches the spirit of that little one that's why you're gonna turn to waste you have time to pray pray for your children and get a burden not to get the baptism of the Holy Ghost praise God you believer and how much more will it do they all then that has rejected in your birds because only as your life is changed and you have been converted and born anew into the kingdom of God your nature will still be of the king of the world no matter how religious you are that's why coming to church doesn't change people saying how the spoke word book doesn't change people say they believe the message believe the seven thunders that doesn't change anybody there has to be changed on the inside by the fire of God has the only thing that gonna change reading twenty books studying brandy books talking about Centennial ministries and changing anybody it's got to be fire fire to burn the demons on fire to burn this vehicle the the John said that man is coming he will baptize you with the Holy Ghost and get fire glory to God new tropical changer I raise up a wedding changer I bet a car I'm at the house I bet the life I bet that hose no it doesn't matter saying the rightness this morning because this word could changer [Applause] hallelujah you are born with a carnal spirit and there's a junction in your spirit for what the devil after offer but it's the Holy Spirit that's like course are you happy I will give you a new spirit I will put within you and I will Jam inside that new spirit my Holy Spirit you will lift the world you ever top the world you're gonna act the world you may set your soul on fire glory glory no tournament every man should be on science writer here this mission is too precious as to what I love going inside of it we want to respond to the love of God as God love that brought you out it's good enough to open your eyes it's not love to take your to blame loud is your wretched miserable naked it's the love of God that did that nothing you have done nothing you could ever do you're elected according to the foreknowledge of God [Applause] [Music] unless you are being changed in you you could worship and be religious that's why as sham religious people with a foolishness we're slammed up against a war shouldn't me exist I've no time for that it will eat down the road we're not looking for numbers we're not looking for members we have never done that so don't play coy utopian holy holy and always out of here with smoke yoked this is this race is quite different this is where people get changed transform demon can cast out or chlorine Oh God [Applause] once you let Christ take the chill in your heart those things don't bother him so much greater or you know the great things he said okay forty years ago trying to get enough money to buy him some crutches he couldn't do it right in the most unexpected place the unexpected time the more unexpected insufficient people he got what he wanted I'm so glad that God does it that way in a bunch of little so-called holy rollers one night I found this is what I my own testimony I found what I wanted what money could not buy in a bunch of illiterate uneducated listen poorly dressed people Negroes to begin with out yonder in a little oil converted Salim on the floor on the floor I found a price a jewel when that old aqui look in my face and said have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe he didn't ask him are you the Prophet are you Malachi for are you William Branham that was not the question he was asked him he would say have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe or let's read on it was something that I wanted I didn't expect to find among those people but they had what I needed the United Nations today they wouldn't accept what we got but that's what they need who share of all the rest of them need Christ in the baptism of the Holy Ghost it will change at this position it will make men who they hate become brothers that is what the Holy Ghost was dealing for ho glory to God it will take Greenaway it will take malice away it will take strife away and put love and joy and peace and goodness and mercy that is what the Holy Ghost will do Oh glory to God hallelujah little net jacket and I sit down with no time with somebody with no time if you make fancy clothes along with somebody with boring looking clothes it doesn't matter is the love of God is one spirit is one wearing down it is one wedding supper is one millennium is one bridegroom or Florida caught on a many membered bride international on the world Lord just could halt the bride AME Church actually kind of believers what time are you this morning Oh glory to God nobody could hold the bride well the bad captive Christ in the head of the church these are head this morning Oh glory to God hallelujah my my my my Oh glory to God this is what about your job sorry listen about your home yet this is not about that is about eternity this is about pride it's about leaving here this is the understand that you just passing through here like Abraham your stranger your pilgrim breeze what you're seeking assiduous maker and builder is God we have a Hopf have a way to get over here there must be a key to get over here the Prophet brought the key to get over here it says rapture and said not just normal say it is a theater changer in the moment and I think of an eye it's rapture and said we have to get to that you have to find that you have to walk into that it's a different kind of it altogether Oh glory to God is a power God release it in your soul [Applause] all the other generation looking forward to dying not to go and fall asleep but this is your only generation such as a tremendous promise to walk pass through debt deaf at a standstill as a passed by that could only watch about capital because we shall not sleep we shall be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye there's only generation the only people have the opportunity because what we turn us back to Eden there was no there was no illness there was no green here we're going back to either be taking back the power before we leave here see eternal no the sons of God I've returned back to the evening in the morning the first day we went back to Eden okay the lord I shall to pray but a man I'm demonstrated the power that was in Eden [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah in other words the sons that Adam was supposed to reproduce is being reproduced now I don't want to reproduce another son of God in His image and likeness but God's and Jesus who II for new Accord who we call it justified and we justified he's not already glorified he predestinated you to be conformed to the image of his son you be seated not conformed to the church image not to conform to some man image conformed to his image every step we take must be more like Jesus what can I swallow further now Wow so when a man lives by faith and walks by feet I mean substant feet notice he didn't say when a church walked my feet or coupe with what my feet were convinced and what my thing is are talking about that he is ziering now to the individual when a man that's you what's my feet talks by feet live by feet I mean substance feet not more Champion feet but that kind of it talking in the talk my feet not that substance Abraham substance Isaac was in him and he could speak it he believed it he had it he could be pure for it nor had a substance faith the rain was coming he couldn't show anybody the rain but the substance in him making Bella AK so once it comes the substance and make you prepare you have no substance if you're not on fire you have no substance if you can worship you have no substance if you can't press substance make you act because it's revealed to you what will be but it is not yet but it will be come on now tried okay for Puma hanging out your body this morning and you know God is a healer the substance it will praise

shame on you if the Lord be with me I shall be able to drag them out give me 9 mountain give me my Mountain give me my revival glory to God hallelujah you're gonna find out in the sermon this morning the behavior of the elect so you can't just say you're elect maybe for another God and you sit down little lazy like a lump not pick up move you they will take our earth creature shake here hallelujah that they're working in a horse and I press to what the mark you see because you elected you to brats come on up only the electrical press command master hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory to God because I elected let's shake them demons off that shake off the snake yesterday lujah come on now there is no power want you to succeed except the power of God everything JAMA need to feel to fall to be an embarrassment and it is Greece to the kingdom of God this is what Satan want he went to brag look at an egg one for next one backslide and this one in sin and this one can't make it a next one this the next one that that's what Satan when the accuser the bedroom but what what the cancel or that to let you know that what what what you did and maybe doing it wasn't in your front part of the his mind that's the information that I've nothing to an election they're just information but whatever don't understand you I let you see deliverance so you maybe see the Prince go get a lot of shout the woman at the well like have five man who wants you hot what but whatever it wasn't hers and so on right that was information that was actual life experience and so on know Jesus from the freezer so he had to prick bring her into election he has to show her she is for known she conveyed the foreknowledge elected by the foreknowledge of God he had the pastor because she was foreknown of God he couldn't miss her for nothing the sins couldn't stop it the circumstances are wrong can you stop it nothing she did in the past in the present or the future could have stopped it because that was that seed of God that was in the mind of God Oh glory to God so he come to show you I phone you you woman you are higher than that you can live above that I'm telling you you should live above Shin above the world above everything the devil could offer you can yes you can yes you can yes you give the Lord a shout [Applause] Superman says when a man lives by feet watch my feet I mean substance feet he is isolated from the entire world and become a new creature in Christ so on anybody does doesn't affect you somebody said can't make a deep body can make that not affecting you they have no permission to speak into your life there are many people want to speak into your life they have no choice to continue the way of counselors who want to come through they have not taught you to give you advice what call is what qualification have to advise you they have no quality to advise you they speak into your life the cat tell me you're not gonna make it but I tell you no good they don't forget about that let the word speak into your life [Music] so my thoughts are to watch you thoughts of peace not pots of evil lots of good that that's the thoughts of God to speak into your life that's why we'll be careful your friends are because it will hinder you gonna be careful your Sochi sir because I will stop you pass up your fishing and mess up your dream or chlorine Oh God praise God hallelujah see

walk by substance it he said no dear you're know getting into pipe material I thought everybody in church his brain he said no when you walk by this kind of fate when you act by fear to live by faith substance faith your know getting into pride material but if that decay is allocated by material shortener because this means that you reach up to a point where like David said don't ten thousand fall on my right side I shall not be moved then I was David step over dead bodies he said Oh God look over there over there - no not David got ten thousand fall on my right side I shall not be moved because I have a revelation of my election to sit on that wrong that soil is temporary on what give the Lord a shout in the house [Applause] solo even though he's fired but David fighting for his life running for his life so david casa elected already for short runs sorta dead was horrible kill him because fossil is after him even at the fight and run and hide and do everything but he knew he was

life went into Wesley and one big blade who look like the green when the problem comes the shock watch so therefore the life keep traveling on isn't that right but a brown I'm talking about so the life is what kind of really dominated after the life pass through denomination denominational denomination but they have to have something that kind of B denomination which is the life itself and that life is faith to virtue knowledge that life cannot be denominated you can't box that in you can't let you say that in you got put clothes on that and say have to be so that's the life if I break out what was pushing off isn't that right we're on set Moses call a nation of domination here we go Christ today is calling a church out of a church Christ is calling what a church out of a church taking them to that promised eternal that glorious eternal promised land so there's church but the seventh on erosion ten comes to call a bride out of the church don't stay in church come on to be bright respond to the corn this mighty angel came down and crowd when love was seven thunders trade forces out relish antennas mighty angel that's Christ your husband Russian ten seven is the messenger that's what Eliezer version 1080 level as the pride only get right now Ruffy sign from the book or plural you are speaking your deliverance speaking your it be holy convocation speaking your revival speaking equipment power coming upon your life speaking your transformation speaking rapture and faith that's that's coming from the book we can only speak from the book glory to God we're not normal preachers in the Pentecostal preacher this is the book being open the full book being open Oh glory to God are you with me no but I'm answer to refuse the person that's doing the callin I love that Christ no matter if you're Methodists Lutheran not against them not at all but in this age you have got to accept my decision that is the person of Christ which is the word so now we come down to another feeling that I emotion not a nice thing I nice feeling oh no no no it's the wood so after all after all the shout and all the praise and worship it comes right back to what God said in his word Oh hallelujah praise God so the only way to do is not say I belong to assemblies I would have to be same today this is a group this is the kingdom this is it we have the Manatee our church of the hour everything I do I belong to one this Tunis whatever it is all of them there I belong to the Church of God that don't mean a thing he said our Father shouted and danced that's perfectly all right but that was their day but the day you are confronted not with the organization they made but with the life that is going on which is Jesus Christ that's all she's trying for that life not just to belong to another group so no matter how religious you are how many churches you belong to how many books your name is on if that genuine Holy Ghost is in you which is this word manifested you will see the messes of the hour because it's the holy who that does it is the inspiration that have to strike you so dumb time you're talking about talking and sharing the wood and so on but it will take inspiration he said he elected of God see me the north time Moses time Jesus time the Apostles time leutis time Wesley time man Acosta time because that was the seed was on the earth when this inspiration was poured out now while the inspiration is poured out the gathered the bright together it is only the elected will see it so he prophesy that an inspiration will be poured out to gather the bright together only the elected could see it because elected is really the inspiration the seeds of the inspiration itself so you are seeds of God waiting for inspiration to pick you up because once you are inspired is changes all everything listen to your ordinary folks and let the spirit come upon you fire come upon you don't let the devil never playing with you play with fire the devil screaming fire hallelujah praise God because Samson was a normal guy no big muscles were when the spirit come upon him he was bigger than he looked he was stronger than he looked because there was a bigger power upon him I went as dynamics that head stole this capstone this bond of perfectness this love this child you've never faileth went up on that bright bigger than she looks more powerful and she looks where I'm says we wouldn't pray for the sick then we would command it not even lay hands on us area command endeavors to come out commander plank to see command the lame to walk commanded umbels be commanded speak Paul see Loreena Claude do believe that did we're acquaintances say that China hallelujah so know why the inspiration is poured out the calendar by together it with doors only those elected I will see it oh praise the name of the Lord question and answers but a brand on will there be is there now a place for the bright that got it together to live like when Moses led the channel is row that's a big question I'm going to answer a question for you it was just revealed to me I'm going to tell you the truth yes sir there's a place for all the brighter gather you want to know where it is it's in Christ oh oh I thought I told us some along San Fernando no I told us a place in America who what about Europe what about Africa what about South America oho I mean that's not a place no the place is in Christ but how do you get into Christ by one spirit you're baptized into one body press brethren breasts [Applause] this is serious stuff this is not skim milk this is serious stuff hallelujah you praise God the word rapture is not even a Bible he sit-ins to be caught up I would not have your brethren considering them that asleep that you sorrow not as others were of no hope for if we believe that Christ rose again from the dead then that sleep in Christ Jesus will God bring with him for with this we say unto you by the word of the Lord that we which are alive and remain unto the common Lord shall not prevent which means the hinder those who are asleep for the Lord himself shall descend of him with a shout this is but a random interpreter than that he's on what you notice a greeting take place here now don't miss this he said treating zhh there's three things that has to happen before gee the lord himself appears treating 'he's so now a shout of voice a trumpet the Lord Himself treating 'he's happened a shout a voice a trumpet has to happen before Jesus appear a shock what is the shout it's the message going forward the Living bread of life bringing forth the bride hallelujah so Raritan 10 what was the message seven thunders that was the message to call a bright together the Canada bride to give the bride feet to sure about how to repeal every mystery under the seventh seal every mystery that has been revealed every mystery reflected in type praise God isn't that right first seal second seated see history fourth seal Amen pelos writer right in the hell as it was that's that's his that's that's prophecy 50s you saw under the altar six seals judgment earthquake seven seas silence that's where you come in does they go to hide you in that silence and God took the voices of the seven thunders from the back of the book and put it under the silence I said as the fullest fool of the mystery behind that silence you say when the seven seas break it starts in silence or chlorine October when it finishes we supposed to be way up there the know who God is how he lives his nature his being we supposedly all the way up there father of there is a deal to faked convert you to knowledge we supposed to be standing ready to break it up attend a church age at the end of the seventh seal or glory of God we have to press bredrin not to belong to this message to belong to the eighth day or plural of God hallelujah the bride is going to a city or that's going to be outside the city but got a bride will be in the city that is hopes for the ride oh that's when she a second is Brian into the city after toffee is honeymoon that sounds good to me I will say that that sounds great to me she and a half years wedding supper that's some could do we

trail behind and you're watching it just remembers watching it maybe taking pictures with it the Monika the selfies and begin pictures you thing but the bride she puts in the dawn she put on the shoes she adjusting the dress she's fixing herself that's what we talking about not because the words say you elected a wonderful knowledge they will sit down and wait for somebody to dress you stadia judge

his wife's administer ready by doing what put it on virtue knowledge temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness what you doing you are making us of ready for the rapture for the going home we are going home we are gonna leave here Oh glory to God praise God one day the last sermon gonna be preached or in a copy will become the church in the past is gone not going 6v dung in a gun like Enoch he walked with God and was not for God took him governor take a people a Gentile bride jeezum is it 2000 years no one they said wait till the anointing of God strike home Kabul in one year what all if you look and feel to do 2000 years this lovely Gentile praise God given approval election by a significant you're gonna pre-election by your life you put your election by your prescient Oh hallelujah so what's the shout is the bestest grin for to bring forth the bride then he said the first thing happens he started selling with revenue there's a shout what is it the message to get the people together Oh glory to God so what the shout is our message to get the people together the shout is a messenger getting the people ready so Berta Brandon brought a message to guarded a bride together is not right revolution book of symbols but a pile of fur seals no Lucy he said it's calling for seven mysterious thunders they're not even written at all and I believe through those seven thunders will be revealed in a last day in order to get the bright together forever and fate so the shout and the tunnels is the same thing the shot was sent to Gaara the brides together to bring an interruption feet that means to bring her poor heart individual inheritance Oh glory to God you understand that this this wasn't preachy as I going on because people just wanted to be in church take that day in a church daily message but as you mature and as the years roll by you recognize had come down to individual heritance because Joshua was given three things to do cross the people over fight and divide Alan so I am saying we have cross over we have been fighting for years years years know is land division time at topsail is not a church thing I had a revelation as years ago that the people can vote their pasta to be adopted adopted adoption is not between the church and the pasta at dr. Levine Court and his son I understood that years ago that's why I never study about the people what they think and what they feel at the end I have to please him no no I'm not trying to preach you happy and trying to say what he told me to say [Applause] he gave me this information thirsty make a correlation sure I would know that talk about a little bit in the meeting and that's what I feel to bring to you this morning don't take a testimony for granted you know like we some people the backslidden and they say you know I'm I'm their China God and you know so flimsy and the day smoking you know go bring me back and I give them a motive is balance and all that it's just intelligent that's not dumb here no no that is in the lecture Samson is the son of God something he was covenant in Samson tasted the power of God he knew it but he was fooling around fooling for me you didn't mess with Delilah and in it all he still have the connection because I saw her access right the father I was thing about my own sons I said wait a minute wait we got know what they do this with my sons hadn't I them I kept change the front the money myself you know I don't know who you are to me back on them because of what they said my son's because they were booted from me under Gaza what you have been booted from quad [Applause] so regard you do how you do yourself sons but it's what time so I Dutch enough to do is father and son not Church so people have the minister love the pastime what that's fine is good everything else but that'll love and that clapping applause and she can His Highness on that doesn't make him adopted Rama's Daniel was told by the angel he heard sometimes Daniel did too they uttered a voice is Daniel grab the pen to write ingested or I did though write it on the backs of the Bible what he said John saw the same thing it was already watch it had already been written outside the Bible and had seven scenes on the back of the book that no matter open those seals first he described them as seals here is now that was them voices so the back of the book had seven voices which is also seven seals isn't that right so he took those voices on the back of the book and put it inside the book under the seven seals seven thunders uttered the voices Oh hallelujah no man know what it was but the Bible said and told Daniel and also John that in the last days these seven voices would be known by the real true church so I chose that not reaching a seven thunders forget it the present of the church material which we have lots of material oh it's an abundance but bright material this sometimes will produce that because the seventh is produced and not Ephesians which will come back to defeat and defeat in you means you survive as individual if just church collapses and demolished you still survives if trainer split up in 100 pass you will survive with your feet because it's not man that call you has got that call you you have got a revelation who called you isn't that right what chlorine has got a no man could take that call in no mental go between that calling is that you and somebody else and God knows you and God it's not right praise God oh my hallelujah praise God praise berm says there's a time a time what Jesus England to stand outside you're doing not all the time there's a time when he's getting nothing turn away then you will did not new to the knocking on you'll never find it come while it is time come why there's a knock don't you compromise with anything less than the baptism of the Holy Ghost like they got at Pentecost oh praise God don't let your heart settle for nothing less than that oh praise the name of the Lord so Church it come down to this hour now and I feel it's very very serious that is each individual have to make your calling and election sure it's not good enough to see Jesus sees me that could enough to know that you get baptized in Jesus name and you're see if you want to know what you're called unto you really want to know what you look on to burns the election looks back the foreknowledge that's where election comes from the foreknowledge I've got wait a minute I'm elected yes how elected if on you me I lectured on the foreknowledge of God the foreknowledge of God elected me then watch then what ROM says now I'm predestination looks the destiny what you are pretty Tillman to be so you may not be it yet but you had predetermined to be what God ought in you to be Peter was a fisherman but he was predestinated to be an apostle when God quali he was a fisherman he wasn't converted yet but he got predetermined this man gonna make it through are you at me where I'm said it this way don't forget that election looks back and says I was a Kabul I was born in sin Shipman liquidly comfortable speaking lies born among sinners father and mother or my family sinners I was a cockapoo but all of a sudden I become a weak green what happened what is that election [Applause] so your present status is not as important as your election your election is more important than your sin I say this way your election is more powerful than your failures [Applause] man sir your failures caught see your election [Applause] so in Samson grinders Mills for 5-7 years almost years somebody says something he's finished right dog Sam say no finish but go ahead for you Samson Samson know about the status ministry big-time sound stop or they kill more Phyllis as he ever did in his life God puts put Samson behind the enemy lines did thought it was an embarrassment and I bring about the shin but they might understand God took them but fool them God had him to bring Samson right in the enemy line right among them right among the camp said bring on that blank fella who used to have power who used to have glory who used to have anointing we used to preach we used to testify who you have a powerful witness and so on like each I up now he dead shut little boy hidden Samson he got do your own thing know who he little boy using let me leave me to the post where the whole thing sound I believe me right now I want to be positioned before a pre but I'm a son and my father is my father my father will hear me my collar was under repentance a long time under the struggle a long time I listen to Samson prayer yes a Lord I'm a sinner from long time of hurry no he wasn't Latin his Lord avenge me of my eyes never Oscars had no right taking out my eyes I didn't give it to me they shouldn't take it from me once more once more once more once more none of Holy Ghost none of their Pentacles one small pre-fill in Ceylon deliverance once more hooray hallelujah sit down a minute what if Samson said I am elected I agree in no way I stand in middle I am moving guess what happened he was gonna move on nothing nothing but because it was elected he knew he had to be in position to rec and do the greatest damage he knew he had to be placed positionally because just stand there that's why quater just like every place you put your foot hears him Matt hi Matt I'm Matt imagine how many you years back in time every place you put your foot is yours Samson sir put me put me put me put me position between you two pillars let me feel them pillars he has had a Preetam you want to feel them he want to make ready Oh glory to God I want to feel bring me to them Phyllis sighs all I'm getting excited because I thought Samson comin to put a performance Oh week hallelujah he was perfectly weak because when you're perfectly weak there could be really strong he was so weak he knew he didn't have the strength in himself he knew if he only called for fire if he only called for power he knew the Seas not change because he can feel the locks seven locks Seven thunders seven forces seven virtues seven manifestations seven Ramos seven spirits he could feel Oh Murray he was making sure his election and callin because God Poland don't cut them locks and he'll have the power Sampson took his hands put it in the back of his head and when he felt them locks he knew it was restored the devil cutting is here but the devil couldn't cut on the roots and your roots go back to Elohim your roots go back to Tennessee your roots go back to the air tail and when Samson said the power of the locks hallelujah these are once more Lord and I refer to knowledge temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness I'm standing on the seven-step fire charity eloise Dunamis dynamics or chlorine Oh God [Applause] come on you sons of God do I ears let's fly this mornin [Applause] Samson couldn't have the confidence to pray if the lux was restored there once the luster restores the covenant God can't lie is that a man you said that covenant is there I have to honor that word I have to honor that world I have to come down once the seven locks is dead got to happen what seven thunders ed got to happen we're not talking about Lisa we thought would live voices now oh come on now say Amen

what take him out praise the name of the Lord so the common the Lord is so eminent the common of judgment he's calling the elected together in oneness with himself not a church you find I'm like me Oh Emma sighs in that and all these - parroting I have to do it I can't sit enough because man have again come and message gone downhill with spirit a man so caught promised to the Prophet I'll write history once more yeah the spirit have the right again the spirit itself have to mount a bride to give the bride a voice this one other quote that one of our court but when the voice come this here is an oyster bride to give the bride a voice and I'm gonna say go be seven voices go beat under than a bride which signs one of the miracles with a demonstration of power on the spot to prove it on the spot no partner no prophesy now confirming on the spot when butter and honey services confirmation was on the spot after every service he said you know what I'm waiting on I'm wait the ladies of the Lord then he's talking a little bit he is here praise God he's ready now I take every spirit under my control I see that himself was here every spirit under my control for the glory of God we are coming back to that he said I'll ride a trail once more we are coming back to the Supreme anointing knowing what and how Hoklo leaders are we are coming back to a super church to a super race as we near that so Gloria what is he doing there you know he called the elect to make the Lutheran's oh but Ovid God well he called me let yes Abraham was elect that was edition luck was choice remember luck was family coming to but Abraham was the elect he called elect to make the Lutheran's he called the elect out of the Lutheran similar residence he called the elect out of residence to make the Pentecostals now he is calling the elect many Castle out to make the headstone so this elect Bragg is going to become the headstone watch what to come into it so you can become God's house or God's temporal for him to step into it he's going away or time he going to put on your dress he's going to put on your shoes because you are gonna be the headstone capstone magnet bride to pull up the rest from the grave come on see him I somebody get a lot of shout in the home now he's calling the elect manacles allowed to make the head still to come into it a very same kind of ministry jumping right in on it Paul in his children from all the nominations and all walks of life or praise the name of the Lord so friends to me what is the evidence if you're not establishing the present truth if I don't know where you're at this is what the word supposed to do bring you to a spot where you could know where you at it can't be you're not sure it cannot be you're not convinced it cannot be after all these years and if you save all it cannot be done it has to be a Concord revelation that your name is on that book that you're elected according to foreknowledge of God Nobita stumbled so be the normal fallen be the denied Christ so he was qualified to testify if you do these things you shall never fall he knew what fallen is about so he knew what to do did not befall you are you at me now Peter understood that so be they could share that with us having escaped the corruption doesn't were chill us strong desires your own self will your own desires you want to push that aside to come into the will of God the program of God for your life hallelujah start to get a higher desire to do the will of God to connect the purpose of God and that's why this morning the Holy Spirit is saying make a calling and election sure confirm it riah film it let it be vindicated that you might know your sonship and the culture is intact that they'll have confidence to face tomorrow but certainty with confidence with assurance did need that for devil make mince we through the outside with all the assurance of your calling on your election Gordon call it a defeat but call it a victory God quality overcome only overcome ones will be set and will be pleased Oh hallelujah praise the name of the Lord please visit Jesus so the purpose of the bride is a comment to this bride buddy come baptized into the body coming to one man one Accord coming the perfection to raise the dead almost true oh praise the name of the Lord praise be to Jesus or could we give you the awesome presence so when Peter said he that luckily things as blind and can't see afar off he is showing clearly that being forgiven of your sins does not mean you're automatically grow in God let me sit again when Peter said - he did look at these things as bland can't see afar off and has forgotten that he was purged from his old sins proven that being purged from your sins doesn't automatically make you climb up that tree so it means your election to salvation your election to fate put you in a position to give all diligence press pork you have to do it every day Adam Preston push him it cannot be I might end up in forgiving rejoice eat children babes babes I write to you children because sins are forgiven it has to go beyond that because one quad wanted to go beyond young men and go on to become fathers which is adopted sons but wanted to come into a straighter maturity because he can't give children inheritance you give son's inheritance mature sons right nuisance mature sons so what ones that come into spiritual maturity and you could lose powers on you boy I'm not stingy on or going to haul him back I'm holding back because what stingy is not that it's correcting you want to connect with like if a man I can handle power power does to people money does cheap people victimless strip people God understand that as human nature power Prime Minister president whatever to see you or whatever mess people up because the character is not yet to manage it so God bring a good message to bring character in because the dynamic struck the Pentecostal and they couldn't reduce Jesus Christ to produce gifts with all the power tongues interpretation and men committed adultery and fooling wrong under the dynamic inspiration so you bought the profit with the word which you produce corrector but the trial of your faith because corrected other gifts [Applause] see it virtue knowledge and other gifts is you have to press into it trials and tribulations and all whatever shape you into it the Bible scholar would be informed into the image of the world formed shipped you know cut out I'm not hearing much mm and I'm said preaching it we have way call a premium message I'm not finish I will be cutting horn you don't betray the edge he was a word about wound that is granite a fine edge hallelujah scraping you off real good all your ways or after use have to be scraped off shipped off cut off glory to God do you want to be changed I don't want you mean as you are make your call and election shore or glory that call your present condition has none do with your future destiny in God don't let it ever tie you up you made me messed up right now that doesn't mean you mess up later on God come to get you all to that isn't that right glory to God glory to God hallelujah hallelujah praise the name of the Lord thank you Jesus so he is here Peter said get the reassurance of your calling in God get the reassurance of your election in God and if you do these things you will never fall or praise the name of the Lord thank you Jesus Oh glory to God hallelujah let's be the name of the Lord praise the name of the Lord hallelujah praise be to Jesus hallelujah praise God praise God so to make a collection shows more than coming to the church right it more than coming too big to son later that people wouldn't think it'd backslide I'm almost done we got some more here Romans 911 for the churn had been born need haven't done any good or evil that the purpose of God according to election might stand not of works what of him that call it amplified said even so in order to carry out God's purpose are the churun were yet unborn and had so far done nothing either good or evil even so in order further the carrier God's purpose of selection election and choice which depends not on works of what man can do but on him who calls him so this election and choice has none do with you it has to do with him and your response to that election is where your labor comes in is where your present comes in is where your behavior comes in to be found worthy of the love that God extended towards you under Greece and the elective love yes ministered to you hallelujah who can lay charge at God's elect who can bring any charge against God's elect it is God who justify that is who puts it in right relation to himself who shall come forward and accuse or impeach those whom God have chosen blessed is the man in whom God imputed no sin it's not what David said all right so as we hit the home stretch Colossians 3:12 put on therefore as the elect of God holy and beloved borrowers of mercies kindness humbleness of mind meekness suffered long suffering I see no arrogance there I see no pride I see no I am better than you deal I see I'm the boss over you dear I am not seeing that I want to read it again if you come to the revelation of your election here what to put on you have to put it on it's not automatically on we want to cancel all this automatic thing as I still took time in France is not an automatic guys gears the editorial hoof is gear second gear are the chewing is nice you try automatic but this is true in gayest night you have to apply ting this wife has made herself ready they said the wife wait for just to drop down and was fully cluded no the wife had a work to do it have things to applying that you must apply so put on therefore as the elect of God holy and beloved bowels of mercies kindness humbleness of mine meekness and long-suffering and in the amplified something I like to read the amplified this is what he said Clawd yourselves therefore as God's own chosen ones his own picked representatives who are purified and holy and web beloved by God himself by putting on behavior mat by behavior put it on marked by tender-hearted pity and mercy kind feeling a lonely opinion of yourself Gentiles and patients which is tireless and long-suffering and as the power to endure whatever comes good with good with good temper kabisa amen let's continue verse 13 forbearing one another and forgiving one another if any man will quarrel against any image Christ forgive you so also do II it has no authority to continue the grudge or hold the odds or perpetuate animosity there is no authority to do that be gentle and forbearing one another and if one has a difference a grievance or complaints against another readily pardoning each other even as the Lord has freely given and forgiven you it has no I will forgive he if you repent have nothing beware that I waiting for you to come to me it have nothing to do with that above all these things put on charity which is the bond of perfectness above all these put on in love and for yourselves with a bundle perfectness which binds everything together completely and in an ideal harmony and let the peace of God rule in your hearts to which also you are called in one body and big one be thankful no BIA be thankful Oh hallelujah praise be to Jesus could you take them all let the word of Christ dwell in you richly teaching and admonishing one another in Psalms and hymns and spiritual songs singing with grace in your hearts on to the Lord and whatever you do in word or deed do all in the name of Jesus Christ giving thanks to God and Father by him this is something to live by your cargo nearby in name of Jesus Christ you can't smoke in Jesus name you can't drink in Jesus name the car won't float in Jesus name let me see it again you can't go on flute in Jesus name even if you don't see a man a co-signature whatsoever you do in word or deed do all the name of the Lord Jesus Christ given tanks or praise God praise God oh man as any could print oh boy something want to get to put a brand amended option the purpose of this is senior position and Christ see that is not something that you just tumbled into okay this is important something that might you merited somewhere it is what God did for you himself not that you were so good you went to church one night and some poor brother let usually altar it wasn't that it was God before the foundation of the world predestinated UT's in a life when you get there no wonder 24 LS cut leader crumbs everybody lay down their crowns everyone fell on their faces they didn't have worn thing they could see no preacher no elder Lord nothing all breeze through the lamb [Applause] nobody cos I'd pray more than his brother I pray long and his sister nope we have nothing to see it's chrome spells and dog and face only grown Pauline woody is the lamb Oh plurid Oh God isn't that right we're in the other bonnet towards us in all wisdom and prudence praise God watch having made known to us the mystery of his will look at those words haven't made known to us the mystery of Israel let a prophet put the magnifying glass and that the mysteries of his will and remember how he hung on that how many was here this morning let's see how he spoken at the mission as well now it is not just a little thing it's a mystery God's will he's doing deeper is a mystery and each man yeah we go you see elected right how many visited mercy no son reason God see little answer all right but listen know God's will is a mystery and each man has to seek out the will of God for his or her life so this is not automatic that's why the elect will have a certain behavior the elect will seek the mystery of his will God I born your will is not the will of God filled life is not just again grow up in church get subjects get a job get married get cheering on this day it has to have a higher purpose than that okay question and answers how does one know their rightful position in the body of Christ that's a good one how does one knows that's the kind of question amongst many of us here tonight how do you rightfully know i unproven at this brother wants to know what position what in Christ what part of Christ do I play know for instance I like to say this brother to give you the base as I know your position in Christ is revealed to you by the Holy Spirit it's one and then if you want to know if you want to know whether it's the Holy Spirit or not find out whether he blesses what you're doing or not if he blesses it then it's him if he doesn't bless like somebody said to me long ago the local me to preach I said well then preach you say well you see I really think it's Satan he can get somebody to act like that and then deceive them and just what he wants to do the whole point the world points the finger right there somebody thinks they have a give up speaking in tongues interpretation has a gift of divine healing some of these things sometimes they are mystical in those things and sometime they think they have inducted and when they have is tricky so always do this brethren when you feel you're supposed to do a thing find out if it's Scripture for you to do it not just what in one place I mean completely scriptural through the Bible we'll go and do it and so on then you talk about a motive and objective and so on like that so that is very very interested so pre is going to say if a man can be a pastor and his real flight and so on he said the Lord call me turn such-and-such to be a pastor a pastor can be a flighty person a passage solid a pasta is song just a few more and we finish Jesus our perfect faith he had it he cook it because he was the word and you become the word as you receive the world and that receiving is inwardly and willingly not outwardly inwardly and willingly so when you hear the words say you're elected you receive that when you would say you're forgiven you receive that when the worst you are justified you're not studying what is happen at know you receive that inwardly and willingly praise God no watch he said to us if you abide in me and I will abide in you you can ask what you will it shall be done then recognize the position in the scripture as a believer you've got to recognize your position as he recognized his position oh my I love this one and you are just as important as Billy Graham know he said we notice you have got so many milligrams today but you see God never meet God meet one Billy Graham and you were just as important as Billy Graham or robbers for any he must men you were just as important until you get out of your please so in your place you are in your element in your place your frame in your place is when you could have fit to be good for anything when you're in your place then you are no good at all and you're out of place your hindrance when a wife out of a place in a home is problem in the home when a husband of the place in the home is problem in the home a wife thinks she saw spiritual she must pretend on husband and she have things cuckoo things out he all all together oh my hallelujah you have to come back in your place we got our the husband do see what do I supposed to do under wife supposed to be here and you applied that to your life do not see if he do this I could do this it doesn't work so it has a rule for the man it have a rule for the woman the husband have to behave how the scriptures you supposed to be here husband love your wife you could ask the would and she must know if he loves because you will show it you demonstrated you will act act it out isn't that right children obey your parents that's the word now this is a fighter parents that's the word obey your parents you may disagree to parents but will be them and it will be n them look at a blessing hallelujah your parents may not be right they X when we don't aboard and it being the best of the Cantor CD from yourself but will be them because the would said sure so then you are in the word none of what listen you because you keep in the world Oh hallelujah praise God so therefore is so therefore praise God so stay in your position stay what God made you and then it will operate right not a Methodist say when you shout you got it I love them shout it didn't love it the pedicle said when you're speaking tone they got it maybe speakin dummy didn't have it he said no watch the Pharisees but when the world has been manifest they didn't recognize it he said no if you are in the by it pride if you are in the brain the brightest part of the husband the only place you will ever recognize it is to recognize what part of the husband that would you are you can't this is a big one this is huge you can't oh listen uh Sylvania the only place you would ever recognize it is the recognize what part of that husband that word you are or you can't recognize being the bride how many sees that you have to recognize your position here the big one you can't recognize somebody else because I shall fix nobody you have too many people try to fix others and dakine fix there oneself you can't recognize somebody s position the past have a rule to do certain things not you do try to take up that rule Oh hallelujah so you cannot recognize somebody else position you could only recognize yours that's why we say to you this morning make your pollen and your election sure you can't make that for your brother your sister your husband a wife or children you have to make your calling and election sure or praise the name of the Lord when you see not a good neighbor but a son of God molded in the image of God with a dynamic power of God the answer the requests for today that he's him yesterday forever then no handing over all you he hunts for his mama he's a eager to begin with and he recognized it I know people flop in church fail and fall out whatnot and the ministry and he passed a whole and people that is sin and locked them in bondage for years and you know what you do and a person yeah but when that eager common mean that eagle - eagle Corps who is for you when you get before knowledge of God when you reach up not in foreknowledge of God it have no you know what to do you may remember and remember some of the things I've done but Jesus with a special blood forgives me of everyone [Applause] Jesus dropped the charges all right yes about too much maybe almost don't even we do very good today it was a big one I decided to deliver sometimes you have to separate from everything that's deal it to you to take your position that God has called you to there's a complete meal tonight this service is complete you have to listen back there lot of stuff inside of it sometimes you have to separate yourself from everything that's dear to you honored to take your position that God has called you to I am sure you can read between the lines what I'm saying sometime the very nearest person on earth you have to shake hands with them to take your position and cranks way God has called you well what is God doing transforming you from what you was maybe a daughter or son whatever it is from a lovely family sometimes he places you somewhere else who does that God does that take you from your lovely family because your family is your family and your family is hindering you because all you know is what they see it coming basically in that's all you hear and that is your world might be an alternative world but when God take you out is to break you out God take it out your family certain he never tells Abraham still yeah he's a colorful monger people come on among the family he was drifting into people that was different because he had to walk I fate I meant God pull that cord upon you he make you make movement he didn't expect to move even become a drifter and seeking a seat who's making dinner as God Oh hallelujah glory transforming you from what you was he places you somewhere else because it is his way of I renew in your mind to obey the word we can s at the price so if going to see if you want to qualify if your people to live the price he give you a big challenge and if you tap hear the price of back dog but if you pay the price you walk the walk hallelujah and you walk the talk Oh hallelujah poor evil good but I bet him get their hand of God upon him steadily when he didn't want to go money Pentecostals when list this mother-in-law he lost his wife he lost his daughter but God was testing him you have to pay a price he had to help other people and he couldn't help his own family and when the devil was pressing him look the servant God and he just said it the Lord give and the Lord taketh away best appeasing of the Lord that's what we're talking about hallelujah are you ready our redemption wasn't a cheap thing it was the son of God that died for us things of value come tug of a great price to bring this message it wasn't easy he said wasn't I have to forsake
