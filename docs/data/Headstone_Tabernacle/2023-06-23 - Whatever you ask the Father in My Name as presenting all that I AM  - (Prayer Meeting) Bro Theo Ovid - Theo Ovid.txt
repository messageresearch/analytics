and thanks so much for being here tonight we certainly know that you could have been I elsewhere do other things but by grace of God you're here and I pray that God bless you so you have your Bibles I'd like you to turn to Exodus chapter 3 wanna read verse one to seven Exodus chapter 3 is a familiar scripture and we want to just see what the Lord will speak to us tonight prison now Moses kept the flock of Jethro is father-in-law the priest of media and he led the flock to the backside of the desert and came to the Mountain of God even to hold it and the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush and he looked and the whole the bush burned with fire and the Bush was not consumed and Moses said I will now turn aside and see this great sight while the bush is not burnt or when the Lord saw that he turned aside to sin God called him out in the midst of the bush and said Moses Moses and he said here am I note that even though the pillar fire the bush has been burnt and whatnot it was still Moses Choice it was still Moses decision to turn aside to see let's continue and when the Lord saw before that he turned aside to see God call him out of the midst of the Bush and said Moses Moses he said here am I and he said draw not lie hi hither put off thy shoe from of thy feet for the place where I understand this is Holy Ground moreover he said I am the god of thy father the god of Abraham the god of Isaac the god of Jacob and Moses hit his face when he was afraid to look upon God and the Lord said I have surely seen the Affliction of my people which are in Egypt and I feel they're crying by reason of their taskmasters and I know yourselves God through seven of the Amplified says and the Lord said I have surely seeing the Affliction of my people who are in Egypt and I feel they're crying because of their task Masters and oppressants and I know their sorrows and sufferings and child and I want you to take that personal tonight for I know their sorrows you know your Sorrows you know your sufferings and you know your trials father God bless this word Lord bless this stirring at your place in my spirit and heart to share with your people tonight in Jesus name asked amen no I want you to notice something here in verse 6. I am the god of thy father this is a man who never met God he only have heard intellectually what his mother told him or what his father told him that is just at the intellectual level just like many people in a message today they come to church they believe the message they believe for the brand and they believe God's not Prophet they believe the prophet and so on but it is at an intellectual level and here it is that God's disencountered a good arranged this appointment with the supernatural there it is that God began to reveal himself and I want you to note oh God reveal himself here he didn't leave Moses to his own whims and fancies his own imagination he began to identify with individuals who he identified with previously I am the god of thy father the god of Abraham an individual the god of Isaac an individual the god of Jacob an individual and I want you to note that I was thinking about titling this is the god of but I titled this exhortation to you tonight whatever you ask the father in my name as presenting all that I am he may give it to you and you'll see where I get it from whatever you ask the father in my name as presenting all that I am he may give it to you so the first thing God did was to clearly identify the muses he is not any God he is the god of fathers is not something tonight oh praise the Lord blessed be the name of the Lord thank you Jesus for Islam do you get that tonight so he's not so I like that God of your fathers what did God send the prophet Malachi to do turn our hearts back to the feet of the father it is what God originally identify himself with and he did so on the day of Pentecost we can never change that we can never erase that the prophet came to point us and to carry us back back to the feet of the fathers because that feat of the fathers was the original feat and he cannot have a have a new feed you have to go back to original feed no in preparation for the to pull and that is identified in Max mark 11. and you hear me off time preaching it and talking about Jesus talk about the third first the second pull second and then the first book at least on Mark 11 just stay with me now Mark 11 22-26 Jesus answered seven to them are faith in God so this was after Jesus cursed the Fig Tree and the next day they saw it dried up he saw a miracle they saw a power they saw a spoken word and he said have faith and God for very nice time to you that whatsoever shall see that whosoever shall see under this mountain be Thor removed and thou and be thou cast into the sea shall not in his heart but shall believe that those things which you see a shall come to pass he can have whatever is here so he's telling them this is where sons of God will be finally placed be placed in a position to speak on what they speak it will materialize it will come to pass and then he dropped down from 23 24 wherefore therefore I sent to you whatsoever things you desire When you pray believe that you receive them and he shall have them no you are believing you're receiving it is means that you're believing it from The Source the source of power you're believing it from God providing from you're not looking at this circumstance beat your children Deliverance be it a financial breakthrough be it a physical healing it doesn't matter what is the present situation he said believe you have received it so you are sick Dr give you so much Deeds or the doctor give you so much time but you choose to obey this tonight and believe you have received and you shall have whatever you you shall have that but then Jesus Dreamed a little deeper in verse 25 and when you stand praying forgive if you have ought against any that your father was in heaven May forgive you your trespasses so he put prayer under a condition so people have an awesome God and praying they will send that people haven't uh are having odds and issues and things like that and they pray to God and they pray like total waste of mind because God is not hearing that and this is where we choose not to follow let's say the god of our own imagination or the god of your own feelings or the god of your own emotion but this is the god of the word that's what he's seeing here this is written in red when you start praying forgive so you want to come and pray tonight you want to call upon God tonight something is in your heart you know you're gonna make it right you make it right then you can effectively pray and watch if you have order against any drop it drop it which is him and when you start doing forgive that if you're fought against any that your father also is in heaven May forgive you your trespasses so when somebody said I'm sorry please forgive me you're supposed to respond I forgive you see verse 26 but if you do not forgive neither will your father which in heaven forgive your trespasses no understand this this last day bride is not true she's calling it's a bride a brighter perfection disperfection is coming right up to the tooth pull which we know is the spoken word and this spoken word is a deal with the challenge of the hour we don't know later on what it will be food wise the challenges for food wax Jesus Take Five Loaves two fishes are multiplied we don't know if power will be required upon us to do the same when that time comes but the challenge to get down to the Rapture to get down to the resurrection is coming from number one to two to three you cannot sit down there and say you're in church your bride you're going to the rapture it doesn't work that way you will have to come to Migos requirement no Exodus tree and this is further down verse 13 and 14 and Moses said unto God so no Moses God spoke to him we know what happened here and then Moses recognized that he is still the person responsible to go down to Egypt and Muslim to God behold when I come under the tune of Israel and shall see unto them the god of your fathers has sent me unto you the god of your fathers has sent me unto you and they shall say to me what is his name what shall I see unto them question and God said unto Moses I am that I am he said thus shall thou see under the return Israel I am accept me unto you in the Amplified this last verse was 14 of Exodus 3. and God said to Moses I am who I am and what I am and I will be what I will be and he said You shall say this to the Israelites I am accept me to you let me repeat that again let me amplify God said to Moses I am who I am and what I am and I will be what I will be and he said You shall see this to the Israelite I am had sent me to you so this was an introduction to hold God wanted the people to know him by name he named himself or called himself I am we often see it I am whatever you have need of that I am now sin John 15 16. Jesus speaking Jesus words you have not chosen me but I have chosen you I wish the god that God engraved that in your heart tonight you have not chosen me this is Jesus speaking to us but I have chosen you one and ordain you too that you should go and bring forth fruit and that your fruit should remain and that here we go whatsoever he shall ask of the father in my name he may give it to you so you you see here like if you're seeing a motive an objective of why you have been chosen why you have been called why you are being ordained and the purpose is to bring forth fruit and that your fruit wouldn't just fall off what your foot will remain and that you would be in a place or in a position to ask so therefore the bride has to come into a position to ask of the father in his name in my name that he may give it now let's hear that same scripture in the amplifi it's in John 15 16. and reads you have not chosen me but I have chosen you I have appointed you I have planted you that you might go and bear fruit and keep on bearing and that your food may be lasted that it may remain abide so that whatever you ask the father in my name and this is what I get where I get it from and whatever you ask the my name as presenting all that I am he may give it to you let me read it again and whatsoever you ask the father in my name as presenting all that I am he may give it to you the burden of God is to get us get the church get the individual to a place to ask what you will and it shall be given or done unto you so it's not a matter of you going to church you go back home and you have no connection with God in that real relationship and that connection as brothers even make sure to this last Friday to be a friend of God so what God desires is for us to be truly on speaking things with him being speaking things with God like how Elijah was Crossing Jordan and then he said what is this you want me to do for you ask what you will do what is it that you want me to do Elijah said Elijah said the double proportion see so I want to identify that brotherly kindness is the platform to put you and speaking things with God now you might get wary of me always talking about barely kindness often he said okay but it is real this odds and brush things is tangible yeah people have things lodging their Spirits lodging them maybe in their soul and they can't seem to get rid of it but you have to in order to get on speaking things with God you say when you stand praying forgive you have to graduate from forgiveness being kind to your brethren to the kind to others and then you come and speaking to begin to ask and as you ask you see God answering your prayer you see little things that's not these big things little things and then you move right up to speak in the word now listen because we don't stretch here no but the brand I'm in a message called the guide he said God sends a guide and God wants you to remember that he's appointed guy he said I will not leave you but I'll pray the father and send you another confidence now this comforter when he was to come was the guidance to all truth and the word of God is the truth and the word is Christ I am the way the truth and the light see no and when the churches did they reject how can we ever expect to go to heaven and the Holy Spirit was sent to us for a guide we will take a cardinal Bishop General Messiah somebody like to guide us when the Holy Spirit was given to guidance this is the part I want to get to and the Holy Spirit always speaks the word not somebody's dream or interpretation or feelings or emotions Holy Spirit speaks what the word I've got many things to tell you Jesus speaks but you cannot understand them now when he comes he will guide you to it and then brother Branham breaks in and says this here that's the reason the coming of the seals at the finishing of the seventh seal the mystery of God shall be finished to know who God is one what he is to how he lives SRI his nature for his being fight you are supposed to be all the way up there by that time he's talking about the Statue of perfect man and you're seeing that the bride body Church supposed to be all the way up there talking about that Holy Spirit slot and he didn't say at the beginning at the finishing of the seventh seal the mystery of God shall be finished to know who God is in other words all about him what he is how we lose his nature his being you're supposed to be all the way up there by that time and to bring us into the full statue of sons and doors of God a church that's washed in the blood of Christ that brought without money pay for by the blood of Jesus okay we're wrapping at the end so in John 14 13 to 15 Jesus speaks he's speaking this is in red whatsoever he shall ask in my name that will I do hear this part that the father may be glorified in the Sun now you see how it come into a place where God wants us to ask and the purpose of getting that fulfilled he said that the father let me glorify in the sun because you're not doing it in your name you don't understand verse 14 if he I'll ask anything in my name I will do it then verse 15 if you love me keep my Commandments said John 14 let's read it out now in the Amplified let's go with the team and I will do I myself will grant whatever you ask in my name as presenting all that I am so that the father may be glorified and extolled into the sun yes I will grant I myself will do it for you whatever you shall ask in mining as presenting all that I am if you really love me you will keep and obey my commands so through this Prophet this entire prophet of Mark I fall this Prophet William Branham all the Mysteries were revealed all Seven Seals or seven tunnels every mystery all about him he revealed his nature his being all about him that is to be presented to God so tonight we can present we can presenting all I am having faith in all that he is regardless of your condition this is the part I want to get to you regardless of your condition what is your condition tonight you are born he could be your deliverer tonight I am your deliverer I am that I am you said he said you said regards a condition you're sick I am your healer I want you to think about it tonight what he is what he declared himself to be I am your healer and you say Lord you are my healer I am your deliverer you say Lord You Are My deliverer whatever you want him to be I am that I Am Lord I am tired Lord I am dead I am whole Lord I am back student and Lord you are restorer I am I am a restorer so God could actually bring you tonight by our anointed by his Spirit by his power and take you out of a backseat and anointing and atmosphere and bring you into his presence watch I am your deliverer you say Lord You're My deliverer whatever you want him to be I am that I am presenting all I am you can ask what you will I am every mystery I am the seven Thunder is presenting all that I am and whatever you have need of that I am and I'm cruising with this last book here foreign and the name is in the word because he is the word what he is then the word interpreted is a manifestation of the name of God this bright church will be a powerful Church a church that God will be proud of our church that will be manifesting his name the Pentecostal watch Jesus name and the speaking tongues and whatnot but the bride the manifestation of the word interprets the name of God the bride will be the world manifesting so Church inclusion it is God's will it is God's desire that you come into the position to ask whatever you will you know he said if he abiding me and my wife's abide in you you can ask so whatsoever you will and it shall be done he just asked to present all that I am and I recognize we have limited God and what do you think about that our fears shows that we have limits on God what do you feel how could you be taken out of this world before your time how could this happen man this happened that happened and you're not going to make it get fearful and you get anxious why it's because trust is not there you are not trusting them to say I am your provider I am your I would say your protector I am your Shield you think your wall is closing on you and you caught up in your own frustrations depression upset problems and so on but you're not seeing this powerful God like those two boys that say our God is able to deliver us or we will not bow down this is what I want to hear saying speaking speaking the word speaking who he is presenting all I am you get an accident what's the purpose behind that the first thing you ever want to tell your sin your fell your failed that why you get a flat tire that's why this happened that's why it happened that's why this is a second but here he said tell them I know your sorrows I know your afflictions I know your pains tell them who I am tell them I am that I am when last have you considered the I am what he is or what you want him to be I am your lawyer I'm your doctor I'm your healer I'm your baptizer I'm a deliverer the devil Kelly he won't give any Holy Ghost that's a lie he is talking God didn't see that because he said I am your Baptist you shall receive power after the Holy Ghost call upon you that is receive the Holy Ghost that's what I am I'm sending word to you when the lion says you have you visualized one last night you've seen the power of this great I am you feel that God does not separate that's a lie called ancestry believe God will answer prayer but he will answer your prayer but that's not what the word says he wants you to be in a position that whatever you ask is just that in you asking institution in your heart you have to see what condition it is in where they have odds grudges against educate who it is whether somebody abuse you misuse you mistreated you it doesn't matter you official to God that you believe this very good let us bow our heads Heavenly Father this is something that stirring it's moving it is real presenting all that I am you can ask and get whatsoever you will this is beautiful tonight from the scriptures from your word from the truth and the finishing the seventh seal which is supposed to be way up here because your being have been revealed your nature have been revealed all about you have revealed we can present God as a protector present God as the one who stopped the Four Winds Lord and says don't hurt the air they will see and to hold those trees until my silver be sealed nothing can happen outside of the timing Lord everything has been altered and stopped until this Gentile bride be sealed and then they go across to the Jews and this Gentile that the times of the Gentiles will be over and it's finished and here we are Lord coming down to the finishing of the seventh seal oh God we're not speaking crazy stuff this is what we are called to believe this is called what we are called the act upon this is the token of the hour to have a manifestation of faith and future and knowledge and Temperance and patience and goddess under the kindness display out through our lives that we could be a living manifestation of Jesus Christ Bless the people as they get on in prayer bless them as they call upon your name father as they present all that you are and they receive from you tonight granted Lord may he your answer each prayer in Jesus I ask it amen and amen God bless your sins thanks again for being here and I know and I'm believing that God will bless you tonight I began in prayer God be with you thank you [Music] foreign

life father God that's very common connected half the way in the name of Jesus Lord May it's not a real Revival the heart of a children tonight in Jesus I leave the storm but I give you peace but I give you Grace I'll leave the heartache but I give you comfort I leave the disputes but I give you brotherly kindness I need a heat but I give you love and lead the distress but I give you hope may God bless you tonight I may Anointed Flow upon you you Commander great expectation of the Sunday service you pray that God will do more abundantly you could just ask but you keep on praying because
