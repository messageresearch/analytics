You Lord Only You Lord Only You Lord hallelujah worthy worthy Worthy is the Lamb have your own way this evening in Jesus name we ask it amen and amen God bless you if you have your Bibles like to turn to Matthew chapter 15 want to read from verse 21- 28 also Romans chapter 4 verse 19- 21 welcome this evening praise God to you here and those connected life to us we say welcome reading from Matthew chapter 15 reading verse 21 then Jesus went then and departed unto the coast of Thai and sidon and behold a woman of Canaan came out of the same coast and cried un him saying have mercy on me oh Lord thou son of David my daughter is grously vexed with the devil but he answered another word and his disciples came and besought him saying send her away for she crith after us and he answered and said I am not sent but unto the L sheep of the House of Israel then came she and worshiped him saying Lord help me but he answered and said it is not meat to take the ch's bread and cast it to dogs and she said truth Lord yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their master's table then Jesus answered and said unto her oh woman great is thy faith be it unto thee even as thou Wilt and a daughter was made whole from that very hour and reading from Romans chter 4 I want to read from verse 19 to 20 1 speaking about Abraham and being not weak in faith he considered not his own body now dead when he was about a 100 years old nearing yet the deadness of Sarah's womb he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief but was strong in faith giving glory to God and being fully persuaded that what he had promised he was able also to perform let's pray father we thank you for your holy word and and what consolation we have in the scriptures even Jesus had full confidence in the scriptures that he said destroy this body and trees I'll raise it up because of David's word I shall not suffer my Holy One to see corruption or leave his soul in Hell father help us this night this evening that we can have such full confidence and faith in your word that's it knowing that your word can fail amen heaven will pass away but your word will never pass away we thank you for the Blessed assurance that your word is true that your word is you that your word is real confirm your word this evening in Jesus name I ask it amen and amen you may be seated oh praise the name of the Lord for title this evening be perseverant for your promise of Dynamics that's the title this evening be perseverant for your promise of Dynamics and I have an inspiration from a quote uh from brother Brandon message perseverance you said what we need to today is a man and a woman who will take God by his word and be persistent with it that's what we need a man or woman that will take God by his word and be persistent with it perseverance the quality that allows someone to continue trying to do something even though it is difficult perseverant able or willing to persevere and I want to bring something from this message called perseverance and brother B was trying to bring an atmosphere of Faith to the people and he said perseverance means to be persistent to make a goal faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen we have a body like a seed a seed on the outside has a shell inside the shell has a crust or a pulp and had a germ that's the where we are Body Soul Spirit and the body has five senses say see smell here to the soul uh so forth the inside one Avenue that Avenue is the place that God set every man from Adam and Eve self-will you will to live or you will to die either one you want to it is based on free moral agency and whatever Spirit listen that you let dominate you will bring forth the fruits your life will be dominated by the inside so regardless of what people say your life is dominated by what is on the inside of you so if you let Faith dominate your life it will reflect on the outside if you let doubt dominate your life it will also reflect on the outside so many people rely on these outside senses they're fine nothing against them if they agree with the six sense this Spirit can be only two kinds one is the spirit of God the other is the spirit of the devil amen you can't serve two masters at the same time you either give one or you give the other so if you got a spirit of God in you you've got faith and you believe every word that God said now the devil is not like some people think he's mean and everything but he's deceitful the devil make you think you're right and when you disagree with the word that shows that it isn't the spirit of God because the Holy Spirit wrote the Bible there's got to be agreable with the word isn't that right so you can't hunt for wisdom you have to stay with the word to to persevere to be persistent is to make a goal you've got to set your mind on something you got to be persistent in it because you believe is the thing that you want you believe you can get it Hallelujah is Dynamics the thing you want amen do you believe you can get it yeah praise God now watch you've got to in your mind made up of what you're going to do now you cannot have faith in God without knowing the word of God or knowing something about God isn't that right blessed be the name of the Lord Christ when he was on Earth was the body of God God created this body isn't that right Solomon built him a house how be the most high don't dwell in houses May hands but a body has th prepared me now God prepared himself a body in the form of the Lord Jesus which was the Christ meaning the anointed one now all that was in God he poured into Christ he was the fullness of the godhead bodily and all of his Christ he poured into the church what is it anointed one to continue his work so Christ work must be continued to a body a bright body this time his body hallelu Hallelujah so in other words you become Ms Jesus Christ by coming into his body and you become God's mechanic on the earth isn't that right Hallelujah you believe that now God can't change if God made a decision it has to remain that way if he changes then he's human like I am he's just a man that can make a mistake but he's infinite and he's omnipotent he cannot make a mistake and be God so his first decision when man sin he forgive him on the basis of believ in the word the second man come he's got to act the same way isn't that right you have got to have faith in what you're doing amen and if your heart condemn us not then we have faith isn't that right now you cannot get yourself together because you know there's things there that God teaches that you will not cope with so if your life is not coping with the word you have a problem to get Faith to receive what God say because your heart sits there condemned but once your life begin to cope with the word every promise is yeah every promise is true every promise is amen there is no condemnation in your heart as a Believer you have access to your father isn't that right do you believe that so therefore you can't come up here and said I want to be healed and last night I was drunk out there Lord Heal me this morning I won't drink doing too much more you have got to surrender yourself you got to give yourself completely to God you have got to obey the word still completely when God speaks to a man here we go he has ambition and he has purpose and that is why you have to hear from God and that is why people follow people because they're not hearing from God so they trust the people that they following that they hear from God but they themselves don't hear themselves and that's why Jesus asks his disciples who do men say I am then he ask who do you say I am and Peter said th are the Christ Peter heard direct from Heaven oh Hallelujah he didn't ask James and anybody else he said D the Christ the son of the Living God he could pronounce his confession because he got a revelation once you get a revelation you can confess it but it got to be according to the word God only reveal his word oh oh blessed be the name of the Lord so when God speaks to a man he gives him Faith that's why amam and Joseph didn't hide Moses under the bed they take that baby and put him to sail right right in the midst of alligators they put him to sail into the AMS of pharaoh why because when God speaks to a man he has faith not fear he has Faith you know you're going to get a breakthrough you know you're going to get delivered you know you're going to get a victory you know you're going to get touched Hallelujah you know that because God put a faith inside your soul Hallelujah so when God speaks to a man he has faith in God hallelujah not what the doctor say what God Said not what the results of the test say what God Said oh Hallelujah the test is negative but God say I am positive you are going to be healed oh give the Lord Praise His People when God speaks to a man Hallelujah he has Faith he has ambition I like that ambition when you have no ambition you have problems serious problem any day is any day yesterday and today is the same don't have after tomorrow you cooled right through you have no ambition you good where you are you don't need to progress you need to pray you you don't need to do anything at all you just dear you under existence you have no growth no maturity Hallelujah you think you think you're just staying in some cocoon somewhere no ambition no goals nothing excites you nothing moves you you don't have nothing to achieve when you wake up in the morning you just wake up in the morning you don't feel to wake up and say today is a great day I'm getting closer to where I want to go to I have an name I have a vision I have a purpose that's what having a vision is that's what having an ambition is it makes you get up from Jericho and head down to Bethel it makes you get up from Bethel and head down to Jordan that's what purpose is that's what goal is it make you sick of yourself and say I want a Revival it make you sick of where you are and say where you want to [Applause] go no ambition the job you have you like it yes because you're not have no ambition to go further amen ambition mean more work more responsibility more orders more accountability you don't want to be accountability so you duck out responsibility because responsibility carries accountability ambition is a powerful thing Let My People Go and they go they have no more excuse they can't blame Pharaoh they can't blame his Horsemen they are out of Egypt no Horsemen behind them no licks behind them no whip behind them they only have amen land to cut down and Chuck and Philistines run that is all Hall and some people said give me across the border God say all right you want border across there come and fight first then go back you want to go back there go back when you're finish fight with everybody else when the Finish fight go back and take a portion before there so when God speaks to a man he has Faith that's right he has ambition and he has purpose so therefore if I know you have no purpose God has speak to you you are dead Hallelujah you are Lan you have a badg mark ludia you flashing ludia all them demons in pass pass straight he's a church member pass she straight as ever she have loud badge don't bother with that that wretched poor miserable blind they don't even know it leave them let them go and say they new message leave them let them go and go to the church leave them leave them but you see that bride they different boy they're hungering they are thirsting they are passionate [Applause] watch when God speaks to a man he gives him a purpose when God speaks to a man he gives him ambition when God speaks to a man he gave him Faith to do it right to accomplish or to achieve what his purpose is in life what God called him to do and he called us to be the Church of God not to be in a church to be the church and the church is his body I want you to catch what we talking about when we say Church we're not talking about this building we're not talking about here we're talking about being in his body that's your calling isn't that right so let's just make it our purpose in life to see that we are the Church of God let's have ambition not sit around because of Joneses what do we care about it they don't do it let's do it with anyhow so this person don't want to do something you do it this person don't want to Worship You worship this person don't want to be faithful you be faithful oh hallelujah praise God if the rest of the nation wants to sink that's up to them we want God we want to achieve we want to our faith and I want that to be our church I want that to be our attitude we want to achieve I don't want to be in the message I want to become the message I want the message live in me I want the message flow through me when they see me they must see look the message coming look the message walking you ever meet the message yet come there's a real message of Malachi 4 no argument no debate just a life that Thunders against the enemy oh hallelujah praise God when that's at the light of Trinidad oh my that's the

over my life run again see the power that has released promises Oh Glory to God run [Applause] again he run seven times you know why he run seven times because Elijah wasn't taking nothing for an answer because nothing is ready and not an answer nothing is zero nothing is nothing you can't come back with nothing come back with something he said I see a cloud like a I what run run is that small but R rain is coming I hear the song of the abundance of rain you better begin to persevere to your promise of [Applause] Dynamics each one of you each individual begin to understand begin to anoint it AR fresh you each one of you be like Simeon God must reveal to you you're going to get the Holy Ghost God must reveal to you that this revival is yours it it's not the church own it's your own come on come on now come on now I don't have permission to put people in The Bride thank you Lord or out the bride so really and truly we don't know who really is the bride right per that mystery is in God I have permission to preach the word hallu you have permission to receive it that's right believe it that's right and act upon it I have permission to be convinced this is the truth have many people right now all over the Internet they're coming against brother BR coming against the message they don't want to quote but Bram they don't believe the prophet no more all kind of foolishness but I believe this is a genuine Malachi 42 Cy Prophet that brought a message and God is allowing the critics the Skeptics the make Believers all of them to be exposed because God could only work through True Believers so after 40 plus years God filtering you see the first filter was big holes in it the big big unbelief fall right through then you have smaller holes to let but afterwards the rest that remain is True Believer all the unbelief God shaken the camp God shake it in the 70s in the 80s in the '9 shaking the camp shaking filtering because he want to get some people who become his voice who become his body who become the final Voice who become his very word itself he's got to find a people that wouldn't move one eye out from what he has promised because what he has promised he has able to perform what he has [Applause] [Music] promised what he has promised God is able to perform so I have no problem believing the cripper going to walk because God promis it I have no problem believing miss going be restored because God promis it I'm not responsible for keeping it to bringing it to past I'm responsible to make myself available to be a channel in which God can use because you can make yourself available to God if God could use a donkey God could use me come on come on now if God [Music] could that's a measly fate there a low one call it a low blue if God could use a donkeys reason God could use me donkey donkey not donkey don't have no soul God use a donkey surely God could use me yeah yeah God could fix me up Hallelujah God could make me a Ted horse yeah God could change my desires yeah I want the world I things of the world I these ties out there I find myself looking in magazines but God could change that and that's how you have to begin to speak to yourself you have to tell yourself something oh glory to God you have to tell yourself something that's the problem you're talking the wrong thing you you're un selfies tell yourself something that's a selfie to have I'm going to tell myself I'm going to arise I'm going to go to my father take a picture of yourself saying that take a little video of yourself that's the right selfie speak it to yourself I'm going to be a Christian and take a little video clip of that I'm going to be Overcomer oh give the Lord some praises and when you're feeling done play it back when your feeling low play it [Applause] back oh we worship Him worship Him let's make our purpose in life to see that we are the Church of God Moses he had ambition never was he the same after that he am he had ambition he had something to work towards to and that's why some of you would even testify invite people because you're not even inviting yourself into the presence of the king Hallelujah I understand now that's right you're cool you're dead we just need some coffins and bongs final rights because you cannot be a real Christian and not testify of how you get saved when you get saved and of your you can't have friends and don't tell them about the Lord hallelujah hallelujah you can't have neighbors and don't tell them about the Lord that's one thing I love about my wife she going to a cloth store she testify anywhere she go she inviting she testifying always looking to somewhere to give witness that's how she has always been witnessing for Jesus it have that you know oh yeah people feel the in the message I like I have no witness no more long time brother they say we're not in Sodom we are elected how did the message come to you I guess he was always born elected but all of us was in Sodom we still in Sodom the whole world is Sodom but God has said that Sodom yes why going down there is a good thing you come now in Sodom but some of us get like big shirs now we are in the message we are Abraham Royal seat we don't have to testify to nobody guess what how there going to be a resurrection if Adam Fallen race is still scattered B there watch just as we were Sinners and God come and save

that at least share amen give out multiply the bread and the fish you don't even have to multiply it it's already multiplied you have so much books and tapes when last you hand out a book when last you give out a tape when last you testify to somebody about love of God about the grace of God oh my so brother brandham oh watch all the days of his life he served God to deliver those people as long as he was getting along all right what he cared about was those people laying their suffering that was Moses burden amen he was living his life to deliver the people amen with his mental conception his intellectual Revelation he killed one man and ran but Moses was packed with a burden do you have a burden today a burden in this church a burden for Dynamics a burden for Revival a burden for breakthrough a burden to see people delivered I'm not talking about talking about people that is the easy one you don't even have a burden for that just open your mouth and Yap I'm talking about a burden that you going say you know what I know my sister in trouble I know my brother in trouble I'm going to pray for them I'm going to ask for God to deliver them I'm going to call them I'm going to help them I'm going to encourage them I'm going to back them up I'm going to hold them up even if they kind of get somebody on the phone or what not they can still get them up in prayer lift them up before God isn't that right so brother say people God still here people crying out unto God and you talk about the sister the woman who died and she swallow something called radium and years after they still find radium thinging on her bones and he's saying this here he said watch oh brother if radium have that kind of effect endless how much more will endless Eternal Supernatural all powerful infinite almighty God have the effect this all powerful God is waiting for somebody with Bly Faith to step out and challenge the enemy on the basis of his word hallu oh Hallelujah when Elijah they from second handed row after his whole heart's desire was to get that promise he wanted the promise that was his motive that was all his hearts that was his life that was his intent everything all every hung on getting that promise that's the whole every time you wake up in the morning the promise Simeon the promise Abraham the promise ABR going to mark it but he's standing to promise at how you going I'm going great but God promised me hallelujah hallu hallelujah you go to Abraham house you have a sign I am promised a baby not everybody like that sign who would like that sign everybody say you're old man but Abram only laughing and rejoicing because he already had Isaac is was in faith ins inside his soul so he could shout he can't produce it yet but is a revelation to him Revelation comes to the individual listen you have any internet called to share you can share this and share that you can't share a revelation hall Hall I'll say it again you cannot share a revelation it have no button to click share with Revelation you could testify your Revelation but Revelation is personal and individual Revelation is your own that's your button when God revealed it to you it's yours now Faith is so when Abraham it was quickened to him his precious wife he is so close to it wasn't quicking to her that is why she could have a good laugh but that was his wife she could laugh because she doesn't have what God revealed to Abraham and when God revealed it to you your sister could laugh your mother could laugh your brother could laugh your husband could laugh but you can't laugh because you have a revelation of of what God has revealed to you could we say amen amen here the prophet now I'm persuaded that we are not sincere about the things that we're talking about if your whole motive this morning rest upon giving God praise for my healing I'm determined to be healed by the power of God this is brother brandom now this is the attitude you have to have I am determined to live a Christian Life I am determined to walk in peace with God I am determined to do it I don't get what mother say what church say what Pastor say what anybody else say what the world say I am determined that's the singl of my heart you are going to get somewhere then oh hallelujah praise God and brother B talk about Elijah we he it this morning second hand robe don't you put somebody else robe that's M eaten with doubts where all these defeats and Superstition and ups and down has put holes in it leaking all through put on the robe of the Conqueror don't trust in your church who wants sought salvation by the baptism Holy Ghost who once taught Divine Healing and now we have morth and doubts put on the robe of him that never lost the battle and you're on your way to Jordan brother what you need you'll find you lack to when you come to Jordan you may be taught you may be smart you may have doctor of divinity you have PhD philosophy doctor of Latin all kind of degrees you may have The Robe of the Methodist Church you may have the Pentecostal church only a secondary to begin with some man-made dogmas to come for like that but even if you're a Christian he said today what up some preacher he said today with many school and educated Scholars with many men who can tear the Bible apart and set it together in mathematics many men who can tell you great things in the way of teaching who knows Bible History to the very moment who could tell you that the hour hell was lit and the hour it went out that's how deep these mens are they could tell the our hell God it and oh it went out they can tell you these things they got spiritual baptism all kind of thing but when he come to Jordan to the face the critical world what did he cry hallu about elishah where is the god of Elijah here we it wasn't the robe of Elijah that done it it was the power of God of Elijah that done it and the thing that the world needs today this morning is the power of the god of Elijah you might have spoken tongues you might have run up the floor watch a second hand robe was all right but he needed a fresh call in his heart from God he needed a fresh anointed from God hallelujah he wore a second-handed robe when he come to the river but he needed a brand new firstand call from God a firstand power to perform the Miracles Hallelujah acts: 18 you shall receive power after the Holy Ghost come upon you isn't that right oh blessed be so what are they looking for what more do you want what does the church want he said everybody looking for messiah what does the church really want what are you looking for ask what am I looking for what are you looking for here he said we already got it God give it to us it's his promise for the hour that is what you supposed to be looking for the promise of the hour what's the promise Dynamics you shall receive power you already got the promise hallelujah amen listen to this we look in the Bible we see everywhere to the Bible anointed ones come on and make that would live again right in the hour for the hour we have got the Messiah it's him the word he said in the beginning was the word it's just waiting for somebody with faith to anoint it and make it live again oh that's beautiful so think about it now all the promises are there that's the Messiah is right here amen he's not coming amen he is here amen the Messiah is the word amen the promise for the hour just waiting for somebody with faith to anoint it and faith is based on forgiveness oh Hallelujah so therefore you still have to come through brotherly love you still have to come to the honey to have the faith anointed let's take a look at that woman she came to Jesus she had a lot of Vex with the devil right oh she had plenty of disappointments her disciples couldn't handle her and then Jesus said it's not fit to take the children's bread and cast it the door but when faith is anchored you could When Faith is in your soul you don't have disappointments because you just bind disappointments when Jesus said it's not fit to take the children's bread and cast the dog that didn't throw her off she didn't stop coming to church she didn't give up on God she stood right there you see Faith makes you stand Faith make you persevere Faith have I'm not going to give up I'm going to stay right here till something happens that's what faith does that's how Faith Works real Faith perseveres real Faith press to watch The Promise so the Bible said Abraham staggered not at the promise of God to unbelief but was strong worshiping he was strong praising he was strong smiling when he come to church because he knew every day Isaac was coming closer every day the promise was coming more real every day he was nearer to his Revival every day he was nearer to his Deliverance every day he was nearer to his healing every day he was nearer to his healing that's what faith does the church s spiritually dead God gone the hours pass them they in a slump hardly know what to do one running this way one that way and he every promise that God made in the Bible every every one of them is laying Just As Good As It Ever Was Hallelujah GL what's make the church like this laia she has to come that way oh praise God now here we go from the absolute every great achievement has been tied to an absolute amen not achievement if a great achievement amen and there's got to be something a final time post and no man cannot by no means achieve anything unless they recognize there's an absolute and Paul and an absolute his absolute was a Christ centered life so what brother BR is saying you can achieve much if you don't come to an absolute well I don't know if this is right because somebody doing this somebody doing that you have no absolute absolute is the red light red light cannot mean go that going to be massive confusion amen red supposed to mean absolutely stop green means absolutely go that is an absolute ire absolute man is out man is out is a goal is no goal blow the whistle you're out off the field walk whatever the ire say is final if you don't have ire it going to be riot in every match so you have to have the ire you have to have the lights you have to have an absolute one time Hitler was an absolute ever Hitler say everybody yes sir no sir Hitler is the boss but that was Bo absolute but we have an absolute absolute is the word don't know should say this here but you know have scales B hat a fall scale hit somebody with false scale false thing on the scale and some people use false scales they use one scale for themselves and one scale and change skilles quick to change to judge somebody else so they using scales to suit theel that's not an absolute you're shifing scal you shift in the weight the same way you judge you have to go consistent you have to use the same Plum line you can't say this is for my family and that's not for yours this is for this church not for that church no it got to be the same scale and when you see the same scale that's absolute the word so you don't have feelings in it and emotions it's just the word hallelujah that is what an absolute is the word oh praise God I'm going to wrap up here the reason that Paul had a Christ centered life because he personally lay aside his teaching and he personally met Christ I like that Hallelujah he really met Christ so he wasn't just taught and had knowledge and information and Revelation he met Christ by way of the pillar of fire and when you meet Christ and the only way you're going to ever know him is to meet him to know him is life not even to know his word as good as it may be you've got to know him to know him life to know him his life and when your life change you make you make it make you do thing you ordinar will not do he says like a ship a ship have an absolute that's the anchor when the ship is toss in you can put the anchor it will hold and if Christ here we go is your absolute you ATT tie to him in a manner no matter what anybody says how hard the persecution gets how bad the storm seems to be how it looks impossible for it to happen it something has to happen to you Christ becomes your absolute any promise in the Bible becomes your absolute if you are sick you are praying for healing and something strikes you I've got it nothing going to shake you from it amen amen here we go what the Christian needs today in this atomic age in this time of incity you need something besides just an experience of joining church that's right you need an anchor that's right an absolute that you know that's right because here we go churches will fail right amen am might want to admit it but that is what the prophet said I am not a prophet I believe a prophet so if he said that I have to believe that churches will fail people will fail but Christ cannot fail so Christ is the absolute to the believer and if Christ is your absolute you are tied to him not the church Church to him so if the church fail that's not [Applause] you you heard what David said don't 10,000 fall on my right side shall not be moved that is them that have nothing to do with me that is 10,000 on my right side I am on this side they on that side that's David the Lord is with me th run staff they comfort me don't prepares the table for me in the presence of my enemy David had a relationship with God a personal one when he get in trouble I done to De oh Lord have I Sinn David know he sined against God so he came to God and confessed restore unto me the Jo Hallelujah David recognize the joy God but he know he's a son restore unto me the joy God are not feeling good oh give the Lord Praises so you do have joy well the time you repent and ask God to restore your joy and when you repent and ask God to restore Here Comes Your Joy am then David said I was glad when they said unto me what let us go into the house of the Lord then they get a joy to come to service you get a joy to come to church you get a joy to worship a joy to hear the word of God it becomes your [Applause] joy amen so you know if the red doesn't mean red he said no watch it going have a big traffic jam it's kind of rude way to express it but yet you know what I'm trying to say notice the reason we have gotten to it there because every one of us make our own absolute that kind that kind of selfie absolute they already making their own we have our own absolute each church has its absolute each group has its own absolute and they say each one of them say we are the truth the way we got it all you ain't got nothing to do with it you and the minority we are the greatest group and people do that you ought not to do that amen until it's like the days of Judges where every man does what's right in his sight he thinks he right in his own sight but there's a way that seem right unto man and the end thereof is the way of death but the Bible said people did that because the word of God was precious they didn't have a prophet and if we didn't have a prophet message that we could go back to to tie ourselves back to it we' be in big trouble he said we want to live life is the greatest treasure that man can have and now we've got to find what is life he said my word is life he didn't say yesterday today and forever you have got to get the Living Word in you to have the Living God in you because the word here is God when is made flesh in you made spirit and life in you when it goes into your flesh and your faith and becomes life right not just your faith it have to go in your flesh too the word have to singe you the word have to become part of you and I say you have your hand you can raise it that's your hand that's how the word has to be part of you you must want it to live you see when you come to church and go back home and it doesn't apply to your life you're not getting involved you're not get you have to get mixed up with the word then it have to come saturated in your being it have to become part of you where you're feasting on it you're living on it you're talking about it amen tomorrow you could testify about the service you could share back things from it if tomorrow you forget everything you know what going on you're not focused you have to be able to you know yeah Dynamics is mine I am supposed to connect with it that's my promise that's the promise of my father he's sending Dynamics to me give a promise another time of life he going to visit me I know I'm going to get a brick I know I'm going to get yes I have a hot temper but I know God going cool it down amen hallelujah yeah some some people Ned a certain way and you I find your gosh I wish I person that person cool but that person too cool they cool till they cold so you don't want to go on that have extremes people are Ned a certain way and that person fire temper woo they could fight a bus they could fight more than one bus they have that but God call all of them the cool cold and the fire hot temper Buzz all of that is God's people too and God love them the same you know God will have I love Mr cool Mr Cool real cool and Mr noisy and Rowdy I don't love him that much no God don't have that everybody have a place for Jacob was drama you know oh yeah Jacob and so was Gideon also all them guys are drama Joshua was drama too isn't that right Gideon say if the Lord be with me if the Lord be where are the Miracles that wasn't easy you know Abraham was piece of drama too God tell Abraham I your shield and great reward and Abram said what reward see I go CH God say talking you talk you're playing rude come count the stars then come back and let's talk because so shall your seed be Abram and living to see all them STS come for but God says so shall your seed be you could say what you want could think what you want if I say so I am God my word will not return void and you could say what you want God going to heal you if God say he going to heal you and God going to deliver your family I don't care what they doing right now today that has nothing to do with what God promis oh glory to God God have them so in some condition oh my feeling inspired right now there are conditions all around us God set it up that way he s the mountain so high he said the valley so low he said the river so why to prove he is [Applause] God you he that he set the mountain so high he set the valley Hallelujah soow prise God when it comes into your flesh and your faith and becomes life then you are living example you are an Epistle of God oh blessed be the Lord God is right his word is right right others are not right that's right along as they stay with the word when you leave the word you leave God God is watching over his word to vindicate it to make it real and when a man takes a word of God no matter how little his faith is if he won't mix it with unbelief it will bring him out to the light oh praise the name of the Lord and that's how you are Christian by birth when you are born of the spirit of God persistent yes but when you can achieve something all men through all the ages have been able to achieve when they are persistent if they faith in what they're trying to achieve it depends upon what your achievement is it depends upon what you're trying to do oh blessed be the name of the Lord today and here we go I'm closing musician come up please what we need today is men and women who will take God by his word and be persistent with it hallu Samson Hallelujah he was persistent as long as he could feel those seven LS around him Hallelujah so Samson wasn't easy we know that Samson was quite a character but as long as he could feel seven Lu he felt Invincible you couldn't you can't fault him for that because God say as long as them SE dear I am with you that is my contract with you you have Seven Locks I'm with you how you moving I have to back you up so Samson moving man he moving you know oh yes he moving so much he move out of go God's program and God's will when he lost it I see after a while s believe is his power because when he Li tell him God tell me now where the secret now know you have a secret because I the seven SE I know silence there nothing saying tell me something what's going on there he save your time with this and then he break the cords after start to lie but the power's still there start to do little small wrong but the power's still there start to break the rules but the power is still there cuz God say seven I'm with you if you all seven when he finally break and he tell her make sure he get it all seven cut off so now he's ordinary all of a sudden this man that conquer land conquered Gates conquer the enemy be he find himself ordinary same muscles same man same books same tapes same message ordinary no unction no inspiration no vision no fire no power no presence thank you all all of a sudden he realize is so that is how it is be now the eyes out grinding at the Mill what a pitiful condition what a shame to come to the spot after serving God after to be under his glory and anointing to be stripped to be just like another man it makes no sense God called you out all these years not to be ordinary no we are called to break into the supernatural realm where all things are possible do you believe that Hallelujah now watch I'm closing with this H Hallelujah Samson was very persistent as long as he could feel those seven lucks around him he know that the promise was God given him and every man and woman could be persistent as Samson as long as you can feel what that power of Promise around you of God power of promise promise say it Power Of Promise say it again power of Promise as long as you could feel the power of the promise of Dynamics ah the power of the promise of virtue powerful service the power of being baptized with the Holy Ghost as long as you could feel that power you could persevere towards your inheritance you could persevere toward watch your Dynamics let us stand and praise and worship the Lord H and you can be perseverant as long as you know you got that promise in your heart that faith that told you when you're sitting there that faith that says I am healed
