========================================

people looking depressed. That's the worst &gt;&gt; in this message. &gt;&gt; Preaching and people looking depressed. &gt;&gt; How many people look depressed? &gt;&gt; Read what the Bible say, rejoice. &gt;&gt; The Bible said they were in the upper room praising and blessing God continually. &gt;&gt; When the wise men saw this, they rejoice with Bible scripture with exceeding great joy. &gt;&gt; They not normal smiling signing, you know. They not that exceeding great joy. What God doing? He's roughing you up. Let your rejoice be it happen. Let your shout be happen. You're not waiting to get a breakthrough to shout. You're getting your shout now. You shout and your breakthrough coming after. You shout your healing coming after you. Praise God. And you Hallelujah. All right, let's go. So Job now the only thing had to happen for was for inspiration to strike him. &gt;&gt; So these guys were positioning place and ready for the anointing to strike him. &gt;&gt; When he strike him so they could speak, right? &gt;&gt; That's the church. Here we go. &gt;&gt; If it's in order. &gt;&gt; Oh, the church have to come in order. &gt;&gt; Yes. You don't hear much about that, but that is in the word. The church itself have to come into order. &gt;&gt; What order? Man's order or God's order? &gt;&gt; Order. &gt;&gt; In God's order. He said what? Watch. If it's if it's in order, it got the mechanics ready. &gt;&gt; It only need the dynamics. &gt;&gt; Then he said this tonight, if we could get the mechanics ready, &gt;&gt; get our hearts right. &gt;&gt; So that the mechanics then, &gt;&gt; yes, not just text and mystery and words and quotes. No, get your heart right. There we go. The things that we can do &gt;&gt; and the things that you can do is the labor part, &gt;&gt; is the sanctification part, is the working part, &gt;&gt; is the hard part, is the grinding part. That is what you could do because you cannot produce dynamics. &gt;&gt; Come on, preach back to me. Preach back to somebody. Let's go a little deeper here. Watch this. Follow him. What? Follow him in baptism. Follow him in every order he told us to do. Get every mechanic ready and stand there. &gt;&gt; Then we are ready for dynamics &gt;&gt; to be lit off. &gt;&gt; How you ready for dynamics and you order against somebody &gt;&gt; that can't work. &gt;&gt; You have condemning you. &gt;&gt; You know you have a hindrance. You know you have some obstacle inside your life. &gt;&gt; You have to be clear &gt;&gt; about your own objective motive desires and everything else. Look at those brothers. When say have oil somewhere &gt;&gt; and then brother said around if we get tell us where he said we can't use the gift of commercial. &gt;&gt; You see if we get we go do this for the Lord and that for the Lord. &gt;&gt; All right. He went and after they get a little oil what for the Lord? &gt;&gt; None for the Lord. &gt;&gt; They gone only to find out they get it dripping &gt;&gt; and it drop after a while. &gt;&gt; See God was testing them. They say they say with the mouth they do for the lord and when things people say you know when they get a bless they can do that for the lord which lord &gt;&gt; they are the lord &gt;&gt; they serve their own self &gt;&gt; you see and afterwards now somebody come now and strike the main vein &gt;&gt; to vindicate the prophet did see oil down there &gt;&gt; but them other guys church folks mind you &gt;&gt; they had the wrong motive and objective &gt;&gt; something was &gt;&gt; called heart issues &gt;&gt; is the inside job &gt;&gt; oh praise Go as B say get heart attack there inside job &gt;&gt; won't heart attack you in inside job. &gt;&gt; So watch then we are ready for dynamics to be lit off and only God can do that. So there's no need to manufacture nothing. &gt;&gt; When when Elijah challenged them, let God answer my father and be God and them fellas carry on because they're custom doing stuff. Them fellas is not they're afraid for the challenge. You know them seven old tell them fellas jump and cut their self and my god they carry on. They wasn't dead believers like me. No. Oh the word on fire. They off the word on fire. Blow off the word on fire. That's a different kind of group on When he like when he feel so he say go like go for a trip boy he go to bagel &gt;&gt; or go by the beach where God go you understand I'm saying go a little louder because he not hearing because I see no fire when his time come he say pour water he restore the altar he said pour water he said pour water again because I want them to know there's no kerosene there's no diesel oil there nothing on no wood there I want you to know it's water water it's so wet The fire had to come from God. Okay. The Lord I shout and God take the word. Seven seals, seven thunders. And we wet. We dripping with water. Water. Word. Word. Water. Water. They laugh at us. They mock us. Let them laugh. But we dripping with water. Water. But one day the Holy Ghost and fire. The Holy Ghost and power. Oh, hallelujah. Let the God that answer my fire. Let that God be gone. This is going to be a short quick message tonight. Don't worry. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So watch when you get your heart right. When you follow everything you could do, you in baptism whatever and you stand there, we are ready for the dynamics and only God can do that. Here we go. And this detail now that's to drop into your heart that faith &gt;&gt; that says I am now healed. &gt;&gt; That's it. So when when brother pray for the blind man and then spend come back in the prayer line because he hear other people heal say you're healed. &gt;&gt; Now he's a Catholic his faith have to hold on to &gt;&gt; his faith hold on to so by stripes I'm healed. By strip I'm heal. So he's by stripe I'm healed. What is happening there? Mental faith at work. &gt;&gt; His mouth &gt;&gt; his mind. &gt;&gt; His mouth his mind. &gt;&gt; By faith I'm healed. By faith I'm healed. By faith, I'm healed. And one day in the barber saloon, it dropped onto his hand &gt;&gt; and he was healed. &gt;&gt; Then he jumped on the barber chair and the man finish cutting here. &gt;&gt; You understand what I'm saying? Then that make it half z cut him. He's out because he's seeing now. He could cut his own hair. He's out of the barber chair because something connect from here to here. This is the problem. This is the unbelief. Subconscious unbelief. Unbelief you don't even know it's there. But when the word hit you, then you realize, wait a minute, when I look at myself, I have problems. I have issues. Do I believe what God said? It shall come to pass afterwards. I will pour out. I will restore. Oh, the Lord, I shout. When them conquer them, crack the teeth and break down the God's tree. When they come to the end, &gt;&gt; they say no more is a stump. &gt;&gt; They walk away. &gt;&gt; And God wait for it to come to a stop. And brother Van said nothing is stopping it now. I will restore Luther Wesley Pentecost William Bron and here comes the bride. Nothing going to stop this bride. It have false anointed. It have unbelievers. It have interpreters. It have bes come the message writing trying to take over trying to make unity and not unity. said faith just unity and if you don't hear him he vex he upset &gt;&gt; go say unity you know he say unity of defaith &gt;&gt; then you have to go back to def faith &gt;&gt; to get it united &gt;&gt; go give the lord a shout and you don't have six faith and four faith and three faith you know it only have one faith even has one lord &gt;&gt; them crazy but seven thunders give that one faith &gt;&gt; okay give the lord a shout in the house that's a Reserve faith. God leave that only for the brain. The church can have everything else. They can have trumpets, vials, woes, woman of the sun, pope, all kind of thing. They can have this mystery, hidden mystery, underground mystery, untuck mystery, all kind of mystery they could have. But you see the seven thunders that the mighty angel came and threw out. Oh, give the Lord a shout. It have resurrection in that. It have rapture in that. It have change your body in that. Oh, give the Lord some praises. I am preaching all this for no tribulation. Hallelujah. I'm preaching to lead correctly. [Applause] &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; What will happen Sunday? Hallelujah. All right. Now, but preach perfect man preach blasphemous names. You can't really clarify or get it clean without really studying blasphemous names. blasphemerous names give clarity to what he preach in the morning and then the blasphemous names. No bless morning. Okay, it's bright. Then he preach that. So watch he said now when you talk about he say automobile. Now I've got several mechanics in the church and he said I'm not a mechanic but it has spo coils plugs points valves &gt;&gt; to make up the automobile. &gt;&gt; Now when you talk about the baptism of the Holy Spirit &gt;&gt; there's a lot goes with that. &gt;&gt; He say there's a lot that goes with that. It have coils, blood and points into in the Holy Ghost too &gt;&gt; to make it up. It's not just one thing. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Now, Peter, now he is putting it back in the word. &gt;&gt; Peter said faith first. &gt;&gt; Now watch. Add to your faith, virtue, virtue, knowledge, knowledge, temperance, and from this bring in seven church ages and so on like that. Amen. Then he said he has built a bride, born a bride. Hear the words, begotten a bride on earth for Christ. And the same way he beggets his bride, he has begotten individuals. &gt;&gt; So the church ages is a reflection of what's supposed to work in you. &gt;&gt; The church age people didn't wasn't conscious and aware what they were living out. &gt;&gt; But they were rocking Satan's kingdom, &gt;&gt; thundering out God's life &gt;&gt; in every age. &gt;&gt; And what God sent the prophet to do was to gather the entire life. [Applause] Now the Holy Ghost was born at the river Euphrates &gt;&gt; because of priest and dogmas &gt;&gt; like an electric wire. You can't put a PVC pipe and say current flowing through that. &gt;&gt; Water will flow through a PVC pipe &gt;&gt; not current. &gt;&gt; It have to have a wire for it to flow. &gt;&gt; And through the ages because the word was broken the wire was cut. &gt;&gt; What brother Brandon did? He stitched the wires together &gt;&gt; connected through seven ages. And once the wire line up and he jam it and flick the switch, &gt;&gt; it start to flow through the current start to flow. &gt;&gt; And this is the same thing he wanted in his last day that he said there is my spirit flowing freely from them men. &gt;&gt; That's why I keep saying the first sign of the ministry of Jesus Christ is virtue &gt;&gt; going out &gt;&gt; from the man's body. Because when virtue come out of Christ, the woman say he say he say um she say um he said who touched me? &gt;&gt; Watch this. The disciples say everybody touching you. Where's the point? &gt;&gt; They missed the boat clean. &gt;&gt; He said no. I felt I felt a withdrawal. &gt;&gt; Somebody pulled something out of me. &gt;&gt; That woman pulled virtue. And when Jesus saw the woman, he said thy faith. &gt;&gt; Look where virtue is in the pyramid. And look where faith is. Faith is at the bottom. And what's next? &gt;&gt; Virtue. So faith pulls virtue. &gt;&gt; Virtue is power. &gt;&gt; Power to stop the blood issue. Power to heal you. Power to give you the breakthrough. Give me a scripture. As many as receive him to them give me power to become. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Is that instant power to become? So God give you a start &gt;&gt; that you could run to the finish. &gt;&gt; So with your faith you pull down virtue. &gt;&gt; Virtue left me feeling weak. &gt;&gt; Brother, now these things here talking about the temperance and everything else virtues must be in the Christian. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Before the Holy Spirit &gt;&gt; ever seals them. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And makes a complete unit. &gt;&gt; He's not talking about the baptism. Now, &gt;&gt; he's talking about the person of Christ. &gt;&gt; He's talking about the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Come in and seal the virtues in. &gt;&gt; Then you become a living moving monument. &gt;&gt; Then you become a vindicated son. Then you become a vindicated daughter. Every devil in hell know your name. &gt;&gt; Okay. The Lord I shout ah Then &gt;&gt; sister gave him a dream. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; a shepherd. &gt;&gt; We know the dream. &gt;&gt; And she was wondering if she had the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; And in the dream, she said a dream, she was up on a mountain. &gt;&gt; Now, if I didn't feel it, let alone we know it. If I didn't feel tonight, I was going to say it. &gt;&gt; Is a reason why I saying this thing tonight. &gt;&gt; I want to show the context of the message. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. She dreamed she was up a mountain and this mountain she says now she saw a large man standing there with work clothes on sleeve rolled up bailing bailing the most pure water she ever seen &gt;&gt; pouring into this box &gt;&gt; this rock box sitting on the top of the mountain and the rock box would not hold the water &gt;&gt; it rolled right out of there and just boiled up all the trash and sticks and everything in there and boiled it out and rolled down the mountain and it rolled over her feet and she was standing there right in that stuff only it didn't stick to her &gt;&gt; and when she asked why the box didn't hold it the man said that is not water &gt;&gt; that's the Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; nothing will hold it &gt;&gt; and then he went and got another big bucket it was full of honey &gt;&gt; and he poured honey into there said now it will hold this. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do people still believe this message? &gt;&gt; Do people still believe what you're seeing here? &gt;&gt; Now, she thought the box was a rock box. It was going to burst out and spill the honey. But it didn't. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It finally stuck together &gt;&gt; and held it. &gt;&gt; She turned, went down the mountain, going down the mountain. She stopped at the bottom of the mountain. She saw five streams of pure crystal water not contaminated with the things it has went through. &gt;&gt; Isn't that the dream, Sister Shepherd? No more. picked up the letter and opened it, I saw her dream. &gt;&gt; So now she wrote the dream but now he's seen a vision &gt;&gt; of the dream itself. &gt;&gt; So that is how we end up interpreting the dream. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right, let's go on now. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now hear how he backdrop this dream. Now you cannot make a holy church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's no such thing as a holy church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So so so you sisters wearing just above the knee. Well, I I I know that there's somebody coming inside here somebody seat that will tolerated and they judging the whole church by one person that they don't even know if they are saints you know or just come inside just get baptized in Jesus name you see what I'm saying &gt;&gt; and yet this prophet said you cannot make a holy church &gt;&gt; there is no such thing as a holy church &gt;&gt; or a holy organization &gt;&gt; the holy spirit can be preached in it &gt;&gt; but in there you find good bad &gt;&gt; renegade Yes. &gt;&gt; Indifferent &gt;&gt; and everything else. Everything else means everything else. &gt;&gt; I would like to talk about everything else tonight. There's an ex sermon all together. Let me leave everything else alone. &gt;&gt; So an organization will not hold it. &gt;&gt; You can't say we got it. &gt;&gt; None of the rest of them has it. and minister preaching that &gt;&gt; not exact words but their life and the reflection of arrogance and pride on their believers reflect that they believe this &gt;&gt; I want to repeat that &gt;&gt; they're not saying these exact words they pull pit but their life and the arrogance and attitude and pride of their believers reflect this &gt;&gt; that we have it &gt;&gt; and the others don't have it so we are special and the rest of our like we &gt;&gt; we are living the rest is king That's exactly right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So watch. So an organization will not hold it. You can't say we got it. None the rest of them has it. No sir. The Holy Spirit is poured out on individuals. &gt;&gt; Well, that should make you shout tonight. That should make you This should be the greatest revelation strike in you that the Holy Ghost, you don't need a church for the Holy Ghost because the Holy Ghost is import. You can pour it in your bathroom. You can pour it in your bedroom. You can pour it in the drawing room. You can pour it in the kitchen. He can pour it on your in your car. &gt;&gt; You get p on you in the church. &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit is poured on individuals. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So the man pouring the water was brother Brown. This was the seals, &gt;&gt; the thunders, &gt;&gt; the mysteries, &gt;&gt; the word, &gt;&gt; the revelation because the mysteries of God come from God is the word of God. And this word was supposed to boil out &gt;&gt; trash &gt;&gt; in order to receive &gt;&gt; the honey. &gt;&gt; I know people make light. You know anytime I talk about honey broadcast can somebody tell me I have fake b can them check my ban fake them have a thermometer that checks whether b is real or not any leave that alone now look where brotherly kindness is &gt;&gt; and on top of brotherly kindness is the holy spirit &gt;&gt; therefore you can't access holy spirit &gt;&gt; outside of brotherly kindness &gt;&gt; so let's change Jesus prayer a bit when you stand praying &gt;&gt; for Charity &gt;&gt; forgive &gt;&gt; if you have ought against &gt;&gt; any. &gt;&gt; Let's change it further. When you start praying for dynamics &gt;&gt; because if you can't manifest brotherly kindness is short on mechanics &gt;&gt; because bly kindness the blood have to be displayed. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Because that's a virtue for our age. &gt;&gt; God put it correctly. So the bride Yeah. Listen carefully. Have to be positionally placed. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; On the seventh step. &gt;&gt; Amen. to receive the groom. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Do you get it tonight? &gt;&gt; Let me say it again. Almost there. The bride has to be placed &gt;&gt; positionally sir. &gt;&gt; On the seventh step &gt;&gt; to receive the groom. &gt;&gt; What is below brotherly kind is godliness. &gt;&gt; To be like God. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's a godly man. &gt;&gt; And yet on top of that godliness, God say you have to get some burden on top of that. &gt;&gt; Godliness alone can't make it. &gt;&gt; Give the Lord a shout in the house. &gt;&gt; You have to act to godliness. Brotherly kindness. God have to see the spirit of forgiveness. &gt;&gt; Look at Joseph. The quoting him wasn't by chance. Look at Joseph when his brothers came. Now if Joseph was a train when he brothers come wood, not worthy would cut a piece of wood and licks. But you're so wicked so long. That mean unconverted unchang. It's plenty years since 17. You mean change? Like that temple? They old now and the same vi temper and anger talk about the man dying and the man of foolishness. That don't change you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you're a foolish man, you're dead. A foolish man. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Joseph says to his brethren, these wicked men, they were wicked. &gt;&gt; It wasn't wicked. He told those wicked brethren, "God, not you, God, send me ahead &gt;&gt; to preserve life." &gt;&gt; That's a powerful man. &gt;&gt; That's a man who have a lot of grace. But &gt;&gt; because that they make him learn a new language. They make him hit a new culture. They make him leave him in a whole new environment. They let his father grieve and father suffer in tears because he lost his favorite son. And yet he was sent ahead to save the entire world &gt;&gt; by putting a pyramid in Egypt. And when all other bands are empty, &gt;&gt; only Joseph B of green. Hey. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. How much have a time tonight when all the bands are empty? Only Jose B of green. What was Joseph sent for? To warn them. &gt;&gt; We have seven years plenty coming &gt;&gt; and seven years of famine. &gt;&gt; Get ready. Get ready. Get ready. Oh, give the Lord a shout. Malachi 4. What did he come to do? Judgment is coming. &gt;&gt; Get ready. Get ready. &gt;&gt; Today Putin had a dry run of nuclear warming warning for the entire nation &gt;&gt; because Trump Trump sent a nuclear he say he sent a nuclear submarine closer to Russia. &gt;&gt; Now if he didn't say that he might do nothing but now that they say that as you see that. &gt;&gt; So, alarms went out all over Russia and they know what to do. &gt;&gt; We don't even have a basement. &gt;&gt; There are bunkers in &gt;&gt; things to go around to hide, to protect. We We We don't even have a subterranean. Forget it. &gt;&gt; Bible says is a small thing in court. &gt;&gt; My lord. So we find out that the messenger, right? So watch this man. Okay. So this tabernacle we will see that's where she comes to church. This tabernacle, listen to these words &gt;&gt; and you could see if people really believe the prophet George. This tabernacle is not a Holy Ghost tabernacle. There is no such a thing. &gt;&gt; Individuals that come into this church is Holy Ghost tabernacle. &gt;&gt; There are tabernacles that contain the Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; but not the church in the body &gt;&gt; or a group. &gt;&gt; Therefore, it runs out. &gt;&gt; So that's why the church the box couldn't hold the Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; because the Holy Ghost is not going into that box. and boil the trash out, but the Holy Ghost goes into individuals. [Applause] &gt;&gt; So watch, they are tabernacles contain the Holy Ghost, not the church and the body or group. Therefore, it runs out. Mission card, please. Now this man, here we go. Who was pouring the water, the messengers to the church, &gt;&gt; pouring the message into the church, &gt;&gt; that is the seals, &gt;&gt; that's the thunders, &gt;&gt; that is the mysteries, both written and hidden. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They like to talk that talk. So I talk that talk too. &gt;&gt; It have written mysteries and hidden mysteries. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. So that the whole message &gt;&gt; was poured into the church &gt;&gt; and the objective of it was to clean it out &gt;&gt; to pour honey &gt;&gt; because the Holy Ghost is only coming on &gt;&gt; honey. &gt;&gt; Let them fight that. That's why that's why God tell John the one &gt;&gt; who you see the dove &gt;&gt; resting and remaining &gt;&gt; not one without order &gt;&gt; because sometime the dove rest and it not remaining &gt;&gt; true &gt;&gt; you see what I see a dove hit him &gt;&gt; and you look back so just gone the dove can't stay &gt;&gt; when you start to react so you catch so doing it this way he said do it the other know meow coming &gt;&gt; there a wolf you understand I'm saying so that dove landing think a cat think humble think it like and when the arrogance come up and the temper come up and the attitude come up dove say I gone &gt;&gt; and the dog fire the dog on a on a little waiting he's waiting for it to change &gt;&gt; he's waiting for you to adjust he's waiting for you to repent he's waiting for you to get a different kind of attitude and atmosphere and spirit because the lamb only hanging up with dove. Dove only hanging up with lamb. &gt;&gt; Dumb and w don't mix together. &gt;&gt; Let me finish here. &gt;&gt; This man was pouring the water, the message of the church, pouring a message into the church. But what was the water doing? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It was boiling all the trash out of it. &gt;&gt; That is what the Holy Spirit does. &gt;&gt; It boils it out. &gt;&gt; Now the honey. There we go. This is brother teacher not this brother over teacher the honey represented brotherly love &gt;&gt; brotherly kindness which is this age &gt;&gt; and you say I shout like brother Jones I shout like brother Jones sometimes but let something happen to him your heart is broke because we can obtain brotherly kindness and feeling for one another. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why you can't be brotherly kindness by yourself. You can shake your hand and happy birthday to me. You wash in the mirrors and tell yourself I love you. That makes no sense. In a group is where there are issues, problems, you know, disappointment. That is where you get to exercise this thing called brotherly kindness. Why do you care for that brother? Because you broke bread with him. &gt;&gt; You were at the altar. I'm going to close. You fellowship with him. You shook his hands. Here we go. You worship with him. He's your brother. Now, he might do something in the flesh that you would disagree with. And because you just kind of stay which you ought to do and shun him a little bit but in the bottom of the heart if something happened to that brother it will nearly kill you. &gt;&gt; He said no and then he went and continuing on. Oh my. I'll close with this quote here. We continue on Sunday. Before this body can ever be perfected the spirit will bring it in submission to God &gt;&gt; to make you. That's a big one. &gt;&gt; It's a war all the time. A constant war. Paul said, "When I will do good, evil is near me." There's a constant war. The flesh against the spirit. &gt;&gt; But he prophesied that the spirit will bring it in submission. &gt;&gt; You got a soul beside your senses. God never gave you those senses to trust him with. God gave you his spirit to trust. Your senses is only to contact, see, smell, taste, and hear and so on. All right, I I had done here already. No, I'll leave it at this. But I'll close with this line on top of it. I thought I had here. The spirit, here we go, will bring the people right back to where they were at the beginning. So when God say I'll restore and you know the prophet said the the the uh when the church is believing that the same Holy Spirit &gt;&gt; is just as real &gt;&gt; as it was at the day of Pentecost. &gt;&gt; How they are born and positionally born. He is saying that we are going right back to that. &gt;&gt; I will restore. Let's all stand &gt;&gt; and give God some praise. Begin to pray. Father God, we thank you for tonight. We thank you for your presence and spirit. May you have the prayer minister among your people. We commit their lives unto thee in Jesus name I ask it. Amen and amen. God bless you. Thanks again for coming out tonight. Praise God. We appreciate you. We love you. God bless you brother and your daughter. God bless you all. Safe journey to Grenada and may the fire be with you. My God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. Praise God. Brother, just sing a song for me and &gt;&gt; Pour out your spirit. Pour out your spirit. Pour out your spirit on me. Won't you pour out your spirit? Oh, pour out your spirit. Pour out your spirit on me. Oh, sing it all your heart. Sing it. Pour out, oh Lord, pour out. Oh, pour out your spirit on me. Oh, won't you pour out your spirit? Oh, pour out your Oh, pour out your spirit. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Give him some praises and then you're going to have a seat. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Have a seat. I need your spit. I need your spit. I need your spirit in me. I need your spirit. I need your spirit. I need your spirit. &gt;&gt; One more time. Pour out your spirit. The prayer. Pour out your spirit. Pour out your spirit. Pour out your spirit in me. Oh Jesus, pour out my spirit. &gt;&gt; Pour out your spirit. Pour out. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. right now where you are. I want you to raise your hands and worship the Lord right now. [Music] Hallelujah. Yes, Lord. Need your spirit in me. Oh Jesus, pour out the spirit. Pour out the spirit. Pour out the spirit on me. &gt;&gt; Jesus told the one of the well, he said, "Woman, the hour come is when the true worshippers worship the father in spirit and in truth." &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. Amen. So we continue the word. &gt;&gt; You love him tonight. &gt;&gt; Brother, he talk about a man. He asked him he feeling the spirit of the churches today but rather it begin to drop down spirit dropping ministers coming from everywhere interviews asking what happened brother Brandham what has happened are they living off the spirit of Satan or what I said no the sucker lives off the strength of the vine it lives because the citrus lemon fruit will grow on orange tree it will not be orange to do it lives by by it life and the church so-called is only a grafted sucker living under this name of religion under the name of the church Catholic protestant just suckers and he said there wasn't in the original predestination plan of God Jesus say I am the vine the branches but if that tree ever put forth another branch &gt;&gt; it will bear the original fruit &gt;&gt; so the grafting orange they grafting tangelo and all kind of lemon and all kind of stuff but is the original tree &gt;&gt; was the orange tree &gt;&gt; and God said to put forth another orange branch It will produce the original fruit. Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord. So that's why you cannot look at other manifestation and all kind of crazy stuff around as if that the message. The message is the original word. &gt;&gt; The message is the original life. The message original seed &gt;&gt; that God put on the day of Pentecost. That is the message &gt;&gt; and that is what you're coming to fight for. You're not fighting for just church. You're fighting to get back to where you're supposed to be. Remember our ultimate destination is back to Eden. &gt;&gt; We are fighting for Trinidad. You know, we fighting to go back to Eden. You know, [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; In Eden, Adam was in God's image and likeness. &gt;&gt; In Eden, Adam had dominion. In Eden, Adam was a god of the earth. &gt;&gt; Small G. &gt;&gt; And God was the big G. &gt;&gt; Is that right? So, if that tree ever put forth another branch, it will bear its original fruit. And here the prophecy now. And there has got to be a restoration of all these things right at the end of the vine. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It watch there's to be light in the evening time. It takes light to ripen it. &gt;&gt; So God is comparing his people to like a seed fruit. Fruit could ripen. Faith could ripen. &gt;&gt; Fruit could grow. &gt;&gt; Faith could grow. &gt;&gt; Fruit does mature. &gt;&gt; Faith could mature. Fruit have a start. Faith have a start. So just as fruit come into maturity, you have to come to maturity. Just as fruit get right, you could get right or your faith could get right. You talk about Abraham coming in the fullness of believing. It means you growing in faith that God is going to perform this miracle. And you have to grow in faith. Coming under expectation every service, not just now and again every single service. Your job is to come in under expectation. Your expectation could move the minister. Your expectation could move the Holy Ghost. Your own expectation. Oh, give the Lord a shout. Praise God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Yeah. Come here to take notes. You come here to be on expectation. You can write all your notes home. Oh, give the Lord some praises. You're coming to worship. &gt;&gt; You as believers come in a greater atmosphere. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. I am not a priest. I'm not a Catholic priest. The college is upso. &gt;&gt; If just in case you're coming here by mistake. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Upso. You get the Catholic priest. He blesses you and do his crosses and stuff and but here is to preach the word and see you have faith to take it &gt;&gt; because God put a challenge in your life right now. &gt;&gt; That's the reason you are here this morning. You have a challenge in your life. You have to have it. If you don't have a challenge, something wrong with your experience. Something wrong with you. God put a challenge to see if you got faith to believe it. He challenged Abraham's body condition. He challenged Sarah body condition. He always challenges people. Oh, &gt;&gt; give the Lord some praises. Goliath was a challenge to Israel. &gt;&gt; It's just that David had reached yet. &gt;&gt; So Goliath parade in his beef for 14 days and 40 nights &gt;&gt; on because David reach the only reason that he &gt;&gt; because David had reached you know &gt;&gt; and when David came he came out of timing when God wasn't there. And when his brother start to rough him up, they have no anointing to do nothing, you know, &gt;&gt; only talk, &gt;&gt; they facing no challenge. They only roughening up their brother. &gt;&gt; And as they about to leave, then Goliath step forward out of timing just stepping out of timing. Timing &gt;&gt; and they say, "Who is that? &gt;&gt; Unircumcised." He start him already. He put a tag on him. Who is that uncircumcised? Philistine. He pinned him uncircumcised. That that pinn that on him uncircumcised. He don't belong inside of here. What are you doing inside of here? In my name shall cast out devils. Who is the uncircumcised pilline? In your house, in your life, in your home, in your mind, in your head. What is he doing dear? This body is mine's. God give it to me. Sickness is not mine. Sickness got to go pack up shop. Serving sickness, notice. Serving disease, notice. Serving depression, not glory. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Be seated. Note in every age, every believer, their their senses was challenged &gt;&gt; to prove how faith is above senses. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So David watched Goliath and shall cut your head off and man have a sword. That when you talk in faith, that's when you're walking in faith. That when you speak in faith, that when faith come alive, you to speak things that are not as though they will. You just call things that are not as though they while cut your head off and he has seen the sword coming yet. Oh, glory to God. Give the Lord a shout. This is how he had to speak. Our God is able to deliver us. But if we don't deliver us, we are not going to bow down. And them guys walk in the fiery furnace and all the furnace do is to loose their bounds. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Challenge of the senses. too much of you too feely feely. &gt;&gt; You're not in the faith yet. You're feeling &gt;&gt; God challenged Noah's senses &gt;&gt; to build an ark on a mountain &gt;&gt; and we never fall yet. &gt;&gt; We reading that normal normal Noah. I'm thinking about you. Could you imagine that? &gt;&gt; No. Yeshua, &gt;&gt; nor a billion only hammer nail going up according to specification. They're building a boat. Where you sailing at? &gt;&gt; How you going on float? &gt;&gt; Behave yourself now. You're thinking right. &gt;&gt; You're looking like a cuck when you rain never fall them scientist put latest news in CNN. No rain up there. &gt;&gt; You know I say when you finish &gt;&gt; it shall rain. &gt;&gt; When God shut no into the ark, not one drop of rain fall down. What a piece of test for seven days. &gt;&gt; No one just waiting there. His children had to give him terrorize him on the inside. Daddy, are you sure &gt;&gt; going have a party this weekend, Saturday? You know, &gt;&gt; today is Tuesday and the store open &gt;&gt; and I want to buy a piece of garment to go to this. Are you sure? He says, "Son, I'm sure." &gt;&gt; God testing and people start to mock outside. Look, look, look, look. He going inside now. tire is heat, you know, air condition inside it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Seven days &gt;&gt; and the ark preaching. &gt;&gt; Seven days to the eternal loss. &gt;&gt; Seven days Noah's third pull. &gt;&gt; Ark preaching. &gt;&gt; God shut him in. What door God shut, no man can open. What door God open, no man could shut. God shut no in. Let's say it this way. God sealed Noah and the act stood there. To all them hypocrites, to all them church members, to all them who thinking about getting saved and wanted to get it right. It stood there and they couldn't be saved. &gt;&gt; Somebody get a dream. I got a dream last night. No, don't open up. No. No. I didn't close the door. You know, &gt;&gt; I can't open what God shut. &gt;&gt; So that dream can help you now. It should have dream before these seven days. You should have come in before that. &gt;&gt; Then the rain begin to fall. &gt;&gt; You know people come out there are feeling led. &gt;&gt; They line up to be in church. &gt;&gt; This hallelujah. Glory. Glory. Glory. Glory. &gt;&gt; Too late. &gt;&gt; The rain is coming. &gt;&gt; But say after door is shut, &gt;&gt; God will anoint the church. Then &gt;&gt; how would it be to see signs, wonders, miracles, and people can't even be saved? &gt;&gt; But before that time, &gt;&gt; God have to get a ministry out to the lost in this message. There are people in message churches that are lost. &gt;&gt; They're not even saved. They're lost in church. They're dead in church. They're paralyzed in church. They're under cult leaders. But they are going to be delivered. When the spirit begin to move. The spirit coming for the seed in the elect. It will pull them out of every group, every hole, everywhere they hide them. Nothing going to stop it. The same God that put the seed under. And he said, "Let there be light." And when them light hit them seeds, those seeds came forth. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord some praises. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You may be seated. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Jesus called 12. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; Build his ministry up to 82. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; 70 walk away. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Come back down. &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; Send a bunch of 120 up a room. And when Peter was loosed under the anointing of Joel, this is that the prophet Joel spake of when Peter was released under the restoration anointing of Joel. 3,000 people said, "What shall we do to be saved?" Oh, glory to God. There were elected people under the anointing of this is that. And one of these days a church, bride church, elect church will say, "This is that that the prophet William Brandham spake of." They give the Lord a shook. Not I'm in a message, but this is that. Oh God, we here to fulfill the prophet's prophecy. Glory to God. [Music] My God, it's a wonderful thing to be free. It's a wonderful thing to have the liberty in the spirit. &gt;&gt; We don't have to explain nothing away from you. &gt;&gt; We just bomb the word and you're saying amen. [Applause] [Music] [Applause] You may be seated. &gt;&gt; Watch. Fruit &gt;&gt; cannot ripen &gt;&gt; unless the sun ripens it. &gt;&gt; Let's go deep. &gt;&gt; No matter how much you preach, &gt;&gt; whatever you do, &gt;&gt; it cannot be ripened. It cannot be manifested. It cannot be vindicated. Only by him who said, "I am the light of the world." &gt;&gt; So they could teach, they could preach, they could explain, they could mystery and mystery and mystery. Unless the light come, it's not going to ripen. A light have to come. Okay. Give the Lord a shout. Let's go. Let's go. He said it cannot be ripened. It cannot be manifested. It cannot be vindicated. Only by him &gt;&gt; who said I am the light of the world. &gt;&gt; So the word prophecy now. &gt;&gt; So there has to come forth a power. &gt;&gt; Shout out power. &gt;&gt; The message was like a head but we have to say it. &gt;&gt; Shout out power. &gt;&gt; We had word for over 50 years but it got to come a power. &gt;&gt; Shout out power. One more time. &gt;&gt; Oh glory to God. Act one say you shall receive power after the Holy Ghost come upon you. The Holy Ghost is going to come upon you. Power going to come upon you. Power to live, power to stand, power to overcome, power to heal the sick, power to raise the dead, power to cast out devils, power to set the church in order. But there is going to rise power [Applause] Let me be seated. [Applause] I tired here. You talk about power. Are you tired? &gt;&gt; And you going to hear more about it. It have mysteries down the road down. So you can hear whatever you want to hear. But I talking about power. This is what is promised. I'm a disciple. We're not babes no longer. We're not in the womb no longer. We are men. We are sons and daughters of God. Be in the message. Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. Send your placement. Lord, send on the adoption. Father, send the spirit of adoption. Lord, [Applause] may be seated. There's got to come for the power. &gt;&gt; Then he say what the power is. A man coming from America. No, no, no. They come for a power. &gt;&gt; You want to know what it is? &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit himself &gt;&gt; to ripen or to vindicate &gt;&gt; or to prove still reading or to make manifest what he predicted would happen for this day. &gt;&gt; Shouting out. &gt;&gt; So then you don't have to look to me. &gt;&gt; You're looking to him. [Applause] You don't who God going to use. &gt;&gt; Let me be seated. &gt;&gt; The Bible talk about don't pray for this one. They call this one here. Pray for this one. Pray for this ministry and pray for that ministry. Where the preference coming from &gt;&gt; you know who going to use &gt;&gt; it. Remind us talking a little bit about Jesus in the first marriage king of Galilee. JS was invited guest and they come and tell the wine round. She say I I wasn't part of the catering team. &gt;&gt; I know nothing about this marriage. I just come I get inviting. I come for food. &gt;&gt; See the blessing and what not. This run out. Do you say what I do with this? &gt;&gt; I have nothing to do with this. But you see miracles have to start some point in time. &gt;&gt; This is Jesus first miracle &gt;&gt; at a wedding. But the word was whatever he said do it. &gt;&gt; You know how much grapes to buy? He didn't ask for your advice. &gt;&gt; The grape shop open.

Don't ask then what? &gt;&gt; Just do it. &gt;&gt; And God giving instructions from this pulpit here. Just do it. Don't question it if it's the word. Just do it. &gt;&gt; Whatever he said, just do it. &gt;&gt; They follow the water pots. &gt;&gt; See, go and draw it &gt;&gt; and they pouring and they seeing wine coming out. &gt;&gt; Now the people who draw the water pot know what went on. &gt;&gt; Not the others. &gt;&gt; They only seen wine coming. &gt;&gt; One man when he tasted so he said he said everybody has give the good wine first and put the bad wine last. After people drink a little high and drink, they didn't know there's a good wine or bad wine. He said, "But this wine different, &gt;&gt; you leave the best wine for last." &gt;&gt; They may know that Jesus turned water into wine. &gt;&gt; And when God turn your water into the wine of revelation, it will bring a stimulation. Your deadness going to leave you. Your paralyzed on the bench will leave you. You would jump up. You would raise your hand. You would praise God. You will get out your senses and your feelings and your emotions because wine brings stimulation of revelation.

I said going back way I was so shocked because he's so much older than me mature. I go back. Now I begin to bust and rebuke. I don't know what was surprised. &gt;&gt; I start to rebuke him and whatn not. And when I start to rebuke him and talk to him about the Lord, I get strength. &gt;&gt; He didn't know how much I was struggling. But when I see he who I consider like a soldier going and give up in this battle, I said, "No, that can't work." &gt;&gt; I light fire under him. &gt;&gt; That's good friendship. that when you're real good friends, there's light fire under you.

I believe that the age has come now, &gt;&gt; the miraculous, &gt;&gt; the phenomenal, &gt;&gt; the baptism of the spirit &gt;&gt; and power and signs and wonders, great &gt;&gt; pouring out of God's spirit in the last days. &gt;&gt; And that's the thing &gt;&gt; that will bring faith into the people &gt;&gt; that will make a rapture faith &gt;&gt; and take the church to glory. What the intellectuals like to read and preach is these divinely revealed mystery truths &gt;&gt; is what will literally turn the hearts of back to the V as if that's all the prophets say &gt;&gt; hallelujah &gt;&gt; that's just one of the things &gt;&gt; the transformation of disciples what came first manifestation or revelation revelation so revelation which is the word being unfolded Little reveal comes first to bring clarity as to what you must expect. &gt;&gt; They came out of Egypt. They don't know God. &gt;&gt; Moses is the one who met God. Moses who spoke for God who spoke flies and frogs and fleas. Get them out of Egypt. &gt;&gt; God said, "Bring them here. I will reveal myself to them &gt;&gt; by the word, the commandments." So Moses went to get the commandments to bring to the people to let them know what God thinks about life. How you treat your neighbor. Love God. Love your neighbor as yourself. Thou shalt not become adultery. Thou shalt not lie. Thou shalt not steal. Thou shalt bear false witness. And so &gt;&gt; they know nothing about that. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You understand? &gt;&gt; So when Jesus died and rose from the dead, the first thing he did in coming, he didn't come to among this and mong this and mong that and talk to this one. He came to his disciples. Because was a different ministry now was resurrection ministry. This ministry was only to the elect. It wasn't going to lepers and going to one. He come to disciples. One purpose to set them up to receive the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; So he opened their minds. He opened their understanding. He opened their word because if you open the word and you don't have an open mind, your word close to you, your mind still shut down. God had to unlock your mind. Open your understanding to the scriptures that you might know what is promised. So when Jesus finished with them, every man Jack know what was promised. So when people thought they were drunk, Peter step out and said, "These people are not drunk as you supposed, but this is that &gt;&gt; that the prophet George spake of." Where did Peter get that from? Jesus. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Peter got that from Jesus. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And Peter revelation gave him the authority to say this is the stone &gt;&gt; that you builders refuse. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He identified Christ as the rejected stone which is the head stone. This is the stone you builders refuse. God has made it the head of the corner. It is the Lord's doing. It's marvelous in our eyes. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Satan interpretation of the upper room experience is these people are excited. Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't bother with them. &gt;&gt; May be seated. &gt;&gt; What page I'm on? &gt;&gt; On page two of 10 pages. &gt;&gt; This car working &gt;&gt; Satan interpretation of the upper room experience. But these people are excited &gt;&gt; because the devils one now and tell them listen if they see the car they standing up there carrying on say excited. Yes. Leave them alone. go way off. &gt;&gt; You see how we interpreting you &gt;&gt; whatever you have here go way off &gt;&gt; and you going back to you. I know you I watching you for a long time. &gt;&gt; When the anointing come off and you leave the church and what I know I coming right back by you. &gt;&gt; I bring a cigarette back for you. I bring a drink back for you. I bring a boyfriend for you, a girlfriend, bring for you. &gt;&gt; I come to offload. &gt;&gt; So when when when Satan saw them standing up a room, he interpreted them as carrying on. Yes, &gt;&gt; he sleep. When Peter &gt;&gt; saw the man &gt;&gt; at the gate that everybody knew. So this no set up you know people set up miracles they no set up miracles now they know the man and when Peter gone Peter Peter because I'm g change when this apostle is the first poor the poorest apostle but look for money they man can't buy juice downstairs somebody buy some wish for me scrunting apostle he said silver and gold I don't have &gt;&gt; I have something I have something I have something I have something I have something what I've have I could give I can't give it what I don't have I have something I have some I'm filled Something something inside my body. Something all over me. Something keeping me alive. I feel it in my hands. I feel it in my feet. Oh, glory to God. Silver and gold have I none. Such as I have I give it unto thee. He said rise up and walk. Listen. The man rise up and walk. You know the man said to jump and leap and praise God. You know the man said to make rock in front of the place. You know the camera start to come. Twitter start to light up. Hallelujah. Facebook people start to stream this thing. You know the man jumping and shouting and leaping and carrying. You know people come and want to worship Peter and start think hold. Sit down. Sit down for a minute. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He said you think is my holiness. This man &gt;&gt; don't go there. You know &gt;&gt; tell that now &gt;&gt; them ministers want the people to go there. &gt;&gt; Peter say it's not me. is not my holiness. It's faith in Jesus name. &gt;&gt; This man is made whole. &gt;&gt; That's why I'm saying God is going to be with you. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; I can't believe that for you. You have to believe that for yourself. &gt;&gt; Now, when you leave here, God is going with you. You have to believe these signs shall follow. If your children don't want prayer, pray for them when they're sleeping. [Music] [Applause] There are one prayer not praying the devil deceiving you. Pray anyhow. &gt;&gt; Praise God. When they sleeping, when they sn go over them if you can't touch them and lay hands upon them, put your hand over them. Say, "Lord God, the anointing is in my hands. I'm coming to pray." Praise God. Lord Jesus, deliver them in Jesus name. Every devil in hell know you're praying. Oh God, hallelujah. God want you to act upon your prayer. When Daniel was praying, the angel was coming. The prophet said, "Stop praying. The angel has to stop coming. Your angel is on his way." Come on, give the Lord a shout in the house. Your angel deliverance is on his way. Don't stop praying. [Applause] [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; This coat &gt;&gt; is hardly coated. This quote is hardly spoken &gt;&gt; but this quote is from God &gt;&gt; because man can't operate this. &gt;&gt; You see man can operate mysteries. Man can operate revelations and bring information &gt;&gt; but said I'll say it again. See how wrap up. I believe that the age has come now. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; The miraculous &gt;&gt; the phenomenal. The baptism of the spirit and power and signs and wonders. this great pouring out of God's spirit in the last days. &gt;&gt; That's what I'm saying. &gt;&gt; If I preach for 4 hours and I give no room for the spirit &gt;&gt; to pour out is Theo unfolding out, &gt;&gt; sharing out, talking out. There's no room &gt;&gt; and singing two specials after a service. That's not the spirit pouring out. &gt;&gt; That is like a replacement for that. Then What we want to see is while Peter yet &gt;&gt; spake these words, &gt;&gt; the Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; fell, &gt;&gt; not talk, fell. He was talking word, but the Holy Ghost was falling. &gt;&gt; Holy Ghost have fallen on the grass. God has said the Holy Ghost fall on carpet and bench and pews. He called send the Holy Ghost to fall on humans, &gt;&gt; to fall on hearts. &gt;&gt; This man wasn't had a spoken word with book. This man wasn't even baptized in Jesus name. This man never went to a church. He was just giving, giving, giving, giving till heaven records how he gives. &gt;&gt; Don't say amen now. &gt;&gt; Because you're stingy. &gt;&gt; He was not stingy then. &gt;&gt; He was a free giver. &gt;&gt; He was giving offerings. Giving, giving, giving, giving, giving. The Bible call it arms. [Music] &gt;&gt; And God recorded that. Peter &gt;&gt; by pos being positionally placed by the Holy Ghost itself &gt;&gt; was now a channel of God &gt;&gt; to bring life from his lips. What Adam was supposed to have &gt;&gt; what Adam was supposed to release. Adam was supposed to have sons just like him, &gt;&gt; word and spirit, image and likeness. Adam didn't get that opportunity because his wife throw him down. Or let's say this way. He follow his wife &gt;&gt; out of Eden. &gt;&gt; But here is Peter. He's restored. &gt;&gt; Power is now in his lips. &gt;&gt; Eternal life coming out of his lips. &gt;&gt; He don't even know what's inside of him fully. &gt;&gt; God sent him to continue house. And he don't know what the manifestation will be. &gt;&gt; He begin to testify. &gt;&gt; And as he testify, Holy Ghost, &gt;&gt; the word he was testifying was seed. &gt;&gt; The word he was testifying was God. And the spirit bear witness of the word coming out of his mouth and they were filled with the Holy Ghost before they were baptized in Jesus name. &gt;&gt; God could fill you before you get baptized. Oh give the Lord a shout. Cornel's heart was right. He was just. He was devout. Oh give the Lord some praises. He wasn't a rascal. He wasn't a scamp. And God recognized his faith. &gt;&gt; Great. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So don't ever forget this &gt;&gt; great outpouring of his spirit. &gt;&gt; That's the thing &gt;&gt; that will bring faith into the people. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So after the mysteries is preached &gt;&gt; or taught. &gt;&gt; We're not against mysteries or teachings. &gt;&gt; But after the mysteries is preached and thought, &gt;&gt; taught, then the spirit have to come &gt;&gt; to fall upon that. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. &gt;&gt; You have a seed, you could give a seed in your house for 100 years, 50 years, a corn seed, &gt;&gt; nothing happening to that seed &gt;&gt; until you put it in the ground and put some water on it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That seed will grow. &gt;&gt; And he says, "So shall my word be &gt;&gt; that come out my mouth." Just like that seed. Oh, give the Lord a shout. You have to begin to speak. &gt;&gt; You have to begin to say. You can't be no dumb dog in Israel. Open your mouth and give God some praises. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You can't talk this shy talk and you can't talk talk. You can't talk that talk. Hallelujah. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Let me see how we can close off here. &gt;&gt; I don't really want to close, you know. I'm telling you &gt;&gt; this age started just at the turn of 20th century as it is to be the age in which the true church get the prophecy would return to being the bride she was at Pentecost. &gt;&gt; We know that there must of necessity be a return of dynamic power. The believers sense this in their spirits &gt;&gt; and begin to cry out to God &gt;&gt; for a new outpouring such as was in the first century. &gt;&gt; What seemed to be the answer came as many begin to speak in tongues manifest gifts of the spirit. It was then believed that this was indeed a long awaited restoration. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It was not. &gt;&gt; Amen. For the latter rain prophecy now can only come after the former rain &gt;&gt; which is the spring or teaching &gt;&gt; rain. &gt;&gt; The latter rain then is the harvest rain. &gt;&gt; Do you understand now? &gt;&gt; The latter rain is what? &gt;&gt; Harvest rain. &gt;&gt; Watch. How could this be the real thing when the teaching rain had not come? Amen. &gt;&gt; The prophet messenger who was to be sent to teach the people &gt;&gt; and turn the hearts of the church back to the Pentecostal father had not yet come. &gt;&gt; Thus what was taught to be the restoration &gt;&gt; and final quickening unto the rapture had not come. &gt;&gt; So he's saying 1906 Pentecost &gt;&gt; that was not the bride &gt;&gt; because the teaching didn't come yet. How the harvest rain couldn't come because the teaching didn't come. The teaching is to put seed in you. The harvest is to bring spirit upon you. &gt;&gt; The teaching is seed. Harvest is spirit. But look at where we are right now. We are in 2025. Elas is already come. We have had 50 plus years of teaching. When are we going to get this harvest rain? I want to prophesy to you. The harvest rain is on its way. Get ready. Get ready. Get ready. Glory to God. I read it to you in the scripture. It shall come to pass afterwards. I will pour out my spirit. After the teaching, after the explaining, after the revealing, after the time of the revelation of these things being made known, I'm going to pour out my spirit. Are you ready? Ready or not, it's coming. [Music] &gt;&gt; Be seated. [Music] Watch this. &gt;&gt; Thus, what was thought &gt;&gt; to be the restoration of the final quickening &gt;&gt; unto the rapture had not come. &gt;&gt; It was a mixture, Here we go. of the unrighteous partaking of spiritual blessing &gt;&gt; and manifesting in the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; As we keep pointing it out to you, &gt;&gt; in it also was devil power. &gt;&gt; As men were under the control of devils, &gt;&gt; yet no one seemed to realize it. Then to prove it was not real. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; These people &gt;&gt; even before the second generation had appeared &gt;&gt; organized and wrote their unscriptural doctrines and built their own fences as each other group ahead of them. &gt;&gt; So fences is a sign &gt;&gt; of the noal spirit &gt;&gt; and that is what these pastors have done &gt;&gt; in the message. &gt;&gt; They build wrong fences as if those believers belong to them. &gt;&gt; But the seventh angel &gt;&gt; holding the vial said, "Come, I will show thee the bride, the lamb's wife." Oh, give the Lord a shout. You don't belong to no man. &gt;&gt; You are not my wife. My wife's name is Anmarie. Behave yourself. Give the Lord some praises. Give the Lord a shout in the house. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You are not my wife. Get that in your head. &gt;&gt; Well, you know the the church is the wife of the pastor. Yeah. In context. &gt;&gt; But my wife is not you. My wife is Anmarie. &gt;&gt; Still in love with my wife. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; So, what I'm saying is this. You don't belong to no man. &gt;&gt; You belong to Christ. &gt;&gt; Christ is the head of the body. Call the church. &gt;&gt; Christ have no mini head. You know, small head under the head. [Music] &gt;&gt; Too much of beef on parade. too much of flesh. &gt;&gt; We need to see less of man &gt;&gt; and more of God. &gt;&gt; The word have to come in such a way that men die out &gt;&gt; and you see God come on the scene &gt;&gt; that God could speak to you. What you know is God speaking to you. &gt;&gt; Remember when Jesus was on earth, &gt;&gt; so was Judas. &gt;&gt; All right, I won't skip down. &gt;&gt; All right. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The people of God are being made ready by the truth. Word of truth from the messenger of the age. &gt;&gt; In her talking about the bride will be the fullness of Pentecost. &gt;&gt; Hear the bum. Sister June. For &gt;&gt; the spirit &gt;&gt; will bring the people &gt;&gt; right back to where they were at the beginning. &gt;&gt; That is thus sayeth the Lord. &gt;&gt; I am convinced &gt;&gt; we're going to have another book of Acts. &gt;&gt; And before you have a book of Acts, you have to have another day of Pentecost. &gt;&gt; The day of Pentecost is what wrote another book of Acts. [Music] Glory. You may be seated. &gt;&gt; Now comes the weight of what you keep hearing over and over. When a church is groaning &gt;&gt; under the groaning of the Holy Ghost, &gt;&gt; that the Holy Ghost is just as real &gt;&gt; as it was in the Pentecost when they are born and positionally born. Then God said in the church, there's got to people in this message that believe the Holy Ghost is just as real. And no more than Holy Ghost. No message Holy Ghost. It's the same Holy Ghost. [Applause] [Music] Watch this. &gt;&gt; When Cornelius went back &gt;&gt; to the other apostles and disciples, &gt;&gt; he told them, &gt;&gt; "These Cornelius people, they receive &gt;&gt; the same Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; that we receive." &gt;&gt; It was sons begotten sons &gt;&gt; because Peter was in the body. The sea germ was in Peter. &gt;&gt; Peter was a channel of life. &gt;&gt; Even though the angel direct Peter to go to continuous, the angel couldn't release the germ &gt;&gt; because the germ have to come from the body. &gt;&gt; And Peter was part of the body. Peter had life resident in him. [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; Do you get this? &gt;&gt; Do you understand this? &gt;&gt; From Peter mouth b another son. Adam was supposed to speak for a son &gt;&gt; and Eve conceived and produced a son just like Adam &gt;&gt; by word and spirit. &gt;&gt; God used nothing else. He said, "Let there be men in image and likeness." &gt;&gt; Then God in Genesis do get a dust man and throw the first man inside of there. &gt;&gt; Other flesh man you're seen here. Now &gt;&gt; first message Jesus come, he must be born again. &gt;&gt; Word and spirit had to come forth. But a bron come and he come about word and spirit and spoke original seed &gt;&gt; because the word was lost. So we couldn't get the true birth &gt;&gt; until the word was found or the word was restored and God promised to restore all the conqueror woman that cut up in a locust. All them guys eat down and God said I'm going to bring it all back. Nothing going to stop this. I feel good this morning. I feel anointed with a spirit of restoration, a spirit of reconciliation. Oh, glory to God. Go get that bride. Hallelujah. Go get your loved ones. &gt;&gt; I'm going to close music, please. &gt;&gt; Could you take a little more? You're tired. &gt;&gt; But George tell me go ahead. When you see brother George stand up and say go ahead. That's a serious thing. You can't That's not an idol thing at all. That's a rare thing. [Applause] All right, let's go. It says God is going to restore. The Luther age did not restore the church. &gt;&gt; It started a reformation. &gt;&gt; The res age did not restore. The Pentecostal age did not restore. But God has to restore for he cannot deny his word. This is not the resurrection of the church. This is the restoration. God will take the church right back to Pentecost of the beginning. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Who said that? God said that. God said that. I don't care what the message we're teaching and preaching. God said that. &gt;&gt; I want that. &gt;&gt; What about you? I want that. The same Holy Ghost, the same fire. &gt;&gt; See, what Abraham teach us? Somebody come to the Lord, they have a snake in their heart. &gt;&gt; Not have a old snake. &gt;&gt; They accept the Lord. The snake is there. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; They repent. The snake still there. &gt;&gt; They baptize in water. They come up. The snake is there. &gt;&gt; That snake will move my fire. &gt;&gt; When the Holy Ghost come and blast that snake out, &gt;&gt; snake gone. &gt;&gt; Then the dove could come and just drop inside your heart. &gt;&gt; If any man be in Christ, new creature, &gt;&gt; new behavior, no attitude. Nobody here fighting just saying, "I come to church. I know God long. I had I cut my hair. I I had to come on my knees." You have no fight at all. You You lost that fight. When I come to the Lord, I had a girlfriend. I drop it like a hot potato. &gt;&gt; Because I come to the Lord, my heart, desire, everything change. So she look different. Mom, I she see different &gt;&gt; and I know what I seen is not what I wanted. &gt;&gt; What if I hold on to what I want? What what I seeing? &gt;&gt; I never meet up with man. &gt;&gt; But I had to let her go. &gt;&gt; I said bye-bye. &gt;&gt; You second boy. I come to the Christ when she her boyfriend. Go on. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; When you see you come to the Lord and Satan loses or he lost you know &gt;&gt; but he don't see you as lost. He say as a runaway one &gt;&gt; devil interpreting you as a runaway one. You know &gt;&gt; he tell them get them back. &gt;&gt; I want them. &gt;&gt; He want them Jezebel out there.

What an atmosphere. What a move of the spirit. What an anointing to follow the word. What a time in the presence of the Lord. &gt;&gt; I tell you, one of these days the service will just not be normal. &gt;&gt; God will just break the routine, break what your expectation is and do something exceedingly abundantly above. And that's what he promised to do above what we could even ask or even think. And there are many things we think because of what we have heard in the word. And God intends to beat that thinking to do exceedingly abundantly above anything you could ask, anything you could think. He's going higher than that. What a mighty God we serve. Can we give the Lord a hand of praise? Amen. We have three prayer requests we want to bring before the Lord. From Sister Rebecca Thomas, I'd like to ask the church to remember my family and I in prayer. Also for our company as we are experiencing a financial crisis, we want to remember our sister in prayer from sister Kangali. Please remember Steven Kangali in prayer. He's done with the virus and also from brother George Kangali. I've been diagnosed with a lung condition called bronchiais. I'm sure I said that correctly. Medicine has not found a cure but God is able. Please pray. And I could certainly say seeing brother George on fire like this, he's already declaring and walking in his healing, &gt;&gt; counting the things as not as though they were, thanking God in advance. And if there's anyone this morning you want to show by raising your hand as we approach the throne of grace. Maybe you were not able to put it down on paper, but there's a desire in your heart, a need, be it financial, be it health, be it something in your home, a situation that you're dealing with, something you could talk about, something you don't even want to talk about, though we want to take it to the Lord this morning in prayer as a church united, knowing that if two shall agree, touching anything, we could have what we ask for. Can we bow our heads for a word of prayer? Oh gracious heavenly father, what a fate we feel in the building this morning. Lord, to know that you promise to restore to restore all the years that the cankerorm and the caterpillar and the locust and the palmer worm. Lord, you promised to restore joy and peace and victory. Lord, you promised to restore us back to Eden. Father, Lord, they promise to take us into a condition, Father, where we could be raptured and we could experience a body change and through your prophet, you taught us how could we even have faith for a rapture if we cannot have faith for divine healing. So, Father, we are coming to you this morning looking for a miracle, a work of grace, a moving of the power of God, and a revelation and a recognition that on Calvary you already paid it all, Father. So we unite as a church this morning for every need, every cry, every plea, every request. Lord, from small to great, you are taking every request this morning. You taught us to cast all of our cares upon you. You are more than able to handle it, Father. So we bring our requests before you boldly to the throne of grace. knowing that you are ready to receive them this morning. Knowing that healing is a children's bread. Knowing that we are entitled and we have a right to ask this morning. Lord, he said we should ask anything in your name. We are signing our checks this morning. In the mighty name of the Lord Jesus Christ because you taught us in your name, Lord God, we can cast out devils. In your name, Father, Lord, the sick could be healed. So Lord, we bring the situation Lord with sister Rebecca Thomas Lord to remember our family in prayer Lord and for the financial crisis in her company Lord that you will change the situation around that you will work the situation out and you will get the honor and the glory in this situation. You know what we don't know. You know what has not been written here. But we hand the entire situation to you this morning. We bring brother Steven Kangali before you Lord down with the virus wherever he is right now. May the angel of the Lord touch him from the crown of his head to the soles of his feet. May healing move uh may healing rain pour upon him even now Lord and anyone else with the virus or anything like that. May healing rain move upon them now in the mighty name of Jesus Christ. And Lord for brother Kangali Lord with this condition that has been named Father. Lord we know every sickness has been named. Uh every demon has been named uh every principality has been named. Just as Goliath had a name, we say, "Who is this uncircumcised Philistine this morning that dare defy the army of the living God, Father, we unite in faith as the church of the living God. When medicine cannot find a cure, you are the cure. When the doctors don't know what it is, you know what it is, Father. Lord, may divine healing break upon him even now. May you touch him completely. May you heal him completely. May you deliver completely. May you restore completely in the mighty name of Jesus Christ. It's already done. It's a finished work. It was finished on Calvary. And Lord, across the building, may you touch every son, every daughter, those on the internet, those downstairs. May the healing virtue of God. Move upon your people today in the mighty name of Jesus Christ. Lord, may you bless your people. May you bless our pastor this morning. What a time in the presence of God. What a moving of uncction and inspiration, a burden to see the church rise. Go higher. Go deeper in love of God. Go higher in faith and revelation and be under expectation. May you strengthen him. May you bless his wife, the family. May you bless the officers, the helps, the governments, the church. May you bless the service this evening. May you bless the service this coming Wednesday. May you bless the Bible study this coming Friday. May you bring us back next Sunday. May you have the preeminence in our lives in the mighty precious name of Jesus Christ. And the church says &gt;&gt; And the church says &gt;&gt; amen and amen. You may be seated for a few announcements. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God is moving. &gt;&gt; Glory. Service continues this afternoon at 3 p.m. for the Lord's supper. This is part of not just being a believer, but this is a direct instruction from the Lord himself to do this in remembrance of me. So, we want to be part of that sacred vow, that sacred sacrament, that uh commitment that God requires from us. So, the Lord's supper at 3 p.m. this evening. Service continues on Wednesday evening, Wednesday night, Lord willing, at 8:00 p.m. We encourage you to make an effort to be here. God is doing something tremendous and without question he will reward the sacrifice and the effort. Service continues this coming Friday at 8:00 p.m. we have our Bible study and we've had conversations around what the vision is for that. So we encourage you uh to be present to encourage others to join the Bible study as well. And certainly this coming Sunday we have a special service.

Make it part of your daily practice to take it to the Lord in prayer. Maintenance team group three, please meet with brother Andy Henry after this evening's service. And next week, Lord willing, brother Blackman's group is scheduled to serve.
