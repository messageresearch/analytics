[26:39] amen and that's a personal pronoun
[26:42] his waters amen so i believe uh we're
[26:46] all looking very smart today because uh
[26:48] there's a photo shoot
[26:50] going on later so um we're all uh

[26:56] thank you brother charles
[27:00] shall we stand to our feet as we go
[27:01] straight to the world today
[27:04] and uh we want to take the following
[27:06] scriptures
[27:08] as we look at this subject
[27:12] it shall give forth his water
[27:16] we start with numbers 20 verse 8.
[27:21] take the rod and gather thou the
[27:23] assembly together
[27:25] thou and er on thy brother and
[27:29] speak ye unto the rock before their eyes
[27:33] it shall give forth his water
[27:36] and thou shalt bring forth uh
[27:40] to them water out of the rock so
[27:43] thou shalt give the congregation and
[27:44] their beast to drink
[28:01] who is our god
[28:05] save the lord and who
[28:08] is a rock save our god
[28:14] a little
[28:27] he opened the rock and the waters
[28:31] gushed out they ran in the dry places
[28:36] like a river
[28:44] 8 1 and when he had opened
[28:47] the seventh seal there was silence
[28:50] in heaven about the space of half an
[28:56] hour
[29:00] revelation 22 17 and the spirit
[29:04] and the bride say come
[29:07] let him that heareth say come
[29:10] and let him that is a thirst come
[29:14] and whosoever will let him take the
[29:16] water
[29:17] of life freely
[29:24] is
[29:38] for the scriptures
[29:52] to know what this message is it's not
[29:55] just a preacher
[29:57] in america but it's a prophetic mind
[30:00] it's impossible being made known to a
[30:04] prophetic class of people
[30:19] we welcome you amongst us lord may the
[30:22] world edify
[30:23] islam strengthen encourage your people
[30:28] young and old lord that we will be
[30:31] uplifted
[30:32] and lord that thou they our eyes would
[30:35] be washed with eye sound
[30:38] from the sleep overlay odyssey
[30:41] in jesus christ's name amen and amen

[30:56] thank you musicians a wonderful job
[30:58] today
[31:00] and uh it shall give forth
[31:04] his water such as water
[31:07] but his water the rock itself looks uh
[31:11] a bit like this this is an artistic
[31:15] depiction
[31:30] and it will bring forth its waters
[31:35] bring forth his own
[31:39] is a personal pronoun and we want
[31:42] his waters
[31:46] [Music]
[31:58] to the carnal
[32:11] what is more dry than that amen it's a
[32:14] dry it's the driest thing you could ever
[32:16] find
[32:18] but speak to it it seems foolish
[32:22] and maybe in your predicament in your
[32:25] situation
[32:26] maybe it seems ridiculous but
[32:30] speak to the rock
[32:33] it shall give forth his waters
[32:36] amen these aren't the desert waters
[32:40] even though
[32:54] and
[33:09] talk to a rock what would a modern
[33:12] psychotherapist say to that
[33:14] no matter yes you're speaking into a
[33:17] stone
[33:18] pier but yet god was in that storm and
[33:21] it came forth
[33:27] [Music]
[33:36] and the animals
[34:19] we are not worthy of our salvation but
[34:21] in the midst of all of it
[34:24] the same god that forgave their sins
[34:29] their doubtings he still said
[34:45] they didn't have to go the desert route
[34:48] they could have gone the direct route
[34:50] but they decided to go to the desert no
[34:53] matter what took place
[34:55] he says and i watched even in their sins
[34:59] speak to the rocky
[35:27] amen i don't care what what state you're
[35:29] in
[35:31] i don't care oh i've ever sinned away
[35:34] my day of grace i don't care what's
[35:38] happening
[35:39] speak to the rock amen even if you're in
[35:42] your sin memphis you don't think you see
[35:43] you don't have to get nice and clean
[35:46] and then you can come and speak with me
[35:48] no as you are
[35:49] come to it praise be to god like a
[35:51] little child
[35:53] who knocked on the door of

[39:38] and he will hear
[39:40] the voice
[40:08] the son of abraham he was the seed of

[1:19:57] but when i become a man i put away
[1:20:00] childish things
[1:20:02] i'll put
[1:20:16] interpretation of the word now
[1:20:19] our confession is more powerful
[1:20:23] it has become omnipotence but what a

[1:21:31] understand it it says the seventh seal
[1:21:35] doesn't reveal anything too what's gonna
[1:21:38] happen to it
[1:21:40] because can we say because
[1:21:43] the end of the church
[1:21:46] is to come a prophetic gift
[1:21:50] to reveal this shows amen
[1:21:53] so you can say oh the civil seal silence

[1:22:00] silence
[1:22:02] and given to the bride a perfect
[1:22:05] confession
[1:22:06] which we have now that's why i can
[1:22:09] boldly say to every devil
