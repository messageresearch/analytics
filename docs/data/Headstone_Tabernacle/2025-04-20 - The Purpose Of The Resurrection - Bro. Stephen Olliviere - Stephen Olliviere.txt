In the end of the Sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see this epula. And behold, there was a great earthquake, for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone from the door and sat upon it. His countenance was like lightning, and his rain white as snow. And for fear of him, the keepers did shake and became as dead men. And the angel answered and said unto the woman, "Fear not ye, for I know that you seek Jesus which was crucified. He is not here, for he is risen, as he said, come see the place where the Lord lay." And so quickly and go quickly and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead. And behold, he goeth before you into Galilee. There shall you see him. Lo, I have told you. And they departed quickly from the seala with fear and great joy and did run to bring his disciples word. And as they went to tell his disciples, behold Jesus met them, saying, All hail. And they came and held him by the feet and worship him. Then said Jesus unto them, be not afraid. Go tell my brethren that they go into Galilee and there shall they see me. Praise the Lord. Amen. Uh Romans chapter 8 1 verse verse 11. Familiar scripture. But if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you. He that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you. Amen. Can we say amen? Amen. Amen. In Revelation 1 18, I am he that liveth and was dead, and behold, I am alive forever more. Amen. And have the keys of hell and of death. Praise the name of the Lord. Let's just bow our heads. Father Lord, one more time, we commit everything now into your hands. Have your perfect way. We pray in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. Praise God. God bless you. May be seated this morning. Hallelujah. Praise God. Amen. So from a message Easter Seal in 1965, Brother was saying of all the days and things that Jesus did, appreciating all of his vindication of God's word and what he did to fulfill it, such as healing the sick, raising the dead, casting out devils, preaching the gospel to the poor, fulfilling every word that God said he would do when he came. Amen. Suffering for our sins in ourstead to be the propitiation for our sin at the cross where no one else would have done it but he did it. Amen. Praise God. But above all of that, the prophet says, I think that Easter sealed the whole thing. Hallelujah. Glory to God. Amen. It's Easter morning. Amen. Hallelujah. He said prophets before on earth healed the sick. Prophesied raised the dead and did the same signs that Jesus did. He said, "But Easter proved it. It sealed the word of God forever for the true believer." Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. Amen. All gloom and doubt was shattered that blissful morning 2,000 plus years ago. Hallelujah. Amen. Glory. The glorious gospel, the good news. He is raised from the dead. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. Amen. Others were raised from the dead, but he died again. But my Lord, he's alive forever more. Can we say amen this morning? Praise God. Never man raised like he did. Praise God. Amen. Amen. I am he that liveth and was dead and behold I am alive forever more. Amen. Hallelujah. Yes, Lord. Thank you, Jesus. Give the Lord a hand of praise. Amen. [Applause] And from the message, Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever. He said if he died and went into a grave, that settled it. He's just another man like Buddha or Muhammad or any of the rest. And if he's not risen from the dead, he's just one of the philosophers, just a prophet. But if he's risen from the dead this morning, then he's God. He's immortal and he's with us now. Praise God. Thank you, Jesus. Amen. Glory to God. Amen. I serve a risen Lord. I serve a risen Lord. Praise God. God's not dead. He is alive. Praise God. I can feel him in my hands. I can feel him in my feet. I can feel him in my heart. Praise God. Amen. Somebody give him praise this morning. Hallelujah. Yes, Lord. He's not a God of brick and stone. He is almighty, all powerful, omnipotent, omniscient, omnipresent God all by himself. Give him praise this morning. Thank you, Jesus. Oh yes, Lord. Yes, Lord. Yes, Lord. Amen. Thank you, Jesus. Say amen. Glory. And from the message my redeemer liveth. I think that Easter is one of the greatest times. Amen. Listen to this. Are you ready? If there ever was a time that full gospel, Pentecostal, born again, regenerated people ought to shout the praises of God. It's on Easter morning. Praise God. Hallelujah. Somebody give the Lord a hand of praise. Hallelujah. Give the Lord a shout. Amen. Praise God. Amen. This is Easter morning. Amen. Glory. When you know that Easter is a memorial of what has happened to you. You were once dead in trespasses and sin, but now you are raised up and seated in Christ in heavenly places and knowing that your redeemer lives. Amen. Hallelujah. Yes, Lord. Yes, Lord. Yes, Lord. Thank you, Jesus. Glory to God. Amen. Thank you, Father. Glory. So this morning, Easter means life. Easter means resurrection. Easter means hope. There's hope for you this morning. Don't despair.

Yes, Lord. Give him a hand of praise. Yes, Lord. Thank you, Jesus. Glory to God. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Glory. Amen. Are you happy this morning? Praise God. Amen. So, God bless you this morning. My title is the purpose of the resurrection. I hope not to be too long with you this morning. Trust we'd be edified along the way. Amen. So, let's go back to the beginning. God bless you. So in Genesis chapter 2 verse 9 it says and out of the ground made the Lord God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food. The tree of life also in the midst of the garden and the tree of knowledge of good and evil. Verse 16. And the Lord commanded a man saying of every tree of the garden thou mayest eat freely. but of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it. For in the day that thou eatest thereof, thou shalt surely die. Amen. So God placed Adam in the garden and give him dominion over the earth. Adam could say, "Let this mountain be moved over here and it would do it." "Let this tree be plucked up and planted over here and it would do it." Amen. Amen. For he had a complete supreme control as a minor God under God our father because he was a son of God. Can we say amen? Amen. Adam had eternal life. He was supposed to live forever. There was no sickness, no sin, no sorrow, no fear, no death. But man in a perfect condition, man in a perfect state, man in a perfect envir environment disobeyed God's instructions. My do whatever you want. Eat whatever you want, but don't touch that tree of knowledge of good and evil. For the day you eat thereof, that day you will die. My amen. And Eve reasoned with Satan. Satan brought doubt to God's word, reasoning and questions, confusion and uncertainty, brother. Anytime thoughts come to question the word of God, that's the devil right there. Say amen. Praise God. Amen. Amen. Don't entertain him. Resist the devil and he will flee. Praise God. Amen. Satan is the tree of knowledge of good and evil. Hallelujah. Amen. And Adam chose to go the way Eve went. Adam was not deceived like Eve, but he chose to turn loose on the word and sold out. My Amen. My amen. The tree of life produced eternal life. But the tree of knowledge of good and evil produced death. Amen. Can we say amen? Amen. from the breach. Baram says, "Adam lost his inheritance, the earth. Now it passed from his hand to the one he sold out to Satan. He sold his faith in God to Satan's reasonings. Therefore, his eternal life, his right to the tree of life, his right to the earth belonged to him. And he forfeited every bit to the hands of Satan. He passed it from his hand to Satan. My from the Ephesian church age, man did partake of the other tree. And when he did, death entered into him by his sin and he became separated from God. So sin brought a separation. Amen. Amen. Man lost his perfect fellowship with God. Amen. His godship, his dominion over all things, his home, the earth, he lost it. He lost spoken word power and he lost all the inheritance in life. But then he lost life itself. My he lost eternal life. My amen. The scripture said in that day thou eatest thou shalt surely die. And the Bible said with God a thousand years is like one day. No man has ever lived for more than one day. Methuselah lived for 969 years which is still less than one day. Adam himself lived for 930 years. My and over time life was cut short to 70 years now. Three score and 10. My amen. Some people don't even cross 40. My but man originally was not supposed to die. Man was supposed to live forever. Can we say amen? Amen. Brother Brandham said it was God's purpose for man to live eternally or to share his eternal life with man. Amen. But death comes in. Tell me, what is it that any human being dreads the most? The fear of death. Amen. Am I going to die? You get sick. You want to You want to know am I going to die? Since the fall of man, Satan has used the weapon of death over the human race. God, you said they shall surely die. And you can't break your own word. So every man must die. My That's the devil. Amen. Adam died. Noah died. Abraham, the father of faith, he died. Job with all his patience died. Every man is born to die. Satan uses his power of death to lock up humanity as it were. Good or bad. Christian or non-Christian must die. It's a law of life. You have an appointment with death as it were. Amen. And Satan held the keys of death and hell and the grave. Not the deed to the earth but the keys of death, hell and the grave. My death that became a curse. We call it the curse of death. My my my amen. Amen. From a message greatest battle ever fought. Abraham says there are only two powers and two kingdoms. Yes. All the other minor things are connected with one of these two powers. Amen. It's God's power or Satan's power. Amen. And that's the power of life and the power of death. Praise God. Amen. Satan has got perverted power. It's no real power. It's a perversion of God's power. Everything that Satan has is perverted. Amen. Example, death is only life perverted. A lie is the truth mistold. Adultery is a righteous act misused. Everything that Satan has is something that was perverted. But it's still a power. Can we say amen? Amen. And these two powers, these two kingdoms are constantly in battle. Darkness versus light. Amen. Sickness versus health. Evil versus good. Death versus life. Oh my glory. All the differences between nations. Differences between each other. Differences in the family. Praise God. All everything. All monks up to two powers. God's power or Satan's power. My two influencers. Amen. Which one is influencing your life? this morning. You have to know that. Amen. Are you being influenced from above or are you from below? Amen. Abraham says, "Satan and all his corruption and deception is influencing and empowering the young ladies and the young men out there on the street to drink and cuss and swear and act in vulgar ways." Check yourself when you act. What is influencing you? What is influencing me? this morning. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Satan wants to destroy you. He's roaming through the streets like a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour. That's Satan's domain. Amen. Trying to pull your soul down to hell. Yes. It's a battle for souls. Two two powers constantly at war. One pulling up into heavenly places and one pulling down to hell. Who is influencing your life today? Amen. Amen. Amen. It's not your friend. It's not the internet. It's not the church. It's not even you. Sometimes we say, "Nobody can't make me do nothing." Oh yes, it's either God or Satan. Satan in the form of a friend. Satan in the music. Satan in the movies. Oh yes. Demon powers loosed upon the earth. Praise God. Amen. Hallelujah. And Satan tries to glamorize his power. He brings fear and all these things. But his power is limited. Oh, glory to God. Amen. Thank you, Jesus. Amen. The greatest power that the devil has ends at death. Beyond death, he can go no further. Hallelujah. Praise God. Amen. Amen. Amen. So he uses it to beat every Christian, beat every prophet, beat every disciple, beat every human being. The grim reaper come in with a sting of death. Amen. The power of Satan is the power of death. Amen. Amen. Amen. All the saints of the Old Testament were held captive after death. Glory to God. Oh, but thank God, there's another power this morning. Hallelujah. It's called the power of God. It's called the power of the resurrection. Can we say amen? Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Satan can take life, but Jesus said, "I am the resurrection and the life." Hallelujah. He that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live. Praise God. Amen. Praise God. Amen. Who's got the real power this morning? Who's got the real power this morning? Hallelujah. Amen. Glory. Hallelujah. So, Satan's power is to take a clean vessel and defile it. perverted power. Take a healthy man and make him sick. God has to give permission or to allow it first. He has no creative power. He's only a perverter. Take a living soul and pervert it with death. Natural death, spiritual death. My Satan's powers are li limited up to death and he can go no further. Amen. Amen. And brother Billy Paul say, "Poor devil." Amen. Poor devil. Satan brings sickness. But God will use that situation to build your faith and to show you that he is a healer. Hallelujah. Glory to God. Amen. Glory to God. He's Jehovah Rafa. Praise God. Hallelujah. Amen. Satan mashes you down to the ground, but God said, I shall restore, sayeth the Lord. He's going to restore you this morning. Praise God. Amen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. God works out everything for your good and for his glory. Hallelujah. Testify of his goodness this morning. Oh, hallelujah. Romans 8:28. For we know all things work together for good to them that love God. Amen. To them that are the called, praise God according to his purpose. Glory. Amen. Amen. Give the Lord a hand of praise. Thank you Jesus. Oh hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Yes Lord. Amen. Testify of the goodness of Jesus. Amen. Glory. So let's press on. Job had a concern about death. And from the message I am the resurrection and life. Job knew that the creator made all of his creation. Amen. He noticed that in the creation there was a resurrection of botany life and so forth from winter time to springtime. But he said a man lay down he give it up the ghost he wastes away and where is he? What happened to that man? Job in 14 chapter 14:12 man lith down and riseth not till the heavens be no more they shall not awake nor be raised out of their sleep. Verse 14 if a man die shall he live again. So he was concerned. He was troubled even. And brother Brandham says, "Then he saw by vision the coming of the just one." Oh, praise God. Amen. Job knew he was a sinner. And the reason a man had to lay down and not rise up, there was nothing could speak for him. He knew that the flower had done nothing wrong. Hallelujah. It was brought here for God's purpose. So when the flower died, it could raise again. But when a man had sinned, there was no way for him to ever rise in the presence of his maker. Hallelujah. Job in this condition of trial and hardness and sickness, hardship. He was permitted by God to see the just one. Hallelujah. What did Job see? Listen to this. Abraham said, "Job saw a man who could put his hand on a sinful man and a holy God that would bridge the way." Praise God. Between a sinful man and a holy God. Amen. Praise God.
