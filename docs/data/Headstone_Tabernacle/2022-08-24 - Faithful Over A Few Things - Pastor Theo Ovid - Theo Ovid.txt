learn of you and may your spirit write a word and confirm it with signs wonders and miracles and many deliverances or the service on sunday was flawless it was just on the operation of god and we just thank you for your hand of mercy towards us lord as you train us in this small measure that we could work while we're waiting on dynamics that will be speaking and things taking place granted father come tonight as we wait on you in jesus name we ask it amen god bless you for your bibles i'd like to turn to matthew chapter 25 one scripture we're going to have tonight 14-30 marty chapter 25 welcome tonight each and every one of you it's good to see all of you out here tonight reading from matthew chapter 25 reading from verse 14. for the kingdom of heaven is as a man traveling into a far country who call it call his own servants and deliver unto them his goods unto one you give five talents to another two to another one to every man according to his several ability and straightway took his journey then he that received the five talents went and traded with the same and made them other five talents likewise he that had received two he also gained other two but he that had received one went and digged in the earth and hid the lord's money after a long time the lord of those servants commit and recognize reconnect with them so he that had received five talents came and brought other five talents saying lord thou deliver unto me five talents behold i have gained besides them five talents more his lord said unto him well done no good and faithful servant though has been faithful over a few things i will make the ruler over many things entered out into the joy of thy lord he also that had received two talents came and said lord dog delivers unto me two talents behold i have gained two other talents besides them his lord said unto him well done good and faithful servant thou has been faithful over a few things i will make the ruler over many things enter into the joy of thy lord then he which had received one talent came and said lord i knew thee a dawah at a hard man reaping where thou has not shown gathering where thou has destroyed and i was afraid and i went and hid thy talent in the earth lou their daughter started dying his lord answered and said unto him though wicked and slutful servant thou is that i reap where i sowed not and gathered away i have not struggled though orders therefore to have put my money to the exchanges and then at my coming i should have received mine own with usury or interest take therefore the talent from him and give it unto him which had ten talents for every for under every one that act shall be given and he shall have abundance but from him that had not shall be taken away even that which he had and cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness there shall be weeping a nation of deep may god bless this world you may be seated oh praise the lord my we appreciate the service on sunday but isaac deliverance and restoration of your spiritual identity and uh he identified jacob wrestling and jacob knew he was a trickster he was a trickster you know and a guy could do all kind of stuff um to get by but when he wanted to go further he had was to get a change and that change means wrestling and um he he he got delivered and he raspberry angel and his name couldn't be the same because something happened with him and god changed his name from jacob to israel and that is where you get the tribe of the israel about birthday isn't that right the twelve tribes of israel so what i want to say is this if jacob didn't wrestle with the angel he couldn't get a name change and to wrestle with the angel it means that he had to mean business praise the lord he had to mean business isn't that right last wednesday night we spoke about sell all by that field and that was taken and jesus was dropping some parables again the kingdom of heaven they saw matthew 13 44 just to recap a little bit just to connect with this service tonight again the kingdom of heaven is like unto a treasure hidden a field which when a man had found it he hide it and for joy thereof go it instead of all that he had and buy it that feel again the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant seeking goodly pearls who when he had found one pool of great price went and sold all that he had and bought it so the key deal is when you see the value of this treasure hid in the field then you will know it is with all it is worth everything if if it's a gospel and his word all and there's a treasure sink into it throw your all into it oh praise the name of the lord amen praise god so tonight i have a title and the title is faithful over a few things faithful over a few things i have an inspiration as a question like last week and have would god trust you with more what god trusts you with more now the the thing of it is jesus was about to leave and the disciples asked him a question and the question was i think i'm going to get into it uh this is what matthew 24. now we read my 25 the magic 24 it says as he sat in the mount of olives the disciples came unto him privately saying tell us when shall these things be what shall be the sign of thy coming and of the end of the world and jesus answers them to them take heed that no man deceive you number one don't let them deceive their deceive you because their spirit reception upon them guys for many shall come in my name saying i'm christ shall deceive many you you shall hear of wars rumors of wars see there should be no trouble for all these things must come to pass but the end is not yet no jesus was a master teacher so jesus begin to bring parables and these parables unlike the one we read last week which was discovering put god first the kingdom first discovering the treasure hidden in the field the next two parables that is in matthew chapter 25 is actually pertaining to his coming the first parable is the parable of the wise version and the foolish virgins you would hear him say the kingdom of heaven is like unto let me just get in there quickly i want to read it uh the exact wording of it praise the name of the lord matthew chapter 25 let's just take a look at that then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins which took their lamps and went forward to meet the bridegroom five of them were wise five are foolish they that were foolish took their lambs took no oil with them but the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps this is people this is dealing with the coming of the lord okay while the and the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps while the bagoon carried they all slumbered and slipped and at midnight there was a crime made behold the bridegroom cometh go you ought to meet him then all those versions of rose and trim the lamps and the fool is said onto the whites give us of your oil for our lambs are gone out or going out and the wise answer say not so at least there be not enough for us and for you but go you rather to them that sell and buy for yourselves now while they went to buy here comes the bridegroom the bridegroom came and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage and the doors were shut afterwards came also the other virgins saying lord lord open the earth he answered and said to them i say unto you i know you're not watch therefore for you know neither the day nor the or when the son of man commit and then he brought this second parable and this second parable is what we're going to look at tonight for the kingdom of heaven is the man traveling until far country he's going for a fire journey and he gave his servants stuff to deal with isn't that something else oh praise the name of the lord okay so let's just drop our background i'll be gonna get into it all right here but lot wanted the world and god taught his world and separated abram and lord lord being a type of a carnal believer who didn't think these things were true he just went down into sudden he didn't have the real spunk to stand out as we call it and call right right and wrong wrong now all these believers as we could go on for ours all these will like a bunch of change out of your pocket in god's hands you pull out a bunch of chains they are pennies they are nickels but they are dimes they are quarters they are half dollars they are dollar all in coins now that's what the will is in god's hand there are some people that can just have a pennies worth of it and god can only use them in a penny way that is all they can buy don't reject them if they can't believe the real truth don't turn them down don't kick them out and say they're not in it because god uses pennies sometimes lot was a penny abram was a silver dollar so we take a hundred lots to make our abraham a hundred carnal believers will never stand in the presence of a genuine christian that is separated from the carnal things of the world living in christ jesus so you're seeing that the believers is like a bunch of change in god's hand some could buy a pennies wood some could buy a nickel's wood some could buy half a dollar wood some could buy a dollar wood all have different values are we getting somewhere with this okay now people lay on their faces some men come to me i believe i seen one of the boys back there in the building i met this boy coming and received the holy spirit from up and then boys come to me and say no brother branham no how now that we have been saved and received the holy schools shall we go seeking gifts i said don't do it don't do it god gives his gift sovereignly gifts and callings are without repentance the first thing you know you go to seeking something god you just make me a preacher you just do this and to me and what you're going to be a big stuff should you will go to someone's theology some organization and there you'll be a pillar yourself and conquer let god do the calling god will call you god will sanctify you god will give you what he has need to give you yes sir we'll give the lord some praises amen so all that you need of god put inside of you because gifts and calling are world repentance isn't that right are you ready tonight here we go you can't bargain for grace you can't be it can't be sold you can't bargain for it no it can't be bought it can't be traded for praise god you can't tell god don't save this one don't deliver this one don't bless this one it's by grace we are saved through faith not of works praise god we can boast in ourselves there is nothing good we could do to deserve god grace god graces because he has that and he could release that oh glory to god it's got grace here to you tonight praise god not because if you're good or you're bad or whatever it is but it's just god's grace to you or give the lord some praises that's why you should praise him tonight you can't bag him for grace you it can't be sold it can be bagging for it can't be traded for you say well now lord i will go and join this great big baptist church or methodist church and pentecostal church i will do this and if you will do this for me it can't be back in all that the father had given me will come to me and no man can come except my father calls him first you just become a church member of that big church you won't be saved our talents cannot listen here we see our talents that we have we cannot earn grace by talents whether by singing talent preaching talent digging talent elder talent whatever talent we have we cannot earn grace because we have a gift the gift doesn't earn your grace grace stands on its own gift or no gift talent or no talent or give the lord some praises tonight some people are going free if god made me a preacher listen to these words that don't show his grace has been with me no no no it says grace alone that saves me it has nothing to do with preaching the gospel okay this is enough we can close off right here run around the building and shout and praise god and dance it has nothing to do gifts have nothing to do grace is on his own [Applause] not because i preach the gospel i am that's a saved one not because you speak in tongues you are saved no not because you preach you are not even saved just because you preach you are not saying because you speak in tongues you're not saved because you do any of these things first corinthians 13 prove so do i speak with the tongue of men and angels do i understand all mysteries of god a preacher do i do all of this and have faith with mountains i am nothing until charity comes in which is love and love is grace the grace of god that does it all oh glory to god i am nothing until i have charity which is love love is grace glory to god that's what we say when the sun shining and rain falling the rain will say i'm falling on the tomato tree but nothing in marijuana tree the rain is just fall so marijuana going pumpkin growing everything growing because grace is that that's what god is the sun shining the good and the bad oh hallelujah the blessing fallen all or give the lord praises praise god and god wants you to be like him you bless people whether they're bad whatever good whatever it is you still treat them right could somebody say amen oh glory to god hallelujah some people you have talents like these rock and roll kings that makes me sick i don't know he said okay i'll just keep that there he said no all right okay god's grace cannot be bagging for it cannot be talented into it is sovereign grace nothing in my arms i bring simply to thy cross i clean naked wounded just as i am without one plea but thy blood was shed for me and that thou bissed me come to thee o lamb of god i come it is grace grace wonderful marvelous amazing grace i feel the anointing sweeping in on that it's the grace of god tonight not because i've never committed reality i never fornicate i never lie i never achieved no it's still the grace of god praise god you don't like that man out there he said i'm not like that sinner oh dear i'm not i never did i never did i come to church i miss a service i pay my tithe and do all of that and that sinner out there they said lord have mercy upon me and jesus said that man outside more righteous than the man on the inside it's the grace of god oh give the lord some praises he didn't have to do it but he did that's why i could shout i could dance and praise god it's the grace of god that save us it's the grace of god and open my eyes it's the grace of god anointed since he behold i send you elijah the prophet malachi 4 message is the grace of god to show us we are not chickens we are eagles oh glory we are not methodist baptist pentecostals we are sons and daughters of the living god is the grace of god unfold the mysteries to us jesus told his own disciples unto you as given to know the mysteries of the kingdom oh glory to god that's why you speak in parables because in the parables of hidden things that you could see tonight that will benefit you oh glory to god hallelujah praise god are you with me tonight now this particular parable of jesus is a very significant and powerful parable and to me this parable brings a balance a balance with this modern christian world that feel and this generation and bunch of people that feel they are entitled just like the people in the message now think that entitled being the rapture because it all your love love you one thing you'll be with you and they're sitting on that and they're cooling yourself on the church bench that is not what is taught to go in the rapture you have to have rapture in faith to make the rapture you can't be thoughtful and peter gave a formula by using his words giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and the virtual knowledge and the knowledge temperance and the temperance patience and the patience godliness and put bronica and probably cancer and on which is the bond of perfectness which is charity which is the love which is the thing that cannot fail but peter gave the key by say giving all you use a word called diligence so this parable is very important it's a powerful parable because this parable shows how we have to manage what god give us while waiting for him to come are you with me this is identifying how we have to manage by waiting for him to come the question was asked if the lord coming next week should i continue planting the crops what was the answer that yes somebody go eat from it you don't sit down on a bench to say are wasting you coming lord are you doing nothing no you're not in the spirit the lord coming for you because this is the example of how you have to be prepared for him coming because in him coming you have to give an account of what has been allotted to you what has been given to you everybody getting something to work with oh give the lord some praises i want to hear a shout in the house everyone on earth getting something to work with to be ready when it comes hallelujah so the first servant he got five let's call it five thousand dollars or five million dollars the second one get two million and the other one get one million all right so god want and this parable goes beyond money and finance because this brings the question of accountability and this brings the question your own ability that god sees and if you notice he is not expecting a man with one to make what the 5000 man make because the bible speaks he gave everyone according to the ability so that master had resentment that master don't give him more than you can bear or more than you could be handled but we know if you'll be faithful and little you'll be faithful and much he wants to see your faithfulness because when you present what he presented them he said you are being a faithful in few things i could give you a ruler to be faithful over much over many things because i give you something a few things to manage to see how you will handle it to see how you will deal with it are you with me tonight trust god help us tonight so god wants some returns on his investment of your life of you so watch who [Music] praise god so he wasn't condemned this this this brother who buried what the master gave him i don't want to see the talent as a gift like a gift is saying oh i don't want to see it as that we could also type that but i want you to see it as what god give him to to manage and he wasn't condemned because he didn't get as much as say god how come you get five oh can we get one again a fight don't get fight for that you know because what god gives you is for you to deal with it so you take them so there's no need to be jealous or envious because watch it forget the two only five both of them produce a hundred percent five brought another five the two thousand man brought another two the one bear rated and to show you the master was on point he said for be a minimum you're going to put it in the bank and at least it will get some interest in it but you can't tell me your buried and then you say lord just what you give me is just for the hand in your back so you mean god wants returns yes he does he call him he call that brother an unprofitable servant don't call him unbeliever no because he need message unprofitable so matthew 25 jesus gave two parables pertaining to his second coming and then a statement that he ending separate sheep from goats the first one was the five wise virgins five foolish second one is about the talents about the faithful and unfaithful servant okay so the second parable deals with servants and stewardship with which have been assigned to them and accountability it can also be viewed as individuals i want to reflect over the scripture we read are we going to glean something from it tonight all right so part like a bible lesson but i trust that you'll be edified tonight because when i keep thinking about it and i keep going it over it was kind of shaken to me and you'll see why for the kingdom of heaven is the man traveling the fact country who call his servants and deliver unto him his goods under one he gave five talents another two to another one to every man according to several bill watch until every man according to his several ability let's stop right there so god give each one of us ability so you can put inside of the ability everyone have it several ability hallelujah by this element he could give one five two and one but each one has ability it's not like somebody's a monkey and somebody's a human everybody has the ability and god didn't give them too much to manage he gave them enough that they could manage it that they could handle it all right so likewise he that received two gained two he had traded five got five and he received one went down digging the earth and hid his lord's money after a long time hallelujah sometimes we will deal with the lord delay is coming what people are saying okay but after a long time so this is jesus talking about his second coming okay watch what happened here now and then now look after a long time uh the the servant of the lord comment and reckon it with them which is to give an account let me hear what you do with my business let me see what you do in the shop the store what you what you do with what i give you let me see so the one with five come and say lord you give me five like five more so i can say so god so when you look at this carefully then god's program is about increase is about profitability god have no time with waste and time because god does waste time the bible said he rested after he labored the first day the second day the third day he's doing creation and afterwards he rested from his works so god himself does labor even in his mind he was going forth labor when he was bringing forth us glory the god elohim laboring bringing forth us in his thinking glory doesn't when man fell he said by the sweat of thy proud labor oh glory to god you have to work oh blessed be the name of the lord if jacob wanted to change he had to work he had to wrestle with the angel and when he said let me go he said not yet until you change me i ain't letting you go you have to work you have to earn the right to be changed oh cliff the lord has shout in the house oh glory to god praise god this killing all them dead ducks in the messengers sitting down waiting for just something to just happen to them without pressing without fighting without battling amen all right let me just go forward you know outer darkness the unprofitable servant oh my my my mind all right let's go faithful and little faithful and much god and he said this if we could only get started god will do the rest so he's looking for us to get started yeah we talk about waiting upon god but the scriptures say he's greater than us adoption time when god can upon his fullness he's also waiting on us to get down to jordan he's written on us that we could buy the whole field he's still waiting on us that we control in or everything and become prisoners to the lord jesus isn't that right but i'm saying let me say something too united time we see the churches united nations enlightened it's united time of god and it's bright too and i say this with reverence and respect i believe the bride of christ is called i believe she is sealed in the kingdom of god i believe the mechanics is here they are waiting for dynamics to take over the earth so all this is prophecy seen this in vision abolition is called i believe she is seated in the kingdom of god we aim some of his ain't born yet but he's seen it called sealed i believe the mechanics is here they're waiting for dynamics prophecy hanging over you they're waiting for dynamics that will take her off the earth into glory in the rapture i believe it with all my heart we know we don't know how he's going to do it but he shall do it he is the dynamics so the dynamic is a person who gives the lord some praises he is the dynamics oh glory to god the dynamics is not a thing it's he is the dynamics watch this we just become members of the machine of the body forming ourselves into his image as we see him uniting himself with us in his works with his love gifts as he hands them to us just before the wedding supper and we are waiting and watching for that then he put the anchor down the dynamics of this church will be a refilling of the holy spirit which is acts 4 praise god acts 2 was the holy spirit on the day of pentecost acts 2 wasn't mary saying be it done unto me according to thy word that was next to acts 2 was they were filled with the holy ghost he said well not even confidence are going to come to you isn't that right or when the holy ghost came inside of them they had god inside of them first was called above us pillar of fire god with us in jesus christ now god came in them in man oh glory to god on the day of pentecost and man was changed forever we're going back to eden we're going back to the original we're going back to where we came from oh glory to god amen so let's nail this down now the dynamics of this church will be a refilling of the holy spirit is an old man bigger no mysteries after all the mysteries come forth the dynamics is still a refilling of the holy spirit oh glory with the same sensation with the same emotions with the same fire with the same staggering with the same power praise god let them figure that all out [Applause] [Music] the one without sensation feeling real nice something right nice you see here the dynamics of this church will be a refilling of the holy spirit and this is the path i want to get to that we have worked in a small measure what worked in a small measure while the headstone is coming down to unite with the body but when the head and the body unites together the full power full power you can't get the full power yet until the head and the body unite together so the power before that had to be a small measure that we could work with or give the lord a shout you see oh suddenly we had a prayer line we working with a small measure to do that because they come out with a dynamic strike yeah no prayer line you know praise god eyes open up death hear dumb speak devil get out oh give the lord i shall walk just a word going forward with power because god could be there the lord himself went everywhere with them confirming it would resign follow it the same pillar of fire that was with the early church going to be in the last church do you believe that he said if he is big enough to keep it and bring it to pass oh glory hallelujah god cannot lie hallelujah the dynamics of this church will be a refilling of the holy spirit that we have worked in a small measure while the headstone is coming down it's hallelujah we have a measure to work with while the headstone is coming down to unite with the body and when that head and body unites together the full power the full power of the holy ghost would raise up just exactly like that even the dead that is dead in christ for hundreds of years will rise in the beauty of his holiness and take their flights to the sky the dynamics is the holy spirit oh we need that we need that that dynamics which is the holy spirit and we are promised it i'm glad i'm so glad that god made that promise no man i make that promise and i wouldn't let no man take that promise away from me every man would is a liar but this what we preaching here tonight this is true because god said it man channeling my bread alone but every word i proceed out of the mouth of the prophets and gosh in our prophet in the last days just tell us how we gonna leave here it will take dynamics and the dynamics of the holy spirit oh gloria and he is the dynamics he is the big magnet and we all get magnetized to the headstone so when that magnet come down and you are magnetized to the headstone going to pick you up and you're going in the rapture oh give the lord some praises tonight oh hallelujah the dynamics is the holy spirit oh glory hallelujah hallelujah this is to the night we'll be along with you [Music] definition of faithful faithful is to be steadfast in affection or allegiance film in adherence to promises or in observance of duty given with strong assurance true to the facts and to the standards faithfulness is the quality of being faithful hallelujah now it's so it's so strange that brother with the one talent he didn't expect that response you know no he felt comfortable to say lord who will you give me i have a back to give you you lose nothing so what's that tell you from this parable that making a profit have to do with risk in other words he played safe the bible didn't tell all what he did when he buried it you know because when he buried it he'd want to do nothing he'd go by the bar he could chill you can relax yourself because what you give me is what they get but if you notice in the scriptures let me see what he said i think there's another i wonder if it's the amplified let me just get this in the amplifier let's see what they say here could you hold me mr second 1 25. praise the lord give me some praises [Applause] in the amplified it says here all right let me read here the one he gave five talents probably about five thousand dollars to another two to another one to each in proportion of his own personal ability then he departed and left the country he would receive the five talents went at once and traded with them and he gained five talents more that's part i wanted to get at once he didn't waste no time because profitability profitability he would i can't get it profitability have to do with work over time you don't get the profitability overnight and the longer you take to get started the longer you will get to be profitable it come like if you're corn seeds or you have pumpkin seeds or you have those seeds and you have sleepover you say boy you know man the potential i have here have a thousand pumpkin seeds yeah planted yet the longer you take to put it in the ground the longer you get pumpkin that you can sell the pumpkin you can tell all your family look on pumpkin seeds they have two dozen three dollars in fact the whole smoking season they don't want money but there's only potential like when you talk until you put it into the ground at once then nine months or how much month whether corn or whatever it is then you could be pumpkin go and sell and get the money are you seeing what i'm saying so that come like that man bury the seeds so at once at once pray is the name of the lord okay let's continue here now brother brown i'm just going to read this here a bit but and i we set out here with that sister moore's father and how he told me that in the early days back in those days when they were persecuted and turned out from everywhere that he was in a meeting once to where they had forbid them to worship the lord in the spirit and a group of people come up with shot and shot through the windows with pistols and rifles and an old sister standing in the floor with her hands up in the air praising god while the windows was being riddled with bullets from rifles and the bullet struck the woman's dress and fell to the floor without harm in her the spirit of god was taking care of the bullets that was coming their way then he said this we need to go back to a power of god and something that can do the same thing today persecution always gives strength to the church we have had it too easy we get slutful we get to a place where we don't want to move on because everything is handed to us are you ready it takes sorrow and tears and sweat and prayer and faith and promise to move forward in the power of the holy spirit that is a statement repeating it takes sorrow and tears and sweat and prayer and faith and promise to move forward in the power of the holy spirit that zeal and power that they had in those days has long time vanished from our assemblies i'm afraid if the windows would be shut out at night people would run everywhere and never come back again and another thing is too bad you know to think of those things happening like that yet it proves that the god that was in the old days is still god today the god that was ever remains god and he expect his people to keep their vows and their promises but when we get everything too easy then we let it slip along and the first thing you know we have gone from these things losing our inheritance wait a minute brother over you could lose inheritance yes sir what do you think happened to that man the master said take what he have and give it to the man with 10 talents and jesus put a claws under there to him who hacked more shall be given unto him who had not the little that he hath will be taken away from him he put it under there intellectual god said but it's not fear for how come that man attained already why ever take from imam with one again again here's why when jesus welcomed them he said good and faithful servant this dude who bury it he said wicked and slutful he's not good and on top are not good he's lazy what is it it's a promise god made the promise let's stay with it god promise it no matter you've got to have a battle if everything comes lazy you are overcoming they overcome by the word of god and their testimony the blood of jesus christ you've got to overcome something could somebody say amen let me say it good head soul tabernacle you have got to overcome something those who online tonight you have got to overcome something moving the obstacles doesn't mean you overcome asking god to take away the situation doesn't mean you overcome you have to want to overcome the situation that wrong you about you you have got to want to overcome oh glory to god don't say god just take this child take this and take this yeah you can take all of that but where what you're going to overcome to overcome you have to get a test you have to get some situation that's negative that is challenging where there's a mountain where there's a red sea where there's a lions in the lion then whatever it is praise god whether the fire the fiery furnace whatever it might be some to the waters some to the flood some trigger trials but all through the blood could somebody say amen you have got to overcome something are you ready you have got to have some obstacles and people that different and fuss with you and tell you your holy rollers and that put before you is a trial if you haven't got that then you're not even in the battle what did you join oh my praise the name of the lord look at that praise god talk about the short series two days almost done praise the lessons from the parable we can glean and we are nominated right here back hungry but i believe i trusted was waited to be here tonight [Applause] this is scary because it means that we have to understand god want profitability and god won't increase not just to rely upon your gift or rely upon your talent but add into it all right note one nothing in your life is a permanent possession whether car husband wife even all this relationship husband and wife is until that do a spa pattern is part of it until then we are stewards of managers this is my child this is my child for how long you're stewards over what god gives you god give your children guys alone god gave you a job and you're flashing and flashing and before the clock spinning too fast six years hit you and you know you're doing that job you're retired now i thought you had the job i told you it was yours wait gone they don't want you know they say sexy move on it is not yours it is what you got from god you are a manager not the owner and management is for time let's get that to your time you know i was given 120 years jesus was given to the three and a half years how much time do you have all what we have to do and accomplish is within t-i-m-e time here's why the day of accountability is coming that is what we learn from this it may take long but it's still coming like by the punjabi the day of recognition god told joshua meditate on the word day and night to have good success do you hear that it wasn't god coming to fight for joshua you know he said yeah what boss man you want that good success you meditated in one day and night and no man shall be able to stand before thee all the days of their life in other words it was conditional and just for doing what god told him to do you have to obey what god tell you to do so success is the product of our work that word is spelled w-o-r-k people don't like it they're still there quick mastery in any field is not an accident whether to play a piano a guitar a mechanic any field mastery is not flukes it's not by chance it's not by accident i'm a master piano player i remember when i had a guitar my channel was very small i used to take the guitar and play and they were so impressed i could still play that same thing right now afterwards when they get older i recognize i couldn't play at all because they were small like i do know all the fancy things you know i'm doing my hands something and i wear whenever some comedy come out but there was no song really i couldn't play from my book i couldn't read nothing is afterwards they exposed me i could take a piano and you know type of amazing grace or whatever the same thing could do up to them i'm not a master in that i can't play that i can fool around a little bit but i can't play if that people could play this thing but to be a mustang you have to work on it you have to improve on it you could stay at one level in piano one level in base one level and get one leveling mechanic one lap you can set one level you know but you can go higher but to go higher you have to study you have to apply yourself you have to be diligent and then you are recognized to be a master in that field whether you're a builder whether you're a bricklayer whatever it is the way you conduct yourself people know you are a master at what you do oh give the lord some praises hallelujah so you can't be a master without diligence diligence steady illness meaning meaning an energetic effort devoted and painstaking work and application to accomplish and undertaken hail so you understand when peter said given all diligence it's a steady illness not dead guess what people walk in the church you know what's going on with them they're walking like it but anyone people think about slides you know i'll come into jesus this morning stay home nobody forcing anybody you know i look at the church at the end stay home until i get fired steady earnest energetic effort when we say fate what it is he that committed god must believe that he is and he's a rewarder of them that diligently seek him that diligently is earnestly energetically enthusiastically seek him not half dead you are seeking god no half that way you're desperate like jacob when you're desperate to move differently every desperate soul move differently glory to god is one thing for the pipe in your house to be dripping is another thing for a room to catch on fire oh glory to god you can sleep all day months and years with the pipe dripping in the house that ain't going to do nothing it's just drip drip drip drip drip but if part of the hose gets on fire my god it could be dead tired fire coming your bones praise god adrenaline begin to pump because you have to get that fire out even though all oh glory to god you get desperate you call out to the neighbors you say pass the buckets and people come out and you make a big set of noise because your house is at stake well your life is at stake your soul is at stake and christ is coming and there's a day of reckoning coming oh glory to god hallelujah [Applause] a comfortability time coming oh glory hallelujah [Applause] [Music] and some even i was doing something and andre asked me some questions saying i have to do this you know how to go and do this you know i said because when the midnight pass over the clocks go back at zero and i have no storage of time i wish it could have worked at the time you're missing waste you could get back you don't have that you know every day it started back at zero so if you had prayed yesterday yeah coming back in here every time i pray i make every time no no no no no take it from today from tonight that every single day counts every single day you've got to do what you got to do oh give the lord a shout in the house oh glory to god you'll waste the years you'll raise the weeks you raise the seconds you raise the minutes they waste the years they raise time steadfast energetic effort devoted and painstaking work and application to accomplish and undertaken excellent diligence the quality of working carefully with a lot of effort the gift or talent is not enough life is about increase you cannot get increased without diligence working carefully with a lot of effort in other words hard work now when they say they traded in them days did not trade like stock it's not stock market traders you know it means that they were buying and selling it means they were applying hallelujah praise god principles to make this money thing work hallelujah are you with me it is god's property or the master's abundance given to you but it is your diligence and application would bring on interest or increase i think that word satan i have that written here oh glory it is god's property his talents that he give you hallelujah his substance that he give you what is your diligence an application that would bring on interest or increase note if you don't bring on increase what god has given the little you have will be taken from you mark that down tonight go back and listen to this tape go back and read the scriptures in matthew 25 if you don't get to increase what you have will be taken from you oh blessed be the name of the lord i'm finishing you should come please god's stewardship good stewardship involves risk that man who buried it he didn't want to take no risk he was playing it safe and that plane is safe he end up in stupid mode or foolish mode because he should have known he could take it to the bank and get some interest in the bank and i will show you by the scriptures he happened to talk you know all them bringing all their fellas just bringing lord you give me five i bring five i bring two i bring two but this dude this brother he's a lord i know he's a hard man wrong discernment wrong discernment he call me master hard man i know you're representing so you know he had the knowledge would a man do any mindy man business but here understand by discernment what is the man's pleasure because we are here for god's pleasure we are here for god's honor we are here to please god if he had known what he known he should have known what was pleased that man that man was his master oh give the lord some praises good stewardship involve risk good stewardship involved wise investment good chucks your chip involves putting your faith on the line if you don't move nothing and moving inside of you sometimes you have to put your faith out there you have to step out there by faith it's better you step out and fail than fail to try oh glory to god in other words better you're trying failed and failed to try put somebody say amen in the house glory to god hallelujah good stewardship involve excellence excellence is extremely good excellent is the quality of being excellent oh glory to god god i want to have her business god wants you to be excellent in spirit excellent in what we do how we do it he want that spirit from in us he want that attitude from in us whatever we do we do it as unto the lord we'll give the lord some praises good stewardship involves hard work oh glory to god in the room for no lazy thou shutful and wicked servant oh hallelujah glory to god three things it took to bring about increase resources ability and time and god knew the ability in each one of those brothers each one of those individuals he gave them the resource five two one and they give them time because he went away he gave them time to work on themselves he gave them time to work on what he was they were given or give the lord some praises i hope this strike you tonight hallelujah praise god hallelujah on the time the brothers with five two went at once at once this seized time which does not lap over to another day each day starts at zero each day the clock starts over it's only 24 hours every day you can get back your job you can get back your family but you cannot get back time you can't store time you can't bank time we don't have a surplus of time oh glory to god hallelujah hallelujah are you faithful [Applause] because he said good and faithful servant he wasn't trying to get you to produce what the two thousand man produces or the five thousand one he wants you to do with what you was given he was given a penny you could produce another penny or give the lord a praise offering it's not the amount was given to you it's what you choose to do oh holla that man choose to bury it and he end up foolish and get up cast into outer darkness three brothers same master tree brothers same a bit ability all them have ability three brothers both of them to show you is not the amount both of them get good unsaved and faithful servant enter into the joy he didn't say because you have five more videos five you're better than you wanted to it's not better better five and two was that like the same if that one had done what they do it was the same thing enter into the joy of the lord it's not the one given it's not what you're given you can't want more you can't jealous somebody i said if i had the gift whatever i have if i have this if i have that it's not what others have that you want to have what god get won't ordain for you he put in you he puts your ability inside of you he gives you resources and they given your time and one day time gonna run out the reckoning will come your comfortability will come [Applause] conclusion glory the words his lord said well done though good watch underlying good excellent good good and faithful servant because god has been faithful over a few things that's my title faithful over a few things faithful over what god gives you if you give you a penny or you give you a million you're faithful to handle and manage what god gives you [Music] you're off time i preach you can't manage a hundred you expect god to get ten thousand dollars you can't have ten thousand a million just as you blew what ten thousand you would blow a million to the lord said job well done not talked done action taken approval for a job well done good and faithful savant enter begin to play something that man how we view the master as a hard man and there's something he said that was very interesting he said i was afraid he knew the master was hard and he was afraid if he was afraid in the truest sense why didn't he do something to please him so i hide it i hide it so i wouldn't have any responsibility to manage it if some people don't like responsibilities let him do it does she do it just like some husbands put it on their wives go to their mother go to mother go to your mother they don't want no responsibility to the family to the children pastor device i was afraid the master on the other hand see that as wickedness he didn't expect that stripped he didn't expect that give an opportunity to serve given opportunity to bless to increase and he failed by bearing it the wicked and slutful savant he was lazy he wasn't diligent he didn't apply himself he didn't put it to work what was what and he said but what we see should make a church that would make a revival make it work on it i've always worked you know it have a course and have a price to pay let's all stand and begin to worship the lord heavenly father i thank you deny this exaltation to your people i pray that it will speak to them lord
