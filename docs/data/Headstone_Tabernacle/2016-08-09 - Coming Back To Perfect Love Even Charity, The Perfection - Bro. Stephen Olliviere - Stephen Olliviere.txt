no Perfection no Resurrection amen hallelujah hallelujah see how important it is if there's no adoption all right then we will never be fully redeemed then we will never come to Perfection then there will be no Resurrection so we need the adoption say Amen man the prophet say we need the adoption Hallelujah let's not with it now we need the adoption amen hallelujah praise God as we just Frizzle out into the tribulation somewhere the side amen but brother Ram says the Perfection brings on the resurrection right so when you see we coming into that Perfection you know your Redemption right now

your perfect love even charity amen the Perfection the fun of Love Elohim seven perfect SPS Give the Lord a hand of Praise amen Hall I'm not saying a single thought of mine everything here is what the prophet said praise God Amen I'm almost finished from Humble thyself if you want to get Somewhere With God all right never let an arrogant Spirit ever come around you and just to be sure you always hear about AR I looked it up it's says to be proud that's right a feeling of importance and that you are better or Superior to others feel that you're better than somebody else and so on that's an arrogant Spirit he said don't ever let that ever ever come around you amen amen don't let No Malice come in this is from Humble thyself no matter what anybody does and I'm preaching to myself too amen I I want to become this amen cuz The Human Side always want to kick up if they are wrong don't you never build up a complex against that person see amen amen amen praise God you be sweet and kind that's right remember God loved you when you were in sin amen and if the spirit of God is in you you will love the other person when he's in wrong amen say Amen somebody this is straight from the prophet amen amen hallelujah Glory see just pray for them and love one another Hallelujah and he said above everything love God and love one another Hallelujah turn around and greet your brother and

burned though you speak in with tongues and prophesy though you know all the Mysteries all right all right don't you take all your goods and fee the poor right These are nice religious things which are good and they are right don't stop doing them they are good but make sure you climb those seven steps all the way up from Faith to charity amen make sure the seventh th blood which is the life of

charity the bond of perfectness Amen even perfect loveall hallelujah amen hallelujah quot without it we are not even a Christian we are just striving to become a Christian amen oh God hallelujah and

her to go but sister hope had we gone to see something and to feel something and experience something she turned to barabam and said Billy you have preached about it you have talked about it amen but

praise God amen glory it was later on when brother Bram was taken beyond the curtain of time amen when he got there he heard it he said the people were in such a beautiful sweet Spirit a love atmosphere just loving and kind to one another he said that there was no lustful feelings there and so on it was just good it was just sweetness it was just perfection yes sir hallelujah amen then he realized what his wife hope had experienced it was perfect love amen amen amen hallelujah is that what we want today the perfect love of God Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Jesus thank you Jesus amen
