[36:15] speak the word only
[36:18] you remember that message
[36:19] speak the word only after he just came
[36:23] out of the pentecostal church came into
[36:25] the message in new york there and i
[36:27] think brother coleman had him speak and
[36:29] his message was
[36:30] speak the word only
[36:33] don't speak nothing else i don't know
[36:35] about this group and that group speak
[36:37] the word only so god bless you brother
[36:41] weskel and to see him still standing
[36:43] after all these years and uh been a real
[36:46] pioneer
[36:49] for this message and we trust that god
[36:51] will continue to bless him and give him
[36:53] strength

[40:37] everyone after
[40:39] the gift of jesus christ in his heart
[40:42] and so we are different
[40:44] but one thing brother obi i appreciate
[40:46] this this morning
[40:48] it was like a fresh wind
[40:52] came in when you said i'm not in south
[40:56] africa
[40:57] i'm in heavenly places
[40:59] that was
[41:01] set was from your heart
[41:04] and i like this
[41:06] this is where we are where we should be
[41:09] we should be in a place where there is
[41:11] no sin no sickness
[41:14] no trouble
[41:15] no
[41:16] filthiness
[41:18] and god sees this world
[41:21] like this
[41:22] and we should see it the same way
[41:24] it's this few is called the kingdom of
[41:27] god
[41:29] and we were born again we are in it
[41:31] brother branham said i'm since 33 years
[41:35] i'm in heavenly places
[41:37] and i never came out listen he said i
[41:40] never came out
[41:42] i checked myself
[41:46] and i have to do some repentance
[41:50] because this is
[41:52] something
[41:53] he said i never come out and
[41:54] have the confidence
[41:57] i said i will never come out in my
[42:00] life so he lived in that
[42:03] in that realm
[42:07] and
[42:08] peter
[42:10] and all of them
[42:12] first disciples they lived in that realm
[42:17] no demon could come into israel where
[42:20] they lived
[42:22] that was the presence of god with them
[42:23] all the time
[42:25] so praise the lord and i also
[42:28] enjoyed my son was showing me the video
[42:31] clip where i've said all the pastors
[42:33] came in front
[42:35] and uh
[42:36] and identified
[42:38] themselves
[42:39] we says
[42:40] let me read the scripture
[42:43] my title is lord prepare me and the
[42:46] scripture is found in
[42:48] chain saint john 17 24
[42:55] and revelation 20. 22-20
[43:01] saint john
[43:06] 17
[43:07] verse
[43:08] 24
[43:11] and she and here jesus says
[43:14] he is praying
[43:15] and remember
[43:18] you shouldn't even pray when you don't
[43:20] believe what you pray
[43:22] and just pray lord prepare me
[43:26] we shouldn't do this
[43:27] it's a prayer we pray
[43:29] we are singing it and we we believe he
[43:32] will prepare us
[43:34] and so jesus he believes what he is
[43:36] praying listen what he is praying father
[43:38] i will that they all
[43:41] also whom thou has given me be with me
[43:46] and where i am that they may behold my
[43:50] glory which so has given me for thou
[43:53] loves me before the foundation of the
[43:57] world
[43:58] and just before he said it is not only
[44:01] for them
[44:02] for these my disciples but also for them
[44:05] that will hear the word through them for
[44:08] them it is also and he prayed also for
[44:12] you and for me and his prayer will be
[44:16] fulfilled
[44:17] hallelujah
[44:19] and
[44:20] and if you get catch the inspiration
[44:22] this is not when the doctor says it's
[44:24] all finished
[44:25] this is
[44:27] for right now for this life to be with
[44:31] him
[44:32] all the time
[44:33] to have him with us all the time
[44:36] so we don't have to be scared and fear
[44:39] anything in jesus name god bless you you
[44:42] may be seated
[44:45] so praise praise the lord
[44:47] [Music]
[44:50] remembrance goes back to 1981 in
[44:53] december
[44:55] we were i think it was pretoria first
[44:58] pretoyah first
[45:00] and i have a special
[45:03] remembrance there
[45:07] brother coleman preached a message says
[45:09] speak to the rock
[45:11] and we have a quote also
[45:13] that i will mention after from speak to
[45:16] the rock and but what
[45:18] really
[45:19] touched me what i have in my remembrance
[45:22] was a song that sister gail was singing
[45:25] as a special
[45:27] and she was singing
[45:30] that was 37 years ago
[45:34] on the platform
[45:35] this song
[45:37] it sounds like this if i really have it
[45:40] in my remembrance make me pure
[45:43] make me clean
[45:44] this is a prayer
[45:46] so that you might be seen make me a
[45:49] blessing lord wherever i would be this
[45:51] is some part that i remember sister gail
[45:54] now
[45:55] eight weeks later i was in the hospital
[45:58] in intensive care
[46:00] with a diagnosed heart attack for three
[46:03] days
[46:06] laying there
[46:08] this song
[46:16] always
[46:19] day and night day and night
[46:23] been through me
[46:27] all the machines around me
[46:30] brother's sister
[46:32] whenever you sing a special
[46:35] thing from your experience
[46:39] you may not know
[46:41] what will happen
[46:44] what will be happening to these
[46:46] believers
[46:48] that are listening to the voice of an
[46:51] experience
[46:53] we have to become more sincere because
[46:56] the third pull has to do something with
[46:59] sincerity
[47:01] and with your heart it was sister heidi
[47:04] wright she spoke from the heart
[47:07] it was
[47:08] this
[47:09] brother look and uh
[47:12] these prosthesis fishes you know where
[47:14] the fish was
[47:15] come back to life
[47:18] they spoke to one another said we should
[47:20] go
[47:21] to this lady and tell her
[47:24] that we became christians and brother
[47:26] brennan when he heard it you see that
[47:28] was spoken from their heart
[47:31] and it it
[47:32] started something
[47:35] so it's so
[47:36] important to speak from the heart
[47:41] to truth
[47:43] and god does something he does something
[47:47] in these meetings
[47:49] this is
[47:50] very important
[47:52] brother coleman
[47:55] in
[47:56] port elizabeth 1981
[47:58] is brother twine i'm here
[48:01] is he is he still here
[48:03] he was here i don't see him
[48:06] but who was there in 81 in port
[48:09] elizabeth
[48:11] oh
[48:12] oh we have good remembrance
[48:14] we have good remembrance
[48:16] brother coleman was standing behind the
[48:18] platform
[48:20] and it was a real quiet
[48:22] auditorium he wasn't used this
[48:25] because
[48:27] it was a complaint there
[48:29] that people made too much noise
[48:32] and so brother roscoe said to his his
[48:35] church people
[48:37] stay in the back and no clapping
[48:40] no amens this time brother corman came
[48:42] in in the pulpit
[48:44] and stand before a real quiet
[48:47] congregation
[48:48] and then he
[48:50] he's he talks a quote from daniel
[48:54] where daniel was at the vision of the
[48:57] man
[48:58] standing on the water
[49:01] and you remember this and he compared it
[49:03] to revelation
[49:04] uh 10
[49:06] um
[49:07] to revelation 10 the angel coming down
[49:10] having his one his first foot on the
[49:12] water and one on on on the land and he
[49:14] compared it and he said
[49:16] i'm standing now before real quiet
[49:20] congregation
[49:22] and he said but if you don't want it
[49:27] then stand on
[49:28] me and proclaim time no longer
[49:33] and he said when joe got such a
[49:36] revelation he fell on his face
[49:40] but you go out and say it was a nice
[49:43] sermon
[49:45] and send the holy ghost in the people in
[49:47] the back
[49:48] couldn't keep it any longer
[49:50] they couldn't keep it any longer they
[49:52] come screaming in front
[49:55] and we had an outpouring of the holy
[49:57] ghost for about
[49:58] one hour

[50:11] of god was poured all over over the
[50:14] place now he spoke brother coleman spoke
[50:17] from his heart
[50:19] he said what he felt
[50:21] and he remembered but it is not right
[50:24] said we react like this
[50:27] when the revelation comes like this and
[50:29] the holy ghost in the people
[50:32] also made them do something real from
[50:34] their heart
[50:36] nobody had to tell them come come in
[50:38] front coming from do this jump or
[50:40] whatever
[50:41] it work by itself it works by itself

[52:59] of jesus christ
[53:02] healing comes to this body
[53:04] by two things the prophet said by
[53:06] brotherly kindness
[53:08] and by the world
[53:10] the word is restored
[53:12] and brotherly love
[53:14] is our part
[53:16] and if you don't know where you find it
[53:18] you find it at calvary
[53:21] all these glorious things
[53:23] you find at calvary
[53:25] hallelujah
[53:27] says the prophecy of brother branham as
[53:29] brother
[53:30] thompson mentioned
[53:32] uh in one of his messages
[53:34] brother branham is crying out he gets
[53:36] into a vision
[53:37] he says i see something
[53:41] they will be one of these days
[53:44] don't fear little preacher
[53:46] they will be one
[53:48] why
[53:50] jesus christ prayed
[53:52] he said say maybe one and his prayer
[53:54] will be fulfilled no devil can change
[53:58] this hallelujah
[54:00] praise the lord
[54:03] and there is a prayer of jesus christ
[54:07] in john 17 that will be fulfilled amen
[54:11] so the glory that jesus had with the
[54:14] father
[54:15] this is john 17 5
[54:19] 20 to 26 i don't read it you you know
[54:23] his prayer the prayer of our lord jesus
[54:26] in
[54:26] saint john 17.
[54:28] so he said so the glory
[54:31] excuse me so the glory is that jesus had
[54:34] with a father
[54:35] before the world wars
[54:38] is very important now
[54:40] in
[54:41] in saint john 17 17 he says
[54:45] he speaks about this he said
[54:47] father
[54:48] glorify myself with the glory that i had
[54:51] before you
[54:53] before this world
[54:55] came into existence
[54:58] so
[55:01] you have your idea about what kind of
[55:03] glory this is
[55:06] we
[55:08] would like to find out because
[55:11] there is a lot of promise
[55:14] in in a message from brother branham
[55:19] the glory of god
[55:21] this is a unspoken message only written
[55:24] out prepared for december 25
[55:28] 1965. he couldn't preach it anymore
[55:31] but in his notes
[55:33] he is he i got a copy from brother
[55:36] coleman or actually he allowed us to
[55:38] make a
[55:39] photo picture
[55:40] he had it on his table in his living
[55:42] room
[55:43] and he allowed us
[55:44] and but i feel it's so important
[55:47] that we should share this
[55:48] for the ones that never heard it
[55:52] as their brother
[55:54] branham had written out his glory came
[55:57] down to moses
[55:59] on a range in median four thousand years
[56:01] ago
[56:02] his glory came down to shepherds on a
[56:05] range in bethlehem
[56:07] two thousand years ago
[56:10] his glory came down on a range in
[56:13] arizona
[56:14] three and a half years
[56:16] open to us
[56:18] the seven
[56:19] sealed mystery of his words
[56:24] said
[56:26] had he written out on one page
[56:28] in his notes
[56:31] hallelujah
[56:32] so his glory
[56:34] came down see glory said jesus said
[56:39] glorify me with that glories that i had
[56:42] before
[56:43] the foundation of the world with you
[56:46] his glory came down and did something
[56:50] now if he did did it one time two times
[56:54] three times
[56:55] in a special race's third time so he can
[56:58] do it also for you and for me
[57:02] to do the same thing
[57:04] because we know in not a lot of
[57:07] of quotes and of the message and of the
[57:10] word
[57:12] but
[57:12] to catch the
[57:14] life in the world
[57:16] for our soul that's what we want
[57:19] hallelujah
[57:21] now god's glory is his divine nature
[57:25] it's his nature his glory
[57:27] is his attributes
[57:30] did you ever see this
[57:32] pyramid
[57:34] what's written inside
[57:36] said this is god's glory
[57:41] you will appreciate that
[57:43] and this makes us one as brothers
[57:47] with different ideas coming from
[57:49] different churches
[57:51] brother branham said the first
[57:54] 20 years or how it was in the first time
[57:57] after pentecost
[57:58] everybody was satisfied with jesus
[58:01] christ
[58:03] and and
[58:05] the great atmosphere in the hearts of
[58:07] the people
[58:09] and it sent it something started but
[58:12] became
[58:13] bigger and darker and darker all through
[58:15] the ages
[58:16] something started he said
[58:18] it started little fellowships
[58:23] somebody had the revelations on brother
[58:26] and they grouped
[58:28] around him
[58:29] his sister was very innocent
[58:32] he said they were not satisfied with
[58:35] jesus christ
[58:37] so
[58:37] she started to fellowship
[58:40] there
[58:41] with his brother or visit with that
[58:43] brother
[58:45] you see
[58:46] but the glory of jesus christ makes us
[58:49] one
[58:50] one again
[58:53] and this is what i want
[58:56] in all for all my life i want this
[59:00] so
[59:03] we so we know as you see if he knows the
[59:05] trick of the devil we are careful
[59:07] because it something can start very
[59:09] innocent
[59:11] and then
[59:12] it goes it goes
[59:14] by and by in the more and more in the
[59:16] wrong direction
[59:19] so
[59:22] how by hearing
[59:23] [Music]
[59:25] hearing his voice word
[59:27] promises
[59:29] this is the way
[59:31] we become partakers of his divine nature
[59:35] we know this intellectually
[59:39] luther
[59:40] martin luther had an experience
[59:43] and i say this because
[59:45] to said to show something
[59:47] martin luther has an experience
[59:49] he gave lessons to monks
[59:52] concerning
[59:53] psalms and scriptures and
[59:56] letters in the new testament
[59:58] and so he should speak to them about
[1:00:02] the
[1:00:03] roman
[1:00:06] letter to romans that paul was writing
[1:00:09] and so
[1:00:11] he got so
[1:00:13] nervous and angry with god and he said
[1:00:16] we as sinners
[1:00:18] we are so condemned and live in this
[1:00:21] condition
[1:00:22] how can we
[1:00:25] be such and you want us to be a
[1:00:27] righteous righteous as you are
[1:00:30] and he was angry against god
[1:00:33] and then the grace of god dropped down
[1:00:35] on him in the same way as the grace of
[1:00:38] god dropped down on him he the same
[1:00:41] grace can drop down on you and will drop
[1:00:44] down on you if you believe the world and
[1:00:47] if you obey the words very simple send
[1:00:50] all these things coming to pass
[1:00:53] so it's a grace drop down on him and he
[1:00:56] realized
[1:00:58] that when he believes this
[1:01:01] says god gives him his own righteousness
[1:01:04] and god's righteousness will work in him
[1:01:09] his eyes became open and and and he
[1:01:13] surrendered himself he started to
[1:01:15] believe his righteousness and it worked
[1:01:18] it worked in him he he told his friends
[1:01:21] he said it was like parodies was opening
[1:01:25] for me
[1:01:26] it was and it is it is
[1:01:29] paradise is opening for you
[1:01:31] if you start to believe the promise
[1:01:34] if you start to that you receive the
[1:01:36] holy ghost the holy ghost is for you if
[1:01:39] you started it is given to you before
[1:01:42] the foundation of the world is given and
[1:01:44] you start to praise him by faith it will
[1:01:48] come down hallelujah whatever you ask it
[1:01:51] will happen unto you but you have to
[1:01:54] believe it
[1:01:55] this is the key
[1:01:57] hallelujah
[1:01:59] and jesus gives the peter to key this is
[1:02:02] a key to peter sorry
[1:02:04] jesus gave him the key to open the
[1:02:07] kingdom hallelujah and he wrote it down
[1:02:10] he said
[1:02:11] by these promises
[1:02:13] you become
[1:02:15] partaker of his divine nature of his
[1:02:18] glory hallelujah
[1:02:21] by these promises hearing
[1:02:24] and hearing comes christ the word
[1:02:26] hallelujah and you hear the word and you
[1:02:28] say oh god so easy so easy when you
[1:02:32] until you surrender to it and it comes
[1:02:35] upon you this is god's way doing it very
[1:02:38] simple
[1:02:40] if you try to understand it you can
[1:02:42] never understand it
[1:02:44] it has it is his realm
[1:02:47] you see it is it's not possible
[1:02:50] hallelujah
[1:02:52] it's not possible
[1:02:53] [Music]
[1:02:54] like like we have no no access
[1:02:58] otherwise to this sea of forgetfulness
[1:03:00] as the prophet said so natural man has
[1:03:02] not and no access
[1:03:04] but if jesus christ is in you
[1:03:06] you go in that atmosphere
[1:03:08] said it's no more there
[1:03:11] it's forgiven jesus lived in that
[1:03:13] atmosphere all the time he lived all the
[1:03:15] time in the atmosphere when he came this
[1:03:18] atmosphere was coming with him when
[1:03:19] brother branham came this atmosphere was
[1:03:21] coming with him and the people stepped
[1:03:23] in this atmosphere and when you are
[1:03:25] coming this atmosphere is going with you
[1:03:27] because you will experiment your face

[1:07:27] comes down
[1:07:29] takes all the evil out
[1:07:32] the problem is
[1:07:34] we don't experiment
[1:07:36] enough
[1:07:37] in our personal life
[1:07:39] we think we go to church and send
[1:07:41] somehow we will get it somebody prays
[1:07:43] for us
[1:07:45] and and
[1:07:47] okay and
[1:07:49] however
[1:07:51] we don't take it really sincere
[1:07:54] we should be so advanced
[1:07:56] so advanced
[1:07:58] there are
[1:08:00] there are promises
[1:08:02] laying before our before us
[1:08:05] that we have no idea
[1:08:08] in such a greatness but we have to start
[1:08:11] and experiment
[1:08:12] with it
[1:08:14] so
[1:08:15] [Music]
[1:08:20] and
[1:08:22] here
[1:08:24] second corinthians 3 i give you this
[1:08:26] scripture but we always open face
[1:08:31] beholding as in a glass mirror
[1:08:35] the glory of the lord
[1:08:39] in other words his glory
[1:08:43] is reflecting in us you
[1:08:45] go in your little chamber
[1:08:47] close the door
[1:08:49] and
[1:08:52] such a chamber in as
[1:08:54] jesus said in
[1:08:56] palestine
[1:08:57] doesn't have a window
[1:09:00] it is a
[1:09:01] it is a little chamber
[1:09:04] with no window for uh for food to
[1:09:08] put food there to store foods here

[1:09:14] nothing from the outside
[1:09:16] you you just be with him your glory lord
[1:09:19] i experiment
[1:09:20] this is for me

[1:09:30] and it's tremendous
[1:09:32] it is so tremendous
[1:09:34] it changes me
[1:09:37] and i know
[1:09:38] some of my children are doing this
[1:09:40] and it changes us
[1:09:45] is something real
[1:09:47] it's not something in the head
[1:09:51] we are changed into the same image
[1:09:55] in his image we are changed just
[1:09:58] let it let it down the channel here
[1:10:00] we are changed
[1:10:04] if you say it for yourself by face
[1:10:06] lord jesus i am change
[1:10:10] see his presence comes down his glory
[1:10:13] comes down
[1:10:14] confirmation comes down that's the
[1:10:16] ceiling
[1:10:18] and this is still in this business
[1:10:20] hallelujah
[1:10:22] the lamb like nature
[1:10:24] i want to speak something about it
[1:10:27] we have strangled
[1:10:28] it brother
[1:10:31] brother branham spoke about this
[1:10:34] this glory
[1:10:36] we have killed when we were
[1:10:39] when we were
[1:10:41] raised
[1:10:43] as children first lie
[1:10:47] the first stealing
[1:10:50] is the first anger
[1:10:52] all this
[1:10:55] killed
[1:10:56] the lamb like nature it's not a literal
[1:10:59] lamb brother brahm said but in his
[1:11:02] in his

[1:11:05] maybe i have it here
[1:11:10] it's in your own heart see
[1:11:13] if you feel
[1:11:15] something
[1:11:16] tingling at your heart
[1:11:19] that's what it is
[1:11:21] it said attribute
[1:11:23] trying to declare itself
[1:11:27] if you feel
[1:11:29] i'm missing something in my life i
[1:11:31] believe the lord jesus i go to church
[1:11:35] but i
[1:11:36] i need something
[1:11:39] this is stinging from that attribute

[1:11:49] redeeming shepherd the great shepherd
[1:11:50] who left glory
[1:11:52] listen
[1:11:53] knowing that some of the attributes was
[1:11:56] lost on them great valleys of sin
[1:12:00] where the wolves
[1:12:02] and the animals would soon divorce them
[1:12:05] devours him said little sheep
[1:12:08] but he left the golden corridors come
[1:12:11] down into the earth and was made one of
[1:12:14] us so he could declare the love of god
[1:12:16] to us
[1:12:17] sir he found them some
[1:12:19] of them in their denominations
[1:12:22] he found me there also
[1:12:24] some of them in the house of ill fame
[1:12:28] some of them on the streets blind
[1:12:31] some of them in the hedges and highway
[1:12:34] but he redeemed everyone that's a father
[1:12:37] had ordained him to redeem
[1:12:41] hallelujah
[1:12:43] hallelujah
[1:12:46] so jesus he loved sinners
[1:12:49] that's what the pharisees hated on him
[1:12:52] said he had so much fellowship
[1:12:55] we see with these sinners they didn't
[1:12:57] even try to lift up their
[1:13:00] their hand when they were praying
[1:13:03] said and and and felt condemned
[1:13:07] and the pharisees in the back say look
[1:13:09] you see he doesn't even lift his hand
[1:13:12] so
[1:13:13] but
[1:13:15] he loved these kind of people
[1:13:20] and he still loves them
[1:13:22] he still loves us when we are falling
[1:13:27] he loves us so much
[1:13:29] and we are very stupid if we don't come
[1:13:32] to him when a child falls it goes to
[1:13:34] mama
[1:13:36] or papa if he is close
[1:13:39] he knows he runs
[1:13:41] and and if we do a mistake we try to
[1:13:44] hide instead of quickly immediately like
[1:13:48] brother branham he was used to do this
[1:13:51] he said i came in the plane and i was
[1:13:53] i got angry about a
[1:13:56] child
[1:13:57] said always cried
[1:14:00] and i got angry i thought
[1:14:03] cannot the mother stop this child coming
[1:14:05] from india or somewhere
[1:14:07] and then he confessed to his church
[1:14:11] and said he said if i go on like this
[1:14:14] i will lose a favor with god
[1:14:18] so little things
[1:14:20] if we do these little things in our
[1:14:22] families
[1:14:24] it will become heavenly
[1:14:27] it
[1:14:28] forgive me
[1:14:30] and
[1:14:31] say calvary makes all the difference
[1:14:35] there is where we get the spark to our
[1:14:38] knowledge to the mechanic
[1:14:41] at calvary i believe this
[1:14:43] i got my spark
[1:14:45] i did not know how to repent because i
[1:14:47] was raised as a child
[1:14:48] in a christian home
[1:14:51] and didn't know really i prayed and
[1:14:53] believed you know many know my story
[1:14:56] and
[1:14:57] i had a problem
[1:14:59] i thought how can i get the baptism of
[1:15:01] the holy ghost because i met some people
[1:15:05] that had this experience and i saw this
[1:15:08] is real i also met some that was
[1:15:10] imitating but i met some that was real
[1:15:12] and i wanted said and i had the problem
[1:15:16] but i
[1:15:17] i said i don't want to be a hypocrite
[1:15:19] and kneel down and say i'm such a bad
[1:15:20] guy i didn't feel that i'm a bad guy
[1:15:24] raised up in a christian home
[1:15:26] praying and believing the word and all
[1:15:27] this
[1:15:28] but never had a real experience
[1:15:30] with repentance
[1:15:32] and then
[1:15:33] i confessed it
[1:15:35] in a group of christian businessmen
[1:15:37] and and some some of them some of some
[1:15:40] of these people said
[1:15:41] uh oh this is not a problem
[1:15:44] i said no problem i would i would rather
[1:15:46] be a drunkard on the street and have a
[1:15:48] really experience with the lord and i
[1:15:50] don't have this he said she said no no
[1:15:52] it's another problem if you really want
[1:15:54] it you pray heavenly father give it to
[1:15:57] me and he will give it to you
[1:15:58] this is this is it's an old pentecost
[1:16:01] hallelujah
[1:16:02] and and we did this because we wanted
[1:16:05] said my wife and myself
[1:16:08] and we met calvary
[1:16:10] hallelujah
[1:16:12] we prayed
[1:16:13] and god opened up
[1:16:15] and if you need anything just pray
[1:16:18] don't wait pray and believe
[1:16:22] remember always don't just pray
[1:16:25] without
[1:16:26] thanking god that he is doing this what
[1:16:29] you pray
[1:16:30] we should not all our singing also in we
[1:16:33] are praying in our singing we shouldn't
[1:16:35] just
[1:16:36] not sing like this and and
[1:16:38] but no when we sing thank you lord you
[1:16:40] are doing this you are doing this i it
[1:16:42] will be fulfilled in my life
[1:16:44] it is a continuous fellowship with the
[1:16:46] lord our life hallelujah
[1:16:50] forgive me that's my way
[1:16:52] that's how i build
[1:16:55] brotherhood i admire you
[1:16:58] you can drive it down brother condo also
[1:17:01] when he comes to
[1:17:02] tonight i believe he will drive it down
[1:17:05] hallelujah but this is my way and it
[1:17:07] works also
[1:17:09] hallelujah god bless you richly
[1:17:12] hallelujah
[1:17:16] continues and he said but he left the
[1:17:19] golden corridors came down into the
[1:17:21] earth and was made one of us
[1:17:25] he was made one of us isn't that
[1:17:26] something
[1:17:28] left his glory
[1:17:30] to be one of us
[1:17:34] and he said even father
[1:17:36] glorify me
[1:17:38] again
[1:17:40] and the voice came i have done it and
[1:17:42] will do it and the people heard asunder
[1:17:46] hallelujah we know this
[1:17:49] so
[1:17:51] and but he left the golden corridors
[1:17:52] came down into the earth and was made
[1:17:54] one of us so he could declare the love
[1:17:57] of god
[1:17:58] to us
[1:18:00] there he found them
[1:18:03] some in damnation i read it already some
[1:18:05] in the ill-famed house on the streets
[1:18:07] and he redeemed them all
[1:18:10] is that something
[1:18:13] his attributes
[1:18:16] got lost in the valleys of sin
[1:18:20] but he redeemed them
[1:18:23] and
[1:18:26] yeah praise the lord
[1:18:33] we know so much scripture
[1:18:37] and how much do we practice it in our
[1:18:40] personal life there's another scripture
[1:18:41] that
[1:18:42] i really
[1:18:44] came over it
[1:18:45] jesus said no man puts a piece of a new
[1:18:48] garment upon the old
[1:18:51] if otherwise then both in new make it
[1:18:54] surrender it runs and and the peace that
[1:18:56] was taken out of the new agrees not with
[1:19:00] the old
[1:19:02] so
[1:19:03] it is
[1:19:04] a problem in our life
[1:19:07] if you just take one piece
[1:19:10] one revelation
[1:19:12] and lean on that
[1:19:14] and then
[1:19:17] don't come to the fullness in our time
[1:19:20] this fullness his glory is promised us
[1:19:24] and this glory
[1:19:26] will bring
[1:19:27] the adoption
[1:19:29] the perfection
[1:19:31] the fulfillment
[1:19:33] of everything in the rapture
[1:19:36] i believe in this glory
[1:19:39] it is jesus christ his glory and there's
[1:19:42] where the power lays i believe
[1:19:44] surely is in the world
[1:19:46] sure all his glory lays in the world but
[1:19:49] there's two things
[1:19:51] you see you can say
[1:19:53] oh we have taken from his fullness
[1:19:55] everything
[1:19:57] he has given us free everything is true
[1:20:01] but did we receive it
[1:20:04] did we take it in this is the question
[1:20:08] brother branham said
[1:20:11] jesus is coming i hope i have it
[1:20:16] you you have patience with me here thank
[1:20:19] you
[1:20:22] but here i want to read the real
[1:20:25] the quote he says
[1:20:29] confess you wrong
[1:20:31] burst pains
[1:20:33] this is a secret isn't it something that
[1:20:35] god helps us
[1:20:37] if if we come before him and confess it
[1:20:40] it's so important
[1:20:42] it's so important he says confess your
[1:20:44] wrong birth pains it's hard to die but
[1:20:47] die right now die
[1:20:49] come out of your own unbelief
[1:20:52] and the devil wants to keep us with
[1:20:54] little things that we don't confess
[1:20:56] in in our unbelief
[1:20:58] and we confess
[1:20:59] then we have an experience against as
[1:21:02] his glory comes down in our soul
[1:21:04] and we are growing by that we become man
[1:21:07] and woman in the in in this in this in
[1:21:10] this message in this life
[1:21:12] come out of this conditions this is the
[1:21:14] word of god made manifest just as it was
[1:21:16] when jesus came on earth it is jesus
[1:21:19] christ again among you proven
[1:21:26] it is good to come to to church and to
[1:21:29] praise him and worship but also it's
[1:21:32] good to
[1:21:33] go in in a corner sometimes and say lord
[1:21:36] jesus
[1:21:37] you are living in me
[1:21:40] make fellowship
[1:21:42] with sincereness it is a serious thing
[1:21:45] it's not
[1:21:47] just polished up
[1:21:49] just
[1:21:51] trained
[1:21:52] it's a serious thing in the heart the
[1:21:54] third pull has to do with our hearts
[1:21:58] we will speak from the heart
[1:22:00] and things will happen we will just
[1:22:02] three standings here and the love of god
[1:22:04] will drop down and take all the evil out
[1:22:15] brothers we cannot afford
[1:22:20] to not love
[1:22:22] and i mean real love
[1:22:25] one another
[1:22:26] if we have this glory in our hearts
[1:22:30] that makes us always one
[1:22:32] under the shed blood
[1:22:34] it makes us always one
[1:22:37] and if you hear this pray about it
[1:22:39] pray about it
[1:22:41] it could change it could it could come
[1:22:44] to a revival it can bring a revival and
[1:22:46] here
[1:22:47] there is one thing before i close i want
[1:22:49] to read
[1:22:50] this brother branham said
[1:22:53] in the message burst pains 65
[1:22:57] he said and jesus is coming again
[1:23:01] this is our subject will he find faith
[1:23:04] does the son of man find faith this is
[1:23:05] our subject of this convention now i
[1:23:07] read this here and jesus is coming again
[1:23:11] brother branham said that's his spirit
[1:23:14] thank you lord
[1:23:17] now you can do an experience with jesus
[1:23:19] coming
[1:23:21] this is my way
[1:23:23] still some may not agree i may have a
[1:23:26] better idea i don't know but i take it
[1:23:28] for myself said is his spirit
[1:23:30] he is so close to the earth
[1:23:33] so close to coming
[1:23:36] that he is ready
[1:23:38] to receive you
[1:23:39] if you are ready
[1:23:41] to receive him
[1:23:52] if martin luther would live in our day
[1:23:57] i believe
[1:23:59] he would experiment with his
[1:24:02] experience
[1:24:04] concerning the righteousness of god
[1:24:07] and
[1:24:08] and all these great
[1:24:10] characteristics of god
[1:24:12] he had experience there
[1:24:14] he hadn't we
[1:24:17] the time wasn't
[1:24:19] so
[1:24:21] it wasn't the season
[1:24:23] it must always be also in the right
[1:24:25] season for him
[1:24:26] so but if he would be in our season i
[1:24:29] believe he would experiment
[1:24:32] with his experience concerning the
[1:24:34] righteousness of god said open paradise
[1:24:37] for him
[1:24:38] he would
[1:24:39] experiment with this quote
[1:24:42] he is so close to the earth so close to
[1:24:45] coming
[1:24:46] said he is ready
[1:24:48] to receive you
[1:24:50] if you are ready
[1:24:52] if you are ready to receive him
[1:24:56] at least
[1:24:58] you should say in our heart lord jesus
[1:25:00] comes home
[1:25:03] comes home
[1:25:04] says the spirit and the bride
[1:25:06] says speaks the same thing
[1:25:09] see a turning in their hearts together
[1:25:13] in in
[1:25:14] the spirit and the bride
[1:25:17] says the same things
[1:25:19] come lord jesus
[1:25:21] comes home
[1:25:23] and it is it is a way a personal way
[1:25:26] to receive him
[1:25:29] brothers and sisters of god has given us
[1:25:31] a key in this little afternoon meeting
[1:25:35] if we use this it will change our life
[1:25:39] secures just believe
[1:25:42] subvert
[1:25:44] take it in your heart receive it
[1:25:47] yes
[1:25:48] so it shall happen to me
[1:25:51] and then
[1:25:52] wait
[1:25:53] and adore him and praise him
[1:25:56] and the glory of god will come down and
[1:25:58] seal it in your heart
[1:26:00] and then as a new life
[1:26:02] god bless you
[1:26:04] for a mighty service tonight this was
[1:26:06] just a little preparation
[1:26:08] all these things
[1:26:09] you find at calvary
[1:26:12] anyhow let me
[1:26:13] here i have it
[1:26:15] the last quote is okay
[1:26:17] that's cool
[1:26:18] here
[1:26:20] we know this a message speak to the rock
[1:26:23] that where brother brother coleman
[1:26:25] preached in
[1:26:26] uh
[1:26:28] pretoria
[1:26:29] here
[1:26:30] uh brother branham says
[1:26:32] the gospel came to us
[1:26:34] not in word only but through power we
[1:26:36] all agree demonstration of the holy
[1:26:38] spirit we heard it this morning would
[1:26:40] come and demonstrate the gospel bringing
[1:26:43] the word to a living reality that's
[1:26:47] that's our theme
[1:26:49] rather which
[1:26:51] brings the word to a living reality
[1:26:54] and then he continues
[1:26:57] this is what we want a living reality
[1:26:59] and here he continues if your trust
[1:27:02] receives the word so it's a different
[1:27:05] ways of receiving
[1:27:07] we
[1:27:09] if if you he said if you receive him
[1:27:12] he is ready to receive you
[1:27:14] it's a different way of receiving we
[1:27:15] must we must catch this now he said if
[1:27:18] you just resist the word by knowing the
[1:27:20] word
[1:27:21] that doesn't
[1:27:23] you any good
[1:27:26] this is what we learn in sunday school
[1:27:27] and and go through the process and then
[1:27:30] we go in church and grow up like this
[1:27:33] and this this is
[1:27:36] not doing any good to you
[1:27:39] select achilles
[1:27:41] the spirit give his life
[1:27:43] then you must be born again and then the
[1:27:46] holy spirit quickens the word to you
[1:27:49] yeah i know i must be born again but how
[1:27:52] can it happen to me
[1:27:55] you must be worried and saying the holy
[1:27:56] spirit quickens the word to you
[1:27:59] in other words
[1:28:01] like a grain of corn if it's laying in
[1:28:04] my hand
[1:28:05] it is just a grain of corn it will never
[1:28:09] be nothing else
[1:28:11] and here it comes
[1:28:14] but bury it
[1:28:17] sets
[1:28:18] why we died with him at the cross
[1:28:21] buried with him
[1:28:23] and resurrect with him but it is a
[1:28:25] process and it kills you
[1:28:27] and it
[1:28:28] has it has pains in it tremendous pains
[1:28:31] but bury it
[1:28:33] it comes
[1:28:34] listen
[1:28:35] it comes
[1:28:37] contaminated
[1:28:39] brother robledo did you know this quote
[1:28:42] yeah
[1:28:43] he said
[1:28:45] bury this corn this seed
[1:28:48] bury it
[1:28:49] it comes contaminated
[1:28:52] you know we don't want to see it being
[1:28:55] contaminated
[1:28:57] jesus christ the seed of god got
[1:28:59] contaminated at the cross say spit on
[1:29:02] him
[1:29:03] say did everything with him with his
[1:29:05] body with his soul his spirit everything
[1:29:09] it got contaminated and same thing with
[1:29:12] us
[1:29:14] we cannot go around this but bury it it
[1:29:16] becomes contaminated molds
[1:29:19] dirt all around
[1:29:21] and then it brings up another grain of
[1:29:24] corn
[1:29:25] just like it
[1:29:27] you see we speaking about the seed and
[1:29:29] the real seed
[1:29:31] and we once said because in the real
[1:29:33] seed the real seed has a power
[1:29:36] the power working so normal is a seeds
[1:29:39] the word seed
[1:29:42] has it in it but
[1:29:44] it's not working in us if we just know
[1:29:46] it
[1:29:47] it doesn't help
[1:29:48] so we must dive with our lamb and it's
[1:29:52] painful
[1:29:53] you have to tell him
[1:29:55] sis
[1:29:56] i'm so wrong
[1:29:58] you have to have your personal
[1:29:59] experience all all the time
[1:30:03] i'm so wrong father but you forgive me
[1:30:06] you are so great you're so glorious your
[1:30:08] glory is so great and you get a baptism
[1:30:10] you
[1:30:11] you you get another baptism
[1:30:14] another baptism in another ceiling is
[1:30:16] another feeling
[1:30:18] and we have to go through this process
[1:30:21] very it it becomes contaminated with our
[1:30:24] stinking
[1:30:26] ego our stinking own self-life
[1:30:30] what we are what we what we are
[1:30:33] self righteous and all this we know we
[1:30:36] know how we know how we are
[1:30:40] so if we come out of of this system
[1:30:43] uh god will help us
[1:30:45] this is our place where we all die with
[1:30:48] our lamb
[1:30:50] and there you get this power experience
[1:30:54] that he is the same for me that he was
[1:30:57] yesterday's same glory
[1:30:59] and you get an
[1:31:00] assurance said what what comes out of
[1:31:03] your mouth
[1:31:05] is from him
[1:31:07] you get an assurance what's come out of
[1:31:09] your face
[1:31:11] to your family is from him we need this
[1:31:14] let us be more sincere
[1:31:16] and let us prepare our hearts in this
[1:31:18] way god bless you
[1:31:20] [Applause]
[1:31:41] amen appreciate the words
[1:31:45] [Applause]
[1:31:48] is that your desire to be a sanctuary
[1:31:52] for the glory of god
[1:31:54] to be living in you
[1:31:56] not just in church
[1:31:59] but at home
[1:32:01] where nobody's looking
[1:32:03] just to talk to the lord
[1:32:06] just to have that eternal fellowship
[1:32:08] like the prophet had
