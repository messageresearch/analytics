feet everybody amen as we welcome the man of god a real man of god who has uh really been a real blessing and as i said it's not many people that i really uh have confidence not men i don't say that there's many good friends of mine that i do have confidence in but there's a unique confidence in brother theo over because i see the hand of the lord upon him and not only that i see uh where the holy spirit is trying to get his people amen he spoke about a vision last night amen we know the vision without a vision people perish no that's right you have to have a vision amen and not only that then then there's got to be a road map how to get to the vision see and eventually we'll be living in division amen you see so therefore i believe very shortly amen that god by his grace amen will help us enter into that place where we can dash into the holy spirit amen into that presence of god amen in every promise every thing that we desire we can go in and possess that and remember it's ephesians when they cross over the jordan brother branham said that the miracles and things could not be made it wasn't it was couldn't be done in the wilderness israel didn't possess anything in the wilderness couldn't be done in egypt but as soon as joshua crossed over who did he meet amen he met the angel of the lord amen he could do those things things that he could never do in the wilderness sun stand still amen he didn't have that premeditated in his mind he had a knee amen the enemy was running and he knew that if the enemy would would run away they had a chance to regroup and he had a knee and he just spoke at sun stand still amen hey man and that's where uh amen you'll see the miracles take place is in ephesians which is the message of the hour amen amen do you love him amazing grace how sweet the sound will get the preacher on to the pulpit and take your time [Music] amazing grace how many love brother theo over we love him with all our hearts amen amazing grace amen how sweet the sound [Music] is [Music] if not for grace where would i be [Music] [Applause] [Music] is where would we be this morning lord without your blood and our sister rebecca beautifully sang lord the blood lord oh written and read yes that is where the price was paid it gave us this opportunity for fellowship thank you and we pray you've come into your word this morning and speak to our hearts we need to hear your voice you need to hear us say the lord speak to us and we'll be changed lord speak to us and our lives will be different from we need to hear it above the intellectual level and into the level of divine revelation and vision come and break the bread eagles this morning and speak to our hearts and transform our lives and confirm a word with signs wonders and miracles we ask in jesus name amen god bless you so good to be here i want to thank our blade of his wife and church for the opportunity to be here it's a blessing and a privilege there's such a fine quality of spirit here this morning i'm here last night uh i'm blessed so if you have bibles i'd like you to turn to three portion scriptures this morning genesis of the 26th uh joshua chapter 13 and revelation chapter 22. from genesis 26 we want to read from 12 to 22 joshua 13 from one to two and uh revelation 22 verse 17. genesis 26 reading from verse 12. then isaac sowed in the land and receive in the same year a hundredfold and the lord blessed him and the man works great went forward and grew until he became very great for he had possession of flux possession of hurts great store of servants and the philistines envied him and all the wells which his father servants had digged in the days of abraham his father the philistines that stopped them filled them with earth and abimelech said unto isaac go from us for we are much mightier for thought much mighty than we and i have departed dance and pitches tent in the valley of jira and dwelt there and isaac digged again the wells of water which they had digged in the days of even his father for the philistine had stopped them after the death of abraham and he called their names after the names by which his father called them and isaac servants digged in the valley and found there a well springing water and the herdman of jira did strive with isaac's his men saying the water is ours and he called the name of the place essec because there's truth with him and they dig another well and stove for that also and he called the name of it sitna and he removed from dance and digged another will and for that there's truth not and he called the name riverboth and he said for now the lord had made room for us and we shall be fruitful in the land amen joshua chapter 13 verse 1 and 2. now joshua was old and stricken in here and the lord said unto him though at all and stricken in years there remaineth yet very much land to be possessed this is the land that yet remain it all the borders of the philistines and all issueri our last scripture familiar scripture revelation 2017 and the spirit and the bright sick come let him that hear it say come let him that is the tears come and whosoever will let him take the water of life freely father may you bless your word once more we ask in jesus name we ask it amen and amen god bless you you may be seated o praise the name of the lord amen well i i wouldn't say i'm on strange grounds i'm going to strike something i never did before i've never been preached in my church i got something since i was on the 18th of july and i knew i felt that this is to be spoken here praise the lord so i kept it like another treasure chest and i'm opening that chest and this morning i'm going to speak on it and the title is detailed well amen the subject is spreading the bites they come an inspiration crushing jordan by the spirit of forgiveness into the land of ephesians o praise the name of the lord crushing jordan by the spirit of forgiveness in the land of ephesians and and paul prayed the prayer in ephesians for this cause i bowl my knees unto the father of lord jesus christ for whom the whole family in heaven heard his name that he would grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with might in his spirit in the inner man so there's an inner man there's an ultraman but he wants you to be strengthened in the inner man that christ may dwell in your hearts by faith and that he being rooted and grounded in love may be able to comprehend with all sins what is the bread the length the death the height and to know the love of christ which pass it knowledge that you might be filled with the fullness of god filled with the fullness of god amen praise god and to know the love of christ which passes knowledge and oh my my knowledge shall increase but we have to get into the love of christ amen which passes knowledge isn't that right because we could know all things we can know all mysteries but if we don't have this charity we are nothing amen and this is what i was referring to last night dear jesus but i'm praying for a man running from the presence of the lord he said help us tonight in these few words as we wait upon thee and we pray that your grace and mercy will be with us and tend our hearts move back the shocks the thorns the tissues let the blessed sunshine of god falling upon the word lord and may we have such a meeting till there'll not be an unsafe person among us all the children will be in the kingdom of god amen i'm liking that good kingdom it just raises you above this church thing oh glory to god isn't that right amen the kingdom of god those without the baptism of the spirit may they receive it father here we go may all the great mysteries that we are supposed to know at this age lord be unveiled to us that we that we will see the plainness of god so that we know how to behave ourselves and act amen correcting ourselves and bringing the members of our body into the discipline of the word amen that we might know how to live in this present day at the approach of the lord jesus so the purpose of the reveal of the mysteries wasn't for education no it wasn't for information it was for us to see this is god to see the plainness of god to bring you into our god consciousness because remember we lost our god consciousness because we were born in sin shape iniquity like we said those children born into monarchy in england they're born into a certain environment they have to take the child and place the child and groom the child in that environment that's right then the child's consciousness is royalty so when they on the on the track chariot or chariot on the uh i don't know what they call the carriage and so on and people will even they expect that amen amen if nobody waves they call them they will face my word in other words this is the prince this and the prince's that and everybody waving and waving everybody want to wave and have flags and so that is what they're supposed to do because that's royalty but you were royalty amen that is what you come here to get into a consciousness and awareness and that's what we say last night the bible said you shall know as you are known that's right think about that now you shall know as you are known you don't know yet what god knows about you but one day you're gonna know as you are known amen oh glory to god we seek you a glass darkly but then face to face we know impact we prophesy in part but when that which is perfect has come a perfect realization of where you come from where you're going who you are and whose you are oh [Applause] so the message is come out of and going into that's what it's all about that's right many people come out and argue come on first we'll quote come out and foster one another like i was preaching sometime i was talking about david and his brothers and david now come here father sending some food for his brothers and so on so david get there and they're trying to embarrass david they're trying to tell david this and david tell us certain goliath is over there but if david killed he wants to [Laughter] david the little david he's not qualified for the army and david is the man to defeat goliath because david have a backside of the desert experience amen that is unknown to the minister association hallelujah giving her a backside of the desert experience that's not known from everybody else all you have is a simple testimony when i was seen about the sheep a beer came and i dealt with him and the lion came and i dealt with him at that dude out there that giant out there he lost in his head and i don't even have a sword because i have the testimony of jesus i have the spirit of prophecy i'm anointed to prophesy because god is with me oh hallelujah praise god hallelujah and as long as you know god is with you move forward amen speak and move forward let your steps be of faith that is what redemption is coming out of and going into now watch oh my i'm all over that's okay now i'm in the spirit amen the fifo ministry is not just fifa ministry these are not men and cats and child horses heal the fight for the other fightful that's not god read what it is for the fifo ministry is for the perfection of the saints for the work of the ministry till we all come of the entire stature oh glory to god so all these positions in god just like government if you have a prime minister would have a president it'd have members of parliament it'd have um different senators and different things all they have a job to do you have the garbage collectors have the postal worker all them have jobs to do if one shut down it affects everything yes sir oh if the garbage can let's say he's not collecting garbage if he didn't live not the call of government new york would be a whole big stink so we need everyone to be in position amen all glory of god is the position that god putting you in amen hallelujah nobody can live without you oh hallelujah you are part of this glorious body nobody can put you out nobody can kick you out you can't be excommunicated from the kingdom of god because you cannot be deported you belong there that's your kingdom that's your king oh you are citizen you have access rights i'm not gonna take that that's what you could do no listen as a citizen you can knock on god's door [Applause] [Applause] oh and afterwards you start to believe it's not going to work out i recognize listen you may be seated man forget the notes we're going to get to this well just now i'm at home i'm feeling great this is good i feel right back home amen oh hallelujah i recognize that people don't believe in miracles no more that's right that's right like i said they have faith for the doctors and they pull them pills take two take three and this two of them and just do that for me one two three four whatever the doctor say he's looking like dusty at the lord and the bible says you're by your stripes you are healed and when when you pray for you have to have the faith and the confidence that god is working on you right now hallelujah you may not feel anything but he is working on you he's almighty god and we want to acknowledge him he is still god without you whether you believe him enough he has killed god he is god here this morning he can heal you this this morning diabetes cancer tumor it doesn't matter female condition praise god prostrate condition we throw some of these sicknesses out of here in the name of jesus oh power in the building is here in the building oh hallelujah guess what become your fault oh hallelujah hallelujah oh hallelujah praise god praise god praise god praise god hallelujah [Applause] i love the worship i love to praise god when you're getting the spirit revelation get breakdown upon you right now angels descending there's an angel that's here right now hallelujah pray the manifestation of the holy ghost is that angel trying to get people back to the word of god oh hallelujah oh praise god oh glory to god don't be surprised you may be seated because the spirit has to come upon the bride because the bride becomes the word and the spirit comes upon the brain to give the bride a voice the prophet said the bride will have a voice all the world will hear direct from god once more the pride will be given my voice and the spirit and the privacy come amen a clean bride a blood washed bride oh the voice of god will be in that bride nothing going to stop allah oh glory to god there's pride going to know her god because the revealed world is your husband despite going to know and the people that know their god shall be strong and to great exploits this pride going to know the god of the light of dark live where is the lord god of elijah that god god lives tonight for the hour when sons of god could one drop down the road and say silvan goldhamer he knew he had it but he wanted to see it multiply he was the wave sheath that was waved over us to testify others are going to come we are the sons of god prophesied to be here in the last days anointed sons god filled sons we have those sons they are coming they are coming amen oh hallelujah oh glory to god those sons are coming those sons are on their way we need them you hear what i said we need them to stop cancer to stop diseases to stop the bad weather we need them oh give the lord a shout praise god praise god the prophet said cancer gonna be uttered to what's coming but we are striving to enter the kingdom before these plagues strike [Applause] here we are a little small group but the holy spirit is here we are striving striving there were sisters in the spirit and they were worshiping and carrying on and some men gave me some shotguns and pelting bullets through the service and those bullets just bounce and they close and fall off those systems are bulletproof we are brothers who are fireproof you are lion proof you talk about a supernatural my god oh hallelujah sometimes i want to challenge people upon their faith stop sitting and warm in a church bench get active in god many of what about experiences wasn't even in church people saw church grounded it was also in the amen and in the forest he said let there be a squirrel it wasn't in churches or speak scriptures in church or give the lord a shout you come here to be empowered you come here to be anointed you're coming to be inspired that you can face your trials and deal with your situation [Applause] hallelujah we are not catholics you may be seated [Music] that's what we're here for look at the consciousness of god consciousness oh hallelujah that african slave he was so conscious you see the others who were not sons of skins couldn't have that that's right this man alone had a revelation because it was inside it was his divine right by birth amen his father is a king his environment didn't change that oh and we were born in sin and shape iniquity but my father is a king though has made us kings and priests unto god and we shall reign on the earth rain on the earth to release to conquer the rule to overcome to put under your feet to have the minion over that is the water terrain you want to rain and you're wondering if god could do a miracle come on now what i recognize believers believe that these americans passed oh my god they're not saying that with their mouth is a subconscious unbelief because you're not looking for a miracle your father that big teacher grandfather diabetes the great grandfather and you next says who i said change that amen hallelujah change that i don't care what my line has had i'm not taking that we have a word we have a faith we have a god that can confirm his word we don't have to accept that i'm not accepting pressure this or that i'm not accepting that i'm gonna go free as we say already the people finally there's the people on the earth they're gonna be dead proof oh hallelujah gonna stop this man oh the grim reaper could only challenge you and wave is coke stick whatnot but they have them do with you you have a performance to be changed by satan will be so angry when that break get caught up when a bride get caught up the great devil will be angry with the remnant of the woman's seed that foolish virgin [Applause] the book to be sealed with seven mystery seven revelation revelation 10 out of the loudest and last messenger of the church age and these seven mysteries several missions have been left off he said no watch he said looted pre-justification my fate and common wesley signification but we are promised a quadration 10 according to malachi 4 luke 22 17 and so forth that there's got to come another ephesians to this yes this is promised friends not groups ephesians hallelujah and we find ephesians is a parallel of joshua so to preach ephesians where the prayer joshua and there's more land to be taken some people figure they satisfied with a couple of books and tapes on the prophet and there's plenty like they have a whole load of books and tips there's more land to be taken amen you see the word spirit now from profession to possession real land to be taken the only problem is yet across jordan they take it so it doesn't make sense don't use it binoculars and saying way looking real good let's check the map again let's check these books and these tips and so on you know you only spying over because jordan right there but you only spine hey you can't fight no philistines you can't fight the job you're looking across hey man you have modern technology you're zooming in and zooming out you're bringing the picture closer to you but you're not crossing jordan that's right because there's a weight across jordan there's a spirit atmosphere to cross your head amen there's something that will kill you because jordan represents death that's right that's right all of these woods dropped when the spirit of forgiveness comes upon you then you are free then you could see the person without getting a fight like one time i wanted to meet that brother i i want to know if i had something against him i want to meet him because if i have something against him how can i shake his hand properly if i have some kind of funny business so i reckon he's docking me and say brother see because you see you don't want that you want clarity in your spirit amen amen and you will see why to be a channel of charity and that's why brotherly kindness you could feel with that but brother the kindness is the platform for charity to come upon faith is based upon forgiveness amen so all this turn your heart back to the fate of the fathers and you're grumpy mean and nasty i want earth that could be the fate that was delivered that can't be before the woman have a baby a sweet spirit comes over her that's right regardless if she's a prostitute that's god's operation amen amen that sweet spirit that's probably kindness supposed to come upon the bride before the church is built into a manifestation because the sons of god have to be born listen into manifestation amen did you hear that yes sir jesus born grew up and he came to maturity and he came into manifestation by coming to identify the book and say the spirit is upon me and he begins to do the works of god that's right but sons of god have to be born into manifestation amen amen so we are promised another ephesians is predicted in the scripture and therefore i believe we are living in ephesians again back again we are living in what was left off in the street ages so alpha and omega that's what it's all about so that god hit from the devil and put it under the seventh seal this unfolding of this ephesians and put the thunders to make the bridge to unfold that amen oh hallelujah praise god amen listen though we said no we are in the last days we are given to understanding by the word we are going to understand it because it will come and efficiency it so you will not you know always you're not supposed to be confused by any promise that's right it's too late for that it's over 40 plus years brilliant random of common earth there shall be no confusion amen there should be clarity of mind and purpose and vision as to what we're looking for we are looking for dynamics to our mechanics not just dynamics floating in the air to your mechanics you become god mechanics you become grata god machinery you become part of god's body and the dynamics coming down to pick you up oh give the lord some praises hallelujah thank you jesus glory to god amen amen says now you see what coming on to the jordan meant we are done here now let's cross over let's quit playing let's cross to the other side now because it all belongs to us them visions never fail they can't fail because they come from god i believe it all has written me we are not the highland that will run back into the wilderness we will cross jordan prophecy amen the separation god breaks us the seals in the back of the book let us enter into this great place now for joshua divided to the people the inheritance that god has left them amen joshua had to take three things to do cross over jordan fight conquer the land and divide you cannot be violent if the land is not conquered amen amen you give somebody a portion philistine coming together that's right you can't do that you have to literally conquer the land and then there's that people just cautious cautious and then okay let's come in front and say listen i'm not going to talk on everybody behind i come to talk about my give me my option that's right i'm not talking about the tribe i don't want anybody else i just want what god promised me amen step forward and afterwards people have to make their claims hallelujah give me the book go and say take the book i love that i love that one say give me the book yes sir take the book and eat the book oh hallelujah god requires a jordan in every life oh you believe that amen and there's approach across jordan i believe that is really the spirit of forgiveness and god allow a lot of things to happen to test our attitudes to see how we will make out and sound like that oh my oh my oh my god so listen to this the scripture we read in genesis 26 who is one of gera this is amplified call with isaac huzman and say the water is ours and he named the world essec that name means contention because they qualified him and then they quarrel over the next well they call it now that means enmity and the third one no no more recorded over it well they call it real but because room there's room for all of us amen oh do you believe that amen all right so but obama's talking about here the lutheran church lost his light medicine lots of light the pentecostal church lost her light all lighting to be gone the church has no conscience no more you could hardly wake them up the bible said they will come in that day low the lord delay is coming and they'll be devouring and biting one another and fighting around it's exactly at hour that's something going to take place he said no she had a whole steering time she scrubbed the floor she swept the walls she took on the cobwebs you can't be proud and do that now if you're proud you wouldn't do that because your daughter your neighbors see half dust and how long you had the dust but this woman didn't care she swept the floors she throw the cup where neighbor said look at that garbage in front of that house yeah never you better check your garbage but that woman wasn't caring because she knew charity was coming she know the king was coming she knew her husband was coming so she decided to have a house cleaning time and when we leave here we're going to have a house clean in time oh glory to god forget your neighbor amen amen forget what allah is talking about one brother what brother accusation and what kind of stories against him he said just wind up his glass and could you try it i kind of like that why not the glass pony air conditioner and continue driving you can't even hear what they're saying out there and you will survive it will come true because when you hear and this is the point you say at them boxes see when they're going to win those heavyweight boxes and it's time to win must watch bombs they'll be talking to one another i'll beat you in the you don't say nothing that's right in your mind because that man just beat you you hear what i said i'm gonna beat you because you're trying to win the mind you win the fight before the fight that's what the devil does that's right no you're supposed to say put back devil if you don't say that if you don't say i'm going to be you see it for i'm going to turn wrong and that's the problem with us we keep hearing what the devil's saying and we're not saying anything back we have to begin to speak back get the lord and shout on that she swept the walls she took down the cobwebs she kept on until she found what she had lost and when she did she called her little sister churches to

there was silence oh glory to god hallelujah i'm a mystery and who are you this morning you are mystery from under the seventh shield that's why we america that was supposed to be lamb now becomes a dragon that's what all this is are transitioning for america right now no more the land of the freedom but the brandon prophesied they were raised up by pharaoh that no not joseph that's right he said praise god a president that knows not freedom of religion oh it's coming you stay right there all glory to god have much to say inside of here this message today i feel is dusty of the lord oh glory to god is what god once spoken hallelujah love supposed to get off desperate but if love to bring desperation conditions well is there a pressure going to come on the church oh and we'll drive the people together we'll give the lord some praises they don't want to come together they don't want fellowship on the love spirit and right say come but fire judgment files please we couldn't have serviced because the access road to the church was flooded the church was fine but to get there all over the train that was flooded heavy flooded flooding never saw before whatever causing it whatever it is but it means the level of judgment it's everywhere you know every nation will be shaken by the things coming up on the earth nothing will stop it it's called perplexity men are feeling for fear for the teams that are coming upon the world but there's going to be a people that have faith that this ephesians gonna come forth amen because joshua was his ephesians when he said son stand still all these brothers were anointed in their position to declare god and unveil god when the hour came and we're gonna have to do the same amen we carry blind books and tapes that angel come you're just holding a box on tape to see that there's only blood to talk back to me amen oh glory to god only blood amen he was asking to see blood amen and in this hour is seven drops seven spirits seven virtues seven thunders seven so all the mysteries have to be translated amen i see this way when you go to our country you have to get the money monetary currency yeah come to america u.s dollars you go to

amen so a prostitute could come inside here take faith take out even walk back [Applause] out god have to respect the currency once you present it you have to honor it amen it's a currency yes sir amen did you get that the centurion man he came he watched us for a while watching his operation he understood what was happening that's right he understood the law and the principle what was happening he said i am a man under authority that's right and i said i want to go on a go so what he was saying i recognize you are under authority that's right and you can speak therefore don't come to my house no just speak the word amen and jesus marveled he wasn't a baptized believer he wasn't in the message i'll give the lord a shout but yourself and got healed he was a roman you are not romans have you heard that all things are possible to them that believe there is no land to be taken there is more land to be taken common believers there is no land to be taken a remember there is more land to she came up in the prayer line she was listening hearing everything else and when she came up she just hung by around the crutches and walked back out hey man no prayer she walked up the line long enough to know that this thing is over she had him the crutches and just walked back oh glory to god that could make anybody shout and dance and give rejoice when faith takes a hole something supernatural has to break out and we want to break up in here today that's what i'm here for to dig the third well oh hallelujah praise god oh glory to god let's go let's go let's go let's go mind jesus hallelujah when the church finds it burning up when the church finds whole decency when the church finds its place in christ it will call to the other members of the body come and rejoice with us god wants the church to love him not stay away from us we have a private is a lunch is a public ministry amen i will go after the loss and have lost in the message nice precious saints messed up in their mind he said jesus okay the church has to take his position we are called the adoption of sons by the holy spirit when each man takes a position what god has called him to do stand on the inner road going after the loss oh my so god in the days of the exodus he called a group or that group i want to notice he only got two went to the promised land isn't that right yes sir praise god the first success what did he do he brought him from a natural land to a natural land the second exodus from a natural land to a spiritual condition the baptism of the holy ghost amen and now he's bringing them from the spiritual baptism of the holy ghost into the land of the millennium amen oh glory to god hallelujah amen hallelujah three steps iran forgot his road inside the most holy place and overnight it budded blossom and produced almonds oh my god when a man is anointed he goes inside the deer the rose brought forth the perfume and it run along the plum the iron speared and it went before him with blood dropped behind the curtain the world couldn't see him no more and every man woman or girl that ever is anointed of god walks behind that veil of god the holy ghost is in a secret place and the world's chopped behind him then he said here now looter the blood spirit justification what watch spirit water blood spirit now this last great step must come into perfection that the holy spirit has to live in that church so perfectly it will make the head and body unite together amen this last great step oh glory to god let's continue a little bit he's talking about adoption the tutor brought word to the father that there was to be a placing of a son and we have we have seen watch and the same son that was born into the family could be abducted into the same family or placed in the same family or give a position in the family he was born into and i do believe that is what the work of the holy spirit today among the church is trying trying to place in the church positionally apostles and and teachers and prophets and so forth and we have seen here we go many false alarms go forth among the people which only vindicated indicated real genuine adoption was at hand for adoption listen listen remember what we reached last night about royalty and so on listen up around words he was taken out in the public place and he was robed on a robe past purple or some color of royalty royal robe to those sons oh my and was set up to the whole city they could look and he was here oh my the next move of the church is for god after you have seen for salaam but now god will place in his church correctly god will do that amen not a man picking man man choosing man god sets in the church not some man set in the church okay so god will place in his church correctly apostles prophets teachers evangelists not man made cemetery borton is important but god will place into the church not theology runovers and overnights but go god placed in the church as god has chosen as the holy ghost has tutored oh my hallelujah praise peter jesus oh hallelujah you love him jesus amen oh my my mind there are three states of the journey we're going good page 13 out of 30. just like 17 more pages don't worry all right there are three stages of the journey and there are creatures on this journey but we are justified by faith believing on the lord jesus and so did israel in the wilderness to join us no place of rest traveling night and day fall in the pillar fire but finally they come to the promised land where they settle down israel had not received their promise but they were on their journey so god can't give inheritance on your journey don't leave it here put it in that land oh praise god amen amen hallelujah amen you love it yes sir praise god says but the believers in the kingdom is just your outfit that was going on to the promise they move over into the land and took the land as a possession let's not go on to the battle of the holy spirit let's not stop believing in the lord jesus being baptized but we go on to the promise of the holy ghost itself how god has set in the church through labor pains they get tremendous sometimes or when a church is growing this is one of my favorite quotes if you're hearing my siblings you might hear me question this over and over and over see policy always echoing that same thing because it's it's so real to me when god has set someone to church through the labor pains they get tremendous some time i want a church has grown in under the prosecution of the outside world believe in our lord jesus yeah we go that the promise of the holy ghost is just as real as it was to the pentecost how they groan and cry on the labor beings but when they are born and positionally born into the kingdom then god has set in the church apostles and prophets and so on like that oh praise the name of the lord amen glory to god amen amen god is trying to please his church in position to manifest himself amen manifest himself so all these sermons and teaching like you know people like to talk about teachers and teachers and their preachers you know this preacher is sinner and evangelist to talk to the sinner and teach us disposition he plays the believer and i ask myself what are the believers being pleased for you have to be placed for power so it comes right back to the spirit it's not just teaching to be taught and preaching evangelism in this end time is not regular evangelism he said evangelism is shaping stones amen so eventually end time evangelism is not regular evangelism end time evangelism is cutting and shaping you to fit into god's program amen that is what that is about amen so god is trying to place his church in position to manifest himself getting one he can walk through like this and say dear it's my spirit freely adopt him place and manifest and take him out there and visit him with an angel tell him something if he's just making it up it won't work i mean manifestations of sons of god when god manifests himself he sends him out when he goes forth what he says is truth what he does is the truth what he does he manifests christ how do you judge him by the way he stays with the word right with the word oh glory to god so this weak word bride would have signs wonders and miracles isn't that right and she'll be following after second peter 147. isn't that right and the other church the other crop going to be second timothy one to nine amen oh glory to god having a form of godliness with all kind of attitudes and bad behavior and christian-like behavior you want to know the people even saved oh hallelujah that's right that's right that that is second timothy oh glory to god amen but it says in revelation 22 17 the spirit and the bride say come over hallelujah so let's take that to it well now oh glory to god hallelujah amen the first world they fight on it the second world they fight on it but the third well there's no more fight because there's room for all of us and i want to declare here in new york there is room for all of us oh give the lord a shout praise god hallelujah glory to god in him so second kings 3 15 to 18 now bring me a minstrel gave the pass when the minister played the hand of the lord came upon him and he said thus say the lord make this valley full of ditches for thus say the lord you shall not see wind neither shall you see rain yet the valley shall be filled with water that you may drink both ye and your cattle and your beasts you imagine that the prophet spoke it just dig ditches you're not going to hear when you you're not going to see ring but water coming yes oh that's good that's good amen in other words you're not regarding the condition the situation oh hallelujah but you know the power is coming amen the mountain is coming the blessing is coming oh glory to god hallelujah hallelujah thank you but i'm saying no he this is on eagles 13 s and the strange thing about it is only this morning i recognize but abraham mentioned about the three worlds i never searches any message i just got it from the scriptures so it's only this morning before coming here i said let me search to see you brother ever mention anything about this this is what he said he said he can't let the gentiles go into the kingdom without first vindicating himself as messiah to them at the end of the age here just friends because we are here i don't want you to think i'm trying to boast up full gospel people just because my feathers are the color of theirs that isn't it there is room for all of us jacob duck detoured well and said there's room for all of us methodist baptist presbyterian who will let him come oh give the lord so what are you going to do right over take a tail whoever first with the first one first with the second one but on this two step on this state face on this two pole on the state exodus forget it there's room amen hallelujah but about him talk about this he said you know jacob look at well and the philistines run away and they call it malice and running from it they call it strife you talk another one and you say the room for all of us god dawg are well in the lutheran church they run all the rest of them away from it he don't go well in the methodist church on the signification luton was justification and signification he don't go well you're running from it no we

shout of the king will be in the campaign there will be a church with jesus walking in it we have to dig or die oh give the lord some praise people oh glory to god this is what was given to me to

and i talked sometimes about this man that was going to bury a man one time and they heard some enemy coming at a trolling man in the grave of elijah they just dumped him inside of there and when that body hit that air he tried to quickly power you talk about power the equipment power started that dead man that man was no baptized believer he was no message church believer he was just a dead man

excited i don't know but just see what god put up on mine amen thank you jesus listen to this what if i went to this restaurant and he saw this woman and he was saying lord why don't you destroy this place why are you doing you and he was talking about negative old woman i want to read a pathway part of it but i'm talking behind the door show him a vision of himself his sins his blood coming and and his black spot coming and the blood of jesus bumping it off and so on he nodded to me i could see i'd like you to see him in the picture and the crown on him and blood in his eyes and face he looked at me and looked like tears all mattered his beard beard together i spoke with a vision of jesus he looked at me and and blood stains all over his face and i said did my sins do that to you he nodded his head to me i said god forgive me i wouldn't uh i wouldn't hurt to hurt you like that lord i love it all my heart he took his side patted with his hand he took his finger like this and wrote on my old duty book pardoned i took it and threw it behind him like this in the sea of forgetfulness and laid out the new book i said lord i thank you i'll never try to do anything wrong with you he said no he says he's speaking this is jesus speaking there now i freely forgive you i freely forgive you and then you want to destroy her now this was a woman that ran him is casting judgment on he doesn't know he doesn't know a story he does know nothing about him this is just eyes and the environment that he is looking at amen and this how the vision speaks interpreting how brother branham was sienna he said no watch i freely forgive you and you want to destroy her and by that time the door had come back and i was looking right at the woman sitting there i wanted to destroy her musician come on please and uh i was i want to destroy after i was free forgive him i just pulled the door back together where i've been moving my arms while the vision was on i pulled the door back and i said father forgive me i'll go right to her and i apologize you could play something you could play something i stepped out the door one of those old drunk men seen me there with her say you think the rain will hurt the robot they got up excuse themselves and walk out to the rest of the room i kind of stroll over that way and this policeman still playing the slot machine i walk over kind where she was at i said how do you do the pole thing look up and said oh hello i said could i sit down she said thank you i have company. i said i didn't mean it like that i just want to say a word to you i want to ask you to forgive me and she said what did i what did you ever do to me i said wait just wait a minute let me tell you she said yes and i i said i stood at the door and i told her the story i said right back behind there he showed me i was wrong she looked up she looked like it's so but her she looked up she said are you brother brown i said i am she said you are that minister down there she said yes ma'am i'm ashamed for you to see me like this i said will you forgive me she says certainly she said sit now i said thank you i sat down with a little boot with her and she said i want to tell you something but abraham she said i passed by and seen your meetings i seen it advertised and i went in i'm simply ashamed of myself she said what would you believe if i told you my father was a methodist minister i got two daughters both of them are sun school teachers i said what happened she told me about a letter from her husband he run off with another woman she started drinking started off she said i know i'm past redemption strictly a legalist you see i'm past redemption i said no you're not no you're not she started crying she said brother branham you think i'm not past redemption

everybody in there was she was crying and praying she got up went out to go home to a new life listen to this god showed me that my own heart wasn't right i want to say that again god showed me that my own heart wasn't right because i was trying to condemn her i'm not looking at what i come from too so we can always remember look back to the pit where we was healed from amen things will look a lot different we don't want to condemn no one love everybody whenever you lose that genuine love that's in your heart you have lost everything don't forget that when you lose love it's all gone remember that the love this little brother had all for you you'll remember the love of the brethren i am not saying listen i am not saying all your organization break up and make one organization i'll never it will never be that way you will never do it just go through life just the same old bangling and fostering and doing that's wrong keep your organization stay in there if you can that's all right but reach out and arm and love everybody else and have respect give him a little blanket too because he wants to get covered also it stretched far enough for all of us room there is plenty of room there is room for all of us there's a fountain for me there's a family for all of us remember that amen if i could see our clothes this is the final quote if i could see every pentecostal church
