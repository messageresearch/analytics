you what happened I just wondered a long time ago it was not wrong for a woman to put on a garment that pertains to a man G the Bible said it's an abomination in the sight of God hallu you Methodist I want to fire one at you when John Smith preached his last sermon a short one 4 hours so old he packed him to the platform and he said oh I don't know what's going to happen even the daughters of the Methodist Church are wearing rings on their fingers what about now with a bathing suit on stretched out on a beach before a bunch of man that's you Methodist all right you Baptist a little prayer one time now and then and John Smith the founder of the Baptist Church prayed until his eyes would swell shut and his wife would have to lead him to the table of the morning to feed him his breakfast shame when you Baptist and you methodists that don't believe in Divine Healing when John Smith I stood to this Shrine not unle one day he was riding his horse and it fell and broke its leg and he got off the horse and he took a bottle of oil from his pocket and Anointed The Horse and rode away on it you preach that in the Methodist Church and they'll throw you out the door oh you did run well what hindered you standing out Longo to a great Presbyterian man who was sitting by my side in some cult in California he said what do you think of that he didn't know me I said that's all right he said you know one time the Presbyterian Church was a Dominic Church on the west coast he said but then income the Christian Science and just tore it to pieces and now here come this man is tearing the Christian Science to pieces I I said then if you would have given the children the bread of life they wouldn't know when after such stuff as that but hungry children will eat from a garbage can the world's hungry today for the word of the Living God oh you people what you need you pastors is feed your sheep right with the word of the Living God then he kept bringing word oh how your children does this how he must feel imagine you being a teacher and have to go to the very M maker and report on his own child the discipline but now what if the child was a good job what if the child was just about the father's business that how gracious the tutor was he'd come and say oh kind sir your child is just a chip off the old block he's just like you he's just about your business oh you'll never find a better businessman for your kingdom here than that child how the father must sweat out oh that's my boy oh yes he's my son how that the holy spirit standing in the presence of God and says this man he is a real son he's about your business how do we say we about his business this is his program preach the word I'll be lifted up I'll draw a man to me how that he must feel great and feel happy then you know what happened if that son never did be behave itself it never was no more than just an outcast boy that's right I you know I'm a still a little bit of calvinist but I I believe if you're born a child of God you could be a disobedient child and you will Rel lose all your reward and you'll never be no more than just an ordinary Baptist Pentecostal Nazarene or whatever you are but if you be up and doing if you be all obedient and a real child now the Lutheran when you first found out the just shall live by faith you made a Doctrine out of it that's right and you Methodist as soon as John Wesley come along the pillar fire as it moved they built under him and when John Wesley come along you discovered the new birth or what they call sanctification the second definite work of Grace that was all right so was justification right but as soon as you not sanctification you draw a little line all your leaders did after the death of Wesley and as very and so forth and then you made a Doctrine out of it and you draw a border line God just moved the pillar fire right out the Pentecostal founding the restoration of the gifts they begin to speak in tongues you made a Doctrine out of it and you put your period down now the holy spirit's moving right on off and leaving you that's right oh brother when you isolate at yourself from the rest of the Believers God will move away you've got to love one another this will all men know that you are my disciples when you had love one for the other when the Methodist and the Baptist and the Lutheran and the Pentecostal can stand arm in arm and March forward you'll see one of the mest outpourings of the spirit of God that you ever seen the devil don't care as long as we're shooting at one another oh go ahead you just fight kill yourselves but let us unite in one big front watch what happens then watch what goes on now if this boy was a correct boy and he was obedient and he was industrious and he he liked to do the things the father had left for him to do then the tutor come and said oh he's a great boy then on a certain day when the boy become of age which the church ought to been a long time ago this boy was was brought out into a public place and had a road placed on him a beautiful Road and all the round about was called in now listen Clos and closing and all the people was gathered in at the front of the gate usually taken place he went up to the front of the Gate of the city and there he set his boy up on a high place and he put him on a robe and you preachers here I'm talking of the placing of a son you know in the Bible now in Galatians or Ephesians 1:5 for God has predestinated us unto the adoption or the placing of sons by Jesus Christ now he was a son to begin with but now he's so obedient let him be whatever denomination that has nothing to do with it it's obedience to the word obedience to God and then he was placed on this High seat and there was a great celebration and the father adopted his own son that had been in his family all these years had adopted him into his family in other words he had placed him give him his position in the family and then after that the boy's name was just as good on a check as his daddy's was or he was positionally placed now my Pentecostal brethen Baptist Methodist and Presbyterian whatever you are do you see where we're sharp today do you see we are fussing so much about our denomination about our Prestige and about our societies God can't do nothing with us we're children but oh made the day hasten when we can be set out before the public and roed in the power of his righteousness that our words our prayers will heal the sick and our preaching will save the lost and the great signs and wonders of the Bible will be restored back to the church again when we break down our little petty juvenile differences that's when God will do this notice he was positionally placed and then he become a full-fledged son then he name is good then that's the way with the church if we could get away from our little differences and come to Christ and forget about the outside world or forget about our denominations and so forth and be obedient children and be about the father's business to get Soul saved and to do the things of God after a while God will set us to one side and he'll anoint us with the Holy Ghost and then we're positionally placed in his Kingdom some has the gifts of wisdom some has knowledge some has Gifts of tongues some preaches the gospel some are prophets and other gifts but now God is moving the gifts in the church I might as well say it it's on my heart see I don't want to hurt you brother I don't want to hurt you sister but the Pentecostal church and you Full Gospel people these gifts you don't know how to control them there gifts are all right but you're going wild with them put them in their place look the first gift is wisdom what good it go to do you to have knowledge if you don't know have wisdom to know how to control your knowledge what good does it do you to speak with tongues if you don't have wisdom to know when how and to place it right see what I mean what good does it do to preach Divine Healing when it just goes to pieces you don't know what I've said I met two classes of people people in my life and that is the fundamental and the Pentecostal the fundamental positionally knows what they are but they haven't got any faith the word's never took root yet it's never come to life but positionally they know where they are the Pentecostals got the faith but they don't know who they are it's just like a man's got money in a bank don't know how to write a check in the other can ride a check and ain't got no money to B if you could ever get those together oh God give us either a spiritual fundamental church or a fundamental Pentecostal Church youve got lots of faith but you just don't know how to place it it just runs wide that way it brings me a reproach and it does good place it in the Bible this is the blueprint not what people want but what God wants line up with this program that's what's the difference that's why we are not going on the way we should be friends now while they were standing there noticed that when in the presence of God now in the Old Testament God never did ask man to do anything L he' do it himself when man was sentenced to death to Die the only way God could redeem him is come down in flesh and take his place that's the reason I preached the way I did last night Christ is more than a man he's God he had to come down and be clothed in flesh in order of tast in he couldn't send another individual he wouldn't be just in doing so he had to come himself and he overshadowed the Virgin and created a blood sell it brought forth the Sun and God dwelt in the sun Tabernacle here on Earth he was Emmanuel not a prophet but God with with us God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself it's the only way he could test taste sin and death was to be made Marty like man the kinsman redeemer of Ruth that of preached on so much Across the Nation as you probably read the sermons oh he had to be a Kinsman to be a redeemer and the only way that God could ever be a redeemer he had become kful to us and he become flesh and dwells Among Us he's our kin folks he was a flesh man like I am like you are but God dwelt in him to suffer and feel taste his and five senses like we are he become a redeemer then when he was standing there on Mount Transfiguration God was showing to the world what he had asked man to do back there under the adoption replacing of sons Peter got all excited usually men do when they're in the presence of Supernatural usually they can control themselves because they're creatures of the earth and yet they're creatures of Heaven too but that foraste just runs them wild that's what's happened to the Pentecostal Church see that forast you don't know how to control yourself you get all out of reason you don't know how to place those gifts of tongues those interpretations while a preacher speaking sometimes you raise your and speak while a preacher is speaking that's contrary to the Bible and you say oh God gave a message of this it's fresher than the Bible no it's not that your words will fail and everything else will fail but the Bible said if there be any spiritual or Prophet among you let him acknowledge what I write is the Commandments of God and if an angel from heaven would preach any other gospel in that which has been preached let him be a cursed you see what I mean so if you try to shake hands with pre people and get them into into the kingdom of God you're wrong they're borned in the kingdom of God by the Holy Ghost they're not baptized Face Forward backward sprinkled poured in one name or the other they are BN out the spirit of God into the kingdom of God Peter was excited he said Lord let's build three Tabernacles we'll build one for Moses and all wants to keep the law Moses represented the law all that wants to keep the law the Commandments and don't eat meat and so forth let them do that and we'll be one for Elijah and we'll be one for you now Moses represented the law all the laws and no man can be saved by the law the law was a savior the law was a school Master the law was a punishment the law magnified sin and otherwise the law was a jail house that the spirit put you in the jail housee but it couldn't redeem it had nothing in it to redeem by Jesus was a redeemer now Moses represent the law by the law no flesh is saved that's reason he brought the three Witnesses from heaven now Elijah represented the justice of God and my brother would you dare to say that you require Justice from God when you're borned in sin shaped in iniquity come to the world speaking lies and you want Justice God said the day you eat thereof that day you die that settles you got Justice You're Gone in law law only brings it before you said here you're under arrest you sinned you transgressed and your your prison is open for you hell itself go into it that's what the law said and the Justice didn't even require a law the word had already been spoken that's all God has to keep his word look at Elijah God's he was God's line of Justice he's setting up on a hill he said if I be a man of God when that captain of 50 comes to let come from Heaven went away went to 50 well the king said perhaps lightning struck them I don't believe in the days of Miracle so maybe it was lightning or something struck them it was just accidental I'll send another 50 that Stern old prophet of Justice stood up there and said if I be a man of God let Fire come from heaven and down come to Fire and consumed another 50 it wasn't an accident then why he was a line of God's justice dare any of you to try to stand the justice of God dare any of you to try to go to Heaven by the law look where we're standing Peter said let's build three Tabernacles look at the darkness we are doomed from the beginning God's justice requires recompense recompense requires a reward the reward is death La magnifies it and throws us under arrest and puts us in the prison what a dark picture for the human race but oh my dear poor decrepit friend turn your head this way there stood Jesus Jesus magnified like the sun back there under the Old Testament he was glorified potentially oh His Garment shine like the sun and a voice from Heaven said this is my beloved Son he ye him so all of our denominations all of our upsets all of our differences doesn't mean a thing Jesus represented God's love God's so loved the world he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should never perish but have a eternal life so it doesn't lay in the Justice it doesn't lay in the law or what you've done it's in the mercy and love of God that Christ came to the Earth and taken your place God himself said now look I'm going to declare this before Heaven no man can be saved with the law it's done I declare that on the earth no man can be saved saved by the law no man can be saved but justice but this is my beloved Son no man can be saved belonging to the Baptist Church no man can be saved belong to the Methodist Church no man can be saved belong to the Pentecostal church but this is my beloved Son in whom I am pleased to dwell in hear ye him why hear ye him he's the only one can save he's the only one can give peace he's the only one can heal the law can't heal neither with the Justice required but the Son of God can save and heal and give peace for he was wounded for our transgressions bruised for our iniquity the testment of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we were healed here ye him if you're a Methodist stay there but hear ye him if you're a Pentecostal stay there but hear ye him whatever it is Wherever You Belong that has nothing to do with it if you're bned against child of God and filled with the Holy Ghost and you're a Roman Catholic hear ye him God will take care of the rest of it you just hear ye him and God will take care of the rest what we need today Brethren and my final remark in closing is this we need a challenger we need someone to display the love of God we need some church some groups of people this valy here needs a group of people every bit of the world needs a group of people to display that real loyalty that God has overshadowed you by the Holy Ghost and give you love Hallelujah let's all stand praise God praise God praise God you appreciate the message this evening thank you Lord

also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he broke it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup when he had SED saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do ye as often as he drink it and rembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup he do show the Lord's death till he comes wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord God's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chastened of the
