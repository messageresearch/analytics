hallelujah let's just bow our heads forward of prayer father we are so humble to be in your presence lord man cannot create this atmosphere it takes the angel of the lord to step into the room the prophet would stand and say he is here and because he is here we could take every spirit under our control for the glory and honor of the living god so father we stand on the authority lord of the resurrected jesus christ and the power you have placed in the church of the living god over sickness over disease over mind battles over sin itself even the devil who is dispatched to resist when we push him back so father we welcome your presence this morning thank you for your blood we thank you for the atonement the fullness of the atonement by which we can have access to every redemptive blessing every promise every promise in the book those we have already accessed and those that we are yet to taste but the bible said taste and see that the lord is good so we are here this morning in your house of praise and connected by means of technology father the taste of the goodness of god lord the psalmist david said i was young and now i'm old but i've never seen the righteous forsaken so we thank you for bringing us this morning we thank you for waking us up this morning we thank you for putting life in our limbs that we can give you praise it's the reason we are born it's our purpose for being here father because you are our worship you are our god you are our king you are our lord you are our ruler may you step out the pages of the bible this morning and may you speak to us from your word lord for this time this space lord of grace we have here this morning may you take me out of the way may you take complete control if there's anyone sick by the time this service is over may they be healed if there's someone searching for you by the time this service is over may they find you there's somebody backslidden by the time the service is over may they be restored someone looking for peace by the time this service is over may they find peace for somebody look into lord hide under your wings may you hide them under your wings lord we know your partner over us is love so father we commit the service into your hands of reading of the word and speaking of the word in the precious name of jesus christ and the church says amen you appreciate the lord this morning thank you so much brother gideon thank you musicians what an anointing what an atmosphere what a presence we appreciate the lord amen certainly when i appreciate but over for the message last weekend oh my and the bible study and the prayer meeting and all that god hasn't been unfalling in this new year so to keep us on time i want to go straight to the word this morning certainly want to welcome and greet all in the precious name of jesus christ and uh i want to take it from the book of genesis this morning for our scripture readings by the grace of god and we want to read in genesis 21 reading from verse 5. genesis 21 verse 5 and abraham was a hundred years old when his son isaac was born unto him and cyril said god had made me to laugh so that all i hear will laugh with me and she said who would have said unto abraham that sarah should have given children suck for i have borne him a son in his old age and the child grew and was weaned and abraham made a great feast the same day that isaac was weaned and sarah saw the son of higa the egyptian which she had borne unto abraham mocking wherefore she said unto abraham cast out this bondwomanhus and her son for the son of this one woman shall not be heir with my son even with isaac and the thing was very grievous to abraham's sight because of his son and god said unto abraham let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad and because of thy bond woman in all that sarah had said unto the hearken under her voice for in isaac shall thy seed be called and reading genesis 22 and verse 7 and genesis 22 is that chapter where god would tell abraham to take his son to be offered up so i just want to read from verse seven and isaac being a shy boy speaking to his father abraham and said my father you said here i am my son and he said behold the fire and the wood but where is the lamb for a burnt offering and abraham said my son god will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering so they went both of them together and they came to the place which god had told him of and abraham built an altar there and laid the wood in order and bound isaac his son and laid him on the altar upon the wood and abraham stretched forth his hand and took the knife to slay his son and the angel of the lord called unto him out of heaven and said abraham abraham and he said here i am and he said lead not thine hand upon the lad neither do thou anything unto him for now i know that thou fearest god seeing thou hast not withheld thy son an only son from me and abraham lifted up his eyes and looked and behold behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns and abraham went and took the ram and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son and abraham called the name of that place jehovah jireh as it is said to this day in the mount of the lord it shall be seen may the lord of the blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated in the presence of the lord this morning it is such a great honor and privilege to be called in such a time as this and to know him brother branham said is to know him is life not just to know his name but to know him you could know the name of somebody and not know the person there are many names of people that i know i know the name elon musk but i don't know him personally anybody with me so we are here to know him because to know him is life to know the risen resurrected lord jesus christ his name his power his attributes his relationship his person and that's why we are here this morning to build on that so i have a title this morning the mystery of redemption through seven redemptive names the mystery of redemption through seven redemptive names and we know the prophet would have spoken this in different messages jehovah jireh and different messages so i just felt led to touch a few things here this morning to encourage a church so this is a faith-building message and don't intend to be too long with you but it's a message to encourage you in such a time as this and we know that god is mysterious and it's he's a mystery and because he is a mystery and because we are like him we are we are also a mystery and a mystery has to be unfolded so this mysterious god had to also be unfolded he is just too powerful for people that have captured him over the ages because he was just too mysterious he is was just too big he was just too powerful he was he is just too much that that it took a lot of time and process to try to capture the magnitude of this god and when man fell it really created the opportunity to unfold attributes of this mysterious god that he could not have revealed before man fell so for god to even unfold all that he was he could not have done it unless a mistake was made i want you to catch that this morning for god to express all that he was it took man falling for god to begin to express more of himself he would have had fellowship with adam in the cool of the evening but there's only so much of him he could have expressed to adam but there were parts of him that adam never had need to access because adam had not fallen but when man fell it opened a key to unlock attributes of god that were previously hidden of god that he could not display attributes he could not share he couldn't share compassion he couldn't share forgiveness he could not share mercy he couldn't pick adam up because adam didn't have need to access that part of god he could access the path of fellowship he could accept the path of leadership he could accept the path of kindness and instruction but only when man fell he had need for a savior he had need for a redeemer he had need to be born into a family anybody would be this morning and this was god's great desire to express himself he didn't like being a mystery it's a great mystery but he wants to be a mystery to certain people but to others not a mystery he's a mystery to the world but his sons and daughters he doesn't want to be a mystery he could be misunderstood by the world but to his sons and daughters he wants to be understood he remains unknown to the world but to his can i get some more volume back on the on the pulpit please hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah an omnipotent omniscient all-powerful god god had to find a way to express this mystery to unfold himself and if you'd only know a part of god then i could guarantee you there's more of him to know do you know him in just one way or do you know him in the fullness of who he is do you know him in the fullness of his power the fullness of his love the fullness of his resurrection hallelujah he is not just here for salvation he is also here for healing he's here to restore your joy do you know him as a restorer do you know him helping your family do you know him picking up the pieces of your life do you know him as the potter do you know oh come on now somebody help me [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh blessed be the name of the lord i invite you this morning to get to know him a little better oh that's how you can love him better every day most people only know him in a little form of who he is but only in this day and this time we get to know him because in this age is when the mystery is now finished more mystery to that elect lady the mystery is finished of who he is his nature his being his attributes and because the mystery of who he is is now known the mystery of who you are is now known that you are not the son of so and so and so and so but your father is the king and that you are a reflection of who you are somewhere else somebody preached back to me you couldn't worship this morning if you don't have representation by predestination you could not receive this word this morning if you were not called predestinated so shake yourself this morning shake yourself this morning do you know who your father is do you know what he's able to do do you know what his power is [Music] [Applause] all the books in the world cannot fully describe him he is just too big he is just too powerful and he could do anything he is sovereign he doesn't want to remain a mystery this mystery is so great he doesn't want to be complicated he doesn't want to be misunderstood he didn't want you to have a degree to understand him he wanted anybody to be to talk to him talk about him talk with him is anybody this morning that's what we came to church for to get connected to him not the church but to be connected to him he may be seated [Music] adam as time progressed and adam went off the scene and each one could come and he would come god is unfolding his great plan of redemption a plan of redemption to restore man a plan of redemption to bring back man into a position of power redemption is not to bring you back to nothing is to bring you back to position of power and authority power and authority over yourself power and authority over the elements power and authority over situations power and authority over challenges things cannot move you the way they used to move you because now you have power and authority over your emotions over your memory over your reasoning over your conscience over your imagination you're not subject to up and down anymore because you are coming into your position redeem back into authority anybody with me this morning and this word we're preaching this morning is not an opinion it's not a recommendation it's not a suggestion this word is power this word is god himself as he speaks to you into your soul you may not understand everything but something in you connects that seed in you that he plays there is knowing that this is the truth i'm bigger than my problem just like god you are bigger than your situation just like god you are able to walk on the foot of the devil put your foot on his neck this morning do you really know him this morning [Applause] to redeem you to bring you back restore your jewelry saw your peace restore your victory restore your worship because you worship there now you could worship here because you were at victory there you could have victory here you are just here a reflection of who you are somewhere else and the devil is mad about it but i'm so glad oh hallelujah i love don't you love the lord that your name is written in the book and even when your words deceive you peter got a revelation peter's name was on the book but when jesus died peter's own words received him he said i don't know the man this is the only man who set out the christ so we knew that he knew but under the pressure we realized he didn't know him as much as he needed to know him there was more to know he knew who he was but he didn't know him so intimately to be able to stand the test and that peter said i don't know him i don't know him i wasn't there he denied him three times but god didn't even hold that against him because he was known before the foundation of the world and god could express mercy to him that's why he said god fine and go tell my disciples and the peter peter is the only one who called separately because you know peter found himself in a deep hole of depression peter didn't feel good when he denied him you know peter didn't feel good when he made a mistake but like any true lamb any true sheep when you fall you bleed you cry your boy your tears run down your face because you know that's not your state it's not your position and when jesus say call my disciples and tell peter to come also oh that was the encouragement that peter needs so i tell you this morning if you don't know him in the powers of his resurrection if you don't know him in the power of his mercy if you don't know him in the power of his grace may you come to know him this morning [Applause] so let's go so this mysterious god is unfolding himself in shadows in pieces as he is known to them people can express due to the limited understanding of the experience can the church say amen so the first encounter we have of of one of the compound names but ibrahim said is that name jehovah jaira it's the first of the seven compound redemptive names we find in scripture because god would go to abraham and we know god would call abraham and god will give imam promises and the reason i read genesis 21 is because in genesis 21 god told abraham that thy name thy seed thy power your generation all of this will be true your son isaac for in isaac shall thy seed be called but yet the very next chapter god telling him go and offer up this son that could confuse anybody because if you just told me through my son isaac my seed is gonna call and be called and come to that seed and the next time he said go kill him it takes a great fate it takes more faith in the face of what god said to now deal with a test in the face of what god said so abraham's faith had to be really great by the eclipse because god just told you this son through their son watch this boy he's not like anybody else through this boy your seed is going to come and yet still god is gonna say it offer him up to die can the church say amen and you know i said before god speaks on many different levels so he said true you see your name call and and offer up your son and and god is speaking to abraham but he's also speaking with the sun the royal seed of abraham who had to be anybody with me who would also be offered up [Applause] so check abraham with a positive fate in genesis 22. now the heat is turned up on abraham and he is now dealing with his own thoughts to this point for three days of the journey he is dealing with his thoughts because we all go through our periods where we're trying to reason and figure things out even god said come let's reason together but sometimes there's nobody to reason with but yourself and for three days god takes abraham on a journey for three days three days to give him the opportunity to turn back three days to really think is this what i want to do this maybe it's not what i signed up for but nothing is moving abraham he had waited 25 years god gave him a promise and i can imagine by the time abraham got there he said listen he's telling himself i guess imagine if god told me that this seed has to come to this boy even if i kill him god i have to raise his back up again i don't know how it's going to happen but god can't lie [Applause] i want to obey his word let god figure out the rest oh somebody help me because my god cannot lie if he said his seed is coming through this boy nothing will stop the seed coming to this boy so i may not be seeing all i should be seeing but i'm walking in faith and when i was reading that scripture last night i wrote down a new perspective because it takes a new perspective because if you don't have a new perspective on situations you could get bow down and depression and say but lord i waited 25 years you tell me this is the one this seed will come how you go tell me to kill him but that wasn't abraham and when his son said listen daddy i see the fire i see the wood where is the lamb for a burnt offering the young man is spiritual he know your car sacrificed nothing you are looking at everything else but illam and abraham in fate says my son god will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering and when they came to the place abraham take his son and put him on the altar he tie him down on the altar and god is watching this and i'm trying to think even of god because this is a shadow of what to come god is watching abraham and abraham's son and not to just think about the magnitude of this because many years later what was already done in glory will be done on earth with god watching his own son tied to the cross so there's a lot of things happening there in parallel and goku said abraham abraham stop i know you love me i know you're willing to take the sacrifice to to to to be in order with me and when i was over and abraham saw that ram that should not have been there it wasn't raised there he said god has provided and abraham called that place listen god didn't call the police abraham when he saw that manifestation he had to find a way to describe this god [Music] he had to find his own way come on now somebody preach back to me you know this stuff but i want to do how do you describe your god so when abraham went to that experience the bible said he called the name of that place god didn't tell him to let this abraham by revelation looked at the situation looked at his journey taught about what he went through and he called that place jehovah jairo god is a provider not just a provider but he's a provider of the sacrifice oh hallelujah do you realize you didn't have to provide no sacrifice for your oh come on now god prepared for himself a sacrifice for you and i oh hallelujah he is till jehovah chirag he is still a provider listen not just a provider of a food and a table unknown but he has provided a sacrifice so it's more than provision and he is still jehovah's ira he is still a provider what do you have need of this morning do you know you get provided do you know he is is he your provider do you know him i said hover chiro this morning do you know him as your provider do you take it what you need to him until you make a way because abraham couldn't see no way he was trusting god and god placed around there that he could prove oh come on now somebody help me this morning do you know him as jehovah chyra and abraham if you would meet abraham he could testify by the terrance of god as a provider that was his experience that's why it's so important you have an experience what is god to you what has he done for you what has he done to you could you speak first person about who he is to you by virtue of your experience with him can you identify the moment in your life when god did something for you so you could say he is my you need to put the word my in front of it he is my provider oh hallelujah i could tell you when i couldn't pay any bills but he provided i can't explain it i don't understand it but i could just look and know that he is my provider i don't know about you but as for me he is my provider jehovah jireh and what was god doing he was unfolding a process of redemption that was present tense redemption to abraham hallelujah hallelujah and for years everybody could talk about you know he's a provider you know he's jehovah tyra it's only so much but a punch at that time they had ways or words to describe him because the descriptions of him would come over time we deliberately with the foundation here now so when he say who is god he's a provider who do you worship i pro i worship the provider we call him jehovah tyra are you a believer are you really what inspiration are you in i mean he's praise of jehovah tyra he's a provider that's what they had to work with they had no other way to describe him abraham was seeking a city who was building middles it was god and as far as he knew he was jehovah tyra but we know now that god is more than a provider that's just one aspect of his nature one aspect of his character one aspect of what he could do can the church say amen but as time progressed abraham and his seed would begin to move on and abraham and isaac and jacob and they would end up in egypt and they would come in and spend all that time in egypt all these years they could just call on the provider you know it was in exodus 15 in verse 26. or sorry verse 23 this is when they come out now of egypt brother papua and when they came to mara they could not drink of the waters of mara for they were bitter therefore the name of it was called mara and the people murmured against moses saying what shall we drink and he cried unto the lord and the lord showed him a tree which when he cast into the waters the waters were made sweet there he made for them a statute and an ordinance and there he proved them and said if thou wilt diligently hacken to the voice of the lord thy god and will do that which is right in his sight and will give ear to his commandment and keep all his statutes up i will put none of these diseases upon thee which i have brought upon the egyptians for i am the lord that healed thee oh at that point they were not just calling him jehovah jireh i am the lord that healeth thee is jehovah rapha he was more than jesus chiro and at that point anybody who was a believer brother ekith could say he is jehovah jairo and he is jehovah rapha he is providing for me and he is healing for me do you know him as your healer do you have faith that he can provide for you do you have faith that he could heal you and that was as much as they knew they could walk with faith and confidence he is jehovah jireh he is my provider he is your over rapha is the god that heal it have you been healed do you need healing do you know him as jehovah rapha i know brother so-and-so knows him i know sister someone so knows him but do you know him [Applause] the lord our healer hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah anybody with me this morning oh jehovah jireh is not enough to call him he is more than jesus i'm trying to find ways to describe this god i'm trying to find ways i then do you know him this morning people no church but they don't know him they call him jehovah rapha and then as time progresses exodus 17 we find out that and and god was so upset he said i remember when amalek came against you the children of israel were not an army they were slaves in egypt they had no weapons of war and when they were in their weakest moment amalek pounced upon them and in exodus 17 verse 8 then came amalek and fought with israel in referendum and moses said unto joshua choose out men and go out fight with amalek tomorrow i will stand on top of the hill with the rod of god in my hand so just what did as moses had said to him and fought with amalek and moses iran and who went up on the top of the hill and it came to pass when moses held up his hand that israel revealed and when he let down his hand amalek revealed where's your hand this morning where where's where's where's your banner this morning whose side are you on this morning but moses hands were heavy and they took a stone like that and put it under him in other words do what you have to do to keep your praises up do whatever you have to do to keep your worship up they put a stone they say listen once his hand is up we recognize you winning the battle if his hand fall we losing the battle bring a stone and they put it under him and he sat there on and aaron and her stayed up his hands so aaron and her hole in moses hand oh is there anybody this morning you need somebody to help you hold your hand up but i want to tell you don't give up because the battle is the lord's and if we lift him up he is fighting our battles and aaron and her steering up his hands i want you to understand where these redemptive names came from right the one on one side and the other on the other side and his hands were steady you see why you can't fight this battle alone you see why your family is important i'm not talking about your natural blood family you know i'm talking about this blood family you need your brothers and your sisters because sometimes they get tired and somebody got to help you hold your hand up once he got the help he needed the bible says and his hands were steady until the going down of the sun and joshua discomforted amalek you know what discomfort mean he messed them up he made him uncomfortable he put them out the place he sent them back where they come from he said you picked the wrong day you underestimated this army we're looking like farmers but don't end the underestimated look because you see the hand that's lifted up you see that banner that's raised declaring we serve a living resurrected god the planet has raised up this flag flying that we are children of the most high [Applause] and joshua discomforted amalek and his people with the edge of the sword and the lord said unto moses write this for a memorial this was so important god said write it for a memorial in a book and rehearse it in the ears of joshua [Applause] in other words make sure joshua knows this make sure you and joshua practice this thing i want joshua because i have a word for joshua so rehearse it with him for i will utterly put out the remembrance of amalek from under heaven god said for this thing i will wipe them out wipe them out they have no right to pick a fight against my children when i was bringing them out of bondage they did not deliver themselves i brought them out and the devil was wrong with him try to attack you on your way out i will wipe out that devil that trying to stop you from getting to your inheritance rehearse it with joshua rehearse it with him remind him of this day and what his day means for us and listen and moses built an altar and called the name of it jehovah nisi so god didn't tell him to call it this when oh hallel when moses went through that his own personal experience his personal journey he can look at it and say god is jehovah nisi the lord is our panna the lord is our refuge the lord is our hiding place and if we lift this banner above us this morning oh no demon no weapon no power no principality can come against you can the church give the lord a shout of praise [Music] i told this is a field building message you know to remind you of what you know already but if you don't know him as jehovah jireh you need to know him if you don't know him as jehovah rapha you need to know him if you don't know him as jehovah nisi as your banner you need to know him because he needs to be this and more to you not to the church to you he is my banner he is my refuge so up until this time a believer better pop well could begin to describe god in more ways than abraham could all abraham could refer to him as a jehovah torah but now somebody who is under the inspiration as it were could say he's jehovah rapha he's jehovah jireh he's your over nissi can the church say amen and god is unfolding this plan of redemption what is he doing revealing attributes of himself to them by experience so that they could testify it's not a letter it's not a document it's not just a word thing this thing is real we remember when this happened and god did this and because he did that he is this [Music] [Applause] [Music] so the children of israel now out they're now living by a revelation of these three compound names their understanding of god is now better than it was before god's objective is being met of revealing himself hallelujah by experience he is revealing himself he know him better every day god is unfolding a better revelation is unfolding he's unfolding between that time time passes and now god is under the age of the judges hallelujah and we actually did a bible study on this when we looked at what was happening in george's chapter six and the children of israel did evil in the sight of the lord and the lord delivered them to the hand of media for seven years and the hand of media prevailed against israel and because of the medianites the children of israel made them dens in the mountains to hide he was over gyro to them he was over our fathered him he was over nishi to them but they now had a different problem that requires something else hallelujah [Applause] verse 7 i'm going to escape when i came to pass when the children of israel cried unto the lord because of the media knights you see there's a formula here just like the children of israel in egypt when they cried unto the lord he remembered when they cried unto the lord they heard his breath you wouldn't come to church and there was a crying to the lord [Applause] so there was a conditionality tied to what was happening next when they cried unto the lord that the lord sent a prophet you see how god does it when you cry he sends what a prophet one man singular not a group he says one man [Music] don't we thank god that he sent a prophet because there was a cry a sign and a crying for the abomination in the city set a prophet unto unto the children of israel which said unto them thus saith the lord god of israel i brought you out from egypt and that's what we're doing here when these prophets came they brought back the history to show them the journey god took you through to anchor their feet on what was done already that's why it's so important you not forget where you come from because even though you dip and have your struggles you can look back to when you were just all there in the world and you had no anchor no hope even if you backslide you still know you have a hope because before you met god he didn't know you had a hope [Applause] thus here the lord god of israel i brought you up from egypt and brought you forth out of the house of bondage i delivered you out of the hand of the egyptians and out of the hand of all that oppressed you and drave them out from before you and gave you their land and i said unto you i am the law listen no part of that has to do with you none of that is you he said i i i and he could say he said i am the lord your god fear not the gods of the amorites in whose lands you dwell but you have not obeyed my voice so you say don't fear you just have to make things right don't fear the gods out there don't fear these situations out there don't fear the challenges and your passions out there but you also have something to do you have not obeyed my voice if you come back into obedience if you come back home if you come back into the presence of god [Applause] and we'll skip down and we know this event god would send an angel to visit gideon and i will skip but when kirian perceived that who was talking with him was an angel this is judges 6 22 and when gideon perceived that he was an angel of the lord gideon said alas o lord god for because i have seen an angel of the lord face to face meaning it was understood if you see an angel you die that was the conception at the time and the lord said unto him peace be unto thee fear not thou shalt not die then gideon built an altar there unto the lord and he called it jehovah shalom unto this day unto this day it is yet an offer of the abuser right so until this day the jehovah's shalom gideon that name came from gideon jehovah shalom the lord is our peace because they were there but they needed peace god didn't call it him this is when gideon went through that experience he said this is more than jehovah this is more than jehovah wrapper this is more than jehovah and messi because i know about all these things i heard it from says abraham but what did you experience in the presence of an angel this is something different i never felt this way before i never experienced this before i need to find a way to describe what this is and he built an altar [Applause] and he called it jehovah shalom the lord is our peace because god came to gideon when he needed peace he came to gideon when he was troubled in his heart asking if god before us where are all the miracles asking if where is the lord god who took us out of egypt [Applause] but when he met an angel he knew it out of a shadow of a doubt that he was still the god of peace hallelujah anybody with me this morning i'm not going to be too long with you i'm almost done and gideon gave him that name and god accepted it so anybody who was around gideon could now identify his jehovah tyra he is jehovah rapha he is your hope oh come on now he's your overnisi he is your over shalom [Applause] and they would they would be able to live and feed and eat on that for many years until there was a man on the earth who god could see a man after my own heart and this man he knew he was a provider because whenever he was at a situation that needed provided god had provided when he needed healing he had it he needed peace he said many are they increase around me that troubled me many i didn't say of my soul he could have identified with all these things but when he had his own experience with god he said he is more than jehovah tyra he is more than jehovah rapha he is more than jehovah messi he is more than the over shalom the lord is my shepherd he is jehovah he is my shepherd i shall not want i shall not want he making me to lie down in green pastures he leaded me beside us till waters up he restored my soul he lead me in the path of righteousness for his name's sake yeah do i walk to the valley of the shadow of death i will fear no evil for what with me this shepherd who has a rod and i stop they comfort me that's what the shepherd does [Applause] [Music] hallelujah do you know him as your shepherd do you know him as your pastor because that's what a shepherd is he is a great pastor he is the great shepherd he is the protector of the sheep he is watching over his sheep this morning it doesn't matter where they are this morning [Applause] [Music] [Applause] dog prepares a table before me in the presence of my enemies don't know it is my head with oil my cup run it over surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and i will dwell in the house of the lord forever but as powerful as that was in the life of david and those who went before jehovah jaira jehovah rapha jehovah nisi jehovah shalom jehovah jehovah there was still more of god that he wanted to unveil and god does a true experience he does the jewish word he does the jewish promises we made the great prophet jeremiah in jeremiah 23 he's now beginning to speak now because bear in mind now all of these compound seven redemptive names is what will be wrapped up in jesus this is all the god putting the pieces in place because there's nothing new under the sun so god is just putting a piece here and a piece here so when he's ready to combine the pieces it's already in place everybody with me this morning jeremiah will say behold the days come see the lord that i will raise unto david a righteous branch a righteous branch this branch is righteous who grow from this branch will be righteous and a king shall reign and prosper and shall execute judgment and justice in the earth in his days judah shall be saved and israel shall dwell safely and this is his name whereby he shall be called so this one god is revealing this one the lord our righteousness jehovah said canoe hallelujah and under jeremiah they now understood that the lord is our righteousness because of his righteousness we could get oh come on now you don't hear me because we're born and sin because of his righteousness because he is holy he is righteous he is purity he cannot sin but his righteousness could make a way for you this morning his righteousness could clear a path [Music] [Applause] so from that time on anybody who was trying to understand this thing but a papa and they all knew this was pieces this is gordon in different ways expressing himself in different ways and the last one you find in ezekiel and in ezekiel 14 is where they talk about dividing up all the land and who supposed to get what land and which tribe getting one piece of property and all that kind of stuff but by the time you read the end of ezekiel 40 35 and it was roundabout talking about the whole land the whole protected area it was around about 18 000 measures and the name of that of the city from that day shall be the lord is there so that's the name of the lord is there jehovah the lord is prayer the lord is present he's a present help in time of trouble oh hallelujah hallelujah do you know him as jehovah sharma oh hallelujah i'm almost finished anybody feeling good this morning [Applause] and we know it and but if adam taught this clearly that these seven compound redemptive names was all expressed through the lord jesus christ because he was the mystery that was being unfolded all along revealed so if you only know him in one attribute or one fold or one perspective then to know him you need to know him and all of these things you know you need to either testify yourself he is your jairo to me he is your referred to me because i said how could they have faith would you rapture if you could have not fit for divine healing so you have to know him as a healer when in the middle of your trouble you have to know him as jehovah jairo being present hallelujah when you feel you can't enter into the house of god you have to remember jehovah you know he is your righteousness because of his righteousness he can make a way to access excessive presence here this morning hallelujah so this is really who he is and you know what as brother branham said these names we call it seven compound redemptive names but he said these are already titles because his name is the lord jesus christ he said these titles are just unique titles that could be added to his el shaddai he's a lily of diwali he's a bright and morning star hallelujah and many of you may notice i read this years ago an old preacher many many years ago he asked the question do you know my king anybody who remembers that do you know my king and he said the bible says he's the king of the jews he's the king of israel he's the king of righteousness he's the king of ages he's the king of heaven he's the king of glory he's the king of kings and he's the lord of lords that's my king it's personal david says the heavens declare the glory of god and the former men show it is handiwork no means of measure can define his limitless love no farsi and telescope can bring into visibility the coastline of of his shoreless supply no barriers could hinder him from pouring out his blessings he's enduringly strong he's entirely sincere he's eternally steadfast he is immortally graceful he is imperially powerful he is impartially merciful that's my king he is god's son he is a sinner's savior he's a centerpiece of civilization he stands alone in himself he is august he is unique he is unparalleled he is unprecedented he is supreme he is preeminent he is a loftiest idea in literature he is the highest personality in philosophy he is the supreme problem in higher criticism he is a fundamental doctrine in true theology he is the cardinal necessity of spiritual religion that's my king he is the miracle of the age of he is the superlative of everything good that you could choose to call him do you know what i'm talking about this morning he's the only one able to supply all of our needs simultaneously he supplies strength for the week he's available for the tempted and the tried he sympathizes and he shaves up he guards and he guides him he heals the sick he cleans the lepers he forgives sinners he discharges debtors he delivers the captives he defends the feeble he blesses the young he serves the unfortunate he regards the age he rewards the diligent he beautifies the meek do you know my king do you know jehovah do you know jehovah rapha do you know jehovah nisi do you know jehovah shalom do you know jehovah said no do you know jehovah oh come on now anybody with me my king is the key of knowledge he is the wellspring of wisdom he is the doorway of deliverance he's a pathway of peace he's the roadway of righteousness he's a highway of holiness he's the gateway of glory he is a master of the mighty he's the captain of the conquerors he is the head of the heroes he is a leader of the legislators he's the overseer of the overcomers he's the governor of governors he's the prince of princess he's the king of kings and he's a lord of lords [Music] if we had a thousand tongues it would not be enough to describe my king that's my king his office is manifold his promise is sure his life is much less his goodness is limitless his mercy is everlasting his love never changes his word is enough his grace is sufficient his reign is righteous his york is easy his burden is light i wish i could describe him to you [Applause] i wish i could find words to talk about jesus known him but he is indescribable indescribable incomprehensible he's invincible he is irresistible hallelujah i'm trying to tell you the heaven of heavens cannot contain him let alone a man explain him you can't get him out of your mind you can't get him off of your hands you can't outlive him you can't live without him the pharisees couldn't stop him [Applause] pilate couldn't finally fault with him the witnesses couldn't get their testimonies to agree and herald couldn't kill him deb can't handle him the grave couldn't hold him that's my king [Applause] [Music] i'm getting ready to close out music you could come that's my king he always has been and he always will be he had no predecessor he will have no successor there was nobody before him there'll be nobody after him you can't impeach him and he's not going to resign that's my king [Music] [Applause] give the lord a shout our praise do you know him this morning do you know him this morning i'm closing out musician to play something in the message of seven compound names of jehovah but i said all the old things in the old testament we could just take hours of showing how it all drifted back to jesus christ everything to him and in him lays the fullness of redemption in him lays every redemptive name of jehovah lays right in him all salvation in him all deliverance in him all healing in him all power in him people know the message but they don't know him i invite you this morning get to know him do you want to meet him oh i want to see him look up on his face if i could just touch the hem of his garment if i could just touch him this morning all that was done judy ages now wrapped up in christ a redeemer a kinsman redeemer spirit god who couldn't die took under former flesh to unlock to us our redemptive rights and show us our way back to eden back to fellowship back to communion seven compound redemptive names seven perfect spirits of god seven manifestations of one holy spirit that great white light that's who he is do you know him today [Music] do you want to meet him today in a message fate is a substance our bodies are grown in and we have an inheritance it is only true the redeemer we can get access to the inheritance and we are children now heirs of the kingdom [Music] you say brother branham i don't feel like praising him he said that's the time to make the sacrifice praising him anyhow while we're groaning veiled in this tabernacle of humiliation we have the earnest of our perfect complete redemption back like we was in the beginning when god created adam in the garden of eden we have a foretaste of glory divine by the baptism of the holy ghost the refreshment coming from the presence of god to water the church to make it grow in grace and when we are sick we have redemption jehovah the blessing the attributes of the death of christ divine healing as a force sign to us that someday this mortal will take on immortality so all of these seven compound redemptive names was was a foretaste of what was locked up in jesus now made accessible to us that we could not walk in the power of jehovah gyra on the inside jehovah rapha on the inside jehovah sharma on the inside god is present not just in this building but he's in my heart if you're looking for jehovah jireh he's in my heart if you're looking for jehovah's summer he's in my heart oh hallelujah can you say the same thing do you want to say the same thing i'm closing i don't want to read from this prayer that brother branham's prayed and why it had to be a shepherd lord god great creator who was so willing to come to it in the form of jesus to let man know what god was [Music] and you were the only one who could take the penalty of death no angel no substitute could do it you was the one who placed the penalty and you alone could justly take it away and being spirit you could not die but you were made flesh so you could die and become a lamb that you might take away the sin of your redeemed that you had to redeem them by your own blood oh the story is so great lord it goes over the head of so many to think little jehovah laying in a manger he had to live like a baby little jehovah born in a stable little jehovah playing with children on the street little jehovah the teenager little jehovah the school boy and jehovah the mighty you took all these places and then she over the lamb jew over the prophet and you became all of this that you might suffer the penalty of sin and to give us eternal life forgive us o god we poor unworthy creatures of this world we are humiliated tonight when we read what you have done for us and so little we have done in return how you come in the days of great religious leaders how he was willing to stand and reflect the word of the father how you didn't compromise upon their theories and today it seems like there's no one that wants to stand out and call the words tell the word and not compromise we pray god you forgive us of these things that we have so neglected and give us tonight in our hearts as we give it to you as a manger that we know that every time that crucified christ is accepted there's a new boot there's a newborn sheep they're singing in heaven by the angels over one sinner that repents the angels sing again we pray god that if there be some here tonight that doesn't know you as the real gift of god as a personal savior not just by your mental conception but by a new bird of being born of your spirit may they receive it just now lord with our heads bowed and if there be one lord that's not done this may their hearts receive joy now and find like the shepherds of all in the means of their heart the word the messiah that will be vindicated to them as the holy spirit the great shepherd of the day keep your head bowed keep your eyes closed [Music] is there anybody this morning you wanna show by a raise of hands lord i only knew you intellectually but i want to know you this morning personally lord your
