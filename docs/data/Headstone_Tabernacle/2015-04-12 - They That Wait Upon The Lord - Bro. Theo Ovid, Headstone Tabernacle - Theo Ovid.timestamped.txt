[32:44] believe that so brother Bram and tiar
[32:47] age you were sharing this I Know Thy
[32:49] Works love service Faith thy patience
[32:51] thy works and the last be more than the
[32:53] first I Know Thy works the Son of God
[32:56] said believe me for the work sake he put
[32:58] an emphasis on his own Works while on
[33:00] Earth The Works that he did were
[33:02] ordained of God to inspire faith in him
[33:04] it was a great part of his ministry and
[33:06] the Holy Spirit in Apostle Paul said we
[33:09] are his workmanship created in Christ
[33:11] Jesus and the good works which God had
[33:13] ordained that we should walk in them
[33:15] these Works were to inspire faith in him
[33:19] as they show forth the relationship to
[33:21] him that Paul described as created in
[33:23] him now works will never take the place
[33:26] of faith in God for our salvation but
[33:28] works will show forth our faith already
[33:31] placed in him good works won't save you
[33:34] but even if a man is not saved he ought
[33:37] to do good
[33:39] works and do the best he can what is
[33:42] horrible in the sight of God for men to
[33:44] do evil works and then say that they're
[33:46] doing the will of God that is what the
[33:48] Bishops and popes and hierarchy of Rome
[33:51] were doing they were killing Ming doing
[33:54] all manner of evil in the name of the
[33:56] Lord deliver out lives exactly opposite
[34:00] to what the word teaches in that evil
[34:03] day those True Believers shown like a
[34:05] light in a dark place as they
[34:07] continually did good for they returned
[34:10] curs him with blessing they did Tru to
[34:12] honor God even though they many died for
[34:14] it amen in this verse here we go he
[34:17] commended his children because they were
[34:19] living changed
[34:23] lives I'm not hearing you I want to say
[34:25] Amen right with me with the word now
[34:27] they were
[34:28] living change lives say it change lives
[34:32] change lives say it again change lives
[34:34] change lives that is what they will live
[34:36] and change lives okay watch their Works
[34:41] testify to a new spirit within them men
[34:44] saw their good works not hear their good
[34:48] talks but they saw their good works and
[34:51] glorify
[34:53] God are you with me no now we want to be
[34:56] that kind of people
[34:58] Hallelujah all right if you are
[35:01] Christian you are going to do what is
[35:04] right your Works will show what your
[35:07] heart is Right amen and it won't be
[35:10] something you put on for you will do his
[35:12] will when no one but God sees
[35:16] you that's why you hear me say you are
[35:18] what you are when you're by
[35:20] yourself because you could pretend to
[35:22] this you could act this way you could
[35:24] show this way but when you by yourself
[35:26] that's you
[35:28] in All Your
[35:30] Glory Hallelujah are you with me I know
[35:33] your love and service faith and patience
[35:36] you will note that their love is placed
[35:38] between works and service and that is
[35:40] the right place for it because without
[35:42] love our works are not accepted before
[35:46] God you're working because you're doing
[35:49] work like I asked myself a question if a
[35:51] husband is serving love and a wife or or
[35:54] a wife is serving the husband and she's
[35:55] not serving love how how does she feel
[35:57] she feel like a
[36:02] slave let me say that again if the wife
[36:06] is serving the husband and he's not
[36:07] serving her love she feel like a slave
[36:09] she feel she working in the kitchen
[36:10] working in the home there's no love
[36:11] coming
[36:16] there and if a husband Serv in love and
[36:18] the wife not serving respect he feel
[36:20] like a
[36:22] [Music]
[36:24] nut are you with me oh praise the name
[36:27] of the Lord so without love I am nothing
[36:29] whatever I do would profit me nothing
[36:31] unless it's done in love am now you can
[36:33] see right here that these Believers
[36:35] weren't in that nickan class that did
[36:37] works as a means of Salvation to be add
[36:39] B by men but they did their works out of
[36:42] love of God that were shed abroad in
[36:44] their hearts by the Holy Ghost isn't
[36:46] that right amen now I want to give a
[36:48] warning right here it is concerning the
[36:50] last days that because of abounding
[36:52] iniquity the Bible said the love of many
[36:54] with wax coal so a church on fire is a
[36:59] rare thing yes I'm saying people on fire

[37:04] Believers on fire that's contrary to
[37:06] what the scripture was saying you are
[37:07] breaking the barrier the song barrier
[37:10] because the Bible prophesy the love of
[37:12] many will wax cold they will still go to
[37:14] church but they
[37:15] cold still Shake hand but they cold God
[37:19] bless you but they cold God the love of

[1:01:14] brother Bram I know your service Jesus
[1:01:17] said he that is greatest of all is
[1:01:19] servant to all a wise man commented on
[1:01:22] that saying here's what he said only
[1:01:25] history will prove the truth truth of
[1:01:26] that dictum that man was right all the
[1:01:30] truly great men of history have been
[1:01:33] servants they who demanded to be served
[1:01:36] they who oppress who oppressed they who
[1:01:39] always s to be at the head have gone
[1:01:41] down in
[1:01:45] shame even the very rich are condemned
[1:01:48] by God when they have not use their
[1:01:50] wealth right look into history and you
[1:01:54] would find that truly great were those
[1:01:57] who serve others history can never
[1:01:59] Acclaim those for whom much was done but
[1:02:02] it will forever praise those who did
[1:02:04] much for others and that's why B said
[1:02:07] perfect eternal life is when you could
[1:02:09] live for
[1:02:11] others now let us apply that to
[1:02:13] ourselves even the son of man came not
[1:02:15] to be ministered unto but to minister so
[1:02:18] we have to follow that example see him
[1:02:20] as he bows himself over the feet of the
[1:02:22] Apostles and washes their tired de feat
[1:02:24] he said you know now what I'm doing you
[1:02:27] don't know now what I'm doing but you
[1:02:29] shall know Hereafter amen but what you
[1:02:31] see me doing you ought to also do he
[1:02:34] became a servant in order that God could
[1:02:37] Elevate him to the highest Heights and
[1:02:39] one day in the Judgment of the Saints we
[1:02:41] going to hear him say Well done good and
[1:02:43] faithful servant ENT th into the joy of
[1:02:45] the Lord it is hard to be always a
[1:02:47] servant but those who spend and are
[1:02:50] spent for others will one day be seated
[1:02:52] with him in his throne it will be worth
[1:02:54] it all then let us labor for the master
[1:02:57] from the daal set and Son let us talk of
[1:03:00] all this wonders love and care and when
[1:03:02] all our life is over and our work on
[1:03:03] Earth is done and the role is Called Up
[1:03:05] Yonder I'll be there I know your faith
[1:03:09] now he does not say here as he did to
[1:03:11] the chur and pamus you hold my faith
[1:03:13] he's not talking about his faith now he
[1:03:15] is commending them for their
[1:03:17] faithfulness and as he does he also
[1:03:20] mentioned patience now faithfulness and
[1:03:23] patience go together in fact patience is
[1:03:26] the outcome of faithfulness for in James
[1:03:29] 1:3 the TR of your faith work at
[1:03:31] patience there is absolutely no other
[1:03:34] way to gain patience it has to come by
[1:03:39] the trial of your faith amen Romans 53
[1:03:43] tribulation work at patience hallelujah
[1:03:45] how highly God regards this outworking
[1:03:48] of our patience is seen in James 1:4 but
[1:03:51] let patience have a perfect word that
[1:03:54] you may be perfect and entire
[1:03:56] lacking
[1:03:57] nothing
[1:03:59] amen I read that from
[1:04:05] memory when I took my glass can see
[1:04:13] anything God's will for us here we go
[1:04:16] God's will for us is
[1:04:18] perfection how many believe
[1:04:22] that and that Perfection is
[1:04:25] [Music]
[1:04:26] patience waiting on God and waiting for
[1:04:31] God this is the process of character
[1:04:37] development that is where I get that
[1:04:39] from waiting on God and waiting for God
[1:04:43] this is the process of character
[1:04:46] development so he gave Noah 120 years he
[1:04:50] gave Abraham 25 years he gave Israel 400
[1:04:53] years he gave the exci of my room 10 is
[1:04:56] you have a way of giving time on things
[1:04:58] to test Fai and develop character there
[1:05:01] is no other way for it to be done that's
[1:05:04] why trials must come because character
[1:05:07] is not a gift character is a victory the
[1:05:10] tests have to be given for you to
[1:05:12] overcome could I hear a shout on that
[1:05:15] because this is what the bride is
[1:05:17] for to be flesh of his flesh bone of his
[1:05:21] bone word of his word characterized by
[1:05:24] him other than that you are the same old

[1:18:46] Peter I know but who are you I don't
[1:18:48] know you I recognize the authority in
[1:18:50] those Sons there that's the demons
[1:18:52] talking now I understand the power and
[1:18:54] the Authority because they are
[1:18:56] ambassadors of the throne and
[1:18:57] ambassadors representatives of the
[1:19:00] Kingdom them like hierarchy his kingdom
[1:19:03] people God sent an ambassador isn't that
[1:19:06] right when the government of train sent
[1:19:08] an ambassador to London or ambassador to
[1:19:09] America or wherever they represent the
[1:19:11] country they represent the government
[1:19:14] they represent the authority and when
[1:19:15] God send his men out they ambassad of
[1:19:18] the
[1:19:19] throne as my father sent me so sender
[1:19:23] you as my
[1:19:26] father oh
[1:19:28] Hallelujah
[1:19:30] Glory Glory Hallelujah glory to God so
[1:19:34] therefore Satan is about to experience
[1:19:38] something that he never experienced
[1:19:39] before the manifestation of the sons of
[1:19:43] God when we going coming back to take
[1:19:45] back what he have listen take it back
[1:19:48] you know Adam lost it it slipped out of
[1:19:51] Adam hand the book The Authority eternal
[1:19:54] life in itance slip out Adam hand and
[1:19:57] butam came to bring it back Mighty angel
[1:20:00] came down with the book but the bread of
[1:20:03] life but the shout is not right to bring
[1:20:07] forth the briide here we are feeling on
[1:20:11] the unfailing body word of the son of
[1:20:13] man here we are feeling on the bread of
[1:20:19] life glory to God
[1:20:22] hallelujah seven tunders voices what for
[1:20:26] to gather the bride together to give the
[1:20:27] bride feet to should might help repare
[1:20:30] the bride not the church the church
[1:20:32] could play church but you come here you
[1:20:34] hear what the bride
[1:20:38] needs praise God you have to understand
[1:20:42] how the people feel in times pass amen
[1:20:44] how God looking forward for this bride
[1:20:46] amen that'll make him proud Hallelujah
[1:20:48] and brother says a woman reflects the
[1:20:50] man right his ambition his ideal and so
[1:20:53] on the woman a man choose isn't that
[1:20:56] right so the bride that Christ choose is
[1:20:58] to reflect
[1:21:01] [Music]
[1:21:03] him if the bride do her own thing that's
[1:21:06] problems she is on her
[1:21:09] own all right so God's nature is to warn
[1:21:12] a man before judging him isn't that
[1:21:13] right you always give warning we have a
[1:21:16] responsibility we are responsible and
[1:21:18] God has put us here on the earth okay
[1:21:21] watch for a reason and that reason that
[1:21:24] he has put us therefore we are
[1:21:26] responsible to him for that reason you
[1:21:28] should go to him and find out what he
[1:21:31] wants you to do and if you don't if you
[1:21:32] went to work for a man give you a job on
[1:21:34] a ranch or something you went on to the
[1:21:36] B sit down there well you must go and
[1:21:38] ask him what he wants you to do and then
[1:21:40] if you're working for a man find out
[1:21:42] what your duty is Lord what would you
[1:21:45] have me to do why am I here if it to be
[1:21:47] a housewife this worship whatever God's
[1:21:49] want you to do then you do the very best
[1:21:51] you know how to do it excuse me no
[1:21:55] matter how little it is you must do it
[1:21:58] now listen to this he does not always
[1:22:00] strike when he Wars I want you to watch
[1:22:03] this quotation God gives a warning but
[1:22:06] he doesn't always strike the same time
[1:22:08] he wants did you notice that and then he
[1:22:11] doesn't strike he sends a warning he
[1:22:13] said now watch but that Prophet if he's
[1:22:15] Vindicated is got to come to pass
[1:22:18] there's only one thing can stop it is a
[1:22:20] quick repentance like Abraham God told
[1:22:22] Abraham your si has a J in a Strange
[1:22:24] Land
[1:22:25] and because of iniquity of the amorites
[1:22:27] here we go is not yet full so God knew
[1:22:30] that cup was going to be full he was
[1:22:32] speaking with his prophet he said you
[1:22:34] see that cup of the amorites down there
[1:22:36] their iniquity is not yet filled up so
[1:22:39] God will just judge because things said
[1:22:41] and what not no there's a cup of
[1:22:43] wickedness a cup of evil that God
[1:22:46] looking to get filled up and the filling
[1:22:48] it up they year in year out and when
[1:22:52] that full then God will strike amen the
[1:22:54] iniquity is not yet full so God himself
[1:22:57] have a
[1:22:59] [Applause]
[1:23:01] timing Hallelujah a lot of people feel
[1:23:04] to get away but God have a timing when
[1:23:07] he does his thing isn't that right so
[1:23:11] what's something now talking about David
[1:23:12] trying to do God a service outside his
[1:23:14] being his Will and David now got a
[1:23:17] revelation he claim to bring back the
[1:23:21] house of go the The Ark isn't that right
[1:23:23] but but said he revealed his word only
[1:23:25] in its season Martin Luther read the
[1:23:28] same Bible we did Wesley read the Bible
[1:23:30] we did Pentecost read the same Bible
[1:23:32] Jesus read the same Bible but watch but
[1:23:34] they fail to see the hour so only when
[1:23:37] the time comes the opening of the word
[1:23:40] for the season and time God breaks what
[1:23:43] needs to break amen isn't that right
[1:23:45] that's right so watch God Reveals His
[1:23:47] word in the season and to whom he choose
[1:23:50] to reveal it to God chooses who he
[1:23:52] reveals it to he reveals them as he will
[1:23:55] as his chosen people his chosen people
[1:23:57] so who it is Will dare correct him and
[1:23:59] said now Lord you made a mistake by
[1:24:01] putting this man in the
[1:24:03] ministry who is there to correct God and
[1:24:05] say God you make a mistake by putting to
[1:24:07] over in the
[1:24:08] ministry I to put my name inside of it
[1:24:12] this man doesn't believe like we believe
[1:24:15] who is going to tell God he is wrong in
[1:24:17] it it would be take somebody a little
[1:24:19] more delinquent than I am to tell him
[1:24:23] that
[1:24:25] he knows what he's doing he knows who to
[1:24:27] choose who not to choose what to do when
[1:24:31] to do it no matter how much we think
[1:24:33] that a certain person is qualified to do
[1:24:35] a certain job God know who is qualified
[1:24:38] for the time and the season and so forth
[1:24:42] isn't that right so David got a
[1:24:44] revelation look like a man get a
[1:24:46] revelation a great man like God chosen
[1:24:48] King greatest King fresh Revelation
[1:24:51] freshly anointed and he said but it was
[1:24:54] wrong
[1:24:55] that's a great thing I'll deal with our
[1:24:56] subject trying to do God a service
[1:24:58] without it being God Called to do it so
[1:25:01] David got a revelation but he was not a
[1:25:03] prophet Nathan was the prophet isn't
[1:25:06] that right but the king got the
[1:25:07] Revelation and David never consulted
[1:25:09] Nathan the prophet he consulted his
[1:25:10] theologians the Army his boys his-
[1:25:14] workers his friends his family he
[1:25:16] consulted them is not right so instead
[1:25:18] of asking the source that he should have
[1:25:21] asked he consulted his captains because
[1:25:23] he had become a king and he followed
[1:25:25] that line of thinking his chief captains
[1:25:27] and great man now his intention was good
[1:25:31] his motive was good his objective was
[1:25:33] good to bring a Revival to the city but
[1:25:35] he never consulted the way God told him
[1:25:37] to do it so there's a way that God have
[1:25:39] his things to do so we can't go
[1:25:42] fanatical and cranky about getting this
[1:25:43] done we have to
[1:25:45] wait upon the Lord to catch the way it
[1:25:50] has to be done because God tell Joshua
[1:25:52] we have not been here before amen
[1:25:54] isn't that right and therefore we have
[1:25:56] to walk reverently isn't that right so
[1:25:59] said the bride hasn't Revival us yet
[1:26:00] there's no Revival no manifestation of
[1:26:02] God to stir the bride we are looking for
[1:26:05] it it will take those seven tunders to
[1:26:07] wake her up again he promised it if the
[1:26:09] church will forget the Creeds forget
[1:26:10] their dogas and plead the promise it'll
[1:26:12] become effective to them yes so now
[1:26:14] going back no matter how sincere what
[1:26:17] good motives what good objectives how
[1:26:19] people want those things and see the
[1:26:20] need for it there is a will of God to be
[1:26:23] carried out and no matter how much is
[1:26:25] needed how much everybody agrees it's
[1:26:27] needed how much that is the truth there
[1:26:29] is one thing to find out is it the will
[1:26:31] of God and listen he consulted his
[1:26:34] military forces and not even considered
[1:26:36] their godsent messenger of the
[1:26:38] hour so therefore B was talking about a
[1:26:41] man he's talking about um intellectual
[1:26:44] man a Pentecostal coming from Africa and
[1:26:47] he told them that this ecumenical move
[1:26:48] as a thing of God and all of them is
[1:26:50] coming back even the Catholic church is
[1:26:51] going to come back to it original
[1:26:53] condition all speaking with tongues and
[1:26:55] a man I didn't know sometime you PL a
[1:26:57] Siege you don't know what's going to
[1:26:58] happen Hallelujah but the president the
[1:27:00] Full Gospel businessman as soon as the
[1:27:02] speaker sat down he said I am prone not
[1:27:03] to say things against our speaker but
[1:27:05] that ain't the way but brandham said it
[1:27:07] would happen he said it would lead to
[1:27:09] the mark of the beast he said but
[1:27:11] brandham don't know what he's talking
[1:27:12] about he said well we believe he does
[1:27:15] and Chicago said how many here would
[1:27:17] like for me to come up and give my
[1:27:19] version of it they begin screaming and
[1:27:20] shouting see you are planting seeds you
[1:27:23] don't know what going to happen just
[1:27:25] keep laying out the seed when an hour
[1:27:27] come like Thomas he was a last one to
[1:27:30] see the Lord he said he was a little
[1:27:33] late but when they see the things here
[1:27:36] we go that's
[1:27:37] predicted saying thus say the Lord
[1:27:40] happens then they say give us of your
[1:27:43] oil so right now everybody feeling fine
[1:27:47] because things they begin to break yet
[1:27:49] but when things begin to happen then
[1:27:51] they realize they are
[1:27:56] the oil
[1:27:58] down the oil gone
[1:28:00] down they shorten oil and they come in
[1:28:03] and say give us of your oil now here
[1:28:06] this now from question and answers and
[1:28:08] yeah wise virgin who had oil in your

[1:28:11] signs and wonders watch and watch and
[1:28:13] these five cut out the remnant was taken
[1:28:15] away and the rest of them still virgins
[1:28:17] will not be lost but we go through the
[1:28:19] tribulation period and Jesus said give
[1:28:21] us they say give us your oil we want the
[1:28:23] whole Holy Ghost now my we recognize we
[1:28:27] are not the Holy Ghost and we don't even
[1:28:28] have the Holy Ghost watch now anyone
[1:28:31] knows that the Holy Ghost James 5 for
[1:28:34] all knows it represent the Holy Ghost
[1:28:36] the oil and that's the reason we we
[1:28:38] anoint with oil represent the Holy Ghost
[1:28:40] the all the spirit now hear this part
[1:28:42] they want part I want to get to now
[1:28:44] these had the Holy Ghost and were
[1:28:45] Sanctified these are Sanctified plus the
[1:28:48] Holy Ghost go buy from those who sell to
[1:28:51] you and the listen to this part now hear
[1:28:53] the part and they went to try to pray
[1:28:57] through to receive the Holy Ghost but
[1:28:59] the Gentile dispensation had been
[1:29:03] finished and the P persecution arose
[1:29:06] what does that mean if you want the Holy
[1:29:08] Ghost you begin to pray now you're
[1:29:10] looking to pray for the Holy Ghost now
[1:29:12] Lord fill me pour out the Holy Ghost
[1:29:14] upon my life isn't that right so now you
[1:29:17] without the baptis Holy Spirit you know
[1:29:19] that is the oil if you didn't have the
[1:29:21] oil it did not go in oh Hallelujah so
[1:29:24] when they say give us some of your oil
[1:29:26] the sleeping virgin they realize they
[1:29:28] had all that time to get the oil but
[1:29:31] they didn't do it so when the briding
[1:29:33] was about to come they said give us of
[1:29:35] your oil hallelujah oh blessed be the
[1:29:38] name of the Lord and brother bam said
[1:29:40] there are five must in doing God's
[1:29:42] service correctly David was doing God a
[1:29:45] service he was doing everything he know
[1:29:47] he was doing was right but there's five
[1:29:49] must and I want you to remember this no
[1:29:51] matter how sincere A man may be there
[1:29:53] are five must isn't that right praise
[1:29:57] God it must be his time to do it isn't
[1:30:00] that right amen it must be his time and
[1:30:02] season number two it must be according
[1:30:05] to the word that was
[1:30:08] spoken it can't just be any anything God
[1:30:10] must prophesy and said this is supposed
[1:30:12] to be that's why Jesus told them if you
[1:30:14] had known Moses you was going to know me
[1:30:16] because Moses spoke about me isn't that
[1:30:18] right it must be according to the word
[1:30:20] that is spoken and this third one it
[1:30:22] must be according to the person he
[1:30:24] choose to do it by isn't that right it
[1:30:27] must by the person he choose to give it
[1:30:29] by isn't that right and it must come to
[1:30:31] His prophets and the prophet must be
[1:30:34] Vindicated so therefore we have a
[1:30:36] Vindicated Prophet that spoke Vindicated
[1:30:39] word therefore this got to come to pass
[1:30:42] so if we stay with this Vindicated
[1:30:44] Spirit spoken word how could we
[1:30:48] fail oh hallelujah we're not here to
[1:30:52] bring you some dream we here to bring
[1:30:54] you some men's idea or our own idea we
[1:30:56] here to bring you dust say The Lord Oh
[1:30:59] Glory to God isn't that right listen to
[1:31:02] brother Bram he said now watch he said
[1:31:05] when Judas
[1:31:06] fell they choose mathas to take his
[1:31:09] place and the Holy Spirit

[1:31:15] before it

[1:31:20] choose one to take the Bishop Rick of
[1:31:22] Judas that fell by transgression to
[1:31:24] fulfill scripture so Maas had us to be
[1:31:27] in position even before the Holy Ghost
[1:31:30] fell Oh Glory to God here we go are you
[1:31:33] ready and I believe that all these
[1:31:37] things has a time of
[1:31:41] lingering which is the time of waiting
[1:31:43] we are talking about they that wait upon
[1:31:46] the Lord God all these have a time of
[1:31:49] lingering time of waiting it's waiting
[1:31:51] for the time for the scripture to be
[1:31:54] fulfilled till everything gets right
[1:31:57] everything in order wait
[1:32:01] [Music]
[1:32:02] him so don't get over excited did that
[1:32:05] wait upon the Lord feeding on the word
[1:32:08] of God while you're waiting praying
[1:32:11] while you're waiting preaching while
[1:32:13] you're waiting pressing while you're
[1:32:15] waiting while you're waiting testifying
[1:32:17] while you're waiting you worship him
[1:32:19] while you're waiting you're Shou him but
[1:32:20] you're waiting upon the Lord while
[1:32:22] you're waiting you're doing all that you
[1:32:24] can do because you are waiting on the
[1:32:26] [Applause]
[1:32:29] Lord many times we get impatient like a
[1:32:33] child with great anticipation jump way
[1:32:36] ahead and that hinders the work until
[1:32:39] the work get caught up we must move
[1:32:41] reverently have a purpose in our heart
[1:32:44] in that God if he desire us to do such
[1:32:46] and such but wait till he makes the
[1:32:48] opening and he talk about David wait
[1:32:51] till he hear the rustling the malberry
[1:32:52] tree you must wait to see the hand of
[1:32:54] God going before you hallelujah oh
[1:32:57] praise God so Adam bride could not wait
[1:32:59] God told Adam and Eve multiply and
[1:33:01] replenish the Earth it was an uncoming
[1:33:03] promise she was not his wife yet because
[1:33:05] she had not lived with her the bride of
[1:33:08] Christ is not his wife yet the wedding
[1:33:09] supper is to take place woman engaged to
[1:33:12] a fine young clean man they come
[1:33:14] together and what she he found she's
[1:33:16] pregnant by somebody else then her own
[1:33:18] city has betru that's what Christ found
[1:33:21] couldn't wait and that's what the matter
[1:33:23] with people today they can't wait for
[1:33:26] the real Holy Spirit here we go to take
[1:33:30] the church in
[1:33:31] position they can't wait for the real
[1:33:35] come on now I will I promise you the
[1:33:37] Holy Ghost isn't that right so the real
[1:33:39] Holy Ghost is promised and we waiting
[1:33:41] for the real holy ghost that produces
[1:33:43] real power real forgiveness real
[1:33:47] brotherly kindness not temporary
[1:33:51] kindness the honey disappear
[1:33:56] you have
[1:33:58] a a day pass for
[1:34:02] honey honey

[1:34:07] right behold I send you power Jesus give
[1:34:09] them fell power Judas was there
[1:34:10] everybody have power and they come back
[1:34:12] to you say Lord even the devil subject
[1:34:13] to us J don't Rejoice because of that I
[1:34:16] know you're feeling powerful have no
[1:34:20] character they just empowered because of
[1:34:23] a word
[1:34:24] Jesus put anointing upon them he said
[1:34:26] Rejoice because your name in heaven
[1:34:28] Rejoice because of that don't rejo
[1:34:29] because devil power
[1:34:32] because that that same power on them
[1:34:34] when Peter run you know I'm saying
[1:34:38] then Peter even draw sword you know cut
[1:34:41] off man
[1:34:44] air physical sword he feeling
[1:34:48] fitish Jesus had to take take
[1:34:51] man Jesus had to pick the man and put it
[1:34:54] back
[1:34:56] on you can imagine that Roman soldier
[1:34:59] lost his head by The Sword and Jesus
[1:35:00] pick it up and
[1:35:03] just like like stick it
[1:35:05] back he the man that made the air you
[1:35:07] say stick it back who who who use the
[1:35:10] sword fight by the sword di By The Sword
[1:35:12] just Peter don't don't even put that
[1:35:13] sword thing don't bring that sword thing
[1:35:15] inside of you your natural thing can
[1:35:16] work inside of here it take more than
[1:35:18] that because your emotion say I'll die
[1:35:20] for you but that just work up that just
[1:35:23] woke up the intellect not connecting
[1:35:25] with that at all that's just the
[1:35:27] intellectual thing at work there isn't
[1:35:28] that right but when Peter got the Holy
[1:35:30] Ghost Peter was ready he was ready to
[1:35:33] die for Christ because Paul was resident
[1:35:37] it wasn't temporary PA it was permanent
[1:35:40] power it was so much of power he could
[1:35:42] say silver and gold I don't have what
[1:35:45] God give me I could give and I release
[1:35:48] to you what I have rise up and walk
[1:35:57] Oh Oh Glory are you with me so God want
[1:36:01] to give you something authorize you with
[1:36:04] something isn't that right so they can't
[1:36:07] wait until the real Holy Spirit take the
[1:36:09] church in position they got to
[1:36:10] manufacture something isn't that right
[1:36:13] praise the name of the Lord instead of
[1:36:15] waiting for the real word of God to be
[1:36:18] made manifest to the bride that's the
[1:36:19] kind that makes the word of a true bride
[1:36:22] bringing forth children amen instead of
[1:36:24] Adam coming to her for a bride when the
[1:36:28] time appointed would be just like Christ
[1:36:30] would come to the group Christ would
[1:36:33] have come to his church he promised to
[1:36:34] do it God promised to multiply but it
[1:36:37] had was to wait until God's time but
[1:36:40] they want something big they want
[1:36:42] something amen educated and so
[1:36:44] intellectual he said now the seed that
[1:36:47] she was holding would have finally
[1:36:48] become a mother by the will of God
[1:36:50] through the spoken word spoken about Eve
[1:36:52] isn't that right but she couldn't wait
[1:36:54] isn't that right now as soon as she
[1:36:56] accepted the wisdom with the
[1:37:00] word you
[1:37:02] see and wisdom was contrary to the word
[1:37:05] amen if wisdom is with the word and
[1:37:07] proves to be with the word and the word
[1:37:09] produces Itself by the same thing then
[1:37:11] it is the word but if wisdom is against
[1:37:13] the word and not with the word but
[1:37:15] trying to find something to add to it or
[1:37:17] take from it it's of the devil and the
[1:37:19] Holy Ghost sees of the Bible here we go
[1:37:21] cannot grow in an atmosphere of
[1:37:25] wisdom so that is why the intellectual
[1:37:28] gospel can't cut it in this
[1:37:30] hour Hallelujah the only way it can grow
[1:37:34] is to separate itself from all
[1:37:35] reasonings and believe the word is that
[1:37:38] not right so he give his army his word
[1:37:40] we are not fortified behind denomination
[1:37:42] we not fortified behind groups we are
[1:37:44] fortified by the word of God so God gave
[1:37:48] this time of lingering since brother
[1:37:50] brandham left a time of lingering
[1:37:52] waiting for the cites to be cups to be
[1:37:54] full waiting for seeds to come in how I
[1:37:57] thank God for this season I have loved
[1:37:58] ones out there I sure you have loved
[1:38:00] ones out there but the season is about
[1:38:02] to come because the spirit is about to
[1:38:04] be released it's a time of judgment but
[1:38:07] the Bible in Revelation 2217 said the
[1:38:09] spirit and the bride say come how could
[1:38:11] the bride have a voice without the
[1:38:13] spirit the spirit have to come upon the
[1:38:15] bride to give the bride a voice that the
[1:38:18] bride have the authorities to come
[1:38:20] whosoever will the bride will become the
[1:38:23] fountain
[1:38:24] of Living Water oh Hallelujah she
[1:38:27] herself Mount Zion she will be the
[1:38:30] Fountain of Living Water whosoever will
[1:38:33] come and drink of the Water of Life
[1:38:35] freely because Jesus said he that
[1:38:37] believeth on me as the scripture had
[1:38:40] said out of his belly shall flow rivers
[1:38:43] of Living Water therefore the bride will
[1:38:45] be like that aesan well bringing up
[1:38:48] Fountain of spirit because the seven
[1:38:50] perfect spirits that came out of Elohim
[1:38:52] will be resident in the bride even the
[1:38:54] pillar of fire and there is my spirit
[1:38:57] flowing freely oh hallelujah it's going
[1:39:01] to flow brother it's going to
[1:39:04] flow oh my
[1:39:07] God my God my God my God my God there's
[1:39:15] going to be a fful Ministry with the
[1:39:17] full sejm in the body releasing the
[1:39:21] spirit
[1:39:23] why Peri SP these
[1:39:25] words oh Hallelujah glory to God
[1:39:30] Amen so God put us under waiting when he
[1:39:35] said wait page 304 until them seven
[1:39:39] Thunders after the voices to that group
[1:39:41] we have to wait and they going to slice
[1:39:44] and cut but we're going to wait and they
[1:39:46] that wait upon the Lord showing you
[1:39:48] their strength there's going to be a
[1:39:50] people are going to wait upon God and
[1:39:52] they're going to hear from God and the
[1:39:53] devil would move them they're going to
[1:39:55] be Anointed with power they going be
[1:39:57] Anointed with the spoken word they be
[1:39:59] anointed and they want to speak the word
[1:40:01] they going to flash just like that oh
[1:40:03] glory to God hallelujah oh Hallelujah
[1:40:08] just a few more Hallelujah but the B
[1:40:11] preacher message called the Masterpiece
[1:40:13] we know it talk about Michelangelo talk
[1:40:16] about the vision he had of Moses isn't
[1:40:18] that right he had the vision that's
[1:40:20] right isn't that right nobody else had
[1:40:21] the vision and the challenge was was to
[1:40:24] stick with division for all those years
[1:40:27] because when you're bringing that
[1:40:28] sculpture is not a overnight thing not a
[1:40:30] one we thing is a vision that's in his
[1:40:32] heart and he is hammering away he is
[1:40:35] chopping out what is not Moses is a
[1:40:37] vision of Moses anybody see him chopping
[1:40:39] they don't know what he's busting out
[1:40:41] he's hitting the rock here he's hitting
[1:40:43] the rock here and you who don't
[1:40:45] understand what he's heing out you would
[1:40:47] find just a big bunch of noise a amen
[1:40:49] they don't know what he's seeing but he
[1:40:51] is hitting here he is hitting here in
[1:40:53] his mind he is hewing out Moses and he
[1:40:56] is taking out he is taking out what is
[1:40:59] not Moses what is not acceptable to look
[1:41:02] like Moses he is taking it out he is
[1:41:04] chopping it out he is hewing it out and
[1:41:07] God is about to chop and Hue and cut and
[1:41:09] take out all what is not like him
[1:41:12] because we are going to be just like him
[1:41:14] could somebody say Amen can somebody say
[1:41:17] Amen are you with me oh Hallelujah Glory
[1:41:22] can we give the Lord a shout
[1:41:26] Glory you may be seated any genuine
[1:41:29] sculptor is inspired any genuine poet no
[1:41:32] what watch that
[1:41:34] genuine not people who say poet and and
[1:41:36] they kind write poetry any genuine
[1:41:39] singer some people can't sing they as
[1:41:42] well you read poems any genuine singer
[1:41:44] musician whatever might be all real has
[1:41:48] to come by inspiration and Michelangelo
[1:41:51] must have had the inspiration of what
[1:41:52] Moses like he caught in his mind and so
[1:41:55] forth and watch and I think of many hard
[1:41:58] years of Labor how we had to hold that
[1:42:00] same vision all the time he couldn't
[1:42:02] change a prophetic Vision he couldn't
[1:42:03] come a new vision every Monday morning
[1:42:05] have a new Moses Moses so Moses so Moses
[1:42:08] so Moses so when you when when you that
[1:42:11] Moses it has to have a vision that he
[1:42:14] could work with have a new Moses it's
[1:42:17] Monday morning and next Monday and
[1:42:18] different Moses and new revelation here
[1:42:20] a new revelation here it have to have
[1:42:21] one Revelation this is the reation here
