[16:42] I'm excited about tonight to see what
[16:45] we'll always do in your heart in your
[16:48] life
[16:49] and tonight
[16:50] I have a thought I'd like to share with
[16:52] you and this is from
[16:55] taking some stuff from out of it just do
[16:58] scriptures tonight
[17:00] sharing with you
[17:02] about this early church
[17:04] and this early church after receiving
[17:06] the Holy Ghost they wrote
[17:08] a book of Acts
[17:10] and it has been spoken that if the tree
[17:14] put forth another original Branch it
[17:16] would be another book of Acts we know
[17:19] every seed being fought after this
[17:21] crying baptism Baptist letter discipline
[17:23] Methodist you always testing your
[17:25] witness Every Single Seed will bring
[17:28] forth of these kind but this biblical
[17:30] seed of your original feet of our heart
[17:34] turned back to defeat of the fathers
[17:36] must produce the original kind that he
[17:40] had in the book of Acts and prayer
[17:43] as we are about to do tonight was an
[17:46] integral part of what they did in the
[17:49] book of Acts so I want to read if I have
[17:51] your Bibles with you you could run with
[17:53] me I'll quote the scripture and I know I
[17:56] would share this afterwards with you
[17:58] I'll put this uh the scriptures on this
[17:59] text up and just want that you could
[18:01] look at it again
[18:02] because this is what we're going back to
[18:04] all right acts 1 14.
[18:07] and I want to read from dear this is
[18:10] before
[18:11] acts 1 8 was released Jesus said you
[18:14] shall receive power after the Holy Ghost
[18:17] count on you so the promise to these
[18:20] ordinary folks like you and I was to
[18:23] receive power
[18:24] and this power was to come after the
[18:27] Holy Ghost come not after Stillman not
[18:30] after uh guarding together joining
[18:32] Church something must have called pundit
[18:34] and this is acts 1 all right acts 140.
[18:39] these all
[18:41] continued
[18:43] with one Accord
[18:45] in prayer
[18:46] and supplication
[18:49] with the woman
[18:50] and Mary the mother of Jesus which is
[18:53] better
[18:54] so the entire Bunch was still
[18:57] they all continued with one Accord in
[19:01] prayer
[19:02] and his application with the woman and
[19:04] Mary the mother of Jesus acts 1 23 26 we
[19:09] know Judas he fell off the scene
[19:12] and and from verse 23 they wanted to
[19:15] know who is to replace Judas because
[19:18] before fire fell
[19:20] before the fire would fall the church
[19:23] had to be such an order
[19:25] so rihad was to still have this correct
[19:27] number which was 12 Apostles and Judas
[19:29] was one of them of course he betrayed
[19:31] Christ and then it was down to 11. so
[19:34] they had to stick somebody in there and
[19:37] God reflecting on showing how things
[19:39] have to be in order before this Dynamic
[19:41] power strike the church so acts 1 23 it
[19:45] says and they appointed to Joseph called
[19:48] bathabath was the name Justus and
[19:52] Matthias now here we go verse 24 and
[19:55] they prayed and said Lord so it wasn't a
[19:58] matter of taking a brother and say all
[19:59] right I think you should tell him no
[20:01] they prayed and said look thou Lord
[20:04] which lowers the hearts of all men
[20:08] show whether of these two that was took
[20:11] me
[20:12] that he may take part of this ministry
[20:15] an apostleship from which Judas by
[20:18] transgression fell that he might go to
[20:20] his own place and they gave for their
[20:22] lots and the Lord fell upon Matthias and
[20:24] he was numbered with the 11 apostles
[20:27] let's go to Acts 2.
[20:30] I'm going to read from verse 39 this is
[20:33] after the king of the upper room now
[20:34] remember the power fell down they were
[20:37] all filled with the Holy Ghost they
[20:39] start out like drunk men and Peter began
[20:41] to speak to them and when they asked
[20:42] what shall we do to be safe he said
[20:45] repent every one of you and be baptized
[20:47] in the name of Jesus Christ for the
[20:48] mission of your sins and you shall
[20:50] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost
[20:52] and from verse 39 is what we want to
[20:54] read tonight Peter continued for the
[20:57] promise
[20:58] which is this Holy Ghost is unto you
[21:00] and to your children and all that are
[21:03] files even as many as the Lord Our God
[21:05] child called so if God is calling today
[21:07] this promise is still applicable
[21:09] I mean again for this promise which is
[21:12] the Holy Ghost promise is unto you and
[21:14] your children to them that are far off
[21:16] Gentiles even as many as the Lord of
[21:18] abortion called and with many other
[21:20] words that he testify and exhorts him
[21:24] save yourself from this unto us
[21:25] generation
[21:27] look at verse 20 41. then did gladly
[21:32] receive his word were baptized
[21:34] and the same day they were added unto
[21:37] them about three thousand Souls but this
[21:40] is the verse I want to get to verse 42
[21:42] and they continued
[21:44] steadfastly
[21:46] not in today or tomorrow not one service
[21:49] and then yes here for next three
[21:51] services no they continued steadfastly
[21:54] in the apostles Doctrine one and
[21:59] fellowship two
[22:02] and in Breaking of bread which is
[22:04] communion tree and in prayers
[22:08] so that's why don't we do that again
[22:10] verse 42 and they continued steadfastly
[22:15] in the apostles Doctrine
[22:17] and fellowship in Breaking of bread and
[22:21] in Prince and fear Came Upon every soul
[22:25] and Many Wonders and signs were done by
[22:29] the apostles
[22:30] praise the Lord
[22:31] so this is how God wants us this is what
[22:34] we have to strive onto to be steadfast
[22:37] in the doctrine
[22:39] steadfast in Fellowship
[22:42] that fast in breaking up break communion
[22:45] and steadfast in prayer you shouldn't
[22:48] miss a Friday pregnancy
[22:50] you should always strive to be in it and
[22:53] get God blessing and get God grace
[22:56] and and God's grace remember is
[22:58] Sovereign and God could open up a door
[23:01] for you tonight open up a channel for
[23:02] you tonight by the word and by history
[23:05] let's turn to act three
[23:07] and we want to look at Peter and John
[23:11] and the Bible talk about the Hour of
[23:13] Prayer and look what happened and you
[23:16] know we always talk about none and so on
[23:18] like that but just look what happened
[23:19] prior to that Acts chapter 3 verse 1.
[23:22] now Peter and John
[23:24] went up together into the temple at The
[23:29] Hour of Prayer being the ninth hour
[23:31] so you could see that the atmosphere was
[23:34] one of Prayer
[23:36] this book of Acts was there was
[23:39] interdisting deep into it and a certain
[23:41] man lean from his mother's womb was
[23:43] carried whom they laid daily at the Gate
[23:45] of the temple which is called Beautiful
[23:46] to ask arms so they brought this Layman
[23:49] put him in from the temple where people
[23:50] passed in uh of them that entered in the
[23:53] temple who seen Peter and John about to
[23:57] go into the temple ask an arms and Peter
[24:02] fastened his eyes upon him with John
[24:04] said look on us
[24:06] and he gave heed unto them expect him to
[24:08] receive something of them and Peter said
[24:10] Silver and Gold Have I None but such as
[24:13] I have
[24:14] give ID in the name of Jesus Christ of
[24:18] Nazareth rise upon
[24:21] and he took him by the right hand
[24:24] and lifted him up
[24:26] and immediately his feet and anklebone
[24:30] receives fate and he's leaping up stood
[24:34] and walked and entered with them into
[24:37] the temple walking and leaping and
[24:41] praising God I trust you are feeling the
[24:42] anointing that I am feeling here right
[24:44] now while reading God's word so this is
[24:47] Peter he's going up to pray and he is
[24:51] this is his custom now this is not uh no
[24:53] one again stuff he is regular he is
[24:56] steadfast he's going to pray he all our
[24:59] prayer the quality our prayer line Tower
[25:01] and so on like that and here it is this
[25:03] man was completely delivered
[25:05] acts 4
[25:07] and this is where the Dynamics of this
[25:10] church will be a refilling of the Holy
[25:11] Ghost and Peter given testimony after
[25:14] they get blues and everything else acts
[25:17] 4 we want to take it up from verse 22.
[25:19] so I kind of just leave another old
[25:21] stuff you can go back and read the whole
[25:22] chapter from the very beginning but I'm
[25:24] going to start from verse 22. for the
[25:26] man was about 40 years old this man who
[25:28] was here on whom this miracle of even
[25:29] was showed I'm being let go they went to
[25:33] their own company so after they get the
[25:35] blues because now the power is on
[25:38] demonstration Christ being reproduced
[25:41] they thought Jesus was dead but now this
[25:44] resurrected spirit this Dynamic this
[25:46] power resident
[25:48] permanent part in the lines of these
[25:52] disciples and Dickens and Believers is
[25:56] on display
[25:57] and the devil is mad so the devil
[26:00] anointing the authorities to come down
[26:03] on the Church of this of course we know
[26:06] we repeat
[26:07] when the power and the presence and the
[26:10] signs and wonders and miracles begin to
[26:13] unfold then the devil going to anoint
[26:16] the authorities and and so on to come
[26:19] down on the church the real elect Church
[26:21] by laws and everything else to force and
[26:24] shut us down let's continue
[26:26] and being let go they went to their own
[26:29] company and reported all that the chief
[26:31] priests and Elders had said unto them
[26:33] and when they heard that here we go this
[26:37] is corporate now this is a bunch now
[26:39] they lifted up their voice to God we'd
[26:43] want to call and said Lord
[26:45] God gone
[26:46] which has made heaven and dead
[26:49] and the Sea and all that in them ears
[26:52] who by the mountain by Stephen David has
[26:54] said why did the Hebrew reach and the
[26:57] people imagined vein thing the king of
[27:00] the earth stood up and rulers were
[27:01] gathered together against the Lord and
[27:03] against his Christ forever truth against
[27:06] thy holy Child Jesus whom that was
[27:08] anointed both arid and Pontius Pilate
[27:11] with the Gentiles and the people of
[27:13] Israel were gathered together for to do
[27:15] whatsoever thy hand and I come to
[27:18] determine before to be done
[27:20] and now Lord
[27:22] behold their treatments and Grant unto
[27:25] thy servants with all boldness that they
[27:29] may speak Thy Word by stretching forth
[27:32] dying hand to heal so these brothers
[27:35] wasn't backing up they was asking God to
[27:38] drop on us more signs and wonders power
[27:41] to heal by stretching for the hand to
[27:43] heal and that signs and wonders may be
[27:46] done by the name of thy holy Child Jesus
[27:49] all glory to God my God and the verse
[27:53] verse 31 says and when they had prayed
[27:56] that's the title of what I want to have
[27:58] tonight when they had prayed and when
[28:00] they had prayed and this when they had
[28:02] prayed when you are free tonight when
[28:04] they are prayed the place was shaking
[28:08] where they were simple together and they
[28:11] were all filled with the Holy Ghost and
[28:13] they speak the word of God with boldness
[28:17] now this feeling of the Holy Ghost and
[28:20] acts 4 is a refilling of the Holy Ghost
[28:22] that the god in Acts 2 so Acts 2 they
[28:25] were filled with the Holy Ghost and they
[28:27] come back and get Phil again it's like a
[28:29] second filling we call it a refilling
[28:31] they were refilled but the Holy Ghost
[28:33] and they speak the word of God with
[28:36] pullness or give God Lots on Praises
[28:38] tonight I trust you are blessed by the
[28:40] word just a few more
[28:42] praise God and this is how the birth of
[28:46] deacons what we call deacons in the
[28:48] church and in those days this is Acts
[28:50] chapter six if you want to find it Well
[28:52] one to seven and in those days when the
[28:54] number of the disciples was multiplied
[28:56] with more disciples they arose I'm
[28:59] rumoring on the grecians against the
[29:00] Hebrew we call their widows when
[29:02] neglected in the daily Ministry
[29:04] situations so in other words because of
[29:07] the volume of work because of the volume
[29:09] of people because the volume of needs
[29:11] there were gaps
[29:12] in the administration operation we have
[29:16] got some resources called Help Us those
[29:18] gaps will be filled continue to pray for
[29:20] us
[29:21] verse two then the twelve called the
[29:25] multitude of the disciples under their
[29:26] mindset it is not a reason
[29:28] that we should leave the word of God and
[29:30] serve tables
[29:32] wherefore brethren
[29:33] look ye among you seven men of honest
[29:37] report
[29:38] full of the Holy Ghost
[29:40] and wisdom whom we may appoint over this
[29:44] business
[29:45] but we will give ourselves continually
[29:50] to prayer unto the ministry of the world
[29:55] understand please the whole multitude
[29:57] and they show Stephen A Man full of
[30:00] Faith one and of the Holy Ghost and
[30:03] Philip
[30:04] and procterus and nikano and Timon and
[30:09] palmina and Nicholas apostolite of
[30:12] Antioch
[30:14] whom they set before the apostles who
[30:16] glory to God and when they had prayed
[30:20] they lead the hands on them
[30:24] so it wasn't a matter of telling
[30:26] Brothers do this and do that and do that
[30:28] no
[30:28] the order was they brought him before
[30:31] the apostles and they prayed and then
[30:34] they lay hands upon them that they will
[30:37] be anointed to serve tables to help the
[30:39] widows to whatever needs people have at
[30:42] the difference this is where that was
[30:44] born
[30:44] those seven says and the will of God
[30:47] increased and the number of the
[30:49] disciples multiplied in Jerusalem
[30:51] greatly and a great company of priests
[30:54] were obedient to defeat
[30:57] ask it we want to look at verse 14 to
[31:00] 70. and this is a great one this is a
[31:04] powerful scripture as I said I'm excited
[31:06] tonight because see where we are going I
[31:09] see what God is pointing to you too and
[31:12] how we're going to get there ask it
[31:15] verse 14 to 17.
[31:17] now
[31:19] when the apostles
[31:21] which were at Jerusalem
[31:23] hood that Samaria I received the word of
[31:27] God
[31:28] they sent unto them Peter and John
[31:31] so Samaria got the word why are they
[31:34] sending Peter and John
[31:36] no we have been taught that Peter and
[31:39] John they had the full syndrome
[31:42] a life could only come from the body
[31:46] and they were part of that body and in
[31:49] the body of Jesus Christ and they were
[31:51] carrying life
[31:53] life
[31:55] was coming out their lips the spirit
[31:57] spoken it was God's spirit and then that
[32:00] was speaking and listened to why they
[32:03] sent Peter
[32:04] schools 15 who when they came down
[32:08] prayed for them that they might receive
[32:11] the Holy Ghost now these people have
[32:13] received the word
[32:15] the seed
[32:16] these people had the seed in them in
[32:19] their soul as we would see today they
[32:21] have the seed in his soul and they can't
[32:23] say well obviously
[32:25] some more wood no no no no not yet
[32:29] when they will come down
[32:31] prayed for them that they might receive
[32:34] the Holy Ghost
[32:35] why verse 16 explains why for as yet he
[32:41] who is he the Holy Ghost was Fallen upon
[32:44] none of them
[32:45] only
[32:47] they were baptized in the name of the
[32:49] Lord Jesus so these were believers
[32:52] that received the message of the hour
[32:56] and they were baptized in Jesus name but
[32:59] they had not yet received the Holy Ghost
[33:01] because he was informed upon none of
[33:05] them verse 17 gave the chiote that or
[33:08] the answer to that then laid the hands
[33:11] on them and they received the Holy Ghost
[33:15] they received what the Holy Ghost what
[33:18] did they receive the Holy Ghost Acts 9.
[33:21] and this is Peter now acts 9
[33:25] 36-42 let's continue
[33:28] and we want to jump verse 36 now
[33:31] there was a chopper
[33:33] a certain disciple named Tabitha which
[33:36] by interpretation is called Dorcas
[33:38] this woman was full of good works oh
[33:40] that is great that is very good she was
[33:43] what full of good works and arms Deeds
[33:46] which he did
[33:48] and I came to pass in those days that
[33:50] she was sick and died
[33:52] whom when they had washed they lead her
[33:56] in the upper chain
[33:58] and for as much as Lydia
[34:00] was 90 Chopper
[34:02] and that his father had fear that Peter
[34:04] was dear they sent unto him two men
[34:08] Desiring him that he should not delay to
[34:11] come to them in other words come quickly
[34:13] okay sister has died then Peter arose
[34:17] went with them
[34:18] and when he come they brought him into
[34:21] the upper chamber and all the widows
[34:23] stood by weeping and showing the coats
[34:26] and garments which doctors need while
[34:29] she was with them but Peter glory to God
[34:32] put them all fought
[34:35] and look at his posture
[34:37] look Peter's approach and kneel down and
[34:42] prayed
[34:43] so this thing about kneeling down is
[34:46] part of that posturing before God okay
[34:49] you have an opportunity you could sit
[34:51] and pray stand and pray you could also
[34:53] knead and pray but Peter kneeled on and
[34:56] prayed and turning him to the body said
[35:00] Tabitha arise
[35:02] and she opened her eyes
[35:04] and when she saw Peter she sat up
[35:07] and he gave her his hand
[35:09] lifting her up
[35:10] and when he had called the sins and
[35:13] widows presented her alive oh glory to
[35:16] God that is that had to be some kind of
[35:17] experience and and verse 42 said and it
[35:20] was known throughout all Japan and many
[35:24] believed the Lord
[35:26] praise the Lord could we give the Lord
[35:28] some Praises Right Where You Are Tonight
[35:30] okay
[35:31] ask them familiar one and this is about
[35:36] Cornelius
[35:37] acts 10 verse 1 there was a certain man
[35:39] in switzera at this area called
[35:42] Cornelius a centurion of the band called
[35:44] The Italian
[35:46] so this man is not a Jew
[35:48] the Gentile
[35:50] and those two describes this man a
[35:53] default man
[35:54] who won that fear God with all his house
[35:56] which gives much arms to people and pray
[36:00] to God always I was thinking about this
[36:02] how this man who don't even know the
[36:04] real God praying to God
[36:06] all these
[36:07] verse 29
[36:09] and this is I just skipping right I want
[36:12] to read all about jumping from 2 to 29
[36:14] so Peter was asking him what what what
[36:18] what what made you stand for me and he
[36:20] said full screen I therefore came I unto
[36:22] you without getting seeing because Peter
[36:25] had a vision and we know the story as
[36:27] soon as I was sent four I asked
[36:28] therefore for what intent you have sent
[36:31] me
[36:31] and Cornelius said now this is Cornelius
[36:34] Testament four days ago
[36:37] I was fasting until this hour now this
[36:40] man is not a Jew but he was fasting
[36:43] until this hour at the ninth hour I
[36:46] prayed in my homes and behold a man
[36:50] stood Before Me In Bright closing and
[36:53] said Cornelius
[36:54] thy prayer is heard thine arms
[36:58] are hard and remembered in the sight of
[37:01] God
[37:01] send their footage up call hit us Simon
[37:05] whose surname is Peter he is lodged in a
[37:08] house of one Simon atana by the seaside
[37:11] very specific you can't miss this with
[37:13] God's GPS he tell you exactly where to
[37:16] go
[37:17] who to call UDA fight and when he
[37:20] comment shall speak unto thee now this
[37:22] is an angel addressing Cornelius a angel
[37:25] is the messenger but the angel can't
[37:28] release life the angel can point you to
[37:31] somebody in the body that can release
[37:33] life but it's 33 immediately therefore I
[37:36] sent to thee and thou has well done that
[37:39] thou art come now before are we all here
[37:42] present before God to hear all the
[37:46] things that are commanded of thee of God
[37:49] and Peter opened his mouth and said our
[37:52] truth
[37:53] I perceive that God has no respecter of
[37:57] persons but in every nation he that
[38:00] feared him
[38:01] and look at righteousness is accepted
[38:04] with him
[38:05] so when they begin to testify and preach
[38:08] the word to tell the house of Cornelius
[38:09] and verse 44 said while Peter yet speak
[38:14] these words
[38:15] the Holy Ghost fell the same holy ghost
[38:19] that we talked about just before
[38:21] the same holy ghost that people don't
[38:23] want in this hour now because they
[38:24] figure they are something higher the
[38:26] same only goes that this message came to
[38:28] pointers back to the face of the fathers
[38:30] this same Holy Ghost fell on all them
[38:34] that heard the word and they of the
[38:37] circumcision
[38:38] which believe was punished as many as
[38:41] came with Peter because that on the
[38:43] genitals was also poured out
[38:46] that's the word no poured out the gift
[38:50] of the Holy Ghost
[38:52] Acts 12. you want to read verse from
[38:55] verse 1.
[38:57] I believe this is important tonight so I
[38:59] have to complete this so you have to
[39:01] forgive me but this is tremendously
[39:03] important and I believe that the Lord
[39:05] want this shared with you tonight
[39:07] acts 1 acts 12 rather reading from verse
[39:10] 1 and about that time
[39:14] Herod the king stretched for his hand
[39:16] the back footing of the church
[39:18] and he killed James the brought up John
[39:20] with the sword so here in a bad mood
[39:23] here and some demons upon this guy
[39:25] for Street and because he saw it please
[39:27] the Jews he proceeded further to take
[39:30] Peter also
[39:32] they then were the days of the
[39:35] unleavened bread
[39:36] and when he had apprehended him he put
[39:38] him in prison this is Brother Peter
[39:40] delivered him to four or three
[39:42] quaternions of soldiers to keep it
[39:45] intended after Easter to bring him forth
[39:48] to the people so this dude have his
[39:50] plans
[39:51] verse 5. Peter therefore was kept in
[39:56] prison
[39:57] but here we go church and this is
[39:59] important tonight
[40:00] but prayer was made without season of
[40:05] the Church of God for him
[40:07] no you have often heard that prayer
[40:11] changes things and I want you to know it
[40:13] does individual prayer and corporate
[40:16] prayer the church was informed that
[40:19] Peter was in prison and they had
[40:21] Believers that was bringing without
[40:22] ceases they will continue to praying for
[40:24] Peter
[40:25] verse 6 when Herod would have brought
[40:27] him forth the thing like Peter was
[40:30] sleeping Between Two Soldiers born with
[40:33] teens and the keepers before the dog
[40:35] kept the prison and behold here we go
[40:38] the angel of the Lord came upon him a
[40:41] light shine in the prison he smoked
[40:44] Peter on the side raised him up saying
[40:46] arise quickly and his chains fell off
[40:49] from his hands
[40:50] the angel said good thyself
[40:53] buying on thy standards and so he did
[40:56] and he said unto him cast thy garment
[40:58] upon thee and follow me no
[41:01] it is Barefoot he didn't say come with
[41:04] me would there be a foot and run out
[41:05] with a big Stone you have all kind of
[41:07] stuff there he said buying on your
[41:09] sandals put on your shoes
[41:11] get your garment including one and
[41:12] follow me and he went out
[41:15] followed him and was not if it was true
[41:18] which was done by the Angels he taught
[41:20] he saw a vision
[41:21] and when they were passed the first
[41:24] and the second ward they came onto the
[41:27] Iron Gate that leaded into the city
[41:29] which opened them on his own accord and
[41:32] they went out passed on to one street
[41:34] and fought with the angel departed from
[41:36] him in other words the mission of the
[41:39] Angel was over
[41:40] his commission was to get Peter out
[41:44] when Peter come to himself Peter was in
[41:46] the days Peter almost thought he was a
[41:48] vision he said no I know maturity that
[41:51] the Lord had sent his Angel not all of
[41:54] this is an ebuka act in just coming to
[41:57] the rescue Angels assisting you the
[41:59] ministry of angels okay sent his angel
[42:02] had delivered me out of the hand of
[42:03] Herod and from all the expectation of
[42:06] the people of the Jews and when he had
[42:08] considered the thing he came to the
[42:10] house of Mary the mother of John whose
[42:12] city was Mark where many were gathered
[42:15] together praying go give the Lord some
[42:16] prison many were gathered together pray
[42:19] praying for Hope praying for Peter and
[42:21] as Peter knock on the door adamzel came
[42:23] and happened named Rhoda and when she
[42:26] saw Peter and heard Peter knew Peter's
[42:28] voice she opened up the gates for
[42:29] gladness but ran him and told how Peter
[42:32] stood at the gate so she she got so
[42:34] excited she didn't even open the gate
[42:36] she just said pizza oh dear
[42:38] understand
[42:40] but she constantly affirmed that it was
[42:43] even so
[42:44] then said the it is his Angel oh they
[42:46] see it is the Sea of an e
[42:48] but Peter continue knocking
[42:51] and when that opened the door I saw him
[42:54] they was punished but he
[42:57] beckoning them with him the hand to hold
[43:00] their peace declared unto him or the
[43:03] Lord had brought him out of the prison
[43:04] he said go show these things unto James
[43:07] unto that Brethren and he departed and
[43:09] went another place as soon as it was
[43:11] dead there was no small still among the
[43:14] soldiers what has become of Peter oh
[43:18] praise and he also we're almost done
[43:20] it's 14 23. this is how the elders were
[43:24] ordained one versus 123 and when they
[43:29] had ordained them elders and when they
[43:32] had ordained them Elders in every Church
[43:35] and had prayed with trusted
[43:38] so now
[43:39] there are times when they just pray
[43:41] alone
[43:42] there are times they pray and lay hands
[43:44] and they also prayed with fasting I like
[43:48] to call that Amplified prayer and when
[43:50] they are prayed with fasting they
[43:52] commended them to the Lord these Elders
[43:54] on whom they believed
[43:56] acts 13 1-4 this is how ministers were
[44:00] sent out
[44:01] no
[44:03] they were in the church acts 13 verse
[44:05] one you're going to read it no they were
[44:07] in the church that was at Antioch
[44:09] certain prophets and teachers as
[44:11] Barnabas and Simeon that was called
[44:14] Niger and Lucius of Cyrene and mana and
[44:17] manayan which had been brought up with
[44:20] Herod at the church and so on as they
[44:23] minister to the Lord and fasted
[44:25] the Holy Ghost said
[44:28] separate me panamas and soul
[44:31] for the work we're on to I have called
[44:33] them
[44:34] and when they are fasted and prayed here
[44:36] we have it again
[44:37] laid hands on them and they send them
[44:40] away
[44:41] so they're being sent forth by the Holy
[44:44] Ghost the president
[44:46] and from density still disciples
[44:49] and I believe this is the final reading
[44:51] we have tonight are we getting in prayer
[44:54] and this is acts 16. we want to read
[44:57] verse 20. okay
[45:00] so low they come to complain about Paul
[45:03] Silence Paul
[45:05] acts 16 20 and brought them to the
[45:08] magistrate and said these men being Jews
[45:10] do exceedingly trouble our city and
[45:13] teach Customs which are not lawful for
[45:15] us to receive leaders to observe the
[45:18] enrollments and the multi rules up
[45:20] together against them and the mother
[45:22] Street rent off their clothes and
[45:24] command it to beat them okay this is
[45:26] Believers this is Apostles this is
[45:28] Prophet Paul getting blows okay so if
[45:32] you get Blues they'll say you know I
[45:34] mean the Lord forsake me and I ain't
[45:36] supposed to get that now let's read the
[45:38] scriptures this is acts we're talking
[45:39] about
[45:40] okay watch and the multitude rules up
[45:43] against them and the management rent off
[45:46] their clothes for money to beat them and
[45:48] when they had laid many stripes upon
[45:50] them they cast them into prison leaks
[45:53] past prison
[45:54] there's a powerful combination
[45:57] charging the Jailer to keep them safely
[45:59] who haven't received such a charge trust
[46:02] them in the inner prison and made their
[46:04] feet fast in the stocks so their feet
[46:07] was iron on them they're in an inner
[46:10] prison
[46:11] and because they have a charge to keep
[46:13] them safe who's 25 but at midnight we'll
[46:17] give them out some Praises tonight Paul
[46:19] and Silas pray what did they do
[46:23] they prayed and some Praises unto God
[46:26] and the prisoners with them she was not
[46:28] kind of whispering him they were praying
[46:31] they were calling upon God
[46:33] so suddenly
[46:36] you know who the prophet said you had to
[46:38] do something
[46:38] and suddenly there was a great little
[46:41] creek
[46:42] so that the foundations of the prisoner
[46:44] were shaking and immediately all the
[46:47] doors were open and everyone bands were
[46:50] loosed or praised me of the Lord and The
[46:54] Keeper of the prison awakened out of his
[46:56] sleep and seeing the prison doors open
[46:59] if we saw it I would have killed himself
[47:01] supposedly not the prisoners had fled
[47:02] but Paul cried will love us say do do
[47:04] lights have no harm for we are all here
[47:07] and then he called for a light sprung in
[47:09] and came trembling and fell on me for
[47:11] Poland Silas and brought them out and
[47:13] said sirs what must I do to be saved and
[47:18] they said believe on the Lord Jesus
[47:19] Christ
[47:20] and thou shall be saved and thy house
[47:23] may God bless his word tonight I trust
[47:27] tonight that this has been quite
[47:29] something for you to see what we're
[47:31] going back to we are going back to
