Lord believers the things of God precious people across they're sincere and genuine people my Holy Spirit of God move on how they were so blessed they wanted to have a question-and-answer session that's what had in plans but by 10 meters over there's no questions that was really really something but this morning you will be blessed this morning but Antonio Brown will be speaking to word this morning but before he comes I just wanted to just read something for you here but this is God speaking to Joshua and got her and Josh for this book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth but also meditate therein day and night that Dom is observed to do according to all that is written therein for then thou shalt make their way prosperous and thou shall have good success have not I commanded thee be strong and of a good courage be not afraid neither be thou dismayed for the Lord thy God is with thee whithersoever thou goest and before that God told Joshua additional not any man be able to stand before thee I will all the days of my life as I was with Moses I will be with thee I was not feeling or nor forsake thee but be strong I love good courage for under this people shall adorn divine for an inheritance the land which I swear unto their fathers to give them and it's it's something else to see why God will actually give Joshua and remind him to be courageous and to be strong because they grow in a battle they never went before and I landed never went up before to deal with conditions and people have never dealt with before and whenever you are confronted with issues and challenges have never done before you need that we will call courage courage is put in your strength at risk and the word courage is dictionary the ability to do something that frightens one you're afraid but you're still gonna do it you're afraid to stand up but just just under takes courage amen strength in the face of pain and grief that's courage the words that synonyms that write with courage is bravery valor fearlessness nerve audacity bulnes metal determination fortitude backbone spine spunk spirit that would courage that would that first part cool is a French French based word it means on the heart so courage another head ting is a hot thing reckon when Jesus was taken by the soldiers to be crucified Peter lost courage his head believed but his hat Miedema run he didn't have the courage to stand for Jesus so he denied Christ because he didn't have that courage you have to have courage in life to deal with life issues oh praise the name of the Lord courage is the choice and willingness to confront agony pain danger uncertainty and intimidation it's a choice hallelujah and listen to this carefully you are not born with it let me say it again you were not born with it so you have to acquire it and that is why God told Joshua be strong strength is not enough but courage when you when you put your strength at risk score just when things are significant shaky but you know what you have to do what a man got to do we got to do or glory that God you want to be a Christian you want to be a Christian you wonder seal the Lord you wanna serve the Lord you have to have courage or glory to God hallelujah praise the name of the Lord or blurry now God it was a war to go over to the other land hallelujah Moses was dead Joshua was a new man on the block and God told Joshua Moses my servant is dead take these people over didn't ever so just when action before but he had perished they say God spoke to me and what to me we are going over that's how you got

hallelujah 11 is that last great kill the prophets in here in this message he said so revival in all day how can we have it when the regular revival giver is bound by the world God won't come in where the world is you can just depend on that he said you associated with the world then it's it's all kind of it's all kind of it amen but when you let the world creep in and then you go to acting like the world he said you're finished he said but when you cut loose of every setter from the world and come to God and that's what we come to do this morning the Word of God is it a cut you loose hallelujah cut you loose from every feather of the world from everything that binds you from everything that tells you you can overcome that you can break it we had a cut you loose this morning you said I let them go they are God's people they are God's chosen you are cartilage or what can separate us from the love of God and death and peril and famine and pestilence no no no I say nothing this morning then separate you from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus do you believe it is small he said I come to God then God will use you until you go to Flitton again he said he is the only hope that I have this morning to wonder my message is this he said that while Sampson was found a new shock of here grow doubt Oh hallelujah I have my only hope right in the darkness light sprung up somewhere somebody is catching a revelation of who they are in God that you are not a bun slave to Satan no no no but you are of that army of the Living God that God calls you to be part of this mysterious glorious body of Christ by one spirit we are baptized into that party I represent that party we speak in that party we prophesy in that party ojala and if God wants to use the party to heal the sick and he just moves and you responded because you're part of that party this morning by a glorious wonderful baptism of the Holy Ghost and fire oh are you in the church triumphant are you in

to go over into God is calling this morning we swung to respond to the law we spawned a zoo [Music] [Applause] same and somebody came into my hallelujah [Applause] while Samson was bound a new shock of hair grown out here it is a strand of hope oh honey I write about him said yet God send us another church just before the end time that the power of the Holy Ghost can come into her in the demonstrations of the Spirit just like they have in book of Acts amen hallelujah see mark 16 that can follow the church acts 2:4 acts 2:38 all of it will be following right along with the church signs and wonders accompanying the Apostles great signs of his resurrection accompany them he said while we're in prison surely the prophet said surely God's growing a crop somewhere oh maybe you my Christian friend that God's pouring a crop somewhere got a lot of people somewhere not like anything that travelers ever seen he don't even know who you are this morning you don't even know us locked up inside of you but God is going to release it what is gonna break the silence for your life and the devil is in for a run this more because the pride is getting to know who she is who God is and the people that know that God will be strong and to great exploits great exploits in speech great exploits in anointed great exploits in power they cannot heal the sick they're gonna raise the dead greater things and please shall you do because I crawl into my father uoq also greater things can't hear can't hear greater things are still to be done greater things are waiting to pray for in this

last great kill and it's about a war really it's about a conflict a conflict between God and Satan a war a war that did not originate here nor did it start here among us it happened away long before long before there was a moon long before there was a star before there was anything but God created a heavens the Bible tells us there was a war that happened up there and you read about it just now in Revelation 12 isn't there a war between Michael and his angels who fought against the devil and his angels oh honey there was a war take place the devil wanted to get the worship the devil wanted to get the praise that corner was gettin the table one is a cat it's hollow he was jealous of it he wanted some for himself but he knew that they wouldn't do it willfully so he had to tell a lie he had to slip some truth the word in order to catch them before I'll have to come on his side I need you see the angels and told them a tale I was not true I was not of this disc audibly speak about this core that we worship but there were some angels student Michael and there was some angels that's to the devil and they fought against one another I say this morning their son who is stand with the devil but there are some this morning who are faithful and true with the promise of God for this last day they will stand faithful to the world hallelujah praise God hallelujah hallelujah an

is this and all lineages that some people are very happy to talk about their legacy look at what we have achieved look at what we have accomplished look at what we have done look at what he have made hallelujah and the thing that is just natural associations and people feel so proud of that we will be so glad in that you see some police officers maybe they abuse their power you see some lawyers some judges maybe they abuse their power just because they who they are affiliated with just because who they are associated with and to think that you are associated this morning not with natural

now watch the prophets it here on greetings battle ya know before anybody could be put in re they first have to choose a meeting room or a place where the battle is to be fought a selected place and in the First World War it was called no man's land all right places where they formed they had to be a place selected is now on an Israel went to war the Philistines he said it was a hill on each side where they gathered and so on that was a place where they fought the Lions and everything is that it had to be a place selected he said and this is a mutual ground no man's land they fight here in this place so it's a mutual ground go to meet you there but it never committed a also it's a mutual ground they both have to be able to to clash at this point in the battle ground hallelujah is not right it's not and they fight here this place they don't just fight one over here and one over down here and one round on there he said there's a battle front where they meet and they test their power it's not in the battlefront where they meet and they test their powers test a nuclear test their bombs test their guns it's not there's got to be a battlefront where each army tested strength against the other army a mutual meeting place he said now don't miss this when this great battle started on it there had to be a mutual meeting place they have to be a place selected for the battle to begin and for the battle to reach and a battleground begins in a human mind that's where it starts it's not what I were just talking about yesterday it's not it starts in a mine then it drops down to your heart it's not right he said but that's where it starts it is alright because that's where decisions are made from the mind from the head it's not right because thou hast chosen there now away the harder way you have chosen holily is not right it means nothing of mine said no they never started it from some organization they never started it from some mechanical affair okay you said the grounds never started a therefore that organization could never do the work of God because a battleground is where you've got to meet your enemy a man is in the mind and you've got to make your choice holily and it beats you you make your choice to serve God you make a conscious decision a conscious clear-cut decision harder to serve God finally in season out of season what do you feel like it what do you don't feel like it you've got your mind made up to serve the Lord and you won't turn back because you make out a promise that you is gonna make it somehow somewhere deep in your soul you take courage and what the word says he said I'll never leave you he said I'll never forsake you he's never I'll be with you in your trials on your job in your home on the streets wherever whenever he will meet you

us salvation he's calling us to repentance he's calling us to the Holy Ghost he's calling us back to himself the angel of God is on yet the manifestation the Holy Spirit is that angel trival appears not that this or that but to the Word of God because God can only manifest the world [Music] he cannot manifest your thoughts that's why we don't preach all thoughts in this church we preach the Word of God in season out of season because when the Holy Spirit falls it will fall upon this it kind of fall upon preach and kind of thrown upon dogmas and kind of wallop on dreams and interpretation but

calls for theater for the sisters with female conditions made for high blood pressure low blood pressure seek for every foul spirit Paula we speak a word of healing a word of deliverance or what a manifestation of every prophecy lore we have a burden today for the backsliders of Lord those that are struggling those that don't know we're doing a make it those that are wondering but as your servant preached that woman at the well she didn't know her name was being called she didn't know how vile had been polar and she didn't know Messiah was in the air and he came to call her name from the book father called me you call names this morning from your blood section of the book not to let your sons and daughters know that no sin their past their condemnation cannot stop what God has planned and predestinated for us father let the fire fall let the anointing follow your people follow us on the road follow us in our holes up may you even step into our homes up so that when we get

you for the grace that you have given us to be reminded of placing you reminded of your love for us reminded of our eternal destination reminded Lord because we have spiritual amnesia when we walked and lived here but Lord your work came to remove the scales remove the blindness from us to give us a joy to give us a peace ago as a comfort we think you'll be committed into your hands in the freshness team of Jesus Christ and the church says amen amen amen he may be seated in the presence of the Lord one day the service will not over one day will break into such a realm all that consumes your minds but the Antony brought out he said there has to be a place where the war is fought there has to be a place where the frontline of the battle takes place and that place has been agreed it's in your mind but if you could just be renewed and transformed by the renewing of your mind to recognize that that the thoughts have come to you the negative towards the thoughts of fear and unbelief that's not from God and if your faith in the word that you hear every service could be so anointed that it could deal with the doubts and the fears in your mind if you shall believe and if you shall see and speak to your situation you don't even need a pastor to speak to your situation you have the power to speak to your situation you have the power to speak in your home god meat and cream and eat order the veal from top to bottom to abolish the old priesthood to let you know that you are royal priests you are a peculiar people you are holy nation and there's power locked up in you that the devil does not want you to know there's power in you that the devil wish you don't look in the room in your soul where the power is he wants to distract you with your job so you don't see the power distract you with family problem so you don't see your power distract you with your sickness so that you don't see the power but if you could look beyond your sickness look beyond your family look beyond your problems look beyond the mortgage look beyond the bills look beyond your situation and see the power and all of a sudden you could speak with confidence knowing that God is in you God is working through you can the church say man you love the Lord this morning are you happy to be in the house of the Lord this morning are you willing to serve Him to fight for him are you enlisted in the army of the Lord I love it when Anthony said 23 things yes sir no sir I don't know sir yes to his word nor to the devil's lies and tricks and what you don't know that's why it's morning to get to know the things to all the promises to get to know the weapons at your disposal not just one weapon but every wood is a weapon a word for sickness that's a weapon for sickness a word for you
