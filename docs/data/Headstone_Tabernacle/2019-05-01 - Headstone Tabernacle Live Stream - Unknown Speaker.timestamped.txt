[19:14] soul out of it no matter how much years
[19:17] of slavery
[19:18] fearow try to inflict upon the people
[19:21] there was always a word
[19:23] stored up there for the children of
[19:26] Israel to pull from the Bible said I
[19:28] heard a cry for my people God chillie
[19:32] heard the cries of Israel honor in the
[19:35] time and season as they were anointing
[19:37] the promised word for their team Oh
[19:42] I want you to catch something now and
[19:45] talk God spoke to Abraham pulling at his
[19:47] children with so children a strange land
[19:49] but in a mighty handy he'll take them
[19:52] out that world was always laying there
[19:55] they may not have been need for it
[19:58] when choose it was around and different
[20:01] things
[20:01] isn't that right but the world was
[20:04] always there and we have a promise of
[20:07] the world tonight coming to a
[20:09] manifestation because that's what the
[20:12] light is when the light of the day is
[20:14] shining upon you it is a manifestation
[20:17] of the word for all day that's what that
[20:20] is is that right and what we're looking
[20:23] for what we honor expectation for is a
[20:26] manifestation of what the Prophet said
[20:29] hallelujah amen what he spoke a promise
[20:33] of dynamics he said this bride hasn't
[20:35] had a revival yet or her but she's
[20:38] pointing to have it those seven unknown
[20:41] thunders will wake up or he will send it
[20:44] he promised it
[20:46] o prophet said so and we're here to
[20:49] believe it tonight
[20:50] we had a pray for it we had a beyond
[20:52] that expectation for it
[20:55] [Music]
[20:57] God will not fail us and he will not
[20:59] forsake us a man so the world was always
[21:03] me Leonie God had already prophesied
[21:07] that over his seed that it shall possess
[21:09] the gate of the enemy isn't that right
[21:12] that a mighty hand you'll bring them out
[21:14] and bring it into their own land and my
[21:18] people shall never be ashamed a man L
[21:20] eaten plenty and they be satisfied and
[21:23] they praise the name of their God from
[21:25] this time forth that's a prophecy
[21:27] hanging over you but now there might
[21:30] have been need for it yet time had to
[21:33] roll along and it makes me think about
[21:36] that scripture praise God when I
[21:39] Jesus told a parable about the sower how
[21:41] the husbandmen went forth and sold seeds
[21:43] and any even one come my light on so
[21:45] other seeds praise Niraj and he said
[21:48] look master look what the evil one has
[21:50] done shall we reap it now and he said no
[21:52] let the two go together until the time
[21:55] of the harvest
[21:56] praise God night and I love sent for the
[21:58] Reapers because by your fruits you will
[22:01] know them you will know the ones that
[22:02] sleep with the word and you'll know the
[22:04] ones that fell away prease gone into
[22:07] their own interpretations but my word I
[22:09] will restore my word I will anoint my
[22:12] word I will bring to pass Oh glory to
[22:16] God are you happy tonight that you
[22:19] stayed with that word
[22:20] aren't you happy tonight that you stayed
[22:22] with the reveal with a monocot for
[22:24] harlot that word cannot fall to the
[22:27] ground every vision of the prophets all
[22:29] came to pass and just as every vision
[22:32] shall come to pass the prophet saw bride
[22:35] walking in her sweetness in humility
[22:37] that vision will come to pass tonight oh
[22:42] that bride will come into view Ohan only
[22:46] on the people that will make up that
[22:47] bride is sitting in this audience here
[22:49] tonight you me hallelujah who stayed
[22:52] with that word you have a promise
[22:54] hallelujah to walk with the Messiah
[22:56] right out of here praise God into glory
[22:59] land the eleven tonight get a lot of
[23:01] shout of praise
[23:03] [Applause]
[23:06] [Music]
[23:10] we man I believe in so now there was a
[23:14] need for a deity time hadn't come in yet
[23:17] the word uncommented season and that's
[23:21] all we're looking for the word to come
[23:22] at a season and now we lower revivals
[23:25] was ready to break forth but a revival
[23:28] don't coming out of Boonen without a
[23:30] sacrifice without a burden for it and
[23:33] now we see cross darkness rolling out in
[23:35] this message and we see after the years
[23:38] of rule by the ones that have sleep with
[23:40] the word and the ones that are falling
[23:42] away
[23:43] hey man ma taught us world is being
[23:45] proven right there on the spot who was
[23:48] really for this gospel and who was on a
[23:51] lot of things it's not right
[23:52] isn't that right who was on other
[23:54] persuasions oh I feel like Paul tonight
[23:59] we are fully persuaded a meant by this
[24:01] word here that what he promised will
[24:04] take place I'm Philippe of Sweden and we
[24:07] can receive the Holy Ghost the same
[24:09] penny to receive holidays in America
[24:12] that different ones who see hallelujah
[24:13] all the brothers all the sisters all 120
[24:17] was filled with the Holy Ghost amen
[24:20] you can receive it to my sister you can
[24:23] receive it to my brother don't be afraid
[24:25] it's just his presence Oh
[24:28] when you feel it upon your heart reach
[24:30] out and grab it by the Holy Ghost
[24:31] hallelujah
[24:32] grab it by saying Amen because that's
[24:35] your promise Amen hallelujah hallelujah
[24:38] Amen so what we get in the sea now is a
[24:41] word and season it's just like a prophet
[24:44] said you know that world was spinning in
[24:46] chaos he doesn't know he said well we
[24:49] don't know how long that was he said in
[24:51] the beginning there was God said it
[24:53] could be 100 years thousand years he
[24:55] said it was just spinning like that but
[24:57] God spoke a word and said let there be
[24:59] light he said he didn't know long long
[25:01] that took but it didn't matter what
[25:03] mattered was what he said came to pass
[25:06] Amen what matters was when God spoke
[25:08] that like had to come forth didn't
[25:11] matter how long it took didn't matter
[25:13] how long the earth was in darkness they
[25:15] come a point when the word had to come
[25:17] into a manifestation and when it did was
[25:21] be like oh when the word came into a
[25:28] manifestation all the time who was word
[25:30] now well the time was just spoken he
[25:33] spoke it over the darkness and a lady s
[25:36] prophecy nobody knows for how long the
[25:39] prophet said but when it took place when
[25:42] it happened when it materialized God
[25:46] said that is the light hallelujah and
[25:49] everything else was tactless and he
[25:51] separated so when the court spoke to the
[25:58] prophets and set those seven thunders or
[26:01] gonna wake up a bride that word might
[26:03] City for a long time on books and tapes
[26:06] but when that group hallelujah hallelu

[29:20] wrong Easter time please God he talked
[29:22] about the slave and his slave owners and
[29:24] does that joy of being liberated and I
[29:27] always used to think about that you know
[29:28] just to know that a proclamation of
[29:30] emancipation has gone out and I'd like
[29:33] to think about how those slaves felt
[29:35] when the proclamation was set out they
[29:38] weren't officially free yet there was a
[29:41] day that was set for them to be free
[29:43] isn't that right there was a day in the
[29:45] calendar I was set for them to be free
[29:47] and even though the slave master had his
[29:50] power over them he had a revelation that
[29:53] that power was temporary
[29:55] there's a revelation come on that the
[29:57] slave masters whip was only temporary
[30:00] because they already receive a
[30:02] proclamation of emancipation and
[30:05] tonight's the 700 to Billie trumpet
[30:08] astounding oh and if you want to receive

[36:55] to me and told me what was gonna take
[36:57] place doesn't matter where you believe
[36:59] it whether you don't believe it
[37:01] hallelujah Jesus is in me
[37:04] and that's how I feel tonight there'll
[37:06] be a bride on the urge
[37:07] who will confess crisis in me I don't
[37:10] care what do you believe it
[37:11] what do you don't believe it whether the
[37:13] demons go on a rampage we have a
[37:15] revelation that Christ is being formed
[37:18] in us just like he was being formed in
[37:20] Mary oh oh it makes a shout
[37:25] it makes us worship it makes us lift our
[37:27] hands it makes us pray harder it makes
[37:30] us press harder why because we know in
[37:33] who we have believed Peter said we are
[37:41] you see coming advise Peebles is now
[37:44] right we're not preaching stories this
[37:47] is real people real people think about
[37:51] it Mary a young lady young as they come
[37:55] Virgin choose to be married God revealed
[37:59] and she just walked by feet to shelter
[38:04] it just wasn't America chosen the word
[38:07] of the angel interrupted her life it
[38:11] interrupted her plans where she saw
[38:13] herself 15 years down the road or
[38:15] whatever it was interrupted she knew to
[38:18] reproach she had to suffer yet she went
[38:20] willingly priests caught because she
[38:23] knew she believed in a vision that was
[38:26] created on her that she was supreme for
[38:28] the Messiah he promised Messiah for that
[38:32] day oh I feel good tonight appeal aureus
[38:36] to know that we have received a
[38:38] revelation that we are to bring forth
[38:40] Messiah in our team Oh hallelujah
[38:44] brother priests caught it ought to make
[38:46] you jockey jump for joy Amen hallelujah
[38:50] go under Jesus and you'll be sad and it
[38:55] will be joyful fourth season he said but
[38:57] your sorrow will be turned into joy when
[38:59] you begin to see by revelation what he
[39:02] has done in the scripture what he has
[39:04] done in the word he doesn't show it all
[39:05] but he does it then he looks back
[39:09] shows you what he has done and a
[39:11] prophetic ministry looked back and
[39:13] showed us that all down through the ages
[39:15] God is trying to come up to something
[39:18] it wasn't perfection yet but it was
[39:21] pieces of it
[39:22] it was bits of it it was shadows and
[39:24] types coming on to something real coming
[39:27] on to something closer and Paul brought
[39:30] upon the arena's brother Pat Martin
[39:32] brought a part and it keep coming up
[39:34] there hallelujah and begin to build
[39:37] because now if you are a part of this
[39:40] great plan then God has to have a spot
[39:43] for you
[39:44] God have to have a little void or cap
[39:46] for you to step into if you're supposed
[39:49] to be the bride for this thing so what
[39:51] we gonna show what Martin later what
[39:53] Wesley dinner what Luther there and all

[40:37] the covenant that's what he come down to
[40:41] claim what he has already bought and
[40:42] paid for it's not honey when he comes to
