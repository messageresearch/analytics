[14:43] God bless you and each of your Bibles
[14:47] I'd like you to
[14:50] tune with me to Romans
[14:53] chapter 10.
[14:58] reading from verse 4 Romans chapter 10.
[15:02] reading from verse 4.
[15:04] Romans chapter 10. for Christ is the end
[15:08] of the law
[15:09] or righteousness to everyone that
[15:11] believeth
[15:12] for Moses described it the righteousness
[15:14] which is of the law
[15:16] that the man which do it those things
[15:18] shall live by them
[15:20] but the righteousness which is of Faith
[15:22] speaks on this wise
[15:25] synonym heart who shall Ascend into
[15:27] heaven that is to bring Christ down from
[15:30] above
[15:31] or who shall Ascend into the deep that
[15:34] is to bring Christ up again from the
[15:36] dead but what see at it the word
[15:40] is 90
[15:42] even in thy mouth and in thy heart that
[15:46] is the word of faith which we preach
[15:48] for or if for if Thou shalt confess with
[15:51] thy among the Lord Jesus
[15:53] and Shall Believe in thine heart that
[15:55] God had risen from the dead though shall
[15:58] be seen
[15:59] foreign
[16:05] on the Salvation or last scripture we're
[16:08] going to read us from Genesis chapter
[16:09] 24.
[16:10] you want to read from verse 54 to 60.
[16:14] and this is after Elisa are found
[16:17] Rebecca
[16:18] and came to a home with gifts speaking
[16:21] to the parents and so on because he was
[16:23] seeking our pride for Isaac
[16:25] and this is from verse 54 and they did
[16:29] eat and drink he and the men that were
[16:31] with him
[16:31] carried all night
[16:33] the rules up in the morning he said send
[16:36] me a wing unto my master
[16:38] and her brother and her mother said let
[16:40] the damsel abide with us for a few days
[16:42] add at least 10. after that she shall go
[16:46] so they wanted extension of Rebecca
[16:48] State at a home
[16:50] but he said unto them as a 56 here let
[16:53] me not seeing the Lord had prospered my
[16:55] way
[16:56] send me away
[16:58] that I may go to my master
[17:00] and they said we will call the damsel
[17:03] and inquire at her mouth
[17:06] and they call Rebecca and said unto her
[17:08] will thou go with this man
[17:11] and he said and she said I will go
[17:14] and they sent away Rebecca the assistant
[17:17] and her nurse and Abraham's servant and
[17:20] his men
[17:24] without a mother of thousands of
[17:27] millions are led by seed possess the
[17:30] Gate of those which hit them may God
[17:33] bless his word
[17:34] I trust the Lord that you are doing fine
[17:38] and as I said sometime I'm back or after
[17:43] Wednesday night service how do we show
[17:46] God that we love him by conducting
[17:49] ourselves with joy amidst the trials he
[17:53] in his wisdom sense are we
[17:55] so tonight
[17:58] I have a word for you
[18:01] and it's God wants to hear from your
[18:05] mouth
[18:07] God wants to hear from your mouth like
[18:10] your mother mouth your sister mouth your
[18:11] brother-in-law your father mode your
[18:13] mouth
[18:14] you know there are people that say pray
[18:15] for me pray for me they're not praying
[18:16] for the self and if you begin to pray
[18:18] they well yes Lord yes Lord yes or
[18:20] they're not praying or not they're
[18:21] backing up your prayer godo want you to
[18:24] just be a prayer backer which is fine
[18:26] there's nothing wrong with that
[18:28] but he wants to hear from you your own
[18:30] mode
[18:31] now the scripture we read in
[18:33] and Romans I want to read a portion of
[18:36] it in the Amplified
[18:38] from verse 8. it says but what does it
[18:41] see
[18:42] the word
[18:44] God's message in Christ is near you
[18:47] on your lips
[18:49] and in your heart that is the word
[18:53] the message the basis and object of our
[18:57] faith which we preach
[19:00] because this name if you acknowledge and
[19:04] confess with your lips
[19:06] that Jesus is Lord
[19:08] and in your heart believe adhere to
[19:13] trust in
[19:15] and rely on the truth
[19:17] that God reason from the dead you will
[19:20] be saved
[19:21] this is what I want to come to was 10
[19:23] for with the heart
[19:25] a person believes
[19:28] adheres to
[19:30] trust in
[19:31] and relies on Christ
[19:34] and so is Justified
[19:36] declared righteous
[19:38] are acceptable to God and with the mouth
[19:41] the demote he confesses declares openly
[19:46] and speaks out freely his face
[19:49] and confirms
[19:51] his salvation
[19:52] so God wants to hear from your mouth and
[19:58] your mold or what your confession is
[20:00] supposed to be what's in your heart
[20:03] if you're speaking one thing on your
[20:04] heart saying something else like
[20:05] hypocrisy
[20:07] because that is what the Holy Spirit
[20:09] picks up
[20:10] the Holy Spirit picks up what's in the
[20:12] heart
[20:13] what is in your heart and it comes out
[20:16] by the confession of your mouth
[20:19] well Hebrews 3 1
[20:22] is a scripture about a band referred to
[20:24] quite a lot
[20:26] wherefore holy Brethren particles of the
[20:28] heaven we call him
[20:30] consider the Apostle and high priest of
[20:34] our profession
[20:36] Christ Jesus and he explained that this
[20:39] word profession is confession the high
[20:41] priest of our confession well let's read
[20:44] a few things I'll see what the Lord do
[20:46] tonight
[20:48] he speaks
[20:49] Hebrews 3 1 the Bible said he is a high
[20:52] priest of our confession is that right
[20:55] it's profess and confesses the same word
[20:58] there
[20:59] you know he can't do one thing for us
[21:02] till we accept it
[21:04] and say that we have accepted it
[21:07] and believe it
[21:09] and testify of it is that right so you
[21:13] have to accept it and see it
[21:14] you can't hear the word and say some
[21:16] kind of nonsense or say something
[21:18] negative you have to accept it and so
[21:20] you believe it testify of it
[21:23] he can't do nothing no matter what
[21:26] yes
[21:28] you've got to accept it first by faith
[21:31] and believe it and confess that it is
[21:35] right
[21:36] and he before God makes it right in your
[21:39] stead as a high priest
[21:42] a high priest is to make intercessions
[21:45] is that right he touched by the feeling
[21:48] of our affirmities now as far as I know
[21:51] to be the truth and God knows that
[21:54] and if you're here tonight every one of
[21:56] you
[21:57] would accept Jesus right now as your
[21:59] healer and say Lord
[22:01] this settle it right here
[22:04] I don't care if I eat twice as bad
[22:07] if I am three times a sick
[22:10] five times as lean if I can't do no more
[22:14] than wiggle my finger I'm going to
[22:16] wiggle my finger and give you praise
[22:18] amen you healed me
[22:21] and as far as I know the scripture is to
[22:23] be true God
[22:25] is under obligation
[22:28] if your heart is pure and clean to make
[22:30] you well then we say Amen tonight oh
[22:33] blessed be the name of the Lord
[22:35] now the gospel friends as clear as I
[22:37] know it it's the individual
[22:41] now USC well what's the use in preaching
[22:44] that's what a minister is for
[22:47] God send preachers to preach the word
[22:49] when you hear it search it seize the
[22:53] truth accept it no the preacher doesn't
[22:55] save you his message doesn't save you
[22:59] your personal fate in a Risen Lord Jesus
[23:02] is what saves you
[23:03] no matter how much you cry
[23:06] how loud you want to holler how much you
[23:09] want to take on it will never save you
[23:11] until you believe it with your heart
[23:14] stand up and confess it for he is the
[23:18] high priest of our confession
[23:21] or Hebrews 3 or we confess he's the high
[23:25] priest to make a decision upon what we
[23:28] confess is the truth
[23:30] any team there we go that was included
[23:33] in the atonement in the is the personal
[23:36] property of every believer this
[23:39] statement would repeated
[23:41] anything
[23:42] that was included
[23:45] in the atonement
[23:47] in the personal prop is the personal
[23:49] property of everybody no your obedient
[23:51] challenge tonight
[23:53] to go past your own feelings
[23:56] failures
[23:58] fears
[23:59] shortcomings
[24:01] weaknesses struggles
[24:04] to see what God has said
[24:07] and whether you believe what God Said by
[24:09] the word
[24:11] when a man gets saved for a woman boy or
[24:14] girl
[24:15] God gives them a checkbook as it was
[24:17] when Jesus name at the bottom of every
[24:19] check
[24:20] for anything redempted blessing that
[24:23] Jesus died for
[24:25] it's your personal property
[24:28] think about it is that a change business
[24:31] it's not a church of fear it's your
[24:34] personal
[24:35] property
[24:37] don't
[24:38] be afraid to fill it out
[24:41] the bank of heaven will recognize it
[24:44] Jesus said well watch how he connects
[24:47] the scripture together with this Jesus
[24:49] said whatever things you desire
[24:53] When you pray
[24:55] believe you receive it
[25:00] what you ask the father in my name that
[25:02] will I do the unlimited unsuitable
[25:05] Riches of Jesus Christ so you know what
[25:07] he says whatsoever thing to desire When
[25:09] you pray believe you have received it
[25:11] and you shall receive it so yeah almost
[25:13] you believe in before you actually have
[25:15] it
[25:16] let's continue
[25:19] he cannot do nothing for us
[25:22] until first we confess that he has done
[25:25] it and act upon it
[25:28] whatever things you desire When you pray
[25:30] believe you receive a that's the order
[25:32] you believe it no
[25:34] and you receive it and it shall be given
[25:38] unto you
[25:39] he cannot hear you until fools you
[25:42] confess he has
[25:45] but if you would accept no what he has
[25:47] done for you
[25:48] okay
[25:49] now in other words he cannot save you by
[25:53] the Merit of your prayer
[25:55] he cannot save you by the merits of your
[25:58] enthusiasm or your good books
[26:01] he saves you
[26:03] by the merits of your faith and your
[26:05] confession
[26:06] and they bring you right back to brother
[26:08] Kelly so testimony where you say he was
[26:10] at his lowest wondering how are we going
[26:12] to get out of this hole out of this and
[26:15] sometimes we find ourselves in spots in
[26:18] spots of depression frustration anguish
[26:20] loneliness tiredness weariness and just
[26:25] almost like lost in our own world
[26:28] bubble
[26:30] and we crash and it looks like all is
[26:33] gone All Is Lost and all of a sudden
[26:36] you could come to the speech and say
[26:37] Lord this is me I'm weak I'm struggling
[26:40] I'm needy of you and I come to put my
[26:43] trust in you and get strength from you
[26:45] all of a sudden that strength comes on
[26:47] in
[26:48] listen to this again
[26:52] he cannot save you by the marriage of
[26:55] your prayer
[26:56] he cannot save you by the merits of your
[26:59] enthusiasm or your good works
[27:01] he saves you by the merits of your feet
[27:05] and your confession
[27:07] for if you would confess me before men
[27:10] him will I confess before my father will
[27:13] be angel
[27:14] there's no need of arguing of it whether
[27:16] it's in the atonement if it's any word
[27:18] God is Sovereign and has to fulfill his
[27:21] word God said so
[27:24] God is no more than his word
[27:27] and if his word is no good then he is no
[27:30] good
[27:31] I if I can't control confidence in what
[27:33] you say you are no good but you are just
[27:36] as good as you would
[27:38] and God is just as good as his word is
[27:42] as a Christian believer here we go I
[27:45] believe this Bible
[27:48] is inspired and it is written by the
[27:52] Holy Spirit
[27:52] and it is the infallible word of God and
[27:56] God is under obligation to his word to
[27:59] the believer that will accept this word
[28:01] and any word is a seed if you accept it
[28:04] in your heart by faith believe it and
[28:07] confess it God will bring it to pass
[28:10] this tonight can't feel
[28:14] the word is a seed you receive it you
[28:17] accept it you confess it you act upon it
[28:20] and it will materialize
[28:22] okay listen close
[28:26] you will never live above your
[28:27] confession
[28:30] Jesus is the high piece of a confession
[28:32] is that right
[28:33] no I'm not safe tonight because I get
[28:36] happy and shocked that isn't it I cannot
[28:39] see because my gift of God works through
[28:42] me
[28:43] I am saved because I have met the
[28:47] conditions that Jesus Christ acquired
[28:49] from me I am saved according to the
[28:52] Bible is that right
[28:54] here we go this is above and this has
[28:57] affected
[28:58] people see we see these type people get
[29:00] problems with this not because I feel
[29:03] like I am saved
[29:06] Satan can whip you around the stump on
[29:10] your feelings
[29:12] but he can't
[29:13] when it is Dusty at the Lord see he
[29:16] can't do that he can't wait across that
[29:19] that defeating
[29:21] so that is why you can't go by your
[29:25] emotions by your feelings by what you
[29:28] see with your eyes and your sight you
[29:31] can't go by that
[29:32] as a son you have to use the eye of
[29:36] Faith because that was God that that's
[29:39] what God did and he expresses sons and
[29:42] Prophets to be the same
[29:44] now when you believe you will see
[29:46] sitting in your seat out wherever you
[29:49] accepted it I begin to confess and tell
[29:51] people you receive you kept on saying
[29:54] I'm saved
[29:55] the people say
[29:57] football Ram is drilling down
[29:59] ain't no difference in you
[30:01] but you believe their words is that
[30:03] right and you kept on with your
[30:05] confession
[30:07] and after a while it worked
[30:09] righteousness I sure especially you all
[30:11] the ones remember when they gave your
[30:13] heart to the Lord and started to testify
[30:14] to your family and friends of course
[30:16] people mock you laugh at you but with a
[30:18] red joy to give a testimony I am saved
[30:20] Jesus saved me I got baptized in Jesus
[30:22] name the feeling good you will be the
[30:24] word of God for Peters have repent every
[30:27] one of you and be baptized in the name
[30:29] of Jesus Christ for the mission of your
[30:30] sins and you feel all your sins just
[30:32] wash away if you clean you feel pure you
[30:35] feel cool you feel ready by God you feel
[30:38] it doubles around you and the more you
[30:40] talk about it it's the more and give
[30:42] your juice and give you energy Your
[30:44] Enthusiasm
[30:45] I remember I was feeling low in my early
[30:47] Christian walk and my brother who I
[30:49] looked up to he I met him I started
[30:52] talking about him the backside and I was
[30:53] so shocked and I didn't think twice I
[30:55] didn't testify him I said you could talk
[30:57] about backslide and when I said oh
[30:59] goodness to him and talk about the
[31:01] goodness of God all of a sudden my Blues
[31:04] my dong that left
[31:06] I got strength and I got energized
[31:08] because I want to know oh come a senior
[31:10] brother or older brother like that
[31:12] talking about backsliding and I'm a new
[31:14] convert I'm fresh on the Block and I'm
[31:16] going to my battles and stuff and here
[31:18] it is over going backside I said no way
[31:20] oh you could do that we could think
[31:22] about that that is something although my
[31:25] more give my testimony out of my mouth
[31:27] came something to share and that
[31:28] encouraged him and he saw the political
[31:32] okay the people say there ain't no
[31:34] difference in you you believe their
[31:36] wives and you kept with your confession
[31:38] and after a while it worked
[31:40] righteousness and all your neighbors and
[31:43] everybody knows you are saved now
[31:44] because you believe it you confess it
[31:47] what happened
[31:49] what changed you
[31:51] is the high priest of your confession
[31:52] sit in the right hand of the father
[31:54] making good what you are confessing and
[31:58] then he switches now to say the same
[32:00] thing is in by healing you accept him as
[32:04] your healer renounce your feelings see
[32:07] I'm feeling sick I'm feeling more sick I
[32:09] feel terrible no renounce your feelings
[32:13] it is not by feelings it's by faith
[32:17] say you are healed
[32:19] believe you are healed
[32:21] act like you are healed associate with
[32:24] those who believe in healing and God
[32:27] will bring you right out to perfect
[32:30] sowness of Health it will not fail oh
[32:34] Blessed Be can we give God some presents
[32:38] right here now
[32:40] God have been testing the patriarch
[32:43] because he had given my promise
[32:45] Hallelujah only those who have a promise
[32:48] him
[32:50] and when God makes a promise he wants to
[32:53] be sure that this person is worthy of
[32:56] the promise before he fulfills what he
[32:58] said or what he promises so Abraham had
[33:02] been promised that through his seed the
[33:04] whole world will be blessed and he will
[33:06] have a son and the son out of him should
[33:08] come forth a seed at the Blessed whole
[33:11] earth and Abraham when the promise was
[33:13] given to him was 75 years old see where
[33:16] his wife 65 years old but the Bible
[33:19] tells us that Abraham staggered not that
[33:21] the promises gone too unreleased he was
[33:23] strong given praise to God and God Time
[33:27] After Time tested him but he had come in
[33:31] to that final test
[33:34] before the blessings was going to happen
[33:36] brother Ovid you mean there's a final
[33:38] test yes all the test is not continuous
[33:41] continuous as a final test when that
[33:43] test is before the blessing was going to
[33:46] happen discontinue and that's the way it
[33:48] is with all the sins of Abraham God gave
[33:51] us that final test just before he gives
[33:55] the promise and if it is possible I like
[33:57] to say something here personally but I
[33:59] will hold that that
[34:01] final test
[34:03] to see how you would react upon it your
[34:07] reaction
[34:09] and when he had give Abraham is this
[34:11] test
[34:12] he found Abraham
[34:14] was just as true
[34:17] as he was when he started what a
[34:19] blessing it would be this morning if we
[34:22] who take his promise
[34:24] of healing would stand just as true as
[34:27] we did when we stood here and accepted
[34:29] it no matter what the doctor said stand
[34:31] just is true and when he did this never
[34:34] would tell his only son but was about to
[34:36] punch his knife into Isaac's bosom to
[34:39] destroy his testimony yet testify over
[34:42] the world to know it that he was
[34:44] acquainted with that he was going to
[34:46] have this son and when this son came he
[34:49] was asked to double back and to destroy
[34:52] the only hope that he had for his
[34:54] testimony to be fulfilled and when God
[34:57] seen that he was loyal to that fit that
[35:00] he had in God God looked out of the
[35:02] heavens and said I have sworn by myself
[35:05] that I bless you and multiply you and
[35:08] your seed shall possess the Gate of the
[35:11] enemy what a promise
[35:12] let me finish the Rebecca the
[35:14] description we read tonight and Rebecca
[35:17] which was to be the mother of this noted
[35:19] promise awaited son
[35:21] when she was called to the final test of
[35:24] a strange man that he'd never seen
[35:27] before only she seen the working of the
[35:29] Holy Spirit
[35:31] and when her parents could not fully
[35:33] decide whether she should go with a
[35:36] stranger or not to be wife of a man she
[35:39] had never seen she was brought to the
[35:42] final test we will get the damsel and
[35:46] let us speak we will hear from her mouth
[35:49] whether she will go yes or no
[35:52] and this is where I get this question
[35:54] for the night parameter
[35:55] and that is the way it is brought to all
[35:58] the seed of God
[36:00] it's got to be your mount
[36:04] God wants to hear from you
[36:09] this is not speaking to your wife or
[36:11] speaking to your children or speaking to
[36:12] your boss or your neighbor or your
[36:14] family or your relatives
[36:16] this is speaking to God
[36:18] God
[36:20] want to hear from you
[36:22] question
[36:24] if Jesus is to come in your home tonight
[36:27] and ask will you be made whole
[36:31] what would be your response
[36:33] there are some people they are content
[36:35] to be as they are
[36:37] if Jesus comes to land and say do you
[36:39] want to be changed
[36:41] do you want a Transformer life
[36:45] do you want to be healed do you want to
[36:47] be delivered there's some people they're
[36:50] not ready yet for deliverance because
[36:51] they don't want to give up is sin they
[36:54] don't want to give up the way how they
[36:56] live they choose themselves over the
[36:59] word
[37:00] so they choose their own pleasure
[37:02] there's a scripture they're talking
[37:03] about he that is strong
[37:05] uh help those that are weak or infirmed
[37:08] or such like that and not to please
[37:11] themselves
[37:13] there are so many Christians
[37:16] stay on the side of dependency
[37:19] where
[37:21] they're looking for somebody to pray for
[37:22] them
[37:23] somebody to encourage them
[37:26] somebody to bless them they bless no one
[37:29] they encourage no one they don't charge
[37:32] anyone or push anyone they are always in
[37:36] sick mood
[37:37] or independency mode or in depression
[37:41] mode they cannot even rise to confess I
[37:44] am healed I'm delivered and free or
[37:47] looking for the opportunity to share
[37:48] testimony and encourage someone you want
[37:51] to tell me God save you and you cannot
[37:54] get a testament and courage a soul
[37:58] a heart a life you probably talk about
[38:01] that man it's not as bright man on my
[38:03] right mind until you see Jesus Christ
[38:05] something is wrong
[38:07] he said that's the way it's brought to
[38:09] all the seed of God has got to be your
[38:12] mouth God wants to hear from you
[38:15] so when she was put to the test she
[38:17] never hesitated and she said I will go
[38:19] let me make up my mind she didn't say
[38:22] let me live in my mind let me start it
[38:24] over she was fully persuaded
[38:27] and that's the people that God can use
[38:30] when you're fully persuaded
[38:32] what could keep his promise
[38:34] all right I'm closing
[38:38] well the brand name was
[38:39] in a prayer line and he was talking to
[38:42] the people I just want to go through
[38:44] this mountain just pointing something to

[39:05] God don't doubt have faith I I'm not
[39:09] beside myself but I'm getting awful week
[39:12] I must stop just alone
[39:14] I trust that God has confirmed what I've
[39:16] told me the truth
[39:18] nothing in me believe him it doesn't
[39:20] matter whether you touch me or touch me
[39:22] now he will prove it now you lay your
