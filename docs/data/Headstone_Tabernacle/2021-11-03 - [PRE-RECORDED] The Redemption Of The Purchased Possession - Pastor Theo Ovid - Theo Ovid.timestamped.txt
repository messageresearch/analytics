[13:12] hallelujah

[13:17] [Applause]
[13:18] hallelujah
[13:20] well how many on the great expectation
[13:21] this morning
[13:23] i am i am on a great expectation to see
[13:25] what the lord will do among us
[13:27] because he promised to come among us
[13:29] promises speak to our hearts to minister
[13:31] to needs our needs and that's what we
[13:33] come here for
[13:34] to get our souls ministered and to reign
[13:36] amen so before we
[13:39] get into the service that we have for
[13:40] you this morning
[13:42] i want to just share
[13:44] a few thoughts with you
[13:46] from the prophet's message
[13:48] question and answers
[13:50] with the brahma
[13:51] god has a hard time
[13:54] trying to get
[13:56] somebody that he could deal with
[13:58] that will stay humble and meek
[14:01] and stay in the place
[14:03] until god calls him to do something
[14:05] you believe that
[14:07] see
[14:08] a man that god can bless and he will
[14:10] still keep himself a man
[14:13] and not be an angel or a god
[14:20] as soon as a man gets blessed
[14:23] and has a little
[14:25] there's a little something given to him
[14:27] i'm like oh but random freezer a little
[14:30] something just just a little something
[14:33] given to him he wants to be a god
[14:36] he wants to become an angel
[14:39] he wants to become some great person
[14:42] what i do me me mine all that
[14:46] that's the wrong attitude
[14:48] god's hunting for somebody
[14:51] who we could bless
[14:53] pour out the blessings
[14:56] and the more he is blessed the littler
[14:58] the man will become
[15:01] and you will never get more of god until
[15:04] you become nothing
[15:06] you have got to belittle yourself
[15:09] he that will exalt himself god will
[15:11] bring a beast and he will humble himself
[15:14] god will exalt
[15:15] you have got to get little before you
[15:18] can get big
[15:19] and you will never be big in your own
[15:21] self you will be only as big as god will
[15:24] be big in you
[15:26] how could we give the lord a shout
[15:29] on that one
[15:32] and this is from says this is the time
[15:34] this is a sign of the answer now i do
[15:37] not believe that there is anything that
[15:38] he has spoken all these years of my life
[15:42] that i have spoke to the people but what
[15:44] come to pass
[15:46] now many people have come with dreams
[15:48] and he would let me by his grace
[15:50] interpret for the people
[15:52] many has come with dreams and with
[15:54] problems that i was unable to interpret
[15:58] and i haven't tried to introduce to you
[16:01] people a gimmick
[16:03] that has all the answers
[16:05] i'll try to be honest
[16:07] to tell you what was truth
[16:09] and i could only tell you
[16:12] as he told me
[16:14] and then as it come to me i could tell
[16:16] you
[16:17] and i want to warn you
[16:20] in this day that we are living in
[16:23] not saying anything against people but
[16:25] when you see a man
[16:26] when you see a person that's got and the
[16:28] answer to everything that's contrary to
[16:30] the word
[16:34] the amen song enlighten that one
[16:37] i want it to be clear this is not
[16:39] gimmick thing we we have all the answers
[16:41] no no no no i want to warn you he said
[16:44] when you see a person that got the
[16:47] answer to everything
[16:48] that is contrary
[16:51] to
[16:52] the word
[16:54] jesus said there were many lepers in the
[16:56] days of elijah
[16:58] but only one was healed
[17:00] in the many years the eighth year more
[17:02] that elijah lived one leper was healed
[17:05] many windows in the days of elijah he
[17:08] was only center one
[17:09] and we find out that there are many
[17:11] things that god does
[17:13] that he doesn't
[17:14] reveal to his servants
[17:18] i'm not hearing you
[17:19] i want to hear a bigger iman than that
[17:22] many thing that god does
[17:25] that he does not reveal to his servant
[17:27] and no servant is greater than his lord
[17:34] and god will not share his glory with
[17:37] nobody
[17:40] he is god
[17:42] oh give the lord a shout in the house
[17:47] and when a servant comes to a place he
[17:50] tries to take the place of god
[17:52] something that will do that you know the
[17:54] plain god
[17:55] then god takes his life and moves him
[17:57] away somewhere or something we must
[17:59] remember that
[18:00] so i trust that these few things will
[18:02] edify you because that's what you're
[18:03] kept here for
[18:05] and defy you and we could be judged by
[18:07] the word
[18:08] because every gift going to be judged
[18:10] every man is going to be judged all of
[18:12] us going to be judged by the word
[18:15] oh hallelujah so we're not trying to
[18:17] compare ourselves with william branham
[18:19] and his experience like years ago there
[18:21] was a brother used to preach all kind of
[18:22] things he was sitting and preach preach
[18:24] for two hours not preach really talk
[18:26] talk they were talkers in those days
[18:28] and he said brother branham uh
[18:31] melt a cigarette pack
[18:33] and a forest and pressure man called
[18:35] thinking man's filter so he can meet a
[18:37] fan he can meet a
[18:39] box of matches he could meet anything
[18:41] and be assuming from that so all of them
[18:43] playing mini profit they could just take
[18:45] a word and get an experience and talk
[18:48] and talk and talk and talk and talk
[18:50] so you find out
[18:52] that i am not interested in those side
[18:54] shows i call them those experiences that
[18:56] belong to brother branham and here's why
[18:59] you have to look at listen carefully not
[19:02] so much the prophet you know but the
[19:04] prophet's prophecy
[19:07] let me say that again
[19:09] not the prophet
[19:10] but the prophet's prophecy you see the
[19:13] prophecy said that they would stagger
[19:16] with and have on a lips staggering lips
[19:19] and tongues and so the prophecy said
[19:20] that now if you're watching jesus you
[19:22] can say jesus never stagger jesus ever
[19:24] speak in tongues and and fall along in
[19:26] the upper room and no no so you're
[19:28] watching jesus but you're not watching
[19:29] the prophecy
[19:30] what jesus fulfilled was his prophecy
[19:33] what is for you is
[19:35] your prophecy so you have to understand
[19:38] that the scriptures prophesy certain
[19:41] things to be fulfilled
[19:42] so it didn't prophesy we would be like
[19:44] brother branham have a hat and go and
[19:46] hunt and so on i'm not living in that
[19:48] kind of area and so on there's a
[19:50] scripture for you to be fulfilled isn't
[19:51] that right so you don't watch the just
[19:53] the prophet but you're what the
[19:54] prophet's prophecy what is to be here
[19:56] for this time look how much that mockery
[19:58] of brother branham for prophesying about
[20:00] the car shaped like an egg that you
[20:02] don't need steering wheel and it was
[20:04] controlled by some power look at all
[20:05] their muck and make fun and look how
[20:07] they have it right now at his normal
[20:08] normal normal normal but he said before
[20:10] the end science will increase so
[20:12] powerfully that they will create the car
[20:14] that don't need a steering wheel he saw
[20:16] people sitting in it and they were
[20:18] playing cars or playing games and
[20:19] whatnot and it was taking them to the
[20:21] destination but that's what they have
[20:22] now that's what they're coming up with
[20:24] now why we are nearing the end
[20:27] praise god he said before the end this
[20:29] is supposed to happen when we see it
[20:31] coming in front of us but nearing the
[20:33] end then there gonna be a bright revival
[20:35] why we are nearing him there's gonna be
[20:38] a super church of super race one we are
[20:40] nearing the end when the power of this
[20:42] church rises it will bring the brethren
[20:44] that we can hear in the end praise god
[20:46] may not feeling for fear we are near in
[20:49] the end russia coming in position we are
[20:51] nearing the end praise god hallelujah
[20:53] the power is moving in the church we are
[20:55] nearing the end the anointing going to
[20:57] get greater and greater move higher and
[20:59] higher why we are nearing the end
[21:02] there's got to be a people prepared why
[21:04] we are nearing the end god can't leave

[24:11] his mechanical dynamics
[24:13] that woman with a blood issue she told
[24:15] herself
[24:16] so my problems she first problem she had
[24:18] was a husband
[24:20] husband didn't want to go to that small
[24:22] church
[24:23] husband didn't want to hear that
[24:24] preacher called jesus making rap as it
[24:26] was on the outside of jerusalem
[24:28] but she pressed away
[24:30] husband didn't want to give enough money

[24:34] husband trying to discourage her you're
[24:35] not going to make it you're all dead
[24:38] you will die
[24:40] but she pressed
[24:42] oh wait the journey was hard because she
[24:43] had a bloody issue
[24:46] the ride was rough but she had a blood
[24:48] issue
[24:49] but that didn't stop her
[24:52] hallelujah because she was going
[24:53] somewhere
[24:55] she was getting somewhere she had a
[24:57] choice to stay home and die
[24:59] or move forward in faith
[25:01] to a man of god that was standing here
[25:04] she decided to move in faith
[25:07] hallelujah she told herself i don't want
[25:10] to waste my time going to church sitting
[25:13] in a pew somebody's got to tell yourself
[25:15] something she told herself he's like to
[25:17] just touch the helm of his gun and i
[25:19] know have you made all that he made
[25:21] whole i mean she told herself something
[25:23] you got to speak to yourself
[25:26] praise god when god is not even talking
[25:28] to you say something to yourself
[25:31] [Applause]
[25:34] oh give the lord a shout is there any
[25:36] shelters in your house

[25:40] breakthrough today i'm gonna be healed
[25:42] today i'm gonna get a victory today i'm
[25:45] gonna raise above depression today i'm
[25:47] going to press out
[25:49] break out
[25:50] strike out
[25:52] today
[26:01] she didn't cater for the crowd
[26:06] and god will arrange it a lot of things
[26:07] that confront you and that you meet you
[26:09] you ain't cater for
[26:12] because some of you like to have your
[26:13] own way
[26:14] and you never
[26:15] cater for the opposition to how you
[26:17] think
[26:18] how you feel how you see it
[26:20] all you care is for you because you're
[26:22] selfish and it's all about you what you
[26:24] like what you want what you choose what
[26:26] you feel you're supposed to have how
[26:27] it's supposed to be it's all about you
[26:30] but with that woman she told herself
[26:33] if i
[26:35] could touch
[26:37] not if i send a letter out requesting a
[26:40] prayer request or doing that no if i
[26:42] could touch
[26:43] that means she had to get up from where
[26:45] she was
[26:47] she had to make movements to go with her
[26:49] testimony if i could touch she could
[26:52] knock somebody touch him for me touch
[26:53] him for me that's not working if i could
[26:56] touch what do you tell yourself this
[26:57] morning
[27:01] i'm the first
[27:03] hedgehog was the people big men strong
[27:06] men spiritual men men looking super
[27:08] spiritual dead men walking dead
[27:12] living the dead woman
[27:14] all types surrounding jesus part of the
[27:16] crowd set
[27:17] and god arranged like a backdrop of what
[27:20] are you going to do
[27:22] when you are determined
[27:23] when you are desperate
[27:25] and when you know this is your last
[27:27] ticket
[27:28] to get out
[27:29] of what you're in what you're going to
[27:30] do
[27:31] she pressed away
[27:33] i guess the first time it had to be
[27:34] rough to say somebody excuse me
[27:37] i have a mission
[27:38] to get the excuse me how to be rough to
[27:41] pat your way you know because it can't
[27:42] be easy all that crowd there nobody up
[27:44] in the room is jesus talking about this
[27:46] man who raising dead healing sick
[27:48] breaking bread and multiplying it to
[27:50] everybody around jesus he's popular
[27:52] everybody is talking about this man
[27:54] called jesus and she is just one of them
[27:57] but she was not just one of them she was
[28:00] one of them with a fate that spoke to
[28:02] herself that i have to get where no man
[28:05] went before after touch when nobody
[28:07] touched before i have to make scriptures
[28:09] that's how she was she was different
[28:10] different she was going to break she was
[28:12] going to break the barrier she was going
[28:14] to break whatever opposition whatever
[28:16] hindrance that she wanted to break out
[28:20] you know the story she pressed
[28:22] and pressed and pushed went below legs
[28:26] went above roll over she got her dress
[28:29] dirty but when she finally got to jesus
[28:32] she touched
[28:34] she did what she said
[28:36] and if you told yourself this morning
[28:38] i'm here to praise god i'm here to
[28:40] worship i'm here to glorify god because
[28:43] the worshiper
[28:45] once purged

[31:04] chapter 5 i want to read from verse 1
[31:06] and i saw on the right hand of him that
[31:08] satan had thrown a book written within
[31:10] and on the backside c with seven seals
[31:13] and i saw a strong angel proclaim with a
[31:14] lord voice who is worthy to open the
[31:16] book
[31:17] until lucas sees thereof
[31:19] and no one in heaven knowing it neither
[31:21] under the earth was able to open the
[31:23] book needed to look there on and i wept
[31:25] much because no one was found worthy to
[31:27] open and to read a book needed to look
[31:29] there on and
[31:30] and one of the elders said unto me reap
[31:32] not behold the land and the tribe of
[31:33] judah the root of david had prevailed to
[31:36] open the book and to loose the seven
[31:37] seas thereof and i beheld them low in
[31:39] the midst of the throne and the four
[31:41] beasts in the midst of the eldest to the
[31:42] lamb i had been slain having seven horns
[31:45] and seven eyes which are the seven
[31:46] spirits of god sent forth into all the
[31:48] earth and he came and took the book out
[31:51] of the right hand of him that sat upon
[31:52] the throne when he had taken the book
[31:54] the four beasts the four and twenty
[31:56] elders fell down before the lamb
[31:58] having every one of them harps and
[32:00] golden fires full of odors which are the
[32:02] prayers of the saints and they sung a
[32:04] new song saying that what woody to take
[32:06] the book and to open the seas thereof
[32:09] for door was slain and has redeemed us
[32:11] to god by thy blood out of every kindred

[34:47] church hallelujah together people
[34:49] prepared for his coming
[34:50] are you with me
[34:52] for they willingly are ignorant
[34:54] of that by the word of god the heavens
[34:56] were of old
[34:57] and the earth standing out of the water
[34:59] and in the water whereby the world that
[35:02] then was overflowed with water perished
[35:05] but the heavens and the earth are known
[35:07] by the same word
[35:08] are kept
[35:10] in store reserved unto fire
[35:14] against the day of judgment
[35:16] and peridition of ungodly men
[35:19] but beloved be not ignorant of this one
[35:22] thing
[35:22] that one day is with the lord of the
[35:24] thousand years and a thousand years as
[35:26] one day the lord here we go is not slack
[35:29] concerning his promise
[35:32] as some men count sadness but is
[35:34] long-suffering
[35:36] to us what not willing that any should
[35:38] perish but it all should come to
[35:40] repentance
[35:42] so right now we're under the long
[35:43] suffering of god
[35:45] that the voice of god to god with one
[35:47] more ride
[35:48] one more voice of mercy once more blood
[35:50] speaking from off the altar
[35:52] hallelujah the voice of god to go out to
[35:55] your loved ones to your family it's the
[35:57] mercies of god so don't talk about all
[35:59] dreaded is how dark it is how sinful it
[36:02] is thank god for his mercy
[36:05] i'm mr darkness
[36:07] i'm missing being dread
[36:08] i miss cross darkness covering the
[36:10] people
[36:11] there's a light that's still shining
[36:13] there's a blood walk that we have to
[36:15] walk
[36:16] oh could we give the lord some praises
[36:18] people
[36:19] oh
[36:19] hallelujah hallelujah
[36:22] hallelujah
[36:24] but the day of the lord will come
[36:27] as a thief in the night
[36:29] in which the heavens shall pass away
[36:30] with a great noise
[36:32] and the elements shall melt with fervent
[36:34] heat the earth also the works that are
[36:37] therein shall be burnt up
[36:38] seeing them
[36:40] that all these things shall be dissolved
[36:48] what manner of persons ought to be
[36:51] in all holy conversation and godliness
[36:54] looking for adhesion unto the coming of
[36:56] the day of god
[36:58] wherein the heavens being on fire shall
[37:00] be dissolved
[37:01] and the elements shall melt with food
[37:03] and heat nevertheless we according to
[37:05] his promise look for new heavens
[37:08] come on now let me hear the amen shall
[37:10] we now
[37:11] a new heaven and you hear where it dwell
[37:13] at righteousness
[37:15] wherefore beloved seeing you look for
[37:16] such things be diligent that you may be
[37:19] found of him in peace without spot and
[37:23] blameless
[37:24] an account that long suffering of our
[37:26] lord is salvation he must all be loved
[37:29] by the paul also according to the wisdom
[37:31] given unto him had written unto you
[37:34] and also in all his epistles speaking in
[37:36] them of these things in which some
[37:38] things had to be understood
[37:40] which they that are unlearned and
[37:42] unstable rest as they do also the other
[37:46] scriptures unto their own destruction
[37:49] therefore beloved seen you know these
[37:51] things before beware lest he also being
[37:55] led away with the error of the wicked
[37:57] fall away from your own steadfastness
[38:00] but growing grace the knowledge of our
[38:02] lord and savior jesus christ to him be
[38:04] glory and honor no forever and ever amen
[38:08] oh blessed could we give the lord and
[38:09] praise these people
[38:12] ah
[38:13] hallelujah
[38:15] oh glory to god
[38:16] so when adam fell
[38:19] he didn't lost just his eternal life
[38:22] he lost his inheritance in that eternal
[38:25] life
[38:26] god was god over the universe
[38:29] adam was a god of the earth isn't that
[38:31] right
[38:32] and we are promised
[38:34] a double portion
[38:36] isn't that right
[38:37] not only the baptism but there's a down
[38:39] payment but a baptism to change our
[38:42] mortal bodies
[38:44] isn't that right
[38:45] because god is not only redeeming your
[38:47] soul
[38:48] and your spirit he has to also redeem
[38:51] your body also
[38:52] romans 8 said but not we not only day
[38:55] but we ourselves have the first fruit of
[38:57] the spirit
[38:58] we ourselves grown within ourselves
[39:01] waiting for the adoption to with the
[39:04] redemption of the body
[39:07] hallelujah so there's a spiritual
[39:09] adoption and there's a physical adoption
[39:12] we have to come to the physical adoption
[39:14] but before the physical adoption there
[39:16] will be a spiritual adoption where god
[39:17] could take his sons and said listen hear
[39:19] him
[39:20] my life is in him
[39:22] my voice is in him my virtues is in him
[39:25] my blood flows to him hear he him
[39:29] oh glory to god you understand what god
[39:32] will do his hour
[39:33] god gonna find some born sons
[39:36] some phil sons some tested cells some
[39:39] tried sons he sent them to the grinder
[39:42] he send them through hell and they come
[39:44] out he send them to half prison they
[39:46] come true
[39:47] hallelujah praise god all kind of child
[39:50] intestines but they're going to come on
[39:52] victorious because god promised that
[39:54] kind of sun in the last days
[39:56] not no church warm plants no no no no no
[39:59] rugged sons
[40:01] god sees sons sons that won't give up
[40:04] sons that wouldn't let go
[40:06] sons that are steadfast
[40:08] overcoming sons victorious sons
[40:12] sealed sons
[40:13] redeemed sons
[40:15] adopted sons in the last days
[40:18] oh
[40:19] hallelujah are you looking for it
[40:21] are you an expectation for it not dying
[40:24] sons fallen sons failing sons but sons
[40:27] that belong to joyous army
[40:32] hallelujah mighty men of god
[40:35] oh give the lord some praises people
[40:38] hallelujah
[40:39] glory to god
[40:41] may be seated so let's get down now
[40:43] let's get on into the harness
[40:45] israel in the church
[40:46] but abandon says
[40:48] watch
[40:49] if we can't have faith for divine
[40:52] healing
[40:53] how are we going to have rapture and
[40:55] faith
[40:58] that alone
[41:00] should shake up this entire message
[41:02] world
[41:03] if we can't have a healing campaign if
[41:06] you can't have faith for divine healing
[41:07] wait homer rapture have no rapture
[41:09] coming when there's no divine healing it
[41:11] has to have divine healing you're going
[41:13] to find out what that is all about it's
[41:15] not by chance it's not like praying for
[41:16] the sick and we are pentecostals and no
[41:18] no no not
[41:20] it's a program of god
[41:22] because the rapture is actually a
[41:24] glorified healing
[41:26] mortal potential immortality corruption
[41:28] putting on incorruption
[41:30] [Applause]
[41:32] so healing is the illness of the rapture
[41:34] don't payment
[41:36] that if god could take our whole liver
[41:38] and make a new liver you don't hear what
[41:39] i'm saying it's got to take our whole
[41:41] heart and give you
[41:42] and quality cancer and yourself and if
[41:44] god can take your female problem and
[41:46] dissolve
[41:49] [Applause]
[41:54] my
[41:55] god if god could take your blind eye and
[41:57] pop that open and give you a new prayer
[41:59] eyes new kidneys god could give you a
[42:01] new job born god could whatever he is
[42:03] god i am that i am whatever you have
[42:06] need of that is what i am that's what we
[42:08] are talking about
[42:09] [Applause]
[42:13] you may be
[42:14] seated i want to write off not from from
[42:17] now on i have no death church i'm going
[42:19] to know rapture
[42:20] you have no we believe in message we're
[42:22] going to rapture i don't have that you
[42:24] have rapture and faith
[42:25] it's not going to take you into the
[42:26] rapture not just faith
[42:29] you're not hearing what i'm saying
[42:32] you have a term for the faith to take
[42:33] you there
[42:35] you have a currency to take care there
[42:37] never certain money to take care there
[42:39] it's called rapture and faith that's
[42:41] what you come to church to get

[43:10] we can't eat my faith for divine healing
[43:12] let alone wrapped in faith you've got to
[43:14] have faith that will change and quicken
[43:17] this body and be taken away and i
[43:19] believe there's a church on this road

[49:03] god talked to moses
[49:05] he said i believe that the age has come
[49:07] now
[49:08] the miraculous
[49:10] the phenomena
[49:12] the baptism of the spirit notice he
[49:13] didn't say mysteries more word more
[49:16] knowledge more information more deeper
[49:18] mysteries hidden mysteries mystery
[49:19] mysteries
[49:21] the mysterious hidden mysteries
[49:23] the mysterious mysterious mysteries they
[49:25] go like that mysterious mysterious
[49:27] mysterious mysterious hidden
[49:30] flip it all the way around
[49:33] do i know
[49:39] because some of them guess so i don't
[49:40] know they just they're making their own
[49:42] mysteries off
[49:45] they making go like a puzzle
[49:48] that like catholic church long time they
[49:50] take the whole whole thing in latin
[49:52] everybody clueless
[49:54] sick followers
[50:03] they speak in tongues for the whole
[50:04] service
[50:05] they talk in latin
[50:07] people don't know latin only priest do
[50:09] not listen to me and think drinking his
[50:10] own wine and so let's give you a little
[50:12] thing and then dice it
[50:14] a new home you're good for the day but
[50:15] that's what the preacher is doing right
[50:16] now they're talking latin
[50:19] a latin mystery and latin language
[50:21] unknown language
[50:24] it's so mysterious the people don't live
[50:25] nothing they say boy there's a man
[50:29] that is my man like my pastor as if god
[50:32] said truly passively rapture but ram
[50:34] said this message and teaching calling
[50:36] such a perfect man is the man that gonna
[50:38] be redeemed at the end of the seven
[50:40] season this is a message that ties the
[50:42] man that's going to be redeemed those
[50:44] virtues must be in the man the man can't
[50:47] comment in here virtues anybody can say
[50:49] that
[50:49] they have all said let me test at this
[50:51] one
[50:56] we have seven virtues okay let's test it
[50:59] you're frightened
[51:01] you can have all these virtues and
[51:03] frighten afraid
[51:05] all i want to see is the test of
[51:06] forgiveness
[51:08] is all i want to see
[51:10] you forgive me
[51:14] that's all i want to know
[51:16] because if you forgive me you would love
[51:17] me
[51:19] i show to your lovable
[51:21] oh come on give them some praises people
[51:24] feel like dancing
[51:25] feel like shouting
[51:27] feel like praising god
[51:29] you can't tell me your virtues you can't
[51:31] forgive
[51:32] you're not case
[51:34] that makes no sense because that is what
[51:37] this age is about
[51:39] brotherly kindness because faith is
[51:41] based on forgiveness what a mighty god
[51:44] we serve he make sure you can't have
[51:46] faith until you could forgive
[51:49] so people could do whatever they want to
[51:50] do
[51:51] don't let it stick on you to hold an
[51:54] earth or a grudge give the lord a shout
[51:56] in the house
[51:57] [Applause]
[52:02] the test is not for them that's when
[52:04] you're making excuses heeded me and
[52:06] ceded me and some excuse that's you
[52:08] making excuses the test is on you
[52:11] see if you would let it go
[52:14] to see if you will forgive because when
[52:16] you break that song barrier of
[52:17] unforgiveness when you break that salary
[52:19] and you can't forgive you know a
[52:21] different room altogether in a realm of
[52:23] communication with god
[52:25] then your communication restored back to
[52:27] god
[52:28] isn't that right no you could speak to
[52:29] the mountain then you could speak to the
[52:31] rock because you have a basis of faith
[52:33] to approach god a faith without fear
[52:36] faith or condemnation afraid of ruling
[52:38] anybody ought
[52:39] o hallelujah
[52:41] so i believe the phenomena the baptism
[52:43] of the spirit power signs and wonders
[52:45] this great pouring of god's spirit in
[52:48] the last days that's the thing
[52:50] that will bring faith
[52:53] into the people that will take a
[52:55] rapturing fate that will take the church
[52:58] into glory i believe it amen what is
[53:01] going to bring it great
[53:03] outpouring of the spirit
[53:05] not great explanation of mighty gifted
[53:08] preachers or teachers
[53:12] when they hear somebody preaching
[53:14] our teacher will come and said you're no
[53:16] christian that's convicted sinner
[53:18] but teaching this position he plays
[53:20] demand
[53:21] so the position he plays the people last
[53:22] 50 years
[53:25] if the teachers are right in that
[53:27] context then the people have been
[53:29] kneeled into position
[53:32] that's why they can't move
[53:34] that's why they call praise that's why
[53:36] they can't get a breakthrough because
[53:38] they get nailed
[53:39] by teachers near them down
[53:41] they know everything but they can always
[53:43] worship god god is the object of worship
[53:45] what god you're talking about
[53:46] how you could be serving god in account
[53:48] worship
[53:50] [Music]
[53:52] we don't emphasize worship enough
[53:55] i am not talking worship because i have
[53:57] nothing to preach i'm talking worship
[53:59] because you need to do that
[54:05] i'm not here to pray worship worship
[54:07] because i have nothing to preach
[54:09] you need to do that
[54:11] [Applause]
[54:14] and i'm gonna tell you when you need to
[54:15] do that you need to do that when you're
[54:17] not feeling good
[54:18] you need to do that when things are
[54:20] working out nice you need to do that
[54:21] when you're feeling real messed up if we
[54:23] don't do that when you're feeling out
[54:25] the tune
[54:28] and the problems in your house
[54:30] [Applause]
[54:45] god do we need lotto
[54:48] it's not because of god
[54:50] the feeling charged by money
[54:54] they're smiling from air to air
[54:56] but if you're getting an accident or
[54:58] something house building down or
[55:00] something happen dread and you come in
[55:01] here smiling and worshiping and blessing
[55:03] god
[55:04] you'll have people just shaking their
[55:06] heads
[55:08] you know who will be shaking their head
[55:09] the devil number one he'll be
[55:12] people say i just don't get it
[55:14] i frustrate them
[55:16] i make the man bounce the car i
[55:20] and they still come back
[55:22] let me just leave that greedy man alone
[55:24] [Applause]
[55:25] let me just leave that son and daughter
[55:28] we need to give the devil some headaches
[55:34] it against him
[55:35] when he expected to don't look don't
[55:37] look up
[55:38] when he expected to cry shout and give
[55:41] for joy
[55:42] when you say you're barren rejoicing
[55:44] barren
[55:45] the bible set the baron to rejoice
[55:49] [Applause]
[55:52] y'all know virtue of nobody
[55:55] you're looking for charge from everybody
[55:56] else

[56:12] would it encourage your body all that is
[56:14] foolishness

[56:17] that's your feeling but when you take
[56:19] that off

[56:43] they're not doing it and that's what you
[56:44] said they will not do it and they're
[56:45] doing it
[56:46] you could still know the father as well
[56:47] you could be a disobedient son it's not
[56:49] that you don't know what the father want
[56:51] it's just you not obeying what the

[58:35] pleased and blessed to dress right

[58:56] they head high
[58:58] they're loaded with information and
[59:00] they'll see the people out to drop it on
[59:02] them
[59:03] i wanted people dropping them to drop on
[59:04] them that they can't move three hours
[59:06] paralyzed
[59:08] by words from master teachers
[59:11] man that could craft and make them see
[59:13] what even out there
[59:15] them fellas like magicians you know
[59:17] there's tricks and friction
[59:19] i call that verbal gymnastics but jesus

[59:24] the promise of the father tarry in
[59:26] jerusalem until they received the
[59:28] promise of the holy ghost
[59:30] he was pointing them to something
[59:33] he wasn't just informing them informing
[59:34] them you open their own to the
[59:36] scriptures but if they understand it
[59:38] open is that somebody close it back up
[59:39] or it's still open right is either the
[59:42] sign open is that you open the word or

[1:02:10] when the power
[1:02:12] somebody showed power
[1:02:14] somebody shall power
[1:02:15] when the power of this church rises it
[1:02:18] will bring the brethren
[1:02:20] a lot of prejudice coming
[1:02:22] until the power comes in
[1:02:24] [Applause]
[1:02:29] did you hear that
[1:02:30] a lot of pressure not coming until the
[1:02:33] power comes in

[1:03:16] [Applause]
[1:03:28] right now the argument is on doctrine
[1:03:31] and teachings

[1:03:38] everybody know the man was lame

[1:04:16] [Applause]
[1:04:26] that's a sign
[1:04:27] of the resurrection
[1:04:29] a sign of rapturing fate
[1:04:31] a sign
[1:04:32] a man crippled for so long and they
[1:04:34] could say rise up and walk
[1:04:36] rise up and walk
[1:04:37] and the man does having to leap and jump
[1:04:40] leap and jump
[1:04:42] not walk like you want to go and sit
[1:04:43] down they get to get more coins nowhere
[1:04:45] to go to work because you could walk now
[1:04:47] you can't no excuse now you can't go on
[1:04:49] bed now because you could walk now jesus
[1:04:52] made your hole
[1:04:53] now watch something now when people see
[1:04:56] that it's not a wonder glorified paterno
[1:04:58] remember what we said this morning as
[1:04:59] soon as a man gets something a little
[1:05:00] thing you want to be a little god peace
[1:05:03] at the experience you think by my
[1:05:04] holiness this might make all i am peter
[1:05:07] the one who denies jesus is the same one
[1:05:10] who cares
[1:05:11] that's me
[1:05:12] but you see this man here it's by faith
[1:05:15] in jesus name
[1:05:16] is this manhole here
[1:05:18] it's me same peter
[1:05:20] but this jesus
[1:05:21] you don't know what i'm saying it's the
[1:05:23] holy ghost
[1:05:25] it's the spirit
[1:05:26] that that man is made all right don't
[1:05:28] put it with me peter i am full of force
[1:05:31] and mistake but this jesus
[1:05:33] you hear what i'm saying
[1:05:36] [Applause]
[1:05:49] a that was a shaker for the fire season
[1:05:51] because the churches were intact
[1:05:53] unt until the avengers died there was
[1:05:55] jews
[1:05:59] maybe season
[1:06:01] when jesus died they were they fought a
[1:06:03] sigh relief boy
[1:06:04] judas was part of the plan to give him
[1:06:06] so much sylvester between christ and
[1:06:08] everything everything set along now
[1:06:09] afterwards they said jesus recently dead
[1:06:11] but they see no evidence because you
[1:06:12] just have private ministry going on
[1:06:13] didn't know what going on that's just
[1:06:15] among the disciples and elected they
[1:06:16] don't know anything else but when you
[1:06:18] see jesus begin to come from the inside
[1:06:21] to come on the outside to give a
[1:06:23] demonstration of the hidden power that
[1:06:26] the pillar fire brought in the upper
[1:06:28] room when that jesus that they can't see
[1:06:31] that touch when that fire that's on the
[1:06:34] inside begin to express itself on the
[1:06:36] outside
[1:06:37] in signs in wonders in miracles in the
[1:06:41] power of god when that begins to happen
[1:06:44] then the devil have to take note
[1:06:46] pharisees have to take note status is
[1:06:48] under that note the message won't have
[1:06:50] to take note the hypocrites have to take
[1:06:52] note the backfires have to take note
[1:06:55] that they have been with jesus

[1:10:13] tenors to get the bride together for

[1:11:20] because what we have
[1:11:22] we won't be able to do it
[1:11:24] there's something got a step further we
[1:11:26] can't
[1:11:27] have enough faith for divine healing
[1:11:30] hardly
[1:11:31] we have got to
[1:11:32] get enough faith to be changed in a
[1:11:34] moment and be swept off the earth and we
[1:11:37] will find after a while where it is
[1:11:39] written
[1:11:40] what is he saying
[1:11:42] there must come a time where divine
[1:11:43] healing become preeminent in the church
[1:11:48] listen to this from once more lord we
[1:11:50] got members but they're weak
[1:11:52] they love the things of the world better
[1:11:53] than they do the things of god
[1:11:55] look upon the churches and find out
[1:11:57] don't try to deny it i'm reading
[1:12:00] don't think it's i saying these things
[1:12:01] yeah
[1:12:04] i'ma need you to finally cause the
[1:12:06] speech for me
[1:12:07] many people say i'm not a preacher that
[1:12:08] is true
[1:12:10] so i let it
[1:12:11] quote spiritually
[1:12:15] don't try to deny it your actions speak
[1:12:17] louder than your words you are big
[1:12:18] muscles but you won't meet the child you
[1:12:19] are the rapture and feature take the
[1:12:21] church out before judgments try to hear
[1:12:23] it
[1:12:24] numbers doesn't mean nothing i might
[1:12:26] have a thousand two thousand people in
[1:12:26] church
[1:12:27] what are these they raptured
[1:12:30] like two thousand then compete with pope
[1:12:31] francis
[1:12:33] pope are millions
[1:12:35] so it's not numbers
[1:12:36] it comes down to the faith
[1:12:39] isn't that right
[1:12:40] brethren the entire message i'll reveal
[1:12:42] it sixth fourth percent gabriel this is
[1:12:44] daniel there you are it shakes me to
[1:12:47] think the mystery the things that the
[1:12:49] church world bats their eyes and say
[1:12:50] it's nonsense the mystery of who jesus
[1:12:53] is not the third person not the second
[1:12:55] person not the third person but the
[1:12:56] person of god
[1:12:58] after all the other mysteries of god
[1:13:00] revealed because it's wrote in the book
[1:13:02] revealed to the end time generation they
[1:13:04] can no more seat in seminaries and
[1:13:05] schools and nominations no wonder they
[1:13:08] think you're crazy no wonder you think
[1:13:09] you're foolish no one that they can't
[1:13:11] understand why you don't clock up with
[1:13:12] them because here we go yeah because
[1:13:15] there's a power and a vision behind it
[1:13:18] a word of god
[1:13:20] that's been here we go revealed
[1:13:23] to get the church in order for the
[1:13:26] rapture
[1:13:27] under going home
[1:13:28] so all this revelation was supposed to
[1:13:31] get the church in order
[1:13:33] for the rapture
[1:13:35] for the coming of the lord
[1:13:37] isn't that right
[1:13:38] so this new heaven and you earth the
[1:13:40] bible talk about john say i saw a new
[1:13:41] heaven and a new earth peter talk about
[1:13:44] the fire reserved isn't that right to
[1:13:46] clean up the heavens and the earth
[1:13:48] what does it do there's some this is
[1:13:50] from our future home of the heavenly
[1:13:51] barrier these tissues and sickness and
[1:13:54] death and politics and sinful men watch
[1:13:56] and sinful women and evil spirits will
[1:13:58] be gone away and annihilated it has to
[1:14:00] be done away because we are going to
[1:14:02] live here we prove it by the bible what
[1:14:05] when the lamb took the book what did
[1:14:06] john said we
[1:14:07] shall reign on the earth so we are not
[1:14:10] angels so all of you are angels when
[1:14:12] you're dusting us when you go home you
[1:14:14] have to understand because you don't
[1:14:15] have that
[1:14:16] you fooling yourself thinking you are
[1:14:17] some angels we going to reign not in
[1:14:19] heaven on the earth
[1:14:21] so heaven is just part of where we going
[1:14:23] to come back
[1:14:24] so if we sleep we go so and then we come
[1:14:26] back so and we who here we have to have
[1:14:30] a different arrangement all together so
[1:14:32] god have arrangement for those who've
[1:14:33] gone on before and those who here we who
[1:14:35] are alive and remain
[1:14:36] that's what the bible designate us we
[1:14:38] who are alive and remain
[1:14:40] shall be caught up
[1:14:41] [Applause]
[1:14:44] hallelujah
[1:14:45] hallelujah there are those who have died
[1:14:48] and going on but we don't want we were
[1:14:49] alive and remain shall be caught up
[1:14:51] oh glory to god
[1:14:53] so watch praise god watch all our bodies
[1:14:57] that we live in now was put on the earth
[1:14:59] when god created it
[1:15:03] so when god said let there be earth he
[1:15:05] was saying let there be your bodies
[1:15:08] [Applause]
[1:15:10] i'm not hearing you give me a shout on
[1:15:11] that one
[1:15:13] when god made the earth he made your

[1:15:17] fall man out of the dust of the earth oh
[1:15:19] give the lord a shout do you see
[1:15:24] no feeling preaching no no
[1:15:26] no feeling like creature so when god

[1:15:30] speaking your body
[1:15:31] [Applause]
[1:15:36] you are a physical manifestation of the
[1:15:38] attribute that you are in god right now
[1:15:41] [Applause]
[1:15:48] that's why you have to get a new body
[1:15:50] because we don't have a new earth
[1:15:53] do you remember what i'm saying
[1:15:55] there's got to be a new earth

[1:20:46] glory glory
[1:20:48] hallelujah
[1:20:50] glory to god
[1:20:52] hallelujah you said satan is the ruler
[1:20:55] of the earth and its atmosphere you said
[1:20:57] atmosphere both heaven and earth you may
[1:20:59] be seated is now contaminated with
[1:21:01] devils
[1:21:02] that can accuse us before god
[1:21:06] jesus is dear to intercede for us
[1:21:09] while the accuser keep pointing a finger
[1:21:12] they did this they did this they did
[1:21:14] this but the blood still covers
[1:21:18] he came to redeem that elected that he
[1:21:21] foresaw
[1:21:22] that is why
[1:21:24] he said it's so filthy today now watch
[1:21:26] here's a human heart and he draw a heart
[1:21:29] inside of it there's a snake
[1:21:31] watch that is what make the sin
[1:21:34] the life this one over here has a dove
[1:21:36] in it so two hearts which is the holy
[1:21:38] spirit that has a life he has malice the
[1:21:41] one with snake have malice hatred envy
[1:21:44] that's what causing it is that fellow
[1:21:46] inside the deer that snake in the heart
[1:21:48] is inside of there now when you are
[1:21:50] asking to forgive you of your sins
[1:21:53] that
[1:21:54] has been forgiven and taken away but i
[1:21:56] think that court is still there so god
[1:21:58] forgive me for lying stealing robbing
[1:22:00] whatever god forgive you but the snake
[1:22:03] is still there
[1:22:05] that's justification god forgive you but
[1:22:07] the thing that causes you to do it is
[1:22:09] still there then comes sanctification
[1:22:11] watch sets our mind in order of holiness
[1:22:14] to think right sanification is a
[1:22:16] compound greek word which means a
[1:22:18] cleanse and set aside for service
[1:22:22] the next comes
[1:22:23] the baptism of fire
[1:22:26] and the holy ghost
[1:22:27] that god might dwell in us
[1:22:30] and the fire of god here we go
[1:22:33] cleanses our hearts
[1:22:35] from sin
[1:22:37] and puts the holy ghost inside
[1:22:41] then we bring forth the same life that
[1:22:43] they did back there
[1:22:45] notice he didn't say teachings he didn't
[1:22:48] say mysteries he didn't say the letter
[1:22:51] of the word he said the fire
[1:22:53] of god
[1:22:55] cleanses our hearts
[1:22:57] from sin
[1:22:59] isn't that right
[1:23:00] a man can repent of his sins or maybe
[1:23:02] he's a moral man every more looking
[1:23:04] woman he finds it's still there maybe
[1:23:06] he's a drunkard every time he smells
[1:23:07] that drink it is still there when he
[1:23:09] gets sanctified it cleanses that desire
[1:23:13] out of him
[1:23:14] it takes the want of it away he can
[1:23:17] still be tempted
[1:23:19] but it takes the want of it away
[1:23:22] but when he is baptized
[1:23:26] with the holy ghost on fire
[1:23:28] and the other words cleansed
[1:23:31] burnt out
[1:23:32] cleaned up
[1:23:33] and then put
[1:23:35] into the service of god
[1:23:37] because our standard direction means set
[1:23:40] aside
[1:23:41] for service
[1:23:43] but the holy ghost puts us in
[1:23:45] in
[1:23:46] service
[1:23:48] excuse me
[1:23:49] so look i was striking he takes the
[1:23:51] place where he had to dwell in through
[1:23:53] the same process he is called the church
[1:23:55] through justification call the church on
[1:23:56] vacation then fill it with the holy
[1:23:58] ghost and fire he took it to a process
[1:24:00] that he himself the holy spirit himself
[1:24:03] the son of god can dwell in it amen now
[1:24:08] watch
[1:24:09] a mystery
[1:24:11] what people did not know
[1:24:14] noah's day with water got judged by
[1:24:16] water and so on flood and so on it
[1:24:18] wasn't just that
[1:24:20] he was redeeming the earth
[1:24:23] by baptizing it in water
[1:24:27] so the mystery behind noah 128th year
[1:24:30] old prophecy
[1:24:32] and the ark and the flood was god saying
[1:24:35] i am taken back
[1:24:38] what is mines

[1:24:48] he was going to die to redeem everything
[1:24:52] everything that was lost so he baptized
[1:24:54] the earth and water
[1:24:56] when jesus died his blood sanctified the
[1:24:58] earth
[1:24:59] there's only one thing left fire
[1:25:03] fire
[1:25:05] fire
[1:25:06] and the same way
[1:25:08] he redeems the earth
[1:25:10] he redeems the individual
[1:25:12] you are justified that's why you get
[1:25:15] baptized in water
[1:25:16] you are sanctified
[1:25:18] by the blood
[1:25:20] and then god
[1:25:22] has to baptize it with fire

[1:28:29] redemption is used to redeem both the
[1:28:32] world and the persons that live in it

[1:28:38] in noah's day by blood in jesus day by
[1:28:41] fire that is yet to come and you have to
[1:28:44] redeem by the water by the blood and by

[1:30:37] of redemption he's the unchangeable god
[1:30:40] always the same in his plans now in the
[1:30:42] beginning was the word
[1:30:45] and the word was made flesh and dull
[1:30:47] among us
[1:30:48] three stages
[1:30:50] it was attribute first
[1:30:52] was in god
[1:30:53] and he thought of himself as a human
[1:30:55] being
[1:30:57] and that transmitted him down to be
[1:30:59] jesus
[1:31:01] no
[1:31:02] you will ever be
[1:31:03] there if you'll ever be dear
[1:31:06] you was with him then
[1:31:09] for there is only one form of eternal
[1:31:12] life and that's god
[1:31:14] and you had to be part of god at the
[1:31:16] beginning
[1:31:17] not what you choose down here
[1:31:20] he
[1:31:21] chose you
[1:31:24] that is enough to make everybody in the
[1:31:27] church

[1:32:22] to the other side you're surprised in
[1:32:24] the world on the other side

[1:32:28] people will be on the side the price on

[1:32:52] kick
[1:32:55] [Applause]
[1:33:03] now look at the priests here
[1:33:06] this is important the priest
[1:33:09] you want with the nice clothes
[1:33:11] fancy beard
[1:33:13] nice thing on top of his head
[1:33:14] looking very spiritual and so on
[1:33:16] smooth face looking very peaceful and so
[1:33:18] on calm and soothing words
[1:33:20] that is the priest
[1:33:23] the embarrassment going right down to
[1:33:24] his head
[1:33:26] i mean
[1:33:27] they have a designer for those garments
[1:33:28] in those days
[1:33:30] it wasn't normal garments you know
[1:33:32] that's the priest coming
[1:33:33] there's no ifs there's no buts
[1:33:35] but his real wear and walk his special
[1:33:38] sanders with the gold trimmings
[1:33:40] and his shoes
[1:33:42] tip
[1:33:43] that's the priest
[1:33:44] he's coming
[1:33:46] highly respected let's hear about him
[1:33:50] we find his bottom part here
[1:33:52] his back life behind him
[1:33:54] his predestination is sinful
[1:33:57] [Music]
[1:34:04] now look at this blackboard here
[1:34:07] he represent purity he was a priest he
[1:34:09] was an honorable man he said he had to
[1:34:11] be a good man or he couldn't be a priest
[1:34:14] you don't put bad men as priests
[1:34:17] mafia as priests
[1:34:19] gangster as priests that'll be at least
[1:34:21] a good man
[1:34:23] to be in the priesthood
[1:34:25] but but you see he gutted by
[1:34:27] intellectual learning
[1:34:29] that's the priest so he has no divine
[1:34:31] revelation he went and studied in the
[1:34:33] priesthood he knew how to be a priest
[1:34:35] how to sprinkle the thing lie the candle
[1:34:38] to the altar how to bless people and so
[1:34:40] on and as a ritual he's a priest
[1:34:43] look at the woman
[1:34:45] woman at the well
[1:34:47] her first life she was a prostitute
[1:34:50] she was all mad up
[1:34:52] but we're done in her
[1:34:55] watch watch i know when the messiah
[1:34:58] cometh notice when jesus came
[1:35:00] and manifested the word because the word
[1:35:02] is under torch watch
[1:35:05] watch what happened the priest
[1:35:07] with his intellectual learning said it's
[1:35:09] a devil
[1:35:11] so the priest called jesus the devil
[1:35:13] because that's what his denomination
[1:35:15] called it today is what the group say
[1:35:18] individuals in the group have no
[1:35:19] revelation they have a group revelation
[1:35:21] so however they passed a pedal in the
[1:35:23] head and mess up the head the whole
[1:35:25] church messed up like that so they have
[1:35:27] no individual life they have a
[1:35:29] collective life as dictated and
[1:35:31] promulgated by the pastor who is not a
[1:35:33] good shepherd who is a highland because
[1:35:36] the good shepherd is feeding sheep the
[1:35:38] word of god and don't put the pastor
[1:35:40] spirit on the people the good shepherd
[1:35:42] just put the holy ghost on the people
[1:35:45] the word that's what the good shepherd
[1:35:47] does a highland shepherd has to mess
[1:35:49] them up to attach the people to
[1:35:51] themselves
[1:35:52] [Applause]
[1:35:54] but we get our shout in the house
[1:35:57] are we preaching to the elected today
[1:36:00] all right you may be seated
[1:36:03] what happened this priest but only
[1:36:05] electoral learning said it's the devil
[1:36:07] because that's what the university
[1:36:09] called it what did he do
[1:36:10] he had no representation so it blocked
[1:36:12] him out right this little woman had
[1:36:15] nothing to present
[1:36:17] i like this
[1:36:18] she was filthy
[1:36:20] and dirty as she could be
[1:36:23] but she got representation
[1:36:27] [Applause]
[1:36:31] i could have been amanda
[1:36:33] i found your whole immaculate one
[1:36:36] i hope you're not a priest here
[1:36:38] [Music]
[1:36:44] this little woman had none the present
[1:36:45] she's filthy dirty as she could be but
[1:36:47] notice way down in her she got
[1:36:49] representation she was looking for this
[1:36:51] to be made flesh he said go get your
[1:36:53] husband and come here she's have none
[1:36:54] she said he said the truth because you
[1:36:55] have five and the one your label is not
[1:36:57] yours you had five that makes six your
[1:36:59] heart
[1:37:00] she said sir you're not basically
[1:37:03] i perceive you a prophet amen no more
[1:37:05] doubt
[1:37:06] you didn't have to explain it
[1:37:08] she saw it
[1:37:10] she believed it
[1:37:11] and where she went why what did it do to
[1:37:14] her it redeemed her
[1:37:17] so she went from black
[1:37:19] to white
[1:37:20] the priest went from white to black
[1:37:23] he was out because he had no
[1:37:25] representation but this woman who was a
[1:37:27] prostitute because she had
[1:37:29] representation she had predestination
[1:37:32] the hell that's what the redemption is
[1:37:34] about
[1:37:35] the redemption is about the
[1:37:36] predestination
[1:37:37] [Applause]
[1:37:40] it's not everybody
[1:37:42] he said all that the father had
[1:37:45] given me

[1:59:05] understand for the last 50 years the
[1:59:08] bride was nailed on by the word
[1:59:10] spirit of prophecy testimony of jesus
[1:59:13] the living word the word coming word by

[1:59:28] this is what the devil was that catering
[1:59:30] for he thought we were battered and
[1:59:32] bruised just between a long hard word
[1:59:34] battle but it's not so
[1:59:36] there's an appointed time
[1:59:38] i will return in today
[1:59:40] according to the time of life and you're
[1:59:42] going to have that son that's not talk
[1:59:44] now that's not 25 years saying i'm gonna
[1:59:46] have isaac no no no this is the time of
[1:59:48] life now there's a time to produce
[1:59:50] something oh glory to god when that egg
[1:59:53] hit that sperm that was a conception
[1:59:55] isaac was on his way he had nine months
[1:59:57] to him to comfort but he was on his way
[1:59:59] oh we have a right to rejoice because i
[2:00:02] feel that egg hit that swim
[2:00:04] is it just a matter of time now
[2:00:06] for that baby to come forth
[2:00:08] oh glory to god are you with me now
[2:00:10] hallelujah hallelujah
[2:00:13] glory to god glory to god
[2:00:15] hallelujah hallelujah
[2:00:17] glory glory so when a man is born again
[2:00:20] from heaven
[2:00:21] i'm going back up a little bit he's
[2:00:23] somebody a woman of our baby
[2:00:25] see how cruel she is
[2:00:26] she gets really kind
[2:00:28] what happened
[2:00:29] there's a body what this body now is not
[2:00:31] alive yet the only thing is flesh and
[2:00:33] muscles bumping
[2:00:35] and when the baby comes to the womb god
[2:00:37] breathes the breath of life into it and
[2:00:39] then it screams out so the natural body
[2:00:41] is formed and outside the womb there's a
[2:00:43] spirit life to hit that body
[2:00:46] and then you have a baby
[2:00:47] alive
[2:00:48] well the reverse is also true
[2:00:50] we are spirit babes
[2:00:52] in christ and outside of us have that
[2:00:55] body
[2:00:56] that if this body fall down we have a
[2:00:58] body to go into
[2:00:59] isn't that right say hey he's bringing
[2:01:01] it now when a man is born again from
[2:01:02] heaven he become a spirit babe in christ
[2:01:05] and when this robe of flesh is dropped
[2:01:07] there's a natural body teopany a body
[2:01:09] not made with hands
[2:01:11] need a bone of woman that we go into
[2:01:13] and then that body returns back and
[2:01:16] picks up the glory fight body
[2:01:18] that's the reason jesus went to hell
[2:01:20] when he died and preached his souls in
[2:01:22] prison he turned back into teopening
[2:01:24] and if
[2:01:25] corinthians 5 1 if this earthly body be
[2:01:28] dissolved
[2:01:29] this earthly tabernacle we have another
[2:01:32] one
[2:01:33] we have bypassed that to come straight
[2:01:35] from god the attribute to be flesh
[2:01:38] to be tempted and tested by sin
[2:01:40] aha so you bypass the attribute of god
[2:01:43] to be what
[2:01:44] test it and turn to my sin like adam did
[2:01:46] but when testing of his word is over
[2:01:50] when we are taken up into this body
[2:01:53] that was prepared for us before the
[2:01:55] foundation of the world
[2:01:56] it is the word there that we skipped
[2:01:59] to come right down to be tempted and
[2:02:01] tested
[2:02:02] and if we come through that
[2:02:04] there have been no temptation we would
[2:02:06] know all things the reason jesus knew
[2:02:09] all things he was worried because he
[2:02:12] before he was flesh
[2:02:14] and then we become the word
[2:02:17] and here we are to be formed to the word
[2:02:19] image
[2:02:20] to be a partaker of the word
[2:02:22] to feed on the word and being
[2:02:24] predestinated since the beginning you
[2:02:26] see a little spark of life that you had
[2:02:28] in you from the beginning when you
[2:02:30] started your journey many of you can
[2:02:32] remember it you joined church you tried
[2:02:34] this nothing satisfied but one day you
[2:02:36] just recognized it then after you
[2:02:38] recognized the very word of god was
[2:02:39] eager food then you left the other thing
[2:02:42] you have been formed into the living
[2:02:44] image of the living word you heard from
[2:02:45] your theophany if this earthly body be
[2:02:48] deserved we have one waiting
[2:02:51] when moses seen him he see them in a
[2:02:53] theophany when abraham saw him he saw
[2:02:55] his name he saw he called him elohim
[2:02:56] isn't that right he was in a theophany
[2:02:59] form notice therefore the theophany here
[2:03:02] we go
[2:03:05] are you ready
[2:03:06] everybody alive right now
[2:03:09] therefore if you have died
[2:03:14] and entered into that theophany what
[2:03:16] happens is something he's revealing here
[2:03:18] the theoretically comes to earth to pick
[2:03:20] up the redeemed body
[2:03:22] [Music]
[2:03:27] if you are here in the air you take the
[2:03:29] body to meet the theophany
[2:03:34] there you are
[2:03:35] you are caught up to meet the lord in
[2:03:36] the air
[2:03:38] so those that have died they have to
[2:03:40] come back for the reading body those
[2:03:42] that are here have to leave with the
[2:03:43] redeem body
[2:03:46] pick up the tea offering
[2:03:48] so we have to connect
[2:03:50] we will not hit the those that are
[2:03:52] asleep
[2:03:53] or give the lord a shout
[2:03:56] oh glory to god you come from god you're
[2:03:58] going right back to god
[2:04:00] isn't that right
[2:04:01] hallelujah
[2:04:03] know the world how did he read in the
[2:04:04] world first he did when it's sin he wash
[2:04:07] him with water baptism you drop his
[2:04:08] blood on it and then now he tore the
[2:04:10] world out of you and renovate the whole
[2:04:12] thing by the fiery baptism holy ghost
[2:04:14] which he will renovate the hood
[2:04:16] so watch it showed blindly
[2:04:19] the watch the natural british tree water
[2:04:21] then blood then spirit isn't that right
[2:04:24] what happened to a plant that rots this
[2:04:26] talk the tassel this is shocked then the
[2:04:28] grain comes out
[2:04:29] watch
[2:04:30] showing plainly
[2:04:32] are you ready
[2:04:33] the predestinated is the only one that
[2:04:35] is considered in redemption did you get
[2:04:38] that
[2:04:39] let me say that again the predestinated
[2:04:41] is the only one that is considered in
[2:04:44] redemption people might think they are
[2:04:46] making like they are
[2:04:48] but the real redemption is those that
[2:04:51] are predestinated because the very word
[2:04:53] redeem means to bring back to redeem is
[2:04:56] to bring back to its original
[2:04:58] bring
[2:04:59] back the original oh blessed be the name
[2:05:02] of the lord
