[55:42] I know what it's like
[55:49] to be in the presence of the Lord.
[55:57] and not know what time it is.
[56:05] Because time stood still
[56:10] [Music]
[56:12] and bodies were healed
[56:20] and families restored
[56:23] [Music]
[56:28] because we stayed here.
[56:35] In the presence of the Lord,
[56:43] no one had to say a word.
[56:50] Couldn't even make a sound.
[56:54] [Music]
[56:58] But I'd give up everything
[57:05] for this treure I found.
[57:13] I never want it to end.

[57:41] gold

[1:05:44] praise?
[1:05:47] Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:05:51] Worship him.
[1:05:53] Lift his name higher. He is worthy of
[1:05:56] the praise. From the rising of the sun
[1:05:59] to the going down of the same. His name
[1:06:02] is worthy.
[1:06:04] Oh hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:06:08] Hallelujah. Forget about your trials.
[1:06:11] Forget about your testings. Forget about
[1:06:14] your problems. He is God all by himself.
[1:06:18] Hallelujah. He woke us up this morning.
[1:06:21] We have a reason to shout. We have a
[1:06:23] reason to worship. We have a reason to
[1:06:26] say thank you, Jesus. Oh, hallelujah.
[1:06:32] Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:06:36] Blessed be the name of the Lord. Are you
[1:06:40] happy to be in the house of the Lord
[1:06:42] this morning?
[1:06:45] My my my my.
[1:06:48] You may be seated for a few minutes.
[1:06:52] Certainly want to greet you this morning
[1:06:54] in the precious name of our Lord and
[1:06:57] Savior Jesus Christ. And it's certainly
[1:07:00] a great privilege to be able to be in
[1:07:02] the house of God one more time. It's not
[1:07:05] something we ever take for granted. We
[1:07:08] know that the prophet taught us one day
[1:07:10] we'll have the last service.
[1:07:12] One day we'll preach the last message.
[1:07:15] But until that come that time comes, we
[1:07:17] want to do all that we can do for the
[1:07:19] glory of God. We want to redeem the time
[1:07:22] and put our shoulders to the wheel in
[1:07:25] this great season that we're living in.
[1:07:26] Knowing that time is short and we have a
[1:07:29] responsibility as the prophet taught us.
[1:07:31] He said, "What we see should put our
[1:07:33] souls into action to make a church that
[1:07:35] would make a revival." And I believe
[1:07:37] that we are part of that great vision
[1:07:40] that the prophet saw of a church coming
[1:07:42] into view, coming into step, and coming
[1:07:44] into a realization of who they are and
[1:07:46] more importantly who's they are. You
[1:07:49] didn't call yourself, you didn't choose
[1:07:50] yourself. God called you. And that is
[1:07:53] enough of a reason to shout because if
[1:07:55] you chose yourself, then you could let
[1:07:56] yourself go. But if God chose you, he is
[1:07:58] built a certain way. He's not going to
[1:08:00] let you go. He's not going to lose one.
[1:08:03] Hallelujah. God is not in the random
[1:08:05] picking business. God is not now
[1:08:07] deciding this morning to call you. You
[1:08:09] were called before there was a moon,
[1:08:11] before there was a molecule, before
[1:08:12] there was a star, before there was
[1:08:14] anything. Your name was put there and by
[1:08:16] his fornowledge, he could predestinate
[1:08:18] you to come to adoption, to come to
[1:08:21] perfection, and to live a life above
[1:08:23] sin, live a life above condemnation,
[1:08:25] live a life with a revelation that you
[1:08:27] are part of the vision of God. Can the
[1:08:29] church say amen? So, we are happy this
[1:08:32] morning. coming. You appreciate the
[1:08:33] service last night yesterday with our
[1:08:35] precious brother Jonathan Martin. God
[1:08:37] bless you, brother Jonathan. May God
[1:08:39] bless you richly and we are under great
[1:08:42] expectation for what God is about to do.
[1:08:45] We do want to acknowledge our precious
[1:08:47] brother Tim Redhead who's in the house
[1:08:49] this morning from Grenada. Brother Tim,
[1:08:51] God bless you
[1:08:53] from Grenada. And we were so blessed to
[1:08:56] have him minister last Wednesday night
[1:08:58] for us. And we want to let you know that
[1:09:03] God has more in store for us. He came to
[1:09:05] Trinidad to rest. And as the elder said,
[1:09:08] you have to labor
[1:09:12] to enter into that rest.
[1:09:15] So he has to labor even while he's here.
[1:09:18] So this coming Wednesday, it's a public
[1:09:20] holiday. So we're going to move the
[1:09:22] service a little earlier to 5:00 p.m.
[1:09:24] And he will labor to enter into his
[1:09:26] vocation. So he will be ministering on
[1:09:29] Wednesday by the grace of God. And this
[1:09:31] coming Sunday ahead of us, he will also
[1:09:33] be ministering to us. So his rest will
[1:09:36] be a well-deserved rest after having
[1:09:37] labored to enter into that rest. But
[1:09:40] brother Tim, God bless you. We
[1:09:41] appreciate you being here with us.
[1:09:45] Amen.
[1:09:46] By the grace of God. And we are excited
[1:09:48] to see what God is doing. You see,
[1:09:50] because I believe we have the devil on
[1:09:52] the ropes.
[1:09:53] &gt;&gt; And when you have the enemy on the
[1:09:54] ropes, you got to keep punching. We're
[1:09:56] not going to let him even get his head
[1:09:57] up. Because before we leave here, I
[1:10:00] always believe the bride isn't going to
[1:10:01] leave here saying we barely made it.
[1:10:03] We're going to leave here with our foot
[1:10:04] on the devil's neck. We're going to
[1:10:06] leave here pulling our children from the
[1:10:08] enemy. We're going to leave here and
[1:10:09] throw cancer back in the devil's face.
[1:10:12] Devil, take your arthritis. Take your
[1:10:14] high blood pressure. Take your doubt and
[1:10:16] unbelief. We are the bride of Jesus
[1:10:18] Christ. And we know who we are. We know
[1:10:21] where we come from and we know where we
[1:10:22] going. Can the church say amen? Glory.
[1:10:28] So, we have a preacher this morning, a
[1:10:30] mighty gift of God, and we are under
[1:10:32] great expectation. We have two services
[1:10:35] today, this service, and at 400 p.m. By
[1:10:39] the grace of God, we are looking to
[1:10:40] leave this place with a shout. Brother
[1:10:42] Jonathan came as a sign of a quick short
[1:10:44] message. He is going from church tonight
[1:10:46] to the airport.
[1:10:50] &gt;&gt; So, he's just here on a mission. And God
[1:10:51] sent a special Navy Seal operator,
[1:10:55] dropped him behind enemy lines,
[1:10:57] &gt;&gt; and he's going to soon the mission is
[1:10:58] over. He heads straight to the airport.
[1:11:00] Before the enemy look for him, he's
[1:11:01] already gone because that's the season
[1:11:03] we live in. But I believe that today
[1:11:05] some sons are going to go free. Some
[1:11:07] daughters are going to go free. Some
[1:11:09] sons are going to catch a revelation
[1:11:11] that this message is just as real as it
[1:11:13] was. That the Holy Ghost that fell on
[1:11:15] the day of Pentecost is just as real as
[1:11:17] it was. It's the same Holy Ghost. It's
[1:11:20] the same power. It's just as real then
[1:11:22] as it is is now. And God is going to
[1:11:24] raise up a mighty marching army. And by
[1:11:26] the grace of God this evening, we expect
[1:11:27] believers from the other churches to
[1:11:29] join us. So we are under great
[1:11:31] expectation for the move of God. Can the
[1:11:33] church say amen?
[1:11:37] So can we stand to our feet as we
[1:11:39] welcome God's servant to the platform?
[1:11:42] He wanted that song in the morning when
[1:11:44] I rise.
[1:11:46] Give me Jesus.
[1:11:50] In the morning
[1:11:52] when I rise
[1:11:55] in the morning.
[1:11:57] [Music]
[1:12:00] In the morning.
[1:12:04] Give me
[1:12:08] brother Jonathan.
[1:12:10] [Music]
[1:12:17] Jesus,
[1:12:18] [Music]
[1:12:20] you can have
[1:12:24] all this world.
[1:12:27] Give me Jesus.
[1:12:31] [Music]
[1:12:33] Give me Jesus.
[1:12:40] Give me Jesus.
[1:12:45] You can have
[1:12:48] all this world.
[1:12:52] Give me Jesus
[1:12:58] in the morning
[1:13:01] when I rise.
[1:13:05] In the morning
[1:13:08] when I rise.
[1:13:11] In the morning
[1:13:14] when I rise,
[1:13:18] give me Jesus.
[1:13:24] Oh, give me Jes.
[1:13:27] Give me Jesus.
[1:13:31] Give me Jesus.
[1:13:37] You can have
[1:13:41] all this world.
[1:13:45] Give me Jesus.
[1:13:49] One more time. Give me Jesus.
[1:13:54] I've got to have Jesus.
[1:13:58] Give me Jesus. Jesus,
[1:14:04] you can have
[1:14:08] all this world. Sing that again. You can
[1:14:13] have
[1:14:15] [Music]
[1:14:16] You
[1:14:19] can have
[1:14:22] all this world.
[1:14:26] Give me Jesus.
[1:14:30] [Music]
[1:14:36] Oh, that's what we're after.
[1:14:40] That's who we want
[1:14:43] more than anything the world could offer
[1:14:45] us.
[1:14:47] Satan can offer the kingdoms of this
[1:14:50] world.
[1:14:52] He still is in control. He's still the
[1:14:55] god of this evil age.
[1:14:57] But I'm so glad that Jesus, he didn't
[1:15:01] fall for Satan's trick. He knew that he
[1:15:03] had to redeem it. He knew that he had to
[1:15:06] pay the price with his own life, his own
[1:15:09] blood. And in doing so, he redeemed you
[1:15:12] and I.
[1:15:14] &gt;&gt; That we are not under Satan's rule any
[1:15:16] longer. We are not under his domain. We
[1:15:20] are not under his possession. But we
[1:15:23] belong to Jesus Christ.
[1:15:26] &gt;&gt; And we know that this world belongs to
[1:15:28] us. But we don't want it the way that it
[1:15:31] is now.
[1:15:32] &gt;&gt; We want it to be renovated with fire. A
[1:15:35] holy fire. All the demonic forces of
[1:15:38] hell just totally destroyed and
[1:15:40] annihilated
[1:15:42] just like God has done for you and I.
[1:15:45] He's justified us, sanctified us. He's
[1:15:48] burnt us up with holy fire. And one of
[1:15:52] these days, we're going to come back to
[1:15:54] a perfect Eden again. But in the
[1:15:57] meantime, we're following his word, his
[1:15:59] headship, and it's taking us back to
[1:16:01] that perfect Eden. I'm glad that I know
[1:16:04] what this message is about. I know I I'm
[1:16:08] glad that I know it's my identity. It's
[1:16:10] my headship. It's It's more than just a
[1:16:13] man. It's more than just a good idea.
[1:16:16] It's more than just a philosophy, but
[1:16:19] it's Jesus Christ. And he is leading his
[1:16:22] church. And he promised he'll never
[1:16:25] leave us. He'll never direct us the
[1:16:28] wrong path. But he's leading us step by
[1:16:31] step, word by word. And it's a perfect
[1:16:35] direction. As long as we stay true to
[1:16:38] the course, follow the word, follow his
[1:16:40] angel, it'll take us into our body
[1:16:43] change. Amen. And so we want to say what
[1:16:47] an honor it is to to be here again. And
[1:16:51] we uh we just uh just had a good time uh
[1:16:55] last night in the word and and uh in his
[1:16:58] presence and uh it is a uh it is a fast
[1:17:02] trip. Amen. Uh we're going home and uh
[1:17:06] we got to get uh we got to get prepared
[1:17:08] for another trip that is coming up.
[1:17:11] we'll we'll be going to uh Pakistan and
[1:17:14] and uh so we definitely covet your your
[1:17:17] prayers uh for us there trying to just
[1:17:20] do something for the Lord and for the
[1:17:22] kingdom of God and and uh just to bring
[1:17:25] encouragement and you know we we we just
[1:17:29] have a desire to preach the message but
[1:17:33] but he's a living God
[1:17:35] &gt;&gt; and uh we still believe he's saving
[1:17:37] souls. He's still healing, delivering,
[1:17:41] filling with the Holy Ghost. We believe
[1:17:44] that it's a it's a great season that God
[1:17:48] is moving in his word and his spirit and
[1:17:52] blessing his people and and he's doing
[1:17:55] the exceedingly abundantly above all
[1:17:58] that we could even ask or even think.
[1:18:01] That's our God and that's the age that
[1:18:03] we're living in. And so uh again we
[1:18:06] appreciate uh brother oid and uh just
[1:18:10] for inviting us to come and uh you know
[1:18:14] uh it was great faith uh for your pastor
[1:18:17] to have have us come uh because he
[1:18:20] didn't know me and uh quite frankly uh I
[1:18:24] didn't know him and uh so but uh getting
[1:18:29] acquainted with brother Isaac there in
[1:18:31] Uganda and we just had uh some good
[1:18:34] fellowship and uh God just uh uh allowed
[1:18:38] this to come about and so you know our
[1:18:41] our heart is just to put our shoulder
[1:18:44] behind the wheel and and uh we're not
[1:18:47] bringing anything new but we just want
[1:18:50] to preach the message and uh we just
[1:18:52] want to want to preach the the faith
[1:18:54] that God has placed in our hearts and
[1:18:57] may it be a strength and a blessing to
[1:18:59] you and uh so if you have your Bibles
[1:19:03] We want to uh turn to Colossians the
[1:19:07] first chapter
[1:19:09] and we're going to begin reading at
[1:19:11] verse 17 and go to the 18th verse and uh
[1:19:15] then we'll turn over to Colossians the
[1:19:18] 3r chapter
[1:19:21] and begin reading from verse one.
[1:19:26] How many appreciates the word?
[1:19:30] Colossians 1 and verse 17. And he is
[1:19:34] before all things, and by him all things
[1:19:38] consist.
[1:19:40] And he is the head of the body, the
[1:19:42] church, who is the beginning, the
[1:19:45] firstborn from the dead, that in all
[1:19:48] things he might have the preeminence.
[1:19:51] Just say that with me. That in all
[1:19:53] things
[1:19:55] &gt;&gt; he might have the preeminence.
[1:19:59] Now, Colossians the 3r chapter
[1:20:03] beginning at verse one. We'll just read
[1:20:05] the first four verses.
[1:20:08] If ye then be risen with Christ, seek
[1:20:12] those things which are above, where
[1:20:15] Christ siteth on the right hand of God.
[1:20:18] Set your affection on things above, not
[1:20:22] on things on the earth. For you are dead
[1:20:25] and your life is hid with Christ in God
[1:20:30] when Christ who is our life. I just love
[1:20:34] that. When Christ who is our life shall
[1:20:39] appear or shall be made manifest, then
[1:20:43] shall you also appear with him in glory.
[1:20:48] I believe we're living in the
[1:20:49] fulfillment of these portions of
[1:20:51] scripture. And may God add his blessings
[1:20:54] to the reading of the word. You may be
[1:20:56] seated. We'd like to just take for a
[1:20:59] text the motivating force of our lives.
[1:21:04] We are a part of a kingdom where Christ
[1:21:08] is king. And we have come in this age
[1:21:13] into position with him into his domain.
[1:21:18] And that is the position that God has
[1:21:21] called us to because we are in a
[1:21:24] dispensation of overcoming. It's a
[1:21:28] dispensation of conquering. And Jesus
[1:21:31] Christ has already overcome. He's
[1:21:35] overcome Satan's kingdom. He's already
[1:21:38] overcome Satan's rule and his domain.
[1:21:42] But now it is our time that as we as we
[1:21:47] overcome then he promised that we will
[1:21:50] set with him in his domain in his rule.
[1:21:55] And so that is what we are a part of.
[1:21:58] We're not a part of a denomination.
[1:22:00] We're not a part of just a a certain
[1:22:04] cult or a certain sect, but we are a
[1:22:07] part of a kingdom where Christ is head.
[1:22:12] He is our king and we are his subject.
[1:22:17] The prophet of God would show us that
[1:22:19] it's the spirit that motivates us. It's
[1:22:23] the spirit that motivates anything. And
[1:22:26] he would say that his gift, it's uh it's
[1:22:29] a little bit different than just being a
[1:22:32] preacher or something. And but he what
[1:22:34] he was letting the church know under
[1:22:37] that prophetic gift, he was he he
[1:22:40] discerned spirits and he would begin to
[1:22:43] he was able to watch and he would let us
[1:22:46] know that every home has a spirit behind
[1:22:50] it. Every church has a spirit behind it.
[1:22:55] Every individual has a spirit behind it.
[1:22:58] And the prophet would say that we should
[1:23:00] have discernment of spirit. We're very
[1:23:04] familiar with that with that message the
[1:23:06] prophet preached. He would say that
[1:23:08] that's where we must discern today. The
[1:23:11] spirit of a man. What's he trying to do?
[1:23:14] What's he getting at? Not what group he
[1:23:16] belongs to or what this that or the
[1:23:19] other. Whether he's a white man, black
[1:23:21] man, yellow man, or whatever he is.
[1:23:24] Let's see what he's trying to achieve
[1:23:27] and take that. See what he's trying to
[1:23:30] do for the kingdom of God. He's got odd
[1:23:33] ideas to ours. That's perfectly all
[1:23:35] right. If he's trying to achieve
[1:23:37] something for the kingdom of God,
[1:23:39] discern that in him. If he's wrong and
[1:23:42] true and hard, God will bring him around
[1:23:45] to the truth of the thing after a while.
[1:23:48] Let him alone. Let him alone. See what
[1:23:50] he's trying to do. So the prophet of God
[1:23:54] would actually teach us that he would
[1:23:57] rather be uh right in his spirit. Amen.
[1:24:01] That's what is important is to have the
[1:24:04] right spirit because it's it's your
[1:24:07] spirit that affects your life. If you
[1:24:10] get something in your spirit, maybe just
[1:24:13] an a little oddness in your spirit, you
[1:24:16] watch it'll begin to you you you begin
[1:24:19] to act that out. you begin to act a
[1:24:22] little bit different toward a brother or
[1:24:24] toward a spirit or toward even maybe
[1:24:27] children to a parent or a wife to a
[1:24:30] husband and vice versa. And it's because
[1:24:33] it's your spirit. It if you can get
[1:24:36] something in that spirit that affects
[1:24:38] your life, it affects your actions. It
[1:24:41] But you see, that's why the the prophet
[1:24:44] would let us know that you've got to
[1:24:47] keep your spirit clean. You've got to
[1:24:51] just always discern even the spirit of
[1:24:54] your own life. Because if we're acting a
[1:24:58] little bit different and a little bit
[1:25:00] odd and there's separation in the church
[1:25:03] and maybe allowing little differences
[1:25:06] and a little petty ideas, it'll separate
[1:25:10] brotherhood. It'll bring friction in the
[1:25:13] church. And a lot of times I I would
[1:25:15] even say this, nine out of 10 times it's
[1:25:19] not even your brother. It's just because
[1:25:22] something is affecting your spirit. And
[1:25:25] it's a it's something in you that you
[1:25:29] got to get purged of that. Get it out of
[1:25:31] your system. Get out of your spirit.
[1:25:33] Maybe it's in your conscience. It's in
[1:25:35] your imagination. Maybe it's in your
[1:25:38] memory. And something keeps coming up.
[1:25:41] But that's what the blood of Jesus
[1:25:43] Christ is to keep us clean. You see,
[1:25:47] it's the blood that purifies the church.
[1:25:51] Amen. So, as long as we've got the
[1:25:53] clean, pure, virtuous blood of Jesus
[1:25:57] Christ flowing to the through the
[1:25:59] church, then it brings healing and it
[1:26:02] brings unity and it brings oneness and
[1:26:04] it and it keeps us going in the right
[1:26:07] direction. Amen. That's what the church
[1:26:10] of the living God needs. Amen. The
[1:26:13] prophet would say what the problem is in
[1:26:15] the church. The reason that it's sick,
[1:26:18] it's anemic. It needs the blood. And I
[1:26:21] tell you, it's still true for the church
[1:26:24] today. We need the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:26:28] to continually flow into the body. What
[1:26:32] is the blood is the life. Amen. So, as
[1:26:36] long as we've got the blood, we've got
[1:26:37] the life, and it's what keeps us clean.
[1:26:41] It motivates us in the right direction.
[1:26:45] Now, you see, amen. The prophet of God
[1:26:48] would say that the gates of hell is not
[1:26:52] against your a certain government. Amen.
[1:26:55] It It's not against a certain
[1:26:57] denomination. It's not against a certain
[1:27:00] church system. And we're talking about
[1:27:02] the gates of hell. Amen. The gates of
[1:27:05] hell is against the spiritual revelation
[1:27:09] of Christ being here now. The same
[1:27:12] yesterday, today, and forever. Amen. So
[1:27:16] that puts it puts us into focus. What
[1:27:20] Satan is after is against that spiritual
[1:27:24] revelation of who is among us right now.
[1:27:28] Well, let's just put it the way the
[1:27:30] prophet said it. The same pillar of fire
[1:27:33] that wrote the Old Testament was with
[1:27:35] the same pillar of fire that was with
[1:27:37] Paul that wrote the New Testament. And
[1:27:39] it's the same pillar of fire
[1:27:41] interpreting the Bible today. It's not a
[1:27:44] new book. We're not adding to it. We're
[1:27:46] not taking it away. But it's the same
[1:27:49] Christ here interpreting the word and
[1:27:52] bringing spiritual understanding to the
[1:27:55] church of the living God. That's what
[1:27:58] Satan is after. is after the spiritual
[1:28:01] revelation of the kingdom of God on the
[1:28:04] earth now and that we are a part of his
[1:28:08] domain sitting in heavenly places in
[1:28:12] Christ Jesus with every spirit of hell
[1:28:15] already under our feet. Uh it is supreme
[1:28:19] authority that has come to the church of
[1:28:21] the living God. Amen. And we're not
[1:28:24] looking backward at 1963.
[1:28:27] We're not looking forward to what is
[1:28:30] going to happen tomorrow, but we are
[1:28:33] standing upon a present tense divine
[1:28:36] supernatural revelation of Christ in me.
[1:28:39] The hope of glory and every demonic
[1:28:42] power of hell is under the feet of this
[1:28:44] bride. Uh, every power of Hollywood is
[1:28:48] under my feet. Uh, every power of
[1:28:50] demonic denominational systems and ideas
[1:28:53] of man is under my feet. Uh I've got one
[1:28:57] direction uh and that is to march uh in
[1:28:59] the step uh of the supreme authority of
[1:29:02] the vindicated message of the hour and
[1:29:05] it's going to lead me to a body change.
[1:29:08] It's going to rapture my soul. I'm going
[1:29:11] to step into that new body.
[1:29:14] Hallelujah.
[1:29:17] You see the prophet of God would say
[1:29:19] that you've got to do discern two
[1:29:22] spirits that are within the framework of
[1:29:24] the church.
[1:29:26] And that is a cane spirit. And that can
[1:29:29] spirit is against the spiritual
[1:29:31] revelation that is coming to the elect.
[1:29:35] You see, it's the spiritual revelation
[1:29:38] that that provides the place of worship.
[1:29:42] Amen. The place of worship is divine
[1:29:46] revelation to the individual.
[1:29:48] Hallelujah. So the king spirit, the
[1:29:51] intellectual believer that can worship,
[1:29:55] that has an altar, that comes to church,
[1:29:58] but what he's really after, he is
[1:30:01] offended at the spiritual revelation
[1:30:04] that the God's provided place of worship
[1:30:07] has been revealed. Uh, and it's not
[1:30:09] another, it's not a certain church. It's
[1:30:12] not in Jeffersonville. It's not in
[1:30:15] Trinidad. It's not in Ohio. It's not a
[1:30:18] certain nation. Uh the spiritual re
[1:30:21] revelation of God's provided place of
[1:30:24] worship is found in spirit and in truth.
[1:30:28] Uh that is God's provided place uh that
[1:30:31] he promised he will meet the worshiper
[1:30:34] in this day. So that Cain spirit,
[1:30:39] Amen, that Cain spirit is after that.
[1:30:43] You see, look at the response that God
[1:30:46] had to Cain. Just just worship the way
[1:30:50] your brother worshiped.
[1:30:52] You see, just just if you can just
[1:30:56] follow the blueprint that I have
[1:30:59] vindicated,
[1:31:00] just follow the word and just do what
[1:31:04] your brother I I'll I favor you. You
[1:31:08] see, God knew that that was serpent
[1:31:11] seed. Amen. God knew who Cain really
[1:31:15] was. But yet God was still amen
[1:31:19] extending mercy and saying just just
[1:31:22] follow what your brother is doing. But
[1:31:25] you see the Cain spirit, he's always
[1:31:28] persecuting the true believer. Amen. And
[1:31:32] I tell you friends, uh let's get every
[1:31:34] spirit off of us that would be offended
[1:31:37] at our brother, that would be offended
[1:31:40] against one another. Let's stand for the
[1:31:43] word. Uh let it motivate our life. Uh
[1:31:46] let the Holy Ghost uh keep us pure and
[1:31:49] keep the odds off of us. Uh because
[1:31:52] we're all wanting one thing and that is
[1:31:55] the rapture. That is the body change.
[1:31:59] [Applause]
[1:32:01] You see,
[1:32:04] the prophet of God would let us know
[1:32:06] that that's what's taking place right
[1:32:07] now. Amen. And he was saying, "Let's go
[1:32:10] back to Cain again and get some of the
[1:32:11] faith in the beginning. Watch those
[1:32:14] spirits how they begin to move." It's
[1:32:16] the spirit of anything that does the
[1:32:18] work of it. Anyhow, the people have to
[1:32:20] be in this kind of a spirit to bring the
[1:32:23] latter days. The people's in the spirit
[1:32:25] of the latter days. The nations are in
[1:32:27] the spirit of the end time. They got
[1:32:29] atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons, all
[1:32:32] kinds of things because it's the spirit
[1:32:34] of the day. The people are in the spirit
[1:32:36] of the end time. The church is moving
[1:32:39] together under the power and the impact
[1:32:42] of the Holy Spirit. And the world's
[1:32:44] running out yondering, making fun,
[1:32:46] scoffing, laughing, and they living like
[1:32:48] the devil every day. It's in the spirit
[1:32:52] of the thing. God's getting ready to
[1:32:54] take his. And the devil's getting ready
[1:32:57] to take his. So now we see the picture
[1:33:01] of what is happening today. A man is
[1:33:05] really Satan is taking his and God is
[1:33:09] taking his. Now motive. Now brother
[1:33:14] Brandon would say that you've got to
[1:33:16] you've got to look at motives and
[1:33:19] objectives.
[1:33:20] You see and it's the spirit that
[1:33:23] motivates.
[1:33:24] So motive is a reason for doing
[1:33:27] something. Now, if you look in the old
[1:33:30] ang uh the the the old English where it
[1:33:33] comes from, it actually says to move.
[1:33:36] Amen. So, when we're talking about a
[1:33:38] motive, we're talking about a reason for
[1:33:41] doing something, but we're also talking
[1:33:44] about to move. So, motive is actually an
[1:33:48] action. It is something, amen, that is
[1:33:51] putting you into action. It's moving
[1:33:54] you. Now, now listen what the prophet of
[1:33:57] God says in the invisible union of the
[1:34:00] bride of Christ. Some of you people that
[1:34:02] really believe this to be the truth that
[1:34:04] we're entering another age. We're
[1:34:07] entering the raptured age. You know the
[1:34:10] church can't go in its condition and it
[1:34:12] can't get any better. It must get worse.
[1:34:15] How many knows that? Say amen. The
[1:34:18] prophet said it. We say amen. It's got
[1:34:21] to get worse and it can't go like this.
[1:34:24] It's got to be something. And it's
[1:34:27] moving right now, friend. It's on. The
[1:34:31] move is on for the bride. That's the
[1:34:34] truth. That's thus saith the Lord. Amen.
[1:34:38] So, the prophet of God is showing. Amen.
[1:34:40] The thing that we have been waiting for.
[1:34:43] Amen. To bring us out of just a church
[1:34:47] system or or a church idea which can
[1:34:51] never make the body change. that can
[1:34:53] never mana manifest the presence of God.
[1:34:56] But the move to come out of that into
[1:34:59] another age is already taking place. You
[1:35:03] see what put forth what started the move
[1:35:07] was the opening of the word that called
[1:35:10] us out. Come out of her, my people. Come
[1:35:13] out of her plagues. Don't be partakers
[1:35:16] of her plagues. Don't be partakers of
[1:35:18] her unbelief. Come out of that. So, it's
[1:35:21] a prophet chopping a bride loose. Uh,
[1:35:25] it's exodus time. Uh, the move is on.
[1:35:29] Come out of that system and come into
[1:35:32] the raptured age. Amen. You see, it's
[1:35:36] the we've entered into the raptured age.
[1:35:40] &gt;&gt; And let me say it like this. We've
[1:35:42] crossed Jordan into his age. Amen. We've
[1:35:46] crossed Jordan into the word age. Now
[1:35:50] the prophet of God would say his age is
[1:35:53] the word age. We've had Leosa, cold,
[1:35:57] lukewarm, formal. That's their age.
[1:36:00] That's the Pentecostal age. We've had
[1:36:03] the Luther age. We've had the Wesley
[1:36:05] age. We've had the Pentecostal age. But
[1:36:07] this is his age. This is when he is
[1:36:11] marrying a bride. It's an invisible
[1:36:14] union becoming one with his bride. This
[1:36:18] is his age. It's the marriage age. It's
[1:36:22] the time that the word and the bride
[1:36:25] become one flesh. That supreme authority
[1:36:30] enters into the bride and she knows who
[1:36:33] she is. She understands her position
[1:36:36] because supreme authority has placed her
[1:36:39] back into position like Adam was in the
[1:36:43] Garden of Eden. Like the moon is in its
[1:36:45] position, the sun is in its position,
[1:36:48] the stars are in their position. Now by
[1:36:51] a word in this hour, the church has been
[1:36:55] placed into position.
[1:37:01] [Music]
[1:37:02] &gt;&gt; You see, he's placed us into rapturing
[1:37:06] faith.
[1:37:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. The word that had been sealed up,
[1:37:11] that had been the hand in the hands of
[1:37:12] the original owner, the title deed, has
[1:37:15] now been placed into the hands of the
[1:37:17] bride. The lamb came and claimed the
[1:37:20] book, opened the seals, and now he's
[1:37:23] claimed what he's redeemed, and now he
[1:37:26] has placed rapturing faith into your
[1:37:28] hands. It's in your heart.
[1:37:32] You're not wondering if you're going to
[1:37:34] make it. You know you're going to make
[1:37:35] it. You're not wondering if your
[1:37:38] children are going to make it. You know
[1:37:40] you're going to make it. It's because
[1:37:42] God in his grace paid the price at
[1:37:45] Calvary and he is interceding upon his
[1:37:49] people. And now he's come to claim what
[1:37:52] he has redeemed. That's what the Holy
[1:37:55] Ghost is doing. He's claiming you. He's
[1:37:58] claiming mamas. He's claiming daddies.
[1:38:02] He's claiming children. He's putting you
[1:38:04] in your position and telling you this is
[1:38:08] a raptured age. The move is on for the
[1:38:12] bride. That's thus saith the Lord.
[1:38:17] [Music]
[1:38:18] [Applause]
[1:38:20] You see, the prophet of God would let us
[1:38:22] know we've moved on up into the realm of
[1:38:25] the Lord's thinking. This is not the
[1:38:27] thinking of a man, but we've moved on
[1:38:30] up. Come up higher. Come out of that lay
[1:38:35] on a sea and age. There's an open door.
[1:38:38] I am the door. I am the word. I am made
[1:38:43] manifest to you. Christ who is our life
[1:38:47] hath appeared. And when he was made
[1:38:50] manifest, I seen my name. I seen that I
[1:38:53] was chosen in him before the foundation
[1:38:56] of the world. And now when he was made
[1:38:58] manifest, I have appeared. I have been
[1:39:01] made manifest and I seen a word a door
[1:39:06] made manifest and I step through it. I
[1:39:10] step through it. What is it doing?
[1:39:13] Bringing me into my adoption. Bringing
[1:39:16] me into my authority. Bringing me into
[1:39:19] position.
[1:39:20] [Applause]
[1:39:21] Not earthbound. Not staying in that
[1:39:24] earthbound leosia.
[1:39:26] stepping through by a prophetic
[1:39:28] anointing, an eagle anointing, a power
[1:39:32] to lift me up, to move me up and step
[1:39:36] into my authority.
[1:39:39] [Applause]
[1:39:43] &gt;&gt; That's why we need to listen to this
[1:39:45] message like never before. It's
[1:39:47] positioning you. It's showing you who
[1:39:50] you are. It's changing you. everyone
[1:39:53] that has received the new birth. Now,
[1:39:55] this word is transforming you. It's the
[1:39:58] power of transformation. It's holding
[1:40:00] you. It's cutting you. It's taking the
[1:40:03] world out of us.
[1:40:05] [Music]
[1:40:08] Hallelujah.
[1:40:09] [Applause]
[1:40:11] &gt;&gt; It's a raptured age. We moved on into
[1:40:14] the realm of the Lord's thinking. That
[1:40:16] means it's a different spirit.
[1:40:19] &gt;&gt; It's not your thinking any longer. We
[1:40:22] still have our thinking.
[1:40:24] &gt;&gt; We think a lot of things.
[1:40:28] Sometimes your wife may come in the room
[1:40:30] and she doesn't do something just right
[1:40:32] the way you like and you think a lot of
[1:40:34] things.
[1:40:36] Your boss says a little something or
[1:40:38] does something and you think a lot of
[1:40:40] things. Your pastor preaches a certain
[1:40:42] thing that maybe you're h maybe roughs
[1:40:46] you up a little bit. You think a lot of
[1:40:48] things. We're still in this flesh. We
[1:40:51] still have our thinking. But Paul said,
[1:40:53] "I've got to die daily.
[1:40:57] I tell you, die to every spirit.
[1:41:00] Die to every influence that would try to
[1:41:02] control your life." Hallelujah. Replace
[1:41:05] bitterness for love. That's how you get
[1:41:07] rid of a bitter spirit. Amen. Come into
[1:41:10] the presence of God and say, "Oh God,
[1:41:13] melt me all over again. Soften my
[1:41:16] spirit. Give me love for my brother.
[1:41:19] Give me love, oh God. Uh pour out that
[1:41:22] pour out that spirit of love within my
[1:41:25] heart. You'll come out of it.
[1:41:28] [Applause]
[1:41:31] You see, remember we said it last night,
[1:41:34] but I it bears repeating. Remember there
[1:41:38] is no more power goes out after that
[1:41:40] eagle.
[1:41:42] No power
[1:41:44] &gt;&gt; comes forth to give the bride overcoming
[1:41:48] power outside of this message.
[1:41:53] &gt;&gt; You see it's the eagle anointing. It's a
[1:41:56] vindicated word and we are seeing that
[1:41:59] we are a part of that prophetic word
[1:42:03] &gt;&gt; that God already forneew you. So he sent
[1:42:05] a prophet and he spoke himself a bride
[1:42:08] into existence.
[1:42:10] [Music]
[1:42:13] And the grace, rapturing grace that is
[1:42:16] upon our life is what is allowing us to
[1:42:20] see that that's my position. That's who
[1:42:23] I am. You may not feel like it. You may
[1:42:26] be going through the worst trial of your
[1:42:28] life, but it doesn't change anything.
[1:42:30] Your confession, that's me.
[1:42:34] Something's motivating you. Something is
[1:42:37] empowering you. Amen. to identify with
[1:42:40] what God spoke through a prophet and
[1:42:43] said, "This is who my bride is. She's
[1:42:45] perfect. She's sinless. She's virtuous.
[1:42:49] She's justified. As if she never sinned
[1:42:52] in the first place.
[1:42:57] I know Satan's trying to motivate your
[1:42:59] spirit realm. He's trying to motivate
[1:43:02] your memory and motivate your
[1:43:04] imagination and your conscience and your
[1:43:06] reasoning and and what you see and what
[1:43:07] you hear and how you feel. But we are
[1:43:10] lifted above those rims. You got to die
[1:43:13] out to those things. You got to die
[1:43:16] daily to those things. You got to lift
[1:43:18] up into the rim of the Lord's thinking.
[1:43:20] What does he say about me? What does he
[1:43:22] who does he say I am? Who does he say
[1:43:25] that my position is? And when it becomes
[1:43:27] a clear voice, a certain sound, then you
[1:43:30] step into it and say, "That's who I am.
[1:43:33] That's who I am. That's my position."
[1:43:36] And in that position, I have the
[1:43:38] authority to defeat the devil any place,
[1:43:41] anywhere, on any grounds.
[1:43:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:43:51] &gt;&gt; What is this eagle anointing? What has
[1:43:53] it done? And it's brought us back to the
[1:43:55] original word.
[1:43:59] &gt;&gt; You see, it's the word anointed for the
[1:44:02] age.
[1:44:03] &gt;&gt; And the prophet of God says it was the
[1:44:05] anointed man. Now it's the anointed
[1:44:08] people.
[1:44:11] &gt;&gt; It was the anointed bridegroom
[1:44:14] &gt;&gt; saying this day this scripture is
[1:44:17] fulfilled. Amen.
[1:44:18] &gt;&gt; The anointed bridegroom that can take
[1:44:21] the word and say, "Moses wrote about me.
[1:44:24] Isaiah wrote about me. Jeremiah wrote
[1:44:27] about me. The types in the wilderness,
[1:44:30] the the the the the Holy of Holies and
[1:44:33] all of the furniture in the temple, it's
[1:44:35] about me."
[1:44:39] &gt;&gt; And he can look at that word and he can
[1:44:42] identify himself and say, "It's written
[1:44:44] of me. This was done because it's
[1:44:48] written.
[1:44:50] &gt;&gt; This is done because it's written. The
[1:44:53] whole direction for his life. I go here
[1:44:55] because I do nothing except I first see
[1:44:58] the father do it. You see the revelation
[1:45:01] of sunship is following the revealed
[1:45:04] will of God. And the bride will have
[1:45:07] thus sayeth the Lord or she stands
[1:45:10] still. And this bride has been standing
[1:45:12] still long enough. But I declare unto
[1:45:15] you, we have thus, sayeth the Lord, by
[1:45:18] his stripes, I'm healed. By my token,
[1:45:22] I'm saved, and my children are saved.
[1:45:29] We've been standing still long enough.
[1:45:31] Let this word motivate us. Let the Holy
[1:45:34] Ghost motivate us. Let it put us into
[1:45:37] the move of God that that that we are in
[1:45:40] a raptured age. It's a rapture
[1:45:42] anointing. It's a rapture grace. It's a
[1:45:45] rapture faith to believe what the word
[1:45:47] says about me that I'm the bloodbought
[1:45:50] sinless bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:45:57] Anointed.
[1:45:59] Anointed.
[1:46:02] The anointing is supreme power under
[1:46:05] control.
[1:46:06] Anointed. Not a bunch of Pentecostal
[1:46:09] babies, but anointed.
[1:46:12] Not just an emotion, but an anointing.
[1:46:16] Not just a shout, but an anointing.
[1:46:19] Because where the revelation is
[1:46:21] revealed, there's a stimulation. And
[1:46:23] when the word is made manifest and we
[1:46:25] can see this is that, then we step into
[1:46:28] the motion.
[1:46:32] Such as I have give I thee. And the
[1:46:35] prophet of God says, what did Peter
[1:46:37] have? He had a faith. He was anointed.
[1:46:42] He was anointed to pray for the sick. He
[1:46:44] was anointed to take a brother by the
[1:46:46] hand and say, "You don't have to stay
[1:46:48] bound. You don't have to stay defeated.
[1:46:51] You don't have to stay discouraged. Get
[1:46:53] up.
[1:46:55] Get up. Get up. Get out of that jail.
[1:47:00] Get out of that hybrid. Get away from
[1:47:03] those man-made ideology. Come into the
[1:47:06] move.
[1:47:08] [Music]
[1:47:14] a hand of faith that it can unlock the
[1:47:17] promises. And brother Brandham, after he
[1:47:20] spoke, he that is in you and he told us
[1:47:23] about what happened with the spoken
[1:47:26] word, how that a storm was spoke out of
[1:47:28] existence, then he turns to the church
[1:47:32] and says what Peter said, such as I have
[1:47:35] give I thee. What did Peter give? He
[1:47:38] gave him faith. And such as I have, the
[1:47:42] prophet said, I give you faith for the
[1:47:44] hour.
[1:47:47] I give you faith for the hour. That's
[1:47:51] the faith of the hour.
[1:47:53] How to be healed. How to hold on to your
[1:47:56] healing. Un unfolding demonology.
[1:48:00] Unfolding the two spirits within the
[1:48:03] framework of the church. An unfolding
[1:48:05] headship.
[1:48:10] &gt;&gt; The faith
[1:48:12] from 47 to 65.
[1:48:15] Faith. The faith. Amen. A restored
[1:48:20] faith. A faith that says, "Now say
[1:48:24] you're healed. Now say you're delivered.
[1:48:26] Now say your sons. Now say you're
[1:48:28] raptured. Now say it.
[1:48:35] We are possessors of all things.
[1:48:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We are possessors of all
[1:48:47] things
[1:48:48] &gt;&gt; now.
[1:48:50] &gt;&gt; We're not waiting for the millennium.
[1:48:52] &gt;&gt; We are possessors of all things.
[1:48:55] &gt;&gt; We are sons.
[1:48:57] &gt;&gt; We are daughters.
[1:49:02] We're not waiting for a greater power.
[1:49:04] We're not waiting for a greater
[1:49:06] anointing. We're not waiting for some
[1:49:08] man to rise up to tell us the move is
[1:49:10] on. We have already received a son of
[1:49:13] man revealing the son of man. And he
[1:49:15] surrendered to the voice of God so he
[1:49:17] could tell you the move is on. Thus
[1:49:19] sayeth the Lord, the rapture age has
[1:49:21] already began.
[1:49:24] It began with a shout. It began when the
[1:49:26] Lord himself descended. And he descended
[1:49:30] with a shout, a message uh that was
[1:49:32] bringing on a bride uh that she can
[1:49:35] recognize her authority, recognize her
[1:49:38] position, that she is that message. She
[1:49:41] and the word are one that when you speak
[1:49:45] is the voice of resurrection. You've got
[1:49:48] the power of death and life in your
[1:49:51] tongue.
[1:49:54] [Music]
[1:49:57] &gt;&gt; You know I'm in the scripture.
[1:49:59] Death and life is in the tongue.
[1:50:02] &gt;&gt; That's why you got to make sure you know
[1:50:03] what's in your spirit.
[1:50:07] &gt;&gt; We are not babies any longer. Gag gag
[1:50:09] goooo. And we can spout out the mouth
[1:50:11] anything we want to. We are mature sons.
[1:50:17] &gt;&gt; We have been ripening under this
[1:50:19] vindicated message for some 50, 60 years
[1:50:22] now. If we're not mature now, when?
[1:50:26] &gt;&gt; If we're not ready for adoption now,
[1:50:28] then when? If we're not ready for the
[1:50:31] change of our bodies now, then when?
[1:50:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:50:41] &gt;&gt; But there's something about a mama
[1:50:45] &gt;&gt; that when the devil has been beating you
[1:50:46] up and beating you up and beating you up
[1:50:48] and then you begin to hear this message,
[1:50:51] you hear your pastor preaching this
[1:50:52] message and something strikes your heart
[1:50:55] and says, "I know my position.
[1:50:57] I have been ordained
[1:51:00] &gt;&gt; to be a mama.
[1:51:02] &gt;&gt; And when that demon tries to get a hold
[1:51:04] of your sick child,
[1:51:06] &gt;&gt; something rises up in your heart and
[1:51:08] begins to move you
[1:51:10] &gt;&gt; and you stand up in your position and
[1:51:12] say, "Satan, you have no claims upon my
[1:51:14] child."
[1:51:16] When the devil tries to come into your
[1:51:18] home and he's trying to wreak havoc in
[1:51:20] your home and you stand up and put your
[1:51:22] shoulders back and say, "Satan, I'll
[1:51:24] have nothing of it." It's because you
[1:51:26] know who you are. You know your
[1:51:28] position. You know that you have been
[1:51:30] claimed by the blood of Jesus Christ.
[1:51:32] And the Holy Ghost is motivating you to
[1:51:35] stand up. Stand up. Take back what the
[1:51:39] devil's been stealing from you. Claim
[1:51:42] your mountain.
[1:51:45] Tell you young people, you're a Joshua
[1:51:47] generation. You're a royal priesthood.
[1:51:49] You're a chosen people. You're a chosen
[1:51:52] group. I say God has allowed you to be
[1:51:56] born in this age that all the fighting
[1:51:59] and the fussing has already went
[1:52:01] through. Now you've got the claim to
[1:52:04] believe it.
[1:52:06] You don't have to fight over it. Just
[1:52:09] start walking. Just start walking. Just
[1:52:12] start walking. Claim your promise. Claim
[1:52:15] your promise. Claim who you are. Stand
[1:52:17] in your position.
[1:52:22] We are a generation of possessors.
[1:52:26] We are a generation of possessors. We
[1:52:28] are a generation that has turned the
[1:52:30] corner. We've turned the corner. We've
[1:52:33] entered in another dispensation. It's a
[1:52:36] dispensation of adoption, stepping into
[1:52:38] our position. We're not fussing. We're
[1:52:41] not fighting. We're not worried about
[1:52:43] groups. We're worried about one thing.
[1:52:45] Are we pleasing him?
[1:52:50] This is not the man age any longer. It's
[1:52:52] the eagle anointing.
[1:52:56] It's not the age of apostles and
[1:52:58] dictatorships of men. It's the time for
[1:53:01] the bride to come under her headship and
[1:53:04] say, "He is my Lord. He is my all and
[1:53:06] all. He is one I'm following."
[1:53:14] &gt;&gt; You take this message, it'll take you
[1:53:16] into adoption.
[1:53:17] [Applause]
[1:53:19] And it won't be what you feel. It's not
[1:53:22] what you feel like a shiver up and down
[1:53:25] your spine. It's simply a knowing.
[1:53:28] That's me.
[1:53:32] &gt;&gt; It's okay.
[1:53:33] &gt;&gt; That's me.
[1:53:36] [Applause]
[1:53:38] [Music]
[1:53:39] [Applause]
[1:53:42] &gt;&gt; That's me.
[1:53:48] We heard a prophet say
[1:53:52] &gt;&gt; she
[1:53:53] is him.
[1:53:58] &gt;&gt; And we have shouted and rejoiced over
[1:54:01] that
[1:54:02] &gt;&gt; she is him.
[1:54:06] And then we begin to take that quote
[1:54:09] &gt;&gt; and it just becomes something that we
[1:54:11] quoted
[1:54:13] &gt;&gt; and we begin to look around and say she
[1:54:16] is
[1:54:18] him.
[1:54:20] &gt;&gt; But you see an identified bride
[1:54:25] &gt;&gt; says she is him. Oh, he's talking about
[1:54:29] me.
[1:54:31] &gt;&gt; I am him.
[1:54:35] [Applause]
[1:54:40] [Music]
[1:54:43] I am him.
[1:54:46] &gt;&gt; You're going to work in the morning. I
[1:54:49] am him.
[1:54:51] You're going to school, young people. I
[1:54:54] am him. I am his expression.
[1:54:58] He is the son, but I'm the expression. I
[1:55:02] am reflecting his power. I'm reflecting
[1:55:04] his anointing. I'm reflecting that he's
[1:55:07] the mighty conqueror. I'm reflecting
[1:55:09] because he lives, I live.
[1:55:13] Not reflecting defeat. Not reflecting
[1:55:16] cowarding down. Why are we hiding behind
[1:55:19] rocks? Let's take f a i t j e s u s and
[1:55:24] go defeat that giant.
[1:55:27] Go defeat depression. Defeat
[1:55:29] homosexuality.
[1:55:31] Defeat pornography. defeat marriage
[1:55:33] crisis.
[1:55:36] I am him. The mighty conqueror who
[1:55:40] overcome death, hell, and the grave is
[1:55:42] abiding in me. I am him. I am a
[1:55:45] conqueror.
[1:55:47] I'm an overcomer.
[1:55:49] I have overcome death, hell, and the
[1:55:51] grave. Nothing can keep me out of the
[1:55:53] rapture. Nothing can keep me out of the
[1:55:55] body change. Nothing can keep me from an
[1:55:57] overcoming life. I am him.
[1:56:03] Now we are sons. Now we are positionally
[1:56:07] placed. Now we are seated in heavenly
[1:56:09] places.
[1:56:11] [Applause]
[1:56:13] [Music]
[1:56:16] [Applause]
[1:56:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:56:21] &gt;&gt; I believe we've come to an age of
[1:56:23] understanding.
[1:56:24] &gt;&gt; Daniel 12 says, "Shut up the words in
[1:56:26] this book. Seal the book until the end.
[1:56:30] Knowledge shall increase. None of the
[1:56:32] wicked shall understand, but the wise
[1:56:34] shall understand. You see, Paul said, "I
[1:56:37] pray, I've heard of your faith, but I
[1:56:38] pray that the spirit of wisdom and
[1:56:40] revelation would come to give you
[1:56:41] understanding. The eyes of your
[1:56:43] understanding would be open that you
[1:56:45] would know the hope of your calling.
[1:56:48] You're called with a holy calling." The
[1:56:51] high priest had a holy calling. Come
[1:56:54] into the shad glory. And Jesus came with
[1:56:57] a holy calling to tear down the wall,
[1:57:00] the barrier separating us from his
[1:57:02] presence. And now we've got a holy
[1:57:04] calling. Come into divine presence.
[1:57:12] It doesn't matter your age. It doesn't
[1:57:15] matter if you've been in the message 50
[1:57:18] years or 2 seconds.
[1:57:21] &gt;&gt; God is calling you. Come into the
[1:57:22] holiest of holies.
[1:57:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God is calling you to a
[1:57:26] relationship with him.
[1:57:29] &gt;&gt; He's bringing us to an age of
[1:57:30] understanding.
[1:57:32] The wicked will do on just continue to
[1:57:34] do more wickedly. The move is on for
[1:57:36] them. The move is on for Russia.
[1:57:38] Russia's doing what she's doing because
[1:57:40] it's time for it.
[1:57:42] &gt;&gt; China's doing what China is doing
[1:57:43] because it's time for it. And the bride
[1:57:46] is doing what she's doing because it's
[1:57:47] time for it.
[1:57:50] &gt;&gt; What time is it, hers? It's bride time.
[1:57:54] Rise and shine. Trim your lamps. Get the
[1:57:57] world out of you. Get focused back upon
[1:58:00] thus sayeth the Lord. It's bride time.
[1:58:03] It's bride age. The anointing of the son
[1:58:06] of man is lifting us up.
[1:58:09] [Applause]
[1:58:14] &gt;&gt; We're no longer children,
[1:58:16] &gt;&gt; but we've grown into full age.
[1:58:19] &gt;&gt; Strong meat belongs to them of full age.
[1:58:23] Amen.
[1:58:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:25] &gt;&gt; Perfect by the blood of Jesus Christ.
[1:58:29] &gt;&gt; But then there's a five-fold ministry
[1:58:30] that is preaching this message and
[1:58:32] waving this adoption message over the
[1:58:34] children of God and saying, "It's
[1:58:37] season. It's the time for it. Come into
[1:58:39] full age.
[1:58:41] &gt;&gt; The word is here."
[1:58:46] &gt;&gt; Pentecost message ain't going to ever
[1:58:47] produce a full age.
[1:58:50] But Jesus come in the dispensation of
[1:58:52] the fullness of time when every
[1:58:54] scripture that was ever prophesied of
[1:58:56] him was now coming into full
[1:58:58] manifestation. And this bride has been
[1:59:00] waiting for seven church ages to hear
[1:59:03] that voice come out of her. Come out of
[1:59:04] every camp of tradition, come out of the
[1:59:06] limits of man and now come into this age
[1:59:09] of full adoption, full sunship, full
[1:59:13] authority.
[1:59:19] We're preaching a message that is
[1:59:21] releasing faith to the people that has
[1:59:24] given you the rights and the authority
[1:59:26] to say you are already perfect by the
[1:59:28] blood of Jesus Christ. And now by a
[1:59:30] vindicated message, you have come into
[1:59:32] sunship, full sunship.
[1:59:36] We've been ripening and ripening. But
[1:59:39] the prophet of God would say in 63, 64,
[1:59:42] 65, I hear the coming of the combines.
[1:59:45] is because the harvest is here. The
[1:59:48] harvest is ripe. The seeds have been
[1:59:50] planted and now they're ripening.
[1:59:54] [Applause]
[1:59:57] &gt;&gt; Now,
[2:00:00] now I heard a prophet said, "What needs
[2:00:02] to happen is what you need is to ripen
[2:00:06] because we're still green.
[2:00:09] &gt;&gt; The crop's still green."
[2:00:11] Now, now, now
[2:00:14] that was that was what about 50 years
[2:00:16] ago.
[2:00:19] &gt;&gt; You see what he's waiting on is to
[2:00:21] someone stand to their feet and realize,
[2:00:25] wait a minute, I've been ripening.
[2:00:28] &gt;&gt; And I can honestly say that we are not
[2:00:30] just preaching that God sent a prophet.
[2:00:34] &gt;&gt; We are not just preaching that, well,
[2:00:36] someday it's coming, it's coming, it's
[2:00:37] coming, it's coming. But we are actually
[2:00:40] looking at a message with our eyes wide
[2:00:41] open.
[2:00:43] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:00:44] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:00:46] &gt;&gt; It's been maturing us all along.
[2:00:49] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:00:51] &gt;&gt; But then then I heard a prophet say, you
[2:00:55] know, you always need a little bit of
[2:00:58] greenness.
[2:01:00] &gt;&gt; Now I I'm going to be honest with you.
[2:01:02] When I seen that, I thought, really?
[2:01:06] And then the prophet of God was showing
[2:01:08] us that when you get so all of the
[2:01:11] greenness, greenness is a sign of life.
[2:01:16] &gt;&gt; You never get an attitude of I've
[2:01:18] arrived.
[2:01:21] &gt;&gt; And you get so stiff and starchy that
[2:01:23] when the move of the Holy Ghost starts
[2:01:24] blowing, you can't move.
[2:01:29] &gt;&gt; That ain't maturity.
[2:01:33] someone that stands up and says, "I've
[2:01:35] got all the message. I know more than
[2:01:36] you and everything else and you need to
[2:01:38] come under me." That is not the message.
[2:01:43] &gt;&gt; But as someone that's been growing and
[2:01:45] growing and growing and growing and
[2:01:46] growing and but all along she's
[2:01:48] realizing without his grace I am
[2:01:49] nothing. Without this message I am
[2:01:51] nothing. Without his power I am nothing.
[2:01:54] I'm just frail dust. Without his blood
[2:01:57] I'm anemic. I'll fall apart. I fall
[2:02:00] apart with the world.
[2:02:03] So when the Holy Ghost begins to breathe
[2:02:05] and and brood and move on the
[2:02:07] congregation, there's some greenness
[2:02:09] that begins to blow those leaves and
[2:02:11] blow those branches and something begins
[2:02:14] to say, "I need more of God. I I I've
[2:02:17] got to have more of this life. I've got
[2:02:19] to have more of his perfection. I've got
[2:02:21] to have this message. Amen. I've got to
[2:02:23] die daily. I I've got to get my own
[2:02:25] stinking thinking out of me. I've got to
[2:02:27] get my own pride out of me. I've got.
[2:02:29] But all the while you realize I'm an oak
[2:02:32] tree. I have been destined for this. I
[2:02:34] have been placed persistently. I have
[2:02:37] grown in this message and there's life
[2:02:39] flowing through me.
[2:02:41] [Applause]
[2:02:46] Every time a wind comes blowing your
[2:02:48] way, you're not saying, "Oh, I guess I'm
[2:02:50] just not a son of God.
[2:02:52] &gt;&gt; I guess I'm not going to make it."
[2:02:54] &gt;&gt; No, sir. You want to have an
[2:02:57] understanding of who you are.
[2:03:00] &gt;&gt; You have been destined to defeat the
[2:03:01] devil in his own Eden.
[2:03:04] And those branches are saying, "Praise
[2:03:06] be to God. I know who is motivating my
[2:03:08] life. I know who's living through me. I
[2:03:10] know it's it's by grace that I am what I
[2:03:13] am."
[2:03:15] But there's something motivating you to
[2:03:16] keep pressing the battle. Keep speaking
[2:03:19] that word. Keep professing who you are.
[2:03:21] Keep standing there saying, "As the moon
[2:03:23] is placed, I have been placed. As the
[2:03:26] sun has been placed, I have been placed.
[2:03:30] Not reflecting our own ideas any longer.
[2:03:33] We've come into full age. We are
[2:03:35] reflecting the word for this age.
[2:03:39] [Music]
[2:03:43] You see, the prophet of God would say,
[2:03:47] quoting Revelations 3:7, "These things
[2:03:49] saith he that is true."
[2:03:52] Now this word true is a very wonderful
[2:03:55] word.
[2:03:57] &gt;&gt; It does not mean true in just the sense
[2:03:59] that is opposite to false. It expresses
[2:04:01] the perfect realization of an idea as
[2:04:04] contrasted with its partial re
[2:04:06] realization.
[2:04:07] &gt;&gt; For example, we recall that Jesus said
[2:04:10] in John 6:32, Moses gave you not that
[2:04:12] bread from heaven, but my father giveth
[2:04:14] you the true bread from heaven. John
[2:04:16] 15:1, I am the true vine. Hebrews 9:24,
[2:04:21] for Christ is not entered into the holy
[2:04:24] places made with uh with hands which are
[2:04:26] the figure of the true, but into heaven
[2:04:29] itself now to appear in the presence of
[2:04:31] God for us. 1 John 2:8. Because the
[2:04:34] darkness is passed, and the true light
[2:04:37] now shineth. Since this word indeed
[2:04:40] expresses perfect realization as against
[2:04:43] the idea of partial realization as is
[2:04:45] illustrated in these verses, we can now
[2:04:48] understand as never before anti-ype
[2:04:51] contrasted with type and substance with
[2:04:54] shadow.
[2:04:58] So when Jesus was saying, "I am the
[2:05:02] bread that came down from heaven,"
[2:05:06] &gt;&gt; he was showing
[2:05:08] that what Moses had was the partial.
[2:05:13] &gt;&gt; The mana that was falling from heaven
[2:05:15] was the partial.
[2:05:17] &gt;&gt; And they were holding to a partial
[2:05:19] realization,
[2:05:21] &gt;&gt; a partial understanding. Our fathers ate
[2:05:24] mana in the wilderness, but Jesus said,
[2:05:27] "I am the bread that came down from
[2:05:30] heaven."
[2:05:31] So they got confused between the partial
[2:05:35] and the perfect.
[2:05:37] You see, one is a shadow, the other is a
[2:05:41] perfect.
[2:05:42] And for seven church ages, we've been
[2:05:44] hearing shadow. But now in the last
[2:05:47] days, we've not heard just from the
[2:05:49] shadow. We've heard from the son. The
[2:05:52] son himself has spoke in the last days
[2:05:56] to bring us from a type and a shadow to
[2:05:58] a perfect realization. It's Christ here.
[2:06:02] It's the bread of life here. It's his
[2:06:04] shakana glory here. It's the mighty
[2:06:07] contour here.
[2:06:11] Now we are sons of God.
[2:06:15] Therefore, we move from the prophecy to
[2:06:17] the fulfillment because now he's
[2:06:20] speaking to us in this last days by his
[2:06:22] son.
[2:06:24] &gt;&gt; You see, we put off childish things. For
[2:06:27] Paul said, we knew in part, but now we
[2:06:31] pro and we prophesied in part. But when
[2:06:34] that which is perfect is come, then that
[2:06:36] which is in part shall be done away.
[2:06:38] When I was a child, I spake as a child.
[2:06:40] I understood as a child. I thought as a
[2:06:42] child, but when I become a man, I put
[2:06:44] away childish things. For now we see
[2:06:47] through a glass darkly, but then face to
[2:06:50] face. Now I know in part, but then shall
[2:06:53] I know even as also I am known.
[2:06:57] [Music]
[2:07:00] &gt;&gt; You see, when you're a child, you don't
[2:07:01] have full understanding. Your dad is
[2:07:03] telling you, son, this is who you are.
[2:07:06] He's telling you about life. He's
[2:07:08] telling you about responsibilities.
[2:07:10] You're growing. You're growing up into
[2:07:12] age, but I'm not going to give my
[2:07:15] 10year-old the keys to my car.
[2:07:19] I'm not I'm not going to tell my
[2:07:20] six-year-old that he has got full
[2:07:22] responsibility.
[2:07:24] But you see, he's growing up. He's being
[2:07:27] tutored. He's being shown
[2:07:29] responsibility. He's being shown my
[2:07:31] desires. Amen. But you see, when he
[2:07:34] comes into full age, he just steps into
[2:07:36] his position, it's not what I force him
[2:07:39] to do. is not what I make him to do.
[2:07:40] There's something within him as a son
[2:07:43] that he just comes because it's the time
[2:07:46] for it. It's the season for it.
[2:07:49] [Applause]
[2:07:52] Brother Isaac,
[2:07:54] I've got an 18-year-old boy. He's about
[2:07:57] to be 19. And I've been watching the
[2:07:59] transformation. Amen. Before I would
[2:08:02] have to sit down and I was showing him
[2:08:04] as he's growing up and I would tell him,
[2:08:05] "Now, son, this is how you do this and
[2:08:08] this is what you do." and I'm I'm I'm
[2:08:09] I'm advising him and I'm telling him
[2:08:12] integrity and I'm telling him about
[2:08:13] responsibility, but then I've been gone.
[2:08:16] I've been going on these meetings and
[2:08:18] trips and and I've not been home and and
[2:08:20] and and my wife is telling me, "Oh,
[2:08:22] you'd be so proud of Nathaniel because
[2:08:25] he's stepping into responsibility.
[2:08:28] Before I had to tell him, before I had
[2:08:31] to check, you know, you aren't you going
[2:08:33] to do it? This is your job. This is your
[2:08:35] chore. This is your responsibility." But
[2:08:37] now he's just stepping into his
[2:08:39] position. He's just accepting the
[2:08:41] responsibility. No one is having to make
[2:08:43] him. No one has to beat it into him. No
[2:08:45] one has to just teach him and teach him
[2:08:47] and teach him. Sometimes teaching and
[2:08:50] teaching and teaching, it ain't going to
[2:08:52] do you any good.
[2:08:54] We already know.
[2:08:56] But it takes the Holy Ghost, the season,
[2:09:01] the time of adoption where the Holy
[2:09:03] Ghost begins to motivate you and say,
[2:09:06] "Step into it.
[2:09:10] Mama, step into it. Daddy, step into it.
[2:09:14] Ministry, be who you are,
[2:09:17] [Applause]
[2:09:20] &gt;&gt; not beating you and beating you and
[2:09:22] beating you.
[2:09:26] But something within the DNA of a
[2:09:29] Christian realizes the winds are blowing
[2:09:32] realizes the season that we're in and
[2:09:35] begins to move into it.
[2:09:39] Satan, get away from me. Satan, get away
[2:09:42] from my wife. Satan, get away from my
[2:09:44] husband. Satan, get out of my house.
[2:09:46] Satan, you can't have my children.
[2:09:49] [Music]
[2:09:52] It's because you've got someone greater
[2:09:54] than your pastor going home with you.
[2:09:56] You got someone greater than brother
[2:09:57] Isaac going home with you. You got
[2:09:59] someone greater than your prophet going
[2:10:01] home with you. You've got the son of man
[2:10:04] living inside you. And he's breathing
[2:10:06] through you. He's motivating you. He's
[2:10:09] pulsating his life through you.
[2:10:13] [Applause]
[2:10:19] And then you turn around to your
[2:10:20] children and say, "The faith that I
[2:10:21] have, I give you
[2:10:26] &gt;&gt; the confidence I have in this message. I
[2:10:28] give you
[2:10:30] the confidence that I know that this
[2:10:31] message lives and it works and it's
[2:10:33] life-changing. I give you.
[2:10:38] I'm sorry. I'm just preaching. I feel
[2:10:40] good." Amen. Because I feel the courage.
[2:10:44] I feel the strength of of El Shadi
[2:10:48] flowing through me. He's saying I'm the
[2:10:50] breasted one. Feed on my promises. Feed
[2:10:53] on my promises. It's going to bring you
[2:10:55] to a a manifestation of every promise
[2:11:01] [Applause]
[2:11:03] season.
[2:11:07] &gt;&gt; When God called Abraham by election, it
[2:11:10] was a season of coming out.
[2:11:12] Amen.
[2:11:14] &gt;&gt; Genesis 12
[2:11:16] &gt;&gt; Abraham Abram called
[2:11:20] &gt;&gt; Genesis 15 was a season that he needed
[2:11:23] the word the promise the covenant
[2:11:25] confirmed.
[2:11:28] &gt;&gt; It says I you say that I'm going to have
[2:11:30] a seed but I don't know.
[2:11:33] &gt;&gt; How am I going to know? Maybe it's
[2:11:35] through my servant Eleazar.
[2:11:39] And God comes down and shows Abraham
[2:11:42] shows Abram that he is just he's a man.
[2:11:45] He's worthy of hell. He's doomed for
[2:11:47] hell. That's where he's going. But then
[2:11:49] Abraham is he puts God God puts Abram to
[2:11:53] sleep. And he comes I don't I don't have
[2:11:56] time to go through everything. You you
[2:11:57] understand where I'm at, right? Genesis
[2:11:59] 15. And then God comes through the
[2:12:00] sacrifices
[2:12:02] and walks that pillar of fire walks
[2:12:04] through there and says, "Abram, you're
[2:12:06] worthy of hell. That's where you That's
[2:12:08] where you were going. But Abram, I've
[2:12:10] changed your direction.
[2:12:13] &gt;&gt; And as I have called you, I am the alpha
[2:12:16] and I'm also the omega. I'm going to
[2:12:18] bring the promise to pass
[2:12:20] &gt;&gt; and it's going to come through you.
[2:12:24] &gt;&gt; Genesis. Then Genesis 17 comes around
[2:12:26] and Abraham's an old man
[2:12:29] &gt;&gt; and he's been holding this promise and
[2:12:31] holding fast to this promise and saying,
[2:12:33] "God is faithful. God's going to bring
[2:12:35] it to pass.
[2:12:38] And El Shadi, God Almighty,
[2:12:43] &gt;&gt; comes to Abram and says,"Abram,
[2:12:46] I'm going to be your mother.
[2:12:49] Abram, you're an old man now. You're 99
[2:12:52] years old." And Abram, you don't have
[2:12:55] the strength, do you?
[2:12:58] &gt;&gt; Oh, how God brings us and and just
[2:13:01] brings our humanity to a place that all
[2:13:04] we can see is our failures. All we can
[2:13:06] see is our own mistakes.
[2:13:10] &gt;&gt; And he blows it up. Saggy arms, hurt
[2:13:14] back,
[2:13:15] &gt;&gt; hurt knees, arthritis,
[2:13:21] &gt;&gt; Abram, you've been holding to this
[2:13:23] promise for 24 years. But Abram, I'm
[2:13:25] going to reveal myself now to you as God
[2:13:27] Almighty.
[2:13:28] &gt;&gt; I'm El Shadi.
[2:13:30] &gt;&gt; Now, Abram, you just keep nursing on the
[2:13:33] promise.
[2:13:35] But then a few verses later,
[2:13:39] &gt;&gt; that same God Almighty comes down and
[2:13:41] says, "I'm Elohim."
[2:13:44] &gt;&gt; Now, Abram, you can't manifest the
[2:13:47] promises
[2:13:49] just Abram.
[2:13:51] &gt;&gt; But you've got to have a name change.
[2:13:54] &gt;&gt; So now, Abram, I'm going to give you a
[2:13:56] part of my own name,
[2:13:58] &gt;&gt; Elohim.
[2:14:00] I think that's how I was I was told they
[2:14:02] they they're heavy on that H.
[2:14:05] Elohim.
[2:14:08] &gt;&gt; Abraham.
[2:14:11] &gt;&gt; Abram, I'm going to give you a I'm going
[2:14:14] to give you a part of my own name.
[2:14:15] Abram, you're going to take on my
[2:14:17] identity.
[2:14:20] &gt;&gt; Abram, you've been you're nursing on the
[2:14:22] promise, but now I'm going to show you.
[2:14:24] You're not Abram any longer. You're
[2:14:25] Abraham.
[2:14:28] That's good.
[2:14:29] &gt;&gt; Now, the prophet of God shows us now
[2:14:30] grace covenant,
[2:14:33] &gt;&gt; an unconditional covenant, not if you
[2:14:35] will, I will,
[2:14:37] &gt;&gt; but simply grace.
[2:14:40] &gt;&gt; Genesis 12, Abraham or Abram was
[2:14:43] justified just like our walk. It
[2:14:46] parallels the seed of Abraham, our walk
[2:14:48] perfectly. Justification, Genesis 12.
[2:14:51] Sanctification, Genesis uh 15. Baptism
[2:14:54] of the Holy Ghost, Genesis 17. I'm El
[2:14:57] Shadi. The Holy Ghost coming in. But
[2:15:00] then a few verses later, adoption, the
[2:15:05] name change. The prophet of God says,
[2:15:07] notice from Genesis 12, Genesis 15, 15,
[2:15:11] it was many years. Genesis 15 to Genesis
[2:15:15] 17, many years. But when it comes to
[2:15:18] Genesis 17, from the Holy Ghost to
[2:15:20] adoption, it's only a few days.
[2:15:25] What is he showing us? It's the season.
[2:15:30] Justification made way for
[2:15:31] sanctification. Sanctification made way
[2:15:33] for the baptism of the Holy Ghost. And
[2:15:35] the baptism of the Holy Ghost made way
[2:15:37] for the Holy Ghost himself.
[2:15:39] [Music]
[2:15:39] [Applause]
[2:15:41] [Music]
[2:15:45] Brother Brandham is now at the
[2:15:47] dispensation change.
[2:15:50] &gt;&gt; And he's at the opening of the word.
[2:15:52] &gt;&gt; God had already showed him. He's already
[2:15:54] told the church there's a climax, a
[2:15:56] second climax to my ministry. We've
[2:15:58] already went through the first two
[2:15:59] pools. Amen. The discern uh the healing
[2:16:02] of the sick in the sign of the hand and
[2:16:04] then the discernment, the the the the
[2:16:06] the visions of the discerning the the
[2:16:09] thoughts intents of the heart. But now
[2:16:11] there's a second climax which is the
[2:16:12] opening of the word, the third pull.
[2:16:16] &gt;&gt; And as he's now turning the corner, he's
[2:16:18] changing the dispensation. The lamb is
[2:16:20] coming to take the book.
[2:16:24] &gt;&gt; The same time that Revelations 10:7 is
[2:16:27] on the earth, Revelations 10:1 is upon
[2:16:29] the earth.
[2:16:32] And now the prophet of God is he's he's
[2:16:35] he's he's bringing this understanding
[2:16:38] and he's talking to the church of the
[2:16:39] living God and he's breaking the seals
[2:16:41] and he's bringing an understanding but
[2:16:42] then he stops and he says now so you
[2:16:46] will understand
[2:16:48] I don't call you church I'm going to
[2:16:50] call you bride
[2:16:52] what is he showing the name is changing
[2:16:56] denominational ages is ending the time
[2:17:00] to be all just the call out, just the
[2:17:03] church, just the people of God. That
[2:17:06] dispensation is ending. And now there's
[2:17:09] a dispensation of a headship. You are
[2:17:13] now the bride of Jesus Christ.
[2:17:19] [Applause]
[2:17:21] He's showing you the adoption season is
[2:17:24] now.
[2:17:26] Seven angels on Mount Sunset, the
[2:17:29] constellation of angels. I tell you
[2:17:32] friends, that constellation of angels
[2:17:34] means everything to us.
[2:17:40] &gt;&gt; I'm closing.
[2:17:43] When I got on the plane and I came here,
[2:17:45] I've got a passport.
[2:17:48] &gt;&gt; When they want to see my passport, they
[2:17:51] open it up and they took a picture, not
[2:17:53] of my body.
[2:17:56] They took a picture of my head
[2:17:59] &gt;&gt; and when they see that head,
[2:18:01] &gt;&gt; they look at the head and they look at
[2:18:03] me and they look at the head and they
[2:18:04] look at me and then they look at all the
[2:18:05] credentials.
[2:18:07] &gt;&gt; And they identify that that's who I am.
[2:18:10] &gt;&gt; You know what that gives me the right
[2:18:12] to? To go through security.
[2:18:14] &gt;&gt; I don't have to be handcuffed. I don't
[2:18:16] have to be restrained. I don't have to
[2:18:18] be con I don't have to be looked at as
[2:18:20] some criminal.
[2:18:23] But they're looking at identity and
[2:18:25] saying, "You've got the right.
[2:18:31] &gt;&gt; When I go to my airplane this evening, I
[2:18:35] have already received a notice, a
[2:18:37] message that you can check in.
[2:18:40] I have already put my passport, the
[2:18:44] token.
[2:18:46] It's already on file. I've already
[2:18:49] checked in. I'm not worried about my
[2:18:52] flight.
[2:18:54] My name's on the record. My seat is on
[2:18:58] the plane.
[2:19:02] [Music]
[2:19:06] So this evening, I'm just letting you
[2:19:09] know I'm not scared. I'm not worried.
[2:19:12] I'm not worried that there won't be a
[2:19:14] seat for me because my name is already
[2:19:16] attached to a seat.
[2:19:19] I'm already a part of the bride. I'm
[2:19:22] already a part of the raptured age. I'm
[2:19:25] already in the dispensation of adoption.
[2:19:27] [Music]
[2:19:30] You know what I'm going to do? Brother
[2:19:33] Isaac is going to drop me off at the
[2:19:34] airport. And when they say all aboard,
[2:19:39] I'm just going to get myself up out of
[2:19:41] my seat. I'm going to walk into the line
[2:19:44] and I'm going to have confidence. And
[2:19:47] when they when I stand before that
[2:19:49] little that little image, it's going to
[2:19:51] take a picture. It's going to reflect my
[2:19:54] image and it's going to say that is
[2:19:56] Jonathan Martin. It's not going to be
[2:19:58] cared about my body.
[2:20:01] [Applause]
[2:20:01] [Music]
[2:20:04] But where my head goes, my body goes.
[2:20:16] When they allow my head,
[2:20:19] when I see my position
[2:20:21] and I'm walking into my position, my
[2:20:24] body does not have its own intelligence.
[2:20:27] My body is not arguing with my headship
[2:20:30] saying, "Are you sure we can do this?
[2:20:32] Are you sure that we can get on this
[2:20:34] plane? You dummy. You've got too much
[2:20:36] authority. You've got you're taking too
[2:20:38] much confidence.
[2:20:41] My body is under the control of my mind
[2:20:49] &gt;&gt; and my mind already is confident. My
[2:20:51] mind is already secure.
[2:20:59] &gt;&gt; Nope, not mine.
[2:21:00] &gt;&gt; Nope, that's not mine. Nope. Nope,
[2:21:03] that's not mine. Oh, there it is.
[2:21:06] &gt;&gt; And I just
[2:21:09] Excuse me.
[2:21:11] Th this is my seat.
[2:21:14] [Applause]
[2:21:22] &gt;&gt; I'm not worried
[2:21:24] &gt;&gt; because it already says 24E is your
[2:21:27] seat.
[2:21:29] &gt;&gt; And when I get into my seat,
[2:21:34] [Music]
[2:21:35] &gt;&gt; I'm ready.
[2:21:36] &gt;&gt; I'm ready.
[2:21:37] &gt;&gt; I'm ready.
[2:21:39] [Applause]
[2:21:41] I'm ready,
[2:21:44] &gt;&gt; confident,
[2:21:46] secure.
[2:21:47] [Applause]
[2:21:52] &gt;&gt; And when I feel the power,
[2:21:55] I feel those jets.
[2:21:57] [Music]
[2:21:59] And all of a sudden, my seat begins to
[2:22:01] vibrate. Oh, buddy, I love it. It puts a
[2:22:05] thrill in my soul. You know why? because
[2:22:07] I love feeling it take off.
[2:22:10] I love feeling the power as I begin to
[2:22:13] settle in my seat and I know that I'm
[2:22:15] going up.
[2:22:16] It's a raptured age. I'm a part of the
[2:22:20] rapture. I'm in my seat. I've got my
[2:22:24] token. I am secure. I'm feeling the
[2:22:28] move. I'm feeling the power. It's taking
[2:22:31] me higher and higher and higher.
[2:22:34] [Applause]
[2:22:39] Look at me now, devil. Look at me now,
[2:22:43] devil.
[2:22:45] Look at me now, devil. You held me in
[2:22:48] Leosa. You held me as a captive. But
[2:22:52] look at me now.
[2:22:54] I'm free. I'm under the eagle anointing,
[2:22:57] the eagle power, a prophetic message
[2:23:00] that has placed me, secured me, told me
[2:23:04] I'm my identity. Devil, look at me now.
[2:23:08] [Applause]
[2:23:09] [Music]
[2:23:12] Put off those childish things. Put off
[2:23:15] childish fightings. Put off those types
[2:23:18] and shadows. We've come to the perfect
[2:23:28] I'm going to leave you with this. I
[2:23:31] didn't even get to my notes.
[2:23:33] [Music]
[2:23:35] &gt;&gt; The motivating force.
[2:23:39] A force means
[2:23:42] that is it takes a substance.
[2:23:47] &gt;&gt; Force means that there's an energy.
[2:23:49] There's a power.
[2:23:51] But then it also takes something that is
[2:23:54] substance
[2:23:56] &gt;&gt; and something that has direction.
[2:24:00] &gt;&gt; So force means
[2:24:03] &gt;&gt; I wish I had a I wish I had a ball.
[2:24:09] &gt;&gt; Ah, here we go.
[2:24:13] As long as you just put it there, that's
[2:24:15] not force.
[2:24:18] But force means
[2:24:22] something gets a hold of it.
[2:24:25] &gt;&gt; It says, "Now, where do I want it to
[2:24:27] go?"
[2:24:31] &gt;&gt; Can you catch
[2:24:36] serious
[2:24:38] motivating force of my life
[2:24:42] means that the mighty angel has come
[2:24:44] down?
[2:24:45] &gt;&gt; He's taken the book.
[2:24:48] And then he turned around and says, "Now
[2:24:50] this one, I've cut the garment out.
[2:24:53] &gt;&gt; It's elected for rapture,
[2:24:58] &gt;&gt; and I'm going to motivate it
[2:25:02] [Music]
[2:25:05] &gt;&gt; in a direction."
[2:25:11] &gt;&gt; So in other words,
[2:25:17] that didn't go.
[2:25:24] &gt;&gt; And then I'm over here trying to catch
[2:25:25] it.
[2:25:32] &gt;&gt; That's what we've had through the
[2:25:33] denominational ages. Winds of doctrine
[2:25:36] just moving us about with every wind.
[2:25:40] &gt;&gt; Don't know where to stand. Unstable.
[2:25:42] Thousands of voices. But then all of a
[2:25:44] sudden, the mighty angel comes down and
[2:25:46] said, "That's my elect. I've redeemed
[2:25:49] her. I had her in my mind. She was in me
[2:25:52] when I died at Calvary. It's finished.
[2:25:55] I've already called her. I've already
[2:25:56] justified her. I've already glorified
[2:25:58] her. She's already sitting in heavenly
[2:25:59] places. It's finished."
[2:26:03] But now the devil's been whipping her
[2:26:04] around and driving her from here to
[2:26:06] there and confusing her. But now I'm
[2:26:09] going to take her
[2:26:11] &gt;&gt; and I'm going to take her in my power.
[2:26:14] &gt;&gt; It's going to be a prophetic anointing
[2:26:18] &gt;&gt; and I'm going to give take her in the
[2:26:20] direction she's going this way. But see,
[2:26:23] she's going to have to repent from the
[2:26:24] direction she's been going. She will.
[2:26:28] She will. She's been following that man.
[2:26:30] I'm following that man. I'm following
[2:26:32] that man. But then here comes thus
[2:26:34] sayaeth the Lord. The rapture age is on.
[2:26:36] And the prophet gets a hold that word
[2:26:39] gets a hold of our life and there's a
[2:26:40] deep calling under the deep. Satan gets
[2:26:42] a hold of us.
[2:26:44] [Applause]
[2:26:46] That's what force means also. It means
[2:26:48] magnetized
[2:26:50] magnetism.
[2:26:52] You're going this way and all of a
[2:26:53] sudden a deep calling to the deep
[2:26:55] something pulls you
[2:26:58] and you see God forgive me. I've been
[2:27:02] going the wrong direction. I've I've got
[2:27:04] this attached to my spirit and that
[2:27:06] attached to my spirit and I've got funny
[2:27:08] feelings about this and funny feelings
[2:27:10] about this and I've got these thinking
[2:27:12] about this. Oh God, I surrender to the
[2:27:14] headship of the word. Take it all out of
[2:27:17] me. I repent. Oh God, thy will. I've
[2:27:19] come to do thy will. I've come in the
[2:27:21] volume of the word to do thy will.
[2:27:25] [Applause]
[2:27:27] Amen.
[2:27:28] [Applause]
[2:27:31] &gt;&gt; And then that word begins to move you.
[2:27:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:27:36] &gt;&gt; The move is on
[2:27:38] &gt;&gt; for the bride.
[2:27:40] &gt;&gt; Do you know what it is? Once God sets it
[2:27:43] in motion,
[2:27:45] &gt;&gt; nothing can stop it.
[2:27:49] The gates of hell
[2:27:53] &gt;&gt; will not prevail against the revelation
[2:27:57] of him being here.
[2:28:01] Now let's let's let's break a further
[2:28:03] revelation of this because the prophet
[2:28:05] of God says it is Jesus Christ in bride
[2:28:10] form.
[2:28:15] &gt;&gt; She is him.
[2:28:18] You become the word
[2:28:20] &gt;&gt; as you allow the word to go through you,
[2:28:24] &gt;&gt; motivating your faith, energizing your
[2:28:27] faith, anointing your faith,
[2:28:29] &gt;&gt; and you begin to just go from glory
[2:28:33] to glory
[2:28:35] &gt;&gt; to glory. And the power of
[2:28:38] transformation is all over you. And then
[2:28:41] you hear the voice of Elohim just like
[2:28:43] he stood just like he ate ate meat and
[2:28:46] drank milk in the tent of in the tent of
[2:28:49] Abraham.
[2:28:52] &gt;&gt; That same voice is echoing to us.
[2:28:55] &gt;&gt; It's a vindicated word for this age.
[2:28:58] &gt;&gt; And it's as if we are sitting with
[2:29:00] Elohim at the tent.
[2:29:03] &gt;&gt; And all of those confusions that Sarah
[2:29:07] had
[2:29:08] &gt;&gt; complexes. All right.
[2:29:11] &gt;&gt; Oh, it's for Hagar.
[2:29:13] &gt;&gt; It's for the others. It's for that
[2:29:15] church. It's for that individual. Let me
[2:29:17] let me just say this. The prophet of God
[2:29:19] said, "Christ is the mystery of God
[2:29:20] revealed." It's not to a group. It's to
[2:29:22] a revelation, to an individual. At that
[2:29:25] day, you shall know that I'm in the
[2:29:27] Father and the Father and me and I and
[2:29:28] you and you and me. It's not to a group.
[2:29:30] It's to mamas and daddies and boys and
[2:29:33] girls.
[2:29:36] [Music]
[2:29:38] makes us walk different.
[2:29:40] &gt;&gt; You you're you're you're just going to
[2:29:42] church and then all of a sudden, brother
[2:29:43] so and so is acting a little bit
[2:29:45] different. Something's He's got a
[2:29:47] courage.
[2:29:50] &gt;&gt; And you begin to look at that and say,
[2:29:51] "Lord, what's what's going on?" It's
[2:29:54] because revelation is breaking over his
[2:29:56] life. And you know what it is? It can
[2:29:58] happen to one, then it can happen to
[2:29:59] another, then it can happen.
[2:30:01] &gt;&gt; It's not to a group.
[2:30:03] It's to the individual.
[2:30:08] &gt;&gt; And then you're watching and that that
[2:30:09] that daddy is taking his mountain,
[2:30:12] defeating devils, whacking devil. He's
[2:30:14] going through trials and they don't
[2:30:15] bother him. Don't discourage. Oh, he's
[2:30:17] still flesh. He's still from here down,
[2:30:20] &gt;&gt; but his headship
[2:30:22] &gt;&gt; is his identity.
[2:30:27] [Applause]
[2:30:36] the words. That's why the prophet of God
[2:30:39] would say, "I am God's voice to you."
[2:30:44] &gt;&gt; Every time you listen to that message,
[2:30:46] the prophet of God would tell us, "It's
[2:30:48] not me. It's not the seventh angel. It's
[2:30:50] only what I've surrendered to.
[2:30:53] &gt;&gt; I'm I'm just revealing him. It's him.
[2:30:55] I'm just the vessel that he's using.
[2:30:58] What is he trying to do? He's saying,
[2:30:59] "Don't get your confidence messed up.
[2:31:01] The devil's trying to rack your destroy
[2:31:03] your confidence." He said, "But don't
[2:31:05] don't listen. It's not me. I've got many
[2:31:07] mistakes.
[2:31:09] &gt;&gt; But listen to what I'm saying about him.
[2:31:12] That's the difference.
[2:31:15] &gt;&gt; We're men. We've got mistakes. We need
[2:31:18] the blood of Jesus Christ like everyone
[2:31:20] else." But listen to what we saying
[2:31:22] about him because he's never lost a
[2:31:25] battle. He's the alpha. He's the omega.
[2:31:28] He's the enforcer of his word.
[2:31:34] &gt;&gt; And as we're listening to that voice,
[2:31:37] it takes us right back to the tent of
[2:31:39] Abraham.
[2:31:41] &gt;&gt; Elohim speaking and maybe even we hear
[2:31:45] Abram or Abraham,
[2:31:48] where's thy wife
[2:31:50] Sarah?
[2:31:55] Brother Hovet, I I get beside myself
[2:31:58] &gt;&gt; because even in all of her unbelief
[2:32:01] &gt;&gt; and complexes
[2:32:04] &gt;&gt; because she was a part of the revelation
[2:32:08] &gt;&gt; because she was a part of her husband.
[2:32:12] &gt;&gt; Her name was changed too.
[2:32:21] There she was still wandering in her
[2:32:24] complexes. Me be the bride to me.
[2:32:26] Fulfill the promises. And her name was
[2:32:29] already changed.
[2:32:33] &gt;&gt; But it took the voice
[2:32:35] &gt;&gt; to say, "Where's your wife Sarah?" Name
[2:32:38] change.
[2:32:40] &gt;&gt; Says, "Oh, she's in the tent behind
[2:32:41] you." Said, "Why did Said, I'm going to
[2:32:42] visit you according to the time of
[2:32:44] life." Why did she laugh?
[2:32:48] &gt;&gt; Then she comes out.
[2:32:51] &gt;&gt; So many times we find our appearing
[2:32:54] is in unbelief.
[2:32:58] &gt;&gt; Oh, I didn't laugh. Oh, yeah. But you
[2:33:00] did.
[2:33:02] &gt;&gt; You did.
[2:33:04] But Sarah, I want you to know that
[2:33:08] you're going to manifest this promise.
[2:33:10] Amen.
[2:33:13] &gt;&gt; God would have killed her,
[2:33:15] &gt;&gt; but she was a part of Abraham.
[2:33:17] &gt;&gt; She was a part of the promise and no one
[2:33:19] could take her place.
[2:33:21] &gt;&gt; God would have killed you and I, but
[2:33:24] we're a part of Christ and a part of the
[2:33:26] promise for this age. Brothers and
[2:33:28] sisters, your name has already been
[2:33:31] changed. You're not just a church.
[2:33:34] You're not a high priest. You're not a
[2:33:35] denomination. You're the virtuous,
[2:33:38] sinless bride of Jesus Christ. Uh, but
[2:33:41] it's time to get all of the unbelief out
[2:33:43] of us. Get all the skepticism out of us.
[2:33:45] Let the voice of Elohim strike our
[2:33:48] hearts. Let it motivate us like never
[2:33:52] before.
[2:33:55] Change our confession.
[2:33:57] Change our confession
[2:33:59] &gt;&gt; from just someone that is childless to
[2:34:01] someone that's a princess.
[2:34:09] You know, I woke up singing that song
[2:34:12] this morning. Give me Jesus. Can we just
[2:34:14] sing a line of that again?
[2:34:16] &gt;&gt; In the morning
[2:34:18] [Music]
[2:34:19] when I rise
[2:34:24] in the morning.
[2:34:27] When I rise
[2:34:31] in the morning,
[2:34:34] when I rise,
[2:34:39] oh, give me Jesus.
[2:34:43] [Music]
[2:34:46] Oh, give me Jesus.
[2:34:50] [Music]
[2:34:54] Give me Jesus.
[2:35:00] Oh, you can have
[2:35:05] all this world.
[2:35:09] Just give me Jesus.
[2:35:11] [Music]
[2:35:15] Give me Jesus. Give me Jesus.
[2:35:20] [Music]
[2:35:24] Give me Jesus.
[2:35:30] You can have
[2:35:34] all this world.
[2:35:39] Give me Jesus.
[2:35:44] Just play it softly now. Could we bow
[2:35:48] our heads and just
[2:35:50] maybe you feel like Sarah this morning?
[2:35:55] Maybe you've got some complexes in your
[2:35:57] life.
[2:35:59] [Music]
[2:36:01] Maybe you're having a hard time seeing
[2:36:04] your true identity.
[2:36:07] Maybe you've got some mistakes in your
[2:36:09] past
[2:36:11] and and the devil's attacking your
[2:36:14] spirit and those memories and and it's
[2:36:18] just producing complexes and every time
[2:36:19] you try to get liberty, Satan moves
[2:36:22] right there and brings you back under
[2:36:25] captive to that complex.
[2:36:28] Maybe you're having a hard time. Mamas,
[2:36:32] I know you face great battles. Daddies,
[2:36:35] you face great battles,
[2:36:38] children, young people,
[2:36:41] while you're living in the hardest,
[2:36:43] hardest of times.
[2:36:45] [Music]
[2:36:47] But you see, the revelation
[2:36:50] is Christ is here
[2:36:54] and he's visiting us according to the
[2:36:56] time of life. His spirit is moving among
[2:36:59] us.
[2:37:02] Why don't you just make a fresh
[2:37:04] commitment to him? Why don't you just
[2:37:06] lay that complex aside for a moment? And
[2:37:10] maybe those fears of failure, just move
[2:37:12] them aside. The battles that you're
[2:37:15] going through, move them aside. Why
[2:37:16] don't you just look at Jesus right now?
[2:37:18] Just put all of your focus and all of
[2:37:21] your attention upon Jesus and say,
[2:37:23] "Lord, I need your help. Lord, I believe
[2:37:27] you.
[2:37:29] Lord, you've energized my faith this
[2:37:31] morning.
[2:37:33] And Lord Jesus, I want to take advantage
[2:37:35] of this moment. I want to say, "Oh God,
[2:37:37] help me.
[2:37:39] Take this complex away from me.
[2:37:43] Bring me out of all of the fear, all out
[2:37:45] of the confusion.
[2:37:48] Lord Jesus, I surrender myself to you.
[2:37:51] Lord, you're my head. You're the
[2:37:54] authority over my life, the authority
[2:37:57] over every situation. I just surrender
[2:37:59] myself to you, Lord.
[2:38:03] Father, I pray that you bless your
[2:38:05] people.
[2:38:07] I pray that you would help them, Lord.
[2:38:10] We're all flesh and blood. We've got the
[2:38:14] battles that we're facing
[2:38:16] and you know exactly
[2:38:18] what every every trial, every situation,
[2:38:21] the circumstances that your people are
[2:38:24] under.
[2:38:25] I pray, oh God, that you would be a word
[2:38:29] in season to their hearts.
[2:38:31] And this word, oh God, would so energize
[2:38:34] their faith that they would be able to
[2:38:37] say exactly
[2:38:39] what the word says, I am healed.
[2:38:43] You sent your word to heal us. And that
[2:38:46] word is for body, spirit, and soul. I
[2:38:50] pray, oh God, that they would release
[2:38:52] their faith right now as you're
[2:38:54] energizing their hearts, motivating them
[2:38:56] to just believe for all things. I pray
[2:38:59] that you would break every shackle, that
[2:39:01] you would remove every hindrance, and
[2:39:04] father just manifest yourself to every
[2:39:07] heart in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.
[2:39:11] And amen. God bless you.
