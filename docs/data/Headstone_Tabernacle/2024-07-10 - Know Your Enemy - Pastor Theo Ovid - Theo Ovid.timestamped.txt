[39:35] shed with the preparation of the gospel
[39:37] of peace above all taking the shield of
[39:39] Faith whereit you shall be able to
[39:41] quench all the far rarts of the wicked
[39:43] take the helmet of salvation the sword
[39:45] of the spirit which is the word of God
[39:48] praying all with all prayer and
[39:50] supplication in the spirit and watching
[39:53] there unto unto all perseverance and
[39:55] supplication of All Saints second
[39:57] Corinthians 10 want to read from verse
[39:59] three for
[40:00] though we walk in the flesh we do not
[40:05] war after the flesh for the weapons of
[40:08] our Warfare are not caral but Mighty
[40:11] through God in the pulling down of
[40:16] strongholds casting down imaginations
[40:18] and every High thing that exalted itself
[40:21] against the knowledge of God and
[40:23] bringing into captivity every thought to
[40:27] to The Obedience of Christ and having in
[40:30] a Readiness to Revenge all Disobedience
[40:33] when your obedience is fulfilled may God
[40:35] bless his word you may be seated praise
[40:37] God we are so grateful it's always a
[40:39] blessing to be in the house of God and a
[40:42] privilege and you have to
[40:45] be uh you know knowing in your heart
[40:48] that you want to apply what you're
[40:50] hearing so I have a title tonight know
[40:53] your
[40:55] enemy and have an inspir ation discern
[40:59] and
[41:00] withstand know your enemy you have to
[41:02] know your enemy because if you don't
[41:05] know your enemy you say you'll get lick
[41:08] up you'll get wiped out because you
[41:11] don't know your enemy you don't know
[41:12] what he looks like you don't know how
[41:14] how the enemy coming you got to know
[41:16] your enemy amen praise God because
[41:19] remember uh Satan was kicked out of
[41:22] heaven God gave him and he got kicked
[41:25] out and he fell on the Earth yes so he
[41:28] really not really estab he he really
[41:30] doesn't belong here in that sense this
[41:33] is where he fell and humans are here
[41:36] human the Battle of angels become the
[41:39] Battle of men is isn't that right so
[41:41] let's go now but BR he said now oh my
[41:46] should I read this if you are the
[41:56] bride all right I think I'll come back
[41:58] to that all
[42:00] right there has to be a place selected
[42:03] for this battle to start to rage and he
[42:05] said the battle is where the human mind
[42:08] when this great battle started on Earth
[42:10] there had to be a mutual meeting place
[42:12] there had to be a place elected for the
[42:14] battle to begin and for battle to rage
[42:17] and that Battleground begins in the
[42:19] human mind so the devil have no entrance
[42:22] unless we allow him
[42:28] because these Tabernacles or vessels or
[42:29] Temple don't belong to the devil it
[42:32] belongs to God so in other words the
[42:34] devil was seeking access to what he
[42:37] couldn't have with Adam and that's why
[42:39] he approached
[42:40] Eve do you understand that and by
[42:43] getting ease to reason and disbelieve
[42:45] God's word the devil got
[42:47] access and that's how Adam end up losing
[42:50] his rights to the inheritance his rights
[42:52] to the Earth that's how Adam lost the
[42:54] deed because in other words a back door
[42:56] was open amen and the devil got access
[42:59] as long and and that was so powerful I
[43:01] so enjoyed that a Sunday Jesus said he
[43:03] has nothing in me I there's nothing in
[43:06] me that belongs to him so he can't make
[43:08] no claims on me there's no lust there's
[43:11] no trying to steal and anger and temper
[43:14] and hatred that is he and nothing that I
[43:17] have in me belongs to him therefore he
[43:20] has no power over
[43:21] me Oh Glory to God and when God do that
[43:25] work in you that there there is nothing
[43:27] in you that belongs to the devil he has
[43:30] no power over you oh glory to God so
[43:33] then you have to come to the recognition
[43:35] now not only does he have no power over
[43:37] you but you have power over him oh glory
[43:39] to God then you recognize the whole
[43:40] thing transfer Oh Glory to God for you
[43:43] being under the subjection of the devil
[43:45] to the devil under your feet oh give the
[43:47] Lord some Praises do you get it now
[43:50] right now you might be in subjection to
[43:52] the devil but we are saying there's a
[43:53] shifting that going to happen with a
[43:55] revelation coming to you
[43:57] as you find your position as you find
[43:59] your place in Christ you begin to
[44:01] understand this is a genuine war and you
[44:04] are part of it ready or not like it or
[44:06] not Oh Glory to God you are part of this
[44:08] war this battle is ring tonight oh give
[44:11] the Lord some Praises Hallelujah and the
[44:14] battlegr begins in the human mind there
[44:16] is where the battle starts the human
[44:19] mind was chosen for the place of the
[44:22] battle so don't bother with what going
[44:23] on praise God you have to accept the
[44:25] fact that that that mind battle have to
[44:27] come everybody have it the pastor have
[44:30] it the Elder have it the Deacon have it
[44:32] every man Jack on earth have it because
[44:34] that is the ground the battle is a mind
[44:37] and if we get that mind set up right we
[44:39] we'll overcome we'll get the victory
[44:41] praise God hallelujah praise God so the
[44:44] devil want to disguise himself and don't
[44:47] show himself as the devil
[44:50] devil that's what Jesus did by Jesus
[44:54] beginning to cast out devils and expose
[44:56] Satan Kingdom he couldn't hide no more
[44:59] the deaf can't hide the blind cannot
[45:02] hide the dead can't even hide nobody
[45:05] could hide because Jesus was like light
[45:07] exposing Darkness Oh Glory the lepers
[45:10] couldn't hide even lepers comeing to him
[45:13] they couldn't cure leprosy he said Go
[45:15] and show yourself to the priest so all
[45:17] the Demons of sicknesses and disease and
[45:20] depression and frustration and he
[45:22] exposed them oh glory to God and he
[45:25] proved they were under his feet he said
[45:28] I by the Finger of God cast them out oh
[45:30] glory to God he wasn't even using his
[45:32] whole hand he was only using the Finger
[45:34] of God oh give the Lord a shout hle if I
[45:38] by the Finger of God cast them out what
[45:40] are your sons casting them by oh give
[45:43] the Lord some Praises so this
[45:45] Battleground is in the human mind five
[45:47] senses affection conscience reason
[45:50] imagination this battle is a battle of
[45:53] Faith versus reasoning it's Revelation
[45:56] versus say reasoning Oh Glory to God is
[45:59] revelation versus reasoning if you could
[46:02] get past your reasoning tonight and
[46:04] break into divine revelation have your
[46:06] battle over Oh Glory to God hallelujah
[46:10] praise God when when the Revelation Shu
[46:12] Peter what did Jesus said th at Peter he
[46:15] identified who he was he talking about
[46:17] all the rest of the Brethren he wasn't
[46:19] talking to them I said that th at Peter
[46:22] and Upon This Rock Hallelujah God want
[46:24] to speak to you tonight not just
[46:26] generalize got on to
[46:31] you this rock wasn't that people get
[46:34] thoughts and get ideas about who Jesus
[46:35] is you know the issue here was he heard
[46:38] from
[46:40] Heaven that was the rock you know
[46:43] because somebody can tell somebody he
[46:44] he's Jesus the Christ you
[46:46] know that's information that is telling
[46:49] the person that see
[46:53] it Jesus ask them and say don't the
[46:56] Christ and Jesus didn't say nothing
[46:58] because somebody tell him to say that
[47:01] he's
[47:01] repeating somebody who has a revelation
[47:04] repeating the Revelation somebody has
[47:06] doesn't give you the
[47:09] Revelation do you get that saying what
[47:12] others say that doesn't mean you have
[47:14] that Revelation you know you talking the
[47:16] talk the message talk but we not talking
[47:18] about that we talking about when the
[47:20] spirit revealed to you as an
[47:23] individual that your Warfare is over
[47:27] Hallelujah that you are free that your
[47:30] deliverance had come oh glory to God
[47:33] that King cometh lowly Hallelujah the
[47:36] king come suddenly to his Temple when
[47:39] God revealed to you that y has come for
[47:42] total Liberation total Victory total
[47:46] Deliverance total freedom it has to
[47:49] strike you
[47:57] so I want you to know
[47:58] tonight Satan is not trying to play with
[48:04] you he's trying to destroy you and
[48:07] destroy your family you'll be a idiot a
[48:11] fool not a think
[48:15] so your money can't stop
[48:19] him your fancy bedroom or bathroom or
[48:22] house can't stop him he has one
[48:24] objective to steal to Rob and to
[48:34] destroy and the battle is about to
[48:39] start people don't want to say Amen on
[48:41] that did thing the battle already you
[48:44] see the battle yet when Dynamics come
[48:48] the battle begins because Satan could
[48:51] effectively anoint his ministers in the
[48:53] message under the Matthew 242 for yes
[48:58] and anoint the people in the message the
[49:00] church under second Timothy he and high
[49:02] minded and God will anoint a
[49:06] bride second Peter 1 14-7 with faith and
[49:09] virtue and knowledge oh give the Lord
[49:12] some Praises
[49:14] Hallelujah so Christ anointed in other
[49:16] words the bride anointed would be Christ
[49:19] the
[49:20] word itself not an interpretation of it
[49:24] and that bride have to come forward
[49:26] first
[49:27] God have to witness the bride first
[49:30] before anybody else because the true
[49:32] anointed comes forth first when they
[49:37] step forward first then others will get
[49:39] it then they going say we have it
[49:42] too
[49:43] Hallelujah but that silver dollar that
[49:47] original dollar going to come forth
[49:50] Hallelujah
[49:53] first you are God's money on the Earth
[49:57] you are God currency on the earth even
[50:00] though they stamp on you you're still
[50:01] with it as I see somebody talking about
[50:03] $100 $100 your stamping it is still $100
[50:07] your crumit is still $100 Oh Glory to
[50:09] God and what the devil do to you you are
[50:11] still who you are and nothing will
[50:13] change that or cancel that Paul said it
[50:16] this way praise God what can separate me
[50:19] from the love of God that is in Christ
[50:21] Jesus shall trials and testings and
[50:23] tribulations things to come and things
[50:25] what and all all the devil trying do the
[50:27] G of the word as long as you stay in
[50:29] that word the devil in trouble because
[50:31] that's the word that bust him in the
[50:32] beginning oh give the Lord some Praises
[50:35] Hallelujah he catch Noah drinking he
[50:37] catch this one in slaus he get David in
[50:39] adultery he catch this one and that one
[50:41] but with Jesus Jesus said nothing it's
[50:43] written it's written it's written it's
[50:45] written you only serving him it's
[50:47] written it's written the devil don't
[50:49] know where he coming or going or give
[50:50] the Lord a shout in the house Jesus
[50:53] never declared by power who he was he
[50:55] didn't need that he knew who he was oh
[50:58] give the Lord a shout and he had faith
[51:00] in who he was and the bride will have
[51:02] that same revelation of who she is and
[51:05] have faith in who she is and you're
[51:07] going to have faith in the anointing
[51:09] that God put on you because God has
[51:11] released an anointing upon your life let
[51:14] Give the Lord some Praises do you get
[51:16] that tonight you have to accept that I
[51:17] have an anointing upon me I have faith
[51:20] in it oh give the Lord some Praises I

[51:27] gospel you got to know your enemy oh
[51:29] give the Lord some Praises hallelujah
[51:32] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory
[51:35] to God the bride five-fold Ministry men

[51:57] Ministry second Peter F your knowledge
[52:00] and Temperance that's the True Believer
[52:03] right
[52:06] there so don't let numbers fool you big
[52:09] congregation fool you everybody getting
[52:11] the anointing so right now we excited
[52:13] and talk abouted atmosphere just the
[52:15] atmosphere everybody even Pope
[52:22] getting are you shocked the prophet had
[52:25] a vision man SW a seed and then and then
[52:30] weeds come up and then everybody calling
[52:32] for the rain rain
[52:34] rain and what happened ride the fall
[52:37] then every seat bring after this
[52:41] sky so the battle my friends is about to
[52:44] start this church Wars un foolishness
[52:47] Satan just sit back relax and Minister
[52:48] fight another church fight another he
[52:50] not part of that them and the
[52:53] foolishness and the bad attitude and the
[52:54] jealousy and the envy and he let them
[52:56] loosen and they playing and they posing
[52:58] pit and playing it and Blasting this one
[53:00] and Blasting that one and have no all
[53:02] the Antics no power at all you
[53:04] know no zero
[53:11] power what
[53:14] brown whatever God did in the beginning
[53:18] remains and the tactics of reasoning is
[53:22] what Satan used and that what he ever
[53:24] uses reasoning we know our enemy because
[53:29] our Brethren I have I have let away from
[53:31] Doctrine you see but I've got to say
[53:34] this said these
[53:36] words any
[53:40] enemy he say this way any
[53:44] person any
[53:47] church any
[53:49] organization any individual that reasons
[53:53] against one punctuation of God's word
[53:56] word is your
[53:57] [Music]
[54:01] enemy a nice
[54:04] brother he a nice enemy
[54:06] then because he of the
[54:11] word the word not only is God you know
[54:15] the word is also
[54:17] Spirit words are Spirit yes both word
[54:22] word from God and word from the devil
[54:25] because people speak spirit
[54:27] yeah but BR somebody pick up in his car
[54:30] and he said they they spoke a Blue
[54:33] Streak and broke the anointing and after
[54:36] that he' be very careful who he let into
[54:38] his car because people walk with
[54:41] spirits and they speak and Spirit come
[54:45] out their
[54:46] mouth that's why you can't allow people
[54:48] to speak into your life that God didn't
[54:50] ordained to speak into your
[54:55] life do you get that and it have these
[54:59] spirits and people want to offer
[55:01] counseling want to offer guidance they
[55:04] married in samples but they want
[55:06] to marital
[55:10] counseling they have no
[55:12] husband but they want to Cel people with
[55:20] husband is the devil
[55:23] know is a spirit know and I don't think
[55:27] it strike us the way it's supposed to
[55:29] just yet that we
[55:32] wrestle not against flesh and
[55:38] Blood Brother
[55:40] Brown as well as these are know I'll
[55:42] skip that now we know we got
[55:44] counterfeits everywhere that's right
[55:46] it's a battle You' have got to know your
[55:48] enemy and you have got to know your
[55:51] armor what protects you that's why we
[55:54] read that scripture tonight and we find
[55:57] out you can't dress anyhow battle going
[56:00] gun shooting and you just Jersey
[56:03] tonight with a pant with split in
[56:07] it I feel like we're in a short
[56:11] pants the Bible talk about boots
[56:15] breastplate helmet it is specific it is
[56:19] the whole armor because the devil
[56:22] attacking us in no
[56:24] way so you can say you know what I feel
[56:26] to put on you know what I mean a tin cap
[56:28] then you put in you Patty cap like with
[56:31] little cone you want to put on a Patty
[56:34] cap
[56:35] you I feeling lead you feeling Le to die
[56:38] go will kill you when God say armor he
[56:42] means that I a feeling for no arm I go
[56:45] and pray going put on two hours of
[56:51] prayer the whole armor after a pray put
[56:55] on the armor put your armor and then go
[56:57] and pray but you can't just walk up with
[56:59] no armor and saying you're fighting so
[57:01] and you're fighting so and you're
[57:01] looking so and I it is scary for me when
[57:05] I hear some brethren speak the way they
[57:06] speak you know it is scary because God
[57:08] can lie you see God I
[57:11] say God cannot work outside his own
[57:16] laws when they say let Moses speak God
[57:19] can't change that after that he must s a
[57:21] prophet he can't coming down in Pillar
[57:23] of Fire on a mountain to talk to anybody
[57:25] in Trinidad and you had to go the
[57:26] mountain in Trinity Mountain P Spain
[57:29] from God he not doing
[57:31] that he set up a system that through the
[57:35] mouth of His prophets Faithful Men will
[57:37] come and bring the same word and Echo
[57:39] what the prophet said to his people and
[57:42] his people supposed to listen and apply
[57:45] the word he told Joshua Joshua the land
[57:48] is yours take it conquer it no he didn't
[57:50] tell Joshua that you know he told Joshua
[57:52] every place you put your foot is yours
[57:55] but if you want to have good success you
[57:57] have to meditate in the word no one
[58:00] again Wednesday night Sunday when I feel
[58:03] like it no day and
[58:06] night hallu are you doing
[58:10] thatall it's every day it becomes a
[58:13] habit that you're thinking about it you
[58:16] are meditating on it you you you it's it
[58:19] it it it it it affecting your mind what
[58:23] God is doing we talking about battle we
[58:25] talking about enemy we talking about a
[58:26] raging that is going on and you don't

[58:35] looking for
[58:38] you my
[58:43] God I was I said it before I say it
[58:46] again the devil is not concerned much
[58:49] with what you are now because you know
[58:52] what you was and he could tell himself
[58:55] you are the same person he know a lot of
[58:57] people change or they kind
[59:00] of what he's afraid of is what you can
[59:03] become if you get the knowledge
[59:06] Revelation and inspiration of God and
[59:09] that you could get God's desire in your
[59:11] heart because he knew what happened to

[59:17] stood in their time oh CL the Lord some
[59:20] Praises he knew all Paul irus and Martin

[1:06:05] and
[1:06:06] train for the contest that you're going
[1:06:10] to have when you meet

[1:06:16] him don't say Amen now you still going
[1:06:18] to meet
[1:06:19] him whether they say Amen or
[1:06:22] not but this thing just open up some
[1:06:24] things to me
[1:06:28] and to know him and know what his
[1:06:31] strength is and then train for this
[1:06:35] contest so when you do meet him for it's
[1:06:38] one thing sure you're going to meet him
[1:06:41] so train for the
[1:06:50] contest so when a boxer going in the

[1:33:44] this one he said no National Force will
[1:33:48] do
[1:33:49] it so no minister no group no Pastor
[1:33:53] could force a long time had a move a
[1:33:55] move of the Bride in Trinidad and a
[1:33:57] pastor tell me the time I to come to be
[1:33:58] part of the move and I wish him I laugh
[1:34:00] to myself he's on his own I said you
[1:34:03] controlling
[1:34:04] that a man declared this is the move of
[1:34:06] God's bride in Trinidad and every church
[1:34:08] had to come under this move well he had
[1:34:11] to move on you know because that's not
[1:34:13] in the word that's a man feelings that's
[1:34:16] a man idea that's a man thought and
[1:34:18] thinking that's not God thoughts God
[1:34:20] thoughts is this the bride had not a
[1:34:22] Revival yet amen

[1:34:26] manifestation of God to stir the
[1:34:29] bride he will send it he promised it
[1:34:33] that's all we have to say it's on its
[1:34:35] way because he promised it it didn't
[1:34:38] happen me yet it's on his way it it
[1:34:41] happened it past me it happen it past us
[1:34:44] so what we are foolish version what we
[1:34:47] must sit down and cry and die but I am
[1:34:50] saying the god that spoke to that
[1:34:52] Prophet don't t wait for it m come up

[1:34:59] can wrap up here glory to God hallelujah
[1:35:02] praise God praise God praise God
[1:35:05] hallelujah praise God overcome means to
[1:35:10] recognize the devil and at every one of
[1:35:13] his tricks lots of people said there's
[1:35:16] no devil it's just a thought don't you
[1:35:18] believe that there's a real devil he's
[1:35:21] just as real as you are or anybody a
[1:35:23] real devil and you must recognize him
[1:35:26] real you must know he's a devil and then
[1:35:29] at the same time you recognize him know
[1:35:31] that he's a devil and he's against you
[1:35:34] to overcome you must recognize that the
[1:35:37] god in
[1:35:38] you is greater and mightier than he is
[1:35:43] so he is saying that we have to graduate
[1:35:44] from saying God is powerful God is great
[1:35:48] for you getting a revelation what's in
[1:35:50] you is greater than the devil out there
[1:35:53] he fell from heaven and you connected to
[1:35:55] God oh my brother BR I'll close with
[1:35:58] this one quote no I can't close
[1:36:03] yet we almost there we almost there
[1:36:06] remember Christ in the true church is a
[1:36:08] continuation of the book of Acts The
[1:36:10] Book of Revelation shows how the
[1:36:12] Antichrist Spirit the spirit now would
[1:36:14] come into the church the message and
[1:36:16] defile it making it lukew the message
[1:36:18] formal in the message and Powerless in
[1:36:20] the message it exposes Satan revealing
[1:36:23] works praise God isn't that right he
[1:36:26] said he cannot stand it he knows if the
[1:36:28] people get the true revelation of the
[1:36:31] true church what she is what she stands
[1:36:34] for and that she can do the Greater
[1:36:37] Works she will be an invincible Army if
[1:36:40] they get a true Revelation Hallelujah of
[1:36:43] what of the two Spirits working in the
[1:36:45] framework of the church
[1:36:49] Hallelujah and by God's spirit discern
[1:36:53] and with
[1:36:54] stand
[1:36:59] is I take a picture of
[1:37:02] him send us on WhatsApp no
[1:37:05] discern and with if you discern it stand
[1:37:08] up against it resist it fight it back
[1:37:11] you have to glory to God watch this here
[1:37:15] deser and withand the anr spirit Satan
[1:37:17] will be P before her he will be
[1:37:19] definitely tarted today as when Christ
[1:37:22] with stod his every effort to gain power
[1:37:24] desert Satan hates Revelation but we
[1:37:26] love it with true Revelation in our
[1:37:28] lives the Gates of Hell shall not preval
[1:37:31] against it Oh Glory to God I'm going to
[1:37:35] close but I have something very
[1:37:37] important that I need to share with you
[1:37:39] because you see after all we wrestling
[1:37:41] against the Flesh and Blood against
[1:37:43] Prince of power and then we have been
[1:37:44] exalted now to put on the whole armor
[1:37:47] and the whole armor is to be able to
[1:37:49] withstand in that evil day having done
[1:37:51] all to S and it came with a question
[1:37:54] have you done all this
[1:37:56] stand you see having done all the stand
[1:37:59] then he could stand all right so watch
[1:38:02] if you are not dressed correctly you
[1:38:05] will be vulnerable to the attacks of the
[1:38:06] enemy you can't go with a little backp
[1:38:08] hats and hat going backwards like that
[1:38:11] is a helmet they get there all right put
[1:38:13] on the whole armor of God without the
[1:38:15] whole armor you'll be vulnerable the
[1:38:18] whole armor or the full armor consists
[1:38:20] of many parts you can't have one part
[1:38:23] and say that you addressed our faith our
[1:38:26] faith our faith see which part that is
[1:38:29] it have other parts it have defensive
[1:38:32] parts of the armor and have the active
[1:38:36] parts of the armor so watch the full
[1:38:39] armor consists of many parts and you can
[1:38:41] have one part and you canot say you
[1:38:43] addressed each part is for a specific
[1:38:46] purpose the weapons of our Warfare are
[1:38:49] not carnal the first one is the Bible
[1:38:52] call it
[1:38:54] uh having your Lo good about with truth
[1:38:56] that's around your waist that's like a
[1:38:59] belt first thing is truth isn't that
[1:39:02] right and that truth means an absence of
[1:39:04] pretense an absence of hypocrisy he
