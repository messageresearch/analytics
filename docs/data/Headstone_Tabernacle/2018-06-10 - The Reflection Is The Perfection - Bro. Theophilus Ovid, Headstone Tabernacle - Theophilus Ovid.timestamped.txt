[1:06:06] scriptures and text and context and
[1:06:08] whatever but it take the Holy Spirit to
[1:06:10] really bring a revelation inspiration
[1:06:13] and transformation to the lives of the
[1:06:15] people and we invite you the Living Word
[1:06:17] to come forth this morning and speak to
[1:06:19] our hearts and make your would manifest
[1:06:21] make your with alive and quickly to your
[1:06:23] people may your grace drop down Lord and
[1:06:26] see the needs of the people and minister
[1:06:28] to the needs father granted Lord we wait
[1:06:30] on you in Jesus and we ask it amen and
[1:06:34] amen you will be seated
[1:06:35] oh praise the Lord is good to be in the
[1:06:38] house of God it's great to be in his
[1:06:41] presence Oh blessed be the name of the
[1:06:44] Lord our title this morning the
[1:06:46] reflection is the perfection that's the
[1:06:49] title of this morning the reflection is
[1:06:52] the perfection and I want to say I was
[1:06:55] pleased here on this it to be perfect we
[1:06:59] were pleased here on this earth
[1:07:01] to be perfect not to feel not to fall
[1:07:07] that's what our fathers did that's what
[1:07:10] Adam did that's what Eve did they fell
[1:07:13] and because they fell we born in a
[1:07:16] fallen condition but Christ came and he
[1:07:20] came now to replace what a change or the
[1:07:23] transformed that whole scenario of what
[1:07:25] happened back there do you believe that
[1:07:27] so I believe in a sifting time at time
[1:07:32] to see who will to stand the test under
[1:07:34] the trial by the word it has been a word
[1:07:38] time a reproach of the word time a
[1:07:42] wilderness time a trying time a time of
[1:07:45] teaching a time of prophecy because when
[1:07:48] the time of manifestation comes in over
[1:07:51] all glory does God have to have a see
[1:07:54] time and have to have a harvest time it
[1:07:57] have to have a see time and after the
[1:07:59] rain time it after at the time of
[1:08:01] Revelation have to have the time of
[1:08:03] manifestation we have been living in the
[1:08:05] time of Revelation and know about the
[1:08:07] transition into the time of
[1:08:09] manifestation we have been living under
[1:08:11] the ministry of the word but we are
[1:08:13] about to transition into the ministry of
[1:08:15] the spirit or glory to God because to go
[1:08:19] back to perfection you have to go before
[1:08:21] the beginning because it beginning is
[1:08:24] the creation of time and every team have
[1:08:26] a beginning have an end then I'm gonna
[1:08:28] go into perfection it had no beginning
[1:08:30] it had no ending well glory to God so
[1:08:33] before the word before the beginning
[1:08:35] there was spirit because in the
[1:08:37] beginning was the word but before I was
[1:08:39] where there was spirit in the beginning
[1:08:42] was the word
[1:08:42] before there was a winner was assort and
[1:08:45] you were in those thoughts you were in
[1:08:48] God thoughts that is the reason you were
[1:08:50] here this morning
[1:08:51] Oh glory to God because you're part of
[1:08:53] the thoughts of God all glory does
[1:08:56] gautham because they bypass the word you
[1:08:58] have to fight in the test but that is
[1:08:59] what you were placed here for
[1:09:01] or blow it up because you buy trash away
[1:09:04] buddy because you might pass your Co for
[1:09:06] me you were pleased to be tried stop
[1:09:09] complaining you a place to be tested
[1:09:11] stop complaining you replaced to be home
[1:09:13] to be pleased to be shaped you'd be
[1:09:16] placed to be confirmed after this battle
[1:09:26] is over after this time is over we go
[1:09:30] back to where we came from we go back to
[1:09:33] the original state back in that atomic
[1:09:35] condition back to the Garden of Eden
[1:09:39] [Applause]
[1:09:51] you see a spring of Prayer here and he
[1:09:54] saved you from the world saying let us
[1:09:55] lay aside Lord every toil of the day
[1:09:58] every care of this life all the way from
[1:10:01] the janitor to the pasta that there will
[1:10:04] be nothing in our minds now but be
[1:10:06] waiting listening reverently for the
[1:10:10] Holy Spirit to speak to us that we might
[1:10:13] accomplish something good to know more
[1:10:17] of d by our gathering together for Lord
[1:10:20] truly that's why we come on this hot day
[1:10:23] speak to us should I live in word let
[1:10:26] the Living Word dwell in us abide in us
[1:10:29] that we might be shaped and formed not
[1:10:34] to the world but to be transformed by
[1:10:37] the renewing of our spirit into the form
[1:10:40] of the Son of God
[1:10:42] o our hearts tremble when we think and
[1:10:46] the joy floods our soul to know that we
[1:10:49] can be called sons and daughters of God
[1:10:52] and we stand on the very brim of his
[1:10:56] second coming on all nations and
[1:10:58] kingdoms quivering under our feet all
[1:11:01] things of the world is vanishing but
[1:11:03] knowing that someday he shall come and
[1:11:05] take us to a kingdom they shall never be
[1:11:07] an end and it'll never be moved and to
[1:11:10] think that we are now the subjects of
[1:11:13] that Kingdom Oh God circumcise our heart
[1:11:16] and ears today by the holy spirit to the
[1:11:19] washing of the water by the word for we
[1:11:22] ask it in his name for his glory amen
[1:11:25] what could we give the Lord amen
[1:11:29] I'm not prayer the Prophet three okay
[1:11:32] let's get down now quickly from
[1:11:36] fundamental foundation of feet for the
[1:11:38] manner when he was here in it I see this
[1:11:41] may be out of repetition I don't mean it
[1:11:43] that way
[1:11:43] I've said it before but let's look at
[1:11:46] his life a few moments and see what type
[1:11:48] of person he was then you can have an
[1:11:51] idea of what he should be today when he
[1:11:54] was here on earth he was a perfect
[1:11:56] example of everything of the Godhead he
[1:11:59] was the fullness of the Godhead bodily
[1:12:01] in Christ was God the body of Jesus was
[1:12:05] only the tabernacle of God
[1:12:08] it's where Almighty God Himself lived
[1:12:11] and dwelt in a human being you believe
[1:12:15] that don't you you have to be saved you
[1:12:17] have to believe that he was Daisy
[1:12:20] himself made flesh here on earth to
[1:12:24] manifest here we go his love to the
[1:12:26] people and to take away the sin of the
[1:12:30] earth he came here in order or here we
[1:12:33] go that he could anchor debt in his own
[1:12:36] body because once you're born of a woman
[1:12:40] you wanna die so he came to take this
[1:12:43] thing of that and hold it to himself
[1:12:50] because once he take it they don't have
[1:12:53] to have set you know more so the
[1:12:57] songwriter said death hath no power over
[1:13:00] the blood wash ones all that matters is
[1:13:04] not the myth this is not to get too real
[1:13:06] Pentecostal this is enough to get to
[1:13:09] dancing death hath no power over the
[1:13:14] blood wash once no one deposit debt
[1:13:17] where is your sting
[1:13:18] grave where is your victory
[1:13:21] [Applause]
[1:13:26] as the first time that felt ashamed
[1:13:30] first time man could talk back to death
[1:13:33] first romantic challenge yet because of
[1:13:37] what Jesus did Calvary he came to take
[1:13:40] that and anchor it and because he live
[1:13:46] [Applause]
[1:13:53] do you get it he took that he died but
[1:13:59] he rose and when he rose we rose with
[1:14:02] him
[1:14:03] that's my port to see your death where
[1:14:05] is your sting Jesus took the sting of
[1:14:08] the death yet still moving along but you
[1:14:12] don't have the sting or give the Lord a
[1:14:15] shout the wages of sin is death and
[1:14:19] because man sinned he was subject to
[1:14:22] death but now this morning we are
[1:14:26] subject to the resurrection power of
[1:14:29] Jesus Christ
[1:14:30] we'll give the Lord our show this very
[1:14:34] day
[1:14:35] [Applause]
[1:14:46] he came on it
[1:14:48] - anchor debt in his own body he can
[1:14:52] anchor sickness his own body that is why
[1:14:56] the Bible say by His stripes you were
[1:14:58] healed because he handled your sickness
[1:15:01] he handle your diabetes the high blood
[1:15:04] pressure your female condition your
[1:15:06] heartache your cancer your humor your
[1:15:08] also we handle all of that
[1:15:10] Oh give the Lord a shout that's right is
[1:15:14] healing in the name of Jesus there is
[1:15:19] power in the name of Jesus
[1:15:22] [Applause]
[1:15:30] he is here
[1:15:32] wherever the word as years because he
[1:15:35] underworld is the same do you have the
[1:15:37] word with you he is with you do you have
[1:15:41] the word in you he's in you he's in his
[1:15:44] own words he moves with his word he
[1:15:47] moves by his word he has to confirm his
[1:15:50] word oh he loves to vindicate his word
[1:15:53] he loves to reveal himself or give the
[1:15:56] Lord a shout or one of these days you
[1:15:59] know get on who you are and it will come
[1:16:01] out your nonsense you will get to new
[1:16:03] you are and it will come out your lack
[1:16:05] of confidence you will captain who we

[1:16:15] faith that no weapon former can't you
[1:16:17] bring the prosper even have the
[1:16:20] assurance of faith but nothing present

[1:16:25] connecting to your regional and state
[1:16:27] that you hadn't God

[1:17:05] to be on you he took upon it himself
[1:17:12] everybody should be Shelton
[1:17:14] nobody should not be watching mascara
[1:17:17] because that should be on you he took
[1:17:22] himself

[1:38:59] [Applause]
[1:39:02] and brought Justin his sons to see if
[1:39:04] they will stay with that word because
[1:39:08] when you receive the word you become the
[1:39:10] word then the spirit makes you the
[1:39:12] living would that is why Jesus saw no
[1:39:22] need to use Godhead power on the devil
[1:39:25] in the wilderness he just said it is
[1:39:28] written it is written it is also written
[1:39:31] take that and see you next and met
[1:39:34] wrongs and walked away and he was God's

[1:40:01] who sent him nothing at all just silence
[1:40:05] 18 years written to commented ministry
[1:40:09] 18 years instead to wait because John
[1:40:11] has come on the scene yet 18 years and
[1:40:14] wait until John come another blasts and
[1:40:16] boss and rip open same as one standing
[1:40:20] among you he's gonna baptize you with
[1:40:23] the Holy Ghost and with fire John I'm a
[1:40:27] direct message from the kingdom I am
[1:40:30] sent to make away Oh Clawd horrid King
[1:40:33] is coming
[1:40:35] Oh blowing Oh God
[1:40:38] John already on the same llaves witness
[1:40:41] the one upon whom that does come and
[1:40:43] remain that's the one
[1:40:45] John John seat John see Dublin and this
[1:40:48] one I take off Dublin and that one on
[1:40:51] take off even hoodia
[1:40:52] he's just watching for same but when

[1:40:57] because he is the lamb lamb and does
[1:41:00] moving together wherever Jesus going doc
[1:41:04] going to John see the latter develop on
[1:41:07] Jesus he knew that was Messiah he said
[1:41:10] behold the lamb of God Oh hallelujah
[1:41:14] Jesus under the anointing of that lamb
[1:41:19] say you yes you I could baptize you but
[1:41:22] behooves us to fulfill all righteousness
[1:41:25] gee I got baptized and then John solemn
[1:41:28] disciple is lazy man guess what he can
[1:41:31] force them someone with Jesus some say
[1:41:34] but John they love brother John
[1:41:36] and they forever remain John's disciples
[1:41:43] but those who were looking at it
[1:41:46] prophecy know that John came to
[1:41:48] introduce Messiah and when you capture
[1:41:51] the introduction you forget the
[1:41:54] introducer
[1:41:58] didn't get that when you're kept this is
[1:42:03] that you follow that
[1:42:05] [Applause]
[1:42:11] so Jesus speaking to his disciples
[1:42:14] naughty church members his disciples
[1:42:17] abide in me and I in you here is mystery
[1:42:24] as the branch cannot bear fruit of
[1:42:26] itself except it abide in the vine no
[1:42:29] more can ye except ye abide in me I am
[1:42:34] the vine you add the patches he that
[1:42:38] abideth in me I am the mail
[1:42:40] you are the female you were produced
[1:42:43] food for me through the bride and by the
[1:42:52] bride will be fulfilled all so that
[1:43:01] bride has to be connected to define
[1:43:05] itself not some church not some
[1:43:10] denomination not some Sahagun comes in
[1:43:13] local or foreign but the divine itself
[1:43:18] [Applause]
[1:43:20] not some headquarters divine I am divine
[1:43:25] who's talking Jesus talking you are the
[1:43:28] branch let's continue what I am the vine
[1:43:32] you are the branches he that abideth in
[1:43:34] me and I in him the same bringeth forth
[1:43:35] much fruit for without me you can do
[1:43:38] nothing if a man abide not in me he is
[1:43:42] cast forth as a branch and is withered
[1:43:45] and men gather them and caused him to be
[1:43:47] born Danny when don't you see if he
[1:43:51] abide in me and my words abide in you or
[1:43:55] praise the name of the Lord
[1:43:56] so the same Holy Spirit that see if the
[1:43:58] Lutheran's sign Phi the Methodist
[1:44:00] Baptist Pentecostal is now set in an
[1:44:02] order the coming of the Lord Jesus
[1:44:05] settled in order because in case you
[1:44:10] didn't know God is a God of order he's
[1:44:15] not a disorganized disorderly God we
[1:44:18] scratch miroku's again no no no he's a
[1:44:20] God of water he put the Sun here the
[1:44:22] moon here that tried to be govern here

[1:44:27] what is he did next twenty hundred years
[1:44:29] how much years was the detail what
[1:44:31] Sunday falling on because God have an
[1:44:33] order everybody can see the order of God

[1:44:39] order it has the order of his church and
[1:44:41] for his order for his people and the
[1:44:43] order for your life so Dolan another
[1:44:46] confusion God is not the author of
[1:44:48] confusion
[1:44:50] he's a code of order that's why he
[1:44:53] released the angel of God on the earth
[1:44:55] to set things in order for the coming of
[1:44:59] the Lord
[1:44:59] everything will being set for the coming
[1:45:01] of the Lord Oh God

[1:54:34] yes as that test when the authorities

[1:55:15] lie when an call come the son
[1:55:20] said daddy should I tell them I not here
[1:55:21] to the disease of the spreading this is
[1:55:31] man on the pressure
[1:55:36] maybe you not under pressure but this is
[1:55:39] man on the test when you understand that
[1:55:49] you realize this thing is real I was
[1:55:54] telling about a Clarence the bull test
[1:55:55] coming people people don't know what
[1:56:01] that test the bull tears coming but over
[1:56:05] what is the Bolton's explain the
[1:56:07] Bolton's
[1:56:10] Branham was going to prefer a sick
[1:56:13] person he had a cause I feel he forget
[1:56:16] an athlete of a killable know that
[1:56:18] represents all killable because he
[1:56:20] killed before Boram leave his gun a
[1:56:23] defense walking to the field I'm seeing
[1:56:27] the killable he say if he had the gun
[1:56:31] should be belong pay for the bill but he
[1:56:34] forgot the gun God allow him to forget
[1:56:37] the gun so now is he
[1:56:39] and killable well as far as the killable
[1:56:42] I say the killer broke a talk he say
[1:56:43] listen sir heal my territory way doing
[1:56:45] it I go alone nobody on my grounds but
[1:56:51] if you put it back on by the ban on now
[1:56:52] Adam had dominion over everything that
[1:56:58] creepeth on the earth
[1:57:01] so this is a bull that ultra order
[1:57:05] because man fell that is why he crazy
[1:57:11] because man fell olam animals gone
[1:57:13] off-key could a masterful but his son
[1:57:17] who's about to become a master there's a
[1:57:20] son who's about to come back in Adamek
[1:57:23] position to deal with that boom
[1:57:26] [Applause]
[1:57:27] [Music]
[1:57:32] but I don't see something key move in it
[1:57:36] was not taught is it reversed over
[1:57:40] support come to me this isn't you had to
[1:57:44] talk to the Berliner and you have to
[1:57:46] talk to people in a language they will
[1:57:49] understand so you can drop it mystery
[1:57:53] new new mystery John no mystery you can
[1:57:58] say bull
[1:57:58] I read his last night you can't talk
[1:58:01] that to the bull it was love that came
[1:58:04] of about a brand that is what the
[1:58:07] animals understand that is what they
[1:58:11] cannot bring us love itself is a power
[1:58:15] that power of love came upon that profit
[1:58:20] and it's fundable he said bull going
[1:58:23] light on I come in the past you to
[1:58:26] preface it under bull turn around lie
[1:58:29] down where I'm walk through Prince could
[1:58:32] that killable is coming Oh get a Lord a
[1:58:37] shout
[1:58:38] [Applause]
[1:58:43] [Music]
[1:58:46] so all em brethren with the cuckoo and
[1:58:49] crazy revolutions when the bull come we
[1:58:53] will see all the three with that s
[1:58:55] because that bull is comment follow more
[1:58:59] tests coming but a man almost si with
[1:59:01] power you have been given power a test
[1:59:04] coming for you to become in the church
[1:59:06] making love carry on holy sweet drop
[1:59:08] them if it's a blind they'll be blind if
[1:59:10] he said that they will die whatever you
[1:59:12] see it what happened
[1:59:15] God can't give them let us know them
[1:59:18] optional because in the door like a head
[1:59:21] see me he disappear in and name a Jesus
[1:59:24] Christ
[1:59:25] I like him what God can lose power and
[1:59:33] that kind of behavior to show you that
[1:59:35] butter and honey character for power he
[1:59:38] watch he had it listed drop down blind
[1:59:41] buying whatever you see and he said I
[1:59:45] forgive you I think this if I'm Lincoln
[1:59:52] or novella see any man could go to
[1:59:54] adversity if they really want to see
[1:59:57] what's in a man give them power anybody
[2:00:01] could go to pressure mind let's take
[2:00:03] plenty pressure but if you want to see
[2:00:05] what really in somebody give them power
[2:00:08] and see how they manage power and that
[2:00:12] is why you have to be tested because God
[2:00:14] want to put power back into man real
[2:00:18] power permanent power Holy Ghost power
[2:00:23] redeeming power what powers and Jesus to
[2:00:27] go after the woman at a well when nobody
[2:00:29] would even stop to talk to that woman
[2:00:30] when she was growing enough virgins what
[2:00:33] couldn't go she had to go when which is
[2:00:35] not here nobody will talk to his woman
[2:00:37] who want to talk to her woman who's
[2:00:39] gonna redeem that woman who won't even
[2:00:40] speak to see that woman to show her that
[2:00:43] she can live had and that nobody would
[2:00:45] do that but Jesus still went after her
[2:00:47] because her name was in the book
[2:00:51] it take a love to do that
[2:00:53] [Applause]
[2:00:56] I'm brother George can't really talk

[2:09:43] the Spirit of God will raise up a stand
[2:09:45] against it not my book not more taste we
[2:09:48] have a 40 plus years we need a spirit to
[2:09:51] raise a standard right what we need is
[2:09:56] the Spirit of God with what is it he is
[2:09:58] pouring in his spirit then those are
[2:10:00] arresting the young in the grave I
[2:10:01] crying hold on hold on how much longer
[2:10:03] God is waiting on you and me the church
[2:10:06] is written on you only adoption time
[2:10:09] when God can pour into us his fullness
[2:10:14] his power his resurrection Lord what is
[2:10:19] the adoption time adoption times means
[2:10:22] sons ready to be approved
[2:10:25] [Applause]
[2:10:27] that means the testing time is over
[2:10:33] prove what that they could stay with the
[2:10:36] word
[2:10:37] [Applause]
[2:10:39] let's continue when God send Holy Ghost
[2:10:43] and knocks at a man's door and he
[2:10:45] deliberately turned it down some time
[2:10:47] you're gonna turn now for the last time
[2:10:48] and then you won't be a privileged
[2:10:50] character you can sit in church
[2:10:51] listen to the gospel and I agree with
[2:10:54] that gospel you might do that just
[2:10:56] sympathize in village
[2:10:58] in the Old Testament there are a Jubilee
[2:11:00] year and where it sounded trumpet and no
[2:11:03] matter how many Jew buddies come along
[2:11:05] is that man didn't want to go free he
[2:11:07] didn't want to return this land he was
[2:11:09] kept there as a slave isn't that right
[2:11:11] and the same thing in a natural applies
[2:11:14] to the spiritual if we as inheritance of
[2:11:16] eternal life we hear the gospel I know
[2:11:18] it sure one rejected or refused to do it
[2:11:20] or listen to it we take on a mark of the
[2:11:22] beast I like how he Frieza
[2:11:24] taking on the mark of the beast now
[2:11:27] somebody said there's going to be a mark
[2:11:29] of the beast they're gonna come some day
[2:11:30] let me tell you it's already come get a
[2:11:35] stinger as soon as the Holy Ghost begins
[2:11:37] to fall the mark of the beast begin to
[2:11:39] take place say see we have all things
[2:11:45] connected with judgment and restoration
[2:11:46] with the corrosion of the Gentile
[2:11:48] dispensation for God to go back to the
[2:11:50] Jews the capstone coming to the bride
[2:11:53] and that begins judgment begins to the
[2:11:55] Gentile Age salvation to the Jews
[2:11:57] 144,000 to receive the battle Holy Ghost
[2:11:59] Gentiles message going to the Jews of
[2:12:02] the Holy Ghost they receiving the seal
[2:12:04] of God angel from the east with the seal
[2:12:06] but before they are Steve one of the
[2:12:08] Selah bride you have to be sealed up we
[2:12:11] might have to be sealed in that nothing
[2:12:14] could touch this bride not even yet
[2:12:17] [Applause]
[2:12:19] listen death don't have the authority to
[2:12:22] touch this break I'm talking about
[2:12:27] living right because living bride has to
[2:12:30] be translated come on now you should be
[2:12:36] the bigger shock than that somebody said
[2:12:49] no they're gonna be a mark of the beast
[2:12:50] is gonna come someday let me tell you
[2:12:51] I've already come as soon as the world
[2:12:53] will begin to fall the mark of the beast
[2:12:55] begin to take place you only have two
[2:12:57] things one of them is accepted take the

[2:16:50] stimulation with it some excitement with
[2:16:53] it
[2:16:53] [Applause]
[2:17:03] but abandoned when the Pentacles aside
[2:17:06] to move out progressed Leon's Western
[2:17:08] saw the movie from Lutheran's okay
[2:17:12] he said no much you have to move out of
[2:17:14] it we cannot do that we have got to
[2:17:16] follow every day every hour of the day
[2:17:19] every step of the way watch we have got
[2:17:22] to be led by the Lord Jesus and if we
[2:17:25] don't we take on an organizational life
[2:17:28] so here seeing that your life have to
[2:17:31] become daily serving the Lord not Sun
[2:17:34] daily not weekly not by wiki no daily
[2:17:40] take up the cross and follow me
[2:17:42] daily worthy of me if you don't do that
[2:17:47] you take on organizational life so a
[2:17:50] bunch of people in this message never
[2:17:51] organizes in life
[2:17:53] they were the churches operate they
[2:17:55] would choose just do but what about the
[2:17:57] personal connection not usurper ha use a
[2:18:00] poster with your Lord
[2:18:04] he said we have got to be led by the
[2:18:06] Lord Jesus and if we don't we take on an
[2:18:10] elevational life and a life that doesn't
[2:18:12] follow Christ daily is not worthy a
[2:18:16] Christian is not a tool or some kind of
[2:18:19] mechanical wrench to a great big
[2:18:20] religious regime a Christian is not some
[2:18:24] kind of tool that keep a religious
[2:18:26] organization moving a Christian that is
[2:18:29] not a Christian a Christian is to be
[2:18:32] christ-like cannot select like long term
[2:18:38] you're here right
[2:18:39] you forget but that really is a
[2:18:41] Christian is not somebody who say
[2:18:43] hallelujah go and constantly but next
[2:18:44] day they say glory to God on big stones
[2:18:50] felt in the neighborhood because I read
[2:18:53] in anger and temper on somebody who
[2:18:55] affected them that is not Christianity a
[2:18:59] Christian is to be christ-like and a
[2:19:02] Christian cannot be a Christian until
[2:19:05] Christ's coming to the man the life of
[2:19:08] Christ in him then it produces the life
[2:19:12] that Christ live and you do the things
[2:19:14] that Christ it what am I talking about
[2:19:19] a personal relationship to Christ what
[2:19:24] is it is your life worthy of the gospel
[2:19:28] speaking about Jesus he was so much he
[2:19:31] was so much in the word tell him Ana
[2:19:33] would become himself same thing he
[2:19:35] didn't have to fuss he knew he and the
[2:19:38] wood was the same he know that he was
[2:19:41] God's wood made manifest and God's
[2:19:43] command would finally conquer the world
[2:19:46] he wasn't fussy and stew he despot words
[2:19:50] my word and God was the same so you
[2:19:52] could say hell it will pass away but my
[2:19:54] words cannot pass away
[2:19:56] no not those priests they were so
[2:19:59] educated and polished having all these
[2:20:01] rigged dignitaries that wasn't life
[2:20:03] would in the gospel he was worthy of the
[2:20:05] gospel so much that God said this is my
[2:20:07] beloved Son in whom I am pleased he I am
[2:20:11] no watch he knew his will conquer the
[2:20:14] world
[2:20:15] not the people of this day as a button
[2:20:17] ethics they are frayed here we go
[2:20:22] they are frayed to take the promises of
[2:20:24] God to its men huge organization should
[2:20:29] are freed to take the challenge of God
[2:20:32] scripture I love it I love it I love it
[2:20:35] God put description as a challenge my
[2:20:41] brother I say when God is your vision
[2:20:43] how do we begin and we had we seen the
[2:20:45] wrong in if God gear if you say Kogi a
[2:20:49] vision to get a car that tiny because I
[2:20:53] people without vision getting cars so
[2:20:56] that not a big vision when a man like
[2:20:59] Abram wanna child God see social like
[2:21:01] only stars sure shall I see be when
[2:21:04] Abram will leave from that experience of
[2:21:07] hearing from God I said I testify well
[2:21:10] the Lord told me count the stars I just
[2:21:13] let you know what the Lord told me and
[2:21:15] he told me so shall my seed be and any
[2:21:19] person watchin Abram like cookie I even
[2:21:21] me like you know is he for real because
[2:21:24] Syria is already so old is he for real
[2:21:27] and and the Bible say he he staggered
[2:21:30] not at the promise of God through
[2:21:34] unbelief that means Abram Vance was
[2:21:37] working this vast was restructuring his
[2:21:39] balance was working this seed fast was
[2:21:42] working but was strong in faith that's
[2:21:47] how I know your revelation you'll be
[2:21:49] strong and praised even glory to God
