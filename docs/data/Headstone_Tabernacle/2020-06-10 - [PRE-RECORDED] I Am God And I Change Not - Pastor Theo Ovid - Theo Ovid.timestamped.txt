[23:19] this second epistle beloved I now write
[23:22] unto you in both which I stir up your
[23:24] pure Minds may we have remembrance that
[23:26] he may be mindful of the words which was
[23:29] spoken before by the holy prophets of
[23:31] the commandments of us and of our
[23:32] pastors of our Lord Jesus Lord and
[23:34] Savior knowing this first that there
[23:37] shall come in the last days scoffers
[23:39] walking after their own lusts saying
[23:42] where is the promise of his coming for
[23:44] since the father's fell asleep all
[23:46] things continue as the world from the
[23:49] beginning of the creation for this day
[23:52] willingly are ignorant of that by the
[23:55] Word of God the heavens were of old and
[23:58] the earth standing out of the water and
[24:00] in the water whereby the world that then
[24:04] was being overflowed with water perished
[24:06] but that the heavens and the earth which
[24:10] are now by the same word a kept in store
[24:13] reserved unto fire against the day of
[24:16] judgment and perdition of ungodly men
[24:19] but beloved be not ignorant of this
[24:22] wanting that one day with the Lord is a
[24:26] thousand years and a thousand years as
[24:28] one day the Lord is not slack concerning
[24:30] his promise as some men count slackness
[24:32] but is long-suffering to us-ward not
[24:35] willing that any should perish but that
[24:38] all should come to repentance but the
[24:40] day of the Lord shall come as a thief in
[24:42] the night in which the heavens shall
[24:43] pass away with a great noise and the
[24:46] elements shall melt with fervent heat
[24:47] the earth also and the works that out
[24:49] the Aaron shall be built up here we go
[24:52] seeing then that all these things shall
[24:56] be dissolved what manner of persons
[24:59] ought he to be in all holy conversation
[25:01] and godliness looking for and hasting
[25:06] unto the common of the day of God
[25:07] wherein the heavens being on fire shall
[25:10] be dissolved and the elements shall
[25:12] never feel the need nevertheless we look
[25:16] we according to his promise look for a
[25:19] new heaven a new earth wherein dwelleth
[25:21] righteousness
[25:22] wherefore beloved seeing ye look for
[25:25] such things be diligent that you may
[25:27] found of him in peace without spot
[25:32] and blameless malachi tree one verse
[25:35] verse six and it reads for i am god i
[25:39] changed not stop right there and we go
[25:44] to hebrews chapter 6
[25:55] we didn't from verse 10 for God is not
[26:01] unrighteous to forget your work and
[26:03] labor of love which you have sure
[26:04] towards his name in that you have
[26:07] ministered to the Saints under Minister
[26:09] we desire that every one of you do show
[26:12] the same diligence to the full assurance
[26:13] of hope unto the end that you be not
[26:17] slothful but followers of them who true
[26:20] feet and patience inherit the promises
[26:24] for when God made promise to Abraham
[26:26] because he could not swear by no greater
[26:30] he swore by himself saying surely
[26:34] blessing I will bless thee multiplying I
[26:37] will multiply thee so after he had there
[26:40] we go patiently endured he obtained the
[26:44] promise for men verily swear by the
[26:46] greater and an ode for confirmation is
[26:49] to them an end of all strife wherein God
[26:53] willing more abundantly
[26:56] - shown to the ears of promise the
[26:59] immutability of his counsel confirm it
[27:02] by an oath that by two immutable things
[27:06] in which is impossible for God to lie
[27:09] that we might have a strong consolation
[27:12] who have fled for refuge they lay hold
[27:15] upon the hope that's before us let's bow

[27:28] bless you thank you for that message not
[27:30] sunday appreciate a message what shall
[27:36] we say to these things if God be for us
[27:39] who can be against us and let us go on
[27:43] to perfection
[27:44] amen shall we tango for that an
[27:46] inspiration a brought light service I
[27:49] was a real blessing to us under the
[27:51] church so are you ready this morning for
[27:53] the words ready for God to stick to your
[27:57] hearts I am still waiting on him Oh
[28:00] hallelujah one day we're gonna get to
[28:03] that spot to say but you know what I'm
[28:04] waitin on
[28:06] hallelujah praise God but this morning I
[28:08] saw upon my heart I have a title and
[28:11] that title was taken from the scriptures
[28:14] in Malachi 3:6 the title is I am God and
[28:17] I change not this is not the overt
[28:20] saying I am God no just want to make
[28:23] sure that very very clear this is the
[28:25] scriptures hidden I am God and I changed
[28:28] not and the inspiration the coming of
[28:32] judgment that's the inspiration the
[28:35] coming of judgment when we use the term
[28:38] the coming of the Lord and Jesus coming
[28:40] again he's not coming to halo the world
[28:44] he's not coming to smile with mankind
[28:47] he's coming in judgment that's what the
[28:51] coming of the Lord is don't forget that
[28:53] now he's not coming to bring apples and
[28:55] grapes he's coming in judgment
[29:00] hallelujah
[29:01] I'll read and this is from the
[29:04] unchangeable word of God but aberlin
[29:05] given a story here testimony a young
[29:09] lady out in Oregon was trying to discuss
[29:10] with me one time she belonged to a
[29:12] church where that Mary was the boss over
[29:14] and she was talking about I hear she
[29:18] said you mean to tell me in heaven these
[29:22] bunch of idiots like what's going on in
[29:25] the last night when you were preaching
[29:26] will be the people that they really have
[29:29] I said that's what the Bible says she
[29:32] said I said your Blessed Virgin Mary had
[29:35] to go up to Pentecost and receive the
[29:37] Holy Ghost and act like them people did
[29:40] last night or she would have never went
[29:42] to heaven
[29:43] she said that's not so I said let me
[29:45] show you right here in acts 2 where it
[29:48] was so or not Mary got so drunk she
[29:50] staggered like she was drunk in the
[29:52] spirit actually like a drunk person on
[29:54] their Pentecost and if God wouldn't let
[29:56] Mary go home to heaven anything less
[29:59] than how in the world are you gonna make
[30:01] it without that you she let you belong
[30:05] to any choice you want to you'll have to
[30:07] have the same experience the same
[30:09] exactly she said well I wouldn't want to
[30:12] be there I said I don't think you have
[30:14] to worry very much about that
[30:16] I don't think you have very much to
[30:18] worry about that I said no go on and
[30:20] write up a real dirty article of it in
[30:23] the people and I will tell you this does
[30:26] say it the Lord you mark my words down
[30:29] between this and two months from now
[30:32] you'll be dying on the side of the road
[30:35] in an accident and you will remember the
[30:38] words I told you let's continue she
[30:42] never wrote nothing she played a wise
[30:45] trick there I seen her dying no hello
[30:49] this this is important this is very
[30:51] important I seen her dying lean in a car
[30:56] accident and God was given her a chance
[31:00] then but she is smart enough not to
[31:03] write nothing there was nothing in the
[31:06] paper they just let it go that was a
[31:08] smart idea
[31:09] she only save her own life by it God is
[31:12] still God do you understand what
[31:16] happened there the prophet saw a vision
[31:18] of her dying an accident and that vision
[31:22] was dependent upon the action she would
[31:24] take if she wrote that evil article she
[31:27] was gonna be judged she was smile she
[31:30] saved my life I'm not writing article it
[31:32] Pierce to do the right thing and say the
[31:35] right thing it pays to have respects
[31:38] because God is still God I'm a dying a
[31:42] morning but you still God you may get I
[31:45] really paid but he is still God you
[31:47] could do whatever you want to do but
[31:48] here still God you could say a free to
[31:51] do this and you're free to do that
[31:52] but you are not free from the
[31:54] consequences of what you have done
[31:56] [Applause]
[31:58] hallelujah does not free of choice of
[32:01] consequences because nature have laws if
[32:05] you break those laws you pay the penalty
[32:06] of those laws beside free I plant my
[32:09] garden with corn and I thank God I am
[32:11] NOT cleaning no grass I clearly know
[32:15] weeds well you will see some tap corn
[32:17] and you'll get no corn and you're wasted
[32:20] time planting because they lost the
[32:22] other get never wins away from them corn
[32:24] isn't that right and that's because God
[32:29] is God he deserves respects and we have
[32:34] got to respect him and give fear to him
[32:37] and that brings respects and that's why
[32:40] the virus talked about here's the
[32:41] beginning of wisdom to fear God and keep
[32:43] his Commandments the beginning of wisdom
[32:46] isn't that right
[32:47] and God has demanded watch and he we
[32:50] have got to respect him and give fear to
[32:53] him and that brings respect God has
[32:55] demanded that for himself and for all
[32:57] his servants and God demands respects
[33:00] for his servants his servants how we
[33:01] know they're his servants because he's
[33:03] vindicates these servants by his word he
[33:06] takes these servants and make them
[33:07] service of God and prove their servants
[33:10] and by making his wood work through them
[33:13] servants then as I respect that servant
[33:16] you respect God and when you respect
[33:19] when I respect you and you respect me
[33:21] and we respect each other then we are
[33:25] respecting God so you can't claim to
[33:27] respect God and disrespect your brother

[39:13] you know what happen when a person died
[39:15] they would kidney and boughs move she

[39:28] was preaching and God was working with
[39:32] signs and wonders and why die what Jesus
[39:35] said I could say you could talk against
[39:37] this now but the olive will not come

[39:46] this world or the world to come
[39:48] just one word against it that's the
[39:51] gospel that's the word and that's how
[39:54] much we just have to respect Oh

[40:09] handed man in the guard a man was a
[40:11] friend of mine his son-in-law run the
[40:13] garage next door

[40:16] eating a sandwich talking to him about
[40:18] God until the daytime I find somewhere I
[40:21] could good or through the daytime I'd
[40:24] find somewhere where I could go at
[40:25] dinner and time and tried to win us all
[40:27] to Christ that was his dinner hobby
[40:31] don't eat by yourself you gonna even get
[40:34] to win somebody he said mr. Branum he
[40:37] said I was just a boy preacher myself he
[40:39] said mr. Brannon my mother had that kind
[40:41] of religion that hot that religion and
[40:43] tears was running on his cheeks I said
[40:46] how long she'd be going yes she always
[40:48] prayed for me I said that God had hit
[40:51] her prayers is trying to answer them
[40:53] right now for her and this man walked in

[41:23] was hung at your neck and drunk in the
[41:26] depths of the sea and his own son-in-law
[41:29] that very same afternoon run him over

[41:34] and mash him down in the ground you have
[41:35] got to respect God God demands respect
[41:39] he demands it how I could get my
[41:43] testimony for hour after hour I've seen
[41:46] in my lifetime I've seen other countries
[41:48] other parts of the nation so for the
[41:50] things are taking place but to omit that
[41:52] just you'll get the idea of what I'm
[41:55] trying to say to you you must respect it
[41:57] I've seen young people except in the
[41:59] meetings and snicker and laugh in the
[42:01] meeting and less than 24 hours be
[42:03] crushed into the streets

[42:08] Ezekiel 9 the Bible says slay utterly
[42:10] young all male/female little children
[42:14] but come not anyone near with that mark
[42:16] that has nothing to it which church you
[42:18] go to that has that newest denomination
[42:21] it belong to that have to do with the
[42:23] pillar fire and God because God promised
[42:26] alas this Baptist and Methodist and your
[42:28] witness and Peres myself message people

[43:16] husband not husband and special men
[43:18] outside as a close friend not that
[43:20] [Music]
[43:22] because they come to Christ you have to
[43:25] come to the waters of separation
[43:27] something that separates you to know you
[43:30] are mad you are separated unto God
[43:33] [Music]

[57:56] and run him down ridicule him how is
[57:59] that possibly gonna do anything for you
[58:00] he can't I don't say this church but
[58:02] I've seen churches or you got a lovely
[58:04] posture you gotta know he's a human
[58:06] being and yet God has made him his
[58:08] posture the Holy Ghost has made him
[58:10] overseer and then when you got to
[58:11] respect him in that manner listen I no
[58:13] matter what the past is done if you
[58:15] respect him in your heart as got7 God
[58:18] will respect you for doing it God will
[58:24] respect you for doing that
[58:27] so these wars you take these young kids
[58:30] talk about the young people on the army
[58:32] they're the cream of the crop cause they
[58:34] don't know no better knowing discipline
[58:36] army discipline stick a head up the hill
[58:37] let somebody shoot it off and the nation
[58:40] forgets them unless their family come
[58:42] back here
[58:42] many of soldiers but listener is but a
[58:46] man seldom will you find one that will
[58:49] lay down his life for the cause of
[58:51] Christ always think about that statement
[58:56] people find it for money bigger job
[58:58] bigger house want to do this and that
[59:00] and everything else but what about the
[59:02] sacrifice for Christ for God's sake
[59:06] listen they will lay down their life
[59:10] because of Christ
[59:11] you wouldn't even crawl out of a shade
[59:13] tree to go to church won't even get out
[59:17] from behind a television long enough to
[59:19] attend a Wednesday night perimeter
[59:21] that's right it's a shame and disgrace
[59:24] that's the reason angels don't visit the
[59:27] churches that's the reason angels don't
[59:32] visit homes you mean in terms of it
[59:35] assumes yes we have got to get down to
[59:39] deep sincerity of this thing that's why
[59:44] is disgusted to see the arrogance of
[59:46] people in this message as if God is
[59:48] obligated to them because they believe
[59:50] God's and a prophet God is not obligated
[59:53] to this with that at all
[59:55] what is obligated to his word because
[59:57] even the dead I believe and tremble so
[1:00:00] we have got the final higher because
[1:00:03] Jesus busted his own disciples and say
[1:00:05] you have to have righteousness bigger
[1:00:07] than love in your own checking your own
[1:00:09] eyes they've got to go beyond that to
[1:00:12] love even your enemies they're cut to go
[1:00:14] beyond that demonstrate that you are the
[1:00:18] higher class that is what this is about
[1:00:23] not to stay where you are but then lift

[1:19:48] explain the world or try to explain the
[1:19:50] word infinite he never had a beginning
[1:19:54] he will never had an end therefore when
[1:19:57] God calling us into act or to make a
[1:20:00] decision the way he acts the decision he
[1:20:03] makes that is forever the same he cannot
[1:20:06] change it because he is perfect now you
[1:20:10] and I could say certain things next year
[1:20:12] we have to change it maybe or do
[1:20:13] something different because we are
[1:20:14] finite we do not normal things but he is
[1:20:17] perfect and his first decision will have
[1:20:21] to be a second decision
[1:20:22] well after me like the first or if you
[1:20:24] make an incision then he is not a cure
[1:20:27] right when you make the first decision
[1:20:27] that will put him as finite as us so
[1:20:31] Kakadu something said of course coach I
[1:20:32] didn't realize it was gonna move soon
[1:20:35] not mean gorgeous Tigers but God can't
[1:20:39] do that so when he speaks his word
[1:20:41] that's why you can say by myself have I
[1:20:44] sworn
[1:20:47] and I could only swear by somebody
[1:20:49] greater than you but there was nobody
[1:20:51] greater than him
[1:20:56] you could only swear by somebody more
[1:20:59] powerful than you but there was nobody
[1:21:01] more powerful on him so he swore by
[1:21:03] himself that he will keep this word of
[1:21:06] promise

[1:22:39] feet
[1:22:40] the next man had come to the same rung
[1:22:42] ask the same questions God has to act
[1:22:44] the same way so God is unchangeable he's

[1:24:58] all and then line and God you can do
[1:25:00] that go to the line
[1:25:02] alright but abandoned I may not have
[1:25:05] fear to make all things that he done
[1:25:07] live again but I will never stand in the
[1:25:11] road of somebody who was fit enough to
[1:25:13] do it I would be thanking God for that
[1:25:16] feat hallelujah
[1:25:18] see the spirit and attitude the Prophet
[1:25:19] had he wouldn't go on hinder anybody who
[1:25:22] was free to step out to believe God I
[1:25:24] can go and record on this tonight if any
[1:25:27] people will take the right mental
[1:25:29] attitude there was any divine promise
[1:25:31] that God has ever made and claim it for
[1:25:33] yours
[1:25:34] here we go
[1:25:36] if you have the right mental attitude of
[1:25:39] any promise that God has made and claim
[1:25:43] it Furby as yours God will bring it to
[1:25:47] pass
[1:25:48] claim your healing claim your

[1:26:09] that get activated happy you happy
[1:26:15] delivered I'm gonna get a break through
[1:26:17] the prison bars gonna open up you gotta
[1:26:20] speak some even now Lord we are you let
[1:26:23] him roll away the stone Lazarus come
[1:26:26] forth so Jesus couldn't go my last verse
[1:26:32] grave and said you're there he's there
[1:26:36] that's not the word we want easier you
[1:26:39] want him to come on from there
[1:26:41] Lazarus come forth you have to speak it
[1:26:45] what are you speaking
[1:26:47] you speak a negative you speak and you
[1:26:50] can make it the speaking you home this
[1:26:52] your wife this your husband this you

[1:27:10] says the word is a seed I saw so and a
[1:27:13] seed if it is a German I'd see that goes
[1:27:15] into the ground then that seed under the
[1:27:18] right condition which Sun and moisture
[1:27:19] will bring forth the life that's in the
[1:27:22] seed so the Word of God if a person take
[1:27:26] it and press it in their heart
[1:27:27] create right atmosphere they're gonna
[1:27:29] produce itself so the key thing is to
[1:27:32] create the right atmosphere and the
[1:27:34] devil is fighting that atmosphere that
[1:27:37] Atma says what you can create create in
[1:27:40] your own home in your own heart you can
[1:27:42] choose not to whole odds you can choose
[1:27:45] not to have a grudge and in your heart
[1:27:47] have a right atmosphere and you're
[1:27:49] waiting upon God I can't bless you
[1:27:56] hallelujah praise God praise God the
[1:28:01] thing it is with people is the way God
[1:28:03] appears many times you want to make an
[1:28:06] idol out of God we ask God for something
[1:28:08] and then he must do it just do it
[1:28:10] when we ask it you get he calleth making
[1:28:16] an idol out of God I see people put I
[1:28:20] know somebody who said cut the Bible I
[1:28:22] think that's about disparate wake up
[1:28:27] early morning call a Bible verse the
[1:28:28] eyes fall on my descriptively day that
[1:28:30] he would our society by blanca mandela
[1:28:36] we're not supposed to play back tips and
[1:28:37] have TV knee touch to pre-paint back
[1:28:39] message cuz i don t coach who she's as
[1:28:42] an idol i said go to you that I wonder
[1:28:48] commanded testimony service listener
[1:28:49] diamond because he I'm not fitted
[1:28:52] another Freda should I'm the exit
[1:28:53] because we're not big and I'm bombing
[1:28:55] and trying to drag anybody's out of here
[1:28:57] especially especially religious ones one
[1:29:01] who know difficult is no more than
[1:29:02] appreciated no more than God himself God
[1:29:05] doesn't have that God have a word for
[1:29:07] you the people sit down and they're
[1:29:10] looking for what they dream that get
[1:29:12] confirmed
[1:29:12] I let the dream ring and the preacher on
[1:29:15] his errand they say they don't show me
[1:29:19] the real they are so important that God
[1:29:26] make sure if you just say that to
[1:29:27] confirm that what is seen is it and it's
[1:29:30] not so what you come here for is to get
[1:29:33] exposed that your life could be changed
[1:29:37] you want God to rip things out of you
[1:29:41] that's not like him
[1:29:43] you want all the hindrances in your life
[1:29:45] that affecting your communication with
[1:29:48] God and with others you want your life
[1:29:51] to be purged and purified
[1:29:54] oh my Logan some issue with some system
[1:29:59] but I said we conclusive here Moses was
[1:30:05] 80 years old almost you might think -
[1:30:09] all for God to deal with he was an old
[1:30:12] man unexpected in his age to be dealt
[1:30:14] with God and he was an unexpected place
[1:30:17] Mount Horeb and on an unexpected way God
[1:30:21] met Moses the way he usually met he
[1:30:24] didn't meet Moses the way usually admit
[1:30:26] men he met him with the pillar of fire
[1:30:28] isn't that right old man strange place
[1:30:33] but that God met him a certain way so no
[1:30:36] sometime he answers a prayer in the way
[1:30:39] he thinks is best
[1:30:41] I remember since that a dream she Jim
[1:30:43] she has grown to some dark waters some
[1:30:45] some some some troubling waters and so
[1:30:47] on and this brown skinned man was
[1:30:49] consoling or whatnot different things I
[1:30:50] don't know what not know she was a real
[1:30:53] a bullhead bullet spirit whenever her
[1:30:57] husband is back Sidon condition she and
[1:30:59] she's shoot you whenever husband started
[1:31:02] come straight no time Street hold on
[1:31:03] what not she will stay and with him and
[1:31:06] beat him don't decide until he back side
[1:31:07] so I see the spirit upon her son like
[1:31:10] that so he had his dream of this man
[1:31:12] talking to her and straighten talking
[1:31:16] down helping on solid earth so doing it
[1:31:18] dream now when I we get to talk to her
[1:31:20] and I'm straight not and showing her
[1:31:22] operations she said now I say I am that
[1:31:24] man in that dream you know she didn't
[1:31:27] believe dream after that I said this is
[1:31:32] your dream here being interpreted
[1:31:34] straight to know she didn't wanna she
[1:31:37] figure when you asked her husband I pray
[1:31:39] with I pray for him I pray for him a
[1:31:40] pretty film cuz she didn't whip them
[1:31:41] into in turn on entity ready whipping
[1:31:44] straight alternative because she so
[1:31:48] she's spiritually strong especially when
[1:31:50] he's weak she's strong when he began to
[1:31:52] get his strength to stop like a man in
[1:31:53] his own house forget it
[1:31:54] she stopped coming to church he under
[1:31:56] pressure in the stress and I know
[1:31:59] eventually everything break up all
[1:32:01] because she done what she do a humble
[1:32:04] self to the Word of God we all have to
[1:32:08] subject ourselves to the Word of God
[1:32:09] oh praise the name of the Lord so
[1:32:12] sometimes it may come as this guy's it
[1:32:14] becoming another way all wrong another
[1:32:15] way no matter what way it comes if we
[1:32:18] have two acts we shall receive God said
[1:32:20] so oh praise God no I was gonna wrap up
[1:32:23] here he said no the coming of the Lord
[1:32:25] no the common of Jesus is so imminent
[1:32:29] the coming of judgment he is calling his
[1:32:32] elected together in oneness with the
[1:32:35] particular church in Trinidad no it
[1:32:37] didn't say that in oneness with himself
[1:32:41] so when you hear oneness with some
[1:32:43] church or some pass or Bishop you know
[1:32:44] that is plumb off the beaten path
[1:32:46] it is oneness with himself and he is the
[1:32:51] word so what he's doing he's calling the
[1:32:58] elect
[1:32:59] out of the Lutheran's to make the
[1:33:00] Wesleyan he called the electron's and to
[1:33:02] make the Pentecostals now he is calling
[1:33:05] the elect and accustomed to make up the
[1:33:07] headstone that come into it he's going
[1:33:10] to come into it isn't that right and he
[1:33:13] is dropping the same kind of ministry
[1:33:15] amongst them it wouldn't be my ministry
[1:33:18] or ministry it'll be his ministry the
[1:33:21] Ministry of Jesus Christ and if it's his
[1:33:23] ministry it wouldn't be puffed up there
[1:33:24] will be arrogant wouldn't be know-it-all
[1:33:26] it wouldn't be above all and what it
[1:33:28] will be that it will be just what the
[1:33:29] Bible says hallelujah what about the
[1:33:33] talk about charity appear at all things
[1:33:35] believeth all things hopeth all things
[1:33:37] where's that everybody spiritually very
[1:33:40] superficial a baryon where is that one
[1:33:44] time Barbra was preaching and there was
[1:33:47] this man used a bit of preachers the man
[1:33:50] have a repetition okay is repetition
[1:33:52] went before him in Barbra mittens he had
[1:33:55] about 200 men on the platform behind him
[1:33:57] famous preachers back in the prophets in
[1:33:59] him and glory and sleeping sometimes
[1:34:01] when that man came up on the on the
[1:34:05] under in any congregation he bought you
[1:34:08] snake in the grass
[1:34:08] though actually beacon once maybe he
[1:34:11] didn't heard about him I went didn't saw
[1:34:13] him deacons leave their posts
[1:34:15] but that man came up in the meeting and
[1:34:17] they said you snake in the grass a
[1:34:19] hypocrite I wanna kill you and so on but
[1:34:23] a Brahmin is standing there and he's
[1:34:24] preaching and after a while as the man
[1:34:27] get closer he spoke these words you have
[1:34:30] to say something
[1:34:30] he says you shall fall over my before
[1:34:34] because you challenged the Spirit of God
[1:34:36] you will fall over my feet not fall at
[1:34:40] my feet over my feet the man came up
[1:34:44] walk out on a platform of course the two
[1:34:47] hundred brethren behind there were no
[1:34:49] longer on the platform so they leave
[1:34:51] this big 200 pounds man the face this
[1:34:54] five foot short guy on the platform
[1:34:57] alone the man walk up on the platform as
[1:35:00] a man comment about a Branham he said
[1:35:03] come out of him but before he said that
[1:35:05] he said al of kin for that man he said
[1:35:09] maybe the man as a husband that man is a
[1:35:11] father he doesn't want to be in that
[1:35:13] condition whatever I love for him as a
[1:35:16] man says it and come up reminds spinor
[1:35:18] wrong and fall over his feet as he
[1:35:20] prophesied that'll lift the man off of
[1:35:22] him before that
[1:35:24] somebody said call the police the church
[1:35:29] police about nun pose call the outside
[1:35:32] police but about him says this is not a
[1:35:35] flesh and blood of fear ah hallelujah a
[1:35:38] flesh and blood did not flesh and blood
[1:35:40] business this is this is something else
[1:35:42] the acts are questioned but a Branham
[1:35:45] was that man delivered he said no he
[1:35:47] said he worships that spirit he loved it
[1:35:55] he said if you love whatever you have in
[1:35:58] your heart you will do we could talk no
[1:36:00] tell me gray turn black and come back
[1:36:03] Greek as long as you are something in
[1:36:05] your heart that that's why you had a
[1:36:07] heart surgery

[1:36:17] right aim ambition motive and objective

[1:36:24] had a man when once you have that heart
[1:36:25] for God it's bullseye that's why God
[1:36:27] called David a man after my own heart
[1:36:30] because regardless of what David problem
[1:36:32] he had he loved God get a heart for God
[1:36:35] he will fight for God he will cut off
[1:36:38] next for God you will do whatever for
