[48:03] fulfill the lust thereof our last
[48:07] scriptures from Jeremiah chapter five
[48:08] reading from verse 22.
[48:11] God speaks
[48:13] fearing not me say at the Lord will he
[48:17] not tremble at my presence which have
[48:20] placed the son for the bound of the Sea

[48:28] thoughts themselves yet they cannot
[48:29] Prevail though the roar yet they cannot

[53:02] prophets on your rulers the seers that
[53:04] he covered
[53:05] and the vision of all is becoming to you
[53:08] as words of a book that is sealed which
[53:11] men delivered unto one that is learned
[53:12] saying read this I praise you he said I
[53:15] cannot for it is sealed oh my Hallelujah
[53:18] all right let's go let's get started
[53:21] let's go to work this morning
[53:23] praise the Lord
[53:25] 90 years ago 9-0
[53:28] which is 1933.
[53:32] seven Visions came to this prophet
[53:35] you said in 92 to 1933 when the Lord
[53:39] when we were having a meeting over here
[53:40] where the Church of Christ is standing
[53:42] now
[53:44] a vision of the Lord came to me appear
[53:46] predicting that Germany would rise up
[53:48] and we put up a marginal line there
[53:51] and he said no how they'll be all
[53:53] fortified and the Americans would take a
[53:56] great beating right there it also said
[53:58] what will take place about Roosevelt and
[54:00] them things he will run and make a
[54:02] fourth term perfectly
[54:03] I'll come to pass also that cars will
[54:06] keep getting more like an egg until the
[54:08] last days it'll be a shape of an egg and
[54:10] I said it'll come to pass that those
[54:12] cars will not be run by steering wheel
[54:13] it was run by something else and then
[54:16] cars will bring right out now remote
[54:17] control and so on you can't hit another
[54:19] car because of remote control
[54:21] I said remember that day before the end
[54:23] time comes before the end time comes now
[54:26] you all keep this road down there'll be
[54:28] a powerful woman raise up either be
[54:31] president or dictator or some great
[54:33] powerful woman in this United States and
[54:36] she will sink under the influence of
[54:37] woman no remember that is thus saith the
[54:40] Lord
[54:41] let's continue
[54:44] the loudest and age began around the
[54:46] tune of the 20th century perhaps 1906.
[54:50] how long will it last
[54:51] as a servant of God who had multitude of
[54:54] visions of which none has ever failed he
[54:57] said one morning I'll just keep in true
[54:59] June 1933 the Lord Jesus spoke to me and
[55:04] said
[55:04] that the coming of the Lord has joined
[55:06] now
[55:07] but that before he came
[55:10] seven major events would transpire
[55:14] the first Vision was that of Mussolini
[55:17] would invade Ethiopia and the nation
[55:20] would fall at the steps that Vision
[55:22] surely that caused some repercussions
[55:24] some were very angry when I said it I
[55:27] would not believe it but it happened
[55:29] that way he just walked in there with
[55:31] his mother and arms and took over the
[55:33] natives didn't stand a chance but the
[55:35] vision also said that Mussolini would
[55:37] come to Harbor Inn with his own people
[55:39] tilling on him that came to pass exactly
[55:42] Vision number one
[55:44] Vision number two the next vision for
[55:47] Paul that an Austrian by the name of
[55:49] Adolf Hitler
[55:50] would rise up as dictator over Germany
[55:53] and he would draw the world into war it
[55:56] shown the sign fine line and how our
[55:58] truths will have a terrible time to
[55:59] overcome it then it shows Hitler would
[56:02] come to a mysterious end
[56:04] the third Vision was in the realm of
[56:06] world politics
[56:08] for it showed me that there would be
[56:10] three great ISM fascism Nazism communism
[56:15] and the first two would be swallowed up
[56:17] into the Third
[56:19] The Voice admonished what Russia what
[56:22] Russia keep your eyes on the King of the
[56:24] North
[56:25] and we know that Russia is ordained by
[56:27] God under the communistic spirit to
[56:31] inflict Rome with judgment
[56:33] to inflict America with judgment also so
[56:36] Russia are going away anytime soon
[56:38] praise God
[56:40] the fourth Vision showed great advances
[56:43] in science that would come after the
[56:46] second World War
[56:47] it was now this is 1933.
[56:51] being like 90 years ago let's continue
[56:55] it was heading up in a vision in the
[56:57] Plastic Bubble top car that was running
[56:59] down beautiful highways on the remote
[57:02] control so that people appeared sitting
[57:04] in the car without a steering wheel and
[57:07] they were playing some sort of game to
[57:10] amuse themselves but even poor
[57:21] so this was what
[57:23] a kind of view of what the cow shaped
[57:26] like in 1933
[57:28] but this is not what he saw you know kai
[57:31] was odd shape in that time he saw a
[57:33] different car altogether let's go to the
[57:35] video
[57:45] volume
[57:56] we spend so much of our Lives driving
[57:59] from place to place
[58:03] I'm just going to stop right here yes
[58:06] save us a seat shouldn't it be easier
[58:08] and safer to get where we want to go
[58:11] since 2009 our team at Google has been
[58:15] developing fully self-driving technology
[58:18] and testing it on real city streets
[58:21] every single day until after more than a
[58:25] million miles we were ready to take a
[58:28] big step forward
[58:31] in 2015 we completed the world's first
[58:35] truly driverless ride on public roads
[58:41] just a person in a car no steering wheel
[58:44] no pedals navigating everyday traffic
[58:48] well I've never been in Austin Texas
[58:52] now I'm driving in Austin Texas
[58:59] [Music]
[59:04] it's a profound experience for me to be
[59:07] alone in the car a very important
[59:10] segment of my life was cut away when my
[59:14] vision failed and a self-driving car
[59:16] would give me a huge part of my life
[59:18] back
[59:20] this is just the beginning
[59:22] we're looking ahead
[59:25] to a new way a better way for everyone
[59:32] [Music]
[59:39] foreign
[59:41] say hello
[59:44] to waymo
[59:47] praise the Lord
[59:49] so you know what a vision is when a
[59:51] prophet gets a vision he goes up in the
[59:53] spirit
[59:54] he goes into the future
[59:56] he sees exactly what comes what is
[1:00:00] happening and come back and say dusty at
[1:00:02] the Lord it can't fail because it's
[1:00:04] something directly that he sees in the
[1:00:07] future that was the third Vision that
[1:00:09] was the fourth vision
[1:00:10] the fifth Vision had to do with the
[1:00:13] moral problem of our age centering
[1:00:15] mostly your own woman God showed me that
[1:00:18] woman began to be out of their place
[1:00:19] with the granting of the vote that they
[1:00:21] cut off the here which signify that they
[1:00:24] were no longer under the authority of a
[1:00:25] man but insisted on either equal rights
[1:00:28] or in more cases more than equal rights
[1:00:30] she adopted men closing went in the
[1:00:33] state of undress until the last picture
[1:00:35] I saw was a woman naked except for
[1:00:38] little fig leaf type epon
[1:00:41] which with this Vision I saw the
[1:00:45] terrible provision and moral plight of
[1:00:47] the whole world
[1:00:48] then in the sixth Vision there arose in
[1:00:51] America are most beautiful but cruel
[1:00:53] woman she held the people in a complete
[1:00:56] power I believe that this was the rise
[1:01:00] of the Roman Catholic Church though I
[1:01:04] knew it could possibly be a vision of
[1:01:06] some woman rising in great power in
[1:01:09] America due to the popular vote by women
[1:01:12] the last and seven vision
[1:01:16] was wearing I heard a most terrible
[1:01:19] explosion
[1:01:20] as I turned to look I saw nothing but
[1:01:23] debris and craters and smoke all over
[1:01:27] the land of America so we're not even
[1:01:29] sure if America even making it a
[1:01:31] tribulation
[1:01:32] all right let's continue
[1:01:35] so
[1:01:38] Revelation 13 review 13 stars to two
[1:01:41] stripes everything is 13 everything is
[1:01:42] woman
[1:01:43] Dusty at the Lord there will be a woman
[1:01:46] rule before the end time
[1:01:48] she'll either be president vice
[1:01:50] president or it will be the Catholic
[1:01:52] Church as a woman I've seen her
[1:01:55] he said no guess he's not flipping a
[1:01:58] crystal ball and throw no dice I have
[1:02:00] seen her a great woman and a Nation
[1:02:03] about her it will be won before the end
[1:02:07] time
[1:02:08] thus saith the Lord write it down and
[1:02:11] find out you young people see if it
[1:02:13] happens if it isn't I'm a false prophet
[1:02:16] or praise the name of the Lord
[1:02:19] this Wednesday January 25th
[1:02:23] uh
[1:02:24] in brother Branham time
[1:02:26] he said the scientists put the clock
[1:02:28] they call it the Doomsday Clock at three
[1:02:30] minutes to midnight
[1:02:32] so this Wednesday
[1:02:33] they were unveiling what time they
[1:02:36] believe it is
[1:02:37] no
[1:02:39] and when they unveil it they said right
[1:02:41] now we are 90 seconds to midnight
[1:02:45] with Russia invasion of Ukraine and the
[1:02:48] Specter of nuclear weapon use
[1:02:50] Earth crept its closest to Armageddon a
[1:02:54] science oriented adversary group moving
[1:02:57] its famous Doomsday Clock up to 90
[1:02:59] seconds before midnight
[1:03:02] we are really closer to that than
[1:03:04] doomsday as I read that I think it's who
[1:03:06] something already give it a warning
[1:03:09] until countries begin to stock up on on
[1:03:12] nuke I heard I said um something
[1:03:15] that protected from nuclear fallout some
[1:03:19] kind of medication or something like
[1:03:20] that
[1:03:21] we are really closer to that doomsday
[1:03:23] former Mongolian president elbow Tashia
[1:03:26] said Tuesday at the bulletin of atomic
[1:03:28] scientists annual announcement written
[1:03:31] of how close humanity is doing in itself
[1:03:33] in he and former Ireland president Mary
[1:03:36] Robinson joined scientists to underscore
[1:03:38] that they consider the Gathering of
[1:03:40] several existential threats with Russian
[1:03:43] leader Vladimir Putin's action and words
[1:03:45] Chief among them
[1:03:46] people and scientists are warning us
[1:03:49] that we have to wake up now
[1:03:51] like this week he said the adversary
[1:03:54] group started in 1947 to use a clock to
[1:03:59] symbolize the potential and likelihood
[1:04:02] of people doing something to end
[1:04:04] Humanity
[1:04:05] it moved the clock 10 seconds closer
[1:04:07] than last year making it the closer it
[1:04:10] has ever been to strike in 12. it has
[1:04:13] been much as 17 minutes before midnight
[1:04:15] after the end of the Cold War but the
[1:04:17] last few years the group has changed and
[1:04:19] counting down the minutes midnight to
[1:04:22] counting down to the seconds
[1:04:23] doomsday has not happened yet we are
[1:04:27] sending a message that the situation is
[1:04:29] becoming more urgent
[1:04:31] so I'm going to just keep that right
[1:04:32] there
[1:04:33] oh man they continue
[1:04:36] a few nights ago
[1:04:39] just about a month before going over to
[1:04:41] Africa many of you perhaps has the tape
[1:04:44] you people here gets a tape choosing a
[1:04:46] bride was preach in California
[1:04:48] the last few minutes of that tape I
[1:04:50] don't remember of ever being dear but
[1:04:52] the spirit of the Lord came in such a
[1:04:54] way
[1:04:55] I have been condemning them the way they
[1:04:57] were living and doing and after the
[1:04:59] gospel was preached and declared before
[1:05:01] them so much all of a sudden the Holy
[1:05:04] Spirit spoke out and said Capernaum
[1:05:06] the city that called yourself by the
[1:05:08] name of the angels that is Los Angeles
[1:05:11] God exalted into heaven and be brought
[1:05:14] down to Hell
[1:05:16] he said it and then when I went into the
[1:05:19] scripture
[1:05:20] I said there's something about that in
[1:05:21] the Bible
[1:05:22] and it was Jesus rebuking kapuna and all
[1:05:27] those crucial City that he had to visit
[1:05:29] he said Capernaum doors exalted into
[1:05:32] heaven will be brought down into hell he
[1:05:34] said but if the works have been done in
[1:05:36] Sodom Gomorrah had been done in you
[1:05:38] it'll be standing today
[1:05:40] and just after that maybe a hundred
[1:05:42] years or something like that of Jesus
[1:05:44] prophecy Capernaum the only coastal city
[1:05:47] that he had visited a earthquake sunk it
[1:05:50] in the sea
[1:05:51] and you know that was the direct answer
[1:05:53] to California Los Angeles
[1:05:56] watch
[1:05:57] he says
[1:05:59] he talked about uh the there was a
[1:06:01] earthquake and some things put loose and
[1:06:03] so on he said in the pool lose several
[1:06:05] inches maybe two inches the other day
[1:06:06] and one was interviewing a scientist and
[1:06:09] said well it probably won't be in our
[1:06:11] age he said it could be in five minutes
[1:06:13] or in five years but it's going to fall
[1:06:15] in
[1:06:17] and when I understood that I said
[1:06:19] there's a scripture that's all I skipped
[1:06:20] a little bit he says no watch all right
[1:06:23] he said and then prophesying Los Angeles
[1:06:25] will be in the bottom of the sea
[1:06:28] praise God so that's the prophecy now
[1:06:31] you know we're here now for years
[1:06:33] but this will surely come to pass
[1:06:35] oh yes
[1:06:36] it will be fulfilled it have to be
[1:06:38] fulfilled because the prophet saw it by
[1:06:40] vision
[1:06:41] Revelation 6 says and I beheld when it
[1:06:44] opened the Sixth Seal that was a great
[1:06:45] earthquake
[1:06:47] and the moon and the sun became black a
[1:06:50] circle out of here
[1:06:51] and the moon became as blood
[1:06:53] and the stars of Heaven fell onto the
[1:06:55] Earth even the victory concept of
[1:06:57] untimely figs when she's shaking the
[1:06:59] Mighty Wind and The Heavenly passages of
[1:07:01] scroll when it rolled together and every
[1:07:03] mountain and Island will move out of
[1:07:05] their places and the kings of the earth
[1:07:07] and the great men and the rich men and
[1:07:09] the chief captains and the Mighty Men
[1:07:10] every Bond man every free man hid
[1:07:12] themselves in the dens and the rocks in
[1:07:15] the mountains and settle the mountain on
[1:07:16] rocks followed us and hide us from the
[1:07:18] face of him that sitted on the throne
[1:07:21] from the rat of the lamb for the great
[1:07:23] day of his rat is come who shall be able
[1:07:26] to stand so friends we know a dynamic
[1:07:30] age an age that all history all the the
[1:07:34] Saints of all I've been looking for for
[1:07:36] this time this time of Deliverance and
[1:07:38] Redemption and breakthrough we are not
[1:07:40] here forever isn't that right praise God
[1:07:42] question
[1:07:43] now does man a dead go to heaven or hell
[1:07:47] immediately or do they wait for the
[1:07:49] judgment
[1:07:51] answer
[1:07:52] that's a very good question it does I
[1:07:54] was due a good consideration because
[1:07:56] every man is interested what is he going
[1:07:58] to be after his life is over every man
[1:08:01] is interested I'll tell my wife
[1:08:03] sometimes I'm driving and I'm watching
[1:08:05] People's Souls on the side of the roads
[1:08:07] people
[1:08:08] and I'm seeing dying people Diana don't
[1:08:11] even know it
[1:08:12] the walking and they don't even know it
[1:08:14] they're on their way see young people
[1:08:16] and so on they don't even know what
[1:08:18] happened the next martial years
[1:08:20] but we are dying
[1:08:22] praise God you're born to live and
[1:08:24] you're living today isn't that something
[1:08:25] so the the best thing to do is to live
[1:08:27] for Jesus Christ
[1:08:28] the best thing to do is to live for the
[1:08:30] Lord because we have to answer someday
[1:08:33] for the life-given on us on the earth
[1:08:34] okay let's continue
[1:08:37] this is good
[1:08:39] the sinner has got this time judgment
[1:08:42] but there won't be but this judgment is
[1:08:45] just like a circle or rainbow around the
[1:08:48] world of the blood of Christ
[1:08:50] as long as you were here
[1:08:54] if God could look upon the Earth in his
[1:08:56] condition tonight any other way than
[1:08:58] through the blood of Jesus Christ he
[1:09:00] would destroyed in a second
[1:09:02] so it's because the blood of Jesus
[1:09:04] circles the world like the whole
[1:09:06] secondly hold it
[1:09:08] so even though your sin your fail your
[1:09:10] fall you do whatever it is the blood's
[1:09:12] still counting as a bumper for you as
[1:09:15] long as you are on the Earth
[1:09:18] are you with me
[1:09:20] he would destroyed in a second he have
[1:09:22] to certainly have to that is where the
[1:09:24] judgment is coming now as long as a man
[1:09:27] is under here
[1:09:29] I want you to believe what the prophet
[1:09:30] is saying
[1:09:31] no matter if the man is a drunkard
[1:09:35] or a gambler
[1:09:37] or a horrible unbeliever
[1:09:41] that's why that's why it's hard to
[1:09:42] understand when people have bad ways and
[1:09:44] they say they're Christians
[1:09:47] because we were born in sin shape
[1:09:48] iniquity and God reached on pick us out
[1:09:51] and give us Grace to come into this way
[1:09:55] we couldn't do this if God didn't make a
[1:09:57] way for us he said no man could come
[1:10:00] except my father draw him so if God
[1:10:02] grace extend to you to pick you up how
[1:10:04] come you want to condemn this one write
[1:10:06] out this one cut off this one have a bad
[1:10:08] attitude this with this one and look at
[1:10:09] this one
[1:10:11] it doesn't make sense
[1:10:16] if a man is a drunkard a gambler a
[1:10:19] horrible unbeliever the mercies of God
[1:10:22] is still atones for him
[1:10:25] and a woman she might be ever what she
[1:10:27] might be a prostitute whatever the blood
[1:10:30] of Jesus Christ still atones for her
[1:10:34] but the minute that that Soul leans this
[1:10:38] body
[1:10:39] and she goes beyond that she is passed
[1:10:41] from Mercy to judgment
[1:10:45] the minute
[1:10:46] the soul leaves the body judgment
[1:10:49] she's no longer covered by the circle
[1:10:51] that circle around the Earth
[1:10:52] of the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:10:55] Hallelujah
[1:10:57] God's already judging that satellite
[1:10:59] she's done she's judged you judge
[1:11:01] yourself
[1:11:03] by the way you treat God's propagation
[1:11:05] for your sins
[1:11:06] you judge yourself
[1:11:08] you don't judge him you you
[1:11:10] don't judge him just enough to forgive
[1:11:12] you
[1:11:12] if you think he'll forgive you confess
[1:11:14] your Force he forgive you then by one
[1:11:16] Spirit we are all baptized into one body
[1:11:20] and as that body was raised up by God
[1:11:22] resurrected from the dead Justified sit
[1:11:24] in his right hand in power matches in
[1:11:27] heaven so them that I am dead in Christ
[1:11:28] are in Christ and free from judgment
[1:11:30] will come forth in the resurrection
[1:11:33] now when we die no
[1:11:35] we go directly into the presence of
[1:11:38] almighty God in a Celestial body
[1:11:42] are you are you riding with me this
[1:11:44] morning
[1:11:47] if I would meet brother Neville up there
[1:11:49] if we both die now in an hour from now I
[1:11:53] will meet him and say greetings
[1:11:55] talk to him
[1:11:57] I couldn't shake his hand
[1:11:58] he's in a Celestial body
[1:12:01] I could talk to him he would look just
[1:12:04] like he looked us here I would look like
[1:12:06] I do but we could talk to one another we
[1:12:09] couldn't touch one another because we
[1:12:12] haven't got any of the five senses of
[1:12:15] sea taste feel and smell and hear
[1:12:19] that that five senses belong to the body
[1:12:21] that will be in the box or in the Earth
[1:12:24] are you with me now but this Celestial
[1:12:26] body is another body that the soul
[1:12:29] stepped into when you leave here okay
[1:12:31] because they lost some prison
[1:12:34] all them saints who die how they
[1:12:36] Fellowship
[1:12:37] Oh Glory to God but they have to come
[1:12:39] back to pick up their body

[1:12:50] hinder them that are asleep Oh Glory to
[1:12:53] goddam is going to be a resurrection no
[1:12:55] devil can stop it no trial no test no
[1:12:58] Force anointed no Pope no person no
[1:13:00] please no King could stop it there's
[1:13:02] gonna be a resurrection but before
[1:13:04] there's a resurrection a bride has to
[1:13:06] come to Perfection to bring all the
[1:13:08] resurrection Oh Glory to God Amen could
[1:13:11] somebody shout amen
[1:13:13] you don't want to be a church member you
[1:13:15] want to be a part of the Bride of Jesus
[1:13:17] Christ
[1:13:18] call to that perfection
[1:13:20] Hallelujah Lori
[1:13:23] let's see let's go again
[1:13:25] we couldn't touch one another because we
[1:13:28] haven't got any of the five senses of
[1:13:30] cities feel smelling here
[1:13:33] but we could be immortal and we would
[1:13:35] see one another we would live in the
[1:13:37] Blessed Realms by the altar of God
[1:13:40] don't you know John saw Souls under the
[1:13:42] altar crying how long how long
[1:13:45] now when Jesus which is in us now in the
[1:13:48] form of the Holy Ghost
[1:13:49] when his Celestial body the Holy Spirit
[1:13:52] returns with the glorified body we will
[1:13:56] be glorified with him in his likeness
[1:13:59] what that mean then I will shake his
[1:14:01] hand and say here it is by the Neville
[1:14:04] look Jesus told the disciples taking the
[1:14:06] communion I will eat no more of the
[1:14:08] fruit of the vine until I eat it and
[1:14:10] drink it but you are new in my father's
[1:14:11] kingdom is that right there it is a
[1:14:14] Justified person
[1:14:16] standing in the presence of God goes
[1:14:19] into his presence as an immortal being
[1:14:22] and lives in the Blessed Realms of peace
[1:14:24] until that day returns back
[1:14:28] Hallelujah
[1:14:30] are you enjoying the word
[1:14:32] okay here we go
[1:14:34] there was a time that the people didn't
[1:14:36] go into the presence of God
[1:14:37] when they died
[1:14:39] the Justified
[1:14:40] that was in the Old Testament they went
[1:14:43] into a place called Paradise
[1:14:45] and there The Souls of the just waited
[1:14:48] in paradise and that's why witches and
[1:14:51] which people and they could have access
[1:14:53] to that
[1:14:54] because the people who was in A Place
[1:14:57] Called Paradise and when Jesus died and
[1:14:59] went down he Loops them from there
[1:15:01] and put them in another dimension Oh
[1:15:04] Glory the god Paradise had been emptied

[1:15:26] return He brought out from the grave
[1:15:29] those dead
[1:15:30] that died on the atonement of Bloods and
[1:15:33] brothers and goats and Heifers and they
[1:15:36] entered into the City and appeared unto
[1:15:38] many how beautiful picture if you only
[1:15:40] paint a moment when Jesus died

[1:26:00] you'll prosper and do what you do that's
[1:26:02] true but one of these days if you are a
[1:26:06] sinner and your soul slips out it will
[1:26:09] go beyond into judgment and will be
[1:26:11] condemned and then you'll be Cast Away
[1:26:14] and you've been tormented until the day
[1:26:16] that you brought back to this it again
[1:26:18] and then you receive a body that will be
[1:26:20] cast into outer Darkness whether they'll
[1:26:22] be weeping and with a nation of teeth

[1:26:28] oh my how quick that God knows every
[1:26:31] thought we think of everything we do he
[1:26:34] knows of it so when the believer dies he
[1:26:37] goes into the presence of his Mika his
[1:26:39] God and the sinner when he dies he goes
[1:26:41] to his destination there will be some
[1:26:44] that will come up in the second
[1:26:45] resurrection and will have to stand the
[1:26:47] Judgment now first
[1:26:50] that will take place
[1:26:52] the coming of the Bride
[1:26:54] there will be a people in the world
[1:26:56] listen close
[1:26:58] just because you accepted Christ as

[1:27:06] elect
[1:27:08] that will be going in the Rapture there
[1:27:10] will be a Remnant here on Earth that
[1:27:12] will go through the persecution and the
[1:27:14] Great Tribulation the church will be
[1:27:16] caught up in the rapture
[1:27:19] then he said how many women here does
[1:27:20] know when you're going to cut a piece of
[1:27:22] goods you lead a good job like that the
[1:27:23] cloth laid a pattern on it you cut the
[1:27:25] goods just according to the pattern and
[1:27:27] the rest of the good is just good same
[1:27:29] Goods but it wasn't part of the pattern

[1:27:39] pattern what God blesses bless many are
[1:27:43] called few are chosen many are called by
[1:27:46] the shout few gonna be chosen by the
[1:27:48] voice and if God chose you no devil

[1:27:59] been true Oh Glory to God Amen you are
[1:28:03] free today amen hallelujah
[1:28:07] he said no I've chosen them before the
[1:28:09] function of the world right Jesus told
[1:28:11] his disciples that he was with them and
[1:28:13] he had chosen them and he knew them
[1:28:15] before the foundation of the world was
[1:28:17] ever laid isn't that right praise the
[1:28:20] name of the Lord
[1:28:21] Hallelujah prison
[1:28:24] have you ever heard of Tim Trojan Horse
[1:28:27] okay
[1:28:29] a chosen horse
[1:28:30] a chosen horse is a hollow wooden horse
[1:28:34] constructed by the Greeks to gain
[1:28:36] entrance into Troy during the Trojan War
[1:28:39] the horse was built by IPS
[1:28:42] a master Carpenter and culturalist
[1:28:45] the Greeks pretending to Desert the war
[1:28:49] sailed to the nearby island of tinenos
[1:28:52] leaving behind sinon
[1:28:54] who persuaded the Trojans that the horse
[1:28:57] was offering to Athena Goddess of War
[1:29:01] that would make Troy impregnable
[1:29:05] despite the warning of La and
[1:29:07] Cassandra the horse was taken inside the
[1:29:10] city Gates
[1:29:11] that night Greek warriors emerged from
[1:29:15] it and opened the gates to let in The
[1:29:18] Returned Greek army
[1:29:20] the story is told at length in the book
[1:29:22] two of the anid and is touched upon an
[1:29:25] odyssey the term trojan horse has come
[1:29:27] to refer to subversion introduced from
[1:29:31] the outside
[1:29:33] beginning the late 20th century the name
[1:29:35] Trojan Horse was applied to deceptively
[1:29:37] benign computer codes that seem like
[1:29:40] legitimate applications but are written
[1:29:43] to damage or disrupt computers
[1:29:46] programming or to steal personal
[1:29:48] information
[1:29:50] so you understand what the children's
[1:29:52] horse is they do like they're not there
[1:29:54] they want to go in they couldn't fight
[1:29:55] they're fighting all the time you know
[1:29:56] and the record is not getting through so
[1:29:58] what they do they build a nice wooden
[1:29:59] horse big wood nose and say that's our
[1:30:02] girlfriend for you that's a gift
[1:30:04] and instead of the Bonnet right there
[1:30:06] and do get rid of it right outside the
[1:30:08] gates they they pull it inside they say
[1:30:10] yeah give go watch them gifts

[1:30:27] very important show them all the truth
[1:30:29] or not what we have liked here
[1:30:31] something like that
[1:30:33] and the men were inside the horse
[1:30:35] and they pulled him inside the man they
[1:30:37] quietly quietly and when they come and
[1:30:39] recovered Darkness
[1:30:41] that a master would money you know that
[1:30:44] build a horse you know a demands inside
[1:30:46] of there open the gate and let the enemy
[1:30:49] come in destroy it
[1:30:52] Hallelujah
[1:30:53] praise God
[1:30:57] um
[1:30:59] Avatar
[1:31:05] Avatar is a movie that is being played
[1:31:07] right now
[1:31:12] and the meaning
[1:31:13] and that would Avatar came from Sanskrit
[1:31:18] the Hindu text
[1:31:22] and the meaning it has a manifestation
[1:31:25] of deity
[1:31:27] or released soul
[1:31:29] in bodily form on Earth
[1:31:32] an incarnate Divine teacher
[1:31:35] Avatar comes from the Sanskrit word
[1:31:38] although I know it looking like a
[1:31:40] disjointed but it'll all come together
[1:31:41] see I'll talk about children horse
[1:31:44] we there's a reason why we said that so
[1:31:46] we're coming to that just now
[1:31:48] Avatar come from the Sanskrit word
[1:31:50] avatara meaning descent
[1:31:52] within Hinduism it means a manifestation
[1:31:56] of a deity in bodily form on Earth such
[1:31:59] as a Divine teacher
[1:32:01] for those of us who don't practice
[1:32:03] Hinduism it technically means
[1:32:05] incarnation
[1:32:06] embodiment or manifestation of a person
[1:32:10] or idea
[1:32:11] an avatar is something that embodies
[1:32:13] something else
[1:32:15] in Hinduism the different gods can take
[1:32:18] many different forms and when they took
[1:32:21] human forms the human was their Avatar
[1:32:26] eventually the word Avatar came to meet
[1:32:28] the embodiment not just of a god
[1:32:31] but also of an abstract idea
[1:32:35] now the man
[1:32:37] who is the director of these Avatar
[1:32:39] movies and so on like that her name is
[1:32:41] James Cameron
[1:32:43] he's an atheist
[1:32:47] he's not a Saint James
[1:32:51] he's an atheist
[1:32:55] he believes not in this true Living God
[1:32:59] and he has an agenda
[1:33:01] now the first Avatar movie was made 13
[1:33:04] years ago
[1:33:06] I'm saying this because I had reason to
[1:33:08] kind of dig deeper into this this guy
[1:33:12] and he had to wait 13 years because
[1:33:15] science wasn't ready for the vision he
[1:33:17] had
[1:33:19] he helped design
[1:33:21] the cameras
[1:33:23] and the whole thing that produced the
[1:33:26] movie that we have presently called
[1:33:28] Avatar 2 The Way of the water
[1:33:31] this film has taught two billion dollars
[1:33:36] I think under two months or within two
[1:33:38] months not 2 million
[1:33:41] millionaires are set of numbers
[1:33:43] but this is 2 billion that's a lot of
[1:33:46] zeros behind
[1:33:48] two billion and it's still going strong
[1:33:50] his first one crossed 2 billion
[1:33:53] three of his movies crossed two billion
[1:33:55] he is a man like no other
[1:33:59] in India they're going crazy about this
[1:34:01] Avatar film
[1:34:03] why because Avatar is inspired by
[1:34:08] Hinduism
[1:34:10] the color blue is used the way Hindu
[1:34:13] gods are depicted
[1:34:15] the ramayana
[1:34:17] or ramayana is the inspiration for this
[1:34:21] place called Pandora
[1:34:22] which is the mystical world of this
[1:34:26] place called Avatar
[1:34:28] now this man
[1:34:30] got dreams when he was age 18.
[1:34:35] dreams remember just two influences
[1:34:39] it's not six or three or five or four
[1:34:41] you know it have influence from above or
[1:34:44] below so I'll say it this way the dreams
[1:34:47] he got from Below
[1:34:50] he got them when he was age 18. and he
[1:34:55] draw it out he had it out he had it
[1:34:57] there and everything else he saw colors
[1:34:59] he saw everything he is inspired
[1:35:02] these half-naked creatures they're
[1:35:06] looking like humans because bodies that
[1:35:08] you reflect in there in another world
[1:35:10] have tales and they have little lowering
[1:35:13] clothes running around
[1:35:14] all right
[1:35:15] no it's a world that he has created
[1:35:19] and that is why I spoke about what I
[1:35:22] spoke about you are here
[1:35:25] what you are somewhere else
[1:35:28] because I learned that one of the stars
[1:35:31] and the whole thing is a man who is
[1:35:32] crippled
[1:35:33] he can't move he can't walk or whatever
[1:35:36] it is but when he transmits into this
[1:35:38] Avatar Land he's walking normal
[1:35:40] he is moving normal so this man is
[1:35:44] inspired though is negatively inspired
[1:35:48] to see another world
[1:35:51] and he had the intention to bring the
[1:35:54] world
[1:35:55] put into that world
[1:36:05] but yeah Paul just put on the picture
[1:36:09] this is the creatures
[1:36:12] that is projected in this so-called nice
[1:36:15] world called Avatar note behind it I
[1:36:19] have some people on wings and flying and
[1:36:21] there's the color blue and everything
[1:36:22] else take the door faster my face no
[1:36:25] don't stay there too long there take it
[1:36:27] off now
[1:36:29] I prefer to see meat on the cedar
[1:36:34] all right
[1:36:36] you know I was wondering if so play a
[1:36:38] video concerning what the part or what
[1:36:40] they have but
[1:36:41] to do that
[1:36:47] now
[1:36:50] so this this man is inspired
[1:36:54] he inspired in a way
[1:36:56] I'm sorry I couldn't get some more
[1:36:57] pictures but he's having an internet and
[1:37:00] so on
[1:37:01] all the actors in this movie called
[1:37:03] Avatar have dots on their face and
[1:37:06] special clothing underwear
[1:37:09] Dava helmet
[1:37:11] and have a camera
[1:37:13] so the camera gets the picture
[1:37:15] of the Feast of expression the smiles
[1:37:19] the eye blinking everything else
[1:37:22] and the costume that they wear registers
[1:37:26] the holy Duchess for that all through
[1:37:28] the all through the garments have these
[1:37:30] dots and so on they're doing it in
[1:37:32] normal place
[1:37:33] but what the Ducks do it sells signals
[1:37:37] to the computer
[1:37:39] and because of that they could add what
[1:37:41] you call a CGI I think it's computer
[1:37:43] generated image is what that is and put
[1:37:46] a layer over how the person is acting
[1:37:50] so it's not a cartoon
[1:37:52] is actors that acting and you could see
[1:37:55] their facial expression as to who it is
[1:37:59] the emotions are reflected and the
[1:38:01] acting
[1:38:02] so this technology
[1:38:06] this couldn't be done except man reached
[1:38:09] to the technological advancement
[1:38:12] to produce the quality of world that
[1:38:15] they're creating
[1:38:17] no I understand that after people went
[1:38:20] and see it they went into a place oh
[1:38:22] that's that's it that's it right there
[1:38:23] so you see the helmet the dots on the
[1:38:26] face and that deer is a computer
[1:38:29] generation of the man that talking and
[1:38:31] everything else so there is no mistake
[1:38:34] of who it is it's an avatar
[1:38:38] another being
[1:38:40] from another world thank you Brothers
[1:38:41] they're good all right
[1:38:44] so now
[1:38:46] there was an interview
[1:38:48] and that is what we're about to play now
[1:38:49] an interview with him a woman who was
[1:38:52] interviewing him and I want you to hear
[1:38:54] what the director say about it
[1:38:58] yeah Paul let's go to the interview
[1:39:00] and I think
[1:39:08] in terms of Avatar I think that the
[1:39:11] greatest level of sophistication is when
[1:39:14] you can bring very sophisticated
[1:39:16] information into simple form and that's
[1:39:19] what makes Avatar that you could tell
[1:39:21] that level of sophisticated truth in
[1:39:24] almost like a cartoon yeah which is what
[1:39:27] religion and spirituality is and there
[1:39:30] are religious and spiritual themes right
[1:39:32] throughout throughout
[1:39:35] and they're there and they're there by
[1:39:37] Design they're not accidental I mean the
[1:39:39] film I think was dismissed by some
[1:39:40] critics as being too simplistic too
[1:39:43] familiar a story just to sort of
[1:39:45] Pocahontas story and so on and I don't
[1:39:48] think they they realized that it was by
[1:39:51] design a kind of Trojan Horse to allow
[1:39:54] you to deal with a very familiar and
[1:39:58] simple plot line that has these other
[1:40:01] layers and textures to it which was my
[1:40:04] focus you know my focus was on the
[1:40:06] design the fabric of the world the
[1:40:08] feeling evoked by the watching you know
[1:40:11] so you can synthesize the plot quite or
[1:40:14] sum up the plot quite quickly but you
[1:40:17] can't sum up the experience quickly and
[1:40:19] so it was experiential filmmaking that
[1:40:22] was the that was the primary goal
[1:40:25] praise God
[1:40:26] did you hear that
[1:40:30] the woman says here what makes Avatar
[1:40:34] that you could tell that level of
[1:40:37] sophisticated truth is almost like a
[1:40:39] cartoon you say yeah you say which is
[1:40:42] what religion and spirituality is and
[1:40:46] they are religious and spiritual teams
[1:40:48] throughout when they are dear and they
[1:40:51] are he said he said throughout he said
[1:40:52] and they are there by Design
[1:40:55] he said it is not accidental these
[1:40:58] people are hiding what they're doing he
[1:41:00] said it is not accidental It Is by
[1:41:03] Design listen a kind of Trojan Horse
[1:41:10] we get into somewhere we're getting
[1:41:11] somewhere he said to himself a kind of
[1:41:14] church and horse what is Roseanne horse
[1:41:16] do to get on the inside
[1:41:21] to allow you to deal with a very
[1:41:24] familiar and simple plotline that has
[1:41:27] these other layers and textures to it
[1:41:31] which was my focus you know my focus is
[1:41:35] on the design the fabric of the world
[1:41:37] will the feeling invoked by the watching
[1:41:43] feelings
[1:41:45] invoked by the watching he said you
[1:41:49] could synthesize the pot quite and sum
[1:41:50] it up quickly but you can't sum up the
[1:41:54] experience quickly so it was an
[1:41:57] experiential filmmaking that was my
[1:42:00] primary goal no in another interview
[1:42:04] he spoke about somebody uh was saying
[1:42:08] why is this scene was so long I guess
[1:42:11] some animal flying or somebody on the
[1:42:12] animal whatever whatever and he finds so
[1:42:15] much he said he wanted it so
[1:42:17] I wanted it so because I want to get the
[1:42:20] people pulled into the world that was in
[1:42:24] it will take time to do that
[1:42:27] by the Brandon
[1:42:29] from a noted not
[1:42:31] watch
[1:42:34] the spirit following it there will come
[1:42:38] a time
[1:42:39] In The Name Of The Lord
[1:42:41] that people will go completely insane
[1:42:45] the Bible says so they will scream and
[1:42:48] holler great hideous things in their
[1:42:52] imaginary mind
[1:42:53] the radio and things our television
[1:42:56] programs are producing it there will be
[1:42:58] such things as ants raised up in the
[1:43:00] earth that will be highest 14 trees
[1:43:02] there will be a bird fire across the
[1:43:04] Earth with wings four or five miles
[1:43:06] across people will see them and they
[1:43:08] will scream and holler and cry for Mercy
[1:43:10] but it will be the plagues
[1:43:15] wait till I preach on those plagues
[1:43:17] opening up
[1:43:19] so there's a prophecy hanging there that
[1:43:22] through the television through these
[1:43:24] movies true it is not accidental through
[1:43:28] all these things things can be activated

[2:16:31] away those with familiar spirits and the
[2:16:34] Wizards out of the land the soul had to
[2:16:36] run them out
[2:16:37] and the Philistine guided together came

[2:17:07] nor by Prophets
[2:17:09] none God not talking to him
[2:17:12] God had answering him
[2:17:14] and then Saul said unto himself and seek
[2:17:16] me a woman
[2:17:17] that had a familiar spirit
[2:17:22] I'll show you
[2:17:23] how back certain people could become
[2:17:25] because Soul was rank among the prophets
[2:17:27] isn't that right and he in a condition
[2:17:30] now where he is not hearing from God
[2:17:33] he says seek me a woman and have
[2:17:35] familiar Spirit then I may go to her and
[2:17:37] inquire of her and his servants said
[2:17:39] unto him behold there's a woman that had
[2:17:41] a familiar Spirit at endo
[2:17:43] Saul disguise himself when they say

[2:18:00] not supposed to do what you're doing you
[2:18:02] know you're not supposed to be here
[2:18:04] he disguised himself
[2:18:06] put on other garment agreement and he
[2:18:08] went two men with him and they came to
[2:18:10] the room by night he said unto me I pray
[2:18:12] that you divine unto me by The Familiar
[2:18:14] spirit and bring me up him whom I shall
[2:18:16] name unto thee yeah I want to call him
[2:18:18] yet
[2:18:20] now the woman really attacked
[2:18:24] she ridden the Lord the land to him
[2:18:28] behold
[2:18:30] don't know us what Saul had done
[2:18:33] how we had cut off those that are
[2:18:35] familiar spirit
[2:18:39] Soul Run
[2:18:41] and and and The Wizard out of the land
[2:18:43] wherefore then they'll list oh a sniff
[2:18:45] on my life to commit to die
[2:18:48] so Saul swear to her by the Lord saying
[2:18:50] as the Lord delivered they shall no
[2:18:52] punishment happen to thee for this thing
[2:18:54] then said the woman whom shall I bring
[2:18:56] up Unity
[2:18:57] he said bring me up Samuel
[2:19:01] remember at that time witches and so
[2:19:04] access them because they were in
[2:19:05] Paradise okay
[2:19:07] and then the woman said whom shall I
[2:19:10] bring up on the D he said bring me
[2:19:11] Samuel and when the woman saw Simon she
[2:19:14] cried with love voice and woman stick to
[2:19:16] soul and said why has thou deceived me
[2:19:18] for thou art soul
[2:19:19] you're hiding that Christian look at you
[2:19:23] you're in church come like Peter when
[2:19:25] you say you're one of them
[2:19:28] he's not Christ somebody come out again
[2:19:30] Peter standing watching it but
[2:19:33] I saw you in service last Sunday
[2:19:40] because I know people following Jesus
[2:19:43] don't do that
[2:19:47] all right
[2:19:49] watch he said why has those deceive me
[2:19:52] for the white soul and the King said
[2:19:53] unto her be not afraid for those sowest
[2:19:56] down and the woman said in the soul I
[2:19:57] saw God's descending out of the earth he
[2:19:59] said unto her what form is he of she
[2:20:01] said an old man cometh up he's covered
[2:20:03] with a mantle and soul perceive it was
[2:20:05] Samuel he stooped with his face to the
[2:20:07] ground and bought himself Samuel said to
[2:20:08] Saul why has thou disquieted me to bring
[2:20:11] me up and Saul answered I am so
[2:20:13] distressed for the Philistines make war
[2:20:14] against me and God is departed from me
[2:20:16] and answered me no more neither by
[2:20:18] prophets nor my dreams therefore I've
[2:20:20] called thee that I always make it known
[2:20:21] to me what I shall do
[2:20:24] then Samuel
[2:20:26] then said Samuel wherefore then has thou
[2:20:28] asked me seeing the Lord is departed
[2:20:30] from thee and has become thy enemy and
[2:20:33] the Lord had done to him as he speak by
[2:20:35] me for the Lord had rent the kingdom of
[2:20:37] the thy hand and given to Thy Neighbor
[2:20:38] even to David because thou has oh not
[2:20:41] obeyed not the voice of the Lord nor
[2:20:44] executed his Fierce wrath upon amalek
[2:20:47] therefore had God done this thing or to
