the glory you deserve the glory it be so beautiful when we can come to church and all we have in our hearts is to worship him to praise him huj to acknowledge Him as God and you know he's the Lord among us amen so God bless you and it's good to be here uh this morning and uh yesterday we had the uh memorial for brother Michael it was a blessing to be here and we have our precious brother Timothy right here this morning from Grenada he be sharing word with us this morning before he comes just have two things I to share with you this from acts chap 10 you don't have to find it we talk about Cornelius a devout man feared God he had a vision and he got he was noted but God said thy prayers and thine arms are come for Memorial before God so this man wasn't a Believer he wasn't a Jew he wasn't a Christian but God saw his heart God saw the kind of person he was and God say I hear your prayer now send to Jer and call for Simon so then Peter and so on like that but the part I want to get to is Peter part so the god working on both sides because that's what God have to do not one side both sides so God speak to to Cornelius and here it is God is dealing with Peter so on the tomorrow as they went up to the journey jight to the city Peter was up and housed up to pray about the sixth hour so Peter is in a praying praying atmosphere he became very hungry and he didn't cuss his wife he didn't argue and fuss and Carry On and because she didn't cook food on time and he was very hungry and would have eaten but while they made ready he fell into a trance this is the part I want to get to and saw heaven open and certain vessel descended unto him as had been a great sheet ning Four Corners let down on the earth wherein were all manner of four-footed beasts of the earth and wild beasts and creeping things and Falls of the and the voice to him said rise Peter kill and eat now this is God speaking this is Peter registering something that he not accustomed with he not handling at all God tell him rise and eat and said no no no no no no not not working so could you imagine that I trying to show you how you have to come separate sometimes from your own feelings and your emotion about things this is resident in Peter about not eating this sort what he called unclean hear what God Said hear what Peter said but Peter said not so Lord can you imagine that could you imagine some telling God not so not so not so not not so Lord for I have never eaten anything that is common or unclean and the voice speak unto him the second time what God had cleansed that call not thou common this was done three times and the vessel was rece him so God dropped something in him challenged but even his senses challenge his feelings that's why you have to separate your feelings and emotions from from your feet he challenged it and said this don't do that yet Peter don't know what going to unfold right as the sheet went up Peter doubted in himself that this Vision that he had seen should mean behold men were from Cornelius had made inquiry for Simon's house and called and ask Simon who said was Peter while Peter taught on div Vision so he doesn't know what going on just yet the spirit said unto him behold three men seek thee arise therefore get thee down go with them doubting nothing for I have sent them so even though it's not your normal routine even though it's not your normal environment even though it's what you didn't really expect I have sent them don't doubt believe isn't that right and Peter went down to the men which before con said behold I am he whom you seek what is the cause whereof you are come and they said Cornelius the Centurion a just man one that fearth God and of good report among all the nations of the Jews was warned by God by Holy Angel to send for thee into his house and to hear words of thee so Peter know this is a God thing now because now he hearing out that this he was sent to hear words Peter don't even know what words he going to speak yet and I'm going to stop right there so I want to show you I want to prove to you that you have to put your feelings and emotions on one side if your feelings don't want to come to church let your feelings stay home and you come to church if your emotions want to stay tell your emotions is a lie I am here to be blessed I'm here to be delivered I'm here to be healed I'm here to get free I'm here to break out and break through you don't know what God will do this morning praise the name of the Lord praise God Amen all right so a quote I want to get you now there something I read yesterday I F that to bring it back the trying of your faith work at patience there's absolutely no way in which to gain patience it has to come by the trial of our faith trial of what shout out faith and God had to try that a faith that cannot be tried cannot be trusted so if God gave you a faith you have to try that to qualify that faith it could be trusted faith faith that could stand amen hallelujah a man have faith and Fa when he test come he fall down that know faith that is hope faith does stand when the test come so when God dropped faith on Abraham he gave her 25 years to try that oh give the Lord a shout he put time on faith so you can one Faith now now Faith is but God has tried that now Faith is oh give the Lord some Praises are you with me now tribulation work at patience you can't say God give me patience give me quick tribulation work at patience so when you want patience to work tribulation is the key for that Hallelujah he say Lord give me patience God I sending tribulation for right away see how the amens disappear I sending tribulation to because tribulation has worked this thing called patience and let patience have its perfect work Hallelujah that you may be perfect and entire lacking nothing are you ready God's will for us is perfection and that Perfection is patience I'm not hearing you you have to say Amen to this you know we're not imagining things you know this is the real deal this not Kentucky Fried Chicken and the other kind of chicken the half gospel this not this God's will for us is perfection and Perfection is patience waiting on God and waiting for God so anytime God drops something on you he put time on it to see your behavior and See your action like we say if God told Abram 25 years get that child you know AB go go and drunk for the whole 24 years drinking he partying and in 25th years he chps in back into church this is year this is the of Jubilee but that but that is not going to be our testimony Our Testimony he was the father of Fai and the Bible said he staggered not at the promise of God true unbelief but was strong in faith giving glory to God and he was fully persuaded that what God promised he was able to perform are you fully persuaded this morning God could deliver your husband your wife your children your family God could deliver you God could fill you with the Holy Ghost God could do more abundantly that you can ever ask or think hey give the Lord a shout is it this is the place to shout hallelujah hallelujah all right almost done I'm not the preacher this morning the preacher is here all right waiting on God and waiting for God that is where time comes in waiting on and waiting for on and for you're waiting on God to get clearance to do what you think or you feel God want want you to do now if you don't have the time I wrote this and patience you run ahead and get burned and you will get burned to learn time waiting listen is the means by which this process of character development takes place but abah said these words talk about waiting on God and waiting for God this is the process of character development we're going to play something the process of character development takes time amen and that's is why the Pentecostals fail they failing up to now because it didn't take the word to be tested to get corrupted many were loaded with loot money big churches mega churches 30,000 people in the church and whatnot and feeling and falling on like flies because they didn't go through this thing called character you don't know what God have why you go through what you go through but ask yourself what does God see that I don't see then I want to trust him Hallelujah so I want to invite my friend from Grenada to come and Minister the word tonight they that wait upon the Lord let's all stand and sing we'll do the prayer request and praise after they that wait upon the Lord shall renew renew their strength they shall bound up my Lord [Music] Hallelujah to way one more time they that wait upon the Lord shall renew the Stray they shall mount with wings as he [Music] go they shall walk and not be wary they shall run and not teach me Lord teach me Lord to wait we do one more time they that wait upon the Lord hallelujah shall renew their strength they shall m temp with wings as he he go oh they shall run and not be wary they shall walk and not teach me Lord teach me Lord to wa [Music] hallelujah amen amen and when it is that good and all the people says amen amen God bless you we don't have that kind of music so I feel a little tempted but I I had to watch the time so but I just love it amen so can I te a little song I made in Grace How Sweet the Sound Dan sing Hallelujah how rich like me oh I once was long but now I am found first blind but now I see amen amen hallelujah Hallelujah Glory thank you Lord could we bow our heads as we approach our father almighty God it's a privilege to stand here before your people and to offer a prayers into your holy presence I'm not worthy Lord so we sang the Lord song Amazing Grace Lord sometimes we're tempted to look behind and see where we came from so that we could remain grounded and not get lifted up cuz when I look around Lord I see myself like job and then I Repent in dust and Ashes and I said oh God be merciful merciful to me and your people and I ask for Mercy because when you get when you send Mercy you send Grace and when you send Grace you send a message and that's why we are here to he amen I don't have a message I cannot have a message but it is your word and I'm grateful that you can use us not to bring our message but to Echo your word amen and therefore may you find me empty willing and submissive and if there's anything in me that will hinder that I beg you and I give you the right to move it and I said Lord empty me so the people would not see me but that they will see your word they will hear your word and it's funny that the brother was speaking about faith and that's what we want to talk about this morning Faith Lord many people think they have faith when it's really hope hope and what we want Lord is to peel back everything break the bir to get to the Kel so that we can get a true picture of who and what we are so that we can get up and get busy and keep pressing because the hour is late so have your own way and this beautiful people that you have here this morning in this wonderful place that is a house of prayer hallu and we thank you that the days are over when it used to be a den of Thieves now it's a place of worship it's a place of worship where we come and we hallowed thy name that you can speak to us cuz if you don't speak we might as well close our books and go home cuz our words does not give virtue but your words even if it is not spoken it is amazing much less when it is spoken he says it's spirit and it is life so I beg you and I plead with you to speak to us we will hear and soften our hearts that the word will not just be for hearing but be for doing and we will not forget I personally will not forget to give you the praise and to give you the glory and to give you the honor that is rightfully due to you Hallelujah so have your own way now and bless the pastor in this congregation is my prayer today in Jesus name and all the people says amen amen and amen and I would like for you to do me a favor and greet the person next to you and share some of that love and when you have done that you can have your seat amen amen it's good to see this well we greet you in the name of the Lord Jesus this morning and let me before I go further let me observe protocol and salute brother Tio oid and his family or his wife and family and I and I think it would be in order to also salute brother Isaac over and brother Gideon over and let me just take a note I was here seven years ago and brother Gideon was the song leader 7 years ago and he was the song leader I remember that so well and I come back and he's not just singing he's not preaching and that's good and all he needs is Barrack amen and then I want to greet Andrew oid and also brother Anthony O'Brien and brother Steven Oliver ver ver very ver I trust I got the names right and I greet you in the name of the Lord and I also want to make special mention to brother kangali we always rapping and brother Clark who I know since 1967 and then all of you brothers and sisters and if there are any ministers here I greet you including those on the hookup and our church in Grenada that is now hookup to the service on behalf of myself and my brother from Grenada the head Deacon brother boen would you stand a little bit amen so God bless you so now that we have passed that difficult let's go to the easy path which is the word and if you don't mind turn with me to Philippians chapter 2 and it's good to be back here I was just telling brother over day I've seen growth almost can recognize it feels like a cathedral it's big nice oh boy Philippians it's right before Colossians and if you can get chapter two I'll be happy and we will read our first scripture I'm a big believer in the word verse five amen amen and let's read it help me read you know help me read and may the Lord bless the reading of the word to our hearts father God let it multiply like bread in Jesus name amen let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus who being in the form of God taught it not robbery to be equal with God but made himself of no reputation pause a minute that means it was not self-centered or self-oriented let's continue and took upon him the form of a servant not the master a form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself pause these days men are being found in a fashion resembling a gr God I hope I don't offend you I I'm a preacher that speak what the Lord give me so if you just get offended just don't take it on all right so you have a lot of men who are grown gods they don't know Jesus came and humbled himself as a man and that is our example and he humbled himself as a man and was found in a fashion resembling what he says but Jesus humbled himself and became what obedient obedient follows humility you can you can be obedient if you're not humble cuz when we when we fell we got we took on an ego when man fell he took on an ego and that ego was from the Beast because he had to prove that he is right even though he born wrong and he has to make himself what he's not but once you go down into humility obedience follows amen it follows and it can't go wrong because if Jesus is the example that's what we follow and watch The Obedience follows and this is something I don't know if you have a problem with it's not obedience to be a nice guy but obedience to death and the death is the death of the self you see God showing us the way once you come into him you have to make some changes you had to make some changes so he became humble and that's the first thing that's why Deuteronomy says if my people which are called by my name shall humble themselves and you can't just get humble just so you can't just walk out and say I'm going to be humbled today see you have to come under the approach you have to come under where the word is cuz Jesus as you as you saw he did not think it robbery to be equal and in that he humbled himself as a man and we have to Humble ourselves unto death amen and our death itself his death was to the Cross Amen on the death of the Cross wherefore God also had highly exalted him see it after death you must rise if you don't rise then die double dead are you following me and you don't want to be dead and then go UND dead again you want to dead and come up I don't care what you do with my body I I got to make sure I can come many people take a lot of money well make sure you do this and some burn and some this and that but that don't mean you coming up Jesus was hum humbled to obedience unto death and then God raised him up and if you want to be in the resurrection and the Holy Ghost is the the what you would call the fouraste of the Resurrection for God to raise you up then you have to go through this process amen and then what what he did he gave him a name and a name that is above every name amen hallelujah and he says there reputation no matter what you all right give him a name wherefore God also highly exalt him and given him a name and a man's name is his reputation no matter what you say and what people say those things cannot erase your reputation because your name carries your reputation you just had to say your name and it works and it brings your life so there is no name on Earth different that's why dying to self is not an option towards eternal life and this name God gave him Jesus in which every knee shall bow of things in heaven and of things on earth and of things under the end you can have your [Music] seat amen but I will continue reading in Romans 10 from verse 8 but what said it the word is nigh thee even in thy mouth and in thy heart that is the word of faith which we preach that if Thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus and Shall Believe in thy heart that God had raised him from the dead only person who could Raise You When God raises you from being dead to the flesh Thou shalt be save amen amen for with the heart man believeth on unto righteousness and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation for the scripture said whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed now I want to skip to verse 14 but then how shall they call on him in whom they have not believed and how shall they believe in whom they have not heard and then how shall they hear without a preacher and watch this and how shall the preacher preach except he is sent by God now don't take this light except he is sent by God but they have not all obeyed the gospel for Isaiah said Lord who hath believed our message our report so then faith in God not by God but in God cometh by what hearing the word of God which is preached amen so if any preacher come and does not preach the word of God he was not sent by God and today we find an abnormaly where the sent preachers are by and large rejected while those who came on their own knowledge and esteem have the larger groups and people follow them as it was done in Jesus Jesus day it cannot change so this morning we want to be identified in the likeness of this Jesus that he just read about and to do so we would look into the mirror of his word amen and then we will see ourselves as genuine Holy Ghost L Believers or we will see ourselves as adversaries not having faith in God's word I'm still in the Bible Hebrews 3 verse 7 wherefore as the Holy Ghost said today if you will hear his voice by who the preachers that were sent Harden not your heart as in the provocation in the day of Temptation in the wilderness I always like to call that in the while when your fathers tempted me and proved me and saw my work 40 years wherefore I was grieved with that generation and said they do always air in their mouth in their head in their hearts and they have not known my ways so I swore in my wrath see what you have now God getting angry because of unbelief and because of not receiving the ministers or the word that he sent through them you now have God a god of wrath not the god of your mind but who he is because he saying I have sent your word and you show off on it you turn your back on it you treat it so so ordinary when it is God himself using man to speak to you cuz if he came himself you'd be dead cuz you can't handle him he did it with Israel and they said no don't let God speak cuz even a dog would die if it touched the mountain where he was and they said we don't want God to speak too much people dying let Moses speak but it didn't change their unbelief cuz when Moses spoke they take up Stone to Stone him so what I am here to tell you this morning unbelief is a terrible thing and it is a deep thing and many people take it for for granted and not realizing that our behavior is connected to either Faith or unbelief now watch this here when your father's tempted me and proved me and saw my Works two years 10 years how is it people can watch God working in their midst this is not a brother you know this is not a pope you know this God and for 40 years from year one to year 40 no change just the same Mary go around the mberry bush just going wrong and wrong you're not here for that God bring you here to change and when you don't change you make God as if he cannot do nothing it's a grief to him and the ministers are laboring sweating and you are laughing playing but it does not go like that because I'll tell you what happened to those who provoked him it's actually a provocation you actually brother Theo didn't get up on there and say you know what I'm going to do this something pull him something let him I didn't I was in the world and something brought me here something bigger than me something brought you here there's many people in the world would like to church places with you and cannot CU they're lost they're blind he brought you here but not to be out much of the same don't change your clothes and be the same change your clothes on your heart and this Hood me 40 years from one year to the 40th year a generation and God there with them worked with them had patience with them where are the people 2.5 million listen they they're not seeing you know some kind of picture you know they seeing the pill of fire they're hearing the tunder of God they see The Works he said my works for 40 years what have you done with it well to whom much is given much is required it's good to follow the message and say where you going to church I'm going by so and I'm going by so and according to if that God sent that man you have more to given account for it's not going to be a walk in the back amen you don't see it now because God have what patience you think you have patience you want to learn about patience check him because you cannot have patience unless you are tried you don't bring out patience unless people are provoking you I don't have to produce patience if I'm cool and calm and collected it's when I'm tried it's when I'm tested it's when I'm provoked to act can I take this off it's provoking me so you don't need patience when all is well a husband don't need patience with a wife that is just wonderful he needs patience with the wife that is going to give him some stress and we never marry the person that is going to be nice we always marry the person that knows how to touch the button that knows how to make us say things we normally in fact make us speak we don't marry the person that you know we just move in and walk out and we marry the person that gets our attention and God does this amazing mystery bring them together it's like a battery positive and negative both are charge yes sir and if you want that car work you had to put the place you had to put the pole in the right place otherwise you have problems you have a life battery but you have Sparks fire explosion so when a man that is married to a wife learns how to handle that you'll find the car working nice but every day you had to remember his pole is right and how Paul is left cuz if he if you forget and put it the wrong place she will test his patience and then God gave the wife the right man so all how I talking to you and answering you're that dummy but that man know if he answer you dead so he had a learn patience that's when I learn patience when I got married later on so what I'm saying is God tested them for 40 years and patience it took him to not wipe them out listen God is not your grandfather in God is not your uncle in God is a consuming fire and he can't change he said Moses careful how you're going with me didn't not no game when he came down to kill all of them MOS say wait wait wait wait wait wait wait I'm in a normal place but still if you go and do that they're going to say we take them out and kill them you say hey I hear what you're saying but all them men who have seen my works and tested me and prove me I know what going to undo with them but according to your word not mine your word I want to show you I'm exercising patience even for you yeah it don't mean go change but I just giving you some slacks so you would see I was not wrong God never wrong never wrong so he had to teach us by patience so he tell Moses I know your nose is long as mine yet but it's come you come in and Moses was given an opportunity to come around and when they talk to him now and we want water water something that is a right Moses called them Rebels shall I go and bring water for you too and God who had told him speak he put that same God aside and in his moment of testing patience left him patience walk out the house tiptoeing and Moses forget who he was he was God and he should have been exercising what the same patience God showed him but he lost his ability to stay and function right his P cross and he hit the water The Rock and hear what God because he's God he sent it God has give you what you wanted even if he bring you in a crush little piece of tissue even if he break you in a crash he just do strange things and he hit the rock water gushed out hello and they drank and they fell good and when everything settled down God riding I me know you come come come come come what happened here God always has come you tell Adam and Eve what to do they did their own thing and God right in hey come give an account of your stship what went on here we are so slack in these ages and in these times we let anything fall God help those ministers to let anything fall you better keep that ship straight cuz you had to give God an account you may not be popular but I rather be unpopular with man and be popular with God Glory Hallelujah now even if you clap that don't put me out cuzz I already have confirmation from above even if you say Amen it don't put me out night cuz I have confirmation from above what I am trying to get you to do is recognize as your pastor just said don't be emotional don't hear message emotional deal with the truth is it the [Music] truth and if it's the truth say Amen even if it's drun in you God going to try his hand and pick you up but don't be emotional and psychedelic [Music] amen thank you brother amen as you can see I'm not young kind of age so you had to bear with my intrinsi because my page turning and I had to keep it I'm you see BR over and them I'm graduate they have computers this is mine all right let me get it now Hallelujah all right I think I'm here now amen so he was grieved with them for 40 years I don't want God to be grieve with me not even for one year he was griev with them for 40 years and what miss you you know it there's a stat in in grenade that easy everybody know what missed you in past you wherefore I was grieved with that generation I notice generation to Moon guy and said they do always air where in their hearts God is not so concerned about what you have in your head now it's what is in your heart cuz the defilement of man is not in his head is in his heart and the biggest organ in your body is your heart not the physical one the spiritual one because it's the Bible even tells us it's so evil and desperately wicked and for it to be desperately wicked it's not shallow and that is the thing we had to deal with from time we born to the time we leave and they have they do not know my ways you come here to learn the ways not for you to bring your ways but to drop your ways and on his always so I swear in my heart they shall what not you see that not your father can help you your brother can help you when God say not is not balling in and helping you just don't move him heart that move him a broken and contrite heart so learn move your attention from the eyes and the head drop it a little lower where you have all them secrets and all of me sries in church you might behave like a priest like a saint I don't know what you do home but what you do home is what a heart is doing when you come to church you might put on a hat h a t but when you're home the h e t Will Rule and I am trying to say we can't fool God we need to get in in that genuine Faith cuz that God Ain changing you might change he remains the same yesterday today and forever we could handle the forever and we could handle yesterday but now problems so he said lest there be thank you in oh that's better in any of you and he's not talking to people in the world he's talking to Brethren lest there be in any of you hello so I swear in my there shall not end to take heed Brethren not Sinners Brethren lest there be in any of you Brethren an evil heart of unbelief what does unbelief do it brings you away from the Living God from the word makes you Doty are you hearing me makes you forget your prayer life make you forget consecration makes you forget that you have to approach God in a certain way God is not your uncle God is Holy always amen so he says lest there be in you a evil heart of unbelief in departing from the Living God but exalt one another daily while it is called today so there's a time when it wouldn't be called today let any of you be hardened to the deceitfulness of unbelief sin if it hadn't been for a prophet coming we would have still be using the word sin but people don't like the word unbelief move that away from me I'm a Believer unbelief that's a a word that tells us exactly what character we have and I am trying to hear you to tell you this morning that your works is your faith or attributes of unbelief and you can't hide that that can't hide amen so I'm speaking to you looking in the mirror of God's word n your mirror cuz some of us are say mirror mirror on the wall and just make yourself change I ain't like this I ain't like that but this mirror where is the change we will change ourselves in the mirror see I like this okay and I put on this and so on the real change has to come from the mirror of the word in the old in the Bible he call them open seers full of what dead men bones you know who was the best dress in them days the priests they looked like God they walk like God they s like God but they were assassinators criminals criminals alone that does pay to kill a man hope I get in trouble PID they paid $30 to assassinate him criminals and Judas was the one that collect the money and where was he living and living and breeding right in Jesus letter and the best place for a criminal to hide is in the police station church is a place for people to hide but that is not the way God intended it it is a place for you to come and make your sacrifice and identify with it by touching it all the Gory blood which represent your sin your with it so when you leave it on your mind when you leave it in your heart when you leave it's there with you you can't make somebody do your religion and you go scotf free nobody was helping you sin Glory I got to go quick so for we are partakers of Christ brethren if we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast you hear the word hold don't let It Go Don't Let It Go What Makes You Let It Go unbelief we come with our bags and we come with our purse but we don't come with our heart when you're ready to go to church we were doing a check when we were coming on and brother Clarence do so I said what wrong what wrong he said just checking making sure everything there and you do that too making sure they he some women here so nicely done you wonder if they're sleeping sun and up so neat but what about the heart what about the heart have you checked your heart before you came is it in the right place who's the last person on your mind where am I I want you to hold it fast onto the when the end not to start but you had to go to the end the race is not for the man that start many people start race and then finish and when they start you swear them going you don't run out fast you pace yourself you said until the end where am I where am I until the end for some when they had heard did provoke God imagine you have the adicity and the g to provoke God let me make a little confession in Grenada we a little different to you is a fastpaced life big everything big when we watch a store and you see the size we like oh I mean it's big do you think it's only the buildings are big the buildings is a is a representation of your thinking and your mindset and your culture big hello big fancy the best I watch your houses and I just want to just put this in here and I said these people don't know what fear is I'm not talking about the fear of God fear like General fear like fear we went I see 160 m hour wind move my roof we run downstairs and you watch the wind coming in the form of a man and my daughter is saying dad make it stop it sounds like a freight train screaming in your head and your fear is so profound that you you pray to Mary Joseph and the rest I was in a house they were pulling beads all kind to stink because at that time you prove if you know God fear so when you have fear you have humility and you think different when you don't have fear and you've never been tested oh you're big who's going to bring you down what's going to happen to you how are you going to come down I'm going to build bigger bands that's what the rich man said I'm going to build bigger bands I don't need this man who told me sell all that I had and come follow me and this man kept all the laws The Ten Commandments he kept and he ended up in hell cuz the Commandments only require knowledge what you remember having a form of godliness where is the power Brother Where is the power to keep you going some people from this just a little thing and they're ready to they get why you doing that when you're in sining why you only doing now when you're under some pressure sin Brave and and and be brave if you're sinning Brave then be brave and the pressure Rich are you hearing me but that only happens when you're big so I am praying Lord don't have mercy I watch your houses them EES 4 feet 6 feet outside hurricane love that it loves it the bigger the E the easier the LIF and if you had a hurricane and I'm not praying it is and just three just a size three 95% of your houses I watch all of them will not be there and that's when you would look up to the sky and remember you have a god you not no roof again that's when you'll be praying in Spanish that's when you'll remember every sermon that's when you'll be promising God I promise I promise God don't need you to promise then he needed a promise here you got a promise now when it's [Music] okay because remember A promise is a comfort to a what you can't fool God you can't fool your own self you to bear with me all right praise God so he says so what you do exalt one another daily while it is called today lest any of you be hardened so brother bam said they hard there preach the harder they get I watch brother sometime preaching and I'm like wow and I come this morning expecting the podium to be full you going to pay this man's sweat is nothing in in vain and those who probably right now making panai panai in Grenada is when you have a Sunday to go to church and you're going to make money we call it panai or you have a time and instead of doing it all that time you're doing it on the day of the Lord when the place should be ramram with all the things are going on here something is wrong you are begging God for judgment and that's the wrong time to come and make promises if you can't do it now tomorrow it will be a lie you should come now today while it is today don't be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin what causes that ver Tim when you lose the fear of God you develop habits and habits is like the first time you you sin and you and you feel you feel a little bad and you walk it over second time is easier the third time is easier after a while is a habit and a habit is something so ingrain in you you can't just get up and say I drop that habit for you to drop that habit the doctor had to say if you do that again you're dead that the only thing we just here dead we living in sin we we dying but we don't want to dead not knowing you are dead while you liveing wake up for we are partakers what's the word partakers partakers means I took part I didn't come and observe do you know how many observers you have in Trinidad you're like the UN I watch the churches me and my brother and he's asking me questions about how we all operate and and I have no answer I said why you don't know and this is a country of knowledge a lot of knowledge this church have more knowledge this one had less knowledge and this one have more knowledge I'm telling you what I find I'm only being honest and I'm asking myself where the Hearts where the Hearts where are the hearts God is not going to bring me in heaven because I know God is going to bring me in heaven because he knows now what I know is if he knows many time you think what you know God know hello where is The Works Jesus said who can condemn me of sin and if you don't believe me check the works check the works because the works identify who I am identification by works that God does I can do nothing except the father show me let's see if you can move on because you're pulling too hard so with whom was he grieve God grieve with man from year one grief not the what Holy Ghost whereby you are sealed what grief if God has to pull his book and said all right pull up Trinidad tell me what is the status come on on what you find Gabriel check it move around and do a a census and come back and give me a report don't I hope to God you don't come and say these people honor at me with their lips but when push come to sh the heart I can't find but five but 10 there one thing you say you support this ministry why you suppose this and when push come and when push come and they really get tough where are you gone for a Higher Ground that's like going down the road he said I'm going with you and he say Well it going be difficult we might face this and don't worry I D with you so upon his Assurance you're going down ain't it and then you hear and when you look you say hey yeah nothing that man gone he didn't even had the aity to say are going he just gone how many members brother too even know where they gone they just gone no letter no notification it's just when he do so sis missing an action sir go on and give that trouble to who somebody else and the other person so gullible a even check them where you come from what have you done how you reach here I don't want nobody stand up with me when I looking for them to G stay home stay home at least Peter was honest he said if it's you are coming and he was walking but then he remember all them troubles and he remember them arguments they had and he remember life and he turned the eyes from the sea from Christ I mean to the Sea what you doing looking down you lose money look forward hallelujah what you doing looking at the brother what you doing looking at the sister look to the word I don't care what they doing look to Christ don't go and collect notes as a traffic police giveing out ticket man you have so much nonsense in the message afraid I don't know how it reach like that after brother Bram had many debts in his family because he was not obedient enough have you ever lost a baby have you ever lost your wife have you ever gone up in a pool and touch her life why you don't know what that is so you can play the fool with [Music] it this Holy Ghost Gospel is dripping with blood and so help me God I don't care if it's five alone I don't care who go I'm going to hold to this Holy Ghost God that's what the message meets go back to K is go back to the days when people search God s God I just pray a lot and this year God just changed it are you normally pray for hour regular and I I'm praying for hour now and I can't connect is when I'm in my second hour I start to get the presence of the spirit why the darkness is so great and the anointing on this atmosphere is so big you Daniel had to pray for a long time he didn't just get you why morus hold back the answer 21 days and that time sin wasn't as now I wonder how much days he has been trying to come to you and if you're not praying much then you let go you can't be fishing get a truck on the line and then say oh gosh I had to go and lead the line there you are to hold on to the line you come to fish you can't do two thing one time all to Gods changing the hand you don't change because he don't change all yes sir I want I said to one I said to all help me all could you help me hold could you help me hold could you help me loud hold one more time hold because you have some people here you didn't even watch didn't even say nothing they they shock I want you to hold I'm not here making sure I'm here I'm here to save your life with the word I don't want you to saiz me you know what soriz mean try to figure me out hear the word if it's true repent if it's true repent and if you're already on the on what you call on the free line praise [Music] I running quick I don't want to get left now watch this but with whom was he G 40 years whole 40 years was it not with them that had sin was it not with them that had unbelief whose carcasses fell away do you know many people in the message have been buried and thinking they're coming up because the pastor preach a night service and as brother T was saying the man had to come and find out who is dead when you read the here they AIT I don't know how you do it here but all criminals in grenade rest in peace how how you create havoc and not and now God will put you in peace you mean in pieces cuz you ain't going to knowwhere you have peace you're going in torment this ARP thing is Catholic rest in peace everybody you think that what going on you think God that's running business or slack you live like a devil walk like a devil act like a devil and you gone now in a in Hell In on I leing the Earth like an angel then God will have to change everything but the wages of sin for the wages of sin and I hearing a word get some voice for the wages of sin and their carcass fell in the wilderness so we see are you seeing they could not enter in because of unbelief now let's look at the other side cuz you have people here who really love the Lord Galatians 5 we looking at one set attributes of what unbelief adultery fornication uncleanliness wait let me stop here because a lot of men don't like to talk about adultery and fornication it going on in the church you have people who are here messing around with people simple sex act by kissing they skin scratching them why they're young and they have men here for them so they want something tall dark and handsome where the only thing you told that can handsome is Al adultery fornication these are things I found these are things God in dream showed me and when I preach it and then the next day the person came and confess Men Don't Preach that because they might be doing it too preachers Don't Preach what they're doing when a god- called man comes he don't care if he hit it himself because it's not about you and I it's about him so you young sisters or young brothers that are messing around and that is unbelief don't wall in as if well all is well well what you doing that one well I trying to get her Sav yeah you're right you tried to get saved not God a guy came one time he saying TR a young lady and he he I said bring him I want to talk to him cuz you the the shepherd is supposed to take care of the sheep some of us has only W the shepherd take of the sheep in church and I said bring him I want to see who it is so we brought him in and we talked to him we said listen this person that interested in he can't move so if you say you love the her God then we want to let you come here and take the word and see if you like it and after a while if you think you like it then you could consider he she but all for now write her off because all you in a different section you unbeliever she's a Believer different section so if you want to come over here you to get a ticket amen amen so come around and hear the word and so on yes yes yes when the meeting over them brothers come said that man bowled down that hill so fast they didn't even know where he passed he has not yet returned what was he saying what was his Testament before I like the message I like to hear brother Tim preach where on the internet but when he came face to face and his true intentions was revealed he B help me thank you I like that word he bolt bolt is not Walking Bolt is run fast cuz he didn't expect to meet fire why here is not no painted fire no no no picture the word in any preacher's hand is a sword is a hammer but you have a lot of men with weak hand Fred S Fred Hammer when the hammer make noise oh they drop it then move out the pulpit that all the trouble coming from I know you can't get me in trouble because leaving tomorrow so let me finish I'm going quick lasciviousness idolatry witchcraft hatred big one big big one CU you have people call silent hatred and Silent is when G people silent treatment in the church and that sister know like them and that sister you're giving them the silent treatment because what you think or perceive they did because you've already judged them as being a hypocrite and a of course you are not you are wonderful you are saved you are Sanctified you have the Holy Ghost which one we could dig out sin in people but we a have none in US before you could find fault with her make sure you not no beam or a lampole in your eye so that's supposed to make you humble don't find fault with them what were you I can't come and preach to you unless God preach to me I can beat my children if I can't get licks then I go I go bad beat them but when I get licks I know what it is like so then he said no you qualify to beit variance emulation rth that's a big one that R is pointed to the word how dare he who does he think he is I I find in another church think that ice cream Strife sedition heresies envying murders drunkenness rebeling these things shall not inherit eternal life let's go in our area now when I bring it tell me if you have it love I'm not talking about love why you love me I love you I'm talking about love to the person that hate you bless them that hate you that curse you that say all manner of evil against you for why that is what God does to us he send the Son and the rign on the evil and the good when you could do Matthew 5 on now people don't like Matthew 5 because like God talking and he identifying our ways and they asking him questions and he said when you could do that then come and talk to me amen love joy peace all these qualities from God cannot come just so adversity brings them they are not just so you don't get joy just so adversity had to bring some sorrow for you to appreciate Joy otherwise your joy would be shortlived I'm not talking about your joy I'm talking about his Joy where it say always since God brought me back I have never one day been I don't know why the right word I've been on fire and the fire getting hotter now I'm all now sad peace longsuffering Gent gentleness goodness meekness hello meekness Temperance controlling the tongue controlling the tongue that iniquity that fire and then Faith Jesus said when I come shall I find Faith you think God say that just so he saw the generation that when he come fit will be very scarce that's right unbelief taking over and people thinking that they're mared and they're going along Jesus gave us the best example of what we ought to be looking like when he rejected his life for us by his word now as we go along this life we got to know that our character molds the image that we are and what we show to others when they look at us your image is your character your identity and who we are so as you so is your character amen and it molds or create an atmosphere around you amen so when it molds that character there are people you like being around Believers I'm talking hello are you there do your answer right well talk to me they create an atmosphere that you like being around that's Christ that not them because when it was us we didn't even like we own self we have problem with we ownself I have found myself saying in the past why you so stupid me I telling me that but when he comes it makes you tolerant to others so people don't mind being around you and there are others Brethren that as soon as you can get a chance you Bol foul you say Believers sure I don't know what they believe but they are believers but you don't want to be around them because the atmosphere they create it is contous it puts you on edge you're there with them but you smile on fake you're like you're trying to do the smile but ain't going good you're not stretching as he supposed to stretch so he can't you come so he go so you're trying your best to to walk around it why the image and character is molded by who they are are closing wow there's so much here I had to find a place to close by amen all right so when God look upon his lost creation his creation had fallen his loving character molded himself self into the person of Jesus Christ or his own character of Love projected himself in the man Christ Jesus so much Paul said think it not robbery but make himself equal to God by his own character molded that kind of a person and no one could ever do that but God he did it that way to pay the penalty for the fall of creation someone or something had to die someone as something had to save this creation and no one and nothing could do it because the highest species of his creation had fallen that's man and we need to understand that you came lost you didn't come save you came lost to be saved and therefore if you didn't go through the process of justification sanctification baptism or Holy Ghost you a ready yet you must go through the process must there's no option amen and each phase is a test is a trial and that's what that why people don't pray they are no test no test no trial no prayer amen so let me finish I'm trying to get a little space here so there was there has there was only one thing left that did not fall and that was God in the heavens so something of the heavens had to come down to redeem this creation because there was nothing here that could create it and God's Own love for the World created the character Express in Christ he was God's character he was God's expressed image in him was God God was in Christ revealing himself to the world and no love could ever be greater than his love this ought to put the whole world to shame to see what a condition we have fallen into and God projecting himself made a Plan of Redemption which is a by black pan by back plan for creation to redeem this Fallen character of ours and this he did to meet the penalty of the Fall which was death the day you eat the day you die and man died indeed he died also he was the only one free from the penalty of death and he came to bring us back to life from Death bring us back from unbelief which caused the fall bring us to Faith hello and what did Faith do it broke the fall and when he came as the infant Jehovah Crying In A Manger he was the truth the way the life and he brought us back to God but he came at a great price his mother Mary I like I can't leave unless I bring you this his mother Mary because why Joseph or husband had a big fight trying to bend his fate around what Moses told him he had a lot of faith he was a just man but when that reach Faith unto unbelief what reach her pregnany and he didn't touch her he was a just man and he was so just that he couldn't not believe that Mary was telling the truth how does a just man become an unbeliever and there was Mary yes I did nothing you know I wouldn't do anything yes I hear in you he gone to work he on mind he coming back home with on mind what on him mind Satan telling him things this girl pregnant and she trying to hide the shame because in those days if you're pregnant outside of marriage they Stone you to death and she don't want to be ston to so she F hiding behind you you the righteous man she no good today we still thinking so she do good then I must get rid of her not once did Joseph pray why it was not in his DNA to check what he don't know and you have a right when you don't understand go to God don't try to fix it you will be like usah you might be touching things you're supposed to touch sometime God have it shaken right in front of you to see what you going do God don't need your help he need your surrender he need your consecration glory to God and there was Joseph having a hard time to Benny mind around the truth and many people in the message have a hard time bending their mind around the truth especially in this message so what they have done everybody when this one in like what he start a new group and then that one start another one and then why Bing their mind around the truth we have a new one in Grenada they stopped their communion sorry I hope all you get me in trouble so the brother came to me from Trinidad he coming my home how you doing brother I say I'm trying to figure out what the secret AG I want cuz normally he don't come by me because we you know he in a different levels he high high up I reach up there yet and he come by me with a book I said don't bring that bookie I telling you up front I won't read it and there's another minister in the messaging he bringing that book I said no don't bring that book here so I then I ask him questions I said so what you doing now you on Zoom y allers have communion oh um we don't need that anymore I said how come we don't need that anymore when you get the Mysteries and you understand the Mysteries then you know communion is over I realize I need to get a mysterious man out of my life and I had to cut the thing there I can't believe that nonsense when Jesus said that as much as you do it you do show it to the Lord's death till I come and you have people in Your Country turning that not even the pop could do that not even the B would take that chance and know he move pocket Tre but he won't take that chance he like chalice and he give it out your wrong bread and man in the message stop it not even in Rome I don't know all eating here something real radically wrong and for people to stay and believe that then it tells me it's an evil heart of unbelief that is so deep and the devil don't care how much he kill the devil don't feel sorry for nobody tell me one thing the devil ever do for you nothing nothing nothing everything that ever happened to you was God helping you then why you can't give me your life why is Soo much trouble why all the stress why serving somebody that only bashing you you don't have to be bright you just have to recognize truth from error and people could follow that man leave me Gren let me stay simply I don't need that break the word and fix the word and move the word to justify your unbelief and Joseph willing to justify his unbelief says I know what I would do Satan give him my brain wave you say Satan yes God a't give him it I'm going to put her away privately so that she can retain her her whatever it is for the next person she married so nobody will know that much I'll do I find that is just and right and he went to sleep that night and God came to this to deliver his word not Joseph not Joseph he came to deliver his word because his word was already under reproach you know how much trouble Joseph caused by that behavior people get to know what happened with Joseph by but the man wife pregnant and we don't know he he's saying is not he he go talk he go have a confidence and you go ask him what you think and then that kind of talk do can't keep down and he talk with pregnancy can't keep down because prescy is a rising thing and the talk is a rising thing Jesus born with a stigma they said we be not born of fornication who cause it who cause it the Brethren that's right who caused the world to speak against us the Brethren that's right he started that lie and God had to come and fix it notice God didn't even tell him Joseph you could do better than that he just say listen what is happening to her is of the Holy Ghost ain't even give him another Comfort is of the Holy Ghost so cool yourself back off back off brother back off my word hello get yourself in the right order so much just and righteous men in the place and God had to tell her back off it ain't about you it's about her cuz what was in her was our Salvation even for Joseph even for Joseph he was getting rid of the very thing that came to save him and the very thing God sent to deliver his people the Holy Ghost has I'm coming down has been rejected and replaced by men they are now the Holy Ghost to the people because the genuine Holy Ghost will not stand for them nonsense and God told Samuel they have not rejected me you sorry but they have rejected me but give them what I want and they got a king after their own fashion if you read the Bible you will think that God give it to them no God never make a mistake he know what you want and he see Samuel Saul tall and handsome and full of brain no heart no prayer life die what they want game even make Samuel sorry Saul going in church and get an anointing speaking like a prophet you know Prophet you get it on the flesh you never change but die the choice die The People's Choice you have a church in Gren called The People's Church and people only look for a church where they like where they could live how they want do you understand it this thing catch me and it's hold me Joseph you do that and watch me Joseph never thought for one minute he was wrong he was justifying his unbelief if he had read the scriptures in Isaiah that's right a virgin shall conceive he should have having a party my wife is the [Music] best no you want to play big shot and just try and think it out when you get a message I wonder if he apologize to her the Bible didn't say and when you are wrong do you apologize no you move on and you think all is well God say remember people come to the prophet the prophet say oh I see this in your life you know what the prophecy a man Thief money in a Catholic Church when he was an alter boy some 20 something years he said go and fix that in a Catholic Church you said that was see in your life with the god you say bring back brother Brenham bring back brother Brenham and he had the Holy Ghost brother Brenham ride his Trail and then the Holy Ghost is here speaking to you by the word [Music] hallah in your heart those are you are here this morning you know if God is speaking to your heart don't try to move it don't try to justify it if you're wrong you're wrong you can be wrong and strong you can be wrong and right when you're wrong you make it right then you begin the stage of humility so that God could raise you it I better close to that because she had to be broken let me just leave this little piece that was pregnant it was not orchestrated by a man unknown to Joseph in fact she did not even lay with anyone and yet though pregnant she was still a virgin and untouched and to lose her virginity she had to be broken by her human being like her but the Bible clearly says she knew no man and Joseph was a just man proper in Luke 1 26-38 and Matthew 1:18 read it as you bow your head in the interest of time we will come I have so much to hear but in the interest of time because I don't want you to overeat just want you to think about these things cuz you have a man of God here giving you the same word but I want you to appreciate that it's not him is that he sent by God or he's not sent by God and if he's sent by God don't provoke god let's bow heads let's all stand appreciate what you have a prophet is never having honor in his own country why because the people are blind they're in the forest and they can't see the trees I want you to check yourself this morning in the little simple message you have heard if there is something that the Lord has spoken in your heart and you said brother Tim I what you said is the truth I'm inviting you this is called our Altar and I believe in altars and I believe in making consecration I would advise you to come and talk to God because when we do wrong publicly we can't get by privately just walk here and say Lord I heard your word and I want to have faith not unbelief I want those attributes gone and I want to have a attribute of faith if you think you can willing to do that I'll stand here with you but come let God I will pray with you so that you would not be the same now if you don't come don't say you didn't get a chance because you don't come when you want you come when God calls you and he said my word never returns void hello so let's bow our heads Heavenly Father I've given the invitation and you see I leave it in your care and in your hands thank you for the opportunity that you given unto us so that we can be an echo of your word whatever happens they know they have no excuse there's no excuse because it's known now let it produce a life let it produce a life let it produce faith in God let the people have a Vengeance to defy and to destroy all Disobedience so that they can serve God in spirit and in [Music] truth Jesus keep as we called God bless you hey somebody came the cross is there anyone else PR f [Music] oh

Come Close Your Eyes I'm not the one to give it to you I'm the one who used to speak to you but the one that you are talking to now is the invisible God The Immortal the invisible the powerful the omnipotent no omnipresent and he's real I know he's real I had a daughter she was suffering from Epsy and she would have it while she's sleeping and it bothered me and I went to God I said Lord I can handle it and to see her suffer so I began to pray and one day I found the place where the Prophet said he had a case like that and he jued the shirt burned it and pray and so when she had the next case I pulled it off I burnt it and I said Lord in the name of Jesus Christ may this devil never return amen she was about 15 she's now 35 never had another case but it gets better I have a little dog in the house and you might say well this is crazy no it's not he's God of everything yes and my dog was sick and gasping like if he was dying and I was sleeping I just finished praying and while I was there he came down right in front of me because when I'm praying he's always near me and he came down I don't know who sent him I'm only telling you what I experienced and he came right there and something said Tim get up and pray for the dog and I was so tired I didn't do and he went back up and I said if he come back down I'll pray for him and there he was right by me and I dropped from my and I Lay My Hands in the dog and I said oh God he came here he need help please he's a dog but he needs help you're are the god of the whole creation and after I prayed I went back to sleep and I got up and may been another half an hour and the dog was sleeping [Music] upstairs it was over we had a little sister her blood was too from hemorr fibroids I called the doctor and they said we got to cut and she said no brother I'm not going to cut I said if that's your faith I'm standing with you long story short today she's working breathing and the fibroids is going it's gone so much that there's
