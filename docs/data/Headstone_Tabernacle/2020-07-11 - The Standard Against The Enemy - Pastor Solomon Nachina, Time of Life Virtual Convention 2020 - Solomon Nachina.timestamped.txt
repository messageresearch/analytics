[27:55] ministry that will be preaching in the
[27:58] right season like the inspiration that
[28:02] gap plate and the heart of brother of it
[28:05] in time of life how important my
[28:09] brethren it is to have a revelation of
[28:11] the life knowing beloved that with Adam
[28:15] and Eve because of unbelief let the
[28:19] garden even but the branch said that
[28:22] they was separated from the written
[28:25] their dominion and the life when they
[28:29] left the garden Adam and Eve they were
[28:32] determined to die they were determined
[28:35] to die boga promised that in the end
[28:39] time he were going to restore again
[28:43] an allow men to be connected again to
[28:48] life
[28:49] we know that through time and century
[28:52] the book was sealed inside the book what
[28:56] the mistress seal of how man was going
[29:00] to return to his inheritance to his
[29:04] Dominion and how men was going to be
[29:07] connected a game to life to never die
[29:10] again 1963 the Lord Himself descended
[29:14] from heaven with the sharp the voice and
[29:16] the trumpet this 7 Thunder revealed the
[29:20] mystery of the book by which the lamb
[29:24] out of this seal the lamb opened the
[29:28] seal and the angel brought this book
[29:32] with one foot on the sea and on the
[29:35] earth roar as a lion roar the Bible say
[29:39] when he wrote seven Thunder ordered a
[29:42] voice John was about to write but he was
[29:45] not allowed to read the minister the
[29:48] mystery that was preserved for this time
[29:50] what what the mystery is talking about
[29:52] how man was going back to life how he
[29:56] was gonna be connected to life how he
[29:59] was going to be connected to eternity so
[30:01] beloved I believe that these ministers
[30:04] will be indeed with the Holy Ghost but a
[30:07] perfect season of the seven seals to
[30:11] bring forth an open the proper of God
[30:15] say if this man not cheap to catch this
[30:19] in Abrahamson
[30:21] if this man catch this they will bring
[30:24] the people to a place I have brought the
[30:27] world in seed for that will put a better
[30:31] sense they will put the right sense
[30:35] beloved I believe that the minister the
[30:38] ministry during the convention in Canada
[30:41] they will bring virtual power to be able
[30:44] to open the world and connect the bride
[30:48] down the line
[30:49] of God so therefore beloved was put work
[30:55] by the prophet of God when he went home
[30:58] the angel remain he fulfilled his first
[31:03] stage the shower before Taurus and the
[31:08] Prophet told us they were three stages
[31:11] for the rapture the shout the voice and
[31:13] the Trump what was the shell the shell
[31:16] wasn't a messenger waking up the brow
[31:20] and messenger gathering in a bright
[31:23] that's what he said but Abram said that
[31:27] the seventh on the will do we wake up
[31:29] the bright and will gather the price but
[31:32] the brand went home but the end you
[31:34] still behind because all say that the
