[11:33] worth thee. Let's just give him a hand
[11:35] of praise tonight.
[11:37] Blessed be his wonderful
[11:40] name. Thank you,
[11:43] Jesus. Thank you, lamb of
[11:47] God. Hallelujah. You love the Lord
[11:50] tonight. Amen. Amen. I hope you come
[11:53] under
[11:54] expectation. I'm excited. I feel
[11:56] something great is about to happen and
[11:59] something good is in store
[12:02] tonight. Amen. If you have your Bibles,
[12:04] I'd like to turn with me quickly um from
[12:08] the book of
[12:09] Psalms, reading chapter 63, the first
[12:13] few verses
[12:14] [Music]
[12:25] there. And it says, "Oh God, thou art my
[12:29] God. Early will I seek thee. My soul
[12:32] thirsteth for thee. My flesh longeth for
[12:35] thee in a dry and thirsty land where no
[12:38] water is to see thy power and thy glory.
[12:41] So as I have seen thee in the sanctuary
[12:44] because thy loving kindness is better
[12:46] than life. My lips shall praise thee.
[12:49] Thus will I bless thee while I live. I
[12:52] will lift up my hands in thy name. My
[12:55] soul shall be satisfied as with marrow
[12:57] and fattness, and my mouth shall praise
[13:00] thee with joyful lips. May we bow our
[13:02] heads as we open in a word of
[13:07] prayer. Oh precious father, Lord,
[13:11] tonight we deem it such a privilege to
[13:13] be gathered together, Lord. Lord, we
[13:15] didn't gather in vain. We didn't gather
[13:17] to just see each other, Lord, or just to
[13:19] talk, Lord. But we have gathered on
[13:21] expectation to hear from you, Lord.
[13:24] Lord, we pray that you would come down
[13:25] and show up strong tonight. That you
[13:28] will speak lip to air to your people,
[13:30] Lord. Lord, that you will come and fill
[13:32] and fulfill and meet every need here
[13:34] tonight. Every home that's represented,
[13:37] Lord, every family, every individual,
[13:39] Lord, I pray that you speak to hearts,
[13:41] Lord, that lives be changed and
[13:43] transformed. Those that are not
[13:45] physically here, but might be connected
[13:46] on the internet, Lord, that might be
[13:48] home or wherever they are, Lord, or may
[13:50] interact with this content after, Lord.
[13:52] I pray that your presence be with them,
[13:54] that your power be with them, that you
[13:56] will go out and fill them, that you will
[13:58] heal them, that you will restore them,
[14:00] that you will deliver, that you'll
[14:01] baptize, that you'll lift them up and
[14:03] set them free, Lord. Lord, I pray that
[14:05] your power would go out, Lord. Lord,
[14:07] that your spirit will flow out, Lord.
[14:10] Lord, that your people be filled and
[14:11] refilled and they be baptized, Lord. I
[14:14] pray that you'll inspire us and
[14:16] encourage us, Lord. Help us to to
[14:18] worship and to praise you and to lift
[14:20] you up and create such an atmosphere
[14:23] that you'll be so pleased to dwell,
[14:25] Lord, that the minister could hardly
[14:26] minister, Lord. Lord, that you would
[14:28] have your full and and perfect will,
[14:31] Lord. You will have preeminence tonight,
[14:33] Lord. Lord, we want to to sing the way
[14:35] you want us to sing. We want to speak
[14:36] the things you want us to speak, Lord.
[14:38] And we want to give you all the praise,
[14:40] all the honor, and the glory. Bless your
[14:42] musicians, bless your singers, bless
[14:44] your officers, your worshippers, Lord,
[14:45] your people gathered together and those
[14:47] that could make it. I pray that you be
[14:49] with them in a special way in Jesus'
[14:51] name. Amen.
[14:54] Amen. Thank you, lamb of God. Blessed be
[14:58] his wonderful name.
[15:01] Amen. Let's sing that song. There's
[15:03] going to be a meeting in the air.
[15:05] [Music]
[15:11] In the air, in the sweet sweet by and
[15:17] by, I am going to meet you and greet you
[15:23] over there in a home beyond the
[15:29] sky. Oh, such singing you will hear.
[15:33] Never heard by mortal air. It will be
[15:36] glorious. I do
[15:40] declare and God's own son will be the
[15:45] leading one at the meeting in the
[15:51] air. Oh, you have heard of little Moses
[15:56] and a bull
[15:57] rush. You have heard of failless David
[16:01] and his sling.
[16:03] Oh, you have heard the story told of
[16:06] Dream and
[16:08] Joseph and of Jonah and the whale. We
[16:12] often
[16:14] sing. There are many, many others
[16:18] through the
[16:19] Bible. I should like to meet them all. I
[16:23] do declare.
[16:26] Oh, by and by the Lord will surely let
[16:29] us meet them at the meeting in the
[16:35] air. Oh, there is going to be a meeting
[16:41] in the air in the sweet sweet by and
[16:47] by. I am going to meet you and greet you
[16:52] over there in the home beyond the
[16:58] sky. Oh, such singing you will hear,
[17:02] never heard by mortal lair, will be
[17:06] glorious, I do
[17:10] declare. And God's born son will be the
[17:15] leading one.
[17:19] in the Let's just sing one more verse.
[17:22] Oh, many things will there be missing in
[17:25] that
[17:26] meeting. Oh, for the mourers punch will
[17:30] have no place at
[17:32] all. There will never be a sermon
[17:36] preached to
[17:38] sinners, for the sinner refused to hit
[17:42] the call.
[17:44] There will be no morning over away what
[17:48] love ones. There will be no night of
[17:52] pleading
[17:54] prayer. All our burdens and our anguish
[17:58] will be
[18:00] lifted at the meeting in the
[18:05] air. Oh, there is going to be a meeting
[18:11] in the air. In the sweet sweet by and
[18:17] by. I am going to meet you, meet you
[18:22] over there in the home beyond the sky.
[18:29] Oh, such singing you will hear, never
[18:32] heard by mortal air will be glorious, I
[18:37] do
[18:39] declare, for God's own son will be the
[18:44] leading one at the meeting in the air.
[18:51] Oh, I'm pressing on. Say on with all I
[18:56] know. I'm pressing
[18:58] on on with all I know. I'm pressing on
[19:04] to that
[19:07] city. Then there's a mansion prepared
[19:11] for me. Just one more time. I'm pressing
[19:14] on. Set a home with all I know. I'm
[19:19] pressing
[19:20] on on with all I know. I'm pressing on
[19:27] to that
[19:29] city. There's a mansion prepared for
[19:38] me. Blessed be his
[19:41] name.
[19:43] Hallelujah. Thank you,
[19:45] Jesus. Thank you, Father.
[19:49] Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. Amen. You love
[19:52] him tonight. What a mighty God we serve.

[24:27] could go to the east, west, north,
[24:29] south, and we'll never find anybody like
[24:31] you. Anybody who could love us like you
[24:34] do, Lord, who could forgive us and
[24:36] redeem us and save us and raise us up.
[24:39] Lord, we ever so grateful. We owe our

[24:53] need us, but you chose us anyway. You
[24:57] selected us before the foundation of the
[25:00] world, knowing that we'll be here in
[25:02] this hour. Thank you, Jesus. We love
[25:04] you, Lord. We praise you. Let's just

[27:07] Thank you
[27:09] Jesus. Blessed be the wonderful name of
[27:12] the
[27:12] Lord. Amen.
[27:15] Amen. At this time we want to switch
[27:17] over to the word portion of the
[27:20] service. Amen.
[27:26] So I want to invite you to have your
[27:28] seats.
[27:37] Amen. What a blessing it is to be here
[27:40] together again
[27:42] to fellowship around the word.
[27:45] Amen. Thank you, brother
[27:51] Steven. Before I begin, I just want to
[27:54] share something
[27:56] briefly. And in putting together this
[27:59] message, you know, I felt that this
[28:02] thought needed to be delivered in a
[28:04] particular way that everyone would
[28:07] understand. I don't want to be too long.
[28:10] I want to be simple, clear, concise, you
[28:12] know, with that background. And as a
[28:15] preamble to the message tonight, I want
[28:18] to share a brief quote from the prophet
[28:20] with you. Amen.
[28:22] You love him. What a mighty God we
[28:25] serve.
[28:26] from a message
[28:29] perseverance paragraph 30 it says
[28:31] brother sister I don't know when I want
[28:34] you to listen now he say I'll make my
[28:36] last trip to Chicago one day this may be
[28:40] it but I'm telling you in the name of
[28:43] the Lord Jesus the gospel is true
[28:47] this is the last days we're living in
[28:50] the shadow of his coming whatever you do
[28:53] press into the kingdom of God. Amen. If
[28:56] there is one little touch that strikes
[28:58] your heart, you come quickly while you
[29:02] have the opportunity to come cuz the
[29:05] hour is approaching when it'll be too
[29:07] late.
[29:09] And then you'll never want to come no
[29:11] more. There won't be any more call in
[29:13] your heart. And then no matter how much
[29:16] you did try, you would never get in.
[29:21] When the last member is added to that
[29:23] body for the
[29:25] rapture, there'll never be another one
[29:27] saved.
[29:29] The doors are
[29:30] closed as it was in the day of
[29:33] Noah and there will be no salvation
[29:36] left. Though people will think there
[29:38] will be, that's where the trouble is
[29:41] going to come. See,
[29:44] this brothers and sisters is what I want
[29:47] to just lay as a background for the
[29:49] message tonight.
[29:51] And for a
[29:53] title, every man must press.
[29:58] My inspiration, God knows your heart.
[30:00] Despite what you say, despite what you
[30:03] do, he knows your heart. Amen. So, let's
[30:06] just stand for the reading of his word.
[30:10] And if you have your Bibles, I'd like
[30:12] you to turn with me to the book of Luke,
[30:14] reading a few scriptures there. Luke
[30:18] reading from chapter
[30:21] 16 vers 13-
[30:29] 16. When you find it, say
[30:32] amen. Okay. Reading from Luke 16. It
[30:35] says in verse 13, "No servant can serve
[30:40] two
[30:41] masters. For either he will hate the one
[30:45] and love the other, or else he will hold
[30:48] to the one and despise the other. He
[30:52] cannot serve God and mammon."
[30:55] In verse 14 it says, "And the Pharisees
[30:58] also who will covet us, heard all these
[31:03] things, and they derided
[31:05] him." And he said unto them, "Ye are
[31:09] they which justify yourselves before
[31:11] men, but God knoweth your hearts." Amen.
[31:15] For that which is highly esteemed among
[31:17] men is abomination in the sight of God.
[31:20] And verse 16, the law and the prophets
[31:23] were until John. Since that time the
[31:26] kingdom of God is preached, and every
[31:29] man presseth into it. Amen. Let's just
[31:33] bow our heads for a word of prayer. Oh
[31:35] heavenly father, Lord, tonight you've
[31:38] given us one more
[31:40] opportunity, one more time to gather
[31:42] together, Lord, to fellowship around
[31:44] your word, Lord, for you to speak to our
[31:46] hearts, Lord. Lord, we pray that you
[31:48] take me out of the way, Lord, and you
[31:51] put this message together the way you
[31:52] want it delivered, Lord. Lord, that you
[31:55] will arrange your words the way you want
[31:56] it to be spoken, Lord. Lord, I pray that
[31:59] lives be changed and transformed and
[32:02] hearts be be, Lord, so uplifted, Lord,
[32:06] that they realize the hour we are living
[32:08] in and they realize what they're
[32:10] challenged and called to do tonight,
[32:12] Lord. Lord, I pray that your hand of
[32:14] mercy and grace extend right now, Lord.
[32:17] Lord, to your people, not just gathered
[32:18] here, Lord, but the people who might be
[32:20] looking on online, Lord. Lord, I pray
[32:23] that you have your perfect will in this
[32:25] service, Lord. Lord, I pray that you
[32:28] deliver your love letter to your people
[32:29] tonight. Lord, I pray that we leave here
[32:32] free, Lord. That we leave here with a
[32:35] praise in our lips and a worship in our
[32:36] hearts, knowing who we are, knowing who
[32:39] you are and what you have in store for
[32:40] us, Lord. Lord, have your perfect will
[32:43] in this service in Jesus name. Amen.
[32:47] Amen. May have your seats.
[32:50] Amen.
[32:52] Bless his holy name.
[32:55] You know, as I read that scripture, I I
[32:57] need to say to press, you have to do
[32:59] something. You can't rock back and
[33:02] press. It's not something you can lie
[33:03] down in a bed and you just press. Press
[33:06] is not automated. Despite AI and
[33:09] technological developments, press
[33:11] requires work. It requires that you have
[33:13] something to do. So while pressing you
[33:16] might get hurt. You could get hurt while
[33:19] you press. Perhaps you might get
[33:20] embarrassed,
[33:22] ridiculed, ostracized. You might even
[33:25] lose some friends because you're
[33:26] pressing. Despite that, we can't just
[33:30] sit back and expect things to work out
[33:33] because you're a child of God. You're
[33:35] son of God and daughter of God, and
[33:37] everything's supposed to work out fine
[33:38] because God is a good God. Amen.
[33:41] That's right.
[33:44] But he wants you to press. He wants you
[33:46] to fight. He wants you to work. He need
[33:49] you to labor, to travail. He wants you
[33:51] to hunger and thirst after
[33:52] righteousness. He wants you to love him
[33:55] and love one another. He wants you to
[33:57] forgive. He wants you to pray and have a
[34:00] relationship with him, to understand
[34:03] him, to know him. So there is something
[34:06] that we are required and called upon to
[34:08] do.
[34:10] That's the press tonight. Hallelujah.
[34:12] You know in a message
[34:14] investments paragraph 109 the prophet
[34:17] said and Noah's
[34:18] family seeing that the father meaning
[34:21] Noah a good man was pounding away
[34:24] building the ark his sons and his
[34:26] daughter-in-law and so on they
[34:29] compounding away with him
[34:31] bearing the reproach of the word this
[34:34] wasn't his opinion this was the reproach
[34:37] of the word prophet said you always have
[34:40] to do that the kingdom of God doesn't
[34:43] come without trials.
[34:45] It's not an easy road. It's not an easy
[34:47] ride.
[34:50] Amen. Men press into it into the kingdom
[34:53] of God. Not observation.
[34:56] No. But it paid off in saving his life.
[35:00] We could stay on hours talking about
[35:02] Noah,
[35:03] but we don't have hours tonight. Amen.
[35:06] You know, when there's a call to press,
[35:11] there's often
[35:14] apprehension, there's often some anxiety
[35:17] because you have to manage expectations
[35:19] cuz I said you have to work.
[35:22] So, the interesting thing about pressing
[35:25] is like a fire at home. If you're in bed
[35:27] and you know it, and you realize smoke
[35:31] emanating from the kitchen area, you
[35:34] have to get into action. Amen. You can't
[35:36] lie down, lay back and relax and say,
[35:39] "Well, you know what? I real tired here
[35:42] because I work whole day and oh gosh, my
[35:44] body aching." You'll be burnt up. The
[35:48] blaze will overcome you.
[35:50] Amen. But there is something called
[35:52] adrenaline that takes over when you
[35:55] become desperate.
[35:57] Desperation usually
[36:00] ignites almost like a hidden power in
[36:02] you that you didn't even know you had.
[36:05] and cause you to operate contrary to how
[36:07] people believe you should. When you're
[36:10] called to press or in order to press,
[36:12] you need to get desperate.
[36:14] Without desperation, there's no real
[36:16] desire to press
[36:19] to
[36:21] change. It requires great effort. When
[36:24] everything is all right, you don't have
[36:26] to worry because you feel you're at ease
[36:28] in Zion. But when circumstances make you
[36:32] desperate, your mindset has to change,
[36:35] your attitude has to change, your
[36:38] behavior has to change. Like I say, it
[36:40] cause you to do things that seem out of
[36:42] the ordinary. It cause you to do things
[36:45] that are a little extra. It caused you
[36:48] to act a little extreme that folks would
[36:50] be like, "I never expected them to do
[36:52] that. I can't believe they do that. They
[36:55] jump over the wall, you know, because
[36:57] they were desperate.
[36:59] In this scripture, they say, "Listen,
[37:02] the kingdom of God is preached." And
[37:04] every man is required. That includes
[37:07] your parents, your children, your
[37:10] spouse, your your your family members.
[37:14] They're not exempt from the work
[37:16] required to press. They have to. If you
[37:20] want to be in the kingdom, you have to
[37:21] press because it's a challenge. is a
[37:25] requirement of the hour. You heard it
[37:28] read earlier. The hour is late. We're in
[37:31] the last days. I don't have to prove
[37:33] that to you. You know it. Everybody
[37:35] does. It's nothing new I'm saying. But
[37:39] here in the scripture in the book of
[37:42] Luke, they highlighted a special need
[37:45] that despite what the Pharisees say,
[37:49] despite what you may have in your mind,
[37:53] there's a special requirement that the
[37:55] kingdom of God is preached and every man
[37:58] that want to be inside have to press.
[38:01] Amen.
[38:03] Now there's a message brother Brandon
[38:05] preached called desperations.
[38:08] And in that he gave a story and just as
[38:10] a backdrop there was a a meeting there
[38:13] and a guy was healed of blindness
[38:17] and there were tons of people. As a
[38:19] matter of fact they had to put the
[38:20] prophet over a wall to get to to the
[38:22] meeting. It was so much persons around.
[38:24] When he got there there was a big
[38:26] chaotic arrangement going on. Billy Paul
[38:28] came and said listen here what we have a
[38:31] problem. The prayer cards are finished.
[38:34] We don't have anymore. But we have a
[38:36] woman at this meeting who pressing.
[38:41] Now pressing is not a kind of polite
[38:44] thing. You know, pressing requires
[38:47] activity. It requires a level of
[38:50] disruption. Because you remember, you're
[38:52] not acting normal. Because when your
[38:55] circumstances are dire, when things seem
[38:57] tough, when your back against the wall
[38:59] and you have nowhere to turn and and
[39:01] people calling you and you don't know
[39:03] what going to happen next and what's
[39:04] your next move, trust me, you have to do
[39:07] something different. You have to press.
[39:09] So in this particular
[39:11] meeting, paragraph 144, so we come up to
[39:14] there. This is in Mexico now.
[39:17] It said she she said my baby is dead. So
[39:20] she had a need. Look at her
[39:22] circumstance. Her baby was dead. It's
[39:25] been dead since this morning. I must get
[39:27] in there. You hear the word must. That's
[39:30] why in the title it say you must press.
[39:32] It's not an option. You know, it's it's
[39:35] mandatory. You know, sometimes you fill
[39:37] a form and you see optional things like
[39:39] that. You might want to fill it out. No,
[39:42] this here is mandatory. Her circumstance
[39:45] dictated insisted that she had to do
[39:48] something different. So in this case
[39:50] they say I must get in there and she was
[39:53] coming prayer card or not with or
[39:57] without it. Listen, no matter what,
[40:01] you're doing whatever it takes to get
[40:04] the outcome you're looking for. Amen.
[40:06] Amen. And they lined up about 300 ushers
[40:10] there and she'd go right under their
[40:12] legs and jump right up on top of their
[40:15] backs and run with this dead baby and
[40:17] fall down among them. Didn't make any
[40:19] difference to her. She was trying to get
[40:22] there because she was desperate.
[40:26] God had spoke to her heart.
[40:29] God could give sight. She'd seen that.
[40:32] Amen. He gives sid just the day before.
[40:35] And if he could do that, he could give
[40:37] life. Amen. Oh my. She was desperate.
[40:40] Something was burning in her. Oh, sick
[40:43] people. If you'd let that burn in you
[40:45] for a few minutes and watch what
[40:47] happens. That kind of a desperation that
[40:50] God could heal this little boy the other
[40:51] night. Could heal a lady with cancer,
[40:54] heal this man and do this, Miss Florence
[40:56] Nightingale. Oh, the tens of thousands.
[40:59] He that undisputable evidence raising
[41:01] the dead and healing the sick and
[41:04] everything else. If he is God, that same
[41:07] unchangeable, unstoppable, unshakable,
[41:10] unmovable, same yesterday, today, and
[41:12] forever kind of God. Say, say, listen,
[41:15] if he is God and he could do that, he's
[41:18] God yesterday, he is God today. Get
[41:21] desperate and you'll get something done.
[41:25] Then in that desperation, she kept
[41:27] rushing. I said to brother Jack Moore, I
[41:30] said, "She don't know no know me. She's
[41:33] never seen me. She don't know who it is
[41:36] up here on the platform." That little
[41:39] Catholic woman now couldn't speak a word
[41:42] of English. So then, how does she know
[41:44] who it is? I said, "Go on down and pray
[41:47] for the baby and that'll satis satisfy
[41:50] her and she'll go on."
[41:53] said it won't cuz it was a just constant
[41:58] roar down there. She would jump up and
[42:01] everybody would be screaming. She'd run
[42:03] right over the top of their shoulders
[42:06] right down among them. She would gain a
[42:08] few feet and then they'll try to put her
[42:10] back and here she'd come right between
[42:12] their legs holding this baby upsetting
[42:15] ushers and everything else. Didn't make
[42:18] any difference. She was getting up
[42:21] there. She had to get there. It don't
[42:24] make any difference what it is. She was
[42:27] going to get there. Had to minister.
[42:29] Now, it isn't just a story like the
[42:32] Shinomite woman only listen that was 3
[42:37] 400 years ago.
[42:39] So, they can be the same thing tonight.
[42:41] When the same desperation rises, we'll
[42:44] throw love and faith up there to the
[42:47] battlefront to claim what you want
[42:50] because it's a promise of God
[42:53] that you can have it. That's exactly
[42:56] right. I turned me the minister, the
[42:58] evangelist at that place. I turned I
[43:01] felt sorry for the woman. But there's no
[43:04] desperation. See, I turned and thought,
[43:06] "Well, brother Jack, brother Jack will
[43:08] pray for her." And that that settles it.
[43:10] I turned around and I said, I was
[43:13] speaking now faith and I looked out
[43:15] there and there was a vision. I seen a
[43:18] little
[43:19] baby sitting there. A little blackfaced
[43:22] Mexican baby with no teeth. It was
[43:24] laughing at me sitting out there. I
[43:27] said, "Wait a minute. Wait a minute."
[43:29] Her
[43:30] desperation drove the Holy Spirit to
[43:33] change my subject, change my eyes and
[43:37] show me her baby sitting there. That
[43:41] sent the spirit back. I said, "Wait a
[43:44] minute. Wait a minute. Bring me the
[43:46] baby. Here she come with a little wet
[43:49] soaking blue and white blanket, a little
[43:51] dead form about that long." Yes, she
[43:54] fell with a crucifix in her hand or a
[43:58] rosary to say these Hail Marys. I told
[44:01] her, "Put it up. That's not necessary."
[44:04] And she came up close to where I was and
[44:07] she screamed and holler padre, which
[44:10] means father. I said, "Don't say that.
[44:13] Don't say that. Do you believe?" And he
[44:17] said it in Spanish to her. Did she
[44:19] believe? Yes, she believed. He asked,
[44:24] How would she believe?
[44:26] She said, "If God could give that old
[44:29] man his sight,
[44:31] he can give my baby the life." Amen.
[44:35] Desperation drove her to it. Not a thing
[44:38] on my part. I just saw the vision. I
[44:41] said, "Lord Jesus, I saw a vision of a
[44:44] little baby. It might be this one."
[44:48] About that time, he kicked his feet,
[44:51] went. I said follow her to the
[44:54] doctor. Get a written statement from the
[44:57] doctor. That baby died. And it the
[45:00] doctor wrote the statement. That baby's
[45:03] respiration heart stopped this morning
[45:06] at my office at
[45:07] 9:00. Died with double pneumonia. Oh,
[45:11] the baby is living in Mexico tonight as
[45:15] far as I know. Why? The desperation set
[45:18] in on a little mother's heart.
[45:21] crying for her child that had seen God
[45:25] heal a man's blind eyes and knowed he
[45:28] could raise the dead baby.
[45:31] desperation when thou seekest me with
[45:33] all thine heart then I'll hear you see
[45:36] the kingdom the law and the prophets
[45:38] were tell John since then the kingdom of
[45:41] heaven has been preached and man press
[45:44] into it you don't just stand around and
[45:46] say pick me up by the color Lord push me
[45:50] in you press into it you get desperate
[45:53] between life and death amen
[45:59] hallelujah
[46:00] Hallelujah.
[46:02] Blessed be his name.
[46:06] You know often time we get confused with
[46:08] the blessings of
[46:10] God. You see, God wants you to have good
[46:12] things. You know, he wants what's best
[46:15] for you. He wants you to prosper. He
[46:18] wants you to be blessed. Amen. But you
[46:20] see, he wants you to do it using his
[46:23] provided way.
[46:25] That's the thing. He wants you to use
[46:27] his proven methods. Amen. His proven
[46:30] approaches. He want you to thank him.
[46:33] This listen in all thy ways. Acknowledge
[46:36] him and he will direct your path. It
[46:41] says, "Seek ye first the kingdom of God
[46:44] and righteousness and everything else
[46:47] will be added." That's what he wants. He
[46:50] wants it all. He wants you to surrender
[46:52] to him. He want to ensure that you do it
[46:56] his way.
[46:58] Hallelujah.
[47:00] I quickly want to move to to Matthew's
[47:04] account or in in in Matthew, you don't
[47:07] have to find it in chapter 6 verse
[47:11] 24-34. It says, "No man can serve two
[47:14] masters
[47:16] for either he will hate the one and love
[47:18] the other or else he will hold to the
[47:21] one and despise the other. He cannot
[47:24] serve God and mammon." Amen.
[47:27] Therefore, I say unto you, take no
[47:29] thought for your life, what you shall
[47:31] eat, or what you shall drink, nor yet
[47:34] for your body, what you shall put on.
[47:37] It's not the life more than meat, and
[47:40] the body than reignment. Behold the
[47:42] fowls of the air, for they sow not,
[47:45] neither do they reap, nor gather into
[47:48] bands, yet our heavenly Father feedth
[47:50] them. Are ye not not much better than
[47:53] they? Amen. Which of you by taking
[47:56] thought can add one cubit to his
[47:58] stature?
[48:00] And why take he thought for arraignment?
[48:03] Consider the liies of the field, how
[48:06] they grow. They toil not, neither do
[48:08] they spin. And yet I say unto you that
[48:12] even Solomon in all his glory was not a
[48:15] raid like one of these. Amen. Wherefore,
[48:18] if God so clothe the grass of the field,
[48:22] which today is and tomorrow is cast into
[48:25] the oven, shall he not much more clothe
[48:28] you, oh ye of little faith? Therefore,
[48:32] take no thought,
[48:33] saying we, what shall we eat, or what
[48:36] shall we drink, or wherewith all shall
[48:39] we be clothed? For after all these
[48:41] things do the Gentiles seek. For your
[48:43] heavenly Father knoweth that ye have
[48:46] need of all these things, but seek ye
[48:48] first the kingdom of God, and his
[48:51] righteousness, and all these things
[48:53] shall be added unto you. Take therefore
[48:56] no thought for the tomorrow, for the
[48:58] tomorrow shall take thought for the
[48:59] things of itself. Sufficient unto the
[49:02] day is the evil thereof.
[49:07] Amen. You know, I want to revisit that
[49:12] scripture that we started with.
[49:21] Yeah. In in in the book of Luke, in Luke
[49:24] 16, like I said, I wouldn't be long with
[49:26] you tonight. In Luke
[49:29] 16, looking at verse 13, it says, "No
[49:32] servant can serve two
[49:34] masters. For either he will hate the one
[49:36] and love the other, or else he will hold
[49:39] to the one and despise the other." He
[49:41] cannot serve God and mammon.
[49:44] Here's what brother Brandham had to say
[49:46] about it in the message
[49:49] perseverance. He said, "We have our body
[49:53] and our being here is like a seed." This
[49:55] is paragraph 24.
[49:57] And the seed on the outside has a shell.
[50:01] Inside the shell, a pulp. Inside the
[50:05] pulp has a
[50:07] gum. That's the way we are. Body,
[50:10] spirit, and
[50:13] soul. Now in the body, there's five
[50:16] senses. See, taste, feel, smell, and
[50:20] hear. To the soul there's a conscience
[50:22] and so on. Five avenues to it. So five
[50:26] of the body, five
[50:29] soul. The inside is one avenue. And that
[50:33] avenue is the same place that God set
[50:35] man from Adam and Eve.
[50:38] Self-will. You will to live or you will
[50:41] to die. Either one you want
[50:44] to. It's you you're based on free moral
[50:47] agency. And whatever spirit that you let
[50:50] dominate you, you will bring forth.
[50:54] Your life will be dominated by the
[50:56] inside
[50:59] despite what you say by the inside. You
[51:02] see, that's how lie detectors could
[51:04] work. You know, because you're built a
[51:06] particular way. You wasn't created to
[51:08] lie. So you could watch the person doing
[51:12] the testing with a straight face, poker
[51:15] face, and tell them, "I did not do it."
[51:18] But the detector do so because you were
[51:22] not made to lie. Amen. So he said this
[51:26] is based on something on the
[51:28] inside and
[51:30] faith. So many people rely upon the five
[51:33] senses and he said they're fine. Nothing
[51:36] against them if they agree with the six
[51:39] sense.
[51:41] So it can't be contrary to faith. Amen.
[51:45] This soul, this spirit can only be of
[51:48] two kinds. One of them is the spirit of
[51:51] God. The other is the spirit of the
[51:53] devil. You can't serve two masters at
[51:56] the same time. You're wholly given to
[51:59] one or wholly given to the other. And if
[52:02] you got the spirit of God in you, you've
[52:05] got faith. You'll believe every word
[52:07] that God wrote. And if you haven't, you
[52:11] might be. Now the devil is not like
[52:14] sometimes we think the devil is this
[52:17] ugly character with horns and a tail. He
[52:19] coming like a horror movie and he
[52:21] frightening you. Ah no. If that was so
[52:25] he can't can't fool you. He can't catch
[52:27] you. But you know what he said? He said
[52:29] but he's deceitful.
[52:32] The devil makes you think that you're
[52:34] right. But when you disagree with the
[52:37] word, that shows that it isn't the
[52:40] spirit of God cuz the Holy Spirit wrote
[52:44] the Bible.
[52:49] And then it's got to be agreeable with
[52:51] the word and remember last Sunday just
[52:54] one little disbelief in God's word. Eve
[52:58] Satan told her the truth. No really what
[53:02] what God
[53:04] say. Satan agreed. But you know what? He
[53:08] changed one word.
[53:10] One word. He told her the truth and he
[53:14] never denied the word being
[53:17] true. But that one little part of the
[53:20] word caused all this trouble. The woman
[53:23] disbelieved it because she was hunting
[53:26] for wisdom instead of staying with the
[53:29] word.
[53:31] When God says anything, heavens and
[53:34] earth will pass, but his word shall
[53:37] never pass away. God's word must be
[53:40] fulfilled to the dot. Just to the very
[53:43] turtle and jot, it must be f fulfilled.
[53:46] There is no if and a wonder. And could
[53:50] it be? He He was trying to do something
[53:53] else and this was a mistake. No,
[53:57] if God said so that's it. There's no
[54:00] debate. There is no opinions that are
[54:03] valid. There's nothing that could be
[54:04] contrary to his word that's agreeable
[54:07] with his word. Anything contrary even by
[54:10] one word he said listen that is how the
[54:13] the devil tries to deceive you.
[54:18] That is how the devil sneaks in.
[54:21] They they always say, "Listen, if the
[54:24] devil bring co cocaine for you, you
[54:26] might run." But you know what? Oh gosh.
[54:29] Weed is for medicinal
[54:32] purposes. Try with a little CBD oil and
[54:37] get results. Then just smoke a little
[54:39] weed or cigarettes and whatever it is,
[54:42] but is a gateway to bigger things.
[54:45] That's how deceitful he is.
[54:48] just you know what it not that bad ju
[54:50] just a little bit just a little thing it
[54:53] not that serious and then before you
[54:55] know it is a big thing that's the way he
[54:58] works but you know what if you stick to
[55:00] the word you can't go wrong because his
[55:03] word never fails his word shall never
[55:07] return void it will always accomplish
[55:10] what it's set forth to accomplish
[55:16] in the same scripture As we go on to
[55:18] verse 14, it says, "And the Pharisees
[55:20] also who were covetous heard all these
[55:23] things and they derided him." Now look,
[55:26] look, look at this. The
[55:28] Pharisees were or they represented the
[55:32] wellrespected men. They were educated
[55:35] men. They were talented guys. They had a
[55:38] history of dealing with the law. Amen.
[55:40] They had a history with the ability to
[55:43] teach folks handed down from generation
[55:46] to generation. They were qualified to do
[55:49] what they were doing. And we see in
[55:52] scripture it says the Pharisees
[55:56] also who were covetous. So that's a ne a
[56:00] negative attribute. How how respectable
[56:03] persons could have dark sides? Negative
[56:07] attributes. And and just to clarify in
[56:10] case you're not
[56:11] sure, to be covetous means to be
[56:15] envious,
[56:16] to be jealous, desirous,
[56:21] inquisitive, greedy. All those terms are
[56:24] synonymous with covetous,
[56:27] you want just above and beyond, more
[56:29] than you should even have. These were
[56:32] the wellrespected guys, you know. These
[56:34] were the men of the CL. This these were
[56:36] the guys that walk with their head held
[56:37] high because they are
[56:40] Pharisees. They had rank. They had
[56:43] style. They had class. And they are the
[56:46] ones that had all these negative
[56:48] attributes. And look what they did. They
[56:49] say they derided him. And I had to
[56:51] research that
[56:53] one. And it really
[56:55] meant a level of ridicule to make you
[56:58] feel small.
[57:00] They scoffed and disparaged and and they
[57:03] mocked him and scorned him to make you
[57:05] feel less than. You imagine
[57:08] that? You imagine these highutin high
[57:14] ranking people who will say they're from
[57:17] the status quo. They decide the laws of
[57:19] the land and enforce them and they want
[57:21] to make you feel small.
[57:25] So that's what they did at the time in
[57:28] verse 15. And he said unto them, because
[57:31] he could discern the spirit easily, he
[57:34] said, "Ye are they which justify
[57:37] yourselves before men."
[57:41] But God knows your heart. No, he knoweth
[57:43] your heart. For that which is highly
[57:46] esteemed among men is abomination in the
[57:48] sight of God. Can you remember when
[57:51] Samuel was instructed to anoint one of
[57:53] the sons of Jesse?
[57:55] He was going to anoint him to be king of
[57:57] Israel, future king, king in waiting,
[58:00] right? And I will read it quickly in 1st
[58:03] Samuel chapter 16. You don't have to
[58:06] find it. It says verse 7, "But the Lord
[58:09] said unto Samuel, look not on his
[58:11] countenance or on the height of his
[58:14] stature, because I have refused him."
[58:17] Amen. For the Lord seeth not as man
[58:20] seeth.
[58:21] For man look it at the outward
[58:23] appearance but the Lord look it on your
[58:26] heart.
[58:27] You see the facade that you like to
[58:29] present on the outside in the community
[58:32] in the neighborhood in the workplace in
[58:34] school on the job that you are Mr. and
[58:37] Miss and you are this and that. You see
[58:41] that image, that position, the title,
[58:44] the rank, the picture perfect smile,
[58:46] like nothing is ever wrong doesn't seem
[58:49] to match up with the inside man all the
[58:52] time.
[58:54] And nothing you could do could change
[58:57] that because just like the lie
[58:59] detector, it detecting something is
[59:02] wrong. This is not normal.
[59:05] Some people I often say if you go to H H
[59:08] H H H H H H H H H H H H H H H H H H H H
[59:08] H H H H H H H H H H H H H H H H H
[59:08] Hollywood you'll be rich. They're great
[59:11] actors just undiscovered.
[59:14] They act through life. They act through
[59:16] the workplace. They act through school.
[59:18] They act through
[59:19] everywhere. Now that's not what God
[59:22] looking for, you know, because he's
[59:23] seeing straight through you. Straight
[59:26] through. When God looks at the heart,
[59:29] that's the important thing to him.
[59:32] You see, it's awesome to wear a nice
[59:34] suit and tie. It's awesome to wear a
[59:36] long dress and you have a handbag and
[59:39] accessories and you're looking good,
[59:41] man. Have it together.
[59:44] But when he apply his X-ray machine, you
[59:47] know, when you go in the airport, they
[59:48] tell you stand there. They don't care
[59:50] who you are, you know. They don't care
[59:51] if you're old or you're young. They tell
[59:53] you put your feet here, put your hands
[59:55] up, and you're in the X-ray machine.
[59:58] They're not looking at the outside.
[1:00:01] They want to know if you have concealed
[1:00:02] things on the inside. Amen. If you have
[1:00:05] guns and drugs and weapons and things
[1:00:07] that are forbidden or prohibited. So
[1:00:09] when God apply his extra machine to your
[1:00:12] life, he don't care you here on a Sunday
[1:00:15] early or you don't miss a Wednesday or
[1:00:17] you wearing a long dress or a nice tie
[1:00:20] or you have a brand new suit. He don't
[1:00:22] care about that. He looking on the
[1:00:24] inside to see what's the condition of
[1:00:26] that heart. what the heart saying, what
[1:00:30] is resonating, what feedback are getting
[1:00:32] from from it. Are they hungering and
[1:00:35] thirsting after righteousness? Are they
[1:00:37] seeking first the kingdom? Are they
[1:00:39] pressing to get inside? That's what
[1:00:42] you're looking at here.
[1:00:44] As a matter of fact, the elements that
[1:00:46] you might believe define you as being
[1:00:49] impressive to others,
[1:00:52] as as men and women, you're very
[1:00:55] concerned of people's opinion of you and
[1:00:58] how they see you and how they they
[1:00:59] acknowledge you and relate to you. That
[1:01:01] sounds fine. But here what he say he
[1:01:03] said, listen, an abomination in the
[1:01:06] sight of God.
[1:01:08] I leave this alone.
[1:01:11] Amen. You see, then comes the scripture
[1:01:13] where I got my title. In verse 16, it
[1:01:16] said, "The law and the prophets were
[1:01:17] until John." Since that time, the
[1:01:20] kingdom of God is preached and every man
[1:01:23] pressed press it into it.
[1:01:27] So when I look at the word every, and I
[1:01:30] didn't define it, but it tells me that
[1:01:32] there are no exceptions. Okay. Every
[1:01:36] man, woman, old, young, male, female,
[1:01:41] born free. Despite your ethnic
[1:01:44] background, listen, whatever you think,
[1:01:47] where you grew up, what your
[1:01:48] grandparents tell you, every man is
[1:01:51] every man.
[1:01:54] [Applause]
[1:01:55] So that means I need to press. Yes, my
[1:02:01] wife need to press too. Yes. How about
[1:02:04] you? You think you need to press? Yes.
[1:02:07] How about your children? They're small.
[1:02:10] They need to press too. They're staying
[1:02:13] small, you know. The influences there.
[1:02:15] You know, the influences probably
[1:02:17] greater on them cuz they will say you
[1:02:19] set in your ways already, but they could
[1:02:21] catch them. So, they need to pursue.
[1:02:25] You see, God doesn't have grandchildren.
[1:02:27] That's right. And as such, there's no
[1:02:29] entitlement.
[1:02:30] So, you are the deacon. You are the
[1:02:32] deacon wife. So you don't need to press
[1:02:35] cuz your husband is a deacon. No, it
[1:02:37] don't have that in the kingdom.
[1:02:40] If he say every, that's it to know.
[1:02:42] Every say when Moses was leaving Egypt
[1:02:45] and they say listen, put the blood on
[1:02:47] the doorpost, eat a particular way,
[1:02:49] dress a particular way, be ready to
[1:02:51] move. You say, "Well, listen, I sang a
[1:02:54] special last week, you know, and I just
[1:02:57] came from Solomon's with a new suit, so
[1:03:00] I really don't want to put on this gong
[1:03:02] because I have a special rank." No, no,
[1:03:04] no, no, no. Exceptions. It didn't matter
[1:03:08] who you are, how long you're in church,
[1:03:10] how long you believe, how long you come
[1:03:12] to the message, who testify to you, how
[1:03:14] much tapes you listen to, or how much
[1:03:15] times you read the Bible cover to cover.
[1:03:17] At the end of the day, if the word is
[1:03:20] you need to press, that's the word, no
[1:03:23] debate, no opinion, no ideas will be
[1:03:27] discussed. That is the word. Amen.
[1:03:30] Hallelujah. No entitlement.
[1:03:33] You see, nobody owes you anything. It's
[1:03:36] by his grace that he saved you. He shed
[1:03:40] his blood for you to redeem you. And he
[1:03:44] continued to love you. He didn't have
[1:03:45] to, you know, but he continue to show
[1:03:48] you mercy despite the fact that you fail
[1:03:51] him. All right?
[1:03:53] I don't have to tell you that. You know
[1:03:54] for yourself. You fall. That is your
[1:03:58] business. You aware of it. I don't have
[1:04:01] to highlight it. You had your ups and
[1:04:03] downs, but he still choose to love you
[1:04:06] and tell you, "Come on, son. Come on,
[1:04:08] daughter. You could make it. You're more
[1:04:11] than able. You're more than an overcomer
[1:04:13] tonight. You're more than able to
[1:04:15] conquer and become victorious because
[1:04:17] you're my child and I invest in you. I
[1:04:20] believe in you. I have faith and
[1:04:22] confidence that the promises are put.
[1:04:24] You're going to pick them up like like
[1:04:26] David did. Five stones. F AI T. Knowing
[1:04:30] the battle is the Lord's. Knowing that
[1:04:32] you're going to get the victory.
[1:04:39] You see,
[1:04:41] at the end of the day,
[1:04:44] God is saying, "Listen here. What? I'm
[1:04:47] going to give you an opportunity.
[1:04:50] We're going to
[1:04:51] preach. We're going to sing. We're going
[1:04:53] to pray.
[1:04:55] But you see where my kingdom is
[1:04:57] concerned. You had to press to get
[1:04:59] inside.
[1:05:01] It's the only way.
[1:05:04] It had no shortcuts.
[1:05:06] It have no way around it. You know that
[1:05:07] song say the love of Jesus is so high
[1:05:10] you can't go over it. So you can't go
[1:05:12] under it. You can't go around it. It's a
[1:05:15] requirement like that. Depressing is
[1:05:18] mandatory.
[1:05:21] It's essential that you do it in order
[1:05:23] to get the outcome he have at the end.
[1:05:26] Imagine you want to pass the test and
[1:05:28] you don't want to do the test or you
[1:05:30] don't want to study for the test. How
[1:05:33] that working? The teacher supposed to
[1:05:35] look at you and say, "Well, you know
[1:05:36] what? I feel I should give you a A. Yes.
[1:05:39] I like your smile." No, it don't work.
[1:05:41] So they want to know. It reminds me of
[1:05:44] one time I I remember a scenario in the
[1:05:47] workplace where a medicalu student he
[1:05:51] failed an exam twice. He failed the same
[1:05:53] exam twice and he came asking for help
[1:05:57] to pass it. But the kind of help he
[1:05:59] wanted is he wants talk to the lecturer
[1:06:03] for
[1:06:04] me. Here the concern I have with that.
[1:06:08] We could talk to the lecture fair and
[1:06:09] they could give you a A and you could
[1:06:10] pass it. But what happening to the
[1:06:12] patients?
[1:06:16] Imagine a pilot doing the same thing.
[1:06:18] You don't want to do all the
[1:06:20] classes. Talk to the aviation
[1:06:23] association for me know give a pilot
[1:06:25] license. Let me go. You can't allow
[1:06:29] that. You can't facilitate that. It
[1:06:31] could be your friend. It could be a
[1:06:33] child. No exceptions. And if in in
[1:06:37] regular life we will operate that
[1:06:40] operate like that because of the risk
[1:06:42] factors involved. What about God? You
[1:06:45] think God want reckless sons and
[1:06:46] daughters out here? No. He want to test
[1:06:49] you. He want to try you. He want to make
[1:06:52] sure you're qualified and you're
[1:06:53] authorized to perform the transactions
[1:06:56] he want you perform. Can you imagine?
[1:07:00] God said, "Listen, I giving you the
[1:07:02] checkbook. I given you the ability to
[1:07:05] write the check for anything you want.
[1:07:08] But you don't have money management.
[1:07:10] What going to happen? You'll be like the
[1:07:12] prodigal son. You throwing parties.
[1:07:15] You're not investing. You not seeing
[1:07:17] about your father's business. No, you
[1:07:19] not even sure what to do. You writing
[1:07:21] checks because somebody say hello, you
[1:07:23] just write them a check. Somebody walk
[1:07:25] past in the road, you write them a
[1:07:27] check. No, God. God God operates so he
[1:07:30] operate with order. He operate with
[1:07:34] requirements. He said listen, he going
[1:07:36] to put tutors and governors to monitor
[1:07:38] you. It's not instant, you know. It's
[1:07:41] not a microwave kind of God we serve.
[1:07:42] You know, he want to pull some through
[1:07:45] through the fire, through the water.
[1:07:47] Listen, he want to give you trials on
[1:07:49] the left and the right. Some might go
[1:07:52] through sickness. Some might go through
[1:07:54] financial hardship. But you know what?
[1:07:57] All coming out. Because he say not one
[1:08:00] will be left behind. He not giving you
[1:08:03] up. He determined that he going to get a
[1:08:06] return on his investment. He determined
[1:08:09] that you're going to make it. And to
[1:08:12] make it, you have to press
[1:08:18] the musicians could get get ready as we
[1:08:20] we seek to to wind down a little bit.
[1:08:23] You know, I pray that God spoke to your
[1:08:25] heart and cause you to reconsider your
[1:08:28] ways. Examine your heart condition.
[1:08:32] You see the scripture is very clear on
[1:08:34] what is required. But you know what?
[1:08:37] Sometimes you know what is required. But
[1:08:40] you need sometimes circumstance to
[1:08:42] change. You to think Jonah know God
[1:08:44] called him to do a particular job. Yes.
[1:08:47] But sometimes you need the circumstance
[1:08:49] to shake you up a little bit to jolt you
[1:08:52] to to to shove you into into position.
[1:08:55] Amen. And when that happens you come out
[1:08:58] in a days. But you called to do this all
[1:09:01] the time. Listen, this battle we talk
[1:09:05] about, you called to be victorious. Now
[1:09:08] you called to overcome it. You you are
[1:09:11] called to achieve. You are called to do.
[1:09:14] You are called to perform. He said he
[1:09:16] wouldn't give you more than you could
[1:09:18] bear. So when he say press, he know you
[1:09:20] could press. He want you press tonight.
[1:09:23] He want you press tomorrow because the
[1:09:26] hour is late. We don't have time.
[1:09:28] Hallelujah. We don't have time to play
[1:09:30] around. He wants you to press.
[1:09:34] You see, in a message, modern events are
[1:09:36] made clear by prophecy. All right.
[1:09:39] Paragraph 299. He said, "This this may
[1:09:41] be our last
[1:09:43] meeting, you may never, you know, if I
[1:09:45] were back a year from today," he said,
[1:09:47] "If I live, there'd be many here now
[1:09:52] won't be here then. and I'll have to
[1:09:54] meet you at the judgment bar and answer
[1:09:56] for everything that I said tonight
[1:09:59] before God. While you're in your right
[1:10:01] mind,
[1:10:03] would you now do this much to God? If
[1:10:06] you know that, just look around, look at
[1:10:09] yourself in the looking glass of God,
[1:10:12] the
[1:10:13] Bible, no matter who you are and say, "I
[1:10:17] know I'm way short from being a daughter
[1:10:20] of God. Look the way I do.
[1:10:23] I'm way short from being a son of God.
[1:10:25] Look the way I do. But God, I don't want
[1:10:28] to be.
[1:10:31] I want to strive for that place.
[1:10:34] I want you to raise your hand to God
[1:10:36] just wherever you are across the
[1:10:38] building.
[1:10:40] Yes. I want to be a son of God. I want
[1:10:44] to be a daughter of God. I want to
[1:10:47] fulfill everything that my Lord has
[1:10:49] commanded.
[1:10:51] Now you God bless you.
[1:10:54] I guess 90% of the audience let's play
[1:10:57] ancient words.
[1:11:00] Now look here my friend. What if you
[1:11:04] would have lived in the days when you
[1:11:06] heard John
[1:11:08] preach? What if you would have lived in
[1:11:10] the days when Jesus was
[1:11:12] here? Whose side would you have took if
[1:11:16] you'd lived in Jesus?
[1:11:18] [Music]
[1:11:20] Remember, if you'd live back there, it
[1:11:23] would be just like it is now. The same
[1:11:26] Jesus is making himself known by his
[1:11:28] word. See, it might be
[1:11:31] unpopular. But let me tell you, I'm not
[1:11:34] trying to tell you to leave church or
[1:11:38] want you to go to
[1:11:39] church. Don't forget to assemble
[1:11:42] yourselves together. But what I'm trying
[1:11:45] to tell you
[1:11:48] is to press into the kingdom of God.
[1:11:55] If you'll just bow your heads right
[1:11:56] where you
[1:12:01] are. Oh heavenly
[1:12:04] father Lord in these few moments Lord
[1:12:07] sharing around your word Lord Lord just
[1:12:10] a reminder of the time and the hour in
[1:12:13] which we live. just a reminder in why we
[1:12:16] are called and what we are called to do
[1:12:18] tonight, Lord. Lord, I pray that the
[1:12:22] message struck home, Lord. Lord, I pray
[1:12:25] that we could apply it to our lives.
[1:12:27] That we could look in the mirror and see
[1:12:31] if we are found wanting tonight, Lord,
[1:12:33] and press into your
[1:12:35] kingdom as you require of us, Lord.
[1:12:39] Lord, for us to grab a hold of faith
[1:12:41] tonight, to know that you're the same
[1:12:43] yesterday, today, and forever. That the
[1:12:46] same God that healed the blind eye and
[1:12:49] raised the dead is alive
[1:12:52] tonight. Is alive to deliver tonight. Is
[1:12:56] alive to restore tonight. Is alive to
[1:12:59] revive
[1:13:00] tonight. Lord, you you didn't gather us
[1:13:03] together in vain, Lord. We're not
[1:13:05] speaking idle words or fables, Lord.
[1:13:08] Lord, but we speaking words of life. We
[1:13:11] speaking words of love. We speaking
[1:13:13] words of
[1:13:14] truth. Words that you have written by
[1:13:16] your Holy Spirit, Lord. Lord, we pray
[1:13:19] tonight even as we wind down the service
[1:13:22] that you will be with us, Lord. Lord,
[1:13:24] that you would guide us and protect us,
[1:13:26] Lord. Lord, that you will show us,
[1:13:29] direct us, lead us, Lord. In Jesus name
[1:13:33] we pray. Amen. May we stand tonight.
[1:13:38] Let's just sing that word. Ancient
[1:13:41] words. Sing that
[1:13:44] [Applause]
[1:13:46] song. Oh, ancient
[1:13:51] words ever
[1:13:54] true. Changing
