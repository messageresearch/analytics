[13:55] tonight and Jason we ask it amen God
[13:58] bless you and welcome it's a privilege
[14:00] to be here and I will excited about
[14:03] coming here tonight to share Allah wood
[14:06] with you tonight
[14:08] so you have your Bibles they're likely
[14:10] to turn to first king chapter 3.
[14:13] we want to read verse 5 to 14 First
[14:17] Kings chapter 3.
[14:20] and in verse 3 it had said and Solomon
[14:24] loved the law walking in the statute of
[14:27] David his father
[14:29] so this scripture
[14:31] David has passed on has gone on to be
[14:34] with the Lord
[14:36] that's King
[14:38] and Solomon I think he's a young man but
[14:41] with 2025 in his 20s
[14:44] early 20s and he is in this position
[14:48] following a mighty man King David
[14:52] we want to read from verse 5. in gibeon
[14:56] the Lord appeared to Solomon in a dream
[15:02] by night
[15:04] and God said
[15:05] ask what I shall give thee that's the
[15:10] title of what I want to share with you
[15:12] tonight ask what I shall give thee
[15:15] and let's continue through six and
[15:17] Solomon said Thou Art unto thy Susan
[15:20] David my father great Mercy
[15:23] according as he walked before the
[15:25] untruth and in righteousness and in
[15:28] uprightness of heart with thee doors
[15:30] kept for him discreet kindness God has
[15:34] given him a son to sit on his throne as
[15:36] it is this day and no oh Lord my God
[15:40] thou has made thy Stephen King
[15:43] instead of David my father and I am but
[15:47] a little child I know not how to go out
[15:52] or come in
[15:54] and thy servant is in the midst of thy
[15:56] people which thou has chosen the great
[15:58] people that cannot be numbered nor
[16:01] counted for multitude
[16:03] give therefore thy servant
[16:07] an understanding heart
[16:09] to judge that people
[16:11] that I may design between good and bad
[16:14] for who is able to judge this thy so
[16:18] greater people
[16:19] and the speech will stand please the
[16:22] Lord but Solomon and ask this thing
[16:27] and God said unto him
[16:29] because that was asked this thing and
[16:34] has not asked for thyself long life
[16:37] Lee has asked riches for thyself Noah
[16:41] asks the life of thy enemies but thou
[16:44] has asked for thyself understanding
[16:47] to discern judgment
[16:50] behold
[16:52] I have done
[16:53] according to thy words
[16:56] so this is like a pronouncement by God
[16:58] behold I have done according to thy
[17:03] words no
[17:05] I have given thee a wise and an
[17:09] understanding heart
[17:11] so that there was none like day before
[17:13] thee neither after thee shall any arise
[17:17] like unto thee
[17:18] and I have also given thee that which
[17:21] though has not asked both riches and
[17:25] honor so that there shall not be any
[17:27] among the Kings like under the in all
[17:29] thy days
[17:31] and if though will walk in my ways to
[17:35] keep my statute and my Commandments as
[17:38] thy father David did work then I will
[17:40] link me the idea may God bless his word
[17:44] again thank you for being here tonight
[17:47] and
[17:49] inside of this scripture here
[17:51] you have a lot of lessons
[17:54] Earth stuck inside of here and we just
[17:57] want to reflect on the fact that God
[18:00] could ask Solomon ask what I shall give
[18:04] him
[18:05] I'm in meditation I'm thinking about
[18:07] this tonight and bringing it to you
[18:11] I
[18:12] want to see what if God asks the same
[18:17] question to you
[18:19] do
[18:21] if God come down to you tonight right in
[18:23] your home right where you are and say
[18:25] ask what I shall give thee
[18:28] note
[18:29] David said no I mean Solomon no Lord my
[18:34] God always made thy Stephen King instead
[18:36] of leaving my father and I am a little
[18:39] child I know not how to go out and come
[18:41] in and this is a reflection of
[18:44] his humility
[18:46] how he
[18:48] he humbled himself
[18:50] how he is willing to say I don't know
[18:53] how to deal with this
[18:55] can you do that I want to read that to
[18:57] be Amplified First Kings 3 7 it says no
[18:59] Lord my God you have made your servant
[19:02] King instead of David my father but I am
[19:05] but a lad
[19:07] in wisdom and experience
[19:10] I know not how to go out to begin
[19:13] or come in to finish
[19:16] and you could see that David
[19:22] Solomon being David's son he would have
[19:25] been schooled properly he would have the
[19:27] best of Education he would have had the
[19:30] best of skill training fighting training
[19:32] whatever was the best because his father
[19:34] was King and he would have been schooled
[19:37] uh along the line of coming up into that
[19:41] room and yet
[19:43] when confronted with this great
[19:45] responsibility of sitting on the throne
[19:48] he finds himself saying
[19:52] um about a lot I don't have
[19:55] the wisdom and experience you know
[19:57] there's some people who don't like to
[19:58] say they don't know
[20:00] who don't like to admit they don't know
[20:03] they pretend they know they Bluff the
[20:05] way as if they know and they don't know
[20:07] but Solomon wasn't mixing matters here
[20:10] he said you don't know how to go I don't
[20:11] want to come in I need you
[20:13] second Corinthians 3 5 says not that we
[20:15] are sufficient of ourselves to think
[20:18] anything as of ourselves but our
[20:21] sufficiency is of God these are good
[20:23] scripture to meditate on and think over
[20:25] and they amplify the second Corinthians
[20:28] 3 5 says not that we are fit or
[20:31] qualified or sufficient inability of
[20:34] ourselves to form personal judgments or
[20:37] the claim or anything that's coming from
[20:39] us but our power and our ability and
[20:42] sufficiency are from God
[20:45] and this is the main route here so in
[20:48] other words Paul himself was expressing
[20:51] not relying on Whose ability you know
[20:54] some people like to do it and say I did
[20:55] it and I did it my way and I did it and
[20:57] there's a night and you know not going
[21:00] in like that
[21:01] Paul was expressing that his sufficiency
[21:04] comes from God or power on on our
[21:07] ability comes from God we have nothing
[21:09] to boost about in ourselves
[21:11] no challenge tonight
[21:14] God
[21:15] wants to give
[21:18] he is waiting for you to ask
[21:21] and I hope tonight
[21:23] that a vision is caught of the power of
[21:27] asking
[21:28] the power of Prayer
[21:31] the power of praying the right thing
[21:34] not praying for my selfishness or from
[21:37] just personal Vendetta because if you
[21:40] note that God told him you didn't ask
[21:43] for a long life you didn't ask
[21:45] for your the life of your enemies there
[21:47] are some people who want to get
[21:48] Vengeance they they don't want the
[21:50] conventions unto God they want to
[21:51] Revenge themselves
[21:53] and
[21:55] so think about it tonight
[21:57] is this as if
[21:59] God can't give until you ask
[22:02] the heavenly father knows what you have
[22:04] need of but yet you have to ask him it
[22:06] shall be given you seek and if you are
[22:09] fine you're knock on the door shall be
[22:11] open open
[22:12] so Solomon did not ask for riches
[22:15] honor
[22:17] recognition his name on a building
[22:20] and God says after Solomon Express his
[22:24] desire
[22:26] I he said I've done according to thy
[22:29] words
[22:30] so so could you imagine
[22:33] if God is to take your words tonight
[22:36] tonight what you will pray
[22:39] what you would ask
[22:40] and he could come down and say I have
[22:42] done
[22:44] according to thy words
[22:46] First Kings Four
[22:49] 29-31 read thus
[22:51] and God
[22:54] give Solomon wisdom
[22:56] an understanding exceeding much
[23:00] and loudness loudness of heart even as
[23:04] the sun that is on the seashore
[23:06] and Solomon wisdom excelled the wisdom
[23:10] of all the children of the East Country
[23:12] and all the wisdom of Egypt
[23:14] for he was wiser on all men than he
[23:17] found the Israelite
[23:19] and human and charcoal and Dada the sons
[23:23] of my heart and his theme
[23:25] was in all nations roundabout
[23:31] what this reflects is that Solomon had a
[23:34] right heart
[23:36] and
[23:39] you know
[23:41] many times people
[23:43] blame others
[23:45] they blame others for their status they
[23:47] blame others for the condition they're
[23:50] in they blame everything else and they
[23:53] can't seem to deal with themselves
[23:55] and if you note
[23:57] Solomon was trying to deal with what's
[24:01] on the inside
[24:02] it was an internal thing because he
[24:06] asked God
[24:08] let me see you again
[24:10] he says give dear for
[24:13] disabled
[24:15] an understanding heart
[24:18] to judge thy people
[24:20] no there are three main things knowledge
[24:25] understanding
[24:27] and wisdom
[24:28] if we call knowledge as information or
[24:31] facts
[24:32] then understanding will be comprehension
[24:36] or how do you understand it like you
[24:38] know you give a child a story to read
[24:41] and then they ask questions because what
[24:44] they want to know is not just that your
[24:46] child could read but does the child
[24:48] understand what
[24:50] he or she has read
[24:52] so then now on that third step which is
[24:55] wisdom is how to use knowledge or how to
[24:58] apply what you understand the facts that
[25:02] you know so therefore you need the
[25:05] knowledge you need the understanding and
[25:07] you need wisdom the wisdom went to
[25:11] clarify and bring into effect what you
[25:14] know and what you understand truly
[25:16] understand
[25:17] so let's continue
[25:18] so this speech and this prayer that
[25:21] Solomon prayed or spoke it please God
[25:25] so what what he said here now he said no
[25:30] and now oh Lord my God
[25:35] and Lord my God you have made your
[25:37] servant your king and and but I am
[25:40] Allard in wisdom and experience I know
[25:43] sometimes young people today they see
[25:45] them at all they feel they are done
[25:47] because they have two little piece of
[25:48] things inside their head and they feel
[25:50] that they carry them through but it's
[25:52] not that cannot what you know
[25:54] intellectually matter stuff that kind of
[25:57] take it through yeah something called
[25:58] wisdom and experience and that's what we
[26:01] want to get from God
[26:02] so God gave Solomon
[26:06] exceeding
[26:08] wisdom and equality no When Jesus and we
[26:14] Deputy some time ago when they asked him
[26:17] how to pray because they saw Jesus
[26:19] praying there's a reason and Jesus was a
[26:22] prayerful person he was in the spirit of
[26:24] prayer and Jesus in Matthew 6 said when
[26:26] you pray use them to be in repetitions
[26:29] as a human do for the things that they
[26:31] shall be heard for their much speaker
[26:33] be not eat therefore like unto them for
[26:38] here we go for your father note what
[26:40] things you are in need of before asking
[26:42] after this manner therefore praying so
[26:47] in other words he sort of give a
[26:49] template
[26:50] that's something that you use over and
[26:51] over not repetitively but the approach
[26:54] or Father which is in heaven there's
[26:56] nothing about you and your problems and
[26:58] your rent and you can't pay this on your
[27:00] school fees and your car shut down
[27:01] there's nothing to do with that
[27:03] or Father which art in heaven Hallowed
[27:06] be thy name
[27:10] in heaven and then verse 11 he said give
[27:15] us this day our daily bread
[27:17] no that tells me that God expects us to
[27:20] pray dearly
[27:22] every day
[27:23] because you eat every day your daily
[27:25] bread then forgive us all debts as we
[27:28] forgive our debtors
[27:29] this is Jesus praying Islam not not
[27:32] um not may we have also and grudges and
[27:35] academic get back at them with your
[27:38] mouth and you talk no I'm leaders not
[27:40] competition I find this is very humbling
[27:43] this is not uh I am the only Bridal I
[27:47] will stick your word and you know that
[27:49] kind of drama thing that kind of
[27:50] arrogant sometimes it comes across like
[27:52] lead us not into temptation
[27:54] but Deliver Us from evil
[27:58] for dying is the kingdom and the power
[28:00] and the glory forever and ever for if
[28:02] and you put like a clause here for if we
[28:05] forgive men they are trespasses
[28:07] trespasses your heavenly father will
[28:09] also forgive you but if you
[28:12] forgive not mend the trespasses neither
[28:15] will your father forgive your presence
[28:18] Luke 11 some scriptures tonight
[28:21] Luke 11 9 to 13 says and I said unto you
[28:24] asked shall be giving you seek you shall
[28:26] find knock it shall be open unto you but
[28:29] everyone that I could receive it he that
[28:31] she could find it to him that knock it
[28:33] shall be open and if a son shall ask
[28:36] better if any of you as the father or
[28:38] will he give him a stone question and if
[28:40] he asks a fish will eat a fish give him
[28:42] a serpent or if he asks for an egg will
[28:45] he offer him a scorpion
[28:47] Jesus making a cross-reference and then
[28:49] if he then being evil know how to give
[28:52] good gifts unto your children how much
[28:54] more style your heavenly father give the
[28:58] Holy Spirit to them that ask him
[29:01] give the Holy Spirit ask what I shall
[29:04] give thee
[29:06] he put it right here
[29:08] where you have to ask for the Holy
[29:10] Spirit
[29:11] how much more prior Heavenly Father give
[29:15] the Holy Spirit to them not ask him
[29:18] so
[29:19] to get the knowledge to get the wisdom
[29:21] you have to pass through understanding
[29:23] to get the understanding you have to get
[29:25] the knowledge you can't understand what
[29:28] you don't know you have to get the
[29:29] knowledge and then you get the
[29:31] comprehension of the knowledge and that
[29:32] could that could give you the the wisdom
[29:35] to make the right decisions sometimes
[29:37] you have a lot of facts spoken away you
[29:40] have decisions to make what do you do
[29:42] but with the understanding of the facts
[29:45] or the information that come your way it
[29:47] puts you in a position to get wisdom and
[29:51] be wise to make healthy and correct
[29:54] decisions knowledge is fixed
[29:57] and you have to meet the mind of God
[30:00] with the knowledge of God
[30:02] so this intelligence that the bride's
[30:04] supposed to connect with there's no
[30:06] moving faculty past the eyes next the
[30:08] intelligence we
[30:10] as we believe part of this bright body
[30:13] that has to come in contact with chords
[30:16] mine or God's wisdom or God's love or
[30:20] God's intelligence we could only meet
[30:23] that with the knowledge of God you can't
[30:25] know nothing about God and you're gonna
[30:26] meet the things of God it's not going to
[30:29] work that way that is why God gave us
[30:31] this piece of time this piece of half an
[30:34] hour if he could put it that way to get
[30:37] Seated on with this word let's continue
[30:40] Proverbs 3 almost done
[30:43] 315 says happy is the man
[30:46] that find that wisdom
[30:49] and the man that gets it understanding
[30:52] for the merchandise if it is better than
[30:55] the merchandise of silver
[31:00] she is more precious than rubies and all
[31:03] things Dawkins desire are not to be
[31:06] comparable
[31:08] James 1 5-7 if any of you lack wisdom
[31:12] let him ask God
[31:14] that give it to all men liberally and
[31:16] are braided not and it shall be given
[31:20] but let him ask and feed not delivering
[31:22] for you that River like the spirit of
[31:23] the sea driven with the wind and dust
[31:26] let not that man think that he shall
[31:28] receive
[31:29] anything of the Lord James 3
[31:33] 13 to 18 and I'm going to put this up
[31:35] afterwards I'm going to Senator that you
[31:36] could just go through the scriptures
[31:37] yourself and make it on these things
[31:41] James 3 says who is a wise man
[31:43] an endured with knowledge among you
[31:46] let them show out of good conversation
[31:49] his works with meekness
[31:52] of wisdom
[31:55] Amplified of that same scripture who is
[31:57] the among you who is wise and
[31:59] intelligent then let him by his Noble
[32:03] living show forth his good works with
[32:06] unobtrusive humility which is the proper
[32:10] attribute of true wisdom oh yeah so
[32:14] wisdom through wisdom now you have
[32:17] another time we talk about the truth we
[32:18] understand it positive the true wisdom
[32:21] is connected with humility what's the
[32:23] sign of the Holy Ghost first sign the
[32:25] prophecy of this Humanity verse 14 but
[32:28] if you have better envying and strife in
[32:30] your heart Glory not alignment against
[32:32] the truth this wisdom descended not from
[32:35] above but it's Earthly
[32:37] sensual devilish
[32:40] for where infinite Strife is there is
[32:43] confusion and every evil work but the
[32:46] wisdom that is from above is first pure
[32:49] then peaceful gentle and easy to be
[32:52] untreated full of mercy and good fruits
[32:55] without partiality but of hypocrisy and
[32:58] the fruit of righteousness is sown in
[33:01] peace of them that make peace
[33:05] and and I'm almost yeah honestly enough
[33:07] right
[33:09] okay
[33:10] Proverbs 9 purpose 4 out of 49 he taught
[33:14] me also and said unto me
[33:16] he wasn't man with his wisdom he taught
[33:20] me also I said unto me and let thine
[33:22] heart retain my words
[33:24] keep my Commandments and live
[33:26] get wisdom get understanding don't leave
[33:29] it on the table get it get wisdom
[33:33] can't understand
[33:34] forget that note these are decline from
[33:37] the words of my mouth forsake I'm not
[33:39] and she shall preserve thee love her and
[33:42] she shall keep thee wisdom is the
[33:45] principle thing wisdom is the principle
[33:49] thing therefore get wisdom and get all
[33:53] that getting get understanding so we
[33:56] have to come up with those three things
[33:58] getting wisdom principally to its step
[34:02] getting understanding Second Step
[34:04] getting the knowledge and knowledge of
[34:06] God
[34:07] ExAlta she shall promote thee she shall
[34:10] bring it to honor when thou Dost impress
[34:12] her she shall give to thine head an
[34:14] ornament of Grace a Crown of Glory shall
[34:18] she live unto Dee
[34:19] so I want to say tonight Salman I'm a
[34:22] right heart as a Young Man what kind of
[34:24] heart do you have tonight
[34:26] yeah some people like to hear what the
[34:27] rules but not to keep the rules to break
[34:29] the rules to get around the rules when
[34:31] you see somebody saying this one doing
[34:32] this they weren't doing their stuff they
[34:34] don't want to know what God's really is
[34:36] that's what Israel did this one of a
[34:37] king that one other thing we want a king
[34:40] and God was the king I want to close
[34:43] with this physical from the profit for
[34:44] the problem speaking about Joe remember
[34:47] job had no Bible to reason his day no he
[34:50] only went by inspiration he was a
[34:52] prophet to whom the word of the Lord
[34:54] comes to he had only to be inspired
[34:56] because you know this position that he
[34:59] was gross prophet and the only thing
[35:00] that had to happen was for the
[35:02] inspiration to strike him then he knowed
[35:05] what he said would happen because it was
[35:07] by inspiration here we go
[35:11] and that's what the church
[35:14] if it is in order such an order it's got
[35:17] the mechanics ready it only needs them
[35:19] Dynamics
[35:21] if this is what the prophet said you
[35:22] know tonight
[35:24] if we will get the mechanics ready
[35:28] get our hearts right
[35:31] and then he says the things that we can
[35:35] do
[35:36] follow every word
[35:38] following in baptism
[35:40] for them in every order he told us to do
[35:43] get everything your mechanic ready and
[35:47] stand there 10 we're ready for Dynamics
[35:49] to be let off and only God can do that
[35:52] and that is to let to drop into your
[35:55] heart that feet that say I love you so
[35:57] friends inclusion tonight
[36:00] the thing about it
[36:03] a lot of people are religious
[36:05] they're not spiritual they're really
[36:06] religious they like go to church they
[36:09] like the atmosphere you know it's
[36:11] religion
[36:12] is not an internal where you want this
[36:18] faithful experience that
[36:21] experimental experience in the heart
[36:25] because we are I would call it in a
[36:28] modern age a knowledgeable age where we
[36:31] could read and write no really matter
[36:33] YouTube you can learn anything
[36:35] technology is there
[36:38] and
[36:39] we could get away from the hard part of
[36:42] things
[36:43] and you could see that Solomon could
[36:46] have asked for what these politicians
[36:49] would ask for today they want to match
[36:51] our fancy cars and plane and as soon as
[36:54] they get a position they want this they
[36:55] want that things things just things
[36:58] Solomon didn't ask for things he asked
[37:01] for understanding tougher understanding
[37:03] what was God could you please work with
[37:05] me give me what it would take to
[37:08] deserved give me what it takes to
[37:11] understand right from wrong
[37:14] not to go by my feelings you know one
[37:17] and you could buy your feeling and
[37:18] you're feeling hate me feeling different
[37:20] it's just feeling you're not asking this
[37:22] is God's will this is God's plan this is
[37:25] God order or not because that training
[37:28] Garden was not feeling the day of field
[37:30] the day of field noisy a day either of
[37:32] that day you die it was a choice it was
[37:34] a decision to leave it alone because God
[37:36] said so and we have things to come back
[37:39] to that spot where we could acknowledge
[37:41] and say you know what God said it that's
[37:43] it that's it I believe it and I live on
[37:45] it just like that
[37:46] so I want to encourage you tonight
[37:49] because God could come down and says and
[37:52] say asks what I shall give thee what do
[37:55] you want
[37:57] what do you really want
[37:59] a new husband a new wife
[38:01] what kind of children it was a new house
[38:03] a new car another car
[38:06] Theresa P more money what do you want
[38:09] because it will come down to what you
[38:11] have in your heart
[38:14] is what gonna come out in your prayer
[38:17] what you're going to pray
[38:19] may you be blessed tonight
[38:21] Express to God the right thing
[38:24] that God could say I am pleased
[38:27] because you have prayed the writing note
[38:32] because Solomon did not ask for riches
[38:36] an honor
[38:37] and humor whatever God said listen you
[38:41] didn't ask relations but I'm going to
[38:43] give it to you because of what you asked
[38:46] for
[38:49] God's people
[38:51] what kind of heart that you
[38:54] where is your burden for the things of
[38:58] God and the people of God
[39:00] it's a burden you know
[39:02] it's a bulletin it's a bulletin
[39:05] not many people have that
[39:07] and when you're connected the burden of
[39:10] God something try to prayer because
[39:13] prayer becomes your key
[39:15] and and go to Osama let him come let me
[39:19] just find this back quickly
[39:21] no spelling
[39:22] what God told Salman because of your
[39:24] words
[39:26] a message
[39:32] and I said God wants to give
[39:35] he's waiting for you to ask
[39:37] if you pray in love my family the family
[39:39] family what kind of Praise is that is
[39:41] that selfish you is he seem selfish
[39:44] heart the selfish Spirit you're operate
[39:46] from a level of selfishness and it
[39:48] reflects in your prayer
[39:51] what did God tell him behold I have done
[39:55] according to thy words I have given thee
[39:58] a wise
[39:59] understanding what if you could ask for
[40:02] to give a reboot tonight you're like a
[40:04] computer virus the computer what kind of
[40:06] stuff and sometimes you need a reboot
[40:07] and things that sort yourself out and I
[40:10] say Lord you know what flip me over
[40:11] tonight
[40:12] and give me a fresh breed of fresh
[40:15] intake that I wouldn't really just pray
[40:17] I prayed before but I've prayed
[40:19] sincerely from my heart that is bald
[40:21] heads tonight
[40:22] heavenly father I was thrilled when I
[40:25] saw this and I
[40:27] couldn't wait to share this with your
[40:29] people tonight and I trust that they
[40:31] would see it that you could come to a
[40:33] man a young man and said ask what I
[40:35] shall give thee
[40:37] and that young man broke the trend he
[40:39] didn't ask for sneakers for shoes for a
[40:42] new flashy calf a new flashy distance
[40:44] that an airplane and more money and
[40:48] credit cards and lie here and go there
[40:51] and do this and show off and parade his
[40:53] beef he didn't answer that he asks for
[40:57] understanding heart
[40:59] what a prayer what a request I mean you
[41:05] father was so pleased that you said I've
[41:08] given it to you that is what you asked
[41:10] for knowing that I'm gonna give you what
[41:11] you didn't ask for
[41:13] God bless these people tonight may they
[41:16] receive the word as God may they receive
[41:18] this tonight and may they be blessed by
[41:21] receiving it I may it be blessed in
[41:23] prayer hear an answer to my prayer and
[41:25] she said my basket

[41:30] was something to you I mean that you
[41:32] would be blessed at Academy
