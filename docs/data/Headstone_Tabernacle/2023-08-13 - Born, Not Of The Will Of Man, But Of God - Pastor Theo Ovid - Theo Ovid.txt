resurrection fit is all about that we see Jesus after his race from the Dead Alive Among Us healing delivering redeeming sealing baptizing oh God and saving granted father come this morning Lord and confirm your word which signs one of the Miracles we ask in Jesus name God bless you and thanks so much for coming out we like to to go into our Bibles to three portion of scripture we want to reach in John 1 a couple of visits from there First Peter 1 14-25 acts 1 8. Us in John we read 1 1 and then we go to 11 to 13. praise God okay it's in John 1 1 in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and we go down to 11. he came onto his own his own receive him not but as many as received him to them give you power to become the sons of God even to them that believe in his name which were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but of God First Peter chapter 1 read from verse 14. it reads as obedient children not fashion in ourselves according to the former lust in your ignorance but as he which I call you is Holy be holy in all manner of conversation and that would conversation is means manner of life 16 because it is written be holy for I am Holy and if he call on the father who without respect of persons judge it according to Every Man's work in fear for as much as you know that you were not redeemed the corruptable things are Sylvan gold from vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers but with the precious blood of Christ as of a lamb without blemish and without spot who verily was ordained before the foundation of the world but was manifesting these last times for you who by him do believe in God that risen from the dead and give him glory that your Faith and Hope might be in God of purifying your souls in obeying the truth to the spirit under on fake love of the Brethren see that you love one another with a pure heart fervently being born again not of corruptable seed but of Incorruptible by the word of God which uplivet and abideth forever for All Flesh is as grass and all the glory of man as the flower of the grass the grass withered the flower thereof followed away but the word of the Lord didn't do it forever and this is the word which by the gospel is preached unto you all our scripture acts 1 8 1 8 says that he shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost has come upon you and you shall be Witnesses unto means both in Jerusalem in all Judea and Samaria are the uttermost part of the earth let us pray father we thank you for your word Lord and I pray that your fire presence and power will come into your word and work Lord and Minister and meet every need here this morning will hear an online granted father in Jesus amen you may be seated praise God blessed be the name of the Lord Hallelujah I have two context scriptures that I would like to read there's something John 3 it says there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus a ruler of the Jews the same came to Jesus by night said unto him Rabbi we know the daughter the teacher come from God for no man can do these Miracles except God be with him and Jesus answers said unto him verily violation to you except the man be born again you cannot see the kingdom of God and the kadema said unto him how can a man be born when he's old can he enter the second time in his mother's womb and be born and Jesus answered verily verily unto you except a man be born of water and of the spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of God that which is born of the flesh is flesh that which is born of the spirit is Spirit Marvel not what I see unto the day you must be born again the wind blew it were listed and though here is the song thereof but can't not tell when's it coming and when it go it so is everyone that is born of the spirit second context scriptures from first John 5 First 48 for whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world and this is the victory that overcometh the world even over fate who is he that overcoming the world but he that believeth that Jesus is the son of God this is he here we go that came by water and blood even Jesus Christ not by water only but by water and blood it is the spirit that beareth witness because the spirit is truth for there are three that bear record in heaven the Father the word and the Holy Ghost these three are one and they are treated their witness in Earth the spirit the water and the blood these three agree in one may God bless his word it's good to be here this morning and the scripted we read from first Peter uh and the Amplified it says live as children of obedience to God do not conform yourselves to the evil desires that govern you in your former ignorance when you did not know the requirement of the Gospel but as the one who has called you as holy you yourself also be holy in all conduct and manner of living for it is written yeah shall be holy for I am Holy and if you call him as your father who judges each one impartially a according to what he does then you should conduct yourself with true reverence throughout the time of your temporary resident on Earth with a long or short oh blessed be the name of the Lord conduct yourselves with true reverence throughout the time of your temporary residence on Earth went along or short oh blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah praise God thank you Lord Jesus and then I went on to says uh you have been regenerated born again not from Mortal origin seed sperm but from one that is Immortal by the ever living and Lasting word of God born again by the Everlasting word of God isn't that something this morning all right let's go praise be to Jesus okay I decided to bring two questions answers to you this morning as a little appetizer bonus all right question how can a Christian get deeper in the love of God question answer read a word and pray read the word of God and pray simple answer you get that one how can a Christian get deeper in the love of God read the word and pray second question do your children have to have an experience to have the Holy Spirit if they see the end time message do they have the Holy Spirit these are classic questions a classic question I love it so you're saying no if they see the message do they have the Holy Spirit see yeah good Baptist when you believe you have it you see it everyone must have an experience your children kind of go in on no other way but the same way you do they have got to be born again there is no grandchildren in the kingdom of God they are all children they must have it must have an experience with God to go in has nothing to do with your CD message must have an experience of God to go in oh blessed be the name of the Lord praise girls have a title this morning born not of the will of man but of God oh blessed be the name of born not of the will of man but of God praise the Lord you love him praise God Mimi I'll see if I could get it in the Amplified and let's see what that says here praise God to us blessed be the name of the Lord oh give him praise though [Applause] all right in the Amplified which was 12 John 1 as many as did receive and welcome him he gave the authority power privilege right to become the children of God that is to those who believe adhere to and trusting and rely on his name who all their birth neither the Bloods nor to the will of the flesh that is by physical impulse nor to the will of man that is of a natural father but to God they are born of God oh blessed be the name of the Lord so the birth God wants to put on you is have nothing to the will of the father or the desire of the flesh but is of God born not of the will of man but of God oh praise the name of the Lord you love him this morning so I'm just going to go through some things and you'll see what the Lord will do the first doctrine of Jesus was you must be born again that was his first Doctrine and it's a very deep one there are so many different meanings that people put to it nearly all churches say You must be born again each one of a different interpretation of what it means to be born again remember it didn't say you ought to be born again he said you must and the English people understand the word must means it's absolutely you've got to do it it's a must not you ought to or you're better off if you did but you must be born again and we would like to take that word this morning and break it down that it is totally impossible it's essential and great it's totally impossible to enter the kingdom of God or even see it until you are born again born again we ought to seek it out with all our hearts to find out what it means and no matter how much you think you are right and we are right in saying a Creed and joining a church oh here this one no matter how much we think we are right insane of creed or joining a church you are still what you are until you are born again of the spirit of God it doesn't change you you change church that you change you you change Creed that you change you you change tracks that they change you something has happened within to change you or give the Lord some praises Hallelujah are you with me listen to it again your Creed join in church changing your ideas or your good intentions or do as good as it might seem it is still not right there is something got to happen something have to something have to happen the new birth is an experience something that take place I don't care what they say in this message a new book is an experience something that takes place that you alone know happen to you and when it happened to you know Devlin Hill could shake it out or take it out Jesus said in this way Upon This Rock I'll build my church and the rock is a revelation much as when Fire come upon that or give the Lord a praise Oh Glory look good maybe season do you get that Revelation is when the spirit reveals to you not your mother not your father you see when it's in your head somebody tell you this and you're going to show somebody telling this and you're going through somebody tell you this and your mind confused that is because you have no Revelation yet when that Revelation strike you they could say what they want they could talk what they want if there's something other in your soul if the pastor backslide you not backsiding because there is something in your soul That's The Rock he said Upon This Rock glory to God the church is not built upon concrete oh this is not the church here the church is the mystical body of Jesus Christ the church is the body of Christ internationally so wrong the world right now somebody again baptized maybe in in India or in China or in Africa or in Europe or in America or in South America or in Trinidad and when God take them into the Kingdom so no devil could stop them and pull them out when God put your name on that book no devil have no erase that they raise the name of that book you are going to be filled with the Holy Ghost the power of God gonna come upon you the latter rain is going to fall there's going to be signs there's going to be bundles there's going to be Miracles and I am not crazy okay the Lord some praises I pray for this brother to preaching me I pray for this one I prefer that one go be a private one prevent one that doesn't change you you prefer what you're here you prefer what are being taught but you are the same person same Trinidadian with the Trinity Spirits upon you you have to get the cast out that train that demon have to leave you know not nice Trinidad Hallelujah Glory Hallelujah that's not the holy ghost that is children Spirit America have the spirit fans have their Spirit Germany have the spirit and chair of a spirit are we gonna blast that tell the Holy Ghost begin to walk inside of here and have the the fire inside of here oh Glory I don't care about your training Spirit may God rip it up may God blast it up okay the Lord has praise in this house glory to God hallelujah let me see that praise God I ain't come to make no message to your Channel The Message Church in a certain way I am not in that channel I want a Bible Church I want a church that you can sign in the scriptures when they went in your problem they were praising unpleasant God continually fire was upon them when they beat them the Holy Ghost they granted the prayer meeting and say oh God straighten your servant and they will refill but the Holy Ghost one baptism many resilience one baptism many feelings you can be refilled this morning you can be baptized this morning or can the Lord some Praises you can be delivered this morning I under leaving everyone will be delivered whose name is on that book Glory [Applause] that which is born of the flesh is still flesh you can have money it's still flesh you can have car itself it is still flesh that which is born of the flesh is flesh but that which is born of the spirit is Spirit you must be born again for Glory to God hallelujah Glory Glory Glory God bless you with the fine atmosphere this morning glory glory to God has an anointed inside this building this morning maybe return that corner we talk about or glory of God hallelujah hallelujah all right let's go the reason we have to be born again is because the Bible teaches us we will all born in sin shaped in iniquity and communist World speaking lies I remember after that there is none righteous no not one oh hallelujah praise God so all and who want to sit down in Moses seat and judge this one and judge us one praise God tell your story walk in take your seat and walk with it oh God yes hallelujah or was born in sin and ship iniquity common the world speaking lies then that shows here we go that our need here to begin with is simple to start we are no good to begin with so we cannot claim anything by our shoulders our sincerity how great we are how little we are whatever more we are all together wrong whether you don't talk to nobody you're still wrong whether you're bold and aggressive you're still wrong whether you're dressed long you're still wrong whether you're just shocked you're still wrong or kill the Lord some praises this is nothing but the truth we pumping that word this morning oh God born in sendship iniquity that's why the First Gospel Jesus preached you must be born again hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah could you imagine this in this message and people say ain't nobody Pop I know my room and nobody press come down you must be born again got the Lord some praises they were going to tribulation with all your books with all your tips with all your knowledge and the Bible said in First Corinthians 13 do I have all knowledge and all knowledge and don't have charity it profited me nothing all glory to God do I have faith to move mountains it profit me nothing charity suffered long and it's kind charity that the buffed itself up that's not easy that easily provoked get me started this morning look at me started this morning all them big shots with the crazy mystery Revelations then I'm standing up in front of charity and tell them I know a new name I know the king's sword I know this and only trumpets I know the vials are not in between you third one [Applause] we are no good to begin with we cannot claim anything by our shoulders our sincerity how great we are how little we are whatever more we are wrong and there is nothing at all that we can do about it who given one thought Jesus said that God just by thinking see we get to Orlando see if we are short enough Whatever It Is by giving thought you can't add not one cubit to your stature amen Hallelujah so watch he says here you know he said let's examine it so you you can't help yourself so just throw it all out I'm so glad it does because it laid in the thought of knowing something smart we poor illiterate people will be left out so we wouldn't have a chance but God changed it never had it that way in the beginning the churches always make it complicated yeah did you hear about currently the churches always makes it complicated that is why people talk about me because I see it so how they would unfolding one by the time tell me about you is patient too late you say praying for me that I could get deep I say pray for my brother pregnant brother because I've already I'm ready to go deep [Music] we might barbecue it but it's the same word same message that's why I put some sauce in it but it's the same thing be satisfied with the word of God be satisfied with what God promised be satisfied it's a word to you oh so if you're inside of here in your feet I'm not revelating enough I know that's not a word or do I have enough Revelation pray for me oh God pray for my pastor give him Revelation Lord open his eyes help him Jesus Hallelujah all right so God made it simple and brought it to a place where all of us can see all of us can have it it is for whosoever will so to be born of the spirit or to be born of the flesh is to have the wisdom of the world and the wisdom will obey his fleshly teacher to be born of the spirit here we go is to believe and obey the teaching of the Bible by the Holy Ghost and a man that's born of the spirit will obey God's word regardless of what any tradition tells him now you may laugh but when I begin to read the word and I begin to see beautiful perfect certain scriptures was just quickly to me like that and I was in the Catholic church and when I went to the presented father foreign and and those days was the Gideon I think these rich people who buy Bibles and put it in hotels and stuff the Gideon people pass through the schools College Princess Stone and they give all the Bibles I see friends small little bible but I took it and I began to read it that was the beginning of I'm getting rechargeable I was connected to this little book I had that book with me all the time my book I was given that book and I kept it and I read it and it had something inside it was striking me well the thing was Matthew 5 14 beautiful perfect and in my spirit I wasn't baptized yet I didn't come to my message yet in my spirit I just felt something about that word I am to be perfect something deep inside I am to be perfect so when I connect with this message it was Perfection okay the Lord some Praises hey Abraham said Isaac loved Jacob Grace but chose a Perfection the Capstone where they'll get the lots of praises Hallelujah glory to God Amen all right so watch this now who so to be born of the spirit is to believe and obey the teachings of the Bible by the Holy Ghost and a man that's born of the spirit will obey God's word regardless of what any Traditions tells him you are reborn and I don't see people in organizations that born again he says sure not the organization is Born Again individuals in there are born again but the organization only breaks him away from God that's all it does separates you regardless of the flesh here we go denomination teaches the flesh so the national Spirits in this message Only Could Teach the flesh the cat is bride because they teach the people that are not born again of the spirit so for 40 years 30 years 20 years the teaching flesh and people like the flesh that's why they're staying so like the scripture my people like it so they like it so and they go take it so but the bride want this word friend or no friend or give the Lord a shout I'm saying it I say it to you friend or no friend whether I maintain my family or not let me maintain Christ oh lord is my prayer think or drunk denomination or no denomination friend or no friend family or no family are staying with this word okay the Lord some praises glory to God that's the revelation mine to be born again means to be built from above with it from above it means from above to be born means to be bulleted from above now watch you've seen a bird that comes from above because you've been born here not to be born again you have to be born from up here to be born again and that kingdom is so much higher than this Kingdom so much greater than this Kingdom till this kingdom is foolishness to that to be born of the spirit is to believe and behave yourself in the spirit is to understand and believe with your heart that Jesus is Christ and this is his word and no other words can be added to it or taken away from it without your name taken out of the Book of Life that's a strong one like us reading something whole a so-called Christian in America now when some pastors preaching about similarly monk they say we get a liberal gospel from that too easy so you see all the politics and all the mess I'm thinking twists in the people Minds that they know they rejecting the Bible itself they're rejecting what Jesus said love your enemies and do go to them they don't want that now some of them have Stones right Stone adulterers and so they might bring back the Old Testament and think they're ready the judge and the fight and the war they're ready for Back living that is why they're going to close only churches that is why in so-called Christians you know who didn't crucify Jesus it wasn't Romeo he came onto his own on his own we receive him not his own is who turned him down but as many as received him to them only to them give power shout out power the message will the one power they have a form of godliness and denying the power but he gets power to become come on now power to become faith is a revelation but on top of faith is that virtue and virtuous power and power is what powers you to knowledge and ten presentations of godliness and brotherly kindness power to become or can the Lord some praises the sons of God Oh Glory to God praise God brother Stephen God will have some sons in this last days some born Sons some cell Sons some elected Sons some anointed Sons some adopted Sons okay the Lord some Praises real sons in the last days not no hypocrite not no make believe nothing genuine Holy Ghost Sons go go have them I believe that I believe there are some Sons like that right inside of his building I believe your sons are wrong in Trinidad praise God I believe they are Sons around the world and God will call him out one by one glory to God [Applause] it's God Amen all right let me read this again this is good to be born of the spirit is to believe and behave yourself in the spirit you know some people have no Behavior from small you know they get baptized and they say they change I'm still on no Behavior still Behaving Badly and sometimes if it's a choice you could choose to behave right that's a choice and you

is why you're here this morning that's why you're in this message that's why it was foreign foreign let's go the new birth is to be built from above then we are active in the things from above oh my for it is himself acting in his word through you Born Again from above then we are active in the Kingdom above for his life is in us which is his word Vindicated the word itself I know we know it but listen to it again the spirit that is in you is the word made flesh in you or he said it this way the spirit is the word turned into power or the word turned on now the secret is what the word is in the bride and at the appointed time God turn the word on and the kingdom of Hell in trouble because that's the word turned on or give the Lord some praises do you catch it the secret is what the word is in the pride what were the pastor's word no God sent a prophet with the book open and he brought Spirit spoken words and he's in books and tapes and when we say what the tape say or Echo what the tape say this word goes inside of you not my Revelation not my interpretation I'm a eunuch I have no seed of my own I have no message of my own I am preaching another man's message God sent William Branham that last prophet of the last age as it was the four on the second coming of Jesus Christ Hollywood with a message or can the Lord our prayers we are in that message we are part of that message nobody could throw us out take us out try to solve their Liars they can do nothing about it Oh Glory to God gave the Lord some Praises this morning [Applause] the spirit that's in you is the word made flesh in you the spirit Minds the word and is active and vindicating the word now the spirit is not active in any denomination it is not interested in making organization because the spirit itself is contrary to the organization so Holy Spirit could be there they may have an atmosphere anointing but not the spirit these Spirits are talking about the spirit is the word the spirit follows the word that's why the bride becomes a word for Revelation 20 17 to be effective and the spirit and the price say come the bride becomes the word and the spirit monks the pride and then the pride begin to speak and you're going to your family and you're going to your loved one and you're going to the laws and you're going to your Fallen brother but the spirit itself Oh Glory to God Hallelujah

deny Christ and you know and they come and they went now they sell all they have and bring a nursing the fire and they come to bring the good they just after this all he said yeah yeah all look he

speaking it's God speaking God will send his own witness the witness of the Holy Ghost the angel of his presence to go before us the angel could be on the platform oh give the Lord a shout the angel could be moving to the building Oh Glory to God give the Lord some Praises this morning Hallelujah [Applause] Jesus is the word of God I think we said this last week or Wednesday night to believe and he was busted open that life the life inside the seed this life which is Spirit water flowing over the spirit over the seat of God will bring forth the life of the seed it brings forth something else there's some other kind of seed there so it's if it's a seed it's watering it will produce the life of the seed so Jesus died to release his but from his body came water blood spirit right he released the watering Spirit to find the seeds dice hold this message from you because a spirit seven spirits was released throughout only it to pick up the seeds and connect you with the book because the book of your names in it so when God pick you up he connected his Pokemon books he connected to the message that you could see your name that you could know that you are now a predestineral seed Oh Glory to God give me come on say Amen somebody let's ride on me now when God said let there be light it wasn't like yet that word let there be light was a word seed it may take a million years and then there was light that's a real seed manifest because as a manifestation of the word seed let there be light so when God said let there be you that's potential [Applause] so the spirit find you connected to the word message and then the spirit has to connect back with you to baptize that seed inside of you with power oh get the Lord I shout in the house Oh Glory to God the water and spirit has to come upon your seed that you could be born from above not of the will of man not of the will of the flesh but of God [Music] [Applause] I have a sucker for you in a human being I will show you the Pentecostal wasn't really born you know all right let me you'll get it all right brother Brown the spirit of God comes forth to water the seed and if it's the seed it is watering it will produce the life of the seed how come they don't want to ask for the spirit when the spirit is what Waters the seed you know what also water deceive it your praises your praises your worship the same camel that Rebecca watered in the same camel that took her to Isaac oh give the Lord a shout he said the common is a power and your water the word with your praises with your shouts with your hallelujahs with your glory not what you have face and you're silent and the devil on top your top lip pausing on your mouth no you're up on your mouth and you give God some praises let me see them I'm telling you the devil but nowhere else I told my devil in Trinidad fighting worship fighting Praises fighting the atmosphere they're fighting everything because it gave the minister leeway to pump their own thoughts and ideas Oh Glory to God but if we're looking for the sea to come to life we have to get the water and spirit Oh Glory to God of the Holy Ghost to come upon that sea that's inside of you oh God remember the secret is the word is in the bride the secret is the seed is in the bride who brought the seed son of man okay the Lord some Praises Glory though God Luke 17 30. he brought the seed we don't have a seed the son of man is the sower but a Stephen of The Good Seed the good seed inside of you oh glory to God we're not anointing fall some will be for 84. some will be foreign but you will bring forth all right [Applause] so do you get it now watch if the spirit of God comes to water the ceiling it would produce the life of the seed and this is where but when I'm tired all within John 4. all of God's Sons must be the same to be born of the word and spirit ah you're born again of The Incorruptible will of God that's a script to be read right to be born of the word and spirit brings us back to the spoken word again like in John 3. so this is where he ties in you must be born again in this messaging This Time by word and spirit to be born of the water and the spirit what does it do it brings you right back into the place where you should have been at the beginning and that's the reason of Christ's debt to bring us right back to sons of God you must be born again Hallelujah not of the will of man but of God how by word and spirit so the Pentecostals they rejected the word they rejected the prophet and they couldn't move on to adoption and it appears that that was the birth but listen to this spot my no this brings you right back to spoken word then we are God's word made manifest that makes me a Brandon because I'm the seed the two agreements with their sperm together with the seed make me when God and His word becomes one that is when God's spirit Waters the seed of God which is the word of God it produces God it is not the individual when Jesus was raised in the dead what did he do he had a private Ministry to his disciples it wasn't by the Sea it wasn't feeding five thousand it wasn't to the multitude it was an idea it was to the group that the seven tons got other voices too it was to a group of elected believers Hallelujah where he opened the understanding and he opened the word it's two things because if the word don't open a word open you don't be understanding you're still messed up if you're understanding good and you don't have the word open you're still messed up it needs to have your understanding open and the word so when you're understanding and the Word was open they were ready to give Jesus a good sign off remember after Jesus died everybody crying and silently gone he gone he must have gone Jesus told everybody don't go the comforter will not come if I don't know the water will not come if I don't walk the spirit will not come I will not leave you comfortless I'm going to come to you okay the Lord I praise Jesus told them that when he wrote when he died they said he had to rebuke them and then when they get the group together he began to reveal to them the mysteries of what was promised for their day so he had to go into Isaiah 28 with Tamarin lips he had to go enjoy prophecy he shall come to pass I poured my spirit you have to identify himself in the Old Testament to identify to them what they must receive and then he breathed on them receiving Holy Ghost glory to God his breath he breathed upon them receiving the Holy Ghost Holy Ghost and put them under expectation and say tarry in the city of Jerusalem until you be endured with power from on high not far from a book not performer understanding your Mysteries power from on high this is the one from above now this is fire from above power from above you know again from above all glory to God the rain from above [Applause] I'm gonna be seated let's go so the Bible is manifested again like in the early days of Christ cause and I want your shout on this one cause you ready you are a predestinated seed just like Christ was thank you no when you say Amen you're saying amen because you believe that you know if you don't believe at your daughter say Amen this is a Believers this this court has Believers only one you are a predestinated seed just like Christ was and when the rain falls not if when the rain falls under seed the life produces itself when the Holy Spirit Falls the Holy Spirit have to fall no man in the Holy Ghost okay the Lord some praises the Holy Ghost will fall the Holy Ghost has to fall and when it fall it will produce the life or the content of that seed and the seed we saw was the perfect man [Applause] let's continue fell on those seeds he said he chose them before the foundation of the world then they were predestinated seed let's talk about you now he chose you when for the foundation of the world and that make you a predestinated scene he called who he called he justified and we Justified he had already glorified so God foreknew you and God called you I look how messed up you were I don't mess up your parents once or your grandparents at the case you're born out born out of adultery I don't care if he was a aborted baby almost praise it doesn't matter if your father was a drunkard and you don't know who your mother is or you don't know your father is that is irrelevant you have a bigger father than your father oh God is the father and he chose you before the foundation of the world and predestinated you unto this very hour that you could go free oh give the Lord some praises Glory look good Hallelujah [Applause] watch Jesus said he chose them will be seated before the foundation of the world and then they were a predestinated season that right here they haul themselves up in the upper room no anointing no atmosphere but they're carrying a boy we have to go there boy we have to remain there the Giants are biscuit it's dry seeds oh Hallelujah trying like quick biscuits dry seeds pour yourself in the upper room what what what is here now I'm here the holes of the upper room DC's the word the word was laying on there without life in it [Applause] the word was in them without life these are predestinated seeds these are people chosen before the function of the world the word is in them the secret the word is in them without life and the frighten they went in the upper room and they lock all the doors and they close all the room because they frighten the Jews they hunted down Jesus followers they're looking to bring long a press Upon Jesus followers but Dynamics are fall yet power airfall yet the car closed we don't yet the car presses out yet we are getting power yet it coming and coming it's coming and coming Oh Glory that God Dynamics is coming

fight up with yourself watch here they hold himself in the upper room DC's the word and the Word was laying on deer without life in it all of a sudden all of a sudden we must Start From Heaven it actually filled all the house where they were sitting and the seeds begin to grow it began to manifest itself the word of God being manifested Hallelujah sudden Oh Glory to God the water began to cut down Hallelujah and then the sea get activated Oh Glory to God has had to stagger like drunk man the upper room was too small for them they pass openly Windows they bust the doors because they started they started stagger now the place you have to get room to move yes I walk him straight in line you have to open the windows open the doors Believers had to stream longest steps and when then people see them they say oh God look at them the drinking up there boy that's why they were so close all the time they under heavy heavy drinks and Peter harder said these people are not drunk that you suppose but this is that that the prophet Joel speaker he said come to pass I'll poured my spirit foreign [Music] I'm excited because one of these days we will say this is that that the prophet William Branham speak of Oh Glory to God I don't have a prophecy is the prophet's prophecy this is that the prophet William Brown and speakers [Applause] fulfilled in your ear oh God and the whole world will see it oh give the Lord some praises hallelujah hallelujah praise God praise God how are we going to finish yesterday you gotta all right let's get a home fishing so I have 19 pages and I'm page six this is great it's very good all right so he's talking about um but I was really excited about this he said now watch this sea church this real sea church with the true spoon the Enoch is all the big shots all the revelations all the inspiration and mystery preachers right remember God never committed his preaching and his gospel to an angel right so the angel it's the man right he never comes to the angels so Philip had been up to Pentecost Jerusalem to worship how many he says Amen to that do you not he had been really deity and LD and everything else but why didn't he get something he come back down studying the prophecy of Isaiah although Angel the angel directed Philip to him but the Doom of Life had to come through the body no he said brother we are on the line where did the term come from to the angel the angel showed him where to go and Angel is a messenger here's a son Philip at the gym the message the word that is how a child can be born oh Hallelujah are we coming back to that yes we are going to come right back to that so Philip had the gym the message the word now some people could only say message and word they can't say German inciting message come like a book giving out we're giving up but the gym had to be an inside Iman do you get that now all right here you know watch that's how watch me born Philip laid his hands upon Him Philip baptized him in the name of Jesus Christ and there Comfort the spirit of God the germ had to come from the body what body Christ's body and Philip was a member of that body just two examples and we're gonna move on then he switches to Cornelius the same thing took place in Acts 10 48. Peter wasn't housed up angel directs him to conina's house but where did the word come from the body he said I feel pretty good I feel like traveling on watch now while Peter speak these words not the angel not the Cardinal while Peter spake these words he was the body he had the word the word took a hole the angel directed it but life come to the body Oh Glory to God so while Peter speak the word word and spirit Cornelius was filled with the Holy Ghost he was activated as a son and he get baptized yet Oh Glory to God that means the Holy Ghost come into a heart condition the right condition what was his condition fasting always a man a given person a free person and God have a memorial for how free he give Oh Glory to God God recognize the faith in that man and he was a gentile or give the Lord some Praises he wasn't a Jew he was a gentile and God fill him with the Holy Ghost isn't that right is identified scientifically and by the reaction by his character and everything else just the same as it was when it was in the dwelling in the body of God's only begotten son so does it dwell in the body of his adopted Sons for the last days prophecy just as the pillar fact was dwelling in Jesus Christ only begotten son so with that pill of fire dwell in the body of his adopted son in the last days are you with me now hallelujah hallelujah God is uniting his bride she is coming together from the East and the West not South there's a United sign what is United for the rapture what is getting already yes sir isn't that right she's United herself with a bridegroom and a bridegroom is the word and the church and the bride and the word is becoming one until the very word itself is working out the work of the bridegroom yes that's all you know we get in one we start a manifest the works of the bridegroom no more joint Church no more joint church he said watch United not join church he said the saints that are asleep in the dust of the earth will weaken and we will Unite with them the living ones with the ones that are already dead they're like Mundus and brother Knights and all them going on Amen going on before isn't that right it seems that are sleeping is that right watch and the ones that are living that uniting themselves with the word and those that are gone already did that it all comes together make one great Union and uniting before going up God uniting time remember now there's a uniting of the word bringing back the faith that was once delivered to the sins and that could only be done in this day the only time it could be done is right now it never was attacked anywhere else they went off in National sprees but now it don't belong to no denomination spirit because are you ready it is time for the anointing of men and women of every race every color every Creed everything under Christ by the baptism of the Holy Spirit and back to the word he did not say United by some Revelation or some inspiration or some interpretation but but by the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen and back to the word brother Branham let me say something this United time to see Churches United Nations United I believe that the bride of Christ is called I believe she is sealed into the kingdom of God I believe the mechanics is here they are waiting for the Dynamics to take her off the Earth he is the dynamic [Applause] so how you can go without Christ the Capstone holy to the world Christ The Headstone how you could go without Christ's Dynamics he is the Dynamics we just become members of the machine of his body forming ourselves into His Image as we see him uniting himself with his works with his love gifts as he hands them to us just before the resurrection the Dynamics of this church I like what the prophet said here generalizes you know this church will be a refilling of the Holy Spirit that we have worked in a small measure while The Headstone is coming down to unite the body so what God is saying I'm gonna give you power virtue a small measure to work with it but that power will come at the top charity or clock will be the Dynamics of your mechanics oh give the Lord some praises the Dynamics of this church would be a refilling of the Holy Spirit that we have worked in a small measure while The Headstone is coming down to unite the body and when the head and body unites together with a punch the full power of the Holy Ghost would raise her up just exactly like that even the dead in Christ for hundreds of years ago will rise in the beauty of his Holiness and take a flight to the skies the Dynamics is the Holy Spirit Oh Glory get a lot some praises glory to God the Dynamics is the Dynamics is the Holy Spirit oh my God you may be seated and I'm not finished yet hallelujah hallelujah Oh Glory let's go chicken being born that's born from an egg it's maturing in his old eggshell the old inner parts of the egg has to rot away it has to take a little beak and scrape back and forth and break the shell out we call it dipping its way out they never found a better way it is God's provided way you try to help them you'll kill him you try to help him you kill him somehow we help any process we want to help be sorry for the person yeah some parents have killed right now but the wrong kind of love who either spoil children but not good now I don't have no grandchildren we are grandchildren oh God God had children and every Sunday coming to god let's not go there tonight what you try to help him you'll kill him pick the over him he will die he has got to labor train Ed and that's the way a Christian has to do it ain't somebody shaking your hand taking you in you got to lay it there till you die rot and a ball into the kingdom of God is this what the message we should know or is it that yeah I mean you know like somebody blessing every other Church and when they blast every other Church the people psychologically thinking that they are in the righteous you know is a psychological thing that they they're messing with people's mind they've seen everybody's enemy everybody did every Church did that's not true so then psychologically people say well we are right we are I privilege to be here boy you have a period to die to rut so that's why the Bible said the kingdom is preached and every man pressed their way into it it's a present some people loafing on their parents in church so they figure the people appears as Christians they're Christian too they're not true you know they're not sure at all so you watch that's the way Christian has to do it aims somebody just shaking your hand taking you in you got to lead it until you die rot and are born in the kingdom of God is God's providing rain and that comes through suffering that comes through pain just come to God cornering you and Outing you having your own way and making your whole stream see if your father and mother not having a holding strain and you just again your own way you can spoil breath you know like a spoiled child then you know God don't have none of that you know and God let your whole stream and I want to know why he taking the longer answer and that will be backstage thank God taking longer answer then then they start to answer for their own self and and then afterwards they have questions when the last go nuts because they go into a whole different thing altogether because they don't want to wait upon God but please the Bible says utterly fall but they just wait upon the Lord shall you their strength why don't you wait upon God yeah yeah wait upon God things that we cannot wait upon God stay on your knees stay in prayer stay in the spirit until God breaks you and give an answer he does answer hallelujah praise God they say they found no better way for baby right when a baby is born you could put a bell by it and say my little son I read books on the razor baby when you're hungry ring the bell it will never work the only way you can get what they want is to cry fit that is God's way and the only way we could get what we want is the cry fit big man don't cry but stay there you go stay hungry if you wanted you cry for it all man Jack I forgot all man I don't care how old you are young yeah you want it from God you cry for it just just talking I said oh God you promise it oh God if if you ain't give it to me you're hearing me tomorrow if I answer the day you're gonna come back tomorrow I know your ears not death I know you could hear and are coming to bother you again so you hear me until it come you will hear me until I get an answer I want an answer for this situation I wanna answer for this condition Oh Glory to God you're crooning your travailing this is what God wants in the church oh help me Jesus my Lord my Lord you know what has scare me the Bible talk about it whatever I'm talking about because ever because iniquity will abound the love of many gonna work school I am scared of that that's why I fighted all iniquity and fighting all the things that will try to tie up your desire and love for God you have to fight that fight on a daily basis you want that love to be active you want to love the Saints you want to love the word you want to love the worship they want to love the cause they want the love what God promised to do what he expected him to do cry out and say cry out don't be ashamed say I'm hungry for God don't care whether the Deacon's Pastor whatever is a wrong scream out can you know the Jones sitting there what difference does it mean the Jones don't know like you're already still cry out praise God over them don't like you praise God cry out cry out in desperation let them take you back sudden let them take your sin let them take you there's anything whatever they want that's their mind that let your devil want to walk their mind let it work their mind you have nothing to do with that you cry no you know what you're crying for they don't know what's upon your heart they don't know what you're going through get to know your situation you know what they're going through you know what you have need of you have a cries to get in the spirit you have a passion to know the word you have a firm a desire to please God that says what is important Glory Hallelujah cry he said cry out until I get help he said well you know you'll be seated all right oh yeah time all right we know the overseas must before music can come out of the old seed it must rot absolutely not die only but rot after it is dead that's an extra thing now after dead is the rot now then he said now we know that it's true and that's the same thing in the New Birth we never go back we go forward when you're born again and that's why I think that there's so many they have no so many not rather genuine new Birds it's because the seed will sympathized with the word or the person but they don't want to rot away from the old system that they were in there's a bunch of foolishness and they come I remember in the early days when people come on arima when we have a vasilica service I say you come here because any Deliverance because people come looking to help and they come through this thing and they come with all the benefits a sister come and she wants to know she wants to know what she want to do stuff I said listen my wife you know because the church she was in from the pastor wife wasn't in order so therefore she was doing a set of stuff that he passed what I'm supposed to do I say this you know I said my wife's in order you know so I have no vacancy for that person out there you know we're looking normal normal but there's a something inside of us you know we could stand normal normal too you know we could tell you the truth normal normally you know oh Hallelujah they don't want to rot away from the old system that they were in they don't want to come out of it they want to stay in the old system and clean the new bird you can't say independence message you you can't claim in a sexy church and claim the Seven Seas break to you that can't work that way yeah they have to leave them groups and leave them churches they have to get out is the old system then rather it praise God foreign this is important they know the whole system is dead but they just don't want to rut out of it no rot is when you're already done away with it here we go are you ready now this is a special teaching this morning a clean that they are newborn but a claim is only a begotten sign rotten brings forth the new birth and what is a soaking because it's not more in this claim is a big cotton sign I claim the Holy Ghost I claim my healing I claim I claim I claim I claim but rotten brings forth to New Birth all right let me continue when Wesley it ceased on all these ages or blades come out of the stalk or tassel when the Pentecost will come up to the restoration of the gifts they have to come out of the Baptist Presbyterian but with Holiness Nazarene Jesus Christ so-called all of that they have to come out of it and rot away from it to accept the new birth praise God what about him because okay so Judas come back with joy he said remember them right he said and they come back rejoicing he Rejoice he said don't Rejoice Jesus that the devil is subject to you but Rejoice because the names written on the book of life because your name is on the book of life because it is in heaven no watch but that still doesn't mean that you are saved you are not converted until you receive the Holy Ghost remember that you're only potentially converted if you're asking for oak tree and I give you an acorn potentially you have a oak tree if you ask me for a cornfield and I see a corn come up at that high potentially avoc Field of Corn but it's not developed yet something could happen no you're on your road now to justification sanification to the bathroom of Holy Ghost but when you are genuinely baptized with the Holy Ghost you are in the king them no you say brother is that true then he going on in the wood now I'm only home fresh here Saint John 17 17 Jesus said sanctify them by their truth that word is truth and Judas Peter on the night of betrayal he said to Peter after you are converted then striking your brethren after you're converted the man had followed him for three years had his name on the Lamb's Book of Life had cast out Devils done great works healed don't all kind of preach the word and everything else and still wasn't converted Peter he switches here now about a baby when the Act take place between egg and sperm potentially the baby is dear when the ACT is done together and that is in the mother's womb is potentially a baby watch then the body is developed second stage but the baby has to be born here and then it receives the bread of life it is not the Breath of Life you say oh it's a life no it isn't that is little nerve-juking and muscles the baby hasn't received life till it is born you may jump and jerk but you've got to be born so he's teaching something here now do you get that now egg and sperm come together Life begin to form but that they're born yet that's only begotten now let's notice Luke 24 49 he had commissioned the apostles after they have been saved and sanctified then he gives them power to heal the sick Castle devils and so forth and the Holy Spirit you are believing unto eternal life and when the Holy Spirit comes it is eternal life then he switches again this is very important this is one of the most important part of the service today this part you have to listen to this part watch your begotten of the of the sanctification so sanctification is the blood isn't that right water blood spirit and he is showing that sanctification is where you are begotten that means if you're not Sanctified there's a problem so you have to come at the sanctification before you get that full breath by the spirit you are begotten of the spirit of sanctification but never born of the spirit until the Holy Ghost comes in that's correct a baby got a life in the womb of the mother little muscles are quivered it's a life but it's a different life when it breeds the bread of life in this nostrils it is different my dearest Methodist brother primoleness sanitation is cleansing which is preparation of life but when the Holy Ghost comes it is life preparation is the cleaning the vessel the Holy Ghost is filling the vessel sanification means clean and set aside for service the holy spirit is put it in service you are vessel that God have cleaned up all right be going great and we find out that the Holy Ghost is God himself God was above you in the pillar of fire with Moses God was with you in Jesus Christ now is God in you in the Holy Ghost not three Gods God had a plan he wanted to work among men he brought in the pillar of fire which was the Mystic fire that hung over the time of Israel and before Imam was I am he was that fire I come from God I go back to God is that right but here he is today the same Pillar of Fire doing the same things now notice Jesus commissioned them to Jerusalem and wait the word tari means to wait doesn't mean to pray there was not fit subjects yet to preach because they only knew his resurrection by his person let me read it again they only knew his resurrection by his person of seeing him outside he commanding them not to preach anymore not to do anything until first they had been endured with power from on high or give the Lord some Praises they knew of his resurrection but they didn't have that Resurrection inside of them they could see Jesus and say he is raised from the dead but that wasn't quick unto them they needed another witness then he'll perform on high and Jesus said you shall receive power after the holy water upon you and you shall be Witnesses unto me [Applause] hello Brandon I do believe any preacher is sent of God or correctly ordained because God is infinite and what God does once he does all the time now if God would would not let them preach until they went to Pentecost and receive the Pentecostal experience no man unless somebody desire of his own or some organization has commissioned him has the right to end up Pulpit until they've been filled with the Holy Ghost because he's leading them by intellectual conception until he is filled with the Holy Spirit Hallelujah Hallelujah glory to God question when you use the expression that we do not believe the word we will be eternally separated from Christ do you mean the foolish versions will live eternally but they will be separated from the New Jerusalem where Christ will dwell with a bride here are those who do not have the Holy Spirit born again as the scripture speaks of being born again the natural birth requires water blood and spirit does not the spiritual bullet require all three stages of grace before the person's truly born again he said absolutely I just explained that this morning you've got to have all stages you are begotten of the spirit just like a baby is begotten in the womb of the mother but not born until they receive the Holy Ghost you are born then you are not converted you are in the possession of being converted until that time yeah the bomb are you ready that's the reason that all these great Mysteries could not be given to Luther could not be given to Wesley could not be given to the age just pass by the Pentecostal age they will begotten so brother Branham as a prophet revealing the son of man identify the Pentecostal experience as back in the womb so then he was waiting for a bright body that would be born of the word that could receive the Mysteries for Glory to God born of the word and spirit so the Pentecostals couldn't get the Mysteries because they were in the womb or give the Lord a shout so you can only correctly born of the word in this message bird and spirit corner of The Incorruptible word of God first the word coming to you and then the spirit comes and water the word inside of you glory to God are you ready we almost on the home stress here now Hallelujah here we go so then if that be so this is to be another Holy Ghost pouring out among the bright buddy I have to have a scripture a quote that identify when they're supposed to take place and then the prophet says in the super sign he said when that light struck little Rebecca she knew something was within her that reported to Isaac she failed the face she wanted no one to do with her own thinking Isaac wasn't thinking from then on and the church itself when it strikes that power of God the baptism of the Holy Ghost prophecy out of the national churches so he's not talking about Pentecostal he's not talking about charismatics he's not talking about anybody is older he's someone in this message when the church strikes the power of God out of the universal churches out of the Catholic Church wherever it is when the baptism of the Holy Ghost is made real to the people you mean this baptism have to become real real real real real real real all right when the baptism Holy Ghost is made real to the people them that is predestined like you people here Dayton life see it and walk in it it's a super sign and you're going to possess the Gate of the enemy Oh Glory to God hallelujah praise God praise God music God please hallelujah praise God ours are more stuck but we'll leave it another time you'll be seated hold that God accept some in the church to deliver peace they get treatment when a church like this it's grown in under the persecution of the outside world believing in the Lord Jesus what you believe in that the promise of the Holy Ghost is just as real to us as it was the Pentecost that's on Tabernacle Church bright church this Holy Ghost has to be just as real you want the same Holy Ghost the same Penny same power same acts 1 8 you want nothing less than that glory to God watch when a church has grown in under the position of the outside world Jesus you may be seated that the promise of the Holy Ghost is just as it was the Pentecost how they groan and cry on the labor pains but when they are born unpositionally born into the kingdom of God then the Holy Ghost has set in the church some Apostles some prophets some teachers in other words a faithful Ministry is Spirited by a position of birth of the Holy Ghost and a faithful Ministry brings on the ministry of the spirit to Quicken the word to the bright this dies right in advance the right message Lord Give the Lord has shout in the house praises [Applause] I'll stop right there on page 12.
