[29:40] name amen and amen God bless you thanks
[29:43] for coming out have faith in God
[29:47] Amen tonight we want to have a a
[29:49] scripture one scripture second Peter 1
[29:52] we want to read from verse 47 2 Peter 1
[29:56] 47
[29:58] says here whereby are given unto us
[30:00] exceeding great and precious promises
[30:02] that by these you might be partakers of
[30:05] the divine nature having escaped the
[30:07] corruption that is in the world through
[30:09] lust and besides this giv all diligence
[30:13] add to your fate virtue and to Virtue
[30:16] knowledge and to knowledge Temperance
[30:19] and to Temperance patience and to
[30:21] patience godliness and to Godliness
[30:24] brotherly kindness and to brotherly
[30:26] kindness
[30:28] charity may God bless his word you may
[30:29] be seated oh praise the Lord
[30:34] amenl our title
[30:36] tonight the restoration of the true
[30:40] Apostolic Faith true Apostolic
[30:44] teaching through Bible
[30:47] Spirit of a subject the word living and
[30:52] in action the Bible
[30:54] bride and have an inspiration
[30:58] life and godliness through the knowledge
[31:01] of him life and godliness through the
[31:04] knowledge of him
[31:08] now Hosea 4:6 says my people are
[31:13] destroyed for lack of knowledge because
[31:17] thou has rejected knowledge I will also
[31:20] reject thee that thou shall be no priest
[31:23] to me seeing that thou Hast forgotten
[31:26] the Lord of thy God I will also forget
[31:31] thy
[31:31] children so the devil's job is to keep
[31:35] people in
[31:36] ignorance that you know not you don't
[31:40] know and the Bible talk about a fold
[31:43] Ministry till we come into the unity of
[31:46] the faith into the knowledge of the Son
[31:48] of God unto a perfect man am so there
[31:52] has to be a
[31:54] restoration back to the Bible to come
[31:57] back to
[31:58] believe just what God have said because
[32:02] God can't lie regardless of what it
[32:06] looks like is what God Said don't ever
[32:08] look what it looks like you know is what
[32:10] God had said and once we stick with that
[32:14] it will materialize isn't that right so
[32:17] therefore what the devil trying to keep
[32:19] you away away from is thus say the Lord
[32:23] and thus say the Lord comes to the
[32:25] prophets sir so man shall live bread
[32:27] alone but every word that proceed out of
[32:29] the mouth of God and the mouth of God is
[32:31] not men mouth of God is not any man the
[32:35] mouth of God Is His prophets so
[32:37] beginning at Moses who write the the
[32:40] Genesis and all these books and whatnot
[32:42] God spoke to these men and then other
[32:45] men at a su level carry out and pack out
[32:47] the message that these men said but God
[32:50] always have His prophets that bring the
[32:53] the final abitor of the word then what
[32:55] God said it comes to the m of the the
[32:57] prophet that's why the prophet said the
[32:59] spirit the prophet and the bride will
[33:00] say the same thing and what they say
[33:02] will already been said in the word
[33:04] because the prophet cannot come contrary
[33:06] to the word there is a false prophet a
[33:08] prophet only could bring what the word
[33:10] what is in the word so that's why if the
[33:13] word was lost remember the word was lost
[33:16] Through The Seven Ages God sent a
[33:18] prophet to get us back to that that's
[33:21] the whole thing you know that back to
[33:22] that back to the restored word Oh Glory
[33:26] to God why he said I'll send you Elijah
[33:28] the prophet and he shall turn your
[33:30] hearts back to the faith of the fathers
[33:32] because the faith of the fathers come by
[33:33] original word so God had to bring us
[33:36] back to the original and God's spoken
[33:38] word is the original not not not
[33:40] confusus not not all these philosophers
[33:43] no God word is original not not not not
[33:46] Facebook posts not not Time magazine
[33:48] articles God word is original so you
[33:50] have to come back to God's word not this
[33:52] man have an opinion about what God's
[33:54] word say and and and and you know he's
[33:56] seen it so and it's unfolding so not
[33:58] that what God said Oh Glory to God we
[34:01] have to come back to what God said
[34:03] because that's how the devil was able to
[34:04] bring destruction he asked Eve what did
[34:06] God say because he didn't hear from God
[34:09] and you have to hear from God and if you
[34:11] hear from God you're going to get the
[34:12] answer tonight oh give the Lord a shout
[34:15] in the house glory to God do you get
[34:18] that tonight so you get from God by
[34:20] Revelation and Revelation is the father
[34:22] revealing by his spirit so the devil job
[34:25] is to do what get people out of the
[34:27] Spirit get them in the flesh get them
[34:28] into carnality get them all natural but
[34:31] Flesh and Blood ha not reveal it unto
[34:33] you but my father have reveal this upon
[34:36] unto you and Upon This Rock I'll build
[34:37] my church Oh Glory to God do you believe
[34:40] that so there's going to be a Bible
[34:42] bride word living and in action I talk
[34:45] spoke word quotes I'm talking about word
[34:47] living and in action because those
[34:49] disciples they were the Living Word Oh
[34:51] Glory to God because the New Testament
[34:53] was not written yet they were now about
[34:55] to write it by their lives oh give the
[34:57] Lord some Praises so they become the
[34:59] Living Word and the bride in the last
[35:01] days will become the Living Word Oh
[35:04] Glory to God not just a spoken word coat
[35:06] but the Living Word itself it will
[35:08] Thunder Oh Glory to God that will
[35:11] Thunder and I'm going to shake hell's
[35:12] Kingdom you're going to shake the
[35:14] devil's Kingdom oh give the Lord some
[35:16] Praises live voices it going to thunder
[35:19] once more once more the world will hear
[35:22] direct from God it will be a voice word
[35:24] a Living Word Oh Glory to God hallelujah
[35:28] it will line up with the Scriptures it
[35:30] will line up with Living Word it will
[35:31] line up with the spoken word oh God the
[35:34] spoken word The Living Word and the
[35:36] written word Oh Glory to God a Bible
[35:38] bride Hallelujah the word living and in
[35:41] action Oh Glory to giving the world one
[35:43] last view of what God is like oh give
[35:46] the Lord a praise in the house giving
[35:48] the world one last view of what this
[35:50] almighty God is like the unveiling of
[35:53] the Mighty God this bride will unveil
[35:56] God and to unveil God you have to Veil
[35:58] him first oh give the Lord some praises
[36:01] and he is veiled by the word because the
[36:03] secret is the word is in the bride Oh
[36:06] Glory to God all she waiting for is the
[36:08] mind of Christ to know what he wants
[36:10] done with the word oh praise the name of
[36:13] the Lord so don't perish because of lack
[36:16] of knowledge how people get rip off and
[36:18] all kind of fin Financial schemes
[36:20] because they don't know and somebody say
[36:22] hey latest thing they they crash some
[36:24] pyramid scheme some kind of scheme is a
[36:28] scheme that way it is a money scheme
[36:31] lack of knowledge so therefore brother
[36:35] brandham says that he rather a man right
[36:38] in spirit and wrong in Doctrine than a
[36:41] man um how you say um I prefer a man W
[36:45] in the spirit and wrong his doctrine
[36:46] that a man writing his doctr wrong in
[36:48] the spirit that's all well and good but
[36:51] the message didn't come for us to be
[36:52] wrong in
[36:55] Doctrine the message come that will be
[36:57] right in spirit and right in Doctrine
[37:01] because God sent a master teacher in the
[37:02] last days to bring us back to the
[37:04] apostolic teaching because the standard
[37:07] was Paul so God picked a man that could
[37:10] even go further than Paul and he picked
[37:12] that man William Maran brandham to be
[37:14] that end time Elijah Prophet to reveal
[37:17] the whole mystery of God for the
[37:19] rapturing of the church that's the
[37:21] object of revealing the entire mystery
[37:24] Hallelujah and we have sent it more than
[37:26] once the reveal of the Mysteries was
[37:28] that the people might know how to behave
[37:30] themselves and conduct themselves by the
[37:33] spirit Oh Glory to God so the Mysteries
[37:36] is not just to say well we have
[37:37] Mysteries and we following Mysteries we
[37:39] in fivefold Ministry because we can talk
[37:40] plenty and talk long hours about
[37:42] knowledge and information that's not the
[37:43] purpose the purpose is that we'll know
[37:45] how to behave because your behavior is
[37:47] what will set you onto adoption your
[37:49] behavior is what you will get the
[37:51] father's approval your behavior is where
[37:53] the voice will say this is my son in
[37:55] whom I'm well pleased please please to
[37:58] set him to be tested oh give the Lord
[38:00] some Praises I feel good about that one
[38:02] brother
[38:03] Kang Hallelujah not pleased to get power
[38:08] yet not pleased to get power yet my son
[38:12] is I'm pleased with him I could test him
[38:15] now I could test him with his wife I
[38:17] could test him with his children I could
[38:18] T him with SI sickness I could test him
[38:20] I could test him whatever I could test
[38:22] him now I am pleased and that's the road
[38:26] Jesus walked
[38:27] the father was pleased and God loed
[38:29] Jesus to be tested and
[38:32] tempted and then he
[38:34] overcome Hallelujah after busting the
[38:37] devil's throat in the wilderness with it
[38:38] is written because I was a sharp sword
[38:41] you know you know sharp that is Devil
[38:43] Couldn't touch him with that you know it
[38:45] is written it is written is also written
[38:47] a man that could stay with that and deny
[38:50] his own self flesh feelings emotions and
[38:52] everything else that's a powerful man oh
[38:55] glory to God he have control over
[38:58] himself and before the adopted sons have
[39:01] control and power over others and other
[39:03] things he have power over himself oh
[39:05] give the Lord some Praises so Jesus was
[39:08] led by the spirit into the willingness
[39:10] to to demonstrate power over self oh
[39:13] give the Lord a that is what is lacking
[39:15] power over self and the word itself come

[51:50] believe a prophet I not seen that in the
[51:52] word here I am not seeing that friends
[51:55] I'm in the message as an entitlement no
[51:58] here what he say when a church is
[52:01] groaning under the persecution of the
[52:03] outside world Believing on the Lord
[52:06] Jesus that the promise that's the
[52:08] promise of the Holy Ghost is just as

[52:14] you have to believe the promise you know
[52:16] the promise of the Holy Ghost you get to
[52:18] the Holy Ghost just the promise of it
[52:21] that's the promise when when when when

[52:27] didn't say well you know they see my
[52:30] soul so you know I mean no they see his

[53:47] new
[53:48] mystery cu the Bible prophesied they
[53:50] have teachers the ears itching because
[53:53] they're not satisfied with what the word
[53:55] presting so they tired hear these
[53:57] promises is it real to them yet or no
[54:00] but they tired he give us something
[54:03] new Moses went up to get the
[54:06] Commandments of God and in no time at
[54:09] all somebody felt inspired and led say m
[54:11] we don't know where going make us a god
[54:15] Aaron Aaron is a
[54:17] priest Aaron is Moses like right hand
[54:19] man make us a god somebody get get get
[54:23] all the gold they make a golden calf
[54:25] by the time Moses come down they don't
[54:27] Worship in a c
[54:29] already a next
[54:31] God a next anointing and next
[54:34] inspiration next spirit and and you know
[54:37] it's not that God I know what they're
[54:38] doing you know but God working through a
[54:41] channel Moses the ears of God Moses on
[54:45] the on the on the Rock hearing from God
[54:47] when Moses finished so Moses is a man
[54:49] going down there hearing songs of rry is
[54:53] because another God there you know then
[54:55] who's on the Lord's Side and you know
[54:57] the story
[54:58] destruction so watch when they are
[55:01] born and positionally born
[55:05] born and positionally born not just
[55:12] one not just
[55:15] one when they are born and positionally
[55:18] Born Into the kingdom of God then the
[55:23] Holy Ghost has set in the church not
[55:24] something Pastor say I'm a pastor I'm an
[55:26] apostle well you see how I'm moving I
[55:28] like a prophet you see a few words on
[55:29] inspiration not that that's foolishness
[55:32] that's not the message of the hour those
[55:33] men are lined down the pulpit they have
[55:35] to be positionally born God has to
[55:38] identify and place them
[55:40] positionally then then then the Holy
[55:43] Ghost has set not a man Appo not the
[55:46] congregation vo him not not we have
[55:48] nobody else to put not the pastor dead
[55:50] and some Pastor take over and that it

[56:46] tongues interpretations of tongues
[56:49] knowledge wisdom healings Gifts of
[56:52] healing all kinds of Miracles yes it's
[56:55] one complete package it's not a fivefold
[56:57] Ministry and it
[57:00] ends let me say it good it's not a fold
[57:05] Ministry and it ends because gifts is
[57:07] Pentecostal no no no no no this is the
[57:09] word here
[57:10] now this is Apostolic
[57:13] teaching this is how the Bible we have a
[57:15] Bible right 1 Corinthians 12 says this
[57:19] verse four now there are diversities of
[57:22] gifts but the Same Spirit yes there are
[57:26] differences of
[57:27] administration but the same lord and
[57:30] there are diversities of operations but
[57:33] it is the same God say same God same God
[57:36] same God which worketh all in all but
[57:39] the manifestation of the spirit is given
[57:42] to every man to profit with for to one
[57:46] is given by the spirit the word of
[57:50] wisdom to another the word of knowledge
[57:55] by The Same Spirit to another Faith by
[58:01] The Same Spirit I like how Paul
[58:04] emphasizing It Is by The Same Spirit not
[58:06] a different Spirit to another the gifts
[58:09] of
[58:10] healing by The Same Spirit to another
[58:14] the working of
[58:15] Miracles to another prophecy to another
[58:20] Discerning of spirits to another diverse
[58:23] kinds of tongues to another the
[58:26] interpretation of
[58:27] tongues but all these work at that one
[58:31] and the selfsame spirit dividing to
[58:35] every man severly as you will for as the
[58:38] body is one and had many members and all
[58:42] members of that one body being many are
[58:44] one body so also is Christ yes sir and
[58:47] this is where we get 1 Corinthians 13 by
[58:49] one Spirit we are all baptized into one
[58:53] body whether we be Jews or Gentiles do
[58:58] you understand that 144,000 will be
[59:00] sealed I heard the number the angel from
[59:04] the East having the seed of the Living
[59:06] God I thought they seeding their soul
[59:09] too but they have to be sealed and
[59:12] before the Jews are sealed there's a
[59:13] bride to be sealed with the same Holy
[59:16] Ghost the inkhorn
[59:18] writer oh give the Lord some Praises for
[59:22] by one Spirit are we all baptized into
[59:25] one body whether we be Jews or Gentiles
[59:28] whether we be bonded or free and have be
[59:30] made to all drink into one Spirit yes
[59:32] sir for the body is not one member but
[59:36] many if the foot shall say because I'm
[59:39] not the hand I'm not the body is it
[59:40] therefore not of the body if the air
[59:42] shall say because I'm not an eye I'm not
[59:45] of the body is it therefore not of the
[59:46] body if the whole body were an eye where
[59:49] were they hearing if the whole body were
[59:51] hearing where were the smelling now God
[59:54] God here we go had set the members every
[59:59] one of them in the body as it had
[1:00:01] pleased
[1:00:03] him oh give the Lord some
[1:00:06] Praises L as it has pleased him he
[1:00:11] pleaseed to give you a gift of a a
[1:00:13] spirit of Miracles he pleased to give
[1:00:15] you a gift of faith please to give you a
[1:00:17] gift of discernment please to give you a
[1:00:19] gift of faith please to give you tongues
[1:00:21] and
[1:00:23] interpretation
[1:00:26] GL
[1:00:27] Hallelujah that's Verse 18 now God had
[1:00:30] set the members every one of them in the
[1:00:32] body as that pleased him and if they
[1:00:35] were all one member where is the body
[1:00:37] now but now are there many members but
[1:00:41] yet one body and here we go the eye
[1:00:45] cannot say unto the hand I have no need
[1:00:46] of
[1:00:47] thee no again the head to the feet I
[1:00:50] have no need of you nay much more those
[1:00:54] men members of the body which seem to be
[1:00:56] more
[1:00:57] feeble are
[1:01:01] necessary I want to underline are
[1:01:03] necessary tonight you may see them as
[1:01:06] feeble but God say
[1:01:08] are necessary and those members of the
[1:01:12] body which we think to be less honorable
[1:01:15] upon these we bestow more abundant honor
[1:01:18] and our uncomely paths have more
[1:01:20] abundant comeliness for our comely Parts
[1:01:23] have no need but God has tempered the
[1:01:25] body together having given more abundant
[1:01:27] honor to the part which
[1:01:29] lacked purpose verse 25 that there be no
[1:01:33] Schism in the
[1:01:36] body that's the
[1:01:38] purpose that has to be tempered
[1:01:41] Hallelujah everything in its place we
[1:01:43] want the hands where it's supposed to be
[1:01:45] the eyes where it was supposed to be you
[1:01:46] want to turn back but you can't want
[1:01:48] don't want one eye going the back of
[1:01:49] your head because you want to see what's
[1:01:51] going on behind no you want your eyes in
[1:01:54] front just how God put you you want your
[1:01:55] ears in the right position is that right
[1:01:58] here we go now that there be no Schism
[1:02:00] in the body and that the MERS should
[1:02:03] have all this is zeroing now to a
[1:02:05] purpose that the members should have the
[1:02:08] same care one for another oh give the
[1:02:14] Lord some Praises glory to God the car

[1:07:21] you judge it then if you got Christian
[1:07:23] knowledge with your virt Faith you judge
[1:07:25] whether the word is right or wrong and
[1:07:26] if you can lay aside all your Creeds
[1:07:28] your unbelief and everything you claim
[1:07:30] you have done then you have knowledge to
[1:07:32] believe that God cannot lie that is what
[1:07:35] knowledge break out to you oh Glory this

[1:07:45] the first level of knowledge that means
[1:07:47] there's no unbelief in you to doubt God
[1:07:49] what God said because the revelation of
[1:07:51] knowledge means God can't lie once that
[1:07:54] word speaks it it got to come to pass
[1:07:55] hey the devil have no
[1:07:58] room to push you back with unbelief no
[1:08:01] room because you have a knowledge now

[1:08:07] Praises hallelujah hallelujah so it
[1:08:10] makes you shake off your unbelief shake
[1:08:12] off your doubt shake off your fears
[1:08:14] because the knowledge reveals that God

[1:08:22] man words be a lie and man be true see
[1:08:25] now you're getting knowledge that is
[1:08:27] supreme knowledge you don't have to have
[1:08:29] four degrees in some college because all
[1:08:31] these virtues are given to you by God to
[1:08:34] place upon the foundation of your faith
[1:08:36] that you might come to the full stature
[1:08:39] of a real living man of God at knowledge
[1:08:42] because knowledge of his word you must
[1:08:44] believe it this way such as we believe
[1:08:46] it and accept it that the days of
[1:08:48] Miracles is not passed knowledge that
[1:08:51] what God Said God is able to perform
[1:08:53] form then he said Abraham believe that
[1:08:55] and when he was 100 years old he
[1:08:57] staggered under the promise of God true
[1:08:58] unbelief look how ridiculous that would
[1:09:00] look here's a man 100 years old looking
[1:09:02] for a baby to be born into his home by a
[1:09:04] woman 90 years old almost 50 years past
[1:09:07] bearen Liv with her since a young girl
[1:09:09] Teenage here he is his live stream dead
[1:09:12] and SAR room Dead all hopes is gone as
[1:09:14] far as hopes is concerned against hope
[1:09:16] he beli in Hope because he acknowledged
[1:09:19] that God was able to keep everything
[1:09:22] that he promised okay the Lord praise so
[1:09:24] I don't care how dead you are tonight if
[1:09:27] God say resurrect you revive you restore
[1:09:29] you you are going to be revived
[1:09:31] resurrected restored oh give the Lord a
[1:09:34] shout in the house I can't look at what
[1:09:36] the eyes see I have to look at what God
[1:09:38] promised what God
[1:09:40] Said
[1:09:43] Amen through the knowledge now when you
[1:09:46] got it like that then add to your faith
[1:09:48] when you got true virtue add it to your
[1:09:50] faith amen and watch well watch he said
[1:09:54] no well no this scripture is just right
[1:09:56] and acts 238 I don't know what to do
[1:09:58] about it because you don't have enough
[1:10:00] knowledge enough to know God yet but the
[1:10:02] Bible doesn't contradict itself but when
[1:10:05] you can see that the scripture is not
[1:10:07] contradictory that you can say that and
[1:10:09] can see that by revelation of God the
[1:10:12] whole word of God is wrot in Mysteries
[1:10:13] and only the knowledge of God can reveal
[1:10:15] it then when you get and say and
[1:10:18] puncture every word of God with an amen
[1:10:20] add that to your faith now you're
[1:10:22] getting to be pretty a good man now
[1:10:23] you're coming up see with faith with
[1:10:25] virtue knowledge is building this man no
[1:10:28] way of escaping it this is the way to
[1:10:30] become in the full statue of Christ to
[1:10:33] judge right from wrong then you are
[1:10:35] beginning judge right when the preacher
[1:10:37] says the days of Miracle is passed the
[1:10:38] Bible says Jesus Christ him yesterday
[1:10:40] forever then you know what to believe
[1:10:42] the next thing the preacher will tell
[1:10:44] you many you say these things you read
[1:10:45] the Bible they for another day we don't
[1:10:47] need it we don't need to practice those
[1:10:49] things Divine Healing we don't practice
[1:10:51] speaking in tongues in the church to
[1:10:52] keep our church straight we don't do
[1:10:54] this now let's continue a man can't
[1:10:59] understand why people shout a man can't
[1:11:01] understand why a human being's language
[1:11:03] would change and speak in tongue the
[1:11:06] natural man can't see how a glory of God
[1:11:09] could come over a man's eye and he sees
[1:11:11] vision and tell man certain things and
[1:11:13] what to do tell them things that are
[1:11:15] fixing to happen and things fixing to
[1:11:16] come to pass like the Lord did the
[1:11:19] natural mind trying to figure it out now
[1:11:22] to see and man speaking in tongues here
[1:11:25] we go and somebody interpret and tell
[1:11:29] just exactly to a certain member of the
[1:11:31] body what they have done and what they
[1:11:33] should not do this quote came from Kelly
[1:11:36] Shar this quot with me powerful so this
[1:11:39] is
[1:11:40] showing what the operation of the gifts
[1:11:42] is

[1:11:47] service somebody speaking tongues like

[1:11:59] know that there who speaking tongues and
[1:12:01] interpet knows nothing about that it's
[1:12:03] only God doing that do you understand
[1:12:06] that God is not coming down in a p of
[1:12:08] fire and speaking out of the pill of
[1:12:10] fire like it in the Old Testament in
[1:12:11] that way no he's using the
[1:12:13] gifts that is given by the spirit into
[1:12:17] the body he don't have to use the
[1:12:19] ministry be the pulpit they have tongues
[1:12:21] and interpretation of tongues for that

[1:16:23] and God hates that that is man on Parade
[1:16:27] God will get the glory from that you
[1:16:28] know and that's why God tell him tell
[1:16:31] them there too much of people
[1:16:33] here they go they go say by the power
[1:16:35] the might they get this Victory cut it
[1:16:38] down and that get Gideon 300 oh give the
[1:16:41] Lord some Praises because God wanton
[1:16:43] Glory big golad little David God get
[1:16:46] Glory I'll cut his head off Oh Glory to
[1:16:49] get God glory from that oh glory to God
[1:16:52] not getting Glory from our strength and
[1:16:53] our might our intellect that why Paul
[1:16:56] said I come among you with trembling oh
[1:16:58] that your faith will not rest oh in the
[1:17:00] knowledge that I have in my enticing
[1:17:03] speech and words but in the power of God
[1:17:06] glory to God so when Paul left there
[1:17:08] they know the power of God hit the place
[1:17:11] Dynamics and mechanics form and latter
[1:17:13] rain word and spirit that what Paul had
[1:17:16] glory to God and they knew the spirit
[1:17:18] was energizing the word they knew it
[1:17:20] wasn't the intellect of man they knew it
[1:17:23] was the power of
[1:17:24] God oh my hallelujah praise God Amen you
[1:17:28] believe it tonight all right let's go
[1:17:31] the scriptures cannot
[1:17:33] lie and there's no private
[1:17:35] interpretation the Bible said you just
[1:17:37] believe it the way it's written you've
[1:17:38] got to have these things and the only
[1:17:40] way you'll ever be able to have them is
[1:17:42] to have heaven born knowledge and heaven
[1:17:45] born knowledge will vindicate the word
[1:17:49] heaven born knowledge wouldn't explain
[1:17:51] it way with a different type
[1:17:53] Give an
[1:17:54] example years ago I met a sister or a
[1:17:56] sister I believe and and she was I
[1:18:00] sister to a brother can't remember
[1:18:01] exactly but she was talking about
[1:18:03] justification wood with m in it soon as
[1:18:05] she said that I no just going off
[1:18:08] because they know better than that but
[1:18:10] it's a type they want to use to show
[1:18:12] that is different from what in the books
[1:18:14] and they getting this thing so she say
[1:18:17] justification script of the Moss no
[1:18:19] justification pick up the word with moss
[1:18:21] in it sanctification script of the most
[1:18:23] and Holy Ghost shaped the
[1:18:26] wood I say but is the same
[1:18:28] wood the wood had changed is just SC M
[1:18:32] off and you do carving like them fellas
[1:18:35] and he block this carve stuff out the
[1:18:36] wood I said tell me what the prophet
[1:18:38] says justification you pick up a dirty
[1:18:40] glass satification you wash the glass
[1:18:43] Holy Ghost you pour milk into the glass
[1:18:45] I see a Fredy
[1:18:46] milk that's what they
[1:18:49] AF that milk is a new
[1:18:51] element that is the Holy Ghost to pour
[1:18:55] inside your glass you shaped the word
[1:18:57] the same old trining
[1:18:59] wood
[1:19:01] shaped and he pass like this because God
[1:19:04] shaping that man shaping that you that
[1:19:07] a't God shaping that at all all right so
[1:19:10] you've got to believe not make believe
[1:19:12] it but you got to say I watch now you
[1:19:15] got to believe not make believe it none
[1:19:17] of these make beliefs see if you say try
[1:19:19] to say I got it don't be a black bird
[1:19:21] putting on peak of feathers in yourself
[1:19:23] because they will fall out they are not
[1:19:25] naturally grown in there they are stuck
[1:19:29] in now there will be another thing on
[1:19:31] this knowledge we might speak of Godly
[1:19:33] knowledge has the Bible in this day lost
[1:19:35] its meaning a lot of people tell you
[1:19:37] that the Bible doesn't exactly mean that
[1:19:39] if God watches over me and corrects me
[1:19:42] in my sin and if I am a Son of God he
[1:19:45] does that he does you that way Sons and
[1:19:48] Daughters when you do anything wrong he
[1:19:50] corrects you then if God is so
[1:19:53] particular about you that he watches
[1:19:55] over you and corrects you how much more
[1:19:57] has he in his
[1:19:59] word in other words God who could
[1:20:02] correct us will guard this word to make
[1:20:06] sure it have no contradict treating in
[1:20:08] it in the beginning was the word and the
[1:20:11] Word was with God and the Word was God
[1:20:14] the word is the revelation of Jesus
[1:20:18] Christ that word saying again the word
[1:20:21] is the revelation of Jesus Christ the
[1:20:24] Bible said so Christ being revealed in
[1:20:27] his word and if he has watched over you
[1:20:30] when you transgress these laws he
[1:20:32] condemns you for it how much more has he
[1:20:34] watched over his law that condemns you
[1:20:36] amen I believe in genuine Holy Ghost
[1:20:39] knowledge Holy Ghost knowledge will
[1:20:42] always punctuate the word with
[1:20:47] amen hallelujah praise God oh let's
[1:20:51] continue let let's knowledge not worldly
[1:20:54] it's reasons any kind of knowledge
[1:20:56] worldly knowledge reasons but faith has
[1:20:58] no reasoning God reveals to you a
[1:21:02] certain thing is going to happen every
[1:21:04] scientist in the world will tell you
[1:21:05] it's contrary it could not happen you
[1:21:07] believe it anyhow see it doesn't reason
[1:21:09] the Bible said we cast down reasoning we
[1:21:11] don't reason with faith you know we come
[1:21:13] like come from Mexico um I was tired I
[1:21:17] kind of maybe sleep along and then get
[1:21:19] to the airport and by the time I get to
[1:21:21] the counter they say well the the door
[1:21:23] for taking luggage closed so now I have
[1:21:25] to go and stand by and I don't think I'm
[1:21:29] traveling since 982 I've never been on
[1:21:31] standby before this is the first time
[1:21:33] yeah I can't remember ever being on
[1:21:35] standby so I was supposed to leave on
[1:21:37] the morning flight and this now put me
[1:21:39] on the evening flight I said so what
[1:21:40] happen if I don't get on these flight
[1:21:41] evening time they say I keep coming back
[1:21:43] until until until and this is the end of
[1:21:46] the year everybody and the grandmother
[1:21:48] come in to come for Hest night everybody
[1:21:51] everybody so when I got to the airport
[1:21:54] now I prayed you know that because Lord
[1:21:56] I said Lord since in can since in in in
[1:21:58] Mexico I want to go home straight after
[1:22:00] last I want to go straight home I wish
[1:22:01] had a PL take me straight home one time
[1:22:04] um but I said Lord I really don't want
[1:22:06] to stay back here again you know so when
[1:22:09] I got to the airport now I seen 12
[1:22:11] people on standby now when I first check
[1:22:15] in the counter they say my name was
[1:22:16] first I was I was glad for that you know
[1:22:18] I have first choice and first
[1:22:20] opportunity when I got to the airport I
[1:22:21] see my name is for and there's a family
[1:22:24] of three same name in front of me so I
[1:22:27] see I'm fourth and then there are uh
[1:22:30] eight other people waiting for
[1:22:32] standby so they going in going in they
[1:22:35] say well cter close everything now so
[1:22:36] now they're dealing with the
[1:22:38] standby and in the meantime now I guess
[1:22:41] some level of unbelief start to hit me I
[1:22:44] said to check hotels now if I had to go
[1:22:45] to a hotel back to hotel and which I
[1:22:48] Repent afterwards of course I had to
[1:22:51] repent and uh there want to know what is
[1:22:54] happening so the man said I have two
[1:22:57] seats
[1:22:59] available so he turned to the woman was
[1:23:02] a family of three a woman and a son and
[1:23:04] daughter they were big children and said
[1:23:07] you'll have to split up only two could
[1:23:09] go two will go and one stay back and
[1:23:10] what and the woman
[1:23:12] said I can't split
[1:23:15] up and that is how I was able to get
[1:23:19] in I I was amazed
[1:23:23] I say that's like a miracle because if
[1:23:25] there was four different people in front
[1:23:26] there or three in front of me different
[1:23:28] people I couldn't go and come home when
[1:23:30] I when when I came but I stood there and
[1:23:33] watched a miracle happen in front of my
[1:23:34] eyes the woman said no I'm not going to
[1:23:37] split up
[1:23:39] I ready to go second to last person
[1:23:42] inside the plane that was that was close
[1:23:45] but then I learned something though
[1:23:47] unbelief doesn't hinder God and we have
[1:23:50] to believe him and trust him more I have
[1:23:53] to believe and trust him more we have to
[1:23:55] I mean we are challenge it was a
[1:23:57] challenge because this is not normal and
[1:24:00] my all all I wondering now is if my
[1:24:02] luggage will come with me I say I want
[1:24:05] what they had the luggage but now I have
[1:24:06] a kind of tag that I have in my suit
[1:24:08] case that I could find out which way it
[1:24:09] is when I got in the plane I check it
[1:24:12] luggage say it's right there on me the
[1:24:15] luggage right there say I said these
[1:24:16] people good they was they have standby
[1:24:18] waiting whoever gets stand by they to
[1:24:20] the luggage in so luggage coming with me
[1:24:22] felt good about that but it's showing
[1:24:25] you that in situations that come how we
[1:24:28] have to trust God and how God will make
[1:24:31] a way where it looks so impossible oh
[1:24:34] glory to God you're number four and you
[1:24:36] see only two seats remaining two seats
[1:24:38] have there and you still have to go
[1:24:40] because God Will Make A Way God ensure
[1:24:42] that that party in front they could make
[1:24:45] it and that made a way for me to make it
[1:24:47] blessed be the name of the Lord Give the
[1:24:49] Lord some Praises he would make a way
[1:24:51] for you
[1:24:53] Oh Glory to God hallelujah so it's not
[1:24:55] worldly knowledge it's Heavenly
[1:24:56] knowledge it's a spiritual knowledge of
[1:24:58] the word knowing what God Said do what
[1:25:01] God Said that is right now if somebody
[1:25:04] tells
[1:25:06] you I'm going to finish here all
[1:25:11] right oh no I know realize I'm now five
[1:25:15] out of 11 just 11 pages but I'm want
[1:25:18] five if somebody tries to tell you that
[1:25:21] the Bible has lost it power there's no
[1:25:23] such a thing as the baptism of the Holy
[1:25:26] Ghost don't add that
[1:25:30] am if somebody said he SE in his soul
[1:25:32] and you know I mean you can Bly ghost
[1:25:34] and and be lost there's no such thing
[1:25:38] as ask them if that baptism and his
[1:25:41] flesh and his soul and his Spirit where
[1:25:42] the baptism coming
[1:25:44] from all right so if there somebody said
[1:25:47] there's no such thing as Holy Ghost
[1:25:48] don't add that it won't work I said and
[1:25:51] Paul wasn't one of the 12 that was in
[1:25:53] the upper room and he had the gift of
[1:25:54] healing I said look at look at the gift
[1:25:56] of healing and Plum on 30 years later he
[1:25:58] was still in Corinthians ordaining the
[1:26:00] gift of healing into the body of Christ
[1:26:02] oh my but brandham said this now the
[1:26:05] bride if the bride in the beginning was
[1:26:08] the word or the bridegroom and if the
[1:26:11] bride is taken from the bridegroom it
[1:26:13] must be the word
[1:26:16] also the
[1:26:18] bridegroom watch why must the bridegroom
[1:26:21] be the word manifested made plain is
[1:26:23] because the bride and the bridegroom are
[1:26:24] one she is just a smitten piece off of
[1:26:27] him the Masterpiece it was smitten and
[1:26:31] God is going to do it he's going to
[1:26:33] bring this little bride that's smitten
[1:26:35] right back to the side of the original
[1:26:37] word I will restore sayeth the Lord all
[1:26:41] the years that the pmer and the can all
[1:26:43] these other things has eaten I'll
[1:26:45] restore again Malachi for said he
[1:26:48] restore the hearts of the children and
[1:26:49] the Fai of the people back to original
[1:26:50] fathers she is smitten from the church
[1:26:53] talk about the bride from the church
[1:26:55] body she is smitten with her master for
[1:26:57] the same purpose she is the word just as
[1:27:00] the same as Joseph was smitten from his
[1:27:02] Brethren because he was the word and
[1:27:04] Jesus was spitten from his Brethren
[1:27:06] because he was the word the bride is
[1:27:08] spinning from the church
[1:27:10] because she is the word the word living
[1:27:14] and in action the Bible bride not some
[1:27:18] man-made bride the Bible bride smitten
[1:27:21] and Afflicted of God no Beauty we should
[1:27:23] desire her yet we did esteem her smitten
[1:27:25] Afflicted of God she stands alone she is
[1:27:27] smitten from all denominations she is
[1:27:29] smitten out of L churches and she was
[1:27:32] raised up in this church was raised up
[1:27:33] in can't you Pentecostal man see that if
[1:27:37] that other talk had to die if the Tass
[1:27:39] die so much the H die stands alone like
[1:27:42] the bridegroom rejected of men despised
[1:27:45] rejected of the churches the bright
[1:27:47] stands as way I talk about the message
[1:27:48] churches yes
[1:27:50] sir will reject them the bride because
[1:27:53] the bride going to be the word
[1:27:55] manifested the word living not the word
[1:27:58] tested I know that's not a word but not
[1:28:01] the word in talk but the word manifested
[1:28:04] are you with me what is it the
[1:28:07] Masterpiece again see is the word that
[1:28:10] he can work through made manifest
[1:28:17] rejected so now we quoting quotes and
[1:28:20] prophesying accordion 101
[1:28:22] that's we do right now but it going to
[1:28:24] switch over Oh Glory to God hallelujah
[1:28:27] when John the Baptist came it was a sign
[1:28:30] that the Messiah was at hand we didn't
[1:28:32] know how long the Messiah was coming but
[1:28:34] John was preaching I'm cutting down a
[1:28:36] road I'm preparing a way for the Messiah
[1:28:38] to come the Messiah would be scriptures
[1:28:42] made manifest when Jesus came and they
[1:28:45] asked could somebody come and read he
[1:28:46] step up to read and say the spirit is
[1:28:48] upon me and say this this script
[1:28:50] fulfilled then he begin to manifest the
[1:28:51] word
[1:28:52] the bride will do the same the bride
[1:28:54] will pick up a scripture in r 27 the
[1:28:56] spirit and the bride say come because
[1:29:00] the bride will become the word that the
[1:29:01] spirit can mon the bride amen because
[1:29:03] the spirit will be rested upon the bride
[1:29:06] upon whom you see the spirit resting and
[1:29:07] remain that's the bride we're talking
[1:29:09] about the spirit will come down and
[1:29:10] remain and what Spirit about charity not
[1:29:13] brotherly kindness
[1:29:15] charity you could fail with that but
[1:29:17] charity never fail it charity comes down
[1:29:19] upon the bride the bond of perfectness
[1:29:22] the cement of love to seal the whole
[1:29:23] thing oh glory to God give the Lord a
[1:29:26] shout in the house hallelujah hallelujah
[1:29:29] hallelujah hallelujah and this is we got
[1:29:31] the title from now at the Harvest time
[1:29:35] I'm going to close the seed is back to
[1:29:37] its original life why why because the
[1:29:41] Original Seed went down and went to

[1:29:58] flowers and then you get a corn again in
[1:30:00] other words the seed go through
[1:30:01] processes and come back to seedall at
[1:30:03] Harvest time it's back to the original

[1:30:09] same thing give the Lord some Praises
[1:30:12] hallelujah hallelujah are you with me
[1:30:14] now at the harest time the seed is back
[1:30:17] to its original
[1:30:18] life back to the Bible I didn't say it
[1:30:21] he said it we have to go back to what
[1:30:24] back to the Bible back to the true
[1:30:26] Apostolic teaching Oh Glory to God
[1:30:29] hallelujah back to the apostolic faith
[1:30:32] back to the true Bible Spirit watch this
[1:30:35] now and watch something you must have
[1:30:38] all you must have all the will to be
[1:30:41] deceived so you cannot reject like how
[1:30:43] the Pentecost they believe the Bible hit
[1:30:45] the Malachi for they don't believe that
[1:30:47] they I send you letter the prophet the
[1:30:49] message they say they believe but AB
[1:30:50] Bram hit them the Thunders they pull off
[1:30:52] of
[1:30:54] that Thunders is Christ thing the mighty
[1:30:58] Angel open his mouth and Thunders went
[1:30:59] out to gather the bright together to
[1:31:01] give the bright Faith to show to prepare
[1:31:03] that's the Thunders is all about that's
[1:31:04] bright business so if they're not
[1:31:06] preaching the Thunders they're not
[1:31:07] preaching bright business they're
[1:31:08] preaching other
[1:31:10] things all right here we go God bless
[1:31:13] your heart this is Brother brand I don't
[1:31:14] believe I won't leave you in that
[1:31:16] condition I tell you what God Said but I
[1:31:19] will restore to you all that the coner
[1:31:22] had eaten all of the P had eaten all the
[1:31:25] P has eaten I will restore say the Lord
[1:31:27] so help me butam say I make this
[1:31:31] prophecy are you ready for the prophecy
[1:31:33] are you ready before the coming of the
[1:31:37] Lord the true Apostolic
[1:31:40] Faith the true Apostolic teaching the
[1:31:44] true Bible spirit it's on its road now
[1:31:49] trying to eat its way up and grow out
[1:31:51] again
[1:31:52] it's going to be restored oh give the
[1:31:54] Lord a shouting out that where I get a
[1:31:56] title from
[1:31:58] before the coming of the Lord it will
[1:32:01] have what what will it have the true
[1:32:02] Apostolic Faith the true Apostolic
[1:32:04] teaching the true Bible Spirit Oh Glory
[1:32:08] to God hallelujah then the Pentecostal
[1:32:11] had it to start with what did they do
[1:32:13] draw a little ring around it and begin
[1:32:14] to denominate watch they keep coming
[1:32:17] they want me that Lin outpour make an
[1:32:20] organization out of that they want me to
[1:32:22] come and join the assemblies I stood
[1:32:24] right in the midst of every Branch
[1:32:25] hanging out there and I saying this is
[1:32:28] the foundation cut off these Old Rag
[1:32:31] lines here so the life can get into you
[1:32:34] then you will have prophecies then
[1:32:36] you'll have discernment then you'll have
[1:32:38] the spirit then you'll have the power
[1:32:41] you'll have the restoration of the true
[1:32:42] church when you get back to the True
[1:32:44] Vine and the true life Oh Glory to God
[1:32:48] so the word become like a hull through
[1:32:50] which the spirit could go through
[1:32:52] so God couldn't let the spirit flow
[1:32:54] because the word was disconnected there
[1:32:56] was no channel of the word because the
[1:32:58] Lord was cut up in Seven Ages misplaced
[1:33:01] through Seven Ages divided through seven
[1:33:03] ages and brother Ram come like a plumber
[1:33:05] and connect all together and tie the
[1:33:08] word back together into the word that
[1:33:10] the the spirit now have a line to flow
[1:33:12] through and God take the word brother
[1:33:15] George and put it in men because the
[1:33:17] secret is the word is in the bride so he
[1:33:19] put it in men and begin to flow true the
[1:33:21] word in men that's the fold Ministry oh
[1:33:26] give the Lord a shout he put the pastor
[1:33:28] word in the pastor and flow through the
[1:33:30] word of the pastor and then you see the
[1:33:32] pastor in operation oh give the Lord
[1:33:35] some Praises do you understand that when
[1:33:38] he say I sat in the church pastor and
[1:33:40] teacher that's a word now Pastor is a
[1:33:42] word now that word comes into the man
[1:33:45] and God begin to go through that word so
[1:33:47] he's not using the man he using the word
[1:33:49] in the man the Pentecostal Hallelujah he
[1:33:52] was using the men and they were
[1:33:53] backsliding adultery fornication all
[1:33:55] kind of life but now he's not doing that
[1:33:57] he's doing the word in the man that's
[1:33:59] why when the word begin to work through
[1:34:00] the man it will be rejected oh give the
[1:34:03] Lord I shout that's Joseph Perfection
[1:34:06] the Capstone word rejected oh give the
[1:34:09] Lord a shout in the
[1:34:10] house oh Hallelujah that's the rainbow
[1:34:14] quote word
[1:34:20] rejected
[1:34:22] God bless you
[1:34:23] friends I know you think I'm a little
[1:34:25] bit
[1:34:25] noisy a little out of order but I'm not
[1:34:30] I think I'm in the order with this
[1:34:33] word the spirit of God is here the same
[1:34:37] spirit that wrote the Bible and if the
[1:34:39] spirit that wrote the Bible will say
[1:34:41] Amen every time the Bible word is spoke
[1:34:44] and if that is the true spirit of God
[1:34:46] then the true powers and manifestation
[1:34:48] of the spirit will manifest itself with
[1:34:51] this true spirit amen judge ye the word
[1:34:54] what you hear judge it by the Bible
[1:34:57] watch its
[1:34:59] actions watch its work I'm going to
[1:35:03] close please but Bram we will always
[1:35:07] judge you talk about uh I want to all
[1:35:13] right he said he says talk about a good
[1:35:16] thing for minister to follow right we
[1:35:18] have an order from God is for the
[1:35:19] Discerning of spirits
[1:35:22] and he said trying the spirit I believe
[1:35:25] that this is a very great lesson for the
[1:35:27] church is to try the spirit of
[1:35:31] anything
[1:35:33] of have discernment of spirit I do not
[1:35:36] think that we should ever by any means
[1:35:38] try to judge a person by the
[1:35:39] denomination they belong to or what
[1:35:41] group they assemble with whether they be
[1:35:44] Methodist Baptist Presbyterian
[1:35:45] Pentecostal we should never judge a man
[1:35:48] by the denomination that he belongs to
[1:35:50] they don't do that in the mage message
[1:35:52] they want to know where you going to
[1:35:53] church and based upon where you say go
[1:35:55] to church they have their own opinions
[1:35:57] they judg it by that he said don't do
[1:36:00] that do you hear that the prophet say
[1:36:04] here they not what they're doing but the
[1:36:06] prophet say here brother don't do that
[1:36:09] we should always judge him by the spirit
[1:36:13] he
[1:36:14] has don't judge them by what church you
[1:36:16] go to you know the pastor could be a
[1:36:18] rascal and a
[1:36:19] cook and a cuckoo
[1:36:22] no judge the person by the spirit that
[1:36:24] they
[1:36:25] have whether he's latter rain former
[1:36:28] rain inner rain outter rain nor rain
[1:36:30] Doctrine whatever it might be we should
[1:36:33] never judge him by that but by his
[1:36:36] Spirit we have to discern Spirits watch
[1:36:40] what the man has in mind what he's
[1:36:42] trying to achieve if the man by a gift
[1:36:45] no matter how great the gift is there
[1:36:47] are so many days things we liveing put
[1:36:49] the gifts so many people judge me by
[1:36:50] gifts that they have and I believe that
[1:36:52] these are gifts I believe what takes
[1:36:54] place god-given gifts now if we do not
[1:36:56] use them in the right way that God
[1:36:58] intended them to be used we do more harm
[1:37:00] with the gifts than we could if we had
[1:37:02] didn't have gifts the other night I made
[1:37:04] a statement at the pulpit saying I'd
[1:37:06] rather see Brotherly Love existing among
[1:37:08] the church if we didn't have one case of
[1:37:10] healing we must know what these things
[1:37:13] are for I rather have a church that so
[1:37:15] in love with each other and with Christ
[1:37:18] I rather have that than every spiritual
[1:37:20] gift of preach in the church now that
[1:37:22] might sound hard among a Pentecostal
[1:37:24] group where they are gifts they can fail
[1:37:26] where there are gifts there'll be in
[1:37:27] confusion where they are gifts they can
[1:37:28] be questioned where where there's love
[1:37:30] is perfect and if you have perfect love
[1:37:32] you would have perfect gifts oh that's
[1:37:36] beautiful so he's bringing it out of the
[1:37:38] Pentecostal realm and that the realm
[1:37:41] that God bringeth in the message after
[1:37:44] he set the five for Ministry he sets
[1:37:46] under there the gifts but that means
[1:37:48] charity is there then to govern the
[1:37:50] gifts so if you had perfect love Lov you
[1:37:54] would have perfect gifts so work with
[1:37:56] love Lov and that brings fellowship and
[1:37:59] fellowship bring gifts what brings
[1:38:02] Fellowship love what brings Fellowship
[1:38:05] not Doctrine
[1:38:07] love Doctrine do bring
[1:38:09] argument love brings real
[1:38:12] Fellowship now if a man comes at a great
[1:38:15] gift almost finished no matter if he
[1:38:17] belongs to our denomination another
[1:38:20] denomination don't judge him by the
[1:38:21] comes from how he dresses but what you
[1:38:23] want to see is what is he trying to do
[1:38:26] with that gift what's the purpose he has
[1:38:29] if he's trying to take his influence and
[1:38:31] build it and himself a great name out of
[1:38:33] it I have discernment of spirit to know
[1:38:35] that's wrong once you see flesh beef on
[1:38:38] Parade wrong no matter how great a
[1:38:41] teacher he is he know every mystery
[1:38:44] hidden Myster to that mystery and that
[1:38:48] com that he
[1:38:49] combo watch this now how powerful he is
[1:38:54] how intellectual he is how his gift
[1:38:56] operates if he isn't trying to achieve
[1:38:59] something for the benefit of the body of
[1:39:01] Christ your own personal discernment
[1:39:03] your own spiritual discernment would
[1:39:04] tell you that's wrong no matter how
[1:39:07] accurate the man on point take the point
[1:39:10] and put the point
[1:39:11] aside how perfect how it is it's wrong
[1:39:15] if it isn't used for the body of Jesus
[1:39:18] Christ so when you're here you see what
[1:39:20] we have
[1:39:23] trouble it doesn't have what we have and
[1:39:26] they don't have what we have it doesn't
[1:39:28] have that all right to achieve something
[1:39:31] almost done we are nine
[1:39:35] 11 maybe he's got a great gift that he
[1:39:37] could draw people together with great
[1:39:39] intellectual or spiritual power that
[1:39:42] could draw people together maybe he's
[1:39:44] trying to take that gift and make
[1:39:45] himself famous so you have a big name so
[1:39:47] others look up to him that say looking
[1:39:49] for the salute
[1:39:51] as some big person then that's
[1:39:53] wrong maybe he's trying to edify a
[1:39:56] certain thing here that he wants
[1:39:58] everybody else to get out of the picture
[1:40:01] and let him and his group be in the
[1:40:04] picture that is still wrong so trying to
[1:40:08] wipe out everybody else and say
[1:40:10] well a subtle thing to do you know paint
[1:40:13] that picture you know when you're
[1:40:14] painting the sa mind the says no we
[1:40:16] alone have
[1:40:16] it that is it how they deceived in their
[1:40:19] own head and mind
[1:40:21] if he has a gift of God and he's trying
[1:40:24] to edify the body of Christ then I don't
[1:40:26] care what he belongs to you are not
[1:40:29] Discerning the man you are Discerning
[1:40:31] the spirit the life that's in the man
[1:40:33] and that is what God told us to do not
[1:40:36] one time was we ever commissioned to
[1:40:38] discern the man's group but we are
[1:40:39] constrained and commanded by God to
[1:40:42] discern the spirit and the man what he's
[1:40:44] trying to do what the spirit in his life
[1:40:46] is trying to lead him and then we find
[1:40:48] we can find out what he's trying to lead
[1:40:49] the people not to break the them up but
[1:40:51] to bring them together to bring the
[1:40:54] Church of the Living God not all to one
[1:40:57] denomination but to an understanding a
[1:41:00] fellowship a Unity of spirit then if
[1:41:04] he's forar rine line whatever it is his
[1:41:06] spirit and his purpose is right and the
[1:41:08] spirit that's in him no matter what move
[1:41:10] he belongs to the spirit in him is
[1:41:13] trying to point the people to Calvary
[1:41:16] away from himself away from anything
[1:41:19] else and his only achievement he has is
[1:41:22] to point them to Calvary he doesn't care
[1:41:24] whether he is known or not oh give the
[1:41:27] Lord a servant Give the Lord a shout in
[1:41:29] the house glory to God neither would any
[1:41:34] servant of God take a gift of God try to
[1:41:36] glorify himself his right achievement is
[1:41:38] to do something to glorify
[1:41:41] God and if God has ordained you to do
[1:41:43] something then he's your protection
[1:41:45] he'll protect you if he sent you he will
