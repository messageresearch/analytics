[23:20] Here In Fear for as much here we go you
[23:24] know that you were not redeemed with
[23:26] corruptable things as silver and gold
[23:29] from your vain conversation received by
[23:31] the traditions of your fathers but with
[23:34] the precious blood of Christ as of a
[23:37] lamb without blemish without spot who
[23:40] verily was foreign before the foundation
[23:43] of the world that was manifesting these
[23:45] last times for you father God let's pray

[24:04] amplifier to T so brace up your minds be
[24:08] sober circumspect morally alert set your
[24:11] hope holy unchangeably on the grace
[24:14] Divine favor that is coming to you when
[24:17] Jesus Christ the Messiah is revealed
[24:19] live as children of obedience to God
[24:23] and hear this do not conform yourselves
[24:28] to the evil desires that govern you
[24:31] in your former ignorance
[24:33] when you did not know the requirements
[24:36] of the Gospel
[24:37] but as one who call you is Holy you
[24:40] yourselves also be holy in all your
[24:42] conduct and manner of living that's what

[24:48] conduct and manner of living for his
[24:51] written be holy you shall be holy for I
[24:53] am Holy
[24:54] and if you call upon him as your father
[24:57] who judges each one impartially
[25:00] according to what he does then you
[25:02] should conduct yourself with true
[25:04] reference throughout the time of your
[25:06] temporary residence on Earth
[25:10] weather long or short
[25:13] you must know or recognize that you were
[25:16] redeemed or ransomed from the useless
[25:19] footless way of living inherited by
[25:22] conditions from your forefathers not
[25:25] with corruptable things such as if and
[25:26] gold but you were purchased
[25:29] with the precious blood of Christ
[25:32] the Messiah like as of a sacrificial
[25:34] lamb without Flemish or spot it is true
[25:38] that he has chosen and forede and this
[25:41] time and foreknown for it before the
[25:44] foundation of the world for he was
[25:45] brought out the public view made
[25:47] manifest in these last days at the end
[25:50] of time for the sake of you
[25:52] so Christ's coming is for you
[25:55] to redeem you
[25:57] amen say love him tonight
[25:59] I wonder if everybody buyers want to
[26:00] look at it Leviticus chapter 25 want to
[26:03] read verse 8 and we want to read down
[26:04] from verse 8 Leviticus chapter 25 and
[26:07] though shall number seven Sabbath of
[26:08] years unto thee seven times seven years
[26:10] and the space of the seven sabbaths of
[26:13] years shall be unto thee 40 and 9 years
[26:16] then shout out caused the trumpet of the
[26:18] Jubilee to sound on the 10th day of the
[26:21] seventh month in the day of atonement
[26:22] shall you make the trumpet sound toward
[26:24] all your land you shall hallow the 50th
[26:27] year and Proclaim Liberty showed all the
[26:29] land unto all the inhabitants thereof it
[26:32] shall be a jubilee unto you and he shall
[26:34] return every man unto his possession and
[26:37] he shall return
[26:39] every man unto his family and after this
[26:41] verse here was 10 I took a title and he
[26:44] shall return every man unto his
[26:47] possession
[26:48] verse 11 Jubilee
[26:50] shall that 50th year be unto you he
[26:52] shall not so neither reap that which
[26:54] great of itself Lord gather The Grapes
[26:56] of it of divine undressed for it is a
[26:59] jubilee it shall be holy unto you he
[27:00] shall eat of the increased thereof out
[27:03] of the field and the year of this
[27:04] Jubilee He shall return every man unto
[27:07] his possession and if those cell ought
[27:10] unto thy neighbor and biased or alter
[27:13] thy neighbor's hand he shall not oppress
[27:15] one another
[27:16] according to the number of years shall
[27:18] the Jubilee shall go buy of thy neighbor
[27:20] and according number of years of the
[27:22] fruit she shall sell unto thee
[27:25] let me just skip them a little bit here
[27:26] now verse 19. all right let's skip a bit
[27:30] all right
[27:31] verse 20 and he shall say what shall we
[27:34] eat in the seventh year behold we shall
[27:35] not sow no guard in our crease verse 21
[27:38] then I will command my blessing is a
[27:41] commanded blessing I will command my
[27:43] blessings upon you in the sixth year it
[27:45] shall bring forth for three years you
[27:47] shall sow the eighth year eat of the old
[27:49] fruit until the ninth year until her
[27:52] fruits come in you shall eat of the old
[27:53] store the land shall not be sold forever
[27:56] so this is God's law right here listen
[27:59] carefully to this part you know the land
[28:02] shall not be sold forever for the land
[28:06] is mine
[28:07] for you are strangers and satinas with
[28:10] me and in all the land of your
[28:12] possession you shall Grant a Redemption
[28:15] for the land
[28:17] this is God's law he's presented to the
[28:19] people you know are you with me
[28:21] verse 25 If thy brother be waxing poor
[28:25] and had sold away some of his possession
[28:27] if any of you is a skin or family come
[28:30] to redeem it then shall he redeem that
[28:33] which his brother sold
[28:34] if the man have none to redeem it and
[28:37] himself be able to redeem it let him
[28:40] count the years of the seal thereof
[28:41] restored over plus unto the man to whom
[28:44] it has sold it that he may return it
[28:46] until his possession so if you could do
[28:48] it yourself you had a money to pay for
[28:49] your stuff your perfect you get back and
[28:51] stuff all right verse 20th and if he be
[28:54] not able to restore it to him then that
[28:57] which his soul shall remain in the hand
[28:59] of him that bought it until
[29:01] until the Year of Jubilee
[29:04] and in the Jubilee it shall go out
[29:07] and he shall return unto his possession
[29:11] so God lord definitively states that
[29:14] they could only keep it until he
[29:16] actually
[29:17] if there's no family to redeem it if you
[29:19] can't redeem it yourself when that
[29:20] Jubilee time comes it has to return back
[29:22] to your possession to inheritance
[29:26] all right let's continue
[29:30] and if he was not able to restore it to
[29:32] him
[29:33] verse 28 that which is soul shall remain
[29:36] in the hand of him that was bought it
[29:38] until the Year of Jubilee it shall be a
[29:41] jubilee it shall go out all right praise
[29:43] the Lord amen
[29:45] praise God
[29:48] and he shall return of this decision on
[29:51] this possession verse 29 if a man sell a
[29:54] dwelling house in a wall City then he
[29:56] will redeem it within a whole year after
[29:58] they sold within a full year may redeem
[30:00] it and if it is not redeemed within the
[30:03] space of a full year then the house that
[30:05] is in the world city shall be
[30:06] established forever to him that bought
[30:08] it toward all generations it shall not
[30:10] go out in the Jubilee that is property
[30:12] in world cities
[30:14] but the houses of The Villages which
[30:16] have no all around them shall be counted
[30:18] as the fields of the country
[30:20] they may be redeemed they shall goat in
[30:23] the Jubilee
[30:25] so isn't that something
[30:26] are we going to find out the prophet
[30:27] like that as well in them churches and
[30:30] Bong in them groups and tired but big
[30:31] walls all around them I don't really
[30:33] come in for them
[30:36] fully loaded all right okay
[30:41] revelation 5.
[30:43] saw a strong Angel Pokemon Lord Voice
[30:45] who is ready to open the book to Lucy
[30:46] thereof no man in Heaven and Earth under
[30:49] the Earth
[30:50] to look there on we say weep not the
[30:53] land of tribe but Judas prevailed to
[30:55] lose the Seven Seas is that right and
[30:56] then in the midst of the throne Comfort
[30:58] what a lamb sling
[31:00] blood bleeding to redeem you and I we
[31:04] know that right but all that Redemption
[31:07] plan all that burden sacrifice was to
[31:11] bring about the names that was in that
[31:13] book
[31:14] because your inheritance was in that
[31:16] book
[31:17] what you have to go back to his written
[31:18] in that book and we were waiting for
[31:20] that book to be unsealed that we could
[31:22] go back to get our Redemptive rights and
[31:25] go back to pick back up what Adam lost
[31:27] positionally
[31:30] and he was supposed to reproduce other
[31:32] Sons but because we fell and so long in
[31:34] the sex a humanistic realm in that sense
[31:37] then God had to come with a message you
[31:39] must be born again
[31:40] to bring us back by word and spirit
[31:42] back to full Redemption
[31:45] even the Redemption to with our
[31:46] Redemption of our bodies to bring us
[31:48] back to Eden so the object is to bring
[31:50] yourself straight back from where they
[31:52] fell from or give the Lord some praises
[31:55] Oh Glory to God so when the Angels were
[31:59] had flaming swords got in the tree of
[32:00] life to block Adam from his condition to
[32:04] partake of eternal life now the Angels
[32:06] trying to get us back
[32:07] because that tree of life is guarded it
[32:09] is still guided tonight
[32:11] that tree of life has to do with the
[32:13] altar that you have the life have to do
[32:15] with the presence oh glory to God
[32:17] hallelujah so God guards his presence
[32:19] and you have to be prepared to enter
[32:22] into presence okay the Lord send Praises
[32:24] nobody can just go there you know you
[32:26] have to be prepared to go into presence
[32:28] oh glory to God they were cherubims he
[32:32] said they were not men
[32:33] neither they were Angels they were not
[32:36] Angels they were cherubims we found them
[32:38] in the Old Testament with the ark we
[32:40] find them in the New Testament we fight
[32:42] him in the coming of the Lord cherubims
[32:44] guarding The Mercy Seat The Mercy Seat
[32:46] which no one could approach unless there
[32:49] was an atonement there for that person
[32:50] it was sprinkled with blood then it
[32:53] becomes a mercy seat it was a judgment
[32:54] seat actually but the Blood Naked The
[32:56] Mercy Seat so God sees it really a
[32:58] judgment seat but the Blood on the
[33:00] Judgment seat making some mercy seat and
[33:02] that is where we found Mercy all glory
[33:04] with blood on the Judgment seat or get
[33:06] the Lord some praises hallelujah
[33:08] hallelujah
[33:09] he said the Chairman's first mentioned
[33:11] was the East Gate of garden going four
[33:14] ways and the cherubims remember is
[33:16] cherubims and they were to guard the
[33:18] tree of life that was the god the way of
[33:22] the tree of life the way who is the way
[33:23] Jesus
[33:25] isn't that right
[33:26] now watch here now okay let's get down
[33:28] here now now you see these cherubims
[33:29] John saw
[33:31] they must be interested in keeping the
[33:33] Tree of Life he saw one face with a man
[33:35] of a of man face a man of an eagle a
[33:38] lion and so on right isn't that right
[33:40] praise God watch
[33:42] and I want to show you and make this
[33:45] show it's an altar
[33:46] this must have been an altar at the
[33:49] Garden of Eden I'll tell you why do you
[33:51] remember what Kieran Abel came here to
[33:53] worship so that shows that God's altar
[33:55] was moved and set here at the Garden of
[33:58] Eden and the only way back to Eden is by
[34:00] the altar
[34:02] so you see this lack of heart
[34:04] was it hard gospel
[34:07] heart stirring something wrong
[34:11] because the gospel have to bring it to
[34:12] the altar
[34:14] the gospel to bring in the presence and
[34:16] brother kangly what happened when Isaiah
[34:18] who was living on King uziah come into
[34:20] presence
[34:21] it showed up himself
[34:24] he could not talk about the other
[34:25] brethren Oh Praise he said woe is me
[34:29] for I am undone I am a man of unclean
[34:32] lips oh glory to God now who falls who
[34:35] is shocked off and this one off this one
[34:37] is not in the bride instead of nonsense
[34:39] praise God they have not come into
[34:40] presence
[34:42] the message world has not really come
[34:43] into presence yet because president
[34:45] trips you presence humble you presence
[34:49] bring it up to the Cross oh give the
[34:51] Lord some Praises Prime presence bring
[34:53] you down to the altar oh get the Lord
[34:56] some Praises real presence not feel good
[34:59] thing not bubble dancing real presence
[35:01] bring it on like John I felt as I fell
[35:04] as one dead like Daniel like amen like
[35:06] Paul all of them
[35:09] he said he was numb for days
[35:12] you say you know your blessings but you
[35:13] don't know what presence
[35:15] oh praise be to Jesus the only way back
[35:18] to eat it by the altar here you see it
[35:20] again back to Eden through the Altar and
[35:22] they were sent to God it until his order
[35:24] was covered blood he said oh God can
[35:26] people see it nothing but the blood
[35:28] there has to be an atonement a mercy
[35:31] seat there this altar of judgment must
[35:35] become a mercy seat and when this alt if
[35:38] the blood lifted they will stand on the
[35:40] Judgment Day the fire of God's Wrath to
[35:42] God the tree again the only thing will
[35:45] enter the Eden again will be through the
[35:46] blood of Jesus Christ oh praise God God
[35:49] in this gate King and Evil coming to
[35:51] worship
[35:52] so notice he said watch Cain went out
[35:55] from the presence of the Lord has a
[35:57] scripture you know Genesis 4 16 and Cain
[35:59] went out from the presence of the Lord
[36:01] and prevent a land of not he actually
[36:03] walked from the presence
[36:05] and dwell in London and become a
[36:07] scientist and make computer and chips
[36:09] and technology and everything else
[36:11] foreign
[36:16] they trust in science
[36:18] that is cane lineage with all this cell
[36:21] phone and technology and computer the
[36:23] bringing man to trust Chuck just science
[36:25] now they have full confidence that they
[36:27] could do it
[36:28] could do this they could do that all
[36:30] things are possible with them scientific
[36:31] brain and we come to say all things are
[36:33] possible to them that believe what God
[36:35] Said
[36:37] so because men pick up the tree of
[36:39] knowledge of Good and Evil be making
[36:41] electricity electric there's all kinds
[36:43] of things listen it in the last 15 years
[36:46] Things That Never Was has been
[36:49] in technology
[36:51] and the church still coming along
[36:53] well I hope that we do a make a
[36:56] revolution
[36:57] by believing and taking God out his word
[36:59] to know that God can't lie and there's
[37:02] gonna be a bright Revival there's going
[37:04] to be a super Church a super race as we
[37:06] hear the headstone you have to be
[37:08] convinced of that
[37:11] Glory
[37:12] listen man no believe they could do
[37:14] anything you know
[37:16] because of technology and the prophet
[37:18] had a vision before Jesus come again
[37:19] that they will reach where he saw he saw
[37:21] the car with no steering wheel
[37:24] and it was driving with a power and a
[37:26] force
[37:27] they have reached there he said science
[37:30] read so far they have breaking the cross
[37:31] Laboratory
[37:33] o praise God praise God so Kingman off
[37:35] from the presence of the Lord At the
[37:37] Gate of the garden so the presence of
[37:39] the Lord must have been at the altar
[37:41] and the altar was at the gate it is
[37:44] God's Dwelling Place
[37:46] presence of God is where
[37:49] at the altar hallelujah praise God and
[37:52] the devil will fight you from getting to
[37:53] the altar fighter at your home altar
[37:56] family altar any altar that God
[37:58] supposedly you're supposed to have never
[38:00] gonna fight you there because you know
[38:01] there is where you get in power that is
[38:03] where you get in strength that is where
[38:04] you're getting me anointing that's the
[38:05] way they gave God favor praise God
[38:07] praise God another songwriter say I want
[38:09] I want that kind of blessing that sees
[38:12] and keep and Satisfy My Soul when Jacob
[38:15] met the Lord upon that night Hallelujah
[38:18] wrestle alone
[38:20] oh hallelujah praise God praise God so
[38:23] hear this bomb he said so they were sent
[38:26] to God The Mercy Seat the god The Mercy
[38:29] Seat where God is in a Shekinah Glory
[38:31] where was it she kind of Glory at The
[38:33] Mercy Seat the god the Shekinah Glory
[38:37] then it goes to show that every
[38:40] scallywag
[38:42] can't commandeer and think of that
[38:45] you have got to be prepared before you
[38:49] come into the presence of it
[38:51] this of it is not an apostle this of it
[38:54] is not a Prophet this of it is not a
[38:57] picture or evangelist or pastor this is
[39:00] him
[39:04] so God shipped more there for 40 years
[39:06] and when Moses saw the burning bush and
[39:07] got there he said take off the shoes
[39:09] because that wronged his holy grounds I
[39:11] want to talk to you but first you have
[39:13] to recognize who I am
[39:14] and then you could reference my presence
[39:16] so when you go down to the people you
[39:18] know what you're talking about
[39:20] or give the Lord some Praises tonight
[39:22] Hallelujah and in type he said Aaron how
[39:26] do I start bells and pomegranate and
[39:28] everywhere he walked it played holy
[39:29] that's what that was the representation
[39:31] of the Bells and the pomegranate the
[39:32] playing holy holy unto the Lord he had
[39:34] to be Anointed with a certain oil
[39:35] perfume with a certain perfume made of
[39:37] the rules of sham and Jesus was the
[39:39] rules of shine is that right and the
[39:40] rules had to be crushed and then the
[39:42] perfume is squeeze on the rose and Jesus
[39:45] in his life was the most beautiful life
[39:47] ever lived but he couldn't remain that
[39:49] way because he had to anoint his church
[39:51] to approach his holiness
[39:54] oh that's why he was crushed yes he had
[39:57] to anoint his church that puts his
[39:58] Holiness so his life was squeezed out
[40:00] and the same
[40:02] Holy Ghost was upon Him is put upon the
[40:05] church and he makes him the same
[40:07] yesterday to them forever the rules of
[40:09] Sharon the perfume thereof the person
[40:12] that's approaching into the holies of
[40:13] holies has to be Anointed with the same
[40:16] Holy Spirit Oh Glory to God give the
[40:19] Lord some Praises tonight
[40:20] hallelujah praise God praise God praise
[40:23] God hallelujah hallelujah glory to God
[40:26] hallelujah glory to God Amen Hallelujah
[40:31] all right
[40:32] so therefore the mercy seat is in the
[40:34] heart the seat where The Shining forth
[40:36] of his glory in all of his children the
[40:38] Shekinah Glory in the human heart here's
[40:41] the human heart is that right is that
[40:42] The Mercy Seat how do you come true into
[40:45] that to these different systems through
[40:47] self-will
[40:48] self-will comes into tear true deer
[40:50] comes out what Shekinah Glory what is
[40:52] Shekinah Glory is God's presence how you
[40:54] get there you have to desire God's will
[40:57] desire God's plan when God take bomb the
[41:01] snake out of Peter's heart and he's
[41:02] sitting in the mercy see the throne into
[41:05] Peter's heart a nice a NASA safaricom
[41:08] line he said he enlighten me like holy
[41:10] ghost something Beyond Peter was
[41:11] operating to say you know what that
[41:14] that's not good
[41:16] you're dishonest
[41:17] and they were judging the church
[41:19] because they thought like brother Peter
[41:21] they'll see when God slipped down and
[41:22] said
[41:24] a throne was in Peter's acting
[41:27] pillar fire was hanging there
[41:30] and he said we'll have to come back
[41:31] again
[41:32] because why are we going back to the
[41:33] original faith of the fathers
[41:35] and the region of Faith was pillow fire
[41:37] veiled in the sons of God
[41:39] oh every devil in hell knew was the
[41:41] pillow fighting Saturday
[41:42] Peter I know he know they know because
[41:45] they've encountered it already
[41:47] or give the Lord some Praises glory to
[41:50] God hallelujah Glory
[41:53] all right here we go no one could stand
[41:56] the judgments of God
[41:58] only thing we can look for is Mercy not
[42:00] judgment
[42:01] we cannot approach his Justice
[42:04] he will have to keep his word
[42:07] and keeping his word the day you eat
[42:08] thereof that day you die who would want
[42:11] Justice I don't want Justice I call for
[42:13] mercy let the mercy of God The Mercy
[42:16] Seat sprinkled there was a time of the
[42:19] cleanses of the sanctuary when it was a
[42:21] judgment seat as long as blood was off
[42:23] the sea
[42:24] prophecy we are approaching that time
[42:26] now
[42:27] we are now approaching in this age a
[42:30] cleansing of the sanctuary and judgments
[42:33] coming upon the Earth as long as blood
[42:36] is there here we go listen to this
[42:38] as long as blood is still God cannot
[42:41] destroy the Earth
[42:44] as long as blood is there nobody is a
[42:47] sinner before God
[42:51] this is bigger
[42:53] do you get this
[42:55] as long as blood is there nobody is a
[42:59] sinner before God
[43:01] everybody is right because there's an
[43:04] atonement for everybody
[43:06] but if you fail to accept that atonement
[43:08] and go into his presence then you are
[43:11] sinner
[43:12] so when God look on the earth there's
[43:14] blood coming here
[43:15] everybody have an opportunity to access
[43:17] mercy and Grace because of the blood
[43:20] when somebody die and they go beyond
[43:22] that and they have not received that
[43:24] blood they have to be judged that is
[43:26] where they sin apart
[43:27] is made manifest do you get that now so
[43:31] the blood is speaking for everybody
[43:33] as long as your crossover
[43:37] unsafe
[43:40] let's read it again
[43:43] as long as the blood is dear
[43:47] nobody is a sinner before God
[43:49] everybody is right because there's an
[43:51] atonement for everybody
[43:53] but if you fail to accept that atonement
[43:56] and go into his presence then you are a
[43:59] sinner you are beyond that Mercy
[44:02] then you have judged yourself but know
[44:04] why there is Mercy when the cleanse of
[44:07] the sanctuary come blood goes off The
[44:08] Mercy Seat and then the wrath of God
[44:10] falls upon the Earth he say oh my
[44:13] God be merciful to us that we be not in
[44:16] that day form without the mercies of God
[44:18] o praise be to Jesus hallelujah
[44:21] hallelujah praise God
[44:24] Hallelujah

[52:42] will have a body like his a glorious
[52:45] glorified body
[52:47] and all trials and struggles of life
[52:49] will fade off into a little mist and
[52:51] will blow away never to be no more and
[52:54] these Earthly Tabernacles which we've
[52:56] now grown in we are waiting for that
[52:58] illness for the Salvation fully is in
[53:01] its fullness to come but knowing these
[53:04] Tabernacles of clay we have something
[53:06] that tells us that we have raised the
[53:08] fire so far what is the illness it's a
[53:10] little down payment that holds it or
[53:12] once we will love the things of the
[53:14] world once we sinned and went doing
[53:16] things of the world and cared not for
[53:18] God we were eliminated from him without
[53:19] god without Christ in the world and now
[53:21] God sent his Holy Spirit and through
[53:23] that we are lifted above these things
[53:25] now we have the illness and we know we
[53:28] are past some death until life I was
[53:30] trying to show you here's the ordinary
[53:31] sinner down here on the bottom now the
[53:33] Christian goes a lot hard on this he
[53:35] rises above that stuff that is the
[53:37] illness
[53:38] of salvation
[53:39] on this Earth with all kind of issues
[53:41] and gaity and play and what kind of
[53:43] thing like that God brings you up

[54:05] Resurrection
[54:06] now do you understand say amen he says
[54:09] say Amen what I mean by the earnest the
[54:11] consciously amen we know we have passed
[54:13] from Death until life because we are
[54:15] lifted up we are lifted up not in
[54:17] ourselves but lifted up from the things
[54:19] of the world and we love everybody oh
[54:22] there's a huge one but yeah imagine this
[54:24] message
[54:26] we know the people that love everybody
[54:28] they watch everybody stop talking to you
[54:31] they're crossing the street under any
[54:32] message Liars
[54:38] they are liars there's no messages
[54:49] so you could love me freely
[54:52] I available to be loved
[54:54] [Laughter]
[54:56] glory to God so watch
[54:58] we are lifted up not in ourselves but we
[55:01] live from the things of the world that
[55:02] we and we love everybody and God loves
[55:05] us
[55:06] and we know it
[55:09] and we watch our lives and see that is
[55:12] in the it is in the holy spirit because
[55:14] we don't no more care for the things of
[55:16] the world there you are as long as you
[55:19] love the world or the things of the
[55:20] world then the love of God's Not in you
[55:21] yet as long as you above that then you
[55:25] know you have an inheritance
[55:27] and you're on your way to full
[55:28] Redemption
[55:29] I could drop a bomb right here you know
[55:31] he said you are here what you are
[55:33] somewhere else
[55:35] yeah
[55:36] [Applause]
[55:37] so therefore as we get nearer we're
[55:39] supposed to be shaking of things as we
[55:41] get nearer to The Headstone that we said
[55:43] we get the bright get near The Headstone
[55:44] super Church super race as we near him
[55:47] so as we near him we are getting lighter
[55:49] not heavier with the things of the world
[55:51] not burdened down but cares as we go on
[55:53] approaching him we get enlightened light
[55:55] and lighter because we have to live here
[55:58] ready or not we have to live here
[56:00] hallelujah hallelujah praise God Amen
[56:03] all right now you see something that was
[56:07] lost
[56:08] that God has to redeem us what are we
[56:11] what are we redeemed from something we
[56:15] must have lost
[56:16] before you can be redeemed there must be
[56:20] something that redeem us back
[56:21] and all the inheritance that we had had
[56:24] been had to be redeemed back then we
[56:27] must have had something one time that we
[56:29] do not have now but this lamb come to
[56:32] redeem
[56:33] we had something we lost from now notice
[56:36] what did we lose
[56:37] it was given to Adam to have eternal
[56:40] life as long as they eat from the tree
[56:42] of life
[56:43] eternal life we notice again that Adam
[56:45] he inherited the Earth
[56:48] he was like amateur God over the Earth
[56:50] the Earth was his everything was given
[56:52] to his hand he could do whatever he
[56:54] wanted to he named it called it done
[56:56] whatever he wanted to he was truly a Son
[56:57] of God now in the fall Adam forfeit the
[57:00] title did to that
[57:03] so that is where the book comes now
[57:05] the authority
[57:07] do you see it
[57:09] and that is what the voice said who is
[57:11] willing to take the book because what
[57:13] you're doing now you're getting access
[57:15] to the deed
[57:16] the scriptural authority to run this
[57:19] water out
[57:21] nobody could run Satan out Satan didn't
[57:24] buy here you know
[57:25] he was kicked out and fell on the earth
[57:27] he has no deed for The Sinner he has no
[57:30] evidence to purchase you know he is an
[57:32] executive squatter on this land
[57:36] with him
[57:38] controlling the entire world let's read
[57:40] on watch this yeah this is good
[57:44] he said no Adam forfeit that tightly to
[57:46] that
[57:47] he forfeited to Satan Satan took the
[57:50] title deed Adam was thoughtful but he
[57:53] did not redeem his rights for he could
[57:55] not redeem his rights but Satan
[57:58] which does not rightfully own it
[58:02] but he possesses that
[58:04] foreign
[58:08] he is the God of this Earth
[58:11] the Bible said so
[58:13] he possesses that not because he really
[58:17] rightfully gets it but he possesses it
[58:19] now do you get it
[58:21] he's breaking it down now Satan
[58:23] possesses that
[58:25] he holds it into his hand
[58:28] debt is in his hand the Earth is in his
[58:32] hand the world belongs to him every
[58:36] nation belongs to him he governs and
[58:38] controls the whole world everything in
[58:41] the world Satan does
[58:46] you could pick which party you want
[58:49] as we see Satan only Democrats and
[58:52] Lucifer only Republicans
[58:56] that's what I'm saying then
[58:57] whichever you want
[59:00] say this again this is what's saying
[59:01] again
[59:02] Satan he holds it into his hands what in
[59:05] his hand death is in his hands
[59:08] Earth is in his hand the world belongs
[59:11] to him every nation belongs to him
[59:13] including Trinidad
[59:19] that's a lion
[59:21] that's the secret I don't talk about
[59:22] children especially
[59:24] Trinidad
[59:25] in case you didn't know now you know
[59:27] tonight
[59:30] all right he governs and control the
[59:32] whole world and everything in the world
[59:35] Satan does
[59:36] thank God we are not of the world
[59:38] no I don't mean the church he don't
[59:40] control the church he doesn't control
[59:42] the world
[59:43] talk about bright yourself because you
[59:44] never come to decision
[59:45] and brings a condemnity imagine on water
[59:48] and some crazy Force anointed once and
[59:51] so on all right
[59:53] they said he's a god of the world Jesus
[59:55] said he is the God of this Earth has
[59:57] blinded the eyes of the people the God
[1:00:01] of this Earth he's he God is the god of
[1:00:04] Heaven okay and he okay so Adam forfeit
[1:00:07] the title lead to it and we know what
[1:00:10] happened Satan couldn't hold the title
[1:00:11] lead so it went back in the hands of the
[1:00:13] original owner God himself and for
[1:00:18] hundreds of years nobody can access it
[1:00:20] because our price had to be paid
[1:00:22] so the only prophecy saying about lamb
[1:00:24] come and lamb come and lamb coming Abram
[1:00:26] Faith Isaac love Jacob Grace to
[1:00:27] Perfection profit after Prophet build a

[1:15:25] think and how to talk
[1:15:27] like your mind can be renewed if your
[1:15:29] mind no change due to change
[1:15:31] there are some people do accept

[1:15:52] you have to want to change what's that
[1:15:55] self-will I want the will of God
[1:15:58] foreign
[1:16:21] Still Waters He restored my soul he
[1:16:25] gives me the path of righteousness for
[1:16:27] his name's sake yeah though I walk
[1:16:29] through the valley of the son of No Evil
[1:16:33] and Joshua say they brought word as what
[1:16:37] I was in the heart
[1:16:39] I see yeah God you see what the people
[1:16:42] God has forced the issue what in the
[1:16:45] heart does come out all the all the
[1:16:47] front and the hard and facade and
[1:16:49] whatever they have in front of them
[1:16:50] pretending this I'm going to make sure
[1:16:52] what they had come out they have to
[1:16:55] bring with us in your heart that's why I
[1:16:57] praise God but I'm saying when you have
[1:16:58] sin or your field falling repent God
[1:17:00] unseat already he see what happens
[1:17:02] inside their heart they don't they ask
[1:17:03] God for his Mercy already oh glory to
[1:17:06] God let me see if we can wrap up here
[1:17:07] now but see me come
[1:17:12] here we go now
[1:17:16] so he just have to stop what he's doing
[1:17:18] go back to him hear this part
[1:17:20] he has a right to it
[1:17:24] so you cannot go and pray soon I pray if
[1:17:26] you're going to redeem now
[1:17:29] as a son
[1:17:30] your Redemption is to bring you back to
[1:17:32] what you lost
[1:17:34] so if you go back to sinner while you
[1:17:36] need to get saved
[1:17:38] but a random message was the message of
[1:17:40] salvation
[1:17:42] the message was a message of
[1:17:44] Redemption
[1:17:45] to restore you back to your inheritance
[1:17:49] that means you had it
[1:17:53] I don't want a bigger amen than that
[1:17:55] that means you had it
[1:17:57] you can't talk I am not worthy we're not
[1:17:59] talking that talk that's not the
[1:18:01] language of God
[1:18:03] that's not the language God wanted to
[1:18:05] talk I'm not worthy you know you're not
[1:18:07] worthy don't go there
[1:18:09] don't go there
[1:18:12] because where I go in here it doesn't
[1:18:13] connect with that
[1:18:15] let me read this back again
[1:18:17] if he was a Freeborn Israelite no matter
[1:18:21] who held the possession it had to go
[1:18:23] back to him free
[1:18:26] he didn't have to pay a thing he didn't
[1:18:28] have to do a thing just stop what he was
[1:18:31] doing and go back to his inheritance
[1:18:34] he had a right to it
[1:18:36] shout outright
[1:18:37] it was a god-given right
[1:18:41] do you know this Holy Ghost inheritance
[1:18:44] is your
[1:18:46] god-given right
[1:18:48] over here so I hear from your soul
[1:18:50] tonight I hear it from your heart
[1:18:52] tonight
[1:18:53] glory to God watch it was a god-giving
[1:18:57] right
[1:18:58] because he are you ready
[1:19:01] by Grace had inherited it
[1:19:06] this inheritance is not my works
[1:19:08] this inheritance is my grace
[1:19:11] he inherited it it should have been
[1:19:13] given to his fathers and had it on year
[1:19:15] after year no matter what taking place
[1:19:16] if he lost it it must go free it meant
[1:19:19] Grace
[1:19:20] is the way provided for each individual
[1:19:24] to return to their rightful inheritance
[1:19:29] that's why God put the claws of Jubilee
[1:19:31] in this whole thing
[1:19:33] so if the kage Kinsman brother or family
[1:19:36] yeah
[1:19:39] and you don't want to pay to restore you
[1:19:40] and the redeem you just just leave you
[1:19:43] alone
[1:19:43] Jubilee coming
[1:19:45] in making style beating money you're
[1:19:47] making style everything whatever you
[1:19:48] have leave him alone when you're Jubilee
[1:19:50] come you walk through at your property
[1:19:51] leave
[1:19:56] you have to leave
[1:19:58] [Applause]
[1:20:00] watch this what a picture give us
[1:20:02] tonight of the church in this last day
[1:20:04] you see what man can do and you see what
[1:20:07] God does What man does is feeling and
[1:20:10] will feel and us feel always will feel
[1:20:12] but what God does is eternal forever
[1:20:14] remains nothing can ever take it away
[1:20:16] God gives it it is his free gift and by
[1:20:19] suffering foresight so it and place it
[1:20:21] there is nothing can move it it is there
[1:20:23] eternally and the Jubilee was God's
[1:20:26] manner of expressing Grace to his people
[1:20:28] for restoring or brought back to the
[1:20:30] rightful position
[1:20:32] we need to go back to the power of God
[1:20:35] and something that can do the same thing
[1:20:37] today
[1:20:38] persecution always gives strength to the
[1:20:40] church we had it too easy we get
[1:20:43] thoughtful we get to a place where we
[1:20:45] don't want to move on it's just hand it
[1:20:48] to us it takes sorrow and tears and
[1:20:51] sweat and prayer and faith and promise
[1:20:55] to move forward in the power of the Holy
[1:20:56] Spirit
[1:20:57] [Applause]
[1:20:59] we're after them talking about in this
[1:21:01] message they have no Rapture to go
[1:21:02] through they
[1:21:10] rapture you could sleep pillow put it on
[1:21:13] the head and cover and put blindness
[1:21:15] over it
[1:21:17] you could plaster the horses plastic
[1:21:21] outside too tightly spoken books
[1:21:27] you know they take the Holy Ghost
[1:21:30] to take it up
[1:21:32] you have to be magnetized to the
[1:21:33] headstone
[1:21:35] to go in the rapture
[1:21:36] not so much I'm here sometimes who is
[1:21:38] that
[1:21:41] people people
[1:21:42] they're just dead stone Dead coming to
[1:21:44] church Walking Dead
[1:21:49] Living Dead
[1:21:55] we get Slot full we get to a place
[1:21:58] that's the entitlement part so some
[1:22:00] people they entitled in a message figure
[1:22:01] because they believe they deserve to go
[1:22:03] to Rapture so the fears are meriting
[1:22:05] they're not racism and they win against
[1:22:10] no it's not that
[1:22:12] he said we get to a place where we don't
[1:22:13] want to move on because everything is
[1:22:15] handed to us it takes sorrow
[1:22:18] and tears and sweat and prayer and faith
[1:22:23] and promise to move forward in the power
[1:22:26] of the holy spirit that seal and power
[1:22:29] that they had in those days has long
[1:22:31] time vanished from our assemblies I'm
[1:22:33] afraid if the windows are shuttle
[1:22:35] tonight people will run everywhere and
[1:22:37] never come back
[1:22:38] you talk more than damn days they were
[1:22:39] shooting some sisters praise and
[1:22:40] worshiping God and the bullets fall of
[1:22:42] their clothes
[1:22:43] not bullet spells yeah you know
[1:22:47] people again that shoot that under
[1:22:48] Fire
[1:22:50] oh here we go
[1:22:52] another thing is too bad to think of
[1:22:54] those things happening like that or yet
[1:22:56] it proves that God that was in the old
[1:22:59] days is still got today
[1:23:02] the God that was ever remains God expect
[1:23:05] his people to keep their vows and their
[1:23:08] promises but when we get everything so
[1:23:11] easy we just slip along
[1:23:13] and the first thing you know we gone out
[1:23:15] from these things losing our inheritance
[1:23:20] did you notice someone close
[1:23:23] did you notice
[1:23:25] that if a man bought a property property
[1:23:27] inside a walled City then he had wanted
[1:23:28] to redeem that back if he sold it and if
[1:23:31] he didn't redeem it back that property
[1:23:32] it was inside of the wall had to stay in
[1:23:34] there couldn't go free it was bound to
[1:23:37] stay there they were over the wall
[1:23:39] then he say what it is I'm so afraid of
[1:23:41] the things that we had in the beginning
[1:23:43] the old timers the world city I'm afraid
[1:23:45] that too many of us too many our
[1:23:47] Pentecostal people God has got walled
[1:23:49] into some denomination
[1:23:50] and will never hear the sound of the
[1:23:52] Jubilee never come again back to
[1:23:55] inheritance if this applied to the
[1:23:57] message some of them people can't even
[1:23:58] get to the inheritance
[1:24:00] any message but no inheritance they come
[1:24:02] out but they are going in
[1:24:05] do you see God bring out a Catholic
[1:24:07] Baptist Methodist Hindu Muslim whatever
[1:24:08] God call you out not to call you out
[1:24:11] Redemption is two parts come out to go
[1:24:13] in to go anywhere inheritance let's put
[1:24:17] it back in the Bible they came out of
[1:24:18] Egypt to go where into Canaan land what
[1:24:21] was that what was separating them from
[1:24:23] Jordan what Jordan represents that
[1:24:26] that across Jordan to go in the land and
[1:24:28] when they get Inland they have to fight
[1:24:30] to possess it and then they get the rest
[1:24:33] divided because the Joshua's comments
[1:24:35] mission was to take them over and give
[1:24:37] them their inheritance divide the people
[1:24:40] their portion after the fight not before
[1:24:42] you fight you're laughing and you're
[1:24:44] fighting and you're looking to get
[1:24:46] inheritance
[1:24:49] they're not gonna work
[1:24:50] it takes sweat prayer labor is that
[1:24:54] people like the community and in partner
[1:24:56] Victory part oh my Hallelujah
[1:24:58] remember the ones that was involved it
[1:25:02] never got to go free there were Bond
[1:25:04] slaves the rest of the time the owner
[1:25:06] owned them or if they had inheritance
[1:25:09] and the city that was Walden but outside
[1:25:10] little bitty cities I wasn't holding it
[1:25:13] was concerned like the planes now we
[1:25:15] find out that in these last days in our
[1:25:17] organization of Pentecost that we have
[1:25:18] come in and organized ourselves and
[1:25:20] rejected the leadership of the Holy
[1:25:22] Spirit by the wisdom of some groups of
[1:25:25] people
[1:25:27] instead of having fellowship with one
[1:25:29] another
[1:25:30] it divided us and separated us into
[1:25:34] several different organisms of people
[1:25:36] and in doing so it has broke up our
[1:25:38] inheritance
[1:25:40] that's how God interprets all these
[1:25:41] divisions all these bad seeds and
[1:25:43] ministers putting out to the people to
[1:25:44] fight this one and fight that one
[1:25:47] and they buy me past a fighter they're
[1:25:48] fighting on the government fighting the
[1:25:50] pastor and you say my people love to
[1:25:52] have it so
[1:25:55] all I know there's a requirement here to
[1:25:57] make that rapture there's a core
[1:25:59] requirement here to get prepared and
[1:26:01] nobody have the license on that
[1:26:04] requirement is right in the word
[1:26:06] everything for the bride to be made
[1:26:08] ready isn't the message
[1:26:09] Oh Glory to God and we have to fight to
[1:26:12] find it fight the preacher fighter get
[1:26:14] it
[1:26:17] come on
[1:26:18] [Applause]
[1:26:21] now these walls inside if we ever get
[1:26:23] walled into a place where we can't
[1:26:25] accept the word
[1:26:27] and the Holy Spirit and have to take
[1:26:28] Creeds and so forth of a church instead
[1:26:30] of the power of the Holy Spirit the
[1:26:32] Jubilee will never mean nothing to that
[1:26:33] person
[1:26:34] no matter how much you can say mother
[1:26:36] left you your inheritance daddy did that
[1:26:39] and you sold out and walled up and come
[1:26:41] into a Creed accept this Dogma that was
[1:26:43] injected into your fellowship instead of
[1:26:45] being free and in Christ and letting the
[1:26:47] Holy Spirit lead us
[1:26:50] now a man and his family could go back
[1:26:51] to the original inheritance if they
[1:26:53] could hear the Jubilee a trumpet song
[1:26:55] and the trumpet is the gospel
[1:26:57] and when they hear it they know what it
[1:26:59] means and they know that that's
[1:27:01] inheritance no matter where they lost
[1:27:03] how far they went back whatever they had
[1:27:05] to do they had the privilege to come and
[1:27:07] receive inheritance the whole family
[1:27:09] could come and receive their urgence I'm
[1:27:11] going to close with this
[1:27:14] so tonight
[1:27:17] so tonight men and women here of
[1:27:20] Louisiana
[1:27:21] that knows the things that we do know
[1:27:23] and have heard from our brothers and
[1:27:25] different ones of our Pentecostal
[1:27:26] experience of years ago
[1:27:28] and we have walled off we haven't walled
[1:27:30] ourselves away from it so far as we got
[1:27:33] to hear what somebody says instead of
[1:27:35] what thus say the Lord is
[1:27:37] no is the O of Jubilee
[1:27:40] I'm going to close to this
[1:27:42] come back to your original inheritance
[1:27:44] to a real Holy Ghost again
[1:27:48] you mean the real Holy Ghost yes is
[1:27:51] inheritance yes
[1:27:53] remember he can go free
[1:27:56] you didn't have to pay nothing
[1:27:57] and after do nothing just get up and go
[1:28:00] oh my my my
[1:28:04] the church knows like Israel the
[1:28:06] tradition like Israel when it come out
[1:28:08] of Egypt
[1:28:09] when Israel was done in Egypt God buys
[1:28:11] marvelous Grace without any organization
[1:28:12] he called Israel from his out of Egypt
[1:28:15] he called them to the inheritance hear
[1:28:17] this part
[1:28:18] Grace foolish I'm a prophet
[1:28:21] Grace give them a pillar of Fire Grace
[1:28:24] give them a lamb sacrificial lamb Grace
[1:28:26] give them power Grace give them
[1:28:28] Deliverance Grace give them Victory
[1:28:29] Grace give them all these things they
[1:28:32] dance in the spirit
[1:28:34] shouted praise God about it and little
[1:28:37] did they know
[1:28:38] when they were dancing on the banks of
[1:28:40] the Jordan
[1:28:42] 40 years away from the land
[1:28:44] there was there was about five days away
[1:28:47] but they make a mistake Exodus 19 where
[1:28:50] they accepted law instead of Grace
[1:28:52] remember it's been man's idea that's the
