delivered may deliver them this morning father those that are connected to us life make a presence reach out to them father and touch them in a special way may this be something special today in jesus name we ask it amen god bless you if you have your bibles i like to turn to three portions of scriptures this morning mark 16. we want to read from verse 9 to twenties in john 12 14. i want to read one verse jeffers 12 and hebrews 13. we want to read verse 8 and 9. thanks for coming out this morning we despite the weather you still made it out we are happy for you to be here we are glad to be back in church amen reading from said mark 16 verse nine now when jesus was written early the first day of the week he appeared first of mary magdalene out of whom he had cast seven devils and she went and told them that had been with him as they mourned unwept and they when they had heard that he was alive and had been seen of her believe not after that he appeared in another form on the two of them as they walked and went into the country and they went and told it unto the residue neither believed them afterward he appeared onto 11 as they started meet and upbraided them with their unbelief and the hardness of heart because they believed not them which had seen him after he was risen he said unto them go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature he doesn't believe it and his baptized shall be saved he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up separates and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on their sick and they shall recover so then after the lord had spoken unto them he was received upon to heaven and the heavens sat on the right hand of god and they went forth and preached everywhere the lord working with them and confirming the word with signs following it's in john 14 12. verily verily i say unto you he that believeth on me the works that i do shall we do also and greater works than these shall we do because i go unto my father our last scripture reading from hebrews 13 verse 8 and 9 it says jesus christ the same yesterday and today and forever be not carried about with divers and strange doctrines for it is a good thing that the heart be established with grace and not with meats which have not profited them that have been occupied therein may god bless his word you may be seated oh blessed be the name of the lord thank you jesus well you know we under type constraints so we just have to go straight into the word and i trust them that god will speak to your heart and inspire you amen i have a title this morning jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever i have an inspiration he did it before he can do it again god can't change god can't lie whatever he do before he could do again do you believe that let me say it's a different way whatever he did for others before he can you do for you today let me say it good for you whatever he did for others before he delivered others before he could deliver you he healed others before he could heal you he free others before he could free you he break the ban of wickedness and evil over others before he could break the bands of wickedness and evil over you he's the same yesterday today and forever we are served no old time god and he can't hear oh hallelujah he's the same yesterday today and forever are we going to prove that god he's the same deliverer he's the same healer he's the same baptizer oh glory to god he still healed cancer oh glory to god let me say that again he still healed cancer the can still walk the planet hallelujah and the scripture we read on the bible talk about an amplified verse nine of hebrews he said do not be carried about by different and varied and alien teachings for it is good for the heart to be established and ennobled easily amplified and strengthened by means of grace which is called favor and spiritual blessings are not to be devoted to things that bring no spiritual benefit and prophet to those who observe them oh praise the lord so we are the end time do you believe that of course we are the end time we are the end time everything is falling apart government's fallen apart and cohen and virus have them writing right in the position god want them everything had to be right in position god wanted to be so to show who is the boss who come in next what power coming next oh glory to god hallelujah praise god amen hallelujah we are the end time the seas are so numb the latter rain is fixed into comfort remember there will be such a denominational gathering pretty soon it will be terrific and they will bring themselves together into this freedoms of churches and this kind of church will be put out of operation as far as they know it's at that time jesus will appear and he will show which is bride and which is not remember christian friends i'm a man i can make mistakes you know many minutes just gotta say that because they think they're playing god i'm a man i can make mistakes but god being god cannot make a mistake all the words that have been written must be fulfilled jesus said so so we have got things here in the scripture that must be fulfilled and that is one of things this boycott to come so this boy could have to come you can't stop it but here we go but before this boycott come let me say good before this boycott can come of the marking of the beast there must be a seed sown for god to take a church out all glory to god before any drama outside oh hallelujah have to be a sea turn to take the church out i see the soul to take a church out that's why gosh and a prophet all glory to god that the secret could be the word is in the bride god put a seed inside of you the devil can't do anything about it it's already too late all glory to god you're pregnant with god i see you already inside of you oh give the lord a shout hallelujah hallelujah glory to god there got to be a bright seed under the nomination of seed to take on the form of the image unto the beast is that right now listen to this when i build this tabernacle the day i laid the cornerstone all day i remember that vision that morning god it wrote here in the cornerstone this is not your tabernacle do the work of an evangelist make full proof of your ministry he said i love it i love god's children everywhere i don't know where he's going to lead me i don't know i'm waiting is it prophet i've been waiting for a year i may wait for two years i may wait for three i don't know i don't know the next move i am waiting for it but i think according to the scripture listen this partner the word has been sold the next thing is the coming forth of the spirit not more word not more teaching hallelujah if the word is shown the next thing supposed to be the spirit or else could the bride be anointed when the spirit and the bride could say come oh hallelujah jesus returned in the power of the spirit took the scripture and find the place where it's written the spirit is upon me for he had anointed me to preach the jubilee and the song of trumpet that freedom time is here oh glory to god revival time is here healing time is here deliverance time is back here because he's the same yesterday today and forever so once the seed is sown the next thing is the spirit we believe that hallelujah glory billy graham has preached everywhere watch them godly men may preach everywhere the lords may send me to associate somewhere else some feel but i believe our nation is so dumb i believe she is ready for the harvest are you ready listen to these words now when the spirit falls not if not when what are you talking about it happened yet i don't care who that preacher that's the business but when what we're looking for when what we're looking for when would we probably sign a boat when what we came in for when were people laughing because we we stand here too long i am moving until this happened i stand right here you want a better preacher it has lots of them you want a better church go to them but you see here when okay the lord has showed them excited nobody could stop it not even chorus iris no devil no demon hell itself can't stop what god is about to do he said when the spirit falls it's gonna fall it will fall this morning it may fall on you all glory to god hallelujah when what if when when the spirit falls there will come a move amongst the people them the nominations will swing together just as certain as i'm standing in the pulpit and the church of god will be ousted and they will make such a racket today confederate it and put a boycott on anybody that do belong to them when will not happen when the spirit falls not before let me say it again not before hallelujah anybody tell before they're lying liars hallelujah this could only happen when the spirit falls you know why the boycott is a seed and the bride is a seed and every seed of the bigger after is kind when the rain falls oh give the lord a shout oh in the spirit praise god amen hallelujah so when the dynamics fall on you it will fall on them too because these are the seeds that the prophet planted isn't that right oh glory to god but it makes it takes later in to make the seas produce what it have to produce oh glory to god do you get that do you get the rain is written to bring up every single seed oh hallelujah oh glory to god so when that rain hit them so they have to they have to form the express they have to follow the boycott they have to do what they do isn't that right and when they rain and they can't help they can't help it because that's their seed and when the rain strikes us waiting for happening the blind have to see the must walk come on the death mask here oh glory to god we will have no control or give the lord a shout oh glory to god because that is our seed hallelujah glory to god hallelujah psalms 1 46 8 says the lord opening the eyes of the blind the lord raised them that are bowed on the lord loved the righteous isaiah 29 18 says and in that day shall the death hear the words of the book and the eyes of the blind shall see out of obscurity and out of darkness oh blessed be the name of the lord oh glory to god who honors his word god you are god this morning he's the same yesterday today and forever oh glory to god and he doesn't change his ways hallelujah he doesn't change his nature oh my hallelujah glory to god and since his genesis when god at the cut of adam for that filthy condition to partake of the tree of life he had to cut off adam from that tree unless he stand in that condition in an eternal state as such he cut him off from it but in this hour here that same god that cut adam from that tree is striving and pushing and pressing to get you back to that tree oh glory to god do you believe that that tree is the life tree the way of life and the prophet said i will tell you there have been an alternate guy now eden do you remember both king and abel come to worship so that shows that god's altar was moved and searched at the garden of eden and the only way back to eden is by the altar here you are again back to eden through the altar and they were to keep that way and guided that they couldn't get back there until this altar was covered with blood he said oh god i can't the people see it nothing but the blood god could only you his word god can't use your tears and you're feeling sorry for yourself he can only use the currency of fate and his word not your not your righteousness not your holiness not your purity that is filthiness sight but when that alters colored blood not your blood is the blood of the lamb his own blood who glory that god's spirit can bleed so the way that they become flesh spirit cannot bleed so the spirit all glory that god becomes word and the word become flesh and the flesh was crucified on calvary and when his blood was shed it paid the price it was a blood price to redeem us it was a black price to restore us it was a blood price to reconnect us and now this morning we are reconnected because we're going back to eden by the altar through the altar oh glory to god not by teachings but the teachings that pointing you to the altar where you could humble yourself and turn from your wicked ways hallelujah that he could come along and heal your land oh glory to god they landed a healing all about his desolation all about his business closing down all about these countries that are shut down it need a healing and the bride need a healing from all these filthy church wars and devil wars and demonic oppression and oppression was it coming because he promised to ride the israel once more it could be jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever oh glory to god hallelujah brother branham he's on the platform somebody's coming up listen to his words you have a christian spirit that's right not where you believe thick what do you believe thick you understand this mystery here tick no you say you have a christian spirit that's right no no no you could have been an atheist or infidel but as soon as you woke up i contacted your spirit and i seen you was a christian because it was welcome you see the holy spirit which now has me anointed in this word it verified that you are a believer you could fool people to die and you're dressed in your long dress in your long hair you can fool people all kind of thing but you can't fool god with your spirit that's why i keep trying to tell you you could hide on the teachings on the mysteries on the mighty so-called men of god you could hide and church under all of that but you can't hide under the spirit [Music] [Applause] because the spirit is a word and the word is the spirit and the word discern the thoughts and intents of the heart let me read about it you see the holy spirit which now has me anointed in this word it verified that you are a believer if it wouldn't you would have stood off from me but i know you are christian and that's a miracle in itself cause you could have slipped up here as a unbeliever or skeptic but what i mean but the holy spirit knows who you are oh glory my god we can go home right now oh glory to god you don't try to impress me forget it oh glory to god you're not here to impress no man you're not yet to please no man you have a holy spirit to deal with when a nas and the fire came in a church lying they thought they was lying to a man but the holy ghost was upon that man oh glory to god called peter he said you lied to me you lied to the holy ghost and they packed them out oh glory to god what was happening peter had no control to what the holy ghost was going to be doing oh give the lord a shout you see what's coming the prophet prophesied it will come back to that [Applause] [Music] get right with god amen now a minister cannot be a revival there's no preacher can bring a revival he doesn't pack it with him and the only thing he can do is just be loyal to god and to his word the revival has to come by the people has to come by who shout out people that's about you and that's why i said last week the fifo ministries for the perfecting of the saints not the glorification of no man there no pulpit not to make no man no message pope not to hold some man up in some atmosphere up somewhere god is the god of the audience oh glory to god in the beginning they take god from the people and put it on a man god want to take it from man and put it on you oh give the lord a shout take it from christ all that was in god he poured into christ all i was in christ he pours into the church [Music] oh glory god you know why people follow false doctrine because man make it that's why a man said boy last night somebody opened up to me i went open them and check anybody nothing in the world and people like that because they might bring that you can't find that nowhere at all in the world nowhere but they like it it's only good but you see what god said that must be a wonder you know oh because god said so amen so praise god so but abraham say here if god promised a revival here you're going to have it let's make ready for it go pro to heal let's mix ready for it jesus said the works that i do shall you do also let makes ready for it you see the script i read this morning it's in john 14 12 the same works i do shall you do i believe that i'm making ready for it i come to see that this morning says we would see jesus oh glory to god we will see the operation of the spirit you have to start you know think about it i want you to think about that now it has to start you know for three four hundred years no prophet in the land just a bunch of priesthood long nice hats and customized costumes hallelujah i enjoyed about this come with a rough time not one single sign not one wonder but don't stumble them with words repent for the kingdom of heaven repent there is one coming after me oh god whose shoes i'm not ready to loose he gonna baptize you not in water like i am doing but the fire he's coming he's coming he's coming he's coming that was your message prepare prepare people he is coming i don't know when i don't know how but i know he's coming oh glory to god and when jesus time came the holy spirit said jesus go down now oh glory to god and jesus up in land and he said behold the lamb of god to take away the sins of the world jesus had come to just heal the sick and raise the dead and cast our devils and multiply bread he come to take away the sins of the world if the devil only knew what he really come to do the devil was going to ease him lambda always and tell him don't go to calvary but the devil was clueless oh glory to god he came to pay a price oh they had to crucify him they couldn't help themselves the price had to be offered judas was handpicked to be part of the church do you have to sell him out to go to the crossbar when he caught on the cross he said it's finished the mighty conqueror oh i feel good this morning i can finish right here right now that's why i said we don't need two hours five minutes in the presence of the pillow fire oh glory to god hallelujah when jesus said it is finished he knew his spirit would be released and go on to the earth and the devil is finished when the spirit got inherited or if you get a cut of that spirit therefore you couldn't come because no man can come accept accept accept accept accept you couldn't come accept a greater higher power draw you no god enjoy you to be subject to some man and subject to some kind of system and some kind of priesthood god called you to be empowered i want you a bigger human than that [Applause] i sought out access to the father you know my son could go home and knock on daddy door any day you know my son could ask what you will anytime you know oh glory to god you don't ask permission to be your son you know you are born a son you know no devil cat cancer oh glory to god as many oh glory to god as many as receive him all glory to god to them to them to them to them to damn me power to become the sons of god don't you not church man buying you oh glory to god no pastor man no bishop man no apostle man no prophet man no evangelist man bang you from becoming what god ordained for you [Music] [Applause] [Music] as long as god gave me breath and strength i would blast the spirit of man because the but i'm saying the bride will not be manhandled no matter what be upon the right hand jesus written two thousand years almost yes he waiting to get this wife the lord himself he said from heaven with a shout to get this pride he gonna let some man come and interrupt that he go blow oh glory to god give the lord a shout [Applause] [Music] don't be fooled the same god that put men in power that's take them out of power let me say it again good the same god that put men in power does take them out of power god when israel asked for a king god go tell samuel they're rejected you know with me the walking are getting king he sent soul to samuel arranged it that soul will meet samuel and when samuel saw us at a walk show god tells us all samuel that's the man to rule for my people are they ma'am but when the time and come go find a better man god always give a better man you know you know what he after perfect man i'm not hearing you i'm not hearing you we're not living in luther's age or wesley age we're living in this age where perfection is required too much let me let me head over here hallelujah my god this one thing i hate which is the deeds of the nicoletan i also hate that the true vine hated the formal deeds of the nicolaitans and so did god what was the deeds of the ephesians church and the church of ephesians became a doctrine in the pokemon church and ever since the first church it was a d next become a doctrine what was it then he broke it down nicolette and come from the word nico which means to conquer or overthrow lee turns the lady now watch you know i read this many times but this time i drive with a shloka so i was always examining every word and when you slow down you see a little more than when you zoop and tell me i'm reading bible we need soup and we're just going through i'm just hitting it so but when you slow down you recognize it have more to it than meets the eye so when i drive in slow they won't pick up here now god had pastors okay nikolas i mean over to conclude which they were trying to do they was trying to take the church where god had pastors and the spirit of god moving so not moving moving by gifts in the church of the living god and they were having a doctrine that start that they were going to have some priests and bishops and popes and god said he hated it nicoletanes means to overthrow the laity to conquer the laity in other words take all the sacredness all the power from the church and put it on the priest if that happened now i don't know what happened because right now that would have a holy order let the congregation live any way they want to but the priest is the holy one taking this is taking the holy ghost away from the people with signs wonders following them take that away and give them a holy priesthood and i will add a holy priesthood bringing mysteries nothing wrong with preaching mysteries you know but these signs shall we follow not preachers not bishops them that's you them that believe you don't have to ask permission to be a believer not even you are the believer the believer is the word in you who give the lord a shout [Applause] so they were taken away the holy ghost and swapping it for a priesthood hallelujah who is who in the world is the head of god's church but him himself he said who is happy religious the holy ghost was sent to rule the church not just the preacher the whole congregation just the preacher be holy no it's all the church has to have the holy ghost oh give the lord some praises glory hallelujah so paul's wolves he said after my departing worlds will come in paul wolves he said has become the nicolaitan they were trying to form a priesthood like a levitical priesthood which was foreign to the new testament doctrine remember the new testament doctrine the new testament they went to the jew the gentiles the genders have not do with the physical priesthood that's a jewish thing they're trying to bring back this special man after holy temple that why when he veiled when jesus died he failed remember he talked about because there's one man going inside there and coming out he's a special man holy congregation happy glory hallelujah we forgive for a year but when jesus busts our view from the top to the bottom he's showing that you as a priest you yourself could go inside yourself and be a partaker of this glory you're not leaving you're dry you're not leaving you're dead you're leaving here with something you're leaving here with unction inspiration the anointing the presence of god oh hallelujah praise god oh give the lord a shout no wonder you can have a revival in your house no wonder you're going to bring a revival oh glory to god because the anointing the fire going to be in your heart it will be in your home it will be in your house you're going to run them devils right now endeavors beginning to pack up a shop they're preparing to leave right now oh glory to god them devils inside your house they're making preparation to get out because you're going back anointed or give the lord a praise [Music] hallelujah take the holy ghost out of leader and give them a holy order amen so the church has to hear from some man in in england somewhere or america somewhere or south africa or somewhere i hear from some man he's pope running churches and then they take the title self-appointed apostles are you playing paul but obama is our paul hallelujah i say that before i say it again it have no paul it have no man between the prophet and the brother jesus christ of a ministry that is right under there a fightful ministry men that god raised up everywhere around the world to pump that word to get it inside the bride because we can't produce it is god have to do it all he goes go into every creature and preach the gospel like not bad news that good news you should be shouting praise any god because that would be called the preach the gospel to every creature preachers of the bull preachers of the bees preachers of the sea every every every priesthood so he said no watch because he's supposed to be the general overseer the archbishop of the pope he works with each individual not an organization but a person false revelation not with the word and call them liars false apostles false prophet but the true church here we go held on to the original teaching of sin paul and the baptism of the holy ghost with signs following and confirming the word no glory to god we want the holy ghost whip signs follow him the lord himself went everywhere with them confirming the word we say we preaching the word he confirming the word with science with wonders not with miracles not whether ambulance outside they can take people to the hospital with signs come on now give me a show with wonders the way of god is holiness let this be known to every member here of the body of christ until you live a holy life god refuses your sacrifice the sacrifice must be offered with holy hands the high priest before he could even come to offer the sacrifice he had to be holy and dedicated and anointed and perfumed and everything else before he could even walk in the presence of that sacrifice how can you go out there and cheat and steal and fuss and fight with your neighbor and everything else and carrying away you do and then come and say oh lord hallelujah praise jesus he said i see them speaking tongues that still don't mean they got the holy ghost i hear them shout that still don't mean they got the holy ghost the holy ghost is the life somebody claiming i am the holy ghost i am holy spirit liars with no life with no lies liars never give me priests all right oh glory to god let's continue what about the key given to me of the lord whereby i was able to determine the messenger for each age is a more scriptural one in fact it might be called the keystone of the bible it is the revelation that god never changes and that his ways are unchangeable as he is in hebrews 38 and that's where we get it from it says jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever oh hallelujah here it is and on changing god with unchanging ways what he did at the first he would have to keep on doing until it's done for the last he done it before he has to do it again he have to do it must must oh god must you're going to be healed oh glory to god you're going to be delivered he did it before he can do it again fire will break up on your soul he did it before he gonna do it again oh glory to god he came to set the captain free because he said the spirit is upon me oh glorious spirit at the confess oh give the lord a shout hallelujah hallelujah glory to god amen we know exactly from the word which was recorded by the holy spirit how the original church was founded how god manifests himself to her the word can't change because the word is god thus the church was at pentecost is the standard that is the pattern there is no other pattern no matter what the scholars say no matter what the people are preaching the message say when you have the seed you have the holy ghost and you have this and you have that don't know what they say what they had on pentecost was the pattern [Applause] the prophet talked about um philip and and different ones when they saw the lighted quicken them and they started to follow jesus peter heard it quickly and he followed jesus mary heard it quicken and follow jesus but all them who get quitting have to go in the upper room are not hearing you i'm not here with you mary said be it done unto me yeah call it that i would she said i will grow up a room because up there is the power somebody said power not blessing power not anointing they had that [Applause] power out of his belly out of his belly out of his belly shall flow shall flow shine flow shine flow rivers of living water oh god i locked it i locked him i can't get out of this he not believe it on me as the scripture had said out of his belly shall flow rivers this picky of the spirit that they shall receive for their spirit was not that given yet was prophecy coming to them oh glory hallelujah my god as long as men are being called and sent forth with the word of life there's an apostle going on going on oh my hallelujah oh glory to god i love this part here what the church had at pentecost is her inalienable right originally she had the pure word of god she had the power of the spirit manifested in diverse signs wonders because holy ghost the children church was never organized by men it was led by the holy ghost it wasn't big it was hated on the spines it was oppressed it was persecuted unto death but it was true to god it stayed with the oceanal pattern so this keystone people stating it is the capstone ministry in mechanics and dynamics to prove he's the same yesterday today and forever we have to prove it we can't just talk that we have to prove he's the same remember the kangaroos have to be proven and to prove that it will take the capstone ministry of jesus christ which is dynamics and mechanics together all glory to god to prove it on the spot that's why i say which man on it could say sylvan gold her line on such as i have i give it unto you peter had it we have to have that same thing oh glory to god hallelujah my my my my my oh glory to god theatre noah shortly the original church at pentecost wrecked the power of god not with a bunch of intellectuals no with the power of god mark 16 action is the true church jesus claims as his own all else is false all is his fault all is is false hallelujah christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of acts not a book of explanations it's the book of acts it's the acts of the holy ghost foreclosure god hallelujah hallelujah glory to god hallelujah hallelujah praise god the book of revelation shows how the antichrist spirit would come into the church defiling it making it look warm formal and powerless it exposes satan he fights that he cannot stand he knows that's what the devil knew if the people get the true revelation of the true church and god help us we got it we caught it that's why we cannot be deceived no man can brainwash us no man come and teach us no man can i explain away by mysteries and by teaching this thing you can't [Applause] too late we heard from this son of man we don't need from another man let me say it again we heard from the son of man we have the words of the son of man we don't even need the words of other men we have the words of the son of man which is jesus christ the god prophet [Applause] oh glory to god i'm inspired i let me tell it to your face i'm anointed you out there looking criticizing fight that oh glory to god fight that oh glory we are about to get started this is the ministry about to get started we started with hebrews 13 jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever [Applause] glory the god [Applause] the true church will have the very same spirit and word acts of power that they had at pentecost by experience it will be a pentecostal church so that's the type no no that church yeah begging them for you amen begging them to raise the hand of the residents so not that kind of thing you know no no no no no he said there will be tongues there will be interpretations there will be prophecies there will be healings god will be in the midst of her god will declare himself in the midst of her as he always has oh glory to god the shout of the king will be in the camp whoa turn that in for a rocking the whirling for a rocket when hebrews 38 began to be declared oh glory to god let me wrap up here we shall come up please isaiah 21 isaiah 35 the bible said the wilderness and the solitary place shall be glad for them and the desert shall rejoice and bless them as the rose and they shall bless them abundantly and rejoice even with joy and singing the glory of lebanon shall be given unto it the excellency of carmel and sharon they shall see the glory of the lord and the excellency of our god strengthen you the weak hands confirm the feeble needs say at the danger of fearful heart be strong fear not behold your god will come with vengeance even god would recompense he will come and save you then the eyes of the blind shall be opened the earth of the death shall be unstopped then they shall the lame man shall leave as a heart and the tongue of the dumb seeing floyd in the wilderness shall waters break out and streams in the desert and the patch gong shall become a pool under thirsty land springs of water in the habitat of dragon where eastlake shall be grass and breeze and rushes and the highway shall be there are no way and a circle will call the way of holiness you may be seated the unclean shall not pass over it shall be for those that we fear in men the fool shall not adiren oh my the token has got to be applied and displayed oh let's wrap up here my his debt didn't stop him jesus that didn't stop him he returned again not a third person but the same person return again in the form of the holy ghost to continue the work and it continues on the book of accept jesus christ the same yesterday and forever that's the token the token was not just there applied it had to be on display you have to see it manifested oh my hallelujah [Music] they could display the token hey why because the same spirit that was upon him before his crucifixion was upon them after the resurrection and the holy ghost is a token that the blood has been applied because it follows the blood here we go all the way from the book of redemption so when the blood from the book is preached let me say this when the true word is preached it's the blood and the holy ghost follows the blood from the book oh my i'm gonna finish here the children of the kingdom they must be the word of god manifested for the promised seed of that age that's them he said what we need is the same spirit you can keep on playing he's the same but we need the same spirit that give it to teach it to us how we need a spirit the revelation by the spirit listen to these words how we need the revelation by the spirit we don't need a new bible we don't need a new translation though some are very good i am not against them but we need the revelation of the spirit and thank god we can have what we need for god wants to reveal his word to us by his spirit may god begin by his spirit to give us continuous life-giving and prevailing revelation oh if the
