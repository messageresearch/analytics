talk in the body atmosphere coming into the spirit of the comment of the Lord enjoyed this special from Berlin Judea praise the Lord would you be ready I'm the girl ready isn't that right when the Son of man cometh shall define feet on the earth I would men come and corrupt the prophecy of the fulfillment of what Malachi walk him to do because William Brennan didn't come to send books and tapes sorry that was not the commission that I read in Malachi 4 no no Elijah was sent to turn our hearts back to the faith of the fathers Elijah wasn't sent to distribute books and tapes and possibly plain books on tapes no Elijah was sent to do a specific work to turn our hearts back to the fate of the fathers when that is done then we can say this is that that the Prophet William Branham speaker not all these churches not all these things know this is that when what we don't know this is that when our hearts I literally back to the faith of the fathers which is a manifested word not just a talking not such as an explanation but a manifested word a real living reality that you know God is not dead he's a saint pillar of fire that came not among China he the same pure fire that came not on the upper room and he's the same pillar of fire not gonna come up on your life this is your promise this is your inheritance this is your portion Oh glory to God is obligated to manifest that fire to you okay the loss of praises [Applause] hallelujah do the hurts back to the feet of the fathers Alleluia Jesus asks a question when the Son of Man comment comment not revealed comment shall we find fit on here and fit I let me say this way is God's currency that's the only thing you could use the britches there are some dollars there weren't nothing in China that if you bring it and presented not evilly bunching and changing it because it have no value in our country isn't that right so therefore in God's country in God's kingdom there's a currency that has value that they have to cash it they have to change it they can take that currency and your sickness thinner to healing your being bong Attila to free your planet in in the sea the definite dinner here with that currency they have to give you what you asked for with that currency you cannot be denied without currency angels are dispatched because that currency or you don't kill me is on display or get a lot some praises people

one we want to read want to eat there and then in second Peter chapter one want to read those sixteen to twenty twenty-one a man but first we'll read from Acts chapter 1 he-man god bless you on the Internet preschool and all of our online friends they may please God reading from Acts chapter 1 and verse 1 says the former treaties have I made all Theophilus of all that Jesus began both to do and teach until the day in which he was taken up after that he through the Holy Ghost had given Commandments unto the Apostles whom he had chosen and whom also he showed himself alive after his passion by many infallible proofs being seen of them forty days and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God and being assembled together with them commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem in other words don't leave this place but wait for the promise of the Father which saith he ye have heard of me for John truly baptized with water but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days hence when they therefore will come together they ask of him saying Lord will thou at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel and he said unto them it is not for you to know the times or the seasons which the father had put in his own power but he shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost is come upon him and he shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and in Samaria and unto the uttermost part of the earth amen and now turning over to 2nd Peter 2nd Peter chapter 1 amen and verse 16 second Peter 1 this chapter one and verse 16 says for we have not followed cunningly devised fables when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ but will I witness is of His Majesty for he received from God the Father honor and glory when there came such a voice from to him from the excellent glory this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased and this voice which came from heaven we heard when we were with him in the holy mount and we have also a more sure word of prophecy whereunto you do well that you take heed as unto a light that shine it in a dark place until the day dawn and the day star arise in your hearts knowing this first that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation for the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost may God a blessing to ring of his word email alysha's power here as we pray Heavenly Father Lord it's a privilege to be in our house this morning father Lord we is so thankful and so grateful Lord father that you've called us out Lord Lord from all walks of life as it was Lord Father Lord you've put your your word in our hearts Lord Father feet and us Lord father to receive you Lord Father

word and my subject he showed himself alive amen amen by many infallible proofs that he is gone and he changes not isn't that right and my inspiration is God is his own interpreter pre-scored hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah that this morning he is his own interpreter you don't need nobody to interpret his word for him oh and court is ready he will put his interpretation to it man take their own idea I try to put it in the word I try to say it's this I try to say it's that but I believe there's coming a time where courts going to interpret his own word in your life in this church in this hallelujah praise God in this age and we're living in Oh hallelujah do you believe it this morning glory be to God hallelujah I just had a quote here that I wanted to read a many man before I got into priests gone and it's from earnestly contend for the faith that was once delivered to the Saints Amen isn't that right and that's what we're here to do this morning earnestly contend for the faith praise God deep faith is not books on tapes here's what it is he is he saying he said now he's addressing the church telling them just to those that are sanctified in God preserved in Christ and call and now he said now you're the people that I'm talking to that you will earnestly contend for the faith that was once delivered to the Saints he said now not he said the faith that was once delivered he said did you notice there the faith that was once delivered to the fifth to the Saints he said some people say well that's against my faith he said but there's only one fate he said there's only one Lord he said there's only one God and as one baptism there's one way to enter into it or not by your works not by your match but by his spirit Oh hallelujah hallelujah is not by your thought this morning it's not by your intellect that's not how you enter in it but there's one way to enter in to this holy ghost land that we're talking about this morning oh I by one spirit ties into coming down to our time where God is going to approve what is right and what is wrong men seeing a lot of things preachers seeing a lot of things churches came and a lot of things but it's gonna come up even time where God is gonna prove his old word he said my word shall return unto me void but it shall accomplish the purpose that I set foot poor accomplish an accomplished ossification if wisly accomplished sonification I love the Pentecostals or complicit clips and the spirits what are we talkin flesh on this last age pride come on now come on now we are all higher the smaller we are call by a higher court a call to perfection Oh Oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory to God so there's coming a proven time when God's gonna prove his own world but what I'm gonna read something here real quick and we're going to it he said well that's against my faith is only one Lord one faith see one doctrine a man and a spirit will confirm and make it alive with signs following please go on a man Allah is nine here's what he says he he says now people say well I have a faith I go to my own church he said that's not what you speaking to here he's talking to the people that's to contend for the faith so it's a thing he's trying to point to here now not general faith he said but but that was once delivered to the Saints see he said now he said now the only thing that we're going to ever know what's what if he could only find out what the faith is so he said if we find out what the faith is then we can earnestly contend for that faith is that ranch he said what the faith he said now the faith that was once delivered to the Saints now we'll go back here where they were first call sings and we'll find out what kind of faith they had then we'll know more or less what they want to contend for he said now when the church we call was was called Saints they were sanctified and would sanctify or sing come from sanctifying meaning they were clean meaning they were pure meaning they were ruling meaning they were unadulterated it's not that's why the Bible says present your bodies a living sacrifice holy and acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service that is the atmosphere they came in they were lean in the presence holla stayin in the spirit holstein air until caught do something staying in the right atmosphere staying in the right condition because as long as you're in the right condition can meet the need quarter to exactly what he said he would to once the conditions are met that's why if you take an egg and you put it on the hot dog it will hatch because the atmosphere is right the warmth is just what it needs hallelujah to bring into that group stage is now right to pip out and what you need today is to be in that atmosphere but to unplug yourself from the world unplug yourself from the internet and TV and the distractions and to begin to get into God's Word and because I lined up with what he said line it with what he spoke line up with what he promised line up with course requirements hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah then we'll see a mighty move of God isn't that right okay so he says here now he says what he had that day all right he says they were they were they were holy that's what was right amen and so forth he said now if that was the beginning of the church when it was inaugurated that was the beginning of the church when it was a lawyer eaten at the day of Pentecost he said now let's look at what they had back there what church contended for what they had lost now just 2 D 3 years after the beginning of the church now you know true wouldn't be take talking about back in the Old Testament on the Levitical laws because he said ok I'll skip down he said now notice what kind of faith that he had they had a faith in a resurrected living Christ not a people God not of people testimony but it was a resurrected living crimes in other words it wasn't just talking about it but they could not prove it on the spot Peter wasn't just talking about the gospel but we do to go down to the key court beautiful and brought on a spot he had live in evidence living proof and there was a court among them and that's what we want in this church that's what we want in Trinidad a living moving monument of God on the earth Oh hallelujah hallelujah of God stepping out from the pages of the Bible no more talking

proof in a corner of the impossible oh god of the mountains don't call up the power out of your skin bring back another Pentecost bring back another upper room experience when those disciples came down from the upper room their whole body was quickly they have zu quickened no I like they were walking like drunk people the people say these people trunk how these people be so drunk and there's

didn't come for program I come probably spirit at the Holy Spirit come take over the surface let's sit down finish man's Kingdom is finished time for God to take over this God is in charge God is the headquarters we are erected under the Holy Spirit Oh how many wonder added me how many one who ratted me we're gonna heinously container we're gonna fight for it we're gonna pray for it we're gonna cry for it we're gonna cipher we're gonna scream for it we're gonna crumble for it whatever we gotta to I gotta take a ten cents I'm rolling on my rolls that's what I gotta do that out to it but I wrong what they had back there we gotta have that now oh all the eleven is born a man do you get it wonderful oh my okay well a man I feel like a preach me already ever a man but that was the overview even but praise God now we'll see Amanda what they were they had a feet and a resurrected live in Christ someone who rose from the dead and was living among them so don't only did he raise but the Lord Himself appeared everywhere with them confirming the wood tiles in one of the miracles in other words and those things you can see cold over here cold over there cold over there look quadric Philip look what it pizza look what it Andrew and it ended up simultaneously God healing the sick here reason at that there his body spreading out across the barrier on across Judea and across the uttermost part of the earth just like he said it was it was on display it was on the hallelujah and that's what we're gonna have again he said just as same as he was before he ever did died he was living among me he's not right he said now see there wasn't contended for some historical of him but they were contending for a living Christ a resurrected one who was in limits and now any rose on the dead he did the same things after he rose from the dead through the apostles he was a present tense he was proven that he died that he did before he died even greater and more of it now he said let a little while he said in the world see at me no more but he shall see me the church to believe it's not it's for you it's not for the world the world the same Christ are open the eyes of what blinded the eyes of another well in the world and see him anymore but you're gonna see him you're gonna have proof you're gonna have evidence of this court in your life not by word only but by power demonstration because path with the gospel is even greater okay probably with even in you even to the end of the world that's what the Apostles believed and he believed that what he was in the flesh he was also and more in the spirit and that's what they thought tooked and that's what he believed and that's what they practiced and that is what God confirmed amen amen okay I'll stop there now Rhema praise God he loved him amen so now let's get on here now so now I want to talk about how God proves himself is now not a world proof if you look up the meaning of the world it means to show it means to be true to be truthful about what was spoken about what was said hizzoner it means to demonstrate to demonstrate the truth of that's what we're talking about this morning it means to show beyond all doubt with me some manifests to produce proof or to produce evidence that's why you read that scripture after he retired and rose from the dead he appeared to them and showed himself alive by many infallible proofs and fallible means it's unmistakable it's undeniably caught you cannot receive you cannot refuse what is being manifested in front of you it has to be caught it can't be nothing else it's not in your mind it's what he is doing right now we need quad right now hallelujah is there a politician we can't get walls by a painted fire that's an old fire that's a light of a pastor but what we need to do is a present inspire I live in reality I live in manifestation of the sons of God or I'll upon sons fill sons step out of the Seventh Seal O'Reilly and claim the inheritance claim their birth rights claim their families that's who you are this morning you are not trust anybody but you are royal priesthood you are holy nation you are peculiar people you couldn't hear this voice unless God put that in the air and sorry your soul is small that's what you do it sitting on their pews this morning this is not my chance this is not by accident but Paul is calling up people God has chosen of people out of every nation out of every child for his namesake hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah what Paul chose not what he felt like chosen not what he felt like choosing but what God chose from before the beginning which means it's not about your feelings it's not about what your circumstance it's not about what's going on in your mind but it's what God choose from before the beginning before there was a mood before there was a stop he had something to prove Oh hallelujah are we gonna get into proof evidence the world of proof means witness to so that's what we're gonna do when the Spirit comes now you're gonna be a witness of his resurrection a witness that God is alive a witness no more talk but evidence here it is here's my spirit flowing freely in their eye to give substance to to determine to substantiate to corroborate to verify all these things it's not ready it's what proof means to confirm a matter Holy Ghost confirming the word with signs wonders Americans know when Cortot as his voice know when God speaks he possesses the ability to prove what she said is not man could talk but it might be able to prove it not just a bluff so that never could say a pound but he can't prove when a wall is going to be bound there's no proof of that so he's just a bluff but God could please bi-election that's your present circumstance it's not always going to remain forever he has proof of that because when he calls in a pack pot there's something back there for you there's something back there for your family you can pull out evidence look what happened for you I've slipped my wedding band of grace up on your finger and I'm coming back for you that is proof Oh hallelujah praise calling Mary man and the devil crown and say you did this and you detach and you lied and you cheated and in fornication and you came in marriage or whatever it was and you did this and you did that you could look at the face of the devil and say there's no proof of that because when he goes back into the evidence tapes he sees that there's blood for you and he said where is the tape God said I'll find it I've done lost it in a sea of forgetfulness you have no proof of what you're saying but I have proof that I love them couple nail prints I in my hands I see he has the ability to prove his own word God can prove his own word and if you made a promise you can keep this promise all right any a promise can remain it will remain empty until it is proven in all right hallelujah so God is guilty until he brings his promise to pass hallelujah hallelujah spoke it it's that circling but it's written for prophecy right man I'll put a prophet to turn to the prophecy of it was it's really for the word to turn into spirits because before it was word it was spirit and the spirit after the word isn't all right the eternal word from his mouth and that would circle circle we tend to manifest itself in its time and its season and it goes back to spirit I can it's not much so think of it the word is only there for a time space it's only there to represent a time period the Word of God took lineage 400 years applicants are conceived of virgins have conceived not remain would for years and years all right man is not this one come and talk about it this one come on shake on a Sunday but it still remain word until somebody come along somebody come along as the prophecy of that would pick up what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah and Here Come Mary she was just an ordinary woman she didn't feel special she didn't know she was special but in a bad part of my she was very special indeed she was the incubator that God has predestinated Oh hallelujah to conceive and be Jesus all the Christ and here she was hallelujah hallelujah she was just dry word Oh everybody had come the angel Saint Hail Mary our highly favored you are gonna conceive something's gonna come over you it won't be by your match it won't be by your power but it be by the spirit it won't be by your thoughts don't put any interpretation to what I'm about to say I'm Mary sepia tone unto me according to thy word and that was it and she received it right there something that happened suddenly began to move and this morning I don't care how you feel it's not about feelings but if we could receive the word this morning with open face with no veils or we're hot but believe what he said will come to pass I believe caught this morning but his word to you that he is not a man that he will live but he is the same yesterday he's the same today and he is the same for Oh hallelujah I believe it this morning him and me man whoa hallelujah so it's just word until it comes to life now we know that this gospel it's not a word only but it's empowering and demonstration of the Holy Spirit hallelujah in other words we gotta prove God right here on this earth before we leave for the resurrection not after before we've got to give the devil one more kick one more round he's got the seat card on this play caught through the Prophet said I'll ride this trail one more time those words will not fall to the ground that same angel who was with the early church it's gonna come back again and right this trail one more time and this morning God it's piling up people and it's ready to receive His Word he's calling it from the north calling it from the South calling it from these calling them from no ass gettin em ready for a channeler resurrection Oh will be one more my hallelujah [Music] please call hallelujah so now watch in the beginning God proved this word see in him wants to be the father is not in it must be a savior it wants to be a deliverer it wants to be the captain of our salvation isn't that right hallelujah now the only thing is that those were just tributes those were attributes of what he wanted to be but it couldn't be it because there was nobody else to sing there was nobody to redeem there was nobody to show himself alive to in that way in that sense there was nobody to know him as Savior there was nobody to know him as Redeemer is now hallelujah so think of it in unity God is gone it's not an eternity he's all-powerful in eternity he's all by himself in eternity he could do anything in eternity in heaven he created angels a man is not to worship Him he was called up there but he wanted to be caught not only up there but he wanted to be gone down here also so in order to be caught he had to be worshipped and there had to be somebody to worship Him to prove that he was caught follow me this morning he had angels up there but it was nobody down here he created he created a moon he created a son he created a sauce he created nature he created everything but he came to the spot where he said I got to create man he said let us create man in our image and in our likeness so that I could not only be god of the heavens but I could be called of the earth also so he created man in his own image man in his own likeness man it is two million and said let that man have dominion let that man worship me so I could become part up there and I could also become part down here because in order to be God he has to be worshipped therefore he must have subjects in his kingdom to worship Him in spirit to worship Him in truth [Applause] hallelujah so he had an image of himself reflecting himself back worshiping God a perfect relationship he created man in His image holily is not but still God wasn't a Savior yet he was still gone the Lord God the God of the earth the god over man the córdova eater it's not right isn't that right he was still caught but he wasn't a savior because he had not yet expressed that attribute of being able to save he wanted to prove that could save but there was nobody to save are you following up he can't prove it unless there's a situation that presents itself where he could prove what he said to be the truth is now there had to be a situation to present itself where he could become whatever you had lead off so there had to be a need in order for him to present himself as indeed G get it now so when man fell to sex is now right and to even a whole fall and everything else now God could present himself now what has an opportunity to speak to man on a level and he wasn't able to to before the fall Oh hallelujah before everything was nice everything was wonderful but now the comp man is punished from the Garden of Eden court now has an opportunity to prove himself to be the car that he said he is to be the God of love to be the God of mercy to be the God of kindness to be the core of hallelujah the God of simplicity Oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah [Applause] so if we never was lost we would never know God in that way if we never had a struggle if we never had a trial if we never had a circumstance if we never had a situation think about it we would never know card in that relationship in that Tunis hallelujah of him being a father to us of him being a provider for us of him being a way maker for us Oh hallelujah but he wanted to prove himself God had a desire to prove who he was he wanted to be your strength he wanted to be your joy he wanted to be your song Oh hallelujah but you have to lose it you have to lose a comfort you have to lose all the joy you have to lose all of the other forget what it was like to be up there that's why we bypass our theophany and we trucked out from thought into flesh that's why we drop down here to be tested that's why we drop down here to be tried to be proven so that court could prove his word to us in our generation in our season in our time [Applause] it's not that's why I love the Bible the Bible can be said to be many things a book of history but what I love about the Bible is that the Bible also a true account of real human beings who were just like you and I who met caught in their time and in their season a man a man a pyro gets a true account of all these men who walk before God who God showed himself to who brought open himself to who God revealed himself to who God made himself real to Oh hallelujah Oh God showed himself alive all right I think about Gideon Gideon was a little fella smallest in his house it's not right of the smallest trial smallest family everything small shoe size small size small everything smaller there's nothing about him that you would think that he's a great man but all of sudden Israel found herself in a condition and he did evil in the sight of God is now right hallelujah and they were under oppression they were on a persecution it's not hallelujah here was Gideon for himself in a condition he was on the winepress Brian and wheat hide in a team and is now from the Midianites hiding it from evil from from a my phony enemy it's nice praise God here is he's there doing his thing hiding doing his singing secret praying and secrets looking in secret he loved the Lord but he don't know what to do because they're under pressure they under frustration or on that situation they are not bondage is not right and it seem like there's no way out then all of a sudden from an angel and said Gideon mighty man of Valor [Applause] said Gideon the Lord is with me o mighty man of Valor Gideon Anson reply was if the Lord is with us you talk about the Lord with us but when can you look to the left when kitty litter right here's Here I am seein nothin I ain't seeing nothing I need something more than that I'll I'll you see in the Lord is with me but that's not really enough he said where's the court of miracles where is the court and I heard about Oh father spoke up in the wilderness where is the court and open the red seal where is the choruses with Boz's where is the corner was with Joshua where is the choruses with Alleluia all these creeks menopause where is the part I was with Caleb howl only on all these mighty man of power he said where is that car hallelujah hallelujah and God said come on you are mighty man of Valor of quality for purpose let me begin a talk and he begin to Shane's excuses then he say God I want a witness I want proof I want evidence that you are with me he said I'm gonna take out my fleece honey I knew know the story it's not he said I'll never let the to fall upon it I let it should be no else and when he came on the next morning he saw the Sun and God did it one more time and reversed it he said Paul I know that you are with me now I know that you are for us not at I have a sign tell me what to do now that I have a witness that you are here right now show me what I'm supposed to do Oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah [Applause] so there's nothing wrong we're asking God for witness show me Lord what am I to do show me Lord why not follow show me Lord and I'll go isn't that right now here is no God proved himself isn't that right I think about David and how God was with even in the backside of the desert here was court had anointed thee auntie widows in his silent period isn't that right tending to his sheep he was already anointed to be king hallelujah hallelujah but he was just here in the silence holily is now taking care of his sheep taking care of his hood isn't doing what he had to do obeying the commandments staying in the spirit seen in the atmosphere all of a sudden a situation presented itself Goliath of God was walking it holic challenging the men of Israel challenging the court of are challenging the court hallelujah all these people early on early is now he said it sent me a man to fight me forty days and forty nights the biggest convention that you could ever think about forty days and forty nights collapse was the main speaker preaching in his own convention since send me a man to fight me send me a man to challenge me send me a man to oppose me send me a man to take me down I tell one of you and none of them could stand but here in a pack side of the desert while that was going on God had a man ready a man who was training a man who unbeknownst to him was being prepared for the biggest fight of his life Oh hallelujah enlarge Oh glory to God hallelujah hallelujah and here it was call it spite as father said go tape it take some food on for your brothers don't buy the army go on nourish them bring some coconut water give them something so deep it back is bad and he called on his brothers to refresh them to give them a little food in new season to give them a little encouragement they gave him a few reasons by the way until all of a sudden he heard a word from this man Paul the liar who claimed himself to be a part among men who said send me a man to fight me no I like Illini his own interpretation poor lad had his own thing going on he had his own move he had his own gospel and he had pawned the people crippled the people in their intellects crippled the people in their mind telling them they couldn't make it but you couldn't cross this line and when David saw him he said who is this uncircumcised philistine the Amish of the Living God who is who is talking I kind of talk how cool is he doesn't he know that all God is able personally know that our God is strong Oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah and his brothers decide to run him you know how brothers are he's heading north eNOS of your heart go back home can see a sheep hallelujah all of a sudden they began to talk David say that man have no right to talk to only at that way you know who your body's if you don't know and let me tell you I'm a car side of the desert and I was there alone with my sling and I met a pair one time and I couldn't stand before the forces on my car and I sue him praise hallelujah and a lion came before me and he wanted to take my sheep and I slew him Oh hallelujah hallelujah and he said Oh God that eleven the bear into my hands that same God who delivered the lion into my hands he is more than able to deliver this single ayah and he is the same cop this morning oh yeah hallelujah he's the same God this morning he's the same God Israel might have believed the core of yesterday they might have believed in a go through tomorrow but it didn't know a present tense god but that was the difference is David David knew our cause was not only yesterday but he was a saint today he is the same right now hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah is now and the Bible says faith is the substance of what you're hoping for feeds itself is the evidence of what you can't see so if you need evidence this morning just have to have H and what God's Word says concerning you this morning me in other words if you want to break through just have hitch and what God said and you can claim your victory this morning by fate hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah faith is just as real as talking about it it's just as real as seeing it it's just as real as smelling it it's a sense of hate hallelujah praise something that sees whatever you are hoping for it's season as a reality it sees it that's right now she takes the word and makes that word present tense in other words just morning if you're looking to be healed if you're looking pretty deliver that word and it's laying in the Bible right now for your healing your faith has the ability this morning to pull it down - pull down whatever you want whatever you need and make it a present tense reality I've indicated word to you right now in this service you will come to church for years people come an occupy up you people come and take up space come on clap their hands or go home the same I'm tired of that kind of service I'm looking for a kind of people who would get radically cloth who would get next to God I'll take God give me my Mountain give me my inheritance I need

looking at what's going on watching what's going on but some of them are particles also there's three kinds of people some of them gonna come to watch what's going on they're coming to watch your service nice service wonderful then they go home some of them wonder what's going on some of them don't have a clue but then some of them come to cause things to happen whose and I kind of people and I'm talking about those are the kind of people that interfere with what's going on in the spirit realm because their faith has the ability to interfere to interrupt with the wage in the atmosphere they need healing and they can't wait they need the leverage and they can't wait and if you know that your God is present tense this morning you don't have to wait for tomorrow you don't have to wait for next week now faith is the substance of what you're hoping for [Applause] yeah poor kid got a shot of praise this morning [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah mine [Music] it's a part of love about David when the brothers hear that kind of talk you say we got to present this man to the king cuz ain't nobody talking like that out there yes audience grasshopper grasshopper faith and David come present himself to Saul I began to talk to smaller tell Saul his experience we're gonna tell Saul his testimony you begin to preach the Saul Saul in such a battling condition here here we

sending you out there cuz you demand for the job you're the only one who can stand and David for the talk leave it try it on David and his gentlemanliness tried on soils interpretation but it didn't feel right it didn't work right it didn't pull front David said with his own mouth he said he laid it down he said so Lance is wonderful but I have not proved it I have not proved that this could work but he said when I was with the lion little fling poo that they could work when I was with a pair this little revelation this proves that the current could be defeated but the teller could be destroyed and if God pulls himself down court to prove himself right here right now right among us right now whoa hallelujah hallelujah he said for I haven't proved it I can't go in this holiday and it's all right and even gone down to the rostrum I'm pick up five spoons aigh and went down to because I am a little boy and a bigger liar what a paradox but God loves paradoxes God loves to confuse people because when you are weak he proves himself to be strong when you are low we prove themselves to be the high and lofty one but relevant another contrite heart hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah when clients see him coming glad say what is this for 40 days 40 nights I've been preaching send me a man and you send me away nobody got the message but [Applause] that was God answer to Goliath

little baby wrapped in swaddling clothes that was the Messiah that was the creator wrapped in flesh the world knew him not but as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of God Oh hallelujah Oh to him that call in his name to many he was this the many he was that but he asked them one time he said who do you say that I just wanna matter some serious some see Eliza some say one of the prophets holidays from theater boy someone crying in the wilderness many had their own interpretation but any asset question is that who do you say that I am and they didn't have an answer but all of a sudden something come from heaven not from are wrong they're not from next to them not from some church somewhere a revelation of what God kills of who this man was speaking was that they were walk-in with for three and a half years they didn't know who he was but here come Peter said thou art the Christ son on eleven o'clock and Jesus said flesh and blood didn't reveal a lot to you but my father is repeal it oh and this book of Revelation it's what I'm gonna build my church upon and the case of Hell cannot prevail against them any man they believe it is for him David said I'll chop your head off prophesy hallelujah hallelujah he prophesy in a spirit of fear the lights are off feed it to the birds David sell out chop your head off prophecy verses prophecy hallelujah now God is gonna prove who he is standing behind behind Alliance or is it behind David here's the showdown Kalai had his time period the talk is talk to run his run to preach his message now this David is on the scene now return on a message he didn't come from man he comes straight from the backside of the desert it wasn't sent by man he was sent by God to deliver the people hallelujah David wound up his sling David began to wind up his revelation the best way he knew how and if you could only get started this morning Oh God Pitou duress it's the anointing but a panem set of mechanics is here and the dynamics is ready to get into it he said but if you could only get strapped in if you could only get fouled up if you could only get the prayer ends if you could only get the pollen on card if you could only get serious with God God will get serious with you holler if you mean business with Paul mean business with you this morning if you mean business and get packet at the knees I get to prayer I get to cry on cause you watch party something but this generation you watch God do something but he's young people in here if you ever kept the crying out on part [Music] hallelujah hallelujah but always spoke about it earlier before he came up in all right he said it , it kind of come talk travail time it got to come talk grown in time it got to come to you tired out you crying out looking for a reality looking for vindication looking for manifestation of the Holy Spirit it cannot be we could just come to church and occupy up you and say this is a good service I'd say this was nice hallelujah praise God the rapture is not coming in that kind of a condition the rapture is coming to our people who are under expectation for the Holy Ghost to be conformed to them and their time and in their season know the rapture is coming tell people who is rocking back and forth under the anointing of the Holy Spirit the rapture is coming to up people who can see the sick hear the terror is the plan she the rapture is coming tell people who had the same kind of ministry that Jesus had on he was here Marie something here it said on the voice of God you see the voice of God you see how we know is the voice of God because for today then it was a vindicated prophet but now today how do we know it's the voice of God because it's the manifestation of the prophets word this is God's prophet and a true voice of God only brings back that real living supernatural God with the supernatural world with the supernatural manifestation of the true word then we know that it is the voice of God because I'm not super he said there's so much other in around that's almost there and that out but just remember it looked listen it'll come forward it'll do it reading this quote here then the seashell of the arishok he said now the stalk tassel the shock I notice he said Hagar there he said she represented the stalk which was the first life that started in a promise he said at Sarah represented a tassel or the pollen that comes into the tassel he said but Mary the Virgin represented and produced the true spiritual seed to bring forth the real true stalk back again it's not right Hagar and Sarah both was my sex but Mary was by the Virgin was by the power of God's promised word by virgin birth she brought forth the genuine seed the stalk he got a second wife isn't that right oh my he said by doubt of the word and promise working through it out slightly he said I just hope the Prophet said here may God help us he said I don't want you I want you to see this so bad he said you cannot slightly doubt any of it he said you've got to take it are you at me this morning he said you've got to take it just as it is he said it needs no interpretation he says the Bible says that a word of God is of no private interpretation God don't need any of our schools to interpret his word when he vindicates it he makes it alive and he said that is the interpretation of it Oh hallelujah hallelujah so don't try to put your mind in it don't try to put your thoughts in it you I said I said I thought I hired and my your thoughts he said my ways I hired on your ways and it's not about your thoughts forget about your ways what ways are higher his ways are perfect his ways are beyond knowing look how he brought you here this morning when we look back at the way that we come if we had a choice we would have chosen the easier way we would have chosen a nice away we would have chose the nicely paved road but God had to bring us through some rugged roads born at the bring us true summer road in ways some rough terrain some of us got peace some of us got battered some of us got tossed car some of us got bruised and knocked around along the way but we see this morning there was clots grease all the time that brought you to where you are you would be here if it wasn't for the grace of God you wouldn't be alive this morning if it wasn't be the grace of God you better lift those hands you better give God praise you better worship God this morning some of you Oh God praise this morning but blessings you don't even deserve oh come on say Matt somebody he brought you out and I'm very plain he put your foot on a rock to stay he put a song in your heart Oh Alleluia how dare the devil try to take my praise how dare the devil try to take my joy whoa hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah he proved himself a man oh my said now he may know I won't be too long with you he said unless he is so bad he said he can't doubt it is of no private interpretation and all right all right he said now when God said let there be light there was like and that didn't need to be interpreted he said what a virgin shall conceive she conceived he said it doesn't need to be interpreted he said we don't need all this it's seminaries and things that gets man he said well we got the interpretation we got the interpretation no he said God Himself interprets his own word he doesn't need anybody to interpret it for him if he said it will happen it happens all same and somebody if he said you're gonna be delivered you're going to be delivered if he said you're gonna receive the Holy Ghost you're going to receive the Holy Ghost there's no devil in hell I can't stop it I don't care how many temples praise God the devil is 2,000 years too late Jesus already paid the price he already proved your salvation on the cross he said hallelujah time for them I paid a price for them it is finished Oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah Oh louia praise God glory to God when you are lost and undone when there was no way out for you we were born in sin shaped in iniquity but here come the bleeding bloody Lamb he had something to prove those are my people and I'm gonna die for them yes he did it and before the foundation of the world but he come down on the urge to manifest to prove what he said back there to prove what he did back there he came down in himself and said I'd die for them and he want up that rugged cross he ran up that nail hallelujah he cracked up that hill he praise God died for you it's blood is pouring out hallelujah out of this high water
