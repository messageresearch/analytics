[37:04] thought with you
[37:07] tonight and before I begin I just want
[37:10] to thank God for this opportunity to be
[37:12] able to to speak to this portion of the
[37:15] bride of Christ
[37:16] amen my my my my the devil is defeated
[37:21] tonight something good is about to
[37:24] happen I'm under expectation
[37:27] I'm
[37:28] excited I know that we didn't gather in
[37:30] vain and I know nothing happens by
[37:34] chance Hallelujah glory glory amen Glory
[37:38] Hallelujah so I I just want to start and
[37:41] and and we see what the Lord will do
[37:45] amen hallelujah Glory I think I want to
[37:48] start from a title you know the title
[37:50] tonight is fight for every
[37:53] inch so we in a battling mode right
[37:57] think we are called to fight for every
[37:58] in ground and as an inspiration the
[38:02] battle is the Lord's sir wonder it
[38:05] doesn't give an excuse for us not to
[38:07] fight but we have to be conscious and
[38:09] aware that the battle is the Lord's it's
[38:12] not by your might and your strength and
[38:13] your thoughts and ideas but he has
[38:16] prescribed certain things for us to do
[38:19] he has certain Rules by which we must
[38:21] operate but we have to do the
[38:23] fighting we need to fight for every inch
[38:26] of ground
[38:27] we need to fight to claim every promise
[38:29] that he has set forth in front of us
[38:31] everything that he has promised us in
[38:33] this end time we have to fight it's not
[38:35] going to fall in our laps and and and
[38:37] happen by chance but we have to fight
[38:40] amen if you have your Bibles I'd like
[38:42] you to turn with me to the Book of
[38:46] Joshua I'm reading just two verses there
[38:50] Joshua 1: 3 and
[38:54] 4 very familiar scripture
[39:01] and it says every place that the soul of
[39:02] your foot shall tread upon that have I
[39:06] given unto you as I said unto Moses and
[39:10] in verse four it says from the
[39:12] Wilderness and this Lebanon even unto
[39:15] the Great River the river
[39:17] Euphrates all the land of the Hittites
[39:19] and unto the great sea towards the going
[39:21] down of the sun shall be a coast amen
[39:23] amen let's just bow heads oh heavenly
[39:27] father as we read your scripture we pray
[39:29] that you would breath life into it Lord
[39:31] Lord any man could read the words and we
[39:33] could read it in English and Spanish and
[39:35] French and what whatever language we
[39:37] choose to translate Lord Lord but it
[39:38] really takes a divine revelation to come
[39:41] and Inspire to our hearts Lord Lord I
[39:43] pray that you Quicken your words tonight
[39:45] I pray that you you would take me out of
[39:46] the way Lord and you'll use me as a
[39:48] vessel to speak to your people I pray
[39:50] that lives will be changed and
[39:51] transformed that there's not just a a a
[39:54] formality that we come to church and we
[39:55] go back home but we come and experience
[39:58] a a reality in your presence tonight
[40:00] Lord Lord I pray that you would unravel
[40:03] our minds un loose our hearts Lord Lord
[40:06] that we will walk out here Lord so
[40:08] burdened knowing that we're so much
[40:10] closer to where you want us to be Lord
[40:12] Lord I pray that you'll Quicken our
[40:14] hearts Quicken our our minds Lord that
[40:16] we be open to receive and and you would
[40:18] speak lip to air to your people tonight
[40:20] in Jesus name we pray amen amen you may
[40:23] have your seats GL amen you know I
[40:27] always say I could never get accustomed
[40:28] to this and I have no message of my own
[40:31] but by God's grace I'm going to deliver
[40:32] the message I have here
[40:34] amen and just to bring a context I know
[40:37] the title I said was fight for every
[40:39] inch and it sounds almost cliche it's
[40:41] something that we familiar hearing
[40:43] familiar with and and something that we
[40:45] say from time to time that we got to
[40:46] fight and and it sounds sometimes even
[40:49] normal that we need to fight because
[40:50] we've called we've been called to battle
[40:53] we've been called to fight and sometimes
[40:56] I think God takes the simple and he
[40:59] opens it a little more once you dig a
[41:01] Little Deeper so four simple words fight
[41:04] for every inch what does it mean what
[41:06] are we really called to do who are we
[41:08] fighting how are we fighting what's the
[41:10] ammunition what's the opposition what's
[41:11] the territory what's the terrain why we
[41:14] fighting what we fighting towards how do
[41:16] we know when when when when when the the
[41:18] fight is concluded and we win and we B
[41:20] and the battle has ended amen so we just
[41:22] want to delve into this a little bit and
[41:24] I pray that that bless your
[41:27] amen so I'm a kind of guy I like facts I
[41:31] like things declared I like things very
[41:33] very plain right I don't like to have to
[41:36] worry about it too much I like when God
[41:39] could speak and you see it clearly you
[41:41] don't have to try to figure it out too
[41:42] much and sometime he speaks like that
[41:44] and when I looked at this fighting for
[41:46] every
[41:48] inch it it almost troubled me a little
[41:51] bit fight fight What does fight mean who
[41:53] is to fight how do we fight how do we
[41:56] really manage this and by definition I
[41:58] had to go research it I'm hearing almost
[42:01] like an echo to the front and it says to
[42:03] fight according to the dictionary it
[42:05] says to take part in a violent struggle
[42:08] involving the exchange of physical blows
[42:10] or the use of weapons that's one
[42:12] definition a next definition said
[42:15] struggle to overcome eliminate or
[42:17] prevent that's what it means to fight
[42:19] amen the third definition I found it
[42:21] says a violent confrontation or struggle
[42:24] amen then it occurred to me
[42:26] as I read them over and over trying to
[42:29] make sure I have a sound understanding
[42:31] of this fight I noticed there was one
[42:34] consistent word in each definition and
[42:36] that was
[42:37] struggle so it's very clear that there's
[42:40] no fight by chance you do have easy
[42:44] fight and you just wake up and you win
[42:47] it don't work like that it requires
[42:49] something it means you have a part to
[42:51] play you have a role to play you have
[42:52] something to do you have some opposition
[42:54] to face you will get resistance and
[42:57] because of that you will face some
[42:58] pressure but guess what before the
[43:01] foundation of the world God has prepared
[43:03] you for the battle amen the battle is
[43:06] the
[43:07] Lord's but you have to fight amen
[43:11] so as I studied and I looked and I I I
[43:15] tried to figure this out and I said you
[43:16] know what I must see parallels elsewhere
[43:19] we have lots of parallels in the
[43:20] scripture and I was speaking to a friend
[43:22] recently and he's a tailor and he makes
[43:24] suits and he makes clothes and he
[43:26] designs and he went to the UK and he
[43:28] learned how to do it and the term they
[43:30] use in that industry is
[43:32] bespoke and what that means is that it's
[43:35] customized it's made for you so you
[43:38] don't go on the rack and pick it up you
[43:40] don't go to the store and buy it they
[43:42] make it just for you so I went and I
[43:44] found the definition of bspoke and
[43:46] bspoke said a product made specially
[43:50] according to the needs of an individual
[43:53] customer so tonight I want to tell you
[43:55] that your trials your battles your
[43:58] fights your struggles are bespoke
[44:00] they're customized to youall if I take
[44:03] your your battle I might fail
[44:06] it but God in his wisdom he has
[44:10] customized trials for you to bring out
[44:13] of you what he want to get out of you he
[44:16] knows exactly what to do and how to do
[44:19] it he knows exactly what you need to
[44:21] pass through that's why the songwriter
[44:22] said some through the water some through
[44:24] the some through great trials all
[44:26] through the blood because he knows
[44:28] exactly what you have to pass through to
[44:30] build the character that he wants to see
[44:32] at the end at the end of the pipe when
[44:34] you go through and you come out the
[44:36] other side he knows what he wants to
[44:38] come out of that
[44:39] side and I thought about it and I say
[44:41] you know how wonderful how marvelous how
[44:44] marvelous it is that of the 8 billion or
[44:48] so persons on the earth everybody has an
[44:50] individual fingerprint no two persons
[44:52] have the same you could be identical
[44:54] twins but no two persons have the same
[44:56] fingerprint just like that he has your
[44:59] trial
[45:01] specifically designed for you now I'm
[45:04] not here to frighten you I'm not here to
[45:06] to kill your joy and make you feel we
[45:08] just talking about trials and bad things
[45:10] and and and things that you have to face
[45:12] but this is reality this is the word now
[45:15] yes sir I'm not making it up amen so
[45:18] because he customized the trial for
[45:21] you he had to give you the resources to
[45:23] overcome them amen amen amen yes sir GL
[45:29] he's never lost a
[45:31] battle he select individuals to
[45:34] accomplish particular things because he
[45:36] know they can yes throughout scripture
[45:39] when you study the scripture sometime we
[45:42] call them Heroes of Faith right but when
[45:44] you look at individual activity you will
[45:46] see these trials were customized there a
[45:49] reason Samson was who he was where he
[45:50] was at that time amen there's a reason
[45:53] Joseph was who he was at that time when
[45:56] David went it wasn't by chance he went
[45:58] to drop food for his
[46:00] brothers there was something specific
[46:03] that he had to do at that time but as a
[46:07] context before doing that he was given
[46:10] the tools the resources in order to face
[46:14] that adversity to face that challenge so
[46:17] often times I say you know where we are
[46:20] now is the sum total of all the
[46:22] experiences we've been through but think
[46:24] about God that's in my finite mind God
[46:27] predestinated you he knew you would be
[46:30] here tonight he knew the challenges we
[46:32] will have outside and he selected you to
[46:34] be in this service whether live whether
[46:37] online whether you see it right now or
[46:38] tomorrow he knew you would see he knew
[46:41] you would hear the words that I'm
[46:42] speaking right now and he still chose
[46:44] you he still went past your family
[46:47] background and the challenges you had to
[46:50] come to come to S service to transport
[46:53] issues whatever challenges you had in
[46:55] your life
[46:56] however you feel you arrived here
[46:58] tonight he already saw this happening
[47:02] and as a result he would have passed you
[47:04] through things and given you tools but
[47:07] often times when the challenge comes we
[47:09] tend to be apprehensive we want to back
[47:12] away and we want to pray at that point
[47:14] that God send this challenge to somebody
[47:15] else when your challenges be spoke when
[47:19] your challenges customized to
[47:23] you listen when I read that scripture
[47:27] earlier he talk about from the
[47:29] Wilderness and this Lebanon even unto
[47:31] the Great River the river Euphrates all
[47:34] the land of the Hittites it was very
[47:35] very specific he said the land of the
[47:37] Hittites and unto the great sea towards
[47:40] the going down of the sun amen shall be
[47:43] a coast so what God was doing there now
[47:46] he spoke to Moses he was telling Joshua
[47:48] at this point that these are the
[47:50] boundaries yes this is the inheritance I
[47:53] set out for you Hallelujah and we'll tie
[47:55] it all together but it's very important
[47:58] when you're going and fight that that
[47:59] that you know what you're fighting for
[48:02] that you know where your boundaries are
[48:04] think about a land dispute when you come
[48:06] with the deed and you look at it you
[48:10] look at the deed and it doesn't say one
[48:12] pastel a land in Grande it do say
[48:15] that it will say bounded by Mr John L on
[48:19] the West Side bounded by Frankland
[48:22] Sheila land Laura land on north south
[48:26] east west so this part bounded by that
[48:28] is yours now when God defines things he
[48:33] don't redefine it he tell you the river
[48:36] here the coast here this is where it is
[48:40] when you think of Abraham he said listen
[48:42] look this way you see that to this side
[48:46] across here so he by definition was very
[48:49] very specific very clear why he don't
[48:53] want you fight in the wrong battle
[48:55] righten amen if you don't know where
[48:57] your land is if you don't know where
[48:58] your boundaries are then you may find
[49:00] you're fighting your neighbor
[49:03] unjustly true and when you lose the
[49:05] battle now you say but oh God I was
[49:08] fighting I was defending but you was
[49:11] fighting the wrong fight you know often
[49:12] time they say a by fight that's not your
[49:14] your your fight don't get involved in
[49:15] that but God was very specific he said
[49:19] listen I told Moses this already so I
[49:21] want to tell you again so I reiterating
[49:23] the boundary is not going to change it's
[49:24] from here to here here today so guess
[49:27] what he's done this before and he do it
[49:29] again so what he said he said listen in
[49:33] times pass I said this but here what I
[49:36] want to tell you I'm the same yesterday
[49:38] today and forever the boundary is not
[49:41] going on change healing is still yours
[49:44] Deliverance is still yours the Holy
[49:46] Ghost is still
[49:48] yours I mean adoption Perfection
[49:51] Deliverance you name it is still yours
[49:54] the definition of going and change it's
[49:57] up to you to fight for it because this
[50:00] is your inheritance this is your promise
[50:02] this is promise to you it's not going to
[50:05] be given to you not handed to you on
[50:08] your lap but you have to fight for it
[50:11] but I have defined this is for you this
[50:14] is yours from here to here from here to
[50:17] there and once you can understand that
[50:19] you know you're battlegr you're
[50:21] defending every inch once the enemy even
[50:23] look like he looking over your fence
[50:25] you're fighting because that's yours all
[50:28] right so healing is yours tonight you
[50:30] don't need to wait till tomorrow your
[50:32] marriage is yours your relationship is
[50:35] yours your finan is yours whatever he
[50:38] promised you is yours so you have to be
[50:41] able to claim that recognize it identify
[50:44] it and fight for it because he promised
[50:47] that but you know what the battle is the
[50:49] Lord's so he not going to send you to
[50:52] fight just by yourself and say well go
[50:54] ahead now fix up no most times you know
[50:57] what he does he wins the battle ahead of
[51:00] time and he go through through the
[51:02] motions he tell you look in David's case
[51:05] he know golad coming you know he say let
[51:08] me send a bear manage that pass that
[51:11] test Mr alion pass that test because
[51:15] golad coming because he know golad
[51:17] coming he have to train so he have to
[51:19] train you he have to carry you through
[51:21] things that may be uncomfortable he have
[51:23] to have people give you resist
[51:26] and opposition he have to have you
[51:28] wondering how I going to make it through
[51:30] boy but an he brought you through last
[51:32] time so what you think going un Change
[51:34] this time Hallelujah the same
[51:38] God but he want to reach a level of
[51:41] maturity where you could trust him where
[51:42] you can have faith in him where you
[51:44] could depend on him this is where these
[51:47] guys reach when they listen they had
[51:50] such a confidence he say listen you just
[51:52] go you fight you'll get the victory all
[51:55] you have to do is fight you couldn't sit
[51:57] down and drink coffee and say listen we
[51:59] are the chosen
[52:01] generation God told us we have an
[52:03] inheritance you know no inheritance for
[52:05] them know he say every place the soul of
[52:08] your foot shall tread upon that is what
[52:11] is yours so I have identified what it is
[52:15] but you still have a responsibility you
[52:18] still have something to do very very
[52:21] specifically amen so the territory and
[52:24] the her inheritance had to be clearly
[52:28] defined back then and today clearly
[52:31] defined so there should be no ambiguity
[52:33] and well I'm not sure if I could really
[52:38] reach my loved ones or My Wayward
[52:41] Daughter and my son or I need healing I
[52:45] wonder if I pray now if you'll answer
[52:47] boy no at the end of the day if healing
[52:51] is yours you have to have faith to claim
[52:54] it he's is not going to say you know
[52:57] what you just come to church on a
[52:59] Wednesday night so that that is yours a
[53:02] bonus a lineup no if David had to fight
[53:06] and Samson had to fight and Abraham had
[53:09] had to fight how special are you now
[53:11] you're real special but guess what he
[53:13] special enough you still have to fight
[53:16] to develop into the character that he
[53:18] [Applause]
[53:20] wants now it's interesting we talk about
[53:24] fighting
[53:26] and there are certain things I would
[53:28] have mentioned before that in any fight
[53:30] we need to understand the parameters of
[53:32] the fight the parameters of the fight
[53:35] could be as follows you need to
[53:38] understand the
[53:39] rules in a traditional sense it may have
[53:42] a boxing match so they will have rules
[53:43] of boxing they will say well you could
[53:45] punch a particular way you're not
[53:47] allowed to put punch in a particular
[53:49] area also and in another type of fight
[53:52] they may say well you know what no holds
[53:54] bad you could do anything
[53:55] that that's the that's the rules of the
[53:57] fight so you must understand the rules
[53:59] of this fight as we talk about rules one
[54:01] of the things I want to say is that the
[54:03] opposition we fight don't don't fight
[54:05] fair at all amen he don't fight fair
[54:08] right so as a result I have a secret the
[54:10] secret in this case is that the person
[54:14] supporting you don't fight fair either
[54:17] because the battle is the Lords he win
[54:20] the fight already so no matter what
[54:22] device the enemy come with it may seemed
[54:25] very creative and hey I wasn't looking
[54:28] for him there know but guess what he
[54:30] believe and tremble know because the
[54:32] kind of power we working with he know
[54:34] he's defeated and know all he could do
[54:36] is Bluff all he could do is distract all
[54:39] he could do is attempt to show you
[54:41] something else but he lost already it's
[54:44] up to us to have faith and confidence
[54:47] and trust in God and know that the
[54:49] promises he left for us he is well able
[54:52] to fulfill manifest and accomplish so
[54:55] all we have to do is take the resources
[54:57] he give and fight knowing that he
[55:00] already have the victory amen amen but I
[55:04] want to say that when God gives an
[55:08] assignment it must be completed so if
[55:11] God say fight you have to fight you
[55:13] can't sit down and say well that
[55:15] probably applied to somebody else not me
[55:18] I'm not the fighting type I prefer we
[55:20] could discuss it I prefer you know let's
[55:23] find an amicable agreement let's
[55:25] find another way around it now no no no
[55:27] here's what going on and I want to show
[55:29] you in the scripture you don't have to
[55:31] find it but in numbers 33 verse 52- 56
[55:35] we're going to read it and it
[55:37] says then ye shall drive out all the
[55:40] inhabitants of the land from before you
[55:42] amen and destroy all their pictures and
[55:46] destroy all their molten images and
[55:49] quite pluck down all the high places
[55:52] verse 53 it says and ye shall dispossess
[55:56] the inhabitants of the land and dwell
[55:57] therein for I have given you the land to
[56:00] possess it verse 54 says and you shall
[56:04] divide the land by lot for an
[56:05] inheritance among your families and to
[56:08] the more you shall give the more
[56:10] inheritance and to the fewer you shall
[56:12] give the less inheritance Every Man's
[56:15] inheritance shall be in the place where
[56:17] his lot falleth according to the tribes
[56:19] of your fathers he shall inherit amen so
[56:22] once again very very specific Nothing by
[56:25] chance it's not because as you it's my
[56:27] partner long time so you'll get more no
[56:29] to the more you get more to the fewer
[56:32] you get less all right in verse 55 it
[56:34] says but and this is the important
[56:37] part so it's all well and good to fight
[56:41] eradicate them evict them destroy
[56:43] everything that sound nice as the battle
[56:45] right but here's what if you choose not
[56:48] to fight here's what happens but if you
[56:51] will not drive out the inhabitants of
[56:53] the land from before for you then it
[56:56] shall come to pass that those which let
[56:59] remain of them shall be Pricks in your
[57:02] eyes and thorns in your sides and shall
[57:04] Vex you in the land wherein you dwell
[57:07] moreover it shall come to pass that I
[57:10] the same supporter you had before he
[57:13] said that I shall do unto you as I
[57:16] thought to do unto them what does that
[57:18] mean
[57:19] yes the opposite reverse right so when
[57:23] he tell you destroy when he tell you
[57:25] fight when he tell you conquer when he
[57:26] tell you disposes when he tell you
[57:28] listen inhabit stay right there separate
[57:32] when he tell you divide the inheritance
[57:34] and give lots to this one and that one
[57:36] you choose not to no you know what going
[57:38] on he say listen the same people that
[57:41] you feel sorry for the same sin that you
[57:44] feel you know what let let me leave that
[57:46] one alone because it affecting me much
[57:49] that same thing that same person that
[57:52] same challenge that same trial is what
[57:54] what will come as a torn in your side
[57:56] that will terrorize you that will ensure
[58:00] that the same God who give you the
[58:02] promise come and do unto you what he
[58:04] wanted you do unto
[58:10] them amen there's the word now this is
[58:14] the
[58:15] scripture
[58:16] amen now as we go on I keep saying the
[58:20] battle is the Lords but we have a
[58:22] responsibility to fight yes
[58:26] in this fight we talking about there are
[58:27] no rules except what God allows cuz as
[58:31] you can remember in the Book of Job the
[58:33] devil wanted to devour him kill him do
[58:38] every imaginable thing to him and you
[58:41] know what God said go ahead try just
[58:44] spare his life do all you could do throw
[58:47] him down kill his children ensure his
[58:51] Finance go down to the bottom of the
[58:53] barrel don't give him no contracts
[58:55] ensure that he can't pay his bills the
[58:58] debt collectors ringing on his phone as
[59:00] a matter of fact he can't get the calls
[59:01] because the phone cut right so do
[59:04] whatever you believe is the worst but
[59:07] you know
[59:08] what he would not move from the promise
[59:11] of God because he understand that the
[59:14] battle is the Lords you can't come
[59:16] against a child of God that is so
[59:19] convinced that Jesus Christ is the same
[59:21] yesterday today and forever and the
[59:23] promises he made back then is just as
[59:26] real to you right now how they will move
[59:29] you with the Revelation in your heart
[59:32] how they will shift you how they will
[59:34] distract or discourage you you have to
[59:36] stand and fight knowing that he is your
[59:39] supporter he is mighty in battle he is
[59:43] mighty to deliver and Conquer
[59:45] [Applause]
[59:47] amen additionally we said earlier that's
[59:50] not a fair fight it's not fair right but
[59:54] you know what is bepoke it customized to
[59:57] you so you have to fight your
[1:00:00] battle right you have to fight for
[1:00:03] yourself for your family for your loved
[1:00:06] ones brother always say listen you could
[1:00:09] pray how much you want the broom not
[1:00:11] going and get up and clean the room you
[1:00:14] know so you have a
[1:00:16] responsibility you alone could pray for
[1:00:20] you somebody could pray on your behalf
[1:00:24] but you have to develop your prayer
[1:00:30] life I want to say that the opposition
[1:00:32] the opponent the adversary whatever you
[1:00:35] want to describe them as they're well
[1:00:37] trained they know about fighting they
[1:00:41] know about battle they know about
[1:00:42] strategy they know about distraction
[1:00:45] they know about doing things that that
[1:00:48] seem ordinary but behind that they have
[1:00:51] some some some missiles that are
[1:00:53] targeted and trained on you they know
[1:00:56] where your weak points are they know how
[1:00:59] to tempt you they know how to throw you
[1:01:02] off but you know what the battle is the
[1:01:07] Lord's amen at the end of the day we
[1:01:11] have some serious resources amen we have
[1:01:14] a whole
[1:01:16] armor to stand against the Wilds of the
[1:01:18] wicked you know Wes of the enemy you
[1:01:20] know because we're not battling against
[1:01:22] flesh and blood you know it's not I
[1:01:24] stand up in front of my neighbor house
[1:01:26] so you can't move no it's against
[1:01:29] principalities and powers and spiritual
[1:01:32] wickedness in high places and things
[1:01:35] that you could conquer right on your
[1:01:36] knees right that attack you and try to
[1:01:40] throw you down and try to ensure that
[1:01:42] you can't accomplish what God set out
[1:01:44] for you to
[1:01:48] accomplish amen amen I also want to say
[1:01:52] we fight not because we like fighting
[1:01:55] we fight because we don't have a choice
[1:01:57] we fight because we must we have to it
[1:02:01] is not a a a a optional thing that I
[1:02:06] could sit down and rock back and say you
[1:02:08] know what I have feeling to fight today
[1:02:10] you know I have feeling to die today you
[1:02:13] know a feeling to take it easy today I
[1:02:15] take I taking a relax no it's no
[1:02:18] relaxation because the enemy we fight he
[1:02:21] busy his agenda is like a Thief he want
[1:02:25] to kill he want to steal he want to
[1:02:28] destroy if he could destroy you tonight
[1:02:30] if he could take your life tonight he do
[1:02:32] it but
[1:02:35] God the battle is the
[1:02:40] Lords so every promise your loved ones
[1:02:44] your prayer life your family your
[1:02:46] marriage your your health faith I mean
[1:02:49] it's your responsibility to fight for
[1:02:52] these things and he will ensure that you
[1:02:56] could have the victory because he
[1:02:59] selected you for that battle he knew
[1:03:01] what you will be going through he know
[1:03:03] what you're already going through so I
[1:03:05] know sometimes it feel like you're back
[1:03:07] against the wall and you're at death's
[1:03:09] door but you know what he knows that too
[1:03:11] am he knows how much pressure you could
[1:03:13] take because he knows where he wants you
[1:03:15] to be yes sir you know in the book of
[1:03:18] Samuel speaking about D David Sam Samuel
[1:03:23] 17:46 to 49 he said this day will the
[1:03:27] Lord deliver thee into my hands speaking
[1:03:28] about David and Goliath right he said
[1:03:31] this day will the Lord deliver thee into
[1:03:34] mine hands and I will smite thee and
[1:03:37] take thine head from thee and I will
[1:03:39] give the carus of the host of the
[1:03:42] Philistines this day unto the fowls of
[1:03:44] the air and to the wild beasts of the
[1:03:46] earth that all the Earth may know that
[1:03:48] there's a God in Israel in verse 47 he
[1:03:52] said and all this assembly shall know
[1:03:53] that the Lord saveth not with sword and
[1:03:56] spear for the battle is the Lord's and
[1:03:59] he will give you into our hands verse 48
[1:04:02] says and it came to pass when the
[1:04:04] Philistine arose and came and Drew nigh
[1:04:07] to meet David that David hastened he
[1:04:10] didn't move slow he had an assignment he
[1:04:13] knew what he had to do he say he
[1:04:16] hastened and ran towards the Army to
[1:04:19] meet the
[1:04:20] Philistine verse 49 say and David put
[1:04:22] his hand in his bag and took then a
[1:04:25] stone and slang it and smed the
[1:04:26] Philistine in his forehead that the
[1:04:28] stone sunk in it into his forehead and
[1:04:31] he fell upon his face to the Earth so
[1:04:34] clearly he had the resources you know he
[1:04:37] had the sling he had the stones he he
[1:04:40] had confidence in God so he was going
[1:04:43] with haste to the battle you know but
[1:04:45] you heard what he said he knew the
[1:04:47] battle was the Lords so although the
[1:04:50] battle was the Lords he had something to
[1:04:52] fight he had something something to do
[1:04:55] he had a responsibility so it's not for
[1:04:57] the preacher or the musician or the
[1:04:59] elder or the Deacon you have a
[1:05:02] responsibility the battle is his but you
[1:05:05] still have a role to play David couldn't
[1:05:08] go and stand up a spare or something and
[1:05:11] say you know what my God could defeat
[1:05:14] you or no he will defeat you let's say
[1:05:16] defeat you no at the end of the day he
[1:05:19] had had trained he was trained in
[1:05:22] operating the sling
[1:05:24] so when he put the stone and brother
[1:05:26] brandom dramatized he had five Stones
[1:05:29] why he knew he could kill Goliath with
[1:05:31] one you know F AI t h he went with those
[1:05:35] stones he put the first one and he ran
[1:05:38] to Goliath knowing it was a finished
[1:05:40] work this golad that stone couldn't miss
[1:05:44] him if he tried you know he couldn't lie
[1:05:46] down on the ground if he lied down on
[1:05:48] the ground the stone was going on the
[1:05:50] ground because the battle was the
[1:05:53] Lords
[1:05:54] so we must fight for every inch but the
[1:05:57] battle is the Lord's now when we talk
[1:06:00] about Joshua and we allude to it just
[1:06:02] now in Joshua's case in
[1:06:06] in in a message God keeps his word
[1:06:09] brother said way down in Egypt God said
[1:06:12] I've given you that land and all that's
[1:06:14] in it now he never just said I'm going
[1:06:17] to pick you up take you up there and sit
[1:06:19] you down they had to fight they had to
[1:06:21] fight let me read it again they had to
[1:06:24] fight for every inch of ground they had
[1:06:27] God when he commanded Joshua there he
[1:06:29] said be of a good courage Be not Afraid
[1:06:32] neither be thou dismayed for the Lord
[1:06:34] thy God is with thee wheresoever thou
[1:06:37] goest brother brandham knocks on the
[1:06:39] pulpit two times the Lord thy God is
[1:06:42] with thee wheresoever thou goest no
[1:06:45] matter what it is how hard it is how
[1:06:47] great the obstacle is that does not
[1:06:49] matter it's down through the valley of
[1:06:52] the shadow of death the Lord Lord thy
[1:06:54] God is with thee wheresoever thou goest
[1:06:57] oh Joshua could call Israel together and
[1:06:59] said stand here and watch the glory of
[1:07:01] God God is with his word God made the
[1:07:04] promise God said to Joshua every place
[1:07:08] that The Souls of your foot sets that's
[1:07:10] yours I'll give it to you oh my my my in
[1:07:15] paragraph 141 it says it's a Salvation
[1:07:18] it's a Divine Healing it's a more
[1:07:20] blessing it's a anything that God
[1:07:23] promised make Footprints because every
[1:07:25] place you put your foot is yours why
[1:07:27] would you stand still if he said every
[1:07:29] place you put your foot is yours make
[1:07:32] Footprints tonight make Footprints
[1:07:34] tomorrow because every place you put
[1:07:36] your foot is yours amen he said that I
[1:07:40] have promised every place The Souls of
[1:07:42] your foot sets I've given you for a
[1:07:44] possession God promised it God keeps his
[1:07:47] word God's word is Everlasting true I
[1:07:50] believe it you believe it Brothers it's
[1:07:52] time for us to make Footprints we can't
[1:07:55] stay right here in the same camp the
[1:07:57] fire is moving on let's move on from
[1:07:59] glory to glory from Bible experience to
[1:08:02] Bible experience let's unfold and open
[1:08:05] our hearts raise up our hands to God
[1:08:07] keep same stay in the Bible don't get
[1:08:10] outside of that stay right there
[1:08:13] amen that's a
[1:08:16] prophet what a mighty God we serve in
[1:08:19] God's provided way for this day yes
[1:08:22] sir he said come with
[1:08:27] determination he said come with a
[1:08:29] determination amen come that you're
[1:08:32] going to stay there till it's over you
[1:08:34] know I I was at a conference recently
[1:08:36] and was a business event and and one of
[1:08:38] the things the guy said is that a lot of
[1:08:39] people fail because they're not willing
[1:08:41] to do whatever it takes this is a in a
[1:08:44] business context now he say listen and
[1:08:47] we heard it many many times we all have
[1:08:49] the same 24 hours but who is willing to
[1:08:53] do whatever ever it
[1:08:54] takes and it applies across the board so
[1:08:58] you could be a skillful me me mechanic
[1:09:00] and somebody brought a vehicle to you
[1:09:02] and said you know I think is the I don't
[1:09:03] know much about cars but I think is the
[1:09:05] wheel and you look at it and you check
[1:09:08] it and you realize you know what is the
[1:09:10] wheel is the axle I just call it names
[1:09:13] the spindle the whatever it is the rack
[1:09:15] the mons the whatever you know is this
[1:09:17] and they complain to you about the song
[1:09:20] or the way driving if you do whatever it
[1:09:22] takes it means you go above and beyond
[1:09:24] to ensure that when they come back to
[1:09:26] collect that it don't have a squeak it
[1:09:28] don't have a a tilt it don't have a turn
[1:09:30] they could go on it's smooth now in
[1:09:32] Trinidad they might get to having
[1:09:34] problems doing that but at the end of
[1:09:36] the day when you do that when you have
[1:09:38] the attitude that I am doing whatever it
[1:09:40] takes what do you think going to happen
[1:09:41] to you next
[1:09:42] time everybody is going to come by you
[1:09:46] because they know the quality that you
[1:09:49] offer you go above and beyond to ensure
[1:09:53] that that the service you offer whatever
[1:09:55] you deliver is in their opinion
[1:09:59] Perfection so here the prophet is saying
[1:10:01] come with
[1:10:02] determination come that you're going to
[1:10:04] stay till it's over stay there till God
[1:10:08] answers and vindicates are you willing
[1:10:10] to do whatever it takes are you willing
[1:10:12] to stick with it are you willing to stay
[1:10:14] there and do whatever it takes to get
[1:10:16] the result because the result isn't
[1:10:18] necessarily instantaneous you know I
[1:10:21] remember a story where the guy the bar
[1:10:23] and he was going and he say by his
[1:10:26] stripes I am healed by his stripes I am
[1:10:28] healed that was today he wasn't healed
[1:10:31] today or he didn't see the manifestation
[1:10:33] of the healing today the healing took
[1:10:36] place when he went through the line but
[1:10:38] the manifestation of that wasn't
[1:10:40] instantaneous it took some time to catch
[1:10:42] up to him so
[1:10:45] likewise it may not be one night you
[1:10:48] might have to stay two or five but are
[1:10:51] you willing to do whatever it takes amen
[1:10:54] y y you you may not have to pray for 10
[1:10:56] minutes you might have to pray for 10
[1:10:57] hours but are you willing to do whatever
[1:10:59] it takes remember what it takes for you
[1:11:03] might be different to your brother might
[1:11:04] be different to your sister right but
[1:11:07] are you willing to do whatever it takes
[1:11:09] that's the fight we talk we we talk we
[1:11:11] talking about this fight is not a a
[1:11:14] one-size fits all it's not a broad brush
[1:11:16] fight this fight is a custom bespoke
[1:11:18] fight that is customized to you that you
[1:11:21] have to overcome that you have to do
[1:11:23] whatever it takes for you to get the
[1:11:25] Victory and knowing that he will support
[1:11:28] you that he's got your back that he's
[1:11:30] got it covered so in that same paragraph
[1:11:33] there paragraph 55 he said come with a
[1:11:36] determination come that you're going to
[1:11:38] stay there till it's over stay there
[1:11:40] till God answers and vindicates a man
[1:11:42] that believes in God can see the
[1:11:44] presence of God feel the presence of God
[1:11:47] sense the presence of God and know that
[1:11:49] he's here he is here to answer
[1:11:51] everything that he made promise for in
[1:11:54] this day then cry till you get it hold
[1:11:57] on to him don't leave if you have to
[1:11:59] stay day and night God don't want his
[1:12:02] children to listen to intellectual
[1:12:03] speeches he want them to cry out to it
[1:12:06] till the promise is Vindicated Abraham
[1:12:09] here had a need of a sacrifice what
[1:12:11] happened God provided for him a lamb and
[1:12:14] that was God's provided way he needed a
[1:12:17] sacrifice so God provided it later on he
[1:12:20] called the place Jehovah Gyra the Lord
[1:12:22] will provide for himself for sacrifice
[1:12:24] now job one time the old Prophet job he
[1:12:26] was a prophet he had got in trouble
[1:12:28] Satan has desire desired to tempt him
[1:12:31] and he broke him out in boils and he
[1:12:34] taken his children he taken his struck
[1:12:37] he taken all he had and he broke him out
[1:12:39] in boils and his comforters come what
[1:12:42] did they do they provided nothing but a
[1:12:44] scorn tease him telling him why you have
[1:12:47] sinned secretly and job just held right
[1:12:49] on he cried out he was sure he was
[1:12:52] following God's Commandments he had done
[1:12:55] exactly what God promised to do what God
[1:12:58] pro promised him that he would stand by
[1:13:00] him under the burn sacrifice and he
[1:13:02] stayed there so God provided him a
[1:13:04] vision he was a prophet what did he see
[1:13:06] he saw the word Jesus Christ he said I
[1:13:09] know my redeemer liveth and at the last
[1:13:12] days he'll stand upon the Earth through
[1:13:15] the though the skin worms destroyed his
[1:13:18] body yet in my flesh I shall see God
[1:13:21] that is what we we referring to
[1:13:23] doing whatever it takes no matter what
[1:13:26] the circumstance how gloomy dark and
[1:13:28] black it may seem you do whatever it
[1:13:31] takes because the battle is the Lords he
[1:13:33] already assured you the victory and you
[1:13:36] fight and you struggle and you fight
[1:13:38] until you get the Breakthrough until you
[1:13:40] see the manifestation of that promise
[1:13:42] for your life
[1:13:43] amen oh my my my my Lord he saw the word
[1:13:48] and he know that his bones and his body
[1:13:50] was rise again in the last day he was
[1:13:52] questioned if he know where God was just
[1:13:54] skipping through here
[1:13:56] quickly you know he said a flower dies
[1:13:58] it rises up again a tree goes down it
[1:14:00] rises up again but a man lay it down and
[1:14:02] give it up the ghost He Wast away where
[1:14:04] is he oh that thou would hide me in the
[1:14:07] grave and keep me in the secret place
[1:14:09] till I wrath be passed then the Thunders
[1:14:11] began to Roar the lightning began to
[1:14:13] flash the spirit of the Lord came upon
[1:14:15] the prophet and he stood up and he saw
[1:14:17] the coming of the Lord and he screamed I
[1:14:19] know my redeemer liveth and at the last
[1:14:22] days he'll stand on the Earth though the
[1:14:24] skin worms destroy this body in my flesh
[1:14:27] I shall see God God provided the word
[1:14:30] Jesus Christ and he saw him and called
[1:14:33] him his Redeemer amen my my my just
[1:14:37] winding down here
[1:14:40] musician stepen you know we talk a lot
[1:14:44] about fighting about the Battle about
[1:14:46] achieving and accomplishing and God
[1:14:48] supporting but I just want to touch
[1:14:50] briefly on the
[1:14:52] opposition
[1:14:54] and I think it's serious and it says
[1:14:56] Satan will make you all kind of promises
[1:14:59] but he has nothing to give you because
[1:15:01] he don't have anything he doesn't have
[1:15:04] salvation what is Satan anything
[1:15:07] contrary to the word anything anything
[1:15:11] I'm not going to identify and Define
[1:15:14] anything contrary to the word is Satan
[1:15:17] he doesn't have salvation he doesn't
[1:15:19] have light his kingdom is Darkness this
[1:15:21] is from Oneness right 5 55 he said the
[1:15:25] end thereof is death darkness and death
[1:15:28] is Satan's kingdom brother Brandon
[1:15:30] repeat it again what is Satan's kingdom
[1:15:34] anything contrary to the word of God
[1:15:37] that is Satan's kingdom now that's
[1:15:39] cutting but it's time for cutting too
[1:15:41] yes see the branch the tree it's going
[1:15:45] to Bear if it's going to Bear it must be
[1:15:48] pruned it must be cut it must be shaved
[1:15:50] it's time anything contrary to the
[1:15:53] precepts of God the word of God is not
[1:15:55] God amen amen what is it what is sin
[1:15:59] righteousness perverted what is death
[1:16:02] life perverted what is the kingdom
[1:16:04] anything any teaching one word just one
[1:16:08] word you might believe every bit Eve
[1:16:11] believed every
[1:16:13] bit Eve believed every bit of it to that
[1:16:17] one word amen that one word is all she
[1:16:20] needed to
[1:16:21] disbelieve that one word is all you need
[1:16:24] to disbelieve and that's all I going to
[1:16:26] say about the opposition remember when I
[1:16:29] say he's masterful he's skillful so
[1:16:31] sometimes it's just one word you want to
[1:16:34] change one word you want to shift one
[1:16:37] word you want to use to try to confuse
[1:16:39] the whole thing and we know the story we
[1:16:40] know how how it went in the beginning
[1:16:43] Garden of Eden when he said listen shall
[1:16:45] not one word is all it took and that led
[1:16:50] into a ripple effect and we see the
[1:16:52] impacts of of it even today the the
[1:16:55] impact of one word so I would say we
[1:16:58] take that as a lesson to be cautious and
[1:17:00] careful we don't want to play games we
[1:17:02] don't want to do intellectual gymnastics
[1:17:04] and say well you know it's it sound good
[1:17:06] or know it it sound 99% correct I'm not
[1:17:09] sure about that part but it song He said
[1:17:12] listen if it's not 100% leave leave it
[1:17:15] alone leave it alone just one word we
[1:17:18] want to be wary of we want to be careful
[1:17:20] of we want to have discernment and no
[1:17:22] listen if it's not the word of God we
[1:17:25] staying away from from it if it's
[1:17:27] anything contrary to the word I Satan it
[1:17:30] doesn't matter how pretty it songs how
[1:17:32] how nice and and and oh my goodness it
[1:17:35] was so
[1:17:37] smooth it was silky boy it sounds so
[1:17:42] fantastic they were so
[1:17:44] articulate if it's anything contrary to
[1:17:47] the word of God Satan it might look good
[1:17:51] it might sound good it might smell good
[1:17:53] same Satan amen so as we conclude I say
[1:17:58] God has called us and he has
[1:17:59] commissioned us you can play something
[1:18:00] softly he's commission us to fight yes
[1:18:04] for every inch he is clearly defined the
[1:18:07] boundaries he's clearly defined what is
[1:18:09] ours he's identified Pro promises over
[1:18:12] and over and over it's up to us to catch
[1:18:15] a hold of faith and be able to cut it
[1:18:17] out for ourselves so healing is ours the
[1:18:21] Holy Ghost is ours an is ours salvation
[1:18:24] is ours I mean every promise every
[1:18:28] Redemptive promise of God we should be
[1:18:31] able to catch a hold of faith and claim
[1:18:33] it for ourselves and fight and do
[1:18:35] whatever it takes to ensure we fight for
[1:18:38] every in of ground knowing that the
[1:18:41] battle is the Lord's amen let's stand on
