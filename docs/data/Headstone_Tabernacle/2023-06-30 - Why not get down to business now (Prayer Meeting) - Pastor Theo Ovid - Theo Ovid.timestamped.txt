[11:55] teach me
[11:56] Teach Me
[12:05] that is Allah has desire that called the
[12:07] teachers
[12:08] wait
[12:10] you know
[12:12] if each one here tonight each one of us
[12:16] will wait upon the Lord I have waited on
[12:19] God
[12:21] many of the decisions we have made many
[12:23] of the actions
[12:25] we would not have done it
[12:28] because he will bring Direction
[12:30] guidance confirmation
[12:33] you would have you would have seen his
[12:36] hand
[12:36] more in your life
[12:40] a lot of things is because we haven't
[12:41] waited
[12:43] because we
[12:45] are free to choose and decide and act
[12:48] and God gave us that Liberty
[12:52] and based upon that Liberty we reap the
[12:55] fruit of our decisions we reach the
[12:57] fruit of our thoughts
[12:59] we read the fruit of our words
[13:01] and as we get nearer to The Headstone as
[13:04] we get nearer to this capping of the
[13:06] pyramid
[13:07] we need to wait upon the Lord let's bow
[13:10] our heads Heavenly Father we
[13:14] John wrote and said write on your
[13:17] children
[13:18] I write unto you young men
[13:20] I write unto you father
[13:22] it's a processes and growth
[13:25] from baby to child young men to fathers
[13:29] you want us to come into maturity
[13:32] you want us to come in fatherhood you
[13:35] want us to come that we can catch your
[13:37] mind for the prophet he was the eyes
[13:40] Lord he says there's no moving faculty
[13:43] past the eyes the next next is
[13:46] intelligence and I pray tonight your
[13:48] intelligence will come down and speak to
[13:50] us and minister to us on entrance into
[13:53] this Spirit of Prince application and
[13:56] ask him and seeking after you we thank
[13:58] you for all what you're doing all what
[14:00] you have done bless what we're going to
[14:02] read and share tonight and Jason may ask
[14:04] it email an email
[14:07] I was certainly blessed on Wednesday
[14:08] night
[14:09] uh by what Bulgarian shared about uh
[14:13] after the training is completed
[14:15] there's some people not going for
[14:17] trading at all so they're not even
[14:19] reaching that completion part
[14:21] because training has to do with
[14:23] discipline
[14:24] it's a discipline to attend this virtual
[14:27] permit internet you could do other
[14:28] things
[14:29] but this is what discipline is about the
[14:33] systematic rhythmic consistent Behavior
[14:36] has required of user discipline so we
[14:40] want to go in the world tonight and I
[14:41] want to just take two portions of
[14:42] scripture one from Luke 16 16. a
[14:46] scripture that we know
[14:47] and also from Jeremiah 29
[14:50] it's 10 to 13. just want to get
[14:53] and um
[14:56] this thought I have for tonight is why
[14:58] not get down to business why not
[15:01] get down to business
[15:03] Luke 16 16 says the low on the prophets
[15:06] went to John
[15:07] and since that time the kingdom of God
[15:10] is preached and every man presses into
[15:12] it
[15:13] not just simply walk into it easily
[15:16] where the brand says but there's it's
[15:17] got to be pressed into see when you seek
[15:20] me with all your heart now before
[15:23] Jeremiah 29 verse 10 says for thousand
[15:27] the Lord
[15:28] after 70 years be accomplished at
[15:30] Babylon I will visit you and perform my
[15:33] good word towards you and causing you to
[15:36] return to this place
[15:37] for I know the thoughts that I think
[15:40] towards you share the Lord thoughts of
[15:42] Peace not of evil to give you an
[15:45] expected end
[15:47] and listen to verse 12. then this is God
[15:50] speaking now then shall you call upon
[15:54] and he shall go and pray unto me
[15:57] this is God's expectation this is called
[16:00] Cesar you shall go and pray unto me and
[16:03] I will happen unto you and you shall
[16:06] seek me and find me when you shall
[16:09] search for me with all your heart father
[16:12] May a blessed word in Jesus amen God
[16:14] bless you thanks again for being here
[16:16] tonight
[16:19] wow
[16:21] of something written here grumblers are
[16:24] you a grumbler or why now
[16:26] a complainer of for finer do you Mumble
[16:31] and Grumble
[16:33] of people who have Mumble and Grumble
[16:35] and the mumbles they say something
[16:37] indistinct and quietly making it
[16:40] difficult for others to hear so people
[16:42] know you're not happy and you mumbling
[16:44] words
[16:45] yeah I know whatever they say but you're
[16:47] mumbling you're seeing stuff
[16:49] but I want to share some of you tonight
[16:51] fate does not mumble
[16:54] Faith speaks
[16:56] fate looks for we
[16:59] Faith sees what is possible
[17:03] faith is never negative
[17:06] feet
[17:08] is always positive
[17:10] and people claim to have feet or their
[17:14] claims is to have
[17:16] revelation
[17:18] and by their behavior
[17:20] an attitude you could see they are short
[17:23] of what they are cleaning
[17:25] fate is revelation but it's revealed to
[17:28] you it causes you to look for we
[17:32] it causes you to see what is possible
[17:35] causes you to be positive
[17:37] that's what faith does
[17:39] scripture reading First Corinthians 10.
[17:42] we read
[17:43] let me consume it if you want to yes or
[17:46] just listen
[17:47] moreover brethren
[17:49] I would not that you would be ignorant
[17:51] hold at all our fathers were under the
[17:53] cloud and all passed through the sea
[17:56] we're all baptized into the Moses in the
[17:59] cloud and the Sea so always in the
[18:01] message all our books all updates all
[18:03] our pastors and all the nice churches
[18:04] and weakness and stuff right it only the
[18:07] same spiritual meat or drink the same
[18:09] spiritual drink and then drank of that
[18:11] spiritual rocket follow them the
[18:12] proposed Christ but there are many of
[18:14] them
[18:15] God was not well pleased
[18:19] for they were overthrown in the
[18:21] wilderness
[18:22] and the Wilderness is not a destination
[18:24] the willingness is the environment of
[18:26] tests the Wilderness is on the way to
[18:29] the promised land
[18:31] with six and these things were or
[18:34] examples to the intent we should not
[18:36] lust after evil things as they also
[18:38] lusted neither be either at us as some
[18:41] of them were some of them has written
[18:43] the people sat down to eat and drink
[18:45] and it was up to play
[18:47] neither let us commit fornication as
[18:49] some of them committed and fell in one
[18:52] day three
[18:53] and twenty thousand neither let us stem
[18:55] crisis some of them also tempted I will
[18:58] destroy the serpents
[19:00] are some of the emotional members I'm
[19:03] gonna destroyer of the Destroyer
[19:05] listening spot now all these things
[19:08] happen unto them
[19:10] for examples
[19:11] and they are written for our admiration
[19:15] upon whom the end of the will come
[19:18] wherefore let him not think that he
[19:21] stand there take care less he fall
[19:24] here we go verse 13. this is what I want
[19:27] to get to they had no temptation taking
[19:30] you
[19:31] but what is coming to man
[19:33] but God is faithful
[19:35] who will not suffer you
[19:37] to be tempted above that he are evil
[19:42] but will
[19:43] with the Temptation also make a way to
[19:46] escape that you may be able to dare
[19:50] so we complain about the Temptation or
[19:53] the test or the enticement to sin
[19:57] but you're not looking at with every
[20:00] enticement to sin
[20:02] every test every temptation
[20:05] God makes a way of Escape let's look at
[20:10] the scripture in verse First Corinthians
[20:12] 10 13 and the Amplified and I think it
[20:15] it really uh expands it
[20:18] okay let's go First Corinthians 10 13.
[20:21] for no temptation
[20:23] no trial regarded as enticement enticing
[20:27] to sin no matter how it comes or where
[20:31] it leads has overtaken you and laid hold
[20:34] on you that is not common to man that is
[20:37] no temptation of trial has come to you
[20:40] that is beyond human resistance
[20:44] that is their human resistance and that
[20:46] is not adjusted and adapted and
[20:48] belonging to Human Experience
[20:50] and such as man can bear
[20:52] but God is faithful to his word and to
[20:56] his compassionate nature and he can be
[21:00] trusted not here we go not to let you be
[21:04] tempted and tried and a seed beyond your
[21:08] ability and strength of resistance and
[21:12] power to endure
[21:13] but with the Temptation he will always
[21:17] always wish I would always he will
[21:20] always also provide the way out the
[21:24] means of escape to a landing place that
[21:27] you may be capable and strong and
[21:31] powerful to Bear up under it patiently
[21:35] like we say he may not take away the
[21:37] storm but he gives you peace he may not
[21:41] take away the Affliction but he gives
[21:43] you Grace okay
[21:45] let's go quickly now
[21:48] you can't purpose anything of God's
[21:51] promise in your heart
[21:52] without finding the reality to it
[21:55] listen to how this was a place you can't
[21:57] poop us not hearing and understanding
[22:00] and knowledge information but we're
[22:02] talking about purpose now anything of
[22:04] God's promise in your heart without
[22:06] finding the reality again if your soul
[22:09] has been tormented by sins and doubts
[22:13] ups and don'ts and frustrations and
[22:16] there is something done in you that is
[22:18] telling you that there is somewhere you
[22:21] can overcome that why do you throw the
[22:24] wrong from church to church from place
[22:26] to please just kneel down till you
[22:30] strike heaven
[22:31] as I said last night go beyond the song
[22:34] barriers then you'll have a purpose in
[22:37] life you will have a purpose and
[22:39] belonging to the church you'll have a
[22:41] purpose in being baptized you will have
[22:44] a purpose in what you are seeking for
[22:46] cause we know that God is honest God is
[22:51] true and God cannot lie
[22:54] if you need any need whatever that God
[22:56] has promised in this Bible he's here
[22:58] tonight to meet that need no need if she
[23:01] can feel that his presence is here his
[23:04] spirit is here and he is willing here we
[23:06] go he is willing already and longing to
[23:11] give to you what you are seeking for
[23:15] why would you wait any longer or hear
[23:19] this part when you come to him
[23:22] don't come as a floater
[23:25] I'll go up and try and see if it works
[23:27] you will never get nowhere
[23:30] when you come with this kind of a
[23:33] determination
[23:35] that you have sold out Lock Stock and
[23:38] Bar
[23:39] when you are tired of the world and sin
[23:42] and unbelief and frustration and doubts
[23:45] and come to the Living God with an
[23:48] anchor surely tightening the Rock of
[23:50] Ages the holy spirit is here to pull you
[23:53] into the presence of the Living God and
[23:56] that will give you a faith that you
[23:59] overcome anything else in the world
[24:01] sickness disease and even that itself
[24:05] you see when he said when you come with
[24:07] that kind of determination what does the
[24:09] bible see if it is it is the substance
[24:13] of things were for the evidence of
[24:15] Things Not Seen freezer he that
[24:17] committed God commit to God like we are
[24:19] doing tonight must believe that he is
[24:22] and that he is a rewarder of them that
[24:25] diligently or passionately or
[24:27] enthusiastically or persistently or with
[24:30] a determination seek it after him
[24:33] you shall find me strictly read when you
[24:36] seek me with all of your heart
[24:40] no watch
[24:41] he says
[24:43] you said you said that brother Branham
[24:45] that's what I meant that was it not
[24:48] Lazarus lame dead I've never heard this
[24:50] before I want to say it again tonight I
[24:52] fell a lot to do this tonight was it not
[24:54] Lazarus who was laying dead in the
[24:56] ground and already corruption set when
[24:58] Jesus at the master way have you buried
[25:00] him if you want doubt you shall see the
[25:02] glory of God did not I tell you not a
[25:05] doubt he said to Jairus that night or
[25:07] that day if you only believe you can see
[25:09] the glory of God
[25:11] then fit overcomes debt fate is the
[25:14] victory overcomes debt fate is the
[25:17] victory over sin faith is the victory
[25:20] over sickness faith is the victory over
[25:22] worry fate is a victory over
[25:25] frustrations fate is the victory over
[25:27] the world you say John when he wrote
[25:31] that he didn't have my troubles he
[25:33] didn't have to deal with the folk that I
[25:35] deal with he didn't have to go through
[25:37] the things that I do all right but again
[25:39] said he said when this is
[25:43] nice when he passes exam to get his
[25:46] license when I stole him go and learn to
[25:48] drive
[25:49] you only get the path the authority to
[25:52] be on the road but the training doesn't
[25:55] teach you in the driving at night it
[25:57] doesn't teach you when it's raining but
[25:59] you have the tools I want to share with
[26:01] you tonight God put something in you to
[26:04] resist sin to resist temptation God put
[26:07] tools in you you have the tools and we
[26:10] want to show you by the word tonight
[26:12] what God is expecting of you that you
[26:15] could ride over it who is it now he may
[26:18] not have had to deal with the same folk
[26:20] Dr John he may not have had to overcome
[26:23] the same thing but he never excluded him
[26:25] for he said the Fate is the victory that
[26:28] overcomes the world the whole thing how
[26:31] is it get fit right above it when we
[26:34] have the written word of God laying
[26:36] before us and the Holy Spirit here
[26:38] performing and showing the resurrection
[26:40] of the Lord Jesus with Divine promises
[26:42] written here whatever desire When you
[26:45] pray believe you receive it you shall
[26:47] have it what do you do then have fit not
[26:50] just floating feet as a new one so you
[26:54] have something called floating feet not
[26:56] just make believe fit but a real fit and
[26:59] we read this thing last Sunday Feed is a
[27:01] conqueror feed is an overcomer it isn't
[27:04] a peacemaker it's overcome fate is a
[27:06] victory that overcomes the world what
[27:09] does it do what is Faith it's a
[27:11] conqueror conqueror and victory is the
[27:13] same to Hong Kong means to beat down to
[27:16] override to handcuffs to train to prison
[27:18] it means that the sin that want to rule
[27:21] you you let me know it means that you
[27:23] have overcome it you whipped it you are
[27:25] greater than it and faith is the victory
[27:28] that overcomes Every curse of the devil
[27:31] features the victory feed is what faith
[27:34] in what not faith in your church not
[27:36] faith in your Creed not feeding some man
[27:39] but faith in Jesus Christ who made a
[27:41] promise that's the victory what is it
[27:43] my arm is so crippled but fit is a
[27:46] victory I still feel sick but fate is a
[27:48] victory it overcomes the world when you
[27:51] can climb into God and I'm saying that
[27:53] I'm believing that tonight by prayer
[27:55] until you see the thing conquered under
[27:58] you there's nothing that can hurt you
[28:00] then you have overcome you got 15 miles
[28:04] of Elbow Room you are still in Freedom
[28:06] how many you want to get some Elbow Room
[28:08] tonight freedom from Devils from
[28:10] frustration from all kind of contrary
[28:12] influences just Elbow Room that you can
[28:14] move up push it to God
[28:16] okay
[28:18] and this is the part I want to get to
[28:20] tonight to wrap up this whole thing
[28:21] where I get this taught from why not get
[28:23] out of business
[28:25] but Ram speaks
[28:27] a little woman that's sitting present
[28:29] now
[28:30] so he was talking about somebody that
[28:31] was right there
[28:33] in the service
[28:37] she has been at this altar Time After
[28:41] Time After Time a good woman
[28:44] but she started smoking a long time ago
[28:48] she just couldn't overcome it
[28:51] but she had come up and I would pray
[28:54] with her
[28:55] and seemed like she just couldn't
[28:57] overcome it
[28:59] and the first thing you know I told her
[29:01] I said there'll be Deja down the road
[29:05] he didn't show all the church

[31:57] Spirit seemed to move us the war way up
[31:59] and there she was when I got there she
[32:02] had a dream

[32:06] room she got down to real business
[32:10] here we go she never smoked a cigarette

[32:17] of Wheat and they can't find a trace of
[32:20] cancer
[32:21] what is it
[32:23] it is feet that overcome
[32:26] Why didn't it overcome
[32:29] when I was praying for her question he
[32:33] prayed you need hands you encouraged her
[32:35] she got the altar she's a regular old
[32:38] alcohol person always up there

[32:44] praying for here
[32:46] she was just fluttering around
[32:50] but when the doctor said you got cancer
[32:53] you're going to die
[32:55] she got to business and that's the way
[32:59] it has to to get when you get to
[33:02] business why read that wrong
[33:05] why not get down to business no I'm
[33:07] using that why not get onto business
[33:08] tonight
[33:09] put your feet in God or hear this bomb
[33:12] here what if the woman had feet I'd have
[33:16] faith in me it will feel because I'm a
[33:20] man and watch this now this is so good
[33:23] the prophet prayed for he lay hands upon
[33:25] her and what if her confidence was in
[33:28] him he led her upon me and this happened
[33:31] who touched her with that he says watch
[33:35] what if the woman had a faith in me it
[33:38] will feel because I'm a man but when she
[33:41] changed her feet not in the brand of
[33:44] Tabernacle or in William Branham or in
[33:48] someone else but please a fit in Jesus
[33:52] Christ then she got feet she reads up
[33:55] over her fears don't and God healed her
[33:58] feet is the victory
[34:00] and I'll close with this
[34:03] he was speaking about the woman that had
[34:05] the dead baby in Mexico
[34:07] and she didn't want to bury a baby she
[34:09] held on to the baby because she saw that
[34:12] somebody else was here and different
[34:13] things like that and she was talking
[34:15] about she'll run right under the top of
[34:16] the shoulders fall right down among them
[34:18] she would gain a few feet then try to
[34:21] put her back out she'll come right
[34:23] between their legs holding this baby
[34:24] upsetting ushers and everything else
[34:27] she was getting up there she had to get
[34:30] there it didn't make any difference she
[34:32] was going to get there
[34:34] now when the same desperation Rises it
[34:38] will true love and feet up there in the
[34:40] Battlefront to claim what you want
[34:43] because it's a promise of God that you
[34:45] can have it I turn to the minister or
[34:48] evangelist at the place I turn I felt
[34:51] sorry for the woman
[34:52] but there was no desperation right till
[34:54] I thought well but a jack will pray for
[34:55] her that settle it as I was speaking now
[34:59] I looked there and there was a vision so
[35:02] all of a sudden a vision broke to him I
[35:04] seen a little baby sitting there a
[35:06] little black face Mexican baby with no
[35:08] teeth he was laughing at me said no
[35:10] there I said wait a minute
[35:11] wait a minute
[35:13] oh he had a point here now her
[35:16] desperation
[35:17] drove the Holy Spirit
[35:20] to change my subject
[35:22] change my eyes and show me her
[35:26] babysitting there
[35:27] that sent the spirit back I said prison
[35:29] energy wait a minute bring me the baby

[35:36] white blanket a little dead form about a
[35:38] lot long she fell with her crucifix in
[35:41] her hand or rosary and say healing Mary

[35:45] necessary and she can't close away while
[35:48] she scream Padre which means father I
[35:49] said don't say that don't say that do
[35:51] you believe he said in Spanish to her
[35:54] and she said yes she believed he asked
[35:57] her how she would believe she said if
[35:59] God can give that old man his sight he
[36:01] can give my baby the light
[36:03] desperation
[36:05] Drew over to it not a thing in my part I
[36:09] just saw the vision I said Lord Jesus I
[36:12] saw a vision of this little baby it
[36:14] might be this one and that kind of kick
