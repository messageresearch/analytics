how you dealt with Lord lives just like always men of like passions men of like trials and testicles and tribulations and challenges and I pray you would come into your word tonight and agreed on it Lord may we see things we have never seen before aspartame to how we ought to act and live do and pray Grant Lord this word become a president's reality to Every Soul here tonight and Jason we ask it amen God bless you and welcome it's a privilege to be here and I will excited about coming here tonight to share Allah wood with you tonight so you have your Bibles they're likely to turn to first king chapter 3. we want to read verse 5 to 14 First Kings chapter 3. and in verse 3 it had said and Solomon loved the law walking in the statute of David his father so this scripture David has passed on has gone on to be with the Lord that's King and Solomon I think he's a young man but with 2025 in his 20s early 20s and he is in this position following a mighty man King David we want to read from verse 5. in gibeon the Lord appeared to Solomon in a dream by night and God said ask what I shall give thee that's the title of what I want to share with you tonight ask what I shall give thee and let's continue through six and Solomon said Thou Art unto thy Susan David my father great Mercy according as he walked before the untruth and in righteousness and in uprightness of heart with thee doors kept for him discreet kindness God has given him a son to sit on his throne as it is this day and no oh Lord my God thou has made thy Stephen King instead of David my father and I am but a little child I know not how to go out or come in and thy servant is in the midst of thy people which thou has chosen the great people that cannot be numbered nor counted for multitude give therefore thy servant an understanding heart to judge that people that I may design between good and bad for who is able to judge this thy so greater people and the speech will stand please the Lord but Solomon and ask this thing and God said unto him because that was asked this thing and has not asked for thyself long life Lee has asked riches for thyself Noah asks the life of thy enemies but thou has asked for thyself understanding to discern judgment behold I have done according to thy words so this is like a pronouncement by God behold I have done according to thy words no I have given thee a wise and an understanding heart so that there was none like day before thee neither after thee shall any arise like unto thee and I have also given thee that which though has not asked both riches and honor so that there shall not be any among the Kings like under the in all thy days and if though will walk in my ways to keep my statute and my Commandments as thy father David did work then I will link me the idea may God bless his word again thank you for being here tonight and inside of this scripture here you have a lot of lessons Earth stuck inside of here and we just want to reflect on the fact that God could ask Solomon ask what I shall give him I'm in meditation I'm thinking about this tonight and bringing it to you I want to see what if God asks the same question to you do if God come down to you tonight right in your home right where you are and say ask what I shall give thee note David said no I mean Solomon no Lord my God always made thy Stephen King instead of leaving my father and I am a little child I know not how to go out and come in and this is a reflection of his humility how he he humbled himself how he is willing to say I don't know how to deal with this can you do that I want to read that to be Amplified First Kings 3 7 it says no Lord my God you have made your servant King instead of David my father but I am but a lad in wisdom and experience I know not how to go out to begin or come in to finish and you could see that David Solomon being David's son he would have been schooled properly he would have the best of Education he would have had the best of skill training fighting training whatever was the best because his father was King and he would have been schooled uh along the line of coming up into that room and yet when confronted with this great responsibility of sitting on the throne he finds himself saying um about a lot I don't have the wisdom and experience you know there's some people who don't like to say they don't know who don't like to admit they don't know they pretend they know they Bluff the way as if they know and they don't know but Solomon wasn't mixing matters here he said you don't know how to go I don't want to come in I need you second Corinthians 3 5 says not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think anything as of ourselves but our sufficiency is of God these are good scripture to meditate on and think over and they amplify the second Corinthians 3 5 says not that we are fit or qualified or sufficient inability of ourselves to form personal judgments or the claim or anything that's coming from us but our power and our ability and sufficiency are from God and this is the main route here so in other words Paul himself was expressing not relying on Whose ability you know some people like to do it and say I did it and I did it my way and I did it and there's a night and you know not going in like that Paul was expressing that his sufficiency comes from God or power on on our ability comes from God we have nothing to boost about in ourselves no challenge tonight God wants to give he is waiting for you to ask and I hope tonight that a vision is caught of the power of asking the power of Prayer the power of praying the right thing not praying for my selfishness or from just personal Vendetta because if you note that God told him you didn't ask for a long life you didn't ask for your the life of your enemies there are some people who want to get Vengeance they they don't want the conventions unto God they want to Revenge themselves and so think about it tonight is this as if God can't give until you ask the heavenly father knows what you have need of but yet you have to ask him it shall be given you seek and if you are fine you're knock on the door shall be open open so Solomon did not ask for riches honor recognition his name on a building and God says after Solomon Express his desire I he said I've done according to thy words so so could you imagine if God is to take your words tonight tonight what you will pray what you would ask and he could come down and say I have done according to thy words First Kings Four 29-31 read thus and God give Solomon wisdom an understanding exceeding much and loudness loudness of heart even as the sun that is on the seashore and Solomon wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of the East Country and all the wisdom of Egypt for he was wiser on all men than he found the Israelite and human and charcoal and Dada the sons of my heart and his theme was in all nations roundabout what this reflects is that Solomon had a right heart and you know many times people blame others they blame others for their status they blame others for the condition they're in they blame everything else and they can't seem to deal with themselves and if you note Solomon was trying to deal with what's on the inside it was an internal thing because he asked God let me see you again he says give dear for disabled an understanding heart to judge thy people no there are three main things knowledge understanding and wisdom if we call knowledge as information or facts then understanding will be comprehension or how do you understand it like you know you give a child a story to read and then they ask questions because what they want to know is not just that your child could read but does the child understand what he or she has read so then now on that third step which is wisdom is how to use knowledge or how to apply what you understand the facts that you know so therefore you need the knowledge you need the understanding and you need wisdom the wisdom went to clarify and bring into effect what you know and what you understand truly understand so let's continue so this speech and this prayer that Solomon prayed or spoke it please God so what what he said here now he said no and now oh Lord my God and Lord my God you have made your servant your king and and but I am Allard in wisdom and experience I know sometimes young people today they see them at all they feel they are done because they have two little piece of things inside their head and they feel that they carry them through but it's not that cannot what you know intellectually matter stuff that kind of take it through yeah something called wisdom and experience and that's what we want to get from God so God gave Solomon exceeding wisdom and equality no When Jesus and we Deputy some time ago when they asked him how to pray because they saw Jesus praying there's a reason and Jesus was a prayerful person he was in the spirit of prayer and Jesus in Matthew 6 said when you pray use them to be in repetitions as a human do for the things that they shall be heard for their much speaker be not eat therefore like unto them for here we go for your father note what things you are in need of before asking after this manner therefore praying so in other words he sort of give a template that's something that you use over and over not repetitively but the approach or Father which is in heaven there's nothing about you and your problems and your rent and you can't pay this on your school fees and your car shut down there's nothing to do with that or Father which art in heaven Hallowed be thy name in heaven and then verse 11 he said give us this day our daily bread no that tells me that God expects us to pray dearly every day because you eat every day your daily bread then forgive us all debts as we forgive our debtors this is Jesus praying Islam not not um not may we have also and grudges and academic get back at them with your mouth and you talk no I'm leaders not competition I find this is very humbling this is not uh I am the only Bridal I will stick your word and you know that kind of drama thing that kind of arrogant sometimes it comes across like lead us not into temptation but Deliver Us from evil for dying is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever and ever for if and you put like a clause here for if we forgive men they are trespasses trespasses your heavenly father will also forgive you but if you forgive not mend the trespasses neither will your father forgive your presence Luke 11 some scriptures tonight Luke 11 9 to 13 says and I said unto you asked shall be giving you seek you shall find knock it shall be open unto you but everyone that I could receive it he that she could find it to him that knock it shall be open and if a son shall ask better if any of you as the father or will he give him a stone question and if he asks a fish will eat a fish give him a serpent or if he asks for an egg will he offer him a scorpion Jesus making a cross-reference and then if he then being evil know how to give good gifts unto your children how much more style your heavenly father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him give the Holy Spirit ask what I shall give thee he put it right here where you have to ask for the Holy Spirit how much more prior Heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them not ask him so to get the knowledge to get the wisdom you have to pass through understanding to get the understanding you have to get the knowledge you can't understand what you don't know you have to get the knowledge and then you get the comprehension of the knowledge and that could that could give you the the wisdom to make the right decisions sometimes you have a lot of facts spoken away you have decisions to make what do you do but with the understanding of the facts or the information that come your way it puts you in a position to get wisdom and be wise to make healthy and correct decisions knowledge is fixed and you have to meet the mind of God with the knowledge of God so this intelligence that the bride's supposed to connect with there's no moving faculty past the eyes next the intelligence we as we believe part of this bright body that has to come in contact with chords mine or God's wisdom or God's love or God's intelligence we could only meet that with the knowledge of God you can't know nothing about God and you're gonna meet the things of God it's not going to work that way that is why God gave us this piece of time this piece of half an hour if he could put it that way to get Seated on with this word let's continue Proverbs 3 almost done 315 says happy is the man that find that wisdom and the man that gets it understanding for the merchandise if it is better than the merchandise of silver she is more precious than rubies and all things Dawkins desire are not to be comparable James 1 5-7 if any of you lack wisdom let him ask God that give it to all men liberally and are braided not and it shall be given but let him ask and feed not delivering for you that River like the spirit of the sea driven with the wind and dust let not that man think that he shall receive anything of the Lord James 3 13 to 18 and I'm going to put this up afterwards I'm going to Senator that you could just go through the scriptures yourself and make it on these things James 3 says who is a wise man an endured with knowledge among you let them show out of good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom Amplified of that same scripture who is the among you who is wise and intelligent then let him by his Noble living show forth his good works with unobtrusive humility which is the proper attribute of true wisdom oh yeah so wisdom through wisdom now you have another time we talk about the truth we understand it positive the true wisdom is connected with humility what's the sign of the Holy Ghost first sign the prophecy of this Humanity verse 14 but if you have better envying and strife in your heart Glory not alignment against the truth this wisdom descended not from above but it's Earthly sensual devilish for where infinite Strife is there is confusion and every evil work but the wisdom that is from above is first pure then peaceful gentle and easy to be untreated full of mercy and good fruits without partiality but of hypocrisy and the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace and and I'm almost yeah honestly enough right okay Proverbs 9 purpose 4 out of 49 he taught me also and said unto me he wasn't man with his wisdom he taught me also I said unto me and let thine heart retain my words keep my Commandments and live get wisdom get understanding don't leave it on the table get it get wisdom can't understand forget that note these are decline from the words of my mouth forsake I'm not and she shall preserve thee love her and she shall keep thee wisdom is the principle thing wisdom is the principle thing therefore get wisdom and get all that getting get understanding so we have to come up with those three things getting wisdom principally to its step getting understanding Second Step getting the knowledge and knowledge of God ExAlta she shall promote thee she shall bring it to honor when thou Dost impress her she shall give to thine head an ornament of Grace a Crown of Glory shall she live unto Dee so I want to say tonight Salman I'm a right heart as a Young Man what kind of heart do you have tonight yeah some people like to hear what the rules but not to keep the rules to break the rules to get around the rules when you see somebody saying this one doing this they weren't doing their stuff they don't want to know what God's really is that's what Israel did this one of a king that one other thing we want a king and God was the king I want to close with this physical from the profit for the problem speaking about Joe remember job had no Bible to reason his day no he only went by inspiration he was a prophet to whom the word of the Lord comes to he had only to be inspired because you know this position that he was gross prophet and the only thing that had to happen was for the inspiration to strike him then he knowed what he said would happen because it was by inspiration here we go and that's what the church if it is in order such an order it's got the mechanics ready it only needs them Dynamics if this is what the prophet said you know tonight if we will get the mechanics ready get our hearts right and then he says the things that we can do follow every word following in baptism for them in every order he told us to do get everything your mechanic ready and stand there 10 we're ready for Dynamics to be let off and only God can do that and that is to let to drop into your heart that feet that say I love you so friends inclusion tonight the thing about it a lot of people are religious they're not spiritual they're really religious they like go to church they like the atmosphere you know it's religion is not an internal where you want this faithful experience that experimental experience in the heart because we are I would call it in a modern age a knowledgeable age where we could read and write no really matter YouTube you can learn anything technology is there and we could get away from the hard part of things and you could see that Solomon could have asked for what these politicians would ask for today they want to match our fancy cars and plane and as soon as they get a position they want this they want that things things just things Solomon didn't ask for things he asked for understanding tougher understanding what was God could you please work with me give me what it would take to deserved give me what it takes to understand right from wrong not to go by my feelings you know one and you could buy your feeling and you're feeling hate me feeling different it's just feeling you're not asking this is God's will this is God's plan this is God order or not because that training Garden was not feeling the day of field the day of field noisy a day either of that day you die it was a choice it was a decision to leave it alone because God said so and we have things to come back to that spot where we could acknowledge and say you know what God said it that's it that's it I believe it and I live on it just like that so I want to encourage you tonight because God could come down and says and say asks what I shall give thee what do you want what do you really want a new husband a new wife what kind of children it was a new house a new car another car Theresa P more money what do you want because it will come down to what you have in your heart is what gonna come out in your prayer what you're going to pray may you be blessed tonight Express to God the right thing that God could say I am pleased because you have prayed the writing note because Solomon did not ask for riches an honor and humor whatever God said listen you didn't ask relations but I'm going to give it to you because of what you asked for God's people what kind of heart that you where is your burden for the things of God and the people of God it's a burden you know it's a bulletin it's a bulletin not many people have that and when you're connected the burden of God something try to prayer because prayer becomes your key and and go to Osama let him come let me just find this back quickly no spelling what God told Salman because of your words a message and I said God wants to give he's waiting for you to ask if you pray in love my family the family family what kind of Praise is that is that selfish you is he seem selfish heart the selfish Spirit you're operate from a level of selfishness and it reflects in your prayer what did God tell him behold I have done according to thy words I have given thee a wise understanding what if you could ask for to give a reboot tonight you're like a computer virus the computer what kind of stuff and sometimes you need a reboot and things that sort yourself out and I say Lord you know what flip me over tonight and give me a fresh breed of fresh intake that I wouldn't really just pray I prayed before but I've prayed sincerely from my heart that is bald heads tonight heavenly father I was thrilled when I saw this and I couldn't wait to share this with your people tonight and I trust that they would see it that you could come to a man a young man and said ask what I shall give thee and that young man broke the trend he didn't ask for sneakers for shoes for a new flashy calf a new flashy distance that an airplane and more money and credit cards and lie here and go there and do this and show off and parade his beef he didn't answer that he asks for understanding heart what a prayer what a request I mean you father was so pleased that you said I've given it to you that is what you asked for knowing that I'm gonna give you what you didn't ask for God bless these people tonight may they receive the word as God may they receive this tonight and may they be blessed by receiving it I may it be blessed in prayer hear an answer to my prayer and she said my basket amen and
