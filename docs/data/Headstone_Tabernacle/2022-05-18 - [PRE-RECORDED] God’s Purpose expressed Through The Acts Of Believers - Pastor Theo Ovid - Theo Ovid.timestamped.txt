[18:21] who's somebody
[18:23] and we are only where we are but the
[18:24] grace of god
[18:27] we are in the palm of his hand
[18:29] if you move it before
[18:31] so be careful you're in the palm of his
[18:32] hand if you shift it you're going to
[18:34] fall
[18:35] so you're here by the grace
[18:38] of god
[18:43] do you know what a revival is
[18:45] a revival is
[18:47] a move of god
[18:49] in power
[18:52] not man moving
[18:53] [Music]
[18:55] god moving
[18:57] that's what the prophet said the revival
[18:58] is what say it after me a move
[19:01] of god
[19:03] in power
[19:05] not in talk
[19:07] in power
[19:09] power to cast out devils
[19:11] power to heal the sick
[19:13] power for sinners to come at the altar
[19:15] power of the people around the altar
[19:17] without even making an altar call
[19:19] that's a move of god
[19:21] not a man move
[19:23] but a god move
[19:25] and when god decided to move no man
[19:27] could stop him
[19:29] no one could hinder him
[19:30] when god decided to move on your life
[19:33] or your family life
[19:34] nothing going to stop it
[19:37] because your season has come
[19:40] your hour has come
[19:42] and when your overcome nobody can change
[19:44] that
[19:45] stop that rearrange that what god bless
[19:48] no man
[19:52] oh
[19:53] i am happy this morning
[19:55] where would i be where would you be but
[19:58] for the grace
[19:59] of god you have something to shout about
[20:02] you have activity in your limbs you
[20:04] could tell stand up you can still raise
[20:06] your hands
[20:07] you can still shake your neck a little
[20:09] bit
[20:10] praise god
[20:12] hallelujah praise god
[20:16] hallelujah
[20:18] you still have something to shout about
[20:22] sit down
[20:25] you may have failed god
[20:26] you may have sinned
[20:28] but i don't think you have committed the
[20:30] unpardonable sin
[20:31] so there is still room for blood there
[20:34] is still room for redemption
[20:36] there is still room for restoration
[20:38] i don't think you will be here if you
[20:40] are committed unpardonable sin
[20:43] because you're here this morning i mean
[20:44] there's a desire in your heart
[20:47] to be reconciled to god
[20:49] and to get closer to god
[20:51] and once there's a desire in your heart
[20:54] there's a god that could meet you
[20:56] and meet that desire
[20:58] that's in your heart
[20:59] [Applause]
[21:01] amen
[21:04] so last sunday
[21:05] we had by these precious
[21:08] revealed
[21:09] promises
[21:11] of the title the subject was partakers
[21:13] of his divine nature
[21:15] and the inspiration was possessing your
[21:18] individual inheritance
[21:20] this is the challenge here
[21:22] that last one
[21:23] possessing your individual inheritance
[21:26] because what people have learned for the
[21:28] past hundred years or two these two
[21:30] changes thing
[21:31] is is a group thing
[21:33] it's it's church thing
[21:35] and and sad to say it doesn't have that
[21:38] at the end of the day you have to say
[21:40] like caleb
[21:42] now therefore give me
[21:45] my mount amen
[21:48] amen
[21:49] there's a couple of things saturday
[21:51] no therefore
[21:52] right now
[21:54] give to me not them
[21:56] it's my own
[21:58] my means ownership
[22:01] mountain we have to take
[22:03] notice that give me my plane
[22:05] we just walk flat in it it's a mountain
[22:08] you have to look up
[22:09] you have to climb
[22:11] you have to make an effort
[22:12] the mount is not falling on you
[22:15] you have to take it
[22:16] it's not coming to you
[22:18] that is one mountain that's not moving
[22:20] that is mountain must be taken
[22:23] so you have to say i want it it's mine
[22:25] faith is mine come on virtue that's
[22:27] mine's true
[22:28] what about knowledge
[22:30] what about temperance what about
[22:32] patience
[22:33] what about godliness
[22:35] there's divine nature it's a mountain
[22:37] hallelujah
[22:39] and the higher your goal is the less
[22:40] people you see give it all a shout out
[22:45] you may be seated glory
[22:47] the higher you go
[22:49] the less people you see
[22:50] because it gets steeper
[22:52] it gets sharper you get more cuts
[22:55] you get more bruises you get more honing
[22:58] you get more tryouts because you're
[23:01] bringing forward fruit
[23:02] he has to prune you
[23:04] to bring forth more fruit
[23:06] you have to get much fruit is there
[23:08] people in the house this morning
[23:10] that want to give the lord a shout out
[23:14] oh hallelujah praise god
[23:16] hallelujah
[23:18] okay
[23:19] [Music]
[23:20] so your behavior is what sets you up to
[23:23] adoption
[23:26] that is why it's not only ministers
[23:27] going to be adopted
[23:29] they're going to be some sisters that
[23:31] are going to be
[23:32] adopted also
[23:34] my god
[23:36] and that those sisters they are not
[23:39] going to be preaching sisters
[23:41] they're going to be living sisters
[23:42] living
[23:43] [Music]
[23:45] there's not like mother teresa you know
[23:46] this is not that same thing you know
[23:48] this is living since hallelujah praise
[23:51] god do you believe that
[23:53] sons and daughters going to be adopted
[23:56] do you believe that
[23:58] hallelujah
[24:00] so this is just recapping
[24:01] but i want to just strike something
[24:03] small
[24:04] or just thinking about it or put
[24:06] interviews and i might have it all
[24:07] together but i'll just see what come to
[24:09] my mind
[24:10] sometimes you're going to interview
[24:12] everybody at the same qualification have
[24:13] a degree you have subject and so on but
[24:15] then they filter you
[24:17] further than that
[24:18] a little deeper than that because that
[24:20] is just intelligence
[24:22] passing papers and whatnot and job
[24:24] skills and stuff like that there's
[24:26] something called a psychometric test
[24:28] it's a big word
[24:30] it's not a common word but it's designed
[24:32] to test your behavior and tendencies
[24:35] because the people want the best people
[24:37] for their company they want to have the
[24:39] best fit
[24:40] so having the best qualifications
[24:42] doesn't mean you have the best fit
[24:44] you may not be you may be anti-social
[24:46] they may not want to mix with others you
[24:48] may be like to work solo
[24:50] and that job may cause for a non-solo
[24:52] worker
[24:53] you have to interact with many many
[24:54] people so they have these tests
[24:57] and they give stories acts a way of fit
[24:59] in the family if you get an accident and
[25:01] this happens how you're gonna behave and
[25:03] you don't know what they're looking for
[25:04] you just give answers
[25:06] and sometimes people feel that even
[25:08] though they have the degree and they
[25:09] have the qualifications but because of
[25:11] different personality issues and pro
[25:14] they want to profile you
[25:16] that is what they look for then they
[25:18] could snatch you up into the company and
[25:19] get the very best
[25:21] and the company only could be great as
[25:23] the people in it are great
[25:25] the company could only be powerful as
[25:26] the people that are powerful
[25:28] so these companies they want the best so
[25:30] let's flip it now our god he runs the
[25:33] company
[25:34] [Applause]
[25:38] a company of saints
[25:39] [Applause]
[25:40] hallelujah a company of believers
[25:44] people are qualified
[25:45] they have books they have tapes
[25:49] you may be seated
[25:50] they know what the prophet said they
[25:52] know what in this book and in this table
[25:54] and that book they qualify but then they
[25:56] have something called a psychometric
[25:57] test
[25:58] god doesn't have that name it have the
[26:00] behavioral test
[26:02] have a virtuous test my test and
[26:04] character so then the interviewer come
[26:06] and give her this trial and that trial
[26:07] to see how you gonna behave
[26:09] if they're gonna pass that test
[26:11] oh hallelujah is that who gonna talk the
[26:13] talk is we're gonna walk that talk
[26:16] oh glory to god that life really shakes
[26:18] up you know
[26:20] oh hallelujah
[26:21] oh praise the name of the lord do you
[26:23] believe that
[26:24] i wanted to get that to you it's a
[26:25] little more than written word
[26:27] so there's a more than saying i believe
[26:30] it's a little more than that
[26:32] we said the same power this is called
[26:33] somebody branham just summarizing for
[26:35] last week just to connect to this sunday
[26:37] same power when jesus rest in placed
[26:40] sons in the body of christ
[26:42] specific placed
[26:44] sons
[26:45] but ibrahim under the joshua commission
[26:47] took us over into the new holy ghost
[26:49] land
[26:50] on the back of the book he said break to
[26:53] us the seals on the back of the book
[26:55] because joshua entered in his land to
[26:57] divide the inheritance of the people so
[26:59] he put the back of the book the seven
[27:00] thunders as the new land of promise
[27:03] holy ghost man
[27:05] he went even deeper he said we are now
[27:07] living by the evidence
[27:09] of the new land
[27:10] the son of man
[27:12] so this salman is the evidence of the
[27:15] new land and the son of man is the word
[27:17] revealed
[27:19] so he malachi 4 came to introduce this
[27:22] tournament
[27:23] this sunderland was veiled in asana man
[27:25] so he's on boxes and tapes his mysteries
[27:28] hidden right there being unfolded to his
[27:30] elect
[27:31] so we are now even in 2016 living by the
[27:34] evidence of the new land
[27:37] we are now i'm saying again
[27:39] we are now
[27:40] living
[27:41] by the evidence of the new land
[27:44] somebody crossed over
[27:46] somebody went back and bring a testimony
[27:48] it has spoken word in it it has stopped
[27:50] any elements in it it have creation in
[27:53] it it has before the doctors and touches
[27:55] my wife the tumor will go down you have
[27:57] that in it
[27:58] and i have little fishy i give you back
[27:59] your life it's that resurrection and
[28:01] that somebody went over
[28:03] and brought a witness
[28:05] that we are not normal people we're not
[28:08] ordinary people we belong to a different
[28:11] class
[28:12] we belong to a god class
[28:15] [Applause]
[28:18] oh give the lord a shout
[28:22] you sit there looking at me normal
[28:24] normal normal and you are different
[28:25] blaster people all together why is god
[28:28] the bible said the people that know
[28:30] their god shall be strong

[28:35] sit there like you want nobody praise
[28:37] god wonder the best that's why he leave

[28:43] for tell somebody that you leave the
[28:44] best there's somebody there
[28:48] [Applause]
[28:58] [Applause]
[29:05] i know some of you are going to fight to
[29:06] see a man you know because you don't
[29:07] believe you're the best but that's not
[29:09] you judging that
[29:11] is that you judging yourself
[29:13] is that you call yourself
[29:15] is who he for you he called
[29:16] you can't feel like the best
[29:18] there's not a feeling job jesus never

[30:34] [Music]
[30:37] let me be seated
[30:39] oh hallelujah
[30:41] praise god
[30:43] still trying to find myself here amen
[30:46] so this promised land
[30:48] is to live in the land of the holy
[30:50] spirit
[30:51] and the guide was released
[30:53] by the prophet
[30:55] first 1966 that guide that he preached
[30:58] on was to guide us to a wonderful
[31:01] glorious
[31:03] baptism of the holy ghost where there is
[31:05] virtue and knowledge
[31:08] and temperance and patience and
[31:10] godliness
[31:11] and brotherly kindness
[31:13] no
[31:14] come like a child riding a bike you have
[31:16] to have extra wheel three wheel extra
[31:18] wheel because the child doing all the
[31:19] balance here after a while the two
[31:22] wheels at the side one will go on
[31:24] and then the other training will go on
[31:25] and the child is on his own
[31:27] then it's no more a conscious effort to
[31:29] ride
[31:30] it's a unconscious effort
[31:32] jump on the bike and ride
[31:34] but the child didn't automatically get
[31:36] there it had extra wheels to train him
[31:40] that he become accustomed to this
[31:42] movement
[31:43] well you can't just get them virtues and
[31:45] just get there you have to have some
[31:47] training wheels that exercise in wheels
[31:50] that you can exercise the virtue and
[31:52] exercise the patients and exercise your
[31:54] gut and exercise you have to have some
[31:56] training wheels you have to have an
[31:58] effort to ride that bike
[32:01] and after a while it will be operating
[32:04] in you
[32:05] from your subconscious level
[32:07] where you're not trying to be nice
[32:09] because you're a christian and you're
[32:10] supposed to be nice no no no you're just
[32:13] nice because you're just nice
[32:15] oh god give the lord a shout in the
[32:17] house
[32:18] oh hallelujah
[32:21] you may be seated hallelujah
[32:23] shall be talking about what we are
[32:24] preaching
[32:26] becoming ingrained in your spirit
[32:29] in other words the word started to
[32:31] become flesh
[32:32] said is that a ooze outside of you
[32:35] holla do you understand what i'm saying
[32:37] you choose not to be a church member
[32:39] they're just listening and just
[32:41] listening like they're just listening
[32:45] but you are elect
[32:48] that the word that you're hearing
[32:50] becomes a conductor of the spirit
[32:53] to get into your life
[32:55] because what you're hearing is at a
[32:57] mental level but there's a channel
[32:59] hallelujah that drops down from the mind
[33:01] to the heart
[33:02] [Applause]
[33:05] so but the brandon said the mind is the
[33:07] womb to the soul
[33:08] so you're not really here to be
[33:10] entertained you're not just here to be
[33:12] informed you're here to be in the spirit
[33:15] that this spirit could reveal his word
[33:18] to you
[33:20] or give the lord a shout our praise
[33:22] you may be seated are we going to go
[33:24] into scriptures
[33:25] so don't waste one minute of this
[33:27] service
[33:28] [Applause]
[33:31] let's do like this the last service
[33:32] you're going to hear
[33:34] hallelujah the wrath of god is about to
[33:36] strike and this is the last service you
[33:38] want every word
[33:40] when you leave here you can pray for
[33:41] your children when they leave you they
[33:42] can say devil get out right now
[33:45] you have to hear what i'm saying
[33:47] i don't have the power but i have the
[33:48] authority to cast you out
[33:55] [Applause]
[33:57] at this point before we approach the
[33:58] scriptures you have no enemies outside.
[34:04] don't blame your wife your husband your
[34:05] brother sister father mother uncle thank
[34:07] you
[34:08] boss neighbor nobody
[34:10] it's just you
[34:12] you and your demons
[34:14] [Applause]
[34:14] [Music]
[34:16] you and your struggles
[34:18] you and your battles that you're going
[34:20] to have victory over
[34:21] because before jesus was loosed under
[34:23] his word of adoption god loosed him into
[34:26] wilderness first
[34:27] nothing no crowd not with a bunch of
[34:29] decrees back and then jesus you can make
[34:30] it you can make it jesus i with you
[34:34] he was led by the spirit into the
[34:35] wilderness to overcome all by himself
[34:38] say after me all by myself
[34:41] that's how it's going to be good with
[34:43] lord a shout in the house
[34:49] when you overcome himself got to trust
[34:52] him
[34:55] [Music]
[35:01] here are the principles and laws but
[35:03] imam said usually when somebody gets
[35:04] blessed they get buffed up
[35:08] hit them
[35:10] there's somebody
[35:11] god only i don't drop him
[35:14] go testing them i'll drop a blessing now
[35:17] that drop from god is a big drop
[35:18] but it's still a drop you have a whole
[35:20] pointer
[35:21] a love and blessing deport upon you a
[35:23] little drop and all of a sudden
[35:25] you stop coming to church oh you know
[35:26] what i'm feeling
[35:28] you're up there somewhere so god looking
[35:30] for somebody the more he blesses
[35:33] is the more humble
[35:36] they become
[35:38] and for the ministry he said take a
[35:40] humble heart
[35:42] dedicated to god to bring jesus christ
[35:45] into present tense
[35:47] so all the promises are there waiting
[35:49] for faith in somebody's heart to make it
[35:51] come alive
[35:52] are you going to make it come alive
[35:54] but i branham said a minister cannot
[35:56] bring a revival
[35:58] so super preacher super personality
[36:00] that's finished
[36:02] holla waste of time
[36:04] try to hold on to some man waste our
[36:05] time don't even try that here
[36:08] the revival have to come by the people
[36:12] you have to bring the revival
[36:14] you got to know what's in you
[36:16] you have to be a revivalist
[36:18] you have to come to make something
[36:20] happen
[36:21] you have to come to start the fire
[36:24] if you had to hot the coals on the stove
[36:26] hot it on the stove
[36:27] but afterwards it'd have to catch a fire
[36:30] you have to blow
[36:31] [Applause]
[36:33] but do something
[36:34] don't let that fire go out
[36:37] don't let the fire i don't think a
[36:38] little i don't think burning soul a
[36:40] little smoke a little amen come and blow
[36:42] on it
[36:43] wave on it say amen on it shout on it
[36:47] but my god don't let the devil out the
[36:50] light that's in your soul
[36:56] [Applause]
[37:04] trying to get fast as i could
[37:07] [Music]
[37:10] in the early church
[37:11] god was the god of the audience
[37:14] god of the people
[37:17] they took god from the audience and put
[37:18] it on a man
[37:20] eventually become a pope
[37:22] god said i hate it
[37:24] i hate it
[37:26] the deeds of the nicolaitans where the
[37:29] laity suffers conquered
[37:31] and something came back to me with
[37:33] brother branham
[37:34] on the platform on the discernment
[37:36] watch this
[37:37] he's on the platform
[37:39] people get numbers and have to fight for
[37:40] numbers and get numbers to get in the

[37:45] sudden he's going to somebody and see
[37:46] the pillar fire move over there that
[37:47] woman across there so and so don't
[37:49] struck me god's the god of the audience
[37:52] god hell always nobody to interfere once
[37:54] the audience pulled that fire they have
[37:56] to get it
[37:57] so the prophet is up here
[37:59] but the audience
[38:00] fire pulling so he you have to move with
[38:02] the fire and i'm saying god is a god of
[38:05] the audience
[38:06] you could pull that fire
[38:08] you could pull that anointing you could
[38:10] pull your healing don't worry about the
[38:12] preacher
[38:14] don't worry about the preacher

[38:19] house

[38:33] even though the person on the platform
[38:35] god put prominence to what was happening
[38:38] in the congregation
[38:40] with faith pulling on the pillar of fire
[38:42] your faith could pull on that fire
[38:45] that god could give you what you have
[38:47] need of
[38:48] before you even go home
[38:50] the sick person that you have home
[38:53] they could be healed
[38:55] by your faith

[41:06] which i heard was it were a trumpet
[41:08] talking with me which said come up
[41:10] hither and i will show the things which
[41:13] must be here after and immediately i was
[41:15] in the spirit
[41:16] and behold the throne was set in heaven
[41:17] and one sat on the throne and he that
[41:19] sat was to look upon like a jasper and a
[41:22] sad line stone and there was a rainbow
[41:24] wronged about the throne in sight like
[41:26] unto an emerald wrong about the throne
[41:28] were 420 seats and upon the seats i saw
[41:30] 120 elders sitting clothed white raiment
[41:33] and they had on their heads crowns of
[41:35] gold and out of the throne proceeded
[41:37] lightnings and thunderings and voices
[41:40] and there were seven lamps of fire
[41:42] burning before the throne which are the
[41:44] seven spirits of god let's pray father

[41:49] inspire the word to our hearts this
[41:51] morning we wait on you with a pill of

[42:14] says i will stand up on my watch and set
[42:16] me up on a tower
[42:18] and will watch to see what he will see
[42:19] unto me and what i shall answer when i
[42:22] am reproved
[42:24] the lord answered me and said write the
[42:27] vision
[42:28] and make it plain
[42:31] upon tables
[42:33] that he may run
[42:35] that readed it
[42:36] for the vision is yet for an appointed
[42:39] time
[42:40] but at the end it shall speak and not
[42:41] lie do it terry whitfield
[42:44] it shall surely come
[42:46] hallelujah
[42:48] write the vision
[42:50] and make it plain
[42:52] well that's what brother branham came on
[42:54] to to do
[42:55] right to the bride of vision
[42:58] and over 40 50 plus years the vision
[43:01] was supposed to be made plain to the
[43:03] people
[43:04] that we could run
[43:06] that we could act
[43:08] not that we could just read
[43:11] but that we can do
[43:13] these are action words the secret things
[43:15] belong to god
[43:17] but the things that are revealed
[43:19] all these promises belong to us
[43:22] and to our children
[43:24] what's the purpose that we may do
[43:27] all the words
[43:29] of the law
[43:30] so the object is not just for
[43:32] informational purposes
[43:34] the object is to get us into action
[43:37] the object is to influence us to perform
[43:40] and to achieve
[43:42] and to fall into a channel of god's
[43:44] purpose
[43:45] and god's accomplishment
[43:48] that we can act as believers
[43:50] walk as believers
[43:52] talk as believers
[43:54] live as believers
[43:56] not unbelievers not make believers but
[43:59] as believers
[44:01] do you believe that
[44:02] oh glory to god amen
[44:06] so put a
[44:07] after the seals
[44:09] after all these great mysteries
[44:11] he came up and said this message going
[44:14] to summarize everything this one message
[44:18] and he preached the message called the
[44:19] token
[44:25] it's the greatest message and
[44:27] inspiration to preach
[44:28] he said was to talk and i want to just
[44:30] bring some things back there's a purpose
[44:31] that we're doing this
[44:32] this morning
[44:34] think about it now
[44:35] it had trumpets vials thunders seals
[44:39] mysteries
[44:40] and yet
[44:41] he zoomed into a target
[44:45] of the token
[44:46] when i see the blood
[44:48] i'm going to pass over you
[44:50] and that's the even time message
[44:53] is to apply the token

[44:57] to a bullseye

[45:01] things but what happened the gardener
[45:02] eden and information on the pope and
[45:04] rome and los angeles and all of that and

[45:10] but the target the bullseye what you're
[45:12] aiming at what you're longing for what
[45:15] you're pressing on to is the token

[46:58] hear music whole day
[46:59] that can't get you out

[47:08] that still can't get you out there's
[47:09] only one way out
[47:11] faith
[47:12] virtue
[47:13] knowledge
[47:14] diamond temperance
[47:16] patience
[47:17] godliness
[47:18] the same way enoch went out
[47:22] enoch walk
[47:24] with god
[47:27] and was not

[48:42] identification
[48:44] the blood
[48:46] watch
[48:47] that the worshiper had slain the lamb
[48:50] if there was no blood it mean the lamb
[48:52] alive and kicking
[48:54] the fact there's blood
[48:56] is because you killed the lamb
[48:58] you put your hands on the lamb and
[49:00] you're all bloodied up when i see the
[49:02] blood
[49:03] i'm gonna pass over you
[49:05] you have to kill the lamb to get the
[49:07] blood
[49:08] it means a price has been paid
[49:10] it means you apply to the doorpost
[49:12] because the death angel person
[49:14] not the pastor
[49:16] not the deacon not the church elder not
[49:19] some nice brother not some precious
[49:22] minister brother person it is that angel
[49:25] he's not asking what church you belong
[49:26] to he's not asking who your pastor is
[49:29] when i see the blood i'm gonna pass over
[49:32] you
[49:32] come on help me somebody help me preach
[49:35] that's my problem zoomed in

[50:03] token
[50:04] listen young people young people in
[50:06] particular
[50:07] everybody could have seen that talk
[50:10] and the dopplers yes

[1:03:02] and then in the beginning was the word

[1:03:34] you listen to what the words say you go
[1:03:35] to church you try to live right that's
[1:03:37] fine but that's not it
[1:03:38] when i see the blood
[1:03:40] that's the token i'm talking here watch
[1:03:42] he said moses time
[1:03:44] he had to see the actual chemistry
[1:03:47] because the life had gone it was an
[1:03:48] animal
[1:03:49] but now the life
[1:03:52] itself is the token
[1:03:54] not the books and
[1:03:56] tapes people get fight with me when i
[1:03:59] talk about books and things if i against
[1:04:00] books and tapes oh it could be a case
[1:04:02] book until i read it from the books
[1:04:07] but i'm saying having the books on tape
[1:04:08] on the bottom top of your head that's
[1:04:10] not the talk
[1:04:12] knowing where abraham said this and
[1:04:14] paragraph and page number and whatnot
[1:04:15] that's not the token
[1:04:17] other people used to write that off
[1:04:20] until the program come on the computer
[1:04:26] don't need to have that all in your head
[1:04:27] you could just do a research
[1:04:30] like long time you have all of my
[1:04:31] encyclopedias inside video set some big
[1:04:34] books on your juice one spin page like
[1:04:35] all these spinning pages like that
[1:04:38] no google just replace all of that
[1:04:43] that's what age we're living in
[1:04:45] god bring the pop the message right into
[1:04:46] your hands you have a phone number right
[1:04:48] there you can just get the message any
[1:04:49] code you want right inside your hands
[1:04:51] what do you think god wanted to decide
[1:04:52] how to read read read read
[1:04:54] you have to run
[1:04:56] had a conflict inside of you that's the
[1:04:58] problem everybody reading everybody
[1:05:00] knowing everybody quoting but who's
[1:05:02] going to live and thunder
[1:05:04] when they ever see them coming run run
[1:05:05] run look they come in they come and they
[1:05:11] somebody have a big spoken book sign up
[1:05:13] so they're definitely moving they will
[1:05:14] come and snap right back to them and he
[1:05:15] spoke on book two because i never
[1:05:17] believed in trembling so he had books
[1:05:19] everybody above never line up with them
[1:05:20] too but when that life starts to come
[1:05:22] the devil says wait wait wait
[1:05:24] wait wait wait wait wait wait wait
[1:05:29] hallelujah
[1:05:30] that's the thunder that
[1:05:33] takes the devil
[1:05:35] hallelujah there's coming a short quick
[1:05:36] message
[1:05:38] let's shake the whole nation
[1:05:40] oh hallelujah
[1:05:42] praise god what about him let me tell
[1:05:45] you today as a servant
[1:05:47] unless the token is on the door
[1:05:49] there is spiritual that's going to
[1:05:50] strike
[1:05:52] all churches are heading back for the
[1:05:55] council of churches
[1:05:56] they are all going back to catholicism
[1:06:00] and the only those who are genuine born
[1:06:02] again is going to stay out
[1:06:05] remember not your pentecostal
[1:06:07] denominations cause you're already in it
[1:06:09] show that they're dead they're perish
[1:06:11] they put him outside the door and he's
[1:06:13] looking for the token because the only
[1:06:14] thing they rely on speaking in tongues
[1:06:16] don't you rely upon not speaking in
[1:06:18] tongues no nothing else but let the
[1:06:20] token itself be there
[1:06:22] and he says the person of jesus christ
[1:06:26] his own life in you
[1:06:29] so friends we have no room to gossip
[1:06:33] to be indifferent
[1:06:35] to to lose time and be distracted
[1:06:38] we have to have a burden to receive the
[1:06:40] life
[1:06:42] of jesus christ
[1:06:45] what do you do when you apply to your
[1:06:46] house what do you do
[1:06:47] move all the trash out
[1:06:49] you get all the short skirts
[1:06:51] the cards
[1:06:52] the cigarettes the televisions you kick
[1:06:54] them out the door when you apply the
[1:06:56] token won't stand still for it take it
[1:06:59] out all the dancers parties rock and
[1:07:01] roll falcon newspapers all the stuff of
[1:07:03] the world cater out the door and say we
[1:07:05] are cleaning out the place
[1:07:08] along here
[1:07:10] so to apply the token
[1:07:11] is to do something about your situation
[1:07:15] just like the coin of brotherly kindness
[1:07:16] to find that coin you have to clean up
[1:07:18] the place because that point was lost
[1:07:20] and you want to find your brotherly
[1:07:21] kindness
[1:07:22] right fine you have no kindness
[1:07:23] whatsoever
[1:07:24] brotherly or sisterly otherwise
[1:07:26] so the coin lost
[1:07:28] so you need to find that coin
[1:07:30] and baram says she began to sweep the
[1:07:32] floor and scrapped up she kept until she
[1:07:34] found it when she found her she called
[1:07:36] her sisters and her brother churches
[1:07:37] come and rejoice
[1:07:39] with me i found a coin if they don't
[1:07:42] wanna rejoice that is their business but
[1:07:44] you you found your coin
[1:07:46] hallelujah they're not happy with you
[1:07:48] unhappy for you that is their problem
[1:07:51] but you are rejoicing because you could
[1:07:53] forgive now
[1:07:54] you could you could drop your orcs now
[1:07:57] you could call for charity now when you
[1:07:59] stand praying for him
[1:08:01] the person the talk and the holy ghost
[1:08:03] you have no oughts in your heart
[1:08:05] then you're ready for the holy ghost
[1:08:07] because god gave the holy ghost to them
[1:08:09] who obey him
[1:08:10] and the blood for the age is brotherly
[1:08:12] kindness so we're going to make sure to
[1:08:14] have enough around you enough people to
[1:08:16] match your corn if you have people to
[1:08:18] hurt you in different ways to see what
[1:08:21] you're going to do he's not testing them
[1:08:23] he is testing you
[1:08:26] hear what i'm saying this morning
[1:08:28] oh give the lord some praises let me say
[1:08:31] it again he is not testing them they are
[1:08:34] there to hurt you they are just
[1:08:36] inflicting on you and you are there to
[1:08:38] act like christ father forgive them they
[1:08:41] don't know what they are doing or give
[1:08:43] the lord some praises in the house
[1:08:54] jesus on the cross
[1:08:55] nails in his hands
[1:08:57] fire abundant
[1:09:01] bunch of rascals i raised the dead i
[1:09:03] healed his sick i feed him with bread
[1:09:05] and fish look at them ungrateful people
[1:09:08] [Applause]
[1:09:12] no no he may have rights to do that
[1:09:16] a good thing
[1:09:20] good thing is jesus christ
[1:09:22] but in that pain
[1:09:24] in that suffering
[1:09:26] he expressed something
[1:09:28] because it was the key for the
[1:09:29] resurrection
[1:09:31] he is moving into power
[1:09:33] he's suffering he's in pain but he's
[1:09:35] still living the blood for his age
[1:09:37] voice for his age bradley kindness
[1:09:40] because resurrection power is next
[1:09:42] and when we hit that stop step
[1:09:45] we go into the prison of the king
[1:09:47] because bradley khan is the top of the
[1:09:48] pyramid given the right to enter into
[1:09:51] the king's chamber
[1:09:52] like queen esther
[1:09:54] with the scepter of authority
[1:09:57] and dominion whatever you want queen
[1:09:59] esther up to half my kingdom oh
[1:10:02] hallelujah praise god
[1:10:04] but you have to be on a platform of
[1:10:06] forgiveness
[1:10:07] no hearts
[1:10:09] no grudges
[1:10:10] no jealousy
[1:10:12] no envy
[1:10:13] just a cleaned out life waiting for your
[1:10:16] lover your husband
[1:10:18] your mate even christ
[1:10:21] the revealed word to come to you
[1:10:23] oh glory to god
[1:10:25] but obama said we'll take more than the
[1:10:27] power of gifts
[1:10:28] it will take more than joining church
[1:10:31] it will take the birth of the holy
[1:10:33] spirit to break down our walls and to
[1:10:36] unite us together as one great christian
[1:10:38] body
[1:10:39] moving for one objective
[1:10:42] and one goal
[1:10:43] let's continue
[1:10:45] hallelujah
[1:10:47] from what
[1:10:48] what does it take to make a christian
[1:10:50] life
[1:10:51] god
[1:10:53] intended his church
[1:10:54] to be a powerful church
[1:10:58] a glorious church
[1:11:00] a church
[1:11:01] that the whole world could look upon as
[1:11:03] a bride of christ
[1:11:05] well expected and exposed
[1:11:07] to live in such an atmosphere
[1:11:09] and conduct itself in such a way that
[1:11:12] god will be proud of this church to
[1:11:14] present it to christ
[1:11:16] at the coming of the lord
[1:11:18] watch
[1:11:19] he said now if the church
[1:11:24] okay
[1:11:25] god never intended the church
[1:11:27] to be governed by denomination
[1:11:29] neither by creeds
[1:11:31] if god only intended for the church to
[1:11:33] be governed or carried by creed
[1:11:36] and denomination and intellectuals then
[1:11:38] we do not need the holy spirit in the
[1:11:40] church
[1:11:41] its success will be placed upon
[1:11:43] intellectuals of the best of us
[1:11:45] the better intellectual we would have
[1:11:47] the more church progressive we will be
[1:11:50] but in the word
[1:11:52] i find that god did not intend for the
[1:11:54] church to be governed by intellectual or
[1:11:55] by theology of man
[1:11:56] but the holy spirit was given to the
[1:11:59] church to govern and control the body of
[1:12:02] christ amen does any man try to
[1:12:05] govern the body of christ that's a real
[1:12:07] serious thing
[1:12:08] you know because he could govern bodies
[1:12:10] but nothing but their crimes because
[1:12:11] that's an international bright body not
[1:12:14] a spirit body as we said on tuesday
[1:12:16] night when when you're baptizing water
[1:12:18] and you get put in water and you're
[1:12:20] buried identified god will take you on
[1:12:22] burying your spirit
[1:12:23] baptizing your spirit when you come back
[1:12:26] up you're soaking wet with spirit
[1:12:28] all inside your spirit your soul your
[1:12:30] body your being hallelujah your amen
[1:12:34] your dreams in the spirit of god that's
[1:12:36] what god wanted to do
[1:12:37] oh do you believe that
[1:12:39] oh praise the name of the lord
[1:12:42] i am positive sure this morning if men
[1:12:44] and women could only get into position
[1:12:46] to wear their soul their thinking their
[1:12:48] attitude will be perfect in the sight of
[1:12:49] god that will be one of the most
[1:12:50] powerful churches
[1:12:52] ever existed
[1:12:54] now
[1:12:55] i know some of you know it some of you
[1:12:56] may not from blasphemous names sister
[1:12:58] shepard had a dream
[1:13:00] about the holy spirit passing over her
[1:13:02] and waters and different things like
[1:13:03] that and the rock box and honey being
[1:13:04] poured into it and so on and but iran
[1:13:07] went and explained the dream and says no
[1:13:09] group or no church could hold the holy
[1:13:10] ghost but the group as a group could
[1:13:13] hold the honey
[1:13:14] which is forgiveness that way you can't
[1:13:15] get bury kind by yourself
[1:13:17] you can shake your number god bless you
[1:13:18] forgive you i'll drop you out
[1:13:20] has to have a group
[1:13:22] where you interact with people
[1:13:24] when you get involved with people where
[1:13:25] you get disappointment and so on give
[1:13:27] you the opportunity to say i'm sorry
[1:13:29] forgive me
[1:13:31] i cannot see somebody go through the
[1:13:33] whole christian life with all saying i
[1:13:34] am sorry
[1:13:35] i cannot i cannot explain i cannot i
[1:13:38] don't accept that i i can't accept that
[1:13:40] even god repented at all
[1:13:43] and you can read that
[1:13:44] god repented what he's doing
[1:13:46] he's going to judge never never repent
[1:13:48] and god repented of his intention what
[1:13:50] he's going to do for the neighbor
[1:13:52] so said our words so broadly kindness
[1:13:54] spirit of forgiveness give us the
[1:13:55] opportunity to say i'm sorry forgive me
[1:13:57] and give you the opportunity to say i
[1:13:59] forgive you
[1:14:02] i forgive you
[1:14:03] you should want to say that
[1:14:05] i forgive you about sex no not that bad
[1:14:10] i forgive you should not do me that
[1:14:13] no no
[1:14:14] do like what god do father forgive them
[1:14:18] forgive as we forgive those who trespass
[1:14:20] against us god gonna forgive you just
[1:14:23] freely forgive drop it
[1:14:24] your visa don't stop already on your way
[1:14:26] to glory
[1:14:27] oh my hallelujah so watch
[1:14:30] i want to bring back something from
[1:14:31] there no he says no
[1:14:34] here is what wrong with the brand of
[1:14:35] tabernacle
[1:14:37] there are two kinds of faith
[1:14:40] there are two kinds of virtue
[1:14:43] two different kinds of knowledge
[1:14:46] two different kinds of temperaments
[1:14:48] so we're not talking about painting the
[1:14:50] trainer itself for temperance we have
[1:14:52] assignment temperatures i have
[1:14:53] temperance now i have a button mark
[1:14:55] temperance what time i read and means
[1:14:57] your feet
[1:14:58] it doesn't work that way or somebody
[1:15:00] breathing in
[1:15:01] theater
[1:15:03] virtue it doesn't come in that way
[1:15:05] by breathing all these exercises and so
[1:15:07] on
[1:15:08] so it has the natural temperance natural
[1:15:11] patience natural knowledge have
[1:15:12] spiritual temperaments
[1:15:15] the temperaments of jesus christ the
[1:15:16] patience of jesus christ the knowledge
[1:15:18] of jesus christ after they get the blood
[1:15:20] transfusion
[1:15:22] amen and blood transfusion means they
[1:15:24] hook you up to the equipment and your
[1:15:26] blood going out and jesus is not coming
[1:15:28] in
[1:15:29] that brings in the blood of jesus it
[1:15:31] brings in the faith of jesus the virtue
[1:15:34] in other words you become a partaker of
[1:15:35] his divine nature by your blood going
[1:15:37] out
[1:15:38] so he become to get the preeminent in
[1:15:40] your life
[1:15:41] so listen how we bring it now
[1:15:43] patience right
[1:15:45] pretending to be
[1:15:47] a nature giving faith there's a nature
[1:15:49] giving faith and there's a need to give
[1:15:50] a virtue there are some people by nature
[1:15:53] they are patient
[1:15:54] they're very patient
[1:15:56] even job will be expressed impressed
[1:15:59] but but it's not the patient of jesus
[1:16:00] christ
[1:16:01] [Music]
[1:16:03] it's just that is how they are there's
[1:16:05] some people who can listen and listen
[1:16:07] and listen are there some people who
[1:16:08] could talk very very long
[1:16:10] they can't say good morning in two words
[1:16:14] they have to see it all over all over
[1:16:16] and there's somebody who patience and
[1:16:17] the patient and time going patience
[1:16:20] patience going that is not the patience
[1:16:21] of jesus christ
[1:16:23] the patients these guys surely have more
[1:16:25] things to do than that
[1:16:26] so you have natural patience
[1:16:28] i have jesus patience
[1:16:30] now listen to all about the brain i'm
[1:16:32] bringing it here now
[1:16:33] by hearing the word
[1:16:35] it brings us to a mental recognition of
[1:16:37] god
[1:16:39] but if this coming from above if it ever
[1:16:41] strikes this which is the holy spirit
[1:16:44] a godly spiritual fate
[1:16:47] then what does that faith do
[1:16:49] that faith only recognizes the word
[1:16:53] so when you hear the word it's a mental
[1:16:55] fate
[1:16:56] but when the holy ghost take that fate
[1:16:58] from here
[1:17:00] and drop it into here what changes is
[1:17:03] that faith could only recognize the word
[1:17:05] so somebody tell you you feel this and
[1:17:08] you feel that it doesn't go by feeling
[1:17:10] what does the word say
[1:17:12] [Applause]
[1:17:19] so no matter what anybody else says is
[1:17:21] only recognize the word
[1:17:22] because it's the word right so then the
[1:17:24] word itself is pouring into your feet
[1:17:27] our mental fate becomes a spiritual
[1:17:31] revelation
[1:17:32] i was a catholic but when the lord shine
[1:17:35] light and this message upon me it was
[1:17:36] revealed to me and that left me above
[1:17:38] all the criticism i got from my family
[1:17:41] so my family couldn't family couldn't
[1:17:42] stop me from breaking out
[1:17:44] because it was a revelation now if it
[1:17:46] was intellectual they could talk me out
[1:17:49] of it
[1:17:49] if it's intellectual anybody could talk
[1:17:51] you out of it so just with a different
[1:17:53] talk your mind twists and you somewhere
[1:17:55] else you think somewhere somehow
[1:17:57] different but if you have a revelation
[1:18:00] you can't nobody can talk you out of it
[1:18:02] because jesus said this way he said upon
[1:18:05] this rock
[1:18:07] i will build my church
[1:18:10] and the gates of hell is guaranteed
[1:18:13] not to prevail against it
[1:18:15] because the gates of hell will come
[1:18:17] against but it can't prevail
[1:18:21] so whenever god gives you a revelation
[1:18:23] it doesn't mean no opposition it just
[1:18:26] means it can't
[1:18:28] prevail
[1:18:31] hell will fight it
[1:18:33] but it can't
[1:18:35] prevail
[1:18:37] that's why jesus could tell them you
[1:18:39] can't touch me because my hour has not
[1:18:41] yet come
[1:18:42] [Music]
[1:18:44] hallelujah
[1:18:46] he knew he had to be crucified but he
[1:18:48] knew he had a ministry and they couldn't
[1:18:50] stop him before time
[1:18:53] hallelujah
[1:18:54] and when they thank him he said my hour
[1:18:56] is now come
[1:18:58] go give the lord some praise
[1:19:03] oh hallelujah
[1:19:05] so let me tell you something
[1:19:07] david said i was old no i was young no
[1:19:10] i'm all i've never seen the righteous
[1:19:12] forsaken or in seed-backed bread you are
[1:19:15] not going to bag bread
[1:19:17] forget about it the devil is a liar
[1:19:21] you are not going to be on the street
[1:19:23] you are not going to be homeless you are
[1:19:25] not going to be hungry you're not going
[1:19:27] to be unprotected
[1:19:28] [Applause]
[1:19:34] oh hallelujah give the lord a shout
[1:19:36] [Applause]
[1:19:45] let me be seated
[1:19:48] so the holy spirit
[1:19:50] coming down
[1:19:51] then he will give you a supernatural
[1:19:53] fate
[1:19:54] spiritual fate
[1:19:56] that faith only recognize the word
[1:20:00] not ministers and and churches of just
[1:20:02] the word
[1:20:03] just take the word and slam it on that
[1:20:04] believer they say that's amen
[1:20:07] that's the word
[1:20:08] that's the truth because there's an
[1:20:10] anchor inside the soul
[1:20:11] if the backslide it's still there
[1:20:13] peter but it was still there
[1:20:16] please i couldn't change it he denied
[1:20:18] christ but there was a rock inside of
[1:20:20] him that the devil could not dig out
[1:20:23] primo
[1:20:24] bulldozo
[1:20:26] ramo jamo

[1:22:58] a mental fate
[1:23:00] comes down the holy spirit
[1:23:02] so far there's mental fate but ram say
[1:23:04] intellectually we're hearing a message
[1:23:06] but it have to be done
[1:23:08] it has to get into spirit he said he
[1:23:10] said i believe we have received a
[1:23:11] message but we're hearing it
[1:23:12] intellectually his books and tape
[1:23:14] everybody's reading studying listening
[1:23:15] and so that's fine that's good you have
[1:23:17] to do that
[1:23:18] but then you have to get room for spirit
[1:23:20] to be done
[1:23:22] and get this intellectual thing more in
[1:23:24] the spirit thing or you're feeling good
[1:23:27] about yourself about your life about god
[1:23:29] you love jesus i miss your trial you
[1:23:32] love jesus you lost this you still love
[1:23:34] jesus
[1:23:35] you still love the lord
[1:23:37] you're sick but you love jesus
[1:23:39] you're not trying to duck hell
[1:23:41] you love jesus you're not trying to
[1:23:43] escape because you have no testimony
[1:23:45] whatever what are gonna happen take with
[1:23:46] the heavy lord why
[1:23:50] well i get in trouble in a job
[1:23:54] i remember some teachers in my job you
[1:23:56] said boy all the christians all the
[1:23:58] religions would have said no not this
[1:23:59] one
[1:24:00] i say i want to be a testimony to you
[1:24:02] guys
[1:24:05] i said that that diamond going on is
[1:24:07] easy enough
[1:24:08] is to leave your mark on earth
[1:24:11] it's one life you have to learn
[1:24:13] you want a real testimony and the
[1:24:16] testimony can only come when the tests
[1:24:17] come
[1:24:19] [Music]
[1:24:20] right though you write down everybody i
[1:24:22] believe everybody believe here
[1:24:24] but then when you go out satan waiting
[1:24:26] to see to qualify how much you really
[1:24:28] believe
[1:24:30] his whole easily even just disappear in
[1:24:32] that one day
[1:24:35] because the secret things belong unto
[1:24:36] god
[1:24:38] but the things that are revealed belong
[1:24:39] to us that's first thing
[1:24:41] once it reveals ours
[1:24:42] the prophet revealed that's ours nobody
[1:24:45] can say it's not yours it's yours
[1:24:47] deuteronomy 29 29 says oh

[1:24:52] so every revealed promise is us
[1:24:55] give the lord every reveal promise
[1:24:58] belongs to us
[1:25:00] do i have a shout in the house for that
[1:25:02] [Applause]
[1:25:11] things that are revealed to us and to
[1:25:12] our children that we may do
[1:25:16] [Music]
[1:25:19] so watch
[1:25:20] are we going good
[1:25:22] number one
[1:25:23] coming down into your mental
[1:25:25] comes the holy spirit
[1:25:28] making it a spiritual fate
[1:25:30] then that spiritual faith this is
[1:25:32] imperimental
[1:25:34] recognizes only the word
[1:25:36] number two then you have a spiritual you
[1:25:39] have the holy spirit seal all these
[1:25:41] things into you

[1:28:50] [Music]
[1:28:52] you may be seated
[1:28:54] i want to bring back something i read
[1:28:56] last sunday
[1:28:57] from man running from the presence of
[1:28:58] the lord of prayer
[1:29:00] but was praying
[1:29:01] he was seeing
[1:29:03] me all the great mysteries
[1:29:06] that we are supposed to know at this age
[1:29:08] lord be unveiled to us
[1:29:12] and we will see
[1:29:14] the plainness of god
[1:29:17] so that we will know
[1:29:19] how to behave ourselves and act
[1:29:23] correcting ourselves
[1:29:25] and bringing the members of our body
[1:29:29] into discipline to the word
[1:29:31] that we might know how to live in this
[1:29:34] present day at the approaching of the
[1:29:36] lord jesus
[1:29:37] let's take that slowly
[1:29:40] may all the great mysteries that we're
[1:29:42] supposed to know at this age be unveiled
[1:29:44] to us
[1:29:46] what's the purpose
[1:29:48] that we might see
[1:29:50] the plainness of god
[1:29:54] listen carefully now this is my burden
[1:29:58] god was so mysterious
[1:30:00] he wanted to reveal himself
[1:30:03] his purpose and objective and goal
[1:30:06] was to reveal himself
[1:30:09] not for him to be mysterious
[1:30:12] so he had to find a way to unfold his
[1:30:14] great mystery of what he was
[1:30:17] so whenever he began to reveal himself
[1:30:20] it's supposed to produce the plainness
[1:30:22] of god
[1:30:24] it's supposed to produce a god in
[1:30:26] simplicity
[1:30:28] reveal himself to his people
[1:30:31] and he did that through jesus christ
[1:30:37] because christ
[1:30:39] his life unveiled god
[1:30:44] [Music]
[1:30:47] i wonder if you catch that
[1:30:50] people take the mysteries as a as an
[1:30:52] intellectual assault fighting
[1:30:54] argumentative tool
[1:30:56] i have one more machine on you
[1:30:59] i know more machines than you
[1:31:01] my mystery more hidden than your own
[1:31:07] a long time preachers have preached he
[1:31:08] said make some strange statements i said
[1:31:10] let me break it down so why they didn't
[1:31:11] break down people to begin the first
[1:31:12] place
[1:31:14] they make a long long highfalutin
[1:31:16] statement
[1:31:17] and people lost people
[1:31:19] let me break it down
[1:31:22] i thought that was supposed to be
[1:31:24] happening
[1:31:25] right division
[1:31:27] [Music]
[1:31:28] and make it plain
[1:31:30] but the branham said i hope god raised
[1:31:32] up men to make more sense to this
[1:31:36] hallelujah raise up mighty men
[1:31:38] to make more sense
[1:31:40] to what the message is

[1:38:19] said i have a son he said i don't want
[1:38:21] to check you no more
[1:38:23] it's because it's god's faith in the man
[1:38:26] god sees in the man
[1:38:28] without the scripture
[1:38:31] [Music]
[1:38:33] without a book
[1:38:34] without a quote
[1:38:36] but god acting on his life
[1:38:39] through his believers
[1:38:42] he's about to restore back his image
[1:38:44] the devil is clueless
[1:38:46] because when man fell he began to bring
[1:38:48] back his image
[1:38:50] by bringing abraham fate
[1:38:52] isaac love
[1:38:54] jacob grace
[1:38:56] joseph perfection and he put a platform
[1:39:00] and on top of that he bring prophet
[1:39:02] after prophet after prophet
[1:39:03] beginning at moses to build up the body
[1:39:06] work then john the baptist come as the
[1:39:08] neck part and jesus come at the head
[1:39:11] the cap of the old testament
[1:39:13] and become the cornerstone of the new
[1:39:15] testament
[1:39:16] god was always building
[1:39:18] his objective is to restore his
[1:39:21] objective is to bring back the image his
[1:39:23] goal is to bring back that perfect man
[1:39:28] back on the earth
[1:39:30] he has done it
[1:39:32] [Applause]
[1:39:38] not will do it
[1:39:41] he has done it
[1:39:42] you may be seated
[1:39:44] understand this
[1:39:46] when adam fell
[1:39:48] the book that adam had
[1:39:50] or what he was to release because adam
[1:39:52] was supposed to release the names
[1:39:55] of the sons from that book
[1:39:57] by his spoken word
[1:39:59] so adam's son was to be born like how he
[1:40:01] came forth as it was by spoken word
[1:40:04] but because he felt it went into sex and
[1:40:06] that's how we get baby born and water
[1:40:08] and grow through that process but what
[1:40:09] should jesus come back and say you must
[1:40:11] be born again
[1:40:12] of word
[1:40:14] and of spirit
[1:40:15] so this second birth is back to adam
[1:40:17] again
[1:40:18] where gene thought would activated
[1:40:20] inside of you hallelujah are you with me
[1:40:23] so the book that adam had this
[1:40:25] mysterious book of god went back in the
[1:40:28] hands of the original owner
[1:40:30] this book of names
[1:40:32] [Applause]
[1:40:33] this book always had names adam was
[1:40:36] commissioned to multiply
[1:40:39] hallelujah bring forth on the earth
[1:40:41] make more sons like you
[1:40:44] express more sons like you
[1:40:46] having my purpose
[1:40:48] having my objective having the goal of
[1:40:50] god i want more like that
[1:40:53] [Applause]
[1:40:55] [Music]
[1:40:56] [Applause]
[1:41:00] so when adam fell
[1:41:02] lost the book
[1:41:03] the book won back and the hands of the
[1:41:05] original owner
[1:41:06] the one that sat on the throne
[1:41:09] that book that man had is now in the
[1:41:11] hands of one
[1:41:12] that sat upon the throne that book is to
[1:41:15] be loosed that book is to be unveiled
[1:41:17] that book is to be released because
[1:41:19] there are names that has to be called
[1:41:21] the thing of it is the names has always
[1:41:24] been unfolded not knowing it was names
[1:41:27] all the ages gone past is the book being
[1:41:29] unfolded because god promised in the
[1:41:31] last day the prophet will come and make
[1:41:33] known what took place all along
[1:41:36] should the prophet come at the very end
[1:41:37] and say you know what there were names
[1:41:39] calling that age names calling that age
[1:41:41] and name will be calling this age so the
[1:41:44] lord decided to shout revelation chapter
[1:41:46] 10
[1:41:47] with the book open
[1:41:49] seven thunders throw their voices out
[1:41:51] because seventeen will catch that bride
[1:41:53] seventh and lord get every name on that
[1:41:55] book
[1:41:56] he knew when them voices go out it will
[1:41:58] connect to the elect it will connect to
[1:42:01] the predestination it will connect to
[1:42:03] the elected
[1:42:05] hallelujah praise god
[1:42:07] that will be your land
[1:42:09] that will be your inheritance
[1:42:11] that will be your portion
[1:42:13] john represented the bride
[1:42:16] give the lord a shout in the house

[1:48:15] as the word of god
[1:48:17] and reveals the entire revelation of god
[1:48:22] the mysteries themselves come down as
[1:48:24] the word
[1:48:25] so when the word is preached
[1:48:28] the mysteries
[1:48:30] is being preached
[1:48:32] hallelujah
[1:48:35] now god's great secret mystery
[1:48:38] that he had before the world began
[1:48:41] in the back path of god's mind
[1:48:44] there was something he was trying to
[1:48:46] achieve
[1:48:47] he had a motive in order to let himself
[1:48:50] be expressed
[1:48:52] so first he made the angels to worship
[1:48:54] him and that make him before becomes god
[1:48:58] god had a purpose and a hidden mystery
[1:49:01] and that's what i want to speak to you
[1:49:02] this church this morning the hidden
[1:49:04] mystery of god that he had in his mind
[1:49:07] unfolded back to this present are
[1:49:09] god great mystery is a secret
[1:49:12] he kept it a secret
[1:49:15] not even the angels understand it
[1:49:18] he didn't reveal it
[1:49:20] that's the reason
[1:49:21] under when the seventh seal was opened
[1:49:24] there was silence
[1:49:26] even the son himself don't know when
[1:49:27] it's going to happen god kept that all
[1:49:29] to himself
[1:49:31] john was even a forbidden to write it
[1:49:33] the coming of the lord
[1:49:35] that's the one thing he hasn't revealed
[1:49:36] yet how he will come
[1:49:38] and when he will come
[1:49:40] here we go therefore that's what i want
[1:49:42] to get to
[1:49:43] the entire bible
[1:49:46] is the revelation of god's mystery in
[1:49:49] christ
[1:49:50] here we go
[1:49:51] the entire bible
[1:49:53] is an
[1:49:54] expression of one goal that god had
[1:49:59] one purpose he wanted to achieve in the
[1:50:02] entire bible
[1:50:03] and all the acts of the believers
[1:50:06] that's where i get my taught from all
[1:50:08] the acts of the believers
[1:50:11] in the bible has been in type expressing
[1:50:14] what god's great goal is
[1:50:17] and now is the last days he has revealed
[1:50:20] it
[1:50:20] and he has shown it
[1:50:22] god and a truthful purpose one
[1:50:24] god wants to reveal himself to the
[1:50:26] people
[1:50:27] so god become from god become to me to
[1:50:29] take my sin upon him that he might make
[1:50:31] me him and go back to his great purpose
[1:50:34] as sons and daughters of god the
[1:50:36] attribute that was in him now watch
[1:50:39] the coming of the lord is a mystery
[1:50:41] we don't know when he is coming
[1:50:43] how he is coming but we know he is
[1:50:44] coming
[1:50:45] so was all the mysteries of god waiting
[1:50:48] for this last day here we go
[1:50:50] after it's already been completed
[1:50:54] then he reveal and show what he has done
[1:50:59] pause a little bit
[1:51:01] after it's completed
[1:51:03] then he reveal
[1:51:04] what he has done so he's not revealing
[1:51:07] it as it unfolds
[1:51:08] when it's completed you reveal it and
[1:51:10] identify it
[1:51:12] so watch he never give his mystery in
[1:51:14] full
[1:51:16] hear the bomb
[1:51:17] it's like comparing the seven seals now
[1:51:19] when god used martin luther
[1:51:21] for the coming out of that first church
[1:51:24] or that church age
[1:51:26] then he used john wesley he gradually
[1:51:29] brought them out
[1:51:30] here we go and was
[1:51:32] revealing in them
[1:51:35] that church
[1:51:38] so they were just living out
[1:51:40] living on a mystery of a church age
[1:51:43] and they didn't even know in them
[1:51:45] the mystery of the church was being
[1:51:47] lived out
[1:51:48] as a church's messenger and they didn't
[1:51:50] even know it
[1:51:51] it took a prophet to come at the end of
[1:51:53] time and say paul martin luther wesley
[1:51:55] columbus over all of them
[1:51:58] because it's already completed
[1:52:00] then he could reveal every messenger for
[1:52:02] every age
[1:52:04] are you with me
[1:52:05] hallelujah
[1:52:06] saluter he preached justification and
[1:52:09] just pounded away but he didn't know
[1:52:11] what his age was
[1:52:13] hallelujah
[1:52:15] wesley the same way right now we are
[1:52:17] pulling away and we living in a bright
[1:52:18] age
[1:52:20] [Applause]
[1:52:22] mystery being unfolded right now in you
[1:52:24] let's continue
[1:52:26] moses

[1:52:37] seven seals will be broke and the full
[1:52:39] thing will come into view of the people
[1:52:40] what took place all along the hour of
[1:52:42] the seven angels message all the
[1:52:45] mysteries of god should be made known in
[1:52:48] that elijah amen
[1:52:51] all the mysteries will be made known in
[1:52:53] that elijah so brother branham himself
[1:52:56] was holding the mystery of god

[1:53:00] man he was holding christ the seventh
[1:53:03] seal was failed in him amen

[1:53:49] in the individual
[1:53:52] not who your pastor is not wherever the
[1:53:54] church that is irrelevant it has to be

[1:54:13] people think election is something that
[1:54:15] has been hatched up here lately that's
[1:54:18] one of the oldest teachings that we have
[1:54:21] election and calling
[1:54:23] so irenaeus here we go
[1:54:25] was one of the angels of the church age
[1:54:27] as we've seen as we studied
[1:54:29] we believe of course now they were all
[1:54:31] mysteries
[1:54:36] did you hear that
[1:54:38] they were all
[1:54:40] mysteries paul was a mystery arenas was
[1:54:42] a mystery columba was a mystery seven
[1:54:45] mysteries
[1:54:48] but they have to be revealed in the last
[1:54:49] day
[1:54:50] it started off with paul so we
[1:54:52] understand that these messengers
[1:54:55] they were
[1:54:56] a mystery
[1:54:58] they were mysteries hid let me read it
[1:55:00] again
[1:55:02] of course they were all mysteries they
[1:55:03] are all here hid right here in these
[1:55:05] seals
[1:55:07] could we give the lord a shout on that
[1:55:09] day
[1:55:10] this is not me trying to explain this
[1:55:11] this is what the prophet is saying that
[1:55:13] these men were mysteries hid in the
[1:55:16] seals and the prophet came at the end of
[1:55:17] the age and reveal it
[1:55:20] like a mystery here look a mystery there
[1:55:22] look another mystery here look a mystery
[1:55:24] here you talk about mysteries
[1:55:26] [Applause]
[1:55:30] [Music]
[1:55:34] someday he comes forward to get this
[1:55:35] book that is redeemed
[1:55:37] and all that's in the book would be him
[1:55:40] for that's the believer
[1:55:42] the words in the book
[1:55:46] who is the believer
[1:55:48] who are the believers
[1:55:50] the words
[1:55:52] in the book
[1:55:54] and as isaac preached when we read our
[1:55:56] book you see the voice of one cry in the
[1:55:58] wilderness
[1:56:00] when god look at his bookies you see
[1:56:01] john the baptist
[1:56:04] [Applause]
[1:56:07] are you with me now
[1:56:09] so we see scripture
[1:56:11] god see individuals
[1:56:18] in our book we see a virgin shall
[1:56:19] conceive
[1:56:21] but in god's book he see mary
[1:56:23] okay the lord
[1:56:29] so john the baptist he had to live out
[1:56:31] the scripture
[1:56:32] the voice of one
[1:56:34] crying in the wilderness so he had to go
[1:56:36] into wilderness and step out as the
[1:56:38] voice of one and he's fulfilling the
[1:56:40] scripture a mystery is being unfolded
[1:56:43] you don't hear what i'm saying
[1:56:45] [Applause]
[1:56:48] [Music]
[1:56:52] hallelujah
[1:56:53] then it says there's a time but ram says
[1:56:56] time shall be no more
[1:56:58] here notices that time is over what
[1:56:59] happens could that now be so brethren
[1:57:02] seriously think
[1:57:04] if it is then the pyramid is kept by the
[1:57:06] seven thunders you remember the premium
[1:57:08] message it's the capstone what did it do
[1:57:10] here we go he's going to the perfect man
[1:57:13] the holy spirit capped off the
[1:57:15] individual and sealed it when we added
[1:57:17] to our faith righteousness and godliness
[1:57:20] and faith we kept adding seven things
[1:57:22] now that's how he makes the individual
[1:57:24] then he caps him and see them by the
[1:57:26] holy spirit
[1:57:28] then he comes to say
[1:57:30] if
[1:57:30] that be so
[1:57:32] hear what this person has
[1:57:34] he has got seven ages
[1:57:36] that he had seven mysteries
[1:57:38] that have been stronged away and they
[1:57:41] fought for to bring back another
[1:57:43] headstone comes the cap of the church
[1:57:45] does the thunders mean that my bedroom
[1:57:48] so when these virtues are in an
[1:57:50] individual what that person have is not
[1:57:52] just virtues
[1:57:54] they have seven mysteries
[1:57:56] seven ages
[1:57:57] seven lights
[1:57:59] seven rainbows
[1:58:00] hallelujah seven voices
[1:58:03] seven thunders
[1:58:05] all that wrapped up in our individual
[1:58:07] the devil is scared and shaken because
[1:58:10] these thunders overcome in every age
[1:58:13] god releasing to you
[1:58:15] the overcoming power that got victory
[1:58:18] over the devil in every age god gathers
[1:58:21] it up
[1:58:22] and put it in a bride
[1:58:25] and put that pride on the earth
[1:58:27] we beat him in paul h we whip him in
[1:58:29] irena's age and columbus luther we put
[1:58:32] licks on him and loot and wesley be
[1:58:34] overcome and we go every age there was a
[1:58:37] bunch of overcomers what about our day
[1:58:41] what about our age when god is about to
[1:58:43] release the full power
[1:58:45] back into the church

[1:59:01] voice is plural

[2:09:00] oh my
[2:09:01] i'm going to close just tomorrow's
[2:09:02] musician come on
[2:09:04] what am i talking about from adoption
[2:09:06] hey branham tabernacle you had your
[2:09:07] chance
[2:09:09] here we go
[2:09:10] when a man once is anointed with the
[2:09:13] holy ghost
[2:09:15] are you
[2:09:16] ready to be adopted
[2:09:20] into the family of god
[2:09:23] so before adoption
[2:09:25] a man have to be anointed
[2:09:28] with the holy ghost
[2:09:30] to be adopted
[2:09:35] to be positionally placed by the father
[2:09:37] and set into service out there into his
[2:09:39] purpose of life what god call him to do
[2:09:42] his walk must be holy holy
[2:09:44] unto the lord amen
[2:09:48] final quote i have here
[2:09:50] from as i was with moses
[2:09:51] last evening last tuesday morning about
[2:09:53] two o'clock
[2:09:55] something else happened
[2:09:56] i was at home
[2:09:58] standing before me in a room was a
[2:10:00] divine one
[2:10:01] that spoke words that i did not
[2:10:03] understand
[2:10:04] that the time that he appointed is near
[2:10:06] him
[2:10:06] i did not hear him too good but he was a
[2:10:08] divine one he said seven more days you
[2:10:10] stand as moses stood or will be as moses
[2:10:12] was something that considered moses
[2:10:15] that leads me to wonder one day you'll
[2:10:17] have to stand i told my family i told
[2:10:19] him i told my loved ones that i saw this
[2:10:21] divine one yet he spoke as a man
[2:10:25] i close with these words
[2:10:28] it is becoming clear and clearer to me
[2:10:32] all the mysteries
[2:10:35] all the great revelations and knowledge
[2:10:36] and understanding
[2:10:38] is to bring us into a pathway of life
[2:10:41] that we can partake of the life of god
[2:10:44] and the nature of god to express god and
[2:10:47] then go back to eden
[2:10:50] but more than that
[2:10:52] adoption
[2:10:54] is to bring you into the presence of a
[2:10:56] divine one
[2:11:01] a nazi zafar got judged and church for
[2:11:03] lying to peter
[2:11:05] peter was a man
[2:11:07] that he could see
[2:11:09] listen
[2:11:10] sapphira knew better she knew the kind
[2:11:12] of man she was living with
[2:11:14] he died
[2:11:15] she didn't have her to die
[2:11:17] she didn't have to stand up with her
[2:11:18] husband she has stunned with the word
[2:11:21] she lied also and she died and that was
[2:11:24] a man
[2:11:26] that had god veil and strong
[2:11:28] what about coming into divine one
[2:11:32] where brother branham said he never got
[2:11:33] accustomed to the presence of the angel
[2:11:36] where john said he fell as one dead and
[2:11:38] john lived with jesus when jesus was
[2:11:40] only earned
[2:11:42] but when john got in the book of
[2:11:43] revelation and christ come in that
[2:11:45] glorified condition he fell as one dead
[2:11:48] amen all the prophets
[2:11:50] the experience like isaiah fellas one
[2:11:53] dead
[2:11:54] i signed the president of god who is me
[2:11:56] i'm undone
[2:11:58] when the vision broke about brother
[2:11:59] branham with with the return since this
[2:12:02] is the time
[2:12:03] he said he was numb for days
[2:12:07] he couldn't feel his hands numb for days
[2:12:10] and that was off the vision
[2:12:14] that wasn't even the angel yeah
[2:12:16] hear what he said adoption
[2:12:18] god will visit you with an angel
[2:12:25] is your life ready
[2:12:27] for a visitation play something softly
[2:12:30] is your life ready for god to visit you
[2:12:33] with supernatural
[2:12:36] divine presence and this is where i
[2:12:38] could see a man anointed his work must
[2:12:41] be holy holy
[2:12:43] oh this takes us beyond church now
[2:12:45] there's not trying to please some sister
[2:12:47] or some brother or some elder or some
[2:12:49] deacon or some person it's not that
[2:12:51] this is you conscious
[2:12:53] that someday you have an appointment
[2:12:55] with the supernatural
[2:12:58] and if you see the plainness of god then
[2:13:01] it's you to make yourself ready you to
[2:13:04] prepare your spirit and your soul and
[2:13:06] your mind
[2:13:07] and your heart
