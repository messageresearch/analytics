[25:16] before but we're going to go into it
[25:18] today so we want to stand for the
[25:20] reading of the word as you want to go
[25:22] into the
[25:23] scriptures want to go to Jeremiah
[25:26] chapter 18 vers 1 1- 6 Romans Chapter
[25:30] 9:
[25:33] 11-23 2 Timothy chap
[25:36] 2
[25:37] 19 to
[25:39] 21 praise
[25:49] God reading from Jeremiah chapter
[25:53] 18
[25:56] 1-6
[25:58] the word which came to Jeremiah from the
[26:01] Lord saying arise and go down to The
[26:05] Potter's House and there I will cause
[26:08] thee to hear my
[26:10] words then I went down to The Potter's
[26:13] House and behold he wrought a work on
[26:18] the
[26:18] wheels and the vessel that he made of
[26:22] clay was m in the hand of the
[26:25] Potter so he made it again another
[26:30] vessel as seemed good to the Potter to
[26:33] make it amen then the word of the Lord
[26:36] came to me saying oh House of Israel
[26:40] cannot I do with you as this poter
[26:44] sayeth the Lord behold as the clay is in
[26:48] The Potter's hand so are ye in my hand
[26:52] oh House of Israel Romans chapter
[26:56] 9 to read from verse
[27:07] 11 see speaking about Esau and
[27:12] Jacob for the children not being yet for
[27:15] the children being not yet
[27:17] born neither having done any good or
[27:21] evil that the purpose of God according
[27:25] to election might stand
[27:28] not of works but of him that c it was
[27:33] said unto her the Elder Shall Serve the
[27:37] younger as it is written Jacob have I
[27:40] loved but Esau have I hated what shall
[27:44] we say then is there unrighteousness
[27:47] with God God forbid for he said to Moses
[27:50] I will have mercy on whom I will have
[27:53] mercy and I will have compassion on whom
[27:57] I will have compassion so then it is not
[28:00] of him that willth nor of him that
[28:03] runneth but of God that showeth Mercy
[28:08] for the scripture said unto Pharaoh even
[28:12] for this same purpose have I raised thee
[28:15] up that I might show my power in thee
[28:20] and that my name might be declared
[28:22] throughout all the Earth therefore ha he
[28:26] Mercy on whom whom he will have mercy
[28:29] and whom he will harden he Harden it
[28:32] thou will say unto me why do he yet find
[28:35] fault for who had resisted his will nay
[28:41] but oh man who had thou that rep us
[28:44] against God shall the thing formed say
[28:48] to him that formed it why hast Thou made
[28:51] me thus had not the Potter power over
[28:54] the clay of the same lump to make one
[28:58] vessel unto honor and another unto
[29:01] dishonor what if God willing to show his
[29:05] wrath and to make his power known
[29:08] endured with much Longs suffering the
[29:11] vessels of Wrath fitted to destruction
[29:15] and that he might make known The Riches
[29:18] of his glory on the vessels of Mercy
[29:21] which he had a four prepared unto Glory
[29:25] our last scripture from second Timothy
[29:29] 2 verse 19-
[29:38] 21 nevertheless the foundation of God
[29:41] standard sure having this seal the Lord
[29:45] knoweth them that are his let everyone
[29:49] that nameth the name of Christ depart
[29:52] from iniquity but in the house there are
[29:55] not only vessels of gold and of silver
[29:59] but also of wood and of Earth some to
[30:02] honor some to dishonor if a man
[30:07] therefore Purge himself from these he
[30:11] shall be a vessel unto honor Sanctified
[30:15] and meet for the Master's use and
[30:17] prepared unto every good work let us
[30:19] pray almighty God we thank you for your

[31:17] morning of a
[31:19] subject the purpose of God according to
[31:23] election that's the
[31:25] subject purpose of God according to
[31:27] election and have an inspiration a work
[31:31] on the wheels amen
[31:34] hallelujah so I we know what we talking
[31:38] about there but we'll get it work on the
[31:42] wheels okay let's go so I have a little
[31:45] backdrop here I want to share with you
[31:48] brother brandham speaking about the
[31:50] Ephesians Church age
[31:53] Ephesus the very name Ephesus has a
[31:56] strange comp meaning
[31:57] meaning it means aimed at and
[32:00] relaxed the high aspiration of this age
[32:05] that had begun with the fullness of the
[32:08] spirit amen and he called that the depth
[32:10] of God yes sir so the depth of God is
[32:15] the
[32:15] fullness of the spirit remember these
[32:19] brothers Peter and all these other
[32:21] brothers they were ignorant and
[32:23] unlearned so they couldn't talk all kind
[32:26] of mystery talk and intellectual talk
[32:29] they were filled with God Amen in so
[32:32] much that they reproduced God
[32:37] yes they were God arms and ears and
[32:40] mouth on the earth they were God eyes on
[32:44] the earth so when an Nas of fire came
[32:46] lying in the church they were dead they
[32:49] got killed because God was veiled in
[32:52] that man called Peter
[32:55] amen isn't that right
[32:57] so the high aspiration of this age that
[33:00] begun with the fullness of the spirit
[33:02] the depth of God whereby they were
[33:05] aiming at the High Calling of God begin
[33:07] to give away to a less watchful
[33:12] attitude and as soon as you begin with a
[33:15] less watchful attitude your life begin
[33:17] to
[33:18] deteriorate your Christian walk begins
[33:21] deteriorate because you have to be
[33:23] guarded Sir You Have To Be watchful
[33:26] because your not against flesh and blood
[33:28] but against principalities against
[33:31] Powers against spiritual wickedness so
[33:33] even though you walk in this Ordinary
[33:35] World that seems normal and natural it
[33:39] have demons from hell plotting and
[33:42] planning your overthrow plotting and
[33:44] planning your destruction plotting and
[33:47] planning your captivity so you have to
[33:50] walk wise Redeeming the time for the
[33:52] days are evil oh Hallelujah so when you
[33:56] come to Church to come to church to be
[33:58] empowered to get wisdom to be inspired
[34:02] to be anointed that is why you come to
[34:06] church
[34:07] hallelujah
[34:09] hallelujah so the passion to know the
[34:11] word the cry to get in the spirit the
[34:14] fent is are to please God that become
[34:16] the wax coal in people's lives and they
[34:19] just begin to go to
[34:23] church not going to hear from God going
[34:26] to do their
[34:34] Duty unless ad and following of Jesus
[34:36] Christ begin to manifest itself as an
[34:38] omen in the future ages the
[34:42] physical vehicle called The Church would
[34:46] sink to the awfulness of the depth of
[34:50] Satan who would have thought the church
[34:53] would move from the depth of God to the
[34:56] depth of State Satan but still remain
[34:59] church still at the church today move
[35:02] from the depth of God fullness of the
[35:04] spirit to the depth of Satan
[35:09] amen it had become
[35:12] relaxed and was
[35:14] drifting already the age was
[35:17] backsliding it has left its first love
[35:21] the tiny seed planted in that Ephesians
[35:23] age would one day grow into a the spirit
[35:25] of error
[35:27] amen until all false bir of the air
[35:30] would Roost in his branches so
[35:32] inoffensive to human reasoning that
[35:35] little plant appeared to that new EVE
[35:37] the new church and she would be Deed by
[35:40] Satan the Ephesians age had presented to
[35:44] her the opportunity for God's best amen
[35:48] because when God start a work he started
[35:50] for it to be the
[35:52] best because his work reflects his
[35:55] workmanship his work work reflect who he
[35:58] is his work reflects his character his
[36:01] nature his being his very
[36:05] person god is perfect and his work going
[36:08] to be perfect so he expected the church
[36:11] to be glorious he expected the church to
[36:14] be powerful he expected the church to be
[36:17] anointed he expected the church to have
[36:19] the foot on the neck of the enemies
[36:22] that's where he expected the
[36:25] church GL Oh
[36:28] Glory Hallelujah he didn't expect you to
[36:31] say a prayer he expect you to be
[36:33] praying he expected to be calling that
[36:36] devil and El him with with your prayer
[36:38] every time you pray you're hitting him
[36:39] in his face you're hitting him you're
[36:42] giving it back to
[36:43] [Applause]
[36:52] him the Ephesians age had presented her
[36:55] the opportunity for the God's best and
[36:58] for a while she prevailed then relaxed
[37:01] and in that unguarded moment Satan
[37:04] planted the seed of complete
[37:08] ruination in other words that church got
[37:11] pregnant with the wrong seed yes and the
[37:14] life of that seed begins to unfold and
[37:17] brought it right down to the depths of
[37:20] Satan yes
[37:22] yes the very religion of Ephesus stpes
[37:24] out perfectly the Church age and says
[37:27] the tenor of the ages to
[37:30] come just going to just go on quickly
[37:33] Hallelujah I going to skip
[37:35] that talking about the fifth AG
[37:38] Tira the resume of the ages he said
[37:41] since the fifth
[37:42] age aha here we go listen amen brought a
[37:46] dissemination of the word true printing
[37:49] because the printed press was invented
[37:52] in Luther's time I believe it was so
[37:55] before they couldn't spread the word God
[37:57] make them to invent the print in press
[37:59] so you get the word in print and with
[38:01] the word in print now the word start to
[38:03] spread all that is God's purpose just as
[38:06] God say in the days of the voice God
[38:08] have to make science to invent the audio
[38:10] tape to get the prophet's voice isn't
[38:13] that right God a letting that stop and
[38:15] nothing stop him he he's going to
[38:17] control things he's involving things
[38:20] he's going to make sure you get it why
[38:22] you think God have 5old Ministry why you
[38:24] think God have pastors and teachers and
[38:26] Prophet why God have all these things
[38:28] for you to be be your own God no because
[38:30] God have a purpose the church become a
[38:32] vehicle to reconnect you with God not
[38:36] reconnected to church church is is is
[38:39] church that's what the devil use God is
[38:41] the
[38:42] [Music]
[38:43] [Applause]
[38:44] word you a come here to join Church you
[38:47] come here for the
[38:49] [Applause]
[38:55] word so watch this age watch this age
[39:00] was the second stage of the restoration
[39:03] and as we have stated previously was the
[39:05] tassel age education abounded this was
[39:08] the age of intellectual men who love God
[39:12] and served him missionaries abounded and
[39:14] the word spread over the world it was
[39:16] the age of Brotherly Love It was the age
[39:18] of the open door it was the age a long
[39:21] duration and after it the loud Eastern
[39:24] age would come which would be a short
[39:25] one
[39:27] the True Vine flourish in this age as in
[39:31] no other when one think of the numbers
[39:34] at home and abroad this age brought holy
[39:36] men to the Forefront the True Vine
[39:39] spread and the false Vine receded amen
[39:43] the word was pumping do on print it done
[39:46] work it in testimony God rais up a lot
[39:48] of holy men and they were running the
[39:50] gospel isn't that right having the True
[39:52] Vine on the run the false vine on the
[39:54] run everywhere the true Vine went God
[39:57] gave light and life and happiness the
[40:01] false Vine was showed up for what it was
[40:04] Darkness misery poverty illiteracy and
[40:09] death and as the false Vine in its day
[40:13] of power could not kill the True
[40:16] Vine neither could the True Vine now
[40:20] bring back the false Vine to Jesus
[40:22] Christ so this thing working two ways
[40:25] the false car the the true and the CH
[40:28] car convinced the false isn't that right
[40:31] but the false Vine here we go entrenched
[40:34] itself waiting for the last part of the
[40:38] last age when it would win back all
[40:41] except that small flock that elect the
[40:45] vine of God so that false Vine was
[40:48] waiting for the last day he just hanging
[40:49] in the side line waiting to entrench
[40:52] everybody to tie them up in deception
[40:55] only the El will not be
[41:01] deceived how sad does this age Mak us
[41:04] feel as we realize that every great move
[41:06] of God neglected to throw off the
[41:10] nicolan doctrine for they all organized
[41:14] and died remember what a niolon is it's
[41:17] to conquer the Ley it's to conquer the
[41:21] people it's to detrone the Holy Ghost
[41:24] and impose man rulership over the Church
[41:26] of God that was the niolon and that's
[41:29] why we have a pope today because the
[41:31] spirit was removed and they say we want
[41:33] that man let us be the leader remember
[41:36] Israel they wanted a king and Samuel
[41:39] came to them and said do talk that talk
[41:42] why you want a king God is the king oh
[41:45] Hallelujah and God told Samuel they have
[41:47] not rejected you they have rejected me
[41:51] they said they want a man like the other
[41:52] tribes they want somebody to put as the
[41:54] leader now a king must coming David was
[41:57] coming but that was God's appointed time
[41:59] God had a purpose went to give them a
[42:01] king but they wanted a king and God gave
[42:04] them Saul oh Hallelujah Israel and the
[42:07] backl God don't want you to have no
[42:09] other gods before him he must be your
[42:12] lord and your God there is no mediator
[42:16] between man and God there is no fif
[42:18] between man and God the fful ministry to
[42:20] bring word to connect you back to God
[42:23] because you are Sons and Daughters of
[42:25] the Living God
[42:29] oh are you with me Hallelujah so
[42:33] now they all move into denom
[42:36] denominations to hold the spiritually
[42:39] dead and foodless
[42:40] pastures little they they know but each
[42:44] group was tainted with the same error
[42:47] and when the Revival fire burn low
[42:50] organization took over and the people
[42:51] became denominations they were only
[42:54] nominal Christians though each group
[42:57] claim the very assur same Assurance as
[43:00] the Roman Catholic Church that they were
[43:02] right and all others wrong amen every
[43:04] group claiming it right everybody El
[43:05] wrong the stage was truly set for the
[43:09] daughters to go back home in the last
[43:10] age back to Rome under the mother hen as
[43:15] we come to the last age the loud is age
[43:19] this is our age we know it's the last
[43:21] age the Jews are back in Palestine no
[43:24] matter how they got there they are there
[43:26] this is the Harvest time but before
[43:30] there can be a harvest there has to be a
[43:33] lightening a maturing of both the vines
[43:37] the Lutheran age was Springtime the
[43:40] Western age was the summer of growth the
[43:42] ludian age is the Harvest Time of
[43:46] gathering the tears binding and burning
[43:48] and Gathering the wheat for the Lord
[43:51] amen Harvest Time notice that in the
[43:53] Harvest Time there is a real acceler
[43:56] cation in right men yes sir and there is
[43:59] consequently a slowing of growth so in
[44:02] other words there come a point you can't
[44:03] grow no more growth max out then the
[44:07] fruit begin to ripen an acceleration of
[44:10] ripeness and a deceleration of growth oh
[44:13] hallelujah praise God that is what
[44:15] Harvest Time represent isn't that what
[44:17] we are seeing Oh Praise the name of the
[44:20] Lord in Harvest time then there must
[44:23] come upon the scene in this age do
[44:26] who would bring wheat and tears to
[44:30] maturity the tears are already maturing
[44:33] very fast under corrupt teachers that
[44:36] turn the people from the word but the
[44:39] wheat also must mature and to her God is
[44:42] sending the prophet messenger with the
[44:44] Vindicated Miss Ministry that he might
[44:46] be accepted by the elect they will hear
[44:49] him as the first church heard
[44:53] Paul She Will mature in the word until
[44:57] becoming a word bride the mighty Works
[45:01] will be found in her amen that's always
[45:04] attendant upon the pure word of God and
[45:06] Faith oh my the false Church would come
[45:10] together with the world con churches and
[45:12] he wreck an image unto the beasts the
[45:15] Beast deceiveth the whole Earth by means
[45:17] of those Miracles he had power to give
[45:19] life unto the image of the Beast and the
[45:21] image of the Beast should speak and
[45:23] cause as many as should worship the
[45:24] image of the Beast should be killed and
[45:26] caus it all both small and great rich
[45:28] and poor free and burn to receive a mark
[45:31] in their right hand and their foreheads
[45:33] that no man by ourselves save he that
[45:35] have the mark of the beast now
[45:37] remember it was Imperial Rome that fell
[45:40] by the sword but she was healed of a
[45:43] death stroke when she joined the nominal
[45:46] Christian church and Rome and
[45:48] Incorporated paganism and Christianity
[45:51] and thereby become the Roman Empire
[45:53] which will endure until Jesus come and
[45:55] destroy am but Rome is not going in
[45:58] alone her daughters are right with her
[46:01] and she will take over absolute
[46:05] Authority by the World Council of
[46:07] churches here we go are you
[46:10] ready this may seem
[46:13] farfetched to
[46:15] some but actually it is very plain for
[46:18] all to see because right now the
[46:21] churches are controlling
[46:23] politics and at the opportunity time
[46:26] time will manifest itself exactly how
[46:30] great is the
[46:31] control this ecumenical move will end up
[46:34] with Rome as the head even though people
[46:37] did not Envision it that way amen aha
[46:41] you mean they're not expecting it no
[46:43] they're not even looking for that but
[46:44] he's saying it's going to be that that
[46:47] is where it is heading because God's
[46:49] word Can't Fail isn't that right that is
[46:51] because Revelation 17 3:16 States that's
[46:54] the whole mystery Babylon is Seated on
[46:57] the Beast she is controlling the last or
[46:59] the fourth Empire the mark of the beast
[47:03] means they will have to take the
[47:05] doctrine of the church system which is
[47:09] trinitarianism and the mark in the hand
[47:11] will means to do the will of the whole
[47:13] church with this great power the church
[47:16] system with this great power are you
[47:19] listening am the church systems will
[47:23] persecute the true bride amen
[47:26] this image will try to keep the bride
[47:29] from preaching and teaching Etc her
[47:33] ministers will be forbidden to give
[47:34] comfort and Truth to the people who need
[47:36] it but before the Antichrist in person
[47:39] takes over this complete World System of
[47:41] churches the true bride will be taken
[47:43] away with from this world to be with the
[47:46] Lord God will catch away his bride for
[47:49] this great marriage supper of the Lamb
[47:51] amen oh praise the name of the Lord amen
[47:55] hallelujah
[47:56] thank you Jesus Oh Glory to God give him
[48:00] some Praises people hallu
[48:06] hallelujah from the Tian Church age
[48:09] Revelation 2:23 quotes and I will kill a
[48:11] children with
[48:12] debt and all the churches shall know
[48:15] that I am he which search the reins and
[48:18] hearts and I will give unto every one of
[48:21] you according to your
[48:23] Works God looks on the heart yes sir
[48:27] that has never changed amen remember
[48:31] about 3 weeks ago I preached on the
[48:32] right kind of a son and I was talking
[48:35] about God didn't talk about Mysteries
[48:36] and teachings and Revelations if that be
[48:39] so Peter who can read and write what is
[48:40] Peter's condition but guess what he had
[48:43] faith in him virtue in him knowledge in
[48:45] him he had life in him he had the word
[48:47] in him all the Mysteries was in him the
[48:49] hidden ones too all of that was lock up
[48:51] inside of
[48:53] him GL Glory what God was looking at was
[48:57] at at his behavior because your behavior
[49:00] is what put you on your path to adoption
[49:02] not how much you KN in your head but how
[49:04] much could come out of your heart isn't
[49:06] that right so let's go God look on the
[49:09] heart he never changed neither will it
[49:11] ever change here as though all the ages
[49:14] are two groups both proclaiming the
[49:16] Revelation from God and their
[49:18] relationship to God nevertheless the
[49:20] foundation of God standeth sure having
[49:23] the sealed the Lord knoweth them which
[49:25] are hiss the Lord searcheth the Reigns
[49:29] the word search means to track follow up
[49:32] God tracked down our thoughts which is
[49:34] our Reigns he knows what is in our
[49:36] hearts he sees our works which are
[49:39] definite manifestation of what lie
[49:42] within
[49:46] us that is not fake
[49:51] news that is expressing what's on the
[49:53] inside what does that your works so
[49:57] things have to come for us to produce
[49:58] something that we can see what's inside
[50:01] of us isn't that right it is out of the
[50:04] heart that proceeds righteousness or
[50:06] wickedness our motives our purposes are
[50:09] all known unto him as he watches every
[50:11] action and every action every word shall
[50:13] be brought into judgment then the
[50:15] accounting of Our Lives is given there
[50:17] was no fear of God before the false Vine
[50:20] and dearly shall they pay let him who
[50:23] named his name live live as becometh
[50:26] Saints we might fool the people but we
[50:29] will never fool the
[50:31] Lord could I
[50:33] continue the promise in these dark days
[50:36] and he quote the scripture Revelation
[50:38] 2:24 but I say unto thee but unto you I
[50:42] say and unto the rest of titra as many
[50:44] as have not this Doctrine which have not
[50:46] known the depth of Satan as they speak I
[50:50] will put on you none on a burden but
[50:52] that which you already hold fast till I
[50:54] come now before we go into the promise
[50:57] this is brother Brandon let me show you
[51:00] again show again the church as spoken by
[51:03] the spirit in this book has two Vines
[51:06] whose inter wiing branches compos it but
[51:10] I say unto you and unto the rest in
[51:12] Titar as many as have not this Doctrine
[51:15] there it is he is speaking to two groups
[51:19] this is the backdrop of coming down to
[51:21] The Potter's House so no we ain't reach
[51:23] to Putter's house yet we on our way
[51:25] there we talking about the church right
[51:27] now yes oh Hallelujah he is speaking to
[51:31] two
[51:32] groups one has the doctrine and another
[51:36] has not there they are scattered abroad
[51:39] across the nations with each other
[51:41] Doctrine opposing the other this is
[51:43] Doctrine one is of God knowing his
[51:46] depths and the other of Satan knowing
[51:49] the depths of Satan that's incredible
[51:53] isn't it talking about church now
[51:56] you're not talking about unbelievers
[51:57] talking about church now depth of God
[52:00] depth of Satan I will put
[52:04] you I will put upon you none other
[52:07] burden the word for burden is weight or
[52:11] pressure the pressure of the Dark Ages
[52:14] was either Bend or be
[52:16] broken bow or die it was the
[52:21] Inquisition the power of the empire
[52:26] backing up satanic worship be organized
[52:30] or pay for your life with your life each
[52:32] age had its pressure for
[52:36] example a great burden of the last age
[52:39] talk
[52:41] about a great burden of the last age is
[52:45] the pressure of
[52:47] riches soft living amen and nervous
[52:51] tensions amen true that's

[53:05] here I found it this is it right here I
[53:09] do I go nowhere else this is it right
[53:11] here for example a great burdens of the
[53:14] last age is the pressure of riches
[53:19] riches you want to buy byy byy spend
[53:22] spend spend improve improve you can't
[53:25] way to get money to spend and there's a
[53:27] pressure what to
[53:29] buy on how much to buy where to buy the
[53:34] kind to buy who buying just like you who
[53:36] you want to buy like Jesus it's a
[53:43] pressure soft

[54:19] you an opportunity to give worship to
[54:24] God if you come and sit down for just
[54:27] word how do you get in the spirit that's
[54:30] what the song service that's why bring
[54:31] me a Minstrel
[54:34] hlj the prophet was angry he was upset
[54:37] he said bring me a Min make some music
[54:39] here now change the atmosphere create an
[54:42] atmosphere that I could move into the
[54:45] spirit and then you could hear th say of
[54:47] the
[54:50] lord we not singing because it's a song
[54:53] We singing Because it brings worship and
[54:55] honor and adoration unto
[54:58] God because in heaven of seraphim day
[55:01] and night Bing holy holy Lord God
[55:03] Almighty holy holy H holy holy Lord God
[55:10] Almighty heaven filled with Angelic
[55:12] beings bringing adoration and praise
[55:15] unto
[55:20] God each age has his pressures for
[55:23] example a great burden of this last
[55:24] agees the pressure of rich
[55:25] soft living and nervous tensions in a
[55:28] complex in a complex age that we seem
[55:31] unfitted to live in lord lord nervous
[55:35] tension and is that nervous tension
[55:37] because you waiting for the Holy Ghost
[55:40] it's a different kind of nervous tension
[55:43] oh
[55:44] my watch this forward age seem to have a
[55:47] clearcut burden it was to defy Rome
[55:51] stand up for the word even unto death
[55:54] amen that is why the Christians in those
[55:56] age were very pure you have no
[55:59] compromise when they knock on your door
[56:01] Rome or de what you going
[56:05] do have no in between you know well I
[56:07] thinking about it they take you and they
[56:08] cut your head
[56:09] off you had to think about it before
[56:13] those Christians give their lives the
[56:15] real ones the genuine ones they meant
[56:19] and they serve God hallelujah praise God
[56:23] they have not known the of Satan it
[56:27] seems that this verse has been left out
[56:29] by the commentators for they were not
[56:32] able to figure out what Doctrine or what
[56:36] experiences are meant by this phrase
[56:38] actually it is simple to know what is
[56:41] meant this is Brother Bron you recognize
[56:43] none of the com commentators talk about
[56:45] this dep of Satan they don't know what
[56:47] that is listen to The Prophet let us
[56:50] first know what the depth of God is and
[56:55] the opposite will be true for the depth
[56:58] of Satan in Ephesians 3:16 here we go
[57:02] that he would Grant you according to the
[57:05] riches of his glory to be strengthened
[57:08] with might by his spirit in the inner
[57:12] man that Christ May dwell in your hearts
[57:16] by faith that ye being rooted and
[57:20] grounded in love may be able to
[57:23] comprehend with All Saints what is the
[57:27] breadth and length and depth and height
[57:31] and to know the love of Christ which
[57:34] passeth knowledge that you might be
[57:37] filled with the fullness of God that is
[57:40] the depth of God hallelujah could we
[57:43] give the Lord a shout hallu do you
[57:46] understand the depth of God now that
[57:49] prayer I I want to read it again that
[57:51] Christ will dwell in your hearts by
[57:53] faith and that ye being rooted and
[57:55] grounded in love may be able to
[57:57] comprehend with All Saints what is the
[57:59] breadth and length and depth and height
[58:03] and to know the love of Christ which
[58:05] passeth knowledge that he might be
[58:07] filled with all the fullness of God now
[58:10] according to these verses when a man
[58:12] experiences the depth of God in his life
[58:15] it is an actual personal experience of
[58:19] the spirit of God indwelling in him amen
[58:23] his mind is illuminated
[58:25] by the wisdom and knowledge of God
[58:27] through the word but the depth of Satan
[58:30] will be in that he will attempt to
[58:32] destroy this he will always attempt to
[58:35] make a substitute of this reality all
[58:37] right all right all right all right oh
[58:40] so it's two things we pointing to now
[58:42] the depth of God is a personal
[58:44] experience with the spirit indwelling in
[58:47] your
[58:48] life that's a
[58:50] reality that is God and you there is no
[58:53] man in between
[58:55] that's fire upon your being that is fire
[58:58] upon your life there is nobody in
[59:01] between you and
[59:02] [Applause]
[59:07] that now watch how will he do it to
[59:10] bring this depth to Satan he will take
[59:13] away the knowledge of the truth of God
[59:17] and destroy the word by putting forth
[59:19] his own yeah had God said he will then
[59:22] substitute here this bomb he will then
[59:24] sub Ute the personal Christ in our
[59:30] Spirits this is the problem from from
[59:34] from the personal Christ in your spirit
[59:36] to a man behind the pulpit or some
[59:38] bishop or some message Pope or some
[59:41] message
[59:47] dictator he will do
[59:49] it as he calls Israel to do the same by
[59:53] a human being reigning as King instead
[59:56] of God the Born Again experience will be
[1:00:00] rejected in favor of church
[1:00:03] joining so the people have it in their
[1:00:05] mind when they in church they are safe
[1:00:08] when they at church they are bride when
[1:00:11] they are in church everything is fine
[1:00:13] because they're in a particular church
[1:00:15] but Jesus already exposed that and said
[1:00:17] when they say come here forget that when
[1:00:19] it's say low here forget that dude come
[1:00:21] here come here he said behold the
[1:00:23] kingdom of God is within you
[1:00:24] [Applause]
[1:00:28] could we give a shout on that
[1:00:33] one he never point the kingdom to a
[1:00:36] place to a church to a man to a person
[1:00:40] he said the kingdom is within
[1:00:42] [Applause]
[1:00:44] you therefore the kingdom has to be the
[1:00:46] word turn into
[1:00:53] spirit
[1:00:57] the Born Again experience will be
[1:01:01] rejected in favor of church joining the
[1:01:04] depth of Satan has been entered into
[1:01:06] that age and the fruit of that depth of
[1:01:09] Satan which Alles murders and horrible
[1:01:11] crimes came forth from it oh my thank
[1:01:15] you Jesus Oh Glory to godu brother

[1:17:28] certain item you make a sacrifice to
[1:17:29] save some money to buy it the sacrifice
[1:17:32] might want other things but because this

[1:17:36] save this amount every month for 12
[1:17:37] months or whatever it is then you're
[1:17:38] going to get this well that's the same

[1:21:53] out with it but we're going to shoot
[1:21:57] we're going to use Dynamite grenades
[1:21:59] whatever it is but there's going to be a
[1:22:02] glorious Church Without spot without
[1:22:06] wrinkle washed in the blood of the lamb
[1:22:09] and you have to want

[1:22:21] out until God comes down and take a hold
[1:22:26] we invite you to come 9:00 to start a
[1:22:28] pray inside of here to have a prayer
[1:22:29] meeting inside of here until we put on a
[1:22:31] tape for consecration service we invite
[1:22:33] you to do that to put some extra oil in
[1:22:35] your own
[1:22:37] lamp don't miss that opportunity
[1:22:39] now amen all right that's right keep the
[1:22:43] joy of the Lord among the saints keep
[1:22:44] them prayed up and guard every place if
[1:22:47] Noah see a leak in the ark why he put
[1:22:50] some pitch in it that's the best thing I
[1:22:52] know to keep a leak out stop a leak
[1:22:54] prayer stops the
[1:22:56] leak Prayer Changes
[1:23:00] Things Hallelujah and that's the what's
[1:23:04] the matter with the brandom Tabernacle
[1:23:06] because that unbelief the cares of the
[1:23:07] world has bong the people until it
[1:23:10] cannot produce spiritual
[1:23:12] growth and that's what's the matter with
[1:23:14] our nation that's the matter with our
[1:23:16] churches they have no joy the joy of the
[1:23:19] Lord has
[1:23:21] departed written in the scripture the
[1:23:23] the word Hebrew word EAB means the
[1:23:25] presence of God have departed when the
[1:23:28] presence of God departs you start to
[1:23:30] find fault fault with this one that one
[1:23:34] a Vex with this one and she do me and
[1:23:37] and and it's a whole flesh natural
[1:23:39] humanistic thing there is no joy of the
[1:23:43] Lord hallelujah so then because of that
[1:23:47] now we're going to other places of
[1:23:48] pleasure instead of coming into the
[1:23:51] house of the Lord for pleasure it should
[1:23:53] be a pleasure and delight and
[1:23:55] encouragement to know that 9:00 is
[1:23:57] people praying in the church 9:00 you're
[1:23:59] smoking up the place as incense going up
[1:24:01] before God the spirit realm incense
[1:24:04] going up before God and it's a joy for
[1:24:06] you to connect with that and be part of
[1:24:08] that you want to know when is the next
[1:24:10] pray meeting it can't be you know I
[1:24:11] forget I I forget when the pray meeting

[1:24:17] heart it wasn't upon your mind you have
[1:24:20] to recognize this is a life Source amen
[1:24:23] praise God this is where you're getting
[1:24:24] empowered Hallelujah this is where
[1:24:26] you're getting in the spirit this is
[1:24:28] where God could speak to you Hallelujah
[1:24:31] the house of the Lord is the joy of the
[1:24:32] Lord the joy of the Lord is the joy of
[1:24:34] his people he wants you to come to
[1:24:36] church and worship him and be happy and
[1:24:39] satisfied give him praise honor and
[1:24:41] glory and wisdom and might and power he
[1:24:42] wants you to do that Hallelujah all the
[1:24:46] pleasure out there substituting the
[1:24:47] devil is substituting Rowdy things that
[1:24:49] to take the place of the real good
[1:24:51] Spirit-filled experience experience so
[1:24:54] if you never experienced come taste of
[1:24:56] the Lord huj you see he is good
[1:24:59] Hallelujah glory to God and when the
[1:25:02] people want joy today what do they do
[1:25:04] the people instead of accepting the joy
[1:25:05] of the Lord people go to church and
[1:25:07] claim to be Servants of Christ and when
[1:25:08] they get real nervous they light up a
[1:25:12] cigarette women sck on immoral clothes
[1:25:14] and go out on the grass and when man is
[1:25:15] going there to whistle at them to do
[1:25:18] everything to be popular oh praise the
[1:25:20] name of the Lord Halle
[1:25:22] hallelujah thank you Lord
[1:25:25] Jesus oh praise God so that's
[1:25:28] church we finished with the church
[1:25:34] now come
[1:25:36] down to The Potter's
[1:25:40] House open your Bibles to J 18 we want
[1:25:44] to read the scripture
[1:25:51] again
[1:25:56] the word of the Lord which came to
[1:25:57] Jeremiah from the Lord saying Jeremiah
[1:25:59] 18
[1:26:03] verse1 the word of the Lord which came
[1:26:04] to Jeremiah from the Lord saying arise
[1:26:06] go down to the Putter's house and I will
[1:26:10] cause thee to hear my words then I went
[1:26:13] down to The Potter's House and behold he
[1:26:17] wrote a work on the wheels and that's
[1:26:19] where I get inspiration from a work on
[1:26:21] the wheels
[1:26:23] and the vessel that he made of clay was
[1:26:25] m in the hand of the Potter so he made
[1:26:28] it again another
[1:26:30] vessel but seemed good to the Potter to
[1:26:33] make it then the word of the Lord came
[1:26:35] to me saying oh House of Israel can I do
[1:26:37] with you as this Potter sayeth the Lord
[1:26:40] behold as the clay is in The Potter's
[1:26:43] hand so are ye in my handen oh
[1:26:46] House of
[1:26:49] Israel so I want to just talk a bit
[1:26:52] about this Potter's
[1:26:55] House that God sent
[1:26:57] Jeremiah to
[1:27:00] see and it's so strange that God would
[1:27:03] send him
[1:27:04] there because God want to bring a
[1:27:07] picture a
[1:27:10] comparison uh analogy is it word that's
[1:27:15] right and I'm seeing something about the
[1:27:18] Potter I'm seeing the clay yes I am
[1:27:24] seeing the
[1:27:26] whe I am seeing the purpose I am seeing
[1:27:31] a mad vessel all right I am seeing the
[1:27:36] Potter's Choice whether to keep
[1:27:39] it or discard it yes this is what I'm
[1:27:44] seeing now before clay could be used you
[1:27:48] don't just dig up Clay it has to go
[1:27:50] through a process
[1:27:52] yes that it can be
[1:27:55] usable let's call it
[1:27:58] Sanctified
[1:27:59] cleansed purified purged out to get it
[1:28:03] malleable that you could work it amen
[1:28:06] and get it into a usable State yes sir
[1:28:10] isn't that right amen The Vessel was
[1:28:13] mad the Potter Choice was to keep it or
[1:28:17] discard it he brought it back from a
[1:28:19] broken State and the vessel was
[1:28:22] remade so I have some notes Here the
[1:28:25] clay after being pulverized mixed with
[1:28:27] water brought into a usable State a lump
[1:28:30] is tored in the middle of this wheel and
[1:28:34] I wish I had a wheel to show it in
[1:28:36] reality it's a wheel have something on
[1:28:39] your foot spinning this wheel spin
[1:28:41] around like this and they take this lump
[1:28:43] of clay and hit it in the middle of the
[1:28:51] wheel
[1:28:53] and and okay a lump is tossed into the
[1:28:56] middle of the
[1:28:57] wheel the center of the wheel with
[1:29:01] fingers thumbs water and
[1:29:04] pressure that lump of clay is turned
[1:29:08] into a bowl if you go on the internet
[1:29:09] and YouTube you could see how it is done
[1:29:12] huh and it's kind
[1:29:14] of and it turned into a bowl a vase a
[1:29:18] water pot a candle holder whatever the
[1:29:22] Potter de sides after completion the
[1:29:25] artwork is done it is placed in the over
[1:29:28] K heated to bring it to a usable State
[1:29:31] glazed then heated and brought it into a
[1:29:33] state for the
[1:29:35] Potter the reason the clay must be
[1:29:37] processed because when it is placed on
[1:29:40] the wheel and the wheel begins to
[1:29:44] spin as stone rock Pebble or stick could
[1:29:50] M it or break
[1:29:53] it so when the Potter start to put that
[1:29:55] lump there start to knead it and put
[1:29:57] water in it and put his hands in it and
[1:29:59] it keeps spinning and expand it he in
[1:30:03] other words one beautiful thing though
[1:30:05] he knows where he is
[1:30:08] going when you are spinning the wheel it
[1:30:11] can't be you know I feel I should make
[1:30:13] it so you know are you sure no no no no
[1:30:15] no once it start to spin his hands and
[1:30:19] tumbs and pressure when he want to raise
[1:30:20] it higher he's quick and the whole mud
[1:30:23] thing raised up higher the clay because
[1:30:25] he have a vision I want to make a pot so
[1:30:27] you know how to guides his hands that's
[1:30:29] the Potter the Accurate Way spinning he
[1:30:31] can't stop it now hallelujah praise God
[1:30:35] are you with me
[1:30:35] [Applause]
[1:30:37] now but Bram said this in
[1:30:42] Witnesses before we can ever make any
[1:30:46] Headway we have got to get broke up
[1:30:48] first amen you know like the Potter the
[1:30:51] prophet was going down to The Potter's
[1:30:52] House to be broke up to be made over
[1:30:55] again you know if there's no breaking up
[1:30:57] there is no Making
[1:30:59] Over
[1:31:01] Again
[1:31:04] Hallelujah when he confronted Moses this
[1:31:07] is the prophet who make mouth and so
[1:31:08] like that he said now watch you've got
[1:31:10] to be broke up before you can be remade
[1:31:14] the prophet went into The Potter's House
[1:31:15] to get broke up to get on the wheel and
[1:31:17] spun out something different if you a
[1:31:19] sinner get on the wheel God will break
[1:31:21] you
[1:31:22] mold you different shape your life
[1:31:25] different shape your home different
[1:31:27] praise the name of what the church needs
[1:31:29] today is a breaking up we need to go
[1:31:32] down to The Potter's
[1:31:34] House our stiff homemade theology
[1:31:37] sometimes doesn't work so good what we
[1:31:39] need is a oldfashioned breaking up
[1:31:41] repentance in our heart getting mellow
[1:31:44] towards God am mellow
[1:31:48] towards
[1:31:50] God picted the
[1:31:53] Potter
[1:31:55] God he's a
[1:31:57] Potter and if you don't catch the
[1:31:59] analogy we are the
[1:32:02] clay just in case you miss it you are
[1:32:06] not the
[1:32:08] Potter we are the
[1:32:10] CLE
[1:32:13] hallu picture the Potter God working
[1:32:17] with the ending
[1:32:19] Mind of a finished product amen
[1:32:23] amen he is not working to kill
[1:32:25] time sir he is working with purpose Hall
[1:32:31] of the type and use of the vessel he has
[1:32:35] in mind amen he is not working
[1:32:40] blindly he sees in you what you don't
[1:32:42] see in
[1:32:45] yourself he sees what you could
[1:32:48] become and you have to begin to want to
[1:32:51] become come how he sees you as opposed
[1:32:54] to how you see
[1:32:58] [Applause]
[1:33:01] yourself he is working on purpose not
[1:33:06] Beauty I want to repeat that he is
[1:33:09] working on purpose not Beauty so the
[1:33:11] things around you may not be nice it not
[1:33:14] be smooth it might be easy it may be
[1:33:17] messy but it's not the beauty he's
[1:33:19] working around your life he's working to
[1:33:22] your
[1:33:28] purpose because each vessel that is
[1:33:30] crafted each
[1:33:34] Bowl each thing that is made by the
[1:33:36] Potter have a purpose behind
[1:33:40] it hallelujah oh glory to God Amen so
[1:33:44] the things around you may not be Prett
[1:33:45] your
[1:33:46] easy he's not Santa
[1:33:49] Claus working at the weed deal with an
[1:33:52] end in mind a water pot a flower
[1:33:57] pot that's the
[1:33:59] Potter Hallelujah I like that he knows
[1:34:03] the end from the
[1:34:04] beginning when he picks up that lump of
[1:34:06] clay he know exactly what he's going to
[1:34:08] make it and when I see how they work it
[1:34:11] they work it to completion they don't
[1:34:14] mix it half with a half
[1:34:17] Bowl when they start to spin it but a St
[1:34:20] it spins complete
[1:34:22] everything is still and then they just
[1:34:23] wipe it out put the string and pull it
[1:34:25] off and you get a bowl you get a pot you
[1:34:28] get a vase it's complete he had it in
[1:34:31] his mind what he's going to make how
[1:34:34] he's going to make it the time to make
[1:34:36] it it's already finish the work he
[1:34:38] started in you
[1:34:41] Hallelujah he's going to complete it
[1:34:44] could we get a sh in the
[1:34:50] house
[1:34:52] [Applause]
[1:34:54] Lord that's the
[1:34:56] Potter let's look at the clay a little
[1:34:58] bit the clay is the choosing of

[2:03:17] Hallelujah Hallelujah
[2:03:20] let me just s down a minute let me just
[2:03:23] read this here from L Church AG he said
[2:03:26] now he said his own as many as I love I
[2:03:27] rebuke and chasten to chasten is to
[2:03:29] reprove to reprove is to expose with a
[2:03:33] view to correction
[2:03:35] chasen does not mean to
[2:03:40] punish I think I need to let that soak
[2:03:42] in a little
[2:03:43] bitah as many as I love I
[2:03:46] rebuke and chasen
[2:03:49] chasing doesn't mean to punish it means
[2:03:52] to discipline because the subject's
[2:03:55] amendment in his mind it means he's
[2:03:58] disciplining you to bring you into
[2:04:00] Conformity to his will and to his word
[2:04:03] that is what that chasen is all about
[2:04:06] isn't that right whom the Lord love it
[2:04:07] he chasteneth and scourgeth every son
[2:04:09] whom receive it if you endure chastening
[2:04:12] God deal it with you as with sons if you
[2:04:17] endure the Chast amen if they run out
[2:04:19] well you know you're on your
[2:04:21] own amen some people just run out the
[2:04:24] test they run out they can't take it no
[2:04:25] more so avoid duck hide and they by the
[2:04:34] self and the devil isolate you and then
[2:04:36] take you
[2:04:38] out if you cat your bird aside you could
[2:04:41] take him out when the bird wounded and
[2:04:43] weak and he stay with the flow of the
[2:04:45] rest of birds and they make a way and in
[2:04:47] front of him and they G the breee you
[2:04:49] get to ease and flying with the rest of
[2:04:51] birds you have people to encourage you
[2:04:53] and support you but once the devil can
[2:04:54] get you to a side that's what he does
[2:04:56] you first thing you fall you fail
[2:04:58] something happen wrong you keep to
[2:04:59] yourself no prayer you're not coming to
[2:05:01] the church you're not coming to the
[2:05:02] ministry you're all by yourself devil
[2:05:03] says stay right there now you can do it
[2:05:05] you can handle it
[2:05:08] yes and all he trying to do is to get
[2:05:10] you by yourself to nail you when he
[2:05:13] finish with you like a
[2:05:16] zombie Dead Man Walking
[2:05:23] no chastening for the present seeth to
[2:05:26] be joyous but Grievious nevertheless it
[2:05:30] yielded the Peaceable fruit of
[2:05:31] righteousness unto them which exercise
[2:05:34] thereby I'm almost done hearing is set
[2:05:37] forth the love of God love of God he
[2:05:41] desired in love a family of his own a
[2:05:45] family of sons like himself I'm
[2:05:50] finishing dear before him lies all one
[2:05:52] mankind as one lump of
[2:05:55] clay out of that same lump he now will
[2:05:58] make vessels unto honor and unto
[2:06:02] dishonor the choosen will be his own
[2:06:05] choosing then those chosen ones born of
[2:06:09] his spirit will be trained to be
[2:06:11] conformed to His Image in their
[2:06:14] walk he reproves with all longsuffering
[2:06:18] and Gent gentleness and mercy he
[2:06:21] chastens with nail scarred
[2:06:23] hands sometimes this Potter must take
[2:06:26] the vessel he is working on and
[2:06:29] thoroughly break it down in order to
[2:06:32] rebuild it exactly as he desires it but
[2:06:37] it is his love that is his love another
[2:06:41] way of his love there is not there
[2:06:44] cannot be oh fear not flock this age is
[2:06:49] closing fast as th those tears will be
[2:06:52] bound together as a threefold cord is
[2:06:54] not easily broken they will have a
[2:06:56] tremendous three-fold strength of
[2:06:59] political physical spiritual satanical
[2:07:02] power they will seek to destroy the
[2:07:05] bride of Christ she will suffer but she
[2:07:07] will
[2:07:09] endure fear not those things that are
[2:07:11] coming upon the Earth for he who loved
[2:07:13] his own love him un the end and I close
[2:07:16] with these scriptures and a quotation at
[2:07:19] the end this the scripture I read think
[2:07:22] when brother Stephen SP spoke Isaiah 431
[2:07:24] and7 but thus said the Lord that created
[2:07:27] thee oh Jacob that formed thee oh Israel
[2:07:29] fear not for I have redeemed thee have
[2:07:31] called thee by thy name for thou art
[2:07:32] mine when thou passest through the
[2:07:34] waters I will be with thee and through
[2:07:36] the war Rivers they shall not overflow
[2:07:37] thee when thou walkest through the fire
[2:07:39] Thou shalt not be burned neither shall
[2:07:41] the flame Kindle upon thee for I am the
[2:07:43] Lord thy God the Holy One of Israel thy
[2:07:45] savior I give Egypt for thy Ransom it
[2:07:48] you e opian seber for thee since thou
[2:07:50] was precious in my sight thou has been
[2:07:52] honorable I have loved thee therefore
[2:07:54] will I give men for thee and people for
[2:07:56] thy life fear not for I am with thee I
[2:08:00] will I will bring thy seed from the East
[2:08:02] and gather the from the West I will say
[2:08:04] to the north give up to the South keep
[2:08:06] not back bring my sons from afar and my
[2:08:09] daughters from the ends of the Earth
[2:08:11] even everyone that is called by my name
[2:08:12] for I have created him for my glory I
[2:08:15] have formed him ye I have made him
[2:08:19] what are we created for for his glory
[2:08:22] Isaiah 684 648 but now oh Lord thou Our
[2:08:26] Father we are the clay Thou Are The
[2:08:28] Potter we are all the work of thy hand
[2:08:30] Ephesians 2:10 for we are his

[2:08:35] good works which God had before ordained
[2:08:38] that we should walk in them PR something
