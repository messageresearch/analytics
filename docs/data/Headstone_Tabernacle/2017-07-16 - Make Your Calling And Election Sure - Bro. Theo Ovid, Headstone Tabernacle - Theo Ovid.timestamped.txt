[40:12] to do with church or convention is have
[40:14] to do with a bride elect isn't that
[40:17] right and you have to possess your
[40:19] individual inheritance because you have
[40:22] representation by predestination so you
[40:25] don't have to play shy and whatnot know
[40:28] and you are predestined to that Eternal
[40:30] Church age at the end of the seal and
[40:32] you have to know that you are God

[40:54] they're going to realize that you have
[40:56] been receiving original word which was
[40:59] the spoken word not an interpretation or
[41:03] explanation of what the prophet said but
[41:05] just what the prophet said was seated
[41:07] down into you no wonder the Holy Spirit
[41:10] told the prophet right the secret is the
[41:13] word is in the bride that mean they had
[41:16] to have Ministries pouring thus say the
[41:19] Lord into you I am not a prophet I don't
[41:22] have th say the Lord William Bram is a
[41:24] prophet he was that Elijah and we take
[41:26] the words of that Elijah and Echo it to

[43:56] the firstborn among many Brethren so his
[44:00] forn knowledge is isn't that right make
[44:04] Make Way for his predestination because
[44:06] he for knew you he could predestinate
[44:09] you despite your smoking drinking
[44:11] fooling around that didn't stumble him
[44:14] that didn't frighten God God wasn't

[45:10] Hallelujah
[45:16] hallu I heard all dear beloved pastor
[45:18] but never make a remark on his
[45:20] television Radio cast the other in the
[45:21] morning and just went over and over my
[45:24] mind I just can't forget it I quoted to
[45:27] a friend of mine last night and that it
[45:29] was
[45:31] this after the taken away of the Holy
[45:35] Spirit out of the
[45:38] Earth this is not
[45:42] if this is
[45:44] after it will be
[45:47] done after the holy spirit is taken out
[45:52] of the
[45:53] earth that formal Church Rel will go
[45:57] right on not knowing the difference how
[46:01] many heard that but Bram speaking
[46:10] that wasn't that
[46:12] astounding they don't know the holy
[46:16] spirit amen brother so they won't know
[46:19] when it's gone true and there will just
[46:22] be going on just the same and when the
[46:25] last one here we go
[46:27] is sealed into the body of
[46:31] Christ not a
[46:33] church that's the body of
[46:37] Christ they will be still going on
[46:40] trying to bring converts to it because
[46:42] they don't know what it is and their
[46:44] formal religion will continue on just
[46:47] like they were now it may not sink into
[46:49] you like it did to me but that was an
[46:52] astounding statement that they'll be so
[46:55] far away in Rel religious rituals until
[46:58] they will not miss the holy spirit
[47:01] because they don't know what it is to
[47:03] begin
[47:07] with amen so you got to know this Holy
[47:11] Spirit yes sir you got to know disc
[47:13] comforter Hallelujah brother brand
[47:15] continuing God have mercy on us brother
[47:18] I would like to live in this life is in
[47:20] my desire till if even the least bit of
[47:24] his grieving I know it in my heart if I
[47:27] should do something that would grieve
[47:28] him I'd be able to feel it just in a
[47:33] moment let alone his absence he was
[47:36] blessing God to get
[47:38] conviction that if he grieving the
[47:40] spirit if he feeling convicted or what
[47:42] not it will be reaching him he don't
[47:44] want to be insensitive to the spirit of
[47:47] God he want to be sensitive to the
[47:49] spirit of God he said if I would do
[47:51] something would grieve him i' be able to
[47:52] feel it just in a moment see let alone
[47:55] his absence I don't want to be here when
[47:57] he's not here I want to be gone then
[48:00] there'll be no more blood on the mercy
[48:01] seat it'll be dark Smoky and black the
[48:05] sanctuary will have no lawyer to plead
[48:07] our case at that time you know the
[48:10] scripture say the sanctuary was smoking
[48:12] there was no blood in The Mercy Seat
[48:14] then it is
[48:15] Judgment there is so many entertain
[48:18] thing entertainment things in our days
[48:20] there are so many things to entice
[48:22] people to what we call pleasures and
[48:24] it's all peoples and all ages
[48:27] there are enticement for young people
[48:29] modern dances rock and roll parties and
[48:31] music that goes with it it's all
[48:33] enticing I don't care how good a home a
[48:35] child is brought up how it have been
[48:37] taught to do right if that child hasn't
[48:39] accepted the experience of the new birth
[48:41] rock and roll catches attention as quick
[48:44] as he hears it because it is in him and
[48:46] is born in him my nature a canal Spirit
[48:49] and the power of the devil is so great
[48:51] today till it catches the spirit of that
[48:54] little one that's why you have no time
[48:55] to waste you have time to pray pray for
[48:58] your children and get a burden that they
[49:00] get the baptism of the Holy Ghost praise

[1:15:13] God be just and loving if he stands by
[1:15:15] and watch his people suffer oh my and

[1:16:20] they thought that love meant a baby with
[1:16:24] parental care
[1:16:26] looks thaty nice child right that is
[1:16:29] what they taught but that is not the
[1:16:31] love that God has are you ready to hear

[1:16:37] said his love was elective
[1:16:41] love the proof of his love is
[1:16:45] election and today we say make your
[1:16:48] calling and election
[1:16:50] sure the proof of his

[1:23:35] demonstrating to God you have faith that
[1:23:38] he going to work all things
[1:23:41] well oh glory to God so the life that
[1:23:46] was in the stock the life went into
[1:23:49] Wesley and one big blade don't look like
[1:23:52] the grain when the pollen come the sh
[1:23:54] Chuck watch so therefore the life keep
[1:23:56] traveling on isn't that right but the BR
[1:23:58] I'm talking about so the life is what
[1:24:01] can of
[1:24:02] denominated after the life pass through
[1:24:05] denomination denomination denomination
[1:24:08] but they have to have something that
[1:24:09] cannot be denomination which is the life
[1:24:11] itself and that life is Faith virtue
[1:24:14] knowledge that life cannot be
[1:24:15] denominated you can box that in you can
[1:24:18] legate that in you got put clothes on
[1:24:19] that and say it have to be so that's the
[1:24:22] life it will break out will push out
[1:24:24] isn't that right say Moses called a
[1:24:27] nation out of a Nation here we go Christ
[1:24:29] today is calling a church out of a
[1:24:36] church Christ is calling what church a
[1:24:39] church out of a church taking them to
[1:24:42] that promised Eternal that glorious
[1:24:44] Eternal promised land so there's church
[1:24:47] but the s t Rion 10 comes to call a
[1:24:50] bride out of the church don't stay in
[1:24:53] church
[1:24:55] come out to be bride respond to the call
[1:24:58] this Mighty angel came down and CED with
[1:25:00] a l voice seven th straight voices out
[1:25:03] Revelation 10 is mighty Angel that's
[1:25:05] Christ your husband R 107 is the
[1:25:07] messenger that's your elaser version 10
[1:25:10] 8 to 11 that's the pride on the Earth
[1:25:13] right now prophesying from the book Oh
[1:25:17] Glory to Lord speaking your deliverance
[1:25:19] speaking your 8 day holy convocation
[1:25:21] speaking your Revival speaking the
[1:25:23] quicking power coming upon you your life
[1:25:25] speak in your transformation speak in
[1:25:27] Rapture in faith that's that's coming
[1:25:28] from the book we can only speak from the
[1:25:31] book glory to God we are not normal
[1:25:33] preachers this not Pentecostal preaching
[1:25:36] this is the book being open the full
[1:25:38] book being open Oh Glory to God are you
[1:25:41] with me now brother said to refuse the
[1:25:44] person that's doing the calling I love
[1:25:46] that Christ no matter if you're
[1:25:48] Methodist Lutheran nothing against them
[1:25:51] not at all but in this age you have got
[1:25:53] to accept like you did in that age the
[1:25:55] person of Christ which is the
[1:25:58] word so now we come down church is not a
[1:26:00] feeling not an emotion not a nice thing
[1:26:03] and a nice feeling and your no no no
[1:26:04] it's the
[1:26:05] word so after all after all the shout
[1:26:08] and all the praise and the worship it
[1:26:09] comes right back to what God Said in his
[1:26:13] word oh hallelujah praise God so the
[1:26:16] only way to do is not say I belong to
[1:26:19] assemblies I what I have people saying
[1:26:21] today this is the group this is the
[1:26:23] kingdom this is it uh we have the man of
[1:26:26] the hour Church of the hour everything
[1:26:28] of the hour I belong to Oneness Tess
[1:26:30] whatever it is all of them there I
[1:26:32] belong to the Church of God that don't
[1:26:34] mean a
[1:26:36] thing he said our father shouted and
[1:26:38] danced that's perfectly all right but
[1:26:39] that was their day but today you are
[1:26:42] confronted not with the organization
[1:26:44] they made but with the life that is
[1:26:47] going on which is Jesus Christ so that's
[1:26:50] why she's striving for that life not
[1:26:53] just to belong to another group so no
[1:26:55] matter how religious you are how many
[1:26:57] churches you belong to how many books
[1:26:59] your name is on if that genuine Holy
[1:27:02] Ghost is in you which is this word
[1:27:03] manifested you will see the message of
[1:27:05] the hour because it's the holy ghost
[1:27:07] that does it it's the inspiration that
[1:27:10] have to strike you so sometime we
[1:27:11] talking about talking and sharing the
[1:27:13] word and so on but it will take
[1:27:14] inspiration he said the elected of God
[1:27:16] seemed it in Noah's time Moses time
[1:27:19] Jesus time the apostles time Luther's
[1:27:21] time Wesley time Pentecostal time
[1:27:24] because that was the seed was on the
[1:27:26] earth when this inspiration was poured
[1:27:29] out now while the inspiration is poured
[1:27:31] out to gather the bride together it is
[1:27:34] only the elected will see it amen so he
[1:27:38] prophesying that an inspiration will be
[1:27:40] poured out to gather the bright together
[1:27:43] only the elected could see it because
[1:27:45] the elected is really the inspiration
[1:27:47] the seed of the inspiration itself so
[1:27:50] you are seeds of God waiting for
[1:27:52] inspiration to pick you up because once
[1:27:54] you're inspired it changes all
[1:27:57] everything listen you ordinary folks un
[1:27:59] let the Spirit come upon you fire come
[1:28:02] upon you don't let the devil the devil
[1:28:04] playing with with amen he playing with
[1:28:06] fire the devil is playing with fire
[1:28:09] hallelujah praise God because Samson was
[1:28:12] a normal
[1:28:13] guy no big muscles but when the spirit
[1:28:16] come upon him he was bigger than he
[1:28:18] looked he was stronger than he looked
[1:28:21] because there was a bigger power upon
[1:28:22] him and when this Dynamics this
[1:28:24] headstone this Capstone this Bond of
[1:28:26] perfectness This Love This charity never
[1:28:29] failed when that come upon that bride
[1:28:31] biger and she looks more powerful than
[1:28:34] she looks bam says we wouldn't pray for
[1:28:36] the sick then we would command it not
[1:28:39] even lay hands on us we command them
[1:28:41] Devils to come out command the blind to
[1:28:43] see command the lame to walk command the
[1:28:47] dumb to speak commanded
[1:28:49] speak walk see
[1:28:55] glory to God do you believe that do you
[1:28:58] going ins inside that channel there
[1:29:00] Hallelujah so now while the inspiration
[1:29:02] is poured out the gathered right
[1:29:04] together it will those only those
[1:29:06] elected that will see it oh praise the
[1:29:08] name of the Lord question and answers
[1:29:10] but Brandon will there be is there now a
[1:29:12] place for the bright to gather together
[1:29:14] to live like when Moses led the children
[1:29:16] of
[1:29:17] Israel that that's a big
[1:29:20] question I'm going to answer that

[1:35:52] no wonder he said wait till the
[1:35:54] anointing of God strike home God will do
[1:35:57] in one year what all the theologians
[1:35:59] fail to do in 2,000 years this lovely
[1:36:03] Gentile praise God you're going to prove
[1:36:07] your election by your
[1:36:08] sanctification you're going to prove
[1:36:10] your election by your life Hallelujah
[1:36:12] you will prove your election by your
[1:36:14] PR oh Hallelujah so what's the shout is
[1:36:18] the message going forth to bring forth
[1:36:20] the bride then he said the first thing
[1:36:22] happens he start sending with there's a
[1:36:24] shout what is it the message to get the
[1:36:26] people
[1:36:27] together oh glory to God so what the
[1:36:30] shout is a message to get the people
[1:36:33] together the shout is a messenger
[1:36:36] getting the people ready so brother
[1:36:38] brandham brought a message to gather the
[1:36:40] bride together isn't that right
[1:36:43] Revelation book of symbols brother Bram
[1:36:45] first seal no let first seal he said
[1:36:47] there's coming for seven mysterious
[1:36:48] Thunders that not even written at all
[1:36:50] and I believe through those seven
[1:36:54] tunders will be revealed in the last day
[1:36:57] in order to get the bright together
[1:36:59] Hallelujah for Rapture in faith so the
[1:37:01] shout and the tunders is the same thing
[1:37:03] the shout was sent to gather the bride
[1:37:06] together to bring her into rapturing
[1:37:08] fith that means to bring her to her
[1:37:11] individual inheritance amen Oh Glory to
[1:37:15] God you understand that this this wasn't
[1:37:17] preached years ago you know because
[1:37:19] people just wanted to be in church think
[1:37:21] that they in a church they in the
[1:37:22] message but as your mature and as the
[1:37:24] years Roll by you recognize it come down
[1:37:26] to individual inheritance because Joshua
[1:37:29] was given three things to do cross the
[1:37:31] people over fight and divide the land so
[1:37:33] I am saying we have crossed over we have
[1:37:35] been fighting for years years years now
[1:37:37] it's land division time adoption is not
[1:37:40] a church thing I had a revelation that
[1:37:42] years ago that the people can't vote
[1:37:44] their Pastor to be
[1:37:46] adopted amen adop adoption is not
[1:37:49] between the church and the pastor
[1:37:52] adoption is between God and His son
[1:37:55] amen I understood that years ago that's
[1:37:59] why I never study about the people what
[1:38:02] they think and what they feel at the end
[1:38:04] of the day I have to please
[1:38:08] him no no no I'm not trying to preach
[1:38:11] you happy I'm trying to say what he told
[1:38:12] me to
[1:38:13] [Applause]
[1:38:15] say he he gave me this inspiration
[1:38:18] TS make your corection sure I written
[1:38:21] out talk about it a little bit in the
[1:38:23] prayer meeting
[1:38:24] hallelujah hallu hallelujah and that's
[1:38:27] what I feel to bring to you this morning
[1:38:30] don't take your testimony for granted
[1:38:31] you know like some people they
[1:38:32] backsliding and they say you know I'm um
[1:38:34] I'm they a child of God and you know
[1:38:36] it's so flimsy and the day smoking you
[1:38:38] know God bring me back and I give them
[1:38:40] God his
[1:38:43] Pals and all that is just intellect you
[1:38:45] know amen that's not down here you no
[1:38:49] that's not not they just PL intellectual
[1:38:51] Samson knew he's a son of godu he was
[1:38:53] covenanted Samson tasted the power of
[1:38:56] God he knew it but he was fooling around
[1:38:58] fooling around fool get mess with theila
[1:39:01] and in it all he still have the
[1:39:02] connection because a son have access
[1:39:05] right to
[1:39:06] father I was thinking about my own Sons
[1:39:07] I said but wait a minute we what they do
[1:39:10] they my sons I deny them I can't change
[1:39:13] the front name and second name and say
[1:39:15] you know you know I don't know who you
[1:39:16] are turn my back on them regardless of
[1:39:18] what they still my sons because they
[1:39:20] were bed from
[1:39:22] me amen
[1:39:24] and regardless of what you have been bed
[1:39:25] from
[1:39:26] [Applause]
[1:39:29] God so regardless of what you do how you
[1:39:32] do you are still Sons but it's what
[1:39:40] kind so adoption have to do with Father
[1:39:44] and Son not
[1:39:46] church so people love the minister love
[1:39:49] the pastor and what that's fine that's
[1:39:50] good everything else but that love and
[1:39:52] that clap and Applause and shaking his
[1:39:53] hand and S that doesn't make him
[1:39:59] adopted
[1:40:01] so Daniel was told by the angel he heard
[1:40:04] seven Thunders Daniel heard it too they
[1:40:06] utter the voices Daniel grabbed the pen
[1:40:07] to write said don't write it don't write
[1:40:09] it on the back of the Bible watch he
[1:40:11] said John saw the same thing it was
[1:40:14] already watch it had already been
[1:40:16] written outside of the Bible and had
[1:40:17] seven seals on the back of the book that
[1:40:19] no man could open those seals first he
[1:40:22] described them as seals hear this now
[1:40:24] that was them voices
[1:40:27] amen so the back of the book had seven
[1:40:29] voices yes sir which is also Seven Seals
[1:40:32] isn't that right so he took those voices
[1:40:34] on the back of the book and put it
[1:40:35] inside the book under the seven seal
[1:40:37] seven tunders UT the voices hallelujah
[1:40:40] oh Hallelujah no man know what it was
[1:40:42] but the Bible said and told Daniel and
[1:40:44] also John that in the last days these
[1:40:47] seven voices would be known by the real
[1:40:50] true
[1:40:51] church so a church that not preaching
[1:40:53] the seven tunders forget it Hallelujah
[1:40:55] they're preaching to to church material
[1:40:58] which we have lots of material of it's
[1:41:00] an abundance but bright material the
[1:41:02] seven will produce that because the
[1:41:04] seven T is produced another Ephesians
[1:41:07] which will come back to defeat and the
[1:41:09] faith in you means you survive as an
[1:41:12] individual if this church collapses and
[1:41:14] demolish you still survive
[1:41:16] amen if trainers split up in a 100 pass
[1:41:19] you will survive with your faith because
[1:41:21] it's not man that call you as God that
[1:41:23] called you you have to have a revelation
[1:41:25] who called you isn't that right oh glory
[1:41:28] to God and no man could take that
[1:41:29] calling no man could go between that
[1:41:31] calling is not you and somebody else and
[1:41:33] God no it's you and God isn't that right
[1:41:37] praise God hallelujah oh my hallelujah
[1:41:41] praise God praise bam says there's a
[1:41:45] time of time where Jesus ain't going to
[1:41:47] stand outside your door and knock all
[1:41:48] the time there's a time when he get
[1:41:50] enough and turn away then you will do
[1:41:53] the knocking and you'll never find him
[1:41:55] come while it is time come while there's
[1:41:57] a knock don't you compromise with
[1:41:59] anything less than the baptism of the
[1:42:01] Holy Ghost like they got at Pentecost
[1:42:04] amen oh praise God don't let your heart
[1:42:06] settle for nothing less than that oh
[1:42:08] praise the name of the Lord so Church it
[1:42:11] come down to this hour now and I feel it
[1:42:14] very very serious that is each
[1:42:16] individual have to make your calling an
[1:42:18] election
[1:42:20] sure it's not good enough to say Jesus
[1:42:22] save me it's not good enough to know
[1:42:23] that you get baptized in Jesus name and
[1:42:25] you're saved you want to know what you
[1:42:26] are called onto you really want to know
[1:42:29] what you look on to but say election
[1:42:31] looks back to for knowledge that's where
[1:42:33] election comes from the for knowledge of
[1:42:35] God wait a minute I'm elected yes how
[1:42:37] elected he for knew me I am elected on
[1:42:40] the for knowledge of God the for
[1:42:42] knowledge of God elected me then watch
[1:42:45] then what B says now and predestination
[1:42:47] looks to Destiny what you are
[1:42:49] predetermined to be amen so you not be
[1:42:53] it yet but you are predetermined to be
[1:42:55] what God ordained you to be Peter was a
[1:42:59] fisherman but he was predestinated to be
[1:43:00] an
[1:43:03] apostle amen when God called him he was
[1:43:05] a fisherman he wasn't converted yet but
[1:43:08] he got predetermined this man going to
[1:43:10] make it through are you with me but said
[1:43:13] it this way don't forget that election
[1:43:16] looks back and says I was a cable I was
[1:43:18] born in sin shaping iniquity com to word
[1:43:21] speaking lies born among sinners father
[1:43:23] and mother all my family Sinners I was a
[1:43:25] CO but all of a sudden I become a wheat
[1:43:29] grein what happened what is that
[1:43:35] election so your present status is not
[1:43:37] as important as your
[1:43:40] election your election is more important
[1:43:42] than your
[1:43:45] sin I say this way your election is more
[1:43:48] powerful than your failures
[1:43:55] man say your failures God see your
[1:43:58] [Applause]

[1:53:19] God hallelujah come woman caught in very
[1:53:21] acad there's no here say now the real
[1:53:23] deal court and Jesus handled
[1:53:28] it with
[1:53:31] class Moses say they bring scripture and
[1:53:34] quote like the legalist will do in this
[1:53:36] message but say so say so okay he said
[1:53:40] do it Stone tree if you have no sin of
[1:53:44] course of course that's a different
[1:53:46] thing if he say Stoner there Stoner you
[1:53:48] know but the claws he put there which
[1:53:50] one you without sin cast the first one
[1:53:54] this one looking at this what you hear

[1:54:37] speaking less lies than somebody else or
[1:54:39] more
[1:54:39] [Music]
[1:54:41] lies some people speak more lies than
[1:54:44] others but the same lies you're born
[1:54:46] that way there not all have sinned and
[1:54:49] come short of the glory of all not some
[1:54:53] not the preachers have not sinned and
[1:54:55] and have not come no all have sinned and

[2:03:57] Revelation that your name is on that
[2:03:59] book that you're elected according to
[2:04:01] for knowledge of God now Peter stumbled
[2:04:04] so Peter know about falling Peter denied
[2:04:07] Christ so he was qualified to testify if
[2:04:10] you do these things you shall never fall
[2:04:13] he knew what falling is about so he knew
[2:04:15] what to do to not to fall a you are you
[2:04:18] with me now Peter understood that am so
[2:04:21] they could share that with us having
[2:04:23] escaped the corruption does the virtual
[2:04:25] lust strong desires your own self-will
[2:04:27] your own desires you want to push that

[2:05:32] of the Lord hallelujah praise be to
[2:05:35] Jesus oh could we give all some
[2:05:47] Praises so when Peter said he that lack
[2:05:50] these things is blind and C far off he
[2:05:53] is showing clearly that being forgiven
[2:05:55] of your sins does not mean you
[2:05:57] automatically grow
[2:06:00] God let me say it
[2:06:04] again when Peter said he that lacked
[2:06:06] these things is blind can't see a far
[2:06:08] off and has forgotten that he was purged
[2:06:10] from his old sins proven that being
[2:06:13] purged from your sins doesn't
[2:06:15] automatically make you climb up that
[2:06:20] tree say means your
[2:06:22] election to Salvation your election to
[2:06:26] Faith put you in a position to give all
[2:06:30] diligence
[2:06:31] add press push you have to be do that
[2:06:36] every day adding pressing pushing it
[2:06:41] cannot be I my sins forgive Rejoice ye
[2:06:43] children babes babes I write to you
[2:06:46] children because your sins are
[2:06:48] forgiven it has to go beyond that amen
[2:06:51] because want God want you to go beyond
[2:06:53] young men and God want you to become
[2:06:54] fathers which is adopted Sons God want
[2:06:57] you to come into spiritual maturity
[2:06:59] because he can't give children
[2:07:00] inheritance you give Sons inheritance
[2:07:02] mature Sons right Sons mature Sons so
[2:07:05] God wants to come into spiritual
[2:07:07] maturity that he could lose powers on
[2:07:10] you God not stingy you know God not
[2:07:12] holding back and holding back because
[2:07:13] God stingy it's not that it's character
[2:07:15] you want to connect with look if a man
[2:07:18] that can handle power power to trip
[2:07:20] people money does trip people big thing
[2:07:23] do trip people God understand that is
[2:07:25] human nature power Prime Minister
[2:07:28] President whatever it the CEO whatever
[2:07:30] mess people up because the character is
[2:07:32] not there to manage it so God bring a
[2:07:36] word message to bring character in
[2:07:38] because the dynamic struck the
[2:07:40] Pentecostal and they couldn't produce
[2:07:41] Jesus Christ they produced gifts with
[2:07:44] all the power tongues interpretation and
[2:07:46] Men commit in adultery and fooling wrong
[2:07:48] under that Dynamic inspiration so he
[2:07:50] brought the prophet with the word which
[2:07:52] will produce character but the trial of
[2:07:55] your faith because cor is not a gift
[2:07:59] Hallelujah
[2:08:00] Glory Faith virtue knowledge and is not
[2:08:03] gifts is you have to press into it
[2:08:06] trials and and and and tribulations and
[2:08:09] whatever shape you into it the Bible

[2:08:21] much amen but I'm still preaching
[2:08:26] it we have call PR message and that PR
[2:08:30] to be cut and honed he talk about Razor
[2:08:33] Edge he used the word about honed that
[2:08:36] is gr into a fine Edge Hallelujah
[2:08:39] scraping you off real good all your ways
[2:08:42] all your attitudes have to be scraped

[2:09:25] things you will never fall oh praise the

[2:10:40] selection election and choice which
[2:10:42] depends not on works of what man can do

[2:16:51] towards us in all wisdom and Prudence
[2:16:54] praise God watch having made to known to
[2:16:58] us the mystery of his will look at those
[2:17:00] words having made known to us the
[2:17:02] mystery of his will let a prophet put
[2:17:04] the magnifying glass in that the
[2:17:07] mysteries of his will and remember how
[2:17:09] we hung on that how many was here this
[2:17:11] morning let's see how we stuck on that
[2:17:13] the mystery of his will now it is not
[2:17:15] just a little thing it's a mystery God's
[2:17:19] will he's going deeper is a mystery and
[2:17:22] each man here we go you see you elected
[2:17:25] right am how many believe they
[2:17:30] elected I I I I'm not seeing those hand
[2:17:32] reallu it's God seeing those hands
[2:17:34] hallelujah hallelujah all right but
[2:17:38] listen now God's will is a mystery and
[2:17:41] each man has to seek out the will of God
[2:17:46] for his or her
[2:17:49] life so this is not automatic that's why
[2:17:53] the elect will have a certain Behavior
[2:17:56] the elect will seek the mystery of his
[2:17:57] will am God have born words your will is
[2:18:02] not the will of God for your life is not
[2:18:03] just to get grow up in church get
[2:18:05] subjects get a job get married got
[2:18:07] children and just
[2:18:08] die it has to have a higher purpose than
[2:18:12] that Hallelujah okay question and
[2:18:14] answers how does one know their rightful
[2:18:17] position in the body of Christ that's a
[2:18:19] good one how does one knows that's the
[2:18:22] kind of question amongst many of us here
[2:18:23] tonight how do you rightfully know I am
[2:18:26] presuming that this brother wants to
[2:18:27] know what position what in Christ what
[2:18:30] part of Christ do I play now for
[2:18:32] instance I like to say this brother to
[2:18:34] give you the best answer I know your
[2:18:36] position in Christ is revealed to you by
[2:18:39] the Holy
[2:18:42] Spirit one and then if you want to know
[2:18:46] if you want to know whether it is the
[2:18:49] holy spirit or not find out whether He
[2:18:52] blesses what you're doing or not if he
[2:18:55] blesses it then it's him if he doesn't
[2:18:57] bless like somebody said to me long ago
[2:18:59] the Lord called me to preach I said well
[2:19:01] then preach he said well you see I
[2:19:03] really think it's so Satan he can get
[2:19:05] somebody to act like that and then
[2:19:07] deceive them and just what he wants to
[2:19:09] do the whole point the world points the
[2:19:12] finger right there somebody thinks they
[2:19:13] have a gift of speaking in tongues
[2:19:14] interpretation has the gift of Divine
[2:19:16] Healing some of these things some
[2:19:17] sometimes they are mistaken in those
[2:19:19] things and sometime they think they
[2:19:20] haven't got it and when they have It's
[2:19:22] Tricky so always do this Brethren when
[2:19:25] you feel you're supposed to do a thing
[2:19:26] find out if it's scripture for you to do
[2:19:29] it not just wrote in one place I mean
[2:19:31] completely scriptural Through the Bible
[2:19:33] for you to go and do it and so on then
[2:19:34] you talk about your motive and objective
[2:19:36] and so on like that so that is very very
[2:19:38] interesting so praise God he say if a
[2:19:40] man came to be a pastor and he's real
[2:19:41] flighty and so on he said the Lord
[2:19:43] called me to such and such to be a
[2:19:45] pastor a pastor can't be a flighty
[2:19:46] person a pastor is solid a pastor is
[2:19:49] song just a few more ref finish Jesus
[2:19:52] had perfect Faith he had it he it it
[2:19:55] because he was the word and you become
[2:19:58] the word as you receive the word amen
[2:20:02] amen hallelujah glory and that receiving
[2:20:06] there is inwardly and
[2:20:08] willingly not outwardly inwardly and
[2:20:11] willingly so when you hear the word say
[2:20:13] you are elected you receive that when
[2:20:15] your words say you are forgiven you
[2:20:17] receive that when the words say you are
[2:20:18] Justified you're not studying what is
[2:20:19] happen no you receive that inwardly and
[2:20:23] willingly praise God now watch he said
[2:20:26] to us if you abide in me and I would
[2:20:27] abide in you you can ask what you will
[2:20:29] it shall be done then recognize your
[2:20:31] position in the scripture as a Believer

[2:20:46] so many bigrams today but you see God
[2:20:49] never made God made one Billy gram and
[2:20:52] you are just as important as Billy gram
[2:20:54] or robers or any one of those famous men
[2:20:56] you are just as important until you get
[2:20:59] out of your

[2:21:04] element yes sir in your place you are
[2:21:07] fine in your place is when you could
[2:21:09] have faith to believe God for anything

[2:25:32] called you to I am sure you can read
[2:25:34] between the lines what I'm saying

[2:25:41] God has called you well what is God
[2:25:42] doing transforming you from what you was

[2:25:51] you somewhere
[2:25:53] else who does that God does that take
[2:25:57] you from your lovely family because your

[2:26:42] transforming you from what you was he
[2:26:44] places you somewhere else because it is
[2:26:48] his way Hallelujah of by Renewing Your
[2:26:50] Mind to obey the word regardless of the
[2:26:54] price so if God want to see if you want
[2:26:56] to qualify if you're prepared to take
[2:26:58] the price he give you a big challenge am
[2:27:00] and if you can't pay the price you back

[2:27:19] lost his wife he lost his daughter but
[2:27:22] God was testing him he had to pay a
[2:27:24] price he had to help other people and he
[2:27:26] couldn't help his own family and when

[2:27:30] serving God and he just said it the Lord
[2:27:32] give and the Lord take it away blessed

[2:43:47] please remember her in prayer let's just
[2:43:49] approach the throne of grace once
[2:43:51] more Heavenly Father we thank you for
[2:43:54] your mercy and your grace towards
[2:43:57] us Lord knowledgeable cognizant that we
[2:44:00] have done nothing to deserve
[2:44:02] it Lord your Prophet taught us that if
[2:44:05] you were to do anything it Lord it
[2:44:07] wouldn't even be our prayers it'll be
[2:44:09] the grace of God and Lord the scripture
[2:44:12] clearly declares that The Headstone
[2:44:14] would come with shoutings crying Grace
[2:44:17] Grace Grace unto it father it's nothing
[2:44:20] but your grace that you have pulled us
[2:44:23] out from the world and pulled us out
[2:44:25] from the hustle and the bustle to Lord
[2:44:28] to respond to the call Father that was
[2:44:31] based on forn knowledge father Lord you
[2:44:34] call because you knew there'd be
[2:44:35] something in us to respond to the call
[2:44:38] and father we are so humbled and so
[2:44:40] privileged to have been called at such a
[2:44:43] time as this we thank you Lord for the
[2:44:46] message today Lord to shake us into
[2:44:49] making our calling an election sure as
[2:44:51] the scripture so clearly declares it's
[2:44:54] it's not about the minister or the
[2:44:56] church it's about the individual knowing
[2:44:59] where he or she stands father and Lord
[2:45:02] as we progress through this week and the
[2:45:05] rest of this evening and Lord may we be
[2:45:08] conscious that we have to give an
[2:45:10] account we have to answer we have to
[2:45:12] respond with
[2:45:14] something Lord May the word burn in our
[2:45:18] souls in a way that has never happened
[2:45:21] before Lord that we could check
[2:45:22] ourselves and we can look into the
[2:45:24] mirror the mirror not of our hopes or
[2:45:26] our expectations with the mirror of the
[2:45:28] word father Lord and we could compare
[2:45:31] ourselves to what has been clearly
[2:45:33] defined in the scripture and the
[2:45:35] revealed word to see if we measure up to
[2:45:37] that stature of a perfect man and father
[2:45:39] where we fall short father may we begin
[2:45:42] to step up Lord where we are lacking may
[2:45:45] you Lord add to us father Lord and may
[2:45:48] we add Lord as the word said to our
[2:45:50] faith virtue and knowledge all the way
[2:45:52] to charity father and Lord as we come to
[2:45:55] the end of this service Lord we thank
[2:45:57] you for life for health for strength and
[2:45:59] for the notes of Praises Lord for the
[2:46:02] Believers who see another year and Lord

[2:46:07] Praise but in there is a prayer request
[2:46:09] father Lord for the baptism of the Holy
[2:46:11] Ghost father Lord your Prophet taught us
[2:46:14] that you are more willing and you want
[2:46:16] to give us the Holy Ghost more than we
[2:46:18] even want want to receive it father Lord
[2:46:21] May on this day her her natural birthday
[2:46:23] may it be a spiritual birth for her also
[2:46:26] and may you baptize her into the kingdom
[2:46:29] of God lord as your word teaches Lord
[2:46:32] with fire from heaven and may she have
