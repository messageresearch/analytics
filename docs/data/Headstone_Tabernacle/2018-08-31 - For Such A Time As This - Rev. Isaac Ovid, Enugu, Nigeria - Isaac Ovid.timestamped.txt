[46:29] and before I greet you I just wanna go
[46:32] straight to the scripture and then we'll
[46:34] do the greetings just want to read one
[46:36] portion of Scripture this morning
[46:38] reading from the book of Esther chapter
[46:44] 4 and reading from verse 9 Esther
[46:48] chapter 4 and reading from verse 9
[47:07] as the 4 and verse 9 and he that came
[47:12] and Toole Esther the words of Mordecai
[47:15] again as to spook speak unto he tack and
[47:18] give him commandment unto Mordecai all
[47:21] the king's servants and the people of
[47:23] the king's provinces do know that
[47:25] whosoever whether man or woman shall
[47:28] come unto the king into the inner court
[47:30] who is not call there is one law of his
[47:33] to put him to death except such to whom
[47:36] the King shall hold out the golden
[47:38] scepter that he may live but I have not
[47:42] been called to come into the king these
[47:44] thirty days and they toll to Mordecai
[47:47] Esther's words then Mordecai commanded
[47:50] to answer Esther
[47:51] think not with thyself that thou shalt
[47:54] escape in the king's house more than all
[47:57] the Jews for if thou altogether holdest
[48:00] thy peace at this time then shall there
[48:03] enlargement and deliverance arise to the
[48:06] Jews from another place but thou and my
[48:09] father's house shall be destroyed and
[48:11] who know it whether thou art come to the
[48:14] kingdom for such a time as is then
[48:17] Esther bade them return Mordecai this
[48:19] answer go gather together all the Jews
[48:22] at a present in Shushan and fast he for
[48:25] me and neither eat nor drink three days
[48:28] night or day I also and my maidens will
[48:31] fast likewise and so while I go in unto
[48:35] the King which is not according to the
[48:37] law and if I perish I perish
[48:39] so Mordecai went his way and did
[48:41] according to all that Esther had
[48:43] commanded him may the Lord that a
[48:45] blessing to the reading of his word you
[48:47] may be seated this morning I greet you
[48:50] this morning in the precious name of
[48:51] Jesus Christ and it's certainly a
[48:54] privilege to be here in in nugu Nigeria
[48:56] once again among believers of like
[48:59] precious faith amen and I want to
[49:02] certainly greet with the Charles god
[49:04] bless you the host pastor you preach it
[49:05] with the Charles no other ministers and
[49:08] churches that I here like to greet all
[49:09] the ministers and the churches I
[49:11] certainly want to acknowledge and greet
[49:13] the ministers that have already spoken
[49:15] by the ek brother Jean no but a daily
[49:18] God bless you brothers your preacher
[49:20] the messages thus far amen amen amen
[49:25] amen
[49:26] so we are here we are here for another
[49:31] battle because you can't have a victory
[49:35] unless there is a battle and brother
[49:38] Charles has a very powerful inspiration
[49:40] the manifestation of the Omega bride
[49:43] heroes you know and the word here is a
[49:46] powerful word it speaks up people who
[49:48] are courageous adventurers they break
[49:50] the norm and and the world has sort of
[49:52] used that word and have heroes and
[49:54] superheroes and all of these things they
[49:57] make up Superman and Batman and all
[49:59] these heroes they want to put in a young
[50:01] people's minds and nothing on the real
[50:03] heroes of fear that actually walk the
[50:05] earth you have young people who know
[50:08] more about Batman than the real heroes
[50:11] our faith can the church say Amen but we
[50:15] are called to be true Omega bright
[50:17] heroes in such a time as this
[50:20] every biblical character we read has a
[50:23] unique place has a unique role has a
[50:25] unique purpose
[50:26] for some we read in Scripture the
[50:29] stories of their lives span for decades
[50:31] for others we only read about them for a
[50:34] few hours but with our limited ability
[50:37] and our minds ability to comprehend
[50:40] every aspect of Scripture it is hard to
[50:43] place a value of one hero in the Bible
[50:45] above another because every single one
[50:48] had a role to play how do you compare
[50:51] Abraham with Noah how do you compare
[50:54] Noah with Jeremiah how do you compare
[50:56] Elijah with simon of cyrene we all know
[51:00] about Elijah Elijah shot to heaven
[51:02] that's a hero
[51:03] Elijah cause of fire Elijah drop the
[51:06] mantle on Elijah the impact of Elijah's
[51:10] ministry was so measurable that King
[51:13] Ahab calls Elijah the one who troubles
[51:17] Israel hallelujah so heroes are
[51:21] disruptive heroes are known for causing
[51:24] a problem
[51:25] heroes are called for trouble in the
[51:27] water
[51:28] are there any heroes in enugu this
[51:30] morning hallelujah
[51:35] you may be seated I say to the young
[51:37] people if the devil doesn't know your
[51:39] name is a problem because you are
[51:42] supposed to be on his radar he is
[51:44] supposed to know your name oh I know
[51:47] pizza I know of Mia I know we have got
[51:52] to be heroes that disrupt the order of
[51:54] things somebody preached back to me you
[51:58] may be seated
[51:58] so when you read about the heroes of
[52:01] faith Elijah was the one that troubles
[52:04] Israel his rule covers many years this
[52:07] is just a background I'm gonna get to my
[52:08] text shortly can the church say man more
[52:12] than that the spirit of Elijah God is so
[52:15] good that he could take a spirit and use
[52:19] it more than once because the spirit
[52:21] speaks of something so the spirit of
[52:24] Elijah that heroic spirit that befallen
[52:26] Elijah that's heroic spirit to be thrown
[52:29] undone the Baptist that same spirit of
[52:32] Elijah was found on William Miriam
[52:34] Branham and that seems Curt will come
[52:37] back again to the Jews so don't tell me
[52:40] we cannot have heroes because God
[52:42] promised a visitation and he said the
[52:44] spirit of Elijah will rest upon Elijah
[52:48] can the church Shaymin you may be seated
[52:52] for a moment so everyone has a ministry
[52:57] for the random said everyone has a role
[52:59] of being a hero I'm listening a
[53:00] background before the message Elijah is
[53:03] one of the bigger names we know but what
[53:05] about Simon of Cyrene Simon of Cyrene
[53:11] was not a prophet there are no books
[53:14] written about him his name is not found
[53:17] in the record of ebro's 11 when Paul
[53:20] recounts the heroes of faith but in
[53:23] God's great drama
[53:24] in which we all have a place he finds
[53:27] himself in a purse Emilia place at a
[53:30] unique time
[53:31] Simon of Cyrene is not a Jew he is not a
[53:35] Roman he is from Cyrene but he finds
[53:38] himself in Jerusalem in the closing days
[53:41] of Jesus's ministry I'm here to tell you
[53:44] everybody who is called is a hero
[53:47] everyone has a part to play and okay the
[53:50] size of the park it's important that we
[53:53] play our part
[53:54] oh come on somebody preach back to me
[53:56] and if we find our place then the devil
[54:00] is finished because we're the Branum
[54:02] said perfect faith is based on your
[54:04] position' when you're in your position
[54:07] you can tell the devil get out of here
[54:09] because this is mine this is my house
[54:11] this is my family these are my children
[54:14] this is my body and sickness has no
[54:18] right in this body because I know my
[54:21] place I know my position I know what I'm
[54:24] called to do somebody preach back to me
[54:30] you may be seated
[54:34] can I talk about Simon is fluid so Simon
[54:37] of Cyrene he's on a Roman he's from
[54:39] Cyrene but he finds himself in the
[54:43] closing pages of Jesus's ministry the
[54:46] entire Old Testament was pointing to the
[54:50] coming Messiah the entire New Testament
[54:52] were talk about the Messiah what he did
[54:56] how he lived and how he would forever
[54:59] change the world but Simon of Cyrene
[55:02] call him the unlikely hero finds himself
[55:09] in the middle of a crowd of people
[55:11] around the days just after the Feast of
[55:14] the Passover and with this his three
[55:17] people carrying crosses a may away to be
[55:21] crucified crucifixions were common in
[55:24] Jerusalem but this day was different
[55:26] among the men to be crucified was a man
[55:29] called Jesus a man who did nothing to
[55:32] deserve it
[55:33] a man without sin he was being laughed
[55:36] at he was being mocked he was being spit
[55:39] upon he was bruised
[55:40] he was tired he was weary and he could
[55:43] no longer carry his cross oh how
[55:50] precious it is to carry the cross of
[55:52] Jesus and Simon of Cyrene was commanded
[55:56] to carry the cross with the weight of
[56:00] sin and Jesus's shoulder what a blessing
[56:02] to be able to carry his cross we can go
[56:05] on and on but every biblical character
[56:08] stepped forward playing their roles in
[56:11] God's drama can the church say Amen
[56:15] maybe see there for a minute I'm gonna
[56:18] get to the teeth he's gonna touch was
[56:20] actually one here I'm trying to get to
[56:21] this morning yet for all of the biblical
[56:26] characters in the drama of God there is
[56:30] one that has a unique distinction he is
[56:34] described by God and bought the old and
[56:37] the New Testament as a man after my own
[56:40] heart
[56:41] you know what I'm talking about a man
[56:45] which shall fulfill all my will the man
[56:48] called David I just want to talk about
[56:51] David for a few minutes before I strike
[56:52] my Texas morning when the children of
[56:57] Israel of Turin of God looked around
[56:59] them they saw everybody else at Kings
[57:01] and they said we want a king like that
[57:03] and that was not God's plan but it did
[57:06] step into God's permissive will as it
[57:09] were and the popular vote the man's
[57:11] choice was Sol he was tall he was he was
[57:16] a good family man he was a powerful man
[57:18] and and they loved this man's soul and
[57:21] that was man's choice but David's was
[57:24] God's choice when we talk about the life
[57:27] of David
[57:27] what makes David unique is that many
[57:30] things come to mind the little shepherd
[57:32] boy the musician we think of him
[57:36] anointed by Samuel as you read the
[57:39] Psalms in the life of David you see
[57:42] every emotion that is possible moment in
[57:47] the life of David you see joy
[57:50] you see peace
[57:52] you see fear you seep in you see grief
[57:56] you see sadness you see desire you see
[58:00] every possible emotion that a man could
[58:02] ever possess you see David he grows up
[58:05] in front of our very eyes but this is
[58:07] one of God's heroes can the church say
[58:10] Amen throughout scripture you could see
[58:15] the glimpse of people lives here and
[58:17] there you don't know much about this one
[58:18] you you don't know much about this one
[58:20] but David is different we see him as a
[58:22] shepherd we see him as a hunter we see
[58:25] him as a warrior we see him as a general
[58:28] we see him as a king we see him as a
[58:30] poet we see him as a champion we see him
[58:34] as an outlaw we seem as a ladies man
[58:36] we see him as a musician we see him as a
[58:38] prophet
[58:39] we seem as a worship leader we see him
[58:42] as an adulterer we see him as a murderer
[58:44] we seem as a brother we see him as a
[58:47] husband
[58:47] we seem as a son we seem as a parent we
[58:50] see him as a leader we see him as a hero
[58:53] we see him as a bulldog we see him as an
[58:55] ancestor of the lineage of price
[58:59] see a man after God's own heart despite
[59:05] his ups and downs he was still numbered
[59:08] in Hebrews 11 and I'm here to say this
[59:11] morning despite your ups and downs you
[59:14] will be and f-number God's Omega bride
[59:22] he rose you may be seated
[59:25] I'm gonna get to the tech shortly but I
[59:28] didn't want to take encouragement
[59:30] because whenever whenever you kind of
[59:31] feel it alone you can always go to the
[59:33] sounds and he could pull encouragement
[59:38] from the sounds so David's weeks and
[59:41] these are familiar but it is morally a
[59:42] scriptural foundation sounds 23 we know
[59:45] it the Lord is my shepherd ease in
[59:47] yourself so I shall not want he maketh
[59:51] me to lie down in green pastures he
[59:53] leadeth me beside the still waters he
[59:56] restoreth my soul he leadeth me in the
[59:59] paths of righteousness for his name's
[1:00:01] sake yea though i walk through the
[1:00:04] valley this is how he rose speak yea
[1:00:07] though i walk through the valley of the
[1:00:09] shadow of death hear the words of a hero
[1:00:12] i will fear no evil for thou art with me
[1:00:15] thy rod and thy staff they comfort me
[1:00:18] you may be seated for a minute don't
[1:00:20] prepare as a table for me in the
[1:00:23] presence of my enemies don't tell me you
[1:00:25] can have enemies because he wants to
[1:00:27] prepare table in the presence of your
[1:00:30] somebody preach back to me this morning
[1:00:33] I don't care what devil demons
[1:00:36] Marit give God the opportunity to
[1:00:40] prepare table for you in the presence of
[1:00:43] your enemies thou anointest my head with
[1:00:46] oil my cup runneth over
[1:00:49] slowly goodness and mercy shall follow
[1:00:53] me wherever I go goodness and mercy
[1:00:57] whenever I leave my house goodness and
[1:01:00] mercy when I go to school goodness and
[1:01:04] mercy when I'm in the job goodness and
[1:01:07] mercy will follow me all the days of my
[1:01:12] life and I will dwell in the house of
[1:01:14] the Lord forever

[1:01:22] live like a hero come on now somebody
[1:01:25] bridge back to me

[1:01:36] black man and their black pant on let
[1:01:39] them keep those heroes I wanna be a real
[1:01:41] hero I wanna walk on water

[1:01:46] speak to the elements I wanna say little
[1:01:48] fish I give you back your life that's a
[1:01:51] real hero
[1:01:59] you may be seated you may be seen it for
[1:02:04] a minute
[1:02:05] a hero doesn't mean you won't get afraid
[1:02:07] because heroes is window when fear is
[1:02:10] there
[1:02:11] you still act when all have us against
[1:02:14] you then you act so unless sunset is
[1:02:16] hero speak listener a hero David speak

[1:02:32] that's how heroes sweep but Thou O Lord
[1:02:36] after shield for me my glory and the
[1:02:39] lifter of my head I cried unto the Lord

[1:02:50] morning hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah

[1:03:18] foot to be moved and since your
[1:03:24] testimony this morning you don't know
[1:03:26] how you made it but by God's grace you
[1:03:28] making it because there's something in
[1:03:31] you that's rigged estimated to make it
[1:03:42] and last one if David was here this
[1:03:45] morning he would say I was glad when
[1:03:47] they said unto me let us go into the
[1:03:50] house of the law remember the troubles
[1:03:53] can we get the Lord a hand of praise you
[1:04:01] may be seated
[1:04:05] [Music]
[1:04:10] hallelujah hallelujah so for a title
[1:04:15] this morning for such a time as this for
[1:04:19] such a time as this I remember their
[1:04:22] daily was speaking last night and he
[1:04:25] started to speak about Esther where the
[1:04:27] raishin might I tell you God is good I
[1:04:32] saw my notes that I just fly over the
[1:04:34] place but I want to speak a bit about
[1:04:37] Esther this morning but before I get to
[1:04:40] that in a message of blushing profit but
[1:04:43] the Perim said it ought to be the
[1:04:44] happiest time in the world for the
[1:04:46] Christian it ought to be the happiest
[1:04:49] time times are going to change the old
[1:04:51] is going to become young that's gonna
[1:04:55] fleet away sickness will be no more no
[1:04:58] more prayer meetings for the sick no
[1:05:00] more prayer meetings for the lost but
[1:05:02] God will come and take the elect from
[1:05:04] the four winds of the earth and shall
[1:05:06] gather them under his wings and we live
[1:05:08] and reign with him forever that's our
[1:05:10] promise oh brother sister friend of mine
[1:05:14] if you're not prepared tonight may you
[1:05:16] be prepared at this hour
[1:05:18] I give you an invitation to come to
[1:05:20] Christ tonight and receive you that's
[1:05:24] been different you don't know you're not
[1:05:25] where you should be with God I invite
[1:05:28] you to the altar with myself I invite
[1:05:30] every one of you to come here and not
[1:05:33] only see but to stay here in this
[1:05:36] meeting until God has kinds your soul
[1:05:38] from everything that's unlike him until
[1:05:42] you can go out of here a new person not
[1:05:44] with a corn plaster on will go out of
[1:05:47] here with a blood transfusion that
[1:05:49] purifies your blood and gives you new
[1:05:52] life and new hope go out with the
[1:05:54] baptism of the Holy Spirit can the
[1:05:57] church say man so I'm the happiest man
[1:06:00] alive this morning to see the
[1:06:02] fulfillment of Malachi fours message
[1:06:05] coming into view hallelujah I don't need
[1:06:09] to see an external sign I can see it
[1:06:11] happening because what is happening God
[1:06:13] already so for all of this and it's
[1:06:15] unfolding his plan and the Holy Spirit
[1:06:18] the dynamics is all over you
[1:06:20] this morning to get rid to baptize you
[1:06:23] by fire but the Branham said I'm
[1:06:25] identified with a group that feels a
[1:06:27] spirit of God I'm identified with a
[1:06:29] group that knows he's unreal
[1:06:31] no he's a same yesterday today and
[1:06:33] forever and know that this is not
[1:06:35] fanaticism it's Jesus Christ to see me
[1:06:38] yesterday and today and forever
[1:06:40] I'm identified with that group they are
[1:06:42] called a bunch of heretics yet a bunch
[1:06:45] of fanaticism an account of the Word of
[1:06:47] God but I'm not ashamed of the gospel of
[1:06:50] Jesus Christ for it's the power of God
[1:06:54] unto salvation so I'm an expectation for
[1:06:57] a church that Jesus Christ could walk
[1:06:59] into a church full of power a church to
[1:07:02] unite with the headstone a church that
[1:07:05] know that Jesus Christ is the same
[1:07:06] yesterday today and forever
[1:07:10] so for such a time as this
[1:07:13] do you know who you are church you are
[1:07:16] predestinated seeds of God the final
[1:07:19] voice to the final age a manifestation
[1:07:23] of the prophets prophesy in the message
[1:07:25] Christ is the mystery of God reveal I'm
[1:07:27] in a background now what are you gonna
[1:07:29] do when you get all that group together
[1:07:31] where the revelation is perfectly in
[1:07:35] harmony and God expressing it through
[1:07:37] his word by the same actions the same
[1:07:40] thing that he did
[1:07:41] making the world manifest oh if the
[1:07:44] church only knew its position it will
[1:07:48] one day then the rapture will go can the
[1:07:51] church say Amen Oh hallelujah and the
[1:07:54] secret is out the bride knows who she is
[1:07:57] you couldn't come here by chance you
[1:07:59] didn't come here by accident
[1:08:01] young brother young sister all of the
[1:08:03] struggles and the child want to bring
[1:08:05] you to this squatter

[1:15:16] promised ever him walking living talking
[1:15:19] can the church say Amen can the church
[1:15:22] say Amen so let me strike my text the
[1:15:29] year is around fortune on 83 BC and the
[1:15:34] people known as the Hebrews the churun
[1:15:36] of Israel the Jews they had been exiled
[1:15:38] and scattered trolli Empire of the Medes
[1:15:41] and the Persians the Medes and the
[1:15:44] Persians had just conquered the
[1:15:46] Babylonians and throughout biblical
[1:15:48] history whenever the churn of Israel
[1:15:50] sinned there were dire consequences as a
[1:15:54] result of their sin they were conquered
[1:15:56] by various kingdoms Daniel the prophet
[1:15:58] saw an image which represented a great
[1:16:01] kingdoms and at that time the world was
[1:16:04] ruled by a despotic monarch King I swear
[1:16:07] us as where the daily spoke of yesterday
[1:16:10] students of history would know him I
[1:16:12] another name 'search sees the Bible said
[1:16:15] he ruled from India to Ethiopia over 127
[1:16:19] province
[1:16:20] the most powerful man in the world at
[1:16:23] that time
[1:16:24] and bratayley said yesterday he called a
[1:16:26] big celebration a big event to celebrate
[1:16:30] this was the third year of his reign he
[1:16:31] was three years into his ministry as it
[1:16:34] were and after the great display and
[1:16:36] after the seven days he called for his
[1:16:39] greatest treasure
[1:16:40] he called for Queen Vashti and vast he
[1:16:44] said she wasn't gonna come and the king
[1:16:47] was angry not only the king was angry
[1:16:50] but all of his men were angry the
[1:16:52] princes were angry the generals were
[1:16:55] angry and they said to themselves and
[1:16:57] they told the King King if you don't do
[1:16:59] something about this this flashy problem
[1:17:02] will become a world problem because all
[1:17:04] of our wives will refuse to come we'll
[1:17:06] be calling read the Bible so the
[1:17:11] princess went to the king and say please
[1:17:13] you have to do something because from
[1:17:16] large and small all the women will
[1:17:19] refuse to come when the men call them
[1:17:21] [Applause]
[1:17:29] so right there when the king partnered
[1:17:31] and the princess prominent they say lets
[1:17:34] us find a new queen and the Bible says
[1:17:38] for four years there was no queen
[1:17:40] because it was in the seventh year bear
[1:17:43] in mind that she was removed in the
[1:17:45] third year it was in the seventh year
[1:17:47] that Esther makes her appearance and I'm
[1:17:52] gonna tell it said she refused a dawning
[1:17:54] of the world she refused the styles of
[1:17:58] the world she had access to everything
[1:18:00] but she rejected it
[1:18:03] preferring to take counsel and how she
[1:18:06] could please the King come the church
[1:18:09] Shaymin but as always whenever God's
[1:18:19] children are getting put in place is
[1:18:20] always an enemy around looking and the
[1:18:24] Bible says there was a man called
[1:18:26] Heymann what makes human interesting is
[1:18:36] human should never have existed
[1:18:38] I must seen it lightly because Haman was
[1:18:45] of the descendants of the Amalekites
[1:18:49] and at that time the Amalekites should
[1:18:53] not have existed because instructions
[1:18:56] were given many years ago to wipe out
[1:18:59] all the Amalekites had the Amalekites
[1:19:03] been wiped out Haman would not have been
[1:19:05] born
[1:19:06] [Applause]
[1:19:09] [Music]
[1:19:11] [Applause]
[1:19:16] [Music]
[1:19:20] listen to this the Bible says I went it
[1:19:23] sure enough Israel left Egypt I want you
[1:19:26] to catch the picture when the
[1:19:28] tournament's are left Egypt they had
[1:19:30] left from being slaves they were not
[1:19:32] warriors they were not fighters they had
[1:19:35] been slaves they had been in bondage
[1:19:37] they had no army they were no coming
[1:19:42] together as a people now the Bible
[1:19:44] speaks of Hittites Jebusites Amalekites
[1:19:46] philistines they all have their own
[1:19:48] attributes their own roles we didn't
[1:19:51] know this morning with the Amalekites
[1:19:55] the Bible said the Amalekites attacked
[1:19:59] them when they were at their weakest the
[1:20:05] Philistines our people our strength so
[1:20:08] they bring Goliath out because they
[1:20:10] don't want to be known as weak so they
[1:20:12] say send me a man to fight our strongman
[1:20:14] the Amalekites are different the
[1:20:17] Amalekites wait for when you're down and
[1:20:19] that's when the Amalekites spirit
[1:20:20] attacks you it's that one winner week is
[1:20:24] that one try to finish you off
[1:20:26] listen to Deuteronomy 25 17 listen to
[1:20:30] the Bible Deuteronomy 25 verse 70
[1:20:33] remember when what Amalek did unto thee
[1:20:36] by the way when he came forth out of
[1:20:38] Egypt how he met thee by the way and
[1:20:41] smooth behind most of the even all that
[1:20:44] were feeble behind me when thou was
[1:20:47] famed and weary and he had not good
[1:20:52] therefore it shall be when the LORD thy
[1:20:55] God had given the rest from all the
[1:20:58] enemies round about in the land which
[1:21:00] the LORD thy God had given thee for an
[1:21:03] inheritance to possess that dole shall
[1:21:06] blot out the remembrance of Amalek from
[1:21:09] under heaven so the instruction was
[1:21:13] wiped them out completely block out
[1:21:16] their memory from under heaven can the
[1:21:20] church say Amen
[1:21:23] but unfortunately instead of blood
[1:21:26] animal we find them recurring Exodus 17
[1:21:29] then came Amalek and fought with Israel
[1:21:32] in referendum and Moses said unto Joshua
[1:21:35] choose out men and go and fight with
[1:21:37] amalek tomorrow I will stand on top of
[1:21:40] the hill with the rod of God in my hand
[1:21:42] so just what did as Moses that said to
[1:21:44] him and fought with
[1:21:45] Amalek and Moses Aaron and a hood went
[1:21:48] up to the top of the hill you remember
[1:21:49] that and it came to pass when Moses L of
[1:21:52] his hand that Israel prevailed and when
[1:21:54] he let down his hand Amalek revealed
[1:21:56] these are the same Amalekites
[1:21:58] but Moses hands were heavy and they took
[1:22:02] a stone and put it under him and he sat
[1:22:04] thereon and Aaron and Hur stayed up with
[1:22:06] his hands and one under one side and the
[1:22:08] other on the other side and his hands
[1:22:10] were steady until the going down of the
[1:22:12] Sun and Joshua discomforted Amalek and
[1:22:15] his people with the edge of the sword
[1:22:17] and the Lord of the Moses write this for
[1:22:19] a memorial in a book and rehearse it in
[1:22:22] the ears of Josefa for I will utterly
[1:22:25] put out the remembrance of Amalek from
[1:22:28] under heaven that's how God was serious
[1:22:32] about this and Moses built an altar and
[1:22:34] called the name of it
[1:22:36] Jehovah Nissi for he said because the
[1:22:38] Lord had sworn that the Lord will have
[1:22:40] war with Amalek from generation to
[1:22:42] generation friends you should have
[1:22:45] killed all of the Amalekites in the
[1:22:52] message question and answer but Abraham
[1:22:53] said when Joshua entered the land of
[1:22:56] Canaan he said don't you let one of them
[1:22:58] live it was a cute little baby
[1:23:00] a little Amalekite oh and amirite kill
[1:23:02] it you remember he'll grow up to be an
[1:23:05] Amalekite he'll political and when these
[1:23:07] little things come back like that
[1:23:09] disagreeing with the Word of God
[1:23:11] it's an Amalekite spirit get rid of that
[1:23:13] thing I don't care what the nomination
[1:23:16] it belongs to you say well they're good
[1:23:18] I don't care how good of people they are
[1:23:20] if they are contrary to that word get
[1:23:23] that thing out of you it's a growing
[1:23:25] little Amalekite
[1:23:26] it looks cute looks innocent it looks
[1:23:29] like it's all right but don't have
[1:23:31] nothing to do with it
[1:23:32] you stay Oh
[1:23:33] from it you just remember listen to the
[1:23:38] Prophet any Amalekite and he describes
[1:23:41] it if he finds it anything that denies
[1:23:43] the word that's an Amalekite stay away
[1:23:47] from it have nothing to do with it how
[1:23:50] many believe that's the truth can the
[1:23:53] church say Amen
[1:23:54] [Applause]
[1:23:55] kill all the Amalekites by judges
[1:24:00] chapter three to trace this Amalekites
[1:24:03] spirit the Amalekites formed an alliance
[1:24:06] with more against the churn of israel by
[1:24:10] judges 6 when we meet Delia and the
[1:24:12] mighty man of Valor Gideon was raised up
[1:24:15] to fight Amelia Knights and judges 6 she
[1:24:19] says I'm so it was when Israel had shown
[1:24:21] that the Midianites came up and the
[1:24:24] Amalekites is still in hiding among the
[1:24:28] Midianites and the churn of the east
[1:24:31] even they came up against him this
[1:24:33] morning I'm tired of ism allegories we
[1:24:37] need to kill them all I could imagine as
[1:24:40] the Israel spies looking over at the
[1:24:42] meteorites asking what it was a Malachi
[1:24:44] still doing it I thought we had killed
[1:24:46] him
[1:24:46] I told me I'd wipe them all out can the
[1:24:49] church say man by the time we get to
[1:24:51] Samuel Sammy well sell on the soil in
[1:24:55] Samuel 1 the Lord sent me to anoint to
[1:24:58] be king over his people over Israel now
[1:25:03] therefore hearken unto the voice of the
[1:25:05] word of the Lord thus saith the Lord of
[1:25:07] hosts I remember that which I am elected
[1:25:10] to Israel so by the time you reach
[1:25:12] Samuel God is still talking about we
[1:25:14] need to get these Amalekites out how he
[1:25:20] lead wait for him in the way when he
[1:25:22] came up from Egypt no go and smite the
[1:25:26] first man leads Saul God was going smite
[1:25:29] he ammolite go and smite amalek and
[1:25:33] utterly destroy all that they have and
[1:25:35] spared him not but slip both man and
[1:25:38] woman in front and so on and so gather
[1:25:40] the people together and Saul came to the
[1:25:43] city of Amalek and live wheat in the
[1:25:44] valley
[1:25:45] and Saul said unto the Kenites go dpad
[1:25:47] get you down among the Amalekites let's
[1:25:49] I destroy you with them and so on and
[1:25:51] small soil smoothie America it's from
[1:25:54] hvala until they come to show and he
[1:25:57] took a gag the king of the Amalekites
[1:26:00] alive and utterly destroyed all the
[1:26:03] people with the edge of the sword but
[1:26:04] Saul and the people spear eager and the
[1:26:09] best of the sheep and of the oxen and of
[1:26:12] the fatlings and the Lambs and all that
[1:26:15] was good and would not utterly destroy
[1:26:17] them but everything that was vile and
[1:26:21] refused that they utterly destroyed in
[1:26:23] other words they destroy the stuff they
[1:26:25] didn't want but it was some stuff they
[1:26:27] wanted to keep their beating nice sheep
[1:26:33] soft idea like they kept it in cooling
[1:26:36] the king himself
[1:26:37] then came the word of the Lord at the
[1:26:39] Samuel seeing it repented me that I have
[1:26:41] set up Saul to be king for he has turned
[1:26:44] back from following me and had not
[1:26:46] performed my commandments and it grieves
[1:26:49] Samy when he cried unto the Lord all
[1:26:51] night and went semi well rose early to
[1:26:54] meet all in the morning it was it was
[1:26:56] told Samuel seeing Saul Kim to come out
[1:26:58] and be holy set him up on a police and
[1:27:00] is going about and passed on and down
[1:27:02] together and Samuel came to soil and
[1:27:05] soil on him
[1:27:06] blessed be thou of the Lord I have
[1:27:08] performed the commandment of the Lord
[1:27:09] and then Samuel as what meaneth then
[1:27:11] this bleating of this sheep why am i
[1:27:15] here she beated an alluring of oxen
[1:27:19] which I hear and Saul said they have
[1:27:21] brought them from the Amalekites for the
[1:27:24] people spread the best of the sheep and
[1:27:26] of the Occidental sacrifice unto the
[1:27:28] Lord and the rest we have utterly
[1:27:30] destroyed but these we have kept it as a
[1:27:32] sacrifice and Samuel said on the soles T
[1:27:35] and I will tell you what the Lord had
[1:27:37] said to me this night and he said unto
[1:27:39] him say on and Samuel said when dough
[1:27:41] was little in their own sight what stole
[1:27:43] not me the head of the tribes of Israel
[1:27:45] and a lot of no entity king over Israel
[1:27:48] in other words
[1:27:48] Samuel is putting soil in his place and
[1:27:52] the Lord send me on a journey and said
[1:27:54] go and utterly destroy the sinners the
[1:27:57] malachite and fight against them until
[1:27:59] they become soon
[1:28:00] wherefore tenderness doumitt obey the
[1:28:03] voice of the Lord but there is fly upon
[1:28:05] the spoil and did its evil in the sight
[1:28:08] of the Lord and source it on the summer
[1:28:10] year I have appeared the voice of the
[1:28:12] Lord and I've gone the way which the
[1:28:13] Lord sent me and I've brought a gag
[1:28:15] the king of Amalek and I utterly destroy
[1:28:18] the Amalekites but the people took up
[1:28:20] the spoil sheep an ox and the chief of
[1:28:22] things which should have utterly been
[1:28:24] destroyed to sacrifice and that's where
[1:28:27] we see obedience is better than
[1:28:28] sacrifice and Sammy well said on the
[1:28:31] soil
[1:28:32] I will not return with me for thou has
[1:28:33] rejected the word of the Lord can the
[1:28:37] church see man halleluyah halleluyah
[1:28:41] halleluyah
[1:28:42] blessed be the name of the Lord can we
[1:28:44] give the Lord a hand the praise
[1:28:52] now so by the time we get to Queen
[1:28:59] Esther we have here money aggregate
[1:29:01] without the line of King Agag these
[1:29:04] Amalekites find a way weaving all over
[1:29:08] and now we understand why Monica I could
[1:29:11] not bow to him because this was the
[1:29:17] Amalekites spirit Mordecai was not just
[1:29:20] not born because but it was the same
[1:29:21] Malachi - I come true
[1:29:28] so when everybody else is bumming on to
[1:29:30] this Amalekite is human Mordecai the
[1:29:33] unknowing is to bow before no man an
[1:29:36] order clock he's wondering why is this a
[1:29:38] malachite still alive
[1:29:48] we might be in bondage but I still have
[1:29:51] to bow to normal okay
[1:29:52] I kept in the lands of the Medes and the
[1:29:55] Persians but I will not prouder and
[1:29:57] Amalekites come to church Shaymin you
[1:30:03] may be seated
[1:30:03] I'm God always has a witness the Bible
[1:30:06] says every day
[1:30:07] they tried to convince Mordechai turbo
[1:30:10] every day to try to come miss Mordechai
[1:30:12] to believe that the way they believes
[1:30:14] it's ok to about him now bear in mind
[1:30:16] all the other children of Israel who
[1:30:17] were there oh boy except Mordechai they
[1:30:21] wanted Mordechai to see that these
[1:30:22] Americans are passed they wanted
[1:30:24] Mordecai to say we're never gonna have a
[1:30:26] revival they wanted more than I to say
[1:30:28] we we making too much noise and we
[1:30:30] shouldn't act us where it was it
[1:30:31] Mordecai to conform and bow down to
[1:30:34] order and to bow down to a system and
[1:30:36] Monique I said no I can't do this that's
[1:30:39] not what I'm built or - I Know Who I am
[1:30:42] I could be in prison but I know who I am
[1:30:44] I could be in Egypt but I Know Who I am
[1:30:46] I could be in Nigeria but I know who I
[1:30:49] am I could be in America but I Know Who
[1:30:52] I am and church seamen and it angered
[1:30:59] Heymann because that spirit upon him and
[1:31:02] wanted worship can the church say man
[1:31:05] and Satan is mad because you refuse to
[1:31:08] worship Him and you worship the real
[1:31:10] King you worship your Lord can the
[1:31:13] church say man you may be seated
[1:31:19] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[1:31:23] Heymann was so angry he didn't even want
[1:31:26] to take it out on Mordecai alone he say
[1:31:29] let's wipe out everybody and that's what
[1:31:31] the enemy has tried to do wipe out
[1:31:33] everybody he said I can't kill Monica
[1:31:35] alone I want to kill all the Jews then
[1:31:37] he mad said unto the king
[1:31:39] there's a certain people scattered
[1:31:40] abroad they dispersed among the people
[1:31:43] in all the provinces of thy kingdom and
[1:31:45] their laws are diverse from all people
[1:31:48] this is some familiar their laws are
[1:31:51] different from all people neither keep
[1:31:54] thee there's a king's laws in other
[1:31:56] words they have their own laws they have
[1:31:58] their own Kingdom it would seem they
[1:32:00] they seem to have their own king they
[1:32:02] live among
[1:32:02] just but they're not of us they don't
[1:32:04] seem to respect the way we do things it
[1:32:06] they go to our schools but they operate
[1:32:09] differently they walk the streets where
[1:32:11] they are differently they're dispersed
[1:32:12] throughout all your provinces all 127
[1:32:16] provinces you'll find one there you'll
[1:32:18] find one there they don't respect our
[1:32:22] style they don't respect the fashions
[1:32:24] they don't want the music we have bit
[1:32:27] they don't want to go to the parties we
[1:32:28] go to knit they don't want to go to the
[1:32:30] clubs we go to knit they don't want the
[1:32:32] careers we want they are dispersed you
[1:32:35] can find them everywhere
[1:32:42] hallelujah Heyman said it is therefore
[1:32:46] not for the king's profit so to suffer
[1:32:49] them in other words you shouldn't
[1:32:50] tolerate them anymore if they will not
[1:32:52] bow down to what we want can the church
[1:32:55] say man but bear in mind you may be
[1:32:58] seated for a minute Esther had gotten
[1:33:01] comfortable Esther had gotten
[1:33:06] comfortable in the palace in someone
[1:33:10] that she didn't even know what was going
[1:33:11] on
[1:33:17] have we gotten so comfortable that you
[1:33:21] don't know what's going on and it took
[1:33:23] him means to bring her word that they
[1:33:25] were sighing and crying for the
[1:33:28] abomination in the city and she heard
[1:33:31] true amazed that Mordechai was in
[1:33:33] sackcloth and ashes Esther was out of
[1:33:36] the spirit because she was caught up in
[1:33:39] the palace of fears and being Queen and
[1:33:43] the trappings and the responsibilities
[1:33:46] and the pristine because Monica
[1:33:48] Ayatollah don't let them know who you
[1:33:49] are so she was really an undercover
[1:33:53] agent but some day my people go
[1:33:56] undercover they forget the country they
[1:33:58] really came from during the Cold War and
[1:34:09] those times won't pass they would put
[1:34:10] these sleeper agents from different
[1:34:13] countries and it would send them from
[1:34:14] young to grow up in a country but it's
[1:34:16] always a risk we gotta teach you this is
[1:34:18] your country this is your country go
[1:34:19] down spy for us but some men despise go
[1:34:22] and they fall in love with the country
[1:34:23] didn't and they forget the spy they
[1:34:27] forget their spy she loved the food they
[1:34:32] love the clothes they haven't been home
[1:34:34] in so long they get used to waking up at
[1:34:37] a different time zone and they'd get
[1:34:39] disconnected and so he has Esther she is
[1:34:43] she safe
[1:34:44] she is queen and she is disconnected to
[1:34:49] the pain that's happening on the outside
[1:34:50] but then she gets word she gets wood she
[1:34:53] gets word that her same cousin who are
[1:34:55] given a council was in sackcloth and
[1:34:57] ashes he was sighing and crying because
[1:35:00] their people were in trouble
[1:35:02] [Music]
[1:35:08] and that's where we really scripture
[1:35:10] Mordecai commanded to tell us to think
[1:35:13] not with thyself that dull shall escape
[1:35:16] in the king's house more than all the
[1:35:19] Jews for if altogether the whole list I
[1:35:23] peace at this time then shall
[1:35:26] enlargement and deliverance arise now
[1:35:29] Mordecai seen if you want to help you
[1:35:33] can help deliverance is coming no matter
[1:35:35] what because this is God's people if you
[1:35:40] hold your peace have will come from
[1:35:44] another place the issue is that if help
[1:35:48] is coming
[1:35:48] the issue is where it's coming from you
[1:35:51] are in a position to do something about
[1:35:53] it how do you not know for such a time
[1:35:56] as this you have been placed where you

[1:41:05] name of the Lord
[1:41:06] [Applause]
[1:41:20] hallelujah you may be seated
[1:41:22] so truth scripture every ministry had a
[1:41:25] specific purpose and a specific time
[1:41:28] so every time a prophet came into his
[1:41:30] place it was was for such a time as this
[1:41:32] every time a king came into his place it
[1:41:35] was for such a time as this when all
[1:41:37] hell raised up God raised up somebody
[1:41:39] for such a time as this and in our team
[1:41:42] God has raised us up for such a time as
[1:41:45] this
[1:41:45] when cross darkness upon the earth and
[1:41:47] gross darkness upon the people the Bible
[1:41:50] said arise shine for thy light is come
[1:41:54] it's for such a time as this
[1:41:56] but the Brennan said the lid of Hell has
[1:41:58] opened up and streams of demon powers
[1:42:01] have been loosed against this world but
[1:42:04] for such a time as this God has raised
[1:42:07] up another people in the land who under
[1:42:10] their messenger will be the final voice
[1:42:13] to the final age don't let the level
[1:42:16] deceive you don't let the devil deceive
[1:42:18] you
[1:42:19] this is your time this is your season
[1:42:21] this is your hour this is your revival
[1:42:24] you are caught Omega bride heroes
[1:42:28] [Applause]

[1:42:33] praise hallelujah Oh mine and listen God
[1:42:38] in order to make sure that you don't
[1:42:41] miss it
[1:42:41] he sent a love letter for you the
[1:42:46] message is your message it's not the
[1:42:49] prophets message
[1:42:50] it's your message the prophet is the
[1:42:52] messenger his job was to bring the
[1:42:55] message to you and the church amen
[1:42:58] so every time we come to the house of
[1:43:00] God we are reading from this love letter
[1:43:05] reading from this love letter because
[1:43:07] this love letter describes his nature
[1:43:10] you may be seated
[1:43:12] young people don't know what we're
[1:43:14] talking about too much whatsapp too much
[1:43:16] messenger and all this
[1:43:17] but years ago there was something on a
[1:43:19] love letter you would write this letter
[1:43:22] and you would mail it it might take two
[1:43:23] weeks I might take a month eggomatic two
[1:43:25] months and the puss would wait with
[1:43:26] bated breath to get this letter to find
[1:43:30] out what is gonna be said and in this
[1:43:31] letter the person writing the letter
[1:43:33] would describe themselves and maybe ask
[1:43:35] questions about you so I like oranges
[1:43:38] what do you like you see I have a minute
[1:43:40] it's a long time right you may be seated
[1:43:48] so for all the ages God wrote this love

[1:44:01] and if you do have a tear wipe the tears
[1:44:04] if you get in trouble I'll come to you
[1:44:06] need you guys I'll be your present help
[1:44:09] in time of trouble now somebody could
[1:44:15] pick this up but because of the dress to
[1:44:17] them it doesn't mean much to them but
[1:44:19] when the words from the letter is read
[1:44:21] to you it means something to you
[1:44:23] [Applause]
[1:44:30] and written in that letter is when all
[1:44:33] hell is against you for such a time as

[1:44:52] message of truth it's a message of
[1:44:54] adoption it's a message of perfection
[1:44:56] it's a message of revival it's a message
[1:44:59] of victory it's a message of source how
[1:45:01] to go it's a message for all families

[1:45:15] is pulsating in your soul we are more
[1:45:17] than conquerors we are more than
[1:45:19] victorious for such a time as this don't
[1:45:24] tell me you're in trouble

[1:47:47] but the promise he didn't stagger at the
[1:47:49] promise he held on to the promise
[1:47:52] because he was the man for his time he
[1:47:55] was the man for his season in every

[1:48:51] speaking about Jesus is the principal
[1:48:53] theme of the Bible he was in the

[1:48:59] read about David we really reading about
[1:49:00] Jesus can the church say man he was in
[1:49:04] the history of the Bible the Bible is
[1:49:06] prophetic book
[1:49:07] it's a historical book it's a book of
[1:49:09] love it's a book of songs it's a book of
[1:49:12] life and in there you find Christ he was
[1:49:15] in the prophets he was in the Psalms he
[1:49:18] was in the history he also in the Bible
[1:49:20] is the things that is to come so he was
[1:49:22] before until after what does that make
[1:49:25] him then the same yesterday today and
[1:49:27] forever and the church say man so young
[1:49:31] people it will not be you
[1:49:33] it'll be Christ in you working his way
[1:49:35] out can the church say man forget about
[1:49:38] your problems
[1:49:39] forget about your child in this meeting
[1:49:42] chorus will visit you with a wonderful
[1:49:45] glorious baptism of the Holy Ghost on
[1:49:48] fire
[1:49:52] you may be seated
[1:49:54] so what are you looking for Verizon I'm
[1:49:57] looking for that same hero spirit
[1:49:59] David's ministry to come back on the
[1:50:01] scene again can the church say man Jesus
[1:50:05] came with three titles all the same
[1:50:07] person but tree titles just like father
[1:50:09] son Holy Ghost came a son of God son of
[1:50:12] man and son of David King
[1:50:15] I'm Betty Branham said when David was
[1:50:17] king he was the greatest King that ever
[1:50:19] lived and he good
[1:50:21] outside of Christ when he was here it's
[1:50:24] a Ministry of kingship gia was called
[1:50:27] the son of David Matthew 1:1 the book of
[1:50:30] the generation of Jesus Christ the Son
[1:50:32] of David the son of Abraham can the
[1:50:35] church say man and team it's ministry
[1:50:38] was to do God's will a man after my own
[1:50:42] heart who will do my will can the church
[1:50:45] say man I'm getting ready to whine now
[1:50:49] now gonna talk about divas bishop you
[1:50:53] started with David gonna end with David
[1:50:55] but if I'm setting perfect shrimp by
[1:50:58] proving weakness that's what the matter
[1:50:59] today God's got a lot of sheep that's
[1:51:01] gone astray the organization and things
[1:51:04] have strolled them out brought them out
[1:51:06] into psychology but God give us David's
[1:51:09] give us some heroes with the Word of God
[1:51:12] and the power of God to direct it when
[1:51:15] we go to meet these intellectual Giants
[1:51:17] or whatever it might be giving me the
[1:51:19] Word of God and the power of the Holy
[1:51:21] Ghost and I'll tell you it's Lee every
[1:51:24] giant and the field but a parent said
[1:51:26] David was the poorest excuse there was
[1:51:28] on the field to fight the giant he was
[1:51:31] nothing with a boy and the Bible said he
[1:51:33] was ruddy a little scrawny looking fella
[1:51:36] probably stoop-shouldered piece of
[1:51:38] sheepskin wrapped around him he didn't
[1:51:40] have none of these big intellectual
[1:51:42] degrees and well-trained he knows
[1:51:44] nothing about a sword he know nothing
[1:51:46] about the training of Saul Saul was the
[1:51:49] best he could have had bishops all but I
[1:51:51] better call him he was head and
[1:51:53] shoulders over the rest of the army he
[1:51:55] was the one or two
[1:51:56] when and thought but he was scared and
[1:51:59] today we know we need a revival we know
[1:52:02] we need a stirring amongst the people
[1:52:04] and it will not take a doctor of
[1:52:06] divinity it'll take a week it'll take
[1:52:09] the power of God in the power of the
[1:52:12] resurrection of Christ and else later
[1:52:13] sing
[1:52:14] it'll big Christ of the country and let
[1:52:16] them see you can still open the eyes of
[1:52:18] the blind heal the sick raise the dead
[1:52:21] he is God Conqueror
[1:52:23] we need a David untrained in the
[1:52:26] theological schools we need a man who
[1:52:28] knows nothing about that
[1:52:30] some little plow boy or something some
[1:52:32] little guy will reserves to shoulders
[1:52:34] not much to look at will come walking
[1:52:36] down the road with the power of God but
[1:52:38] about said you are David's you are
[1:52:41] called elected anointed positionally put
[1:52:45] in the body of Jesus Christ by the
[1:52:47] baptism of the Holy Ghost Goliath
[1:52:50] you're defeated that's the prophets
[1:52:55] words Goliath you're defeated he's
[1:52:58] defeated tonight he's defeated this
[1:53:00] morning he is defeated in this
[1:53:02] contention give the Lord a shout of
[1:53:06] praise for such a time as this
[1:53:09] [Applause]
[1:53:10] hallelujah he merely seated greeting
[1:53:15] Omar but Abraham said when David went to
[1:53:20] visit his brothers whatever I said he
[1:53:22] came to bring some reasons bring some
[1:53:24] food for them and when Tveit got to the
[1:53:27] convention they activate David why are
[1:53:31] you here who was taking care of the
[1:53:35] Sheep
[1:53:38] I'm David I could imagine sitting alone
[1:53:41] I just came to drop some food and I'm
[1:53:43] going back to take a bishop because they
[1:53:45] were partially embarrassed because for a
[1:53:47] few days they have been under pressure
[1:53:49] and they didn't want Eva to know this
[1:53:52] was their testimony so David why are you
[1:53:54] here who's thinking ship go quickly I'm
[1:53:57] taking up the ship they didn't want
[1:54:00] everything here Goliath but I can
[1:54:03] imagine David is walking away bye guys
[1:54:04] bye
[1:54:06] see you next time that's when the laia
[1:54:10] decide this is send me a man I like it
[1:54:13] imminent Aviles
[1:54:14] [Applause]
[1:54:17] [Music]
[1:54:18] [Applause]
[1:54:25] what am I missing David go take care of
[1:54:28] the sheep this is only for soldiers
[1:54:31] you're not big enough you're not strong
[1:54:33] enough you don't have the experience we
[1:54:35] went to military school I have my degree
[1:54:38] in fighting so why are you not fighting
[1:54:43] [Applause]
[1:54:46] you mean I'm more of a fighter than you
[1:54:49] go one time I was taking a sheep and a
[1:54:52] lion came
[1:54:53] I ain't got no degree in fightin but
[1:54:56] when a lion came the Spirit of the Lord
[1:54:59] came upon me and in a beer demon and the
[1:55:06] Spirit of the Lord come upon me I am
[1:55:09] confident I am persuaded nothing present
[1:55:13] nothing last nothing to come see I'm
[1:55:18] gonna go fight him he may be seated and
[1:55:23] I could imagine David's brothers
[1:55:25] reluctantly bring him this hero to King
[1:55:28] Saul Saul is so black slit and he
[1:55:31] grabbing at straws
[1:55:31] he said you ready to fight come come
[1:55:33] come come we taking anybody right now
[1:55:37] the army is open anybody can come
[1:55:40] anybody anybody can come into the army
[1:55:43] [Music]
[1:55:47] here's David he's not trusting in his
[1:55:50] ability he's not Justin and how long
[1:55:53] he's been in a message he's not trusting
[1:55:56] in his tribe he's not trusting in man
[1:55:58] he's trusting in God
[1:56:02] young people your trust must being
[1:56:05] caught and there's King Saul blessed
[1:56:10] soil he's trying to do the best he can
[1:56:11] he said listen I just had this armor
[1:56:14] come out the factory while we have not
[1:56:17] been fighting I've been building armors
[1:56:21] [Music]
[1:56:22] this is the freshest latest Hummer he
[1:56:28] said could you try on this armor and
[1:56:31] this David they were trying to walk in
[1:56:34] this armor and they were trying to move
[1:56:36] in his armor you see I don't feel
[1:56:38] comfortable I want to move faster than
[1:56:41] this I wanna I need to move my legs I
[1:56:43] need to be able to lift my hands he said
[1:56:45] I can't worship the way I want to
[1:56:48] worship in a way called heresy I can't I
[1:56:51] can't shout when I'm with the Sheep I'm
[1:56:54] normally dancing them I'm not doing no
[1:56:57] my when I'm when I'm out there having a
[1:56:59] good time I'm by myself but but I'm
[1:57:02] David so I'm always singing I'm right
[1:57:05] and I'm dancing I'm dancing in the
[1:57:06] spirit this arm up this denominational
[1:57:09] alma this arm of identification is too
[1:57:12] much for me I'll go without it and the
[1:57:17] church say man we are preaching with a
[1:57:19] hero this morning what weapons will you
[1:57:23] go with I have my sling and I have my
[1:57:25] stones you have not filled me yet Saul
[1:57:27] just gave up and here's little David
[1:57:29] walking out to meet Goliath that's what
[1:57:31] I love about God he can take the
[1:57:33] unlikely person and turn them into our
[1:57:36] hero listen David didn't even know what
[1:57:41] was gonna happen but he was walking in
[1:57:43] faith he was walking in faith he was
[1:57:46] walking in sin he did not know what was
[1:57:49] about to happen
[1:57:50] [Applause]
[1:57:53] but a testimony of Jesus's spirit of
[1:57:56] prophecy so David is standing there and
[1:57:58] Goliath comes out and the lad is not
[1:58:03] what you think he is so big he's slow he
[1:58:07] is so big you can't miss him he's so big
[1:58:10] he can't hide and here comes David I'll
[1:58:17] chop your head off
[1:58:19] guess this is the best that Israel could
[1:58:23] send you sent a boy now feed it to the
[1:58:28] birds and I could just see David put a
[1:58:31] little strong in a sling you know the
[1:58:33] story and he starts to just swing
[1:58:35] I mean stairs and I don't know what was
[1:58:38] going on but as he's swinging I could
[1:58:40] see heaven rejoicing now the tune of
[1:58:42] Israel dia hooked they are in shock
[1:58:47] because they cannot believe what's
[1:58:48] happening and as David is swinging I can
[1:58:52] see timid as feeling more confident
[1:58:54] because now when you need it to spirit
[1:58:56] raises the standard when the press come
[1:59:00] watch the third well then not before
[1:59:02] were Windham when you need it what's the
[1:59:03] power come and as David let it out that
[1:59:07] was the first guided missile that was
[1:59:09] ever shot a missile
[1:59:11] wherever David head went wherever the
[1:59:14] lion head went that stole had to cope if
[1:59:19] Goliath had done this the students were
[1:59:21] to follow him
[1:59:22] [Applause]
[1:59:29] what was it David had a revelation that
[1:59:32] was such a time as this all his years in
[1:59:35] the backside of the desert what was such
[1:59:37] a time as this
[1:59:40] now listen Goliath fell and a churn of
[1:59:45] this real still there moving on they
[1:59:48] have been so gripped with fear that it
[1:59:50] took David to go take Goliath sword and
[1:59:53] when he chopped his head only when the
[1:59:55] head started rolling the to never just
[1:59:57] say we win we win because they were
[2:00:02] under so much fear but brother the Bible
[2:00:05] said God hasn't given us a spirit of
[2:00:06] fear he is not one of the adjectives to
[2:00:10] describe sons and talking to the Living
[2:00:13] God we are born to be strong courageous
[2:00:17] fearless those are the same descriptions
[2:00:20] for heroes strong courageous fearless
[2:00:23] that's your testimony
[2:00:25] that's your promise for such a time as
[2:00:27] this I'm getting right now hallelujah so
[2:00:35] every Goliath is going to be defeated
[2:00:38] every Goliath but the banner said who is
[2:00:42] the valiant brother branham he said that
[2:00:45] cancer that humor that cataract that
[2:00:49] crippled arm the doctor said so and so
[2:00:51] you can get well but the Christ that
[2:00:54] made you stop your drinking smoking lyin
[2:00:57] stealin from drunkenness o kalasa
[2:01:01] bragging who is that uncircumcised devil
[2:01:04] who is that devil that has the
[2:01:06] relationship with corner or who is that
[2:01:08] Develin stands with nothing but the
[2:01:10] defeated thing behind him his master was
[2:01:13] defeated at Calvary by our Lord and our
[2:01:15] Conqueror and because he conquered we
[2:01:18] are more than conquerors because Christ
[2:01:21] is our hero
[2:01:22] we are also heroes for such a time as
[2:01:27] this there's been churches churches
[2:01:29] Brides right churches rides rides but
