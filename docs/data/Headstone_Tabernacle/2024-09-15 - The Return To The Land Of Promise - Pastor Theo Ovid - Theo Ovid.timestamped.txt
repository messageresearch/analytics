[1:01:03] God bless you and thanks for coming out
[1:01:07] if you have your Bibles I turn to
[1:01:08] Genesis chter 12 you want to read verse
[1:01:11] 1-5 Genesis chapter 50 going to read
[1:01:15] vers 20- 26 Joel chapter 2 verse 28 to
[1:01:20] 29 thank you musicians thank you brother
[1:01:23] Anthony thank you for the atmosphere we
[1:01:25] feel in the church this
[1:01:28] morning reading Genesis chapter 12
[1:01:31] God
[1:01:33] speaks the word we read now the Lord had
[1:01:36] said unto Abraham get thee out of thy
[1:01:38] country and from thy Kindred and from
[1:01:40] thy father's house and to a land that I
[1:01:43] will show thee and I will make of thee a
[1:01:46] great nation I Will Bless thee and make
[1:01:48] thy name Great Thou shalt be a blessing
[1:01:50] I will bless them that bless thee curse
[1:01:53] them that cursed thee and inde the shall
[1:01:56] all the families of the earth be blessed
[1:01:58] so Abraham was 75 years old when he
[1:02:01] departed out of Heron and Abraham took
[1:02:03] Sarai his wife and lot his brother's son
[1:02:06] and all their substance and they had
[1:02:09] gathered and the souls that they had
[1:02:10] gotten in Haron and they went forth to
[1:02:13] go into the land of Canaan and into the
[1:02:16] land of Canaan they came Genesis 50
[1:02:22] reading from verse 20 this is Joseph
[1:02:25] speaking to his brothers after he
[1:02:27] revealed himself to
[1:02:28] them but as for you he taught evil
[1:02:32] against me but God meant it unto good to
[1:02:37] bring to pass as it is this day to save
[1:02:40] much people
[1:02:42] alive now therefore fear ye not I will
[1:02:45] nourish you and your little ones and he
[1:02:48] comforted them and spake kindly unto
[1:02:51] them and Joseph dwelt in Egypt he and
[1:02:54] his father's house
[1:02:56] and Joseph live 110 years and Joseph saw
[1:03:00] ephraim's Children of the third
[1:03:02] generation the children also of Mair the
[1:03:04] son of manace were brought up upon
[1:03:07] Joseph knees and Joseph said unto his
[1:03:10] Brethren I die and God will surely visit
[1:03:13] you and bring you out of this land into
[1:03:17] the land which he swear to Abraham to
[1:03:21] Isaac and to Jacob and Joseph took an
[1:03:24] oat of the children of Israel saying
[1:03:25] surely God will visit you he shall carry
[1:03:28] up my bones from hence so Joseph died
[1:03:31] being 110 years old and they embalm him
[1:03:35] and he was put in a coffin in Egypt I
[1:03:39] reading from Joel 2:28 and 29 it shall
[1:03:41] come to pass afterwards that I will Port
[1:03:43] my spirit upon All Flesh your sons and
[1:03:45] your daughters shall prophesy your old
[1:03:47] men shall dream dreams your young men
[1:03:50] shall see Visions also upon them
[1:03:52] servants and upon my handmaids in those
[1:03:54] days will I pour out my spirit may God
[1:03:56] bless his word you may be seated blessed
[1:03:58] be the name of the lord it's a blessing
[1:04:01] to be
[1:04:02] here this morning
[1:04:05] amen so let's
[1:04:09] go our title this morning the return to
[1:04:14] the land of
[1:04:15] promise that's a title The
[1:04:18] Return to the land of promise I want you
[1:04:22] to notice what God gave Abraham a
[1:04:24] promise to get to King
[1:04:27] that was always the land so when Joseph
[1:04:30] and they found themselves in Egypt
[1:04:32] Joseph told them God going to bring him
[1:04:34] back to that land because that is what
[1:04:35] God promised so God will not change his
[1:04:38] mind about the original land of promise
[1:04:41] that he promises people there is no way
[1:04:44] God going to change his mind about that
[1:04:46] promise that God promised you brother
[1:04:51] Bram I've been Anointed with this spirit
[1:04:54] for the last two or three hours
[1:04:57] and I know he wants me to say
[1:04:59] this and dear
[1:05:01] Christians as long as you do that and
[1:05:04] ministers you're are going to stay in
[1:05:06] the kindergarten where you are right
[1:05:09] now you will never know no more than
[1:05:12] fuss and fight with one another that's
[1:05:15] all until you get big enough to walk out
[1:05:19] there and shake hands with your brother
[1:05:23] and have
[1:05:24] Fellowship God will bring you up and
[1:05:26] restore all Theus back to the church and
[1:05:29] take the church
[1:05:31] home so it's only Lucifer himself breaks
[1:05:34] Fellowship is only Lucifer himself Cuts
[1:05:37] people off only Lucifer himself behind
[1:05:39] that because God knows something out to
[1:05:42] break until you get big enough to get
[1:05:45] out of the traditional denominational
[1:05:47] barrier politics you talk about our
[1:05:49] nation just look at the disunity of a
[1:05:51] nation is doing it's more than a Grace
[1:05:53] to Jesus Christ the church in the
[1:05:56] disunity it is just before the coming of
[1:06:00] the Lord and the loosening of the
[1:06:02] Antichrist on the earth and here we are
[1:06:05] separated with nomal barriers I'm a
[1:06:07] Methodist praise God you couldn't shake
[1:06:09] me I'm a Baptist I'm Assembly of God I'm
[1:06:13] a Church of God I'm United Pentecostal
[1:06:15] we can fit that to any message group

[1:06:26] and it's all in the grace of God let's
[1:06:29] look to him and praise him and associate
[1:06:33] with our brother oh give the Lord a
[1:06:37] praise Hallelujah so all these are are
[1:06:41] keys to unlock the pathway that you have
[1:06:44] of life you have to cross the road you
[1:06:46] see somebody cross the what
[1:06:49] see all right but
[1:06:52] BR we read this over and over but I'm
[1:06:55] reading again tonight and I hope that it
[1:06:57] strike you a little different this
[1:06:59] morning watch this the this AE started
[1:07:02] just at the turn of the 20th century it
[1:07:05] was to be the age in which the true
[1:07:07] church would return to being the bright
[1:07:09] she was at
[1:07:10] Pentecost in other words Pentecost was
[1:07:13] the original God can't change that every
[1:07:16] church have to how do I say it line up
[1:07:19] to that then go back to that then but
[1:07:23] Bram came to turn our hearts back to
[1:07:24] that then yes that's the commission turn
[1:07:26] our hearts back to the faith of the
[1:07:27] fathers because the faith of the fathers
[1:07:29] is the original
[1:07:31] Faith they didn't live long enough to go
[1:07:33] in the Rapture but it was still the
[1:07:35] original faith that was delivered to the
[1:07:38] saints that Faith was Jesus Christ and
[1:07:41] that faith is what promised to be in you
[1:07:42] and I oh praise the name of how many
[1:07:45] understand that
[1:07:47] now so it was to be return to being the
[1:07:51] bride she was at Pentecost we know that
[1:07:52] there must have necessity be a return of
[1:07:55] Dynamic power if that was so much then
[1:07:58] how much more now it must have
[1:08:02] necessity return to Dynamic power

[1:31:19] want to get back to so I want to just
[1:31:21] slide in here now talk a little bit
[1:31:23] about this
[1:31:24] young man called Joseph now Israel loved
[1:31:27] Joseph more than all his children
[1:31:29] because he was the son of his old age
[1:31:31] and he made him a coat of many colors
[1:31:34] yes sir so Joseph listen was favored by
[1:31:38] the
[1:31:40] father it represented favor this coat of
[1:31:44] many
[1:31:45] colors and this
[1:31:48] favor caused
[1:31:52] jealousy among his
[1:31:54] brothers favor
[1:31:57] glows favor
[1:32:00] shows God's favor it is evident when
[1:32:04] God's favor is upon
[1:32:06] someone he called David a man after my
[1:32:09] own heart God is Sovereign and he has a
[1:32:12] right to
[1:32:14] favor he has a right to say Jacob I love
[1:32:17] Esau I hate and they do nothing yet
[1:32:20] because God is
[1:32:21] Sovereign Hallelujah
[1:32:23] God love
[1:32:25] shows Joseph was 17 years old when he
[1:32:29] received a quat from his
[1:32:32] father this is the Bible Genesis 37:2
[1:32:34] these are the generations of Jacob
[1:32:36] Joseph being 17 years old was feeding
[1:32:39] the fluck with his Brethren and the lad
[1:32:42] was with the sons of Bah and with the
[1:32:44] sons of zilpa his father's wife and
[1:32:46] Joseph brought themto his father their
[1:32:48] evil

[1:33:04] and Joseph went out from the presence of
[1:33:05] pharaoh and went throughout all the land

[1:33:14] years 13 years and God have a
[1:33:19] plan God knew that there going to be
[1:33:21] seven years of plenty amen and seven

[1:37:47] is what kept him it's what preserved him
[1:37:51] is what got him into prison in the first
[1:37:52] place but there God wanted him because
[1:37:56] he have two men he wanted Joseph to
[1:38:01] meet I am telling you wherever you
[1:38:05] go Oh Glory to
[1:38:09] God God will make a way for you God will
[1:38:12] still bless you I don't care how much

[1:38:31] [Applause]
[1:38:35] [Music]
[1:38:38] [Applause]
[1:38:41] morning we could learn a lot from
[1:38:44] Joseph you because Joseph is the one who
[1:38:47] demonstrated true
[1:38:48] forgiveness the Brethren that wronged
[1:38:52] him are I he people who get
[1:38:55] wronged maybe 20 years ago and they
[1:38:58] still talking about how wrong they have
[1:38:59] been
[1:39:01] wrong and it was wrong for them to wrong
[1:39:05] them and they still
[1:39:07] wrong Genesis
[1:39:10] 4547 that time Joseph cry in backround
[1:39:13] and what not right Joseph and his Breen
[1:39:14] come near to me I pray you and they came
[1:39:17] near to him and he said to him I am
[1:39:19] Joseph your brother
[1:39:24] whom you sold into
[1:39:25] Egypt now therefore be not
[1:39:29] grieved no angry with
[1:39:32] yourselves that you sold me hither for
[1:39:38] God you know people always blaming
[1:39:40] somebody they're blaming this one and
[1:39:42] they're blaming that one is she is he
[1:39:45] always somebody to blame Joseph said for
[1:39:48] God did send me before you to Pres
[1:39:53] deserve
[1:39:54] [Applause]
[1:40:04] life not only that these are two years
[1:40:08] at the family in the Land There are five
[1:40:10] more years in which there shall neither
[1:40:13] be airing nor Harvest and God sent me
[1:40:16] before you to preserve you a posterity
[1:40:18] in the earth and to save your lives by a
[1:40:21] great Deliverance
[1:40:26] this is
[1:40:28] Joseph he's seen the bigger
[1:40:31] picture do you see the bigger picture or
[1:40:34] are you still caught up with selfish you
[1:40:37] me I I myself and myself you can't pray
[1:40:40] for nobody because you still caught up
[1:40:41] in you so your prayer stunted you have
[1:40:44] no growth because it's just you and
[1:40:48] God in little
[1:40:50] cocon some people walk with a bubble
[1:40:52] around them you know
[1:40:53] then church but have a bubble around
[1:40:55] them they the Own Zone they zone
[1:41:05] out God can use
[1:41:08] suffering that can work for your
[1:41:12] good and His
[1:41:15] glory nobody wants to suffer but God
[1:41:19] sometimes chooses that works that
[1:41:24] uses that for your own
[1:41:29] good and I don't want you to just hear
[1:41:32] this as a sermon or a text I want you to
[1:41:35] see it as a reality in your own life
[1:41:38] because you go through stuff that you
[1:41:39] cannot understand you go through stuff
[1:41:42] that you don't even ask the question why
[1:41:43] am I going through this but God set it
[1:41:46] up a way there's something inside of
[1:41:48] there for you
[1:41:51] [Music]
[1:41:55] it may seem like a
[1:41:57] misfortune it may seem like a terrible
[1:41:59] tragedy oh God the brothers had more
[1:42:01] love and compassion they was in church
[1:42:04] all time shaking my hand but as soon I
[1:42:05] got a chance look at them they P me car
[1:42:08] let take
[1:42:16] away it's not worthy how Joseph kept his
[1:42:19] Christianity amidst his situation
[1:42:24] amen it's noteworthy how Joseph choose
[1:42:27] not to be Vengeance to take vengeance
[1:42:29] upon his brother but choose to overcome
[1:42:31] his bitterness and
[1:42:33] resentment expressing
[1:42:36] forgiveness there are some people have
[1:42:38] bitterness and
[1:42:39] resentment but you have to overcome that
[1:42:42] by
[1:42:43] forgiveness and seeking
[1:42:47] reconciliation Joseph had the
[1:42:49] power to really rough up his brethren
[1:42:53] yeah and that's where you see the
[1:42:55] character of a person when they have the
[1:42:57] power and they don't do
[1:43:01] it Joseph choose not to seek Vengeance
[1:43:04] but to have forgiveness and to heal
[1:43:06] those
[1:43:08] wounds and this type of pardoning and
[1:43:11] forgiveness changes two people it
[1:43:13] changes Joseph and it changes the one
[1:43:16] who he
[1:43:17] forgives this forgiveness changes
[1:43:20] you you can be changed if you're ready
[1:43:23] to let things go you can be changed it
[1:43:26] not only changes the person who know
[1:43:27] they wrong you know they Wicked and
[1:43:30] everything else they know that and you
[1:43:32] say I forgive you you strip them but it
[1:43:36] also does something to you it release
[1:43:39] you from the grip what they do to you
[1:43:41] have on you because that holds
[1:43:44] [Applause]
[1:43:50] you a terrible thing is to be rejected
[1:43:55] it's a piece of trauma that is people
[1:43:57] get hardly
[1:43:58] explained if a if a wife reject a
[1:44:00] husband or husband reject his wife or
[1:44:03] reject their parents and reject this one
[1:44:04] and reject and you know and there's a
[1:44:07] spirit comes behind that and how do you
[1:44:10] manage rejection they say people don't
[1:44:12] reject you they're not accepting you not
[1:44:14] receiving you but you have to learn that
[1:44:17] you could overcome all of
[1:44:19] that Jesus the Bible talk about he came
[1:44:21] on his own his home receive him not
[1:44:24] Jesus was rejected he was the rejected
[1:44:26] King they rejected him and he came with
[1:44:29] love he came with compassion he came
[1:44:30] with mercy and he was rejected you have
[1:44:33] to understand you are sharing also in
[1:44:34] his
[1:44:38] sufferings Joseph also demonstrated and
[1:44:41] a PR brother Isaac was he preaching it
[1:44:43] about the working with the spirit of
[1:44:46] excellence and diligence and I have here
[1:44:49] he who is faithful little is faithful in
[1:44:51] little will be faithful in much because
[1:44:54] Joseph started with the first minial
[1:44:55] task given to
[1:44:57] him and he did so well Excel so well he
[1:45:01] got a
[1:45:06] promotion no Christian should have a
[1:45:08] Boney about a
[1:45:11] job no Christian cheating on the job
[1:45:15] ratting on the job it shouldn't be like
[1:45:18] that so Joseph operated with Integrity
[1:45:22] this wrot here and Excellence with a
[1:45:24] menial task at ptis for house he do it
[1:45:27] so well that he was given a himy that he
[1:45:29] earned a prom a
[1:45:31] promotion integrity and I said Joseph
[1:45:34] Integrity led him to force in prison
[1:45:35] Integrity the quality of being honest
[1:45:39] and having strong moral principle and I
[1:45:42] want to read this from Genesis 39: 7-12
[1:45:45] how Joseph the story with Joseph here he
[1:45:47] came to pass after these things that his
[1:45:48] master's Wife cast her eyes upon Joseph
[1:45:51] she said lie with me but he refused and
[1:45:54] said unto his master's wife behold this
[1:45:56] is just Joseph now my master whated not
[1:45:59] what is with me in the house he had
[1:46:01] committed all that he had to my hand
[1:46:03] there is none greater in his house than
[1:46:05] I neither had he kept back anything from
[1:46:07] me but thee because thou his wife then
[1:46:10] how then can I do this great wickedness
[1:46:13] and sin against
[1:46:16] God so Joseph wasn't seeing the woman
[1:46:20] wasn't seeing the Temptation no he was
[1:46:22] seeing Wick wickedness and sin against
[1:46:25] God do you see it that
[1:46:29] way that you could live in wickedness
[1:46:32] and sin against God and you fear God and
[1:46:36] you will please God and you will no
[1:46:38] longer continue in wickedness and
[1:46:45] [Music]
[1:46:49] sin came the past she spake to Joseph
[1:46:52] day by day wasn't stopping the devil
[1:46:55] wouldn't stop give my pause now he no
[1:47:00] paing came to pass she speak Jose day by
[1:47:02] day and he hack nothingto her to lie by
[1:47:04] her to be with her and it came to pass
[1:47:07] about this time Joseph went to the house
[1:47:08] to do his business and there was none of
[1:47:10] the men of the house there within so the
[1:47:12] devil is working at time
[1:47:14] in that time nobody is around he Ain
[1:47:18] even recognize that he a have a clue
[1:47:20] with that and watch and she caught him
[1:47:23] by His Garment and said lie with me and
[1:47:24] he left the Garment in his hand and fled
[1:47:26] and got him
[1:47:28] out that is man who really is man who
[1:47:30] know when to
[1:47:33] run take off like a
[1:47:37] bullet so he showed where
[1:47:40] integrity and staying with God's word
[1:47:43] staying in the channel it will
[1:47:47] pay sin could never come out right
[1:47:50] wickedness could never come out right I
[1:47:52] have seen over the years people with all
[1:47:54] kind of foolishness and see how God deal
[1:47:56] with them it could never come out right
[1:47:58] you come to God stay with righteousness
[1:48:01] glory to God Amen isn't that right
[1:48:04] Hallelujah another great highlight about
[1:48:06] Joseph is his patience in God's timing
[1:48:10] could you imagine a mcka send some
[1:48:12] postcard to say what was your dream boy
[1:48:13] and he in
[1:48:16] jail hey a

[1:48:23] butler he tell the butler when you go up
[1:48:24] remember
[1:48:25] me remember you know he say yeah I
[1:48:28] remember the man walk out and forget
[1:48:30] soon as he walk he done that you know
[1:48:32] that jail bird thing that that jail
[1:48:34] thing I want to remember that I want I
[1:48:36] don't want to remember no part of that
[1:48:39] experience but God I forget and God have
[1:48:42] a
[1:48:46] timing Joseph in prison it wasn't a one
[1:48:48] day prison know it wasn't a 4 hours and
[1:48:50] he come out you no he spend some time
[1:48:53] inside of there until God give the
[1:48:56] Pharaoh a
[1:48:57] dream and then he want somebody to
[1:49:00] interpret it then the butler
[1:49:03] ah
[1:49:06] hey really had somebody in prison you

[1:52:33] said Joseph was a perfect man loved of
[1:52:35] the father hated of his brother look at
[1:52:37] Joseph the perfect one we could spend
[1:52:39] weeks on him love of the father see all
[1:52:42] this I'm talking here we getting
[1:52:43] somewhere you this Joseph was an
[1:52:47] Egyptian this is how Jacob come out of
[1:52:50] Canaan land This Is How They comeing
[1:52:52] into Egypt to get food and we remain
[1:52:55] there for over 400
[1:52:59] years do you understand that they were
[1:53:02] in the land brother
[1:53:04] George and because famine coming God s
[1:53:06] an inside man to deal with that
[1:53:16] famine he said watch the father give him
[1:53:19] a robe many colors if you watch that
[1:53:21] robe without seam
[1:53:23] which here we go represented the holy
[1:53:26] spirit that covered his being and today
[1:53:30] it's the holy spirit that covers the
[1:53:32] church the robe of Many Colors and we
[1:53:36] have seven colors of the rainbow it is
[1:53:38] seven colors all we have a rainbow a
[1:53:41] covenant that God made through Abraham
[1:53:44] through Isaac through Christ through the
[1:53:47] church by the baptism of the Holy
[1:53:51] ghostory that Covenant is made by the
[1:53:54] baptism Holy Ghost then he said the robe
[1:53:57] of seven colors that was upon Joseph
[1:54:00] that was Upon Jesus is upon the church
[1:54:05] today so we supposed to be highly
[1:54:10] favored that God can give us the robe of
[1:54:14] Many Colors let's say it again the robe
[1:54:16] of seven colors that was upon Joseph
[1:54:19] that was Upon Jesus is upon the church
[1:54:21] today Pro protected the body was covered
[1:54:23] by a robe and the church is not you it's
[1:54:27] the holy ghost that got you covered with
[1:54:30] the
[1:54:31] blood you are not the church the word in
[1:54:34] you that's the secret isn't that right
[1:54:37] okay yes sir so Joseph
[1:54:41] Jacob Jacob lived this is Genesis 47:28
[1:54:45] Jacob lived in the land of Egypt 17
[1:54:47] years so the whole age of Jacob was 100
[1:54:52] 147 years wish we had them kind of time
[1:54:54] now to live but but that KFC and all
[1:54:58] them modern comfort and what not we not
[1:55:01] we not clocking this this 147 years
[1:55:04] talking about here Jacob and his family
[1:55:06] stayed in
[1:55:08] Egypt for what 17 years isn't that right
[1:55:12] and then of course they they begin to
[1:55:15] multiply and then they raise of pharaoh
[1:55:17] Joseph of course the Pharaoh start get
[1:55:20] HS in his mind then people multiplying
[1:55:21] so fast
[1:55:24] that they afraid that they go and join
[1:55:25] up with the Enemy and fight them tell
[1:55:27] the midwives and them kill all the boys
[1:55:29] and whatnot and think they didn't do
[1:55:32] that so they become a threat and the
[1:55:35] only way to bind them was to enslave
[1:55:37] them and be taskmasters over them praise
[1:55:41] God so this Promised Land we read and
[1:55:44] Jacob dwelt in a land wherein his father
[1:55:45] was a stranger in the land of Canaan so
[1:55:49] how did Jacob get dear it was through
[1:55:51] Abraham
[1:55:52] scripture you read God promised them
[1:55:54] this land isn't that right to get out
[1:55:57] and then Isaac went there and then Jacob
[1:56:00] and so on and then they got some
[1:56:04] problems Genesis 31:3 and the Lord said
[1:56:06] to Jacob return into the land of thy
[1:56:08] fathers unto thy Kindred and I will be
[1:56:10] with thee so that is how Jacob come back
[1:56:14] to the land and Joseph is who pop up
[1:56:16] there now is that right I'll skip down
[1:56:19] here
[1:56:20] now so then in Genesis I think we read
[1:56:24] here all right I'll read it this is
[1:56:27] Genesis 15 after these things the word
[1:56:29] of the Lord came unto Abraham in a
[1:56:30] vision saying fear not Abraham I'm thy
[1:56:32] Shield thy exceeding great reward do you
[1:56:34] think God speaks again just like that he
[1:56:36] could speak to you and Abraham said Lord
[1:56:39] God what will thou give me see I go
[1:56:40] childes and the Ste of my house is this
[1:56:43] El of Damascus and Abraham said behold
[1:56:45] to me thou has given no seed and L one
[1:56:47] born in my house is my ear behold the
[1:56:49] word of the Lord came unto him saying
[1:56:50] this shall not be thine ear but he he
[1:56:52] shall come forth out of thy own Bor tra
[1:56:54] and ear he brought him forth and said
[1:56:56] look now towards the heaven tell the
[1:56:57] Stars if thou be able to number them and
[1:57:00] he said so shall thy seed be and verse
[1:57:02] six said he believe in the Lord and he
[1:57:04] counted him righteousness and then God
[1:57:07] asked him now how and then he said how
[1:57:09] shall I know I shall inherit it take me
[1:57:11] a heer who n three years old she go
[1:57:14] three years and then he took all this
[1:57:16] the birds advised not verse 11 when the
[1:57:18] fs Came Upon the carcass he drove them
[1:57:19] away and then the son was going down a
[1:57:23] deep sleep fell upon Abraham a horror of
[1:57:26] great Darkness fell upon him this is the
[1:57:29] prophecy that hanging over those
[1:57:31] children of Israel he said unto Abraham
[1:57:33] know of
[1:57:35] assurity that thy seed shall be Stranger
[1:57:40] in a land that is not
[1:57:45] dears this land we in right now is not
[1:57:49] ours this world we in right now is not
[1:57:54] ours thy sea shall be a stranger in the
[1:57:57] land is not theirs and Shall Serve them
[1:57:58] and they shall afflict them 400 years
[1:58:01] and also that Nation whom they Shall
[1:58:02] Serve will I judge amen goh shall judge
[1:58:06] them yes and afterwards shall they come
[1:58:10] out with great
[1:58:11] substance but thou shal go to thy
[1:58:14] fathers in peace and shall be buried in
[1:58:16] good old
[1:58:17] age
[1:58:19] Glory Hallelujah you love him this
[1:58:21] morning
[1:58:22] are you enjoying the word so after 400
[1:58:26] years pressure actually
[1:58:28] 430 Here Come Baby
[1:58:31] Moses because God promised after 400
[1:58:35] years Deliverance coming amen Pharaoh
[1:58:38] wise men and them suiters and as we say
[1:58:41] them OB men and them wish doctors and
[1:58:44] Wizard and
[1:58:45] whoever they see a star and they say
[1:58:48] kill all the babies two years and under
[1:58:50] and we know the story Moses was sailed
[1:58:52] down into the hands of the Pharaoh Camp
[1:58:56] to be educated and raised up by Pharaoh
[1:58:58] isn't that right but this is the promise
[1:59:01] that God made to bring them back now to
[1:59:04] the land so here they drift out 400
[1:59:07] years and I'm saying this to say that
[1:59:10] the church left Pentecost way back God
[1:59:14] sent a prophet to turn our hearts back
[1:59:15] to that am and the message stumbling and
[1:59:18] fumbling nobody want to talk about
[1:59:20] Pentecost nobody want to about the
[1:59:22] Pentecostal experience nobody talking
[1:59:24] about the fire of God they want to talk
[1:59:26] about seals trumpets vials woes woman in
[1:59:28] his son mystery Babylon and everything
[1:59:30] else all the mysteries in between but
[1:59:33] the purpose of the church he said the
[1:59:35] even time message is to loose the holy
[1:59:38] ghost seven angels come from eternity to
[1:59:41] tie up the scattered word to tie it back
[1:59:43] into the word to bring down the Holy
[1:59:46] Ghost because the Holy Ghost the word is
[1:59:48] the conduct of the spirit so the full
[1:59:50] Spirit could move because the word was
[1:59:52] broken up through Seven Ages God sent a
[1:59:55] prophet like a plumber like an
[1:59:57] electrician to connect the dcks together
[1:59:59] to pull the whole line that the bride
[2:00:01] will be connected I am the vine you are
[2:00:04] the branches to pull the whole line that
[2:00:07] the spirit can flow freely there is my
[2:00:10] spirit flowing
[2:00:11] freely Oh Glory to God are we going to
[2:00:15] see an another Mighty book of Acts yes
[2:00:18] because he said if that tree put forth
[2:00:20] another original branch it will bring
[2:00:22] forth un original Fruit Oh Glory to God
[2:00:25] we have seen enough grafted in grafted
[2:00:26] in who playing Prophet mini Prophet who
[2:00:28] playing that they Min son man and and if
[2:00:30] if wasn't but BR God choose them all
[2:00:32] kind of foolishness we had enough of
[2:00:34] that but God promised that there will be
[2:00:36] another original branch and that
[2:00:39] original Branch will bring back original
[2:00:41] Fruit oh God I'll ride this Trail once
[2:00:43] more there'll be one more ride Oh Glory
[2:00:46] to God the White Horse Ride of the Holy
[2:00:48] Ghost there'll be one more ride hallel
[2:00:51] ljah Hallelujah glory to God thank you
[2:00:55] Lord thank you
[2:01:00] Lord
[2:01:02] Brother I wonder tonight if I'm speaking
[2:01:04] to people who wants me to start to go
[2:01:06] through with
[2:01:07] God and when the testing time come you
[2:01:11] choose rather to go back into the world
[2:01:13] and do the things of the world or did
[2:01:14] you take the rugged way of Salvation did
[2:01:17] you do like Moses when he was under
[2:01:19] testing when he had his foot on the
[2:01:21] throne of Egypt eypt but he esteemed The
[2:01:23] Riches of Christ greater Treasures than
[2:01:27] all the riches of Egypt he forsook Egypt
[2:01:30] did not care how much gold how many
[2:01:32] popular he took God at his word he
[2:01:35] forsook the things of Egypt counting the
[2:01:37] reproach of Christ greater riches what
[2:01:39] do we do Under the testing when the hard
[2:01:43] Trials
[2:01:44] Come not trials you know and you're
[2:01:47] boarding like a cow with
[2:01:50] tri you will Fe out right Bo when you
[2:01:53] heart Trials come we have to be stronger
[2:01:56] than that
[2:01:57] you what do we do Under the testing when
[2:02:02] the hard Trials come when they say
[2:02:04] because that you separate yourself from
[2:02:06] the things of the world you are
[2:02:07] religious fanatic does the strain come
[2:02:10] it's got to come and you got to make the
[2:02:12] choice so you're a Christian not because
[2:02:15] you say amen and Glory Hallelujah here
[2:02:17] you're Christian when the test
[2:02:19] come when the orange is squeezed
[2:02:22] when you are squeezed or you are pressed
[2:02:25] that is when it it it comes up to
[2:02:27] you God has one way of bringing light to
[2:02:30] you one that's when you are ready to
[2:02:32] separate yourself from all the things of
[2:02:34] the world all the cares of the world and
[2:02:37] cling only to God's promised
[2:02:39] word Paul was a Nazarite Aon was a
[2:02:42] Nazarite it's a total separation we are
[2:02:44] not to go back into the world no more or
[2:02:46] have anything to do with the world but
[2:02:48] to cleave only to God Jesus is coming
[2:02:51] for a bride a woman of church that is
[2:02:53] separated from the things of the world
[2:02:54] now you hearing this and if the world
[2:02:56] say t to you you know that you're bright
[2:02:59] one to be this bride is separated from
[2:03:01] things of the world the cares of the
[2:03:04] life isn't that right she's separated
[2:03:05] from the cares and traditions of
[2:03:06] churches she's separated only to God and
[2:03:08] God is the word and as husband and wife
[2:03:10] is one so does the bride and the word
[2:03:12] becomes one for the word is living
[2:03:15] through the bride that's her credentials
[2:03:18] that's the
[2:03:20] identification oh pra God so Moses
[2:03:23] commission give him in Exodus 378 the
[2:03:26] Lord said I've surely seen the
[2:03:28] Affliction of my people which are in
[2:03:29] Egypt and I've heard their Cry by reason
[2:03:32] of the task Masters F know their sorrows
[2:03:35] it's amazing how God already prophesied
[2:03:38] to Abraham that his people has than 400
[2:03:41] years and if somebody had read that
[2:03:43] prophecy during the time but Andrew and

[2:04:01] God will surely do it watch this God say
[2:04:05] he deliver them God say he send a
[2:04:07] deliverer but the people had to
[2:04:12] cry God's confession was that I
[2:04:16] heard the cries of my people and he said
[2:04:20] I know their sorrows
[2:04:22] verse 8 and I am come down to deliver
[2:04:24] them out of the hand of the Egyptians

[2:23:20] they went forth Healing The Sick casting

[2:23:47] back and Obey what God said we have got
[2:23:49] to go back where we left off at we have
[2:23:51] got to go back to Pentecost we have got

[2:24:06] [Applause]
[2:24:07] [Music]
[2:24:10] [Applause]
[2:24:13] hallelujah there's a quote where he said
[2:24:15] all the mysteries of god father may be
[2:24:16] revealed that we can know how to behave
[2:24:19] ourselves not argue not to go on a
[2:24:21] podcast and say well I I know all the
[2:24:24] Mysteries I have head of the
[2:24:30] hour but
[2:24:35] Brown talk about John the Apostle of
[2:24:38] Love would certainly see when the church
[2:24:40] begin to lose his first love of God they
[2:24:42] love the pastor but they don't love God
[2:24:46] they love the church but they don't love
[2:24:48] God because God is the word
[2:24:51] there people who love to go to church
[2:24:52] you know they in love with the music and
[2:24:55] the clap and the thing they in love love
[2:24:57] with the atmosphere but when it come to
[2:24:59] obey God they have nothing to do with
[2:25:03] that when they look in the mirror they
[2:25:05] forget what they look
[2:25:07] at 1 John 53 say for this is the love of
[2:25:10] God that we keep his Commandments his
[2:25:13] word this is what the love of God one
[2:25:19] little deviation from the word was a
[2:25:21] step away from Christ people say they
[2:25:23] love God they go to church they even
[2:25:26] shout Rejoice sing have a great
[2:25:27] emotional time when it is all over watch
[2:25:31] and see if they are in that word walking
[2:25:35] in it living in it if they go through
[2:25:38] all the other and then don't walk in the
[2:25:40] word they can say they love God but
[2:25:42] their lives tell a different
[2:25:44] story
[2:25:46] hallelujah hallelujah praise God get
[2:25:49] back to
[2:25:50] God repent before it's too late see the
[2:25:54] handwriting on the wall it is writing
[2:25:58] judgment as the sacred vessels were
[2:26:00] desecrated and dust brought the wrath of
[2:26:03] God now the sacred word has been
[2:26:06] desecrated and the spirit is grieved and
[2:26:09] the judgment is here even at the door
[2:26:12] repent repent go back to Pentecost back
[2:26:16] to the Legion of the Holy Ghost back to
[2:26:18] the word of God for why will you
[2:26:23] die final quote two quotes brother Bram
[2:26:28] from True sign Overlook he said raise up
[2:26:30] this one that you're speaking of in the
[2:26:32] scriptures to about Elijah of Malachi 4
[2:26:36] anoint him Lord I call for him send him
[2:26:39] Lord our hungry hearts are crying send
[2:26:41] him Lord that will return the people
[2:26:44] back to the F of the fathers again
[2:26:45] listen that will get them away from this
[2:26:48] denominational puppets
[2:26:51] into a real experience with God like
[2:26:54] they did on
[2:26:55] Pentecost a real Church burning with the
[2:26:58] same message the same Faith the same
[2:27:01] Doctrine the same Bible the same God
[2:27:05] with the same signs raise us up our
[2:27:07] Propet Lord and the final quote I begin
[2:27:11] to play something and we are going to
[2:27:12] the end time right now by saying this
[2:27:15] the end time message is to get the bride
[2:27:19] ready and prepared for the
[2:27:22] Rapture what can it do according to
[2:27:24] Malachi 4 is to bring them back to the
[2:27:27] fith that was once delivered to the
[2:27:29] Saints bring them back to the fate of
[2:27:31] the fathers the Pentecostal part in the
[2:27:34] restoration time oh glory to God did you
[2:27:37] get that bring them back to the page of
[2:27:39] the fathers the Pentecostal part in the
[2:27:43] restoration time so he is saying and in
[2:27:46] this message there's a Pentecostal path
[2:27:49] in the time of restoration
[2:27:50] we have to go back to the promised land
[2:27:53] returning to the land of
[2:27:55] promise I will restore sayth the Lord

[3:01:13] Believers can a church say amen amen so
[3:01:16] I know there's a lot to un pack there
[3:01:18] but I think you get a general idea and
[3:01:20] certainly we'll keep in communication
[3:01:22] during this week and by next Sunday we
[3:01:24] should have a clear plan but for those
[3:01:26] who are very spiritually competitive I
[3:01:29] would encourage you to start to get
[3:01:31] yourself sorted out
[3:01:36] so final announcement there next Sunday
[3:01:40] after the service as well next Sunday
[3:01:42] we'd like to speak to all the parents of
[3:01:44] the Sunday School students so if your
[3:01:46] child is in Sunday school we want to
[3:01:49] have a brief conversation with all of
[3:01:52] the parents of the Sunday school class

[3:02:33] team Sister Abigail Nicholas brother
[3:02:35] Steven Kangley Brother Andy Henry and
[3:02:37] sister Ronda Williams we encourage you
[3:02:39] to align with the team and don't be
[3:02:41] surprised if one of these captains reach
[3:02:42] out to align themselves with you and may
[3:02:45] the Lord richly bless you have a
[3:02:47] wonderful full week in the presence of
[3:02:49] the Lord be conscious of his presence
[3:02:52] there's something brother said during
[3:02:53] his service about that drone that hope
[3:02:56] is over you and I hope it's a natural
[3:02:59] type to a spiritual truth because the
[3:03:01] reality is the Holy Ghost is watching
[3:03:03] you every move there's an eye watching
[3:03:05] you so be very sensitive that in your
[3:03:08] daily walk your daily talk your daily
[3:03:10] Administration that you are you know
[3:03:13] cognizant of the fact that the Holy
[3:03:15] Ghost is watching you as a tutor and
[3:03:18] based on your behavior he could say that
[3:03:20] there's one over there and there's one
[3:03:21] over there and this trial didn't derail
[3:03:24] you and this situation didn't have you
[3:03:26] do any wrong thing but your behavior and
[3:03:27] your conduct was worthy of a son even
[3:03:30] though you had a trial even though you
[3:03:31] had a situation so may the Lord Rich you
[3:03:33] bless
[3:03:36] you Lord glory to God you appreciate
[3:03:39] that today amen amen praise God
[3:03:42] hallelujah as Yos has come to dismiss
