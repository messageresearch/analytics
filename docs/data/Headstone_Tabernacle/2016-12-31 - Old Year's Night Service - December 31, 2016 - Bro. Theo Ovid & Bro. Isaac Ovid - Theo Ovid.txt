2016 is about to die and we see the birth of 2 17 but I want to bring greetings to you from South Africa brother Raymond Thompson and the Believers and the church there uh we had some was a was a Monumental meeting tremendous meeting in South Africa and we were so glad to be here and uh had the opportunity to minister the word the assistant pastor and I and we are grateful to God so tonight we don't want to hold you waste any time we want to go straight in the word could we stand for the reading of the word oh praise the name of the Lord looking forward for great things tonight amen tonight's service will be in two parts it will be shared with the assistant pastor so I'll take part and he will take part we going to that's will be the service tonight amen so we want to go to Numbers Chapter 13 and Galatians chapter 4 for two portion of scriptures tonight numbers 13 reading from verse 25 to 30 and Galatians 4: 1: 7 numbers 13 and they returned from searching of the land after 40 days and they went and came to Moses and to Aaron and to all the congregation of the children of Israel unto the Wilderness of paron to Kadesh and brought back W unto them and unto all the congregation and show them the fruit of the land and they told him and said we came unto the land with thou sentest us and surely it flow it with milk and honey and this is the fruit of it nevertheless the people be strong that dwell in the land and the cities are wed and very great and moreover we saw the children of anoch there the amalekites dwelt in the land of the South the Hittites and the jebusites the amorites dwell in the mountains the Canaanites dwell by the Sea and by the coast of Jordan and Caleb stilled the people before Moses and said let us go up at once and possess it for we are well able to overcome it Galatians chapter 4 now I say that the heir as long he's a child differ nothing from a servant though he be Lord of all that is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father even so we when we were children were in bondage under the elements of the world but when the fullness of the time was come God sent forth his son made of a woman made under the law to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons and because ye are Sons God has sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts crying Abba Father wherefore Thou Art no more a servant but a son and if a son then an heir of God through Christ let's bow our heads father we thank you for your word tonight and we invite you to come and breathe life into that word father we are facing a critical hour a critical time but you promis this word to open up in such Clarity that we could know who we are where we come from and where we going and whose we are Grant father that you would come among people and bless them and pour out your spirit upon their hearts and lives in Jesus name we ask it amen and amen you may be seated praise God blessed be the name of the Lord do I hear a shout in the house hallelujah praise God you are alive glory amen hallelujah oh praise the Lord you are alive alive unto God Amen praise the Lord blessed be the name of the Lord you love him this night amen have a title matured ripened seed Sons to be made manifest that's my title matured ripen seed Sons to be made manifest I a subject if a son then an air of God through Christ amen that's my subject and have an Inspiration Go possess overcome it Hallelujah all these are instructional words go possess overcome it blessed be the name of the Lord praise God now the Amplified of Galatians 4 says now I I mean as long as the inheritor is a child and underage he does not differ from a slave although he's the master of all the estate but he's under Guardians and administrators or trustees until the date fixed by the father so we when we were miners were kept like slaves under the rules of the Hebrew rituals and subject to the element teachings of a system of external observation and regulation but when the proper time had come God sent his son born of a woman born subject to the regulation of the law here we go to purchase the freedom of or to Ransom or to redeem or to atone for those who were subject to the law that we might be adopted and have here we go sunship conferred upon us and be recognized as God's sons and because you really are his sons God sent the Holy Spirit of his son into our hearts crying out father therefore you are no longer a slave which is a b servant but a son and if a son it follows that you are an air by the aid of God through Christ oh blessed be the name of the Lord wonderful oh praise God Amen praise God do you love him amen so you are no longer a slave a born servant but a son and Jesus came to call out Sons he came to identify Sons oh blessed be the name of the Lord so I have a little team hungering after righteousness and the passion to become a manifested son this is taken it now Beyond church membership this is taken about you going to church and you're coming you love Jesus and believe the calvary This Not That now this is taking it beyond that this is you having a desire in your heart some for the first time to become a manifested son you don't just want to be a Son of God you want want to be a manifested son you want to understand that you are heir of God if you are son then you have an inheritance am then you have a portion oh that's why you could go up at once and possess it because it belongs to you it wasn't revealed to you yet but it belongs to you whether you know it or you don't know it still belongs to you because whatever the father have is yours this it belongs to you and the Bible said g say we are well able well able tell somebody next to you we are well able tell them that we are well able tonight to possess it to P what it every Redemptive blessing that Jesus died for you are well able to possess it so you're going to rise up tonight you're going to go out for 2017 you're going to possess it and you're going to overcome it Whatever It Is have to overcome you will overcome it you were raised up for overcome it you were born to overcome it that's what the devil don't want you to know but you were raised up to be Sons and Daughters of God you're not an animal you're not a beast of the field Hallelujah you were called to be in His image and likeness Oh Glory to God you believe that Hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah glory to God Luke 9:23 Jesus said If any man will come after me let him deny himself take up his cross daily and follow me oh Hallelujah the Amplified and he said to all if any person will come after me let him deny himself disown himself forget lose sight of himself and his own interests refuse and give up himself take up his course daily and follow me which is to cleave steadfastly to me and conform to my example in living and if need be thine also Ephesians 6 finally my brethren be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might there is no scripture say be weak in the Lord be struggling in the Lord there's no scripture that said that it said be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might put on the whole armor of God that we may be able to stand against the wise of the devil and somebody was sharing with Paul was seeing all the Roman shoulders in their armor seeing them and he take it and bring it a description for the Christian to put on the whole armor for We R not against flesh and blood but against principalities and against Powers against rulers of Darkness against spiritual wickedness take where will take over the whole armor of God that you may withand in the evil day oh glory to God and heard a statement that Trill my soul you cannot defeat a full-time Devil with a part-time Christian Life Oh Glory to God you cannot defeat a full-time Devil with a part-time Christian Life we are fighting daily on our road back to Eden you hear what I'm saying this is not our home we only passing through if you think this is your home you are wrong you will die here praise God but we only passing through oh Hallelujah we are going back to Eden so we are fighting daily not weekly not monthly not every time you get a paycheck daily you are fighting daily to go back to heeden oh I want you to shout [Applause] [Music] daily Hallelujah daily take up your cross daily the struggle has to be daily so brother B said no wonder Jesus consider the lies of the field how they toil neither do they spin but yet I see Solomon in all his glory was not a raid like that and the Lily was revealing Christ and how lily Pastor Lily he said Lily he gets down into the valley the dark place and he push himself up through the darkness of the earth to do what to glorify himself to glorify everything that comes in contact with him he has to toil day and night to keep his Radiance of beauty to keep the perfume flowing he has pulled day and night from the Earth to give out here we go that's what a real Christian does we not talking about church member now we talking about real Christians you pray one humble yourself and keep before God day and night in all order in order that you might give yourself to somebody else it is not what you keep it is what you give that counts you must give yourself out to others and that's the way Jesus did he gave himself unto others and that's why perfect eternal life is when you can live for somebody else when you're not looking for I me and myself and what you could get but what you could give oh praise God hallelujah so Daniel praise God he seen the angel come now and put one foot on the land and one foot upon the sea and then he said at that time the mystery of God should be finished and the world is groaning waiting today the people don't know the mystery of God why they have not been taught the mystery of God the only thing theyve taught join church and put your name on the book be a good fellow treat your neighbor right that's all right but you must know the mystery of God you must know the mystery of God and here the BM no man can reveal it to you but the one that had the book and the Bible said no man can call Jesus only by the Holy Ghost the grand old Holy Ghost Church is going to come out one of these days and shine like you've never seen before and Daniel heard the seven tunders they utter the voices Daniel grabb his pen and started to write and the angel said don't write oh Hallelujah no man could only open the seeds but them was them voices Oh Hallelujah and in the last days here we go these seven voices he said them seven tunders it's seven voices these seven voices would be made known by the real true church you can see can you get it can you see where the false and counterfeit is trying to keep great men from places like that oh oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah so for you to go into the mystery of God hallelujah great man great woman to go into the mystery of God isn't that right and this is the prayer from the contest make us fit servants forgive our past Miss make us fit servants you see you cannot serve God according to the god you make in your own mind you have to come back to realize God is the word a lot of people have God as the imagination of Their Own Heart they create their own Gods that's not the real God God is what he said in his word here he didn't spare Noah he didn't spare Moses he didn't spare Samson he didn't spare none of his sons and neither will he spare you oh praise God could I get a big amen oh every son that cometh to God must be tested must be tried not some Sons every son Hallelujah praise God he said make us fit servants I like that fit servants forgive our past bless our future guide us oh Lord with thy Mighty hand bless these ministers here bless all the ly praise God all the visitors blessing blessing be thou with us Lord we are your servants we give ourselves holy to you we say for for 2017 that the power of your spirit might have more preeminence in our life and in our being God forgive us and help us raise up mighty man oh Hallelujah that just trills my soul that's a prayer raise up mighty men raise up Mighty Warriors of the faith not not quitters not people that given up not this happen on your fed up and you can't take it no more and you want to let go and you want to backslide and you don't want to be a Christian no more and no no no no Warriors of the faith Oh Glory to God a warrior does fight regardless when the other men are D they're still fighting they will fight to the death they don't thr down the sword they don't rip off the armor they keep on fighting oh give the Lord a praise we need some more Warriors hallelujah hallelujah when Peter thought quitting was part of The Game Jesus told him the devil want to sift you like wheat because inside of you have a purpose inside of you have something ordained to come forth but I pray for you that your faith don't fail I pray for you Hallelujah I know the devil want to wreck you he want to wreck your home he want to wreck your relationship he want to wreck your marriage yes yes he want to wreck everything around you but he prayed that your faith fail not want to wreck your mind want you to give up but he prayed that your faith fail not hallelujah hallelujah open this year Lord that hidden manner that rock beneath the rock that we might see the program of God cap off the permit of Our Lives put on the Capstone Christ Jesus upon each and every one of us may his great magnificent holy blessing be upon us all and may the fire of the Holy Ghost come upon us and may the power of the Resurrection be manifested God in this last day is going to draw true hearts from everywhere no matter how much counter feet of chaff the devil has God will rise his church right out of it it will be as ceiling as sure as I'm standing on the platform Oh Glory to God know the angel says stop the Four Winds until them Jews be sealed and before the Jews be sealed a bride got to be sealed the devil know you the devil have to know you are sealed away the devil have to know that God has sealed you and he could watch and can't touch Oh Glory to God you are going to be marked by God you are going to be marked by God God said put a mark on them that s and cry oh hallelujah hallelujah oh glory to God hallelujah so the church that has been born in the mother of fanaticism and chaos but she's W way through the grime until until she's on top of the thing just waiting for her wings for the flight many shall run to and fro but the people that know their God shall do get exploit in that day watch set still Little Flock positionally stay where you are God is waiting and trying and pressing to get the mystery of God revealed to his church that is what's holding back the coming of Christ and the great Millennium is this great Supernatural power that lays dormant in the church I'm not talking about letter I'm not talking about speaking the word I'm talking about a supernatural power because it will take power to leave here I'm not talking about mental power or intellectual power what's coming is more demonic that you ever think the plagues are coming on oh hallelujah praise God Oh Glory Hallelujah Hallelujah so a son is born by the Holy Spirit isn't that right and they are children they are God's children isn't that right praise God now the placing of a son the first thing after the son was he become a son but then we find out here we go his behavior is what set him to adoption am Behavior yes Behavior Hallelujah whether he behave right or not Pentecost is not a denomination it is an experience and no church could lock and tongue an experience that experience come from God so no church can say they have it this one have it that's foolishness when God want to call Moses he didn't come to our church he Pillar of Fire come down and burn in the bush and call Moses out when God ready to call Abraham he came down and say Abraham come out when God ready for you going to call you right out God going to speak to your heart no Pastor no Elder no Deacon could come between you and your God because God have no grandchildren God have no cousins as aunt and tanty God only have sons and daughters glory to God he knows your name oh could we give the Lord a shout in the house he knows your [Music] [Applause] name glory to God all these preachers trying to play Pope and Bishop and Arch Bishop and just going higher and higher higher and the people down here God don't have that God only have sons and daughters God have offices for purpose prophets for our purpose evangelist for our purpose but that purpose is when accomplished it's finished there's going to be a faithful Ministry for the Perfection of the Saints so no one man could perfect no church there's got to be other Ministries that that people can hear those Ministries Hallelujah to build you up to edify you praise God to bring you into the unity of the faith into the N of God if you know everything you're supposed to know that you would you shouldn't be here tonight you are here because we don't know we need to hear from him we need the Holy Spirit to reveal the word to us that's why we are here have no big shot and small shot and side shot they have none of that only have sons and daughters of God hallelujah Oh Glory we at the end time and God is adopting and setting position Al in the church now there's not going to be too many he put in there I'm going to tell that to begin with oh Hallelujah so brother brandham said this here God Waits isn't it strange God wants his people to have a part to play with it amen he said when Jesus look upon the Harvest he said the Harvest is ripe the laborers are few you pray the Lord of the Harvest which is him you pray to me that I will send laborers into my Harvest it is some part you have to do God is waiting for his church to call on him amen he always did it God is waiting today for the people to call his servant into action and the servant can't get into action until the people pray amen oh hallelujah oh glory to God and he said I am the vine and you are the branch watch we are the branches and he is the vine and the vine can't bear the fruit it's the branches that bear the fruit he furnishes the energy but got to do the job I have come down but Moses you go do you see it now he flourishes the energy I have heard the cries of my people and I come down but you going to [Music] go Hallelujah if it take more 4 years to get to Pharaoh he still have to go and he have to bring the word to Pharaoh let my people go so he come down but you going to go oh Hallelujah he going to anoint the people he want your eyes he want your ears come on now want your feet he want to get a desire inside you tonight a new desire to be a manifested son to be a manifested daughter of God you want the devil to know where you come from you want the devil to see your badge your ID card your uniform oh hallelujah praise God you want to be a Demon Hunter you want to be a demon Chaser you want to be a man that cast out Devils man that heals the sick man that rais the dead you want to do the same works that Jesus did yes yes yes yes yes you want to be an Express attribute of God oh hallelujah hallelujah huah warming Church bench is over oh Hallelujah coming to church and going back home that's over you want to be an expression of God he furnishes the energy you may be seated but we got to do the job the holy spirit is here tonight he's here each night he knows you but the only way he speaks is through us our hands are his hands our eyes are his eyes oh Hallelujah you pray the lord of the Harvest that he would send labors into the Harvest because the Harvest is ripe and the laborers are few in other words you ask me to do what I know ought to be done he could not do it until they ask him to do it that's why you're supposed to come under expectation you should come with a bubble in your heart I don't care what your husband say what your wife say what your children say I don't care if you get four flat tires on your way here but when you come here with a expectation in your heart it is something God could work if I could just just touch the H of His Garment you touch it yet but if you have a thought in your heart oh I have a blood issue I have I have issues have more than one issues but I come tonight I know if Jesus passed by I want to grab him I want to take a hold upon him that's why when Jacob Holy Angel he said I'm not going to let you go till you bless me when I get a hold upon something I want it I want a reality oh could we give a shout in the house hallah oh hallelujah hallelujah Hallelujah so did you realize that after the testing time come that tutorship of that son that was born into the family if he stood the test and remains with the father's desire then that boy was taken out and was put on a garment and a ceremony and that boy was placed into the family that he was born in and that's the matter with the Pentecostal today they jump here they pull away here now if you stay with the word then God seeing if he abide in me my word abide with you he canot deny it God is waiting for his children but they won't line up and when they come to that testing time will you accept it while the will put me out all right there you are that's not Abraham's seed Abraham doesn't act that way so first the seed must get mature fullness of growth no more growing it's a full seed now then the seed have to get ripened Hallelujah your faith have to get ripen being tested by the ministry of the word am you have to come through the word now because when the Holy Spirit Came Upon Jesus he was led by the spirit Into the Wilderness to be tested Hallelujah by the word if thou be it's written it's written it's written it was a word test you got to get a word [Music] test you don't need that power yet you need a word test that test to ripen your faith that you know God is good even though he doesn't show up he is still God you don't feel him he is still God if you don't heal you he is still God he's the same yesterday today and forever oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory to God glory to God hallelujah praise godall thank you Lord Jesus he says his bride has made us already we got the potentials the holy spirit is here the power to heal the sick the power to do all these things is here but God is waiting to get away from us to get away from Traditions oh my and come with sincerity and come with sincerity and sorrowfulness of sin oh praise God and what God looking for is to anoint somebody and send down and make that word act exactly and where the word prophesied for this day God is waiting to find somebody in other words when Isaiah prophesied a virgin shall conceive that word was just floating until Mary come that word was looking for Mary Mary had the anointing to connect with that prophecy or any time God speak there got to be a listen before before he speak it there got to be a people to receive it God God is speaking nothing and the word come back void I can't find them all he found you he called all who we call he justified God go God didn't waste time finding you you might be B up Twisted all kind of tied up but God found you and there's a purpose behind him finding you that's what we here for tonight oh

be tonight can we bow our heads for a word of prayer our gracious Heavenly Father we thank you for your grace for your love and your mercy towards us tonight Lord that we could be gathered here as a people as a Church Father Lord father Lord at such a time as this as we see the closing minutes Lord of 2016 and as we usher in 2017 father father we want to be Lord fit vessels vessels of Honor father that you could use in such a time as this and for the next few minutes Lord just to introduce a thought father and an inspiration for this year Lord may your Holy Ghost drop down and minister to your people father if there's anyone who doesn't know you may they come to Know You Lord and may this be that kind of a day they would never forget if there's a backslide in our midst who may have walked in here tonight Lord maybe something pull maybe they just want to start the year right there's something on the inside crying for more may they not leave empty tonight we welcome the visitors in our gates we welcome those connected on the internet and most importantly we welcome the angel of the lord we welcome Lord Holy Ghost itself in our midst tonight have his preeminence in the midst of the church and in our lives father may you bless us may you Lord forgive our past and may you bless our future may the Holy Ghost Lord take me out of the way and speak to your people in the precious name of Jesus Christ and the church says you appreciate a pastor tonight amen amen so just for a short thought just a few minutes to midnight so I'm not going to be too long with you but I do have a short thought for the season and to usher in 2017 so if you have your Bibles we turn with me thank you musicians I certainly appreciate all of the specials and it's certainly a great privilege to be back home so I want to read from Hosea chapter 6 Hosea is the book just before the Book of Joel Hosea chapter 6 and also from Philippians chapter three for context tonight certainly want to welcome all of the visitors we want you to feel very welcome and very comfortable in his presence and the thing about God he makes you feel comfortable and he also makes you feel a little uncomfortable because when you begin to look at your life you have to ask yourself the question do I measure up to the word so we want to be comfortable and a little uncomfortable welcome and feel a little welcome amen So reading from Hosea uh chapter 6 and from verse one come and let us return unto the Lord for he hath torn and he will he us he hath smitten and he will bind us up after 2 days will he revive us in the third day he will raise us up and we shall live in his sight then shall we know if we follow unto know the Lord his going forth is prepared as the morning and he shall come unto us as the rain as the latter and former rine into the earth oh Ephraim what shall I do unto thee oh Judah what shall I do unto thee for your goodness is as a morning cloud and as the early due it goeth away therefore have I hewed them by the prophets I have slain them by the words of my mouth and thy judgment are as the light that goeth forth for I desired mercy and not sacrifice and the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings but they like men have transgressed the Covenant they have they dealt treacherously against me Gilead is a city of them that work iniquity and is polluted with blood and as troops of robbers wait for a man so the company of priests murther in the way by consent for they commit lewdness I have seen an horrible thing in the house of Israel there is the whoredom of Ephraim Israel is defiled also oh Judah he had set an Harvest for thee when I returned the Captivity of my people and reading Philippians 3 and reading from verse 13 Philippians 3 or last scripture reading and reading from verse 13 Brethren I count not myself to have apprehended but this one thing I do forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth unto those things which are before I press toward the Mark for the prize of the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus may the Lord add a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated amen can we give the Lord a hand of Praise we just a few minutes before 2017 so just for a very short thought tonight it's return unto the Lord and for a subject recognizing your day and your message amen and for an inspiration forgetting the things that are passed because the only way you can forget the past is because there's something else to hold on to so we read the scripture where Paul is saying to the Philippians Brethren I count not myself to have apprehended in other words he's saying I don't count myself to really understand everything that's going on but this one thing I do forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth unto those things which are before I press towards the mark for the prize of the high calling in Christ Jesus and I believe if there's anything you understand tonight is you have a right you have a an opportunity tonight to forget the past to forget this year to forget what happened to forget what went wrong to forget what hurt you to forget what bothered you to forget why you were not in service to forget why you backslid to forget why you argued and put it all behind and press towards something greater something more important not your ambition not what you want but a prize of the high calling because it's a high calling that we are responding to tonight to be in the house of God can the church say Amen oh I believe it's almost midnight so I could already begin to tell you Happy New Year happy new season welcome to 2017 this is time this is our time this is revival time this is restoration time this is Deliverance time it's Holy Ghost time it's outpouring time and it's time to come back home it's time to return not to church but to return unto God to return to the Lord uh not return to man not return to the pastor but return unto the Lord can the church say Amen oh you may be seated I'm not going to be along with you tonight but you know what I'm convinced of there are some parties that haven't started yet there's the midnight party there's the 1:00 a.m. party there's the 2: a.m. party somebody to me there a concert starting at 3:00 a.m. and I got tired thinking about it and I tell myself if we are breaking into a new season that Moses knew about and Abraham taught about and brother Brandon wish he was here and we are here breaking into a new season new dimension all these years we are in the message listen you may be seated I said to them in South Africa and for you visitors who are here tonight I am tired of church I've said it for years I'm one of the few preachers who says they are tired of church because I'm looking for a reality I'm not looking for church I'm looking to see that same Jesus I'm looking to see the pillar of fire I'm looking to see silver and gold I don't have I'm I'm looking to see you may be seated people restored and stay let me say that again people get delivered and stay not delivered this week and next week I can't find you it means you will not really delivered because God does a total Deliverance I don't want a 80% Deliverance I don't want a 95% Deliverance I want all 16 elements to be transformed by fire to be transformed by the Holy Ghost I'm looking for that same power that Peter felt that the prophet felt can the church say [Music] Amen you may be seated you have to forgive me but with every breath that I take and for as long as God has me on this Earth whether he says Isaac your time is to be finished here or go to the Rapture I'm going to give God all that I have I might make mistakes I might fall but the devil knows who s I'm on he ain't make no mistake about that because it doesn't it's not how much time you fall is if you can get back up so 2016 is over you have a blank slate today today is a new day it's a new year it's a new month it's a new declaration and the devil is mad because he has no idea what's about to happen because he doesn't hold a future but God he holds a future he is Alpha and Omega he knows the beginning from the end he saw you here tonight and her word went out return unto the Lord can the church say Amen so just for a few minutes can I get a few minutes tonight is there anybody ready for another round you ready to go another level higher you ready to give the devil a knockout punch is there anybody tired of being tired tired of being sick sick tired of being up and down is there anybody in the house can I get a shout in the house Hallelujah we came to serve the Lord Jesus that's what we came to do not to have church but we came to Lift Jesus Higher somebody say Jesus Jesus I can't hear you somebody say Jesus Jesus that's only 80% somebody say Jesus he's a center of my joy he's a center of my being he woke me up this morning and he has kept you all these years and he will keep you in this year let the redeem say [Applause] so Hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord you may be [Applause] [Music] seated just a few minutes I'm going to go as long as you could go so what time you finish is entirely up to you because it takes the people to pull the gift the preacher can never bring the Revival but it takes the prayer and the worship and the hunger and The Thirst to operate a gift so you have the remote control this evening you could operate a gift you could turn up the volume you could change the channel you could do whatever you want to tonight because God is a god of the audience he's a god of the people that's why it's bride time it's seed time it's family time it's Dynamics time can the church say amen hallelujah you may be seated just let me drop off this thought we'll have to continue this in regular service I got to take care of the calebs I told them in South Africa is a young people service because on the other side there are no calebs by age everybody is Young so brother George that gray here has a destination to be black again and I'm not talking about using Dy or using any other Tech technology it's just the genetic coding that's inside of you comes from God and once you come from God it could only respond a certain way the bald has got to go back the gray hair got to go back the back that's out of place got to get back everything you lost has to come back we read the scripture return unto the Lord because God said I will restore I'm not leaving it up to you the devil can't get involved because if God said he's going to restore what devil what demon What Spirit no weapon formed against you could Prosper Hallelujah a few minutes so my subject recognizing your day and your message because ignorance of this is what causes the problem in the church amen if you have Clarity of what you are born to do and what your purpose is it's very difficult to backslide am brother the brandham taught us that sin is unbelief and unbelief is sin he said smoking drinking fornication lust stepping outside of your marriage those are the attributes or the outward expressions of sin but at the very core it is unbelief because if you believe and you fear God you would not do anything wrong that's why David and Solomon exalted us that the fear of God is the beginning of wisdom but we live in a time where people don't even fear God so because they don't fear God they walk around as if there are no consequences to actions and when the consequences come they are quick to say oh God help me and God said you broke by very basic of covenants basic of words that you should fear me I am a jealous God I don't want to be shared with your job I don't want to be shared in your marriage what is due to me is due to me I should be first place all the time he is a jealous God can the church say Amen so two things we have to recognize our day yes and we have to recognize our message amen so when we talk about recognizing your day we talk about recognizing the signs and the conditions and the challenges you don't need to be in the message to understand the signs and the challenges and the situations the Pentecostal tell you the hour is late the Baptist and the Methodist tell you time is short so the day is not the issue because the Bible for years spoke of wars and rumors of wars and we are living in that time we are living in that day we recognize the day we live in a day where there's sin not just in the world but sin in the church that's why I read that scripture that's the very scripture God's Prophet read when he preached a message recognizing your day and its message about the sin in the church and about the priest and what they're doing and what is going on but yet still we must recognize our day and our message the hour is late the lid of hell is open and it would seem as if God has reled the rules it would seem as if God has relaxed the rules because for years people have gotten away with stuff gotten away with doing God on your terms when God is the one who set the terms worship is not optional it's mandatory prayer is not optional it's mandatory being in church is not optional it's mandatory singing is not optional it's mandatory having a Revival is not optional it's mandatory it's what we do it's who we are it's what makes us different it's not good enough to recognize your day you must recognize your message because your message you know what a message is a message has a to and it has a from and it has a subject amen that's go amen whether it's a email whether it's WhatsApp it's on the phone when you call somebody you are the from and you're speaking to the two and hopefully there's some content in there even if you say the word hi it still means something of value hi and you have a choice and how to respond but this message that we're talking about is God's own words so he is the from and he had a two so there's a message from God to an elect lady and in that message contain certain things there's a subject in there in that message has Rapture and Fai in that message has healing so when God said hello locked up in every word is power locked up in every word is Grace locked up in every word is the anointing let me give you an example there's a centurion he com to Jesus he said master I recognize that you are a man under Authority because if I say to one go he goeth just speak the word my servant is in trouble notice Jesus didn't even ask for a diagnosis he didn't ask is it cancer is it diabetes is it tumor he said go thy way he is well that was a from to the servant and those words had power those words had the solution to whatever that man's condition was so when we come to the house of God and we speak from the prophet's message it's a message of power that goes to the believer it goes to your family and there's no distance there's no time there's no obstacle there's no hindrance nothing could stop it can the Church Say [Music] [Applause] Amen [Music] a few more minutes somebody just put the volume up somebody wants to get going somewhere they want to they want to see their inheritance they want to see their family delivered from their conditions is there anybody you want to see a family delivered is there anybody you've been struggling with sickness and you want to tell the devil enough is enough enough taking medication my promise is that medication my promise is not doctor's visit you have to come back every two weeks for a checkup no I need to come to the Rapture I need to be the house of the Lord every week that's my checkup not the doctor checkup I love over said we are in authority to cancel every assignment of the enemy whatever it is cancel the doctor's report tell the doctor go back to school because our school is different it's not the School of Theology it's the scho School of the Holy Ghost and Fire and when you graduate from that school your certificate allows you to speak against sickness speak against cancer speak against sin speak against lust and [Applause] fornication you may be seated so you could know everything about the day about the season about the time but we have a message in Noah's day there was a message in Moses day there was a message in Daniel's day there was a message what about our day our message is not just to come to church you could do that in any place it's a higher calling our message is not to be in the message that's like you saying I have a message I have a message I have a message what's what is the message the message that God sent a prophet that's the messenger what is the message the message is not to Brak confusion the message not to bring argument the message is not to have theological debates the message not to be interpreted or misinterpreted because we were taught in the message God is his own interpreter he doesn't need help to interpret in the time and season that the word supposed to be made manifest he doesn't need the preachers to make sense to it because he is the author and the finisher he uses the speech us as microphones and he speaks to his elect lady because you don't belong to man or to the church you belong to God and if God call you he's more than able to keep you he's more than able to save you he's more than able to fill you with the baptism of the Holy Ghost just a few more minutes listen to the prophet reason that people in Noah's day listen carefully is there anybody sleeping show I raise up hands the reason people in Noah's day did not go into the ark and I don't care if this is the first time you in church I know you know about the ark but the B said the reason that people in Noah they did not go into the ark is because they never recognize the message nor the messenger that's the only reason they perish is because they didn't recognize the hour that they were living in Hallelujah so I want to encourage you tonight I want to challenge you tonight I want to push you tonight some people have been on a journey for a long time and it might be feeling weary you might be feeling tired you might say Lord I've been holding on for a long time you have had the message but the day wasn't yet and there are those who just came in at the right time but you need the message because you have to recognize your day and your message and when the two come together when the word meets your time like Mary Mary knew the word a virgin would conceive that was the message but then they came a day when the angel Gabriel came and say hail Mary thou are highly favored let me drop this off friends it's not going to be your preacher it's going to speak to you when God is ready and we said it in South Africa when God's ready to activate you he's going to send an angel it's not going to be man it's going to be the angel of the Lord going to come visit you on your job in your home you're going to be washing the wees you're going to be driving you're going to be on the phone but an angel is going to interrupt your life and say your time is now you've been sitting for a long time but the hour has come for you to get into action to make a church to make a Revival to praise some more to worship some more to sing some more can the church say Amen you may be seated brother Stefan I'm going to have to finish this message some other time I'm on page seven of [Applause] 89 but I feel good because this is our time this is our season the devil is in trouble our commission is to return unto the Lord I'm going to skip through where the B said if the churches today would only recognize the word of God that's made promised for this hour people spend so many time on the mechanics and the details and the technicalities but God is a god of power he's a god of demonstration he said his gospel is not in word only but it is in power and demonstration so we are here to prophesy because the testimony of Jesus is a spirit of Prophecy and I want to walk into prophecy and the prophet the bride and the Holy Ghost has to say the same thing so we got to speak for our young people we got to speak for those that are sick speak for those who are not here right now and say this year is our year this year is our time this year is our season but brother Isaac you said that last year you said that a year before you said that a year before that every year Noah saying it's going to rain it's going to rain it's going to rain but they say but last year you said said 2016 is going to be my year he say it's still going to rain it's still but one day the Rain Begin to Fall the lightning began to flash and there was a manifestation of that word can the church say [Applause] amen hallelujah hallelujah I have a lot of stuff here but I'm going to skip through this we're going to take this up another season another time time so our message recognizing our day is it everybody know that this is the last day is there anybody not sure about [Music] that you think they got like centuries to come and the US just give sanctions against Russia and the prophet spoke about a time of tension and a and a bomb that's going to come to America all these pieces are being lined up in order but you know what's amazing that scripture we read with the brandom typed it he said it speaks to the Jews returning to God but before the Jews can return to God the Gentiles have to come back to God so you can't talk about the Jews because they are God's time piece but God has them on pause because the Bible said he had scattered but he going to bring back he said that scattering he said God blinded the Jews if God didn't blind the Jews they would have seen Messiah because they knew that the day they kn knew what day it was they knew what the message was supposed to be because when the wise men came and say where is he them brothers pulled the quotes well the prophet said there's one to come and if you find him bring back word so they knew the word they knew the day but they failed to recognize the message of the hour and when Messiah was walking the Earth the Pharisees didn't recognize him he looked like him he but it's like I don't know who that is they didn't recognize him but you a veiled message hidden for centuries Paul hinted towards it John was caught up he went higher and saw it but you you recognize it from the east from the west from the north from the south you never met the prophet but when you saw the word you saw your name you say I know who that is when they spoke when the word spoke of adoption and Perfection I'm not sure you spoke like Paul I do not claim to apprehend or comprehend but this one thing I know forgetting the thing that have passed I was born in sin shaped in iniquity I made all kinds of mistakes but there's one thing I do know forgetting the things that the pass I'm reaching the something that's beyond something that is Supernatural something from eternity something from God because I come from God and I'm going back to God somebody say Amen oh my my my my my 2017 is demon chasing time we are serving notice you may have had havoc in 2000 and 2010 and 11 and 12 but 17 we are taking back what the devil took from us all the young people they're coming back the sick has got to be healed those that are dead they're going to be raised up because we have a Ministry of Resurrection so I don't care how bad it is what happened is irrelevant we know who we are I'm getting ready to why now now a few more minutes recognizing our Dano message it's a message of truth that's the message we are speaking about tonight it's a message of life it's a message of power it's a message of adoption it's a message of perfection it's a message of Revival it's a message of Victory it's a message that show us how to go amen there's no other way to go but up but we have a message to teach us how to get up it's a message for our families it's a message for our children it's a message of healing it's a message that's Vindicated it's a message that's already overcome it overcame in Paul's day in irenia day Martin Luther it overcoming every day and in our day God in his wisdom took all the word and tied it up in this day and give you the whole Atomic weapon he put the whole payload in this Rapture Express so that when we leave we drop the atomic [Applause] bomb and finish the enemy am hasn't he had his run for a long time well we are serving noce Satan you can't avoid this one because this bride is going to overcome because she has a message that can never fail Rapture in faith is laying in that message Redemption is laying in the message can the church say Amen oh I'm going to skip to the end you can be to play something softly hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh my Hallelujah is there anybody want to return to the Lord amen get in order get ready for 2017 Get Ready Get Ready Get Ready brother brandham in the message why little Bethlehem and I'm getting ready to close it with this this was preached in 1963 in December of 1963 so he was he was addressing the whole Christmas season and the coming new year as well and brother Brandon was preaching for a while but he came to a crossroad in that message and he say Oh Come stand with me by my side and he speaking to the church in Phoenix Arizona there but I believe that he was also speaking to us in this day and this time he said come Stand By Me He said I'm standing in a terrible place so he was seeing what was happening around him it couldn't be a terrible place in that physical church he was in another realm as he was speaking he said I'm standing in a terrible place he said I challenge today these tapes go over the world so we were not here but the tapes have come to us he said I challenge some man some Warrior who loves Jesus Christ that knows that these things has got to be fulfilled today Brethren come stand by my side and pull the word of God forget those dried ssts and stagnated denominations that former religion but pull the fresh word of God let's give Jesus a good drink of fresh Pentecostal water that's his desire today back to the original Pentecost back to the word it's prophesied we do so in Malachi the 4th chapter return the faith of the children back to the fathers and he asked a question who would stand this morning and I asked a question who would stand this morning in the opening of 2017 who was stand Oh my he said oh you Bethlehem dwellers I call for men are there men in the house not males men could be a male and not be a man but are there men in the house Christian men Real Men of God who are not afraid I don't care if there's 800 standing on one side and 10,000 on the other I want Warriors who will come with me and cut a hole through this line of unbelieving Philistines trying to make Creeds and feed the people oh Hallelujah he said let's get in there he's cry for a good fresh drink of Pentecostal Water original Pentecost not a bunch of carrying on or Screaming or hollering I mean a genuine Holy Spirit baptism that produces the life of Jesus Christ back into the person woo Hallelujah he screams out again oh men of God where's that sword our Lord desires a fresh drink amen he said I don't care if it's life or death that's how real it must be to you I don't care if it's life or death but this year is my [Music] year Hallelujah I'm going to get the Holy Ghost if he doesn't fil me you're going to find my bones right here but I'm not going to move I'm going to keep praying I'm going to keep holding on for my children holding on for my family because this is too important it's too real a call is going out this morning return to God come come come return unto God brother Bram ghost and I'm calling for men to Stand By Me stand with the word what the word says do do it just the way the word said I don't care what anything else said stay it that way it's the only thing that will cut amen amen so when this message that we have recognized to be the truth is applied in its power and with Simplicity and the same way the prophet said he said it will cut every time no interpretation no feeling no emotion but you take the word of God and lay it to your situation lay it in your marriage lay it in your finances lay it to your children lay it in your house and watch the demons go to running because you are sons of God you are Daughters of God born for such a time as this can the church say amen amen is there anybody wants to return unto the [Music] Lord friends you may be seated hall hallelujah the season is changing and when the season changes you cannot do anything about it you just have to respond amen and with the season of blessing and restoration it comes with judgment because brother the random said many times the people did not realize that God keeps his word not just His blessings and promises but he keeps his curses he keeps his judgment I'm going to share a story with you have we all may know it or some may know it but brother Brandon was standing one time and his son Billy Paul messed with the tupe on his head and brother Bram went and pray and he stood and interceded for his son and Billy Paul didn't understand what was going on because he couldn't understand the spirit realm and what was taking place and you know what brother real said to him he said I forgive you he said you're my son he said but I have no power I have no control over the angel who works with me and that angel wanted to kill Billy Paul for messing with his father's head that's the kind of season we are living in it's the reality of another Ephesians we are back to the time of Anan and Safar we are back to the time of judgment but also Deliverance amen so I want to challenge you Church of the Living God don't take this for granted don't take prayer meetings for granted amen recognize your day recognize your message that was brought dripping with blood recognize that it's the grace of God to us to understand these things to be here tonight to hear the these things not just to be in the message but the brand in the token said don't just say you want to hear the messenger he said obey the message am don't just say we know God sent the prophet that's not good enough what are you doing with the prophet's message recognize young people your day recognize your message in this message where the Brandon went into it he spoke about the woman and the way they dressed and the way they act and the men in the church and the way they dress and the way they act and as I challenge the Church of the Living God this morning whether it's Minister Elder Deacon trustee Usher it does not matter we have to recognize our day and our message we have become lazy we have become full we have taken things for granted we come to church when we want we come to church whatever time we want we dress any way we want and and judgment will begin in the house of God Amen and because we have been given the word We Know Better what is our excuse Hallelujah recognize your difference recognize your message it's easy to shout and jump into 2017 but if you walk into this new season without understanding how dangerous the ground is you will lose the Holy Ghost is moving around right now to put a mark upon those who sigh and cry for the abomination in the city not just in the city but in the Church of the Living God Amen fathers who have abandoned their positions mothers have abandoned their positions daughters have abandoned their positions because we all have a position amen amen we are striving to be positionally placed to live such a life that people will look at us and say yes I want to be like you that could only happen if you recognize your day and recognize your message Amen in that same message where the Bram said God will raise up prostitutes if he has to because his word will never fail and if you reject this message if you reject his truth if you reject his gospel God will raise up Stones if he has to but his word will come to pass but I believe in my heart tonight that you are here because there's a call that has arrested you a call that has reached into the sockets of your soul and you have responded to that call friends don't silence that call in Your Heart by The Busy schedules by your Ambitions by your plans and your dreams and your aspirations Because unless God has signed off on it you are going against his will amen oh you don't hear me tonight amen oh yes oh yes this is where we need to be right now there are people that should not leave the church tonight without repenting there are people that should not even you should be scared to face 2017 carrying the stuff of the past I challenge you tonight to put it under the blood and say God I'm not going to do it anymore Lord this lust this this lying this this laziness this this jealousy this Envy this Lord I've been carrying this for a long time and I I I want to let it go but I don't want to carry it into this new year I don't want to walk out this church the same that I came in let me bury it in 2016 and pH 2017 knowing I could receive the holy ghost that I'm a candidate because I want to apply the word to my life Gods an expectation of us he expects something from us just as we expect him to do stuff right we expect him to help us we expect him to fill us well he also has an expectation because he has no hands Jonathan he has no hands but your hands he has no eyes but your eyes where will you take him oh God Hallelujah Jesus is looking for a vessel right now yes he's to give us somebody because he wants to walk the streets of pter Spain I am he wants to walk into the universities he want to walk into your neighborhood and he needs a vessel to use is there a vessel that God could use where will you take the Savior where will you take the Redeemer where will you carry him what conversations will you let him [Music] witness I challenge you Church recognize your day and your message because when you truly recognize your day and your message then you can return to God and say Lord I'm coming home 2016 may have been my year but Lord I want 2017 to be your year 2016 I did it my way but I come tonight Lord to to give up to your way I
