homes may you minister to them and meet their every need we bring a May before you with this PR foot that you would touch her and heal her as you approach your word Lord May presence be with us that you could bring the clarity of the word to your people make the word plain make it that their faith could rest solemnly upon what you have promised God may it never become boring to them these precious promises that we have been preaching for years and lay in your word may it not be come ordinary but it may always be special father we could see that the God who spoke these promises is obligated to fulfill them and we are resting on that our trust is in the speak to the weak ones the struggling ones the ones that have mind battles the ones who have under oppression depression whatever it is may they be delivered tonight they need sick in our midst may they be healed tonight in Jesus name I ask it amen and amen God bless you and thanks again for being here tonight I'm excited uh for this time of prayer and to share some with you tonight and this is the prophet speaks persecution and trials are a natural normal part of the Christian Life there's only one thing you can do about them commit them all to God judge not and leave the outworking and final judgment to him thou can not bear them which are evil this on Ephesians CH and as try them which say their Apostles and are not and has F them Liars but this is coming back again where a lot of guys will be tried to see what they claim is valid and has found them liar these words now these Ephesians believed that God's people ought to be holy according to the verse they took steps to keep the body unleavened from sin most evidently the apostasy had already started sin had entered into the church but they were obedient to the words of Paul when he said to put away that Wicked from amongst them here we go they were a separated people they had come out of the world and now they weren't going to let the world enter amongst them they would not put up with sin in the church Holiness wasn't afraid with them or a figure of speech it was a way of life and to that end what I got to share with you tonight is two words sanctify yourselves those are the words I have for you tonight sanctify yourselves and this here I'm about to read is from John chapter 17 14- 21 that's the scriptures if you have your Bible you can follow me I have a few scriptures to read tonight and you can follow through with me St John chapter 17 from verse 14 Jesus was speaking I have given them Thy word and the world had hated them because they not of the world even as I am not of the world I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world but that thou should keep them from the evil they are not of the world even as I am not of the word sanctify them through thy truth Thy word is truth as thou Hast sent me into the world even so have I sent also sent them into the world and for their sakes I sanctify myself that they also might be Sanctified through the truth let me repeat that verse again it's verse 19 and for their sakes this is Jesus speaking I sanctify myself that they also might be Sanctified through the truth neither pray I for these alone but for them also which Shall Believe on me through their word that they all may be one as thou father art in me and I in thee that they also may be in one in us that the world might believe that thou has sent me a scripture we read I believe it was Wednesday night 2 Corinthians 7:1 having therefore these promises there be dearly beloved let us cleanse ourselves from all the filter of of the Flesh and spirit perfecting Holiness in the fear of God and one more scripture we're going to read Joshua chapter 3 verse 1 to5 and Joshua Rose early in the morning and they removed from shitan and came to Jordan he and all the children of Israel and lodged deer before they passed over and it came to pass after three days that the officers went through the host and the command of the people saying when you see the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord your God and the priest the Levites bearing it then he shall remove from your place and go after it yet there shall be a space within you and it about 2,000 cubits by measure come not near unto it that he may know the way which he must go for you have not pass said before and Joshua said unto the people sanctify yourself for tomorrow the Lord will do wonders among you so this was God's program before they inherit this land and this is what the prophet says now now when you are asked you are forgiven of your sins you only done this taken that away but the thing that make you do it is still there that all root of evil it is still there notice you repent baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for he forgive you of your sins then secondly comes sanctification which here we go sets our mind in order for Holiness to think right let's pause another a bit sanctification now don't think for one moment I'm preaching Wesley now in that sense or sanctification message and we pass that no no no no no no this still applies what we hear sharing here right now tonight right let listen closely sanctification which sets our mind in order for Holiness to think right and sanctification is a compound Greek word which means clean and set aside for sins so that's the word signification clean and set aside for sins now let's continue now I've typed it with Joshua if you notice Israel was brought out of Egypt and it were three stages of the journey one stage leaving Egypt next stage Wilderness next stage Canaan Canaan does not represent the Millennium it only represent the age of the Overcomer the dispensation of overcoming because in Canaan they killed and burn and took cities there'll be no death in the Millennium but another thing that it does it brings justification by faith after the believe in Moses sanctification and following under the pillar of fire and the atonement of the sacrificial lamb in the wilderness and then entering into the land that have been promised land that have been promised now what is the land promised to the New Testament believer us now the promise here we go is the holy spirit it shall come to pass that in the last days Joel 2:28 I will pour out my spirit upon All Flesh your sons and daughters shall prophesy and upon my hand handmaids and my M servants will I pour my spirit they shall prophesy I'll show wonders of heav and so forth all right did you notice Joshua here we go before the Cross Jordan Joshua said go to the midst of the camp clean your clothes and sanctify every one of you let no man come at his wife for within three days you will see the glory of God see and this is the part of emphasis you know it is a process of getting ready to inherit the promise so cleansing sanctification fasting praying making things right dropping ODS thinking right making that effort to set your mind to his Holiness is part of the process of getting ready to inherit the promise this here is the legalistic part this is the part where you stop smoking stop drinking stop running around stop having your dress above your knee you know stop fooling with the boys fooling with the girls stop fooling around with life stop fornicating stop stop it stop movies whatever this is where you make that decision to clean up your act and clean up yourself now the promise to Israel was God gave the Promised Land of Palestine it was to be their possession let's continue Israel had sinned they had transgressed my Covenant which I have commanded them this is from Leviticus okay Leviticus 11:44 no oh no no no this is Joshua 7: 11-4 Israel had sinned this is God speaking and they have transgressed my Covenant which I commanded them for they have even taken their cursed thing that have also stolen and disassembled also and they have put it even among their own stuff now this is when they were fighting all of a sudden one battle is because they come running so much men get killed and whatnot and Joshua stopped the whole camp and say wait a minute cour promises Victory what promis US Victory after Victory how come Israel turning their backs how come we are being defeated come men are dying something is wrong stop stop stop we cannot continue like this something is wrong and God begin to tell them Israel sin Israel have have have have stolen stuff things among their own stuff verse 12 of Joshua 7 says therefore the children of Israel could not stand before their enemies stop right there so how could you expect God to trample the feat push back your enemies if you have stuff that belongs to the enemy but therefore Israel could not stand before the enemies but turn their backs before the enemies because they were a cursed neither will I be with you anymore except you destroy the cursed from among you so God wasn't coming to touch anything they had God s my hand off for you unless all clean up your act unless you get rid of whatever is wrong whatever is an issue whatever you have to get out of your life you deal with it look at verse 13 and the Bible is written in such a classic way in such a a powerful way no word is like out of line there's no like how we say God is t t r s e he he's con concise precise to the point the first word in 13 is up that one word come up sanctify the people and say you know think about it now early in the morning maybe people have those have sleepy and they waking up struggling and a voice said up get up up sanctify the people and say sanctify yourselves against tomorrow for thus sayeth the Lord God of Israel there is an accurs thing in the midst of Thee oh Israel thou can not stand before thine enemies until he take away the curs thing from among you in the morning therefore he shall be brought according to your tries and it shall be that the tribe which the Lord taken shall come according to the family thereof and the family which the Lord shall take shall come by households and the household which the Lord shall take shall come Man by man and we know the story we will go to details of that Aon was caught with a Babylonian bment and different and Babylonian stuff and the whole family was destroyed and then Israel was back on track so let's continue Leviticus 11: 44- 45 much 44 of Leviticus 11 for I am the Lord your God he shall therefore sanctify yourselves and ye shall be holy for I am Holy so this sanctification is not for Sunday morning only on Wednesday night or when you think this has to become a way of life I am the Lord your God which you and ye shall therefore sanify yourselves you shall be holy for am Holy neither shall you defile yourselves with any man of creeping thing that creep upon the Earth verse 45 for I am the Lord that bringe you up out of Egypt to be your God ye shall be holy for I am Holy First Chronicles chapter 15 verse 14 and the Bible says and said unto them and this is for the this is for the priests now ministers ye shall be the chief of fathers of the Levites sanctify yourselves both ye and your brethren that you may bring the Ark of the Lord God of Israel into the place that I prepared for it for because you did it not at first the Lord Our God made a breach upon us for that he sought him not after the due order so there's an order in which God operates with so the priest Bible said in verse 14 and Levites Sanctified themselves to bring up the Ark of the Lord God of Israel brother BR here you are okay something was looking for is Lord he said there you are don't fall short of that brother without the baptism of the Holy Spirit you are lost you won't have to worry about get into heaven if there's nothing in here your heart Supernatural the doors can't unlock you would walk up there and bump your head against it but if the spirit of God is endear the spirit of God inside with unhinged doors you got to have the thing in here to unlock it Yonder now here he comes talking about Jesus he was Torn to Pieces his soul went to God God blessed him and then his soul here we go returned back in the form of the baptism of the holy ghost that comes into every believer to sanctify to clean up the mind to clean up the heart and leave a portion of the Holy Ghost in there here and there and when the Holy Ghost is given out that same holy spirit that brought the body of Jesus out of the gra out of the Grave will Rapture and that Covenant has to Dove tail he tore there and gave the body and went back to God and the Spirit came back to the Earth then your spirit will have to be the same kind of spirit or it will miss that place going together not because you make yourself but because something the love of God has swept over your soul and tore every Earthly Idol out you believe in God's son God is in his son God is in his Universe God is in his word God is in his people what the death of Christ was was to sanctify a church that he might work through to continue his work so he is kneeling it down that the death of Christ was to bring a Sanctified bunch of people a people who Holiness wouldn't be a phrase but it would be a way of life he says and this is the beautiful part he says he didn't have to die he says no man take my life I lay it down and he was comparing that to ISA because when Isaac asked Abraham I see the word I see the fire where is the sacrifice he said go Prov the sacrifice and when Isaac was tied Isa didn't fight and carry on he submitted himself to die so B says Isaac was willing to submit himself to death Jesus he didn't have to die he said no man take my life I lay it down and he did that that through that sacrifice that fulfilled scripture that Bloody sacrifice now this is the part was so beautiful he said I think the sweetest scripture here in all the Bible is this scripture father I sanctify myself because of them he was a man he could have had a wife he was a man he could have had a home a place to lay his head he had rights to that he was a man he could have had good clothes he was a man what did he say father I sanctify myself for their sake what was he doing he was training up 12 disciples that was going to preach the gospel in all the world he put an example and Brethren as ministers I tell you it pays us not not to get too much of the world goods and things hanging around us you preachers I'm talking to sanctify yourself for them that you're going to lead that is what we need today is a complete consecrated Sanctified life of ministers that will walk upright before God does not entangle with the things of the world keep a away from it father I sanctify myself for their sake not because he had to do it but he did it for their sake so you take a vessel and you pick it up it's full of mud it is Justified a man has to pick it up the next thing has got to be cleaned and scored out and the word sanify means clean and set aside for service but set aside for service don't mean you are in service then Jesus said blessed the day wow when you hung onto for righteousness you shall be filled so you see here we go the Holy Ghost come came on the sanctifying real true Sanctified believer underline that word not just I'm in the message are you a Sanctified believer what does sanctified means it's a compound word Greek word which means to be cleaned and set aside for service the word sanctify in the English means make clean in Hebrew it means make holy the Greek means Sanctified clean and holy is the same thing it is what sets aside for service and about two more quotes and we done now one believe on the Lord Jesus Christ for your house apply the token to your house now watch then what do you do when you apply it to your house and I don't just want you to think about it from a physical house standpoint I want you to think about it from your body from your temple your house that he was Liv move all the trash out get all the short skirts and the shorts and the cards and the cigarettes and television whatever more kick them out the door when you go to apply the token so applying the token is not talk they have a lot of people like to talk and talk and talk we're not talking about talk we talking about action applying the token means move all the trash out get all the short skirts the shorts the cards the cigarettes so tell me you a mother you don't know what kind of clothes your daugh wear you don't see what in her closet you don't see with licking in her and she under your roof now watch the cards the cigarettes televisions and whatever more kick them out the house the door then you go to apply this open it won't stand still for it all the dances parties rock and roll vulgar newspapers and the stuff of the world kick it out the door say we are cleaning up this space around here two more we water don't save a man it takes the blood of Jesus Christ there's no life in water life comes in the blood cell take sanctification to cleanse that life to kill the desire of sin then the Holy Spirit comes into a clean vessel set it aside in work service the altar Sanctified The Vessel but here we go it's the filling is what put it in service it was set aside for service now it's got to be put in service and the Holy Ghost puts the church in service and the final quote I have here sanctification is when your name goes on the book as a Believer your name is wrot in his blood so therefore sanctification or even a Sanctified life is real evidence that you are in this message is an evidence that your name is on the book and you want to live for Christ and you want to make the sacrifices that god require of you if it means stopping cutting off this one shaving this and whatever it is if you know down in your heart you're not doing all that you can do you wouldn't have ha you would have confidence to get access to Healing Deliverance spiritual because your mechanics is not right inside of you you know your heart is not right but tonight you have a tremendous opportunity to get your heart right you're not getting your heart right because you're going to church you're getting right with God it's God we talking about when the god came down on the mountain and the mountain begin to quake and rck the people said don't let God speak let Moses speak God say okay I'm going to come through a man a prophet to speak my voice but that voice of God is still have thunders and lightning and I'll close you this remember friends what we call Mercy Seat is where your judgment throne with blood on it the blood give us the opportunity to access God's mercy we were born in sin shape iniquity on our way to Hell deserve to go to hell but God rich in Mercy rich in Mercy something that he's rich in that is why he w that is why he calls that is why he send ministers and preachers and testimonies and gospel and every light to tell you don't go that route don't go that way but by stubbornness by being enticed by our own Lust by our own desires and decisions and choices and we pay the price of our wrong decisions and choices but tonight I have a word from you sanctify yourself and you will see what God do to you through you by you for you let's bow our heads heavenly father I thank you tonight I believe is a word from you that you give me to share to your people sanctify yourselves lord it's part of your process of inheriting Lord this Kingdom you said sanctify them by thy truth Thy word is truth it's not a phrase Lord It's a word that must be applied in order to walk this part of sanctification it's an effort it's a legal part it's a requirement of yours who he found he called who he called he justified who he justified he had already glorified it said nothing about sanctification because sanctification is the P we work out oh God Hebrews tell Corinthians tell us having therefore these precious promises let us cleanse ourselves you are not going to come down with fork and hoe the clean of the land the people came out of Egypt they had no land they came into a promised land and they had to clean up they had to cut down the trees and and clean up this area and plant and eat of the Corn and so on Mana ceased no more mana mana was required in the wilderness where by your mercy Mana from Heaven fell every morning they picking up fresh Mana but once they hit that land they had to plant they had to S they had to reap they have to wait for rain Sun they have to go into the laws of the land the laws of your economy of the land and that is where they had success as long as they keep away from accurs things as long as they didn't hide stuff and I think among their stuff they would be successful in conquering the land help us Lord to see that the vision is just the same as it was to those Believers and those people in the Old Testament under Joshua it is the same Lord you have sent you sent a prophet and now Joshua the holy spirit is here to guide us into the word to tell us what to do father God May some Cross Jordan tonight and may you baptize them right in their homes where the holy was on fire may they bust through may they break through May they be encouraged Lord May their faith and soul be lifted up in your presence that you could confirm their word to their hearts and lives Grant it Lord and as they get on in prayer with the spirit of prayer and supplication take a hold upon them in Jesus name I ask it amen and amen so as you get on in prayer may you see it as real that God sent a word that you could be Sanctified and stay Sanctified and God going to bless you so God be with you as we get on in prayer tonight [Music] for [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] h [Music] [Applause] [Music] for [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] h [Applause]
