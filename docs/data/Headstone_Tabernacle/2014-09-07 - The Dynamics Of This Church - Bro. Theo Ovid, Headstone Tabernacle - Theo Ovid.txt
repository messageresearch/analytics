that you would inspire to the hearts here people may transform every heart and life here in jesus name i ask it amen and amen you may be seated praise god blessed be the name of the lord jesus and thanks you for that song service certainly felt the presence of god and uh that's what we're here for to enter into his presence so we're here for to enter into his presence it was debt to go in in the old testament now his debt to be outside his presence so his presence is evidence that his blood is among us because it's true the blood you have access to his spirit blood is what produces pardon blood is what produces forgiveness blood is what produces that opportunity for god's mercy his blood his shown israeli a judgment seat it's a mercy seat because there's blood on it blood is what makes it to mercy once there is blood on that seat there is mercy oh we thank god for the blood out of the blood this morning we didn't stand a chance without the blood this morning i couldn't even be here it's only because of the blood and we could stand and speak to you it's only because of the blood you can come and hear the word of god nothing you have done nothing i have done but for the grace of god where would i be this morning but for the grace of god oh hallelujah how a great light shine into our hearts oh praise god we were lost and undone we prayed we were wretched and miserable and poor and blind and didn't even know it but evening light began to shine praise god we are here because of the light praise go to evening light bible prophecy gross darkness cover the earth but god sent a little light that we could stand up that we could worship that we could give god glory oh you love him this morning hallelujah you got to know that you love him hallelujah so this morning our title the dynamics of this church that's the title this morning the dynamics of this church i have an inspiration there must be a manifestation of brotherly kindness before the outpouring of dynamics that's my inspiration this morning there must be a manifestation of brotherly kindness before the old porn of dynamics so we want to go straight into the word this morning amen brother branham so i'll be running and if i even though don't quality title the message you know it's it's in the word but this is something is anything too hard for the lord he was talking about uh otherwise the sodom oh god help we help help help us to wake up the day of physician is here you say god doesn't send angels anymore the holy spirit is that angel the holy spirit is that person jesus said when he the holy ghost when he comes he will do the works that he did and he'd be with us even in us and he would bring things to our remembrance and would show us things to come now from why i'm against organized religion now this angel of light to the loud eastern church age rejected christ on his word for dogma and put him outside he stood at the door knocking trying to could you imagine that christ kicked out of his own church christ on the outside of people singing in the church singing specials in the church preaching in the church and he's outside his own church but watch the church age has rejected christ and christ is the word it's the word that was rejected could somebody say amen and he was on the outside the only church age that we have christ on the outside knocking trying to get in and this angel message messenger come from god was echoing his message on the earth to come out of babylon come out of organization the holy spirit today here we go the holy spirit today the manifestation of the holy spirit watch is that angel trying to get the people back to the world because the holy spirit will only vindicate the word so the first thing when the holy spirit comes is to get the people on the word because he didn't come to just bless you he come to vindicate his own word so if you want to really seal you you have to seal your first with the word with the revelation and then the spirit come behind that word in you then you are filled with power filled with this presence isn't that right because the holy spirit will only vindicate the word it can't vindicate dogmas there is no life in them isn't that right so therefore as paul tell us in ephesians to put on the whole armor of god is not right and we know what that alma is that allah is the baptism of the holy ghost isn't that right and there's we have a promise of power which is dynamics to come isn't that right to release virtue power for service which is dunamis is the word called isn't that right and that virtue power is that the sons of god can be formed into the word image oh praise god how many understand that now oh sometimes you give an easy reference like material you can have sand and gravel and cement and galvanized that's just materials but then when you take it and you build a building with it that's a building you take the material and you form a building out of the very materials so you could leave the material there you could leave the gravel there you could leave the cement there but you could take the bricks and put it together and form a building well what i'm saying the material is in the word but there's an image to be formed there's an image and that's the image right there faith and virtue and knowledge that has to be formed in you how many understand that now that has to be actually formed in you you can't just think it you can't just will it it's got to be formed in you isn't that right oh blessed be name of the lord and second peter 1 3 the bible said according as his divine power has given unto us all things pertaining to life and godliness through the knowledge of him that has called us to glory and virtue oh hallelujah so it's divine power not human power not intellectual power but divine power and that word in the greek means dunamis it means inherent power it means power being able to reproduce itself and that's where you get the word dynamo from it could turn and reproduce itself and that is where i get dynamics so in other words god wants to make you into a little dynamo a little powerhouse that you don't have to get charged up from anything you're going to have your own power a self-sustaining power a self-regenerating power jesus said in his way he that believeth on me as the scripture had said out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water it's the same thing he's talking about he is talking about something on the inside that have power to regenerate itself hallelujah are you talking about you shall receive power oh hallelujah not just upon your shoulder not just upon your life but inside power internal power power to reproduce itself all have power to reproduce itself when you're feeling down when you're feeling low it's a power to reproduce itself that power gonna be in you it's a promise it's the promise of the father he said behold i send the promise of my father upon you oh hallelujah man didn't make that promise man didn't release that promise god himself god himself god himself i send you the promise of the father oh hallelujah hallelujah glory so we want to hone in to your promise for the hour that you are to receive power personally hallelujah you have to receive power a personal personal portion of power your own liquor fire or your own little fire not the pastor's lick not the eldest lick not the church lick but your own lake of fire it's your promise this morning how many believe that hallelujah divine power which given us all things of life and godliness through the knowledge proper knowledge isn't that right so the only way in all words the only way we going to see adopted sons in this on this earth dynamics have to come power have to come to start the sun's rolling hallelujah into the pace of trying to be formed into the wild image hallelujah hallelujah i will say it again because jesus was the example son i say it this way jesus was the example seed sun he was the example he is the plum line he is the measuring rod and when he received his power on the bank of the river the spirit led him immediately into the wilderness to be tempted to be tested he received power power not to post power not to say i'm right you are wrong he received power that he could learn how to overcome himself that's correct power power to overcome yourself power to say the right thing power to control your tongue it is written it is written it is written and it is also written oh hallelujah hallelujah that's the ministry of christ isn't that right and we want to see now from the scriptures the ministry of christ the effect of it what is promised and i'm going to read these scriptures how we're going to see i know christ's ministry back on the earth among his people scripture mark 5 30 and jesus immediately knowing in himself that virtue had gone out of him turned him about in the presence said who touch my clothes that's christ virtue flew in virtue coming out luke 6 19 and the whole multitude sought to touch him for there went virtue out of him and heal them all who is that that's jesus that's the effect of power ministry of christ luke 8 46 and jesus said somebody had touched me for i perceive that virtue is going out of me isn't that right that virtue is power isn't that right hallelujah praise the name of the lord luke 6 19 and all the crowd sought to touch him for a power went out from him and healed them all he had it he could release it he had it he could give it he had it it could flow from him we are not talking about a sermon we're not talking about a teaching we are not talking about a message we're talking about his spirit we're talking about all that was in god he poured into christ all that is in christ he pours into the church and when he start to pour into the church according to acts 1 8 you shall receive power oh after the holy ghost has come upon you oh we have a promise this morning and this service this morning is connected to the service this evening you wouldn't want to miss this evening service they are both connected all blessed be the name of the lord oh you're going to receive power that's your promise no man can take that from you amen amen power out of your innermost being oh praise the name of the lord but branham talk about a man who went to get his car fixed in a garage and uh the man was getting the mechanic was getting trouble to get the car fixed and started and so on and a man was standing there saying i'm waiting for my car i'm late can't you get it on he said i'm doing all i can do real nervous carrying on and directly a well-dressed gentleman woke up look at him for a few moments he said to the mechanic why don't you touch this you're not getting any current she said i never thought of that so you turn on the little thing and there it was the car started and he turned around and said who are you you know who he was he was the chief engineer in general motors he designed the thing so when that mechanic feeling wrong feeling wrong and he can't get it started a man come and say do that do that do that who is he the chief engineer he's the man that designed the thing he know to fix it he know to correct it he know to get it started and we gonna get something started he said if they could only get started god will do the rest oh that breathing of the lord praise god you maybe see that he's in this hour brother when we wonder what's the matter with our revival what's the matter we got the material we got the mechanics but where is the dynamics and that's what we need to move jesus christ on the scene what's the matter i'm telling you there is one here today called the holy ghost that can touch the dynamics he is the dynamics of the mechanics are you hearing it he is the dynamics who is he the holy ghost isn't that right we stand today as pentecostals one of the greatest churches in the nation thousand-time thousands added each year but where is the holy ghost he said we have except speaking in tongues we we see how we acted and shouted and fought but it's the word it's the word turn on the light turns on the mechanics and they become dynamics they are dynamics when the dynamic comfort mechanic it start the thing rolling so all what we scratching up with and struggling with we want to get it rolling but it will take dynamics and we have a promise this church have a promise the dynamics of this church we don't know about other churches but we're talking about this church we have a promise from god and we have to look for it we have to expect it we have to press towards it we have to emphasize it we have to push and focus on it this is our promise oh blessed be of the lord so take the word if there is one little thing messed up it won't start you have a nice car the seat's nice the paint job nice the rims looking very nice you have a nice number plate the air conditioner is supposed to be working but the car cast that so all you have there is just a nice looking mechanic that can't go anywhere you can tell the people that might kind of know let's go no i can't go anywhere can't start you might as well get a bicycle you always might get something else why you need dynamics to get it going so but the branham says if there's one little thing missed up it won't stop lay aside every weight every ism every creed that the dynamics the holy spirit might flow through the world and vindicate the word promise for this day then the great church of god will rise like a feet like a jet propelled plane and take off to the skies to meet her master oh blessed be the name of the lord praise god i've heard by now i see talking about job he said no they had job had no scripture so he had us to wait for the inspiration amen and then he knew by when the israelites strike him he knowed what would happen listen as we go forward that's the church if it's in order set in order it's got the mechanics ready it only need them dynamics tonight here we go if we will get the mechanics ready first thing he said get our hearts right the things that we can do oh brother ovid you mean the mechanics is the thing that we can do yes because you cannot produce dynamics i read it again now watch if we will get the mechanics ready get our hearts right the things that we can do follow every word follow him baptism follow him in every order he told us to do get every mechanic ready and stand there then we are ready for dynamics to be lit off and only god can do that because god himself made the promise only god could do that watch watch watch and that's to drop into your heart that faith that say i am on you so therefore what power do you have right now your power right now this morning to forgive you you don't need dynamics for that your power to repent your power this morning say i am sorry please forgive me you are probably to do that you are part of worship lift your hands your power they say amen you are power they say hallelujah nobody's not holding you back and squeezing on your mouth that you can say amen and hallelujah thank you jesus your power to do that your power to come early you got aimed to come here for nine o'clock that you can make a deposit i pray and praise and thanksgiving and worship you could do that you have power to do that hell god doesn't want to wake up early in the morning god is not going to iron you're close to you it's sunday morning no you are power to iron it the week before in preparation for the week that's coming oh hallelujah your power to come on the expectation you could walk in here drive and drive oh you could walk in under expectation today is my day today gonna be a special day why today gonna be special because i say so and i believe so and i'm expecting it to be so you speak your expectation if i could only touch the him of his garment i want to be healed today i'm struggling but i want to be healed today i want to be delivered today i want to meet them today i want to get in contact with the pillar of fire today i want a brand new experience today now it is you have power to respect each other oh blessed being of the lord but abraham said it's your approach it's the attitude of what it takes and that is what it is tonight dear friend it takes the attitude we are and believe we are in the presence of jesus christ but it's your attitude that brings the results you want results well here's the answer it's your attitude that brings the results the mechanics is here and so is the dynamics if you can only get started god will do the rest oh hallelujah as we say i think some servants are back if the dove is coming for the lamb and the dove coming on his way down the dog look down and see wait is a wolf the dog have to put in reverse gear and just fly off and wait until you see lamb like nature so when you have your wool fish behavior the government is still wait wait until you cool down or wait until you behave yourself and wait until you want to get in the spirit one more time take me back to where i first receive you hallelujah hallelujah waited i'll wait until you come back till tears that come on your eyes you're thanking god for his love thanking god for his grace some people doing like they and god are partners and god going down the road with them that's not how he operates friends hallelujah if you're not flirting and full and wrong god gonna be with you until you go to fool around again then he has to pull off and wait till you repent wait till you make things right wait till you begin to set things in order isn't that right oh he didn't spare his children he didn't spare the children of israel when they misbehave some king of babylon took them into captivity until they cry and weep and veil and mourn when i remember zion when i remember my hometown when i remember where i was from we got the enemies to come and take them out from their land and take them off from their family and their country and they call it the slavery what a terrible thing slavery is rip you off from your country rip you off from your family rip you off into slavery and when the people begin to weep and cry and mourn god come back and punish the king of babylon let my people go release them oh hallelujah god is jealous for his people he hates to see them bowl oh glory to god sit down a minute praise god by the grace of you you'll be seated hallelujah but when his people are trapped can't just bring them out like that there has to be a first they had to be a a weeping in the morning look daniel daniel was crying out to god forgive us forgive your people we have we have come against your prophets we have sinned we have done wickedly and daniel began to seek the lord not only on his behalf but on behalf of god's people daniel had a burden because he saw that time was cutting it close and he wanted to get a revelation of homeless time is left and while he was seeking god angel gabriel fighting spirits in the spirit realm because he want to bring a message to daniel so if you think that things just normal and quiet in the spirit realm you are wrong there's a battle going on and i expected a battle this morning because of what god gave me to preach to you this morning i have a word message this morning and this evening praise god hallelujah and the devil's supposed to fight it praise god because this is your promise this is coming along to the real thing glory to god this is not no appetizer this is the promise itself this is the promise of your father oh hallelujah hallelujah glory to god glory to god you may be seated you see many of you walking here ordinary walk in here with no burden no burden to worship nobody to pray no burden to participate yeah no button to see nothing happen inside of here you come because you have no other place to go you come because it's sunday morning you come because you don't want to look like you're backslidden you come because you don't want to be able to think you miss service forget about to stay home when you come come on expectation when you come come for revival when you come come for manifestation when you come come on the expectation i can't just come to church and just say i'm gonna just say things and talk things and just waste your time i can't do that hallelujah hallelujah oh glory i have a sick i have to seek the lord to ask what god once spoke to his people hallelujah and i want you to have that same dedication and you come into church hallelujah god and a prophet a mighty elijah prophet because he had a whole world to bring a message to he sent that prophet to all kind of tests and trials to qualify him hallelujah to get that book from the mighty angel know that that book is on the earth people taking it for granted they're not even reading the book but you are the words of the book the holy ghost will always point to the word if it points to a creed or denomination it is not the holy ghost he couldn't do that point away from the word he died to confirm that word and make that word positive that's the purpose he's dying with his purpose of dying that he could still project what himself through his church i'll say it again the purpose of christ dying was that he could project himself not church self not man's self himself through his church and make every word through every age act exactly like it's supposed to act he is the dynamics of the mechanics the mechanics of the church what is it apostles prophets teachers and so forth he is the dynamics that works that so buddha branham taking his prophetic binoculars or equipment he break down mechanics to bring in a faithful ministry that going to become watch not the words i'm saying that going to become god's mechanics on the earth hallelujah that going to be activated by dynamics remember you give the reference of a cell phone you can buy a cell phone it's not activated it's a nice cell phone it's the best cell phone but it's not activated you can't call anybody with that it still have to be activated when in like manner the sons of god have to be activated so when you get activated you could call and he could call it he could tell you where to go when to go you'll have a direct line you don't have to ask anybody permission to love you don't have to anybody help who to forgive if this one's forgiven that one you don't have to ask anybody you have a clear line you have a direct flow you have a direct hook up and this is a wireless connection hallelujah connected to anybody this is you and your father this is you and your god oh hallelujah hallelujah notice what jesus told them behold i sent the promise of my father upon you oh hallelujah oh glory glory glory so it's worked by a certain dynamic which is the fire he is the fire so and that's in the combustion chamber and the gas is the word is poured in the combustion chamber and he's the one that sets her on fire so what god is doing right now is filling you up with gasoline the gasoline is the word hallelujah praise god you're going to get gas up this morning oh hallelujah we have a big thing like get your tank full up praise god and we come to put that in your tank and press squeeze hallelujah on you getting full up with gasoline oh glory to god and quarterback scratch the match put it on fire glory that god not that my god you see what happened in the devils now there was not a split they have to be gone because it's a different kind of fire the last time you saw this fire was a long time but fire coming back holy ghost fire holy ghost power virtue powerful service i could sense it i could feel it hallelujah hallelujah praise god you may be seated oh praise him of the lord hallelujah somewhere you're looking weary somebody looking down that's all right fire coming for you too over there god some of you sick some of you upset that's okay some of you trouble fire coming for that too some of your family problems fire coming there too fire coming everywhere hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah it could be a burning fire this is not hell fire no no no no no i won this fire it have this fire and it has hell fire this is holy ghost fire it's the holy ghost and power keeping me alive keeping me alive keeping me alive it's the holy ghost on fire oh hallelujah hallelujah inspired songwriters give me that old-time religion it's the old time holy spirit and the devil won't go near it that's the reason people fear it but it's good enough for me give me that old-time religion all time shelter all-time prayer or time dancing oh time rejoicing old time hallelujah it was good for paul and it was good for paul and silas it was good for paul and silas and it's good enough for me give me that old time not this mud and writing give me that old time whole time singing old time praying old time preacher oh yes oh yes oh hallelujah hallelujah what time religion oh my god the joy bears ringing you don't need marijuana and pop a cigarette you don't need booze my god this thing to get your trunk they were in the upper room they were praying in his name and the holy ghost fell upon them they were walking like drunk men or they were staggering oh they had stimulation of revelation because of the wine upon their lives oh you may be seated oh praise god hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah it's the word coming alive the word being quickened in your life isn't that right you wanna be seated praise god our faith makes that word live that's a thunder that's a thunder that's a bomb our faith makes the world live so the word could be laying right there but the fate is what makes the world live you see lazarus was dead jesus heard when he was sick and jesus deliberately slowed on his moving gear so he would not arrive there when the man is sick jesus want to come when the situation is so impossible that it doesn't even make sense that's what jesus want to deal with he want to deal with what is impossible he didn't want to deal with what you can't handle when there is no way out where there is no way you want to deal with it so jesus came to lazarus a week not in the past right now he's dead officially buried toned sealed this is the end part of the biscuit and the coffee this is the end part of people gathering wearing black this is the end part of that but a sister who believe in resurrection she throwing a gear lord if you have been here i know my brother was not going to die because i know where you are sick don't stay sick i know where you are blind gonna see jeff's gonna hear sick people gonna be restored so i know if you had been here my brother wasn't gonna be where he is now shut up with a stone sealed up dead wrapped up tied up in back clock in that clock but even no lord even no that woman had faith that's a real that's a real powerful faith a man dead and a woman talking about even no never heard anybody say it before but i say even now i never know that happened like that but even now jesus said you see that faith brought the word into action that faith challenged the world to come alive jesus said where have you led him where have you led him we getting started here nothing is moving yet but i just want to know where have you laid here she said lord is the god he said i am your promise let me give you a promise let me give you a promise let me give you a promise i am the resurrection feet peak feet feet bring it alive now watch let's change the story around jesus if you had been here your brother had not died but we still have some more biscuits and coffee you wanted black or always milk and the story would have read that jesus drank his coffee with biscuits and then left jesus and lazarus is safely dead but there's nothing behind her she didn't talk about biscuits and coffee she don't even know and then because of even know and her fate she received a promise the promise was i am because she was talking about i know any resurrection coming on the rise he said i am not talking about that i am that now when you see me you see dynamics i am in other words christ you may be seated was dynamics with flesh on it that's why he said if i don't go that dynamics will not come in this form i can give it to you i can't release it to you in this way all i can give you is a promise received for the holy ghost i could breathe on you i could give you the breath of promise over your life but the father had put it in his own power your time and your season and when your time and season come no man could stop you from your blessing from your healing from your breakthrough from your deliverance when your time comes it doesn't matter what happened last week last year last night does that matter you may be seated that's why that's what i love about the lord he brings it present tense no faith is even now go and sin no more go and show yourself to the priest rise up and walk will you remain perfect he always bring in present tense he said how long in that condition hey he doesn't go that way he said he said he asked the man he said will we meet whole he's i have no man to put me in he going that 38 years that was not the question christ asked all he asked you said last night you're saying last week he didn't ask you that the question is do you want to be made whole this morning i'm a party goer you're going to be your ex party goer after this morning it happens devil just lost him you were ex i'm an accident oh yeah i was one of them high ranking sinners but then i get a call and i answer the call you see you have to answer the call hallelujah glory to god and now i become an ex-sinner i used to be in satan's camp hallelujah ex-camper hallelujah norway and jesus camp hallelujah praise god then you know i learned how to put on the boots and the whole armor and the helmet because i recognize his war the devil don't like to lose his members hallelujah every time you leave he still feel you belong to him he believes you are a runaway slave he is not convinced that you have been redeemed by the blood of the lamb so that is why he's fighting you to try to get you back but he lost the battle oh glory to god you are free this morning the devil lost the battle christ has dismissed your case oh hallelujah hallelujah glory to god glory to god glory to god glory you gonna be seated remember because we were born in sin shape and iniquity have a full nature he know he could activate things that activate us in the flesh and in the natural and in the human spirit he knows that because we are grounded by five senses if we lost the sixth sense in the garden of eden he said malachi 4 to return our hearts back to the sixth sense that we could open the five senses and dominate the five senses and conquer the five senses with the sixth sense of faith because faith knows no retreat say don't give up faith don't back down say it don't retire and listen say don't get old so you kill us inside of here you have no excuse feet feet don't get old feet don't have gray hair on the contrary fate up here on his chest faith always young samson take a jawbone of a mule and beat down a thousand philistines the power was on samsung but they take faith to hold their jawbone listen it could be a bat it could be an ak-47 it could be a big stick a big tree anything you all was licked listen if samsung got a federal ostrich he was still going to beat them down it was embarrassing for the soldier to report when the man said how much thousands how many people home people he had how big was the army man said it wasn't a dear you know it was him say stop there's a thousand of my man got killed you know got beat up here tell me again stop lying how many men man ben is healing shame he says samson he stopped calling him samson well you might know because samson have a rep already that's what power does that's what dynamic does that's what you see with a man that anointed with power you see evidence of that power someone tell them i'll come back you know that's a message no they felt the jawbone they saw the gate move the lion got lick up that's the power of power power is the talk you shall receive more talk you shall receive tracks you try to receive more books that's not the promise of the father there's a promise of some benevolent dunya don't donate i want to do any books here that you could read when you read the books and you recognize what your promises you want your promise oh praise the lord we go a little further so our faith makes that word live because christ in us is a quickener to the word how i wish the church could see that all arguments and strife would be over that would be the supreme court that would be the naught star that would be an absolute praise the name of the lord and there you are that's all we arrive at that's the big machine that's set up they got the mechanics talking about the united nations and the only thing they have to get is satan there with the dynamics to force the marking of the beast and she is forced down then the dynamics is working let me say something too ubc church is united nations united it's a united time as i said nation united iran and america is enemy but you know then united to fight the terrorists isis so two strange bedfellows coming together they have what choice do they have because these guys they're bad enough they're taking heads off and i mean people just leaving the house leaving me you think about that now are you studying if you go paint this year or something and then come in you're leaving paint and brush you're heading out because as either you can't vote or you're there you i mean you know i mean they let them and they put in the video no and on the internet they want the world to be terrorized they want to generate fear hallelujah and god want to generate faith what have to get somebody that he could get that fate activate all right let's go further now now watch i said it's a reverence and respect i believe that the bride of christ is called i believe she is sealed into the kingdom of god i believe the mechanics is here they are waiting watch they are waiting for the dynamics that will take off the earth into glory and the rapture i believe with all my heart he is the dynamics so how a man can release the dynamics when he is the dynamics okay i think about that now we must become members of his machine of his body forming ourselves into his image so christ is the dynamics he is what is promised when that dynamics pours out and god takes some adopted sons then they're going to have sea german the body then they could release power to other sons by the spoken word as it was supposed to be in the garden of eden in the garden of eden the sons were supposed to comfort by the spoken word but because of the fall it fell into sex but when jesus came he said you must be born again of the word and the spirit so why peter yet speak the word the spirit fell upon them that is what happened to cornelius here comes dynamics and mechanics together wait and spirit together and they were born again oh give the lord some praises and we are coming right back to that where the dynamics going to be back in the church that people could be blown by spoken word oh hallelujah oh here we go this is where i get this picture from the dynamics of this church and i don't believe but ibrahim was talking about that brown time i could say and when we say that i'm not this church we're talking about the bright church it's a universal church this is not the church really the church is upon ibili's church is a rock of revelation the church is a universal bright body the dynamics of that church this church is a refilling of the holy ghost oh hallelujah could we say amen the dynamic is what are we filling in other words that confirms that god have to start with the filling and that feeling will be virtual power for you to stack your experience to climb up and when you climb up here comes the refilling to cap the pyramid of your life oh give the lord some praises people hallelujah hallelujah this world in itself confirms virtue powerful service starts the sun's growth experience into the pyramid life that in his place of trying he could add virtue and knowledge and temperance and all out the way and then here come the cap of that pyramid the spirit itself hallelujah coming to come along upon that son in other words look at jesus the holy ghost came upon him led into the wilderness jesus great grace and knowledge and then afterwards matthew 17 the holy ghost come back again upon him and say hearing him oh hallelujah adopt the son isn't that right the dynamics of this church will be refilling of the holy spirit that we have worked in a small measure while the headstone is coming down to unite with the body isn't that right and when the head and the body unites together the full power of the holy ghost would raise her up so before the headstone connects with his bride the bride will have he said from christ his spirit coming into the church headstone coming down the great magnet to magnetize the elect hallelujah yes a ufo coming for us unidentified flying object and coming to pick up his people that that flying saucer praise god your flying saucer oh hallelujah praise god a great magnet the headstone coming to those people that are magnetized with the holy ghost so the holy ghost is what keep you magnetized therefore you're got to get the holy ghost not just books not just tapes not just sharing in a word you've got to be magnetized i don't know what you ever do in school at school use a kind of rubber material until you get magnetism in it take a metal and rub it rub it rub it and afterwards you start to pick up things pick up things that's what you're talking about let the holy ghost have to rob you so periods go come you come save as you get rid of them and afterwards you start to get magnetized except they get that magnetism inside of you then you pick up virtue you pick up knowledge you pick up temperance you gotta pick up the word you're picking up the right things why you have the magnetism of the holy ghost because the holy ghost desires the word the holy ghost feeds on the word and if you get the holy ghost all you want is the word oh the word become your diet oh the word is on menu isn't that right praise god god adoption trying to place his church in position to manifest himself so we find out according to what we just read here god has the place his church in position purpose to manifest himself getting one that he can work through and say there's my spirit flowing freely i can work here notice not there's my revelations there's my teachings they are my messages there is my spirit what does that mean that means the man has become a channel of god he has nothing to hinder the flow of god in his life god doesn't flow to the head god flows through the heart prophet peace out musical doors and doors have doors at the private life doors here doors your doors are all about inside your heart you've got to open those doors to let christ come in those doors some people have said don't talk about me don't say this and don't say this and you keep it all up christ comes out of there you've got to slam all those doors open that he could fill the vacancy in your life are you with me now listen to this there is my sport god trying to place a situation position to manifest himself getting one he can walk through like this saying there's my spread flowing freely there it is i can work here get another one over there and place him i can place him adoption placing manifesting taking him out put a ceremony on him visit him with an angel tell him something if he told the truth if he just make up something it won't work we have had lots of that i mean manifestation of sons of god when god manifests himself and sends him out and when he goes forward what he says is the truth and what he does is the truth what he does he manifests christ are we looking for that manifestation aren't we oh we heard nice messages over the years 30 plus years of nice messages but we're still looking for christ manifested isn't that right hallelujah not what he preached but what he's manifesting isn't that right okay here we go oh you love him this morning and serve him with all your hearts oh blessed be the lord notice abram and sarah the promise of transformation by dynamics let's look at ibrahman's era stage one abraham believing by revelation the promise praise the name of the lord blessed be the name of the lord blessed be name the lord remember the bible say abram believe god are the staggering of the promise i've got you unbelief but was strong in faith given praise to god is that right so i call it stage one abraham believe them by revelation the promise stage two after believing for 25 years here comes a voice hello invale bringing back the same promise after 25 years but this time identifying the season in other words he came to abraham to tell him he is coming and the season will be time of life i will return so here it is god tell the man he got my son isaac after 25 years here come on manifestation it's not the sun yet it's not the sun yet a man god spirit elohim with flesh on it come until abram i will return according to time of life stage 3 was not a man stage 3 it was dynamics stage 3 a man didn't come again so why to look for a man stage 3 was the power the spirit transforming abram and sarah oh could we worship the lord let's look at elisha stage one mantle shown on him a touch a taste a call to follow mantle pull off of him stage two the test i call it the stay here test stay here at giggle stay where you are you don't have to make any progress you don't have to grow you could stay how you were the church you come from used to do it so and you're doing this all right you because that is how you always used to do it that is this day so test stay a gig out stay at battle stay at jericho elisha overcome all of that he says i'm not staying here i am not staying here i have to move on and he's pressed on until he had a call across jordan hallelujah then when he crossed jordan he got a promise double portion if you see me go you want another portion if you see me go you gotta promise you're gonna get it if you see me go if you don't see me go you're not going to get it if you see me go it's yours hallelujah are you going to keep on watching are you going to keep focused hallelujah are you going to keep focused you got to see something oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah now being man all the people that spoke to elisha at gigger like jericho and battle these at the school of the prophets they say you know your muscle be taken from you you say hey i know and hold your peace i will shut up don't even discourage me you can't discourage me i wouldn't allow you to discourage me i am focused i want my dynamics i want my portion i want the power of virtual power notice elisha cross jordan with elijah notice those other guys they're looking they see them both crossed and they're waiting they're waiting they're waiting to see what's coming back they're waiting to see who coming back they're waiting to see how many coming back isn't that right elisha in stage two crossed jordan hallelujah he got the rule whatever i'm calling a secondhand rule this was the room of a prophet this is a second uncle you know what there's a huge rope this is not original robe there's no aim cut for elisha he's a secondhand robe and he feel like a prince he took off his whole robe he put on the second-hand robe and he looked into something to move and nothing moving nothing moving stage two nothing moving and all of a sudden a key turn in his heart he recognizes not this rule i have to get this thing for his hand i can get a second on revelation i can get a second an inspiration i can get a second hand message i have to get dusty at the lord oh where is the lord god of elijah where is the lord god of elijah then he took the mantle and strike the jordan and jordan did what jordan know it had to do when a man anointed with faith wrong when the school of the prophets see elijah come back over they have to confess they have to confess the spirit of elijah don't press upon elisha because we see the same signs we see the same wonders we see in the same miracles they have to take note that you have been with jesus they have to take note that you have been contact with something bigger than you something more powerful than you you have to take note that you have been with dynamics you have been with jesus oh blessed be the rock of our salvation hallelujah so the third stage elisha had was to call upon god to contact the power and the spirit for that promise that he was received so it means even though he crossed all the way if he didn't get the key to ask for the god that elijah had he was just going to be a man swimming over jordan with a rope on his back hallelujah because it take power to open up jordan if you don't have the power you better swim or wait till the jordan go low to cross over but elisha when he called for the court of elijah that god made an appearance i'd like to see what god does he does leave himself on the edge of your fate if you don't go to the edge you're not going to see here some people playing it safe don't play it safe let your faith go out let's take it to the edge he is going to be there when you need him oh blessed be the name of the lord i know the devil will bang your mind you may be seated and tell you what if he's not there what if he don't appear what if he don't confirm those two hebrew boys went through their own stuff they say our god is able to deliver us and if we don't deliver us we are not going to bow down god took them to the edge they were getting closer to the fire and quad wasn't there it was only when they get inside the fire that's the very edge itself in the fire itself in the fire itself some of you you don't even want to go near the fire but if god before us who can be against us if god be for you who can be against you come on now let your feet go out don't be afraid of going to the edge let me be seated oh glory don't be afraid faith is what it will take to go all the way in god amen the dynamics is the promise that no man can fulfill not even jesus he breathed on them receiving the holy ghost if jesus could fulfill it then he could have give them he could appoint upon them but all he could give them is the promise he said i have to go if i don't go comforter will not come i will give you another comforter who in the world cannot receive but you see him and he you do not with him but he shall be in you he is now with you but he's going to be in you who will hallelujah a little while the world see at me no more but i'm going to come in a different way i'm going to come and even for him it could be the same jesus i'm going to hide myself inside of you a power gonna come upon you hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah are you with me oh let's let's take another one look at mary bible said virgin shall conceive that is scripture hallelujah here come mary that's the word i promise hear the angel come to bring back the same word i promise mary you are highly favored mary you are the one spoken about in isaiah 9 6 not the angel manifesting things yet the angel come to remind mary of the word of promise the lord is with dead blessed adel so let's look at this stage one the scripture full of the promise virgin shall conceive stage two angel appearing to mary to give mary a promise of a mighty visitation to give mary a promise of dynamics coming upon her married a question how shall these things be how shall this dynamic is gonna come how it's gonna be fulfilled how i'm gonna get messiah he said the holy ghost the holy ghost the holy ghost the holy ghost the holy ghost gonna come upon you jesus hallelujah my hallelujah so when the sons receive it adopted dears my spirit flowing freely out of the body of sons it wasn't me sons in that sense it would be the spirit himself bringing out sea germ from the body because that's how sons are born a father i have a german hallelujah to the betting of a mother a son is perfect and the same way the sons of god could have the german of god because it will be god in the sons and god have the germ and the german in god in the sons will be released to call our sons by the spoken word therefore every elected son that was locked up in the loins of adam that was supposed to come forth by spoken word expression will come forth as names from the book in the last days the book is the term the book going to be in a fightful ministry and from that book names gonna be called by the world people are going to be sealed right in their seats the predestination going to be sealed even over the internet but if brenham said the holy ghost will sweep across the world overnight nothing going to stop it nothing going to stop it let me see that hallelujah the dynamics is the promise of the father when sons receive it and it's forward in the word we said that amen the promised dynamics is also the promised lattering according to the scripture matthew 13 he achieved the good son of man the field is the world the good seed are the children of the kingdom the evil seeds are the eternal wicked one the harvest is the end time the reapers are the angels that's the prophecy and but abraham had a vision the vision was the tears crying for rain and the wheat crying for rain it was taking rain to manifest both so the dynamics going to come from god who controls rain the farmer follow the plant where he planned if god has said it really fall a farmer operates by fate a fisherman operated by feet a fisherman from my fate if you want to see fit go and see a fisherman trolling his net he don't know what's under there you have no spy glasses to see how much fish where the fish is suppose the fish decide to go south since what if he said let us go up north he could say the whole night i caught nothing beat a horse a fish all night and call nothing but when jesus brought a word cast a net on the right side hallelujah you mean no he said no they say but just about no office i have nothing to do with just now i am talking about now oh hallelujah hallelujah and if god say no cast it right now pray it right now praise him right now worship him right now believe it right now receive it right now oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah they obeyed peter obeyed if peter was argumentative if peter was his intellect he got a debate with christ as a whole night we tired we weary oh hallelujah you can't expect me to put back that net in the boat a rack in the sea but peter knew different if the lord speaks my word my word my word cannot return void my word can return empty my word and have a hook on it my word have something to bring up my word had something to pull through so the ministry of christ he walked with the disciples the ministry of christ christ walk with his disciples his ministry ministry of christ christ himself isn't that right and he came for disciples temporary power in matthew 10 behold i send you power her power was serpents and scorpions they did not have the holy ghost they didn't have character they had jealousy and envy they didn't have it they were preaching and witnessing and did not have what they took that paul was a taste that power was temporary that was that permanent power that was temporary power that was christ with them hallelujah giving words of promise the same works i do shall you do also christ giving them promise if you shall say it to the smoking we move i don't know in your heart you shall have whatever you said he knew they had not the character they did not have the character for that yet but they didn't hinder him from trapping the promises upon them because the promises belong to them the secret things belonging to the lord about god but the things that are revealed belong unto us and to our children so jesus knew as sons of god these promises belong to them even though they didn't understand it even though the fear couldn't grasp it it belonged to them and these promises we preached by these promises by these promises hallelujah you become partaker of the divine nature these promises belong to you yes i know some of you are wary but the promise is yours yes i know some of you are tired but the promises are yours yes yes i know some of you have dead but the promise is still yours some of you people give up give up but the promise is still yours you may be seated if god wanted goku to bring him into a land but god make sure the land is populated the land not only are philistines or hittites jebusites decide that right god and god said that is yours are you seeing smoke from a philistine pot cooking on a mountain you're smelling freshly killed goat goat meat you're seeing huts you see in tents you're seeing philistines symbols ritualistic images of their gods and god said that land is yours and god said drag them out i'm not trying to pump you for nothing i just i just observing you today i just pushing the word have a pure word message today you've got a club show you've got gestures i know the land that is mine i already saved the philistine notation since since 1975 i on my way i can't back down now i can't give up now you know you maybe see that they find somebody digging for gold they dig dig dig and they get so tired and weary and they give up and our next man just just put each other wong soo and they swim back you're already halfway you have a hole have to go back continue press the continue button you already reach halfway you have the whole halfway to go back then you waste your life you waste your time continue there is more there are more land to be taken there's much more land to be possessed when i see brother branham pray for 80 years old and people get healed i recognize 800 god healing power 80 year old enough for you to get some kind of awake clothes to say when he doesn't go there they go dead goku healer 90 year old goku hit a hundred year old person got to get him a new spleen new spline people get new listen man does make manufacture heart and put heart inside of people's body on the living there's a man-made heart much as a god-spoken heart so you mean my god can speak a heart he can't create a hat thing i told her about this about a girl that had born without eyes all she had sockets came up to brother branham and then the holy spirit i just roll around to form the eyes and the middle of form in the eyes you say i forget to ask you what color you want that choice is still yours you are blue you want brown you want black what color is the one that will be talking about nobody says in dynamic season missing limbs will be restored did you hear that promise missing limbs will be restored oh you forget about that promise you mean somebody lose a leg they could get it back lose their eye they can get it back lose your hand you can get it back missing limps will be restored you talk about power let there be a squirrel over there hallelujah you understand what god wanted and trust with sons you may be seated jesus took bread and multiplied the bread was already baked the fish is already made isn't that right but we're talking about where there is nothing and you making something if you shall say to this mountain and don't doubt in your heart hallelujah hallelujah glory to god imagine you said let there be a revival let there be healings let there be ceilings let healing come to family and homes oh hallelujah glory to god hallelujah remember you see that i think it was philly or knock to one of them guys in those old days when they on the way man was kind of couldn't win a handsome contest he wasn't very good-looking and somebody came and told and he had a kind of raspy voice and some news people come and take a thing with him and say ugly voices nice you know and i think when they laugh they say that's good people are coming to see me or hear me they come to see jesus because if if i ain't looking good my voice not good the show not coming from the looks of my voice then they're shocked coming to me jesus in those days men walk into offices and people fall under the power of god when they walk into the office secretary type is falling under the power of god think about it no man you walk in the office and power walk inside a deer people want to know what mean at this you talking about three blocks from the service people falling on the streets because the anointing from the service is all around the church all around the church grounds people walking that's what i want to see when they come out the car they wouldn't just come on a kind of lazy kind of way you can't wait to run up them steps you can't wait to get into his presence you can't wait to worship you can't wait to do that that will be talking about hallelujah please god amen here we go can we take some more so they have a spirit of christ walk them up the resurrection fate and that's what i see christ could only take them up to resurrection faith they see jesus they know he's not dead they know he's alive their faith now is specially anointed because they know the messiah is alive and he tell them behold i send the promise of my father upon you carry you in the city of jerusalem he didn't tell them when on tuesday this date and that date he ain't telling them when he just said stay there until until until until you get a new revelation no until you receive power from where from a deacon no come along by crate coming on an airplane in a box smack power to you no no no it's not coming that way power from on high that is what this will need power from on high not power for some bishop not power from some man power from on high you see when you get power from an eye those who low can't take off that power because that power comes from on high hallelujah those on the ground can upset that power because they come from high i know what the scripture said power belong to god do you know god gives power god raised up king and said dunking goddess take people out of power their kingdoms have been removed goddess take pastors out of power take men out of power take king and pray all the power god has set up who we want where he wants to face purpose nothing shall escape god's purpose and plan hallelujah do you know god set you up in power the amen that you say to that some of you you ain't sure about that some of you need to listen back to some of the messages that preach already i talk about the layers of demon power god at the mind to find you you know why daniel had to wait how many days i had to wait because gabriel was detained by evil spirits here to fight true but abram said if daniel stop praying the angels stop coming home and you know that amen he said if daniel only stopped praying if daniel got where he said god i don't know now enjoy her stop i going back but daniel he believed god was going to answer so as he prayed angel coming and he prayed right through daily angel come right through to him hallelujah daniel almighty man seeking god to find out the will of god hallelujah praise the name of the lord but abandon your written epistles right of all men to another wrong read of all man manifested word of god peter and john they had no education but they had taken notice that men were jesus they were ignorant and unlearned but they were written epistles read that they had been with jesus read that they remember jesus because jesus here we go was manifesting himself through them christ veiled in their flesh manifested made alive like he was in moses you see you you will recognize in what i am preaching and i'm we're doing this for years i emphasize strongly the life the manifestation i strongly emphasize that because i believe it has to come forward i cannot believe after 40 plus years we have to have more teachings and teachings and revelations and i i i really can't see that i am seeing that we are coming to ripeness and that's brotherly kindness broadly kindness is evidence of your rightness and after that the spirit have to come to connect with that okay so watch tree is perfection from prison the ministry comes to its perfection when it reproduced christ again in the natural among human beings and we read for you how virtue came under christ now we can't manufacture that we can pretend we can't set somebody up touch me touch me touch me and see vote you come out that's not working i don't have that and you ain't get you feel that there's not set up you know what i'm saying it can't work when christ come alive amidst his people the virtue going to flow but iran said you don't have to say anything he will make it known among men it will speak for itself so no body would be uh uh god wouldn't you know people boasting it wouldn't have that it's gonna be christ manifested made a life unlike his words here in the natural it's in other words you have to see it in other words i say this where the word must become flesh not the word becomes more word but the word becomes flesh okay but the bottom says here now if you got the holy spirit in you then you are candidate for association with the unseen world and the supernatural hallelujah watch when the holy spirit comes into the heart quickly you become a twofold being one on the earth to die and one of heaven to live and this body is still subject to death but in his soul he is passed from death unto life and this body has an earthly contact with five senses in his spirit he has contact with god through the holy ghost and the angel of god visits them and speaks with them and they are messengers sent from god to reveal and to bring messages of god to the individual oh praise the name of the lord do you believe that so the sea time is when the seed begins to take on life when these virtues begin to come alive at some point in time you see you cannot expect to be like uh you're born an adult son no you grow in god but abandon said it this way when you say i want to get closer to god what you are saying is i want to grow in god when you have faith you want to get closer you need virtue when you have virtue i want to get closer to you i love you you want that means you want knowledge you want to get closer to god that means they want temperance then you want patience then you want god you see you're getting closer and afterwards you can't get any more closer you become one so that's why that's why jesus come and say when you see me you you see the father he says she was the father but i thought you understand this thing by revelation when you see me you see the father the father is looking at me i'm a mature son now i'm ripened there's my spirit flowing freely the father is working through me if you don't believe me for what i'm saying to you my words believe me for the work sake you see right now nobody could say that because christ is not manifested in that way yet but jesus was in a position to say if you don't believe my words believe me for my work's sake in other words when the they had a man that was crippled and jesus asked them he said this is a given day he spoke the words to the man and they had a problem with that and he knew that issues with pronouncing forgiveness to a man because only god could forgive sins so by saying i forgive you you pray you plain god you are saying i am god that what you're saying they say we disagree with that that can't be he said which one is easier which one is easier tell the man for your sins forgiven or pick up a bed and walk he said i could do both he said mister pick up your bed and walk and a man pick up his bed and walk and they can't how could they deal with that because they can't do either he said i could do both because when your sins are forgiven you could be healed healing is evident your sins are forgiven because healing comes from that covenant of the blood oh glory to god so you can be healed today i look at what the doctors say i look at how you feel you can be healed today during the service right now i'm not talking about tomorrow tomorrow the doctor could confirm that you are healed but i'm talking about right now heal completely be made whole hallelujah the creature don't heal god is a healer and he's the same yesterday today and forever oh blessed be the name of the lord o praise his holy name isn't that right so i believe that there must be a manifestation of forgiveness a broadly kindness before the dynamic strike i'm talking about a real manifestation not a taste it i call it hornets sweet in the mouth i'm not talking about that i'm talking about the honey that sticks the sticky honey the sticky honey the sticky one that's the one division one that sticks i want to read something from a comment given on 18th of july 2010 how oft shall i forgive my brother if he sins against me until 70 times this was spoken in new york and i want to read it now church you may be seated this is very important very important because you cannot if you cannot forgive you do not have a revelation of your requirement for the age as spoken by the prophet malachi 4 and you could never receive the holy ghost without this revelation of broadly kindness now on page 304 which follows the manifestation of brotherly kindness malachi 4 is saying wait till them seven thunders uttered their voices to the group that can handle the bible that can handle the word handle it in love speak to one another in love you don't have to have a title you you are to get in your position and everybody ready to handle the word to handle the word then the seven thunders utter the voices of that group who is in position to handle the word that group that is ready and prepared by the lord himself for our seventh and revival no man can prepare you for that but they are the words of the prophet the son of man isn't that right from perfect faith now fear is based on forgiveness and we said this morning we are trying to get the church into a place to where we could see apostle times moving among us that's what we hunger for it's laying at the door and we wanted to flow to flow out to others so in other words the promise that we're moving into is not for us ourselves the promise we're moving into is to flow out to others it's you becoming your own dynamo it flow out of your bellies i'll flow something's gonna flew out it going to go out to others now let's go so this is what we are waiting for forgiveness a flow not a one-time thing but a flow brotherly kindness flowing out to flow out to others to call to the other sister churches to call to the others because the prophet said when the church finds his brotherly love holy see place in christ it will call to the other members of the body what are we calling say come and rejoice with us we have found the coin that was lost listen to this so may i drop this this is brother coleman marriage of this testimony concerning a flow going out to others while listening to the first service in harrisburg the lord spoke to me to call by the billy paul considering the manifestation of brotherly kindness as spoken by brother branham so i phoned by the billy and give my testimony concerning the meetings at harrisburg and told by the ability that i want to encourage you with this testimony i know how you have been waiting to see these things spooked my brother branham for this bright seven days requirement to be manifest knowing how your father's message was busted up into splinters so much misunderstandings and such but finally brother billy the message came down to the seven age requirement harrisburg it went into forgiveness and this is what happened at the meetings but i believe between six and nine that was laying right at the door perfect feet which is laying right at the door became a reality in harrisburg then brother billy sent back to brother coleman let me give you a testimony a group of 20 believers came directly from your convention to the tabernacle sunday july 11th i was not there but i was told i wish i wish i was there i was told that these 20 believers from the headstone time lachlan trinidad came down this is about to believe the brother coleman whereby the joe they really blessed random tabernacle and manifested a greater anointing of brotherly kindness in branham tabernacle and everybody is talking about it go out the prophet said let it flow let it flow to others amen everybody's talking about it so church catch what happened here i said a nucleus will go out and will go back and go out to other members of the body in other words broadly kindness interaction so by the tear of it that was from brother tears over church god bless you and those believers in your church that did that that was a blessing to me go out and no doubt it will be noise abroad not only what happened but i'm tamaraca but what happened at harrisburg so a mighty thing happened and it's got to excite you it excited billy watch it's got to excite you because think about what happened what happens now when the seven thunders you got barely kindness but when the seven thunders uttered their voices to a group a people who is manifesting brotherly kindness who is manifesting their seventh age requirement they shall break forth healings they will break forth signs wonders miracles or point of the dynamics to their mechanics i might say this brother coleman this is barack woman bradley kindness is the revelation that releases the holy ghost but you don't have to look far to understand that you can just look at the pyramid after brotherly kindness is holy spirit so then what we said is the night of the prophetic utterance in kyle 23 years ago the holy spirit is trying to see one to see the whole thing but where is the brotherly kindness where is the forgiveness oh hallelujah praise god just think the holy spirit can pour in upon you if there are no oughts in you against anybody there is nothing no devil could prevent you from receiving the holy ghost if there is no odds in other words you have rendered satan harmless oh praise anyway he cannot stop you oh blessed be the lord isn't that right satan you can't do anything he is rendered harmless he cannot stop you oh glory to god because you have no oughts he has nothing he can work through if everybody in this church no arts no grudge the devil do i have a speck i find no fault in him ah glory hallelujah glory hallelujah no watch it doesn't matter what anybody has done to you it doesn't matter what anybody has done to you because you have an open vision of forgiveness which is the channel for charity to come down dear that channel will flow out to the members of the body whosoever will so church do we finally understand that the seventh and the fate we have been speaking about is based on forgiveness you cannot get around it oh praise the name of the lord once that revelation from malachi 4 has been established they must come to it or be cut off but the bride she humbles herself she drops her out she forgives oh praise the name of the lord now i read that to say that this testimony was a sign that wasn't the real thing that was not the honey that sticks because some of the president who was in that not even in this church right now hallelujah hallelujah you understand what i'm saying so all of this is for science i am not talking about this i am talking about that that the prophets take off the honey that sticks there is going to be a manifestation of brotherly kindness i am not talking about revelation i am talking about manifestation let me give you all some praises now i read this to show this was a real experience but the terence was there real holy spirit poured out people were crying real experience we had it in cairo you can't put it on it's a feeling amen it's a feeling of brotherly kindness is that an emotional hip-hop is that something is a spirit of brotherly kindness it is what makes you put yourself on the brother's place on the matter before you judge somebody you put on their shoes and walk where they walk i'll restore all right amen now jesus spoke let brady love god paul said rather let by love continue that was in the first church but something taking place there's a fellow come by name of palmer woman and when he began to eat that vine of really love he cut the very sap line of it because it don't make any difference how smart we are how much we think we know how much we want to be different from somebody else but as long as that brotherly feeling isn't among us we are fighting a losing battle we can't win there is no way to win you you believe that as long as that brother is that what the devil does kill it and make doctrinal wars kill it but as long as that feeling is not there you can't win because faith is based on forgiveness hallelujah so to approach into sort of moving the perfect fate you have to have a forgiving heart is not right notice the first gift is wisdom the first gift of wisdom which is the best gift of the group if we don't have wisdom we won't know how to use knowledge which is the second gift so wisdom is how to use knowledge wisdom is first knowledge is second and if we can't use the second gift without wisdom how are we going to use the last gift interpretation all right no but imam said when the nomination isolates himself and separates his fellowship from his brethren that old palm room has eat the liver to begin with when we get to a place if you want to be different with a man why is the man i know i couldn't see eye to eye listen to this there's a man i know that i couldn't see eye to eye with as close in the script as anybody in the world is brother more set in here and we do get times when we are million minds apart in the scriptures but i'm a brother more but did that ever touch us no sir he loves me well enough not because he gives a penny of money no sir he flies on an old lockheed plane and everything else to get over here to be with me every little bit i don't believe that night would ever be too dark or the rain would ever fall too hard but what i'd climb and crawl to the jungles to get to him it's love and yet we wouldn't agree on scriptures by a hundred miles or millenniums and so forth like that on a security believer but that don't make it even a difference i am elected associate pastor to him i am so glad the power hadn't touched us yet but and i am saying that for example that we could do between two men why can't everybody do it but the problem is talking this is better more they have disagreement in scriptures but they still love each other i went to a church you know long ago i thought they would never invite me back caught a bunch a little safety woman was bobbing their hair wearing lipstick i tore the thing apart sure did i thought he wouldn't ask me back but you know what there was so much anointing of the holy spirit around the vine till an old palmer woman couldn't touch it at all you know there's an electric fence the palmer woman can't get over that fence that does shock him is the holy spirit of love it will kill him every time brothers if we need to build a fence it ought to be is it if we need fences to build it ought not to be natural fences it ought to be love fences to keep the insect out to keep the palm of him out he is the devil's number one destroyer he said no you have cancer no you have this he said come with love the world is dying he said we have got fine scholarly churches wonderful villains but we got weak pulpits something is wrong the congregation don't feel to one another like they used to there is something missing the world is looking to that what we need is a baptism of love for one another that will all men know you are my disciples then you have loved one for another oh are we in the word this morning praise god praise god from him that is where the is that's what the matter is they have lost their body love they have lost the feeling for one another what about them said here oh my god he said talk about his illumina spirit i read this sometime before what is in africa he said now watch i believe the great lesson today is to try the spirit of anything have this women of spirit i do not think that we should ever by any means ever try to judge a person by the denomination they belong to by the group they are associated with methodist baptist presbyterian pentecostal or whatever they are we should never judge the man by the denomination that he belongs to we should always judge him by the spirit he has the spirit whether he's laterine for marine inner outer norring whatever it might be we should never judge him by that but by his spirit we are to discern spirits watch now now i want to get this to the church this morning which is indeed funny nominations you are still the church of the living god and the thing i want to get to you is this we are really not divided we are stones that cuts in different forms all to the glory of god now there are so many much in this day that we live in pertinent to gifts so many people judge people by gifts that they have well i believe all these are gifts i believe we what we see is gifts they are god-given gifts but if we do not use them the right way that god intended them to be used then we can do more harm with the gifts that we that none of we didn't have gifts the other night i made a statement on the pulpit saying this i would rather see brotherly love existing among the church if we didn't have one case of divine healing we know we must know what these things are for now if a man comes and he has a great gift no matter if he belongs to our denomination or another nomination but you it doesn't matter how he dresses what you want to see is what is he trying to do with that gift what purpose he has if he's trying to take his influence and build himself a great name out of it i'll have these women of spirit enough to know that's wrong no matter how great a teacher he is how powerful he is how intellectual he is how his gift operates if he isn't trying to achieve something for the benefit of the body of christ your own spiritual desire will tell you that's wrong no matter how accurate how perfect how it is is wrong if it isn't used for the body of christ to achieve something maybe he got a great gift that he could draw people together with a great intellectual or spiritual power he could draw people together maybe he's trying to take a gift or make himself famous that he have a big name other person will look up to him as a big person that's wrong maybe he's trying to edify a certain thing here he wants everybody else to get out the picture let him and his group be in the picture that's still wrong but if he has a gift of god and he's trying to edify the body of christ then i don't care what he belongs to you are not discerning the man you are discerning the spirit the life that's in the man and that is what god told us to do not one time has he ever commissioned that he's in a man's group but we are constrained and commanded by god to discern the spirit in the man what he's trying to do what the spirit in his life is trying to lead him to and then we can find out that he's trying to lead the people not bring them up bring them together to bring the church of the living god not to one denomination but to an understanding to a fellowship to a unity of spirit that is what he's pointing to calvary that's what you want oh praise god oh blessed be the name of the lord i'll read it what he said here listen a moment i would rather have a church that knows nothing about any spiritual gift but just being so in love with each other and with christ i rather have that than every spiritual gift operated in the church now that my son had in a pentecostal group i would rather have it where there's gifts they'll feel where they're gifts they'll bring confusion whether it's gifts they can be questioned but there is love is perfect that's right and if you have perfect love you'll have perfect gifts so work with love first and that brings fellowship and fellowship bring gifts work with love love brings what fellowship if we say we have no sin we deceive ourselves the truth is not in us but if we confess us and he's faithful to amen and the blood of jesus cleanses us from all sin and we have fellowship one with another why because the same blood for you is for me isn't that right so what the church needs tonight is to know how to control these gifts for evil spirits can come in and speak just the same as good spirits can speak for satan can imitate every gift that god's got every gift he can the intimidate you must know the right and the wrong and by the fruits you're gonna know it watch whether it come to pass whether it's truth or not and that's the way of the spirit notice we are given gifts by measure christ was given the gifts without measure is that right he added without measure and christ it will be like a spoonful of water out of the ocean the chemicals in it is the same one spoon from the ocean is just the same chemical content as the ocean and he was talking that's the way it is that's the way we are when we are yielding to the spirit is the same spirit working through every gift are you talking about a woman that drinks a meridian and she died and years later they still find it pulsing on her oh pray i'll escape i'll skip that okay paul reader who perhaps preached right in his time and i could see him pulpit he said one time he and his wife were sitting at the table she wanted to do something he said there's no need to do that somehow he hurt a feeling and he thought well if a feeling is that easy hurt let them hurt he got up lay the people on the table went down to the street her custom was that she would meet him at the door kiss him goodbye and when he went out to the end of the gate he always looked back on the wave well she kissed him goodbye went out to the end of the gate looked back and she waved and said he started down the street and something began to condemn him he said what if she would die today when you're gone what if something would happen to you with that strange feeling that family of fear he got condemned he turned around run back real quick joke open the gate went in throw open the door look around he couldn't see her he heard her she was behind the door crying she said he never said a thing he just walked around there looked right in her face and kissed her again turn around went back out the gate she stand there wave again the difference of it was the last time she waved had feeling to it so the first wave was just that a wave the second wave it had feelings in it that is what we're talking about the honey that sticks the brotherly kindness that god bless you brother but if you have a chance you'll give him a little thing behind we're not talking about that kind of early kindness oh that's the way it is friends we can't put in artificial we need pentecostal fire and bloody love back in the church of the living god hallelujah you put the life of jesus christ back in the church you will stop fussing you'll be brothers and sisters you won't let your hair grow they will get up from manicures you will turn off the television programs that you ought not to be listening to and the glory of the lord shall return to zion with joy and there shall be a revival break out across the country that will put every critic to shame the powers of god will build into the church and jesus will come and manifest himself with signs and wonders what we need today oh we hope hidden home stretch just a little more again i can't cast up now right inside the gate right now hallelujah we just have two more gears to throw in there and up the hill are we gonna be there watch what beneath it is i beat him the gospel back into the church to straighten the church up to pull all the kinks of it back on the fellowship of the blood into the shekinah glory into a pentecostal experience what we need is a relationship with god till men and women that's the problem people in church too long that they think church is god if you have a relationship with god you'll treat your wife right your relationship with god empowers you to go in the kitchen and help her wash the wheels i ain't spock much even for that but i will still say it again your relationship with god will make a helper with the dishes happen with the children help her in the house and not sit down like king tut on some troll waiting to be served and i mean that brothers i really do what we need is a relationship again with god till men are willing to die out to themselves in the secret chamber with god until new life is produced until they become a new creature let a man do that if it'll cover it if he's an old coward he will go and win souls because why he become in divine relationship with god in the secret room to himself with him and god he's anointed and went in there with tears rolling on his cheek saying oh god give me the holy spirit i think if it cost me my wife my children my girlfriend whatever i am just fill me lord till i can stand in your presence and feel the shekinah glory searching over me sergeant truman oh hallelujah what you need is the holy ghost to be surging to your being we need men of god get back in the church where church ought to be association experience oh praise god a certain organization the other day because i i listen a certain organization the other day because i let another minister sit on the platform not preaching just sit down this is brother browner i said in organization the other day because i let another minister sit on the platform that didn't belong to the organization said we have drawn a line and we have drawn you out of it but i'm saying out of our circle but said i said i'm joined another one so big and take you back in again so you just can't push me out i will draw a line over the top of yours and take you right back that son of god that is christian that is minister of the gospel god stop now we are brethren we are not divided all one body we we are christians born of his spirit washington is blood we are christians we should act like christians we should behave ourselves like christians let me tell you one thing that the church is lacking today is behaving like christians that's what i've been preaching for the longest why hallelujah christian is not coming to church you have to behave like what we go wrong like dead flies no faith something is wrong hallelujah the sign official woman jesus is not fit to take the church but encounter the dogs talk about jesus she say the dogs get their crumbs we know that he said say something loyal say something real that's the way to get rid of devils he never prayed for the girl she never said one thing about her being healed he just said for this saying oh hallelujah so you could see the writing and devil's this pack up shop and they know oh my oh my oh my hallelujah musician come on please here we go hallelujah so do you believe that the holy spirit going to pour out but abandon he said now what jesus said say to this mountain you have heard what's taking place that's the ministry we enter into now we are way up the road now soon the coming of the lord jesus we have got to have rapture and faith in the church listen that will be changed in a moment and with an eye or we will not go but don't you worry it will be there it will be there and when the power of this church rises it will bring the bedroom the power of that church rises it will bring the bedroom the power of that shall rise it will bring the other bedroom and then there will be a general direction we are looking forward to it so the prophet prophesied that the power going to rise in the church oh how many believe that which is the dynamics of this church which is the virtual powerful service it has to come into the church do you believe that promise hallelujah but abandon said angel of the lord i know the next thing is to happen is the restoration of the gifts of the church and it's the hardest thing i've had to do in this pioneering work is to do this god cannot give back the gifts to the church as long as his church is divided we have got to get the church together before the gifts can come and if all of the full gospel people could come in one at one accord there would be a revival that would shape the whole world and every spiritual gift would be in the church within an hour time after it took place signs and wonders that was done by the apostle would be a minor thing to what do if we could get the change together it's got to happen it will happen oh hallelujah he said it got to happen and he prophesied he said it will happen it may be after and pass off the scene but i want to put my word in this that you might know my voicing is oh blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah hallelujah oh praise god he said they've got they have been brides brides brides but they've got to come one that not only have the mechanics but the dynamics oh hallelujah dynamics and mechanics together oh blessed be the name of the lord do you believe that praise god praise god he said there were cows in the upper room but all of a sudden the dynamics come what did they do it not only felt their spirit but it quickened their mechanics their bodies were quickened there were no more cowards they went straight into the face of the people he said you men and judea you dwell in jerusalem before the dynamics come they were just mechanics but when the holy ghost came upon them they quickened inside them oh the whole being was changed inside change they were so quick and that their tongues changed they spoke in another language they were so quick and when they lay hands on upon the sick the sick had to recover that's the quickening power that is what this promise may the lord bless you as we stand and give god some praises oh jason hallelujah oh glory glory glory glory glory oh hallelujah hallelujah oh glory to god hallelujah hallelujah oh glory glory glory thank you
