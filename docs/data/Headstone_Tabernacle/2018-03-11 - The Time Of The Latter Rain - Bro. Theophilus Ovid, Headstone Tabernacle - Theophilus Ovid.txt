marina's calling for everyone grass in the field oh praise the name of the Lord blessed be the Lord so just all the time would last on the message about a word living word a word made flesh and this is the prophet from the comforter he says now watch what is our comfort today it's when we received the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the power of the Living God living in us and that's with the word of the Living God we stand and that word made flesh dwell among us now that same word that was made flesh and dwell among us has become our flesh he is with you now but he shall be in you know that same word that that prophet spoke that same word that was made flesh that same word dwells in the church and here the catch now therefore if we don't compromise that word and we stay right with it if we don't compromise it that same word living in you will produce the same thing that it did when he was made flesh because your flesh holds it so God made a way for your flesh to hold the world remember it has to come into your walk into your flesh and your feet isn't that right and that's the reason visions can break through the song barrier that's the reason vision can break through the sound barrier the seer the Lord because it's a word coming forth from a spirit amen so here we go now are you ready so this is a vision that the prophet had in the early years so we starting with official this morning this is a vision two years later I've been praying in a cave where I would go to pray got a dusty in a cave one afternoon I walked out lead my Bible on a log on the wind blew that opened the Hebrews a sick chapter which said that in the last days how it would be if we fell away from the truth and renew ourselves again unto repentance there was no more sacrifice for sin how that falls and T cells which were 9 to rejection whose energy be burned but the rain commits upon the earth to water it to dress it and Torn's anticipable rejected but the wheat would be gathered and I thought well it just had the wind blow that open well I'll lay the Bible down again and I thought well no and here come the wind and blew it open it happened three times seems please I said it strange and I raised up and thought Lord why would you open the Bible for me to read that when I get down to where Torn's and thistles which is nigh on the rejection whose nsab burnt I thought why would you open that to me there and as I look across the vision broke now these visions come without pull in any gear it's just God I looked now don't miss any words now just listen carefully I looked and seen an earth that was turning in front of me and it was all discs up I guess that is like when it have like to take a fork and fork it up like us till it up then this Cup there was a man dressed in white when the wrong showing wheat and after he went around the curvature of the earth Arrancar my man look horrible he was just in black he was trying weed seeds over it the board come up together when they did the booth was thirsty because a rain was needed boot with this tea because Irene was needed each one looked like prayin with his little head bent over Lord send rain send her in know this is the vision and create clouds come up and the rain fell upon both of them and when it did the little we jump up and begin to say praise the Lord praise the Lord a little we'd jump right at the same time and more praise the Lord praise a lot and then the vision was interpreted the rain falls on the just and the unjust the same spirit can fall in a meeting and everyone with Joyce and it hypocrites Christians all together exactly right but what is it by their fruits the unknown that's the only way it can never be known then you see how since Wild Oats while wheat and grain sometimes impersonates genuine domestic great so close that it would deceive the very elect 'add I think we are living in a timely age that these things should be preached on and talked about so close in the last days that he could not depend upon us sit in church a separate them same Methodists or Baptists or Pentecost some so he sends his angels to separate them an angel is coming to bring the separation between right and wrong and no one can do that but the angel of the Lord and he is the one that's gonna tell which is right and which is wrong God sent he sent his angels at the last times not angels don't you hear but angels at the last time and an angel is actually a messenger notice he said the shooters or world and also what the seed was so you have to identify this is a vision yet no he's gonna identify the shore and what the seed is because you have to know what the seed is and you're gonna know what seed is coming inside of you and what seed you already got oh praise Him a lot isn't that wonderful no the saw was he the Son of God who sent for when forth sowing seed the enemy came behind him was the devil and sowed the seed of discrepancy behind the right seed no he said the seed is the word of God and Jesus enters in a place the word is a seed and every seed will bring forth of its kind now if the Christian the cheerin of the God has become the seed of God so you have to become God's seed like Noor was like Moses was like Abraham was you yourself have become God seeded on the earth hallelujah now if the churn of God has become the seed of God there must be the Word of God the word manifested in the age of living in so God gave his promise at the beginning and each it had its seed its time and its promises when Noah came on the scene he was a seed of God for that age the Word of God when Moses come he couldn't combat Knaus message it wouldn't work he was the seed of God at that time when Christ come he could not combat nor on Moses age message isn't that right now we have left you Luther's aged Wesleyan Methodist age Pentecostal age each age has given my promise of the world and the people of that age that manifests not porcfest not not not not a doofus that manifests this the promise word is the seed of that age in other words the manifestation will be the interpretation you'll have to wonder about it it's being manifested or do you believe that now Island is happen under a church and who Church and watcher I'm gonna doing that you know this has to do with the word promised being manifested because when Jesus came is that Pharisees in that Sadducees a larger audience it had all kind of types of churches but he came according to promise all glory to God and the bride will come according to promise he promised a revival he promised a super church he promised the people that know their God shall be strong so if you're weak you have to know your God it means you have to come forward not to get to know who you bought is your blood bigger than your problem so it also coming with a heavy shoulder like that your God bigger than your situation just a joke on me Eddy press you only kept that way before you don't know your God but your God open the Red Sea you're gonna open the blinds I your God raise the dead your God heals the sick you're bored pastor that's your God [Music] your boat is away mate huh that's your God I don't know what Nordic God your God he's a koala mommies he's a court of war Oh hallelujah praise God hey man so jesus said they are the children of the kingdom the manifestation of the Holy Spirit operating to his children is the seed of the kingdom at that age not somebody in this group or somebody in that group or somebody said a seed no he said he can try it he qualified the manifestation of the Holy Spirit operate him in those children is the seed of the kingdom of God so Satan sowed discord or the seed of discrepancy he loves discord amen he was the one guilty of doing this horrible thing and Satan sword is see from the beginning when God places for his harvest of humans upon the earth Adam of course not had another the truth and right and wrong but he has never come to that yet but we find out God give his children his word for the defense we have no other defense than the Word of God that is our defense there's no bomb shelter there is no hiding place there is no Arizona or California or they were into America there is no defense but the Word of God the Word of God is your defense and it will defeat the devil anyplace anytime anywhere under any condition the word can never be defeated it is so powerful that Jesus said heaven and earth will pass away but my word that never pass away could we get my shot for the world and every word is a seed are a yummy season he's our only defense being in him we are safe Jesus was so confident of the prophetic utterance from the pivot smote I shall not suffer my Holy One see corruption David spoke that out jesus knew the scripture so he know he half the brains within three days he was so confident of the prophetic creative word that was spoken to the Prophet David he said destroy this body I mean three days I will raise it up myself Laurie Jesus wasn't imagining anything he wasn't hope ain't gonna happen he know cordial I see you that was not David that was the Spirit of God coming up on David ringing prophetic creative utterance [Applause] and if that spirit come upon me today and speaks to you it can't feel because pluck a line or give the Lord ahsoka No [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah yes yes yes no be seated we men know this harvest time at the beginning when God saw a seed upon the earth and give it into his hands of his children his family to keep that world that was the offense/defense to keep the world here come the enemy broke the barrier by sowing a seed of discrepancy contrary to the Word of God God told him you can eat of every tree in the garden but the trees in the midst don't touch that because they dare you eat that day you die Satan came to the serpent and asks what did God say the cold blood wasn't talking to him so you have to invite information and when Eve said because her husband was out to work and when the Eve where God say we could either vote achieve a dead tree in the midst we shall show you that he said you shall not surely die because God knows you could be wise you'll be very intelligent until I could get a boost you got big head it's like you're smoking grass you get high head you would even know put an evil God knows that don't bother with him and she fell with that and then given a husband piece of it later and he fell true but she was deceived because she thought she was right the husband wasn't received he went with her and you know he's wrong because you know what God said it's not right that's why caught on the break the curse and that's why cavalry come to break the curse of sin and death so you have to study about cellnet no more praise God you can go free isn't that right and all they had was a few words to stay behind but they were supposed to stay behind that but no that's was the first bride that was Eve but this bride is not staying behind the wagon all she is going to become the world doctors why doctors why she'll be invincible [Applause] you know what invincible means cannot be defeated listen listen forget your bills forget supreme forget the emotional problems forget your human spirit forget all of that just ride with me with the word just do like I believe up a mortgage to pee pee like a rock you like it there's not tomorrow if only half right now himbecile to ensure CS I'm getting knuckle punch this bride is not standing behind a wooden on this right will become the word the word itself she will be the word manifester she will be the Word made flesh she will be the living word the last time the devil and talk to this was when he met Jesus is when he met the Prophet know you're gonna need the bread he has enough yet because the rain is fixin to fall I'm in real in I mean the lottery you may be seasoned according to the vision we read they will come to our when the cry will be sent us green because what we have no can be the tangible it will take a power it will take a ring to activate or manifest to see that's already in you we often say I won't talk about the cell phone you could buy a cell phone it could be the latest the greatest but if it's not activated all you have is an expensive piece of I don't know paperweight you might as well put it on on different recipe races on a piece of paper it can make the calls you can show people previous this machine emoji fastest speed the professor and hold the screen is and what not it can make Nepal it's a dead phone because that activated but one size what is activated with a call and you can receive calls and when your phone when your seed is activated youtl mayor calls and receive calls [Applause] then you could ask what you will and it shall be given unto you Oh give the Lord a show or we're in the wind this morning hallelujah hallelujah so Court is about to activate some sons and some daughters and that'll get the devil hell or chlorine Oh God praising him alone the devil I see nothing yet the Bible said the Bible prophesy the people that know their God shall be strong and do great exploits not just exploits but great exploits I'm looking there today I'm looking at the stat now even a backup cancer we gonna bus upsetness we gonna back up diseases today it's time for a lottery [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah glory glory glory hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory to God listen you will be seated according to the vision boats weed and wheat begin to get thirsty but the clothes game hallelujah and the clothes have already come seven angels come from eternity and form a crow that clone is already here that prorate bring rain rain is coming I can guarantee you that that's dusty Lord I have no doubt in my heart I am NOT talking my mind that's according to vision that's according to prophecy [Applause] you let me season you know what everyone represent your hopes your joy your Jubilee all what you look forward for all what you hire your heart all what you want materialize the rainbow ginger set because every seed have to bring forth after its kind or glory the corners out the right seed [Applause] the same Holy Spirit annoys the church that give them a deserve and save souls not give them power to perform miracles it falls under just on the unjust on the same as the just the very same spirit you can't make it another way and understand Matthew 24:24 - arise false Christ's force anointed ones anointed with the genuine thing but before stuff it or teaches of it that's why I could know somebody's on the wood or not because it has to reflect back in what was on the tape what the Prophet said because he's the template that's the prom line prom night no twist for nobody when they build up a plumb line panelists stand up so on straights truth if you believe in Superman quite soon you can take it on - boo so go so go so you're gonna fit the problem that you're been your

chosen for you in eternity because we found you he called he had to phone you you to call you yet the team's about you to put you on the earth so you put you in flesh and you by class the word sonography preach the word you could connect back to where you come from because the world is your expression but what is o'clock Express to the part that you are is expressed like the word has been preached the word you yeah your name maybe see them do a lot for everybody to understand why you're shocked and why your praise God they'll never understand customers you be intellectually formally

chicken chicken Eagle hats and among chickens chickens filled as a big brother bigger brother with some sequela Confederates and so on and all the eager could seize them some some some corn catchin kind of coming on their own he never saw anybody like himself mother you go fighting wrongly I mean bigger scream he's about like that that's something like what up what's a feeling for unison language it's gonna be my son you you are one of us somebody can fly is it jump to the barnyard pause let us start somewhere all these years of stretching stretching stretching but today we should jump in a barnyard boss [Applause] maybe season and now you go jump anybody mommy yeah what next he said son just flap it you couldn't flap it on your own they could scratch for corn on the ground just flap them to wings one left want me right I said right - yes it was always there son you never was a chicken son you always a evil [Applause] maybe season continued now the Word of God within the Bible is as good to us and every promise has the same power of creation behind it that is God's Word did at beginning if we believe it to be the Word of God it depends on where the seed falls if it falls into growing that can create a moisture and nourishment around the promise of God it will bring forth every promise the Bible me that is why we strongly emphasize worship here I'm praising God because Balram says the praising and worshiping is decrease in water atmosphere for the sea to germinate and grew and so on either and he type it with Rebecca Elijah lilius asked the Lord the damsel that watered my camel and give me water let her be the one raisa okay everybody one husband but you see the other a certain behavior so Eli Lilly is there was looking for a certain behavior he wasn't looking for look you look every kind of clothes and clothes he wearing you were looking for behavior he asked sports-specific let the dams and that will give me water and water my camels if you know what come and have a big hump I'd almost guarantee this whole two and a half buckets pull camel nice custody children see that but has he not knowledge - a technique that she's a lot of water - water cover all them sisters by some snobbish notion one who is that man the man who died - I'm a nice man behind that man you know that man bein a man Isaac so watch Rebecca come she said to see can I water for you when you come Rebecca can think more no Isaac she's not thinking about that she sees somebody does she want the self [Music] in half and have no um I like holy look Isaac wasn't there for him and like how we look the blood I take him he's not there for your blood to take him or not ethically it's a Sylvan was sent out and Eli and Rebecca know nothing about that so here what the brown said the same camera she watered and the same camera ticket Isaac I mean say the same word yeah that you water with your praises but take it to the Holy Ghost [Applause] so that's why I know if you're not prison and worshiping God us stature coming right yet so you don't know whether it was the Isaac or Gloria of course if you want to see Isaac start a camera right by giving the camera some good water because the camera represent the word which is a power to take it away after go but that word need water sadness area [Applause] maybe season prophecy there's some spoke original seed prophecy ah you enjoying the Lord this morning you enjoying the world this morning you in the spirit this morning listen to the prophecy remember there will be a denominational put together and pretty soon it will be terrific they will bring themselves together into this Federation of churches and this kind of a church will be put out of operation as far as they know it's at that time that Jesus will appear and he will show which is by languages not remember Christian friends I'm a man I can make mistakes but God being God cannot make a mistake all the words that's been written must be fulfilled jesus said so so we got things in the scripture that must fulfill and this is one of them this boycott is to come but before this worker can come of the mocking of the beasts here we go there has to be a seat soon forgot to take our church out of it before the master of the beasts before the boy could come there has to be a seed shown to take the church out Oh Florina caught so what'd you come here for to get seed [Applause] what's the secret the work is in the brain deafening the bride concealing her she is pregnant with God all right let's go [Music] the shock has to leave the seed to get the seed in the presence of the Sun so it can be ripened rightly so we know the shock come like the Pentecostals was like a shell over the seed and when it's green the shock is green and the seed is dream but then here comes the Sun and when the Sun set the heat and trials and tests and tribulation and pressure people do like that you know pressure come to Jesus everything will be all right come to Jesus tool best to be stress is that right not just a sign on pipoca ignore that all that come to court must suffer persecution don't call me that too blessed to be stressed foolishness that not anything memorize this man figured I want to comfort this day self so after the pressure comes downside of heat the shock after dry and pull away for the sea to get right me so when he sucked shot drying under the Sun its ripening seed she becomes more mature right ok so then in the revelation is the shock was only a carrier of the green all the plant life ok so I plant a seed alpha church it shoot up a blade stalk tassel and it come back to original again to the top all this promoted life is as carriers it's a carrier of the life but all the life is got up in the seed when it come back in the seed the bride or the church or the elect have original seed with the life locked up in it all that Syrian true is the gate and then be buried because it cannot bury a green seed so that's why going to harvest you into rightness or glory to God as you can see the need to die out break out and reproduce the green Oh hallelujah furtive Adam says Squatch remember there's no more seed promise to a woman after Mary so Mary had to see but she was like shocked the seed was Christ in Mary isn't that right there's no money nominations promised after Pentecost it's the rapture and the bride coming forth from here the seed the wood will manifest again okay here we go notice how close it is Matthew 24:24 the two spirits in the last days the church spirit of the church people it's a spirit now and the bride spirit of the bride people would be so close together that we see the very latest possible so the chest of aspirational do let them tire squat inside a gig and I was the bright spirit with the worship God because jesus said the overcome and the true worshipers will worship the father in spirit and in truth just members yet hinder you untied upset you but you're the person go remember weed and wheat growing together you know you can't separate them in oh now I carry bleak all the ways you can't reach if you can't speak that because I don't know who is who the Bible said leave them alone until time I harvest what glory to God so therefore Yaga rest within the stalk remember God spoke to Abraham about Sarah bringing her child she adopted pass it on to Hagar then he got and after tree woman he got Sarah and Mary and then here come the manchild he said but Pentecost represent a Mary Mary the last teach of it she was not the seed yet the life of the seed was in her but it had matured yet it had matured so when they like mature they have to pretty shotgun hold it no more shock filter you want to ban you stay there boy I stated nine months up coming out Luther when the hospital's first word justly by fate Wesley told sonification second definite worker is Pentecost till wood restoration of the gifts but the entire seed has to come forth and that is what William Branham came because the only apart so he came with the full seed justification was part son sectionals part penny kostas was part but where abraham came with the full seed the entire word the message came to that elijah is not right the entire seed has to come forward how did it nominated one word another word another word here we go but there's got to be something that cannot be denominated are you ready do you want to know what it is something that cannot be denominated it's the entirety of the life you cannot denominate the life [Applause] you can't miss the wrong words but you can't fool around their life like you put concrete underground the plant was discord aside and come up got killed in life so there's got to be some that can't be dominated is the entirety of the life that Sandhya has to produce itself again on a bride are you hearing what I'm saying okay the Bible's to be finished the Gentile dissipation is disposition is to be finished which the church is of course when this anointed messenger arrives of course he will plant the seed of the entire Bible so whatever on plant the seed of the entire the entire Bible so he plant the permit because the permit is a Bible that's the total see deal Oh hallelujah praise God who is the son of man the shore what is the seed the entire Bible we're not supposed to go in you let's continue to teach book this messenger Malachi for revision 10-7 is going to do two things one a corner Malachi for he retained a hostile return to the father's true he revealed a Michelin seven thunders in revision ten which are the revelations contained in the seven seals it will be teased divinely revealed mystery truths that will literally turn the hostile return back to the father's so butter brown came to reveal the thunders to the hospital Sharon back to the fathers from the Seventh Seal he said now at the end D and the end time seal when it starts seventh seal and time see you when it starts will be a total secret remember aeration ten at the end of the seven angels message we are the end time the opening of the seventh seal seventh seal announces or Sheridan begin time what time is that going to run out so every single day we are running outta time think about that now alone age is picking up on you tangle alone then in the guide he said at the finishing of the seventh season when it starts stops in silence it starts as a secret but I had the finish of the Seventh Seal the mystery of God should be finished in who've audience what he is how we live his nature you supposed to be all the way up there by that time to bring us into the full statue of the son the daughters of God at the finishing we can't be lacking we have to be climbing that ladder there isn't that right so watch the light that was in this talk from the masterpiece went on to make another justification merely for sonification sound occasionally for the patent Holy Ghost and the baptism the Holy Ghost made a way for the Holy Ghost itself to come down in perfection and back to the word again to manifest itself oh god what the baptism in a way for the Holy Ghost itself to component perfection back to the word again to manifest itself or do you believe that this morning Oh hallelujah praise God praise God look at those patriarch Abraham Isaac Jacob and Joseph here I'm calling Isaac election Abraham election Isaac

prophecy that come to bring on the wind making it four stitches I will restore say the Lord justification brought back the pulp sonification brought back the back doctrine of holiness what brought back the least Pentecostals rejoicing and clapping their hands but what was the fort the fort was the would mean flesh the word hallelujah supporter Branham represented that the Word made flesh the word Sheol the perfection the capstone coming to catch a ride Oh glory to God and you will be magnetized to that headstone isn't that right what's the fourth the Word made flesh fruits of the proof of

not the war matters vengeance out of here your calling is for perfection I am to be perfect the Lord shall perfect that which concern at me Oh give the Lord a shout that's the word Oh maybe season Luke 8:11 2:15 Jesus speaking now the parable is this the seed is the word of God do it by the wayside I did it here then commit the devil and take it away the word out of their hearts at least they should believe and be saved they on the rock a day which when they hear receive the word with joy these have no root for what for which for why believe in time of temptation following David fell among thorns a day which when they have heard go forth and a choked with cares and riches and pleasures of life and bring no fruit to perfection but that on good ground are they which in an honest and good heart haven't heard a word keep it and bring forth fruit with patience that's Luke description Matthew description and 13 treaty 11 says this and he spake many things unto them in parables saying behold I saw and for the snow when he sowed some seeds fell by the wayside the falls came and Evod him up some fell upon stony places where they had not much as 4:20 sprung up because they had no deepness of earth when the Sun was up they were scorched because they had no root they withered away some fell among thorns and the thorns sprung up choked them others fell into good ground brought forth fruit some one hundredfold some sixtyfold and some thirtyfold who are in stir hear let him hear Cypress came and said unto Him wise because I want troubles because it's given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven but to them it is not given so the parable of the saw pictures the whole cost for this age isn't that right it shows the Word of God in different hearts and the results that follow and perfection cannot come by the ones that fall on rocky grounds by the one that fallen through a side by the one that fallen stony or the one that fell in thorns it can only come from a heart good wrong put on your bigger amen so now we have the world is perfect know we coordinate is something that's not in the heart the word is the seed the son of man is the soul but let's deal with the heart now because what Jesus dealing with you know is for heart conditions Rocky's wayside hearts stony hearts Tony hearts and good hearts we sigh groan stony ground Tony grown and good
