human element and spirit of man and intelligence and green matter of work but Lord we are promised that the mind of Christ will drop down the intelligence that we can know what to do with your word speak to us Lord and Inspire us tonight draw us closer to you that we were dashing to the blessings of God and secured all our hearts till we are filled with the true baptism of the Holy Ghost granted law this is promised and we believe it and we expected it and Jason we ask it now as we approach your word tonight blessed interpret your heart and confirm your word with signs following and Jesus we ask it amen God bless you and welcome welcome to the house of God tonight and they have your bibles are likely to the two portion of scriptures Acts chapter 2 1 4 1 to 4 and we want to read from Acts chapter 4 verse 7 to 31 to 90 but one reader tonight Acts chapter 2. I can't remember using these two scriptures like this but we see what the Lord will do um Acts chapter okay something okay and when the day of Pentecost is fully come they were all with one Accord in one place and suddenly there came a song from heaven after the Russian Mighty Wind it fill all the house where they would sit in and they appeared unto them cloven tongues like as a fire it sat upon each of them and they were all they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit give them utterance and from Acts chapter 4 and this is after the lame man the crippleman was healed and everybody knew it was crippled they know it was a part of God and Acts chapter 4 verse 7 they say and and when they had set them in the midst they asked by what power or by what name have you done this then Peter filled with the Holy Ghost said unto them he rulers of people now now this here give an emphasis of the feeling of the Holy Ghost not just Peter talking and Peter feeding talkish and if he'll just say something this is Peter this is emphasis filled with the Holy Ghost said unto them ye rulers of the people and Elders of Israel if we this day be examined of the good deed done to the important Man by what means he's made whole be it known unto all unto you all unto all the people of Israel that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth whom he crucified whom God has raised from the dead even by him that this man standing here before you whole this is the stone which was set at not of you build it which has become the head of the corner neither is there any salvation and any other for there is none other name under him give him among men whereby we must be saved and when they saw the boldness of Peter and John and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men they marveled they took knowledge of them that they have been with Jesus and beholding the man which was healed standing with them they could say nothing against it but when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council they conferred among themselves saying what shall we do to these men for indeed a neutral Miracle had been done by them is Manifest to all them that dwell in Jerusalem and be kind of denied but that it spread no further among the people let us straightly threaten them that they speak henceforth to no man in this name and they call them commanded them not to speak at all or teach in the name of Jesus but Peter and John answered and said unto them whether it be right and the sight of God to hearken unto you more than under God jaji for we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard so when they are further attracting them they let them go finding nothing how they might punish them because of the people for all men Glory fight God for that which was done for the man was above 40 years old on whom this miracle of healing was showed and being let go they went to their own company and reported all that the chief priests and the elders said unto them and when they had heard that they lifted up their voice to God with one Accord and said Lord Thou Art God which has made Heaven hurt and the Sea and all that is in them is who by the mouth of thy servant David have said why did hidden reach and the people imagine a vain thing the kings of the earth stood up and the rulers were gathered together against the Lord and against the Christ for our truth against thy holy Child Jesus whom thou has anointed both Herod Pontius Pilate with the Gentiles and the people of Israel were gathered together for to do whatsoever thy hand that I counsel determine before to be done and no Lord behold the threatenants and Grant unto thy servants that with all boldness they may speak Thy Word by stretching 14 hand to heal and that signs and wonders may be done by the name of thy holy Child Jesus and when they had prayed the place was shaken where they will assemble together and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and they speak the word of God with boldness father we thank you for your word tonight and Lord these are just ridden it is inspiring father and this is what is Promised Lord this is what you send a prophet to do to turn our hearts back to the faith of the fathers with the same Holy Ghost with the same power with the same anointing with the same feeling of the spirit father come on tonight in a special way and fill us with your spirit fill us with your power Lord they will fill in the upper room in Acts 2 but here in Acts 4 they were filled all over again they were refilled with the Holy Ghost and you said the Dynamics of this church will be a refilling of the Holy Ghost that we have worked in a small measure commonly fill us tonight with your presence refill using that with your power in Jesus amen you would be seated praise God revealed the presence of God here tonight that's the most important man you may be seated among us tonight thank you Lord Jesus hallelujah praise God you love him tonight we'll have a title only the Holy Ghost filled bride will be in the rapture that's the title night only the Holy Ghost filled bride will be in the Rapture nobody else praise God hallelujah do you believe that amen amen acts 9 and this is um Soul yet breathing out threatens and and Slaughter against the Disciples of the Lord went into the high priest and desired of him led us to Damascus to the synagogues if he be found any in this way whether there be men or women that he might bong them in Jerusalem so Saul was anointed he was inspired isn't that right to arrest Christians who was following Jesus and as the journey he came near and suddenly I shine a wrong about him a light from heaven and he fell to the Earth and heard a voice saying unto him Saul Saul Why perseveres without me and he said who are thou Lord and the Lord said I am Jesus whom though persecutes it is hard for thee to kick against the bricks and he trembling and astonished said Lord what will thou have me to do oh this is when God ready for a seed the pillar Fire come down to knock Saul all his high horses he said Lord what will you want me to do and the Lord said to them arrives going to the city it shall be told thee what thou must do he could have tell them straight away but he said go in the city it shall be totally went to what must do and the men with journey with him stood speechless hearing a voice and seeing a man and Saul arose from the earth and when his eyes are open he saw no man but they led him by the hand and brought him into Damascus and he was there three days without sight neither eat nor drink and there was a certain disciple in the master's name anas and to him said the Lord in a vision and I asked he said behold I'm here Lord and the Lord said arise go into the street called Street and inquire in the house of Judas for one called soul of taskless for behold he prayed o Give the Lord some praise when the pressure come upon you you better find yourself praying praise glorify yourself relaxing and taking it easy on the stress the best thing to do is to rock into prayer oh give the Lord a praise Hallelujah God tell Saul Hallelujah going to the city you'll be told what to do this is God working on both sides then go tell anayas then go and acquire that house you're gonna find us all there Oh Glory to God hallelujah is that right amen and the Lord said arise go in the street he goes straight the street called straight and inquiring the house of Judas for one called soul of dancers be holy prayed and had seen in a vision a man named a nurse coming in and putting his hands on him that he might receive his sight then anas answered Lord I have heard by many of this man how much evil he had done to thy sins at Jerusalem so there's another easy thing they know that he got talking you know but this man is an evil man there's a wicked man called Saul but this man gonna be changed to Paul so don't look at people's wickedness you have to study the predestination of God or give the Lord some Praises Hallelujah so God talking to this prophet and an ass and he's telling God I know this man I hear about this man he said what he even done to the Saints of Jerusalem but here he had Authority from the chief priests to bind all the call upon 19 but the Lord said unto him go thy way for he is a chosen vessel unto me to bear my name before the Gentiles and Kings and the children of Israel but I will show him how the great things he must suffer for my name's sake oh are you ready tonight are you ready tonight ananias went his way and entered in the house and putting his hands on him said brother Saul Brothers all not Mr Saul brother Saul the Lord even Jesus had appeared unto thee in the way that thou came as accept me that doubt might receive thy sight and be filled with the Holy Ghost Oh Glory to God then you got that tonight there's two things he got was sent to do opens all eyes and that he be filled with the Holy Ghost just yes three days ago he riding hard after Christian but when anas filling with him but receiving he was filled somebody shall not fill still with the Holy Ghost and that's the same promise you have tonight that you're gonna be filled with the Holy Ghost or glory to God you'll be a man of God follow the Holy Ghost a woman of God follow the Holy Ghost hallelujah praise God praise God so let's go only the holy ghost film goes in the Rapture not people who believe brother Branham that's a lie that's not the truth the bride is going to be called of the church the Hall of the message the church like how God called out of Egypt and there's a people for the promised land Hallelujah we call it Promised Land people two million people came out but he had a bunch among them that is Promised Land people where thousands come out in this message with books and tips but out of that thousands of people there's a bright bunch the Holy Ghost Oh Glory to God is not right question question and answers will only those who have the baptism of the Holy Ghost be in the Rapture of the church or will all believers be indicated we ain't got time to justify that but brother only the Holy Ghost Bride will be in the rapture others won't be lost only what the Holy Ghost Bride not the knowledgeable bride not the informed bride not the bride who listened to the most books and tapes Holy Ghost bride do you get that man oh let's go look who is going to judge the Earth Saints Daniel said I saw him come to the ancient of time and he came with Ten Thousand Times Ten Thousand of his sins is that right the Rapture the Jews had gone on then come down and the Judgment was set and the books are open is that right and another book was opened which was The Book of Life the Sanctified believer that that that hadn't received the Holy Ghost let me read it again books are open and another book was open The Book of Life and the prophet is interpreting that book that book is not unbelievers that book is the Sanctified believer I said go to get it in this message that haven't received the Holy Ghost didn't Jesus teach that ten virgins went out to meet the bridegroom and all of them were virgins pure holy they went to sleep and didn't get the Holy Ghost and these got the Holy Ghost had all in their lamp two virgins all in the message some getting Holy Ghost some they just believe him all right at all in the lamp and when the pride goon come the voice shouting they let us go and give us some of your oil he said go to them that buy and the words said pray up and get it now so if if the foolish versions was exalted to prayer and go get it what we must be doing now yeah get your oil you gotta be serious about your oil and I trust them that this message inspire you to get desperate to get to your oil Oh Glory to God go and buy pray up and get it now but they couldn't and while they were gone The Virgins went into the wedding supper and they were casting out of Darkness willing nothing of teeth then he said to you woman that lay a button a nice piece of goods and you take and lay a pattern just the way that you want to cut it and when you cut it that's up to you but you take the goods and you make your garment out of it and the rest of it is used it's just as good as good as the rest of it but by election you have to choose then he says God here we go has promised that we are going in the Rapture by election so I don't care somebody's a prostitute last night if that person is elected they come in to be filled with the Holy Ghost and they go in the rapture I look at this drinking for the whole year or years drunk but they have to come true whatever process they have to come through they have to come true to be filled with the Holy Ghost I don't care what they think about them what what the history is about that's why history is irrelevant okay the Lord I shout if you're counting on soul and history you'd never believe he was a vessel chosen of God that's why don't put nobody in concrete don't fix nobody and fix this one and say this one cut off this one is shock and this one's not gonna make it and when the bride wasn't right then there's a Liars anybody want to say when he break there is lying that I'm not lying Tom speaking Oh Glory they are only the Holy Ghost fell oh kept the Lord I shout no pass I can say bride no bride bride no bride not bright no bride no bride no pass I could do that nobody if you authority to do that election is of god sovereignty is of God he said I will raise a boy I want to raise up I will choose who I want to choose Jacob I love he so I hate or give the Lord a praise offering tonight I feel excited about him tonight because he's sovereign if I could fill you tonight come on now you can be filled tonight could be your night to be filled and refilled but the Holy Ghost even here in church and even here listen online okay the Lord some Praises it has nothing to do with your past Hallelujah it have to do with who he found you he called who he called he justified and we justify he already glorified hallelujah praise God amen amen God has promised that we are going in a Rapture by election and the Bible said and the rest of the Dead live not for one thousand years so you will not be lost but the Holy Ghost feel right there we go now we get this person from we'll go in the Rapture the rest of them will come to the Judgment o praise God hallelujah those those who have their names written lambook of life but refuse not just those who are good people they certainly missed the first resurrection the Bible said the rest of the Dead live not until a thousand years will finish is that right that is Doge here we go who had their names written in the lamb book of life but refused the baptism of the Holy Ghost just the elect goes in at that time the elect takes the millennium brother what type of people should we be I want to live to the Millennium let us lay aside every weight and they send us so easily beset us if the fellow says something wrong or does something this way pray for him keep moving on let your one alternative be set towards God if nobody else makes it you make it if nobody else go make it you make it for there's going to be an elect who is going to live to the Millennium age and will go in and outward Christ for a thousand years and then they shall go into Glory with him and return again oh my hallelujah praise God when the Great king and queen comes on for the judgment and the white Throne judgment set the books are open and there stands the redeemed the Holy Ghost born Church of the Living God standing there in the beauty to judge the Books open judgment was set and every man was judged thus that was The Sinner but another

workers right we are living in the day of the restoration of the powers of God that's what they believe in it we live in a day of what the restoration of the power of God not restoration of books and

holy ghost that they picked that they did back there in the beginning what for what for I'm still reading to bring back the power and the resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ same signs and wonders [Applause] notice to share the ministry before disciples receive the Holy Ghost he give them power that was an anointing the castle devil so he was sicken and preach on different things anointing upon them it wasn't in them it was a point upon them that is why when brother Branham spoke about the FIFA Ministry he said the pillar of fire not above them not in front them not behind them but in them what is he saying he said it could be above and not in it could be in front and not in it could be hanged and not in it could be by the side and not in and they take pictures and put on Instagram it's still logged in outside with lights seem to do with lights he says has to be in then that's an adoption feeling the pillar fire [Music] do you see that yet you guys see that your dad can't be hidden in silence he said he will literally make known among men it will speak for itself Oh Glory to God do you see it you don't feel no flag you have to put no announcement you have to print no papers you

hope of glory to me I amen inside of here tonight [Applause] [Music] Glory let our Gentile workers the war stopped World War One World War II but they tried to make up the tree he can't do it yet Gotta Wait I had to go and let them fight up all right what is it the wars are struggling here struggling near struggling they're struggling their why your atomic bombs and everything are being built up but they can't do it they can't do it until the Jews gets a visitation of the baptism of the Holy Ghost so I don't care what Elijah and Moses are preacher them when they finish preach they have to be filled what can we started tonight whatever machine they're revealing whatever Trump whatever Revelation whatever trumpet they blowing whether everybody sacrifice doesn't matter at the end of the day fire to fall I'm still 144 000 and I heard the number of them that was healed and it was 144 000 and if he can hear the number of the two that were sealed what about that gentle Pride I saw another angel coming from the East having the seed of the Living God or glory to God that angel of the right among the Gentiles before equal to the Jews or give the Lord some presents tonight oh glory to God hold it until we seal the service not the bride the Gentiles was never servants praise God we are sons and daughters that means the bride get the Syrian first is that right damn 144 000 will

will cease the atomic bombs will explode and take the world and the gentle bride will be wrapped it up to stand there in the presence of God oh glory to God hallelujah praise God we give the Lord some Praises it's just a message of the hour Hallelujah and the people today that are laughing at the speaking in tongues that are laughing at Divine Healing laughing at prophecy they are laughing at the manifestation of the spirit and the same spirit that dominated the Jews back there that blessing the Holy Ghost back there and died on the divine judgment this United States is belonged for divine judgment under the power of the Holy Ghost they have condemned they made fun and turn out and call us holy rollers and everything else but he always here when God report his Divine judgment Oh Glory to God one sin God will not forgive it's the blaspheme the Holy Ghost Oh Glory to God then he said he only saved place there is today is in Christ Jesus if you're not impressed till you get in those that are in Christ Jesus will God bring with him without the seed of God and if you have any question what the seed of God is he said it here which is the baptism of the Holy Ghost confessional church is a mark of the beast that's not saying the Lord so the seed of God is the baptism of the Holy Ghost he said come on from among it my people be separated oh he said oh why Why Can't This Brown Tabernacle come out of our wrinkle I want to know a few people around here believe this gospel it's been preached you have seen it signs and wonders confirmed everything the Lord has spoke has come to pass then what's the matter wrong here when I hear these contentions among you when I hear their strife I want to see why this church can be carried away in the power of God and the baptism of the Holy Ghost with signs and wonders what's the matter your pastor believe it you believe it so what's wrong here there is something wrong this should be a lighthouse of the world there should be a place where the powers of God and weeping and crying and seeking God ought to be going on day and night why can't we have it this was the prophet from before his own church so we we must have a less burden Oh Glory to God we must want the power of God crying sign weeping right here in this Tabernacle not people coming and saying I'm with a book to take notes taking notes at home come here to worship come and take it in the spirit come in the Creator atmosphere when they were praying they said Lord hear their threatenings hear what they're trying to do us all they're trying to do is another and why they were praying the place began to shake Oh Glory to God and they will save it with the Holy Ghost oh why we can't bring back that oh Chloe pray till the place begin to shake Oh Glory to God pray pray till your hearts begin to shake till your sons in your heart begin to shake till the family begin to shake not because where you tell them what you're praying I don't know choices Hallelujah praise God hello Branham Michigan he's a believer all the Jews have to be circumcised so you could say how about you yes but Moses said take a lamb kill it and put it blood there's many man fundamental man that can take this Bible and say I'm a Believer on Jesus said by faith we are saved and I'm a Believer but the baptism of the Holy Ghost is nonsense then the Talk's not applied a circumcised Jews said I'm a Jew why do I have to go there and act like that other bunch of fanatics Moses standing up and down the street saying the evening message is here shall come to pass at the end of 14 days You Shall Gather the congregation together kill the lamb whole Congregation of Israel shall kill it put their hands upon it identify himself with it and the blood shall be struck upon the post seven Thunders Exclusive by promise ministers don't want to preach it but he had to put your hand on it to be identified with it because seven tunnels get Faith seven times gathered up right together seven others should have about how to repair Oh Glory they've got seven times a bright revive but now I'm only with church members I have the bride strictly bite and the bride is going to the

days when that Spurs hit them you see Saul Saul was writing for the Christians but Saul was an elect and when that fire hit him so people who are down Lord You See Fire I hate them yet what can the Lord has shout Nora getting excited fire ahead and yet when fire hit them in this message you go see them come out they were coming from the East they were coming from the West they go coming from the

Mysteries is that what kind of Mighty piece of any Pulpit it will take the power of God Give the Lord I shout Amen brother kangly but the brand was very specific he said this being talking about the virtues when it's completed is the servant of God in the Church of God that's golden Rapture what he also said if that is not completed that's a silver stain with the Saints in a tribulation this is serious [Applause] this is that serious it's specific is that maybe yeah we're doing like I don't like to read it you keep any straight line you know this being when it is completed not not not demand which I might he didn't say that message he deep EST manually planted yeah but this being I have never heard so much on Mysteries preach but this being after he preached the Mysteries after he deep deep yeah he had a party I think I suffering definitely so deep yeah after all that you had to get fit you knowledge Temperance patience godliness and brotherly kindness and love and I can't come and tell you you have that foreign [Applause] [Applause] that you have accepted the death of the Lamb they are provided for you the blood was the token then no present please he took me back here you just press play need you you just speak TV they do foreign foreign and then he said it himself you shall be filled with the Holy Ghost not many of these hands so he tie in the spirit is talking with Acts 28. you shall receive power after the Holy Ghost come upon you this not die with Mary be it done it to me according to a word no I like that wrong scripture wrong anointing for that some people like that what you know I say B doesn't record today wait I believe you would yeah sneak out your heart because even though you get baptized in a church and wood hitting here left right and center the thing that causes you to do what you're doing still there and only wanted us moving not when she just move him not bullet is moving not water this is a fire thing fire just move the snake so gonna have to drop a fire bomb to burn and blew out then he gets such as chair in your heart and then the Holy Ghost himself could come out like a seat that's why I'm the Peter so Peter couldn't deny Christ no more because he had something that that couldn't do that and the NASA the pharah can walk into the church not knowing that God will already take a seat on that throne and Peter was firebombed it wasn't the same Peter that they know I know he's a Casper fisherman I know in a long time that wasn't that you know he was a different man it was Saul numbers Paul Oh Glory to God's Soul you know Saul fighting the Christians and fighting the anointing and fighting a message and so on but when fire took him when fire transformed him that's not the same man you're talking about he said when it pleased God to reveal a son of Me Oh Glory to God if any man take himself to be spiritual or Prophet let him acknowledge what I say is the Commandment of the Lord or if he be ignorant let them be ignorant that's Paul talking I Paul Apostle of Jesus Christ okay the Lord has shout I call a prison of Jesus Christ and the bride will be Jesus Christ the wife of the Lamb oh give the Lord a shout Mrs Jesus Christ who could challenge that he said no other man could make them do otherwise because they are the mind of Christ to know what to do with the word what God want them to do with the world foreign [Music] crippled walking blanks here death can I'm telling you where we going but Glory dead being razor I'll tell you where everyone chants are being cursed Oh Glory to God delivered from Fort stage cancer you get a fifth state Six States whatever stage 11 get cursed and the black Skies roll back and the power of God moving and take over that is what the Holy Ghost was given for that we could stand at the side of a minority and watch the Holy Ghost begin to move or give the Lord a shout I hear in our rumbling tonight I hear in a rumbling in the camp tonight we don't have to harm a hundred people inside of here it just need a few people a few Believers people that believe what the prophet said glory to God hallelujah Hallelujah only the God no the spirit is the token you shall be filled with the Holy Ghost not made his hence and when the blood was shed the token was sent down on the day of Pentecost like a Russian Mighty Wind thigh no gas Dyno gimmick that is specific the token came down as a Russian Mighty Wind A Mighty Wind yes feel it feeling nothing they felt have been and then don't come to hear no he said no he's a rushing by the wind and don't come a person so and so walking on the eyes and don't hear Prophet saws are the only contrary Prophet Apostle past time teacher Allen was waiting for the same Holy Ghost [Applause] waiting waiting for power waiting for fire somebody said I feel like to go just feel oh we had a dream last night we could go off now you're on your own yes and mystery boat praise because somebody says shut your mouth and sit down and keep quiet Joy said when the Bible talk about another tongues I'll speak your heart tongues you speak with tongues we're talking about sit down just open what standing scriptures you can't feel let them move nothing like the human Spirit you're trying I don't know what because we didn't like to do some kind of some kind of crazy stuff this is the word here you won't open up that you can see whatever it is you can't bring a tree eating inside of here you spirit inside yeah that comes that get blasted out so they have to stay there until wait when until Mary feeling this Mary feeling that way she was feeling well but she said just to lose her Pride married you know you take time to do that watching Larry Magdalena watching Mary Magdalene Marion Magdalene and she marries hey Mariel America fishy more righteous than Mary Magdalene no see all of them is everything the same thing same horny girls you want the Rapture the same Holy Ghost you can't do like me man you know yeah you want to know could I get some better Waters than this seven times there he said this one here nice we had a dip that is a muddy Jordan River that we had a dip I don't know what you see me I still had it up there it's up to you if you want to be healed it's up to you you want to be filled it's up to you if you want to be delivered but you have to go down there oh God help us tonight glory to God listen to this that was the theme of every Apostle have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe if the token was not displayed then the Covenant was not in effect see it must be because it's you saying you believe but you don't follow the instructions of the word when you then you don't believe so if you say a belief and then the instructions coming you don't follow instructions what you really want is a religion to comfort your heart and mind but you don't want to yield to the order and instructions of the word because when you yield adapt it shows that you're bringing yourself in obedience because the key that God had to deal with Joshua and all his sons to bring them in the spirit of obedience and Jesus we learned obedience by the things he suffered amen so you are some suffering to go through if you're still stubborn and rebellious you still have some Thunder take because you have to learn this thing yeah born obedient we have to learn it oh let's go let's go let's go you cannot put the blood on the Lincoln of the door where the token could not be unless the lamb died and the blood was a positive sign that landed positive then he dropped this bomb here and the Holy Ghost is a positive token that your lamb died and you receive the token upon yourself for his very life is in you there is no make-belief there is no put on there is no impersonation it is there you know it the world knows it the token is there so you got you can come and tell me about you I see talking in your voice here I adopted and you know I'm here I ain't seen nothing you're seeing more than me and um you know and you're getting this Revelation and this year this is take it easy yeah all right let's go now you say no matter you might have preached the gospel so but Obama is drilling don't know listen this is this is serious now you might have preach the gospel you might have cast out devils when I spoke with tongues you might have shouted dance in the spirit but without the talking you say can I do it but I'm asking a question Paul said so a watch how he goes back to the scriptures Paul said do I speak with tongues of men and angels do I give my body to be to feed the poor my body to be burned and sacrifice I have faith to move mountains and these things I am nothing yet he said don't rely upon that it is the token no matter how much you have done how good you are when the wrath of God flashes it only recognize the token that is why these guys that told the Lord have we done this in your name and that's in your name as well as I preached they felt they were entitled because they've done these things and they were deceived because they missed was requirement and looking to go in on entitlement with Lord I present 40 years is 40 years you know foreign that is nothing Jesus Gentile woke up somewhere and some pick up in the morning time will get older all day and man come late 11th when people come here they get Penny and the one who working a long long time expect to get hello four cents a little extra and God say and God say but you got greet up Penny yeah that's why I want my penny do you see him Penny Pizza Hut and Paul hard which is hard I ever know less than that I want to trade that gospel I have one intellectual gospel I want the same original gospel the Lord himself went everywhere with them confirming the word praise God some man put in some books and tears behind them handing out this and handling all that that is not what the Bible had inside of that there's the original gospel that Jesus commissioned his disciples go into all the world and preach it to them to Every Creature oh get the Lord a shout they're coming back you know oh glory to God back you believe that I can give you a scripted things you know this gospel must be preached and then the end shall come no energy coming until his gospel is preach this is not preaching the gospel we letter and talking explaining for years not in the gospel yet this is the gospel in seed form teaching his gospel and Seed form when the gospel is coming forth that's a different thing it's fire off the Anvil Oh Glory to God the anointed all around the Berlin he hitting them quite then they hit the corner that he had no idea to hit them already Oh Glory they've got Christ in the midst of the people because we're being preaching his power or give the Lord a shout the message will know nothing about that oh hallelujah praise God praise God they are seen nothing like that USC power yet glory to God hallelujah brother Branham he said watch it is a token that the price has been paid as has been required and the price that was paid was the life of Jesus Christ and he gave his life at his Spirit here we go comes back upon you as a token that you are received I think that we're saying again his spirit Pastor holy alley pastor this and pastor this and my church this this church is out just take this result this is this is no church thing now we have a thing here this is this year now what his Spirit comes upon you as a token that you are received and you carry the token with you be a knight not just on Sunday but all the time you have the token then the token become an extension of your arm that's why Peter could say Silver and Gold Have I None such as I have I could kill he could release to whoever he wants to or give the Lord some Praises come on now get it is Israel coming out of Egypt was a type watches and the anti today Egypt was the church and Israel represented the bride and Israel come out of Egypt so does the Bride come out of the church because there has to be something TFA to come out of it's got to come out of it the church is done in Egypt in the world and sin does not care think about your two they don't even believe it but Israel loved it for it was salvation to them it should make us happy oh my God he's talking about he's apply a church no don't fail will you know don't don't let the sun set don't don't don't rest day all night don't take no chance it won't work children it won't work you must have to talk you say I believe yes I I believe the message that that's all right that's good but you must have the token do you hear when I'm tamanaka you must have the talking displayed without it only believing isn't vain you live a good life you listen to what the words say you go to church you try to live right that's fine but that's not it but the judge what if the pastors preach this and tell the people that's not it run from District to that church that church that's not it you're running from Jordan you're already running looking for a priest you're looking for a priests they're looking to die because when the world come to kill them they're running and they were coming to kill not bad sir good self and that's why God tells that by when job say I hate myself it wasn't bad it was the good righteous said that job thought he was and he got stripped said I Repent I was thinking the wrong things I appalled myself and then God could tell you about your city writing I was waiting for you to see that then God could bust job's friends and say listen you guys say what job is saying you better let Joe pray for you because job come true when you come to this spot when you cross your own Jordan you know we don't want to die yeah yeah the lamb had to die to get the blood to apply it we have to die that the Holy Ghost could have preeminances how much you surrender how much you yield how much you give over to God let me see if I could finish wrap up here in a while you're going real good watch this you live a good life you listen to what the word says you go to church you try to live right that's fine that's not it when I see the blood that's the two cause he had to see the actual chemistry because the life was gone from an animal here it is his own life was in the blood and the chemistry is only a signal or sign of sanctification but the life itself is the token for without the circumcision without the talking you're not even the Covenant the whole thing works together if you say you are circumcised to the word and it only then you believe the word if you believe the word then the token has got to come so that's why I'll give you the Assurance tonight the talking Gonna Come it could not come to you because you believe it you receive it you have a word seed in your heart that could become a real seed by the spirit Oh Glory to God the token will come upon you and you'll be filled with the Holy Ghost notice then oh this is so nice then the preparation for his Promised Land people love that freeze notice then the preparation for his Promised Land people notice when he what he did first he had a people that he had made a land for them a preparation for it for the promised land people it was only for those who was predestinated to the promised land bride of that day isn't that right how he done it he sent a prophet with a message identified by the pillar of fire and gave a token that they could rest assure it was right it was a consolation and then he would go along with the scriptures First Corinthians 12 by one spirit we are all Eternal Chinese Holy Ghost Japanese Holy Ghost Train That's Holy Ghost and America Holy Ghost Canadian Holy Ghost they don't have that it have one Spirit one spirit so if the spirit baptizes brother here and that is brother dear look at that fellowship if the car Fellowship we know it's not the same spirit is a different kind of spirit message Spirit during that Spirit different kind but not the same Spirit one Spirit you're baptized into one body just as God take you and dip in water we take and Deep in water baptize the name of Jesus Christ God take care and tip you in the spirit when they come out you're dripping you're staggering you're drunk you're hallelujah or all your training anointing gone hallelujah or all your old man gone because you're in the spirit now oh give the Lord some Praises by one Spirit listen we are baptized in the mystical body of Jesus Christ by one Spirit capital s p i r i t we are all immersed into this one body then the token is on the door and you are in Christ and he was the one your sacrifice who's the judgment and when God look upon that he can't do a thing you are just as safe as you can be because God and Christ is a selfless person then the spirit has been made flesh and dwell Among Us and there is god with his own self and you his own children into the body there you are not the chemical but the spirit don't you rely upon speaking in tongues or nothing else let the talkness self be dear then identified by George the person of Jesus Christ his own life in you now the Pentecostal if God receives the prophet they was going to go into these virtues to get the Peace of Christ in them they got the put which is the baptism 1906 and they were supposed to go on with the word but because they reject the word they just get through off into that age loud this year capped off and got opened my whole age I didn't mystery a bright age the product to do what to get you into what the person of Jesus Christ and Peter revealed the person of Jesus Christ faith and virtual knowledge and water when you have these things you have the very person of Christ inside of you oh glory to God do you are you with me all right you almost done here now now watch he said watch he said um notice they will not just come together okay no I'll skip a little bit Christ in you and the life lives out through you you say what about the mark of the beast people explaining meet somebody tell me boy Mark the peace boy they're putting a chip in your forehead some intellectual man come up with some kind of repetition and they have all kinds of places the vaccine what about the mark of the beast doors who reject the Holy Spirit is already marked by the Beast the punishment will come later so what's something Ezekiel 9. angels destroying Angels income writer question put a mark upon those who sigh and cry now the church members they may sign nothing they may cry in nothing then believe in their Church but the bride like I say when I when a lamp falling I might think the alarm crying because you want to get out when a pig Fallen I say my thing hey I mean you while doing this is this is my thing this is pitting so if you want to wallow in your picking like you just show what kind of meat you have but if you're bleeding if you're crying you want a breakthrough you want Deliverance you want Victory you want there's a thirst inside of you blessed are they that hung on tears after righteousness they shall be filled if the people don't want the feeling it means that they don't have to be too simple George this satisfy the satisfied with the message they satisfy what they're hearing the Salvation behind it because he got Twisted he's just bringing Mysteries just bringing knowledge and information he likes Saul we Trent and don't even know it get it pink slip just ain't going home yet of course you're on the throne but David is coming that bride will be that David eyes could be that David in the bride David come in because we have to do what the world constituations Goliath yeah you know there'll be a confrontation you know even if it's bright just gonna hide around hiding and you know I want nobody know and they bribe that you know this is the same God that Satan come on children his bride and God hidden this is that same God come back and Satan eat into this place right you know this bride going on display you know makeup inside of here if

before we leave here for a blast before we leave here Joelle saw a mighty Army join us on your cards a bunch of half heart Oh Glory to God let the weak say I am strong and the devil shall Blossom no glory to God hallelujah I kind of think that is it please let me see about the food all right notice they will not come together to talk about a message they come together to apply the blood what if we get it in Minnesota yeah they come together to apply the blood to apply the token that's what you must do Pastor Neville and to this congregation trust these deacons to you Brethren this time we let aside all the foolishness of the world time we live inside everything else we have seen enough now there will be a positive show that the token must be applied without it you're going to perish you must perish that's the only thing but I'm telling you don't change that don't come together and say I believe it can't be needed get into it how do it by one spirit to the Bible we are baptized into the body of Jesus Christ everybody believe in all your heart see he was not responsible for anybody who has not been needed he only recognizes the token I hear this bum someone never says before he only recognizes the token that's the message of the hour that's the message of this day if we don't come to the Token I will say we spin it up in mud wasting time to come up to the tool after we add divide multiply subtract find the square root of is after equal the two watch you only recognizes the token that's the message that they are that's the message of this day that's the message of this time in the name of Jesus Christ receive it God is your joy we should come on please God is your strength knowing the message knowing the truth that's our sufficiency now he is my all-sufficiency in him all things I have need of is in him that's our strength my health coming from the Lord you Christians Look to Him for your joy Look to Him for your strength look for him for your happiness he is my peace he's my joy he's my love he's my life that's a covenant a token upon the door oh my but the Bible says the thing that made you dear when you come to the Lord that's the whole route of evil is still there notice when you repent and baptize the name of Jesus Christ he forgives you of your sins then secondly come sanctification which sets your mind in order for Holiness to think right some vacation is a compound Greek word which means clean set aside for service then next come the baptism of fire and the holy ghost that God might dwell in us and the fire of God here we go cleanses our hearts from sin and puts the Holy Ghost Inside then we bring forth the same life that he did because it is us now in a natural birth when a woman gives a bit to a baby Natural Life types of spiritual ability the first thing happened is the breaking of water then blood then the spirit life grabs the little fellow water blood spirit now when a baby is born in the kingdom of God he comes the same way water blood spirit no it's on vacation second stage cleanses the mind is the heart the mind of the heart in order of Holiness a man can repent of his sins a moral man every moral looking woman he finds it's still dear maybe he's a drunkard every time he smells the drink it is still a tear but when he gets Sanctified that cleanses that desire out of him see it takes the want of it away he can still be tempted but it takes the want of it away still he's not right yet then he is baptized by the Holy Ghost on Fire cleansed burnt out cleaned up and then put into service of God salification only sets them aside for service isn't that right we are the end time three stages baptism cleanses the heart with the Holy Ghost now he's called the churches of justification call it Tucson vacation then fill it with rules on fire then he took it to a process that he himself the Holy Spirit himself the Son of God could dwell in the human heart it has to go through that before he can come in stay right with he said then the church that professed to be a Christian Church will have to have the same spirit that was in Jesus Christ for at the resurrection of the church Christ and his bride will Dove till freeze God isn't that right he said it ought to be striking it ought to make a church member come to Christ and stay until he's filled with the Holy Ghost it's the only promise of the rapture it is the only promise of the Rapture the only way the church and Christ can come together the very Spirit oh my Hallelujah the second Eve watch she was created Anew on the day of Pentecost
