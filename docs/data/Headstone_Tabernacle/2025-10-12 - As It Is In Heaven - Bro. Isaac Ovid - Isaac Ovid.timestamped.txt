[26:40] Reading from verses 1-9.
[26:43] Hallelujah.
[26:45] [Music]
[26:47] Psalms 107 it says, "Oh, give thanks
[26:52] unto the Lord for he is good, for his
[26:54] mercy endured forever.
[26:58] Let the redeemed of the Lord say so,
[27:01] whom he had redeemed from the hand of
[27:04] the enemy,
[27:05] and gathered them out of the lands from
[27:08] the east and from the west, from the
[27:11] north and from the south. They wandered
[27:14] in the wilderness in a solitary way.
[27:17] They found no city to dwell in. Hungry
[27:20] and thirsty, their souls fainted in
[27:23] them. Then they cried unto the Lord in
[27:26] their trouble, and he delivered them out
[27:29] of their distresses.
[27:32] And he led them forth by the right way,
[27:35] that they might go to a city of
[27:37] habitation.
[27:39] Would that men would praise God for his
[27:41] goodness, for his wondrous works to the
[27:45] children of men, for he satisfied the
[27:47] lonely soul and he filled the hungry
[27:50] soul with goodness.
[27:53] Amen. Play that song. Jehovah Gyra my
[27:56] provider. You are more than enough.

[28:05] Lord for bringing us here this morning

[28:12] our sins, all our failures, all our
[28:14] mistakes this morning. We come with our
[28:16] hearts open, Lord, to be filled with
[28:18] you, Lord Jesus. Fill us up this
[28:20] morning, Lord. We lift out our cups this
[28:22] morning for more of you, Lord Jesus.
[28:24] This is our desire this morning, Lord

[53:25] praise. My heart, my mind, my soul,
[53:29] my heart,
[53:32] my mind,
[53:34] my soul belong to you.

[56:52] God in the highest this morning. Do you
[56:55] know your redeemer live this morning?
[56:58] Amen. Amen. Amen. I know my redeemer
[57:00] lives. Thank you, Jesus.
[57:06] Hallelujah. Bless yourself this morning.
[57:09] I know
[57:11] my redeemer
[57:14] is
[57:18] I know
[57:21] my redeemer
[57:23] lives.
[57:25] [Music]
[57:27] Let all creation
[57:30] testify.
[57:32] Let this life within me find and I know
[57:38] my redeemer
[57:41] is.
[57:42] Oh,
[57:44] sing I know
[57:47] my redeemer
[57:49] is.
[57:53] Sing I know who
[57:56] I

[58:01] [Music]
[58:02] [Applause]
[58:03] [Music]
[58:13] my redeemer.
[58:16] Let's just sing it one more time. Oh, I
[58:20] know
[58:21] my redeemer.
[58:23] [Music]
[58:25] Oh,
[58:27] I know.
[58:32] [Music]
[58:34] Hallelujah.
[58:36] Let every
[58:38] testify
[58:41] his life.
[58:43] [Applause]
[58:44] [Music]
[58:46] Let's just sing it one more time all
[58:49] over the building.
[58:51] Hallelujah. Lord, I know
[58:56] my redeemer
[58:58] lives.
[59:01] [Music]
[59:08] Glory.
[59:16] I will be
[59:19] [Music]
[59:21] my redeemer.
[59:30] [Applause]
[59:32] Give him praise.
[59:34] Give him glory. Give him worship.
[59:38] Give him honor. He is worthy of the
[59:41] praise. He is worthy of the glory. Let
[59:44] everything that had breath praise the
[59:46] Lord.
[59:48] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[59:52] Hallelujah.
[59:54] Yes, you can do better than that.
[59:56] He is worthy. From the rising of the sun
[1:00:00] to the going down of the same, his name
[1:00:03] is worthy to be praised.
[1:00:06] There's none like him. There's none like
[1:00:09] him. Oh, blessed be the name of the
[1:00:13] Lord.
[1:00:15] Glory, glory, glory, glory, glory,
[1:00:18] glory, glory, glory, glory,
[1:00:23] glory.
[1:00:24] Don't stop now. He inhabits the praises
[1:00:27] of his people. He loves it when we
[1:00:30] worship. He loves it when you lift your
[1:00:32] hands. Brother Brandham said, "You defy
[1:00:35] the laws of gravity. When you lift your
[1:00:37] hands, you let the world know you are a
[1:00:40] creature of eternity. We don't belong
[1:00:42] here." Hallelujah.
[1:00:46] [Music]
[1:00:47] Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:00:51] Let's just bow our heads for a word of
[1:00:54] prayer.
[1:00:57] Heavenly Father, we thank you this
[1:00:59] morning that we could be gathered in
[1:01:00] your house one more time. Lord, there's
[1:01:03] truly no place we'd rather be, Father.
[1:01:06] Lord, we don't take it for granted,
[1:01:08] Lord. There are many people who did not
[1:01:10] wake up this morning. There are many
[1:01:12] people who died in their sleep. There
[1:01:14] are many people who did not make it
[1:01:16] through the night. But we are here this
[1:01:18] morning, Lord, by divine purpose, by
[1:01:21] divine decree, by your divine will.
[1:01:24] Lord, we are the expression of your
[1:01:26] will, Father. Lord, without your grace,
[1:01:28] we would not stand here this morning.
[1:01:31] And Lord, we don't want to take it for
[1:01:32] granted ever. Lord, there's nothing we
[1:01:34] could do to ever deserve this. There's
[1:01:36] nothing we could do to be qualified for
[1:01:38] this. But your grace and your mercy and
[1:01:41] your love reach from eternity, Lord,
[1:01:43] into this dimension, Lord. And you are
[1:01:46] able to call us, Father, because our
[1:01:48] names were already written, Father. You
[1:01:50] are not now calling this morning. You
[1:01:52] are not now choosing this morning, Lord.
[1:01:54] It is because we are seed, Lord, we
[1:01:57] could be reborn. It's because we are
[1:01:59] seed we could come to this gospel. It's
[1:02:01] because we are seed we could receive
[1:02:03] more from you. Because we are seed,
[1:02:06] every demon in hell has to bend, has to
[1:02:09] break, has to bow, Lord. You said every
[1:02:11] knee will bow. Every tongue will confess
[1:02:14] that you are Lord. You are Lord of our
[1:02:16] lives. You are Lord of our homes. You
[1:02:18] are Lord of our physical bodies. You are
[1:02:21] Lord of our minds. You are Lord of every
[1:02:23] circumstance.
[1:02:25] Lord, may you speak to us from your word
[1:02:27] this morning. May you take me out of the
[1:02:29] way and may you speak lip to ear to your
[1:02:31] people. We are totally and completely
[1:02:34] dependent upon you. May you walk out the
[1:02:37] pages of the Bible, Lord. And may you
[1:02:39] reveal yourself to us. There are many in
[1:02:41] here this morning with different needs,
[1:02:43] different situations, different
[1:02:45] problems, whatever it might be. Lord,
[1:02:47] may you minister to each one at the
[1:02:49] point of their need. I don't know what
[1:02:51] the need is, but you know the needs this
[1:02:52] morning. May May you speak to your
[1:02:54] people this morning. May you take me out
[1:02:56] of the way. May you bless those that are
[1:02:58] here physically, Lord. And Lord, those
[1:03:01] that are not here that are connected
[1:03:02] online. May the angel of the Lord, the
[1:03:04] presence of the Lord visit them where
[1:03:06] they might be. We commit this service
[1:03:08] over to you in the precious name of
[1:03:10] Jesus Christ. And the church says,
[1:03:12] &gt;&gt; "Amen."
[1:03:12] &gt;&gt; And the church says,
[1:03:14] &gt;&gt; "Amen."
[1:03:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so I'd like to welcome you
[1:03:16] this morning in the precious name of
[1:03:19] Jesus Christ. And while you're standing,
[1:03:22] uh, if you have your Bibles,
[1:03:26] would you turn with me to two portions
[1:03:29] of scripture,
[1:03:31] we want to read from Matthew 6.
[1:03:34] Thank you, brother Jason. Thank you,
[1:03:36] musicians.
[1:03:38] Matthew 6 and reading from verse 9.
[1:03:42] and Revelation 4 reading from verse one.
[1:03:56] Matthew 6 and from verse 9. After this
[1:04:01] manner, therefore pray ye. Our Father,
[1:04:04] which art in heaven, hallowed be thy
[1:04:07] name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done
[1:04:10] in earth as it is in heaven. Give us
[1:04:13] this day our daily bread, and forgive us
[1:04:15] our debts as we forgive our debtors, and
[1:04:18] lead us not into temptation, but deliver
[1:04:21] us from evil. For thine is the kingdom,
[1:04:23] and the power, and the glory forever.
[1:04:26] Amen. And let's read from Revelation 4
[1:04:31] and from verse one.
[1:04:36] After this, I looked, and behold, a door
[1:04:38] was opened in heaven.
[1:04:41] And the first voice which I heard was as
[1:04:43] it were of a trumpet talking with me,
[1:04:46] which said, "Come up hither, and I will
[1:04:48] show thee things which must be
[1:04:50] hereafter."
[1:04:52] And immediately I was in the spirit. And
[1:04:55] behold, a throne was set in heaven, and
[1:04:57] one sat on the throne. And he that sat
[1:05:00] was to look upon like a jasper and a
[1:05:03] sardine stone. And there was a rainbow
[1:05:06] round about the throne in sight like
[1:05:08] unto an emerald. And round about the
[1:05:11] throne were four and 20 seats. And upon
[1:05:14] the seats I saw four and 20 elders
[1:05:16] sitting clothed in white raignment. And
[1:05:19] they had on their heads crowns of gold.
[1:05:22] And out of the throne proceeded
[1:05:24] lightnings and thunderings and voices.
[1:05:26] And there were seven lamps of fire
[1:05:28] burning before the throne, which are the
[1:05:30] seven spirits of God. And before the
[1:05:33] throne there was a sea of glass, like
[1:05:35] unto crystal, and in the midst of the
[1:05:37] throne, and round about the throne were
[1:05:38] four beasts full of eyes before and
[1:05:40] behind. And the first beast was like a
[1:05:43] lion, and the second beast like a calf,
[1:05:44] and the third beast had a face as a man,
[1:05:47] and the fourth beast was like a flying
[1:05:49] eagle. And the four beasts had each of
[1:05:51] them six wings about him, and they were
[1:05:54] full of eyes within, and they rest not
[1:05:56] day and night, saying, "Holy, holy,
[1:05:59] holy, Lord God Almighty, which was and
[1:06:02] is and is to come." And when those
[1:06:04] beasts gave glory and honor and thanks
[1:06:06] to him that sat on the throne, who
[1:06:09] liveth forever and ever, the four and 20
[1:06:12] elders fall down before him and sat on
[1:06:14] the throne and worship him that liveth
[1:06:16] forever and ever, and cast their crowns
[1:06:18] before the throne, saying, "Thou art
[1:06:21] worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and
[1:06:23] honor and power, for thou hast created
[1:06:25] all things, and for thy pleasure they
[1:06:28] are and were created." May the Lord add
[1:06:30] a blessing to the reading of his word.
[1:06:32] You may be seated in the presence of the
[1:06:35] Lord this morning. Certainly a great
[1:06:37] privilege to be able to gather in the
[1:06:40] house of God because we are spiritual
[1:06:42] beings. We are not natural beings. We
[1:06:45] walk amongst natural people, but we are
[1:06:47] spiritual class of people. We are a God
[1:06:50] class of people. So we are a little
[1:06:53] lower than the angels when it comes to
[1:06:54] who we are in terms of our ancestry or
[1:06:58] genealogy or spiritual genealogy. We are
[1:07:00] not created above the animals. We are
[1:07:03] spiritual beings here on the earth to
[1:07:06] have a reflection of God's power, his
[1:07:08] grace, his will, and to prove to the
[1:07:09] devil that we will not be deceived.
[1:07:12] &gt;&gt; And the fact that we cannot be deceived
[1:07:14] is because we are the elect of God. The
[1:07:17] elect of God not by our own election,
[1:07:19] but we are the elect of God by his
[1:07:21] election, his choosing and his calling.
[1:07:24] And his calling and his choosing is not
[1:07:26] a present tense activity. It is
[1:07:28] something that took place before the
[1:07:29] foundation of the world. Because the
[1:07:31] Bible said speaks in past tense. For who
[1:07:33] he forneew, he called. Past tense. Who
[1:07:36] we called, he justified. Past tense. And
[1:07:38] who we justify, he hath already
[1:07:40] glorified. So the way God sees us is
[1:07:43] very different from the way we see
[1:07:45] ourselves. We woke up this morning and
[1:07:47] we see a fallen man. We see a man that
[1:07:49] is dealing with pains and aches and
[1:07:51] trials and bills and and situations and
[1:07:54] circumstances. But when God looks
[1:07:56] through the barrier between time and
[1:07:58] eternity, he sees you as an eternal
[1:08:01] being.
[1:08:02] One who rotated off of his presence.
[1:08:06] &gt;&gt; He sees you in the state that you are as
[1:08:08] representation by predestination. He
[1:08:11] sees you because you there's a theophony
[1:08:13] and this physical element that we call
[1:08:15] our bodies is just a house for the soul.
[1:08:18] That's the real who we are. That if we
[1:08:20] were to put down this mortal body,
[1:08:21] there's another body waiting for us. So
[1:08:23] death does not intimidate us. Sickness
[1:08:26] does not intimidate us. And we are very
[1:08:28] clear that there's a God above us who is
[1:08:31] bigger than our situation, who is bigger
[1:08:33] than our circumstance, a God of
[1:08:35] miracles, a God of the impossible, a God
[1:08:38] who is able to transform and to change
[1:08:41] and to take someone who knows nothing
[1:08:42] about him. Because when we come into
[1:08:44] this world, we forgot where we came
[1:08:46] from. When we were born, we forgot our
[1:08:48] ancestry. So God had to tell Job, Job,
[1:08:51] where was thou when I laid the
[1:08:52] foundation of the earth and the morning
[1:08:54] stars sang together. And the sons of God
[1:08:56] shouted for joy because there were some
[1:08:58] people who were there. And because they
[1:09:00] were there, they could be represented
[1:09:02] here. Despite their trials, their
[1:09:04] tribulations, their testing, the
[1:09:06] opposition, despite your feeling,
[1:09:08] despite your mind battles, despite your
[1:09:10] insecurities, and what went wrong this
[1:09:13] morning, we're not speaking about what
[1:09:15] went wrong. We're not speaking about
[1:09:16] what happened yesterday or last month.
[1:09:18] We are going back to eternity. We back
[1:09:21] before time because only if you are
[1:09:23] eternal, you can be part of the
[1:09:25] eternity. Can the church say amen?
[1:09:28] &gt;&gt; So because we are eternal beings trapped
[1:09:30] in time. Hallelujah. We are subject to
[1:09:33] the elements of time. But it doesn't
[1:09:35] change who we are. That's why the broth
[1:09:37] could speak plainly. You are not the
[1:09:39] believer. But the word seed in you, that
[1:09:42] eternal seed that had no beginning and
[1:09:44] could have no ending, that seed speaks
[1:09:47] for you. That seed is the seed that
[1:09:49] brought you to church this morning. You
[1:09:51] didn't drive to church this morning. You
[1:09:53] didn't you didn't wake up and say, "I'm
[1:09:55] feeling to go to church." That seed
[1:09:57] wants to be here. That seed.
[1:10:01] Is there anybody in the house this
[1:10:03] morning?
[1:10:05] You may be seated. I'm just having a
[1:10:07] conversation with you before I get into
[1:10:08] the word because the challenge is we are
[1:10:11] suffering from an identity crisis.
[1:10:14] &gt;&gt; This is not just a world issue. It's a
[1:10:16] issue in the church. It's a issue in
[1:10:19] homes. It's an issue in marriages. It's
[1:10:21] an issue in families. If you do not know
[1:10:24] who you are, what you are, what you are
[1:10:27] called to do, you will be abusive to
[1:10:29] yourself, abusive to your purpose.
[1:10:36] If you don't know what a hammer is, you
[1:10:38] will take a microphone. If you don't
[1:10:40] know what a microphone is for, you can
[1:10:41] take a microphone and hit it because you
[1:10:42] want to pound a nail
[1:10:44] &gt;&gt; because you don't understand the purpose
[1:10:46] of the thing.
[1:10:48] &gt;&gt; But when you understand the purpose of
[1:10:49] the thing, you treat it a certain way.
[1:10:52] &gt;&gt; But you have to have a revelation of the
[1:10:54] thing.
[1:10:55] &gt;&gt; If I take a bag of money and a banana
[1:10:58] and put it in front of a monkey, he will
[1:11:00] take the banana and run. Although the
[1:11:02] bag of money could buy a million
[1:11:04] bananas,
[1:11:06] &gt;&gt; because he doesn't understand the
[1:11:07] purpose of the thing, he treats it
[1:11:09] casually.
[1:11:12] &gt;&gt; And many of us, we don't understand the
[1:11:14] spiritual purpose of the thing.
[1:11:16] &gt;&gt; This thing called faith, that is the
[1:11:18] substance of what we hoping for. We hold
[1:11:20] on to our paychecks. We hold on to our
[1:11:23] jobs. But faith is worth more than your
[1:11:25] job. Faith is worth more than your
[1:11:27] paycheck. Faith could produce a better
[1:11:30] job. You hold on to the thing because
[1:11:32] you think the thing is what you're
[1:11:34] fighting for, but faith could replace
[1:11:36] the thing. Faith could transform the
[1:11:38] thing. You hold on to the good report of
[1:11:40] the doctor, but faith reaches to a
[1:11:43] higher report, the report of the Lord
[1:11:45] that could every single time beat the
[1:11:47] report of the doctor. I don't know if
[1:11:49] you're hearing me this morning.
[1:11:52] Faith is the substance of what we are
[1:11:54] hoping for. It's the evidence of what we
[1:11:56] cannot see. By faith, Abraham. By faith,
[1:12:00] Noah. By faith, Moses. By faith, you are
[1:12:03] here this morning. You came by faith
[1:12:05] because you believe something could
[1:12:07] change.
[1:12:09] &gt;&gt; You don't know what, but you believe
[1:12:11] something could change. What's the good
[1:12:13] coming to church if you don't want to
[1:12:14] get changed? We are not here to waste
[1:12:17] time. Oh, somebody preach back to me.
[1:12:19] &gt;&gt; So, it took faith to put on your tie
[1:12:22] this morning. It took faith to get
[1:12:24] dressed. It took faith to look in the
[1:12:25] mirror and say, "This works. It took
[1:12:28] faith to drive up the road even though
[1:12:30] it's rain, even though it's traffic,
[1:12:31] even though you're feeling sick. There
[1:12:33] are people out here this morning,
[1:12:34] they're in pain, but they're in the
[1:12:36] house because they have faith that God
[1:12:38] is a healer. They have faith that the
[1:12:40] purpose of God by election might stand.
[1:12:43] They have faith that the doctor could be
[1:12:45] waiting to perform the surgery. But
[1:12:47] before the doctor's hand touches my
[1:12:49] wife, before the doctor begins to
[1:12:51] operate on you, the tumor could be
[1:12:53] dissolved. The sickness could be dealt
[1:12:55] with. The issue could be taken care of.
[1:12:58] That's what faith is. Faith gives you a
[1:13:01] confidence. Faith makes you speak
[1:13:03] different. Faith makes you change your
[1:13:05] outlook on life.
[1:13:08] Anybody in the house this morning?
[1:13:12] Hallelujah. We preach in a little bit,
[1:13:14] but I want to encourage you. The Bible
[1:13:16] says, "By faith, Moses refused to be
[1:13:20] called the son of Pharaoh's daughter."
[1:13:22] For all of his life, that is how he was
[1:13:24] known. That was his identification. This
[1:13:27] is Pharaoh's daughter son. This is
[1:13:29] Pharaoh's daughter's son. But by faith,
[1:13:32] it was not just a declaration. It took
[1:13:34] faith for him to make the statement,
[1:13:37] "Don't call me that." He refused to be
[1:13:40] called the son of Pharaoh's daughter. He
[1:13:42] said, "That's not my name. That's not
[1:13:44] who I am. That's not my identity. That
[1:13:47] name is not tied to my purpose. When you
[1:13:50] call me that, I know that's not who I
[1:13:52] am." Hallelujah. And you are not a child
[1:13:55] of this world. You are not a son of
[1:13:57] Satan. You are not serpent seed. You are
[1:14:00] not a failure. That's not your name. You
[1:14:03] are not sick. Arthritis is not your
[1:14:05] name. Cancer is not your name. High
[1:14:08] blood pressure is not your name.
[1:14:10] Fornication is not your name. Adultery
[1:14:13] is not your name. Your past is not your
[1:14:16] identification. We refuse by faith this
[1:14:19] morning to be called the son of
[1:14:21] Pharaoh's daughter.
[1:14:24] Brother said, "I'm not the son of
[1:14:26] Charles and Ella Brandom. I refuse to be
[1:14:29] identified by who my parents are. My
[1:14:31] natural parents, he saw himself as a son
[1:14:34] of God. I come from God and I go back to
[1:14:37] God. I don't care who your father is,
[1:14:39] your grandfather, your greatgrandfather.
[1:14:42] We reject that natural bloodline and we
[1:14:45] refuse that natural bloodline and accept
[1:14:47] the genealogy of God because in that
[1:14:50] genealogy as healing,
[1:14:53] &gt;&gt; deliverance, breakthrough, freedom,
[1:14:57] power and attitude. In there is
[1:15:00] humility. In there is love. In there is
[1:15:03] faith and virtue and knowledge and
[1:15:06] temperance and patience and godliness
[1:15:08] and confidence to say no to the devil.
[1:15:11] We reject sickness this morning. We
[1:15:14] reject our past this morning.
[1:15:20] [Music]
[1:15:22] [Applause]
[1:15:29] Hallelujah.
[1:15:32] [Applause]
[1:15:35] Hallelujah.
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; The Bible said, "Is there not a cause?"
[1:15:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:41] &gt;&gt; And there enough situations
[1:15:44] &gt;&gt; that should push us to become more
[1:15:46] serious.
[1:15:49] &gt;&gt; Because the prophet said, "If love
[1:15:50] doesn't get us desperate, then
[1:15:52] conditions will."
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; Situations will come in and around our
[1:15:57] lives. Amen.
[1:15:59] &gt;&gt; Why wait for God to break your foot to
[1:16:01] say, "Lord, I need you."
[1:16:03] &gt;&gt; Why wait for a crisis to say, "Lord, I
[1:16:05] need you."
[1:16:06] &gt;&gt; The prophet said, "What we see should
[1:16:08] put our souls into action
[1:16:10] &gt;&gt; to make a church." God is not making the
[1:16:13] church. He builds the church. He gives
[1:16:14] the foundation of the church, but the
[1:16:16] making of the church, the work of making
[1:16:18] the church is on the believers
[1:16:20] &gt;&gt; because God wants to have a perfect
[1:16:22] church.
[1:16:23] &gt;&gt; A church that sin cannot stay in the
[1:16:24] church. A church that sickness cannot
[1:16:26] stay in the church. a church that if you
[1:16:28] want to come, it's because you're
[1:16:29] serious about coming. Because I'm
[1:16:31] persuaded that people do what they want
[1:16:33] to do.
[1:16:35] [Music]
[1:16:40] &gt;&gt; G.
[1:16:41] &gt;&gt; It's a choice. I'm just having a
[1:16:42] conversation. We'll preach. Today's
[1:16:44] Sunday. We have said it before. Sundays
[1:16:45] is the Lord's day.
[1:16:47] &gt;&gt; Buckle your seat belt. We here
[1:16:49] &gt;&gt; because we have some needs to pray for.
[1:16:51] We have some demons to deal with. We
[1:16:53] have some situation that must be
[1:16:55] resolved because we have a
[1:16:56] responsibility. This age is like no
[1:16:58] other age. What we could do, Moses could
[1:17:00] not do. What we could do, not even
[1:17:02] whether Brandham could do because this
[1:17:03] is the last age. And the spirit, the
[1:17:05] prophet, and the bride will say the same
[1:17:07] thing. There's a power that's going to
[1:17:09] be put into the church of the living
[1:17:11] God. Not a power for us to be church
[1:17:13] members, but for a power to live a holy
[1:17:15] life. A power to reject sin. A power to
[1:17:18] live holy. A power to speak to your
[1:17:20] situation and see your situation dealt
[1:17:22] with. A power to take us back to Eden. A
[1:17:25] power to have dominion over yourself
[1:17:27] before you could have dominion over
[1:17:29] other things and other situations.
[1:17:31] [Applause]
[1:17:32] A power to stand. And that power comes
[1:17:35] by overcoming. To him that overcome it
[1:17:37] will I make a pillar in the house of my
[1:17:39] God and he shall go no more out. You
[1:17:42] struggling with backsliding. You need to
[1:17:44] overcome some more. May God give you the
[1:17:46] strength to overcome. Overcome lying,
[1:17:48] overcome doubt, overcome your mind.
[1:17:53] [Applause]
[1:17:53] [Music]
[1:17:56] &gt;&gt; For a title this morning, I want to take
[1:17:59] a title from that scripture we read from
[1:18:01] the Lord's Prayer. As it is in heaven.
[1:18:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:06] as it is in heaven.
[1:18:09] &gt;&gt; That was the Lord's prayer. Thy will be
[1:18:12] done on earth
[1:18:14] &gt;&gt; as it is in heaven.
[1:18:16] &gt;&gt; Because I could guarantee in heaven
[1:18:18] God's will is established.
[1:18:23] &gt;&gt; That's what he loved about David. He
[1:18:25] said, "David is a man after my own
[1:18:27] heart, and he shall do all of my will.
[1:18:35] Can the church say amen? Everybody
[1:18:37] feeling fine?
[1:18:40] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:18:43] &gt;&gt; And then we read with John where the
[1:18:46] Lord called John. And maybe I'll start
[1:18:48] there before I go back to the beginning
[1:18:52] where we read the scripture
[1:18:56] and this is where John was on the aisle
[1:18:58] of Patmos.
[1:19:00] He was in exile.
[1:19:01] &gt;&gt; That's right. He was on an island with
[1:19:04] criminals,
[1:19:06] murderers,
[1:19:07] bandits, all kind of manner of people.
[1:19:10] And he was there not because he had done
[1:19:12] a crime. He was there because he was
[1:19:14] preaching this gospel.
[1:19:16] &gt;&gt; They tried to do everything they could
[1:19:18] do. They tried to boil him in oil.
[1:19:21] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:19:22] &gt;&gt; If you put your finger in oil in burning
[1:19:24] oil, you know what has happened?
[1:19:25] &gt;&gt; They tried to boil John and that didn't
[1:19:27] work. Amen.
[1:19:29] &gt;&gt; You imagine
[1:19:31] &gt;&gt; the Bible say you'll pick up deadly
[1:19:32] thing and it wouldn't harm you.
[1:19:36] &gt;&gt; They they get so frustrated with John
[1:19:38] they throw John in exile. That's right.
[1:19:41] &gt;&gt; John is there by himself.
[1:19:44] The Bible doesn't tell us if there was a
[1:19:45] deacon, there was an elder, there was a
[1:19:47] minister. John is there by himself in
[1:19:48] exile. And in those days, exile wasn't a
[1:19:50] nice thing. It was a laboral kind of
[1:19:52] camp.
[1:19:53] &gt;&gt; You're working. But in the middle there,
[1:19:55] the Bible said that behold,
[1:19:58] a door was open in heaven,
[1:20:00] &gt;&gt; and the first voice which I heard was as
[1:20:03] it were of a trumpet talking with me,
[1:20:05] said, "Come up hither, and I will show
[1:20:06] thee things which must be hereafter."
[1:20:08] And immediately I was in the spirit.
[1:20:11] &gt;&gt; Church, if the voice ever speaks to you,
[1:20:13] you cast out the spirit.
[1:20:17] &gt;&gt; He was in exile, but he got in the
[1:20:19] spirit when the voice got to him. I
[1:20:21] could tell when you heard from the
[1:20:22] voice.
[1:20:24] Because when you hear from the voice,
[1:20:26] immediately you're in the spirit.
[1:20:28] Because you cannot get anything from God
[1:20:30] if you're not in the spirit.
[1:20:32] &gt;&gt; It's impossible. But when that voice
[1:20:35] came to John, he was in the spirit.
[1:20:37] Hallelujah. I pray to God that the voice
[1:20:40] speaks to you this morning. Not the
[1:20:42] voice of the preacher, not my voice, but
[1:20:44] that same voice that said, "Let there
[1:20:45] be." That same voice that said, "Let
[1:20:48] there be light." And there was light.
[1:20:49] That same voice that called this one and
[1:20:52] that one say Peter come James come
[1:20:55] Gideon thou mighty man of valor told the
[1:20:58] prophet you will forun hallelujah the
[1:21:01] second coming that same voice is still
[1:21:03] speaking this morning can the church say
[1:21:06] amen
[1:21:07] &gt;&gt; and that voice says come up hithermen
[1:21:10] &gt;&gt; come up higher
[1:21:11] &gt;&gt; don't get on in the carnal realm don't
[1:21:13] don't drop your level God doesn't come
[1:21:15] down to our level can the church say
[1:21:16] amen he pulls us higher
[1:21:19] &gt;&gt; you need to rise above your problems.
[1:21:21] This is not positive selft talk. You
[1:21:23] need to rise above your situation. Can
[1:21:25] the church say amen?
[1:21:27] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:21:28] [Music]
[1:21:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:32] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:21:35] &gt;&gt; To see things
[1:21:37] that are meant to be,
[1:21:39] &gt;&gt; things that supposed to be thereafter.
[1:21:41] And God was showing John a picture of
[1:21:44] heaven.
[1:21:47] Can the church say amen?
[1:21:50] &gt;&gt; 24 elders,
[1:21:52] four beasts, throne, cherubims,
[1:21:56] structure. In other words, heaven has a
[1:21:58] structure.
[1:22:00] &gt;&gt; Heaven has a layout.
[1:22:02] &gt;&gt; It's not a random thing. Let me put the
[1:22:04] thing here and let me do this here. No.
[1:22:06] God has a structure. Heaven is
[1:22:08] structured. There are cherubims, seven
[1:22:10] lamps. It's not 92 lamps. No, it's seven
[1:22:12] lamps.
[1:22:13] &gt;&gt; Flames of fire. Can the church say amen?
[1:22:15] Seven stars, seven horns, seven golden
[1:22:18] candlesticks. There's a structure,
[1:22:20] there's a order, there's a divine order
[1:22:22] that is in heaven.
[1:22:24] &gt;&gt; Can the church say amen?
[1:22:26] [Applause]
[1:22:32] &gt;&gt; What makes heaven heaven is the
[1:22:34] expression of God's will.
[1:22:39] &gt;&gt; That's what makes it heaven. Because in
[1:22:41] heaven, God's will alone is the will
[1:22:43] that stands.
[1:22:45] &gt;&gt; Everybody with me this morning? I'm
[1:22:47] saying a few things to help us. So God,
[1:22:50] we know existed all alone. LR Elohim. He
[1:22:53] couldn't even be called God because God
[1:22:55] means object of worship. So without
[1:22:57] anyone to worship him, he wasn't called
[1:23:00] God. He was just ll Elohim,
[1:23:02] self-existing one. Can the church say
[1:23:04] amen? So he created the angels. He
[1:23:07] created structure that man wasn't privy
[1:23:09] to because man was still in the thoughts
[1:23:11] of God. But in this form, we couldn't
[1:23:13] appreciate it. But we were there before
[1:23:15] there was a beginning.
[1:23:18] &gt;&gt; Can the church say amen? And the angels
[1:23:20] were there operating.
[1:23:26] &gt;&gt; And we look in the book of Genesis in
[1:23:28] the beginning, God created the heavens
[1:23:30] and the earth.
[1:23:32] &gt;&gt; God said, "Let there be." And God, who
[1:23:34] was his word? His word was the
[1:23:35] expression of his will. His will
[1:23:37] produced what the word was.
[1:23:39] &gt;&gt; John would say in the beginning the same
[1:23:41] parallel of Genesis to say in the
[1:23:43] beginning was the word and the word was
[1:23:45] God and the word was with God. And we
[1:23:47] know these things.
[1:23:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:51] &gt;&gt; Word speaks to nature. Last Wednesday we
[1:23:54] speaking about the nature, the divine
[1:23:56] nature. Somebody says something funny,
[1:23:58] you'll have to say that person. If every
[1:24:00] time you see somebody they say something
[1:24:02] funny, you'll say, "Well, that person is
[1:24:03] funny.
[1:24:05] That's that's right. Right. You meet a
[1:24:07] comedian. Words are powerful.
[1:24:09] &gt;&gt; The comedian speak once, twice, and
[1:24:11] everything he say is a joke.
[1:24:14] &gt;&gt; You leave with an identification of the
[1:24:16] person. Even if you don't know his name,
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; you will say that man is funny.
[1:24:20] &gt;&gt; His character becomes visible by virtue
[1:24:24] of his words.
[1:24:26] &gt;&gt; Anybody with me?
[1:24:27] &gt;&gt; When a man and every time you meet him,
[1:24:29] he talks serious serious serious. You
[1:24:30] never laugh. You You're okay. That man's
[1:24:32] a serious man, boy.
[1:24:34] Because his words
[1:24:37] express who he is
[1:24:39] &gt;&gt; and the more you speak that's why the
[1:24:40] Bible say even a fool when he is silent
[1:24:47] &gt;&gt; is considered wise
[1:24:48] &gt;&gt; because only when you open your mouth
[1:24:51] &gt;&gt; we already know who you are
[1:24:57] &gt;&gt; the old people say listen twice and talk
[1:25:03] &gt;&gt; because that's biblical. If you stay
[1:25:05] quiet, nobody will know you don't know.
[1:25:07] &gt;&gt; Nobody will know. This is why in school
[1:25:09] they say, "Don't stay quiet. Let us know
[1:25:10] you don't know." So we could give you
[1:25:11] the correction. People sit in your class
[1:25:13] and they don't know and they're saying
[1:25:14] anything.
[1:25:16] &gt;&gt; Other school teachers used to say
[1:25:17] there's big shame and small shame.
[1:25:20] &gt;&gt; He said big shame is when you write the
[1:25:22] exam and you don't know. Small shame is
[1:25:23] when they put it behind in class and say
[1:25:25] I don't know.
[1:25:27] He said, "Choose your shame."
[1:25:30] &gt;&gt; We thank God for good teachers
[1:25:32] &gt;&gt; who could bring context to things so we
[1:25:34] could appreciate things.
[1:25:36] &gt;&gt; I was sharing with my daughter. I had a
[1:25:38] math teacher. When he's standing in
[1:25:40] front of the class, he say, "Everybody
[1:25:41] like to watch television." Everybody put
[1:25:43] up your behind. He say, "Fantastic." He
[1:25:44] went on the board, draw a TV and had to
[1:25:48] do all the math inside the TV.
[1:25:52] &gt;&gt; But he had a real heart to see people
[1:25:54] learn, to see people grow. Amen.
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; And so too God in his complexity because
[1:26:02] God is big.
[1:26:03] &gt;&gt; He is complex. There are many aspects of
[1:26:05] God.
[1:26:06] &gt;&gt; It's impossible for almighty God to have
[1:26:08] expressed himself all at once. So God
[1:26:10] had to unveil himself over time.
[1:26:13] &gt;&gt; But only when he took that word became
[1:26:15] flesh and the expression of complexity
[1:26:18] was now veiled in simplicity in the
[1:26:20] person of Jesus Christ.
[1:26:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:22] And that same Jesus will say, "Let thy
[1:26:25] will be done on earth as it is in
[1:26:26] heaven." Because Jesus understands the
[1:26:29] principle that will is powerful.
[1:26:35] &gt;&gt; When a young person backslides, the
[1:26:37] issue is will.
[1:26:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:40] &gt;&gt; They want to see their will expressed.
[1:26:44] &gt;&gt; This is what I want. My will is to do
[1:26:46] this.
[1:26:49] Because when you look to Lucifer, the
[1:26:52] Bible says there was structure until
[1:26:54] Lucifer. There was there was error found
[1:26:56] in Lucifer and we call it the five I
[1:26:58] wills.
[1:27:01] &gt;&gt; I will be like the most high. I will. So
[1:27:03] what it was was an expression of will.
[1:27:06] &gt;&gt; The challenge today in society is people
[1:27:08] want their will. So there's a conflict
[1:27:10] of wills.
[1:27:16] When there's a government election, this
[1:27:17] is why the kingdom of God could have no
[1:27:19] election.
[1:27:21] &gt;&gt; Because a governmental natural election
[1:27:23] is a conflict of will, our will, if
[1:27:26] given the opportunity, would be to do
[1:27:28] this.
[1:27:29] &gt;&gt; And if given the opportunity would be to
[1:27:30] do this, it's a conflict of wills. But
[1:27:32] with God, it's only one will, his will.
[1:27:35] &gt;&gt; And when his will is established,
[1:27:37] everything is perfect. Oh, you don't
[1:27:38] hear me this morning. If his will is
[1:27:41] guiding your life, you will never find
[1:27:43] yourself in a place that God can't keep
[1:27:45] you. Can the church say amen?
[1:27:56] &gt;&gt; In a home, if the husband and the wife
[1:27:58] have two different wills, that house is
[1:28:00] a war zone.
[1:28:10] &gt;&gt; Run for cover. Hide here. Do this. Don't
[1:28:13] come in here. Why? Is a conflict of
[1:28:16] wills.
[1:28:20] &gt;&gt; Every conflict in your life is a
[1:28:22] conflict of wills.
[1:28:27] &gt;&gt; Why the bank doing so? The bank has a
[1:28:28] will. The bank say you have to do it
[1:28:30] this way, in this way, in this way, in
[1:28:31] this way.
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:28:34] &gt;&gt; But I want it to be so that your will or
[1:28:36] &gt;&gt; so. So Jesus in the garden of Gethsemane
[1:28:38] say Lord not my will
[1:28:41] &gt;&gt; but thy will be done. Amen.
[1:28:43] &gt;&gt; When you understand the principle of the
[1:28:46] will of God, then simple baby stuff like
[1:28:49] how to dress and how to act, those no
[1:28:52] longer become issues
[1:28:55] &gt;&gt; because your will should become his
[1:28:57] will.
[1:28:59] &gt;&gt; All you want to do is Lord, whatever you
[1:29:01] want from me, that's what I want. Send
[1:29:02] me, Lord, where you want me to go? I
[1:29:04] want to go. I don't care where it is. I
[1:29:06] don't care what I have to give up. Lord,
[1:29:08] not my will, but thy will be done.
[1:29:13] Amen.
[1:29:15] &gt;&gt; Thy will be done on earth as it is
[1:29:19] &gt;&gt; in heaven.
[1:29:20] &gt;&gt; Everybody with me this morning?
[1:29:23] &gt;&gt; I trust this is helping in some way.
[1:29:26] &gt;&gt; Because in this life we live in the
[1:29:28] problems we run into is when we run
[1:29:31] against the will of God.
[1:29:33] &gt;&gt; There's no example in scripture and and
[1:29:34] we talk about now perfect will and
[1:29:36] permissive will.
[1:29:38] &gt;&gt; That's this issue of wills. You end up
[1:29:40] in doing set of foolishnesses and then
[1:29:42] God still allow it to work out. But he
[1:29:43] there's a perfect will for your life.
[1:29:46] &gt;&gt; Many people run ahead of God. They try
[1:29:48] to do their own thing and then they hope
[1:29:51] it works out. That is taking risk. That
[1:29:52] is unnecessary risk. God don't take risk
[1:29:55] or no. God is the best risk manager you
[1:29:57] could ever take. He swore by himself. He
[1:30:00] didn't even get another party to the
[1:30:01] contract to ensure that what he said
[1:30:03] will come to pass. He said the first
[1:30:06] covenant man broke it. So I'm not taking
[1:30:08] any chance with no other man. I will do
[1:30:10] it myself. He swore by himself. He said
[1:30:13] in blessing I will bless thee. In
[1:30:15] multiplying I will multiply thy seed
[1:30:17] because my will will be established. And
[1:30:20] no demon, no devil, no principality, no
[1:30:23] power to come against my will.
[1:30:28] His will is to see a perfect church. His
[1:30:30] will is to see sin out of your life. His
[1:30:32] will is to see you heal from the crown
[1:30:35] of your head to the soles of his feet.
[1:30:37] And every demon that stands against the
[1:30:39] will of God, God will do it for himself.
[1:30:42] You don't hear me this morning. We pray,
[1:30:45] but God has an agenda to defend his
[1:30:47] will.
[1:30:49] &gt;&gt; Oh, you don't hear me this morning.
[1:30:52] Hallelujah.
[1:30:53] Hallelujah.
[1:30:55] That's why when you fall, you cannot
[1:30:57] stay backsliden.
[1:30:59] &gt;&gt; His will brings you back. His will lifts
[1:31:03] you up.
[1:31:04] &gt;&gt; He said, "My will." Oh, come on now.
[1:31:08] [Applause]
[1:31:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:21] &gt;&gt; The existence of heaven
[1:31:24] began with the will of God expressed
[1:31:26] through the word. Amen.
[1:31:28] &gt;&gt; The moment he willed it, the word was
[1:31:30] spoken to make it happen.
[1:31:34] &gt;&gt; It could not just remain a will. Will
[1:31:37] had to be expressed as a word
[1:31:41] &gt;&gt; because your will is what you want to
[1:31:42] see.
[1:31:44] &gt;&gt; Will is an expression of what you want
[1:31:46] to achieve.
[1:31:49] &gt;&gt; Will speaks to your intent.
[1:31:51] &gt;&gt; So God had an intent. He had a purpose.
[1:31:54] He had a motive. And he didn't leave it
[1:31:56] just as will
[1:31:58] &gt;&gt; but it became word
[1:32:00] &gt;&gt; and that word became expression.
[1:32:02] &gt;&gt; Can the church say amen?
[1:32:06] &gt;&gt; In other words, the word is God's
[1:32:07] visible thought.
[1:32:10] &gt;&gt; We say a thought brother said is a word
[1:32:12] expressed
[1:32:14] &gt;&gt; or a word is a thought expressed
[1:32:16] &gt;&gt; is a connection there because if you
[1:32:18] think it and this is why how you speak
[1:32:20] determines your future. Amen. Amen.
[1:32:23] &gt;&gt; In the Bible study, we were asking the
[1:32:25] question, who are the people in your
[1:32:28] life? Because it's not just about
[1:32:30] proximity. It's really about words.
[1:32:33] &gt;&gt; Because the people in your life could
[1:32:34] say, "Let's go to a party or let's go to
[1:32:36] a prayer meeting." Or the people could
[1:32:37] say, "You're going to make it or you're
[1:32:38] not going to make it." Or the people
[1:32:40] could say, "Keep on pressing." Or, "You
[1:32:41] don't need to do that."
[1:32:43] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:32:44] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:32:45] &gt;&gt; What Satan said to Eve was, "What did
[1:32:48] God say?
[1:32:50] &gt;&gt; Are you sure?
[1:32:52] Well, I have a different perspective. It
[1:32:53] was a conversation. So, words are
[1:32:55] important. If you are connected to the
[1:32:57] word of God about your life, forget it.
[1:33:00] Then nothing could shake you.
[1:33:02] &gt;&gt; And if you repeat the words of the Lord
[1:33:04] every day in your life, then your mind
[1:33:06] becomes honed on the word of the Lord. I
[1:33:09] shall be healed. That's what happened to
[1:33:10] the man that brother Brandon prayed for.
[1:33:12] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon prayed for the man
[1:33:15] &gt;&gt; and he came back for prayer again. And
[1:33:17] brother say, I don't need to pray for
[1:33:18] you again. I pray for you already. But
[1:33:20] he didn't have faith. And the solution
[1:33:22] to building faith was to just say it all
[1:33:24] the time. By stripes I'm healed. By
[1:33:26] stripes I'm heals. He say keep saying it
[1:33:28] over and over and over and over and over
[1:33:30] until one day it moved from an
[1:33:31] intellectual understanding of by stripes
[1:33:34] I'm healed to the word became a
[1:33:36] reflection of who he was. He and the
[1:33:38] word became one and all of a sudden he
[1:33:40] was healed.
[1:33:47] But if you live every day, but is
[1:33:48] Christianing hard and are going through
[1:33:50] a rough time and listen, when you accept
[1:33:53] rough time as part of the journey, you
[1:33:55] see beyond that, you don't make that the
[1:33:57] issue.
[1:33:58] We will never promise a bed of ease. We
[1:34:00] will never promise to have it easy. We
[1:34:02] will never promise to have a red carpet.
[1:34:07] &gt;&gt; We were promised a training ground to
[1:34:09] fight the devil. The battle is still
[1:34:11] ahead.
[1:34:14] Listen, if God wanted to end the devil,
[1:34:17] he could have done it a long time. But
[1:34:19] he refused to do it because he wants you
[1:34:20] to do it. He wants me to do it. It is
[1:34:23] his will that his wife, his bride, take
[1:34:28] possession of the earth.
[1:34:31] Why? Because the heaven is the
[1:34:33] jurisdiction of the Lord. But this earth
[1:34:36] belongs to us.
[1:34:37] &gt;&gt; It is our jurisdiction.
[1:34:40] Oh, you don't hear me this morning.
[1:34:49] [Applause]
[1:34:52] &gt;&gt; I want you to see a picture, church.
[1:34:54] &gt;&gt; Heaven is the Lord's jurisdiction. It's
[1:34:56] not ours.
[1:34:58] &gt;&gt; We're not trying to go to heaven to stay
[1:35:00] there.
[1:35:01] &gt;&gt; Because the Bible said we shall reign
[1:35:03] where?
[1:35:06] &gt;&gt; So reigning is not in heaven for us.
[1:35:07] It's on the earth. Amen.
[1:35:11] &gt;&gt; So there's a partnership because in Eden
[1:35:13] before the fall, heaven and earth was in
[1:35:15] unity.
[1:35:17] &gt;&gt; God's will was in heaven as it was in
[1:35:18] the earth.
[1:35:20] &gt;&gt; There was no need for the Lord's prayer
[1:35:22] at that time because his will was
[1:35:24] already established in heaven and on
[1:35:26] earth.
[1:35:30] &gt;&gt; It is because man fell. We need to pray
[1:35:33] thy will be done on heaven and on earth.
[1:35:35] But in Eden, there was no need for the
[1:35:37] prayer because the will of God was
[1:35:39] established in heaven and established on
[1:35:41] the earth.
[1:35:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:35:49] &gt;&gt; And we are getting back to there.
[1:35:52] [Applause]
[1:35:53] [Music]
[1:35:56] &gt;&gt; Nothing is by accident.
[1:35:58] &gt;&gt; Nothing is by chance. And when we see it
[1:36:00] through the whole picture, it begins to
[1:36:02] make sense.
[1:36:05] Hallelujah.
[1:36:06] &gt;&gt; Because in God's perfect heaven,
[1:36:11] &gt;&gt; Lucifer,
[1:36:12] &gt;&gt; a creation
[1:36:15] &gt;&gt; of the creator,
[1:36:17] &gt;&gt; express will.
[1:36:20] &gt;&gt; Boldface. Thank you punch.
[1:36:22] &gt;&gt; He boldface express will
[1:36:24] &gt;&gt; he created to worship. But he say but
[1:36:26] this thing this worship thing. Why all
[1:36:28] have to go to God?
[1:36:34] And there was war in heaven.
[1:36:36] &gt;&gt; So I want us to remember heaven isn't
[1:36:38] our jurisdiction.
[1:36:40] &gt;&gt; But as it is in heaven is on the earth.
[1:36:42] &gt;&gt; War in heaven. We were represented
[1:36:45] there.
[1:36:46] &gt;&gt; Spirits rotating off of God. We were
[1:36:49] part of the war
[1:36:50] &gt;&gt; to reclaim heaven to kick out the
[1:36:53] devil's will
[1:36:55] &gt;&gt; and reestablish God's will. You don't
[1:36:57] hear me this morning. We were
[1:36:59] represented there. When Michael drew his
[1:37:01] sword, all of the seeds who rotated off
[1:37:04] of God were there drawing their swords.
[1:37:07] We went to war for the jurisdiction of
[1:37:09] heaven. It was God and his Oh, come on
[1:37:12] now. God and his family fighting to
[1:37:15] reclaim heaven. And what did we do? We
[1:37:18] kicked the devil out of heaven. And the
[1:37:20] Bible said there was no place found for
[1:37:23] him there.
[1:37:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:37:29] Hallelujah.
[1:37:30] [Applause]
[1:37:38] &gt;&gt; What did God do?
[1:37:40] &gt;&gt; He showed the expression of his
[1:37:42] creation.
[1:37:42] &gt;&gt; He showed the power of free will,
[1:37:45] &gt;&gt; the power of the angels to decide
[1:37:47] because there were angels who sided with
[1:37:48] Lucifer and they were all kicked out of
[1:37:50] heaven.
[1:37:51] &gt;&gt; God clean house as it were.
[1:37:55] And the war of angels became the war of
[1:37:58] men.
[1:37:59] &gt;&gt; So heaven is under its correct
[1:38:01] leadership. But the earth, there's a war
[1:38:04] going on this morning.
[1:38:06] The family of God fought with Michael to
[1:38:10] reclaim heaven. Now Michael himself,
[1:38:13] has come down to fight with us to
[1:38:16] reclaim our jurisdiction. Heaven has
[1:38:19] already been sorted out. It's time to
[1:38:22] sort out the earth as it is in heaven.
[1:38:30] [Music]
[1:38:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:38:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:38:42] &gt;&gt; This is why church, the devil can't just
[1:38:45] destroy the devil. Sorry, God can't just
[1:38:47] destroy the devil like that because he
[1:38:49] don't want to.
[1:38:51] Amen.
[1:38:52] &gt;&gt; It was under Michael's leadership
[1:38:55] &gt;&gt; that it was cleared up in heaven.
[1:38:57] &gt;&gt; But on the earth now, it has to be the
[1:38:58] bride leadership
[1:39:00] &gt;&gt; because the earth belongs to his wife.
[1:39:02] &gt;&gt; So Michael supports the bride. When we
[1:39:06] were there, the bride was supporting
[1:39:07] Michael. But on the earth, this is our
[1:39:09] jurisdiction. So the angels have come to
[1:39:12] back us up. But we have to lead the
[1:39:14] charge.
[1:39:17] Anybody
[1:39:23] with me this morning?
[1:39:24] &gt;&gt; Are you seeing the picture?
[1:39:30] &gt;&gt; Let me make sure you leave with it the
[1:39:31] picture clear in Eden before the fall.
[1:39:35] &gt;&gt; Heaven, earth,
[1:39:36] &gt;&gt; perfect harmony.
[1:39:38] &gt;&gt; God could walk
[1:39:39] &gt;&gt; and say it was good.
[1:39:41] &gt;&gt; He saw the reflection of heaven and
[1:39:43] earth. He saw the order established in
[1:39:45] heaven expressed on earth. In fact, when
[1:39:48] you go through scripture, when God met
[1:39:50] Moses to give instruction about building
[1:39:52] the tabernacle, what did he do? He said,
[1:39:54] I will show you the dimensions and the
[1:39:56] structure from the blueprint I've used
[1:39:58] in heaven.
[1:40:00] &gt;&gt; You're not building it the way you want.
[1:40:02] What I want on heaven is what I want
[1:40:03] established on earth. And God met with
[1:40:05] Moses and see the wall here. I want the
[1:40:08] wall this way. And I want you to use
[1:40:09] these stones. And I want you to put the
[1:40:11] throne here. And you're going to put the
[1:40:13] holy of holies here. And you say, "This
[1:40:14] is the exact way it's in heaven. I want
[1:40:16] heaven and earth to be always connected.
[1:40:19] Heaven is my throne. The earth is my
[1:40:21] foottool. Heaven is my jurisdiction. The
[1:40:23] earth belongs to you. You shall reign on
[1:40:25] the earth, kings and priests."
[1:40:32] [Applause]
[1:40:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:40:42] Hallelujah.
[1:40:52] &gt;&gt; So the battle of angels
[1:40:55] &gt;&gt; is now the battle of men.
[1:40:59] &gt;&gt; So angels don't lead us except the
[1:41:01] mighty angel,
[1:41:03] &gt;&gt; the Lord himself
[1:41:04] &gt;&gt; because he is the head of the body. But
[1:41:07] his leadership is to put us into power
[1:41:10] &gt;&gt; because he is the great king maker
[1:41:12] &gt;&gt; because he says we are kings.
[1:41:14] &gt;&gt; We are priests.
[1:41:15] &gt;&gt; He's the king of kings. He's the lord of
[1:41:17] lords. He's the high priest of our
[1:41:19] confession. He is leading the way for us
[1:41:21] to step into the way. So you can say the
[1:41:24] spirit, the prophet and the bride will
[1:41:25] say the same thing. God is a spirit.
[1:41:27] Prophet prophets through the ages
[1:41:29] pointing to people to the same thing to
[1:41:31] bring them to our realization of what
[1:41:33] belongs to us. No other age could have
[1:41:35] claimed jurisdiction like we can.
[1:41:43] &gt;&gt; Why must I be sad
[1:41:45] &gt;&gt; and depressed and allow some movie, some
[1:41:49] show something somebody say who say they
[1:41:52] go do me and think
[1:41:59] &gt;&gt; angels are servants. You know,
[1:42:02] &gt;&gt; we are sons.
[1:42:04] &gt;&gt; Angels work for us.
[1:42:06] &gt;&gt; God does the salaries.
[1:42:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:08] &gt;&gt; But the angels are encamped
[1:42:10] &gt;&gt; around them that fear him.
[1:42:12] &gt;&gt; They can't leave. They can't move. They
[1:42:14] they know they are on assignment.
[1:42:16] Because once sons are identified, angels
[1:42:18] have to be there. The moment you were
[1:42:20] born, angels with dispatch for your
[1:42:22] protection. The moment you were born,
[1:42:24] when you leave church, it's even here.
[1:42:26] Angels in front of you, angels at the
[1:42:28] side of you. goodness and mercy
[1:42:30] following you. You are a moto kid all by
[1:42:33] yourself. You walk Frederick Street and
[1:42:36] there's a motocade around you.
[1:42:40] [Applause]
[1:42:51] I had to pass in the mall yesterday
[1:42:52] briefly
[1:42:55] and I'm passing and I see two people and
[1:42:56] I did a double take because some of you
[1:42:58] see someone in a different environment
[1:42:59] and you don't connect it at first. It
[1:43:01] was when I passed them I realized oh
[1:43:03] that is our former prime minister's wife
[1:43:05] and daughter unassuming quiet.
[1:43:10] And I said to my wife, in the US, this
[1:43:12] will never be because once you leave
[1:43:14] office, you don't lose secret service.
[1:43:17] &gt;&gt; We are real casual in this country.
[1:43:19] Maybe you're a small country, so maybe
[1:43:22] you walk the street, you see a minister,
[1:43:23] government normally just going in the
[1:43:24] car, normal, normal. In the States,
[1:43:26] you'll never see that.
[1:43:28] What kind of security
[1:43:31] when you walk out your house, if you
[1:43:33] could see the movements outside your
[1:43:36] house, when you step out the house,
[1:43:42] You see when our prime minister driving,
[1:43:44] the president driving is all kind of
[1:43:46] siren, flashing car, motorbike, they
[1:43:49] almost want to bounce you down, pull
[1:43:50] aside here and when you look is the
[1:43:51] prime minister coming down three, four,
[1:43:52] five vehicle and some motorbike and
[1:43:54] thing when you get out of your house if
[1:43:56] you see motorbike,
[1:43:57] &gt;&gt; if you see car and listen, we not like
[1:44:00] Trinidad in the States, they have plane
[1:44:01] and helicopter. You have helicopter too.
[1:44:04] &gt;&gt; Is angels dealing with it? No. Angels
[1:44:06] flying above. Air surveillance. Making
[1:44:09] sure your path clear. Turn left. Turn
[1:44:12] right. Hold here. Don't do this.
[1:44:14] Somebody just feel something. You just
[1:44:16] feel a pause. And is the angel held you
[1:44:18] back. Don't go yet. Something ahead. Not
[1:44:21] for you. Not now. Move now. Angels.
[1:44:25] Why? You're coming into power.
[1:44:31] [Music]
[1:44:34] You may be seated.
[1:44:37] &gt;&gt; In the US, once election date is over,
[1:44:40] brother Clark, the moment what they call
[1:44:42] the presidentelect is known,
[1:44:45] &gt;&gt; he not in office yet because there's a
[1:44:47] swearing in ceremony.
[1:44:49] &gt;&gt; In the spiritual realm, we call it
[1:44:50] adoption.
[1:44:52] &gt;&gt; The adoption ceremony. But before the
[1:44:54] adoption ceremony, once you are
[1:44:56] identified as president-elect, in other
[1:44:58] words, they know you are the next
[1:45:00] president. It's a few days before you
[1:45:02] take office and get a car and get a
[1:45:04] plane and move with a punch. You need to
[1:45:07] pack your things and get it into the
[1:45:09] White House. You can't just walk in
[1:45:10] today without your things. They need to
[1:45:12] prepare the room. They need to ask you
[1:45:13] what you want for breakfast. Oh, come on
[1:45:14] now. Somebody help me. What do you like
[1:45:16] for dinner? The White House chef need to
[1:45:19] get ready to prepare your favorite meal.
[1:45:21] You don't hear me this morning. But the
[1:45:23] moment the election results are in and
[1:45:25] you are identified as president-elect,
[1:45:28] your whole life changes.
[1:45:30] &gt;&gt; And the moment you are born and you are
[1:45:32] identified as predestinated,
[1:45:36] &gt;&gt; your life has never been the same.
[1:45:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:43] [Applause]
[1:45:46] &gt;&gt; I'm just going to build your feet.
[1:45:52] so that we could reach a point
[1:45:56] that we're not having baby
[1:45:58] conversations.
[1:46:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:46:03] &gt;&gt; And scriptur is like present your bodies
[1:46:05] a living sacrifice,
[1:46:07] &gt;&gt; holy and acceptable unto the Lord.
[1:46:11] &gt;&gt; When the Bible say it is your reasonable
[1:46:13] service.
[1:46:15] &gt;&gt; You know what reasonable mean?
[1:46:18] &gt;&gt; Anybody know?
[1:46:20] No big thing. Thank you, brother George.
[1:46:24] &gt;&gt; Reasonable service. The Bible say to
[1:46:26] present your bodies a living sacrifice.
[1:46:31] &gt;&gt; And people still struggling. How in
[1:46:34] 2025, brother Blackman, help me. Could
[1:46:36] covering your knees be a struggle.
[1:46:42] There's a big heart trial for you there
[1:46:44] and you're stressed out about this thing
[1:46:46] and the people in the work and you don't
[1:46:48] know what they will say and they just
[1:46:50] talk about you and
[1:46:53] it has hurt my feelings and and are you
[1:46:56] that weak
[1:47:02] &gt;&gt; and my nails and and and so go ahead
[1:47:04] make it good.
[1:47:10] So what they're telling me, God didn't
[1:47:12] do a good job.
[1:47:14] &gt;&gt; I'm trying to find with a black man a
[1:47:16] way for people to see that those are the
[1:47:18] petty things because what we're talking
[1:47:20] about is taking leadership.
[1:47:23] &gt;&gt; I shared in the youth meeting in France
[1:47:26] that the queen of England, Lord bless
[1:47:27] her soul, when she was on the earth, you
[1:47:30] never see her in a miniskirt.
[1:47:32] &gt;&gt; Search,
[1:47:34] &gt;&gt; no pants. Why?
[1:47:36] &gt;&gt; She was in the message secretly.
[1:47:40] In the night she there reading talking
[1:47:42] with books.
[1:47:47] &gt;&gt; She was very secure in her identity
[1:47:51] &gt;&gt; and she understood the principle that as
[1:47:53] a queen I dress a certain way. I speak a
[1:47:56] certain way. There are places I do not
[1:47:58] go. There are things I do not do. There
[1:48:00] are people I don't have conversation
[1:48:02] with. Not because I'm better than
[1:48:03] anybody. But I'm a queen.
[1:48:08] So her confidence and the way she lives
[1:48:11] is a function of her identity.
[1:48:15] &gt;&gt; And this is why I say the issue with us
[1:48:17] is we have an identity crisis.
[1:48:21] &gt;&gt; Because the moment you cannot stand up
[1:48:23] and say I am a Christian,
[1:48:25] &gt;&gt; there are things I do, there are things
[1:48:27] I do not do. Take this as it is. Deal
[1:48:30] with it as it is.
[1:48:33] &gt;&gt; These are the terms of the engagement.
[1:48:35] These are the terms. If you don't want
[1:48:37] me as your friend because I'm a
[1:48:38] Christian, then I'm happy to not be your
[1:48:40] friend because we can't go to the same
[1:48:43] place.
[1:48:46] &gt;&gt; How could two walk unless they are in
[1:48:48] agreement? That's scripture.
[1:48:51] [Music]
[1:48:52] &gt;&gt; And this is why I say be real church. It
[1:48:54] has to be a point. This is not just in
[1:48:56] the spiritual. You want to save, save.
[1:49:00] &gt;&gt; I'm struggling to save. I'm struggling
[1:49:02] to save.
[1:49:06] And I sure if you audit your finances
[1:49:08] and you take out one extra bag of fries,
[1:49:17] &gt;&gt; you just when they say you want to
[1:49:19] upsize, you say, "Nah, just leave it low
[1:49:20] size."
[1:49:25] I don't know what talking to. I see
[1:49:26] people getting convicted. This is not a
[1:49:29] movement against fast food,
[1:49:32] &gt;&gt; but we're talking about a principle of
[1:49:34] choice
[1:49:35] &gt;&gt; because people do what they want to do.
[1:49:38] &gt;&gt; People will say they tired, they tired,
[1:49:39] they tired, they tired for work, they're
[1:49:41] tired for work. Carnival time I see
[1:49:42] people go and fet until 4:00 in the
[1:49:44] morning and they have to be in work the
[1:49:45] next day and they bre dragging itself to
[1:49:48] work
[1:49:49] &gt;&gt; because they can't afford to miss the
[1:49:51] fat and they take a loan to go the fet.
[1:49:56] A year later, they're still paying for
[1:49:57] the
[1:49:58] &gt;&gt; fed. Jesus.
[1:49:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:50:00] &gt;&gt; We are making this up. You know, this is
[1:50:02] true thing.
[1:50:04] &gt;&gt; And people don't want to make sacrifice
[1:50:06] for the Lord because they don't see the
[1:50:08] value.
[1:50:11] &gt;&gt; When you understand the value of
[1:50:13] something, you treat something with
[1:50:15] value a certain kind of way.
[1:50:18] [Applause]
[1:50:20] [Music]
[1:50:21] [Applause]
[1:50:25] One time the Lord told the prophet, I
[1:50:28] think he was going onto the platform and
[1:50:29] he had a book and he put the book on top
[1:50:32] of the Bible. Anybody hear that one?
[1:50:34] &gt;&gt; And the Lord said, "Don't rest that on
[1:50:36] that thing." You know,
[1:50:38] &gt;&gt; my word is too val. Take that off.
[1:50:41] &gt;&gt; God is looking at it. Some of the things
[1:50:43] we do casually.
[1:50:47] Amen.
[1:50:48] &gt;&gt; Some of us don't even know where our
[1:50:49] Bible is.
[1:50:54] &gt;&gt; I say don't use the phone and iPad for
[1:50:57] quick things, but where's your Bible?
[1:51:00] &gt;&gt; Where do you store it?
[1:51:02] &gt;&gt; If the lights are off in your house,
[1:51:04] could you find it?
[1:51:07] Because if that is your best defense,
[1:51:09] cuz there are many stories of people I
[1:51:11] know home invasion and they plead the
[1:51:13] blood, Lord Jesus, help me. And the
[1:51:15] bandits don't even know what happened.
[1:51:16] They say we left. Yes. Because we don't
[1:51:17] know what we dealing with.
[1:51:21] &gt;&gt; Do you have faith in God and his word to
[1:51:23] protect you?
[1:51:25] &gt;&gt; Do you treat his word as sacred? Do you
[1:51:27] treat the house of God as sacred? Do you
[1:51:29] treat the things of God as sacred? Do
[1:51:30] you treat a service as sacred? Or you
[1:51:32] say, "Well, we going to church because
[1:51:33] we No, this is sacred. This is the
[1:51:36] pathway to get out of this world and to
[1:51:38] get to glory.
[1:51:40] &gt;&gt; We are too casual about these things and
[1:51:42] the conversations we get into like Eve
[1:51:45] is what creates the problem.
[1:51:49] &gt;&gt; Until as we said on Friday night, God
[1:51:51] had to ask, "Who told you you were
[1:51:53] naked?" God didn't tell you that.
[1:51:55] &gt;&gt; He didn't hear that on Sunday's message.
[1:51:58] &gt;&gt; Who told you you were naked?
[1:52:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:52:02] &gt;&gt; Somebody spoke to you.
[1:52:04] Somebody told you you're not good
[1:52:06] enough. Somebody telling you you're
[1:52:07] wasting time. Somebody tell you it's
[1:52:09] okay to go to the party and it's okay to
[1:52:11] dress like that and you don't need to be
[1:52:13] that kind of a Christian and that church
[1:52:15] too strict. Who told you that? Because
[1:52:17] God didn't tell us that.
[1:52:22] [Applause]
[1:52:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:52:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:52:31] &gt;&gt; I trust this helps. I'm having a
[1:52:33] conversation this morning.
[1:52:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:52:37] &gt;&gt; Because I know in heaven God's will is
[1:52:39] perfect. It's established. No angel is
[1:52:42] out of order.
[1:52:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:43] &gt;&gt; Nobody moving things around. And let me
[1:52:45] shift the throne here and this. You know
[1:52:47] what I feel in lead is not seven lamps.
[1:52:49] Let's say we move one lamb the next side
[1:52:51] of the room. No, it don't work like
[1:52:52] that.
[1:52:53] &gt;&gt; God has a divine order. He has a divine
[1:52:55] structure. He every single thing he does
[1:52:58] has a meaning. There's a purpose behind
[1:53:00] it. There's a purpose for communion.
[1:53:07] &gt;&gt; Will I in the message really take
[1:53:09] communion? What? What are you talking
[1:53:10] about?
[1:53:16] &gt;&gt; When the Bible says do this in
[1:53:19] remembrance of me, this is not brother
[1:53:21] Brandham say this.
[1:53:24] &gt;&gt; This is scripture said do this. In fact,
[1:53:27] when Peter was questioning what was
[1:53:29] going on
[1:53:30] &gt;&gt; and he said, "Lord, how you could wash
[1:53:32] my feet?"
[1:53:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:35] &gt;&gt; And Peter say, and the Lord said to
[1:53:36] Peter, "Peter, if I don't do this, you
[1:53:39] have no part of me."
[1:53:44] &gt;&gt; All years you've been with me. If you
[1:53:46] don't fulfill this, you have no part of
[1:53:50] me.
[1:53:51] &gt;&gt; When Peter heard that, he said, "Lord,
[1:53:53] don't just wash my foot. Come on.
[1:53:56] &gt;&gt; Wash everything because I want to be
[1:53:59] part.
[1:54:00] [Applause]
[1:54:06] &gt;&gt; What are you doing, preacher? Rebuilding
[1:54:08] the altar.
[1:54:10] &gt;&gt; Setting the place in order.
[1:54:12] &gt;&gt; Setting lives in order. Setting homes in
[1:54:14] order. There's a will of God for the way
[1:54:17] a home operates. There's a will of God
[1:54:19] for how fathers operate, how mothers
[1:54:22] operate, how children operate, how
[1:54:24] deacons operate, how elders operate, how
[1:54:26] ushers operate, how ministers operate,
[1:54:29] how sons and daughters of God operate.
[1:54:31] And there is no excuse for that standard
[1:54:34] because it's not our standard as it is
[1:54:36] in heaven. It is God's standard.
[1:54:41] [Applause]
[1:54:47] Thy will be done on earth
[1:54:49] &gt;&gt; as it is in heaven.
[1:54:54] &gt;&gt; There's a quote where by brother man
[1:54:55] said you can miss work but don't miss
[1:54:57] church.
[1:55:02] &gt;&gt; But we like to turn down the volume on
[1:55:04] some of these things.
[1:55:07] &gt;&gt; I say it don't have to work. I just
[1:55:08] going from the word and I'm looking at
[1:55:10] effort and balance because yes life
[1:55:12] evolves but what is your sacrifice
[1:55:14] because people sacrifice for all kind of
[1:55:15] thing.
[1:55:18] &gt;&gt; You talk long enough to brother Terren
[1:55:20] to brother George they will tell you
[1:55:21] about late coming
[1:55:24] if you give them the opportunity they
[1:55:25] will go down into it
[1:55:27] &gt;&gt; but I can guarantee you many people who
[1:55:29] come late for church not they're not
[1:55:30] late for working
[1:55:32] &gt;&gt; you know why
[1:55:34] &gt;&gt; they just write you up
[1:55:39] But George saying come on. I trying to
[1:55:40] reverse. He's saying drive.
[1:55:43] &gt;&gt; The car have two wheels here.
[1:55:49] &gt;&gt; But because people don't see
[1:55:50] consequences. The Bible said judgment
[1:55:52] begins where? Not in the party in the
[1:55:54] &gt;&gt; fetal.
[1:55:56] &gt;&gt; The Bible said judgment begins in the
[1:55:57] house of God.
[1:56:00] &gt;&gt; You have to want to become serious about
[1:56:02] this thing.
[1:56:03] &gt;&gt; This is not about the church. Brother,
[1:56:05] brother Isaac, the ministry. This is you
[1:56:07] and God wanting to do all that you could
[1:56:09] do because you want your heart right
[1:56:11] with God.
[1:56:14] I'm not trying to rebuke you. I'm trying
[1:56:16] to encourage you. Come up hither.
[1:56:18] Because that's what God said to John.
[1:56:20] Come up hither. Come up higher. I know.
[1:56:22] I know you're in trouble. I know you're
[1:56:24] on the aisle of Patmos. I know you're
[1:56:26] oppressed, but come up hither. Let me
[1:56:29] show you things that are to be. Let me
[1:56:31] show you there's a greater world. Let me
[1:56:34] show you there's more than your present
[1:56:36] circumstance. Come up hither. Come up
[1:56:38] higher. Let us climb higher.
[1:56:40] [Applause]
[1:56:44] &gt;&gt; Climb into the realm of the Holy Ghost.
[1:56:46] Till you could be in the house of God
[1:56:48] and you could say, "I'm not sitting in
[1:56:49] hellstone tabernacle. I'm seated in
[1:56:52] heavenly places with Christ Jesus."
[1:56:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:56:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:57:00] Anybody
[1:57:01] with me this morning?
[1:57:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:57:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:57:10] &gt;&gt; Glory. Glory. Glory.
[1:57:12] &gt;&gt; Wonderful.
[1:57:15] &gt;&gt; His growth, his development, his
[1:57:17] progress.
[1:57:22] &gt;&gt; There's an author Malcolm Gladwell.
[1:57:26] He wrote a few books.
[1:57:29] And one of them is a book called
[1:57:31] outliers.
[1:57:33] He did a study of successful people
[1:57:38] and across the board.
[1:57:40] Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Beth Hovind. He
[1:57:44] went across many different disciplines
[1:57:48] to try to find what is the pattern
[1:57:52] that unites them all
[1:57:55] &gt;&gt; to help them achieve success.
[1:57:57] And one of the elements that was common
[1:58:00] in every single one of these cases that
[1:58:03] became what might be called masters of
[1:58:05] their field was a principle he called
[1:58:08] 10,000 hours. He said across the board
[1:58:12] they spent at least 10,000 hours
[1:58:16] pursuing the course of the field or the
[1:58:18] study that he became masters in.
[1:58:21] &gt;&gt; And he was showing that unless you are
[1:58:24] willing to put in the effort to achieve
[1:58:28] something.
[1:58:29] &gt;&gt; This has nothing to do with degree and
[1:58:31] education.
[1:58:33] &gt;&gt; It has to do with effort towards
[1:58:35] purpose.
[1:58:37] &gt;&gt; Because I've seen many people with no
[1:58:39] education become extremely successful.
[1:58:41] But what is consistent is they put
[1:58:43] effort behind purpose.
[1:58:49] &gt;&gt; So Beth Hovind played and played and
[1:58:52] played and played until playing became
[1:58:55] his life.
[1:58:58] and you study it people because
[1:59:00] understand this we talk about the 1% and
[1:59:02] people who listen it's common people who
[1:59:05] achieve anything in life they just do
[1:59:08] more in the same time as you and I you
[1:59:10] know
[1:59:11] &gt;&gt; it is not that if Bill Gates or Elon
[1:59:13] Musk have 29 hours in the day
[1:59:16] &gt;&gt; it's the same 24 hours
[1:59:20] &gt;&gt; but what is different is how they use
[1:59:23] their day Amen.
[1:59:25] &gt;&gt; So the Bible speaks about redeeming
[1:59:27] time.
[1:59:28] &gt;&gt; How much time do you waste?
[1:59:33] &gt;&gt; Because when you look back, sometimes
[1:59:34] you only see things over trends. Months
[1:59:37] go. But wait a minute. You know, I spend
[1:59:39] an hour
[1:59:41] a day on Facebook.
[1:59:45] That is 365
[1:59:47] hours in the year.
[1:59:52] in 10 years like 3,600 some of us on on
[1:59:55] on the road to be Facebook experts.
[1:59:59] We're about to do 10,000 hours of
[2:00:01] Facebook
[2:00:02] which means 10,000 hour means you make
[2:00:04] no progress in life. You just know
[2:00:06] everything about entertainers and people
[2:00:08] who have no consequence in changing your
[2:00:10] life.
[2:00:14] &gt;&gt; All the latest gossip, the latest news,
[2:00:16] the latest thing that that that is your
[2:00:17] identity. But when you see someone who
[2:00:20] knows the message of the hour,
[2:00:23] &gt;&gt; how much hours you spending per week
[2:00:24] listening to a tape,
[2:00:27] &gt;&gt; reading a book,
[2:00:28] &gt;&gt; reading the scriptures?
[2:00:30] &gt;&gt; I tell my wife, I don't even do half the
[2:00:32] time I want to do. I'm trying to do more
[2:00:36] &gt;&gt; because I'm scratching the surface of my
[2:00:38] potential
[2:00:40] &gt;&gt; because the Bible said study to show
[2:00:42] yourself approved. That's scripture.
[2:00:44] That's not a
[2:00:48] Every single one of us supposed to be
[2:00:50] studying.
[2:00:52] &gt;&gt; It's not just the preacher. Every one of
[2:00:54] us supposed to be studying because the
[2:00:56] word is your identification.
[2:00:58] &gt;&gt; How do you know you're lining up with
[2:00:59] the word if you're not in the word?
[2:01:01] &gt;&gt; When Paul said, "Follow me as I follow
[2:01:03] Christ." What you doing to be able to
[2:01:05] mark his papers to say, "You know what?
[2:01:07] Paul is going right. So, I'm comfortable
[2:01:09] with this direction." Amen.
[2:01:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:14] &gt;&gt; The problem with many of us is laziness.
[2:01:17] &gt;&gt; I didn't want to go down the road, but
[2:01:18] dizzy road.
[2:01:19] &gt;&gt; The lazy in school, the lazy on their
[2:01:21] job. That's why I said on Friday again,
[2:01:23] we working for the man, you're working
[2:01:24] for the man. The Bible say you're
[2:01:25] working, work unto the Lord. In other
[2:01:27] words, everything you do is to the Lord.
[2:01:29] You're reading your Bible is to the
[2:01:31] Lord. You're going to your job is to the
[2:01:32] Lord. You're talking to your wife is to
[2:01:34] the Lord. Everything you do if you
[2:01:35] include him as a director and the board
[2:01:38] of your life, your life is different.
[2:01:43] &gt;&gt; We have to reframe our thinking.
[2:01:48] [Music]
[2:01:49] &gt;&gt; We're not trying to put deal with the
[2:01:51] symptoms. You go to the doctor, they
[2:01:53] say, "Well, take this tablet and it's a
[2:01:54] painkiller."
[2:01:56] There's a root cause of the problem. No,
[2:01:58] &gt;&gt; the painkiller will just deal with the
[2:02:00] pain. Where's the cause?
[2:02:01] &gt;&gt; Because we could treat pain. Pain
[2:02:03] management is a treatment. But that's
[2:02:04] not a rare thing. We want to get down to
[2:02:06] the problem. What causing the pain? If
[2:02:08] we fix the problem, you don't need
[2:02:09] painkillers anymore.
[2:02:12] &gt;&gt; God had come to bring painkillers for
[2:02:14] us. He come to remove the root cause of
[2:02:16] the problem. Take the sin out of your
[2:02:17] life. Take unbelief out of your life.
[2:02:20] &gt;&gt; So you could believe that yes, my family
[2:02:22] could be delivered. I don't care where
[2:02:24] they are now. They got to be delivered.
[2:02:28] &gt;&gt; I don't care how far they have gone.
[2:02:33] I haven't gotten there, but the context
[2:02:35] of heaven and earth, that's why when
[2:02:37] Jesus when the revelation broke upon
[2:02:40] Peter
[2:02:41] &gt;&gt; thou art in Christ,
[2:02:43] &gt;&gt; the son of living God, what was Jesus
[2:02:44] response? Flesh and blood didn't reveal
[2:02:46] this to you.
[2:02:48] &gt;&gt; But my father in heaven, he goes on, but
[2:02:49] I give you the keys.
[2:02:51] &gt;&gt; And then he taps into his original
[2:02:53] intent. Whatever you bind on earth,
[2:02:56] &gt;&gt; I'll bind in heaven.
[2:02:58] Whatever you loose on earth, I will
[2:03:00] loose in heaven. In other words, we will
[2:03:02] be in agreement. I will back up what you
[2:03:04] want. So you want to loose your son on
[2:03:06] earth, I will loose him in heaven. He
[2:03:07] will be loose. You want to be free here
[2:03:09] on earth, speak the word. I'll back it
[2:03:11] up. Heaven and earth will come to
[2:03:13] agreement again. Thy will be done on
[2:03:16] earth
[2:03:17] &gt;&gt; as it is in heaven.
[2:03:25] &gt;&gt; Is this helping anyone this morning?
[2:03:30] Hallelujah.
[2:03:34] &gt;&gt; You spend time with positive people.
[2:03:40] &gt;&gt; You will leave a bit more positive.
[2:03:44] &gt;&gt; You spend time with people who are
[2:03:46] criticizing.
[2:03:47] &gt;&gt; This is why me personally, I don't I
[2:03:49] don't even get a comment criticizing the
[2:03:51] government. And what is what's the
[2:03:53] what's the value? What is telling me
[2:03:55] what the government could do or cannot
[2:03:56] do or should do or didn't do? Am I in
[2:03:59] power?
[2:04:05] &gt;&gt; Men get in whole argument for two hours
[2:04:08] about government policy. Are you in
[2:04:09] power? Could you change the policy?
[2:04:14] &gt;&gt; Are you trying to go into government?
[2:04:18] &gt;&gt; Are you going up for election?
[2:04:20] &gt;&gt; So that whole two hours, do you really
[2:04:22] understand? They just waste time.
[2:04:27] &gt;&gt; Old talk. Thank you. But just old talk.
[2:04:28] You there for 20 and and people leave
[2:04:30] heated and blood pressure raising
[2:04:32] things. But my brother real stupid. I
[2:04:34] tell him to ting ting thing and you
[2:04:36] upset you mad because all you have
[2:04:38] political difference
[2:04:40] and you know we're closer to more money,
[2:04:42] better health, better life, better
[2:04:44] marriage, better relationship with God.
[2:04:46] Nothing that have value to your life has
[2:04:49] been strengthened
[2:04:50] &gt;&gt; except your blood pressure went up and
[2:04:51] you and your brother have to to for a
[2:04:53] month before you can talk again.
[2:04:59] &gt;&gt; You have to ask yourself the question
[2:05:00] because the Bible said add to your faith
[2:05:02] virtue and to virtue knowledge. What are
[2:05:05] you adding to your life?
[2:05:10] &gt;&gt; Because activity and productivity are
[2:05:12] two different things. This is a concept
[2:05:14] that I am baffled that people don't get.
[2:05:18] &gt;&gt; I'm working hard. I'm working hard. I'm
[2:05:19] moving files from this cabinet to this
[2:05:21] cabinet.
[2:05:22] &gt;&gt; Then I'm moving from this cabinet back
[2:05:23] to this cabinet. Nobody can tell you not
[2:05:26] you're not working or know. But you know
[2:05:27] what it is? Activity.
[2:05:30] &gt;&gt; There's no productivity.
[2:05:31] &gt;&gt; No value has been created. Nothing has
[2:05:34] been done to change the company. All you
[2:05:36] you moving files from this cabinet to
[2:05:38] this cabinet and they move files back.
[2:05:42] clock out at 3:45 because work is
[2:05:45] finishing at 4:00 and you know in
[2:05:46] Trinidad already.
[2:05:49] &gt;&gt; But Joel, don't laugh like that. Now
[2:05:55] &gt;&gt; you know in your heart of hearts that
[2:05:57] there's really not much productivity
[2:05:58] ready to place.
[2:06:01] &gt;&gt; You know some of these things I don't
[2:06:02] want to go down that road but if you
[2:06:04] really look at it and look at our days
[2:06:06] and ask yourself what did I accomplish?
[2:06:08] This is one of the reasons somebody
[2:06:10] shared with me when God would come down
[2:06:11] in the cool of the evening to talk to
[2:06:13] Adam. It was every day. It was a status
[2:06:15] report to know Adam what you did today.
[2:06:17] Which animal is your name?
[2:06:20] &gt;&gt; Let's have some fellowship.
[2:06:22] &gt;&gt; Daily fellowship around what you achieve
[2:06:24] today.
[2:06:26] &gt;&gt; Are you making progress every single
[2:06:28] day?
[2:06:30] &gt;&gt; Can you identify how you are growing?
[2:06:33] Because the word tells us add to your
[2:06:35] faith virtue, virtue, knowledge,
[2:06:36] temperance, patience. In other words,
[2:06:38] you are supposed to be making progress
[2:06:40] and God has not limited that just to
[2:06:43] spiritual things. It is in every area of
[2:06:45] your life. What have you done to get
[2:06:47] progress in your marriage,
[2:06:49] &gt;&gt; among your family, in your workplace,
[2:06:52] with your neighbor, with your job,
[2:06:54] whatever it is, are you making progress?
[2:06:55] Or when you look at your Sunday from
[2:06:57] last Sunday, recognize are in the same
[2:06:59] spot?
[2:07:03] &gt;&gt; You know why I'm sharing these things?
[2:07:05] Because there are people who know the
[2:07:06] message but their life is still a
[2:07:08] mystery. They have no progress.
[2:07:14] &gt;&gt; Is your prayer life better?
[2:07:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:07:18] &gt;&gt; Do you have more clarity on what to pray
[2:07:20] for?
[2:07:21] &gt;&gt; I told it it'll be good for us to really
[2:07:23] have a service and have people stand up
[2:07:24] and pray because I can tell a lot about
[2:07:26] your prayer life by how you pray.
[2:07:30] Somebody say Lord
[2:07:32] &gt;&gt; Lord
[2:07:34] Lord
[2:07:36] help
[2:07:41] because you don't have a you don't have
[2:07:42] a routine of prayer. So your prayer
[2:07:44] hasn't matured because we don't have
[2:07:46] exams and these things. You have exam
[2:07:47] for police, exam for account exam for
[2:07:49] doctors. Where's the exam for prayer?
[2:07:51] Where's the quality of your prayer? But
[2:07:53] Abraham said one time, you remember the
[2:07:54] story of the they had no water and the
[2:07:56] old lady came out to pray and but said
[2:07:58] the moment she put her hands up and
[2:08:00] start to pray, he say you know she was a
[2:08:02] praying woman.
[2:08:05] &gt;&gt; If you start to pray, could we tell
[2:08:06] you're a praying woman,
[2:08:08] &gt;&gt; you're a praying man just by the way you
[2:08:10] start, you say, "Oh God, help us because
[2:08:12] this whatever she pray for about to
[2:08:13] happen here today
[2:08:15] &gt;&gt; because you know there's a vial of
[2:08:17] prayer stored up because it is part of
[2:08:18] your DNA. When you wake up in the
[2:08:20] morning, you start to pray. Lord God, I
[2:08:22] thank you for waking me up this morning.
[2:08:25] Lord, this day is the day you have made.
[2:08:27] Lord, I will rejoice and be glad in it.
[2:08:30] I thank you for your provision. I thank
[2:08:32] you for food, for substance, for
[2:08:33] strength, for comfort, for peace in the
[2:08:35] midst of the storm to take me through my
[2:08:37] home. I apply the blood in the home.
[2:08:42] It's a relationship you have. You're
[2:08:44] going through the day. In the middle of
[2:08:46] the day, you take a pause. You want to
[2:08:47] get a little prayer in because you want
[2:08:49] to talk to God. It's a relationship.
[2:08:51] Lord, it's lunchtime. I had a good
[2:08:53] morning. I just thanking you for taking
[2:08:55] me through the morning. Give me strength
[2:08:56] to go through the evening. Touch my
[2:08:58] body. Touch my sister. Lord, send a
[2:09:00] revival. Lord, pour out the Holy Ghost.
[2:09:02] Touch me today, Lord. Expand my
[2:09:05] territory. Give me strength. Give me a
[2:09:07] promotion. Well, I say pray for
[2:09:08] promotion. Some of you ain't even
[2:09:10] praying for promotion. Pray for
[2:09:11] promotion. Pray for increase.
[2:09:16] [Applause]
[2:09:23] Brother said, "Ask for big things."
[2:09:32] &gt;&gt; Can the church say, "Amen."
[2:09:35] &gt;&gt; Is this helping anybody this morning?
[2:09:37] &gt;&gt; It's a different kind of service. I just
[2:09:38] feel less to have a conversation with
[2:09:40] the church.
[2:09:42] &gt;&gt; I was talking to brother Oen. and say,
[2:09:44] you know, one of the tragedies of life
[2:09:46] is, and this is because it wasn't so
[2:09:48] from the beginning,
[2:09:49] &gt;&gt; God had a design of how we want families
[2:09:52] to operate.
[2:09:54] &gt;&gt; Because the bedrock of a church start
[2:09:56] with the family unit. The first thing
[2:09:58] before there was church, it was family.
[2:10:07] &gt;&gt; Before God talked about people, the
[2:10:08] first restaurant on people was to Moses.
[2:10:10] I've heard the cries of my people. He
[2:10:12] wasn't even calling him people. until
[2:10:13] Moses. The first time we referenced
[2:10:15] church was in Matthew 16 with Peter.
[2:10:17] Before all of that, there was family.
[2:10:20] &gt;&gt; The children of Israel were by tribes
[2:10:21] and families.
[2:10:23] &gt;&gt; God wants to get inside your family.
[2:10:28] &gt;&gt; Establish a altar in your family.
[2:10:31] &gt;&gt; Whether you are one person family or a
[2:10:33] 50 person family, God wants to have a
[2:10:36] preeminence in the home.
[2:10:39] Amen.
[2:10:41] &gt;&gt; And that preeminence, that will comes
[2:10:43] and comes together as a church.
[2:10:48] &gt;&gt; So the word of God can be rightly
[2:10:50] divided in due season to provide clarity
[2:10:53] for the season and the hour as revealed
[2:10:55] through the scripture and the messenger
[2:10:57] of the hour.
[2:10:59] &gt;&gt; So that we're not moving aimlessly to
[2:11:01] and fro by every wind of doctrine, but
[2:11:03] we are rooted and grounded with the
[2:11:05] principles of the faith.
[2:11:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. See in true scripture how God was
[2:11:10] interested in every aspect of his of his
[2:11:12] disciples lives.
[2:11:13] &gt;&gt; When they had to pay taxes he say go
[2:11:15] fish and the fish was gold.
[2:11:17] &gt;&gt; God saying you have taxes to pay. I will
[2:11:20] provide that for you.
[2:11:22] &gt;&gt; Render to Caesar what is Caesars.
[2:11:24] &gt;&gt; Showing that God was not just interested
[2:11:26] in your spiritual well-being. He wants
[2:11:28] all of you to be complete.
[2:11:30] &gt;&gt; Why? Because brother Brandham said you
[2:11:32] are God's advertisement boards. When
[2:11:34] people see you, they must know that God
[2:11:36] is in your life and God is real.
[2:11:39] And you place a value to this thing that
[2:11:42] drives you to a closer relationship with
[2:11:45] God that the devil has no room. As
[2:11:47] brother Brandham said, a man can live so
[2:11:49] close to God, the devil don't know what
[2:11:50] to do with you.
[2:11:52] &gt;&gt; Can I say that again? A man can live so
[2:11:54] close to God, the devil don't even know
[2:11:56] what to do with you. He tried this and
[2:11:58] you're still standing. He tried that,
[2:12:00] you're still standing. He tried this,
[2:12:02] you're still standing. He threw this
[2:12:04] against you, you're still standing. You
[2:12:06] lose your job, you're still standing. He
[2:12:08] throwing a bit of sickness, you're still
[2:12:10] standing. Your children giving trouble,
[2:12:12] you're still standing
[2:12:14] [Music]
[2:12:16] until the devil say, "You know what? I
[2:12:17] fed up. I leave you alone. I go for
[2:12:19] somebody else because nothing I do could
[2:12:21] stop you. I can't stop his praise. I
[2:12:23] can't stop his faith." He still have
[2:12:25] faith. He still come to church. He has
[2:12:28] been through a love but nothing will
[2:12:30] separate him from the love of God in
[2:12:33] Christ Jesus.
[2:12:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:12:39] [Applause]
[2:12:40] [Music]
[2:12:44] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham speaking about
[2:12:46] ambition. God has ambition.
[2:12:48] &gt;&gt; Do you have ambition?
[2:12:50] &gt;&gt; In the school they ask you what is the
[2:12:51] ambition? What do you want to be? What
[2:12:52] do you want to achieve? But the brand
[2:12:54] said God has ambition. His ambition is a
[2:12:57] perfect church.
[2:12:58] &gt;&gt; His ambition is you on top of the
[2:13:00] mountain. His ambition is you with no
[2:13:02] sickness in your body. His ambition is
[2:13:04] you and your family is together. His
[2:13:06] ambition is you walking on the devil's
[2:13:08] neck. His ambition is you perfect.
[2:13:11] Divine love flowing through you. That's
[2:13:13] God's ambition. What is your ambition?
[2:13:16] [Applause]
[2:13:20] &gt;&gt; No wonder the prophecy we are living
[2:13:22] under our privileges.
[2:13:25] Amen.
[2:13:28] &gt;&gt; We could do more.
[2:13:30] &gt;&gt; We could do better.
[2:13:31] &gt;&gt; We could do more.
[2:13:33] &gt;&gt; We could do better.
[2:13:34] &gt;&gt; We could rearrange our schedules. We
[2:13:36] could look at our timets. We could give
[2:13:38] more to God. He said, "Seek you first
[2:13:40] the kingdom of God and his
[2:13:42] righteousness, and everything else will
[2:13:43] be added to you."
[2:13:46] [Applause]
[2:13:47] &gt;&gt; I've never found someone who put God
[2:13:49] first and God didn't bless them. Brother
[2:13:52] Brandham says that I've never seen
[2:13:53] somebody who put God first and God
[2:13:55] didn't bless them. God honors the
[2:13:57] effort. He honors the activity. He
[2:13:59] honors the sacrifice. He's not a mean
[2:14:01] God. He's not an unfaithful God. If
[2:14:04] there's one thing we know about God is
[2:14:06] great is his faithfulness.
[2:14:08] He is faithful.
[2:14:11] Everything you do for God, he takes note
[2:14:14] of it.
[2:14:17] [Applause]
[2:14:19] There's not one thing you have ever done
[2:14:21] for God he doesn't know about.
[2:14:23] &gt;&gt; But he wants more. He wants all of you.
[2:14:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:14:30] &gt;&gt; He wants his will
[2:14:32] &gt;&gt; to become your will.
[2:14:34] &gt;&gt; So like Jesus, Lord, not my will
[2:14:37] &gt;&gt; but thy will be done.
[2:14:39] &gt;&gt; So it begs us to ask the question, what
[2:14:42] is the will of God? What does God really
[2:14:45] want? Why are we even coming to church?
[2:14:48] What is God trying to achieve? Because
[2:14:49] if you are not clear
[2:14:54] in the business world, the story is told
[2:14:57] of someone walked into NASA space
[2:15:00] company and they saw a man cleaning and
[2:15:04] they say, "What what are you doing
[2:15:06] here?" And his response was, "We're
[2:15:09] about to send people to space."
[2:15:12] I want you to notice he's a cleaner
[2:15:14] &gt;&gt; but he's clear on purpose and vision. He
[2:15:17] is saying I'm here cleaning the floor.
[2:15:19] You know he say we are here because
[2:15:21] we're going to send people to space. In
[2:15:23] other words, he understands the bigger
[2:15:25] picture.
[2:15:27] &gt;&gt; He understands that the vision without a
[2:15:29] vision the people perish.
[2:15:31] &gt;&gt; That is why the Bible say write the
[2:15:32] vision to make it plain.
[2:15:35] &gt;&gt; What is the will of God concerning you?
[2:15:37] We are not Pentecostals. We are not
[2:15:39] Baptist and Methodists. We're not even
[2:15:41] message people. This is the bride of
[2:15:42] Jesus Christ. There's a will that God
[2:15:45] has for us. There's work we have to do.
[2:15:48] There's no resurrection for brother
[2:15:49] Brandham without us.
[2:15:52] &gt;&gt; Every brother and sister was gone on to
[2:15:54] be with the Lord from this church. And
[2:15:56] every church is waiting on you and I.
[2:16:01] &gt;&gt; To come to perfection,
[2:16:03] &gt;&gt; to bring on the resurrection.
[2:16:07] Amen.
[2:16:11] &gt;&gt; That's the message of the hour.
[2:16:14] &gt;&gt; So every service, every week, our faith
[2:16:16] should be growing. Our conviction should
[2:16:18] be stronger. Our attitude should be more
[2:16:21] positive. Our approach should be to cut
[2:16:23] out foolishness from our lives and say,
[2:16:25] "Lord, I want to be I want to be pure."
[2:16:28] &gt;&gt; The Lord told his own prophet, you need
[2:16:30] to be more sincere. If God can say that
[2:16:32] to the prophet, what about me?
[2:16:34] &gt;&gt; Lord, I want to be more sincere. I want
[2:16:36] to be a I want to be real. I want to be
[2:16:38] genuine. When you see me, you see a
[2:16:39] genuine a genuine walk. But the said a
[2:16:42] preacher, God don't make halfway
[2:16:43] preacher, but a preacher could be
[2:16:44] halfway. God don't make halfway.
[2:16:46] Christian, but a Christian could be
[2:16:47] halfway. Lord, help us to not be
[2:16:48] halfway. We are plenty halfway. Fathers,
[2:16:51] halfway, mothers, halfway, sons,
[2:16:52] halfway, daughters, halfway, business,
[2:16:54] halfway, all kind of thing.
[2:16:57] &gt;&gt; But heaven can't be halfway.
[2:16:59] &gt;&gt; Heaven is perfect.
[2:17:00] &gt;&gt; Everything is in its place. And we want
[2:17:03] God's will to be done on earth
[2:17:05] &gt;&gt; as it is in heaven.
[2:17:07] &gt;&gt; Can the church say amen?
[2:17:09] [Applause]
[2:17:15] &gt;&gt; Could you take some more?
[2:17:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:17:23] &gt;&gt; Before the war in heaven.
[2:17:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:17:27] that interrupted
[2:17:30] the will of God.
[2:17:35] The interruption was an interruption of
[2:17:37] will.
[2:17:42] The five
[2:17:44] I wills
[2:17:47] of the devil.
[2:17:51] You'll find that in Isaiah 12. Isaiah
[2:17:53] 14:12.
[2:17:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:17:56] How art thou fallen from heaven, oh
[2:17:58] Lucifer, son of the morning? How art
[2:18:00] thou cut down to the ground, which
[2:18:03] didest weaken the nations?
[2:18:05] For thou has said in thine heart, I will
[2:18:08] ascend into heaven.
[2:18:11] I will exalt my throne above the stars
[2:18:15] of God.
[2:18:17] I will sit also upon the mount of the
[2:18:20] congregation
[2:18:23] in the size of the north. I will ascend
[2:18:26] above the heights of the clouds.
[2:18:29] I will be like the most high.
[2:18:33] Yet thou art brought down to hell to the
[2:18:36] sides
[2:18:37] of the pit.
[2:18:39] &gt;&gt; The reason I read this is not just about
[2:18:41] will. It speaks to ambition.
[2:18:44] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:18:45] &gt;&gt; Because this was Lucifer being
[2:18:48] ambitious.
[2:18:49] &gt;&gt; And I want to present it as both a
[2:18:51] warning and to also present the contrast
[2:18:53] of the opportunity. There's nothing
[2:18:55] wrong with being ambitious,
[2:18:57] &gt;&gt; but there's such a thing as godly
[2:18:59] ambition,
[2:19:02] &gt;&gt; and there's such a thing as ungodly
[2:19:04] ambition,
[2:19:06] &gt;&gt; and I make the point very clear. I've
[2:19:07] said this in youth services many years
[2:19:09] ago. There are some jobs that are not
[2:19:11] for Christians. Amen. Amen.
[2:19:16] &gt;&gt; Because if you don't have faith to
[2:19:18] believe that God could provide, because
[2:19:20] for you to accept a job that puts you
[2:19:23] into spiritual jeopardy means you are
[2:19:26] also living in a state where you do not
[2:19:28] believe that he is Jehovah Gyra.
[2:19:31] &gt;&gt; Because as Jehovah Gyra, his
[2:19:33] responsibility is to provide.
[2:19:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. So I want to raise now because
[2:19:40] I've seen many people their struggle is
[2:19:42] because their job tied them up this way
[2:19:44] and before you know they can't see them
[2:19:46] in church anymore.
[2:19:48] &gt;&gt; And when you talk to them well I have to
[2:19:49] provide for my family and do this and
[2:19:51] there's nothing wrong with providing for
[2:19:52] your family but don't let your ambition
[2:19:55] take you away from God.
[2:19:57] &gt;&gt; You have to work to find alignment
[2:20:00] &gt;&gt; between your natural ambition, your
[2:20:02] spiritual ambition and God's ambition.
[2:20:05] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen.
[2:20:07] &gt;&gt; Because the moment you begin to have
[2:20:09] your own ambition because what the devil
[2:20:11] was saying as I will as the expression
[2:20:13] of his ambition was at war with God,
[2:20:17] &gt;&gt; you understand how ambitious he was.
[2:20:20] This here is the most ambitious being
[2:20:22] that ever lived in.
[2:20:27] &gt;&gt; I will exalt my throne above the stars
[2:20:30] of God.
[2:20:32] &gt;&gt; There's nobody has ever lived with a ter
[2:20:34] more ambitious than this.
[2:20:36] But it is the exact picture of ungodly
[2:20:39] ambition.
[2:20:41] &gt;&gt; So I want to caution us because we're
[2:20:44] living in dangerous times and people
[2:20:46] have all kinds of desires and because we
[2:20:48] live in a world of compromise. Years ago
[2:20:50] I preached a message no more excuses.
[2:20:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:20:53] &gt;&gt; We need to talk about no compromise.
[2:20:56] &gt;&gt; Because the moment you begin to
[2:20:58] compromise, you are putting yourself out
[2:21:00] of line with God's will. Amen.
[2:21:02] &gt;&gt; And this is what God saw with David that
[2:21:05] he loved a man after my own heart. He
[2:21:07] would perform all my will.
[2:21:09] &gt;&gt; Saul, King Saul, as a contrast, did his
[2:21:12] own thing
[2:21:13] &gt;&gt; on multiple occasions.
[2:21:16] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:21:18] &gt;&gt; Again,
[2:21:20] &gt;&gt; laying down as it is in heaven.
[2:21:30] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[2:21:31] Hallelujah.
[2:21:32] &gt;&gt; Glory, glory, glory, glory.
[2:21:37] &gt;&gt; I want to skip some things here because
[2:21:40] I've said so many of my so much of my
[2:21:42] notes just in under inspiration
[2:21:44] that I need to find back myself a little
[2:21:46] bit here.
[2:21:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And we talked about this
[2:21:54] that God showed Moses the
[2:21:58] God showed music. Moses the divine
[2:22:00] architecture.
[2:22:04] The divine architecture. Brothers, I
[2:22:06] think I need the microphone.
[2:22:12] The divine architecture.
[2:22:15] So what Moses was doing was not
[2:22:20] defined by his own idea, but it was
[2:22:22] God's master plan.
[2:22:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:22:25] &gt;&gt; It was God's design that Moses was
[2:22:27] responsible to sort out.
[2:22:30] &gt;&gt; Can the church say amen?
[2:22:32] &gt;&gt; It was heaven's architecture
[2:22:35] &gt;&gt; using earthly material.
[2:22:38] &gt;&gt; Can the church say amen?
[2:22:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. So again, we see God's interest
[2:22:43] into how our family is structured, how
[2:22:46] our homes are structured, and how our
[2:22:49] lives are structured.
[2:22:50] &gt;&gt; One second.
[2:22:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:23:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:23:16] Hallelujah.
[2:23:24] Hallelujah.
[2:23:36] Glory. Amen.
[2:23:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:23:48] &gt;&gt; Isaiah 6 and verse one.
[2:23:51] In the year that King Uzziah died,
[2:23:55] I saw also the Lord sitting upon a
[2:23:57] throne high and lifted up, and his
[2:23:59] trained
[2:24:01] filled the temple.
[2:24:03] And it stood, and in it stood the
[2:24:05] seraraphims. Each one had six wings.
[2:24:07] With twain he covered his face, with
[2:24:09] twain he covered his feet, and with
[2:24:11] twain he did fly.
[2:24:13] &gt;&gt; And one cried unto another and said,
[2:24:15] "Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts.
[2:24:18] The whole earth is full of his glory.
[2:24:21] And the post of the door moved at the
[2:24:23] voice of him that cried, and the house
[2:24:24] was filled with smoke. Then said, I,
[2:24:28] "Woe is me, for I am undone, because I'm
[2:24:30] a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in
[2:24:33] the midst of a people of unclean lips,
[2:24:37] for mine eyes have seen the king, the
[2:24:40] Lord of hosts." Hallelujah.
[2:24:42] &gt;&gt; Then flew one of the seraraphims unto
[2:24:44] me, having a live coal in his hand,
[2:24:46] which he had taken from the tongues from
[2:24:48] off the altar.
[2:24:50] &gt;&gt; And he laid it upon my mouth, and said,
[2:24:52] Lo, this hath touched thy lips, and
[2:24:54] thine iniquity is taken away, and thy
[2:24:56] sin purged.
[2:24:59] Also I heard the voice of the Lord,
[2:25:00] saying, Whom shall I send and who will
[2:25:02] go for us? Then said, I here am I,
[2:25:06] &gt;&gt; send me.
[2:25:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. And this was Isaiah having an
[2:25:10] experience and we have preached on this
[2:25:12] before that he was leaning on King
[2:25:15] Uzziah.
[2:25:16] And when the man he was leaning on was
[2:25:18] no longer there, he found himself in the
[2:25:21] temple and something opened up to him a
[2:25:26] vision beyond what was physically in
[2:25:28] that realm that he was in. He got a
[2:25:30] preview, a taste, a shadow of the throne
[2:25:35] room itself.
[2:25:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. speaking to the fact that within
[2:25:39] the context of that experience, God was
[2:25:41] showing him that there is a higher
[2:25:44] calling. There's a order that is
[2:25:45] established. And as he was standing
[2:25:48] there, he could not help himself. This
[2:25:51] was a prophet, but in the presence of
[2:25:53] the throne room,
[2:25:56] something came over him
[2:25:58] &gt;&gt; and he started to see himself different.
[2:26:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. Before that experience, he may
[2:26:03] have felt comfortable in his identity
[2:26:05] and his mission and his ministry and his
[2:26:07] calling. But the moment as he got
[2:26:10] closer, he started to look at himself.
[2:26:13] And then he realized, war is me. He
[2:26:15] said, I am I am undone.
[2:26:19] &gt;&gt; In other words, I thought I was fine
[2:26:21] until I came into the presence of the
[2:26:23] Lord.
[2:26:25] &gt;&gt; The presence of the Lord made me aware
[2:26:27] of things about myself that I did not
[2:26:30] realize. And that should be the impact
[2:26:33] of every single service we come to. That
[2:26:35] when we come into the presence of God,
[2:26:37] it makes us realize, wait a minute. I'm
[2:26:40] not even looking at my brother or my
[2:26:42] sister. But Lord, woe is me. I'm I'm I'm
[2:26:45] undone. I'm I'm I'm incomplete. I'm not
[2:26:47] finished. There's something wrong with
[2:26:49] me when I'm in the presence of the Lord.
[2:26:51] Lord, I need some fixing.
[2:26:53] &gt;&gt; Lord, I need a touch. I need something
[2:26:55] to come over me because the very
[2:26:57] presence of God, the throne room of God,
[2:27:00] the seraraphims, the cherubims, the the
[2:27:02] structure to see everything laid out in
[2:27:05] a certain way has me feeling somehow.
[2:27:07] And when I come to the presence of God,
[2:27:08] I realize, listen, Lord, I'm undone.
[2:27:12] &gt;&gt; If when you come to the house of God, it
[2:27:15] doesn't make you feel that way, you need
[2:27:16] to get closer to God.
[2:27:18] &gt;&gt; Because when Isaiah was a apart away
[2:27:21] from him, he didn't feel that way. But
[2:27:23] every step he took that was closer and
[2:27:26] closer and closer. He started to see
[2:27:29] himself.
[2:27:30] &gt;&gt; The very light of the presence of God
[2:27:32] came upon him
[2:27:35] &gt;&gt; and he wanted more.
[2:27:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:27:38] &gt;&gt; I'm a man of unclean lips. Here's a
[2:27:40] prophet saying, "I'm a man of unclean
[2:27:41] lips." Why? Why the reference of unclean
[2:27:44] lips? Because we are going back to
[2:27:45] spoken word.
[2:27:47] What comes out of our mouth is
[2:27:50] important.
[2:27:51] What we say is important.
[2:27:54] &gt;&gt; Life and death is in the power of the
[2:27:56] tongue.
[2:27:57] &gt;&gt; We cannot just speak any way we want to
[2:27:59] because our words have an impact on our
[2:28:02] destiny. Words have an impact on how we
[2:28:04] feel. Words have an impact on where we
[2:28:06] go. Words have an impact on what we do.
[2:28:09] Words have an impact on other people.
[2:28:11] This is why the prophet would say to us,
[2:28:12] the three most powerful words you could
[2:28:14] say to anybody is God bless you.
[2:28:17] Because when you say the words God bless
[2:28:19] you, you are speaking life into someone.
[2:28:22] &gt;&gt; You couldn't walk in and pass shape. No.
[2:28:24] Say God bless you to them. Because that
[2:28:26] declaration puts you in a channel. Put
[2:28:28] it it's it's saying things. This is why
[2:28:30] the prophet would say if you cast
[2:28:32] something good, don't say nothing at
[2:28:33] all. Because words create
[2:28:38] &gt;&gt; the world that we see. The expression of
[2:28:40] this world that we see
[2:28:44] &gt;&gt; is created by the spoken word.
[2:28:47] &gt;&gt; God didn't come and physically put stars
[2:28:49] into place. His word put it in place.
[2:28:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:28:54] &gt;&gt; And we are going back to spoken word.
[2:28:58] &gt;&gt; Back to the beginning.
[2:28:59] &gt;&gt; Adam could speak and what he spoke was
[2:29:01] created. Adam could do and whatever he
[2:29:04] said was going to take place. That's
[2:29:05] what we are coming to. Amen.
[2:29:07] &gt;&gt; That's why the prophet will say right
[2:29:08] now we lay hands on the sick but when
[2:29:10] that time come we'll command the devils
[2:29:12] to leave
[2:29:13] &gt;&gt; because there's a power coming into the
[2:29:15] church to bring us back to the spoken
[2:29:16] word. And that's why our character our
[2:29:18] nature has to season out and becomes
[2:29:20] mature because if we start to say
[2:29:22] foolishness, God can't trust us with
[2:29:24] that. Can the church say amen? So it
[2:29:26] brings us a sensitivity to only say what
[2:29:29] God wants say and to be very careful to
[2:29:31] speak the things that God once said. Can
[2:29:33] the church say amen? Glory.
[2:29:36] Hallelujah.
[2:29:38] &gt;&gt; Glory. Glory. Glory. Glory.
[2:29:41] Hallelujah.
[2:29:42] &gt;&gt; I'm getting ready to wind down. The
[2:29:44] musicians can get ready.
[2:29:55] &gt;&gt; God's will.
[2:30:05] When Jesus was on the earth, they asked
[2:30:07] him,
[2:30:08] &gt;&gt; "Where is the kingdom?"
[2:30:13] And what did Jesus say?
[2:30:15] &gt;&gt; Kingdom of heaven is within you.
[2:30:19] &gt;&gt; Heaven already on the earth.
[2:30:22] This word we preach is already heaven in
[2:30:24] word form, seed form. Amen.
[2:30:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:30:27] &gt;&gt; Come into life that there could be an
[2:30:28] alignment of will.
[2:30:31] &gt;&gt; My prayer this morning for each one of
[2:30:33] us is that our will would come to an
[2:30:36] end.
[2:30:37] &gt;&gt; And his will will take over.
[2:30:40] &gt;&gt; Have you been living outside of the will
[2:30:42] of God?
[2:30:44] &gt;&gt; Listen friends, us having activities
[2:30:47] doesn't change the fact that you have to
[2:30:49] align with the will of God.
[2:30:51] &gt;&gt; Because the will of God is your daily
[2:30:53] life. You want to live in his will every
[2:30:57] day.
[2:30:59] &gt;&gt; There's only so much we could do,
[2:31:02] &gt;&gt; but it must be your desire.
[2:31:05] &gt;&gt; Jesus himself had to pray
[2:31:08] &gt;&gt; in the garden of Gethsemane
[2:31:10] &gt;&gt; and wrestle.
[2:31:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:31:12] &gt;&gt; And the Bible said his sweat was like
[2:31:13] blood
[2:31:14] &gt;&gt; as he was dealing with the crisis of his
[2:31:17] will versus God's will. That's the
[2:31:20] crisis we all have to go through because
[2:31:22] we have to deal and bring our will under
[2:31:24] subjection.
[2:31:25] &gt;&gt; Whatever our will tells us to do, is it
[2:31:28] God's will? If not, my will has to die.
[2:31:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:31:34] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "Lord, if it's possible, let
[2:31:36] this cup pass."
[2:31:39] &gt;&gt; In other words, this is a is a hard
[2:31:41] thing,
[2:31:42] &gt;&gt; but nevertheless, not my will
[2:31:45] &gt;&gt; but thy will be done.
[2:31:48] Just as his father David did the will of
[2:31:50] God. Here was seed of David saying Lord
[2:31:53] not my will. My will. I have a will. I'm
[2:31:55] not saying you don't have a will. I'm
[2:31:57] saying your will has to come under
[2:31:58] subjection to the will of God.
[2:32:01] &gt;&gt; Your ambitions have to come under
[2:32:03] subjection to the will of God. Your
[2:32:05] human desires have to come under
[2:32:07] subjection to the will of God. The
[2:32:09] things you want to do, like to do, hope
[2:32:12] to do have to come under subjection to
[2:32:14] the will of Almighty God. When you don't
[2:32:16] feel like praising and that is your
[2:32:18] will, you bring that will under
[2:32:20] subjection and say nevertheless not my
[2:32:23] will but thine and be done I will praise
[2:32:25] God anyhow because his will is that we
[2:32:28] are worshippers. His will is that we
[2:32:30] praise.
[2:32:34] Friends, if it is up to our will, we
[2:32:36] wouldn't pray every day. But we bring
[2:32:38] our will under subjection because the
[2:32:41] will of God is men ought to pray and not
[2:32:43] to faint. So we bring our will on the
[2:32:46] subjection. It is our will for our own
[2:32:49] nature to be expressed but is God's will
[2:32:52] to give us a divine nature.
[2:32:55] So we bring our will under subjection.
[2:32:59] He said you must bring your body to obey
[2:33:01] your confession. So what we are speaking
[2:33:03] about is the confession of God's will
[2:33:05] because God's will is to see this body
[2:33:07] come under subjection of the leadership
[2:33:10] of the Holy Ghost that the will of God
[2:33:12] to be expressed.
[2:33:14] Are we together? Are we here this
[2:33:16] morning?
[2:33:28] &gt;&gt; So God has will and his wills and the
[2:33:30] devil has his will. They're only two. We
[2:33:32] preach it as two influences, but it's
[2:33:33] really wills.
[2:33:35] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[2:33:37] &gt;&gt; And Satan knows he can't do anything in
[2:33:39] heaven.
[2:33:41] &gt;&gt; We establish this. We knows. He knows he
[2:33:43] can't do everything in anything in
[2:33:44] heaven. In fact, we read the quote on
[2:33:47] Wednesday night. The devil knows more
[2:33:48] than theologians. The devil knows that
[2:33:51] if Oh, come on now. That Jesus Christ is
[2:33:53] the same yesterday, today, and the devil
[2:33:55] knows this.
[2:33:56] &gt;&gt; Do you know? Do you know? Do you
[2:33:58] believe? Because the devil believes and
[2:33:59] the devil trembles.
[2:34:00] &gt;&gt; So, the devil knows that because he is
[2:34:02] the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[2:34:03] If you get into the will of God, there's
[2:34:06] nothing will stand before you all the
[2:34:07] days of thy life. As I was with Moses,
[2:34:10] so I shall be with thee. Hallelujah.
[2:34:13] [Applause]
[2:34:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:34:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:34:18] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[2:34:20] &gt;&gt; The expression of the will of God. The
[2:34:22] same way the son was an expression of
[2:34:24] the will through the word is the same
[2:34:26] way you are an expression of God. The
[2:34:28] will of God through the word of God. You
[2:34:30] are standing here. You are not keeping
[2:34:32] yourself. You cannot keep yourself. You
[2:34:35] cannot preserve yourself. Hallelujah.
[2:34:38] The word of God itself is powerful to
[2:34:40] preserve you. And the spirit of God is
[2:34:42] hovering over the word seed in your
[2:34:44] soul.
[2:34:47] And when your will aligns with God will
[2:34:50] when two omnipotent meets then the
[2:34:52] miraculous must take place. They were in
[2:34:55] the upper room dry seeds waiting for the
[2:34:57] rain to fall. They were under
[2:34:59] expectation their will. They were you in
[2:35:01] one mind. They were in one accord. They
[2:35:03] had one purpose. They were in one will.
[2:35:06] They were in one mind. They were in one
[2:35:07] accord. They had one objective. They had
[2:35:10] one purpose. But the Brandham said if we
[2:35:12] could get the people into one mind into
[2:35:14] one accord into one purpose into one
[2:35:17] will then in 5 minutes there'll be not a
[2:35:19] feeble person in the building. You don't
[2:35:21] hear me this morning. In 5 minutes every
[2:35:24] sick person in this room would be healed
[2:35:26] if we could align our will with his will
[2:35:29] in one mind in one accord in one purpose
[2:35:32] in one objective. Every female condition
[2:35:35] will be dissolved in 5 minutes if we are
[2:35:38] in one mind, one purpose, one will. His
[2:35:41] will is healing. My will is healing.
[2:35:43] Lord, let the healings begin.
[2:35:46] His will is deliverance. My will is
[2:35:48] deliverance. Let the deliverance begin.
[2:35:51] Can the church say, "Amen. His will is
[2:35:53] joy. My will is joy." Then let joy break
[2:35:56] forth because the joy of the Lord is our
[2:35:58] strength. Brother Brandham said, "God
[2:36:00] wants to give you the Holy Ghost more
[2:36:02] than you want to receive it." So his
[2:36:04] will is to give you the Holy Ghost, is
[2:36:06] that your will to receive the Holy
[2:36:08] Ghost? Because if his will is to give
[2:36:10] you the Holy Ghost and your will is to
[2:36:12] receive the Holy Ghost, when two
[2:36:14] omnipotent Oh, come on now. When two
[2:36:16] omnipotent meets, then the miraculous,
[2:36:19] the miraculous has got to take place,
[2:36:21] the Holy Ghost has enough power to
[2:36:24] change your being. I'm saying it's going
[2:36:26] to come up hither. Let us combine wills
[2:36:28] this morning. If two shall agree, if two
[2:36:31] shall get into the same will, if two
[2:36:34] shall agree, touching anything,
[2:36:39] &gt;&gt; hallelujah.
[2:36:41] Hallelujah. They are sick among us that
[2:36:44] if we agree, if we agree today, if we
[2:36:47] agree right now, if we come into one
[2:36:49] mind, I want to call. I believe in my
[2:36:51] heart that the angel of the Lord could
[2:36:53] move to better you where he is right
[2:36:55] now. Oh, you don't hear me this morning.
[2:36:57] The same God we serve, Satan knows. He's
[2:37:00] the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[2:37:02] Do you know that God is the same
[2:37:04] yesterday, today, and forever? And his
[2:37:06] will is to not leave you incomplete. His
[2:37:09] will is not to leave you defeated. His
[2:37:11] will is not to leave you sick. His will
[2:37:13] is not to leave you depressed.
[2:37:18] One 91 accord. One mind one accord. You
[2:37:22] have back pain. We come against the back
[2:37:24] pain. God's will is to heal you.
[2:37:27] Female condition, yes. Cancer, yes. High
[2:37:31] blood pressure, yes. Ivate what it is.
[2:37:33] God's will is to heal. Healing is the
[2:37:36] children's bread. Joy, the Holy Ghost,
[2:37:39] deliverance, the power of sin, the power
[2:37:41] of Satan, Satan, the blood of Jesus is
[2:37:45] against you.
[2:37:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:37:50] Hallelujah.
[2:37:52] Hallelujah.
[2:37:54] Hallelujah.
[2:37:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:37:58] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[2:37:59] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[2:38:01] Hallelujah.
[2:38:03] &gt;&gt; Once more, Lord. Once more, Lord. Once
[2:38:06] more, Lord. One mind, one accord. One
[2:38:09] purpose, one objective. If we want the
[2:38:11] revival, we can make it happen. If we
[2:38:13] want the Holy Ghost, we can make it
[2:38:15] happen. You want a move of the spirit,
[2:38:17] yes, it can happen because God wants to
[2:38:19] do it. He's looking for somebody who
[2:38:21] digs a valley full of dishes. Once you
[2:38:23] do something, it speaks of your will,
[2:38:25] what you want to see. You want to see
[2:38:27] revival, then let's make ready for it.
[2:38:29] You want the Holy Ghost, make ready for
[2:38:31] it. You want healing, make ready for it.
[2:38:34] God is in position. God is in position.
[2:38:37] Let's get into position. God is ready.
[2:38:40] Get ready.
[2:38:45] [Applause]
[2:38:47] Oh Lord, Lord, it's me and standing in
[2:38:50] need of prayer. Lord, I'm undone. I'm
[2:38:52] incomplete, but I'm not leaving here.
[2:38:55] I'm not leaving here until I get a
[2:38:56] breakthrough. God, I've been struggling
[2:38:58] with this. I've been struggling with
[2:38:59] that, but today is my day. May you move
[2:39:02] upon me as never before. Father, I put
[2:39:04] aside my will. I put aside my feelings.
[2:39:07] I put aside how I feel, what it might
[2:39:09] be, but today is my day.
[2:39:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:39:15] Hallelujah.
[2:39:17] Hallelujah.
[2:39:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:39:20] Hallelujah.
[2:39:22] Hallelujah.
[2:39:24] &gt;&gt; Glory. Glory. Glory. Glory. Somebody's
[2:39:27] going to go free today. Somebody's going
[2:39:29] to go free today. Yes. Yes. Yes. That
[2:39:31] demon have been holding you. Today is
[2:39:33] the last day. The Egyptians you see
[2:39:36] today, you will see them no more
[2:39:37] forever. The will of the people under
[2:39:40] Moses have come to a crossroad. God
[2:39:43] said, "Speak and move forward. Why cry
[2:39:46] unto me? Speak and move forward. I'm
[2:39:48] done crying this morning. Crying time is
[2:39:51] over. We are speaking this morning and
[2:39:54] we are moving forward. The time to cry
[2:39:56] about your problems is over. Let's speak
[2:39:58] to your problems and let's move forward.
[2:40:00] Let's speak to your problems. Speak on
[2:40:03] your children this morning. Speak on
[2:40:05] your home today. Speak over your
[2:40:07] sickness today. By his stripes, I am
[2:40:10] healed. Not will be healed. I am healed.
[2:40:13] I am healed. He already did it. He's not
[2:40:16] now healing. He already did the healing.
[2:40:19] Receive your healing. Receive the Holy
[2:40:21] Ghost. Receive your freedom. Sin is has
[2:40:25] no power against the living God.
[2:40:31] May the will of God drop down in this
[2:40:33] room. May the will of God drop down in
[2:40:36] your home. May the will of God drop down
[2:40:38] in your marriage. May the will of God
[2:40:40] drop down in your family. May the will
[2:40:42] of God drop down in your business, on
[2:40:44] your job, wherever you go. Thy will be
[2:40:48] done on earth as it is in heaven. We
[2:40:51] give the Lord permission today to move
[2:40:54] freely. Lord, move things around. Lord,
[2:40:57] shake things up. Lord, move things out
[2:40:59] of place. Put things into position.
[2:41:02] Hallelujah.
[2:41:06] Hallelujah.
[2:41:08] Hallelujah.
[2:41:10] Hallelujah. Come on, John. John is the
[2:41:13] tap of the bride. Come on, John. Come up
[2:41:14] here. Come on, rise a little higher. Let
[2:41:17] your faith rise higher. Let your faith
[2:41:19] climb this morning. Lift up your hands.
[2:41:22] Talk to the Lord. Lift up your hands.
[2:41:24] Worship him. Stand to your feet. Let's
[2:41:26] give the Lord a shout of praise. Let's
[2:41:29] talk to the Lord. Tell him what you
[2:41:31] want. Speak to him this morning. Jesus
[2:41:34] on the main line. Tell him what you
[2:41:36] want. You need the Holy Ghost. Tell him
[2:41:39] what you want.
[2:41:49] Wonder
[2:42:04] &gt;&gt; you could begin to play something
[2:42:06] softly.

[2:44:26] The one to direct us.
[2:44:28] He is setting an order for the coming of
[2:44:30] the Lord.
[2:44:32] [Music]
[2:44:33] We didn't make an altar call, but there
[2:44:35] are people at the altar.
[2:44:38] He is doing the work this morning. He is
[2:44:41] breaking self-will, breaking will,
[2:44:45] breaking your desires.
[2:44:47] Allow him to perform surgery.
[2:44:50] Yes. Yes. Yes. Allow him to perform
[2:44:52] surgery this morning. Allow him. He say,
[2:44:54] I stand at the door and knock. If anyone
[2:44:57] opens up, I'll come in and perform
[2:44:59] surgery.

[2:45:13] Lord?
[2:45:15] &gt;&gt; Oh, make him know. Let him know. Let him
[2:45:17] know. Lord, I want you.
[2:45:20] Oh, more than ever before.
[2:45:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:45:23] &gt;&gt; More than ever before. More than ever
[2:45:26] before. More than ever before. Make your
[2:45:30] altar where you want this morning.
[2:45:34] &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. All over the
[2:45:37] building.
[2:45:39] [Music]
[2:45:41] Oh, he's moving from person to person.
[2:45:46] &gt;&gt; He's moving from person to person.
[2:45:50] &gt;&gt; Don't you leave the same way you came
[2:45:52] today.
[2:45:54] Oh hallelujah.
[2:45:56] Glory. Glory. Glory. Glory. Glory.
[2:45:58] Glory.
[2:46:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:46:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:46:08] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory.
[2:46:10] [Music]
[2:46:21] I want to be more like you.
[2:46:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:46:30] &gt;&gt; I want to be a vessel.
[2:46:33] You walk through.
[2:46:35] I
[2:46:38] want to be more.
[2:46:42] Make this your prayer today. Oh,
[2:46:46] I
[2:46:48] I want to be
[2:46:55] &gt;&gt; Jesus.
[2:46:56] [Music]
[2:46:58] &gt;&gt; Come on, young people.
[2:47:02] &gt;&gt; Come on, young people.
[2:47:04] Let the Lord hear you. Say the words.
[2:47:09] I want to be a
[2:47:13] &gt;&gt; judgment is hanging over the world,
[2:47:17] but there's mercy here this morning.
[2:47:20] The throne of God is a judgment seat,
[2:47:23] but there's blood on the throne.
[2:47:26] There's mercy this morning. If you want
[2:47:29] mercy, you can receive mercy. It will
[2:47:32] not be mercy forever,
[2:47:34] but there's mercy this morning.
[2:47:38] Lord, I want to be more like you. Lord,
[2:47:41] I want to be more like you. Come on,
[2:47:43] mama. Come on, papa. Catch a burden.
[2:47:49] This may be the last service for
[2:47:50] somebody.
[2:47:52] This may be the last time of grace for
[2:47:55] someone. We don't know.
[2:47:58] But take advantage.
[2:48:02] If you're a backslider, I invite you. I
[2:48:05] invite you. Come for restoration.
[2:48:08] If you've been living wayward, I invite
[2:48:10] you. Don't leave the service the same
[2:48:12] way you came. The angel of the Lord is
[2:48:15] here. The Lord Jesus himself, every head
[2:48:18] bowed, every eye closed, all over the
[2:48:20] building in reverence.
[2:48:22] God is dealing with situations. He's
[2:48:25] dealing with homes. He's dealing with
[2:48:27] individuals.
[2:48:32] Oh, I
[2:48:36] want to be more
[2:48:39] of me more
[2:48:43] in the presence.
[2:48:48] &gt;&gt; That's what Isaiah felt
[2:48:51] of.
[2:48:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:48:58] [Music]
[2:49:07] Maybe you have been casual about God.
[2:49:10] You have taken this thing for granted.
[2:49:14] [Music]
[2:49:16] Woe is me. Lord, forgive me.
[2:49:20] [Music]
[2:49:22] Forgive me for being casual. Forgive me
[2:49:24] for taking it lightly, Lord.
[2:49:28] [Music]
[2:49:30] but in your presence.
[2:49:32] &gt;&gt; Lord, I need more of Jesus.
[2:49:34] [Music]
[2:49:37] &gt;&gt; Every head bow, every eye closed.
[2:49:41] Almighty God.
[2:49:45] Lord, your word has gone forth.
[2:49:48] Lord, with the message you give for
[2:49:50] today,
[2:49:53] Lord, we see souls at the altar through
[2:49:56] the building. Lord, tears,
[2:50:00] prayers, cries,
[2:50:03] people reflecting on Lord, as Isaiah
[2:50:06] would have done as he came into the
[2:50:09] presence and as he came closer to the
[2:50:12] throne, he said, "Lord, I I need more. I
[2:50:15] cannot live this way. May this presence
[2:50:18] be upon each brother, every sister, even
[2:50:21] those connected online. May the presence
[2:50:23] move into the room where they may be.
[2:50:25] Lord, may the presence surround each
[2:50:27] one. Lord, may the presence move into
[2:50:29] each one. Lord, love is not a feeling.
[2:50:32] Love is a person. And Lord, we feel the
[2:50:34] divine presence of love in the building
[2:50:36] this morning with mercy moving through
[2:50:38] the camp because it is not your desire,
[2:50:40] not your will that none should be lost,
[2:50:42] but you sent a prophet, a message,
[2:50:44] grace. Lord, in this day and age,
[2:50:47] Father, that we could be called higher
[2:50:49] like John, a type of the bride to come
[2:50:51] up hither into the realm of the
[2:50:53] heavenly, we could sit in heavenly
[2:50:55] places, Father. Lord, may you forgive
[2:50:58] our past,
[2:51:00] forgive our casualness,
[2:51:03] forgive our lack of sincerity,
[2:51:05] forgive us for what we have taken
[2:51:07] granted, Lord, we have taken for
[2:51:09] granted, Lord, forgive us, Lord. And
[2:51:12] Lord, may you do a work here today among
[2:51:14] your people, Lord. May you touch each
[2:51:16] one, Father. Lord, there are needs in
[2:51:19] the place. We pray for Lord this prayer
[2:51:22] request from brother Barry for Lord Aira
[2:51:24] and Ethan down with the coal Lord that
[2:51:27] you would heal them completely Father
[2:51:30] and Lord for his wife Lord for strength
[2:51:33] Lord for the journey that you would
[2:51:35] touch her also and Lord for all the
[2:51:37] different requests in the church this
[2:51:39] morning Lord we pray for the cases the
[2:51:42] harder cases we pray for the you father
[2:51:45] who just celebrated a birthday Lord the
[2:51:47] grace of God in his life and how the
[2:51:49] enemy is trying to cut him off, Lord.
[2:51:51] But Satan, we come against you. We are
[2:51:54] united today. We unite in faith. We
[2:51:57] unite as one. We unite as a people, our
[2:52:00] will, God's will, one will for a
[2:52:02] complete healing. May you touch your
[2:52:04] son. May you touch your deacon even now.
[2:52:06] May the Holy Ghost move upon brother
[2:52:08] Hugh. May you touch brother Terren. And
[2:52:11] Lord, that eyesight, Father. The devil
[2:52:13] had no right to touch his eyes. Satan,
[2:52:16] take out your hands from in the name of
[2:52:19] Jesus. May healing touch your servant,
[2:52:22] Lord, with a Ashby, Lord, Sister Donna
[2:52:24] K. Every situation in the tabernacle,
[2:52:27] every condition, Lord, in the building
[2:52:29] with a Clarence, everyone with a need,
[2:52:31] Lord, every one with need of physical
[2:52:33] healing in the mighty name of Jesus
[2:52:36] Christ. Father, Lord, we unite in faith
[2:52:39] as a church. You said if two shall agree
[2:52:41] touching anything, we could have what we
[2:52:43] ask for. Lord, many in the building,
[2:52:45] Lord, they have family that's out there
[2:52:47] that loved ones that have backsliden,
[2:52:49] but Lord, we want to unite in faith as a
[2:52:51] church, Lord, for a restoration of every
[2:52:54] family member. Lord, of every
[2:52:56] backslider, Lord, there's seeds in their
[2:52:59] hearts, but the enemy tried to cut them
[2:53:01] off. But Lord, you said, "My sheep know
[2:53:03] my voice, and of strangers, they would
[2:53:05] not follow." Lord, we plead the blood
[2:53:08] upon them. We send the blood hound of
[2:53:10] the Holy Ghost after them to arrest
[2:53:12] them. If you could speak for Lazarus who
[2:53:14] was dead to come back to life. We could
[2:53:17] speak this morning for the backsliders
[2:53:19] to be completely delivered. May you
[2:53:22] break every chain. May you break every
[2:53:24] shackle
[2:53:27] Lord for the young people
[2:53:30] Lord who have their struggles but more
[2:53:33] than that they have not made a decision
[2:53:35] a real decision to serve you with
[2:53:38] everything. Father, Lord, gay you may
[2:53:40] you give them the strength to decide
[2:53:43] because Lord, the blessings could only
[2:53:45] follow the decision. When Ruth decided,
[2:53:48] then the blessing was unlocked. So,
[2:53:50] Father, may your young people make a
[2:53:52] decision that from this day on, come
[2:53:54] what may, I will wholly follow the Lord.
[2:53:57] As for me and my househ, we will serve
[2:54:00] the Lord. Lord, may that not just be for
[2:54:02] the young people only, but even for the
[2:54:04] Calebs, for Lord, for the older ones. Uh
[2:54:06] Lord, as a service of recommmitment to
[2:54:09] see the will of God, the plan of God,
[2:54:12] the desire of God, the design of God
[2:54:15] reflected here in this terrestrial
[2:54:17] realm. Father, Lord, may you bring us
[2:54:20] back at the appointed time and be with
[2:54:22] your people in the precious name of
[2:54:23] Jesus Christ. Amen. And amen.
[2:54:27] Brother Jason,
[2:54:30] can we give the Lord a hand of praise?
[2:54:33] [Music]
[2:54:34] [Applause]
[2:54:35] [Music]
[2:54:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Appreciate the word this morning.

[3:05:07] thanks to almighty god for the calling
[3:05:09] in my life since a young child and now
[3:05:12] uh I'm thanking him for keeping me for
[3:05:13] the past 46 years by his grace in this
[3:05:16] end time message under this perfection
[3:05:19] ministry today my 68 years on the earth
[3:05:25] I thank God for the thirst for him that
[3:05:27] has placed that he has placed in my life
[3:05:29] and has kept me and keeping me happy
[3:05:31] birthday brother Joe Williams, God bless
[3:05:33] you with a Joe, happy birthday.
[3:05:37] And we extend birthday greetings to
[3:05:39] brother Hugh, our head deacon, and I
[3:05:41] think sister Marilyn as well. Her
[3:05:43] birthday was yesterday. So, may the Lord
[3:05:45] may she bless you and grant you many,
[3:05:48] many more years straight into the
[3:05:51] rapture. Amen.
[3:05:53] &gt;&gt; Wonderful. So, uh let's just bow our
[3:05:55] heads one more time. And we also want to
[3:06:00] remember in prayer there was a situation
[3:06:02] uh in Lagos where uh some of the
[3:06:06] brothers in returning from a funeral
[3:06:09] were taken captive and we want to
[3:06:11] remember them in prayer at this time
[3:06:14] that all will be well and the mighty
[3:06:17] hand of God would bring deliverance to
[3:06:19] them at this time.
[3:06:23] Heavenly Father, Lord, we thank you for
[3:06:24] your blood, for your grace, for your
[3:06:26] mercy, for your loving kindness, Lord.
[3:06:28] And Lord, we have so much to thank you
[3:06:31] for, Lord. If we even try to use the
[3:06:35] English language to express it, we will
[3:06:37] run out of words to properly put into
[3:06:40] structure how much you mean to us what
[3:06:43] you have done for us. So Lord, we unite
[3:06:46] in saying thank you for your grace, for
[3:06:47] your love, for your mercy to us. And
[3:06:50] Lord, we want to remember each one here
[3:06:52] in prayer. We want to pray for our
[3:06:54] pastor in a special way and his wife,
[3:06:56] Lord, and the ministry that we are
[3:06:58] under, all of the health and the
[3:07:00] governments, Lord. And Lord, we want to
[3:07:02] remember each one, Father, that Lord,
[3:07:04] helps make this church what it is,
[3:07:06] Father. And Lord, we want to remember
[3:07:09] our friends, our brothers in Nigeria,
[3:07:12] Lord. And Lord, what a situation. But
[3:07:14] Lord, you are more than able to bring
[3:07:17] relief and deliverance in this
[3:07:19] situation. Lord, you are God and God by
[3:07:22] yourself. So, Father, at this time, we
[3:07:26] could only tap into Lord, what you want
[3:07:28] to achieve out of this. But Lord, we
[3:07:30] commit the situation completely to you,
[3:07:33] knowing that Lord, at the end of it, you
[3:07:35] will get all the honor, all the glory.
[3:07:37] So, Father, we commit the brothers into
[3:07:39] your hands. We commit the efforts into
[3:07:41] your hands, Lord. And we pray dear God
[3:07:43] that Lord you would bring great
[3:07:44] deliverance to them. Father may you
[3:07:46] bless the church and may you bring us
[3:07:48] back at the appointed time. We commit
[3:07:50] your people into your hands. May you
[3:07:52] grant traveling mercies as we leave this
[3:07:54] house but not from your presence in the
[3:07:56] precious name of Jesus Christ. Amen and
[3:07:58] amen. You may be seated for a few
[3:08:00] announcements.
[3:08:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:08:03] service continues this Wednesday at 8:00
[3:08:06] PM live here at the tabernacle and we
[3:08:10] encourage you to make an effort uh to be
[3:08:12] here. Um, you know, I was sharing with
[3:08:15] my wife. I said, you know, there are
[3:08:17] people who, um, I get it. You might
[3:08:20] finish work late and different things,
[3:08:21] but I want you to reframe your thinking.
[3:08:24] You know, even if you can't make it
[3:08:26] every single Wednesday, could you make
[3:08:28] once a month, twice a month, three times
[3:08:30] a month, but let it not be that you miss
[3:08:32] every Wednesday service, you know. So,
[3:08:34] find a way to structure that you could
[3:08:37] make the effort because God counts the
[3:08:39] effort. So let us reframe our thinking
[3:08:41] because it could be so casual um that we
[3:08:44] have many Sunday only believers you know
[3:08:47] so it takes effort it takes sacrifice
[3:08:50] and I even if there's a day you miss but
[3:08:52] don't miss all right so rethink on your
[3:08:56] approach and your strategy so that you
[3:08:58] could give God what his fair share is
[3:09:00] all right
[3:09:02] so service continues on Wednesday at
[3:09:03] 8:00 p.m. There will be no
[3:09:06] uh online services coming Friday. There
[3:09:08] will be no online services coming
[3:09:10] Friday. This doesn't mean you just go
[3:09:12] and do what you want.
[3:09:20] Still find some time to pray.
[3:09:23] &gt;&gt; Still find some time to have your own
[3:09:24] family altar. All right. So service
[3:09:26] continues this Wednesday at 8:00 p.m.
[3:09:29] and this coming Sunday at 10:00 a.m.
[3:09:32] under great expectation for God to do
[3:09:34] something tremendous for us. Maintenance
[3:09:36] team group five, please meet with
[3:09:38] brother Blackman after the service today
[3:09:40] and next week Lord willing group four
[3:09:42] which is brother Marlon Alexander's
[3:09:44] group will be carded to serve. Uh, I
[3:09:48] want to just remind the church, brother
[3:09:50] Steven, forgive me. I don't have a full
[3:09:52] approval just yet, but we do have the
[3:09:54] church dinner coming up in December. I'm
[3:09:56] waiting on brother OIT to just confirm
[3:09:58] the date and once we have that date,
[3:10:00] we'll send it out um via the WhatsApp
[3:10:02] group uh this week so we could at least
[3:10:05] have it on your calendar. But it is
[3:10:07] happening. We're just trying to confirm
[3:10:09] the date between one of two weeks in the
[3:10:11] month of December. But I am under
[3:10:13] authority. So I don't have approval yet.
[3:10:16] So the date will come by the grace of
[3:10:18] God this week, right? So um but we will
[3:10:22] have a church dinner in December and do
[3:10:24] continue to remember one another in
[3:10:25] prayer. We are living in in different
[3:10:28] times, dangerous time and if there ever
[3:10:30] was a time to pray, it's now you know
[3:10:34] and when you look at the scripture that
[3:10:36] says forsake not the assembling of
[3:10:38] yourselves together, it actually adds in
[3:10:40] there as the day approaches. So it
[3:10:43] places a context to as the day
[3:10:45] approaches, we are supposed to be
[3:10:47] actually assembling more because we will
[3:10:50] need each other more. That's the purpose
[3:10:53] of what the church is for. So I want to
[3:10:55] encourage you to reframe your thinking
[3:10:57] on that and really look into what are
[3:10:59] you doing. Like I said, it's not for
[3:11:01] church, it's for the Lord. It's
[3:11:03] expressed in the structure of the
[3:11:04] church, but it's unto the Lord. So may
[3:11:06] the Lord richly bless you. May the Lord
[3:11:08] keep you. And uh Jess, I'll close with
[3:11:12] this before brother Jason sings us out.
[3:11:14] Blessed is the man that walketh not in
[3:11:17] the counsel of the ungodly,
[3:11:20] nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor
[3:11:23] sit in the seat of the scornful, but his
[3:11:27] delight is in the law of the Lord, and
[3:11:29] in this Lord that he meditate day and
[3:11:33] night. There's a lot of lessons in there
[3:11:35] to to to impact us and to unpack. But as
[3:11:38] we go out to school and to work and to
[3:11:41] meet people that we invariably have to
[3:11:43] meet people, be very cautious because
[3:11:46] there are people who will speak into
[3:11:48] your life. But the Brandon was driving
[3:11:50] one time and he allowed someone to come
[3:11:52] into his car and he said when they spoke
[3:11:55] in the car, he said they spoke a blue
[3:11:57] streak.
[3:11:58] &gt;&gt; By that he meant the words they used
[3:12:00] activated a spiritual impact in his
[3:12:02] vehicle.
[3:12:05] So I want us to be sensitive that we're
[3:12:07] not taking these things lightly because
[3:12:09] we're not wrestling against flesh and
[3:12:10] blood. But when you let people speak
[3:12:12] into your life, it has an impact.
[3:12:15] &gt;&gt; So you have to guard your heart, guard
[3:12:17] your phone, guard your conversations,
[3:12:20] guard what you look at, guard what you
[3:12:22] listen to, guard whose advice you take,
[3:12:25] guard whose counsel you expose yourself
[3:12:28] to. Because if you do not do that, you
[3:12:30] will find yourself drifting into places
[3:12:32] you don't know how you got there. But
[3:12:34] you re then real you open up yourself
[3:12:37] into some friend and they tell you this.
[3:12:39] And when you really realize it, it's a
[3:12:41] is it the devil using them? You know,
[3:12:44] &gt;&gt; I'm not accusing them of being devils,
[3:12:47] but the same Peter who was in the book
[3:12:49] of Matthew 16 that the Lord revealed and
[3:12:52] say, listen, flesh and blood reveal this
[3:12:54] to you. when it was opened up, God could
[3:12:57] still turn to Peter and say, "Get behind
[3:12:59] me, Satan." Because at that moment in
[3:13:01] time, the devil was using Peter.
[3:13:03] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[3:13:04] &gt;&gt; So, we are not walking around saying
[3:13:05] that people in our lives are devils. But
[3:13:08] understand this, there are only two
[3:13:09] forces.
[3:13:10] &gt;&gt; And every word that is spoken into your
[3:13:12] life, you have to ask yourself the
[3:13:14] question, is it from God or is it from
[3:13:16] the devil?
[3:13:17] &gt;&gt; Because nothing that comes to you that
[3:13:19] takes you away from God could be from
[3:13:21] God
[3:13:22] &gt;&gt; because you know the truth. So if it
[3:13:24] affects your mental state, your mind,
[3:13:26] your attitude, coming to church,
[3:13:28] fellowship, say, you know what good
[3:13:29] advice is. And if you want to get good
[3:13:31] advice, then brother Brandham said, you
[3:13:32] want to get the Holy Ghost, spend time
[3:13:34] with people who have the Holy Ghost.
[3:13:35] That's right.
[3:13:36] &gt;&gt; Because your environment determines your
[3:13:38] trajectory. All right? So these are life
[3:13:40] principles and and if you're not in an
[3:13:42] environment where you are hearing these
[3:13:44] things or you practicing these things
[3:13:45] and have these conversations by the
[3:13:47] grace of God we want to help create that
[3:13:49] environment so that at least during the
[3:13:51] week when you put on a tape you read the
[3:13:53] scripture send a message ask something
[3:13:55] let your whole life be a positive one.
[3:13:57] So may the Lord rich you bless you we
[3:13:58] love you we appreciate you brother
[3:14:00] Jason.
[3:14:01] [Applause]
[3:14:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:14:06] Oh God will make a way
[3:14:10] where there seem to be no way.
[3:14:15] He works in ways we cannot see.
[3:14:20] He will make a way for me.
[3:14:25] He will be my God.
[3:14:29] hold me closely to his side
[3:14:33] with love and strength for each new day.
[3:14:38] And he will make a way.
[3:14:43] God will make a way.
[3:14:47] God will make a way.
[3:14:51] When there seems to be no way,
[3:14:56] he works and ways. they cannot see. And
[3:15:00] he will make a way for me. He will be my
[3:15:06] guide
[3:15:08] and hold me closely to his side.
[3:15:13] With love and strength for each new day,
[3:15:18] he will make a way.
[3:15:22] God will make you believe that's a
[3:15:25] secret. God will make a way
[3:15:30] when it seems to be no way.
[3:15:35] He works and ways we cannot see and he
[3:15:40] will make a way for me. He will be my
[3:15:45] guide.
[3:15:47] Hold me closely to his side
[3:15:52] with love and strength for each new day.
[3:15:56] And he will make a way.
[3:16:01] God will make a way.
[3:16:05] God will make a way
[3:16:09] when it seems to be no way.
[3:16:14] He works in ways we cannot see. And he
[3:16:18] will make a way for me. He will be my
[3:16:24] God.
[3:16:26] Hold me closely to his side
[3:16:30] with love and strength. For each new
[3:16:34] day,
[3:16:35] he will make a way.
[3:16:39] God will make a way.
[3:16:44] God will make a way.
[3:16:47] where there seems to be no way.
[3:16:52] He works in ways we cannot see.
[3:16:56] He will make a way for me
[3:17:01] to be my
[3:17:04] only closely to his side.
[3:17:08] with love and strength for his good
[3:17:11] name.
[3:17:13] He will make a way.
[3:17:17] God will make a way.
[3:17:20] [Music]
[3:17:39] Oh, he will be my God,
[3:17:44] hold me closely to his side
[3:17:48] with love and strength for his new
[3:17:52] and he will make a way.
[3:17:57] God will make our way
[3:18:02] [Music]
[3:18:07] and hold
[3:18:09] me close.
[3:18:12] Let your love surround
[3:18:15] [Music]
[3:18:16] me.
[3:18:20] Bring
[3:18:22] the meaning.
[3:18:24] Draw me to your side.
[3:18:31] Oh, and as
[3:18:34] as I wait,
[3:18:36] I'll rise up like
[3:18:40] he goes and I sw you. Your spirit leads
[3:18:46] me on by the power of your love.
[3:18:51] God bless you. Heat. Heat.
[3:18:55] [Music]
[3:19:12] [Music]
[3:19:16] Heat. Heat.
[3:19:21] [Music]
