let's go ahead and close our eyes as we look to the lord heavenly father we thank you for your great love that you have loved us and your love wasn't when we were saints or believers and we were sinners you paid a price for us and give us this opportunity to be reconciled to you and father not just for our souls but even for our bodies and father we lift the believers before you father that your hand will be upon them your hand of protection your hand of covering your guidance lord and those who have lost loved ones and have families and friends who on the brink we pray that your mercy and grace extend to them god is almost like a harvest of souls but lord you know those who are are yours lord and we commit this time into your hands lord it's a trying time but it's not foreign to us because it was prophesied that difficult times lays ahead it's how we're going to steer these times or we will manage in these times it's not what happened to us is how we respond to what's happened to us how we act and decisions that we make so father prayer help us tonight and take me out of the way and may you be magnified amidst your people may your healing virtue flow even while the word is being spoken father lord there is no distance to you there is no uh uh wearing of of that we wear you but lord you give that strength to those who are a weak lord you give strength and you sit dear to wait upon you shove a new dear strength so we come tonight to wait upon you to hear from you father i pray that the torch that you have to have upon my heart to share with your people tonight made eddie fight him let it strengthen them let it inspire them i mean you bless them in a special way that they will be able to witness the others granted lord and jesus may ask it amen god bless you saints and thank you for being here tonight and um we are living in a privileged time and i realized that a lot have to do with how we possess what is happening around us if you allow it you'll be overtaken you'll be anxious you would you know be affected greatly but if you think that this is god's plan and god have a purpose behind everything then i miss it all you're looking for that way and i remember i think twice we mentioned it about jacob god himself told jacob go back to his country go back to the prison i'll be with you so it was my issue that it wasn't god he had his fears for his brother he had a right to have those fears he's a human and because of those fears he found himself making decisions and doing things to protect himself that is what we will do because of fears because of our and that is why in the upper room the doors were shut they were hiding they were they didn't want to be uh you know on the front line with no power with no blessing with no anointing they couldn't risk that they were following jesus and in obedience to jesus they were obeying the word and this is the whole thing about it jacob found himself in a place where even though and this is where he could have prayer certainly lord you told me to go back i'm scared i'm frightened and but you told me to go back i need you to be with me are you to help me i need to guide me and that is where jacob get this great encounter but he had a basis to call upon god and tonight you have that same basis so i pray tonight that god will bless us help us tonight and what we have to share with you tonight so tonight if you have your bibles i'd like you to turn to for proverbs chapter 16 i want to read verse 18 to 19 and i don't know how much about bible studies distribute tonight but we will be sharing some things with you and also from second chronicles 7 14 and we will go after that i'll see how it goes to first peter fight but let's just read verse proverbs 16 verse 18 to 19 pride go at before destruction and a holy spirit before a fall better it is to be of a humble spirit with the lowly than to divide the spoil with the proud and ii chronicles 7 14 is a familiar scripture scripture we read often we talk about it a lot if my people which are called by my name shall humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways then will i hear from heaven and will forgive their sin and will heal their life may god bless this world tonight i want to talk a little bit about pride and humility that's what i want to talk about tonight pride and humility now many times we make decisions which are comfortable to us within our comfort zone nobody likes to make how to should i say it hard decisions or tough decisions sometime in life you're called to do that with family with wife husband with friends with whoever tough choices in terms of decisions what you're going to act on what you're thinking and how you're going to act and what you're going to stand for it comes it comes down to the word you could have family father mother husband wife but when you come to the world you said no i'm staying with the word but what i want to say is this you have the power of choice of making decisions that you choose to be here tonight but you don't have power over the outcomes of your decisions many times we think we're in control we are not we are in control of our decisions we could say we gonna do this we can do that but the outcome of these decisions is where it comes a little different we could choose to love we could choose to hate we could choose to forgive or we could choose come that you could choose to be at peace i could choose to quarrel life is upset i've been upset your wife say something you could answer back or you could say nothing zip up and as you zip up you recognize listen she has nothing to ride on or he isn't the right one it stops right there you could choose to be fair or you could choose to be selfish all of these are our choices the choices we make are influenced by our knowledge our understanding our environment and the people that we associate with these are things that influence our decisions that's why they ever statement the bills of a feather flock together because they have a certain mindset and a certain influence that is dear and if there's a group think we think as the group thinks as opposed to coming into your own position and revelation so i'll say that again the choices we make are influenced by our knowledge if you don't know you make an uninformed decision because you don't know so i like to compare as knowledge as a role that is peeved and when you don't know it's like you hit a gravel road you're not sure so in order to continue you need to get information or knowledge that you could know where you're going and how you're getting to where you're going how do you get there so we could have ambition we could have desires but the question is how do we get to where we want to get that is when knowledge come in we don't have that knowledge then we are operating below the level of where we're supposed to be because we'll be operating from a level of shadows and ignorance and then some people don't like to admit that they don't know and therein lies a big big problem because it takes a certain level of humility to admit that you don't know and many times what you don't know is what get in trouble what you don't know so we need to know and we need to know if we know and if we don't know we need to humble ourselves to say you know what i want to know how can i know how can i learn jesus in the beginning say learn of me my youth is easy by burden is light we need to have a willingness to learn to know to grow many times because we feel we are older or maybe more greater we know but greater and older doesn't mean that you know you know to a certain extent but in the age that we're living in in which truly we see the fulfillment of scripture knowledge shall increase you recognize what you know 20 years ago not valid no it's not valid in the workplace it's not valid in management thoughts of management and and skill set and on what work place requires a lot of the stuff that is learned 15 20 years ago is irrelevant now because of the times that we live in and similarly similarly a lot of stuff that we tolerated or accepted years ago it is no longer valid we can't work more telling my wife today i said you know this whole pandemic forces any preacher which is sought to get online anybody who don't know they have to know they have to know technology they have to know concerning the internet they have to know what's streaming if they didn't know they have to know if they want to survive the times like these so i want to challenge you tonight our choice are also influenced by our thoughts and the communion of our own hearts and we see certain things how you think how you process things it will take you yourself to to rethink and reprocess and that's why the bible says be transformed by the renewing of your mind you have to start somewhere that's why when the word comes or thoughts are shared the first things it hit is your mind because that is where it starts starts with how you think how you process things you know why i um i believe in accepting challenges i believe life is a challenge thing brother isaac is a message we prayed back he was talking about life being stressful and this is life you can't expect life to be without what you are presently in right now so don't ball don't uh just adjust your mind if this is what it is then i was born for this i was built for this this is what i'm here for the world why and how is me and why i should go through this no don't say that understand this that before we had all of this um god knew it there's going to be it's very interesting that all these so-called prophets listen listen all the so-called prophets didn't see this couldn't prophesy it and most of these so-called prophets only have prophesied lies because god didn't speak to them we understand that and these men with no shame whatsoever continue prophesying normal normal as if people supposed to listen to them and when god say when the fellows prophesy and they they come to pass don't listen to them cut them off because not speaking to them they're only performing behind some pulpit or some desk or something like that and prophesying lies to god's people but god isn't a genuine prophet in his last day according to scriptures behold i sent you elijah the prophet that man william branham genuine prophet he prophesy of the times that we're in right now we know it's not normal times we know it's have to do with a lot of stuff and all of that is germ warfares all kind of spiritual wickedness all kind of things like that to put pressure to turn up the heat satan is mad we are getting somewhere because we have a promise to come into perfection we have a promise to come into apostolic times and apostatic times is not going to come without a personal conditions all these are promises we have a promise of a press that will come down and we also have a promise of a pull that will be manifested all these are promises if we emphasize the press and you don't want to get depressed or get pressed then you know it is a whole transition of thoughts to study press and pressure as opposed to truthful and power and the restoration of the sons of god so i like to think about you know god uh coming to us by the way of the word that we could commune in our own hearts the things of god because communion in your own heart is like taking the word but as i could always say it's not studying it's meditation on the word where you know this becomes your thoughts you want to think the touch of god you want to what does god mean what does god think how does god feel about these things so what we think about what we speak about the atmosphere we live in influences our behavior let me say it again what we think what we talk the atmosphere we live in influences our behavior our actions and our decisions so let's flip the whole thing now if we could get in the right environment if we could fellowship and connect with the right people if we could get our torch change and transform that it would affect our words our words affect our behavior and our actions then we could see something positive and great coming out of this entire bunch of people because this has to happen i always believe when i used to get the spoken books in the beginning that this book it used to mark the spoken word and i always believe that these books and these tapes were released to us that we could know how to speak the word so then it's very troubling when you hear people speaking their own thoughts and they won't mind and you know you could see it's not saturated inside of them because when you begin to meditate on the word and begin to think about the word and think about what god promised it becomes a place where you know you are blending in with it and you begin to speak like it your your heart is is full of faith your heart is full of expectation you will have the mountains and the valleys the challenges and so on but you have great courage and one thing this last day bright gonna have is great courage so friends i want to encourage you tonight to look again at what torch is prevailing in your mind in your heart because as we get nearer to the coming of the lord we have to become more detached detach from our car house land money career whatever it is it must just be a tool that we have to use it not it must not be an anchor point where this is minds and this is what i have and that's why they rather talk about uh don't say don't say tomorrow i'll do this and next week i'll do that no say if the lord will and there's a reason for that and i'm seeing more and more that in making decisions how we really need to be in prayer asking god for his intervention and leading in in making decisions because what we don't know is the outcome of these decisions that we make decisions look right here i'm gonna do this i'm gonna do that i'm not gonna do this i'm not gonna do that but then because you move this way then this unfold you know as mike and i we talk a lot we fellowship a lot and it comes like this if i didn't marry or if angry was not my wife i don't know if i was gonna have three sons my decision in in having my wife to be who she is that decision produce three sons and those three sons they will have they have their own children now and you could see if i had get married to somebody else the results would be different the outcome was going to be different so you want god to guide your decisions that you could have the right outcome this is what it's about when god tells isaac that to him the sea gonna be and isaac dies he shall be called and his wife rebecca is barren that can't work how old is supposed to come to happen oh isaac could wrestle with god and say god you said the seat coming through this way my wife is no parent and i am going to implore and plead now when you catch these keys and this is a whole i just feel sometimes i don't know about you but forgive me i hope i hope it's come across right but i just feel i have to pray for the prayer meeting i have to pray for the bible study i have to pray for the service if i don't like i don't know what going to happen that's just me i don't know if it's from a shepherd's standpoint or from a past standpoint but i want you to feel the same way about praying in your own life don't just take things for granted don't just take it will work out you know like how somebody said you woke up by faith by my faith you will go no let it be guided by your prayer for it to work out let it be connected to heaven for it to work out so you're not experimenting you know that is why uh it is foolhardy it is foolish to distrust flesh and blood you have to come to the place where your confidence is in god the word if the pastor dies in the morning you don't die your feet don't die if the whole church collapse in the morning your feet don't collapse if the world collapses in the moon if this is it now we're heading down yeah you have to ask yourself well where is the fate you know because when the son of man cometh shall be fine look at the believers they on the depression they're on the frustration they can't take it no more but the question was that when the summer man comment but when he reveal himself shall we find fate on the earth where is the fate right now i feel like we're in caves you're in your own den in your house and they wonder about in sheepskins and coach destitutes and afflicted of whom the world was not worthy right now you're in your own cave and right now in your cave you are listen carefully an individual in god and you could have your own revival in your own cave right now you in your own little room right now you are in your own triple closet and tonight i want to address something with you concerning pride and humility and i want to first start it off at the level of the ministry that i want to stand up and that scripture i want to look at that is in first peter chapter five if you want to look at me we want to read from verse one to eleven first peter chapter five and this is paul and um this is the first piece of speaking here the elders which are among you i exhort she's talking to elders who i'm also an elder and a witness of the sufferings of christ and also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed verse two feed the flock of god which is among you taking the oversight thereof not by constraint but willingly not for filthy luca but of already mind neither has been lords over god's heritage but being examples to the flock so when the chief shepherd shall appear he shall receive a crown of glory that faith is not away likewise ye younger submit yourselves unto the elder ye all of you be subject one to another and be clothed with humility watch that word now clothed with humility for god resisted the proud and give it grace to the humble think that part would repeat it be clothed with humility for god resisted the proud but give it grace to the humble verse six humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of god that he may exalt you in due time casting all your care upon him for he cared for you to believe that tonight that's a scripture he cared for you who's eight be sober be villager vigilant because your adversary the devil is a roaring lion walk it about seeking whom he may devour whom resists steadfast in the faith knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world but the god of world grace who had called us onto his eternal glory by christ jesus after you have suffered a while make you perfect establish strengthen settle you him be glory and dominion forever and ever amen now i want to read that in the amplified and uh we'll get some more into it speaking verse one in the amplified so just listen carefully i warn and conquer the elders among you the pastors and the spiritual guides of the church as a fellow elder as an eyewitness called to testify of the sufferings of christ as well as a sharer in the glory the honor and splendor that is revealed this close unfolded tend nurture guard guide unfold the flock of god that is your responsibility not by coercion or constraint but willingly not listen not dishonorably motivated by the advantages and profits belonging to the office but eagerly and cheerfully here we go deeper now not domineering as arrogant dictatorial and overbearing persons so in other words he's telling these brothers here there'll be no message poop there'll be no domineering arrogant dictatorial and ovarian person overdose in your church but being examples patterns and models of christian living to the flock the congregation then when the chief shepherd and i like how this is worded because he is talking to shepherds he's talking to ministers he's talking to elders so he's saying listen you might be a shepherd but this is the chief shepherd when the chief shepherd is revealed you will win the conquest crumb of glory and according to the younger ones likewise you who are younger one or of lesser rank be subject to the elders the ministers spiritual guys of the church giving them due respect and yield into their counsel clawed or apron yourself all of you with humility and then he yet as the god of a servant so that its covering cannot possibly be stripped from you with freedom from pride and arrogance towards one another for god sets himself against the proud the insolent the overbearing the distainful the presumptuous the boastful and he opposes and frustrates and defeats them but give grace favor blessing to the humble therefore humble yourself demote lure yourself in your own estimation under the mighty hand of god and in due time he may exalt you cast in the whole of your care all your anxieties all your worries all your concerns once and for all on him for he cares for you affectionately and cares about you watchfully be well balanced temperate sober of mine be vigilant and cautious at all times for that enemy of yours the devil rooms are wrong like a roaring lion in fierce hunger seeking someone to seize upon and devour withstand him be filming fate against his onset rooted established strong immovable and determined knowing that the same identical sufferings are pointed to your brotherhood the whole body of christians throughout the world and after you have suffered a while the god of all grace who imparts all blessing and favor was called you to his own eternal glory in christ jesus will himself complete and make you what you ought to be establish and ground you securely and strengthen and settle you to him be dominion power and glory you will forever and ever praise the lord amen you love that scripture tonight so starting from the top we want to start from the top and come down starting from the top we identify that the ministry and this is what how should i say it what i saw in trinidad what i saw under legalism i rejected and that is why uh everybody who knew me and fellowship with me that is why i didn't want people from other groups to come to our church i wanted to win souls for the field just sinners and share the word and that was my original vision and so on one reason was i was truly disturbed by the level of authority and legalism undone and domination that the pastors had in this message over the lives of the people and i pledge to god that if he would give me that opportunity i will never do that and i kept my word by god's grace and and and this i'm seeing is is is what god wants in jesus another scripture he said the gentiles exercise authority he said but don't do like that him that his greatest among you let himself jesus himself took on superman garment uh i have a servant you washed your feet and peter carry on don't wash my feet you see i don't know why i'm doing here now humble yourself and then jesus afterwards say you see what i do for you and you call me master and i want to do one for another so he was demonstrating clearly that he wanted that pattern of humility that pattern of like vulnerability then that you're not up here somewhere floating in some sky somewhere but you're one of them because what jesus become he became like one of them he wanted that demonstrated among his people so it had to start from the top so god we see by the scriptures resists the proud god have an attitude towards pride he has an attitude towards boosting how does this thing come about or sometimes somebody poor or they're struggling and god bless them with this and bless them with that and after a while man they can't tell them a word because now they they have arrived you see and because of their thoughts now instead of humbling themselves and saying lord i thank you for what you've blessed me with you find them that what they have is not enough you know what they have they want more and they want more because they're not feeling fulfilled and the devil keeps shifting this what i call it the gold pole the the gold post of fulfillment so if you get this here so you get car number eight but card number is where everybody has have that kind so you need car b because you want to look uh better than the rest and then you go to class c and of course if you get car d in a different class by yourself people say who goes but yeah liquidity right driving now so you see and in your mind you are thinking because let's put it not just from a human standpoint let's take it from something going on in your mind in your chemicals in your body and a man riding a bicycle and he's peddling and he is feeling fulfilled as ever joyful as ever as if he's driving a bmw mercedes-benz with some kind of i don't know whatever big car name engine and he is driving the road with true will and jesus he having a jubilee and you watching them hear a bicycle but he he's a different realm because that satisfaction is not a mind game for him it's a reality in the heart and god could give you that tonight i am not talking about no ambition and you have nothing and you're just you're very satisfied i'm not talking about foolishness that's the next foolishness business you know we don't talk about that now i'm talking about when people are unfulfilled they do a lot of stuff they see a lot of stuff they want to be recognized they want to be acknowledged if they want some kind of position on business say this is me i am here now this is where this humbling and humility it gets done to real because this thing is what does help kill you because tutoring is killing you know pride can kill your humility could kill you is which one you want to kill you because you see if you're going with pride god will resist you you will die but humanity also kills because humanity makes you take it wrong purely humility makes you accept and let things go and let things blow and you're waiting upon god humility help you to acquire wisdom because sometimes you're very right and sometimes like i told a brother who's have issues with his children and so on and say well sometimes you have to decide if you want to be right or you want a relationship with you with your family because you could be right and you have no relationship i remember this story about a man who his son are wearing his ears and doing this and playing basketball and he's not talking to his son or whatnot one day on the basketball field his son fell down and died going to find out he had a tumor in his brains and then the father of course in grief he regretted the fact that he did not have a relationship with his son all because of the way he thinking our son supposed to be as if well if you would not win earrings in your ears if you're not doing this if you're not wearing your dress if you're not doing this then i could talk with you were you wearing long pants when god called you how long was your dress what would be sinners and yet we sit down on some kind of a moses throne judging others based upon christianity our so-called holiness it doesn't make sense and god rejects that so when brother brown was condemning the woman in the restaurant and saying god why did you destroy this place the daughter of my daughter is this the place where my daughter wrote him god tapping my shoulder call him a sign begin to show him some of himself his sins show him the blood bumper show him i forgive you and he put your sincere forgiveness and look you condemning her that was a a real lesson for brother brown oh he's a prophet right he got pulled aside and led by god to show my whole vision this is you here this is your pardon come in here look how you condemn so long what about him supposed to do he goes to the woman and said woman i was just condemning you and what the lord showed me only to hear the woman was a christian and she was once as though the lord a husband ran away to our next woman and what kind of issues and and on the floor the woman was reconciled because but abram was able to intend to see the way god sees and i hope tonight that you could get a whisper a taste of how gorgeous not how he passes here not all your friendlies here people see cookie eyes people see all they want to see we're talking about how god sees you know one example again before we continue the political son we know this story something that we always go through about a guy he went off our country to get his money his father gave him holy father know the boys are all crazy uh you know while someone like that experience have to bring him through and so on and and yet he let the sun go now we might say god sadly i know you're not ready yet and we may hold back the money that's how we may think but this father decides to lose him let him go i know and he far so he had no advice to get no counsel he deliberately went far yeah he can pick pick food no money done and all the friends support all these support and hey you know what i mean everybody coming in live in here pizza you know chinese food and everything all the works it's finished now so it's an embarrassment raised art he's ashamed he don't know how to put it together so he's there he didn't pick food you know diamond best invested in the big food everything in jesus name amen sprinkling whatever pepper ketchup whatever he could put on it to make it kind of looking pleasing to make it sometimes imagine this of some course menu well you know but then the bible said he came to himself and i'm wondering if something used to bother me i think you're talking about my heart tonight so i'm just sharing with you and talking with you how do we get a people that sat down for 40 years listening to tapes books preachers ministers conventions stories mysteries how do you get them into action how do you get them out of this slot for sluggishness this casual yeah i know this prophet said you know i mean how do you get them into action what would move them said if love doesn't get your conditions will what if the wheels of conditions have already begin to turn what if we gather here tonight is part of the wheels of conditions turning to get us out of complacency out of lethargy and after a while the little home trials and testings you have been through that you call yourself suffering do you recommend die dinner suffering when the bible talk after you suffer a while that you may be strengthened and so on we're going to know is not that then what is yet to go through is that we don't remember because sometimes our suffering connected with our decisions and choices and it unfolds in outcomes but what we're talking about sufferings is things that god set up planned and arranged to put enough pressure on us to turn us the message that we played sunday there is a river staple was made there's two things that change the course of a river time and pressure i was anxiously looking forward for the lifting of this thing monday but we know based upon the figures of all the virus and people behavior it couldn't be possible so therefore we get an extension of time that we wasn't prepared for but that is what changes the course of a river time and pressure everybody like somebody will say bend back like a bow i want i wanted the easy tension bend back like a bow how long this ball bend you see you could break but the point about it is this time and pressure changes the course of a river we don't control the river we don't control the trials we don't control what comes or we but a lot depends upon our attitude to what comes our way and how we manage that oh praise the name of the lord let me see if i could continue a little bit who no we know that pride didn't originate on earth pride originated in heaven isaiah 14 you'd have to find it i'll read it verse 12. how would dove fall from heaven or lucifer son of them how a dog cut down to the ground without this week in the nations for those said in thine heart i will ascend into him i will exalt my throne above the stars of god i will sit also upon the mount of the congregation in the size of the north so he wanted to be a pastor long time long time for the ministry i will ascend above the heights of the clouds i will be like the most high so he's an i man yet though shall be brought down to hell to the size of the pit and be that cd shall now look upon thee and consider this saying is this the man that make the earth to tremble and shake nations this is what the bible said will be said about him a man i will ascend i will be like i will rise above i will sit on top of i i i do are you fully seconded my mom says supposed to be god first family second you third what are you tonight do you want your own way and do you think that you will continue and get in your own way and that is why sometimes you find rich people cheering commit suicide all kind of drugs and whatnot because there is no discipline all what they need they buy they want their money is tear they don't have to think twice and so on but we are taught that character comes through suffering and is interested in descriptive mind after you suffer a while that suffer a while is in context of you not us you that suffer a while is individual it's not the church suffering and he writes afraid no no no no it doesn't look sweet when jesus went to wilderness he didn't take a bunch of people in the spirit led him him into the wilderness to be tested to be tempted or to be honed if i use simple brownfield or to be cut or to be shaped like how we say we got to be shaped down to the word now i can't shape you don't i can present the word but you have to be willing to receive it i can present help we can present help to you but you must be willing to accept it you must be willing to receive it hearing it doesn't mean you're accepting it looking at nice water and saying oh my that water is so clean it from the spring but you're not is only when you begin to say you know what yeah you know some sometimes i couple my one constraint the one constant but really sometimes both parties don't really want constant one make one consonant one push for consonant one push to act let us go to our counselor because one not getting true to the other partner here it is we can't continue so you know just not working out as we want so the other one is resisting because let's say he's a man he's in pride mode your wife one counselor your husband does not because he find you know i mean i want to talk to nobody i feel like i'm all right your wife say listen you're not seeing things good you're seeing things with the shade you know one sided green one side blue you're not seeing things right let's see if somebody else has about clear glasses that can help us and assist us and um so when you come to concert now your husband oh you have a blocker already he has a thing already because he really wasn't really wanted to come you know because your wife kind of push it that therefore you'll be passed and i'll have to sit down as if easy concern and started talking about nothing so you're talking ain't saying nothing i ain't easily nothing afterwards you like talking talking talking but you see in order for a couple to get help people get help it has to be a willingness to communicate to share you know maybe i'm not seeing it right yeah you may think you're right as a man or you may think you're right as a female as a woman but maybe best maybe you could be wrong in how you view things not wrong in terms of wrong absolutely wrong but in terms of not being balanced i know wars where somebody accustomed putting their shoes under their bed and next person have their shoes under the cupboard and they come together and married the husband comes some person in bed wife of course not putting his shoes in the cupboard and putting them at war because once they under the bed next time say in the cupboard now it might look petty it might look funny but to them it's a serious button and as pastor you sit down here and this kind of foolishness we go right but this is environment now and all it needs is a simple compromise let's put it on top somewhere you know i mean you could put it on top if you want but i'm saying these things are petty stuff that people could sit down and traditionally can say you know is this worth it sometimes there are battles that is not even worth it why go into it it's not even with him let it go it have too much more serious stuff to make certain issue our issue let it go give people time time to learn and to listen listener if you're not listening if you're not studying if you're not you know reading and studying and listening you're not growing the mechanics no long time mechanics number punches you plug points condenser these new electric cars listen i i know you said you could crank up in the beginning and put something in front of your tuners in front of study engineering you could wind it up and they graduated from that so a mechanic now in general has to update his skills to deal with what we have and i'm telling you now what we are facing now this is very very interesting i see god flatten the landscape all these so-called mighty men of god required since coronavirus come no more mighty talking they're quiet they're making nepalese and stuff but they're very very quiet because god's showing them who's the boss yet there's a promise of a super church yet there's a promotional super race either man in this message going to be adopted they can't even heal a truth no testimony no witness no nothing yet they claiming to be something yeah it's called a virus and all people could do is just watch watch but is that brother branham prophesied he said the bride no other power could wait would work in her she waits upon it she's waiting in love for the promise of the aid to be confirmed she is waiting her in love not in frustration not any pressure god can lie you can't tell me corona virus and all these diseases in charge of this world they're crazy how could that be when he says sons of god will stop cancer stop diseases stop plagues that's my promise that is your promise too we who are alive and remain we are looking to die now there must be somebody who alive and remain you also in this room somebody must be here to be alive and remain shallow in the devil of asleep but among us and all the others who going to sleep they are going to sleep but we are people here that are going to be alive and remain that will come to perfection in order to bring a resurrection oh my so i hope tonight that some of these things that we are sharing with you would really help you as a christian as a believer but obama was saying this he said he's talking about um we want to keep it running smoothly and sweetly in order for the lord now remember that your part may be the main spring or it may be a little a little hand or some little part of the wine and stem or maybe the face of the clock that tells the time but whatever it is it takes all of us together in harmony with the gospel of jesus christ to bring this to pass just think if gifts is so great and what we call power paul said this is barbara do i have faith that i can move mountain and after charity i am nothing think of that you said i i know i i wish i know the bible is i wish i knew the bible but do i understand all the mysteries of god and still do i could do it and have no charity i am nothing i haven't got noah yet see the main thing is to love god and humble yourself with it now surely after all these years on the field and around the world seeing different people i ought to know a little bit about the gate to enter in act and if you want to get somewhere with god let us be applied tonight if you want to get someone with god never let an arrogant spirit ever come around you don't let no malice come in no matter what anybody does if they are wrong don't you never build a complex against that person you be sweet and be kind remember god love you when you were in sin and if the spirit of god is in you you would love the other person when he is in wrong see just pray for them and love one another could you love somebody when they are in the room or you think about that this is so-called christian people now he wrong wrong yeah you know you're wrong god knows wrong but god looking to see if you could be like god if you could love like him and that is how the test came with those people making love in the church and say stop it please holy would you stop it stop it and they don't want to scare it and then the holy spirit come down if you say death they will die if you say blind they were blind whatever you see it will happen to them and they say i forgive you and this is what god wanted to hear god was so pleased because he has a son that have a heart like god now god knew adam was going to fall what the eve is going for but the point about it is that he already made a provision for them he turned his back and walked away he knew that he was dear and eve would hear the supernatural and what could unfold but along the way other things would unfold him being a redeemer a hero a deliverer restorer other things was going to unfold so sometimes your life as messed up but it might appear from a natural standpoint there are other things to unfold the other outcomes the outcome of what you may not understand that is where you trust god and what you don't understand and have confidence in romans 8 28 we know all things will work together for good to them that love god you actually take the word and you'll bow before it lord you always say all things all things good i don't understand this but lord work it out for your good i mean you see it work out for your honor and for your glory this is the situation this and you see and because everything is customized and it's not one size fits all you may go through sickness you may go through wife problem husband problem children problem labor problem job problem money problem social problem all kind of disabilities in your spirit in your heart and mind but god want to work it out for good you can look at all the different bible characters and see their different challenges and issues but they all came true as sons and daughters of god and you too will come true we have a guarantee that you will come true because this last day bright god i play with this last day break this last day bright belong to special forces this last day by belong to a special class of people he said this is a special class of people people that have the ability to hear from god that's number one i don't care what condition you're in tonight you have the ability to hear from god when that word speaks the ability is placed already inside of you he said that is why his father out of what you're in and struggle into what you're in it's staggering that's why god could call you up with no no reservation you see so you have to have the confidence that god who anointed martin luther wesley that same god called paul and rhema's nothing called number all these seventies messengers who is who has called you and if they didn't fail their duty to hold up that light you would not feel your duty to shine and hold up that light your call to shine that way do you believe that tonight oh blessed be the name of the lord so brother braham said hear this now he said what he said never build a complex against that person you be kind and sweet remember god love you when you were sin above all he says love god love one another and be humble with god and around one another and god will bless us it's hard to tell what god will do when we operate like that right he said when god created me within branham i was before the function of the world he made my being my spirit i was not conscious of anything that signs i know he said now watch he said jesus were disciples he said i knew knew you before the function of the world and paul said it chosen in him before the world began now there was some part of me or my neville and the rest of you here in christ jesus before the world began and here to my analysis of that i think that the people today that are possessed with this spirit or the spirit is a part of these angelic beings spirits which rotated off of god that never fell in the beginning and resisted the devil's light now tutors of the earth is in sin and more than that which tutors of the angels was kicked out now those demon spirits come into people and habitate their body you see what i mean they are demons they won't exist they once existed and they come into people and give them a nature and jesus cast seven of them out of mary magdalene and begin to list them pride boast big people you see unclean filthy vulgarity emulation strife all these things there were spirits that would make a back deer and so on like that so therefore these prayers come down and give people a nature one of them being pride oh blessed be the name of the lord praise be to and and peter we know it and first peter you don't define it he says where are you greatly rejoice do not for a season if need be you're in heavy heaviness to manifold temptations that the trial of your faith being much more precious and of gold that perish it do it betrayed with fire i be found unto the praise and glory and honor of the appearance of jesus christ whom having not seen you love in whom do now you see him not yet believe in you rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory receiving the end of your feed even the salvation of your souls oh praise the name of the lord philippians 2 if there be any consolation of christ if any comfort of love any fellowship of spirit if any bowels have mercies fulfilling my joy that should be like-minded having the same love being of one accord of one mind here we go let nothing be done to strife or vain glory but in loneliness of mine let each esteem the other better than themselves so then the amplified of that say do nothing from fractional motives to contentiousness strife selfishness you ever see people i mean people who just like battle they don't feel good until they engage you in a you know in a fight you say something they oppose they are posed for opposing sake they want to know what you have to see and it's a cling and a that is not what the spirit of god is about do nothing to look for a fight you're not looking for a fight with people you're not going to fight with brethren okay is it do nothing from fractional motive to contentiousness strife and selfishness or for unworthy ends or prompted by conceit or empty arrogance instead in the true spirit of humility loneliness of mine and i want to stick with that humility as loneliness of mind let each regard the others better than them or superior themselves thinking more highly of one another than you do yourself so let's continue verse 6 verse was foreign look not every man and his own things but every man also the things of others let this mind be knew which was also in christ jesus who being the form of god tortured not robbery to be equipped with god but made himself of no reputation took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the cross he jesus what he humbled himself can you humble yourself and wherefore god give him a name and we know the story that in the name of jesus evanesh bow every time we should confess we're going quickly now i had a privilege in my life of meeting great men and it's remarkable to notice how vice versa things can be i've met men that was great men and i've met men who taught they were great men and there's a certainly a lot of difference in them a great man will always not be a stuffed shirt but he will try to make you think that you are the great man and he is nothing and the man that is nothing and trying to be great just the other way that's the reason i know jesus was the son of god he came to earth without even having a place to be born yet to borrow a womb with a borrow manger yet to come to a borrowed womb went through a poor grave the foxes are dense the birds have a ness but the son of god another place that lays head yet the king of glory the god of heaven made flesh well among us that would make him great humility the way down is all the way is the way up he just will humble himself god will exalt he that exalted himself would be a beast the way down is the way up for the believer humble himself before god jesus met with men of all walks of life he met in great sickles one time he was with thousands 500 at once 12 at once three at once even will come to one that makes him great because not even one person can ever call on him but that he will be right there at their side and that's what make him god is because of his humility and brahm talked about elijah and he said god and simplicity elijah humble himself stayed with god in such a way that it pleased god to take that same spirit show it three times down the road now you see while it was in a simple way and everybody was against him everybody what has that as a truth all the minister's association everything else was at his truth trying to get rid of him everything else but not simplicity even though they had no cooperation cooperation with his campaign whatever more they had everybody thought he was a crank god was hiding himself and when it comes time for that seat to get ripe that has been planted god manifested himself by sending fire out of him and licking up the sacrifice god hiding in simplicity and then revealing himself again god lives in simplicity to manifest himself in greatness what makes him great because he can simplify himself and talk about the story and i don't want to maybe i just want to just skip a little bit talk about a girl who had i guess you know the crutches and something like that the finnish girl stepping out there a little woman little girl 12 years old had two crutches on her arm and had a brace one limb was limp and shorter than the other she had no control of his leg it set a brace around her hip a big shoe snap-on toe strap went right back shoulder and hooked the brace i looked at her standing there little ragged looking here little kind of half brown blonde here chopped off with scissors later i learned you as a finished war orphan a modern fadari was killed during the time of the war she looked at me and they gave orders not to say nothing to you on the street she told she had done something wrong with that child she dropped her leg stood there on the on the little crutches i seen her little blue eyes look up towards me again i stopped the soldier's motion i couldn't speak a word to them they all spoke finish i told them just a minute the other two soldiers walk on and turn to look back to see what happened i motion to them i look at the child again she looked at me i i just something told me that baby wanted to come over here and i looked at building and motioned her to come here she took a little crutches on their arm she started pulling a little shoulder she'd come out i just stood still and she come right out to where i was like that i watched to see what the child was going to do she stood there with a little head bow down a few minutes i watched dropping on the floor little tears dropping out of them little eyes dropping down like that and i thought poor little thing and she reached over and took a hold of my coat and pulled it up her little hands and rubbed it and her little hands were dirty and she kissed my coat she dropped the coat down pull out a little rugged skirt and said kittos that means thank you little skirt look very polite said kittles look up and them little baby blue eyes with tears running down oh my something swell in my heart i taught god bless you honey it turned and i sold it trying to motion me on trying to emotional back and i looked i see him going listen so he's he's in that atmosphere and he's looking at like a vision break i see him going and walking right down through the room or walking without crutches i know it would happen i know god will honor that kind of faith i have been if i had been the lowest hypocrite in the world god would have honored that fate in that child i seen the child going walking i said honey you're healed jesus had made you of course she couldn't hear what i was saying she was crying you know seeing kittens she taught you done wrong you know they kept pushing me on so brother baxter come to the door and wanted to find out where i was at so he's tell her she is here she is still in the crutches she can't understand his english he knows she is here by vision and yet she's in that condition let's continue i went on in we prayed for several sick and you notice the crutches pile up and they put them in big carts to hold them away and i just fixing to leave the building my virgin a bunch of them had come and got me to take off the platform i was just fixing to leave and i taught i'm going to try a few more i've got to call some more of those cards and the holy spirit would move out over the audience they'll have to get an interpreter and tell the people oh dear i didn't know their language tell them where they was at and what they were doing and what they were suffering with and the interpreter would have to see it and that settled it all just threw down the crutches and canes and started running i said call a few more of the cars and then they did and by god's providence they say they want to take him off he said call a few more cats and then by god's providence the next one was that little girl she had the next card number and here she come she was just smiling you know one little two out in front she was smiling you know trying to get to me i said to interpreter just say what i say she said all right brother branham i said you're going to see something already took place i said sweetheart you and a little girl that i met out a while ago she nodded ahead as the interpreter spoke i said listen to these words now we're gonna close prisoner okay i said your respect to jesus christ your approach in the right manner that's a lot of times the way we americans don't get anything we don't come to god reverent enough don't you think so we just know more about it god lives in humility and simplicity so i said god rewarded you honey he healed you oh dear and i want you to go over here and sit down and get some of the men to unbuckle these braces and things from around you and let your head sit on your hip and just as they bring the braces off let your little hand slide down your leg just as far as your leg is short i said now you do that over there then show me so then i called the next one and the holy spirit was showing in the vision and while the vision was going on i heard a scream and here she come across the floor with crutches in her hands and braces overhead screaming at the top of her voice right up the step she went right down across the other way little bare feet just running hard as she could she is perfectly normal well because a respect and love to jesus christ brought his blessing down upon her oh my humility a modest or low view of one's own self-importance and this is by your author andrew murray humility is a part of debt because in debt it gives the highest proof of his perfection humility is the blossom to which debt to self is the perfect fruit jesus humbled himself unto death and opened a part in which we too must walk there is no way for him to prove his surrender to god to the uttermost or to give up and rise out of the human nature to the glory of father by true dead humility must lead us to die to self so we prove how holy we have given ourselves up to it unto god amen his humility give his debt value and so it become a redemption i want to say this way jesus this humility lord is not my will that i will not my will die will be done and let to not discourage and him yielding to pay that price through that he purchased our redemption what about him and i'm going to wrap up he's a church of businessmen let's not lose our influence let's cover our faces this morning lord i'm nothing lord moan me make me a new i'm down in the temple let me cover my feet lord i am nothing and this is from the mystical influence we talk about the seraphim the two wings fly two wings cover their feet and two men cover their face and talking about an action and humility and reverence he said who will go for us isaac i said he said he am i sent me your life will influence your family it will influence your neighbor it will influence your church you just put one or two good members in a church that really on fire for god it will do something for that church more than forte virus could have a good cleansed member set an example on the face shining with the glory of god with sweetness and humility to stand there in the power of god and watch when someone gets sick they will call that person to pray for them you might make fun of them and so forth you might all this nonsense say but let dead strike you one time you'll find out them struggles begin to come that's the real sincere person in the church oh my we don't cover our faces our feet right our wings won't work we got the wings spread out you know cover yourself humble yourself and then get into action and it's amazing that exactly that right here in this message where he prophesied this what we have seen happen should put every soul in action it should make a church that would make a revival here in phoenix the people will be flying in from europe to see what's taking place they will say there's a place in arizona called maricopa valley a city called phoenix there is something broke out there until the seven thunders of revelation 10 has not even wrote in the bible is being manifested the power of god is here the angel has gathered up the loose ends and we are here he's about to write those thunders he don't like them and so on the great battles back there has cut loose ends hanging out it ought to be all wrapped up together here we are brothers we are all at the time let the holy spirit influence us to the word of god let god do the inference in our hearts and not be influenced by others this ought to put us into action oh man i'm closing this is the last quote i have here oh my what we need in jeffersonville is thousands of live voices the thunder of god turning out in sweetness and holiness and purity undefined lies walking around the earth today without a blemish yes sir real christians that's the thunder against the enemy the devil don't care how loud you can holler the devil don't care how much you can jump or how much you can do this or that or shout but what hurts the devil is to see that sanctified holy life consecrated to god say anything to him call him anything just as sweet as it can be move right on that chosen way that's the thunder that shakes the devil we have our church for a long time when jesus started his ministry calvary was not in sight but calvary was always his destination one time when he tried to hold him he said i always not yet come and then afterwards another time he said my always come i always come he he recognized the hour upon him friends the destination is calvary the destination is jordan power is beyond jordan jordan represent that in your journey there must come an hour but you come face to face with where god wants you to be god want you to go we go this way we go that way we are docking the road to golgotha's hill but that is where we have to be but ivan said the dynamics of this church will drive the people to california and then into the rapture i want to thank you tonight for coming out you could have done something else with your time today tuesday but you choose to be in this whole cave you choose to be to hear this word and we choose to share this with you that in your walk in your talk with god that you could find that place to be humble to be in action and to be referent before god let's buy it almighty god i thank you tonight i really bless you to be here i didn't know how this was going to unfold but i thank you and i honor you lord and i praise you for your goodness and the grace towards us it could have been worse lord but you have been good to us that we can still share because still here because they believe we can still act on your word father any person that is sick right now understand our voice may they be healed will they be healed by your spirit moving into their homes and touching them and blessing them any backsliding inside of here or backsiding person in here in this room lord may they be restored any person needed a revival in their spirits in their hearts may you revive them father oh god we love you we thank you for the ministry here the ministers the elders the deacons the trustees all who give that support we appreciate them lord and i pray to touch them in the time of needs and struggle because we don't have any idea what the people are going through in their hearts and in their minds we speak we speak to a dark lord darkly through a glass lord we we speak but we don't even know what's really going on in the hearts and lives of your children but you know father and i pray the great comfort of god will comfort them the great assurance of god would work with them that you would bless them jesus when you were here on earth and you were about to leave you told your only disciples i will not leave you comfortless i wouldn't leave you as orphans but uh i'm gonna come i'm gonna send you another comforter the word being with them was one comfort but they needed something more they needed something greater they needed something within father to some people the churches are comfort to some people the pastor is a comfort some people friends in the church and other believers are comfort but that can't hold in this great hour and time and need they have to get another comforter father father of confidence the holy ghost and they promise you shall receive power after holding the scout upon your father i pray tonight that the holy ghost will come and quit me quitting the people to the world may they understand my revelation legalism cannot take them into the kingdom it's the grace and the power and the mercies of god release your fire once more once more release your anointing father break every yoke the people get their individual experiences with you as you speak to them as you rule them by your spirit as that dove is quinn leading guiding to guide him that they could be stripped of the lust of the eyes the lust of the flesh and the pride of life strip us tonight father may we get disconnected from the world truly by things of the world and may we have the freedom and the liberty to be free from pride free from jealousy from envy free from fear free from unbelief and just surrender completely to you god bless the service tomorrow that will be stream life father god may the entire end and may the anointing of god flow freely among your people i commit their lives in their hands in jesus name i ask it amen and amen god bless you saints uh it's great medicine to you tonight and um i'm looking forward to see what the lord will do it might not have been much of a bible study as such but uh i believe it's something that when i recognize that i have to speak tonight just come to my heart about about pride and humility and there are too many arrogant people too much arrogant pride proud for people and and um notice that there was a shortcut from egypt to the promised land what god did he led them the long way hoping that they forget the garlic and the leaks and all this stuff they had back there the bible said he humbled them and proved them to prove them to see what was in their heart and many times issues and testings and situations come all to see what's in our heart when brother branham saw a little girl and he called her to come he said he watched to see what she will do her respects to jesus christ her respects and faith in god brahma says if he was a hypocrite god was going to honor the fate so watch this it wasn't so much about abraham it was the faith that was in nothing to girl and if not so much of the pastor the preacher was the fate that you have in your soul tonight god be with you god bless you have a great night thanks again for being here god bless you we love you
