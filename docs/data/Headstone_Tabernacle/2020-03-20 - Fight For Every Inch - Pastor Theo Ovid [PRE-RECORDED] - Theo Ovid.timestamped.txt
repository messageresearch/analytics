[1:31:33] tree his nature for his being fight you
[1:31:37] were supposed to be all the way up there
[1:31:38] by that time bring us into the full
[1:31:42] stature of son or daughter of God a
[1:31:44] church just washed in the blood of Jesus
[1:31:46] Christ bottle of money paid for by the
[1:31:48] birth of Jesus Christ the guide knows
[1:31:50] the way he knows every inch of the way
[1:31:53] he knows every taunt that's in your
[1:31:55] heart he knows everybody that's here he
[1:31:58] knows who you are what you have done all
[1:32:00] about you he is God's guide the Holy
[1:32:03] Spirit and will reveal things to you and

[1:33:01] will not lead you any other way the same
[1:33:03] Holy Spirit where Peter baptizing name
[1:33:05] of Jesus Christ Paul did the same
[1:33:06] without telling him when Peter saw the
[1:33:09] bathroom only goes on sonification and
[1:33:10] so forth Paul did the same thing with
[1:33:12] all concerns
[1:33:12] the church because it was the same
[1:33:14] guided how can we be today
[1:33:16] when people denied these truths when
[1:33:19] Peter taught what he said about the
[1:33:20] church was to be put in order Paul had
[1:33:22] the same doctrine course they had the
[1:33:24] same guy the guide isn't going to take
[1:33:27] one over this way one over that we send
[1:33:30] one ease and one rest
[1:33:31] he's going to keep you together and if
[1:33:34] we just let the Holy Ghost keep us
[1:33:35] together will be one if we don't let the
[1:33:38] devil pull you off to the wrong road
[1:33:40] we'll be in one heart one night one
[1:33:42] Accord by one spirit the Holy Spirit the
[1:33:45] guide of God will guide us to all truth
[1:33:48] that's right you've got to follow the
[1:33:50] guide the Holy Spirit is sent to lead
[1:33:53] the church not some goober man the Holy
[1:33:55] Spirit is all wisdom and when Isaac
