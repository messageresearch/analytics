[45:08] know I know when you hear matters of the
[45:09] heart it sounds like a romance it sounds
[45:12] like a love story but that's what the
[45:15] Bible is a love story amen so tonight
[45:19] we're going to talk about matters of the
[45:21] heart because it's very very important
[45:23] and the scripture that we read we said
[45:25] that he sent Elijah in this hour in this
[45:29] time to turn our hearts back so it means
[45:32] our hearts weren't where they're
[45:34] supposed to be it weren't going in the
[45:36] direction that he expected that he would
[45:38] like us to be at so some intervention
[45:40] had to take place for it to be turned
[45:42] back amen so we just want for our
[45:45] context just to to to acknowledge the
[45:48] fact that God is concerned about the
[45:50] state of your heart amen he is very
[45:53] preoccupied with that he don't want you
[45:56] to to be dece same he don't want you to
[45:58] to live and act and operate the same way
[46:01] over and over year in year out day in
[46:03] day out it's the same all you know he
[46:05] have certain requirements he have
[46:07] certain things he want certain things he
[46:09] like and certain things he
[46:11] dislike amen so we want to examine and
[46:14] explore a couple of those things and and
[46:17] one of the things I want to start off
[46:18] with is the fact that your heart is
[46:20] really designed to be filled you
[46:22] shouldn't have an empty heart the
[46:24] objective is to fill it and to fill it
[46:27] with something that is substantial
[46:29] something that is sustainable right so
[46:32] you you're born with this hunger in your
[46:34] heart and you have to have a cry in your
[46:35] heart you have to have a hunger in your
[46:37] heart for it to be filled and he is here
[46:39] to fill it tonight
[46:42] amen in a message why in
[46:44] 1960 in paragraph 12 the prophet said
[46:48] and that's the reason
[46:49] today that people are dying in the
[46:51] church pews of sin is because they
[46:54] refuse to take the toxin that God has
[46:56] given
[46:57] for the remedy for the the the the the
[46:59] remedy sorry for the cures of
[47:02] heartaches of ills of sicknesses
[47:05] diseases of the heart soul and mind
[47:08] people just refuse to do it it's not
[47:10] easy you know but some people refuse to
[47:12] do it it doesn't change the fact that it
[47:14] is a requirement am amen they say oh
[47:17] that's a bunch of Holy Rollers that's a
[47:19] bunch of Pentecostals and they go ahead
[47:21] and try to hush that blessed thing that
[47:23] God give them did they ever think why
[47:25] does why does a man drink
[47:27] why does somebody drink these are not
[47:29] even my words these are Prophet words
[47:31] why does a man drink why does a man
[47:33] woman young girls go out and look at
[47:35] Migra and and in our context Carnival
[47:39] and get out of these Dives and things is
[47:42] because there's a place in their hearts
[47:44] that's thirsting for something that's
[47:46] hungering for something that desires
[47:48] something that wants more that wants to
[47:50] be filled
[47:51] amen God created them to thirst but he
[47:55] created them to thirst after
[47:58] him they try to hush that blessed holy
[48:01] thirst for the things of the world why
[48:03] you're perverting the very thing that
[48:05] God give the people to thirst for
[48:07] him you are trying to satisfy it with
[48:10] things of the world it will not work it
[48:13] will never work and then if the devil
[48:16] can't get you to do that he gets you to
[48:20] just put your name on a church book and
[48:22] call yourself a Christian he tries to
[48:25] satisfy it with that just just be a a
[48:28] good believer just be a good guy a good
[48:32] girl a good Christian that go to church
[48:34] on a Sunday and a Wednesday and a Friday
[48:37] you want to satisfied with that but
[48:40] there's no satisfaction until God
[48:42] himself comes into the heart to
[48:45] control and to satisfy the people and
[48:49] bless them and give them the things that
[48:51] he has created in their heart he wants
[48:54] to fill that space there's nothing else
[48:57] in the world that could fill that don't
[48:59] you ever forget that nothing you can try
[49:02] nothing you could explore nothing you
[49:04] could examine could fill that void that
[49:07] he has created in you to thirst for
[49:11] him
[49:13] amen so that's just for a context that
[49:16] we know that there's a hunger and a
[49:20] thirst there's a void to be filled and
[49:23] the devil's job is to distract us and
[49:25] fill it with other things
[49:28] but God prepared that to be fill by him
[49:32] to be fill by his love to be filled by
[49:35] his power and his presence he want to
[49:38] fill that with the Holy Ghost he want to
[49:40] fill you he want to satisfy you so
[49:43] you'll never thirst again
[49:44] amen so we know that God looks at your
[49:48] heart in in the book of Samuel you don't
[49:50] have to find it the Lord said unto
[49:52] Samuel this is 1st Samuel 16:7 it says
[49:56] but the Lord said said unto Samuel look
[49:58] not at his countenance and I'm sure you
[50:00] could recall we preach about this many
[50:02] many times and with his natural eyes he
[50:06] looked at the
[50:08] sons of of David he looked at Saul and
[50:11] he looked at different ones and with the
[50:13] natural eye he said unto Samuel look not
[50:16] at his
[50:17] countenance or on the height of his
[50:19] stature because I have refused him
[50:22] referring to Saul Saul was a decent guy
[50:26] you know Saul was from The Tribe of
[50:29] Benjamin Saul was all right Saul was the
[50:32] chosen man for the hour at that time but
[50:35] God found a better man and at that point
[50:37] he say listen I refuse all know I done
[50:40] with him I know you are looking at the
[50:42] fact that he's tall and he's stately and
[50:45] and he look like he has confidence and
[50:47] he could command attention and he has
[50:49] Charisma and class but I refuse that cuz
[50:52] I don't look at that he said for a man
[50:55] lookth on the on on the outward
[50:58] appearance but God look it on the heart
[51:01] so that's what we want to talk about
[51:03] tonight the heart matters pertaining to
[51:06] the heart matters of the heart things
[51:08] related to the heart and getting your
[51:11] heart filled and right with God amen
[51:13] amen amen now I I know I'm not going to
[51:17] stay very long but once we establish
[51:20] that I want to just highlight the fact
[51:23] that God wants to hide his word in your
[51:26] your heart am he wants that for you it's
[51:31] not going to drop down magically he
[51:33] wants you to keep it there he want you
[51:34] to hold it close he wants you to hold it
[51:36] near and dear to you in Psalm chapter
[51:39] 119:1 and you'll hear me quoting quite a
[51:42] bit from the Bible because I use this as
[51:44] a reference here to to highlight my
[51:46] point it said Thy word have i hidden my
[51:49] heart that I may not sin against thee
[51:52] right so that in in itself was an
[51:54] inoculation to sin when the devil
[51:57] tempted Jesus he said the word the word
[52:02] the word it was inside so it could come
[52:05] out because what's inside of you could
[52:08] come out of you and you'll see it in a
[52:10] little bit so it's important that you
[52:13] take that and take the word and hide it
[52:16] in your heart so nobody could pluck it
[52:18] away nobody could deceive you nobody
[52:21] could fool you because you have his word
[52:22] and you hold on to it amen now why are
[52:26] we worried and concerned cuz it sounds
[52:28] good you have a space in your heart a
[52:30] void that is to be filled by God what
[52:32] could go wrong you see Satan wants to
[52:35] fill that void and he is very successful
[52:38] in doing so at times but not with his
[52:41] bride we want to be aware of his devices
[52:44] so we wouldn't succumb to that amen so
[52:48] Satan could fill your
[52:49] heart in the book of Acts chapter 5 and
[52:52] verse one and we familiar with with
[52:54] these but a certain man
[52:57] named
[52:59] ananas with Safara his wife sold a
[53:02] possession and in verse two and kept
[53:04] back part of the price his wife also
[53:08] being privy to it and bought a certain
[53:11] part and laid it at the apostles feet in
[53:14] verse three but Peter said anas why has
[53:17] Satan filled thine heart to lie to the
[53:20] Holy Ghost so you allowed Satan to take
[53:24] that space you allow allowed Satan to be
[53:27] master of that that God created to be
[53:30] fill by him you allowed Satan to take
[53:33] over and cause you to lie to the Holy
[53:35] Ghost so this is not your will that you
[53:37] trying to outsmart everybody else you
[53:38] know but you allow Satan to fill that
[53:41] space and Peter called it out there he
[53:44] said listen why you allow
[53:46] that and to keep back parts of the price
[53:49] of the land while it remained was it not
[53:52] thine
[53:53] own we didn't beg you for it we didn't
[53:56] we didn't ask you for it we didn't
[53:57] solicit it you volunteered that wasn't
[54:00] that yours to give wasn't that yours to
[54:03] do what whatever you wanted to and after
[54:06] it was sold was it not thine own power
[54:09] you had the ability to do whatever you
[54:11] wanted with it because it was yours why
[54:14] hast thou con conceived this thing in
[54:17] thine heart so it was so important the
[54:20] Holy Ghost true Peter was showing us
[54:23] something here that it's so important
[54:26] that you Monitor and observe and
[54:28] maintain the position that you can't
[54:30] allow the devil to to take over in your
[54:32] heart because the result of that is
[54:34] judgment and death amen why hast thou
[54:38] conceived this thing in thy heart thou
[54:41] Hast not lied unto men but unto
[54:44] God now I want to shift gears a little
[54:47] bit you see there are some persons due
[54:51] to circumstance and due to to events
[54:54] around them they they tend to get cold
[54:57] they they Harden their heart in
[54:58] particular ways and they get upset and
[55:00] they don't want anybody talk to them and
[55:02] stuff like that but true scripture we
[55:05] will see and I will highlight it here
[55:08] you see anytime your heart starts to get
[55:11] hard is a sure sign that your judgment
[55:14] about to strike is a sure sign that
[55:17] you're about to fail is a sure sign that
[55:20] you're about to fall you see if your
[55:22] heart is being hardened your judgment
[55:25] and destru ruction is near so it's a
[55:28] sure sign if you realize listen are
[55:31] getting upset and and angered just by
[55:34] the sight of this one just by getting
[55:36] these feelings right of your heart being
[55:39] cold and hard and formal in the Book of
[55:42] Joshua chapter 11 and in verse 18 it
[55:46] says Joshua made War a long time with
[55:49] all those kings and just as a
[55:52] background in the background of that
[55:54] you'll remember when Joshua got his
[55:57] commission his objective was to
[56:00] challenge everybody and beat everything
[56:03] standing from children go up just blaze
[56:06] a trail every place you put your foot is
[56:08] yours just conquer just fight you listen
[56:12] this is the one man I know in Trinidad
[56:15] they're talking about anti-bullying
[56:17] campaign now Joshua could just go and
[56:19] challenge you and you sure you're
[56:20] defeated because he had god with him and
[56:23] he was commissioned to do so to take the
[56:25] land and the divide the inheritance unto
[56:27] the people of Israel amen so in Joshua
[56:30] 11:18 it say Joshua made War a long time
[56:33] with all those kings every King he met
[56:36] he made war with there was not a city
[56:39] that made peace with the children of of
[56:40] of Israel so he was I mean he was firing
[56:44] from from the hips he wasn't hesitating
[56:46] to go to war right they says save the
[56:49] hivites the inhabitants of gibon all
[56:53] other they took in battle for it was the
[56:55] Lord Lord listen the Lord to harden
[56:58] their hearts that they should come
[57:00] against Israel in battle so God was
[57:03] hardening their hearts and when they
[57:05] Harden their hearts they believ they
[57:07] could face Israel and when they face
[57:10] Israel listen what it says that he might
[57:13] destroy them
[57:14] utterly and that they might have no
[57:17] favor but that he might destroy them as
[57:19] the Lord commanded Moses so it wasn't
[57:23] them just sitting in a corner and their
[57:25] heart getting Harden you know
[57:27] God was hardening their hearts to come
[57:28] against Israel but God gave Israel the
[57:31] ability to blaze anything moving I mean
[57:34] I know it sounds a little unfair but I
[57:35] just thank God that I'm on The Winning
[57:37] Side so it doesn't matter the way it
[57:39] sounds it doesn't M matter the way you
[57:41] logically think about it sounds kind of
[57:43] unfair but here the thing and it's not
[57:45] once you do it I'll show you you do it
[57:46] over and over and over again so you see
[57:49] that person that hat you and they don't
[57:50] know why and their heart Harden against
[57:53] you and they they battling you listen
[57:55] something sometimes God had in their
[57:57] heart to challenge you know because he
[57:59] want the glory eventually he know he
[58:01] give you the ability before the
[58:03] foundation of the world to blaze them
[58:05] know he know the commission he give you
[58:07] he know listen you above and not beneath
[58:09] know you're the head and not the tail
[58:10] know he knows you're more than a
[58:12] conqueror and the battle is already won
[58:14] he knows that for
[58:16] you so listen want to shift to the Book
[58:19] of Exodus on the same point of him
[58:21] hardening Hearts Exodus
[58:24] 14:15 speaking about Moses mooses and it
[58:27] says and the Lord said unto Moses
[58:29] wherefore criest thou unto me if you
[58:31] could recall on the way out they were
[58:34] heading out of Egypt the the enemy
[58:37] behind him Pharaoh behind him and I
[58:38] don't have the time to go through it now
[58:41] but God told Moses before he went to
[58:45] Egypt here here what he said he said
[58:47] listen you will be the
[58:51] god Aaron will be your Prophet so is a
[58:54] Twan Army r with they're seeing two
[58:57] persons he said but in addition to that
[59:00] I'm going to harden Pharaoh's
[59:03] heart I'm going to harden his heart
[59:06] against anything you say against the
[59:08] people of is of Israel I could assure
[59:11] you I will make sure his heart is
[59:12] hardened why because I tell you this
[59:15] part I'm going to allow him to get blaze
[59:18] I go and defeat him I go slame utterly
[59:21] he will listen he will forget he will
[59:24] wish he had never had a bad thought
[59:26] about you right so and when you read the
[59:29] scripture you see it was repeated over
[59:31] and over so listen we talk about flies
[59:34] and frogs and and water turn to blood
[59:37] and stuff but before everything happened
[59:39] every single time he said listen I go
[59:42] hard in Pharaoh's heart so he wouldn't
[59:44] release them because I want to give him
[59:48] almost not not necessar excuse but I
[59:50] want to give him a a a a Vigor I want to
[59:54] give give him a passion to to go against
[59:56] so I will harden his heart knowing that
[59:59] you have the victory already now he tell
[1:00:01] Moses this before he gone know when he
[1:00:04] given him the commission Moses already
[1:00:06] know I mean human nature may have you
[1:00:09] thinking a little bit you know I wonder
[1:00:11] Bo is is that really the voice of God I
[1:00:12] heard because he tell me and a stutter
[1:00:15] at times and he really tell me that Aon
[1:00:18] would speak on my behalf and but you
[1:00:20] know what when you have your trust in
[1:00:22] God it doesn't matter how you feel about
[1:00:25] it it's going to come to pass regardless
[1:00:28] so in in the context of that in Exodus
[1:00:32] 14:15 the Lord said unto Moses wherefore
[1:00:35] criest thou unto me so they're halfway
[1:00:37] out they says speak unto the children of
[1:00:40] Israel that they go forward but lift up
[1:00:43] thy rod and stretch thy hand over the
[1:00:45] sea and divide it and the children of
[1:00:47] Israel shall go on dry ground through
[1:00:49] the midst of the sea in verse 17 it says
[1:00:51] and I behold I will harden the hearts of
[1:00:54] the EGP Egyptians so it wasn't Pharaoh
[1:00:57] anymore it was the Egyptians now so he
[1:01:00] wasn't just in the leadership you know
[1:01:02] he came among the masses among the
[1:01:04] people among the soldiers among the
[1:01:06] servants and the slaves he said I will
[1:01:08] harden the hearts of the Egyptians and
[1:01:10] they shall follow them so they shall
[1:01:12] follow the children of Israel and listen
[1:01:15] listen why I will get me honor upon
[1:01:19] pharaoh and upon all his hosts upon his
[1:01:22] chariots upon his Horsemen and the
[1:01:26] Egyptians shall know that I am the Lord
[1:01:28] when I have gotten me honor upon Pharaoh
[1:01:30] upon his chariots and upon his Horsemen
[1:01:33] the Egyptians will know I am the Lord so
[1:01:36] you could hold them in bondage in other
[1:01:38] words you tonight could be in bondage
[1:01:40] your children could be in bondage for
[1:01:42] the last 20 years it doesn't matter the
[1:01:46] enemy's Hearts can be hardened against
[1:01:48] you against your family against your
[1:01:50] loved ones it doesn't matter because at
[1:01:52] the appointed time when God decide times
[1:01:55] up
[1:01:56] he only set that up and Harden the heart
[1:01:59] for you to win the battle here know for
[1:02:01] him to get the glory you know he said
[1:02:02] listen I will get honor upon Pharaoh his
[1:02:06] chariots his Horsemen all the host it
[1:02:09] doesn't matter he is going to give you
[1:02:11] the victory Amen in a message the 7 the
[1:02:15] 70th week of Daniel paragraph
[1:02:19] 158 he says everything has fell right in
[1:02:23] their hand how did they do it
[1:02:26] because and he he went through history
[1:02:28] here he said Hitler's Hearts was
[1:02:30] hardened melini's heart was hardened so
[1:02:34] he is not now doing this you know this
[1:02:37] this is what you call hismo he does this
[1:02:39] all the time anytime he want to get
[1:02:42] major Glory he will harden the heart of
[1:02:45] the so-called enemy in this case to
[1:02:48] ensure that it's not by might it's not
[1:02:50] by power it's not by strength it's not
[1:02:52] because you have an army no it's because
[1:02:54] he could do it and just because he could
[1:02:56] do it he doing it he say he Harden
[1:02:58] melini's heart just like Pharaoh's heart
[1:03:01] was hardened and driving them back in
[1:03:03] that land and for 40 years they have
[1:03:06] been coming back into that land speaking
[1:03:07] of the Jews now they there they sat
[1:03:11] waiting the Gentile church is in the L
[1:03:15] leodan End of the leodan Age if the Jews
[1:03:18] are in the Homeland already and the
[1:03:21] Gentile apostasy has already taken place
[1:03:24] and if we have a president like we have
[1:03:26] we have a nation that's broken up like
[1:03:28] we have we have atomic bombs hanging in
[1:03:31] the hangers we have a church at lukewarm
[1:03:34] we have a church of people that draw
[1:03:36] theel together we have a Ministry that
[1:03:38] pattern the ministry of Jesus Christ for
[1:03:41] to catch a stone when it comes what's
[1:03:43] left to happen it might be at any minute
[1:03:47] there isn't nothing else left we're at
[1:03:49] the end time Oh Glory I don't know
[1:03:51] whether I'm going to be able to get into
[1:03:53] that Jubilee or not but I just want to
[1:03:55] to get part of it to you anyhow so it
[1:03:59] was so important to him that the prophet
[1:04:02] said listen everything is in place so
[1:04:04] know he had in the heart throughout
[1:04:06] history and he continues to do it now
[1:04:09] also you thought you had no trials going
[1:04:11] to come you thought it was going to be
[1:04:13] easy pickings from from now no he have
[1:04:16] to harden the heart of of of of of the
[1:04:18] oppressors to ensure he could get the
[1:04:20] glory amen
[1:04:24] [Applause]
[1:04:28] now there are times when we talking
[1:04:29] about this hard thing and I'm not a a
[1:04:31] medical doctor a cardiologist or
[1:04:32] anything but we talking about matters of
[1:04:33] the
[1:04:35] heart doubt could fill your
[1:04:37] heart is that right doubt could fill
[1:04:41] your heart instead of
[1:04:43] Faith instead of Love instead of hiding
[1:04:46] the word inside some people allow doubt
[1:04:49] to fill the heart now in St Mark
[1:04:53] 11:23 you know the scripture early I say
[1:04:56] unto you whosoever shall say unto this
[1:04:59] mountain be thou removed and be cast
[1:05:02] into the sea and shall not doubt in his
[1:05:05] heart but Shall Believe on those things
[1:05:07] which he
[1:05:09] shall which he said shall come to pass
[1:05:12] he shall have whatsoever he said so that
[1:05:15] speaks about Fai H if you want to be
[1:05:18] healed tonight and you harboring doubt
[1:05:21] in your heart where is the space for
[1:05:24] Faith to work
[1:05:27] you had to eliminate that you had to get
[1:05:30] rid of that so these are some of the
[1:05:32] things we can't allow to
[1:05:34] happen you can't have your heart getting
[1:05:36] hardened you can't have doubt in your
[1:05:38] heart
[1:05:40] amen you can't be be just going through
[1:05:44] and and Satan in your heart so you
[1:05:46] expressing all kind of foolishness but
[1:05:49] you need to have the word you need to
[1:05:50] have
[1:05:52] love you need to have faith
[1:05:56] there's also there's also the fact that
[1:05:58] your heart could condemn
[1:06:00] you yeah the same heart you know the
[1:06:03] Same Heart we're referring to could
[1:06:05] condemn you in 1 John chapter 3: 18 it
[1:06:09] says my little children let us not love
[1:06:12] in word neither in tongue but in deed
[1:06:15] and in
[1:06:16] truth you know some folks could put on a
[1:06:18] good
[1:06:19] show he's saying let's don't do that
[1:06:22] don't pretend to
[1:06:24] love love
[1:06:27] by
[1:06:28] deed love is an action word show love so
[1:06:32] you could feel it and you know it you do
[1:06:34] to ask how do I know you love me no
[1:06:41] because is an active action thing Amen
[1:06:45] in verse 19 it says and hereby we know
[1:06:47] that we are of the truth and shall
[1:06:50] assure our hearts before him for if our
[1:06:53] heart condemn us God is is greater than
[1:06:56] our heart and knoweth all things beloved
[1:07:00] if our heart condemn us not then we have
[1:07:03] then have we confidence towards
[1:07:06] God and whatsoever we ask we shall
[1:07:08] receive of him because we keep his
[1:07:11] Commandments and do those things that
[1:07:13] are pleasing in his sight so
[1:07:16] essentially if your heart condemn you
[1:07:18] you're not free you're bound up so you
[1:07:22] can't ask liberally knowing with faith
[1:07:25] that is going to be done so you ask kind
[1:07:27] of tentatively apprehensively because
[1:07:30] you know chances are the way I living he
[1:07:34] not going to do it you know the way I
[1:07:36] operating he not going to do it the way
[1:07:38] I thinking he not going and respond I
[1:07:41] don't really pray so he must he don't
[1:07:43] even know who I am chances are with that
[1:07:46] kind of
[1:07:47] condemnation you go nowhere you know so
[1:07:50] we had to eliminate that too in a
[1:07:52] message per perfect Faith paragraph
[1:07:56] 67 Abraham said but as long as you're
[1:07:58] doing things that's wrong you can't have
[1:08:00] confidence towards God so you see you
[1:08:03] can you'll automatically know that
[1:08:05] you're wrong most folks you know when
[1:08:08] when you're wrong you know you know
[1:08:09] you're wrong before before anything else
[1:08:11] happen you know you're
[1:08:13] wrong he say you automatically put
[1:08:15] yourself back there as Sinner by knowing
[1:08:18] that you're wrong but when your heart
[1:08:19] don't condemn you you know you're you're
[1:08:21] a
[1:08:22] Believer and there's nothing between you
[1:08:24] and God you can ask God what you will
[1:08:27] and know it'll be given because it's the
[1:08:29] word that God's given to you just like
[1:08:31] it was to these disciples now the only
[1:08:34] thing you have to do then is have faith
[1:08:37] in what you
[1:08:38] are have faith in what the word says
[1:08:40] that you are and Jesus had faith in the
[1:08:43] word of God and said what he was he said
[1:08:46] it is written of me didn't David in
[1:08:48] Psalms and the prophets and all of them
[1:08:50] speak of him I'm the bread of life that
[1:08:53] comes from God out of Heaven amen amen I
[1:08:56] am that tree of life from the Garden of
[1:08:57] Eden I am all these things I am that
[1:09:00] that I am he knew with that perfect
[1:09:03] faith that he was the anointed Messiah
[1:09:07] that the spirit of God was upon him he
[1:09:09] said now I in myself do nothing but it's
[1:09:12] my faith in God and God was in him the
[1:09:16] word made manifest and when the word of
[1:09:18] God comes in you and that's what we
[1:09:20] saying when the word of God comes in
[1:09:21] your heart it's made manifest for you
[1:09:25] are believer see the faith of God that
[1:09:28] moves in you is the believer that's why
[1:09:31] you want faith in your heart that's why
[1:09:33] you want the word in your heart that is
[1:09:35] why you want God to dwell in your heart
[1:09:37] so you could only reflect God you could
[1:09:40] only reflect Faith you could only
[1:09:42] reflect the word
[1:09:45] amen I want to quickly run through
[1:09:47] because I know time is is is is running
[1:09:51] away there's a scripture we we often
[1:09:53] read and and some times I think sometime
[1:09:56] we don't pay enough attention to it the
[1:09:57] Book of Luke chapter 6 verse
[1:10:00] 54 and I'll reference the theme in a
[1:10:03] second a good man out of the good
[1:10:06] Treasure of his heart bringeth forth
[1:10:08] that which is
[1:10:09] good The Treasure of his heart not the
[1:10:13] things he think about you know not his
[1:10:15] plans you know The Treasure of his heart
[1:10:17] speaking about what's inside it goes on
[1:10:20] to say and an evil man out of the evil
[1:10:23] Treasure of his heart bringing forth
[1:10:25] that which which is evil for of the
[1:10:27] abundance of the heart his mouth
[1:10:31] speaketh so it's easy to tell what's on
[1:10:33] the inside you know because it's
[1:10:36] reflected it comes out automatically you
[1:10:39] could only hide for so long know but
[1:10:41] after a while I like to say it leaks out
[1:10:45] it does leak out at times so you
[1:10:47] protected and you pretend and you put on
[1:10:49] the good show but at times the real you
[1:10:52] does leak out and when it leak out
[1:10:54] that's what in your heart you know
[1:10:56] that is the real you that is you when
[1:10:59] nobody else
[1:11:00] around so out of the abundance of your
[1:11:03] heart the mouth
[1:11:05] speaks the mouth give utterance based on
[1:11:08] what you have on the
[1:11:10] inside so the prophet was sent and it
[1:11:13] says behold I will send you Elijah
[1:11:16] before the coming of the great and
[1:11:18] Dreadful day of the Lord and he shall
[1:11:21] turn the heart of the fathers to the
[1:11:24] children and the hearts of the children
[1:11:26] to the fathers least I come and smite
[1:11:29] the Earth with a curse so he was sent to
[1:11:32] ensure that he know God watching your
[1:11:35] heart God concerned and it it is very
[1:11:38] important to him so he want to ensure
[1:11:41] that he sent a prophet to lay his word
[1:11:44] down in such Simplicity that when you're
[1:11:48] done your heart right you that when
[1:11:49] you're done your mind right you know
[1:11:51] that when you're done you could forgive
[1:11:53] when you're done you could love when
[1:11:54] you're done you could drop your hearts
[1:11:56] because you want to be able to ask and
[1:11:58] know that it's it's done you want to ask
[1:12:01] and know that it will be given you want
[1:12:03] to ask by faith you don't want any
[1:12:05] hindrances you don't want Satan fill
[1:12:07] your heart you don't want your heart to
[1:12:09] be hardened no so he sent Malachi for to
[1:12:13] ensure that this could happen amen
[1:12:17] David in Book of Psalms chapter
[1:12:20] 5110 and we know it we sing it we say it
[1:12:23] he said create in me a clean heart oh
[1:12:25] God and renew a right spirit in me it
[1:12:29] was that important he put it in song he
[1:12:31] wrote it down he he listen he meditate
[1:12:34] on this you know cuz you'll see it like
[1:12:37] a theme Time After Time After Time he
[1:12:40] talk about a broken heart a contrite
[1:12:43] heart a broken Spirit he wanted to be
[1:12:46] humble he wanted to be pure he wanted to
[1:12:48] be clean he wanted to be a particular
[1:12:50] way because he wanted to please God and
[1:12:53] God in turn say listen you see that fell
[1:12:55] there I know he he Frau with weaknesses
[1:12:57] you know I know he have challenges if
[1:12:59] you look for it oh gosh you wouldn't
[1:13:02] finish but that guy is a man after my
[1:13:05] own heart that guy is a guy that I am
[1:13:08] pleased with that guy is a guy I could
[1:13:11] endorse amen so it says cast me not away
[1:13:15] from thy presence and take not thy Holy
[1:13:18] Spirit from me restore unto me the joy
[1:13:21] of thy salvation and uphold me with thy
[1:13:23] free spirit it goes on in that same
[1:13:26] chapter in verse 17 it says the
[1:13:28] sacrifices of God are a broken spirit
[1:13:31] and a contrite heart oh God that thou
[1:13:35] thou will not despise that's what he
[1:13:37] looking for my question is it written
[1:13:40] here in the
[1:13:41] scripture how do we apply this how do we
[1:13:45] take this seriously do you have a broken
[1:13:48] heart a broken Spirit a contrite heart
[1:13:51] are you
[1:13:52] humble are you forgiving are you Lov
[1:13:55] or are you sitting back and allowing the
[1:13:58] Devil to take residence in your heart
[1:14:01] are you allowing Satan to use
[1:14:04] you that heart was created for God to
[1:14:07] dwell in
[1:14:08] you despite what scientists say about
[1:14:11] pumping blood all over all over the
[1:14:12] place God have a special place that he
[1:14:15] want to dwell in your hearts you know
[1:14:18] don't get me wrong I'm not against the
[1:14:19] health but God more important than the
[1:14:22] health you know he could heal you
[1:14:25] he could deliver you he could seal you
[1:14:29] he could restore you he could baptize
[1:14:31] you he could bring you back the way it
[1:14:34] was before you know before anything else
[1:14:36] went wrong so this is what he asked for
[1:14:39] he said listen don't go trying to
[1:14:41] sacrifice the world don't go trying to
[1:14:43] burn everything down no he said but
[1:14:45] bring your heart for me let me check it
[1:14:46] out is it contrite is it
[1:14:50] humble are you trying to live out the
[1:14:52] the way that I want you to live
[1:14:55] in in Psalm
[1:14:57] 34:14 he goes on he say listen depart
[1:15:00] from Evil and do good seek peace and
[1:15:03] pursue it all these are
[1:15:05] instructions depart from Evil and do
[1:15:07] good seek peace and pursue it the eyes
[1:15:10] of the Lord are upon the righteous and
[1:15:12] the ears are open unto their cry the
[1:15:14] face of the Lord is against them that do
[1:15:16] evil to cut off the rembrance of them
[1:15:19] from the earth listen the righteous cry
[1:15:21] and the Lord heareth and deliver them
[1:15:24] out of the their troubles the Lord is
[1:15:27] nigh unto them that are of a broken
[1:15:29] heart and save it such as be of a
[1:15:33] contrite spirit so I didn't read proud
[1:15:37] and hay and arrogant and rude here and
[1:15:39] disrespectful you know nowhere in this
[1:15:42] Psalm did I read any of those adjectives
[1:15:44] I didn't hear D David come and say well
[1:15:48] you know I'm King David say you know who
[1:15:51] you're talking to the Lord and I have a
[1:15:53] special Rel I didn't read that know he

[1:16:17] are you hungering and thirsting to be
[1:16:19] closer to

[1:16:24] him but if that is so and you have a a
[1:16:26] broken heart and a contrite spirit guess
[1:16:28] what he'll be drawn closer to you it
[1:16:31] goes on in the book of Chronicles 1
[1:16:33] Chronicles 168 he said give thanks unto

[1:16:39] his deeds among the people so testify on

[1:16:50] Thanksgiving make sure people know
[1:16:52] listen it's not by might or power or

[1:17:01] you they say make known his deeds among
[1:17:03] the People Sing unto him sing Psalms
[1:17:06] unto him talk ye of all his wondrous
[1:17:10] Works glory in His holy name and and

[1:17:49] testify about the goodness of God seek
[1:17:52] Him and rejoice and be glad listen

[1:17:57] love the Lord thy God with all thy
[1:18:00] heart trust the Lord with all your heart
[1:18:04] not a kind of partial good morning Lord
[1:18:07] you know I acknowledge you now but for
[1:18:09] the rest of the month now it's mon so I
[1:18:12] than you a little bit I might get pay
[1:18:14] but come between the the second and the
[1:18:16] and the two 23rd or so is pressure out
[1:18:20] here know you don't know what these
[1:18:23] people these Egyptians on job doing no

[1:18:32] acknowledge that he has kept you thus
[1:18:34] far and he who has brought you to this
[1:18:37] point is more than able to deliver and
[1:18:41] see your through till the end and listen
[1:18:44] the things that you think are problems
[1:18:46] and troubles and challenges he going to
[1:18:49] show you that listen I just do that for
[1:18:50] my glory you know I just do that to to
[1:18:54] ensure that you understand and you
[1:18:56] remember that I am in control you know
[1:18:59] it's not by you you know it's nothing
[1:19:00] that you could do you are failure but
[1:19:03] because of who your father
[1:19:05] is you're going to be all right you'll
[1:19:08] get the
[1:19:09] victory so in the book of Deuteronomy
[1:19:13] chapter
[1:19:15] 6 verse 4 it says here oh Israel the
[1:19:18] Lord our God is one Lord and thou shalt
[1:19:21] love thy God with all thy heart and with
[1:19:23] all thy soul and with all thy might amen
[1:19:26] and these words which I listen which I
[1:19:28] command you here just speaking it
[1:19:31] because he feel listen to the command he
[1:19:33] said which I command thee this day these
[1:19:36] words shall be in your heart to love the
[1:19:38] Lord so in your in your heart make sure
[1:19:40] to have a space for loving God God want
[1:19:44] that he want you in your heart to love
[1:19:46] him he put a space there for that he say
[1:19:51] listen it shall be in thine heart hear
[1:19:53] what else he said and thou shalt teach
[1:19:57] them diligently unto thy children and
[1:20:00] shall talk of them when thou sest in thy
[1:20:03] house and when thou west by the way and
[1:20:06] when thou liest down and when thou
[1:20:08] risest up now I don't know about you but
[1:20:11] if I translate this to our local Palance
[1:20:14] this is every day all time
[1:20:16] only talk about him thank him love him
[1:20:21] Express teach your children when when
[1:20:23] all you're talking is not old banal and
[1:20:25] what happened on Facebook yesterday and
[1:20:28] what happened on I don't know Instagram
[1:20:30] or or Tik Tok or wherever no the love of
[1:20:32] God listen teach them to love God with
[1:20:35] their heart with all their heart teach
[1:20:38] them he say I command you to hold this
[1:20:42] in your heart hold it close teach them
[1:20:44] diligently they say teach it diligently
[1:20:47] to your children so when they grow up
[1:20:49] they wouldn't forget it when they grow
[1:20:51] up they wouldn't depart from the lessons
[1:20:52] that you teach them it goes on in the
[1:20:56] Book of Proverbs chap chapter
[1:20:58] 3 speaking about trusting God they say
[1:21:01] my son forget not my law that sound just
[1:21:04] like the scripture before when you do it
[1:21:06] over and over it kind of hard to forget
[1:21:07] to know because it becomes part of you
[1:21:10] it becomes
[1:21:12] custom I remember one guy one time he
[1:21:14] told me you know what a customer is he
[1:21:16] say a customer is somebody who get a
[1:21:18] custom buying from
[1:21:20] you it becomes so routine they don't
[1:21:24] think of anything else you are top of
[1:21:26] mind so they so accustomed doing it they
[1:21:29] become your customer and they do it over
[1:21:31] and over so here the scripture saying
[1:21:33] listen I want you to get accustomed to
[1:21:36] doing this I want you to trust and love
[1:21:39] and speak and do this so many times that
[1:21:41] afterwards Hallelujah it feels like it's
[1:21:44] innate it feels like you're born with it
[1:21:47] it feels like that's part of you it
[1:21:49] can't separate it so when the scripture
[1:21:51] say what could separate me from the love
[1:21:53] of God nothing
[1:21:55] no fine War pestilence flood no no
[1:21:59] family drama nothing will separate you
[1:22:02] because this is part of me you feel the
[1:22:05] love of Jesus it's so wonderful it it
[1:22:07] just surround you that's what you have
[1:22:09] to give that's what will leak out that's
[1:22:12] what you will speak you will speak
[1:22:14] goodness and mercy and love and grace
[1:22:16] over people because that's what in your
[1:22:18] heart in Proverbs one he said my son
[1:22:20] forget not my law but let thine heart
[1:22:23] keep my Commandments not you know he
[1:22:25] said let your heart keep it let your
[1:22:28] heart keep it for length of days you see
[1:22:31] why not because I want you to learn 2 by
[1:22:34] two is four and four fours are 16 no he
[1:22:37] said there's a purpose for that for
[1:22:39] length of days and long life you want to
[1:22:42] live long keep that in your heart let
[1:22:45] your heart remember the
[1:22:47] Commandments he say and peace shall they
[1:22:50] add to thee so all this drama you're
[1:22:52] going through could be avoided by doing
[1:22:55] this yes hallelujah it's right here
[1:22:58] that's what it says in verse three he
[1:23:00] said let not mercy and Truth forsake
[1:23:03] thee bind them about thy neck write them
[1:23:06] upon the table of your heart put it
[1:23:09] there so shall thy found so so shall
[1:23:13] thou find favor and good understanding
[1:23:15] in the sight of God and man so wait now
[1:23:21] you mean all this drama you going
[1:23:23] through on the job and in school and in
[1:23:26] in in the neighborhood and the community
[1:23:29] if you focus on this you will find favor
[1:23:33] and good understanding in the sight of
[1:23:35] God and man yes that's what the word say
[1:23:39] in verse 5 here what it says trust in
[1:23:41] the Lord with all thy heart lean not
[1:23:44] onto thy own understanding listen in all
[1:23:47] thy ways we know the scripture
[1:23:49] acknowledge Him so thank him honor him

[1:23:55] responsible for your success he have you
[1:23:58] where you are tonight he brought you
[1:24:01] safely he kept you it may not seem
[1:24:04] perfect but it's his will for your life
[1:24:06] right now he have you where you are for
[1:24:08] a purpose acknowledge Him and He Shall
[1:24:12] direct your paths everywhere you have to

[1:24:18] you don't have to figure it out he will
[1:24:21] show you where he wants you to go and
[1:24:22] where he want you to stay away from
[1:24:24] in verse 7 it says be not wise in thy
[1:24:27] own eyes fear the lord and depart from
[1:24:31] Evil
[1:24:33] amen isn't God
[1:24:35] wonderful still speaking about the heart
[1:24:38] to know these are matters of the heart
[1:24:40] if we could get these things right we'll
[1:24:42] be in order know we'll be all right you
[1:24:44] know if we could get these things right
[1:24:48] in the Book of Joel chapter 2 chapter 2
[1:24:51] verse3 it says
[1:24:55] and Rend your heart let me say it slowly
[1:24:58] and Rend your heart and not your
[1:25:01] garments and turn unto the Lord your God
[1:25:05] for he is gracious and merciful slow to
[1:25:07] anger and of great kindness and repented
[1:25:10] him of the evil and Rend in that context
[1:25:13] is to rip up tear
[1:25:16] up you know you say I I abhor
[1:25:21] myself listen I'm
[1:25:23] nothing I I am leas of the tribe and
[1:25:26] bottom of the barrel rip rip it up you
[1:25:29] know good he say Rend your heart don't
[1:25:33] don't rip up your clothes don't put on a
[1:25:35] show for people because you want them
[1:25:37] feel your real spiritual
[1:25:39] no you surrender your heart to God you
[1:25:43] surrender your life to God and see what
[1:25:46] he will do through you see what he'll do
[1:25:49] in your life you'll be
[1:25:51] shocked and we touched on this one
[1:25:53] before
[1:25:55] and it was highlighted in a couple
[1:25:57] places right where in the book of Acts
[1:26:01] chapter 13 it says and when he had
[1:26:03] removed him he raised up unto them David
[1:26:06] to be their King which is when they
[1:26:07] removed Saul to whom he also gave their
[1:26:10] testimony and said I have found David
[1:26:13] the son of Jesse a man after mine own
[1:26:15] heart which shall fulfill all my will
[1:26:19] you see part of his will is to fulfill
[1:26:22] all of his will right right and part of
[1:26:25] his will for you is to fill you with the
[1:26:27] Holy
[1:26:28] Ghost he want to give you a new
[1:26:31] heart he in the Book of Ezekiel chapter
[1:26:34] 36 and I'm winding down now 36: 26 he
[1:26:38] says a new heart also will I give you
[1:26:41] and a new spirit I will put within you
[1:26:44] and I will take away the Stony heart out
[1:26:46] of your flesh and I'll give you a heart
[1:26:48] of Flesh so you remember earlier on when
[1:26:51] I said your heart hardened
[1:26:55] here he's saying listen sometimes it's a
[1:26:56] little Stony because you're not all
[1:26:58] right you know in your human senses have
[1:27:02] your ways but you say I want to take
[1:27:04] that out too you know I want to replace
[1:27:07] that with a new heart a heart of Flesh a
[1:27:09] heart that I could dwell in a heart that
[1:27:12] could really fully surrender to me so
[1:27:15] you could love me with all your heart
[1:27:17] cuz you say I will give you a new heart
[1:27:20] and I will put my spirit in there and I
[1:27:23] will take away the ston heart the old
[1:27:25] one you have you want to take that out
[1:27:26] and give your heart of Flesh in Proverbs
[1:27:29] 23 verse 7 and we know this one it says
[1:27:33] for as he thinketh in his heart so your
[1:27:36] your heart could think yes your heart
[1:27:39] could remember your heart could could
[1:27:41] could take notes your heart could
[1:27:43] believe and trust and love yes it can
[1:27:46] you say for as he thinket in his heart
[1:27:49] so is he eat and drink said he to thee
[1:27:53] but his heart is not with thee so once
[1:27:55] again say what they want at the end of
[1:27:58] the day what
[1:28:00] inside is what will come
[1:28:03] out as you think in your heart that is
[1:28:05] you and know it don't matter you could
[1:28:07] paint it up as as they say you could put
[1:28:09] a bow on a pig is still a pig on the
[1:28:11] inside is a pig so you might be in
[1:28:15] disguised
[1:28:16] tonight but the faith in you is the
[1:28:19] believer
[1:28:22] Amen in Proverbs 423 it says keep thy
[1:28:26] heart with all diligence for out of it
[1:28:29] are the issues of life so guide it take
[1:28:33] care of it monitor it watch it don't
[1:28:36] just leave it to do its own thing no you
[1:28:40] have a role to play you have a
[1:28:42] responsibility you have been guided
[1:28:45] instructed and commanded to do
[1:28:46] particular things and that's what he
[1:28:48] wants of you musician could get ready at
[1:28:51] this point at the end of the day he
[1:28:54] wants a pure heart he wants a clean
[1:28:56] heart he wants a heart that he could
[1:28:58] dwell in and a heart that he could fill
[1:29:01] in the Book of Psalms
[1:29:03] 24:3 it says who shall Ascend into the
[1:29:06] hill of the Lord or who shall stand in
[1:29:09] his holy place he that had Clean Hands
[1:29:13] and a pure heart who had not lifted up
[1:29:15] his soul unto vanity nor sworn
[1:29:18] deceitfully he shall receive the
[1:29:20] blessing from the Lord and righteousness
[1:29:23] from the god of his
[1:29:24] salvation in Matthew 5:8 it says blessed
[1:29:28] are the pure in heart for they shall see
[1:29:31] God still speaking at the heart there
[1:29:34] are so many instructive lessons they say
[1:29:36] blessed are the pure in heart is your
[1:29:38] heart pure tonight if not you want it to
[1:29:41] be pure tonight he is the surgeon he is

[1:29:52] him but you you have to be willing to
[1:29:55] let go you have to be willing to give

[1:30:05] in your
[1:30:06] heart in the book of Ephesians as we
[1:30:09] close chapter 3 it says that he would
[1:30:13] Grant you according to the riches of his
[1:30:17] glory to be strengthened with might by
[1:30:20] his spirit in the inner man that Christ
[1:30:23] May dwell in your hearts by faith that
