turn it me to one portion of Scripture read it from the book of Revelation 22 and reading from verse 10 thank you musicians thank you brother Anthony revelation 20:2 reading from verse 10 and he saith unto me seal not the sayings of the prophecy of this book for the time is at hand he that is unjust let him be unjust still and he which is filthy let him be filthy still and he that is righteous let him be righteous still and he that is holy let him be holy still and behold I come quickly and my reward is with me to give every man according as his work shall be I am Alpha and Omega the beginning and the end of first and the last blessed are they that do His commandments that they may have right to the Tree of Life and may enter in through the gates into the city for without are dogs and sorcerers and whoremongers and murderers and idolaters and whosoever loveth and maketh a lie I Jesus have sent mine angel to testify unto you these things in the churches I am the root and the offspring of David and the bright and morning star and the spirit and the bride say come and let him that heareth say come and let him that is athirst come and whosoever will let him take the water of life freely for I testify unto every man that here are the words of the prophecy of this book If any man shall add unto these things God shall add unto Him the plagues that are written in this book and if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy God shall take away his part out of the book of life and out of the holy city and from the things which are written in this book he which testified these things say it surely I come quickly amen even so come Lord Jesus he may be seated in the presence of the Lord today greeting once again so for a title this morning and you're gonna have to help me preach this morning I don't know what type of virus they've been cooking up but people have been going with the cool and the flu and different things but the enemy is defeated and we're not gonna let no rock don't share our praise me we're gonna keep the devil on the ropes because whenever your taxes because he's afraid when every the taxes because you know something is about to happen so we are here and the president of the Lord this morning to worship God to give Him praise to give Him glory to recognize that what we are seeing is modern events made clear by prophecy that God is not surprised and we ought not to be surprised because the word has clearly declared what is supposed to be happening this great season of we're living in you men so for a title this morning separating the word bride from the church members separating the word bride from the church members and an inspiration the identification of the true believers and an inspiration only the elect have the ability to hear from God and the church say Amen and have a closing theme if I call it that for 2018 going into 2019 no more excuses can the church say mmm you want to give a hundred percent we want to give our all as we prepare to leave this place amen amen amen no brother man I'm told us in every church there are three kinds of believers we know this they are unbelievers in the church they are make believers in the church and they are true believers in the church this is why you can't judge a church by who's in the church because in the church are three kinds of believers people act all kind of strange ways you don't know who they are they may just be a make believer people act funny to you you don't know they may be an unbeliever they are in church but they are unbelievers in the church they are made believers in the church but through the prophetic ministry of brother Branham he identified that they are also true believers in the church and these true believers have an identification there's something about them that lets you know that they are true there's something about you that lets you know if you're a true believer if you're make believer or if you're an unbeliever can the church say mmm it is for this reason no Church can claim to be a holy church because brother Branham said in every Church has three kinds of believers so that levels are playing fields of churches because in any church they could be a true believer unbeliever and a big believer we can measure the church man who's in it you measure the church by individuals who have the baptism of the Holy Ghost who are pressing for perfection who are pressing for something more than they had yesterday who are willing to separate themselves from the things of the world who are willing to cover the time to get into the message of the hour to realize that this world is finished to realize that America is in its place and Russia isn't its place and China is in its place and the government is in the police and the economy is in its place and the bride of Jesus Christ has to get into her place [Applause] hallelujah and God has always been about separating he is a separator and his separation is about word Brian and other believers of the separation has to come because the rapture is the great separation we can repeat about culture we could talk about scriptures but there's a real rapture just as there's a real judgment there's a real promise to individuals who won the promise up but if you wanna stay here he who is filthy you can be filthy still he who is righteous you can be right yourself you who want to be a real Christian a real Christian still you said behold I come quickly and I'm bringing my reward with me oh you don't have to wait for the reward when you see me come I have my reward with me to give every man according to your worship to give every man according to your prayer life to give every man according to how you read the scripture like if every man how you live this message how you live this message in your home how you live this message in your job how you live this message when the pressure comes Oh [Music] hallelujah somebody say madam you may be seated and I was thinking just the other day that your problems are a test and your blessings are also a test now that's deep because people don't see their blessing as a test they see the problem as a test so they see the pressure as the test but your pressures our test just as your blessings are tested because God is looking for somebody the more he blesses the more humble they become so even if your blessing you are being tested every step you take you are being tested to see if you could be counted worthy of this great glory to see if you become somebody help me this morning [Music] no wonder the Bible says haven't done all to stand stand after you've done everything to stand then stand after your position yourself still stand after your prey it's tandem and against the temptation stand against lust stand against evil stand against disrespect and against gossip stand against the styles and the fashion and again no prayer life and the canceled movies stand there cancel worldly desires stand against being an ordinary Christian we don't want to be a church member you can be a member of any Church I want to be in the word bride because only the world bride makes a rapture Oh whether you fellowship and Isaac I fellowship in Christ Jesus because that's the identification of the word pride to many church members it's easy to be a church member oh you get about Sunday morning and you make sure you all dressed and you get ready at your church your church member nobody holds you accountable but what bride is different what bride means you can stand the test good brides me if you lose your job that doesn't move you what Bryan means if you lose family that doesn't move you will bribe me City chose you in a bed of sickness that doesn't move you oh good bride means if he tells your family against you that doesn't move you because you are measuring your life not by your expectations not by what you want but by water wood sensor that's would ride would bribe me you can stand the test but that will show something at you you can stand the test and say no I'm a word pride the teletransport not girly at you you say no I'm word right the Tevatron he can say that you know I'm a word bride the devil chose for instruction at you know I'm a word bride my room is sealed up I could take no other serum I have already impregnated by the original theater the original life from the original message the original power and I'm under expectation but the same science but the same wonders for the same miracles for the same power for the same anointing for the same glory but the same fire for the same spirit somebody say man Oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah real christians christians who can worship when things I could Christians who've been worship when things are bad Christians who could worship on the way to the bank because we could worship when you hear I have no money in the back that's a real word bride it doesn't matter these natural circumstances but your eyes are fixed to where you're going not where you come from not where you are now but every day I'm going somewhere I'm going somewhere I'm going somewhere come and go with me through my father house if you don't want to go don't hit me but I'm going somewhere Oh hallelujah hallelujah and every Church three kinds of believers what kind of believer are you today the unbeliever is in church but they don't believe the unbeliever is in church but when they hear you shall receive the Holy Ghost they don't think it's for them the unbelievers in church but when they hear the word it doesn't rest well with them that's the unbeliever the unbeliever dig they can worship don't get me wrong naked worship but when it comes to living something they have a trouble put it into action because if you really believe you will go into action well somebody helped me to smaller may your feet rise that's true believers this morning to possess your God given inheritance can the church say Amen to make believer that's a strange one that's the one you almost think it'll make it they got everything right but they are putting on a good show good actors good actors things are wrong but it not letting anybody know anything is wrong me believe in me believing it's all right me believing it's okay but the true believer when you fall like them like a sheep that falls into the mud your cries not afraid to cry not afraid to run to the altar and see a pastor I messed up I want to be restored because I want to be right with God that's the true believer not true just in your external action but true in spirit ah true and how you communicate true in your prayer life you may be seated hallelujah I heard somebody say recently I think I read it how it's interesting when people are praying and you're praying for somebody else you could pray loudly Lord my brother Lord you know he needs the liver and me you break whatever is pulling him and and when it's time to pray for yourself because you don't want nobody to know what's going on in your life I'm not putting believers into any category but I'm just saying there's something about being real blind bartimaeus was really Jesus son of David have mercy on me I'm in trouble I can't go on tomorrow this same way I can't reach tomorrow in this condition I came to church for a reason I didn't come to be seen at a cover shake hand but I came because I need a touch I can't I can't face this season I can't face my job this week it's a reality [Applause] [Music] somebody helped us this morning God has taken a picture who is filthy filthy still if we know when the picture is to be taken then that's fine then we could pose for the picture but the problem is we don't know when the picture is gonna be taken where he who is righteous be righteous still if we can get a glimpse into the mind of God so when it'll happen then we make sure that we be righteous because God please listen the seeds of permanence but that's a season we are into because there's no more time left we really run out of time and the message has always been be ready be ready and then the question is are you ready this is not as a church now as an individual because it's a separation going on this morning between church members and between the word bride the scripture reread says if you add anything your name is seeking out if you take away something he has no part with you it has to be this word in its entirety and nothing less Lord what does the word see about me today what does a lower expect about us today can the church same and so I want to take my time this morning most companies are slowing down for the season and so we don't have too much in the natural to worry about this morning isn't that right so I don't have the energy I normally wear better mic so I'm gonna take my time this morning from the message the queen of sheba but the band said some people look at their symptoms my pastor prayed for me last night but my hands know better that has nothing to do with it if you are really a believer then you don't even look at that it's already settled forever God healed you bastards what if Abraham would have looked that next month to see if Sarah was going to have the baby he'll never notice it he just noticed what God said and any true believer looks to the promise not what symptoms are around them they look what God said and in praying but I ran and said I mean know Lord that that church is not in the majority this morning the true believers are in the minority but someday Lord you will take that minority to yourself can the church say Amen and the message might kind of profit by the balance that all true profits are all true Christians all true believers stay with that would no matter what anybody says you stay with the word no matter what your wife says your mother your sister your brother your name up they see the deeds of miracles as past don't you believe it for the Bible said he's the same yesterday today and forever you tell you have to dress a certain way they're fitted on your job you don't believe it because the wood tells you differently in this Christmas season they tell you you have to attend up the events in work or whatever it is you don't believe it because there's a word promised over you and it's a word covenant over you proving his worth notice it was by his believers that he proves his would he can only prove his worth not by unbelievers it's only by believers that he can prove his would no matter how much of the rest of them claim to be oh I believe brother see if you do God will prove it it's by true believers that he proves his would not those who say didn't believe but those who really believe it's by his believing children that he proved his would oh my my my mind listen to the Prophet know he had believers do all crop my died off the unbelievers who said we couldn't take it he let every one of them perish why every one of them but the believers who was left Moses have been taken to glory and the unbelievers have perished in the wilderness and this was their children they were only two that crossed over and that was the believers Joshua and Caleb and that's how what type he was the believers they was the ones who cross over it's the only way court can do it is by his believing children you believe that now those tune of Israel left Egypt from this morning on Church is about two million strong they all journey together they all sort of see miracles of God all partook of the same manner and water from the smitten Rock all full of the seen cloud by day and the pillar of fire by night but only to reach the promised land only two were true or real believers that is correct because the word tells us that the rest died because of unbelief and because of unbelief they could not enter in then since that is so and only to enter then the rest were not true believers what made the difference to stayed with the wood when the heart of the ten spies fear that Kira's Barnea Joshua and Caleb did not stagger for they believed the word and said we are more than able to take the land they knew they could because God had said I have given you the land after all those Israelites saw of the power and goodness and deliverance of God he did not enter rest which is a type of the Holy Ghost so they all left Egypt they all celebrated even Egypt he saw miracles they saw water from the rock he saw healings and they did not enter the Holy Ghost land because only their true believers enter the holy ghost land he knew about the land they had heard a pouter land he heard stories of the land but when they keep the kiddies Vanille to enter into the rest the rest of the spirit oh come on now only can a man just swap despite the opposition despite the opposition said we are more than able this is what we came to church for to get the Holy Ghost what giants are you talking about what time is he talking about what sickness you're talking about what problem in my family you're talking about what mistake what failure this movie goes promise land is my land I'm going to possess it I'm gonna cream it so you can see right now listen to the Prophet carefully now and this is the junction we have so you can see right now that very few will ever believe all the way to receiving the Spirit of God and that's the great showdown to receive the Spirit of God that's what we are here striving so claw can enter a new heart a new spirit he is spirit now when they left Egypt for the currents they believed they were going somewhere but your belief is tested by the opposition your belief the depth of your belief is if you give up or if you hold on the depth of your belief is if you backslide or if you pick up yourself and say I'm going to keep on pressing it's not about a mistakes if you get back up but just won't hear them they said we are more than able we are more than able we have come too far to turn back now we have been to too many services to go back with nothing too many years 2019 is around the corner this time is the time for the inheritance to be divided up have children that's coming lovelyz has coming don't tell me about these giants we can take them we can handle them but the planner said Caleb took a box and stir up on Uproxx he was no great big slowly up but his belief was big his faith was strong he believed and he could do it and this morning I believe we can have a revival this morning I could believe that you can be delivered I believe your sickness your tout your fear we could kill at the T not even tomorrow to team now it is don't you know who you are don't you know what you are wanted to Oh [Applause] I'm warming up this morning oh we are getting ready to leave here one of these tears they're gonna be the last service we don't even know if this is the last service we don't even know because he said I come quickly and my reward will be with me Oh it'll be a straw quick message and I'll shake the whole nation all these years Robbie held on believing and then all of a sudden there'd be a son of the rushing mighty wind and all the years you have held on God will bring a reward he will bring a blessing he will bring a change in your soul it will be not by might nor by power but by my spirit saith the Lord overnight the Spirit of God will ship around the world overnight he goes into your home overnight he goes to your family of an ATAR oh he's a god of the impossible he's a God of miracles he's a God of power he's a God of healing he's a clone of deliverance he's a God of breakthrough he's a way make up this morning if you can't believe I'm speaking of true believers this morning to make believers you can do what you want the unbelievers you can do what you want but the true believers hold on to the promise of God chloral has not forgotten you God will not abandon you he promised you [Applause] he may be seated [Applause] [Music] God has horizontal but individuals think about it Moses did not know when he was there the burning bush and God was saying I've heard the cries of my people they all cried but God already saw that out of doors that way needed only just one Caleb would make it over brother kindly the same way core teams laws just put Mary and Bethlehem God move the whole state around move the whole city around had the legislative arm change taxes have to create provisions people were moving donkeys were being used the more people from here to here reporter your place of station census was being taken and all of that was for one person to be in position or you know hear me this morning God will move the government even move the taxation he will change the banking laws he will do whatever he takes and it comes it will Mary carrying a baby Mary is tired but she said Joseph we got to go we got to go we got to go oh come on now some money Oh hallelujah hero did not know that when Moses was standing before him speaking about all those people that Moses was speaking for Joshua Caleb and the children of those that were in Egypt come on now I remember the promise here in the earth he was speaking about a bride he and cause he was speaking about a word bride and the people who sat there listening to him they didn't even know that they were just there to hold the seats because we couldn't be there they were hauling the seats because we were not born yet but this promised land yes Holy Ghost and his land of promise this land of miracles his land of eternity is our land [Applause] [Applause] [Music] you may be seated this is a message for young people not just young and age but young and hot Oh hallelujah it's not up a hole in a mess if people all in a mess and they all and really all in spirit it it's real tired but this is a missile refreshing a time of efficient because the old eagle flashes his head against the wall that take the scales off to get a new vision a new perspective take another look at the same scriptures but all of a sudden you see a name where you never saw before you say wait a minute I've been reading this before but today the Spirit of the Lord is upon me for he has anointed me this day in my life I don't know about anybody else but this day in my life this scripture is fulfilled I see my name I see perfection and that's me I see adoption and that's me we are preaching from the Holy Ghost and this morning you may be seated but the problem is too much of us we are alone and natural the kind of things to get our attention and you know what life on the media technology there will never be a shortage of information you know the backside knowledge will increase I was in a meeting this week and somebody said and somebody's having a conversation and somebody said him you know so much about American politics and this is and because knowledge is increased you can find out everything you want about anything who's the Senate appointee who is the representative of this who what happened with with with brexit and what happened in the Europe and when I've been in China and when I went to Zimbabwe and the currency and what happened in South America and the devaluation the Argentinian pesos and you can spend your time in there knowledge increase you know how this happening and and green energy and and the oil and renewable energy and the come and UDA in that you hold a heart your whole life your car waiting here breaking news next he be breaking you 7 p.m. in Kuwait was he latest who phone number can release now latest news what's happening and you caught up and in the meantime in the spiritual realm there's the latest news news that are breaking but you can't look at it with the natural eye you can't look at it from a kind of perspective you can't just turn on the news and see what's happening in the supernatural realm for you to see this news you have to be this world if you're nothing is ready till next year to see nothing but if it is risen eternally news is you wait a minute there's something happening this is moving to cause this to happen and his healing is taking place and quad is still calling from the east from the west from the north from the south [Applause] [Music] [Applause] you rarely see them and frankly realize quarters doing the calling you cannot come to this mess unless God calls you you got me invited to this room nobody can invite you to this you know this is like this white man's invitation you can invite everybody unless the seat in there so they can never see this thing you can invite a pope you can invite the president you can apply the Prime Minister if there's no seed in their soul they can sit there for every service they can come to us every single team if there's no scene in their soul they get nothing but you are here to spawning is what I've seen in your soul now when the word goes forth something connects gonna see Germany of soul you maybe see them what is it I said into it is it's like a wife I was like yeah there's a cell phone you know when you go so many any mountain you lose reception anybody ever explain any of you drive somewhere American like Whitman I'm totally technologically advanced I realize I have no reception no signal so when you're bored in this world you're born with no signal but some of your porn with still put it with a food in your heart but when you're born you have no signal and you're living your life with no signal so you just drive around aimlessly nobody know what you are you never get a phone call you never get a text you know yo what's up your phone dead but then something a word is spoken as when a Kangol e said last week he was a young man walking his up what a spin looking he was searching his hat for something you read this you eat a piece of but he's a young man talking and all of a suddenly he receptor his short come alive man I'll never feel that before this thing this thing he didn't put it in him it was there all along he didn't know he had it but it was there all along so when people come into this glorious tabernacle if they have a receptor they're gonna respond if there's no receptor you don't know how to respond but thank god there's a receptor in your soul and when the word of god is spoken you can say yes yes yes yes Amen that's me that's my name I'm born to overcome I'm going to be a conqueror I'm born to receive the Holy Ghost I'm going to have joy destroyer have the world didn't give it to me this piece I have the world didn't give it to me and the world cannot take it away because that receptor that Jim not fall in my heart I didn't even put it here I can't even take it over on one two [Applause] can the message the spoke away the original seed now let us stand like Joshua and Caleb as we see the Promised Land coming in sight you have to see the Promised Land coming in sight not Santa Claus come with the town nor the promised land coming in sight not the razor PA coming inside didn't get that tongue Lord but you have to see the promised land coming in sight because if you see the Promised Land coming in sight you make preparations for the Promised Land coming inside its nearing the time to be given just when Hebrew means Savior and it represents the promise and time to take the church over caleb represents a true believer who stayed with Joshua God started Israel as a virgin with his word but they wanted something different so did the last day Church conan's in sportage original seed everybody doing fine this morning nobody too tired from painting and stuff right oh it is Christmas season people does get any spirit in them he's a spirit consistent spirit I always tell a story about a journey god bless his soul when he said I'm not paying them for Christmas I'm not no not this year well they're not getting me this year his testimony was strong until December 2014 never forget it late Christmas Eve and every somebody pencil maithili append all Christmas morning breathless batches he gonna sleep Christmas Diego he peed all night long because the spiritism and when the spirit of revival gets you they spread or whatever gets you [Applause] I'm and many times and it happens unconsciously you don't know it says some of you tired I think was Tennessee even had something good and I was tired and then when Irish we're going some retired years go it's not he had no longer I don't know but his printable thing get on you it has people get tired I want me every time I see good food suddenly no feel they don't know any time is gone and I just feel inspired say I know it happens we say you're hungry no I'm not I'm not hungry ok cool and then I really say well who who's Adam but what you say you're not hungry the spirit anything I'm gonna pranam said winning a ballgame this is brother branham did you see example when y'all Boyle came you have to get any spirit of it it's a horrible thing to be in a ballgame and then you there you are the only put in there and you and everybody as they look like nothing else going on and it's so important we come into the house of God we come to the house of God to get in the spirit of trying a saggy negativity when you're working natural news is murder as this is negativity who get kidnapped who do this somebody want to really news could have nothing to hide nothing to edify us didn't make you know but when it come here it's only good news honey that's the money only healing honey deliverance and they being reminded of where you come from reminded of what you're going tell the church amen hmm from a message proving his word now I want you to notice he does it that way in every age he does it every time by the same method he has to take believers so God is looking for true believers this morning what we call word right not church members and then in order to have believers to meet that word he's got to predestinated in that age that's what makes the destination so powerful because predestination means that God did the choosing he said you have not chosen me but I have chosen you my sheep know my voice and a stranger they would not follow so there's something in you that's pulling you even when people talk to you there's something saying no that's not right because you're not hearing his voice because my sheep know my voice so true is worrying when somebody could preach and they can say nice things but I'm not hearing his voice because his word is an expression of his voice scripture is an expression of his voice the scripture is the written form of his voice everybody with me this morning so what made the prophetic ministry the prophetic ministry is that brother Branham wasn't speaking his thoughts he was expressing his voice [Applause] [Music] in the days of the 7c when he shall begin too soon but he's someone I can study his words his solving is his because with a Bradham said and brought to to the scripture for via Amos 3:7 the prophets and a mouthpiece of God so God doesn't need to stand physically here to speak he uses prophets and then this is we have a mighty major prophet time your right hand of God when he spoke his words were the voice of God to us and that voice caught us from the Baptist Church from the Methodist Church from the Pentecostal Church even within the message that voice became so clear to us it made crystal clear Oh identification our identification in Christ not as message believers but as bride of Jesus Christ this great love letter that quote sent to catch your attention to let you know that you are not a natural being that you are supernatural and that despite the revelation you have a supernatural element still remains that you will be changed you will be transformed that you are part of him that when they see you they will see him when they see him they'll see you because you are the father ah become one wife of the Lamb flesh of my flesh bone of my bone spirit of my spirit light of my life you have no thoughts of your own you have no ambitions of your own you have no agenda of your own your agenda is his agenda your thoughts are his thoughts your desires are his desires and the least of his desires is your commander because you love him you are the servant and you are one with him what unity between Christ and His Church and that will be our striving for that's what we are contending for or to shake off there's all were these six developments and put it behind us oh we're gonna have a run time with another grand time up in heaven I can't wait to testify to David how do you mean it over holding this age of Internet and Facebook and whatsapp all kinds of manner of evil we could stand the test and every time we found out we got back up and say lord lord give me strength to fight another team somebody say man somebody say man do you love him will you serve Him hallelujah he's got to protest any this thing to be here to meet the challenge of the age and no age has had a challenge like this age this age has systematically broken down the resistance of people to accept what was perverse as normal to lower your tolerance so they tell you if you speak out against certain things now you're it's against freedom of speech and you're not being tolerant and you're do you're discriminated well if I'm discriminating in college discriminated because going to look that subtle and the morons am gonna judge it I didn't say the Bible says it you can't tell me you really seem liable and I'm reading scripture speaking scripture and because of scripture period is discriminatory and you wonder claim to really see Bible and that's the thing of it is is easier taking you whole gospel or a take Nana because if you want a book of rules to live like a good person have plenty have nice books of ethics and a nice way of living and do good unto others and you have those are nice rules to live by but this Bible is the minor chord the torts of God in completion and God sent a prophet to tie up the loose ends in this age to identify the spirit of the Antichrist and we'll try to slip into this church that the true church the word gradual will stand them discerning withstand the Antichrist word the truth was working within the framework of the church thank God for a prophet because what audience profit will be lost can the church say Amen but because it is prophetic ministry we can speak with confidence and we know we're gonna make it and because God is looking through the blood your mistakes and your failures my mistakes and my feelings they are covered under the blood until such time as fire drops down and transforms the scene into a full manifestation we are gonna be perfect we are going to be adopted can determine one of these days these voices will live with a black run and when they live it will not be my voice but will be seven little voices not a little thunder that shakes the temple and this people under fear messenger this word pride under their messenger between the final voice that are finally oh whatever it be Allah Peter Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost and power you may be seated we read the quote but Abraham said few will make it to that spot to receive the Spirit of God whew 2 million left Egypt and other the 2 million and left is only 2 meters and swapped to receive the Spirit of God the type of the promised land the rest at the entity I'm gonna bring him in water Holy Ghost is given for he said a hole that goes give you power to speak he said the way in the upper room they could even see him no they were hiding they didn't even have confidence to speak with a Stephen but when the Holy Ghost came upon them they had the power to speak but the parent said when the Holy Ghost given port it gives you power to have a prayer life or coming on somebody somebody say man the Holy Ghost gives you power still have a Holy Light but Isaac I'm struggling come on let's pray for the Holy Ghost let's make room for the Holy Ghost because that's what the church needs it's a Holy Ghost you may be seated wherever I'm sent a little sister she's praying she can't get no prayer answered he said when the Holy Ghost comes upon her watch how she operates it's a different walk it's a different talk it's a different life so for you who are struggling my encouragement you get to Holy Ghost get Zoe that new life in your soul it will come as a baby you may be seated but the brown said it's a it's a bus so you gotta grow up so that spirit pulls in your soul sell us some with you you should have to be tested that's why I said after you get the Holy Ghost now you make yourself a Christian so without the Holy Ghost you are aspiring to be a Christian but when you gather Holy Ghost now you can make yourself a question oh come on now are we in the world is rolling so stop looking at your failures and look at the promise of God for your life and realize that listen even with auto holy ghost you may be seated the wood will defeat the devil any time any place under any condition and Jesus proved that with gesture would he send the devil straight back to whatever emergency room they have in hell he said the devil's shrimp back there straight back but that Branham said it was electric fools with a job that hit him when he said it is written it is written to also return Jesus could have used spirits He is God but he used a water source that why are you waiting for the Holy Ghost you have all the wood and the world itself is power the word itself is power [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] kanna-chan same and everybody feeling fine the Bible said resist the devil and he will not not walking Paul enough when well as you flee flee is not running few people use that word flee flee and fled that world family of words is feeling this is not walk away in them it's not even running them you can run we see flee so when you resist the devil and better Branum made it so simple and that's why I said this gospel is not rocket science there people who would like it to be rocket science my son rocket science but if I say when he'd ever tell you boo you tell him boo back we'll never come and you'll see of course this is wrong and no you speak back to him when say that yesterday's shut up devil I repented under the blood he get away that work not my house not my car not my phone not my family not my desk not my tea not when I walk into work I don't know what other maxes but not as maxi not today and as you begin to resist the devil he has to flee because that's what the Bible says it's not like these are options that are option for him he has to flee resist the devil and he will flee so when the pressure comes resisted the person let the weak say I am strong your tests emotional before a week your aversion yeah when I tell you whether they are weak ee e ki the Bible gives no instructions to describe you weakness they let the weak say I am strong and by counting the things as noticed or they were you are actually using the currency of feet they exchange your weakness will shrink somebody help me and by the brown spoke about you know he said the currency of this kingdom is sweet and you can exchange food for anything liquid safe it I'm strong I have joy a happy but you just lost your family I have joy peace and when you begin to speak like that it doubles it will have to take leave so right now what you begin a talk I have joy happy so have picture II and begin and you'll see an anointing come over you right now I have victory I'm overcome up I'm gonna make it my family's gonna be delivered my channel restored this sickness has got to go I'm gonna get a woolly cuz my joy is coming back my peace is coming back my faith is coming back my victory is coming back I've never get weary yet come on talk to yourself that's what David and he encouraged himself in the Lord Tokio Serena [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] hallelujah but the bottom goes on in a message proving his word did you get it did it get you did you feel it did you see it do you understand it that's what's happening today he predestinated into this by his foreknowledge when he pretends he at Malachi 4 is gonna happen when he come around protesting is anything to happen in his would he had to prove his word to be sue when he protested is anything that happened in session will happen he knows that seed will be there just at that time he predestinated a bride she's gonna be there going to be a rapture she is going to be there he predestinated by his foreknowledge see there's nothing gonna stop it does not make you wanna shout there's nothing gonna stop the bride for making the rapture your boss can't stop it your problems can't stop it your mystique and stopping in corporate destinated you have to prove his worth to be so so God sent a prophet to make sure you make the rapture God sent you in your family to make sure you're in the rapture God move all the pieces just like you did for Mary to Bethlehem to make sure that you make the rapture [Applause] hallelujah everybody feeling fine that's just a background background for but still in the background friends this must mean more to you than life itself and this is the most important thing you have this week this year right now is there's nothing else as important as this this is the plan of redemption this is your family's deliverance this is your change of body this is your healing this is your transformation this is your translation what else is more important [Applause] what else is more important have another good pass to me but this this will never pass away this is more important so forget our Queens in Ethiopia don't worry you have a better house on the other side that will never need painted oh come on somebody somebody get back to me but I think I'm not sure if I what size ham again is here don't worry about that you were in support trust me you came and eat how much ham in having me come on up somebody please back to me but I thought it wouldn't have happened [Applause] then check and see your work everyone I'm hammer not sure but this is the most important thing when you see Sunday comment by the 10:1 neeraj you prepared wasn't me they told everyone here Saturday be moving money recheck I wait for Sunday because the most important day of your week this is where you get to commune with fellow citizens of the great kingdom of God fellow citizens who despite their fearless in spite of mistakes have committed because I was chosen the ROA separate yourself from this separate yourself and some of you still in the prospects are separated you still have your struggles but your heart is fixed I am on my way to Tina's land I want me coming a Sunday we come not to look down on anybody we come because we are all contending earnestly contending for the heat if there's something of me that needs to improve you separate Isaac you need to operate better than that and I need to be Christian enough to see thank you I didn't realize how I acted or family to you come on with a moment your Christian behavior but tell me they're coming for three weeks you may be seated it's maturity spiritual maturity and it so happened that when I alter my Tariq's because brother sua tell me so on so nice when he snapshot take him he was righteous righteous clicks 3015 still clicks and I will be chillin because I want to yeah brother shouldn't talk to me now you see why your behavior needs to be consistent your car put all these Sunday behavior and then when you cut away to reach Thompson either to take off the behavior because you know Monday Garrity freebo's I never bought only ten I did this week last week sorry but this week he go get because this week is leading up to Christmas I mean I've been holding it for this whole year a behaviour you know but this week you're not taking it having an order stands and until that meet you like Nietzsche said that you know but I burn up said you spread up John Dillinger than you you will act like done Dillinger the reporter some of us some of us head there yet so when it died out up dead man Cassie hey how you talk to my soul when you die to yourself on crisis living when people say things to you it don't bother you because you all you did you're all mates you're dead people tell you your dis you don't matter I this bonds or for you because your nature your feelings your emotions have already died out I want that died out it nothing moves you you qu can worship people you can be the only one who see everybody looking at you funny but you worship in because eternity church against you can the church say man but you are prepared for an adoption ceremony when you call you a side and see tears my tears flowing freely it's an individual I fear we can tell God how to do it he is suffering he is do what he wants to do to bring his church into perfection to bring his sons and daughter into adoption he is suffering he needs nobody's permission to Philly with the Holy Ghost it is nobody's permission to bless you he is able to do what he wants to do summary same [Applause] [Music] hallelujah separating the wood right from the church members over the years we've seen a lot of people come in and on the message after years many times you don't see them anymore because they could not take the wood people make all kind of excuses and that's why I'm a hard-ass no more excuses because it's idiot Ziggler would the only alternative to teak in the wood is to make a choose to not eat it people find some reason why well the reason why I are doing this is because of X the Bible say forsake not the assembling of herself together and I was come to church any reason the reason I come is because I was excused pray without ceasing that's in the wood many teeth on the word day and night what is your excuse as if they are pro team you ought to be more sincere more conjugated what is your excuse but a Branham did not studying and career as he said listen plan as if he coming in twenty years that's all right but live as if he coming tomorrow [Applause] don't let me and caught up in the in the way of life how do you plans that if I get that you're supposed to be ready if the Lord comes tomorrow [Applause] [Music] [Applause] what if he comes today are you ready separating the word bride from the church members the Prophet make some points here this one that kind of touches the rejected King but around said but listen you true believers in Christ you true Christians that believe in going a little financial all the time Saul was training this big army and all these intellectuals coming up God had a little demon out there somewhere feeding his father's sheep on sheep food I'm a better call she food a would not theological weeks right and he happened to be standing by when that happened talking about when Goliath through stream enough and they wanted to give him a seminary experience you see in soil and I wanted to give David a seminary experience so I said come here maybe my armor would fit you maybe this interpretation would fit you maybe you can say it this way it'll work and he said take the thing off of me well I'll make you a bachelor at and give you a doctor's degree and he said I don't know nothing about it take the thing off of me let me tell you something I've got this slingshot well that's no compare mint but looky here one day Allah was out there feeding one of my father's sheep was out there feeding and a lion come and got it and I and then packed off and I took this slingshot and I trusted in a God of Israel and I went after him and I knocked him down and slew him and brought that lamp back a beer come in and got a kid and started off with him one of my father's and I put the rock in a slingshot there's a little bitty thing but I went after him I wasn't trusting in his slingshot but I was trusting in the power of the God of Israel I'm better Brett but if I was bringing on the table its true believer and we know to scoop that Noah was a true believer Abraham was a true believer job was a true believer even when his wife said to him why do you curse God and die he was such a true believe I still believe in her he's in speed like a foolish woman and even though he got down when court challenged him where was though answer me like a man joke couldn't have no excuse girls remind me in job away come from Gannon was a true belief but Elijah was a true believer Mike I was a true believer hallelujah no my from a message and my seed shall possess the gate of his enemy and that's the reason we find our organization's falling by the wayside it's because when it comes to the test what tests God's will base the test God's Word is the test where we do what a bunch of men says do or will we do what God says do that's the difference dare he come the days of Dwight Moody the days of Finney Sankey Knox Calvin splitter all the rest of them those spiritual men they only see some followed after them they cut up a bunch of men back there that's cut their wheeze into it each one believing this and I'm adding a little here and taking a little away there and adding a little here until they finally they made our organization out of it and when they do the real true believer goal comes right around and picks up some humble little person breaks that thing to pieces right God all asunder goal doesn't change just tear that thing to pieces some spiritually minded people who will steal but to wind can the choose a man for the Bible in a message events made clear by prophecy for the Bible is a living foretold witness of Jesus Christ and as the earth has grown into its fullness and also finds grow into the fullness the day's grow at his fullness the bible has manifested him his fullness in the prison of Jesus Christ he was the word of God revealed the whole complete book of redemption the Bible is God's Word foretelling the future events its believers is commanded by its author to read and believe every word of it not just part of it one would disbelieve it you might as well quit trying until you believe that would every word is absolutely a part of Almighty God God made manifest wound into his will to show forth who he is we are commanded as believers to believe every word of it and it's ruled by the author of God himself there's nobody can add anything to it or take meeting from it if you would ever be a freak body of God it would have me be six fingers on one hand or three arms or something to add something to take something away from it and be a one short I'm one finger short it's the complete body of Jesus Christ and in Christ being a male the groom the bride is represented in him also and these two our one day you'll know that I'm and the father the father me I in you and you and me what a complete picture and the true believers in this in this world who accepted the way believe it but that we believe it and we patient wait for it's prophesied promise since every one of them to be manifested in its each hallelujah blessed be the name of God it doesn't matter if you call yourself a Christian anyone can do that the point is whether or not you have the Spirit of God in you forward out the spirit you are reprobate that is a rascal no-good troublemaker good-for-nothing you are none of it I'll read it one more time it doesn't matter if you call yourself a Christian anyone can do that and you meet them all the time I'm a Christian I'm a Christian I'm a Christian and not be trying to judge but you know that life is nowhere near Scripture it doesn't matter you call yourself a Christian and when people tell you that I'm a born-again and they jumping up in the next county welfare which paths born way again it doesn't matter if you call yourself a Christian anyone can do that the point is whether or not you have the Spirit of God in you because if the Spirit of God is in you it was like God it will act like Christ it'll make you two things I got richer it's a man not too long ago can you take someone not too long ago I asked the lady if she were Christian she said to me I'm you may have heard it before I will have you know sir that I burn a candle every night what in the world has I've got to do with it that's a profit accent I'm a Methodist I'm a budget I'm a pentacle so that has not got nothing to do with it it is the holy gospel parish it is the Holy Ghost or parish so when the question is if you are Christian the real question has been asked is do you have no only goes that's the real question hmm hallelujah the original Word will produce the original life hallelujah hallelujah glory glory glory glory hallelujah give Him praise giving worship so that's right for message Christianity versus idolatry that's right you've got to know the word stay under words see the great battle is at hand now with bleach for years and years but it always come now that when Janice and John John breeze and Janice will withstand Moses as a balance at the wood and it's going to be a spiritual battle conflict there'll be some just continued all the denominators will just move right on into domination and go all the way it goes but I mean that real true believer is coming to that battlefield and you'd better be versed and know what you're doing or you can take an evil spirit so easy and not know if it's contrary so this would don't believe it stay with that word but thanks be to God we got hidden food spiritual food that we're living under goodness and mercy of the revelation of Jesus Christ in these last days vindicating self among his people amen they went and Elijah went in before the drought setting thank God for being in before the judgement sets in now is a time of coming out and going in getting out of this organization and getting into Christ coming and going in time for all true believers now notice recognize the caller godswood which is a part of and it's an eagle town eagle now if that mother would have screamed like a buzzard he'd have never known it he pinched axes well off in the barnyard when it was a scream of an eagle there was something inside a little fellow that he knowed he was an eagle and the same thing is with every true believer when the preaching of God's wood comes forth and is vindicated and proven it's God's work with this hour then there's something within the believer I don't care how loyal his father was to a church how loyal is mother was or his grandparents and if the church is teaching contrary to this hour of the baptism of the Holy Ghost message there's something in him that screams out he leave the pond yard he's got to do it the chicken might have been all right one day but this is Eagle Owl it's a different there's something he must leave the whole crew and fly away into the blue then this does leave body is quickened and brought by the quickening spirit to the obedience of glass wood or somebody give God a shout of praise [Music] [Applause] now when this Holy Spirit who represented as the eagle flying over the land and finds a believer no man can come to me no man could come to me as he wants to but all that the father has given me will come to me but no man can come by himself it isn't your own thinking your own drawing is God's drawing all the planner has given me will come to me somebody say man and that great mother Eagle Holy Ghost is overing over its lips attained calling out individuals now that the Prophet that he's not the Holy Spirit sphere on the earth looking out those individuals that Court has ordained to light in this age and as soon as it finds it it does
