[28:28] amen reading from
[28:31] said mark
[28:34] 16 verse nine now when jesus was written
[28:37] early the first day of the week he
[28:39] appeared first to mary magdalene out of
[28:41] whom he had cast
[28:42] seven devils
[28:44] and she went and told them
[28:46] that had been with him as they mourned
[28:50] unwept
[28:51] and they when they had heard that he was
[28:54] alive and had been seen of her believe
[28:56] not
[28:57] after that he appeared in another form
[29:00] on the two of them as they walked and
[29:01] went into the country and they went and
[29:03] told it unto the residue neither
[29:05] believed them afterward he appeared on
[29:08] 11 as they started meat and i breeded
[29:10] them with their unbelief and the
[29:12] hardness of heart because they believed
[29:14] not them which had seen him after he was
[29:16] risen he said unto them go into all the
[29:19] world and preach the gospel to every
[29:21] creature he doesn't believe it and his
[29:23] baptized shall be saved he does believe
[29:25] it not shall be damned and these signs
[29:28] shall follow them that believe in my
[29:29] name they shall cast out devils they
[29:32] shall speak with new tongues they shall
[29:34] take up seconds and if they drink any
[29:35] deadly thing it shall not hurt them they
[29:38] shall lay hands on the sick and they
[29:39] shall recover
[29:40] so then after the lord had spoken unto
[29:42] them he was received up unto heaven and
[29:44] the heaven and sat on the right hand of
[29:46] god and they went forth and preached
[29:48] everywhere the lord working with them
[29:51] and confirming the word which signs
[29:54] following
[29:55] it's in john 14 verse 12
[29:58] verily verily unto you he that believeth
[30:01] on me the works that i do shall do also
[30:04] and greater works than these shall be do

[40:21] he had to cut off adam from that tree
[40:23] unless he stand in that condition in an
[40:26] eternal state as such he cut him off
[40:28] from it but in this hour here that same
[40:31] god that cut adam from that tree is

[40:36] and press him to get you back to that
[40:39] tree
[40:40] oh glory to god do you believe that

[40:51] come to worship so that shows that god's
[40:53] altar was moved and settled at the
[40:56] garden of eden and the only way
[41:00] back to eden
[41:01] is by the altar here you are again
[41:04] back to eden through the altar and they
[41:07] were to keep that way and guided that

[41:16] but the blood
[41:17] god could only you his word god can't
[41:20] use your tears and you're feeling sorry
[41:22] for yourself he can only use the
[41:24] currency of fate and his word not your
[41:27] not your righteousness not your holiness
[41:30] not your purity that is filthiness sight
[41:33] but when that altar is called blood not
[41:35] your blood is the blood of the lamb his
[41:38] own blood who glory that god's spirit
[41:40] can bleed so the word has to become
[41:42] flesh spirit cannot bleed so the spirit
[41:45] all glory to god becomes word and the
[41:48] word become flesh and the flesh was
[41:50] crucified on calvary and when his blood
[41:52] was shed it paid the price it was a
[41:55] blood price to redeem us it was a bad
[41:58] price to restore us it was a blood price
[42:00] to reconnect us and now this morning we
[42:04] are reconnected because we going back to
[42:06] eden by the altar through the altar all
[42:09] glory to god not by teachings but the
[42:11] teachings that pointed you to the old

[52:56] too much let me head over here
[53:00] hallelujah
[53:02] my god
[53:04] this one thing i hate
[53:06] which is the deeds of the nicolaitan i
[53:08] also hate that
[53:09] the true vine hated the formal deeds of
[53:11] the nicolaitans and so did god
[53:13] what was the deeds of the ephesians
[53:14] church and the church of ephesians
[53:16] became a doctrine in the pokemon church
[53:18] in ephesus the first church it was a
[53:19] deed next to become a doctrine what was
[53:21] it then he broke it down
[53:23] nicoletan come from the word nikko which
[53:25] means to conquer or overthrow
[53:27] lady
[53:28] now watch
[53:29] now i read this many times
[53:31] but this time
[53:32] i drive with a shloka
[53:35] so i was always examining every word and
[53:37] when you slow down you see a little more
[53:39] than when you zoop
[53:40] and then anytime many times reading
[53:41] bible we need soup and we're just going
[53:43] through i'm just hitting it so but when
[53:45] you slow down you recognize it have more
[53:47] to it than meets the eye
[53:49] so when i'm driving slow they want to
[53:50] pick up here now
[53:52] god had pastors
[53:55] okay nickelodeon over to congratulations
[53:57] which they were trying to do they was
[53:59] trying to take the church where god had
[54:00] pastors
[54:02] and the spirit of god
[54:04] moving so not moving
[54:07] moving by gifts in the church
[54:11] of the living god and they were having a
[54:14] doctrine
[54:15] that start that they were going to have
[54:17] some priests and bishops and popes and
[54:20] god said he hated it
[54:23] nicholas means to overthrow the laity to
[54:26] conquer the laity in other words
[54:28] take all the sacredness
[54:30] all the power from the church and put it
[54:33] on the priest
[54:37] if that happened now i don't know what
[54:39] happened
[54:41] because right now that would have a holy
[54:42] order
[54:46] let the congregation live any way they
[54:47] want to but the priest is the holy one
[54:51] taking
[54:52] this is taking the holy ghost away from
[54:55] the people
[54:56] with signs
[54:58] wonders following them
[55:01] take that away and give them a holy
[55:03] priesthood and i will add a holy
[55:06] priesthood bringing mysteries
[55:09] nothing wrong with preaching mysteries
[55:10] you know
[55:11] but these signs
[55:14] shall
[55:15] follow
[55:16] not preachers
[55:18] not bishops them
[55:20] that's you
[55:22] them
[55:23] that believe
[55:24] you don't have to ask permission to be a
[55:26] believer
[55:28] not even you are the believer
[55:30] the believer is the word in you will
[55:32] give the lord a shout out
[55:37] so they were taking away the holy ghost
[55:40] and swapping it for a priesthood
[55:43] hallelujah
[55:44] who is
[55:46] who in the world is the head of god's
[55:48] church but him himself
[55:50] he said who is happy religious the holy
[55:53] ghost was sent to rule the church
[55:55] not just the preacher the whole
[55:57] congregation just the preacher be holy
[56:00] no it's all the church has to have the
[56:02] holy ghost
[56:03] oh give the lord some praises
[56:06] glory
[56:07] hallelujah
[56:09] so paul's wolves he said after my
[56:11] departing worlds will come in
[56:13] paul walls he said has become the
[56:15] nicolaitan they were trying to form a
[56:17] priesthood like a levitical priesthood
[56:19] which was foreign to the new testament
[56:20] doctrine
[56:22] remember the new testament doctrine the
[56:24] new testament they went to the jew to
[56:26] the gentiles
[56:27] the gentiles have not do with the
[56:28] physical priesthood that's a jewish
[56:30] thing they're trying to bring back this
[56:32] special man after holy temple that why
[56:35] when the veil when jesus died the veil
[56:37] remember we talked to the people because
[56:39] there's one man going inside the deer
[56:41] and coming out he's a special man all
[56:42] the congregation happy glory hallelujah
[56:44] we forgive him for a year but when jesus
[56:46] busts our view from the top to the
[56:47] bottom he's showing that you as a priest
[56:49] you yourself could go inside yourself
[56:52] and be a partaker of this glory you're

[1:00:00] the sacrifice must be offered with holy
[1:00:03] hands
[1:00:04] the high priest before he could even
[1:00:05] come to offer the sacrifice he had to be
[1:00:08] holy and dedicated and anointed and
[1:00:10] perfumed and everything else before he
[1:00:12] could even walk in the presence of that
[1:00:13] sacrifice

[1:00:54] what about
[1:00:55] the key given to me of the lord
[1:00:58] whereby i was able to determine the
[1:01:00] messenger for each age is a more
[1:01:01] scriptural one
[1:01:03] in fact it might be called the keystone
[1:01:05] of the bible
[1:01:07] it is the revelation that god never
[1:01:08] changes and that his ways are
[1:01:11] unchangeable as he is
[1:01:14] in hebrews 13 8 and that's where we get
[1:01:16] it from
[1:01:17] it says jesus christ the same yesterday
[1:01:20] today and forever
[1:01:22] oh hallelujah
[1:01:23] here it is an unchanging god with
[1:01:25] unchanging ways what he did at the first
[1:01:27] he will have to keep on doing until it's
[1:01:29] done for the last he done it before he
[1:01:31] has to do it again he have to do it
[1:01:34] must
[1:01:36] must oh god must
[1:01:40] you're going to be healed
[1:01:42] oh glory to god you're going to be
[1:01:43] delivered
[1:01:44] he did it before he couldn't do it again
[1:01:47] fire will break up on your soul he did
[1:01:49] it before he going to do it again
[1:01:51] oh glory to god he came to set the
[1:01:54] captain free because he said the spirit
[1:01:56] is upon me oh glorious spirit at the
[1:01:59] confess
[1:02:00] oh give the lord a shout
[1:02:02] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:02:04] glory to god amen
[1:02:06] we know exactly from the word which was
[1:02:08] recorded by the holy spirit how the
[1:02:10] original church was founded how god
[1:02:12] manifests himself to her the word can't
[1:02:15] change because the word is god
[1:02:17] thus the church was at pentecost is the
[1:02:20] standard
[1:02:22] that is the pattern
[1:02:23] there is no other pattern no matter what
[1:02:26] the scholars say no matter what the
[1:02:27] people are preaching the message say
[1:02:29] when you have the seed you have the holy
[1:02:31] ghost and you have this and you have
[1:02:32] that don't wonder what they say what
[1:02:34] they had on pentecost was the pattern
[1:02:38] [Applause]
[1:02:40] the prophet talked about um philip and
[1:02:42] and different ones when they saw the
[1:02:43] lighted quicken them and they started to
[1:02:45] follow jesus peter heard it it quickly
[1:02:47] and he followed jesus mary heard it
[1:02:49] quicken and followed jesus but all them
[1:02:51] who get quickened have to go in the
[1:02:52] upper room
[1:02:54] i'm not hearing you
[1:02:55] i'm not hearing you
[1:02:57] mary said be it done intermediate call
[1:02:59] it that i would she said i will grow up
[1:03:01] a room because of there is a power
[1:03:03] somebody said power
[1:03:05] not blessing power not anointing they
[1:03:07] had that
[1:03:08] power
[1:03:12] out of his belly
[1:03:13] out of his belly out of his belly
[1:03:17] shall flow
[1:03:19] shall flow
[1:03:20] shine flow
[1:03:21] shall flow
[1:03:22] rivers of living water
[1:03:26] oh god i locked it locked in i can't get
[1:03:29] out of this
[1:03:33] he not believe it on me
[1:03:35] as the scripture had said
[1:03:38] out of his belly shall flow
[1:03:40] rivers
[1:03:41] despair key of the spirit
[1:03:44] that they shall receive
[1:03:46] for their spirit was not given yet
[1:03:49] was prophecy coming to them
[1:03:52] oh glory hallelujah
[1:03:55] my god as long as men are being called
[1:03:57] and sent forth by the word of life
[1:03:59] there's an apostolate going on going on
[1:04:01] oh my hallelujah
[1:04:04] oh glory to god
[1:04:06] i love this part here
[1:04:08] what the church had at pentecost
[1:04:11] is her inalienable right
[1:04:15] originally she had the pure word of god
[1:04:17] she had the power of the spirit
[1:04:19] manifested in diverse science oneness
[1:04:20] and because the holy ghost the children
[1:04:22] of church was never organized by men
[1:04:25] it was led by the holy ghost it wasn't
[1:04:26] big it was hated on the spines it was
[1:04:29] oppressed it was persecuted unto death
[1:04:31] but it was true to god
[1:04:33] it stayed with the original pattern
[1:04:35] so this keystone people stating it
[1:04:38] is the capstone ministry in mechanics
[1:04:41] and dynamics to prove he's the same
[1:04:43] yesterday today and forever we have to
[1:04:46] prove it
[1:04:46] we can't just talk that we have to prove
[1:04:49] he's the same remember the kangaroos
[1:04:50] have to be proven and to prove and it
[1:04:52] will take the capstone ministry of jesus
[1:04:55] christ which is dynamics and mechanics
[1:04:57] together oh glory to god to prove it on
[1:05:00] the spot that's why i say which man on
[1:05:02] earth could say silver and gold her line
[1:05:04] on such as i have i give it unto you
[1:05:07] peter had it we have to have that same
[1:05:09] thing

[1:05:22] power of god not with a bunch of
[1:05:24] intellectuals no with the power of god
[1:05:27] mark 16 in action is the true church

[1:05:32] false all is his thoughts all is his
[1:05:35] fault
[1:05:36] hallelujah christ

[1:06:09] and powerless it exposes satan he fights
[1:06:12] that he cannot stand he knows

[1:06:17] get the true revelation of the true
[1:06:19] church and god help us we got it

[1:10:18] my
[1:10:19] his deck didn't stop him
[1:10:21] jesus that didn't stop him he returned
[1:10:23] again
[1:10:24] not a third person but the same person
[1:10:27] return again
[1:10:28] in the form of the holy ghost to
[1:10:30] continue to work
[1:10:32] and it continues on the book of accept

[1:10:52] that was upon him
[1:10:54] before his crucifixion was upon them
[1:10:56] after the resurrection and the holy
[1:10:58] ghost is a token
[1:11:00] that the blood has been applied
[1:11:02] because it follows the blood here we go
[1:11:04] all the way from the book of redemption
[1:11:07] so when the blood from the book is
[1:11:08] preached let me say this when the true
[1:11:10] word is preached it's the blood
[1:11:12] and the holy ghost follows the blood
[1:11:15] from the book
[1:11:16] oh my i'm going to finish here
[1:11:21] the children of the kingdom
[1:11:23] there must be the word of god manifested
[1:11:26] for the promised seed of that age
