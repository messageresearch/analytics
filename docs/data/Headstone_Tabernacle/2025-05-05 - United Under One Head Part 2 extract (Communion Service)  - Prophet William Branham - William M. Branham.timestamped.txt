[18:28] the message. Amen. Stay in the spirit.
[18:31] Praise God. United under one head.

[18:39] a baby by
[18:41] Sarah. She was 65 years old then and he
[18:44] was
[18:45] 75. What a ridiculous sight. An old man
[18:49] 65 or 75 and a woman 65 going downtown
[18:53] buying up all the pins and the bird eye.
[18:55] I want to have the baby. Well, what do
[18:58] you think the doctor would have
[18:59] thought? He said, "Sir, we want to make
[19:02] arrangements for the baby." Ever had one
[19:03] before? No. How old are you, Sarah? 65.
[19:05] What?
[19:07] How old are you, Abraham? 75. What you
[19:10] doing with all those little booties and
[19:12] things? We're going to have a baby. Oh,
[19:15] I can scientifically prove to you she's
[19:18] 20 years of past
[19:20] menopause. Why, you're ignorant. But
[19:23] Abraham called those things which were
[19:26] not as though they were because God said
[19:28] so.
[19:32] And as the years went by, he got
[19:33] stronger. Yeah. The first 30 days,
[19:37] Abraham said, "Sarah, how you feeling,
[19:39] honey?" No different. Bless God, we'll
[19:40] have it anyhow.
[19:42] Right.
[19:44] The first year passed, Sarah, how you
[19:46] feeling, honey? No different. Praise
[19:48] God. We'll have it anyhow. 20 years
[19:51] pass, how you feeling, Sarah? No
[19:53] different. Praise God. We'll have it
[19:54] anyhow.
[19:56] Why? God said so. It wasn't in his head.
[20:01] It was in his heart.
[20:04] God don't speak in the head. He speaks
[20:06] in the heart.
[20:09] That's where God lives. But if God's on
[20:12] the throne, he stirs you. He makes you
[20:14] go and see the things that he wants you
[20:16] to see. And you turn your eyes from
[20:18] things that the devil talks about. You
[20:20] stay right with
[20:23] God. Oh, how and we being Abraham's
[20:27] children. The Bible said that we being
[20:30] dead in Christ take on Abraham's seed.
[20:33] And we're hes according to the promise.
[20:36] And we can't believe God for 25
[20:38] minutes. And Abraham believed him for 25
[20:43] years and then had to take the child up
[20:46] to kill it to confirm the oath again.
[20:50] And then we're the children of Abraham.
[20:51] I wonder sometimes if we were the
[20:54] children of Abraham, we'd have Abraham's
[20:56] faith in God and would call the things
[20:59] contrary
[21:01] to God's word as though they were
[21:03] already
[21:04] happened if we were the children of
[21:07] Abraham. Now, I know this is rude,
[21:10] friends, but it's truth. Now, we notice
[21:14] then God takes the heart. He takes
[21:16] control. Now, when sin came in and upset
[21:20] your heart and and the devil come in and
[21:23] blocked it all off, but then God sent
[21:26] his own son made in the likeness of
[21:28] sinful flesh to cleanse that heart so
[21:32] that he could come in. He made a way
[21:36] appropriation preparation come down and
[21:39] appropriated a way that he could cleanse
[21:41] your heart so that he could come in. He
[21:44] can't come into your heart with all that
[21:45] sin and unbelief there with all I'm a
[21:49] Presbyterian. I'm a Pentecostal. I'm a
[21:51] Nazarene. Glory to God.
[21:53] Hallelujah. I want to be a child of God.
[21:57] Glory. See, but as long as you got that
[22:00] idea, God can't come in there. You're
[22:03] just a Presbyterian. You're just a
[22:06] Pentecostal. You're just a Nazarene. But
[22:09] when all them ideas can get out of
[22:10] there, then God can get in and get a
[22:12] hold and go to star in you. Right. See,
[22:16] God has to come in to be
[22:19] ruler. We unite under the heads of
[22:21] different denominations. God wants us
[22:23] united under his head. We unite under
[22:26] our own head and God wants us unite us
[22:30] under his leadership of our heart.
[22:34] What a difference man has made in it.
[22:38] Now you can't stand
[22:41] mutual. I want you to understand that
[22:44] you cannot stand
[22:48] mutual. You have to have one or the
[22:51] other. Some time ago the great
[22:55] evangelist Billy
[22:57] Graham who I believe to be a servant of
[23:01] God and other great evangelist. that
[23:04] Billy Graham said in Louisville,
[23:06] Kentucky at his breakfast, he picked up
[23:08] the Bible. He said, "This is a
[23:11] standard." He said, "When Paul went and
[23:14] had one convert, he went back a year
[23:16] later and he had 30 out of that one."
[23:20] Said, "I can go in the city and have
[23:22] 30,000 and come back in a year and not
[23:25] find
[23:26] 30." Well, maybe they was Billy Grim's
[23:30] converts. Maybe they were William
[23:32] Brandham's converts. If they are,
[23:34] they're not going very far. I say that.
[23:37] But if they're God's converts, they'll
[23:40] remain forever.
[23:41] [Applause]
[23:44] I thought, Billy, I'd like to say
[23:46] something here, Billy Oral, myself,
[23:50] other men, evangelists, pastors. What do
[23:52] we do? Go out into the field and we
[23:56] preach. And when it is the man repents
[23:59] of his sin, he comes up to the altar and
[24:03] says, "God, forgive me." And he does
[24:06] forgive him. Then what happens? The
[24:08] unclean spirit goes out of him. Then
[24:12] what do they do? They turn him over to
[24:14] some
[24:16] old morg. I hate to say that, but that's
[24:20] the truth. I always felt sorry for
[24:24] carbs. They take them into them old
[24:27] margs dead and then they're going to be
[24:29] sure they stay dead. They put fluid in
[24:32] them to be sure they can't come back to
[24:33] life. That's about some of these old
[24:35] coal formal churches you got around
[24:37] here. It's injection of some old
[24:39] man-made doctrine to be sure that you
[24:41] save
[24:46] it. That goes for every denomination.
[24:50] Go in there and documentate them with
[24:52] some kind of an old doctrine. Oh, you
[24:54] say the doxology and you repeat the
[24:56] apostles prayer or creed and you where
[24:59] is the apostles creed down in the
[25:02] Bible. There's no such a
[25:06] thing. If the apostles had any creed, it
[25:09] was repent.
[25:14] I think Peter spoke the apostles creed
[25:16] in Acts 2:38. He said, "Repent every one
[25:20] of you and be baptized in the name of
[25:22] Jesus Christ for the remission of sins,
[25:24] and you shall receive the gift of the
[25:26] Holy Ghost. For the promise is unto you
[25:28] and to your children to them that are
[25:31] far off, even as many as the Lord our
[25:33] God shall call."
[25:35] They had agreed that was it.
[25:38] But not one of these man-made
[25:40] creeds. Isn't it strange to see how that
[25:43] the devil takes this pattern here? some
[25:47] time ago noticing at the grave of
[25:50] Mohammad. At Mohamad's grave, there's a
[25:54] white horse that stands there. It's been
[25:56] there for 2,000 years. They change the
[25:58] guards about every four hours. What are
[26:01] they doing? They are expecting Mohammad
[26:03] to raise someday and get on this white
[26:05] horse and ride the world and conquer it.
[26:09] Did you know Jesus is coming on a white
[26:11] horse? Amen. See how close it look the
[26:15] church and all of its creeds and
[26:16] denomination. How close it can look just
[26:18] like the real thing. The Bible said in
[26:21] the last days the two spirits would be
[26:23] so close it would deceive the very elect
[26:25] if possible.
[26:27] It isn't communism. It's churchism.
[26:31] Right? That's a deceiver.
[26:36] Notice communism. Russia. Russia wants
[26:40] to unite all the world in one because
[26:44] they got a oneness desire in their
[26:46] heart. But they want to unite them all
[26:49] under
[26:50] communism. That's their idea. See,
[26:53] that's man's while the UN wants to unite
[26:56] them, too. All under the
[26:59] UN to what? Unite them together in a
[27:02] military
[27:04] power. Man is not surviving by military
[27:07] power.
[27:09] Man survives by the power of the
[27:11] resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ,
[27:15] not by military
[27:17] power, by sputnicks and so forth. We
[27:20] survive and live by the power of Jesus
[27:26] Christ. But see how they notice how they
[27:28] do it. Look here at Nimrod. He wanted to
[27:31] unite the people under one and build a
[27:34] tower. What was the type of Jacob's
[27:39] ladder? From earth to glory. What about
[27:42] the
[27:43] Catholic? They want to unite the whole
[27:45] world under one.
[27:48] Catholicism. What about the
[27:50] Protestant? He wants to unite them all
[27:53] under one under the Federation of
[27:55] Churches. Just as wrong and black as the
[27:58] Catholics are.
[28:01] It's the same old lying devil.
[28:06] It's true.
[28:08] That's a fatal
[28:10] mistake. Why they want they want them
[28:13] all to be a federation of churches where
[28:16] all under one head long as I can be
[28:20] ruler. Catholics want them all under one
[28:23] head. Pope can be the ruler. Russia
[28:26] wants them all under one head. So
[28:28] communism can be the ruler. UN wants
[28:31] them all under one head. So we the
[28:33] United States can kind of be the boss
[28:34] because we're the biggest nation. It's
[28:37] all the same devil
[28:40] and every nation in the world is
[28:42] controlled by the devil. So the Bible
[28:44] says
[28:46] here we have no continuing city but we
[28:49] seek one to come. I stood up over the
[28:52] grounds of the pharaohs and the Caesars
[28:54] and have to dig 20 ft down to find their
[28:56] where their throne set. Every earthly
[28:59] throne will fall. Every nation will
[29:02] fall. Every building will crumble. Every
[29:04] man-made creed will die. But Christ will
[29:07] remain forever and
[29:12] forever. Why you not under something
[29:14] like that? It's lost to begin
[29:17] with. But all of them won't united under
[29:21] that. Now you can't stand mutual. You
[29:25] just can't do it. When the unclean
[29:27] spirit is gone out of a man, he walks in
[29:31] dry places. The man goes down, he gets
[29:33] saved. He's taken back to a church.
[29:36] Well, now to be sure that he doesn't get
[29:38] strayed away under some other church
[29:40] than
[29:47] indocc. Don't tell
[29:51] me. I
[29:53] know. You got to follow our
[29:55] denomination. You must be baptized by
[29:59] poured a little water on top of your
[30:00] head or or or some
[30:03] way. Some of them baptized three times
[30:05] face forward, sometimes three times
[30:10] backward. What difference does it make
[30:12] anyhow? Amen. But you'll fall out and
[30:15] fuss about it.
[30:18] Shows it's man-made. Amen. It's got to
[30:21] fall. For every plane that my heavenly
[30:24] father hasn't planted will be rooted up.
[30:27] It's got to be. But upon this rock, what
[30:30] rock? the spiritual revelation of Jesus
[30:33] Christ. Upon this rock I'll build my
[30:36] church and the gates of hell can't
[30:38] prevail against it.
[30:41] The Catholic says it was
[30:43] Peter. The Protestant says it was
[30:46] Christ. But Jesus said upon the flesh
[30:49] and blood has not revealed this to you,
[30:51] but my father which is in heaven has
[30:53] revealed this to you. A spiritual
[30:56] revelation of the Lord Jesus. Upon this
[30:59] rock I'll build my church. Amen. Not
[31:03] because some man told you flesh and
[31:05] blood is not revealed to you. Not
[31:07] because you learn it in a communion. Not
[31:09] because you learn it in eating kosher
[31:11] bread. Not because you learn it in a
[31:13] bunch of creeds. But because the Holy
[31:16] Ghost has revealed it to you upon this
[31:20] rock I'll build my church. And all the
[31:23] gates of hell can't prevail against it.
[31:26] showed they would be against it, but
[31:28] they'll never
[31:29] prevail. Now, as we go on, the unclean
[31:34] spirit then what does he do? He goes
[31:37] over and he gets into this person and he
[31:40] begins to tell him this. You know what
[31:41] he does? Just like what Jesus said, you
[31:44] can pass the seeds to make one
[31:46] procelite. And what is he when you get
[31:48] through with him? A more twofold child
[31:51] of hell than he was to start with. You
[31:54] can deal better with a
[31:56] streetarted. You can deal better with a
[31:59] prostitute on the street or drunkard in
[32:01] some dive than you can with some of
[32:03] these old mossbacked so-called
[32:06] Christians.
[32:07] Exactly right.
[32:09] They sit down there and blow up like a
[32:12] toad frog eating buckshot and just carry
[32:15] on awful when they know more about God
[32:18] than a hot pot knows about Egyptian
[32:20] knife. You know that's the truth.
[32:25] Go down and see the glory of God.
[32:26] Somebody get healed. Say it's
[32:27] psychology.
[32:31] How can you believe when you've got
[32:32] nothing to believe with if God's on your
[32:36] heart's throne? I tell you, he'll agree
[32:39] with every word. Knowledge of Satan it
[32:42] can't be done. Science says it can't be
[32:43] done. God so loved the world, he gave
[32:46] his only begotten son. Unbelievers say I
[32:48] doubt that. God says amen.
[32:52] The Bible said Jesus Christ the same
[32:53] yesterday and forever. The Holy Spirit
[32:56] say
[32:57] amen. The church credle say I well he is
[33:00] and so much he
[33:02] is. I'm the Lord heals all thy diseases.
[33:06] Well, he used
[33:08] to. But the Holy Spirit on the heart
[33:11] will say amen to every word of God cuz
[33:14] he wrote it.
[33:17] He is a writer. He's the author.
[33:21] But the unbelieving scientific polished
[33:24] scholar with DDD,
[33:27] PhDLD, all that kind of
[33:31] nonsense, they'll disagree with
[33:34] it because they don't know no
[33:37] different. Like the old colored man was
[33:40] down in the South. He kept singing and
[33:43] his boss said, Sam Bone said, "What
[33:47] makes you so happy?" He said, "I got
[33:48] heartfelt
[33:50] religion." Oh, he said, "There is no
[33:52] such a thing as heartfelt religion." He
[33:54] said, "Boss, you made one mistake."
[33:56] Said, "What was that?" "You should have
[33:58] said there's no such a thing as
[33:59] heartfelt religion as far as you know."
[34:02] But he know
[34:06] differently. That's the way it is with
[34:08] the true bornagain experience of God.
[34:12] Man says there's no such a thing as the
[34:14] baptism of the Holy Ghost. It shows he
[34:15] hasn't got it.
[34:20] He trusts his creeds. We trust what God
[34:23] said. That's right. Now, what happens?
[34:27] You can't stand mutual. You've got to be
[34:30] filled with something
[34:33] to
[34:34] survive.
[34:37] Notice, you might be filled with one
[34:39] thing over another. You say, "Brother
[34:40] Brand, I'm kind of on the fence." No,
[34:42] you're not. The Bible plainly says that
[34:46] all that was not sealed with the Holy
[34:48] Ghost received the mark of the beast.
[34:52] All that didn't have the seal of God in
[34:54] their forehead had the mark of the
[34:56] beast. You got one of it now.
[35:00] I'd like to test it just a little bit to
[35:02] see where we're
[35:05] standing. Oh, the mark of the beast,
[35:07] remember, is a religious mark.
[35:11] Certainly it
[35:12] is. You might be filled with
[35:15] religion. You can have all kinds of
[35:18] religion. That doesn't save you at
[35:22] all. You can just be a religious fanatic
[35:25] if you want to be. Touch not, taste not,
[35:27] handle not, smell not. That don't have
[35:30] one thing to do with the Holy Ghost.
[35:34] You might be filled with a bunch of
[35:36] malice. You might be filled with a bunch
[35:39] of prejudice. so full that you can't
[35:41] even sit and hear one sermon
[35:44] preached. You might be filled with a lot
[35:47] of hatred you despise everybody don't
[35:50] agree with
[35:51] you. You might be filled with a lot of
[35:54] nonsense too. You might be filled with a
[35:57] lot of Arthur Godfrey's dirty jokes so
[36:00] much that you think too so much of that
[36:02] you won't go to church on Wednesday
[36:04] night or something. You might be filled
[36:07] with Elvis Presley's rock and roll.
[36:12] That's true.
[36:14] But you're filled with something.
[36:18] And your own life bears you record of
[36:20] what you're filled with.
[36:23] Father, there are fruits. You shall know
[36:25] them.
[36:27] You're filled with
[36:29] something. You might be filled with a
[36:31] bunch of
[36:33] laziness. Just too lazy to do anything
[36:36] about it.
[36:37] Well, you don't have to be that way.
[36:40] Christ died that you might be cleansed
[36:42] from all of those things.
[36:47] You might be filled with a bunch of
[36:49] creeds. You might be filled with a bunch
[36:51] of
[36:55] denominations, but God don't want you
[36:58] filled with that. God made a place in
[37:01] there to put himself in. God wants you
[37:04] to be filled with himself. What takes
[37:07] place when you're filled with God? When
[37:10] you're filled with God, you're filled
[37:12] with the Holy
[37:14] Ghost. You're filled with
[37:17] power. You're filled with love, with
[37:21] joy, with peace, with long suffering,
[37:24] with goodness, with meekness, with
[37:26] gentleness, with worship.
[37:29] You're filled with joy.
[37:32] Amen. David said, "My cup runth over."
[37:37] And if David had a cup running over
[37:39] before the Holy Ghost come, what would
[37:41] it be now?
[37:44] You're filled with something. And when
[37:46] you're filled with man's ideas, if
[37:49] you're filled with church entity, if
[37:51] you're filled with greed, you're only
[37:54] building yourself up that's got to fall.
[37:58] If you fill yourself up with a modern
[38:00] world, if you fill yourself up with
[38:03] lust, if you fill yourself up with
[38:05] pride, if you fill yourself up with your
[38:08] denomination, you are
[38:10] lost. There's only one way to endure,
[38:13] that is to put the original thing that
[38:16] God made that compartment in your heart
[38:18] to be filled with, and that was the Holy
[38:21] Ghost.
[38:25] The disciples said one day said, "Will
[38:27] you at this time restore the kingdom?"
[38:30] He said, "It is not for you to know the
[38:33] hour the father has put in his own mind,
[38:36] but you shall be filled with the Holy
[38:39] Ghost. Then you will be, not until then,
[38:43] then you'll be my witnesses in
[38:45] Jerusalem, in Judea, in Samaria, and to
[38:48] the uttermost parts of the world." Amen.
[38:52] My loving friends, may I say this to you
[38:56] tonight? God wants us
[38:59] one, but he wants us one. Not under the
[39:04] foolishness of
[39:05] manhad, but he wants us one. United
[39:08] under the holy godhead. Amen.
[39:12] United as one person, one man, one
[39:16] woman, one church, one people, one view,
[39:20] one purpose, one motive, one objective.
[39:24] That's Jesus Christ.
[39:26] One thing to serve him, one love, the
[39:29] love of
[39:30] God, one brother, brotherhood of man,
[39:34] one fellowship of the Holy Ghost, then
[39:37] we're united.
[39:40] That's what God is building this day.
[39:42] Regardless of what the devil does, he's
[39:44] building a
[39:46] tower. That tower is made out of the
[39:49] United people. Made out of Methodist,
[39:52] Baptist, Presbyterian, Pentecostal,
[39:54] Nazarene, Pilgrim, Holiness. It's made
[39:57] out of all the bornagain people that's
[40:00] got the baptism of the Holy Ghost in
[40:02] their heart, filling that little
[40:04] apartment, and looking straight to God
[40:06] for deliverance.
[40:08] We're united then as one.
[40:11] We won't fuss no more then. We won't
[40:13] argue no more. We'll act like man. We'll
[40:16] dress like man. We'll dress like women.
[40:19] Sons and daughters of God. Our
[40:21] character, our conduct, our faith will
[40:25] prove when God says anything, we'll say
[40:28] amen to it. If the Bible says for us to
[40:31] do certain things, we'll do it. We won't
[40:33] argue back. We'll just go and do it.
[40:37] That's what God wants us united under.
[40:40] Oh, how we ought to act in this present
[40:42] day. Here some time ago down in the
[40:46] Southlands, they used to have the
[40:48] slavery for the colored
[40:49] folks and the Africants, the boers that
[40:54] went on into Africa bought those slaves
[40:56] or captured them and brought them over
[40:58] here and sold them to the southern
[40:59] people for
[41:01] slaves. And they just sold them like you
[41:03] would an
[41:05] automobile. It never was
[41:07] right. And they they sold them down
[41:10] there for slaves. And they were
[41:13] sad. They'd have to whip them and make
[41:16] them work because they were sad. They go
[41:19] around and brokers and would buy a a
[41:23] human being just like you'd go to a used
[41:26] car lot to buy you a used
[41:29] car. Oh, it was wrong.
[41:33] And why even buy them five buy four five
[41:36] here for a certain price and take them
[41:37] and sell them to another man for a
[41:39] certain certain price. Buy the great
[41:42] husky healthy breed them big man to
[41:45] bigger women to make bigger huskier
[41:47] slaves like
[41:50] animals. One day a certain broker come
[41:52] by an old
[41:54] plantation and he said u I would like to
[41:58] know how many slaves you have for sale.
[42:00] He said, "Oh, perhaps maybe a few." The
[42:03] may I look them over? Said, "You
[42:05] may." And he went out on the plantation.
[42:08] And he be to look around and he found
[42:11] them out there hollering at them and
[42:13] scolding them because they were sad.
[42:16] They'd never go back home no more. Mama
[42:19] was over there, daddy was over there,
[42:21] maybe was over there, husband over
[42:23] there. They'd never see him no more.
[42:26] They were here for slaves that died in
[42:28] this charent buried here. They were
[42:31] sad. But this slave buyer hadn't noticed
[42:34] one young
[42:35] man. They didn't have to whip him. He
[42:39] had his chest out, his chin up, just
[42:42] everything just at the
[42:45] moment. And the slave buyer said to the
[42:48] owner, he said, "I'd like to buy that
[42:50] slave." Oh, he said, "But he's not for
[42:55] sale." He said, "He's so much different
[42:58] from the other." Said, "I know it."
[43:01] Said, "Just just set your price. What
[43:03] you want for him?" He said, "I told you
[43:05] he's not for
[43:06] sale." He said, "Uh, is he the boss over
[43:10] the rest of them?" Said, "No, he's just
[43:13] a
[43:15] slave." He said, "Do you feed him a
[43:17] little different from the rest of them?"
[43:20] said, "No, they all eat out in the
[43:21] galley
[43:23] together." Lord said, "What makes this
[43:25] man so much different from the other
[43:27] slaves?" He said, "You know what?" He
[43:30] said, "I wondered about that one time
[43:32] myself till I found out." Said, "I found
[43:36] out that over in the homeland in Africa,
[43:40] his father was a king of the
[43:43] tribe." and said, "Though he's an
[43:46] alien and he's away from
[43:49] home, but he still knows in his heart
[43:53] that he's a king's son and he conducts
[43:56] himself like a king's
[44:00] son. What are we to do? How should we
[44:03] act? How should we conduct ourselves as
[44:07] sons and daughters of the king?" Amen.
[44:10] We should dress, act, live, talk,
[44:13] testify like sons and daughters of God.
[44:17] Though we're an aliens, we're in a
[44:19] strange land amongst some dying worlds,
[44:22] but yet we're sons and daughters of the
[44:25] King Jehovah God.
[44:28] We are to agree with his word. We ought
[44:30] to say amen to his spirit. We ought to
[44:33] unite ourselves together as brethren and
[44:37] as sisters and conduct ourselves as king
[44:42] sons and
[44:43] daughters. Oh my. This is kind of hard
[44:47] for a Baptist, but I feel real religious
[44:51] right now. I believe I could almost
[44:53] shout.
[44:55] You don't think they shout? You hard to
[44:57] get around me sometimes. Oh, I feel good
[45:01] for I know the spirit of the living God
[45:04] is here.
[45:07] I've just seen something happen to set
[45:09] my soul on
[45:10] fire. Oh, let it be his name. God will
[45:14] have a church near
[45:16] him. It's not far down the road. We will
[45:20] be one. Our purpose will be one. Like
[45:24] the great temple when it went together,
[45:26] there wasn't a buzz of a saw or a sound
[45:29] of a hammer for 40 years.
[45:32] God's cutting them out of the Methodist,
[45:33] Baptist, Presbyterians, all funny
[45:36] looking blocks. But one of these days,
[45:37] the Holy Ghost will come that rejected
[45:40] cornerstone and the building will go
[45:42] together without a firm. One of these
[45:46] days, the stone that's been rejected is
[45:50] the chief cornerstone. You builders of
[45:52] these denominations, remember that the
[45:55] rejected stone is the chief
[45:57] cornerstone. He
[45:59] sure I believe him.
[46:02] Oh, how wonderful. How
[46:07] glorious. I know that he's present.
[46:12] Oh, I wish you felt like I do. I know
[46:15] you think I'm I may look silly, but I'm
[46:17] not.
[46:19] I mean, you may think I I don't know
[46:21] where I am, but I do.
[46:24] Oh, it is the spirit of the living God.
[46:27] I just can't preach no more. There's
[46:29] just something. The joy bells of glory
[46:31] has just set it on me. I never had it to
[46:33] happen like that. Just something I know
[46:36] there's coming a
[46:39] time. There's coming something is going
[46:42] to take place. I see it in the near
[46:45] future. The spirit of the living God
[46:49] calling fresh on his church. That's
[46:51] going to be something take place.
[46:54] I hear the sound in the mberry
[46:58] bushes. Something just spoke to my heart
[47:00] said, "Fear not, preacher. They'll be
[47:03] one one of these days.
[47:06] They'll believe. It may take persecution
[47:09] and things to guide us together, but God
[47:11] will guide his church together. Just as
[47:14] church as I'm standing this morning
[47:16] under one,
[47:18] that's Christ.
[47:20] Christ will be the head.
[47:23] No denomination will be the head. Christ
[47:26] will be the head of every believer.
[47:28] Hallelujah.
[47:30] Don't get scared. Hallelujah.
[47:32] Hallelujah. Please praise our God. He's
[47:34] worthy of ever praise that we could give
[47:36] him his
[47:39] son. Here some time ago, I was preaching
[47:43] and a lady walked up to me and she said,
[47:45] "Brother
[47:45] Brandom," she belonged to a certain
[47:48] religious cult and she said, "There's
[47:51] just one thing about your preaching that
[47:53] I don't like." Oh, I said, "There's a
[47:55] whole lot of this lady." She said, "But
[47:57] this one thing, you brag too much on
[47:59] Jesus."
[48:00] Oh, I said, "Lady, I can't brag enough
[48:04] if I had 10,000 million tongues." I
[48:07] couldn't praise him enough. He's so
[48:10] real. She said, "But you try to make him
[48:13] divine." I said, "He is divine."
[48:18] She said, "He was just a prophet." I
[48:20] said, "If he was a prophet, he's the
[48:22] world's greatest deceiver. But he was
[48:25] more than a prophet. He was a god of the
[48:27] prophets." Amen. She said, "You try to
[48:30] make him divine." That you said you were
[48:32] fundamental. I said, "I am." She said,
[48:35] "If I'll prove to you by the Bible that
[48:37] he was just the man, will you accept
[48:39] it?" I said, "If the Bible said so." She
[48:42] said, "St. John
[48:43] 11." She said, "The Bible said that when
[48:47] Jesus went down to the grave of Lazarus,
[48:50] the Bible said he
[48:52] wept." I said, "Is that your scripture?"
[48:55] She said, "It certainly is. He couldn't
[48:58] be divine and weep. I said, "Lady, your
[49:01] argument is thinner than the froth made
[49:03] out of a shadow of a chicken to starve
[49:04] to death." I said, "That has gold water
[49:07] with God." I said, "You failed to see
[49:10] him." When he went down to the grave of
[49:12] Lazarus, he wept. That was a man
[49:15] weeping. But when he pulled those
[49:18] shoulders together, said, "Lazarus, come
[49:21] forth." And a man of dead four days.
[49:25] Corruption knew its master. And a spirit
[49:28] knew its maker. And a man of dead four
[49:31] days stood on his
[49:34] feet. That was more than a man. That was
[49:37] God speaking through a man. He was both
[49:40] God and man. It's true. When he come
[49:44] down off the mountain that night hungry,
[49:46] looking around on a bush to find
[49:48] something to eat, that was a man hungry.
[49:50] But when he took five biscuits and two
[49:52] little fish and fed 5,000, that was more
[49:55] than a man. Yes, it
[49:58] was. He was a man when he was out there
[50:01] on that sea that night when he'd been so
[50:04] tired and virtues going from him from
[50:06] healing the sick all day long visions.
[50:09] He was a man tired laying down when the
[50:12] waves didn't even wake him up when
[50:14] 10,000 devils of the sea swore they had
[50:17] drowned him while he was asleep. He was
[50:19] a man when he was tired and sleepy. But
[50:21] when he put that foot up on the braid of
[50:23] the boat, looked up and said, "Peace be
[50:26] still." And the winds and the waves, oh
[50:29] lady, that was more than a man.
[50:34] I want to unite under his power. I want
[50:37] to unite with you men and women tonight
[50:38] under his power. He did cry at the
[50:41] cross, "Father, why has thou forsaken
[50:43] me?" He died as a man. But on Easter
[50:46] morning when he broke the Roman seal and
[50:48] rolled away the stone and rose
[50:50] triumphantly, he proved he was God.
[50:55] He's thrilled heart. He looked like God.
[50:57] He act like God. He is God.
[51:01] True. No one said, "Living, he loved me.
[51:04] Dying, he saved me. Burying, he carried
[51:07] my sins far away. Rising, he justified
[51:10] freely forever. Someday he's coming. Oh,
[51:14] glorious
[51:16] day. Don't want a blinding cross. He can
[51:19] say, "Pass me not, oh gentle savior,
[51:22] tear my humble cry. Why others dire
[51:26] calling? Do not pass me by down the
[51:29] stream of all my comfort, more than life
[51:32] to me. Whom have I on earth beside thee?
[51:35] Or whom in heaven but thee?"
[51:39] [Applause]
[51:40] On this block, I'll build my church.
[51:43] I'll unite my church together under the
[51:46] domain of the Holy Ghost. And all the
[51:48] gates of hell can't prevail against it.
[51:53] Thirdly, amen. That's who I want United
[51:57] under the power and the leadership of
[52:00] the Holy Ghost. Amen. To witness the
[52:03] every word of God that is true.
[52:07] Amen. Praise the Lord. God believe that
[52:10] God could electrify his people in here
[52:13] just now to a healing service like you
[52:15] have never seen before.
[52:19] If we just believe it, I believe in his
[52:22] presence this year. The king, there's a
[52:25] shout of the king.
[52:29] Many of you denominational preachers
[52:30] look down upon this bunch of scream and
[52:32] shout and you got the same idea that
[52:35] Balum had. They've done wrong. That's
[52:38] right. So have you. But you got a way of
[52:39] hiding yours.
[52:41] That's
[52:43] right. You say, "Oh, that Pentecostal
[52:46] preacher run away with another man's
[52:47] wife. So did that Baptist, that
[52:48] Presbyterian.
[52:51] But the papers keeps yours still." Amen.
[52:54] Some man's sins goes on before him. You
[52:56] know, some father.
[52:59] Give me the united power of the Holy
[53:02] Ghost and take all the rest of it away.
[53:05] I'll agree with Eddie Puit when he said,
[53:08] "Oh, hail the power of Jesus name. Let
[53:11] angels prostrate fall. Bring forth the
[53:14] royal diet on him and crown him Lord of
[53:17] all." Amen.
[53:20] Certainly. Praise God. That's it. That's
[53:24] it, brethren. United under one head.
[53:29] God, one leadership, Holy Ghost, one
[53:32] purpose, the kingdom of God.
[53:36] That's him.
[53:38] Oh, how
[53:40] glorious. How I'd love to see him. His
[53:43] great powers are in here now.
[53:46] I'm not going to even call a prayer
[53:48] line. God will call you from this
[53:50] platform.
[53:53] I believe that the king is in this camp.
[53:58] Balam looked at the moral. He failed to
[54:00] see that brass serpent that snitten
[54:03] rock. That's what's the churches today.
[54:06] The sniff neck uncircumcised the heart
[54:08] and ears. They failed to see that Holy
[54:11] Spirit going ahead of the church. Where
[54:14] God is supernatural signs take place.
[54:18] Christ the head of the church wants to
[54:20] unite us together tonight as one heart,
[54:24] one person. All you Baptist, Methodist,
[54:27] Presbyterian, Pentecostal, we want to
[54:29] unite together as one heart and one
[54:32] person under one king, God, one domain,
[54:35] heaven,
[54:38] all the church of the living God,
[54:40] Presbyterian, Menite, all that you are,
[54:43] God wants us. He's here. His spirit is
[54:46] yours.
[54:48] May he prove to you tonight that I've
[54:50] told you the truth.
[54:57] Praise the Lord. Let's all stand this
[54:59] evening.
[55:02] Amen. Amen. Just raise your hands and
[55:03] give him praise this evening. Thank you,
[55:06] Lord. Thank you, Lord. Thank you,
[55:08] Father. Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[55:10] Blessed be your name, Lord Jesus.
[55:13] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Just praise him
[55:15] this evening. Thank you Lord. Thank you
[55:17] for your word Lord. Thank you for your
[55:19] word Lord. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[55:22] Hallelujah. Thank you Lord
[55:24] Jesus. Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[55:27] Blessed be the name of the Lord. Just
[55:30] praise him this evening. Raise your
[55:31] hands. Close your eyes. Just praise him.
[55:33] Thank you Lord. Thank you
[55:35] Jesus. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[55:38] Hallelujah. Yes Lord. Yes Lord. Yes
[55:41] Lord. Yes Lord. Fill your people this
[55:43] evening Lord. Hallelujah. Unite us by
[55:46] your spirit. Unite us in faith, Lord.
[55:48] Yes, Lord Jesus. Oh, blessed be your
[55:52] name,
[55:53] Father. Thank you, Lord. Thank you,
[55:56] Jesus. Praise God. You appreciate the
[55:58] message this evening. Amen. Amen. Praise
[56:02] God. Amen. Amen. Let's just turn to our
[56:05] Bibles at this time. You want to switch
[56:07] over now to the communion
[56:12] service. Praise God. First Corinthians
[56:15] chapter
[56:18] 11.
[56:22] Amen. Thank you, Lord. 1 Corinthians
[56:25] 11 23-32. Let's just bow our
[56:30] heads. Heavenly Father, Lord, as we
[56:33] approach your word now, we pray, inspire
[56:36] it to our hearts. Bless it and sanctify
[56:38] it. Anoint your people, Father, for
[56:40] service in Jesus name with thanksgiving.
[56:44] Amen. And amen. Praise
[56:47] God. Amen. Verse
[56:50] 23. For I have received of the
[56:53] Lord that which also I delivered unto
[56:56] you, that the Lord Jesus the same night
[57:00] in which he was betrayed, took
[57:03] bread. And when he had given thanks, he
[57:06] broke it and said, "Take, eat. This is
[57:10] my body which is broken for you. This do
[57:14] in remembrance of
[57:16] me. And after the same manner also he
[57:19] took the cup when he had sucked, saying,
[57:23] "This cup is the new testament in my
[57:25] blood. This do ye as often as you drink
[57:28] it in remembrance of me.
[57:32] For as often as you eat this bread and
[57:34] drink this cup, ye do show the Lord's
[57:37] death till he
[57:39] cometh. Wherefore, whosoever shall eat
[57:42] this bread and drink this cup of the
[57:44] Lord
[57:45] unworthily shall be guilty of the body
[57:47] and blood of the Lord. But let a man
[57:50] examine himself, and so let him eat of
[57:53] that bread, and drink of that cup. For
[57:56] he that eateth and drinkketh unworthily
[57:59] eateth and drinkkeeth damnation to
[58:02] himself, not discerning the Lord's body.
[58:05] For this cause many are sick weekly.
[58:08] Many are weak and sickly among you, and
[58:11] many sleep. For if we would judge
[58:13] ourselves, we should not be judged. But
[58:17] when we are judged, we are chastened of
[58:19] the Lord that we should not be condemned
[58:22] with the world. Amen. And let's just bow
[58:25] our heads and close our eyes at this
[58:28] time. Heavenly Father, your people are
[58:31] gathered together in obedience to your
[58:34] word, Lord, to fulfill these ordinances,
[58:38] Lord, of the Lord's supper and feet
[58:42] washing. Father, Lord, we pray that you
[58:44] would bless the articles that have this
[58:48] bread and wine symbolizing the body and
[58:50] blood of the Lord Jesus.
[58:53] Lord, pray father that you would unite
[58:55] us in spirit, one faith, one Lord, one
[58:59] baptism, all under the banner of Jesus
[59:02] Christ. One motive, one objective,
[59:05] Father, Jesus Christ, Father, the
[59:07] kingdom of God. Father, Lord, continue,
[59:10] Lord God, to fill and refill your
[59:12] people, Lord. Bring a revival in the
[59:15] homes, in the lives, in the individual
[59:17] hearts, Father, a seventh revival, a
[59:20] Holy Ghost revival, Lord Jesus. And
[59:23] Lord, even this evening as they would
[59:24] partake of this bread and wine, Lord,
[59:27] may your anointing pour out upon your
[59:29] people. Break forth upon your people
[59:31] this evening, Father. Lord, and heal
[59:34] your people. Touch, Lord, the weary.
[59:37] Heal the sick and afflicted, Lord,
[59:39] naturally or spiritually, Lord. Raise up
[59:41] the downtrodden, Father. Lord, bring
[59:44] joy, the joy of salvation back to your
[59:46] people, Father. Lord, bring us, Lord, to
[59:49] adoption. Bring us to Lord to
[59:51] perfection, Father. Lord, all that is
[59:54] promised for us, we want it, Lord. And
[59:56] we want to walk into the manifestation
[59:58] of the sons of God. Father, Lord, have
[1:00:01] your perfect way this evening, Lord.
[1:00:03] Continue to unite us in Christian love,
[1:00:06] that we would respect one another and
[1:00:07] love one another and appreciate one
[1:00:09] another and pray for one another, Lord.
[1:00:12] And Lord, even as we would wash one
[1:00:13] another's feet, may we do it with
[1:00:15] humility and love and respect, Father.
[1:00:17] and Lord build that bond one for the
[1:00:21] other just as Jesus showed us Lord.
[1:00:24] Father Lord we give you thanks and
[1:00:25] praise in Jesus name. Amen and amen.
[1:00:29] Amen. Keep your heads bowed and your
[1:00:32] eyes closed as you want to observe a
[1:00:33] moment of silence as you would pray for
[1:00:35] the ministry at this time and the
[1:00:37] ministry would pray for you at this
[1:00:39] time.
[1:01:02] Praise the name of the Lord. Amen. God
[1:01:05] bless you. You may be seated. Amen. As
[1:01:07] the deacon and elders get ready to
[1:01:09] serve.
[1:01:12] Amen.
