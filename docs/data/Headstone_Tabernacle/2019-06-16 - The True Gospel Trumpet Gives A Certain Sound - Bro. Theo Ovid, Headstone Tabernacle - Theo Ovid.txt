Wednesday service amen blow a trumpet summon alarm there's a wake-up call a call for you to look at your life look at what Gordon do so you do have to wait for something tragic or something sudden to happen you have to be prepared it's a rebound up here so this morning we understand and we want to approach the Word of God listen we want to turn our Bibles to Ezekiel chapter 12 wanna read from verse 21 to 25 want to look at first Corinthians chapter 14 we wanna read verse 8 and we want to go to Revelation chapter 22 verse 17 Ezekiel's up to 2012 we live from verse 21 and the will of the Lord came unto me saying son of man what is that proverb that you have in the Land of Israel saying that these are prolonged and every vision feel it tell them therefore thus saith the Lord God I will make this provoked decease and they shall no more use it as a proverb in Israel but see unto them the days are at hand and the effect of every vision for there shall be no more any vain vision no fluttering div ignition within the house of Israel for I am the Lord I will speak and the word that I shall speak shall come to pass it shall be no more prolonged for in your days or rebellious house will I see the world I will perform it see it the Lord God we did from first Corinthians chapter 14 verse 8 for if the trumpet give an uncertain sound who shall prepare himself to the battle revelation 22:17 and the spirit and the bride say come let him that heareth say come let him that is athirst come and whosoever will let him take the water of life freely let us bow our heads Almighty God we thank you for your love and your presence and your word has had been read and I I can't really strike it you stick the Holy Spirit strike that word and and send it out to the people we invite you to do so Lord take me out of the way and minister to the people inspire the words of them today in the name of Jesus and I pray father garda to reach down this is a Helen Paul and a family the bereaved Lord that you would comfort them that you would overshadow them on your love would surround them bless them Lord and cheese in my ask it amen and him then you will be seated it's always good to be in the house of God I know you hear me setup many times but I don't know how you consider it a privilege but it is a privilege if we were here killin time is one thing but every service every day we are nearer than we were before nearer to the common of the Lord so this morning of a title the true gospel trumpet gives a sittin sound the true gospel trumpet gives a certain song I love an inspiration here in recognizing and acting on the Word of God that's quite ready alright let's go in the Garden of Eden man was divided in two parts the devil took his head and God took his heart the devil makes him look at things and say well it just can't happen I can't reason talk God took his heart to dwell in his heart to make him believe things that his head don't even know nothing about so in the Garden of Eden the devil take the head and go take the heart or glory that God showed no matter what your head no matter where your head telling you what your mind telling you what your feelings telling you consider what God is telling you because he will speak how many believe God will speak so if it's in your heart you think down here that's where the real song comes from is from the heart that is where God talks and here is where the devil talks from so let's cast down what the devil said and takes a sitting song and that sitting song is God talking to your heart that is the truth and that is God promises so you act on the church today take a fight with me that's your own objective yeah come to church to cover us with me because I am just a messenger or glory not even a fight yet a fight with what God sealed because his word is what is above every one of us the word is God not to us God the word is God not some man has got the word is God hallelujah that's the plumb line the plumb line is the word glory to God so the reason and we we struck it and I try to send her the message that you would listen to Wednesday service I wake war the purpose of a trumpet and white guards have the top with the song it's our purpose God abroad jumping for naught when he says shot an alarm in my holy mountain is to get your active is to push you into action is to get your moving if the trumpet give an uncertain sound who could be before the battle it would be confusing I never saw me for the army man no one saw me get up wake up hey man assemble on in the courtyard whether it is what get your guns prepare for war a certain song bro you know and the reason is a trumpet is because that's the cot you all the noise of the battle if you have the song to retreat you have the blow second song it means come back come back come back it has nobody show they come back on the who here in you and gun shooting and all this happen so I jump it up the blow to cut you the noise I would have to come that touch of the noise a voice have to speak to cut you the noise a kind of confusion in the life Facebook and cellphone and kill and boy and man and woman and all kind of stuff something a little touch of the noise and she's talking around or call and blow a trumpet or glory to God attention or poor either God we all know up being a battle hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory to God the devil sent all kind of missiles and people imagine mrs. Baumann and people walking home what can I give nothing happening with all a hell against you not a sectional not a sectional hello all I hell you might not think that but it is so there's just two forces on every develop he'll want to wreck your family wreck your home wreck your marriage because he's a home wrecker he's a marriage record and he I started in the gadna even got caught old Adam this is what you have to do is everything but that tree don't touch it for the day you eat you day you die the same gotta sit with the judge what is a good good all the time there's a phrase he's a good of his word he has to keep his word and his word a certain the one is sure McDaniel said the vision is certain and the interpretation sure it must surely come to pass whoever cut out all the Proverbs that the word is prolonged and the vision is delayed he gonna cut it out because he's here come to pass I brought my spirit probably doing one year what all theologians failed to do in 2,000 years I'm not worried God is on time Oh glory to God don't you worry quarters on time you're sweatin it wandering wandering wandering but God is ticking just on time he was unkind to Nora he was hunting for the Cheever boys he was hunting for Danielle he was hunting Somozas he was on time for the cherry Israel you'll be on time for you get the Lord a shout in the house [Applause] he makes no mistakes hallelujah a certain song is to arouse the people in the Christian that's what the song come for to arouse you in the action not into bleep a G naught into sloppiness not Intel deadness and laziness in your Testament property could not be held any longer than 50 years God instituted this law that the devil could only holier so much and no more you do your thing you get tired forget jail you get in prison but until the time when it's time of Jubilee come you have to go free unless you don't want to you have to want it because those that don't want it they have to go and get it s ball and they could never be free after that you have to want to accept the trumpet of the Jubilee that is so not for you but you could break out of watch it was in brick off your pass the Bible call it the acceptable year of the Lord the year in which court chopped onions grace Alleluia grace upon your life blood upon your life you're even asking feared it's fallen is you have to accept it if you have to walk in it or go a woman go that way you are free hallelujah hallelujah loosed you are free from your path you are free from your fears you are free from your failures caught free and people [Music] well my position but no one was Gwaltney adultery and Jesus free a woman go and sin no more you're free put a son man's free indeed it wasn't as if you could see how physically tied up so and then he was breaking no she was as the same person walking normal but in the realm of the spirit every spirit and demon I was old enough not to pull their hands off same dress same shoes same hairstyle same person outside but on the inside free free free there are some situations they can figure it out if we take God to undo what has been done but this is a speciality to do what anybody has kind of do this is where he the specialist what the mechanical fix what the doctors can fix what preachers can fix God is a fixer or God the you sick in here you want to know him I fresh this morning you want the movements are healing this morning for you won't bung in here you want them kill know him as somebody who set you free or get the Lord I show your brand you want to know he's open the eyes of the plane he's a liberator he's a deliverer he's a winner huh I stood God be sure I've hit this morning he's going to speak glory to God hallelujah Jesus the Prophet 740 a peer the price on the 50th day the redemption and the power that belonged to the church that was lost in the gardener Eden was redeemed back go say that come back it has been redeemed back the blood the price paid on Calvary it was a blood price I'm no man to pay that price when Jesus put on the cash hallelujah the devil after give up or glory the court Jesus Jesus coming for himself to show he is he Lord he's Jesus he coming for you there was a price to be paid when he put on the price which was a blood price that ever means that devil have to give you up God glory to God no one they say all that the father had given me will come and who he foreknew he call and who he called justified or glory before before he was an adultery before he was in fornication before he was lying and backbiting before I like that he put your name on the Lamb's Book of Life and call her any ho he wasn't looking as where you are he was looking at where you will be or do I show you a I shout in the house he didn't look at where you are looking at where you will be yeah let's continue so Daniel he pick up the scores of Jeremiah because he recognized Jeremiah prophesied seventy years and this was a sixtieth year and he recognizes two more years left hallelu a them prophets they will move by the Holy Ghost there wasn't predicting hoping or rolling some dice there was moved by the spirit and the Spirit of God can't lie that's one thing the spirit can't do the sly if the spirit speaks it's choose if the spirit speaks it gonna be true if clods say you will be healed I don't care what the doctor tell you that the spirit speaks of your healing of your deliverance of your ceiling of the brains being broken off for you North Evelyn help us stop you from being free from be loosed from your condition or get the Lord a shout let's continue we pick up the scrolls Jeremiah 32 sixth cousin Hannah meal and left him some air and they were going to the captivity and it was kept in little vessels it shows where the power of God and the schools and the secrets are kept is simply vessels oh girl you want to put it in your lesson this secret this power what glory to God is no wonderful what she had been in the very mix but nobody but three companions and in them different parts of the kingdom so this Daniel had three friends being who they were Shadrach Meshach and Abednego is not right here you are you ready Daniel standing alone with God held the victory for 68 years think of it 68 years he kept the victory and was undefined before God without the baptism of the Holy Ghost [Applause] Daniel standing alone let's continue without the baptism of the Holy Ghost without the blood of Jesus to make intercession for him only with blood of bulls and goats and heifers that he had to offer secretly because of the hidden traditions of the Lamb that taken on death and I want you to notice how Daniel yes an alien yet oates it from his people out state from his church without warn children without any church to go to without any hymns to be sad what he sang himself in the midst of this he held on to what that prophet said you know Jeremiah didn't lie he know it wasn't Jeremiah he know was the spirit upon Jeremiah that told him there was just two more years left and he held on or glory no but are you holding on because you have to hold on you know when things falling on your right when things falling on your left when the buildings are caving and this is happening on your life you have to hold on that is when you have to trust God not when things going smooth and things going good when things are rough and I know for you somewhere here you things are rough or glory to God and if you don't hold on no it will get rougher but you have to hold on no because something better is coming if they could reach you the strong barrier if little bridge of this barrier ain't no stopping you now but it's a barrier than a break let's continue Daniel no church to go to nobody to fellowship with everybody was hidden temples everybody worship idols no Christian songs nobody believed the same thing he did and in 68 years from a young man about 12 14 years old so when he was taken from there he helped you to God what a testimony a young man 12 13 14 years old he'll shoot record for all them years without the baptism of the Holy Ghost with all the blood of Jesus mechanisation session without fellowship without church without encouragement without somebody what's up in him and call him on the phone to encourage him you waiting for somebody to encourage you you better and college yourself okay the Lord David said I encouraged myself oh that will warm the heart of any true prophet of God today as you look back and see that this troop of it said how know we are the end time he said I understood my books that Jerry my my brother many years ago prophesied that Israel would stay long 70 years and that time is about fulfilled and he made himself ready he called her fast he sanctify himself but this is important put it upon his head I went to fasting and praying to understand about what he was living in and if Daniel here we go the prophet of the Lord could consult Jeremiah books bring him to such a place that even Israel coming out of them alive was coming out of Babylon to go back and homeland will calm the fast and stuck on occasions how much more to be to do the Church of the Living God another time it's fear the mountain time shall be no more these superpowers have enough bombs and nuclear bombs a bomb or diesel please and you can take our imbalances in an arm like Marine marine the powers that destroyed estate is already under it it not coming they have supersonic subsonic ding that could fly into space and come back already it's just they don't understand power we have to have because what God said is a supersonic to take you to a plumber that they either look for your care failure you shall be changed in a moment in a pretty as a wink I corn poor look for me and God I'm interested in the super sermon that God has because when 10 Enoch was walking and he just hit that supersonic and he was not for God took him you talk about the superpower us matters my god yo yo yo make me feel to get started right now the corner god science laboratory to bring on some mysteries of God's supernatural power but he demonstrated all to the ages or glory to God and you have a beautiful climax coming in is last day of a beautiful bride being raptured of the earth when the devil looking for he can't find her at all he's oh god I

saying that these are prolong on every vision feel it time singing so long this message this revival this preacher is power taken too long because what have attainment is it tell them the seer the Lord I will make this proverb to cease oh oh glory to God do you love him this even breeze going to miss continuing here okey now in Corinthians 14 eight strip reread if the trumpet give an uncertain song because the bugle the trumpet is to give this song for the students to react not just a year oh god is some glowing or I thought Motel miss motor sleep no when the song joong bed blow it give a specific meaning it give a distinct song so let's have this polish the shoes of the clothes clean make up the bed patterns things become a bit they don't leave the soleus doesn't be the bedroom flop that's the make up the bed spick-and-span yeah they're soldiers things have to be in order because they are shoulders you fight because you are soldier you dress because you are soldier a man you have things clean up because you were soldier it's not right if he's a trained soldier he knows every song of the trumpet he is trained to the trumpet when the trumpet songs he said if the trumpet give an uncertain song then the soldier don't know what to do because he's only trained to the song of the trumpet he knows exactly what to do because the trumpet song then tells him what to do isn't that right now watch the solar is trained to a trumpet the son of a trumpet and the gospel trumpet the gospel the song of the word of God that comes my trumpet if one never knew the son of the gospel trumpet he'd be confused he didn't know what the word said what the word taught what the church said he'd be a bit confused and when he heard there's another trumpet he wouldn't know how to prepare himself so the trumpet means you are learning prepare yourself and the trumpet is song and exactly with the gospel and the people don't know how to act they don't know how to stand in line to make ready to battle they're confused because they have been listening to different trumpets creats denomination and sectarianism and that affects how they perceive how they supposed to act because the gospel itself yummy yummy no it's not just to listen it has to push you into action let me say it again what you are hearing is not to just listen it just to influence you to action no the Prophet to speak in here and this is something I want to get into but a woman she's in the hospital she's dying listen to this she leaves her husband she goes off and marry a Salesman maybe he's handsome big fellow she finds out he's not the man that her husband was after what she thinks well I've done that I will fall in love with somebody else she goes on she travels on she goes to church continually the pastor never took her name has never took her name from the book she goes to church she lives just like she wants to live the first thing you know now look mrs. durian Jesus Christ with all my heart I believe in it but the action and of fruits prove that she's not he said don't listen to the uncertain song let it someone from the gospel here who that she's not for she she wouldn't be doing them things she wouldn't be acting that way she will have different towards listen listen here we go she'll be governed by a different thing her soul I want to pay close attention to what we're eating here right now the first time she greeted back there when she started IRA out running around on husband yes I interlock here her soul is here there's a separation line that if she ever crosses it never cross back never come again she keeps on are after a while when she sins against this thing on the inside of her that speaks about the Word of God the first thing you know she will get involved in this intellect leave a little alone the Bible said the solar synergy that so shall die die means to separate then the soul there we go the conscience that once condemned you isn't there anymore and you're done go on intellectual you join some all cold formal church that don't believe in those things and the first thing you know the soul that condemns you for the first time you told a lie the first time you put on those short clothes the first time it is immoral acts will come so dead to you you won't feel it anymore on and on you go after wise death will catch up with you you're living out yonder your pastor will come and see all things they ready to go now everything is fine now with all the reason power she's going to church she gives charity she thinks so in her mind she follows the taste of her mind I know I got to go to church I should be friendly I should treat my neighbor right I should do this but she has grieved away the Holy Spirit then here we go in all of her debt she gets ready to die she's lean a bit and at once she wakes up and hollers oh my god I am lost the past has a giver hippo give an injection and he was given an injection and she would begin to see she can't speak she will Mumma what is it her soul has caught up with her before dead not only woman men also who's pulling the love of Jesus Christ who tell him don't make fun of it it will catch up with you some day a certain and I'm standing here this morning you grieve it so far till you can feel it no more but it will catch you some time again it will come back to you the dirty things the bad things that Taplin the babbling the backbiting the selfishness the things you have done all of that come back to you someday lain on the deathbed how the needle injection needle in these last days I stopped the deathbed confessions of Towson's shoot the needle him no ma'am he trying to speak what is it his soul caught up with him that soul and spirit is the spirit of the thing here that the intellect is fixed in the field so what he's showing you know this intellect this spirit the intellectual part is where you have your education where you have your degree where you have your boss and you're in charge of this company the CEO way is Prime Minister all that is in the spirit around here which is intellect and when somebody dies that pad breaks up so there's G C the CX c degree all of that breaks up because that is not relevant so that is conditionally so so when that intellect breaks up this short comes up now and the stories you review this soul reveals your real condition not your intellect your spirit well I'm fine I have a kind of a house of a land I was true in pulling back my house or whether it isn't whatever you think is good or what life is about whatever you interpret I like about all that breaks up that's the intellectual in fiction the fail is only in the main the ego the intellect show that you live by is going to perish but that soul you agree from your intellectual is going to hold you to eternity don't you listen to an uncertain song you believe the gospel in its fullness say I went to church I did what was right I pay my tithe those things are all right that's intellectual look when they're trying to stop that hippo needle in the arm and let them know me off they don't know nothing they trying to speak their soul has caught up with them they realize that the reason their mind is perishing with their brains so their brain cells dying their reason is dying the intellect is going and their stories coming up that intellect is where you get your rent to tell any son type all of it all of this year because I'm not really a daughter and every a Sun God release them sure and through you you some people's manipulate and control the children all that is right yes let's continue perishing with their brain the main your mind will perish with your death and I will prove it to you the lie detector don't take your mind it takes your soul the vibration of your nerves don't run on your mind it runs on your soul so your intellect will die when your brain ceases to function and that is why I do lie detector because when you put it like that and ask a question you could see it nice I did not steal it you could see it so but because the lie still your mouth saying it it's stupid but he didn't assume because you're hot solder is fast your blood pressure reason the machines telling you you did it if man of a machine I could say like one machine go ahead God will need all that machine to ask you questions that every man would be a lion manager so you can hide from God but I continue when the blood feels the poor to your brain the nerves cease then your mind goes away and your soul catches up with you and when this woman's soul catches up with her she said my god I am lost she's rolling she's an agony doctor said give her another one dead no until the death angels sweep her spirit from her but the hippo needle my dead in the flesh it's my debt in the mind but it can't didn't that soul that knows it's seen before God it will haunt a true ceaseless ages to Eternity that soul will still haunt and aunt and old as he is Rulon you came from where you go through where you came out of eternity you step into a space called time you go open it in the time in the eternity and what you are in your soul that you go out the same that's why the profits that you are what you I in your soul so when people was condemning somebody playing piano at a short dress she said but she have a fine spirit there was trying to take issue with the clothing but he saw beyond the clothing they could take issue with a woman of the well but yes or beyond that he saw the soul in that woman had a season at a germinate and he came to call that the Pharisees that appear to be white and clean they saw was black they had nothing beer because it rejected the Christ oh praise the Lord amen I want to belong again Oh hallelujah praise God watch something he said in the past of a comforting woman and said well our dear beloved sister she was such a loyal member of our church she came every Sabbath day she of the poor she had the needy she's done all these things today she's in glory they continue but if the truth was only known out into the haunting place called hell that soul that's separate from out here on earth that she listened to an uncertain song she went off into eternity without knowing God without doing Christ as a new bird she believed it in her heart she believed it in her mind she thought she was right but he was wrong it's your soul he said God have mercy listen to the song the gospel have no uncertain if the trumpet songs if a solar here's the bigger blow there are many veterans here this morning they know what retreat means they know what these different signals of this bugle songs and this bugle doesn't give us it a song just a big bunch of noise how will the soldier know to PP himself if one church say do this another church said do that one chants they do this another one do that how can the Christian know what to do one say wanting another one another but I tell you my dear brother I will tell you a place where there is no uncertain song that is in the Bible God's eternal Word it's the gospel and the gospel is the power and the demonstration the Holy Spirit in action no uncertain song the man who possesses it the woman who possesses it what a blessed no wonder David said the blessed Wilson lay-oh halle-loo is hidden power it's a hidden something no one city every man that is born of the Spirit of God knows when he passed from death unto life knows the place they are wait a minute when that changed her life when unbelief of the Bible changed to believe in the Word of God when haughty high-minded things changed to humble Christian life how do you know it's a certain song question Moses didn't think he could do it he tried his own doctoral standpoint but one day God spoke to him take off your shoes Moses I know your Prince of Egypt it was non-sitting how did Moses no that wasn't uncertain because the voice that was talk to him was exactly with the scripture so it can't be some voice tell you all kind of stuff northerners have to be with the structure that's how you know whether is a certain song if the script if the voice talking you isn't scriptural then don't listen to it it has to line up with the scripture because the script is the template is the plumb line is the umpire is the absolute or chlorine if is the anchor point or glory to God hallelujah we believe that if the voice talk of you isn't scripture then don't listen to it but if it's scriptural hear it cause it's the voice of God Moses went on and deliver the chera Israel because he heard a certain song Oh glory to God hallelujah praise God so when Jesus came he came to preach acceptability of the Lord which is the Jubilee is not right then all slaves and prisoners as they were was

team group five your meet with brother Mike Blackman after the service also after the service right after the service there will be a meeting of the officers and all those who are part or who have also been part of the convention planning in the past and the different areas and those that are interested in helping out in the areas of transport and hospitality and in different areas we just

pray and fast here the tabernacle from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. so we invite a church to come out it's two public holidays is Wednesday and Thursday so this Wednesday we add a tabernacle from 9:00 to 5:00 or prayer and fast and then on Thursday we'd like to invite everyone if possible to come to help tie ups and work projects that we have around in and around the tabernacle in preparation for the convention as well also convention related the menus for the meals that would be available for purchase during the convention the menus are on the notice board downstairs and there would be a table downstairs where if you are interested in pre-ordering your meals and we encourage you to pre-order so that we can have more management of how many meals need to be heated for it etc that you would certainly indicate to the team downstairs in addition we want to give a gentle reminder and encouragement for those of you who have made your pledges and your commitments to have a conversation with the sisters downstairs would take care of that and if you have not had the opportunity to do anything just yet we certainly welcome you to do so with respected Thursday if you have any questions about the different work projects you can see by the sheen after the service as well so and just as a general announcement July 5th 6th and 7th is our annual convention and we are the great expectation to have bleep brethren of like precious faith booth in Trinidad as well as overseas will be coming in for a wonderful time and it is not to be taken casually it is it is something that God would have seen happen before we were even born because I always say to friends is either God is in control or he's not in control if you're not in control then we finished but if he's in control and everything is already plan he ready see how everything on a workout and I brought over was preaching the day he sees when you were filled with the Holy Ghost you see when he make a mistake you'll to see when he restored and he sees when you come right back any sees when you get your heart right with gone and he sees you all the way to adoption to perfection on the rapture so we are trust in God that this convention would be a turning point not just for the Chilkoot for individuals in the church who are looking to get closer to God because it'll come a time the prophets puka when he will be able to gather like this and at that time you have to stand on your own when nobody else is around with that anchor at holes that is inside of your soul as a testament is an individual in the body of Christ gonna church say Amen so this let me recap the announcements once again right after the service we'd like to meet with all those who are involved in a different aspects hospitality and even if you
