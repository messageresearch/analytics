and Matthew 24:11 2:14 Philippians chapter 1 this main and this is Paul speaking and this I pray that your love may abound yet more and more knowledge and in all judgment that you may approve things that are excellent that you may be sincere our total fence till the day of Christ being filled with the fruits of righteousness which are by Jesus Christ unto the glory and praise of God but I would you should understand brethren that the things which happen unto me have fallen out rather under the furtherance of the gospel so that my bonds in Christ are manifest in all the palace and in all other places and many of the Brethren and the Lord works and confident in my buns are much more bold to speak the word without fear so you see Oh Paul is interpreting has been in prison and so on some indeed preach Christ even of envy and strife and some also of good will one preach Christ of contention not sincerely supposing to add affliction to my buns but the other of love knowing that I am set for the defense of the gospel what then notwithstanding every way whether in pretence or in truth Christ is preached and I hear and do rejoice ye and will rejoice Romans chapter 1 verse 16 for I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ for it is the power of God on the salvation to everyone that believeth to the Jew first and also to the Greek and our last scripture from Matthew 24 reading from verse 11 and many false prophets shall arise shall rise and shall deceive many so as many false prophets and those many guys out to deceive many first twelve and because iniquity shall abound the love of many shall wax cold but he that shall endure unto the end the same shall be saved and this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations and then shall the end come let's pray father we thank you for your word and it's such a beautiful atmosphere this morning we are so unworthy but we thank you for your presence and because the blood is here father your presence is upon the blood and it give us this opportunity to have fellowship this morning may come down like you came down and a cool of the evening to Adam and a fellowship with your son may come down this evening today and have fellowship with your people around your word in Jesus name I ask it amen a name and you may be seated oh praise the Lord we have communion this evening and it's such a blessing again to be here in the presence of God that part is very important in the presence of the Lord well this morning our title I want to take it from there was seventeen of that scripture in Philippians and the title is I am set for a defense of the gospel of Jesus Christ I have an inspiration the feet of the fathers Malachi 4:5 and 6b who'll I send you Elijah the Prophet before the coming of the Great and dreadful day of the Lord he shall turn the hearts of the father's to the children and the hearts of the children to their fathers lest I come and smite the earth with a curse amen so I ready for the word this morning all right something upon my heart like to share with you and the trust will be heavy fine and strengthen and build you up and the small holy feet okay the position of price was revealed in and was revealed by brother Branham that prophet of Malachi for therefore he could not build a denomination or name for himself so once you see Jesus you can't build your own tabernacle and that's what Peter and then when Jesus was adopted this is how we want to build one for you one for Moses was Elijah a voice said shut up a voice said hear him doorbell no tabernacle all this he afterwards was Jesus and that's what we have to come to that spot to see Jesus therefore he could nibble in denomination on in himself he knew that denominational spirit organization spirit a man is not of God even though it means well and it looks good he knew that man inspired systems of churches that fall from the word system of intellect command would fail and fall so he could declare this statement and this is from this data public man Christ never sent me to build an organization Christ sent me to build individuals to the stature of Jesus Christ that there might be a power house and a dwelling place of the Spirit by the word individual to that place not build an organization or a greater denomination but to build individuals the sons and daughters of God could we give the Lord a shout the Bible teaches us he came unto his own his own received him not but as many as received him to them gave he power to become so the power is given for you to become that you can make yourself a Christian you're not born a Christian you're gonna become a Christian or get the Lord a shout don't sit on me now are you with me now you don't sprinkle holy water and you only become a Christian or glory to God you are bested you are tested you are tried you are formed into you become something or give the Lord a shout glory you're gonna get baptized in water that don't make you a Christian you can come up with dry sand I go wet sinner same sinner you have to be changing in a man that's why he said on you heart I will give you a new spirit I will give you and then I'll put my spirit in your spirit glory to God put my spirit in your spirit or glory to God not even your news for good enough you have to get his spirits so God's purpose and this is not message bishops message poops and who was in charge and who is leading the bride and who are the lead ministry God's purpose is to reveal Christ and Christ is the mystery of God revealed or glory to God no man could clean your soul no church between your soul only the blood of Jesus could cleanse your soul or give the Lord a shout any like cleanse in this morning only the blood could do that you know modern blood it has no no no computer blood it has no virtual blood is the blood of Jesus Christ dies the blood that cleanse your soul that's the blood for you it's the blood for your family it's the blood for your children is the blood for your grandchildren it's a pleasure your husband is the blood for your wife is the blood for the church I know it was the blood it's till the blood this morning it's a blood message we have we still preach in the blood this morning the blood not changing and in the blood of the life go glory to God amen hallelujah glory to God Satan will make you all kind of promises but he has nothing to give you he has nothing he has no salvation what is Satan anything contrary to the word he doesn't have salvation he does not light his kingdom is darkness and

what does Satan Kingdom anything contrary to the Word of God did a lot of show [Applause] anything contrary to the word anything anything anything anything I don't care who's hittin using anything that contrary to the word the Satan's Kingdom is the word first is the Bible first it's the word first we put the words a template or glory to God hallelujah hallelujah glory to God there's a lot some princes when Adam and Eve listen to the lie of the devil the holy image of God left them and but Isaac spoke a powerful things on the last he said when you receive a lie it changes you you want

as soon as the fellowship was broke with God their fellowship between each other was broken so when of the people not fellowship and you know happens the line cut some way cut with God because if I said if we say we have no sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is nothing else but if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us of all our sins on the blood of Jesus I will cleanse us from all unrighteousness and we have we all cherish one with another because we under the same blood okay the Lord a shout get the Lord a shout we under the same blood we under the same 700 blood

disables this is at Nancy stories this is not fairy tales this is a reality the God of Israel is what I'm the Eva I think can change a thinking change a fellowship of the husband wasn't right to begin the pastor book her tinkin actually changed I was telling someone oh I'm on top of bitterness of course and human all kind of thing like bitterness and a guy was telling me about this alternative medicine place in central woody with cancer cases and stuff on the city number one cause a Kansas is oats oats or is another imaginary thing or just love you know he said a place called here be hot lunch and these odds does produce chemicals just as forgiveness has produced chemical so when somebody ever ought it has produced something inside idea that is bring get negative on the body or since I done a grudge that lunch I crunch like a decisional or tan your long time I guess it Costner gives your family again somebody ever audio you don't want to drop it your mind in it you grow in it you take and rent free space and somebody's hacked because you don't want to let them go you let him occupy the air pay my rent inside your heart but the insider there but you don't want to let them go hallelujah and when somebody forgive different kind of chemical healings that they come that's why faith is based upon forgiveness all glory to God I setup bitterness and anger so called Christians Lodge in this system then chase ballin Amen by the hateful then just wanna name him but they wanted kill or the in church ball in a man but they up to no good but will be like that no because if you want to break into the realm of this third full promise of the rapture you have to break in the realm of the Spirit and say this based upon forgiveness to pull you on the illusion of charity because only child he could take us out not even brotherly kindness ever take the love of God to take us out the same thing and conquer the bull the c-pillar conquer the bees right now Oh glory to God

easy just Killebrew common I kill him but when God along to forget the gun and then something came over here he said we should happen all the time something came over him he fell a love for the pull and he pull no comment because they see as far as the bullets concerned but a Panem on his territory as far as butter brown is concern where you have dominion over every creeping thing everything that creepeth upon the earth he's going back to Eden so the birds evils in the atmosphere and burn around getting his atmosphere and then there's a class of atmospheres which who have the power now who have the power now most fear versus atmosphere the bull in his atmosphere he's coming down that's the bull Simon I'm going around in his atmosphere he's atomic must fear he said well I don't mean to

believe that the Church of the Living God I want you to see it I believe the Church of the Living God has come out to Kennish Barnea I believe we had a judgment seat now just before crossing over let's not make that mistake that they made when they got it out over the elect out of each Drive men and send them over twelve spies ten of them come back same cannot be done we are just grasshoppers in their sight they see the world but this is a good idea when men go into the same land and then come back with an e report and to come up with a different port and all of them world 12 saw the same thing all twelve short irons all 12 saw creeps all all 12 all the land but then come back quickly and said we can't take it because em fellas real big ten fellows pump in some heavy ayah and the mustard if you see their muscles Caleb and Joshua however have nothing to do with the muscles and height and condition they I'm not doing that so when they came up to the cap always dramatize it they camp in a depressed mode called when people negative and noise community everybody chaotic a Catholic our humble church camp we can take it home come Karthik it cannot be shortest man get up box by

first and then fellas go along in a water high you know and then so let's take the best fit thanks men who believe and listen behind you they walking straight down shut down like I guess I guess everything is fine and once the foot hit Jordan River or an open up now watch this what is on solid underneath my pillow Jordan watching them just like yourself all right sometime God leave you to make that step you're weakened for what to do this and go to the death and go with it for you to make the movie you have to make I don't ill you make that move nothing opening up let me say that again because this is for somebody until you make that move nothing and open up everything is there you know to open up Anna but you ain't moving you with an anger you're prayin prayin and you're praying you're praying stopping up your own blessing because you're not chained up on what your seat into the knees if you are safe act upon it [Applause] come like a farmer he's breaking up big big harvest

come on oh you in charge of taking this word and let the nd let them be in charge of the real to bless the efforts that you make Oh Gloria got him in suburban said I don't care how great the opposition looks God will fulfill his word no less today listen there is something fixin to happen remember I told you that there is a step up coming for the church these things that you're now seeing are going to be just little things after a while something is moving and I say this by the power of the revelation of Jesus Christ and whom I everyone in our adoption in our baptism we have come to place but there is some key that will unlock something here now he saw the book see with seven seals daniel saw the same and when the seven thunders uttered their voices is it all right that was what was in the scripture it will be revealed elastic we at that time we are Kalish right now so he was saying that under smaller key to unlock something there oh my oh my hallelujah yeah a few nights ago I went about his foot over the Pataca Kentucky and where a bottle was at me I said it's just kept burning in my heart a message that I know that something God has promised on the open of of the power yet I am waiting off for him which I believe will appear to me visibly I see it with reverence I've seen him twice pause it was a vision he was standing in the air one night I stood I even broke a straw off the feet put in my mouth and chewed it look again I said sure it is another vision I stood there in the broom sedge looking I've been praying all night and I look again I seen him with his foot like that is unfolded looking towards the east I walk along this way and cleared my truth then he looking wrong at me raised on his arms and I fainted and didn't come till next morning and I have an idea what he looks like I've been feeling for the last few months that I will see him again and pretty soon he revealed something that's fixin to comfort or brother if I have it right God forgive me if I'm wrong but serious in the scripture seeing that when he rolls on a senator he received a new name no one know about it then I see him common in his power I went over don't know other bother me today let me alone and that night I in which I prayed I cried I called Billy I said what pray cause he give out and he called out 25 so but abandoned know something about a break for what what her feet does look he's looking for something he's like over something to happen listen to his approach I say what Prakash yeah you said call 25 all don't chew that line there was nothing that he could see that I looked at only a woman I was hard of hearing in one ear so I keep talking as a corner group and when I got to the other group the very first one in line a poor daddy leading his boy he said brother branham I come from Cincinnati I brought my boy over to Orange borrow brought him down my bus said I'll never could get a prayer card and get in the line I'm so happy to be here now I looked I said what's the matter with your boy he had his head dong-young fell about 18 he said when he was about eight years old he hit a dynamite clap with a hammer and it blowed his eye completely out it wasn't nothing but a socket on his eye the end of the cap pasted right into the site shattered every nerve and said ever since we have built about you we believe God would answer your prayer if you pray for my boy they just suck it's not the ice blown out since he's eat he's not eating so he's in that condition ten years standing there with her all Biddy Jackie no not dirty I don't mean to see that washed out they should open his underclothes here just a typical old daddy holding his boy so Reverend fine-looking young man stand in there as well come here brother let me pray for you I put my hands on him and said Heavenly Father I pray thee if thou will corner moonshee upon him and open his blinded eye when I asked it was too big in the auditorium had two big lights shining like this I said son look up that light and see if you can see the poor fellow look along this way trying to see the light in a dark corner I turn his head I said no up this way and I got his face too and a back way he said I'm sorry kind sir I can't see nothing his dad said brother branham if you want a powerful flashlight right in his eye he will never know it every nerve in his eye is boosted I said and you still have faith you know watch this but run prevail he sealed my father tell him if you put a shot in his eye he can see that and he still see your feet to believe let's continue no usually I would let the boy go see and said no son the Lord bless you may give you a sight but yeah what I had in my heart that's a different thing so normally you pray bless the people and go go do this I don't want that but because of something in his heart which connected to this pull this power this expectation this acting upon what you know God is about to unfold or break or reveal or manifest he is that not a lesson go no swatches so usually that says Lord bless you may give you your sight but dear what I had in my heart down there he said what he did to that tree could be that tree demands it from you if you shall see this mountain I said who ought to have feet if anybody or traffic a machine back yonder from a little baby the fullest thing I remember was God speaking to me in a vision don't really age you never feel one time when he met with me in the person of the angel he said I'll never fail you I'll never I'll be with you I thought who ought to have faith I ought to be ashamed so he is dealing with himself and he is challenging himself hallelujah are you with me I kept standing there I thought if this is true if God said I am the vine ye are the branches if BP in court then we are energized by a spirit then my hands are his hands so put around is going too much I don't know he has taken the scripture he has taken a whole of faith he is challenging himself a condition and said ten years demand blind he have no ideas either there or glory to God hallelujah I look at the boy again and I begin to feel something inside of me no friends I know it will work I've seen it in the other child when something would actually happen you can't Bluff it it's got to be there it's got to be the thing so this is not bluffing is this huh ah hallelujah then he just talked a little bit I remember the night the maniac walked in a platform in Portland Oregon many of you have read it he said cause the man will walk in a compact form in seen a hundred and two hundred forty pounds 7 foot tall walk to the platform five hundred preachers run back he spit in my face and say you hypocrite you receive love man you call yourself a man of God I break every bone in your miserable body tonight we just jump off the platform if you hear enough with your ears and you do have a spirit with them I'll break every bone but watch this and they scatter back and usually I would have done nor what to have done but when I turned to that man I know he was right there he turned to the man you know that my was defeated right there it's something inside of him there was something on the inside moved in and said don't fear I'm standing with you that was it when that happens I seen it in a tremendous time in a momentous minute and then I know what was going that that was going to be defeated and he taught back his fist I said because you have challenges Spirit of God tonight you will fall across my feet he said I show you whose feet I'll cross over you hypocrite and he spit in my face again his eyes poured out his teeth like that he Jewish Fister strike me as a Satan come out of him anywhere who and begin to run I wrong or wrong any pin my feet to the floor and the police had to take him off my feet what was it the power of Jesus Christ's presence standing there because he challenged the Spirit of the Living God Oh glory to God hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah praise God so you say what if that fate come at that time why can it stay all the time I went that boy standing there with his eyes blurred out like that I look at him and there's something I said Lord this is what I'm believing now there's a key note not to go in here I believe that God's gonna let me know it and then if that happened these in your scene would be so camacho up this side when that is fully revealed and then stand by there bad boy I said Lord God if I have found grace in your sight let it be known right now if I am right I pray that you will bless I turned to the boy and started crying I couldn't help it something on the inside of me pushing I can't help it so he prayed in to God help him help me okay then I put my hands over his eyes and said O God be merciful to him I know Satan you done this God never intended his boy to be blind never so I give this boy a sight in the name of Jesus Christ the Son of God I kill him in sight as corn syrup and my hands acting in his place and that is what I thought I should say and I said it and when I drop my hands down that boiler on a screen is it daddy I can't see [Applause] [Music] and he grabbed his daddy around the neck and got so excited and a Baptist preacher sat on a platform grab a chair over his head run to the audience puttin people as hard as they could by the chair turn over his head I got my own Hannity buddies always head unwanted all cattle people away Oh glory I'm so excited or chlorine o'clock but he rebuked the devil and give him his sight in the name of Jesus Christ right yeah oh what a key was turned right then he said this year we are on the verge brother somebody come back from kena the grips are good God give it to us we can take it God said so God said we had it is always be a limit last days we believe it in the last days I'll send on the rain in abundance both former and latter rain will fall in this day and what they had back there plus what God is going to give us do you understand what our for Molina lottery winners we're gonna have what they had plus just eight of the fighters plus [Applause] what did whatever I was sent to do to make me plenty messages no we read he shattered the hearts of the children back to the face of the fathers that's what you here for to become powerhouses with the faith think about you becoming opposed and your neighbors coming real appreciative and the Sikh community prefer them and people knocking on your door because I know courtesans in your prayer you are branch he is the main all the Muslim in the Holy Ghost they are saying Jesus is he finally I find true I am divine and you are divine to Jesus I preach that that was all this foolish doctrine always crazy false teaching you can find it in the script there's no way God the Father God the Son and God a berry gordy Father God the Son and God the spirit and it's pretty easy bread so cheer them up dating any go ahead you can find a scripted for that you can't find out nothing but people believe in all kind of nonsense like them tribulation scenes but this will be bright scenes that will be filled with the spirit which is the extra oil or glory that God are you with me these are less processing as hours push back every can write every parasite every Hittite every Jabba size all the other knights let's go and get the day weather rather could we continue it's been 32 years when the Lord Jesus within 150 yards away I'm suppressing standing Norman Jason's will at Eaton Penn Street the morning when I lead a cornerstone of this Hanako it's amazing I'm reading this right now and this is 23 years since we via corner store my tears season that I cut this to read today just be merely a swamp I live just across the way to my left it was before I was married I was live with my father and mother that the Lord Jesus woke me up in the morning that the cornerstone wants to be lead about early 6 o'clock I've been lying in bed for some time I was full of joy thinking of this great time that the Lord will gonna give me a tabernacle to preacher I was merely a young boy then the girl I was going with which was soon to be my wife the following year was to be with us the day we was to be the cornerstone I remember that morning when I wake up laying in a room upstairs right here on 7th Street something said rise up to your feet I got up saw it was a great place and a river run to a valley I got down there to the river I understood it was a place with John the Baptist at me about that so he's in a vision actually so you see in this year and then while I was there there was a voice spoke to me and took me up so he's going to next level now I noticed his Tabernacle just about his titties in right now and there was so many people till they were just packed all in in the Tabernacle in this condition about his teachers is no I was happy standing behind the pulpit saying God how good you are you ought to give me this top anarcho at that time the angel of the Lord speak to me and said but this is not your tabernacle I said then Lord where is my he take him up in the spirit again not 11 set me down in a grove we don't in a grove through a trees setting just level 20 feet or 30 and they looked like fruit trees and there were great big green pockets I noticed a my right hand until my left hand there was an empty bucket on either side I said what about these he said you were to plant in them so I pull a limb from the tree to my right places in the bucket to the right side I live on the left placing the Box in a left side quickly it grows all the way to the skies so always envision are you with me keep keep awake now follow me go at me he said holding hands and Canada to to food there of cigars they planted he pick a branch putting me in my pocket next bucket it grow up quickly he said put your hands got to the fruit okay hold your hands got a Luger of one hand fell a great yellow Apple mellow and right and the other hand fell a great ello plum mellow and right he said eat the fruit thereof because it is present and I ate from one and from the other very delicious you know the vision and just then I held my hands up was a shout in the glory of God all of a sudden that pillar of fire came down over the top of those trees and a roar lightning flash I'm the wind's blowing hard and the leaves began blowing on the trees and I looked way down there stood the shape of this Tabernacle the whitsett's know the end where the purple would be there were tree trees on those three trees taking shape of tree crosses and I noticed that both plums and apples were gathered in clusters around the middle cross so this this vision of trees no was transferred to tree crosses where he said the middle crosses where the fruits on both sides was gotta at that cross are you at me separately okay I ran really fast to the top of my voice and fell down upon this cross or by the cross do my arms around it and the wind's begin to shake and the fruit on the cross it fell all over me I was so happy and rejoicing he said eat the fruit thereof because it is pleasant and then this circling fire call Lord and said the harvest is right the labors of few he said no when you come to yourself again read 2nd Timothy 4 and then I came to myself I stood there rubbing my face and my hands then the corner of the room Sun shinin I must have been under the vision for an hour more it said 2nd Timothy 4 I reached quickly for my Bible second Timothy 4 now I wish to read that now I charge D before boarding the Lord Jesus Christ Jesus krypter who shall judge the quick and the dead and his appearing and his kingdom preach the word be instant in season other season reprove rebuke exhort with all long-suffering and doctrine for the time will come when they shall not and your song doctrine but shall after their own lust shall keep to themselves teachers having itching ears and they shall turn away their ears from the truth and shall turn to fables but watch thou in all things endure afflictions to the work of the evangelists make foot pull full proof of thy ministry did you notice that all I already that seems was sufficient because it was telling me to preach the word and your afflictions that the time will come that they will not endure sound doctrine but we'll turn to fables and then I want you to notice I want you to reference that that over in isaiah 61:1 and - it hasn't changed he's haven't stopped there and it was at night a second coming watch where the scripture said Jesus preach the acceptable year of the Lord the coming of judgment one of our deacons I

enemy of the law and the prophets that hold interpreted him as an enemy he denounced circumcision he denounced the laws and so forth and think that what we're going on it's not right so this one has an enemy and Paul saw people preaching the gospel some for contention some for argument some not sincerely but as he console himself Christ is being preached all glory to God acts 20:24 it is called the gospel of the grace of God it says here but none of these things move me neither come take my life dear unto myself so that I might finish my course with joy that the ministry which I have received the Lord Jesus to testify of the gospel of the grace of God Romans 1:16 is called the gospel of Christ he said for I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ for it is the power of God on the salvation Ephesians 1:13 called the gospel of salvation in whom you also trusted after you heard a word of truth the gospel of your salvation in whom after you believed you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise the gospel brings the captive out of prison the cocktail the gospel comes and free the prisoners isn't that right Oh glory to God hallelujah praise God almost done praise God Paul

another there is some that trouble you who would prefer the gospel of Christ and don't we on a heaven I say unto you if any man preach any other gospel unto you that what we have received let him be a kiss oh my 2nd Corinthians 13 says but I fear least by any means as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtlety so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ he call it equals but the simplicity that is in Christ and that's why we said the revelation of Jesus Christ is not my simplicity in the most illiterate person it is not know my how to explain it it is ruined by your revelation of Jesus Christ glory to God so the gospel watch the gospel common I believe is the Word of God that is true in one sense but the Word of God is not gospel alone the Word of God is a seed that produces the gospel or give the Lord a shout so the word is not a gospel the word by itself is not the gospel the word is the seed that produces the gospel when you're sowing seed you don't dig it up every morning there's even come to pass if you do your she will never come up you got to plant it and committed to the earth and let it come up alone or glory the endtime message and messenger should meet with intent conditions Oh glory to God you say look brother branham the gospel is the will of God not altogether brother the Bible said the gospel coming up they would only but to power and demonstration of the Holy Ghost I want any Minister challenge me on that this is the gospel the gospel is nothing but only that's what the Bible teaches so if they're not preaching with signs and wonders in the power of God it's not the gospel yet so don't fight me because this is what I'm fighting for this is what I'm pressing for or chlorine is why are you with me hallelujah hallelujah the Bible said that God will come to us nothing will only but to power and demonstration of the Holy Ghost the preacher wouldn't let her kill it but the spirit giveth life he said go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature then interpret it and back reforms go into the world demonstrate the power of the Holy Ghost so when he was in India a man come up here brain we're gonna look another Sun worshiping the Sun he said all who would give to Jesus Christ and caught the bandhas back this man his sight and God give back the man in sight and thousands give the heart to the Lord that is the gospel gospel of Jesus Christ he did not say teach the word he said preach the gospel so the customer consists yet but I charge more than teaching the word together on our show [Applause] [Music] that's why I want to challenge all this teacher let's place you I know if Angeles mine and it's all that kind of talk like a field evangelist is like you know maintain teacher position it please you for what you put in place for power the would have to push so when you begin to see some Aquila oh Jesus well punch so charged this morning didn't everybody knows this he goes back hallelujah my god I'm trying to finish it off but this thing going so good like my Grenada but I was it easy nice praise God so let's not do the gospel is not baloney it's the word made manifest the power and demonstration of the Holy Spirit bringing the word to pass so the cluster consists more than teaching the word for Paul confirming that said the gospel came to us not in word only but power under my vision so even Paul said his preached on teacher was not with enticing words but with the power of God that your faith my anchor not in me or my words but in the power of God Oh hallelujah the gospel is the power of God to meet the would act what it's say it will do preach the gospel all over preach the gospel to every white people wrong people yellow black every creature every creature you believe that I seen God baffle a bull one day I see them cause the Hornets not to sting I see there is a possum that be lame dead all night every creature I went that fish was there is a little fishy I give you back your life in the name of Jesus Christ and that fish turn up and just drag yo yo we have many creeds but there's one gospel or kiss a lot of shout many interpretations but there is one gospel the gospel came of him would only and if anything we have approached that not Scripture you are duty-bound to come tell us about it it must come from the Bible through the Bible it must cope with the rest of the scriptures and be right and if we are ready to say it's wrong then we are racist wrong and if I angel of heaven would preach anything that's not in the Bible to listen to it this is God's Word and quartz worse only we know it is true in order to preach the gospel neutrons come up please your toes I'm gonna finish my hallelujah song leader come to the side musicians from a please we are ready this is a beauty for me in order to preach the gospel before you make it across the bridge you have got to have the power and demonstration of the Holy Spirit to prove the gospel the letter killeth the spirit make it alive so it's not just a ritualistic affair but it is absolutely a real living reality of the resurrection of Jesus Christ living among men and that's the faith that I'm trying my best to contend for today that is Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and his power Europe is see unlimited talk unlimited yes again unlimited his power is unlimited if you can limit God you can limit Christ but if you limit the church to Danis possibilities your limits and God but all things whatsoever you desire when you pray believe you receive it and you shall have it and someone asks me it was the same man why did I associate myself with Pentecostal people no there's a reason I know there are many things and I think they ought to be straight not under some doctrine but my own opinion that I think they might I think I ought to do bidders I might think I ought to be sued too but there is one thing I've found in those people they have a living feet they have absolutely caught a hole or something God's got there and give them the new built and put Gordon to a person and that makes them believe in the supernatural so that is why I brother Branham was so delighted to as suited with a Pentecostal because they believe in the supernatural I feel the messengers come so natural no it's just words and more words and more preachers and more ministers and more explainers and more teachers and more whatever and nobody seemed to be crying and sign and groaning travailing Zion to bring forth Messiah Oh glory to God when Zion
