opening to understanding in the precious name of Jesus Christ and the church says amen greetings good morning or bless you I like to go straight to the word reading from three portions of scripture reading from Isaiah 55 reading from Romans 12 and reading from Philippians chapter 2 thank you musicians reading Isaiah 55 reading verse 6 Isaiah 55 and verse 6 seek ye the Lord while he may be found call ye upon him while he is near let the wicked forsake his way and the unrighteous man his thoughts and let him return unto the Lord and He will have mercy upon him and to our God for he will abundantly pardon for my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are your ways my ways saith the Lord for as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts I reading Romans 12 and reading verse 2 and bina conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God and our last reading from the book of Philippians chapter 2 and reading from verse 5 let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the cross wherefore God also had highly exalted him and given him a name which is above every other name that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow of things in heaven and the things in the earth and things under the earth and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father wherefore my beloved as he have always obeyed not as in my presence only but now much more in my absence work out your own salvation with fear and trembling for it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure do all things without murmurings and disputing that he may be blameless and harmless the sons of God without rebuke in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation among whom II shine as lights in the world holding forth the word of life that I may rejoice in the day of Christ that I have not run in vain neither labored in vain yay and if I be offered upon the sacrifice and service of your feet I joy and rejoice with you all for the same cause also do a joy and rejoice with me may the Lord and a blessing to the reading of his a man can we give the Lord a hand appraised you may be seated this morning [Applause] so I have a title this morning the eternal thoughts of God and for a subject the mind of Christ and as an inspiration thinking his thoughts thinking his thoughts and but randomly spoke many times about a word is a thought expressed so in order for a word to be spoken it first had to exist as a thought for you to act a certain way your body responds to instructions its comforts as a thought what exists today at one time before it existed in the material form whatever existed as a thought the tallest building in the world before it was built and before the raw materials were gathered and before there was a drawing that went to approval it meant somebody would have had a thought in their mind of what they wanted to see there can the church say man before this pulpit could have been built somebody had to have a thought of what this pulpit would look like unless it was a thought it could never come into material and unless what you say was a thought you could have never had it in the first place can the church say man are you with me this morning so we're trying to get some we're trying to lay a foundation this morning so the biggest building in the world everything that's created the cars we drive today the cell phones we have in our hands it existed as a heart before it became a reality somebody had a thought a vision I've seen a possibility and we could pick up something and call somebody with it and it was a thought before it became word let's make a plan before it became action and that principle is a principle that actually comes from God because we are created in the image of God that seemed formula what sauce just as it works for God can the church see man so I asked you a question this morning if man can have a thought and that thought could be I want to build this so I want to make a dresser and it's enough for to have a vision to address I want to make or whatever whatever you see around us that's in the natural is the product of man's thinking everybody with me it is the product of man's thinking but when you look at the trees and you look at the Stars and you look at the mountains and you look at the way the Stars and the mountains work together what kind of mind would it take if natural manner to create inventions now they have you may be seated now they have those those things those cameras that float in the air with what he called lived rooms man could have a vision somebody thought about it one day I wanna put a camera in something I went over and I saw the latest one you can put your hands in front of it and when you do this it moves around that's man's creativity and that person of man thoughts so what kind of mind would it take to be able to put man the way he is what kind of mind would it take to know when the Sun should go up and when the Sun should come down what kind of mind would it take to know when the moon has to do what it has to do what kind of man would it take and the church Sam and amber the Panem said that you cannot even be here unless you existed in the thoughts of God because you are a very expression of the thoughts of God God existed but the Branham said before he could even be called God he was all thoughts he was just a bunch of thoughts and in those thoughts were the Branham said the world is an attribute of his Porter because before the world existed he was thinking about it before the Sun existed he was thinking about it up before the moon existed he was thinking about it before the posix he said he was thinking about it before the elephant existed he was thinking about it before the horses existed he was thinking about it before this country existed he was thinking about it before you existed he was thinking about you because he thought about you you are the expression of his thoughts hallelujah oh my you may be seen it I wonder Stovall back before there was a moon and go back before there was a star called back before there was a bill go back before there was a problem let's go back before there was a mortgage let's go back before they were sickness let's go back before there was tiredness because everything have to exist as a boat before it can be expressed [Applause] you didn't see that so before the devil could touch you or it never can accuse you he has to understand the original thought and that is what the devil cannot understand because he cannot tap into the mind of Christ access to the mind of God is reserved a select few only a select few good access the mind of God God's - so fast he can't open that mind to any and anybody because everybody can't handle it but when God opens his mind up and begins to express his thoughts so that is anybody in the house morning he may be seated for a minute in order for a prophet to speak he has to have the mind of God because at any other way it will be his own thoughts let me say that again in order for a prophet to speak he must have access to the mind of God to the intelligence of God and the other way it will mediate is his thoughts being spoken so when a prophet speaks who is doing the thinking because if Isaiah was using his thinking he could never see a pleasure shall conceive because the mind of man and not figure that out oh come on somebody reach back to me and when our prophet is gonna be a bride we're gonna act like they were gonna make him but something has kept you something holds you Oh somebody beats back to me this sorts the expression of his thoughts God existed not even called God because by definition God means objects of worship but there was nobody to worship him but the kindly all he was was thoughts he thought about nature he thought about animal life he thought about hand lights he thought about a family and I belong to have a family he thought about his own legacy he thought about Rep reducing himself he thought about of people smiling he's other people victorious he thought about everything he thought about how ungrateful his people would be it I didn't have a mountain and a valley to understand the difference between the mountains and the valleys he ran it through his mind and he thought about all the possibilities up and he knew bless you too much you might forget about him so he wants to bless you just enough mercy he thought about it he thought about the wife you would have an undetermined you would have a and if you will give you children he thought about it all because he was thinking he was just existing with his suck and when he was done he said it is good you never seen it how could you say that brother let me read a quote from you from the exposition of the church it is the Smyrna churches everybody awake this morning everybody here this morning but Abraham said the eternal thoughts of God let me ask you are the thoughts of God you know he said if you can see this you will see many things God is unchangeable in both SS and behavior we have studied that and proven that already God is infinite in his abilities so therefore he as God must be omniscient and if he is omniscient listen to the Prophet then he is not no learning so God is not now learning nor is he at any time adding to his knowledge so God already knows everything about you what you go into is not new information because he cannot add to his knowledge is not learning so your mistakes your failures he already saw all of that and still wrote your name in blood still wrote it still wrote that devil you can 'take my limit he is omniscient he is omnipresent he is all-powerful yes you may be seated this should shake some money I don't care if you've been back sleeping for 30 years what is it the first time you're ever in church God is not adding to his knowledge nor is he now learning listen to the Prophet nor listen is he taking counsel even with himself that's the prophets work so when the Catholic God is not taking counsel by the man himself even with himself you know what counsel with yourself is a one day for doing the right thing that's coming so with yourself that's when you're second-guessing yourself I wonder if I Heidi right bread I wonder if that's what you really want to make that is console with yourself and then you have to answer back answer because nobody else is there yeah I feel this is your right one you know in some circles they defined others we'll leave that alone but with the practice that God has not even taken counsel with his own self you know I was he is so positively confident that he made the right decision there is no turning back the Holy Ghost released in your destination there is no turning somebody happened we just morning maybe see it for a minute but the pranam said if that's what I said there is no surprise to God there's no oops hey I didn't see that coming that doesn't exist he's omniscient listen to the prophet that's a the people don't know the messenger if listening a prophet if he can add to his knowledge then he is not omniscient the best we could say is that sometime he will be but that is not scriptural he is omniscient he has never had a new thought about anything because all his thoughts he always had and always will have and knows the end from the beginning because He is God that's the thoughts of God are eternal this is the property are real they are not simply like a man with a blueprint he has drawn which one name will be translated into substance and form but they are already real so a few minutes ago we spoke about the man with a vision or the thought of obscure scraper it's in his mind and support and that thought has to be expressed but the Prophet said the eternal thoughts of God are so powerful what is in his mind is as if it is already expressed it doesn't have to be built-in or you don't hear me this morning so in his mind you have the holy cause in his mind you are adopted in his mind she protected in his mind you are more than a conqueror because his thoughts are eternal the devil cannot stop it [Applause] I'm not gonna be too long with you this morning we have two services today and the pastor will speak tonight I mean I just brought you a little bit probe you a little bit everything we do is a product of our thinking the time we wake up in the morning is a product of our thinking what we eat is the product of our thinking how we feel is the product of our thinking when you say I feel the press is an expression of the thought that already exists so even if you express it or not the fact that the thought exists already defines how you feel in the morning Subic you're already thinking it know one of the purposes as a man thinketh in his heart so if you wanna change your words you must change your thinking if you wanna change your behavior you must change your thinking that's why I read the scripture be transformed by the renewing of your mind [Applause] they say the mine is a terrible thing to waste they said it to school it is also true in the spiritual because if you shall fear this mountain it must exist in your thoughts before you can speak so before they can be spoken word it has to come back to the mind of Christ to know what you once done with the word or you don't hear me this morning are we in the message [Applause] so the spoken word is the original seed where the kangaroo but the genetic structure of that original seed is the thought of God because the thing is once the word is expressed for this even there's nothing to take it back if the thought means it's inactive but once the thought becomes expressed my words cannot return void but if it has a purpose it has a destination as an objective it has a timing so that's why the devil doesn't want you to speak he doesn't want you to worship he doesn't want you to show because what are you doing you are actually exercising the muscles that you have to use in the future to command the elements and command your situation whatever the random said if you right now we lay hands on the sick it was not so from the beginning when that time comes you a commanded Apple because we have to be able to sleep [Applause] you've ever seen it wasn't a prophecy they will have thus saith the Lord or they will keep still in other words their thinking will no longer exist to direct them they will only do his will Oh what type of thinking is that you may be seated but in the Bible say the Apostles taught nor thought of what they were going to save but if a word is a thought express who is thinking if the Apostles were not thinking and they were speaking it meant a higher intelligence than their intelligence it means a higher mind that their mind what kind of mind could discern the thoughts and intents of the heart that was that the mind of the Prophet that was the mind of Christ that was the son of man really is son of man oh can the church [Applause] and so many times the conflicts exists and that scripture have me read I just want to touch it and then come back to it where we read seeking the Lord while he may be found have it written my notes here but seem to have lost my place but that scripture is not a scripted to create a divide for my thoughts are higher than your thoughts my ways higher than your ways that scripture is a statement of fact that is a gap because the scripture will read if the minor was in Christ being you so in other words we exist right now where his thoughts are higher than our thoughts and his ways I had but what happens in his mind becomes your mind what happens when his ways become your ways what happens when you are thinking that's what thinking is can read a quote from the prophets hallelujah my mind this is when the Holy Ghost is driving I have the notes but he has just restructured our message the world the world becoming flesh but the banner said but if it becomes a real revelation of God that you see it before it happened and express it in a Word form that word takes a wall and becomes material of what express your heart and your mind is so filled with God's Spirit until your thoughts become his thoughts he says there you are when your mind and your leaning and your guiding becomes a direct lease or a direct inspiration of the Holy Spirit that's moving your motor being he goes further what kind of people should we be if the very Holy Spirit has you saw embody or empowered listen that you don't use your own thoughts you don't use your own mind you don't use your own opinions but the Holy Spirit has you so built until your thoughts and your P is God's Spirit expressing yourself through you what kind of church what we eat what kind of people would it be this morning and by the Panama streaming out he said if this Branum tabernacle and I see this morning if this headstone tabernacle this morning was so filled with the presence of God why when he didn't even use your own mind didn't even use your own thoughts didn't have no ultimately of your own but just to be led by listen the Prophet goes on and then our sons of God are led by the Spirit of God then when the human element goes out that's what we have been missing for all these years the human element has been too evident people listening and a message and this human element I don't think I don't think it should be like that I don't feel listen even even the scripture believers how this has nothing to with your feelings but to believe that belief itself is a product of a Vicki [Applause] so your mind has to change because even when the brand Umbridge approach the god approach the god is about your thinking that's why the Prophet said the right mental attitude oh you know ya me this morning towards any divine promise of God it's what brings it to pass it doesn't change here is what she's nowhere I wanna go on I that I wanna go on a dad I wanna go on a dad you might have change it is a song but when your mind is made up that woman with the issue of blood she didn't have the Holy Ghost but her mind was made up if I could just touch the hem of His garment nobody was changing of mind and when you reach a spot in your Christian journey there nobody to change your mind about the issue then the devil is finished [Applause] howdy panda branham's ticket he's then fully persuaded before they convince he may receive it so the word comes to you and the word strengthens your mental feet on the first level the first level of feet and even within mental feet but the random call it didn't see fit so even feed has a spectrum did you feed by the banner causing the lowest form of it you see it based on just your logical reasoning like the lepers if we sit here we die if we call there we might die might some better than dices better I'll call lowest level of it for some of us that might be just what we need right now if I stay in my situation at a time but if I worship maybe there's a possibility listen Albert Einstein the Prophet referred to him over 30 times in preaching Albert and they said if you try to approach the same problem with the same thinking you have the same result so if you have been walking this Christian journey and you have expired or results meaning you have a retina button all the results as you cut the swath to get more it needs a higher level of thinking because what is expressed by your life is defined by your thinking let me give you a natural example you may be seated if you are a strong Mason and you only know how to put the concrete to build a straight wall that's all you know that's your thinking there is nothing anybody can tell you about turning a corner because you are limited by your thinking you are limited by your knowledge in order of you to tell in a corner or even the curved wall it takes a higher level of thinking it may be training it may be going to school it may be an apprenticeship and maybe somebody have to show you what it is but until your thinking changes you can start at me and say okay it's not it is not you could speak what you want to speak turn curve Bend until your thinking could appreciate what is required knowledge could speak now you can act now you could do so when you come to church and what is the Bible what is the Bible the Bible is the expression of God's thoughts as we walk in this journey what we are trying to do is replace our thinking when he is thinking and he has already expressed how he feels about everything read the Bible how God feels and things about everything is expressed in children obey appearance this look that is this that's God's thoughts on the matter honor your father and mother that's God's thoughts on the matter if you can't live that it's not his thinking needs to change it it's it's your thinking that needs to change husbands love your wives that's that's God's thoughts on the matter wives reverence your husband that's good thoughts on the matter that's what the Bible is is the expression of God's thoughts on every matter can the church save the church let's continue reading and there are sons of God are led by the Spirit of God and when the human element goes out and the Spirit of God fills that vacancy where you empty yourself then will be when the church in its power of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus will walk in his steps in his power in his thoughts in his being in his moving then your thoughts will become words and the words will become a - yo that's when the church in its power and I believe it's on the road that's when the trip will be so wrapped in Christ the Holy Spirit mankind saw away from their self that they don't see themselves they don't have no but to serve God and therefore move on they refuse the things of the world they just move in the spirit live in the spirit move in the spirit walk in the spirit so fulfill the law of Christ then the love of Christ in the human heart moving in the Holy Ghost that great wonderful church will go forth with power and deity because deity will be revealing you beings by the Holy Spirit bring it to pass the part of their mind listen to the prophet let me sing it again because deity God Himself will be revealing human beings by the Holy Spirit bringing to pass the thought of their minor Oh [Applause] somebody give God shut up great by the madam said our thoughts run different a lot of times listen to the Prophet we walk let me see how you do brother and you don't mean it in your heart a lot of times we say I am this and that'll do that you don't mean it in a heart see I don't mean it in my heart but when you can become so dead to the things of the crisis crisis all then your entire makeup is up the Spirit of the Lord Jesus Christ yes full control then your thoughts will be clean your pores will be pure your heart your heart can the church give the Lord a shout of praise [Applause] so where's PETA money internal thoughts of God the mind of Christ and thinking his sports and many times we read and receive him the Bible and we see that a man has his own thoughts and God has another thought the woman at the well man had their thoughts about her they saw as a woman that was with a bunch of different men and she would have to go at the time and nobody else was going because she was she was not welcome in the regular gatherings and that was the thought of man but when Jesus had needs pacified marriage his thoughts was different about that woman than what man's thoughts were and if we wanna kneel down this morning young people and church at large it's the eternal thoughts of God that matter to us what man things about us does not matter it is not important all I want to know is the thoughts of God concerning the issue and the church cement you may be seated Saul who became the Apostle Paul he had a hard time because when he was persecuting the church he thought he was doing the right thing he was going based on the law as he understood it haven't been trained by the very best can the church say Amen so it was very confusing to him these followers of Jesus but when Jesus knocked him off his horse and interrupted his experience and his testimony and changes his nature and his name when this sword became poor shut up in church the Bible said church folk didn't like him turn around increase your brother and people avoided brother Paul because he was the one who had persecuted the Christians man had his own thoughts on the issue but that was cause apostle he was not there with Jesus and he was the one to street without a pizza these Gentiles not your responsibility I'll take care of the issues over there you can make the 10,000 the Jews this gospel that is to you and for them also to save holy loves that's where you is for them also that was close apostle didn't matter what is said to Paul didn't matter what is said about him he knew either from God he had a revelation from God now the Bible said the church is built upon a revelation know what revelation it's the revelation it's someone else revealed to you isn't that right reveal from where from the mind of God in other words for you to have a revelation it means a part of God's thinking must connect with you and your you find your whole world changes because you never saw it that way you didn't realize this joy could be so good they are updates and their tone is but some to the water oh good God Almighty it's a revelation that comes from God and it keeps you alive it wakes you up in the morning it's tells you at night you can help yourself because God has revealed himself to you it's not the pastor it's not the bishop it's not the preacher what is God himself [Music] be seated to the problem in the church the problem in the world is the difference in God's thinking from our way of thinking when to dispel the good brothers who had walked with Jesus talked with Jesus they were men taught by Jesus he said let's find a proper and they cast lots the aterna brother who's a good brother he was an anointed brother he was a solid brother he was brother with tires he was nothing wrong with Matthias but that was man's thoughts God had a different thinking he had somebody who didn't grow up in your circle somebody who didn't eat or when you ate it yes somebody else in mind that was God's thoughts and you know what when the world looks at who they think is righteous and who's gonna make it that's still man's thoughts God has his thoughts about you that's why I've said so many times the Prophet said when you get over there there'll be people there who you never thought would make it because that would be your thinking but in his thoughts he wrote their names in blood and nothing could take it out somebody get gonna shut up ray who may be seated just want to slow down a little bit buckle get seats it God has his thoughts and man has his thoughts that issue of thinking you could go straight back to the book of Genesis after man fell Abel and Cain board had to bring their sacrifice you have to think about what you're gonna do because every action every word every behavior starts from the thought revelation impacts your thinking if you don't have that ability to think to process to analyze me just be animals are you with me Paul speaks about it as the war of the flesh and I'd walk the flesh when he speaks in the world of the flesh is speaking about that be son nature that animal nature and he goes on to describe the effects of that sexual immorality and he goes down the whole list of an enemy and strife and rebellion and he speaks of all all of that but we're going to be higher so man has his thinking and God has his thinking so either by revelation because the mind of God would have dropped down to show him something he couldn't come up with this by himself it's against our very nature it's against our nature at birth to be spiritual because we are born in sin and shipped in iniquity so it has to take something the mind from our baser nature to a higher level of making some in the transformer some animals release it into spiritual creatures a transformation as a take place to not be like everybody else because this is animals sleeping whatever they want on the road so when you see men running around women water running right that's the best animal piece of nature but when your mind is transformed and you have an experience with God and you are born again then your thinking begins to get closer to his thinking until one day we have promised gonna be perfect husband and wife think in the same way oh you don't hear me - Ronnie so when they heard about sacrifice Abel and his way in went his way and Portman whatever they did they came back with the expressions of the thoughts that was being expressed made on the revelations that can impose on all of 1/2 and no he meant every good effort it was gonna have hearted effort he made a genuine effort and he brought fruits that was the product of his thinking but Abel brought blood he took a lemon slay that lemon God was so happy because that was his son thinking his thoughts that many many years after the real life would come up Beasley who would have put that in email it had to have access to the mind of God [Applause] now listen predestination gives you access to the mind of God because if you are not predestinated if you're not the attribute seed of God you can never come into access with the mind of God so your lordship on your praise is not based on how you feel and what you went through your childhood and things worked out great this week so you feel like something more this week than last week it has all to do that you have seen sleeping what God has shown you he has given your access to his intelligence that no weapon formed against you can prosper that has to shift from Scripture that the thought it has to become your thought so it can become your world you may be seated I mean kneeling down I'm teaching a little bit when you see scripture scripture has to be applied in relevance so the scripture was there sitting all along but when Jesus came and read it by definition he should have done what every other young brother had done go back to his seat but when he said this day the Scriptures fulfilled he brought the present and applied it to his life by revelation nobody had done that nobody was authorized to do that before but because he was the very mind of God expressed he could rip open the scrolls and find the substance of what was written there and listen it was no longer catch this may be seen it very important it was no longer the words of the book it had not become his words he was saying the Spirit of the Lord is upon me so he anointed me it was now his lip Chuck that's why he can have the authority to save this day this scripture is fulfilled because this scripture is me when God thought about it he was talking about me when the prophets spoke he was making it to me [Applause] you may be seated you see Catholicism has done a number on Christendom of Christianity as a whole that scriptures at ease catchphrases every day I read Emma Sam's alone but that's not your scriptures until the thoughts that wrote the sounds become your thoughts and you can speak those words because they're your thoughts expressed then it's not your scripture let me say that again this breaks all the religious spirits in the message it means the message is not just your message until the thought behind a message from the mind of Christ becomes your thinking you can record all the every day it will never be your quotes until the intelligence of God drops down and you're thinking because his thinking that when you speak it becomes as worse no wonder the Apostles to take no thought of what he said because they were faking his thoughts oh oh somebody say man I'm not done yet he's still warming up because we went to break our human thinking service long you weren't thinking service short you might thinking show me any middle human thinking but all of it should be preaching you might thinking the other Anthony supposing preaching you might thinking but I shouldn't be preaching human thinking but I should pitch again human thinking but it Stephenson pre-sex human thinking who's gonna lead songs human thinking what times never gonna start human thinking Oh what shall should I go to human thinking until God's please see you it's human thinking how many intelligent shrubs town North devil could move you because the revelation is that this young man what is this and God told me God spoke to me you may be seated maybe see it that's why better always had many timeouts we can i has to Tabernacle here I'm at home many time pray time a revelation to be in this church because you have to have a revelation I saw a court recently people asked if you need the Holy Ghost to make the rapture and his response was you need a Holy Ghost to go to the supermarket not even heard the regulars was the Whoopie to wake up in the morning to step on your house near the Holy Ghost everybody with me do you need to pray and talk to God so he could give you his spot on the matter Lord I have my thought for what are your thoughts Jesus himself had to do they say Lord not my will oh but I will be done give me your thoughts father Oh to think what God things you see when it when you're thinking changes can we preach can we take some time this way you're thinking affects your senses so I can walk down the road and I see somebody take the speaker from of the pole and so we get asked me who took it describe him well there was a man he was he was what five feet he wear a red shirt that's the product of my thinking but if a police officer happened to witnesses and you asked him the same question his response is different who took it he said slight build mark on his head his shoes has this it should has this why because his thinking he has been trained in his thinking to see more than what you can see it's always amazes me when a master of their art walk into a master Paynter bill or whatever they walk in that is two inches off there are musicians who can walk in the room and say hey yes yeah fourth string on the guitar needs a tightener because his thinking is different I with me they are people who could watch your body language and they teach you that when you doing presentations a look at body like when people fooled hand like this it means they are building a barrier and they're unconsciously resistant what you're saying and I see people's I need to make sure they buddy now they are scientists who have studied facial behavior to see when the actual person you look up unicorn on your left it's mean you're creating an idea lion that is not in your nature to lie so your body exposes you [Applause] [Music] and their men who are trained trained to spot those things so you spitted on Monday and they and they're reading you and sales they teach you in sales if you're selling mimic the way the person is in front of you said if they lean forward lean forward if the lean backward lean backward honest and if man in his natural thinking to do this what about the higher intelligence of Troy the discern the thoughts and intents of your heart but the Brandon said he will go into the mountains to get away from the people because he was tired of the hypocrisy in the church god bless you brother and what they sing in their heart what you're thinking it's a whole different thing so our thinking has to die always have to die our feelings have to die and God is a specialist at creating situations to break your thinking what one see here you see I've given up I'm confused I'm fed up because you have tried your way and when you have exhausted all of your options no you can be ready ready to try this way but young people I warn you in the name of the Lord don't make the mistakes that others have made you could take the world to heart and live this would I don't care who did what there's no excuses they have no exceptions we read the quote God is not now learning not taking counsel with himself he doesn't change his mind I don't care how society changes does not change choruses I am God and I changed I don't care how Hollywood portrays it fornication is still sin oh you don't hear me this morning people have their own interpretations they take the Bible to mean what and that's why I said the reveal word is the present tense you decide to bring some notebooks the present tense of mine of Christ on the word for the hour because when me the Branham is speaking it's the intelligence speaking addressing the situation's take him the word that's to rip the word because everything has to be in there so where the planner was opening and connecting the loose ends but he couldn't add or take away from there oh my somebody say man everybody feeling fine could we take someone sweet oh my god thinking and man's thinking Gideon the mighty man of Valor God's thinking Gideon thinking who me I'm from the smallest tribe he brings on his resume in the tribe my family is the smallest family in the whole tribe and to get specific I and the smallest in my family that was Gideon's thinking but God has a different thinking about him look at Moses the Bible tells us most of us trained in everything the Egyptians had he was changing their science and their philosophy in their religion in their beliefs he was trained in every area of it but when he caught that he was none of them his thinking the result of all of this training was kill one man and run for his life that was his graduation reward kill one man run for your life after all of the training but when he met the pillar of fire when you met her burning bush his thinking was changed the mind of God dropped down to show him how to deliver his people who shall I say send me I am that I am he cut a snapshot into the mind of God I am whatever you need I am your joy peace I am your comfort I am your deliverer and Moses he was it was not a different man it was a change man the same Moses but he had a different mind he had a different thinking he had a different hope you saw the possibility he had had an experience so whereas he had run his life running from danger now he was walking to danger because his mind was made up because he had met a pair of fire and that's what the church needs is to meet the pillar of fire [Applause] look at Joshua Joshua knew that his intelligence what's not good enough he's thinking what's not good enough his thought process what's not good enough so you went aside away from everybody else while he's meditating he's sharpening his sword because he knows no matter what he has got to be ready but he's really trying to find a way because he know yes to go poety he cannot go back he he can't stay where he is he has to find a way and God knew his thinking was sunny now God knows when your thinking is not enough God knows when you ran out of options God knows when and while Joshua was in his place he hears the noise and he he just does what comes natural to him he swings his sword are you for us are you against us I'm in a warrior mood I'm I'm I'm in a mood to kill the enemy so make your make your position known very clear very fast because because I'm here to kill Devils I'm Heather so push the devil back I'm either send demons where it come from [Applause] and the voice said Joshua holy and the captain of the Xhosa I know you're looking for the right approach when I come out to tell you just how to do it I've already thought about a victory I've already thought about how you're gonna win the battle and got him now to do what give Joshua his I can imagine Joshua walking back out of the tactus back to the candle lit fire that is normally surrounding his tent with the elders waited to hear from him this is not the Joshua who was just sharpening his soul this is now Joshua with God's thinking he had heard from God he knew God's thoughts on the matter there's nothing like knowing what is about to happen how it's about to play out where the enemy is gonna fall I could imagine Josh was joy telling the people don't get excited take it easy I've heard from the Lord I know what he's thinking I have his foots on the first day you're gonna go around once why just worry about it just trust I have this thinking on the second able to go around another time why trust what don't worry about it God already thought about it on the third day under 40 unaffected but on the seventh day God has a different plan walk around seven times you have to break the routine a little bit but seven days the six things you've been doing the same there but when the seventh day comes when the seven each comes with a pretty routine move it begins i Adam like all the years all the teams we had before don't try to figure it out are we gonna connect to what happened on the first day what happened on the second day Joshua was living on the mystery of the ages I didn't even know it but he was in God's pinky you didn't see what woke you up this morning and truly you had to come to the house of God that wasn't your thinking the Bible says no man could come unless the father draws his thoughts being Express here this morning that's why you are here and God will continue to increase the heat in your life it's a marvel to me when you read a course over the bottom said how few wouldn't be in the rapture and the deeper I go I realize the few and the filtering process to the rapture is about people want you to hold on to themselves that's the problem people the whole lawn because when I ran towards the devil is religious here the devil this morning the devil this morning is not in a party the devil is in churches this morning and you know what the Bible says he never believes what he never says amen and tremors there people in church this morning here not even trembling but the devil believes he's religious he's aa religious being he was of the class of the angels whose primary responsibility is is to worship that's his pedigree that's his class so we can expect nothing less from them and when the Brennan said as we come to the end - spirits working in the framework of the church will be so close that it was deceive the very elect if it were possible but the random out I mean I get it but when I said there are 22 thinking's he calls not the two influences because influences on your mind because the war is for your mind the mind was the agreed battleground but the banner get the story of the Hall in German I believe it was who they asked him how does he how does he protect us or when the rooster comes or whatever the bird come he says well I sue this one I let this one land and I shoot this one make the point that you can't stop the thoughts come into your mind but the Branham said many times he said the issue is not being tempted because the mind is the place to be tempted it's what you do when the temptation comes the mind is the agreed battleground so what are you talking about I see a woman is treated that is the temptation but you know what but the Branham said the Christian turns his head God is not going to position only naked women on a certain Street a certain time to mix earlier when you pass the night there so if that is your prayer change that one the devil has to do what he will do but as a Christian because his thinking he is holy his thinking is holy he is righteous his thinking is righteous he is perfect his thinking is perfect but as we get closer to him I was thinking because I get more like he is thinking more like his thinking more like his thinking until after live in advance and when the Holy Ghost comes in you are thinking and his thinking begins to get so in sync that your nature your appetite after while you don't even see the woman anymore it doesn't even beat on your head they don't even exist to you anymore because it's dead - you're thinking it's dead to your nature you are creature of eternity [Music] [Applause] God told Joshua meditate on the word day and night so you will have good success when you meditate on anything day and night it affects your thinking study the world anybody in any group or or study or whatever it is they say repeat repeat say it over say it over until after a while but a parent did the same thing the man came he prayed for him he didn't get healed he said go and repeat every day by stripes I'm healed by stripes I'm healed by stripes I'm here my stripes I'm healed by sharks I travel he's Express Express you read all about it by stripes on here until one day it's change from wood into mentally I'm Metta feel connected because God already healed him but he had to believe it go to the Prophet if you can get the people who believe not even cancer was standing for you I know the crazy thing is people believe you where a man he would believe the Prime Minister people really eat the president people leave me a schoolteacher and when I was in Stanford five I came home I say that's the way that said X Y & Z and my daughters are my boys no sir but sir said I believed in myself I teacher if you told me anything that my son if a teacher did not agree with you was in trouble because I believed he had such an impact on my thinking that I believed everything he said it took me the stars was killing about strengthening us I was so sad he's tired I connected by a string to the earth but when we come to the house of God and the word has reached us it is sweet to have an influence on thinking for us to begin to see a things that defy logic [Music] [Applause] try to logically explain if you shall say to this mountain be moved and you can explain it anyway how can you explain it somebody and God said let there be light and there was light that can be logic so there has to be something comes over you to open up your mind and your heart to see the fact that what exists is exists from what is not seen that the doctor can see something about you but from a place that the doctors cannot see there's power to influence what you see then the Prophet can be away from his wife and he can speak before the doctors hand touches my wife the tumor will go down can imagine how the doctor felt but that's how the mind of God is kind of sure it's a man could he take someone for evil it took the mind of Christ because the prophesy the prophesy you need the mind of Christ because the prophesy means to tell something on the inspiration or to foretell by the man is about to take place so if you are foretelling or inspired it's not the mind of Christ then what's influencing you so David was on the inspiration it would have been the mind of Christ Fame the drop drop down upon him so he could prophesy I'll chop your head off especially when David didn't ever saw it it's one thing if David had a sword and we can ask you beaut the statement to him but the fact that David had no sword meant he was reaching somewhere else to pull the faith to speak this amateur say man so I'm not gonna be too much longer when I hope this helps you repentance real repentance we talked about its sealing away from you get it here all right to turn away from but really penance also beans or really means to turn away from your own thoughts and ways and think God's thoughts that's what real repentance is and we know the Bible we said it before is what an earless town is the expression of the thoughts of God the mind of Christ there's a difference in the way core things underway be things it's a difference in his ways and our ways the progress we try to bring core down to our thinking we try to bring him down to always and God goes further to clarify this did this difference between his thoughts or thoughts his ways always and says if you want to measure the distance is that the heavens are higher than it that's how high his thoughts are from our thoughts I'll do some research on that distance I ran into some technical difficulties on Google so the change your words I'm not gonna be too much longer you must change your thinking the teens your actions you must change your thinking to change your behavior you must change your thinking to change your prayer life you must change your thinking this thing about thinking change is probably because a lot of people they come to church and they're waiting for God to do something for them and while it has its place there's a lot that God has already given you that your thinking needs to change to understand the power that you already have so the Bible says stuff like if my people will humble themselves on pray seek my face turn from their wicked ways they will hear from heaven and I will heal their land that's the Bible and people are praying and turning it from their wicked ways and see we're waiting for the dynamic what dynamics are you waiting for when you have mechanic you have not operated yet because the dynamics comes to operate what you let me say this again this spirit comes to bring to light what you cannot do in your own strength you could do that last thing you can do that arm at the church on time you mean to tell me you need that now makes the comatose on time [Applause] Jesus praying you say forgive those who trespass against us is sweet forgive us our trespasses as we think you mean to tell me that you can't forgive that's that's on you that's on you you have to figure it out work out your salvation we read it with fear and trembling yeah because not gonna be easy and tourmaline because trust me it's not easy but you have to work it out Oh somebody say Amen to change your approach to God your thinking must change from the Lord give me give me give me the Lord I'm here to serve you Lord I bring a sacrifice your fridge we bring a sacrifice if we read a book of sounds you're thinking I was hearing a prophet say a few days ago but the Branham was repenting he was repenting for not bringing enough souls to the kingdom and he asks a question to the church she said how many souls have you brought to Christ since you have met Jesus and he had an altar call for people who have never witnessed to anybody our thinking has to change because we talk about God it's something to us and you don't want to tell anybody to deal with greater challenges that will come our way our thinking must change but the Branham said what we need today is a good old-fashioned all-time scene pause revival and the Bible holy goes back into the church again education will never do it I'm not talking about education I'm talking my total surrender toward the word says I'm not this ala carte or buffet approach well I want this today and I already want this this weekend but the round said how do you grow every day you said read the Bible and pray every day that's ABC's ABCs you can't deal with the algebra if you can't pass the ABC class I'm gonna has no skipping classes and dropping a head he says he has no grandchildren it's just sons and daughters and if Jesus had to learn obedience by the things that he suffered what's your Excuse God will take you through whatever trial you will pull up your life and that's an algebra because in algebra he said an adoption he's telling your wife against you he turn your husband against you he turned the church against you he'll try you he'll test you because his follower happened and he has to make sure you have the character so what are you complaining about what are you crying about [Applause] when your thinking has changed you could stand alone [Music] you can stand alone you know I think you made me see that could I keep on I think of wars Vietnam different Wars many times they would have these prisoners of war and he would read stories afterwards of prisoners who were tortured to give information about where the enemy was already where every campus located and they were these soldiers who they could never break he could never break them defeat them tell us where captain is located and they seemed nothing they were trained to say I am George II two five seven eight Marines so I would every last eight o'clock that's what they said they could not break them [Applause] that strength is human mental strength [Applause] quad straight that's not the mind of Christ what is your excuse try a common where's he where's he can't a located here's what you see the pastor's house if you take the main road one trial come you say this is only church members after four numbers are there order what's up let me go but those men stood their ground it's the same thing with Christians who were persecuted and attack itches Jesus Christ is the Lord but if Adam said it was a yes or no it was like let's be there on Sundays in the world but I'm still checking it out I already make up my mind fully so you can let me go if I already convinced outcome no if they said yes Lyons then it was said no they go back home it's a choice I know if that ages will come back here today I can count [Applause] we're keeping it really at this morning but if not this is the hottest is but you know that it was easier it was yes or no it's like yes Lord and you know that's it and you know I can't give them Chris and I ox anointing that it went poorly say Lord I'm coming home you see that so I've got my mind made up deserve the Lord anybody listen I've got my mind made up to serve the Lord is your mind really made up Lord I've got my mind made up something has to happen in your life for that song to become a real reality to you God will take you to stop until you can say I've got my mind made up after you lost enough I've got my mind made up when the doctor dealer when you have got my mind made up to serve the Lorna look never can move me Lord I'll cut anybody in the house this morning no he's leaving yes I trust my daughter's kid one sister my body I've got my mind made up to serve the Lord all of my black my mind I'm not a singer but I feel like singing oh god help us is smooth what up friends it has got to be real to you not a soul is enough there has got to be reality the rapture is real this message is real this gospel is real oh we are back to the Bible this morning oh there's a real pride that's coming fought because the time of the word I was brought by the Prophet is the expressed thoughts of God concerning everything but the first time when Abraham was here when Moses was here when Joshua was here when Zechariah was here when Isaiah was here even when Jesus was here go out to wait until you unfold in his spots until he could bring it our people who could appreciate the fullness of what this whole plan has all been about he couldn't have done it before you have to ever keep up with the special capacity to be the receiver the mind of Christ even the intelligence to know what he wants done with the water oh come on church come on church my random cell what we need to do is get rid of a lot of our fancy fandango's and get back to the Bible and back to the old-fashioned Holy Ghost that's the spots of call and back to the place where men and woman look and act and walk like Christians oh oh you might think I'm a little excited I'm just a little crazy but I tell you I love to be this way that's my prophet hallelujah you may be seated but the banner said if you have aught against anyone even an unbeliever you are standing damnation of Hell fire come on now we want his thoughts on the matter I don't care what you think it's irrelevant God doesn't even care what you're thinking all he wants to do is press his thoughts inside of you then you can become an instrument he can see there's my spirit flowing freely here's my son there's my daughter they are not thinking their thoughts they are thinking my thoughts my thought and all the effort my words are their words they are flesh of my flesh they are all of my poem they are spirit of my spirit that's my wife that's my bride that's my lady and by them and through them we'll people fill everything in the world give the Lord a shout of praise [Applause] I'm not going to be too much longer but I want to drive this down we wonder what our neighbors think Christmas coming up people wonder what anybody thinks we wonder what our families think we wonder what our community things you wonder what our various things our people our tribe our clique of a group is there anybody interested what God thinks we wonder what our school friends think what-whatever coworkers think we wonder what the church for think you know what 99% of the church was wrong because churches present all traditions of the elders that I'm not even scriptural that's why does given that seeking the Lord while he may be found silver and come back return to God not return to church there's so much flesh in the church that's my government pull out from the church his bride not please not talk was not man-made ideas nothing how we do it for 40 years I don't want to hear it give me his thoughts on the matter that's what I want the thoughts of God is there anybody interested in what questions the musicians can get ready I'm not gonna be too much longer because a person goes to church because the person is in the message because someone listens to the preacher and follows the instruction of the elders does that mean that they automatically begin to think the way God thinks but the Branham he reference and like I said Albert Einstein many times listen to Albert Einstein's quotation the world as we have created it is the process of our thinking it cannot be changed without changing our thinking decisions are a product of thinking you cannot decide unless there was some measure of thought it may have been a lot of thinking it may be very little thinking but whenever a decision is made a decision is the result of an equal sign I have decided further Jesus a decision is made what is your decision today because when the thoughts of God become your thoughts your decisions would be like his decisions many of us in the days when Jesus was there would have condemned the woman at the well because that was the prevailing thinking of that day when Matthew the tax collector came to church didn't like Matthew that was their thinking but God called Matthew because he was predestinated to be one of the twelve not as a book of Matthew go figure that out the brothers had to accept that because it was God's choice because up until the upper room they were still subject to their own thinking on two occasions reading in Scripture listen to the disciples challenge even after the Lord's Supper Jesus found the disciples arguing who between us in more than one place in scripture the best thing the disciples that discuss after the loss of her is who's here who's greater who's greater among us I'm takiyah had to come and say well here here's what here's what my thinking is different from your thinking let me his greatest let him to show you how God's thinking is different from our thinking and you are born with your thinking you can be gonna piss on myself and our thinking is influenced by our parents by our school teachers by the preacher by people around us and there's a difference between the parallel to the teacher even the preacher and God himself revealing his thinking we are not promised the mind of the preacher or the mind of the pastor we are promised the mind of Christ to know what he wants done with the wood with a random said their churches take on the spirit of the pasta that's the Prophet we don't want a spirit of the pasta we want the Holy Spirit I don't want anybody's thinking on the matter what is God's thinking on the matter God thinking is repent and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and there's a promise that you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost that's his thinking on the matter there's no room for interpretation when God has taught it and express it in the world when he acts person have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed Paul wasn't speaking his thoughts he was thinking his thoughts he had a burden for these believers they weren't genuine believers pipe record speaks to you today and his thoughts will become your fists because the catch of burden to catch a bullet of a prayer to catch a bullet or in fact because God has a burden twenty Lord I wanna put it into pre it's you entering a mind of God to catch his burden that's why I said I put a mark upon those who sigh and cry for the abomination in the City summer crying that's for the old house that's what I'm talking about Zion crying please the Zion cry that burden must come from somewhere else it is not your nature to be that way it has to be God's nature but God so loved the world he gave His only Son he gave everything that's his nature oh god help us we talk about Adam falling in the garden listen carefully Adam was just like his father his thinking was like his father that's why God could trust him to me him the animals it was because God trusted his thinking now listen speak to Eve it was Adams responsibility to tell Eve what God had said it was while Adam was away the serpent came and we got Eve now watch this Adam is like his father Adam heard from God I don't know better yes it was the byproduct but the attribute in Adam sword and his wife had just been cut off and in that first story that we described as the fall we see the redemptive power of his father expressing Adam because Adam maker made a choice to cross over to get his wife that was love and God made a choice to preach eternity preached eternity and step over and step into time God took the choice to preach perfection and cross over so he can take on sin so you can feel what we feel so he can enjoy what we didn't have to do it but he made a choice the same way Adam made a choice they made the same choice for love [Applause] [Music] his thinking is not our thinking his ways I'm not always as he heavens are higher than the earth Joyce his ways and its thinkin higher than our ways what manner of love is this that core to call the prostitute that the world will reject what manner of love is this that he could come to the brokenhearted what manner of love is this take it come to the backslider and say come home come home come home forget your past forget your mistakes what manner of love is this that he could die and shed his blood and he can see once is under the blood I can't even pull it back out I can't even take back your mistakes can't even tell you what you did I don't even know what you did because it's it's under the blood if you could think of sorts then you would hear the words of Jeremiah I know the thoughts the plans I have for you talks of peace but joy to give you an expected end and that has no surprises is an expected end an end ray of family can be restored and we even have the Holy Ghost and may your joy that you lost to come back [Music] halleluyah halleluyah Oh we're thinking starts this morning yeah oh he loves you he loves you he loves you he loves you he loves you this morning he loves you this morning that's his thoughts about you he loves you this small he loves you this morning somebody worship him somebody praise him somebody give him honor somebody give him glory somebody give him worship somebody thank him somebody bless His Holy Name halleluyah halleluyah [Music] hallelujah hallelujah [Applause] [Music] [Music] yes [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] Oh [Music] the random said in the message ahem there'll be a power put into the church and now is coming in that the Holy Spirit was so annoying the people till nails the wood and it'll create itself right there we haven't seen powers like that coming to the church now I know it for a fact see under this mountain be moved don't doubt in your heart but believe that what you have said shall come to pass you can have what you have said the placing of the church in position where the fullness of the power of the Holy Ghost comes into the church then the critics will be shut in the spoken word is the original seed notice what harmony and this is your promise Jesus never did anything until seen of the father or the father showed him for this harmony between God and rice so will the bride he shows her his word and she receives it she never doubts it nothing can harm her not even depth for if the seed be planted the water will raise it up again now I got a great big hallelujah here's the secret the word is in the bride listen him and the mind of Christ to know what he once done with the woman and she does it in his name she has the Lord that's your promise what the mind of Christ you may be seated I'm gonna be finishing up soon but the Branham was a seer and he taught to that after the eyes there's no moving faculty but he beyond the eyes for the intelligence it's to know words thoughts of the matter would it be wonderful to know God's thoughts on your job God's thoughts and what time you should leave home in the morning record thoughts and on what to do when the day comes got thoughts on what to tell your husband wouldn't it be beautiful to know court sports and what to tell your wife in the right words for your children God's thoughts and why he took you true your trial to know God's fortune and why he led you this way to what a blessing is later to know God thoughts thinking his thoughts what a comfort in the midst of a trial because his thoughts was what comforted Joshua Joshua wasn't moved because he had the thoughts of God but Brandon was a move because he had the possible Moses was a move because he had the thoughts of God Elisha wasn't moved because at the paths of God [Music] total surrender my thoughts gone my feelings gone my Iman evil emotions and opinions God and say Lord I'm surrender to you I'm ready to surrender that's the first step you and the Holy Ghost surrender give up give up give up give up your thoughts give up your ideas you want your family back surrender say Lord I surrender I surrender today I surrender my all I surrender my life I surrender my my everything to you today but I want your thoughts every head bowed every eye closed but the random crowd to the church lord I haven't done enough Oh haven't done enough have you done enough have we done enough have you done enough have I done enough have we done enough because his thinking is what goes the extra mile his thinking gives the cloak to his thinking goes beyond human reasoning his thinking directed his disciples to go to the other side when he was exhausted his thinking and the disciples were so surrendered so obedient let me surrender to his thinking and it did what he instructed him to do Jonah heard the voice of God the thoughts of God he walked away from it only to find that he was right back to her God's thoughts and expressed of where he should be his attempts to do it his way field and our attempts to it our way will always fail because only God's thoughts expressed as the word is what will prevail friends am guilty of not doing enough I'm guilty of my own thoughts I'm guilty of my own feelings my own opinions my own perspectives I'm guilty this morning I'm repentant this morning I need to be more surrendered to his thinking I want to be more like him I want to be just like him I want his compassion on what his love he is merciful we are not he is holy we are not he is righteous we had not Oh God moving as hosts this morning he is the best friend I want to be the kind of friend that Jesus would be I want his feet I want his thoughts I want his thoughts and how I should dress I want his thoughts and where I should work and what his thoughts and I don't know what is he doing a Saturday morning I want his thoughts I would I should read I want his thoughts and who I should call in the fall and I want his thoughts the Bible says they had to see the Lord but they kept still it only did his will brother Branham said what kind of church what we have if we will such harmony Jesus Jesus had nothing unless the father showed him first I want to pray conscious of his thoughts then you will see changes in your life it'll change the way you look at your children it will change the way you look at your husband at your wife at the deacon at the usher and the pastor it'll change your thinking we look with our eyes too much our eyes would lie to us it's limited by our human reasoning our past our mistakes but the eyes of God from the thoughts of God the actions of God sees from from that book see is the possibility of you receiving the Holy Ghost he sees you victorious he sees you in a happy marriage he sees you successful he sees you as a advertisement born as whether Branham said to show the world in such a time of this we can have real Christians I don't care what the young people wear in your job on your school it doesn't matter give us reality give us your thoughts father the mind of Christ to know what to do with the world that brought to us by a vindicated prophet is anybody like me want to repent for your own thinking your own desires your own ambition your own revelations your own ideas your own dreams your own
