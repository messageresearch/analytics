that we feel it's always such a privilege to be gathered together in the house of the Lord amen and what a series of services we've been having you appreciate the service from Sunday [Applause] message after message we've been getting if you have your Bibles I'd like you to tune with me to a very familiar scripture reading from the book of Ephesians reading from chapter six verses 11 to 17. and it says Ephesians 6 from 11 it says put on the whole armor of God that he may be able to stand against The Wiles of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against Powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places wherefore take unto you the whole armor of God that he may be able to withstand in the evil day and have having done all to stand stand therefore having your loins Goods about with truth and having on the breastplate of righteousness and your feet shot with the preparation of the gospel of peace above all taking the shield of faith wherewith you shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked and take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit which is the word of God let me just bar heads once more father we pray that you have bless the word that we just read Lord Lord I pray that you would take full control everything that is said everything that is done Lord Lord may be careful to give you all the praise all the honor and all the glory may we have such an atmosphere of worship and praise and adoration to you knowing that it's just by your grace we are here Lord Lord and you are able to do above and and and and exceedingly above what we could ask or think Lord I pray that you would move throughout this place tonight in Jesus name we pray amen you may have your seats and just for a contact I read that scripture there and just as I begin I want to ask you to pray for me because the thought I have here I hope that God just put everything together like a puzzle and it don't make sense amen you know I just want to lay down some facts before we begin things we already know but just want to reiterate the devil isn't trying to play fair he isn't playing games he isn't trying a thing he knows what he's about he's he's out there to steal to kill to destroy to brutalize to to abuse to do what he can to Snuff you out to kill your potential before you could achieve what God may have set in your heart to accomplish and if he could do that he'll be very happy so it's our duty it's our job it's our responsibility to ensure that that cannot happen and we don't become a statistic of the devil amen as such read the scripture where we are we are admonish and encourage you put on the whole arm our God because we're in a battle it's a war we're not here to play games we're not here to just talk and fellowship and have a good time and shake hands and go back home we here because it's business it's serious like I say he's not playing games amen once we understand that and we have that as a context it should speak to the kind of attitude that we must have it must speak to the kind of responsibility we have to ensure that we know what we are about there is nobody that could could say they entertain a war entertain a battle entain a challenge and they do understand the adversary don't understand the enemy don't understand what to expect and whatever swear of life you look at if you look at sports if you look at education if you look at the military wherever you look you have to be able to gauge where you are the resources you have and what the enemy might look like and if you know what that is you could know how to stand how to oppose how to attack how to defend how to adjust amen and that's the context in which you want to look here and I'll give you my title one time it says as a title of after training is completed because yes we talk about being in a battle but this battle is not a Vegas haphazard random sporadic thing say go and fight no we have to be trained we have to be tutored we have to know what we have and how we want to approach the battle that's the only way I'll get the victory so for title after training is completed and for subject I have the test is coming so no matter what you do the test coming whether you decide to do the training halfway where they decide to not do the training at all this test still coming it's not up to you the tests coming because it tests is predestinated to come it's your duty to prepare for it amen so with that background I did a little research I'm not a military man but I did a little research into how they operate within the military and according to the institute for defense analyzes and the defense technical information center they add this to share and I want to share it with you tonight it says military training means definite but very different things to different people to the commander of a military unit it means exercising troops in the field or Sailors at sea so that they operate as an integrated coordinated unit to military personnel the personal managers rather it means preparing and certifying individuals across a full spectrum of Occupational Specialties that include Cooks Dog Handlers tank turret repairers radar technicians and fighter pilots so it's different categories of workers different categories of stuff different skill sets different areas of specialization and it says to develop to developers and providers of major military systems it means exercises performed in simulators or on the systems themselves to all concerned it means preparing individuals from a civilian Society to perform as professional military personnel why is this important to us because it goes to show it doesn't matter who you are where you are you could be a cook you could be handling the dogs you could be a fighter pilot you could be flying jets you still need to be trained you still need to operate with a certain level of rules you still need to to be able to to be disciplined you still need to understand instructions and know when to attack and when to retreat when to defend and when like like we had here in Trinidad let's say attack with full force you need to know when to to do that right and it goes to show this is not my words this is not my description this is something that the military you uses they want to convert civilians or what people talk lay persons into military professionals or military personnel it goes on and it says and you know I'm reminded every time you go through the airport you see immigration Customs I think TSA officers also and oftentimes you look at some of them and you wonder how old you're really operating because you see one guy but he have about three guns he have two knives a battle two radios walkie-talkies three handcuffs God knows what else he has probably a clipboard and some other things as well why the thing is when you are trained in the military no matter what arm of the military you are trained you have to be prepared for anything even as simple as it sounds I remember being a Cub Scout when I was very very small and the motor was always be prepared because the enemy can attack at any point the enemy don't have a face and they come and say well how are you today you know are going to start a war with you know are going to enter a battle so what I want you to do is meet me tomorrow because I'm gonna bring some backup they do operate so they're looking to get the edge to get the advantage you're looking as they call it the unguided moment so you have to be extra prepared to be able to defend an attack amen so that's what we are called to do to put on the full arm of God and you'll see there are items within the Arma itself to defend you and their items to attack you're not just standing still is either you're moving forward or you're going back a little bit and you're strategizing how are going to move forward next time right with that said it goes on to say military training must prepare individuals listen to this to enter into Harm's Way they didn't say the train and you have to sleep home to stay home and watch TV and relax to enter into Harm's Way and perform physically and mentally demanding tasks at the highest possible levels of proficiency so it means after you go to the train training your car walk out halfway and say boy I went through the Barack so you know I do some push-ups there you know and I really couldn't figure out how how to run the five or ten kilometers or no but but I graduate it don't work so they want you to operate at the highest possible levels of proficiency it goes on to say this requirement may be the defining characteristic of military training it can mean the def the difference between life and death just like in the military we are called upon to be trained we are called to understand instructions and react accordingly to take discipline to take information and you know there's a saying that nothing is is learned until there's a change in Behavior because somebody could teach the same thing for years you could preach for years and if there's no change is not as effective as it could be when you see a behavior change and you realize you stand up a particular week your boots shine up a particular way your reacts a particular way your eyes fixed and focus a particular way they know you graduate you went through it may be tough you may feel to give up at times you know but they wouldn't kill you amen they know they have a set of tasks that are predetermined that you must go through because they know chances are enemy that coming with one of these things so you would have heard me mention earlier on some of them even use simulators or use the real thing because you can't just watch videos and then say boy are going to Warriors are gone you never hold a backpack you never hold somebody on your back and run with them you never train but you want to go in the battlefield your dogs dead licks for you that's that easy the devil could send some little minion some little personal and say listen take him out fast there is no no opposition right but we are called upon to a higher level we are Kings and prisoner we're not just standing up and if we go on no not without a fight and we promise the victory so we can't just sit down and I wonder how we get any Victory I wonder I know what's going to happen next no no no no no no no no we want to go through the training and adopt the principles and be able to apply it I want to give you a secret here no matter how much you train how much you go to school how much you practice on your football field how much you explore the training you go through is almost never the same as the real thing so you could hike you could run you could jump do a hundred push-ups your practice in in in in the field of of sport right let's say football or basketball they have what you call set pieces or set plays so the coach will say listen pastor this one to this one to this one two three three point show or you do this on your free kick here but you know in the real game it'll always be so because while you think you're doing that the person on the opposite side trying to escape tackle you they're trying to do our next move so often times you have to use the knowledge you have and apply it in a way that it could be useful and effective at that time if you don't train you have no tools to draw upon so think about this Christ was tempted right treat us imagine if Christ don't know the word that making sense how how you respond but I really hungry yes boy you see it turn this thing into bread here it's best I make some bread by no if he do have tools to draw upon you have nothing to use imagine if David didn't have stones in a sling he could walk around he used to play the harp and things so he was creative I have a sling it is a sling it's a nice sling and with this we can win if he'd open a stone in there he sing and I know reality is you have to know these are the parameters these are the tools these are the techniques these are the tactics you may not use all in the battle but you need to know them is the same with tests you know this is this is graduation time this is exam time this is test time there are those young children who believe school is forever you might write an SCA or csec or CXC or whatever stage University and you go through school you go through years or months of tuition and you call upon to learn a hundred percent of what's taught that whole textbook not coming for The Examiner the whole textbook will not be on the exam but you need to learn the whole thing because something in the exam going to come from the book so you need to know everything in order to be prepared likewise this is just the way it is it's like a parallel this is just the way it is we know to know we need to know the devices of the enemy we need to know the way it has come to where he will try to tie us up the way he will try to deceive us the way he will try to nudger a little bit you know so if we know those things here they come real good and even when you come good if we never see it before we need to apply the principles that we've been exposed to to check him that's not going to work on this end time right because we train better than that we are Elite group we are a proficient Bunch we have a high degree of proficiency because we've been trained that's the only way I could pass the test listen no matter the level of educational training you have done there comes a time when the classes are over no matter you could be in the military sometimes it's six months it's two years they may send you a way to do a course there comes a point in which they tell you you know what we've reach the end this is it I have imparted or I've taught or I've spoken I have broadcast lecturers or so this is all you need to know you really think when you walk out there you walk out guns blazing you need the battle it don't work so I know you finish the training but they tested Rich yet you might finish the class you finish your course the lecturers say listen well exam is next month you know The Examiner every chat we finish the syllabus exam come in it's up to you now to prepare it's up to you know to learn it's up to you to reiterate it's up to you to remind yourself listen hold on one plus one is two two plus two is four because the test is going to come still regardless the data search engine right at that point when you're in the test are just trying to cover all businesses while you're in the test you can't say boy sir didn't go through the snow she didn't do this with me you know imagine they treat me in the Army there and they had me running up and down but they prepare me for the the winter they prepare me no at that time too late to blame Messina it's too late to blame at that point when it matters when the rubber hits the road is you and your experience your training your faith keeping you you know no no you can't make excuses at that point you know you can't come and say well boy if if you know what I went through the Examiner don't know your teacher personally you know they don't know you personally you know The Examiner coming just to check listen pass it as he failed liters he passed away field no respect to our persons we don't care who your mother is who your father is if your grandfather might be the pastor you don't care about that you know either you pass the test or your fairly test and in this case the difference is life or death so the idea life no he died you know this one dies statistic you know next one you know next one no next one listen I'm reminded in in within the children of Israel that left Egypt over 2 million people right I don't know how else to say this but we need to make it over right what that says is that the rest would have died that's failure you know so so although they may have heard a word their family might have told them Moses would I tell them this is what to expect we go into the promised land have faith believe line upon line listen at the end of the day the feeling but listen God's so sweet God so awesome God so amazing Gardener sitting on crying boil up all these people all these people fail the test no he looking for people who have a burning desire to pass the test if you have a desire to pass the test he working with you he has no respect to a person so he he don't care if if you have to do the training over and over he don't care about that sometimes you have to do it over and over he wants to know that you have a burning desire to pass that test and if you're willing to do what it takes to pass a test you're willing to work with you regardless regardless right so when all Audi tuition is done often times we come to graduation time and also I think in the in the in the local context of the military or so they call it passing out so you finish your train I know you're passing out and they tell you you know this this batch or this cohort you know in your University use at that tomb this cohort they graduate yeah no if you don't pass the tests where are you going yeah do it over if we graduate here if they allow you to pass and they send you any Battlefield that is as good as them signing it that warrant you know if God were to say well listen you live and hear all you want you come and go however you please you just go ahead man that's as good as saying you fail one time you're doing how to walk on the battlefield you're done because you're not prepared to fight this battle and this battle is a real battle there's no joke thing now I read it before and I'll read it again this battle is not against flesh and blood you know this battle is not if I like you I don't like you or the past I like you're the past I don't like you or you like this group and you find this one talk to your off that is not the battery talking about here this battle is like listen principalities and powers and spiritual wickedness in high places I tell you the devil not making joke he not playing he counter to kill to steal to destroy to see how he could snuff out no tonight that's his goal that's his objective that's his responsibility so in order to overcome that you need to be prepared you need to be trained you need to come through the training and pass till you could reach at graduation point no When You Reach graduation I want you to just flow with me you know when you reach graduation often times this is the point at which the teacher does come back teacher tends to come back to graduation and say you know what you're the top student or they often use that as an opportunity to give you life advice or advice to move forward they tell you you know what you make a true boy it was toughen over you know you give us a little trouble you know but your stand the test you make it true and oftentimes they use it as a time to reiterate what is expected of you so in the military I'm not a military man but I could only imagine they may come and say listen you're among the best you are trained nobody else could operate the way you are you could operate as a one-man army or in a group you all militant you all could do anything whatever they say so it kind of reinforces the purpose for the tricks you train in at that stage and just so it is in the Bible when you look and you don't have to turn with me but in the Book of Joshua chapter 1 verse one to eight it goes like this and I know it's a familiar scripture but it reminded me of that graduation effect they say now after the death of Moses the servant of the Lord it came to pass that the Lord speak unto Joshua the son of nun Moses Minister saying Moses my servant is dead now therefore arise go over this Jordan thou and all these people unto the land which I do give to them to the children of Israel every place now this is where the Declaration starts at this point they say every place that the soul of your foot shall tread upon that have I given unto you as I I said unto Moses so the same thing I said unto him are telling you because you graduate at this point you're going to be assigned to do a battle you're already went through the training so I do expect you to come and say but but but Moses said tell tell me exactly what I'm supposed to do here no no no no no no no this is not the point that's which you make excuses this is graduation time so we come now and we say from the Wilderness and this Lebanon even onto the Great River the river Euphrates all the line of the Hittites and onto the great sea towards the going on of the sun shall be your Coast there shall not any man be able to stand before the holidays of your life because you're trained so no man could stand before your holidays of your life as I was with Moses so I will be with thee so I'll I'll be in the background I'm watching you because I know you took the training and you graduate now you're qualified to go on the battlefield amen so it says as I was at Moses so I will be with thee I will not fail thee nor forsake thee be strong because there are times when you might feel weak but I want you to be strong so I said this is where they encourage you they come and tell you listen you could do this you have this you're trained you're qualified you're certified you could go out and represent but I want to remind you of these things in case you forget it says in verse 6 be strong and have a good courage For unto this people shall thou divide for an inheritance the land which I swear unto their fathers to give them only be thou strong and very courageous so this is second time so in case you forgot the first time listen focus and pay attention you know I want you to be strong and very courageous that thou mayest observe to do according to all the law which Moses my seven commanded thee turn not from it to the right hand or to the left that thou mayest Prosper with with us whoever thou goest now it goes on in verse 8 and I want to slow down to read this one this book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth but Thou shalt meditate therein day and night that thou must observe to do according to all that is written therein for then Thou shalt make thy will prosper us and then thou shall have good success so listen this is this is the blueprint this is the guide so this is listen you're already trained you're qualified you're certified and I'm about to release you right so at graduation that's what what happens so you go through five years of schooling or three years or however long no matter what field of endeavor you're in at that stage you tell you listen to your goddess you've been through this we've gone through the course with you you've graduated you've passed the test so at this stage we want you to go out and succeed we want you to conquer we want you to apply everything that you've learned and we want you to be a blessing to people we want you to conquer and overcome and get a victory because that's what you're trained to do you have the tools you have the techniques you have colleagues and and everybody around there you have all the elements of success all you have to do is go forth and do it that's what's what's going on here and we know what happened now at the same time I want to just shift gear I guess a little bit and I alluded to it early on with respect to David often times and I said when you train no matter how long you train the test may not be exactly as you train so in academic tests they call it practice tests or mock exams so they will bring practice tests and mock exams and they tell you this this like this I think at least School a long time right and when they do that you do that on your aceit man you come out your head held high your chest up on your hey I got this but you know when the real exam comes it's not the same questions is different it might be similar but it's not the same you know I I'm reminded of late brother Knights when I when I got my driver's license the day I got my license he was the officer doing the test and my foot shaking I was nervous and I driving and at a balancing clutch on the thing when I was done you know what he said he said he have a good one you get your license today no I want you to go and practice and learn to drive right no the reason he said that is because you get a license which is certifying that you could be on the road but but that don't mean your professional your cargo on the race yet you know because I often say who does teacher to drive any night they don't do driving school any nighttime who does teacher to drive any rain they don't do Driving School in the rain and I'm sure there are other new answers so just like that in life God will come and say listen hear water you see that dear I want you to watch it more you see that one over there he may not read and spell everything but he gave a diseasement he gave you a training he gave you tools he gave you his word he gave you his guidance so when you go out into the workplace you can tell when your boss seems to turn against you or co-workers talk about you or whatever this scenario is that's just a testament just a test I've been preparing parents for a long time so don't feel big people like you and your neighbors say good morning every morning that everything cool and that he's anxiety because from time to time listen they are assigned to challenge you know they assign the testing they are assigned to see if those virtues living in Europe why they tell you add to your faith virtual knowledge and Temperance and patience and godliness and probably guys and we've been taught that those virtues will be tested so we can't find it strange and be surprised when but yes yo this one talk to me I I thought we were friends I thought we better than that no it's just a test but you prepared for that we train and day in day out meditating day in day out so we'll have good success that's why you're doing it in David's case same way the training is exact replication of what is to come it's almost like a template it's a guide you still have to apply the principles and the concepts right so David playing as happy singing and he's taking care of the sheep and this is what he does and he at ease inside and he doing his thing and a bear came a lion came he defeated them let me read it there's a there's a message but Abraham spoke a personal experience with God from paragraph 18. it says Saul found out that the ecclesiastical vest of Soul didn't fit a man of God and so it waited him down that's what the trouble with a lot of men today as I meet as I cross the land men of great standing in high churches and Things They believe this message of Deliverance they believe the message of the Lord Jesus and his power but they're so Shackled down with church denominations till they can't see no further than the church they won't let them any further what we need today is somebody to step out with some experience with a slingshot like David David had David said I don't know nothing about your theology you know and about these swords and so forth but your servant with this slingshot I had an experience out there that God let me kill a lion with it and kill her bear with it and if you let me kill a lion with it she surely that uncircumcised Philistine belongs to me this afternoon God give us some more Ruddy boys with that kind of Ruddy experience that'll take God at his word and believe him for everything he says is the truth amen that's what we need tonight my dear Christian friends and now I want you to notice he went out and proved exactly that God was with him because he had an experience that God could deliver the enemy into his hand by his slingshot David didn't care if it was a bear a lion a raccoon a spider whatever come his confidence was in God's ability to deliver him with his slingshot so once you see enemy are wrong it didn't matter what they look like remember I say you're trained for this when you train it don't matter who if the enemy coming from the north south east west day time night time it don't matter if it's if it's more looking like more for them boys Victory but he gave any tools he gave her the training and responsibility so you have to show up we often preach that that David spin in his sling you think he at the time you take listen I want you to spot me take a binoculars and see the distance that giant is check the wind speed David was not sniper he was trained but he was last night but he had confidence that listen you see the God I serve the God I serve could take the sling on me this sling is almost like the extension of me and if I serve God the way I serve God he able to deliver bear lion giant elephant whatever the opposition is he able to deliver me with my slingshot does the confidence he have and as a confidence we need to have in God that listen we defeat any devil anytime anywhere any place under any condition he will be defeated he will be conquered because we train for this amen I don't want to keep it too long but I just want to shift a little bit more you know there are some disciples I really admire this is disciples you know I'll tell you what I admire about them these disciples Walk With Jesus you know the real guy don't know they walk with Jesus for three and a half years Peter and all these fellas Walk With Jesus for three and a half years so if there was anybody seeking evidence is these fellas even despise the spies went out and came back so they brought evidence right but these fellas were walking with the evidence they're walking with God Walking With Jesus every day so they could see when he he sick and you raise it dead and you tell them listen give me a little space I want all the unbelief out just just bring some bread for this girl and she arose right so they are custom seeing these things that was really you know they have something we call on the job training that's what they had they had the ultimate on the job training because they're walking with Christ every day talking with Christ so they could see the manifestation they could see the challenges the problems they could see God passed this one but you bypassed this one but something draw him to this one and this was the result so they saw full sun so I say that to say that if it's anybody should have real Faith as these disciples because they have all the evidence they have a life on the job itself it's not somebody tell them is from before and listen my grandfather tell me a virgin shall conceive in one be I see it yet I'll be waiting on the promise no they weren't waiting like that at that time they were walking with the manifestation of the promise live on hand so with that I want to read a simple or I should say a short quote from questions and answers right but I was talking about conversion but it's he speaks of Peter he said no to make this efficient Jesus said to Peter who had also followed him for three and a half years and in the Book of Matthew the 10th chapter Jesus gave Peter power against unclean spirits to go out and cast them out to healistic and to preach the gospel he had power to do this so I don't want you to look surprised Jesus give him power to do these things and in Saint John 17 17 Jesus Sanctified Peter through the truth said the word was the truth and he was the word and then at before Pentecost he said after you're converted and strengthen your breath your brethren you are only taking steps to conversion as you believe and are acting right so what we could glean from that and what we could see from that and we could hear from that is that Jesus gave Peter power to do particular things he was walking with Jesus Jesus said Peter hear what you have power to do x y z I give you that power right so you know what you are the tools you're trained you walk with me you see how it's done you see how we can do it you know what's possible so you have faith you could believe now in Acts chapter 3 you don't have to find it just a few verses there um is it no Peter and John you know it they went up together into the temple at The Hour of Prayer being the ninth hour and a certain man lame from his mother's womb was carried whom they had laid daily at the Gate of the temple which is called Beautiful to ask arms of them that entered into the temple so he was placed there every day somebody placed him there every day to beg people who are walking into the temp temple so you're begging these Saints as they're going daily so what's a ritual it was something that you do you grow accustomed that you know what this is what I do to take me out here and I beg I go back home they bring it back tomorrow and I beg and go back home no more living that's what he was doing every day same thing and it went honestly who's seeing Peter and John about to go in the temple ask an arms so they were not exempt although they were walking with Christ they will ask us give me five dollars give me twenty dollars I know there's also plenty these days right so they were not exempt from from that so they were asked and Peter it goes on in verse 4 and say and Peter fastening his eyes upon him with John look at what I'm about to tell you look at what I'm about to do because you season one change I've been trained in here for a long time but Jesus not not here right now on my own so I go in and show you based on the tools and resources that I have power that was given to me I gonna express it no because I can right no Jesus wasn't behind them saying you see that guy there try it out on him no but they were trained right so it goes on to say in verse 5 and he gave heed unto them expect him to receive something of them so no problem you call me you acknowledge me yeah yeah already I'm willing to receive and Peter said in verse six Silver and Gold Have I None but such as I have give I Thee in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk and then it's more significant what he did after in verse 7 and he took him by the right hand and lifted him up and immediately his feet and ankle bones receive strength and he leaping up stood and walked and entered with them into the temple walking and leaping and praising God so this was the application of the training and the tools that they received so this goes to show just like Ebel and Kane when God said do as a brother you'll get the same blessing it goes to show the training is there Jesus was walking with them teaching them guiding them but there Comes A Time In which you're on your own you can't walk out walk behind you the pastor can't follow you to work we're not going to say I wonder if he behave good you read the Bible today you're singing out with this song yesterday no no no no no no at the end of the day when you are trained and you're prepared you're on your own but you have the tools so when called upon to act you have to be able to manifest that you have to be able to to to perform at that stage and they say you will be trained and you should have a high degree of proficiency so we're not halfway and well I I was one of them used to walk with Jesus you know but you know I never really tried that that healing thing I don't know if if it might work no no no no no the confidence he had is that Peter looked onto him and said listen look on us Focus here I don't have money right now however what I have are going to give you and he'll lift him up and immediately healing immediately he was able to leap and jump and go in the temple and worship he didn't just sit down he didn't just stand up and say well thanks well you know that was good to know this is somebody who overcame they say he was lame from birth from his mother's womb so for however old he was he was doing this all the time every day but here it is because somebody was trained you could have reach out to somebody else it kind of reminds me of going after the lost and and and and your family that backslidden because you trained you could reach out to them and you could cry out for them you could really stand the gap on their behalf without them but you trained you have the tools you have the resources right now you know in our time brother Branham actually identified the same scripture he used the same scripture and he broke it down and I want to break it down the way he did he said and in the message the greatest battle ever thought because we're in a battler in the greatest battle ever fourth paragraph 326. he says no what did he say here now listen closely finally my brethren be strong in the Lord and the power of His might be strong in the power of His might put on the whole armor of God and that you may be able to stand against The Wiles of the devil rather Trulia for we wrestle not against flesh and blood shooting bullets and cut with knives see that's not it so I'm not fighting you don't fight in me this is not what it's about but against principalities against Powers against the rulers of Darkness of this world the rulers of Darkness who rules the world the devil certainly who is all these things going on all these ungodly things going on around through here and these governments and so forth It's all the devil the Bible said so I'm not making this up these are not my thoughts now I just want to jump down to paragraph three three one and it says now listen All You Soldiers now just before we start the prayer line take unto you unto you the whole not just part of it the whole armor of God that you may be able to withstand an evil day that's the day we're living in and having done all to stand stand amen get that see honey and he speaks to a sick sister you say when you have done all you can do to stand and stand don't move stand therefore have in your loins listen at this listen here what this is your loins that's the middle part see good about with truth what is the truth the word of God that's right Thy word is truth all right and having on the breastplate of righteousness that is do what's right got the word of God in you doing what's right the breastplate of righteousness and your feet shut with the preparation of the gospel of peace go anywhere any place anytime feet shot with the gospel see and look above all above all of it take the shield of faith that's the one that knocks off the dark see the shield of Faith wherewith you shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked and take the helmet of salvation that's the soul the mind the mind in there the mind in here the head covers over the head and the sword of the spirit which is the word of God how you're going to let this helmet what it does it's a protection what is a helmet made out of brass brass cannot even be tempered hard harder than iron a brass comes from God a brass headpiece the Salvation knowledge of knowing this and my healing comes from God my salvation comes from God my experience matches his word not the church's idea the word amen there you are covered over with a protection the helmet of salvation Deliverance take that then go marching forward oh now now what we're supposed to do Satan's Army now watch no we I gotta hurry but I gotta get get this in Satan's Army listen because I started off by saying we need to know what the opposition is like because you're a train going in the battle you feel is there ready but we don't know wait no we train what is really on the water but you train on land the car worked that way right so he goes on to say Satan's Army now watch Satan's Army brings diseases That's what Satan Army is Satan is he's a destroyer Satan the whole Kingdom of Satan is sickness death and sorrow flusterations and worry all on Satan God is life Faith joy peace over here see no that's the two great forces that coming together right now they're battling they're battling right here in the building right now the battle day by day with you every Force Satan following you along the great big kingly Priestly Goliath trying to scare the liver out of you he's right but God you're fortified amen you're fortified with the gospel by the word of Truth around your law in glory preacher that's what it is helmet of salvation The Shield of Faith the sword waving it in your hand says that I'm coming to meet you you're not just standing back I'm coming to meet you you meet me in the name of science here meet me in the name of culture you meet me in the name of organization you meet me in the name of this that or the other but I meet you in the name of the Lord God of Israel I'm coming after you give way even death itself can't stand there chop a hole right through it that's right Satan's Army bring diseases and God's Army is commissioned to cast them out to cast them out not to stand and watch them to cast them out amen there you are every time Satan throws anyone unto you God's Army is here to cast them out amen cast out you know as the musicians could get ready to come forward on to the final quote you know and in a message who has believed our report say now after all we've said now somebody that's really fundamental what are those people won't have tried it see God does things sometimes that's not in the scope that he's written in the Bible remember you're trained you go through the course you go where there's University or wherever and you believe you know what I do a management degree so I walk out tomorrow I should be a manager no there are things that's good you're going to encounter that you're not ready yet you're not ready for us yet right so sometimes you have to go and things are outside of the scope of what you learn but you need to apply the principles you'll have learned to this scenario and then you'll make it true then you can get a victory then he could overcome and they could say Hey you make it because he said listen you don't want to be an educated fool you don't want to train train and when it's battle time you train too much you're not sure your head from your toe your car apply any of it right so in this case you say listen there are things that may not even be in the scope that's that that is written in the Bible you believe that the Bible is a blueprint sure enough but what if when Peter passed through the gate called beautiful or I mean Jesus at the pool of Bethesda or if those people there said no wait go back in the Old Testament and show me where there's a scripture that that's an angel that's psychology that's nothing but just the wind so they they making their assumptions and want to put that out on Jesus and say you know is he wind blowing around the world there in the pool so when you think the angel Troubled Water is really the breeze that's what he's saying here that's what's doing that but the people believe there was an angel do you believe it was but it wasn't written in the scripture what if them laying in the shadow of Peter and every one of them getting healed what if somebody said no wait a minute now wait a minute show me that in the scripture where they lay in the shadow of a man Paul taking the handkerchief so apron says from his body somebody say oh show me that in scripture where it's going to be it wasn't in the scripture but God did it anyhow is that is that right he rewards you of your faith and it still comes back there to your faith that's what it is your faith whatever you want to do that's it you know so so he is going to take you carry through the training which you need to pass in order to face the battle because Devil in a plane the test comments still the date Not Gonna Change to accommodate you and the examiner don't know you personally he donate a father or mother or Uncle you don't care if he was in church two years or five years or ten years what he cares about is that you have the right answer
